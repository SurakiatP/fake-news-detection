Sound familiar? It did to the leaders of Berkeley Repertory Theater, who, casting about for a show to coincide with the fall presidential campaign, hit upon an idea: They would write a new adaptation of Sinclair Lewis\u2019s 1935 novel imagining the election of an American demagogue: \u201cIt Can\u2019t Happen Here. \u201d The play, which began previews on Friday, is among scores of efforts by theaters across the United States to provoke discussion and reflection about this year\u2019s unusual election, and the unease that it has exposed. Some, like Berkeley Rep, explicitly aim to prompt discussion about Donald J. Trump, whose candidacy has alarmed many in the   theater world others have opted to stage works in which characters grapple with issues debated during the campaign, like immigration or economic inequality. \u201cArt shouldn\u2019t fall into any kind of simplistic, didactic haranguing, and topicality is a dangerous thing, because you always get outstripped by reality,\u201d said Tony Taccone, the longtime artistic director of Berkeley Rep, and a   with Bennett S. Cohen, of the new adaptation. However, he said, \u201cWith the election looming, it felt incumbent on us to respond if we could. \u201d On a recent afternoon, the cast and crew of \u201cIt Can\u2019t Happen Here\u201d gathered at Berkeley Rep\u2019s administrative campus in a   warehouse once occupied by the North Face, to run through the play one last time before moving into a downtown Berkeley theater. The designers had embraced the    feel of a campaign: The set featured flags and drums and images of national parks, and the sound design included a Sousa march. Fourteen actors played nearly 50 roles, and practiced egging on the audience to cheer and jeer with the onstage pageantry. The theater printed     lapel stickers bearing the play\u2019s name for patrons, meant to echo the ubiquitous \u201cI Voted\u201d stickers leaders considered, but decided against, holding a series of related discussion programs, thinking that the culture is already saturated with election talk. The play is scheduled to close Nov. 6, two days before the election. Around the country, theaters are acknowledging the election in various ways. On Broadway, \u201cKinky Boots\u201d has created a video and website to promote voter registration, while \u201cHamilton\u201d cast members are planning to register voters outside their theater on Wednesday and Saturday Off Broadway, \u201cAvenue Q\u201d has added Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump puppets to its company. Some theaters are staging Mike Daisey\u2019s comedic monologue \u201cThe Trump Card,\u201d while many others have brought back plays about political figures, from Frank Rizzo in Philadelphia to Lyndon Baines Johnson in Cleveland and Costa Mesa, Calif. In Washington, five prominent theaters are holding a series of free Monday night readings of politically themed plays, including \u201cIvanka: A Medea for Right Now,\u201d a fictional work about Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter by the playwright Joshua Harmon. Berkeley Rep hit upon \u201cIt Can\u2019t Happen Here\u201d about eight months ago, when an unexpected hole opened in its fall season. Lisa Peterson, who had signed on to direct a show for Berkeley Rep, Googled the phrase \u201cit can\u2019t happen here\u201d and stumbled across the Sinclair Lewis novel, which she was not familiar with Mr. Taccone had read the book in high school and thought it would work. The novel is about a Vermont newspaper editor, Doremus Jessup, who opposes a demagogic presidential candidate, Berzelius Windrip it is a satirical and melodramatic cautionary tale, in which Mr. Windrip wins the election, imposes martial law and seizes control of newspapers his regime arrests and even kills his critics. Lewis, who had already won the Nobel Prize for literature, wrote the novel against an ominous backdrop: Hitler and Mussolini were in power in Germany and Italy, and Huey Long, a senator and former governor who wielded unusual power in Louisiana, was preparing to run for the American presidency. There are some striking similarities between the campaign pitches by the fictional Mr. Windrip and the real Mr. Trump  \u2014   both men were even nominated for the presidency in Cleveland. But there are significant differences: Windrip, among other things, is a Democrat (in the novel, the Republican nominee winds up fleeing to Canada to plot a rebellion) and prone to warnings against Jews Mr. Trump, of course, is a Republican who has focused his concern on Muslims. In their new adaptation, Mr. Taccone and Mr. Cohen have sharpened the echoes. They wrote the campaign remarks by Windrip after watching stump speeches by Mr. Trump they have one of their characters comment on the role of the news media (\u201cThe more offensive his remarks, the more papers get sold\u201d) and, in a dig at Hillary Clinton\u2019s reference to some Trump supporters as belonging to a \u201cbasket of deplorables,\u201d a character explaining Windrip\u2019s popularity says, \u201cIt\u2019s not because they\u2019re all stupid and prejudiced and deplorable. \u201d The novel was first adapted into a play and presented around the country in the late 1930s by the Federal Theater Project  \u2014   Lewis himself appeared in one production, in Cohasset, Mass. as the journalist Jessup. But Berkeley Rep deemed that adaptation unrevivable (\u201cit\u2019s ghastly,\u201d said Susan Medak, its managing director) so Mr. Taccone and Mr. Cohen, with the blessing of the Lewis estate, set about writing a new one in unusually short time. \u201cWhat we saw as the risk was that Trump would not make it through the primaries, and the piece would feel irrelevant,\u201d Ms. Medak said. \u201cBut even if the elections ended up not being about Trump  \u2014   and obviously we hoped they wouldn\u2019t be  \u2014   there was something about this that felt as though it was speaking to what the American public was concerned about, regardless of who the candidate was. \u201d Noting that the 1930s adaptation by Lewis and J. C. Moffitt was presented by multiple theaters around the country, Berkeley Rep this month invited theaters, universities and libraries across the country to hold readings of the play 30 organizations signed up in the first week. \u201cIt\u2019s an outrageous story,\u201d said Tom Nelis, the actor (last seen on Broadway in \u201cThe Visit\u201d) portraying the journalist Jessup in Berkeley. \u201cBut you can\u2019t watch it and not think it\u2019s plausible. \u201d Had enough of CNN? Ready for politics with a dose of stage drama? Berkeley Rep\u2019s new adaptation of \u201cIt Can\u2019t Happen Here\u201d is just one example of how theaters around the country have prepared programming to reflect the American presidential campaign. Some are mounting familiar works, from \u201cCoriolanus\u201d to \u201cAll the Way,\u201d thinking that their themes will resonate especially strongly this fall others are focusing on new shows. Here are some examples: 45 PLAYS FOR 45 PRESIDENTS At the Merrimack Repertory Theatre in Lowell, Mass.
