Buy a more   car. But consumers are heading in the opposite direction. They have rekindled their love of bigger cars, pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, favoring them over small cars, hybrids and electric vehicles, which are considered crucial to helping slow global warming. So far this year, nearly 75 percent of the people who have traded in a hybrid or electric car to a dealer have replaced it with an   car, an 18 percent jump from 2015, according to Edmunds. com, a car shopping and research site. In 2008, President Obama set a goal of a million electric cars on the road by 2015 in the United States, but the total is now around 442, 000, including   hybrids. This year, electric and hybrid sales have dropped to 2. 4 percent of   purchases. Falling gas prices have made big, heavy cars fashionable again, said Michael Sivak, the director of sustainable worldwide transportation at the University of Michigan\u2019s Transportation Research Institute. In fact, demand for trucks, S. U. V.s and vans has rebounded to historic levels after they dropped sharply in 2008, when gas was $4 a gallon. \u201cPeople have very short memories about the price of gasoline,\u201d Dr. Sivak said. That spells trouble for the environment.     vehicles, including S. U. V.s and pickups as well as cars, account for 16. 2 percent of all greenhouse emissions produced in the United States, Dr. Sivak\u2019s research shows, making them the biggest source of emissions that individuals control. Reducing tailpipe emissions \u201cis perhaps the most important thing Americans can do,\u201d said Andrew Jones, a   of Climate Interactive, a think tank. \u201cWe\u2019re doing the opposite. \u201d The changing consumer patterns are in plain view at swapalease. com, a marketplace for people who want to get out of a car lease by transferring it to someone else. Dozens of hybrids and electric vehicles are available, in some cases languishing without bites from buyers. \u201cNobody is interested,\u201d said Angelo Di Maria, who lives in the Bronx. Several weeks ago, he listed his   \u2019s 2013 Toyota Prius. To spur interest, he added a $1, 500 cash incentive, which sharply cut the monthly lease payment to $283 from $391. Still no buyer. Mr. Di Maria said that his    who works in construction, loved the Prius, but that his company had given him a Ford   pickup. \u201cWho doesn\u2019t want to drive around in a big tank?\u201d Mr. Di Maria said. \u201cWhen people start to think gas is more affordable, do they really want to pay the premium on the hybrid?\u201d Buyers of electric cars enjoy huge discounts, however, including federal and state rebates, and the opportunity to bypass gas stations altogether. For that reason, Felix Sui, who works in technology in San Diego, loved his BMW electric car. But now that he and his wife are starting a family, he sold the lease on it so he could buy a Volvo S. U. V. \u201cThe XC90,\u201d he clarified. \u201cThe big one. \u201d A preference for big cars is not going to help the country meet the goals outlined in the Paris climate accord, reached in December. To help reach those goals, average fuel economy would need to soar to at least 100 miles per gallon  \u2014   most likely achievable only through widespread adoption of electric and other   cars, according to Ben Haley, a   of Evolved Energy Research, a consulting firm. President Obama has pushed for stronger federal   rules that call for cars to average 40 miles per gallon by 2025, according to the Environmental Protection Agency the current average is 25. 4 miles per gallon. Though electric cars may be somewhat out of favor for now, that may change. Many are hoping that the Tesla could transform Americans\u2019 views on electric cars, much the way the iPhone did with mobile technology. Tesla still carries asterisks  \u2014   it is losing money, and it is not clear if the company can produce what it has promised  \u2014   but it can point to 370, 000 votes of confidence. That is how many people have put down $1, 000 to reserve one of Tesla\u2019s new Model 3 cars, a significantly   version of its luxury models they won\u2019t even be out until late next year. There are hopes, too, for the 2017 Chevrolet Bolt, which boasts a range of 200 miles, nearly matching the projected range of the Tesla Model 3. Those would more than double the range of many cars on the market, helping alleviate the \u201crange anxiety\u201d that many consumers feel. When Tesla first let people sign up online in March, and reservations surged to 325, 000 within a week, Dr. John Sterman, a climate expert at M. I. T. was heartened by the prospect of broader interest in   cars. \u201cAll my friends and colleagues were sending me links to the media reports,\u201d he said. \u201c I thought, this is great news. \u201d Years from now, he added, \u201cwe will look at this as a watershed moment. \u201d Others who worry about climate change can sound like boosters for the new car. \u201cTesla is notorious for performance. It can outperform the hottest, most conventional car,\u201d said Albert Ayala, deputy executive officer at the California Air Resources Board, a publicagency that governs air quality. When he gives speeches and is asked how the   market can improve, he points to Tesla and says, \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re trying to do. \u201d Seconds after preorders for the new Model 3 became available, John Meyer, 21, an entrepreneur in New York, made his reservation. At the time, he was on a flight from Newark to Los Angeles, and worried that he would miss out if the plane\u2019s   went down. He called the car a \u201cgame changer\u201d because it has everything he wants  \u2014   it is cool, beautiful and powerful, he said, as well as being environmentally friendly. \u201cI could\u2019ve bought a Prius before,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I would have if it looked like an Audi. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561633.986445}
