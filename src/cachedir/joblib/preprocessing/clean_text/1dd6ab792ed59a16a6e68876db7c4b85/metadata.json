A loud noise mistaken for gunfire led to rumors that spread at blazing speed in person and on social media, setting off a panic that shut down one of the nation\u2019s busiest airports, as passengers fled terminals and burst through security cordons, and as the police struggled to figure out what was happening and to restore order. Far from being an isolated episode, it was essentially what had happened on Aug. 13 at a mall in Raleigh, N. C. on Aug. 14 at Kennedy International Airport in New York on Aug. 20 at a mall in Michigan and on Aug. 25 at a mall in Orlando, Fla. In the wake of terrorist attacks at airports in Brussels and Istanbul  \u2014   and against other targets in Paris San Bernardino, Calif. Orlando Nice, France and elsewhere  \u2014   Americans are primed, when they hear a loud bang or screams, or see a crowd break into a run, to think in terms of mass killings and active shooters. Yet crime statistics show that over all, violence in the United States is as low as it has ever been, and experts say the fear far exceeds the risk. \u201cI would say that we are in the grip of a moral panic,\u201d said John Horgan, a professor of global studies and psychology at Georgia State University who specializes in the study of terrorism. \u201cThe constant threat perception of being vulnerable to mass violence has seeped into our collective consciousness. \u201d Sam Macon, 36, a documentary filmmaker who was at the Los Angeles airport on Sunday, said: \u201cPeople who were running had absolutely no idea why they were doing so. I don\u2019t think it takes a social scientist to understand that the general tenor of American society right now is that we\u2019re all wound up pretty tight. \u201d The recent   panics injured dozens of people, some of them seriously. Kokila Patel, 66, and her husband, Manu, 74, had just finished lunch at a Panera in the Crabtree Valley Mall in Raleigh on Aug. 13 when she heard a noise and turned to see panicked shoppers surging toward them. People had taken   sounds for gunshots, screamed, dived into stores and made a chaotic rush for the exits, paying little heed to what was in their way  \u2014   including the Patels. The crowd knocked the couple down and trampled Ms. Patel, breaking her right femur and leaving her to wait in searing pain for two hours until police officers in tactical gear arrived and helped carry her out of the mall on a plastic display table. Surgeons braced her shattered leg with a steel rod, plate and screws, but the pain is still intense. Ms. Patel, who usually travels to India for three months each year with her husband, remains homebound. \u201cPeople always think, \u2018A gunman, a gunman,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Patel, who with her husband was earlier interviewed by The News and Observer. \u201cPeople\u2019s mentality are changing. People are always being afraid. \u201d Mr. Patel said he could see fear on the faces of the people who rushed over him and his wife. \u201cThey thought that somebody\u2019s there to kill them,\u201d he said. \u201cPsychologically, we have been damaged. \u201d Social media feeds that kind of frenzy, said Roxane Cohen Silver, a professor of psychology and social behavior at the University of California, Irvine. \u201cThere\u2019s rapid dissemination of information on social media that\u2019s not being filtered by anybody,\u201d she said. \u201cThis provides the unfortunate opportunity for rumors to be transmitted very quickly, without any ability to evaluate the veracity. \u201d Before there were television news reports about what was happening at the Los Angeles airport, she said, her son in Chicago had called to tell her, \u201cI\u2019m watching Twitter videos of people running at LAX. \u201d At the Florida Mall in Orlando, popping balloons were apparently mistaken for gunshots. At the Twelve Oaks Mall in Novi, Mich. it was a glass door toppling to the floor, knocked over by thieves who had smashed a glass display case in a jewelry store to grab two luxury watches. As the robbers ran, so did shoppers, and people posted videos of the chaotic scene on social media and said  \u2014   falsely  \u2014   that shots had been fired. That message spread fast, and calls to the Novi police overwhelmed the 911 system, shunting overflow callers to the state police. \u201cIt\u2019s a wildfire you try to control,\u201d said Detective Sgt. Scott Baetens of the Novi Police Department. \u201cWe try to put out timely and accurate information. But you can\u2019t put it out fast enough to beat Twitter and Facebook. \u201d Once people start to flee, it is fairly normal for others to join in, experts say  \u2014   even people who did not hear any suspicious sounds or rumors of terrorism. But people who study crowd psychology and the fear of terrorism say the steady stream of news reports of bloodshed has heightened anxieties out of proportion to the threat, making panic more likely to take hold. \u201cThis overexposure can cause increased fear, anxiety and helplessness, particularly in already psychologically vulnerable populations,\u201d said Daniel Antonius, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University at Buffalo. He described \u201ca national anxiety\u201d about mass attacks that did not reflect the real level of danger. Dr. Horgan stressed that in addition to physical violence, \u201cterrorism is fundamentally a form of psychological warfare, and it\u2019s one of the greatest ironies that we help give it its strength in our reactions to it. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562340.5413022}
