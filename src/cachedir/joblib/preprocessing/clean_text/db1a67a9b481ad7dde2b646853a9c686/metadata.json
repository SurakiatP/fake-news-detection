[The FBI arrested Juan Thompson in St. Louis on Friday, and he\u2019s due to appear in court in Manhattan. Thompson\u2019s arrest is the first since Jewish community centers and schools were targeted for threats and harassment across the country.  \u201cTogether with the FBI and the NYPD, we have been investigating the recent threats made on Jewish Community Centers in New York and around the country,\u201d said U. S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement. \u201cToday, we have charged Juan Thompson with allegedly stalking a former romantic interest by, among other things, making bomb threats in her name to Jewish Community Centers and to the   League. \u201d \u201cThompson\u2019s alleged pattern of harassment not only involved the defamation of his female victim, but his threats intimidated an entire community,\u201d added FBI Assistant    William F. Sweeney Jr. in the statement. This isn\u2019t the first time Thompson has appeared in headlines. Last February, The Intercept revealed he fabricated sources in stories and made up quotes out of whole cloth. When confronted about this egregious breach of journalistic standards, he blamed racism and \u201ctesticular cancer\u201d in a letter sent to the Intercept\u2019s    and the   Gawker. \u201cI\u2019ve been undergoing radiation treatment for testicular cancer and, since I no longer have health insurance, I\u2019ve been feverishly struggling and figuring out how to pay for my treatment. All of this, of course, has taken up my time and energy except for the few moments I\u2019ve spent searching for some relief,\u201d Thompson said, adding: \u201cI lack access to my notebooks (which I took for most stories) to address these matters. \u201d \u201cI had a habit of writing drafts of stories, placing the names of ppl I wanted to get quotes from in there, and then going to fetch the quotes,\u201d he continued in his letter. \u201cWas it sloppy? Yes? But I\u2019m a cub reporter and expected a sustained and competent editor to guide me, something which I never had at your company and something with which The Intercept continues to struggle as everyone in this business knows. \u201d Thompson blamed the \u201cGreat Problem\u201d of \u201cwhite media organizations\u201d for failing to understand his approach to journalism: If I couldn\u2019t obtain a quote from the person I wanted, I went somewhere else, and must\u2019ve forgot to change the names \u2014  clearly. Also, yes I encouraged some of my interviewees to use another name they\u2019re poor black people who didn\u2019t want their names in the public given the situations and that was the only was of convincing them otherwise. That also explains why some of them didn\u2019t want to talk with your company\u2019s research team or denied the events. These weren\u2019t articles in Harpers or The Nation. Instead, these are the lives of people forgotten by society and their being in public and talking to white, NY people, no less, could harm and turn them off. They\u2019ve lost loved ones to violence you and others couldn\u2019t possibly imagine. Ultimately, the journalism that covers the experiences of poor black folk and the journalism others, such as you and First Look, are used to differs drastically. This dilemma is the Great Problem with the white media organizations that dominate our media landscape. As   Coates wrote: \u201cThe standard [white] progressive approach of the moment is to mix   moral invective with   public policy. \u201d Such an approach ignores the differences in the way we must navigate these various fields: including journalism. The Intercept published an apology after discovering three of Thompson\u2019s fake news reporting while he worked from November 2014 to January 2016 for them. \u201cThompson went to great lengths to deceive his editors, creating an email account to impersonate a source and lying about his reporting methods,\u201d the letter said. In one fake news story that went viral, Thompson made up a fictional source called \u201cScott Roof,\u201d a   cousin of   Dylann Roof\u2019s, who claimed Roof slaughtered nine black parishioners after \u201che kind of went over the edge when a girl he liked starting dating a black guy two years back. \u201d Thompson\u2019s Twitter account also reveals he supported socialist Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders for president. \u201cI voted for Bernie Sanders, but his supporters are annoying as fuck. \u2018I almost cried when I got a Bernie sign\u2019. Yuck,\u201d he tweeted in July. This puts Sanders in an awkward position. Only days before Thompson\u2019s arrest, he told J Street: \u201cI hope very much that President Trump and his political adviser Mr. Bannon understand that the entire world is watching, that it is imperative that their voices be loud and clear in condemning  . \u201d Thompson posted many harassing messages about his  . \u201cTwo wks ago it was a visit from the FBI. Right now the Secret Service. This racist white garbage [omitted] is trash,\u201d read one tweet. \u201c. @SecretService [My  ] has made death threats against Trump. And talked about how she wanted to kill him and his kids. Look at her,\u201d Thompson continued on Twitter, before tweeting at Secret Service that she made threats against the president. \u201c. @SecretService [Omitted] a disgusting nasty racist white woman, who filed a false lie against me, has threatened to kill Trump. \u201d \u201cThe @SecretService visited me looked at my tweets, questioned my politics   some awful white woman I date reported me. I won\u2019t be silenced,\u201d he continued. \u201cY\u2019all know how to get a social worker in NY barred? I\u2019m being stalked and harassed by a white nasty white woman  \u2026     in NYC. \u201d Thompson also pinned a tweet with a   rant against the victim, adding: \u201cKnow any good lawyers? Need to stop this   #whitegirl I dated who sent a bomb threat in my name  wants me to be raped in jail. \u201d The Twitter account was verified as Thompson\u2019s by the U. S. Attorney\u2019s Office in New York.'"}, "time": 1742562273.8218029}
