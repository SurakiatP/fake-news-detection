Todd told host Hugh Hewitt that he didn\u2019t view O\u2019Reilly as a traditional conservative and was more an entertainer than the rest of his Fox News Channel colleagues. Partial transcript as follows (courtesy HughHewitt. com): HEWITT: Bill O\u2019Reilly is gone. And I have been having an argument online today with our friend, Lachlan Markay at the Daily Beast, and Chris Cillizza. I have never considered Bill a conservative. I thought he was an entertainer, bombastic and loud, and there was a reason that President Obama would much rather be interviewed by Bill O\u2019Reilly than Chuck Todd. He was never going to take you deep and focused. What do you, where do you put him on the spectrum of people who do what we do? TODD: Look, I agree with you. He was not sort of a traditional conservative. He was, to me, he gave voice, what he did, he was the tone setter. He was sort of that   correctness. That was, if he had a true north, that was it, right? HEWITT: Yup. TODD: If there was some way he could do that story, and if he could do that every night, right, he would find a way to do some form of that every night. But what he was, was the you know, it\u2019s like he was the opening act that brought the crowds, but he became almost more fun to watch than the concert itself, sometimes. HEWITT: Yeah. TODD: But he was the entertainer, probably more entertainer than any of the others, right? And anybody else in this ecosystem is, I mean, he said it in his own statement. I thought it was incredibly   that he said informed and entertained. He used the word entertained. HEWITT: Yeah. TODD: No real journalist would use that. HEWITT: Yeah, yeah. TODD: Okay, and that\u2019s fine. I admire the   at least by saying that. But, so but he set a tone, and I think so while he was never, you cannot take an issue and say Bill O\u2019Reilly championed that issue beyond the war, the phony war on Christmas, right? That was like a fun, that was an entertainment thing for him. But you couldn\u2019t say championed one issue or one cause or thing like that. But what was thought, what would the conservative media ecosystem be without him? HEWITT: Well, he brought people to Fox. He built the mall, right? He built the mall, and the mall has Sean Hannity in it, who like me is a partisan. TODD: Yeah. HEWITT: But he was an anchor store in a mall, but he was not selling conservative goods. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve always said. I\u2019ve got to ask you about, though, the other thing. And I\u2019m, I don\u2019t, allegations are allegations. There are a lot of them about it. I just point out I\u2019ve been doing this since \u201989. I\u2019ve never had one allegation against me. And last time I was on your set, I\u2019m sitting next to Tom Brokaw, who\u2019s been doing this a lot longer than that, and there\u2019s never been one allegation against him. You know, it is a business in which it\u2019s possible to be professional and a gentleman without ever attracting these kinds of charges. TODD: It is. And the fact of the matter is, look, here\u2019s my understanding of what happened. The board of directors at 21st Century Fox said this is just bad for business. And I, the culture is bad for business. HEWITT: Yeah. TODD: Obviously, advertisers are speaking. What are you doing? You\u2019re paying all this money. And look, you cannot help but connect O\u2019Reilly to Ailes and say there had to be a culture of look the other way if the guy approving settlements was also accused. So you know, it really underscores this idea that this stuff happens when you create a culture of tolerance for it. HEWITT: Yeah, workplace dynamic matters. I will say this as an NBC guy now, if they put Tucker Carlson in there, and they give Dana that hour, that\u2019s stiff winds for us, because they\u2019re both serious people and they\u2019re smart. And that\u2019s what we have to  \u2026     TODD: You know, I don\u2019t want to get into the lineup. I have, let\u2019s just say there\u2019s a lot of people who have a lot of theories about, I will say this. I think there has never been more, if you enjoy watching the cable news prime time game, I would just say this. There\u2019s never been more jump balls. HEWITT: Exactly. TODD: The big guy, the big guy on the block looks more vulnerable than ever. Golden State, they look like, you know, it\u2019s like Golden State without Kevin Durant. It looks pretty beatable. HEWITT: Wait a minute. You\u2019re talking about the Cavaliers without LeBron, Chuck. TODD: Oh, sorry. That\u2019s right. I\u2019m sorry.
