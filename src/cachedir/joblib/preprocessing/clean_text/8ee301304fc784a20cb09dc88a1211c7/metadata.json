Anonymous has even been around long enough, these days, that there is actually a generational gap developing. Protesters wearing Anonymous Guy Fawkes masks take part in a demonstration against controversial Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), on February 25, 2012 in Nice, southeastern France. AFP PHOTO / VALERY HACHE\\nThink about it in this perspective: the Matrix is already 17 years old; there is an entire generation which didn\u2019t grow up with it!\\nThe oldest members are naturally the most die-hard \u2018Anons,\u2019 and the older the member, typically, the better the hacker \u2013 there are becoming fewer and fewer of them by the day. For the most part the oldest \u2018Anons\u2019 are of the mind that Anonymous should be an exclusive hacker collective \u2013 everyone who can\u2019t hack is largely considered a n00b or just a fan of the movement.\\nAnons protesting against the government\\nThe newest members of Anonymous tend to be social justice warriors of sorts; almost none of them are hackers, but they make up the large majority of people who now call themselves \u201cAnonymous.\u201d They are, for the large part, protestors, civil rights/liberties advocates or people who want to change the world, but are unsure on how to go about it. They seem to be drawn to Anonymous, not because all of the hacks occurring around the world, but because they see Anonymous publicly advocating for many of the same things they believe in.\\nThere are a lot of things happening in this world that people do not get to vote on, or simply have no say over; there are a lot of things that tend to control/dictate peoples\u2019 lives, for which they have no control over.\\nI remember a conversation last year with a friend in the movement. I was frustrated because all I want is to change and make an impact on the world, but always feel like nothing more than an ant \u2013 nothing I seem to do is even measurable in the grand scheme of life.\\nThey responded, \u201cWelcome to the anthill.\u201d\\nJust as with any group of people in the world, or in politics, there are bound to be some fringe lunatics/extremists on both sides of the spectrum \u2013 and Anonymous is no different.\\nPeople do not seem to understand that no one in Anonymous speaks for anyone else in Anonymous. Far too often, people in Anonymous are left defending \u2013 or accused \u2013 for the actions of other people they know nothing about. People also do not seem to understand what it means when some says \u201cAnonymous is an idea, not a group.\u201d\\nWhat it means to be part of an \u201cidea\u201d can also differ depending on the purpose. But what I have come to believe this \u201cidea\u201d means is a freedom of expression in its purest form: Freedom from censorship; freedom for ALL knowledge to be free and available to the public/society; freedom for people to stand up and fight for whatever they believe in; freedom for everyone\u2019s voice to matter \u2013 not just corporations/politicians/government elites.'"}, "time": 1742561993.419366}
