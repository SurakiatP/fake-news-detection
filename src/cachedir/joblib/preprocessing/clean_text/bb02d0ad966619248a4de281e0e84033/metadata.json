[There is little room for doubt about what happened in Montana: there were multiple eyewitnesses, and Gianforte was charged with assault that day. If Gianforte loses Thursday\u2019s special election in Montana, he will deserve to lose it.  At the same time, nothing justifies the mainstream media\u2019s effort to blame President Donald Trump for what happened. And the media\u2019s hypocrisy is evident in their failure to blame President Barack Obama when Democrats used violence in similar cases. The most relevant example is the case of former Rep. Bob Etheridge ( ) who assaulted a student (see photo above) who was filming him on a public street in 2010 and asking him if he \u201cfully support[ed] the Obama agenda. \u201d The incident was captured on film, and the story was broken by Breitbart News. Etheridge went on to lose his congressional race to Republican Ren\u00e9e Elmers (who was unseated last year). There was also a similar (though less severe) report in Montana itself in 2012, when a local Democrat was accused of slapping the phone out of the hands of a reporter asking questions. Today, Trump\u2019s critics are citing President Trump\u2019s claim that the media are the \u201cenemy of the people,\u201d among other statements, to claim that he has implicitly condoned Gianforte allegedly did. But when Andrew Breitbart pointed out that Obama\u2019s deputy chief of staff, Jim Messina, had told Democrats in 2009 to \u201cpunch back twice as hard,\u201d and connected that incendiary rhetoric to the beating of black vendor Kenneth Gladney by leftist thugs outside a Missouri town hall, the media were silent. They never tried blaming President Obama for Etheridge or any of the other incidents. It is not \u201cwhataboutism\u201d to compare these cases, because all can  \u2014   or should  \u2014   agree that candidates physically attacking journalists is indefensible. But the media can and must be expected to apply a uniform standard to politicians from both parties. Instead, today, the media are showing their true partisan colors by using the Gianforte incident to impugn Trump  \u2014   when they never did the same to Obama. The most ridiculous example was on CNN Wednesday night, when host Don Lemon badgered guest Paris Dennard, insisting that he blame Trump, snorting when he would not, and then attacking Dennard\u2019s bona fides: \u201cI can\u2019t believe that you believe the words that are coming out of your mouth. \u201d He cut Dennard off when he tried to reply. The double standard reveals that Trump\u2019s critics are not concerned  \u2014   at least, not primarily  \u2014   about press freedom. Arguably, their effort to blame Trump for what happened in Montana, when they gave Barack \u201cwe bring a gun\u201d Obama a perpetual pass, undermines efforts to convince the public to take attacks on journalists more seriously.
