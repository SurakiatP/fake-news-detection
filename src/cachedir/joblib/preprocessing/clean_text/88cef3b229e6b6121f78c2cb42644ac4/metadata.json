Ted Cruz ( ) weighed in on a legislation expected to be passed out of the House of Representatives that would repeal and replace the existing Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.  Cruz credited the House\u2019s Freedom Caucus for taking the lower chamber\u2019s first effort at taking on Obamacare and making it better this time. \u201cI\u2019m encouraged on Obamacare,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cThe House has been working diligently, and it looks like they\u2019ve reached an agreement. So, it appears that the votes are there to pass it out of the House today. I think that\u2019s a positive thing. What we\u2019ve seen between when it was first introduced and now, is the Freedom Caucus  \u2014   the strong conservatives in the House have been pressing really hard to improve this bill and to make it better. And what they\u2019ve been focusing on quite rightly is that we\u2019ve got to lower health insurance premiums. But, that\u2019s going to be the test of success or failure. Do premiums go up or do they go down? If we can lower premiums, it\u2019s a victory. \u201d Cruz was skeptical of the legislation\u2019s chances as it is of making it out of the Senate and said it was \u201cincumbent\u201d for the body to make the bill better. \u201c[I]f it passes today and comes over to the Senate, then it\u2019s going to be incumbent on us to work to make it even better,\u201d he said. \u201cGetting it out of the Senate is not going to be easy. Republicans have a very narrow   majority. Every Democrat is a no, so we start off with 48 nos. And with a   majority, it means we can lose at most two Republicans. Three Republicans go no, and the bill goes down. So that means we\u2019ve got to have a bill that can bring together a majority  \u2014   at least 50 of those 52. \u201d \u201cNow what I\u2019ve been doing, Trey, for over a month now, is I assembled a group of senators  \u2014   Republicans across the ideological spectrum  \u2014   and we have been meeting weekly, sitting down and trying to come to common ground, trying to come together and say \u2018Where do we all agree on how we repeal Obamacare and fix the underlying problem?\u201d he continued. \u201cWhat are consensus ideas?\u2019 And when there are disagreements, \u2018How can we reach a resolution that satisfies that core objectives of each?\u2019 And so we\u2019ve got the full ideological spectrum. We have people who are conservatives, we have people who are much more moderate, and we\u2019re sitting down  \u2014   now meeting twice a week to try to work through and come to agreement. It, frankly, is the process I think the House of Representatives should have started with, and they didn\u2019t. But we\u2019re going to try to do it in the Senate and I hope we can get it done. My view is failure is not an option. We\u2019ve been promising the voters we\u2019d repeal Obamacare for seven years, and I think if we fail to deliver on that I think the consequences would be catastrophic. \u201d Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor'"}, "time": 1742563600.5401974}
