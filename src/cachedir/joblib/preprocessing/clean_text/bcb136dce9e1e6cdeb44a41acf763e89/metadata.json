The scale of the victory in Uttar Pradesh\u2019s legislative elections was all the more stunning because it followed Mr. Modi\u2019s politically risky decision to eliminate most of India\u2019s cash. The vote was seen as a referendum on the prime minister, who campaigned vigorously in recent days in Uttar Pradesh, which, with a population of more than 200 million, would be the world\u2019s sixth largest country if it were independent. \u201cThis is a stupendous achievement,\u201d said Ashok Malik, a fellow with the Observer Research Foundation, based in New Delhi. \u201cHere you had a prime minister making himself the face of the election in the absence of a local leader and stitching together a coalition across the state. \u201d The margin of victory in Uttar Pradesh was the largest seen by any party in more than 30 years. It gives Mr. Modi a significant advantage in the national elections in 2019, which in turn would bring him closer to his   goal of becoming a leader of historic significance, steering India away from its more socialist, secular past. Mr. Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party, commonly called the B. J. P. also won at least one of four other state elections in which ballots were being counted on Saturday. The weakening India National Congress party, which once dominated the nation\u2019s politics, won in Punjab, a powerful farming state, and remained in contention in two smaller states, showing that it was still a factor nationally, though less so than in years past. The Aam Aadmi Party, born of the anticorruption movement that has arisen in India in recent years, failed to win any state, suggesting that it was not yet ready to take over from the Congress party as the main opposition to Mr. Modi. Mr. Modi said on Twitter that his party\u2019s victories were \u201chumbling and overwhelming. \u201d In Uttar Pradesh, the Election Commission of India said the Bharatiya Janata Party had won or was leading in voting for 308 of the 403 seats in the state legislature, decimating the     coalition cobbled together by Congress and the local governing party, the Samajwadi Party. By Saturday afternoon, that coalition had garnered only 57 seats. The coalition had appeared to be gaining steam after it was formed early this year, led by the dynamic, relatively young leader of the Samajwadi Party, Akhilesh Yadav, 43, whose father founded the party and presided over it for decades. That party and the Bahujan Samaj Party, commonly known as the B. S. P. have taken turns governing Uttar Pradesh in recent decades, in each case putting together coalitions that consisted mainly of the party leader\u2019s caste group along with Muslims. But on Saturday afternoon, the B. S. P. led by Kumari Mayawati, a leader of the Dalit caste, won or was leading in only 20 seats, the election commission said. The scale of the Bharatiya Janata Party\u2019s victory suggested that it had bridged such caste allegiances, some experts said, although it had yet to cross religious lines to attract large numbers of Muslims. While Mr. Modi has largely steered clear of divisive language on religion as prime minister, his party has a Hindu nationalist philosophy, and he was accused of complicity in   violence as the leader of his home state of Gujarat. \u201cThis is the beginning of a new chapter in the history of India,\u201d Jitendra Singh, a minister of state in Mr. Modi\u2019s office, told the television station Times Now. \u201cThe Indian voter has learned to rise above caste and creed and vote for development and the future of India. \u201d In fact, although Mr. Modi won the 2014 national elections on a platform of jobs and development, his economic record is mixed. He has lured more foreign investment and is close to achieving a   tax overhaul, but new job creation has been slow and domestic private investment remains stagnant. The International Monetary Fund this year cut its projected growth rate for India by one percentage point, to 6. 6 percent, in large part because of Mr. Modi\u2019s sudden ban on the country\u2019s largest currency notes in November. Saturday\u2019s results come less than four months after Mr. Modi\u2019s Nov. 8 announcement that India\u2019s largest notes, which made up 86 percent of the currency, would be banned starting the next day in a bid to fight corruption. A cash shortfall persisted for weeks as the government rushed to print enough new notes to replace the banned ones, slowing many of the country\u2019s   businesses and leaving many poor people struggling to make ends meet. As the cash crunch persisted, with millions waiting in line for notes, Mr. Modi faced criticism that his policy had hurt   people, and many predicted that voters would punish him at the polls. But his big win in Uttar Pradesh  \u2014   coupled with victory in another state, Uttarakhand, and gains in the eastern state of Manipur, where his party had not been a contender in the recent past  \u2014   suggests that despite the pain the currency ban caused, voters believed Mr. Modi when he said it was needed to reduce corruption, some experts said. \u201cThe narrative became less about whether it was right or wrong on economics, but more about the political narrative, the way Modi was able to shape it,\u201d said Harsh Pant, a professor of international relations specializing in India at King\u2019s College in London. \u201cHe said, \u2018I am a crusader against corruption, and you have to rise above your mundane economic realities and support me.\u2019 And people did,\u201d Mr. Pant said. Votes were still being counted in the smaller states of Goa and Manipur on Saturday afternoon, and the margins were so close that it was not clear who would form the state governments. Experts said Mr. Modi\u2019s win in Uttar Pradesh meant his party would be able to take control of the upper house of India\u2019s Parliament next year. They expected him to have a freer hand in making the economic policy overhauls that he has long sought to spur development, including changes in the law to make it easier for companies to acquire farmland and to fire workers. But many experts cautioned that it was unlikely Mr. Modi would make major changes before the 2019 election. When he previously tried to ease land acquisition rules, he found himself pilloried as the \u201csuit boot\u201d prime minister, or guardian of the corporate class, the experts noted. \u201cHe\u2019ll have the space, but he\u2019ll also be concerned about \u201d Mr. Malik said. The prime minister may tinker with the laws, perhaps allowing states to change some labor laws to attract industry, but \u201che\u2019s not suddenly going to shift gears in terms of policies,\u201d Mr. Malik said.'"}, "time": 1742563870.4974895}
