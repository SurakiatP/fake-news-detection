West told the audience at a concert in San Jose, California on Thursday night that he didn\u2019t vote in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential elections \u201cbut if I would have voted, I would have voted for Trump.\u201d \\n\u201cThis is my platform and I\u2019m going to talk about the paradigm shift that\u2019s happening right now,\u201d he said at the top of a 40-minute political speech that came at the cost of several songs. \\nIt\u2019s hard to ascertain exactly the point he was trying to make as we only have tweets and videos from attendees, not a transcript, to go off, but it sounds as though he was mostly praising the disruptive nature of Trump\u2019s campaign, which \u2018inspired racists to reveal themselves\u2019. \u201cI would\u2019ve voted for Trump\u201d\u2013 @kanyewest pic.twitter.com/XtyUteCgUZ \\n\u2014 albertoreyes (@albertoreyes) November 18, 2016 \\n\\n\u201cWhether you voted for Hillary or Trump, this is a safe space for both of you,\u201d he told the audience, asking any Trump voters to make themselves known. He also reiterated his desire to run for president in 2020, saying his focus would be on education and that his campaign would use a different political model. \\n\u201cStop focusing on racism,\u201d he added, declaring sombrely: \u201cWe are in a racist country \u2013 period.\u201d His stance stands in stark contrast to 2005 Kanye, who famously declared that \u201cGeorge Bush doesn\u2019t care about black people\u201d in the wake of the devestating Hurricane Katrina. \\nThe concert received an understandably mixed response. \\nKanye was apparently happy when one woman screamed that she loved him in spite of his appreciation of Trump\u2019s campaign, but there was also a lot of booing, stunned silence and even a few projectiles \u2013 one of which was a Yeezy shoe, which Kanye promptly signed and returned to the thrower.
