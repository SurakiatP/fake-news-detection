But if you order butter, is margarine or a vegetable spread an acceptable substitute? It wasn\u2019t to Jan Polanik, who sued 23 Dunkin\u2019 Donuts locations in Massachusetts for serving him \u201cmargarine or a butter substitute\u201d instead of butter with his bagels between June 2012 and June 2016. He filed a pair of   lawsuits in March against franchise owners who are responsible for multiple stores. He paid 25 cents for butter and was not told a substitute was used, according to the suits. If settlement agreements filed on Monday are approved, up to 1, 400 people may claim up to three free buttered muffins, bagels or other baked goods from the 23 locations in Grafton, Leominster, Lowell, Millbury, Shrewsbury, Westborough and Worcester. Customers would not need to show a receipt of a previous purchase. The stores will be required to use only butter  \u2014   no margarine or butter substitute  \u2014   for a year. If they use butter substitutes in the future, the menus will have to explicitly say so. Mr. Polanik, who lives in the Worcester area, will receive $500 as an \u201cincentive award\u201d for representing the class. Thomas G. Shapiro, a lawyer who represented Mr. Polanik, said it was unclear what each of the restaurants used in lieu of butter, but one of the stores had \u201ca large tub that looked a lot like a tub of Country Crock, a very inexpensive spread that is sold in grocery stores. \u201d \u201cThe main thrust of the case, really, is to get the stores, and hopefully Dunkin\u2019 Donuts generally, to change that practice and not deceive people,\u201d he said on Monday. Dunkin\u2019 Donuts said in a statement that it was aware of the lawsuit but did not address any companywide butter policies. \u201cThe majority of Dunkin\u2019 Donuts restaurants in Massachusetts carry both individual whipped butter packets and a   vegetable spread,\u201d the company said in a statement. To culinary partisans, the    question, which The New York Times called a \u201c  debate\u201d  in a 1974 article, rubs up against    as among the most contentious dividers of our time. Based on either health concerns or personal taste, preferences run deep. Take Wisconsin. It would be wise for you to not mess with Wisconsin\u2019s butter. There,   laws crack down on   margarine hawkers. An unannounced    swap at a restaurant is expressly forbidden, punishable by a fine of up to $500 and three months in prison for the first offense, and as much as $1, 000 and a year in prison for subsequent offenses. Margarine cannot be served to students, patients or inmates in state facilities. Even the   butter selection is limited. Kerrygold, an Irish brand, cannot be sold in Wisconsin grocery stores because it has not been graded for quality by state or federal authorities, causing some butter bandits to carry bricks over state lines. A group of residents filed a lawsuit in March challenging the    law. Tom Balmer, a spokesman for the American Butter Institute, said he was unaware of other states with butter laws. But dairy products of all stripes face competition from \u201cimitators attempting to capitalize on dairy\u2019s excellent reputation for delivering flavor, wholesomeness and nutrition,\u201d he said. \u201cOur friends in the milk, cheese, yogurt and ice cream industries are currently waging their own battles with substitutes which are frequently inferior in terms of taste, performance and (especially) nutrition,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cAs a result, we can foresee similar issues arising, particularly in the food service sector, if labeling and product identity messaging are less than clear. \u201d History is replete with scientific   on which is healthier. Butter is high in cholesterol and saturated fat, which are linked to heart disease. Margarine contains unsaturated fat, but some varieties contain trans fats, which are also dangerous. Nutritionists suggest closely inspecting the label of your brand. \u201cYour goal is to limit intake of saturated fats and to avoid trans fats altogether,\u201d according to Harvard Medical School. \u201cLook for a spread that doesn\u2019t have trans fats and has the least amount of saturated fat,\u201d according to the Mayo Clinic. In 2013, a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts spokeswoman, Lindsay Harrington, offered an explanation for why a vegetable spread might be used. \u201cFor food safety reasons, we do not allow butter to be stored at room temperature, which is the temperature necessary for butter to be easily spread onto a bagel or pastry,\u201d she told The Boston Globe. The recommended procedure in the store, she said, was for individual whipped butter packets to be served on the side of a bagel or pastry, but not applied. \u201cThe vegetable spread is generally used if the employee applies the topping,\u201d she said. Such explanations were insufficient for Mr. Polanik. \u201cIt\u2019s the basic principle that if something is misrepresented to you, it should be corrected,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. \u201cHe really just prefers butter for a number of reasons. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628374.1768377}
