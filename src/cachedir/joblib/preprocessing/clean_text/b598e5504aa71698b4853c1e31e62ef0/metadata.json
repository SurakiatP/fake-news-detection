Mr. Koehler said that recent Russian cyberattacks on WADA made it difficult to trust the country, as did Russia\u2019s refusal to admit to   doping after WADA published an investigative report in July that invoked forensic proof of violations. Russia\u2019s national antidoping agency and laboratory remain decertified as a result of the investigation, and its track and field athletes are still barred from international competition. Mr. Koehler also said that the Russian authorities had locked down the Moscow lab\u2019s storage facilities, hindering global investigators\u2019 progress in analyzing doping samples. \u201cTo cross the line is a criminal offense,\u201d Mr. Koehler said of the security perimeter, requesting that it be lifted. Sunday\u2019s meetings focused on the future, not just for Russia but also for the antidoping agency itself, which has faced criticism that it was slow to pursue tips from Russian   for years. With momentum from a coordinated group of national governments that help fund WADA, the agency is now seeking a stronger role in unearthing antidoping violations and imposing discipline in response rather than deferring to sports organizations like the International Olympic Committee, which have financial interests in competitions. \u201cIt sounds like a very intriguing spy novel, the things this organization has to deal with recently,\u201d said Edwin Moses, the American Olympic hurdler, who is on the WADA board. Minutes after Mr. Koehler\u2019s report on the continuing obstacles in Russia, President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s antidoping appointee, Vitaly Smirnov, denied that the government had taken part in the elaborate cheating scheme that was detailed in the WADA report in July, weeks before the Rio de Janeiro Olympics. That report, which prompted WADA to urge the I. O. C. to bar Russia from the Rio Games, said that Russia\u2019s internal intelligence service had helped breach doping controls at the 2014 Sochi Olympics. The report also said that Russia\u2019s deputy sports minister had played a critical role in the effort to cover up doping. Mr. Smirnov, an    former Soviet sports official, said that the deputy sports minister, Yuri D. Nagornykh, had been fired and had never represented the government. \u201cIf a certain person is a criminal doesn\u2019t mean the whole country is,\u201d he said. Vitaly Mutko, a former sports minister for Russia who was recently promoted to deputy prime minister, was accused in the WADA report  \u2014   written by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren  \u2014   of being complicit in athletic cheating. Mr. Koehler expressed frustration that Mr. Mutko had suggested that the McLaren report was fabricated and that people associated with creating it could be prosecuted. Mr. McLaren has continued his inquiry into which Russian athletes benefited from the state system he detailed in July. The results are expected on Dec. 9, WADA said Sunday. At WADA\u2019s last board meeting, in May, the agency detailed the challenges that   professionals had encountered in collecting doping samples in Russia, including athletes\u2019 smuggling clean urine, offering bribes and climbing out of windows to escape when testers arrived at their doors. The difficulties have continued in recent months, Mr. Koehler said, noting that although there had been no reports of the most brazen behavior, people had been nonetheless uncooperative with the relatively few   officials dispatched to cover the whole country. The number of drug tests conducted in Russia this year amounts to about 10 percent of the usual total. That percentage represents about 1, 660 tests throughout the country, including hundreds of failed attempts to track down athletes at specified locations. Still, WADA\u2019s president, Craig Reedie, called the current situation \u201ca lot better than it was\u201d a few months ago and said that he was eager to restore the country to good standing. \u201cThey are the biggest country in the world, a very enthusiastic sporting country,\u201d Reedie said, though some have suggested that breaches such as those that happened at the Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, may warrant further sanctions at the 2018 Winter Olympics. \u201cNot only do they want to take part in competition, but they want to host them. \u201d It can be expensive and logistically burdensome to host major athletic events, and Russian cities regularly welcome numerous major competitions. The International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation is set to hold the sports\u2019 world championships in Sochi early next year. At Sunday\u2019s public meeting and in private meetings in preceding days, officials in Glasgow discussed WADA\u2019s own plans for overhaul, outlining a framework for strengthening the agency\u2019s investigative powers with six employees dedicated to intelligence work. The board approved a policy to protect   as well as a proposal to empower WADA to discipline sports organizations and national delegations of athletes. G\u00fcnter Younger, WADA\u2019s new investigative chief and a former employee of the German criminal police and Interpol, emphasized that his work would be walled off within WADA and called   the backbone of his operations. \u201cEveryone is picking on Russia,\u201d said Mr. Younger, who in 2015 took part in the first   inquiry into doping there. He said that Russian   had inspired reforms in the first place, adding, \u201cIt was Russians who took down this system. \u201d Mr. Younger said that other informants might be more willing to come forward if they knew WADA could then mete out punishments to doping violators, as it is now seeking to do. \u201cYou need power,\u201d Mr. Younger said. \u201cIf you\u2019re an advisory body, you come at me with a feather  \u2014   if there\u2019s no punishment, why should I talk to you?\u201d How exactly to assign WADA such authority, and when that authority might take effect, is unclear. It could be achieved through amendments to the global antidoping code, which would be voted on by board members at a future meeting. The I. O. C. is a signatory to that code, and it is unclear if the organization would challenge such a change. Mr. Reedie, whose longstanding ties to the I. O. C. have raised    concerns in the past, was   to the WADA presidency on Sunday in an uncontested vote. Last summer, he told The New York Times that WADA was better suited to give advice than to play an active regulatory role. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to turn to people and say, \u2018These are the rules obey them,\u2019\u201d he said in June. He said on Sunday that he regretted those words and that his outlook had evolved. \u201cPeople pretty much thought WADA was a service provider,\u201d he said of the agency\u2019s   history. \u201cI think as this whole business develops, now we may have a little more effective authority. \u201d Richard W. Pound, the founding president of WADA and a former I. O. C. executive, praised the prospect of WADA growing into a fiercer watchdog. \u201cIt\u2019s a unique opportunity to make that step,\u201d he said, \u201cto go from cheerleader to regulator. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562029.3466597}
