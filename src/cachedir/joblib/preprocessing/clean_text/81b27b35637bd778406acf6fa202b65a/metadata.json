[Trump\u2019s United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley suggested that U. S.  regime change in Syria is likely.  \u201cRegime change is something that we think is going to happen, because all of the parties are going to see that Assad\u2019s not the leader that needs to be taking place for Syria,\u201d Haley told CNN. Some analysts and American lawmakers accused the Trump administration of sending mixed messages on its Syria policy, noting that while Haley indicated that getting rid of Assad is the administration\u2019s priority, U. S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson maintained that the U. S. is focused on defeating ISIS. In separate interviews on Sunday, Tillerson and Trump\u2019s national security adviser H. R. McMaster noted that the administration\u2019s decision to bomb Assad last week is not a sign that America has shifted its primary focus from defeating ISIS to pushing the Syrian dictator from power. \u201cOur priority is first the defeat of ISIS,\u201d Tillerson told George Stephanopoulos, host of ABC News\u2019s This Week on Sunday. \u201cOnce we can eliminate the battle against ISIS, conclude that \u2014  and it is going quite well \u2014  then we hope to turn our attention to   agreements between the regime and opposition forces. \u201d Lt. Gen. McMaster agreed that defeating ISIS must come \u201cfirst,\u201d adding, \u201cThen also, it has to be a significant change in the nature of the Assad regime and its behavior in particular. \u201d Asked about the alleged \u201cmixed signals\u201d on Trump\u2019s Syria policy sent by Haley and the Tillerson, Lt. Gen. McMaster also told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d host, Chris Wallace: Both Secretary Tillerson and Ambassador Haley are right about this. What we really need to do, and what everyone who\u2019s involved in this conflict needs to do is to do everything they can to resolve this civil war, to halt this humanitarian catastrophe, this political catastrophe, not only in Syria, but the catastrophe is affecting the greater Middle East, it\u2019s affecting Europe and it\u2019s a threat to the American people as well. And so, to do that, what\u2019s required is some kind of a political solution to that very complex problem  \u2026     we are not saying that we are the ones who are going to affect that change. Last week, President Trump ordered the U. S. military to strike an Assad base in northwestern Syria believed to have been housing the pilots who carried out a chemical weapons attack last Tuesday that killed as many as 100 people, including at least 27 children. Citing a senior U. S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity, the Associated Press (AP) reports that Russia knew of last week\u2019s chemical weapons assault in advance. \u201cRussia\u2019s got to tell us which one it is. Either they knew that there were chemical weapons and they knew there was going to be   use and they just hid it from the international community, or they\u2019re being played for fools by Assad by him having chemical weapons and they\u2019re just in the dark and they don\u2019t know anything about it,\u201d declared Haley. Support from Iran and Russia has kept Assad in power.   fighters, including members of the terrorist group Hezbollah, and Russian military forces are fighting alongside Assad troops.'"}, "time": 1742562187.7126658}
