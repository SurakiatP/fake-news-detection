They have been taken to a migrant center at Sacred Heart Catholic Church where they were released by Border Patrol, with ankle monitors, while they file for asylum. \\nAgent Chris Cabrera told CBS News that they\u2019ve been seeing a spike in immigrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally, thanks in part to the election. \\n\u201cThe smugglers are telling them if Hillary [Clinton] gets elected, that there\u2019ll be some sort of amnesty, that they need to get here by a certain date,\u201d Cabrera said. \u201cThey\u2019re also being told that if [Donald] Trump gets elected, there\u2019s going to be some magical wall that pops up overnight and once that wall gets up, nobody will ever get in again.\u201d \\nCabrera added that they\u2019ve encountered up to 1,000 immigrants along McAllen\u2019s stretch of the border some days.'"}, "time": 1742561816.189419}
