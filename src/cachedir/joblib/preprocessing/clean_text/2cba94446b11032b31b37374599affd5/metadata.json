A. to reopen overseas \u201cblack site\u201d prisons, like those where it detained and tortured terrorism suspects before former President Barack Obama shut them down. President Trump\u2019s   draft order, titled \u201cDetention and Interrogation of Enemy Combatants\u201d and obtained by The New York Times, would also undo many of the other restrictions on handling detainees that Mr. Obama put in place in response to policies of the George W. Bush administration. If Mr. Trump signs the draft order, he would also revoke Mr. Obama\u2019s directive to give the International Committee of the Red Cross access to all detainees in American custody. That would be another step toward reopening secret prisons outside of the normal wartime rules established by the Geneva Conventions, although statutory obstacles would remain. Mr. Obama tried to close the prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, and refused to send new detainees there, but the draft order directs the Pentagon to continue using the site \u201cfor the detention and trial of newly captured\u201d detainees  \u2014   including not just more people suspected of being members of Al Qaeda or the Taliban, like the 41 remaining detainees, but also Islamic State detainees. It does not address legal problems that might raise. The draft order does not direct any immediate reopening of C. I. A. prisons or revival of torture tactics, which are now banned by statute. But it sets up   policy reviews to make further recommendations in both areas to Mr. Trump, who vowed during the campaign to bring back waterboarding and a \u201chell of a lot worse\u201d  \u2014   not only because \u201ctorture works,\u201d but because even \u201cif it doesn\u2019t work, they deserve it anyway. \u201d Elisa Massimino, the director of Human Rights First, denounced the draft order as \u201cflirting with a return to the \u2018enhanced interrogation program\u2019 and the environment that gave rise to it. \u201d She noted that numerous retired military leaders have rejected torture as \u201cillegal, immoral and damaging to national security,\u201d and she said that many of Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet nominees had seemed to share that view in their confirmation testimony. \u201cIt would be surprising and extremely troubling if the national security cabinet officials were to acquiesce in an order like that after the assurances that they gave in their confirmation hearings,\u201d she said. A White House spokesman did not immediately respond to an email inquiring about the draft order, including when Mr. Trump may intend to sign it. But the order was accompanied by a   statement that criticized the Obama administration for having \u201crefrained from exercising certain authorities\u201d about detainees it said were critical to defending the country from \u201cradical Islamism. \u201d Specifically, the draft order would revoke two executive orders about detainees that Mr. Obama issued in January 2009, shortly after his inauguration. One was Mr. Obama\u2019s directive to close the Guant\u00e1namo prison and the other was his directive to end C. I. A. prisons, grant Red Cross access to all detainees and limit interrogators to the Army Field Manual techniques. In their place, Mr. Trump\u2019s draft order would resurrect a 2007 executive order issued by President Bush. It responded to a 2006 Supreme Court ruling about the Geneva Conventions that had put C. I. A. interrogators at risk of prosecution for war crimes, leading to a temporary halt of the agency\u2019s \u201cenhanced\u201d interrogations program. Mr. Bush\u2019s 2007 order enabled the agency to resume a form of the program by specifically listing what sorts of prisoner abuses counted as war crimes. That made it safe for interrogators to use other tactics, like extended sleep deprivation, that were not on the list. Mr. Obama revoked that order as part of his 2009 overhaul of detention legal policy. One of the Obama orders Mr. Trump\u2019s draft order would revoke also limited interrogators to using techniques listed in the Army Field Manual. But in 2015, Congress enacted a statute locking down that rule as a matter of law, as well as a requirement to let the Red Cross visit detainees. Those limits would remain in place for the time being. Still, the draft order says   Trump administration officials should conduct several reviews and make recommendations to Mr. Trump. One was whether to change the field manual, to the extent permitted by law. Another was \u201cwhether to reinitiate a program of interrogation of   alien terrorists to be operated outside the United States\u201d by the C. I. A. including any \u201clegislative proposals\u201d necessary to permit the resumption of such a program. It was not clear whether the C. I. A. would be enthusiastic about resuming a role in detaining and interrogating terrorism suspects after its scorching experience over the past decade. In written answers to questions by the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mr. Trump\u2019s C. I. A. director, Mike Pompeo, said he would review whether a rewrite of the field manual was needed and left the door open to seeking a change in the law \u201cif experts believed current law was an impediment to gathering vital intelligence to protect the country. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s order says no detainee should be tortured or otherwise subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment \u201cas prescribed by U. S. law,\u201d but it makes no mention of international law commitments binding the United States to adhere to humane standards even if Congress were to relax domestic legal limits on interrogations, such as the Convention Against Torture or the Geneva Conventions. Another core national security legal principle for Mr. Obama was to use civilian courts, not military commissions, whenever possible in terrorism cases  \u2014   and to exclusively use civilian law enforcement agencies and procedures, not the military, to handle cases arising on domestic soil. The draft order also signals that the Trump administration may shift that approach as well. In 2012, after Congress enacted a statute mandating that the military initially take custody of all foreign Qaeda suspects, Mr. Obama issued a directive that   waived that rule for most domestic circumstances, such as if the F. B. I. had arrested the suspect and was already in the process of an interrogation. But Mr. Trump\u2019s draft order calls for the attorney general, in consultation with other   officials, to review that directive and recommend modifications to it within 120 days. Many Republicans  \u2014   including Senator Jeff Sessions, Mr. Trump\u2019s attorney general nominee  \u2014   criticized the Obama administration\u2019s approach as weak, even though the civilian court system has regularly convicted terrorists at trial while the military commissions system has proved to be dysfunctional. During the campaign, Mr. Trump said he would prefer to prosecute terrorism suspects at Guant\u00e1namo  \u2014   including American citizens, although the law currently limits the commissions system to foreign defendants. Against that backdrop, Mr. Trump\u2019s draft order would direct Defense Secretary James N. Mattis, along with the attorney general and the director of national intelligence, to \u201creview the military commissions system and recommend to the president how best to employ the system going forward to provide for the swift and just trial and punishment of unlawful enemy combatants detained in the armed conflict with violent Islamist extremists. \u201d Tom Malinowski, who was assistant secretary of state for human rights in the Obama administration, said the draft order showed that everyone who thought the office of the presidency or the advice of cabinet secretaries like Mr. Mattis would temper Mr. Trump \u201cis being shown wrong again. \u201d \u201cHe\u2019ll listen to his worst instincts over his best advisers unless restrained by law,\u201d Mr. Malinowski said.'"}, "time": 1742561728.0734327}
