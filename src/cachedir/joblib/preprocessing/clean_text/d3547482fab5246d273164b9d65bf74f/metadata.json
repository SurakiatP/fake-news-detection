According to Reuters , thousands of troops are expected to arrive in the coming days and weeks. \\nIt was reported that Italy, France, Denmark and other European states are expected to join the NATO military divisions that will be led by the United States along Russia\u2019s border. \\nOn Wednesday, Britain announced it is sending hundreds of soldiers and hardware to Russia\u2019s borders as part of a huge military deployment. \\nA total of 800 troops, drones and tanks are moving to Estonia as part of the biggest military build-up of NATO troops on Russia\u2019s borders since the Cold War. \\nIn addition to the forces allocated for his specific operation, NATO has an army of over 40,000 ready to be called up to fight at any time. \\nThe US military claims that this threatening move is meant to act as a \u201cdeterrent\u201d to the Russian military, but this is obvious a move that will escalate tensions and push towards a possible third world war. \\n\u201cThis is a credible deterrence, not to provoke a conflict but to prevent conflict,\u201d NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Tuesday \u2014 ironically ignoring the fact that it is a de facto provocation. \\nJust imagine what would happen if Russian troops amassed along the Mexican border and told the US that this move was to \u2018prevent conflict.\u2019 \\nThe so-called Iskander-M cruise missiles can hit targets across Poland and the Baltics, although NATO officials declined to say if Russia had moved nuclear warheads to Kaliningrad. \\nThe United States\u2019 envoy to NATO, Douglas Lute, told reporters that NATO and the US military may consider Russia a threat if they had nuclear weapons within range of NATO\u2019s deployment. This statement is insane considering the fact that the US military is the one that is many miles from home on the border of someone else\u2019s lands. \\n\u201cThis deployment, if it becomes permanent if the presence of nuclear weapons were confirmed, would be a change in (Russia\u2019s) security posture,\u201d Lute said. \\nIf anyone is a threat, it is NATO and the US government. \\nThese military tensions are the result of an ongoing proxy war in Syria, in which Western powers are attempting to institute a regime change in the country by funding violent rebel groups. Meanwhile, Russia has interests in keeping their allies in the Syrian government in control, putting the two superpowers at odds. \\nUntil now, Russia and the US have been fighting through third parties, just as they had during the previous Cold War, and the same type of situation is developing today. \\nJohn Vibes is an author and researcher who organizes a number of large events including the Free Your Mind Conference.
