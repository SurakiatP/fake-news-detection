But for a ceremony that can be numbingly predictable, the Emmys were energized by a slew of   winners in the acting categories and a tour de force in the limited series category by FX\u2019s \u201cThe People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story. \u201d The success of the O. J. series set the theme for the evening as Sarah Paulson, Courtney B. Vance and Sterling K. Brown all scored their first Emmy victories. Rami Malek won his first Emmy as well in a   race for best actor in a drama, for his role as the tortured hacker in USA\u2019s \u201cMr. Robot. \u201d And in a big upset, Tatiana Maslany won as best actress in a drama for her numerous performances in BBC America\u2019s \u201cOrphan Black,\u201d beating out the likes of Robin Wright, Claire Danes and last year\u2019s winner, Viola Davis. Kate McKinnon of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d provided a change of pace, too, upsetting Allison Janney, a   Emmy winner, as best supporting actress for comedy. Likewise, Louie Anderson won his first Emmy in the best supporting comedy category for his role as a suburban mother in FX\u2019s \u201cBaskets. \u201d There was a changing of the guard in the variety category, as John Oliver\u2019s show, \u201cLast Week Tonight,\u201d ended the   run of Comedy Central victories. There were familiar winners as well: In the comedy category, Julia   won her fifth consecutive best actress award for her role on \u201cVeep,\u201d and Jeffrey Tambor, for the second year in a row, won for his role as a transgender woman in \u201cTransparent. \u201d This was the second consecutive year that \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and \u201cVeep\u201d took top honors, which helped propel HBO to six Emmys on Sunday night and 22 Emmys over all (some categories were awarded previously) the biggest haul of any programmer. FX was right behind with 18 wins, including six on Sunday. \u201cThrones\u201d once again led all shows with 12 wins, including three on Sunday, but there is some good news for HBO\u2019s rivals in the drama category: Next year \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d one of TV\u2019s most widely praised dramas, will not be eligible for the Emmys the network elected to start the show\u2019s seventh season in the summer 2017, outside of the   window. In a sign of the expected Emmys dominance for \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and \u201cO. J,\u201d Jimmy Kimmel, the show\u2019s host, said in his opening monologue, \u201cIf your show doesn\u2019t have a dragon or a white Bronco in it, go home. \u201d Here are some of the themes and highlights of the evening: Comedy Central had a chokehold on the variety talk show category for years, and a Comedy Central alumnus took the award on Sunday: Mr. Oliver, for his HBO show, \u201cLast Week Tonight. \u201d The show is now in its third season, and the win represents a breakthrough of sorts. The Emmy in this category has been handed out to daily talk shows for years and hasn\u2019t been given to a weekly show since Tracey Ullman won for her sketch series \u201cTracey Takes On  \u2026    \u201d nearly 20 years ago. (Starting last year, variety sketch series and variety talk series were separated into different categories.) Mr. Oliver\u2019s triumph is a blow for Comedy Central, which had won this award for 13 consecutive years between \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d and \u201cThe Colbert Report. \u201d Not this year Trevor Noah, Jon Stewart\u2019s replacement, was shut out of the race and not nominated in his first year as host of \u201cThe Daily Show. \u201d But there was some solace in Comedy Central\u2019s night, when \u201cKey  Peele\u201d won the best variety sketch series award. The bad news? That is now off the air. Not surprisingly, this year\u2019s divisive election played a significant role in this year\u2019s ceremony. Lamenting the possibility of a Donald J. Trump presidency, Mr. Kimmel lit into the reality show producer Mark Burnett, who was one of the creators of NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d the show that made Mr. Trump a nationwide television star. With ABC\u2019s camera firmly squared on Mr. Burnett  \u2014   who laughed the entire time, despite the charged barbs  \u2014   Mr. Kimmel said that if Mr. Trump is elected president, Mr. Burnett is the man to blame. \u201cIf he\u2019s elected and he builds that wall, the first person we\u2019re throwing over it is Mark Burnett,\u201d Mr. Kimmel said. Later in the night, after \u201cThe Voice\u201d won the best reality show, Mr. Burnett, a producer for that show as well, shot back at Mr. Kimmel saying that the host gave \u201canother five minutes of free publicity\u201d for Mr. Trump. Mr. Kimmel took the stage afterward and had his own retort: \u201cThat Emmy is going on the hood of Trump\u2019s limousine, isn\u2019t it?\u201d And Ms.   who plays the vice president turned president Selina Meyer, said this upon winning her Emmy for every year she\u2019s been nominated in the role: \u201cOur show started out as a political satire, but it now feels more like a sobering documentary. \u201d FX\u2019s \u201cThe People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story\u201d was a ratings hit and a darling of critics, and now a   Emmy winner. In addition to winning the limited series Emmy, Ms. Paulson, Mr. Vance and Mr. Brown all won acting awards. Mr. Vance and Mr. Brown both beat   to win. Nearly every feature player on the show was nominated for an award, a total of six in all. After Ms. Paulson was named best actress, she got up from her seat and gave a big hug to Marcia Clark, the prosecutor she played in the   drama, and whom she brought as her guest to the ceremony. Ms. Paulson\u2019s performance was a sympathetic one, and it\u2019s been a year of redemption for Ms. Clark. \u201cI, along with the rest of the world, had been superficial and careless in my judgment,\u201d Ms. Paulson said, choking up as she directed her comments to Ms. Clark. \u201cAnd I am glad to be able to stand here today in front of everyone and tell you I\u2019m sorry. \u2019\u2019 For FX, \u201cThe People v. O. J. Simpson\u201d was the leader for what was turning out to be its best year at the Emmys ever. \u201cFargo\u201d was also nominated in the   category and, after years of being shut out, FX\u2019s critically praised \u201cThe Americans\u201d finally broke through with three major nominations  \u2014   best drama, best actor (Matthew Rhys) and best actress (Keri Russell)  \u2014   though it did not win. The Oscars have been the subject of withering outrage the last two years for a lack of racial diversity in the acting categories. The Emmys? There\u2019s been something closer to silence. No one would argue that TV has fully addressed the issue of race  \u2014   it has a problem when it comes to tapping minorities behind the scenes, as the Directors Guild of America reported last week, and CBS was criticized in August for a fall lineup featuring familiar white male actors. But nearly two dozen minority actors were nominated for Emmys this year, following Ms. Davis\u2019s acting victory a year ago. There were three   winners in acting categories Sunday, a notable departure from this year\u2019s Academy Awards, in which no minorities were nominated in the acting categories. In addition to wins from Mr. Brown and Mr. Vance, Regina King won the supporting actress in a limited series Emmy for her role in ABC\u2019s \u201cAmerican Crime. \u201d And \u201cKey  Peele\u201d prevailed in the variety sketch award. Instead, attention has turned to the awards themselves, with campaigning having turned into something of a blood sport. In the last two years there has been a 40 percent increase in the number of submissions for the best drama Emmy, according to the Television Academy. And \u201cfor your consideration\u201d mailers have reached comical proportions, with Netflix sending out a package to Emmy voters so hefty that it could crush a toe. For each of the last three years, streaming services like Netflix and Amazon have become a larger presence at the Emmys. Netflix had 54 nominations this year, its highest ever, and for the first time, it did better than any of the broadcast networks. But despite the upheaval Netflix has caused in the industry, the streaming service has yet to have a big Emmys night. Though it collected nine Emmys overall, including three on Sunday, Netflix continues to strike out in the best drama, best comedy and best actor and actress categories. Ben Mendelsohn did win the Emmy for best supporting actor for his role in \u201cBloodline. \u201d But even with the lavish attention on the presidential election this year, neither Kevin Spacey nor Robin Wright won for their roles in the political drama \u201cHouse of Cards. \u201d Neither actor has won a Primetime Emmy Award. For Amazon, Mr. Tambor won again for \u201cTransparent. \u2019\u2019 The broadcast networks continued to have a diminished presence at the Emmys. NBC won two awards Sunday night, and ABC and Fox won one. CBS was shut out altogether.
