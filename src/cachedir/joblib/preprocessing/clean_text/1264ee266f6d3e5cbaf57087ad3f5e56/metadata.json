Baiser sources: Greater than 99 percent confidence that Clinton\u2019s private email server had been hacked by at least five foreign intelligence agencies. \\n(WASHINGTON, DC) Citing sources at the FBI, Fox News anchor Bret Baier said the FBI\u2019s renewed investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server will almost certainly end in an indictment, unless some sort of \u201cobstruction\u201d arises. \\nBaier made the claim Wednesday night during a broadcast of \u201cOn the Record\u201d with Brit Hume. He said that a \u201clot of evidence\u201d had been recovered from Anthony Wiener\u2019s laptop, and made an eventual indictment appear very likely, even if it came months after the election. \\n\u201cI pressed, again and again, on this very issue,\u201d Baier told Hume. \u201cThese sources said, yes, the investigations will continues [sic], there\u2019s a lot of evidence, and barring some obstruction in some way, they believe they\u2019ll continue to, likely, an indictment.\u201d \\nBaier didn\u2019t say exactly who would be the most most likely target of an indictment, and what the timeline on such an indictment would be. \\nBaier also said that his sources had greater than 99 percent confidence that Clinton\u2019s private email server had been hacked by at least five foreign intelligence agencies. When FBI Director James Comey first announced last summer that no charges would be recommended regarding Clinton\u2019s server, he said the FBI had no way of knowing whether the server had been hacked. \\nClinton\u2019s presidential campaign aggressively downplayed the severity of the renewed investigation into her private email server, and criticized the judgment of Comey for publicly announcing it. \\nDaily Caller copy, TRUNEWS analysis Please contact TRUNEWS correspondent Edward Szall with any news tips related to this story.
