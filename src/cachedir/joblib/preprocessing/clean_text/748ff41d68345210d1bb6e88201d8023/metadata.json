The Cubs fan who snared it even returned it to Wood after the game rather than keep it as a memento. But at Wrigley, not all home runs are received equally. A longstanding protocol there dictates that when a visiting player hits one out, any upstanding Cubs fan who catches the ball is obliged to launch it back onto the field. Even the people who position themselves beyond the outfield walls at Wrigley and attempt to snag home runs hit onto Sheffield and Waveland Avenues sometimes follow this code. It is a symbolic act, turning the baseball into a bitter pill that is better spit out than swallowed. \u201cIt\u2019s awesome. It\u2019s part of the history of the Cubs,\u201d said Anthony Prerost, who had caught what, until Saturday night, was the most significant home run of Wood\u2019s career, a grand slam against the Chicago White Sox in 2013. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to accept opposing teams or opposing players. So why should we accept their home runs? We might as well reject them, too. \u201d Not everyone, however, is so enthusiastic about this practice. \u201cIt\u2019s stupid,\u201d said Jeff Gorski, who caught Miguel Montero\u2019s   homer last month that put an exclamation point on the Cubs\u2019 National League Central title. \u201cCatching a home run is a     experience. Why should you have to throw it back just because it wasn\u2019t somebody on the Cubs who hit it?\u201d The tradition, which dates back nearly five decades, has spread over the years to other ballparks, including Yankee Stadium. Last year, a fan there threw back a home run ball hit by Toronto\u2019s Jose Bautista and struck Yankees left fielder Brett Gardner in the back of the head, leaving him with a welt. When Bautista hit another home run last week at Texas in Game 1 of an American League division series, a Rangers fan reached the infield with his defiant throw. At places like Wrigley Field and Yankee Stadium, anyone who does not throw back an opposing home run can expect to hear adamant chants of \u201cThrow. It. Back. \u201d Sitting in the   bleachers before the   series began on Friday night, Colleen Solomon, a schoolteacher, frowned when her friend Jennifer Dompke said she would gladly chuck a Giants home run back onto the field. \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to fall victim to the mob mentality,\u201d said Solomon, who equated fans\u2019 chants to throw a ball back with the bullying behavior she points out to her students. \u201cThere\u2019s a deindividualization when you\u2019re in a crowd. I wouldn\u2019t walk up to a Giants player and boo, but when I\u2019m surrounded by thousands of people, I\u2019m more likely to do it. \u201d Solomon was spared any angst because the Giants, in losing the first two games of the series, did not manage to hit any balls into the bleachers. But that was not a surprise. They hit only 130 home runs this season, the third fewest in baseball. But if the Cubs enjoy as prosperous a postseason as their fans are pining for, and they move on to the National League Championship Series and then  \u2014   dare we say it?  \u2014   the World Series, sluggers like the Los Angeles Dodgers\u2019 Corey Seager or the Blue Jays\u2019 Edwin Encarnacion might end up launching a drive into the Wrigley bleachers. Which, in turn, will give some Cubs fan the chance to throw the ball back. The tradition, like so much else in the Cubs history, apparently traces its roots back to 1969, the year the Cubs collapsed in the last part of the season, blowing a   lead over the Mets. That season at Wrigley, Hank Aaron hit his 521st career home run, tying him with Ted Williams. The ball was caught by Ron Grousl, a    bartender who was a denizen of the   bleachers. Grousl said he offered the ball to Aaron after the game as the slugger was making his way to the Braves\u2019 bus, but Aaron refused, apparently angry that fans in right field had dumped beer on him when he ventured near the wall. The next season, when Aaron hit a home run at Wrigley Field and Grousl caught it, he said he was still so upset with Aaron\u2019s rejection (and maybe everything else that happened in 1969) that he threw the ball back onto the field. \u201cI just thought: \u2018Get this out of here. I don\u2019t want it,\u2019\u201d Grousl, 70, said in a telephone interview. \u201cI just threw it back. \u201d Asked if, after all these years, he regretted throwing back a home run hit by one of baseball\u2019s greatest players, Grousl said: \u201cNo. I went to every game. I caught a lot of home run balls. You were just mad about the whole thing in \u201969. \u201d Slowly, Grousl\u2019s act caught on. Some Wrigley fans needed prodding to throw the balls back, so an empty beer cup would be passed around to collect a bribe many people would put in a dollar or two. \u201cWe\u2019d get about $25, and the guy would give up the ball then we\u2019d throw it back,\u201d Grousl said. On other occasions, the Cubs relievers  \u2014   who were stationed in the bullpen down the   line  \u2014   would provide an autographed ball to trade for the one headed back to the field. \u201cIt might take an inning,\u201d Grousl said. But it was not until the 1980s, when the bleachers became a preferred place to watch a game at Wrigley, that throwing back home runs became a staple of the park\u2019s culture. And with Cubs games being broadcast nationally on the superstation WGN, the ritual gained broad exposure. When Shawon Dunston became the starting shortstop for the Cubs in 1985, he was baffled the first time a home run ball was thrown back on the field and rolled toward him. \u201cI wanted to fire it back, and then somebody said, \u2018No, it\u2019s a tradition,\u2019\u201d said Dunston, who is now a coach with the Giants and was known for having one of the strongest arms in baseball. \u201cI didn\u2019t like the ball going over the fence, so when the fans threw it back, they went crazy. I kind of liked it. \u201d Over the years, the regulars in the bleachers have forged a personal bond with the players. Gary Matthews, nicknamed Sarge, was the left fielder when the Cubs ended a   playoff drought in 1984. He bought Army caps for the fans in left field. When the Cubs clinched a playoff berth in 2003, right fielder Sammy Sosa broke off the clubhouse celebration and returned to the warning track to spray champagne on those still rejoicing in the bleachers. And after the Cubs clinched the division this season, the team\u2019s president, Theo Epstein, put on a fake mustache and sunglasses and sat in the bleachers, too. Bob Dernier, the Cubs\u2019 center fielder in 1984, recalled joining Matthews during pitching changes for conversations with fans in the bleachers. \u201cThis is as intimate as a ballpark can be,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a unique relationship you have with the fans out there. \u201d Just ask David Rudstein, a    law school professor who has been attending games since he was he was 7. When Alfonso Soriano played left field for the Cubs, he would toss Rudstein several balls a game. After Soriano was traded in 2013, Rudstein struck up a friendship with Soriano\u2019s friend Hector Rondon, a reliever. Rudstein said that when he was waiting in line to enter the ballpark, a Range Rover with tinted windows came to a stop on Waveland Avenue. The window rolled down: It was Rondon, pausing to say hello. Rudstein has thrown balls back  \u2014   he said he once caught two within three innings, hit by the Houston Astros\u2019 Craig Biggio and Craig Shipley  \u2014   but he, like many of the bleacher regulars, is sophisticated. They bring a dummy ball, perhaps one they caught during batting practice, and then slyly throw that one back if they catch a visitor\u2019s home run. \u201cI don\u2019t like it all,\u201d Rudstein said of the    tradition before momentarily interrupting an interview to  \u2014   what else?  \u2014   catch a   homer. \u201cWhen you catch a game ball, I don\u2019t think throwing it back says anything at all. A home run ball is a home run ball. \u201d After tucking away two   home runs in a duffel bag for future use as dummy balls, Walter Scott, 54, an airline pilot, said: \u201cSometimes you see a real rotten one go back. But as long as one goes back, everybody\u2019s happy. You\u2019re just appeasing the crowd. \u201d There is a certain etiquette that comes with sitting in the bleachers at Wrigley. Attempting the wave is a grave offense. Offering a baseball to a child might be repaid with a beer by a parent. \u201cBleacher currency,\u201d said Gorski, 35, who sells   jewelry. \u201cIt\u2019s good karma. \u201d And some elements of the social contract in the bleachers are  . \u201cOnce, a random fan bought me a hot dog,\u201d said Solomon, the schoolteacher, who was touched by the gesture. \u201cThen I put ketchup on it, and he took it away. \u201d The expectations for visitors\u2019 home runs are more straightforward. A weak throw, one that does not reach the field from the bleachers  \u2014   while rare  \u2014   is a sure way to generate boos at Wrigley. Timing is important, too. Ideally, the throw should be seen by the hitter  \u2014   that means launching it from right field as he rounds first base and from left field as he rounds second. And do not wait until the offending player has returned to the field after the inning, as one fan did during the 2008 playoffs. He was ejected for throwing Manny Ramirez\u2019s home run ball back at Ramirez when he returned to left field. There is one way, however, to cut through discomfort with social mores and longstanding tribal rituals. It is in the hands of the Cubs pitchers, who for many years were not as proficient as they are now at a singular task: keeping baseballs out of the bleachers.'"}, "time": 1742562922.957347}
