These guns were used in high-profile incidents, including the terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, California, and Orlando, and the mass shootings in Aurora, Colorado, and Newtown, Connecticut. \\nThe findings reveal just how out of step Hillary Clinton\u2019s position on gun control is with the majority of Americans. \\nHillary is a staunch gun control proponent. Wikileaks releases have revealed that Hillary plans to implement strict gun control measures by executive order. \\nClinton purportedly plans to open gun manufacturers to lawsuits by crime victims, a move that critics say would do nothing to reduce crime, but would bankrupt\u2013and eventually end\u2013gun manufacturing in the United States.
