[However, the news media has largely failed to note that on February 16, about two weeks prior to her statements on MSNBC, Farkas revealed in an interview that she was \u201cgetting winks and hints from inside that there was something really wrong here\u201d  \u2014   referring to Trump officials\u2019 alleged ties to Russia.  She stated that she was \u201cfirst made aware of all this stuff\u201d during the summer.  On March 2, Farkas stated on MSNBC that she told former Obama administration colleagues to collect intelligence on Trump and campaign officials. \u201cI was urging my former colleagues and, frankly speaking, the people on the Hill, it was more actually aimed at telling the Hill people, get as much information as you can, get as much intelligence as you can, before President Obama leaves the administration,\u201d stated Farkas. She continued: Because I had a fear that somehow that information would disappear with the senior [Obama] people who left, so it would be hidden away in the bureaucracy   \u2026     that the Trump folks  \u2014   if they found out how we knew what we knew about their   \u2026     the Trump staff dealing with Russians  \u2014   that they would try to compromise those sources and methods, meaning we no longer have access to that intelligence. After her remarks resurfaced and were subsequently used by the White House to bolster the charge that Trump was under illicit surveillance during the campaign, Farkas gave interviews denying that she had any inside information when she made those comments to MSNBC. She told the Daily Caller last week that she had no access to any intelligence. \u201cI had no intelligence whatsoever, I wasn\u2019t in government anymore and didn\u2019t have access to any,\u201d she said. Speaking to the Washington Post, Farkas denied being a source of any leaks. The Post reported: Farkas, in an interview with The Post, said she \u201cdidn\u2019t give anybody anything except advice,\u201d was not a source for any stories and had nothing to leak. Noting that she left government in October 2015, she said, \u201cI was just watching like anybody else, like a regular spectator\u201d as initial reports of Russia contacts began to surface after the election. However, on February 16, Farkas told Ezra Klein at Vox. com that she was \u201cgetting winks and hints from inside\u201d about alleged Russia ties.  The interview was also highlighted by the Gateway Pundit blog. Farkas was asked by Klein about her \u201clevel of alarm after the resignation of Michael Flynn,\u201d who stepped down in February as Trump\u2019s national security adviser. Regarding her \u201clevel of alarm,\u201d Farkas replied: It\u2019s lower than it\u2019s been since the summer, when I was first made aware of all this stuff. I\u2019m like, finally, everybody else sees it! Seriously. The reason I was so upset last summer was that I was getting winks and hints from inside that there was something really wrong here. I was agitated because I knew the Clinton campaign and the world didn\u2019t know. But I didn\u2019t think it would happen this fast. I didn\u2019t think Flynn would survive a year, but I thought it would be most of the year. The fact that Flynn is gone is constructive from the perspective of US foreign policy. He was getting it wrong on combating terrorism and Russia. So I feel relieved that he will not be whispering his policy prescriptions in the president\u2019s ear. On the bigger issue, the intelligence community, the bureaucracy, patriotic Americans, and some members of Congress are making it impossible for the White House to sweep whatever they are trying to hide under the rug. And the White House is clearly trying to hide something, or the president would have said, on day one, that he would support the investigations that began under his predecessor. This past week, Breitbart News first reported that at a conference last October, held two weeks before the presidential election, Farkas predicted that if Trump won the presidency he would \u201cbe impeached pretty quickly or somebody else would have to take over government. \u201d Breitbart News also first reported that at the same conference, Farkas warned that more must be done to counter the forces of nationalism and populism that have been entering the mainstream with the rise of Trump and nationalist movements across Europe. Farkas currently serves as a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, which takes a hawkish approach toward Russia and has released numerous reports and briefs about Russian aggression. The Council is funded by the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Inc. the U. S. State Department and NATO ACT. Another Council funder is the Ploughshares Fund, which in turn has received financing from billionaire George Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundations. Farkas serves on the Atlantic Council alongside Dmitri Alperovitch,   of CrowdStrike, the   company utilized by the FBI to make its assessment about alleged Russian hacking into the Democratic National Committee (DNC). Alperovitch is a nonresident senior fellow of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council. Last month, FBI Director James Comey confirmed that his agency never had direct access to the DNC\u2019s servers to confirm the hacking. \u201cWell, we never got direct access to the machines themselves,\u201d he stated. \u201cThe DNC in the spring of 2016 hired a firm that ultimately shared with us their forensics from their review of the system. \u201d National Security Agency Director Michael Rogers also stated the NSA never asked for access to the DNC hardware: \u201cThe NSA didn\u2019t ask for access. That\u2019s not in our job. \u201d  Aaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.
