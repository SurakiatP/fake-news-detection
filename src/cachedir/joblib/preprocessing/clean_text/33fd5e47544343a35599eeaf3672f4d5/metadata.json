When the other candidates were zigging toward the familiar\u2014and unpopular\u2014Chamber of Commerce-approved orthodoxy, Trump was zagging toward the voters. \\nMoreover, the same sort of populist-nationalist reservoir-tapping was evident in the realm of foreign affairs. To put it in bluntly Trumpian terms, the New Yorker hit \u2019em where they weren\u2019t. \\nThe fact that Trump was doing something dramatically different became clear in the make-or-break Republican debate in Greenville, S.C., on February 13. Back in those early days of the campaign, Trump had lost one contest (Iowa) and won one (New Hampshire), and it was still anybody\u2019s guess who would emerge victorious. \\nDuring that debate, Trump took what seemed to be an extraordinary gamble: he ripped into George W. Bush\u2019s national-security record\u2014in a state where the 43rd president was still popular. Speaking of the Iraq War, Trump said, \u201cGeorge Bush made a mistake. We can make mistakes. But that one was a beauty. We should have never been in Iraq. We have destabilized the Middle East.\u201d \\nAnd then Trump went further, aiming indirectly at the former president, while slugging his brother Jeb directly: \u201cThe World Trade Center came down during your brother\u2019s reign, remember that.\u201d \\nIn response, Jeb intoned the usual Republican line, \u201cHe kept us safe.\u201d And others on the stage in Greenville that night rushed to associate themselves with Bush 43. \\nIn the aftermath of this verbal melee, many thought that Trump had doomed himself. As one unnamed Republican \u201cstrategist\u201d chortled to Politico, \u201cTrump\u2019s attack on President George W. Bush was galactic-level stupid in South Carolina.\u201d \\nWell, not quite: Trump triumphed in the Palmetto State primary a week later, winning by a 10-point margin. \\nThus, as we can see in retrospect, something had changed within the GOP. After 9/11, in the early years of this century, South Carolinians had been eager to fight. Yet by the middle of the second decade, they\u2014or at least a plurality of them\u2014had grown weary of endless foreign war. \\nTrump\u2019s victory in the Palmetto State was decisive, yet it was nevertheless only a plurality, 32.5 percent. Meanwhile, Sen. Marco Rubio, running as an unabashed neocon hawk, finished second. \\nSo we can see that the Republican foreign-policy \u201cmarket\u201d is now segmented. And while Trump proved effective at targeting crucial segments, they weren\u2019t the only segments\u2014because, in actuality, there are four easily identifiable blocs on the foreign-policy right. And as we delineate these four segments, we can see that while some are highly organized and tightly articulate, others are loose and inchoate: \\nFirst, the libertarians. That is, the Cato Institute and other free-market think tanks,Reason magazine, and so on. Libertarians are not so numerous around the country, but they are strong among the intelligentsia. \\nSecond, the old-right \u201cisolationists.\u201d These folks, also known as \u201cpaleocons,\u201d often find common ground with libertarians, yet their origins are different, and so is their outlook. Whereas the libertarians typically have issued a blanket anathema to all foreign entanglements, the isolationists have been more selective. During World War I, for example, their intellectual forbears were hostile to U.S. involvement on the side of the Allies, but that was often because of specifically anti-English or pro-German sentiments, not because they felt guided by an overall principle of non-intervention. Indeed, the same isolationists were often eager to intervene in Latin America and in the Far East. More recently, the temperamentally isolationist bloc has joined with the libertarians in opposition to deeper U.S. involvement in the Middle East. \\nThird, the traditional hawks. On the proverbial Main Street, USA, plenty of people\u2014not limited to the active-duty military, veterans, and law-enforcers\u2014believe that America\u2019s national honor is worth fighting for. \\nFourth, the neoconservatives. This group, which takes hawkishness to an avant-garde extreme, is so praised, and so criticized, that there\u2019s little that needs be added here. Yet we can say this: as with the libertarians, they are concentrated in Washington, DC; by contrast, out beyond the Beltway, they are relatively scarce. Because of their connections to big donors to both parties, however, they have been powerful, even preeminent, in foreign-policy circles over the last quarter-century. Yet today, it\u2019s the neocons who feel most threatened by, and most hostile to, the Trump phenomenon. \\nWe can pause to offer a contextual point: floating somewhere among the first three categories\u2014libertarians, isolationists, hawks\u2014are the foreign-policy realists. These, of course, are the people, following in the tradition of the great scholar Hans Morgenthau, who pride themselves on seeing the world as it is, regarding foreign policy as just another application of Bismarckian wisdom\u2014\u201cthe art of the possible.\u201d \\nThe realists, disproportionately academics and think-tankers, are a savvy and well-credentialed group\u2014or, according to critics, cynical and world-weary. Yet either way, they have made many alliances with the aforementioned trio of groups, even as they have usually maintained their ideological flexibility. To borrow the celebrated wisdom of the 19th-century realpolitiker Lord Palmerston, realists don\u2019t have permanent attachments; they have permanent interests. And so it seems likely that if Trump wins\u2014or anyone like Trump in the future\u2014many realists will be willing to emerge from their wood-paneled precincts to engage in the hurly-burly of public service. \\nReturning to our basic quartet of blocs, we can quickly see that two of them, the libertarians and the neocons, have been loudly successful in the \u201cbattle of ideas.\u201d That is, almost everyone knows where the libertarians and the neocons stand on the controversies of the moment. Meanwhile, the other two groups\u2014the isolationists and the traditional hawks\u2014have failed to make themselves heard. That is, until Trump. \\nFor the most part, the isolationists and hawks have not been organized; they\u2019ve just been clusters of veterans, cops, gun owners, and like-minded souls gathering here and there, feeling strongly about the issues but never finding a national megaphone. Indeed, even organized groups, such as the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars, sizable as they might be, have had little impact, of late, on foreign affairs. \\nThis paradoxical reality\u2014that even big groups can be voiceless, allowing smaller groups to carry the day\u2014is well understood. Back in 1839, the historian Thomas Carlyle observed of his Britain, \u201cThe speaking classes speak and debate,\u201d while the \u201cdeep-buried [working] class lies like an Enceladus\u201d\u2014a mythological giant imprisoned under a volcano. Yet, Carlyle continued, the giant under the volcano will not stay silent forever; one day it will erupt, and the inevitable eruption \u201chas to produce earthquakes!\u201d \\nIn our time, Trump has provoked the Enceladus-like earthquake. Over the past year, while the mainstream media has continued to lavish attention on the fine points of libertarianism and neoconservatism, the Peoples of the Volcano have blown up American politics. \\nTrump has spoken loudly to both of his groups. To the isolationists, he has highlighted his past opposition to the Iraq and Libya misadventures, as well as his suspicions about NATO and other alliances. (Here the libertarians, too, are on board.) At the same time, he has also talked the language of the hawks, as when he has said, \u201cTake the oil\u201d and \u201cBomb the [bleep] out of them.\u201d Trump has also attacked the Iran nuclear agreement, deriding it as \u201cone of the worst deals ever made.\u201d \\nThus earlier this year Trump mobilized the isolationists and the hawks, leaving the libertarians to Rand Paul and the neocons to Rubio. \\nNow as we move to the general election, it appears that Trump has kept the loyalty of his core groups. Many libertarians, meanwhile, are voting for Gary Johnson\u2014the former Republican governor at the top of the Libertarian Party\u2019s ticket\u2014and they are being joined, most likely as a one-off, by disaffected Republicans and Democrats. Meanwhile, the neocons, most of them, have become the objective allies, if not the overt supporters, of Hillary Clinton. \\nEven if Trump loses, his energized supporters, having found their voice, will be a new and important force within the GOP\u2014a force that could make it significantly harder for a future president to, say, \u201cliberate\u201d and \u201cdemocratize\u201d Syria. \\n\u2666\u2666\u2666 \\nYet now we must skip past the unknown unknowns of the election and ask: what might we expect if Trump becomes president? \\nOne immediate point to be borne in mind is that it will be a challenge to fill the cabinet and the sub-cabinet\u2014to say nothing of the thousands of \u201cSchedule C\u201d positions across the administration\u2014with true Trump loyalists. Yes, of course, if Trump wins that means he will have garnered 50 million or more votes, but still, the number of people who have the right credentials and can pass all the background checks\u2014including, for most of the top jobs, Senate confirmation\u2014is minuscule. \\nSo here we might single out the foreign-policy realists as likely having a bright future in a Trump administration: after all, they are often well-credentialed and, by their nature, have prudently tended to keep their anti-Trump commentary to a minimum. (There\u2019s a piece of inside-the-Beltway realist wisdom that seems relevant here: \u201cYou\u2019re for what happens.\u201d) \\nYet the path to realist dominion in a Trump administration is not smooth. As a group, they have been in eclipse since the Bush 41 era, so an entire generation of their cadres is missing. The realists do not have long lists of age-appropriate alumni ready for another spin through the revolving door. \\nBy contrast, the libertarians have lots of young staffers on some think-tank payroll or another. And of course, the neocons have lots of experience and contacts\u2014yes, they screwed up the last time they were in power, but at least they know the jargon. \\nThus, unless president-elect Trump makes a genuinely heroic effort to infuse his administration with new blood, he will end up hiring a lot of folks who might not really agree with him\u2014and who perhaps even have strongly, if quietly, opposed him. That means that the path of a Trump presidency could be channeled in an unexpected direction, as the adherents of other foreign-policy schools\u2014including, conceivably, schools from the left\u2014clamber aboard. As they say in DC, \u201cpersonnel is policy.\u201d \\nStill, Trump has a strong personality, and it\u2019s entirely possible that, as president, he will succeed in imprinting his unique will on his appointees. (On the other hand, the career government, starting with the State Department\u2019s foreign service officers, might well prove to be a different story.) \\nLooking further ahead, as a hypothetical President Trump surveys the situation from the Sit Room, here are nine things that will be in view: \\n1. \\nTrump will recall, always, that the Bush 43 presidency drove itself into a ditch on Iraq. So he will surely see the supreme value of not sending U.S. ground troops\u2014beyond a few advisors\u2014into Middle Eastern war zones. \\n2. \\nTrump will also realize that Barack Obama, for all his talk about hope and change, ended up preserving the bulk of Bush 43\u2019s policies. The only difference is that Obama did it on the cheap, reducing defense spending as he went along. \\nObama similar to Bush\u2014really? Yes. To be sure, Obama dropped all of Bush\u2019s democratic messianism, but even with his cool detachment he kept all of Bush\u2019s alliances and commitments, including those in Afghanistan and Iraq. And then he added a new international commitment: \u201cclimate change.\u201d \\nIn other words, America now has a policy of \u201cquintuple containment\u201d: Russia, China, Iran, ISIS/al-Qaeda, and, of course, the carbon-dioxide molecule. Many would argue that today we aren\u2019t managing any of these containments well; others insist that the Obama administration, perversely, seems most dedicated to the containment of climate change: everything else can fall apart, but if the Obamans can maintain the illusion of their international CO2 deals, as far as they are concerned all will be well. \\nIn addition, Uncle Sam has another hundred or so minor commitments\u2014including bilateral defense treaties with countries most Americans have never heard of, along with special commitments to champion the rights of children, women, dissidents, endangered species, etc. On a one-by-one basis, it\u2019s possible to admire many of these efforts; on a cumulative basis, it\u2019s impossible to imagine how we can sustain all of them. \\n3. A populist president like Trump will further realize that if the U.S. has just 4 percent of the world\u2019s population and barely more than a fifth of world GDP, it\u2019s not possible that we can continue to police the planet. Yes, we have many allies\u2014on paper. Yet Trump\u2019s critique of many of them as feckless, even faithless, resonated for one big reason: it was true. \\nSo Trump will likely begin the process of rethinking U.S. commitments around the world. Do we really want to risk nuclear war over the Spratly Islands? Or the eastern marches of Ukraine? Here, Trump might well default to the wisdom of the realists: big powers are just that\u2014big powers\u2014and so one must deal with them in all their authoritarian essentiality. And as for all the other countries of the world\u2014some we like and some we don\u2019t\u2014we\u2019re not going to change them, either. (Although in some cases, notably Iraq and Syria, partition, supervised by the great powers, may be the only solution.) \\n4. \\nTrump will surely see world diplomacy as an extension of what he has done best all his life\u2014making deals. This instinct will serve him well in two ways: first, he will be sharply separating himself from his predecessors, Bush the hot-blooded unilateralist war-of-choicer and Obama the cool and detached multilateralist leader-from-behind. Second, his deal-making desire will inspire him do what needs to be done: build rapport with world leaders as a prelude to making things happen. \\nTo cite one immediate example: there\u2019s no way that we will ever achieve anything resembling \u201cpeace with honor\u201d in Afghanistan without the full cooperation of the Taliban\u2019s masters in Pakistan. Ergo, the needed deal must be struck in Islamabad, not Kabul. \\nAlmost certainly, a President Trump will treat China and Russia as legitimate powers, not as rogue states that must be single-handedly tamed by America. \\nMoreover, Trump\u2019s deal-making trope also suggests that instead of sacrificing American economic interests on the altar of U.S. \u201cleadership,\u201d he will view the strengthening of the American economy as central to American greatness. \\n5. \\nTrump will further realize that his friends the realists have had a blind spot of late when it comes to economic matters. Once upon a time\u2014that is, in the 19th century\u2014economic nationalism was at the forefront of American foreign-policy making. In the old days, as America\u2019s Manifest Destiny stretched beyond the continental U.S., expansionism and Hamiltonianism went together: as they used to say, trade follows the flag. Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s digging of the Panama Canal surely ranks as one of the most successful fusions of foreign and economic policy in American history. \\nYet in the past few decades, the economic nationalists and the foreign-policy realists have drifted apart. For example, a Reagan official, Clyde Prestowitz of the Economic Strategy Institute, has been mostly ignored by the realists, who have instead embraced the conventional elite view of free trade and globalization. \\nSo a President Trump will have the opportunity to reunite realism and economic nationalism; he can once again put manufacturing exports, for example, at the top of the U.S. agenda. Indeed, Trump might consider other economic-nationalist gambits: for example, if we are currently defending such wealthy countries as Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Norway, why aren\u2019t they investing some of the trillions of dollars in their sovereign-wealth funds into, say, American infrastructure? \\n6. \\nTrump will also come into power realizing that he has few friends in the foreign-policy establishment; after all, most establishmentarians opposed him vehemently. Yet that could turn out to be a real plus for the 45th president because it could enable him to discard the stodgy and outworn thinking of the \u201cexperts.\u201d In particular, he could refute the prevailing view that the U.S. is, and always must be, the benign hegemon, altruistically policing the world, while allowing its allies, satellites\u2014and even rivals\u2014to manufacture everything and thereby generate the jobs, profits, and knowhow. That was always, of course, a view that elevated the ambitions and pretensions of the American elite over the well-being of the larger U.S. population\u2014and maybe Trump can come up with a better and fairer vision. \\n7. \\nAs an instinctive deal-maker, Trump will have the capacity to clear away the underbrush of accumulated obsolete doctrines and dogmas. To cite just one small but tragic example, there\u2019s the dopey chain of thinking that has guided U.S. policy toward South Sudan. Today, we officially condemn both sides in that country\u2019s ongoing civil war. Yet we might ask, how can that work out well for American interests? After all, one side or the other is going to win, and we presumably want a friend in Juba, not a Chinese-affiliated foe. \\nOn the larger canvas, Trump will observe that if the U.S., China, and Russia are the three countries capable of destroying the world, then it\u2019s smart to figure out amodus vivendi among this threesome. Such practical deal-making, of course, would undermine the moralistic narrative that Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin are the potentates of new evil empires. \\n8. \\nWhether or not he\u2019s currently familiar with the terminology, Trump seems likely to recapitulate the \u201cmultipolar\u201d system envisioned by Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger in the 1970s. Back then, the multipolar vision included the U.S., the USSR, Western Europe, China, and Japan. \\nYet multipolarity was lost in the \u201980s, as the American economy was Reaganized, the Cold War grew colder, and the Soviet Union staggered to its self-implosion. Then in the \u201990s we had the \u201cunipolar moment,\u201d when the U.S. enjoyed \u201chyper-power\u201d primacy. \\nYet as with all moments, unipolarity soon passed, undone by the Iraq quagmire, America\u2019s economic stagnation, and the rise of other powers. So today, multipolarity seems destined to re-emerge with a slightly upgraded cast of players: the U.S., China, Russia, the European Union, and perhaps India. \\n9. \\nAnd, of course, Trump will have to build that wall along the U.S.-Mexican border. \\n\u2666\u2666\u2666 \\nSome might object that I am reading too much into Trump. Indeed, the conventional wisdom, even today, maintains that Trump is visceral, not intellectual, that he is buffoonish, not Kissingerian. \\nTo such critics, this Trump supporter feels compelled to respond: when has the conventional wisdom about the New Yorker been proven correct? \\nIt\u2019s not easy to become president. In all of U.S. history, just 42 individuals have been elected to the presidency\u2014or to the vice presidency and succeeded a fallen president. That is, indeed, an exclusive club. Or as Trump himself might say, it\u2019s not a club for dummies. \\nIf Trump does, in fact, become the 45th president, then by definition, he will have proven himself to be pretty darn strategic. And that\u2019s a portent that bodes well for his foreign policy. Did you enjoy this article? - Consider helping us!
