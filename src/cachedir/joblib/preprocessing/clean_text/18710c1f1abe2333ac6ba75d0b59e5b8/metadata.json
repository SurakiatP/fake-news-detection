He was glad someone else had to deal with the noisy taxis and the antsy drivers who used their horns as if they got paid by the honk. On Sunday afternoon, Earnhardt, 42, will begin his 18th full season at Nascar\u2019s top level by driving in the Daytona 500,   racing\u2019s premier race. But this, he said, will be a somewhat different Dale Earnhardt Jr. than has driven before. He was married on New Year\u2019s Eve to his longtime girlfriend, Amy Reimann, and he is also returning from a serious concussion that sidelined him since July. \u201cI do feel like this is a new chapter, for whatever reason,\u201d Earnhardt said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a vision for what\u2019s going to happen. I don\u2019t know how to explain it, but it feels like a new me. \u201d It is believed that Earnhardt sustained the concussion  \u2014   his second in four years  \u2014   in an accident during a June race in Brooklyn, Mich. He drove in three more races, but then did not return to the track for the rest of the 2016 season, missing 18 races in all. Earnhardt was medically cleared to resume racing on Dec. 8. Earnhardt, the son of Dale Earnhardt Sr. the   Nascar champion who died at the 2001 Daytona 500, has won the series\u2019 most popular driver award 14 straight times, largely because of his talent, bloodlines and demeanor, seemingly   and  . Success came at a cost, he said. \u201cI feel like I am maybe a little less stressed out, a little less hassled, I guess, by    living now,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess I was wound up, wound pretty tight. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I\u2019ve been out of the car for so long that I\u2019ve had this inadvertent vacation, I guess you could say, that it got my batteries really, really recharged. \u201d He stopped himself suddenly and added: \u201cOnly thing is, does it go away? Do I hang on to this feeling of \u2018All right, man\u2019? I know I\u2019ll get competitive when I get in the car. It\u2019ll be hard not to get short with my patience. That\u2019s the biggest thing  \u2014   just keeping patient. But I feel more calm and comfortable and not so wired up and strung out. \u201d Earnhardt has 26 victories in his   career at the top level of   racing, which is being called the Monster Energy Nascar Cup Series for the first time this year. But he has not won a series championship. Claiming one is certainly a driving force for him. But he has other priorities. He has a much deeper appreciation of the sport and its heritage than when he made his Nascar debut, in 1999, in a car owned by his father. He said he wanted the sport to be viable after he is done driving  \u2014   though he has no idea when that will be. \u201cI used to have an agenda: I wanted to do whatever made my car go faster,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m over that, knowing I\u2019m on the back side of my career. When I\u2019m done driving, I want the sport to be healthy. I\u2019m done taking and taking. I\u2019m ready to give, give. I try to think of what\u2019s the best thing for the sport instead of the best thing for the driver. \u201d Acknowledging that Nascar has encountered a recent dip in racetrack attendance and television ratings, Earnhardt, like others, believes the sport would benefit from an influx of new, and young, fans. One way to draw attention and keep it, he said, might be to tweak the rules, as Nascar has done this year by awarding points to leaders after designated stages of races. The public\u2019s accessibility to drivers was not what it was in his father\u2019s heyday, but Earnhardt Jr. has made a hard push through Twitter and a podcast  \u2014   the Dale Jr. Download  \u2014   to keep people in the loop. It helped him recover from his injury. \u201cTo heal from the concussion, I needed to be   to get that stress as low as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cI worried a ton about people\u2019s perception about what my problem was. I didn\u2019t want any guesses out there. That\u2019s the reason I was so transparent. I was worried about, Is it O. K. I\u2019m this transparent? But I couldn\u2019t think of any reason it could blow up in my face. The only thing that was bad about it, I guess, is that anytime anybody doesn\u2019t agree with you, they hit you with, \u2018You hit your head, so you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u2019 \u201d He smiled. Although he has continued to emphasize that concussion symptoms can differ from one person to another, he knew his Twitter feed, podcast and news conferences could provide more information about concussions. He is fine with becoming a case study. \u201cWhen I got my first concussion, in 1998, it was like, Wow. I feel dizzy, ha ha. I think I\u2019ll go home and lay on the couch,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was almost like I was braggadocios about it: \u2018Man, I\u2019m tough. I hit my head on the car.\u2019 \u201cIt\u2019s scary now, knowing everything we know. There\u2019s still a ton to learn. We\u2019re going through such a transition how we talk about concussions, how we treat concussions. It\u2019s very interesting to me. Very educational. \u201d Just last week, Nascar announced an update to its concussion protocol. The protocol now requires doctors at every venue to use the same concussion test, expands when drivers must visit the infield care center after an accident and increases the use of   neurological consultants. After driving 600 to 800 laps after he was cleared medically, Earnhardt said he felt comfortable in a racecar now and was eager to see how he would do on Sunday. His career hung in the balance for a while last summer, so he is grateful for another chance to race. \u201cWhen you\u2019re young and na\u00efve, you\u2019re doing it for certain reasons, but when you get older and understand your life and what you want to be doing down the road, your priorities all change,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it was not fun, I wouldn\u2019t be doing it. I\u2019ve done well with my finances. I don\u2019t need to be racing for money. I don\u2019t know what we get paid for each race. I don\u2019t know what the winner gets for the Daytona 500  \u2014   no idea. It\u2019s just a great job. It\u2019s better than any other job I can think of right now. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563901.7721562}
