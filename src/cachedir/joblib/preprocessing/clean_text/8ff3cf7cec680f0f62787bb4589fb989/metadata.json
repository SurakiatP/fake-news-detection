While softening demands that Britain formally file for divorce swiftly following last Thursday\u2019s shocking referendum result, leaders of the European Union\u2019s 27 other nations made it clear to Prime Minister David Cameron that his country would not enjoy the benefits of membership  \u2014   like access to Europe\u2019s single market  \u2014   while sloughing off its burdens. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, speaking at a   news conference, took a hard position, saying that her country would defend its economic priorities and that Britain must use an agreed legal procedure to leave the European Union. \u201cThe discussion today reflected very clearly that everyone felt this was a sea change, a watershed moment, a historic moment,\u201d Mrs. Merkel said. The goal was to reshape the relationship with Britain \u201cas a relationship of friendship,\u201d she said, but \u201cwe will also be guided by our own interests. \u201d Referring to the terrorist attack on Tuesday  at Istanbul\u2019s Ataturk Airport, she said a world \u201ccharacterized by turmoil and turbulences\u201d was \u201cnot waiting for the European Union to make up its mind,\u201d an apparent reference to uncertainty over its relations with Britain and the future direction of what began as a peace project after World War II and has since grown into the world\u2019s biggest economic bloc. Mark Rutte, the prime minister of the Netherlands, historically one of Britain\u2019s closest allies in pushing Europe to focus on strengthening market forces and protecting sovereign rights, said the economic and political mayhem caused by Britain\u2019s vote to leave should deter others. \u201cTo everybody thinking of leaving the single market, this is what happens,\u201d he said. The turmoil has stirred hope in some quarters that Britain might, in the end, never take the next, formal step to leave the European Union. Ms. Merkel, however, dismissed this as \u201cimpossible. \u201d As to whether Britain could hold another referendum with a different outcome, she said that was highly unlikely. \u201cAs of tonight I do not see any possibility to reverse this decision,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is not the hour for wishful thinking. \u201d Mr. Cameron, attending what will probably be his last European summit meeting in Brussels, also stressed that there was no turning back from last week\u2019s vote in favor of Brexit, as Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the union is known. \u201cI am sorry we lost the referendum but you have to accept the result of the British people, you have to accept the verdict,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI\u2019m a democrat. \u201d While calling for \u201cthe closest possible relationship\u201d with Europe in the future, he acknowledged that \u201cit is impossible to have all of the benefits of membership without some of the costs of membership. \u201d Mr. Cameron, who has said he will resign by October, has left the task of setting the terms of the departure settlement to his successor, who will be responsible for invoking an exit clause, Article 50, in a European treaty and starting negotiations with Brussels on disentangling a formal relationship that began in 1973. France and other countries have complained that this would only create months of uncertainty and stoke unease for financial markets. But there seemed to be more sympathy on Tuesday for Britain\u2019s hesitant pace. \u201cIf they need more time we have to wait. This is the only legal way we have,\u201d Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, which represents European governments, told reporters. Beyond dealing with the mechanics of Britain\u2019s exit, however, European Union members face an even tougher challenge in trying to dampen rising populist sentiment elsewhere, while somehow rebuilding the cornerstone of Europe\u2019s peace and relative prosperity for more than 60 years. How to do this will be the focus of the second day of the summit meeting on Wednesday  \u2014   from which Mr. Cameron is excluded. The shock vote in Britain has done more than embolden populists who denounce the European Union as a distant and meddling force. It has resurfaced deep bitterness and anger left by earlier crises, notably a grinding economic slowdown and an uncontrolled influx of migrants across Europe\u2019s open borders. Instead of dealing with just the crisis of confidence set off by the vote for Brexit, leaders are effectively confronting all the crises of recent years at one time. Still unresolved are arguments over austerity, the   prescription for a financial crisis that began in Greece in 2008, and whether the European Union should be merely a   zone or the locomotive of a more ambitious program of \u201cever closer union,\u201d a cause enshrined in the 1957 Treaty of Rome. Arriving for the summit meeting, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of Greece  \u2014   whose country voted in a referendum last year to reject a financial bailout offered by Brussels only to accept even harsher terms to avoid expulsion from Europe\u2019s common currency  \u2014   described the British referendum result as a \u201csad   call\u201d that should force the European Union to abandon policies of austerity and \u201cendless negotiations behind closed doors. \u201d At the European Parliament early on Tuesday, a debate on Britain\u2019s referendum result produced raucous scenes as Nigel Farage, a British member of the assembly and a driving force behind the Brexit campaign, traded insults and mockery with fellow legislators and the president of the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive arm,   Juncker, who demanded to know: \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Mindful that Europe\u2019s identity crisis is unlikely to be settled anytime soon, the leaders of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia urged the European Union to \u201cget back to basics\u201d and focus on reinforcing freedoms and building a single market. \u201cInstead of endless theoretical debates on \u2018more Europe\u2019 or \u2018less Europe\u2019 we need to focus on \u2018better Europe,\u2019\u201d the leaders of the four countries, all formerly communist, said in a statement. What this \u201cbetter Europe\u201d  \u2014   a popular slogan now used by politicians who agree on little else  \u2014   would look like exactly is unclear. What is clear, however, is that skepticism over the European Union as it works now is on the rise. A spring survey by the Pew Research Center found that while support for the bloc remains strong in Poland and Hungary, which have benefited greatly from infusions of funds from Brussels, just 27 percent of Greek, 38 percent of French and 47 percent of Spanish citizens hold a favorable view. Positive views of the European Union fell, often substantially, in five of the six countries surveyed by Pew in both 2015 and 2016. Even Germany, where strong support for the   European project had been an unwavering feature of postwar politics, euroskepticism is on the rise, with 48 percent of those polled saying they had an unfavorable view of the bloc. Speaking as he arrived for the summit meeting, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France said the situation today in the United Kingdom, with political turmoil, a plunging currency and credit rating downgrades, should alert other Europeans of the need to stick together. \u201cMany people today are asking the same question,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat do we do if confronted by the same choice\u201d British voters faced. The question of when Britain will invoke Article 50, opening negotiations, has dominated discussion in London and some other capitals, but has left some leaders cold. \u201cI think it\u2019s utterly disappointing that, when we are faced with the biggest political crisis in the history of the European Union, what\u2019s grabbing the headlines is the obscure Article 50,\u201d Joseph Muscat, the prime minister of Malta, said in Brussels. The far more important issue, he said, is \u201cthat this is a Europe that people are feeling increasingly estranged from and that it is our duty that we take action. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562701.924285}
