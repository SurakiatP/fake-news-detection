[The Muslim Brotherhood openly seeks to establish a worldwide Islamic caliphate based on Sharia law. While many Brotherhood wings reject the use of violence as a strategic tactic, preferring instead a sophisticated gradualist strategy to achieve their aims, the Brotherhood has spawned terrorist organizations  \u2014   most notably Hamas  \u2014   that adhere to its philosophy of a world order based on Islam. The Brotherhood was also a central player in the   Arab Spring, revolutions punctuated by violence across the Arab world.  Designating the Brotherhood a terrorist organization would add the U. S. to the growing list of nations to do so, including Muslim countries like Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The Times\u2019 propagation of the Brotherhood culminated in an editorial board piece published Thursday titled, \u201cAll of Islam Isn\u2019t the Enemy. \u201d In the editorial, the newspaper warned designating the Brotherhood as a terrorist organization \u201cwould be seen by many Muslims as another attempt to vilify adherents of Islam. \u201d  The paper claimed that the possible designation \u201cappears to be part of a mission by the president and his closest advisers to heighten fears by promoting a dangerously exaggerated vision of an America under siege by what they call radical Islam. \u201d The Times\u2019 advocacy for the Brotherhood is particularly noteworthy since it separately posted a full Arabic document from 1991 in which an Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood member set forth a strategy for \u201celiminating and destroying the Western civilization from within,\u201d with emphasis on operations inside the U. S. In Thursday\u2019s editorial, the newspaper laid out its case for the Brotherhood: There are good reasons that the Brotherhood, with millions of members, doesn\u2019t merit the terrorist designation. Rather than a single organization, it is a collection of groups and movements that can vary widely from country to country. While the Brotherhood calls for a society governed by Islamic law, it renounced violence decades ago, has supported elections and has become a political and social organization. Its branches often have tenuous connections to the original movement founded in Egypt in 1928. Addressing the Brotherhood\u2019s support for the electoral process and purportedly becoming a political organization, an extensive report on the Brotherhood by the Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center at Israel\u2019s Center for Special Studies explained the group\u2019s use of some tools of democracy to advance the aim of achieving a world ruled by Sharia law, which is by definition  . Drawing from founding Brotherhood documents and original literature by Brotherhood leaders, the Center explained: Unlike the militant factions of other Islamist movements, which completely rule out democracy on the basis of it being a Western, pagan, and ignorant idea, the Muslim Brotherhood does use the term \u201cdemocracy. \u201d In its view, however, it has two main connotations: a tactical, instrumental means of taking over countries through the use of the democratic process, and an \u201cIslamic democracy\u201d based on Sharia law (i. e. Islamic religious law) and a model of internal consultation within the leadership, [Brotherhood Founder Sheikh Hassan]   listed seven stages to achieve these objectives, each to be carried out in a gradual fashion. The stages are divided into social and political: the first three are based on educating the individual, the family, and the entire society of the Muslim world to implement Sharia laws in every aspect of daily life. The next four stages are political in nature, and include assuming power through elections, shaping a Sharia state, liberating Islamic countries from the burden of (physical and ideological) foreign occupation, uniting them into one Islamic entity (\u201cnew caliphate\u201d) and spreading Islamic values throughout the world. Sharia law is explicitly  . For example, under Sharia,   cannot rule over Muslims a Caliph can come to rule through force and seizure of power a woman inherits half that of a man and   cannot inherit from Muslims. In the Times editorial, meanwhile, the newspaper claimed that those \u201cadvising Mr. Trump seem unwilling to draw distinctions\u201d between the Brotherhood and its violent adherents. The paper continued: Stephen Bannon, the chief White House strategist, once called the Brotherhood \u201cthe foundation of modern terrorism. \u201d And Frank Gaffney Jr. an   analyst who heads a small think tank, recently told the Times that the Brotherhood\u2019s goals are \u201cexactly the same\u201d as those of the Islamic State and Al Qaeda. Both of these statements are true. The Brotherhood\u2019s historic ideological principles of establishing a worldwide Caliphate are indeed shared by the Islamic State and   although their tactics greatly differ. And Brotherhood ideology has served as the foundation for groups like  . The defining works of Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood leader, ideologue and theorist Sayyid Qutb, considered the Brotherhood\u2019s intellectual godfather, greatly influenced Osama bin Laden and   doctrine. An extensive March 23, 2003, article in the New York Times magazine by Paul Berman dissected Qutb\u2019s writings as they relate to terrorist ideology. In the article titled \u201cThe Philosopher of Islamic Terror,\u201d Berman documented the centrality of Qutb\u2019s influence on  : The organization ( ) was created in the late 1980\u2019s by an affiliation of three armed factions  \u2014   bin Laden\u2019s circle of \u201dAfghan\u201d Arabs, together with two factions from Egypt, the Islamic Group and Egyptian Islamic Jihad, the latter led by Dr. Ayman   Al Qaeda\u2019s top theoretician. The Egyptian factions emerged from an older current, a school of thought from within Egypt\u2019s fundamentalist movement, the Muslim Brotherhood, in the 1950\u2019s and 60\u2019s. And at the heart of that single school of thought stood, until his execution in 1966, a philosopher named Sayyid Qutb  \u2014   the intellectual hero of every one of the groups that eventually went into Al Qaeda, their Karl Marx (to put it that way) their guide. In recent days, the Times has featured numerous other articles arguing against branding the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization. An article on Tuesday warned, \u201cOfficially designating the Brotherhood as a terrorist organization would roil American relations in the Middle East. The leaders of some American allies  \u2014   like Egypt, where the military forced the Brotherhood from power in 2013, and the United Arab Emirates  \u2014   have pressed Mr. Trump to do so to quash internal enemies, but the group remains a pillar of society in parts of the region. \u201d \u201cCritics said they feared that Mr. Trump\u2019s team wanted to create a legal justification to crack down on Muslim charities, mosques and other groups in the United States,\u201d added the Times. \u201cA terrorist designation would freeze assets, block visas and ban financial interactions. \u201d A Times article on February 1 was titled, \u201cTrump Pushes Dark View of Islam to Center of U. S.  . \u201d The article lamented a worldview that \u201cconflates terrorist groups like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State with largely nonviolent groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood and its offshoots and, at times, with the 1. 7 billion Muslims around the world. \u201d A January 26 editorial titled \u201c\u2018I Think Islam Hates Us\u2019\u201d informed readers the Trump administration \u201creportedly is considering designating the Muslim Brotherhood, which is involved in Muslim politics in a number of countries, as a terrorist organization. Some experts see the move as a chance for the Trump administration to limit Muslim political activity in the United States. \u201d  Aaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.
