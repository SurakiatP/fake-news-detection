Read more Russia withdraws request for carrier battle group to refuel in Spain amid NATO pressure on Madrid \\n\u201cToday, the Spanish authorities told [Russian Defense Ministry] that Russian vessels\u2019 call at the Ceuta port is inappropriate due to the pressure on Spain exerted by the US and NATO,\u201d Konashenkov said, adding that \u201cthis situation in no way affects the mission plan of the naval group.\u201d \\nEarlier on Wednesday there were reports, citing embassy sources, that Russia withdrew a request for its aircraft carrier group to be refueled at the Ceuta port after top NATO and EU officials expressed anger at Spain\u2019s reported decision to allow the stopover. \\nThe Russian embassy in Spain says that its statement was misinterpreted. There were \u201cmost diverse media interpretations of the Russian embassy\u2019s statement\u2026 concerning the Russian naval group in the Mediterranean,\u201d Vasily Nioradze, a spokesman of the Russian embassy in Madrid, told RT, adding that \u201cin fact, Russian mission informed the Spanish side that Russian vessels would not stop at the Ceuta port as the plans have changed.\u201d \\n\u201cIt was just a routine procedure of mutual information-sharing,\u201d he stressed. \\nA barrage of harsh criticism from the NATO officials and some European politicians followed Spanish media reports that Russia\u2019s naval battle group would make a stopover in Ceuta after passing the Straits of Gibraltar. \\nCeuta, the autonomous Spanish port located on the tip of Africa\u2019s northern coast not far from the Straits of Gibraltar, has an unresolved status within NATO. It is, however, considered EU territory. Since 2011, Spain has allowed 57 Russian warships to refuel at the enclave. \\nThe mission of the Admiral Kuznetsov carrier group earlier triggered a media frenzy across Europe alongside with the nervous reaction from some European countries\u2019 military as British, Norwegian, and Dutch navies sending frigates and surveillance vessels to shadow the Russian warships on their way through international waters. \\nAccording to the Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry, the ships were sent to the Syrian coast to provide backup for the naval group already deployed in the area.'"}, "time": 1742561932.659304}
