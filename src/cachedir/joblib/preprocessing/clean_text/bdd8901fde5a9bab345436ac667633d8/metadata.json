[On Saturday, former President Obama\u2019s spokesman Kevin Lewis denied that the former White House or the former President himself would have given such an order to wiretap Trump Tower \u2014  or any other type of surveillance in any case \u2014  but that such an order would have come from an \u201cindependent investigation led by the Department of Justice. \u201d  \u201cA cardinal rule of the Obama Administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cAs part of that practice, neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U. S. citizen. Any suggestion otherwise is simply false. \u201d Lewis\u2019 statement on the former president\u2019s behalf came in response to the explosive charges from President Donald Trump, who tweeted on Saturday morning that the Obama team conducted surveillance on Trump Tower during the campaign and afterward. Valerie Jarrett, another close Obama aide, also tweeted the statement from former President Obama\u2019s spokesman, Lewis. Jarrett is, according to the U. K. Daily Mail, now living in the Obamas\u2019 multimillion dollar Washington, D. C. mansion. From there, the Daily Mail reports, the former president and Jarrett will be running a \u201cnerve center for their plan to mastermind the insurgency against President Trump. \u201d Check out statement from Kevin Lewis, spokesperson to former President Obama. Enough said. pic. twitter.   \u2014   Valerie Jarrett (@ValerieJarrett) March 4, 2017,  Interestingly, however, a number of other former Obama administration officials do not deny that such a wiretap existed. They just deny that the White House or Obama himself would have approved it or ordered it, and say that the Department of Justice would have sought it in consultation with a foreign intelligence surveillance, or FISA, court. Obama\u2019s former speechwriter Jon Favreau tweeted that he would warn reporters against saying there was no wiretap. I\u2019d be careful about reporting that Obama said there was no wiretapping. Statement just said that neither he nor the WH ordered it.  \u2014   Jon Favreau (@jonfavs) March 4, 2017,  And Favreau endorsed a Twitter feed that laid out the reporting about the existence of the wiretaps, which cited reporting from Louise Mensch, formerly of Heat Street, and The Guardian that the Obama DOJ had sought a FISA court approved surveillance warrant for Trump Tower back in the summer of 2016 that was denied but received a narrower focused warrant in October. Ok you definitely need to read this thread https:  .   \u2014   Jon Favreau (@jonfavs) March 4, 2017,    The wiretaps that Donald Trump \u201djust found out\u201d about have been reported for weeks. I\u2019m going to summarize here some of the discussion.  \u2014   Justin Hendrix (@justinhendrix) March 4, 2017,    @LouiseMensch broke the news for @heatstreet that a FISA warrant was granted to explore Donald\u2019s Russia Ties https:  .  pic. twitter.   \u2014   Justin Hendrix (@justinhendrix) March 4, 2017,    The @guardian\u2019s @julianborger reported on the FISA warrant again when the Steele dossier news broke in January https:  .  pic. twitter.   \u2014   Justin Hendrix (@justinhendrix) March 4, 2017,    Republicans who have defended surveillance powers are now critical of it especially following Flynn\u2019s resignation https:  .  pic. twitter.   \u2014   Justin Hendrix (@justinhendrix) March 4, 2017,    And just this week Donald\u2019s administration announced it had no intention of curtailing FISA https:  .  pic. twitter.   \u2014   Justin Hendrix (@justinhendrix) March 4, 2017,    When @LouiseMensch reported on the FISA tap, she included details that implicated Putin\u2019s own daughters, Carter Page and Paul Manafort. pic. twitter.   \u2014   Justin Hendrix (@justinhendrix) March 4, 2017,    This week @SenCoonsOffice suggested the transcripts that the FBI has may prove collusion with Russia. https:  .   \u2014   Justin Hendrix (@justinhendrix) March 4, 2017,    Coons has been one of the staunchest critics of surveillance powers, having introduced bills to reign in FISA https:  .   \u2014   Justin Hendrix (@justinhendrix) March 4, 2017,    Back to Donald. Wiretapping him was not illegal, full stop. And it suggests the court had reason to permit it. https:  .   \u2014   Justin Hendrix (@justinhendrix) March 4, 2017,    Donald\u2019s tweets this morning are a helpful reminder that he was under investigation, possibly for espionage. https:  .   \u2014   Justin Hendrix (@justinhendrix) March 4, 2017,    We can now conclude that our govt has significant intelligence on Donald and his associates. We need to see it. https:  .   \u2014   Justin Hendrix (@justinhendrix) March 4, 2017,    Donald can whine about being surveilled, but the reality is we citizens must now demand a special prosecutor and a select committee.  \u2014   Justin Hendrix (@justinhendrix) March 4, 2017,    Interesting   Donald\u2019s tweets this morning may have in fact declassified the existence of the wiretap https:  .   \u2014   Justin Hendrix (@justinhendrix) March 4, 2017,    @NRO\u2019s @AndrewCMcCarthy \u2014   a former terrorism   considered the implications of using FISA to tap Trump. https:  .  pic. twitter.   \u2014   Justin Hendrix (@justinhendrix) March 4, 2017,  David Axelrod, another former Obama adviser, tweeted that such a wiretap would receive court approval \u201cfor a reason. \u201d If there were the wiretap @realDonaldTrump loudly alleges, such an extraordinary warrant would only have been OKed by a court for a reason.  \u2014   David Axelrod (@davidaxelrod) March 4, 2017,  In other words, these   officials are subtly confirming the accuracy of the reporting \u2014  that the Obama administration did in fact conduct surveillance on Trump Tower in October and   and that the administration originally sought a warrant back in the summer of 2016 \u2014  but they say the president himself and the Obama White House was not involved in the decision. What\u2019s more, Philip Rucker, the White House bureau chief at the Washington Post, says the same thing as these former Obama officials: That the Obama spokesman\u2019s statement does not deny the existence of wiretaps on Trump Tower, only that Obama himself and the Obama White House did not approve them if they did exist. The Obama statement does not say there was no federal wire tapping of Trump Tower. It only says Obama and White House didn\u2019t order it.  \u2014   Philip Rucker (@PhilipRucker) March 4, 2017,  The outrage from the media and the Democrats appears to be standard hatred of Trump. The president forced a set of facts into the news cycle that was already previously public but framed in a way that puts his political opponents and the establishment media on the defensive. This appears to be the calculus: either the wiretaps exist, as Trump suggests, and the president will use them to bludgeon the Obama administration and the media for impropriety and overreach or, there were no wiretaps, which suggests the previous administration had no reason to suspect Trump colluded with a foreign government.'"}, "time": 1742564045.6199987}
