Bashar al-Assad says if Donald Trump fights terrorism he will be a natural ally for Syria alongside Russia and Iran \\n\\nFollowing is the full text; \\nQuestion 1 : Mr. President, let\u2019s start with Aleppo if you don\u2019t mind. There are still thousands of civilians trapped, trying to survive in a sort of sub-human conditions in the middle of a deluge of bombs. Why do you think that they refused to get out? \\nPresident Assad : The part that you mention in Aleppo, what they call it the eastern part, is occupied by the terrorists for the last three years, and they have been using the civilians as human shields. From our side, from our part as government, we have two missions: the first one is to fight those terrorists to liberate that area and the civilians from those terrorists, and at the same time to try to find a solution to evacuate that area from those terrorists if they accept, let\u2019s say, what you call it reconciliation option, in which they either give up their armaments for amnesty, or they leave that area. The other thing we did as government is to open gates for the civilians to leave that area, and at the same time for the humanitarian convoys and help to go through those gates inside that part of Aleppo, but the terrorists publicly refused any solution, so they wanted to keep the situation as it is. \\nQuestion 2 : But Mr. President, aren\u2019t you using the jihadists to discredit all the oppositions at the eyes of the national and international public opinion, and in the end to try to wipe them all out? \\nPresident Assad: No, we cannot do that for a very simple reason: because we\u2019ve been dealing with this kind of terrorism since the fifties, since the Muslim Brotherhood came to Syria at that time, and we learned that lesson very well, especially in the eighties, that terrorists cannot be used as a political card, you cannot put it in your pocket, because it\u2019s like a scorpion; it will bite you someday. So, we cannot use jihadists because it\u2019s like shooting yourself in the foot. They\u2019re going to be against you sooner or later. This is in a pragmatic way, but if you think as value, we wouldn\u2019t do it. Using terrorism or jihadists or extremists for any political agenda is immoral. \\nQuestion 3: But Mr. President, the people, the civilians inside Aleppo, couldn\u2019t we assume that they probably don\u2019t trust the government, they don\u2019t trust the army, that they just want democracy, dignity, freedom? Can you give that to them? \\nPresident Assad: Let\u2019s talk about this point, regarding the reality; since the beginning of the crisis, since the terrorists started to control some areas within Syria, the majority of the Syrian civilians left that areas to join the government areas, not vice versa. If the majority of the Syrians don\u2019t trust the government, they should go the other way. \\nLet me tell you another example, which is a starker example. You were in Daraya, al-Muadamiya, a few days ago, when you came here, and the terrorists and militants who left that area to Idleb in the northern part of Syria to join their fellow terrorists, they left their families under the supervision of the government, and you can go and visit them now, if you want. \\nQuestion 4: Mr. President, I\u2019ve been here first four years ago, and now. Are you winning the war, this war in Syria? \\nPresident Assad: We can say, you can win the war only when you restore stability in Syria. You cannot talk about winning the war as long as there\u2019s killing and destruction on daily basis. That doesn\u2019t mean we are losing the war; the army is making good advancement on daily basis against the terrorists. Of course, they still have the support of Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and some Western countries including the United States, but the only option that we have in that regard is to win. If you don\u2019t win and the terrorists win, Syria wouldn\u2019t exist anymore. \\nQuestion 5: But would you have done that also without Hezbollah, Iran, and Russia? \\nPresident Assad: They are here because they could offer very essential and important help, because the situation that we are facing now is not only about a few terrorists from within Syria; it\u2019s like international war against Syria. Those terrorists have been supported by tens of foreign countries, so Syria alone wouldn\u2019t be able to face this kind of war without the help of its friends. That\u2019s why their existence and their support was very essential. \\nQuestion 6: Isn\u2019t Mr. Putin your most important ally? \\nPresident Assad: Russia is very important, Iran is very important, Hezbollah is very important. All of them are important. Each one made important achievements against the terrorists in Syria, so it\u2019s difficult to say who is more important than the other. \\nJournalist : But what\u2019s the role of Russia in Syria nowadays? \\nPresident Assad : The most important part of their support is the aerial support, which is very essential, they have very strong firepower, and at the same time they are the main supply of our army for more than sixty years, so our army depends on the Russian support in different military domains. \\nQuestion 7: But are you free to decide the future of Syria, or are you dependent on Vladimir Putin\u2019s strategies? \\nPresident Assad: No, first of all, we are fully free, not partially, fully free, in everything related to the future of Syria. Second, which is more important or as important as the first part or the first factor, that the Russians always base their policies on values, and these values are the sovereignty of other countries, the international law, respecting other people, other cultures, so they don\u2019t interfere in whatever is related to the future of Syria or the Syrian people. \\nQuestion 8 : But they have helped you quite a few times in the United Nations. They have vetoed a few resolutions condemning your government, and the Syrian Army. There are several reports regarding Syria for use of chemical weapons, human right abuses, war crimes. All of this in the framework of the United Nations. \\nPresident Assad: And many ask \u201cwhat for?\u201d I mean, what\u2019s in return, what did they ask in return, that\u2019s the question, actually, that\u2019s the content of your question, because we heard it many times, whether in the media or directly. Actually, first of all, for their values, because in these values that I\u2019m talking about, the value of international law, and they have their interest as well. I mean, fighting the terrorists in Syria is not only in the interest of Syria or the Syrian people; in the interest of the Middle East, of Europe itself \u2013 something that many officials in the West don\u2019t see or don\u2019t realize or don\u2019t acknowledge \u2013 and in the interest of the Russian people, because they have been facing terrorists for decades now. So, the Russians are fighting for us, for the world, and for their self. \\nQuestion 9: But when you speak about values, democracy is a value. \\nPresident Assad: Of course. \\nJournalist : Freedom is a value. \\nPresident Assad: Of course. \\nQuestion 10: Can you say that Syria is a democracy, like the Western standards? \\nPresident Assad: The only one who can fight for these values like democracy and freedoms are the people of any country or any society, not the foreigners. Foreigners cannot bring freedom, cannot bring democracy, because this is related to the culture, to the different factors that affect or influence that society. You cannot bring it, you cannot import it. You cannot import anything from outside your country regarding the future of your country. \\nQuestion 11: But would you define Syria as a democracy? \\nPresident Assad: No, we were on the way to democracy. We didn\u2019t say that we are fully democratic, we were on the way, we were moving forward. Slowly or fast, that\u2019s subjective, cannot be objective, that\u2019s always subjective. But we\u2019re moving forward in that regard, of course. But the criteria or the paradigm for us is not the West, not the Western paradigm, because the West has its own culture, we have our own culture, they have their own reality, we have our own reality. So, our democracy should reflect our culture and our habits and our customs and our reality at the same time. \\nQuestion 12 : I\u2019m sure that you know that there is a new Secretary-General of the United Nations. How do you look at him, Mr. Guterres, taking into the account his well-known humanitarian approach to the situation? \\nPresident Assad : Of course, I agree about the headline of this approach. I say \u201cheadline\u201d because you always \u2013 under the headline, you have many sub-headlines or different titles. When you talk about humanitarian, it doesn\u2019t only mean to offer the people the help, the food, their necessary needs for their life. The first thing, if you ask the Syrian refugees, for example, the first thing they want is to go back to their country. The first thing they want is to be able to live within Syria. That means help, humanitarian help, the way we understand it, food, medical care, any other, let\u2019s say, basics for the daily life. The second one is to have stability and to have security, which means humanitarian equals fighting terrorists. You cannot talk about humanitarian aid and supporting the terrorists at the same time. You cannot, you have to choose. And of course, I\u2019m not talking about him; I\u2019m talking about the countries that go to support his plan, because he needs the support of other countries, he cannot achieve that plan while many countries in the world are still supporting the terrorists in Syria. So, of course we support it, whether helping the people to live, to go back to their country, and to live in security without terrorists. \\nQuestion 13: He said already that peace in Syria is a priority. Are you available to talk with him, to work with him, for that purpose? \\nPresident Assad: Definitely, of course. It\u2019s his priority, and of course it\u2019s our priority, that\u2019s self-evident. It\u2019s not only our priority; it\u2019s a Middle Eastern priority, and when the Middle East is stable, the rest of the world is stable, because the Middle East is the heart of the world geographically and geopolitically, and Syria is the heart of the Middle East geographically and geopolitically. We are the fault line; if you don\u2019t deal with this fault line, you\u2019re going to have an earthquake, that\u2019s what we always said. That\u2019s why this priority is a hundred percent correct from our point of view, and we are ready to cooperate in any way to achieve stability in Syria, of course taking into consideration the interest of the country, and the will of the Syrian people. \\nQuestion 14: You said when we spoke that the United Nations are biased. You think with Mr. Guterres that can change a little bit? \\nPresident Assad: Everybody knows that the United Nations is not the Secretary-General; he has an important position, but the United Nations is the states within this organization, and to be frank, most of the people say only the five permanent members; this is the United Nations because they have the veto, they can do whatever they want and they can refuse whatever they want, and if there\u2019s a reform that is very much needed for this organization, they can make veto or they can move forward in that regard. But at the same time, the way he presented himself as Secretary-General is very important. If you ask me \u201cwhat do you expect from such a new official in that important position,\u201d I would say I need two things: the first one is to be objective in every statement he could make regarding any conflict around the world, including Syria. The second one, which is related and complimentary with the first one, is not to turn his office into a part or branch of the State Department of the United States. That\u2019s what we expect now. Of course, when he\u2019s objective, he can play an important role in dealing with different officials in the United Nations in order to bring the policies of the different states \u2013 mainly Russia and the United States \u2013 toward more cooperation and more stability regarding Syria. \\nQuestion 15: But regarding Syria, there are a lot agendas: Qatar, Turkey, Russia, United States, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. How is it possible to try to find that peace process with so many agendas? \\nPresident Assad: Without bringing all those countries and the different factors in one direction, of course it\u2019s going to be difficult. That\u2019s why I always say the Syrian problem as isolated case, as Syrian case, is not very complicated. What makes it complicated is the interference from the outside, especially the Western interference because it\u2019s against the will of the Syrian government, while the intervention of the Russians, Iranians, and Hezbollah is because of the invitation of the Syrian government. So, his role as Secretary-General in bringing all these powers together is very essential` and we hope he can succeed, it\u2019s not easy of course. \\nQuestion 16: Let me pick out Turkey; their army is in your country, their President said last week that their interests lies beyond the natural borders; he referred to Mosul and Aleppo. Do you accept this? \\nPresident Assad: Of course not. You\u2019re talking about sick person; he\u2019s megalomaniac President, he is not stable. He lives during the Ottoman era, he doesn\u2019t live in the current time. He\u2019s out of touch with the reality. \\nQuestion 17: But how you are going to do with their army inside your country? \\nPresident Assad: It\u2019s our right to defend it; it\u2019s invasion. It\u2019s our right to defend our country against any kind of invasion. But let\u2019s be realistic, every terrorist came to Syria, he came through Turkey with the support of Erdogan. So, fighting those terrorists is like fighting the army of Erdogan, not the Turkish army, the army of Erdogan. \\nQuestion 18 : But it\u2019s a NATO country, are you aware of that? \\nPresident Assad: Yeah, of course. Whether it is a NATO country or not, it doesn\u2019t have the right to invade any other country according to the international law or to any other moral value. \\nQuestion 19: Mr. President, America\u2019s new elected President, what do you expect of Donald J. Trump? \\nPresident Assad : We don\u2019t have a lot of expectations because the American administration is not only about the President; it\u2019s about different powers within this administration, the different lobbies that they are going to influence any President. So, we have to wait and see when he embarks his new mission, let\u2019s say, or position within this administration as President in two months\u2019 time. But we always say we have wishful thinking that the Unites States would be unbiased, respect the international law, doesn\u2019t interfere in other countries around the world, and of course to stop supporting terrorists in Syria. \\nQuestion 20: But he said in an interview that he seems to be ready to work with you in the fight against the Islamic State or ISIL, are you ready for such a move? \\nPresident Assad: Of course, I would say this is promising, but can he deliver? Can he go in that regard? What about the countervailing forces within the administration, the mainstream media that were against him? How can he deal with it? That\u2019s why for us it\u2019s still dubious whether he can do or live up to his promises or not. That\u2019s why we are very cautious in judging him, especially as he wasn\u2019t in a political position before. So, we cannot tell anything about what he\u2019s going to do, but if, let\u2019s say if he is going to fight the terrorists, of course we are going to be ally, natural ally in that regard with the Russian, with the Iranian, with many other countries who wanted to defeat the terrorists. \\nQuestion 21: So, you will cooperate with the Americans in the fight against terrorists? \\nPresident Assad: Of course, definitely, if they are genuine, if they have the will, and if they have the ability, of course we are the first ones to fight the terrorists because we suffered more than any other one in this world from terrorists. \\nQuestion 22: So, cooperate with the Americans that are now supporting the Kurds, the YPG that are trying to get into Raqqa? \\nPresident Assad: When you talk about cooperation, it means cooperation between two legal governments, not cooperation between foreign government and any faction within Syria. Any cooperation that doesn\u2019t go through the Syrian government is not legal. If it\u2019s not legal, we cannot cooperate with, and we don\u2019t recognize and we don\u2019t accept. \\nQuestion 23 : Anyway, the Vice President, Mr. Pence, said that he has admitted the use of military force to prevent your military force from a humanitarian crisis in Aleppo, how do you look at it? \\nPresident Assad: This is against the international law again, and that\u2019s the problem with the American position; they think that they are the police of the world. They think they are the judge of the world; they\u2019re not. They are sovereign country, they are an independent country, but this is their limit; they don\u2019t have to interfere in any other country. Because of this interference for the last fifty years, that\u2019s why they are very good only in creating problems, not in solving problems. That\u2019s the problem with the American role. That\u2019s why I said we don\u2019t pin a lot of hopes of changing administrations because that context has been going on for more than fifty years now, and that\u2019s expected. If they want to continue in the same position of the United States creating problems around the world, that\u2019s what they have to do: only interfering in the matters of other nations. \\nQuestion 24: But returning to what the President, the newly elected American President said about cooperating with your government in the fight against Islamic State, do you expect a change also within European countries? \\nPresident Assad: Regarding fighting terrorism, we are ready to cooperate with anyone in this world with no conditions. That\u2019s crux of our policy, not today, not yesterday; for years, even before the war on Syria, we always said that. In the eighties, we asked for international coalition against terrorism after the Muslim Brotherhood crisis in Syria when they started killing, of course they were defeated at that time. We asked for the same thing. So, this is a long-term policy that we base our policy on for years now. \\nQuestion 25: One last question. Mr. President, I need really to ask you this, because after all these years, do you still reject any responsibility for what happened in your country? \\nPresident Assad: No, I never rejected any responsibility, but that depends on the decision. When you talk about responsibility, you ask yourself what are the decisions that you take in order to deal with the crisis. Did the President order anyone to kill civilians, did he order the destruction, did he order supporting terrorism in his country? Of course not. My decision was, and the decision of the different institutions, and the decision of the different officials in Syria \u2013 I\u2019m on top of them \u2013 was to have dialogue, to fight terrorists, and to reform as a response at the very beginning, response to the allegations, let\u2019s say, at that time, that they needed reform in Syria, we responded. So, that\u2019s the decision that I took. Would you say, or would anyone say that fighting terrorism is wrong? Making dialogue is wrong? Making reform is wrong? Protecting the civilians and liberating areas from terrorists is wrong? Of course not. So, there\u2019s a difference between responsibility of the policy and responsibility of the practice. In any practice, you have malpractice, that\u2019s another issue. When you talk about state and President, you always talk about the decisions and the policy. \\nJournalist: Thank you for being with RTP Mr. President. \\nPresident Assad : Thanks for you. \\n '"}, "time": 1742628600.2755103}
