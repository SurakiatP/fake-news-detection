Trump, as well as his campaign and advisors, to intimidate and discourage minority voters from voting in the 2016 Presidential Election. Trump has falsely and repeatedly told his supporters that the November 8 election will be \u2018rigged\u2019 based upon fabricated claims of voter fraud in \u2018certain areas\u2019 or \u2018certain sections\u2019 of key states. Unsurprisingly, those \u2018certain areas\u2019 are exclusively communities in which large minority voting populations reside.\u201d \\nThe document goes on to name some of the specific quotes and directives that Donald Trump has given supporters. It also mentions that: \u201cFollowing the third presidential debate, Trump\u2019s campaign manager told a reporter that the campaign was working to combat purported voter fraud by \u2018actively working with the national committee, the official party, and campaign lawyers to monitor precincts around the country.'\u201d \\nThis shows that the RNC is involved in this effort, which has already begun . Trump ally Roger Stone organized \u201cVote Protectors,\u201d who are instructed to conduct \u201cexit polls.\u201d Initially, the volunteers were asked to upload video of voters, create ID badges and wear red shirts at specific polling places. After journalistic inquiry , Stone said he would change his tactics. He simply created a new website, but that\u2019s another story. \\nThe Democratic National Committee is going after Trump and the RNC for violation of a consent decree signed in 1982. At that time, the RNC was involved in voter suppression in targeted areas known to vote predominantly Democrat. They hired off-duty sheriffs and police officers to go to polling places in those areas displaying a sign stating \u201cThis area is being patrolled by the National Ballot Security Task Force.\u201d There were other activities, such as the challenge of individual voter registrations in certain communities. \\nThe consent decree forcing the RNC to cease its 1982 \u201cballot security\u201d activities resulted from a successful DNC suit. The decree expires next year. In the current suit, the DNC seeks to renew it for another eight years. \\n34 years later, we have an old tactic re-branded by the same party to do the same thing: intimidate minority voters. The DNC opens fire against RNC voter intimidation tactics \\nFeatured Image via screenshot from YouTube video Connect with me\""}, "time": 1742561882.35859}
