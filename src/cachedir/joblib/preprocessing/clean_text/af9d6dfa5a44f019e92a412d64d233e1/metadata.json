Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the Trump administration weighed the fact that concerns about Mike Flynn were coming from former acting Attorney General Sally Yates, \u201cwho is not exactly a supporter of the president\u2019s agenda. \u201d  Spicer said, \u201cOne thing that\u2019s important to note is \u2014  let\u2019s look at again how this came down. Someone who is not exactly a supporter of the president\u2019s agenda, who a couple days after this first conversation took place refused to uphold a lawful order of the president, who is not exactly someone that was excited about President Trump taking office or his agenda. \u201d \u201cShe had come here, given a   told us there were materials and at the same time, we did what we should do,\u201d he continued. \u201cJust because someone comes in and gives you a   about something and says I want to share some information doesn\u2019t mean you immediately jump the gun and go take an action.
