Hodgkinson opened fire on Republican House and Senate members who were practicing baseball. Rep. Steve Scalise ( ) and four others were injured in the attack. Hodgkinson was shot and killed by police.  SAF sent Breitbart News a statement on the attack: Today\u2019s shooting of Congressman Steve Scalise ( ) and others including an aide and two Capitol Police officers is the result of Democratic hate speech toward President Donald Trump and majority Republicans, the Second Amendment Foundation said today. \u201cThis hate speech that has been going on since Donald Trump was elected,\u201d said SAF founder and Executive Vice President Alan M. Gottlieb. \u201cIt gets their voter base agitated and this is what happens as a result. Is this just a coincidence this happened on the president\u2019s birthday?\u201d The gunman has been identified as James Hodgkinson of Illinois. A Facebook page belonging to the   suspect suggests that he was a socialist Democrat, and was a follower of Sen. Bernie Sanders. Sanders confirmed that Hodgkinson was apparently a volunteer in his 2016 presidential campaign. \u201cWhen liberal leftists support the assassination of President Trump on stage what do you expect to happen,\u201d Gottlieb stated. \u201cHate speech and actions incite this kind of violence. It is time for Democrats like Reps. Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi, Sen. Chuck Schumer, Barrack Obama and Hillary Clinton and many of the talking heads at CNN and MSNBC to shut up. \u201d SAF also observed: Congressman Scalise and others at the field this morning were lucky to have the protection of courageous Capitol police officers, the good guys with guns who took down a bad guy with a gun,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut what if they hadn\u2019t been present?\u201d Congressman Mike Bishop of Michigan, who was at the baseball field, told a reporter, \u201cThe only reason why any of us walked out of this thing, by the grace of God, one of the folks here had a weapon to fire back and give us a moment to find cover. \u201d \u201cMaybe now the   rights Democrats will support everyone\u2019s right to carry a firearm for \u201d Gottlieb said. \u201cWe are the first line of defense when it comes to personal protection from crazed individuals. \u201d Breitbart News spoke with SAF\u2019s Alan Gottlieb about the calls for more gun control that have already been made in reaction to the shooting. He responded, \u201cDemocrats should ban their hate speech, not our guns for  . \u201d AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.
