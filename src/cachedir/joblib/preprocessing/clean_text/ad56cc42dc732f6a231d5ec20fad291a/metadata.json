(I wonder if Trump has ever heard that expression about glass houses and throwing stones.) \\n\u201cThey accuse you or blame you for things you know aren\u2019t true.\u201d \\nFor example, accusing Hillary of laughing at a rape victim, which she didn\u2019t do . \\n\u201cThey make excuses for their behavior, try to blame others, and have difficulty apologizing.\u201d \\nLike the \u201clocker room talk\u201d apology t hat wasn\u2019t. Tilting At Women, an OtherWords cartoon by Khalil Bendib. \\n\u201cThey call you names, give you unpleasant labels, or make cutting remarks under their breath.\u201d \\nRemember Trump\u2019s use of pejoratives like Crooked Hillary, Lyin\u2019 Ted Cruz, Little Marco Rubio, Low Energy Jeb Bush, and \u201cPocahontas\u201d? (That last one refers to Elizabeth Warren.) There\u2019s even a Donald Trump insult generator online based on the candidate\u2019s penchant for name-calling. \\n\u201cThey make subtle threats or negative remarks with the intent to frighten or control you. \u201c \\nIn the second debate: \u201cYou\u2019d be in jail,\u201d Donald threatened Hillary, if he becomes president. \\n\u201cThey play the victim and try to deflect blame to you rather than taking personal responsibility.\u201d \\nAfter the 2005 video of Trump boasting about sexually assaulting women was leaked, he claimed the entire world was in a conspiracy against him \u2014 the media, the Clintons, the Republicans. \\nPoor Donald, everyone is calling him out for the racist and misogynist that he is. \\nMost familiar to me as an abuse survivor were Trump\u2019s deflections of Hillary\u2019s jabs during the second debate. In my experience, any time you confront an abuser with their past bad behaviors, you get one of three responses. \\nFirst, they might say they never did that. That thing never happened. This is called gaslighting . The name comes from a 1944 film called Gaslight . It\u2019s used when someone attempts to manipulate you into doubting your own lived experiences. \\nSecond, they\u2019ll turn your critique back onto you. You don\u2019t like that they humiliated you in front of your friends? You\u2019re too sensitive. That\u2019s your problem. It\u2019s just one more item on the long list of things that are wrong with you . \\nLast, they reply to your critique of them with what they don\u2019t like about you. And sometimes, the responses can be quite arbitrary. \\nOh, Hillary doesn\u2019t like that Trump bragged about assaulting women? Well, Bill Clinton had affairs. Never mind that Bill isn\u2019t running for president, or that his well-litigated past isn\u2019t the issue at hand. \\nTrue, Bill Clinton won\u2019t go down in history for being faithful, but that doesn\u2019t answer the question about Trump\u2019s record with women and his qualifications to be president. \\nEmotional abuse can be hard to pinpoint when you\u2019re the one being abused. So Donald Trump has just provided us all with a valuable service by demonstrating before a live TV audience what emotional abuse looks like in action. \\nThe best way to deal with a bully? Remove them from your life.'"}, "time": 1742563034.9119487}
