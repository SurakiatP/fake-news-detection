One is espionage, and the second is treason. There\u2019s a question of judgment here. In the midst of a federal investigation, after the president  \u2014   at that time, the   of the United States is starting to receive intelligence briefings that presumably include conversations about Russia, there\u2019s a judgment by Jared Kushner and the president\u2019s team that says, I trust the Russians more than I trust the Americans. I\u2019m going to go talk to the Russian embassy, because I don\u2019t trust American channels. We don\u2019t know what he said and whether anything he said was either inappropriate or illegal, and I\u2019m going to presume he did this at the behest of the   of the United States. There\u2019s a question of judgment here, but all this conversation about treason and espionage has to stop. We don\u2019t know. \u201d (  Grabien) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742562300.7394118}
