Taking place as Trump arrived in Ohio, something downright \u201cinsane\u201d was spotted in the crowd \u2013 and many are saying it proves that Hillary Clinton is done for good. \\nThe incident actually took place back in September but is most recently proving true on a daily basis now. According to reports, Trump showed up in Columbus, Ohio earlier in his campaign, and when he opened his limo door, something incredible was waiting for him . Donald Trump draws massive crowd in Columbus, Ohio (Source: Liberty Writers News ) \\nAs Liberty Writers News puts it, \u201cthe crowd went insane for America\u2019s 45 th president.\u201d It goes without saying that there is a huge enthusiasm difference between the two candidates for president and their supporters. Although this was proven true back in September, it\u2019s being demonstrated even more so today.

Furthermore, Kaine is having to cancel events as only 30 people are showing up. Tim Kaine had 2 cancel another Florida rally because only about 30 people ( press & security included) showed up! #Priceless #Trump2016 \\n\u2014 Amy Mek (@AmyMek) October 27, 2016 Waiting for Vice Presidential candidate, Tim Kaine to speak at #Lorain Admiral King school. pic.twitter.com/A74ve1eKkF \\n\u2014 Mary Springowski (@maryspring) October 27, 2016 \\nOf course, his staff is blaming it on \u201cscheduling issues,\u201d but it\u2019s happened more than once at this point, proving a pattern here. Mike Pence, on the other hand, is having the exact opposite problem as the venues he\u2019s speaking at don\u2019t have room for the thousands of people who are showing up. \\n\u2014 Linda Suhler, Ph.D. (@LindaSuhler) October 27, 2016 \\nBetween the FBI reopening her email investigation and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange promising that his next leak will land her in prison , things aren\u2019t looking good for Hillary. Put that in combination with the fact that Trump and Pence are bringing people in by the thousands, where Hillary and her running mate can\u2019t seem to manage bringing in supporters by mere the hundreds \u2013 well, it\u2019s safe to say that this goose is just about cooked. \\nHillary Clinton is done, and this nation is going to make that perfectly clear come Election Day. We the People are done with the politically corrupt government elites that have poisoned our country. I can\u2019t wait to see the look on Hillary\u2019s face when she realizes that she\u2019s going to prison for a very long time, just like Trump promised.'"}, "time": 1742628591.7299018}
