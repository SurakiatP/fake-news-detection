To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video. \\nEver since the 1920s, doctors have been injecting arthritis patients with gold. Evidently, \u201cgold-based medicines have been in use for thousands of years,\u201d and remarkably, are still in clinical use as so called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs\u2014meaning they can slow the progression of rheumatoid arthritis. \\nUnfortunately, such drugs can be toxic, even fatal, causing conditions such as gold lung, a gold-induced lung disease. \u201cAlthough its use can be limited by the incidence of serious toxicity,\u201d injectable gold has been shown to be beneficial. But maybe, some researchers suspected, some of that benefit is the sesame oil that\u2019s injected, which is used as the liquid carrier for the gold. \\nSesame seeds contain anti-inflammatory compounds, with names like sesamin and sesamol, which researchers suspect \u201cmay serve as a potential treatment for various inflammatory diseases.\u201d But, these were in vitro studies. First, we have to see if it has an anti-inflammatory effect in people, not just cells in a petri dish. But, there haven\u2019t been any studies on the effects of sesame seeds on inflammatory markers in people with arthritis, for example\u2014until now. \\n\u201cConsidering the high prevalence of osteoarthritis\u2026and since until now there has not been any human studies to evaluate the effect of sesame in [osteoarthritis] patients, this study was designed to assess the effect of administration of sesame [seeds] on inflammation\u2026\u201d And, they found a significant drop in inflammatory markers. But, what effect did it have on their actual disease? \\nFifty patients with osteoarthritis of the knee were split into two groups; standard treatment, or standard treatment plus about a quarter-cup of sesame seeds a day, for two months. Before they started, they described their pain as about 9 out of 10\u2014where zero is no pain, and 10 is the maximum pain tolerable. After two months, the control group felt a little better\u2014pain down to 7. But, the sesame group dropped down to 3.5\u2014significantly lower than the control group. \\nThe researchers conclude that sesame appeared to have a \u201cpositive effect,\u201d\u201cimproving clinical signs and symptoms in patients with knee [osteoarthritis].\u201d But, the main problem with this study is that the control group wasn\u2019t given a placebo. It\u2019s hard to come up with a kind of fake sesame seed. But, without a placebo, they basically compared doing nothing to doing something. And, any time you have patients do something special, you can\u2019t discount the placebo effect. \\nBut, what are the downsides? I mean that\u2019s the nice thing about using food as medicine\u2014only good side effects. Though the results are mixed, there have been studies using placebo controls that found that adding sesame seeds to one\u2019s diet may improve our cholesterol and antioxidant status. And, the amount of sesamin found in as little as about one tablespoon of sesame seeds can modestly lower blood pressure a few points within a month\u2014enough, perhaps, to lower fatal stroke and heart attack risk by about 5%; potentially saving thousands of lives.
