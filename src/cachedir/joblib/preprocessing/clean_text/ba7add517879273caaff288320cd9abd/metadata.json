It\u2019s certainly not my first choice. But, I wanted to have hope. And I wanted to have an open mind so that, perhaps, the weight of this office, of this presidency, might guide him in a better direction than in his previous life. It is not. \u201d Later, Brzezinski described Trump as \u201cpossibly unfit mentally. \u201d \u201cSorry, I\u2019m just saying what everyone is thinking, so,\u201d she said.   Joe Scarborough criticized the people with which Trump had surrounded himself in the White House and cited a Wall Street Journal editorial claiming a lost trust in government. \u201cLet\u2019s put it this way  \u2014   I believe in his ability to communicate with people, and I believe in how he won,\u201d Brzezinski replied. \u201cI get why he won. I don\u2019t believe in his ability to be able to do this job well. It\u2019s past time that we lower the bar so low that we\u2019re in the ditch. \u201d After Hearst Magazines\u2019 Joanna Cole had said people were watching abroad what was happening in the United States, Brzezinski implied Trump was taking the country down the path of totalitarianism. \u201cWe hear, Joanna [Coles] from people from other countries who say this is how it starts,\u201d she added. \u201cSo, I think we are at that point where we have to have that conversation. \u201d Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor'"}, "time": 1742563660.424682}
