[In a letter to clergy, the Most Reverend Bishop Peter Libasci for the Diocese of Manchester says Catholic parishes should not be working against law enforcement, according to the Christian Post.  Libasci stated that the term \u201csanctuary church\u201d was being misused by illegal immigration advocates. \u201cSome use this term and mean what I have described above  \u2014   a welcoming community ready to offer immediate aid to anyone in need. In these works, of course, we will always be involved,\u201d Libasci wrote in the letter. \u201cBut others use this term \u2018sanctuary\u2019 to refer to churches that will allow individuals in fear of deportation to live in the church. \u201d Libasci went on to say that the propping up of sanctuary churches was creating a \u201cfalse hope\u201d for illegal immigrants who are trying to escape enforcement. \u201c\u2018Sanctuary\u2019 is not a designation recognized by law and provides no such legal protection,\u201d Libasci continued. \u201cInstead, immigration law imposes criminal penalties and fines on anyone who conceals, harbors, or shields from detection, in any place, an alien who has come to, entered, or remains in the United States in violation of the law. \u201d The mainstream media has heralded the practice of churches harboring illegal immigrants wanted for crimes and other violations by ICE. In a piece in the New York Times, churches helping to shield illegal immigrants were referred to as \u201c  immigrant sanctuaries,\u201d Breitbart Texas reported at the time.
