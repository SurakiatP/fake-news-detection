The presidential race headed into its seventh to last weekend. Donald Trump declared that President Obama had been \u201cborn in the United States, period,\u201d ostensibly putting to rest a controversy he fostered for years. But he did so in the context of falsely blaming Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign for having \u201cstarted the birther controversy\u201d and claiming credit himself for having \u201cended it. \u201d On the equally false pretext that Mrs. Clinton wants to \u201cdestroy your Second Amendment,\u201d Mr. Trump said her Secret Service detail should disarm. \u201cLet\u2019s see what happens to her,\u201d he said, raising the possibility of violence against her for a second time in the race. _____ 2. Michelle Obama campaigned for Mrs. Clinton in Virginia, bringing the force of her own popularity to bear on a suddenly shakier bid. Some of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s supporters, dismayed by polls showing a tightened race  \u2014   and some showing Mr. Trump ahead  \u2014   are racked by doubt, fearing that problems like her email troubles and delay in revealing pneumonia could cost her the election. And after a week focused on the candidates\u2019 health, our   podcast looks at the history of such concerns, with a special appearance by Lawrence Altman, a doctor and former Times reporter who was the first to interview presidential hopefuls about their medical profiles. _____ 3. The partial   in Syria that began on Monday night showed signs of fraying. Government forces and opposition fighters blamed each other for reported episodes of sniper fire, bombardments and clashes. About three dozen U. S. Special Operations troops arrived in northern Syria on an \u201cadvise and assist\u201d mission. They \u201care accompanying Turkish and vetted Syrian opposition forces as they continue to clear territory,\u201d a Pentagon spokesman said in an email. _____ 4. Edward Snowden said his disclosures of widespread domestic surveillance in the U. S. had improved privacy for individuals. Speaking via an internet connection from exile in Russia, he told a gathering in Athens, \u201cBeing patriotic doesn\u2019t mean agreeing with your government. \u201d He also said he was grateful that human rights and civil liberties groups are calling on President Obama to pardon him. Oliver Stone\u2019s biopic, \u201cSnowden,\u201d is in theaters now. _____ 5. What can explain the giant Wells Fargo fraud? More than 5, 000 employees and managers have been fired and the bank is under federal investigation for millions of unauthorized accounts opened in the names of their customers, a practice that prompted internal warnings when it first came to light several years ago. Several of those fired blamed desperation to meet the aggressive sales goals the company set. Our Wall Street columnist sees the illegal and unethical behavior as \u201ca symptom of the wider cultural cancer that has pervaded Wall Street for decades. \u201d _____ 6. Looking ahead: The Emmy Awards are Sunday night. Are you behind on the top nominees? Our TV experts can help you catch up fast. For instance, if you can watch only one episode of \u201cThe People v. O. J. ,\u201d make it \u201cManna From Heaven,\u201d when the defense team discovers audiotapes of an L. A. detective\u2019s hate speech. On the comedy side, you can see what\u2019s great about \u201cVeep\u201d in the episode \u201cKissing Your Sister,\u201d a season highlight that pretends to be a    documentary made by the show\u2019s first daughter. _____ 7. Be forewarned: Wildlife photographers and conservationists are posting clickbaity animal shots loaded with sometimes disturbing information about the dangers marine mammals face from climate change. In one of the gentler posts, the photographer who put this beluga whale on Instagram noted that the species had \u201crecently been categorized as \u2018near threatened,\u2019 due to aggressive hunting by humans and exposure to harmful anthropogenic pollutants over the past several years. \u201d _____ 8. William  Bratton, one of the most influential figures in American policing for more than 40 years, took leave of the New York Police Department. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be kind of bittersweet for him to be leaving the profession that he loved and the profession he made such a huge difference in across the country and in all those agencies,\u201d a former aide said. As part of his farewell, he wrote an   essay that sees his decades of reform efforts taking shape on the streets. _____ 9. Finally, one of our most popular stories today is an essay by a bioethicist specializing in reproduction and sexual health, but it\u2019s about not being pregnant  \u2014   while looking as if you are. The situation tends to underscore how invasive people can be regarding women\u2019s bodies. She relates how a stranger publicly shamed her into taking his seat on the bus to protect her \u201cunborn baby\u201d from bumps, and how he \u201dput both hands on my belly and rubbed it as we switched places. \u201d Her advice: Stop at \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Have a great weekend. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.
