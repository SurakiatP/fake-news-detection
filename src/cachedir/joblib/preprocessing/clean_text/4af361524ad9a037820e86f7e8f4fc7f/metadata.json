It was like, when are we going the next time to Australia or the next time to New York? And I\u2019ve been saying, \u2018Not for a while. \u2019\u201d But the next family business trip is now fast approaching. Federer is set to return to action next month in Perth, Australia, at the Hopman Cup team event before returning in earnest at the Australian Open in Melbourne. Federer has not played a match since July 8, when he lost in five sets to Milos Raonic in the semifinals at Wimbledon. In the last set, he took an awkward and uncharacteristic tumble on the grass that was too easy to see as a metaphor for the decline of a great, balletic champion. Federer landed on his   left knee, which in February had required him to have surgery for the first time in his career, keeping him out for more than two months. Though he got up slowly at Wimbledon and finished the match, he did not finish the season. He even missed the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, which had long been one of his major   targets. While his longtime rivals Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic duked it out for the No. 1 ranking and his Swiss countryman Stan Wawrinka won the United States Open, Federer got a taste of retirement with his longest break from the tour since he turned professional in 1998. Now, he will try his hand at a staple of modern tennis: the comeback. And he will do so with a world ranking of No. 16, his lowest since 2001. \u201cIt actually felt like I had my first real comeback in April when I came back in Monaco, especially having had surgery, because I never had surgery before,\u201d Federer said. \u201cSo that felt like a real comeback to me, but this one feels bigger, obviously, because two months is not like six months. Clearly this comeback is going to have a different place in my career, for sure. \u201d Federer, 35, has little left to prove. He has already won a record 17 Grand Slam singles titles and 71 lesser titles. He has maintained a standard of excellence for far longer than most tennis champions do. Although he said he had treasured his time away from the tour with his wife, Mirka, and their four young children, he insisted that no consideration had been given to making the break permanent. \u201cMirka is totally committed, totally happy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe kids love it, and I\u2019m still hungry, and now I\u2019m even refreshed and rejuvenated. \u201d The question of retirement never came up. For Federer, the questions were instead: \u201cCan I still do it? As a player, can my body still do it? Can my mind still do it?\u201d Those are particularly intriguing questions at a moment when so much talent  \u2014   both rising and established  \u2014   seems to be converging in the men\u2019s game. Federer, as much a tennis aficionado as a tennis maestro, is well aware of the story lines. The old guard on the men\u2019s tour remains with Federer and Rafael Nadal, who at age 30 is returning from more injury problems of his own with a new coach in his team: Carlos Moy\u00e1. The new wave is full of promise, led by Dominic Thiem, Alexander Zverev and Nick Kyrgios, all of whom have already beaten Federer. There are also many established stars in their primes: from Raonic, Kei Nishikori and Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro to the multiple Grand Slam champions Wawrinka, Murray and Djokovic. Federer, even in absentia, said he had kept checking the scores on his phone as Murray dueled with Djokovic down the stretch in November to secure the   No. 1 ranking. \u201cI was very surprised just because when a guy starts a season the way Novak does, achieves his dream by winning the French and his fourth Slam in a row, of course there\u2019s no way in the world that anybody, even the players, start thinking another guy could actually finish No. 1,\u201d Federer said. \u201cNovak, let\u2019s be honest, actually didn\u2019t play too bad in the second half. He won Toronto. He played finals in many other tournaments: U. S. Open, the World Tour Finals. You would think that that\u2019s going to be enough, but what it required was something extraordinary, and Murray was able to deliver that, and that\u2019s where I take my hat off. \u201d Federer did not experience a letdown in 2009 after winning the French Open, the only major singles title he had lacked. But he said he could certainly comprehend the perils of Djokovic\u2019s emotional journey in 2016. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s only human and understandable that Novak had a letdown, because he achieved everything he wanted to,\u201d Federer said. \u201cYou have to maybe reinvent yourself or whatever you have to do. But it\u2019s nice to see that maybe it doesn\u2019t always come so easy for everybody for so long. \u201cAnd I think it actually creates a great story for next year. Andy\u2019s a great story. Novak\u2019s a great story. Rafa, obviously, is always going to be a good story. Me coming back is hopefully going to be a nice story to follow, too. I think the beginning of the year, especially the Australian summer, is going to be epic. \u201d Federer said his decision to end his season after Wimbledon had been made out of a desire to get the most out of what remains of his career. \u201cMaybe I could have, should have taken more time after the Australian Open once I had surgery,\u201d he said. \u201cPossibly, but I was well. I was training full on in Dubai. \u201d After withdrawing from the French Open, ending his consecutive streak of Grand Slam appearances at 65, Federer came back for the   season and Wimbledon knowing his knee was not quite right. \u201cI don\u2019t think it cost me the rest of the season by playing on the grass,\u201d he said. \u201cI just think the knee and the body needed a break, and taking six months off, I could take the time the body and knee required to heal. Now I can look back and say: \u2018Look, if now it doesn\u2019t go well, I did everything I possibly could. There are no regrets. \u2019\u201d He said he had taken a particularly conservative approach this time around. \u201cEspecially the first three months, I was working out maybe one hour a day,\u201d he said. When he did turn up the intensity with his longtime fitness coach Pierre Paganini, Federer said, he often avoided training on consecutive days. He started playing points again in early October, but he said he had not resumed full   sessions until late November after he left Switzerland for Dubai, his usual   training base. He has been practicing there frequently with the rising Frenchman Lucas Pouille, and on Thursday Federer planned to broadcast their practice session live on Periscope to give his fans an update on his progress. \u201cI just felt I needed to start filling in people on how I\u2019m doing as we get closer to the beginning of the season,\u201d he said. The real test of how he is playing will have to wait for Australia, where his   preview of life without the tennis circuit will officially come to an end. \u201cI did get that taste of retirement,\u201d Federer said. \u201cAll of the sudden, I could be organized and say: \u2018O. K. we\u2019re going to be four weeks at home in a row in the same place. Who do you want to go for dinner with, Mirka? Or who shall we catch up with?\u201d Federer enjoyed having that time with his family and the predictability of being in one place for more than a week at a time. Fortunately, he said, his knee held up, and he was able to make the most of it. \u201cI think that was really exciting and good for us to have that time,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it felt good, you know? It did feel good, but it can totally wait. No problem for me. It can totally wait. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562303.643052}
