[A Twitter user sent ADT a message asking the   company to \u201cdrop CNN. \u201d  \u201cWe do not support these views,\u201d ADT responded. \u201cWe\u2019ve begun the process of pulling our ads from this network. \u201d We do not support these views. We\u2019ve begun the process of pulling our ads from this network.  \u2014   ADT (@ADT) May 31, 2017,  Griffin has   a live New Year\u2019s Eve broadcast on CNN since 2007 alongside network anchor Anderson Cooper. The network said late Tuesday that it was \u201cevaluating\u201d its relationship with the    comedian. \u201cWe found what she did disgusting and offensive,\u201d CNN said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cWe are pleased to see she has apologized and asked that the photos be taken down. We are evaluating our New Year\u2019s Eve coverage and have made no decisions at this point. \u201d Cooper denounced Griffin\u2019s photo in a short statement on Twitter. \u201cFor the record, I am appalled by the photo shoot Kathy Griffin took part in. It is clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate,\u201d the AC360 host wrote. For the record, I am appalled by the photo shoot Kathy Griffin took part in. It is clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate.  \u2014   Anderson Cooper (@andersoncooper) May 31, 2017,  ADT\u2019s announcement comes as the Route 66 Hotel and Casino in Albuquerque, NM has canceled Griffin\u2019s scheduled performance. \u201cThe performance by Kathy Griffin on July 22nd has been cancelled,\u201d the casino wrote in a message posted to Facebook. A full refund to any guests who purchased a ticket was also promised. Griffin\u2019s social media accounts were flooded with calls from social media users urging others to boycott her upcoming   comedy tour dates and venues to deny her a platform to perform. President Trump tweeted Wednesday morning that Griffin\u2019s photo had been difficult for his children, including his    son, Barron. Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself. My children, especially my 11 year old son, Barron, are having a hard time with this. Sick!  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 31, 2017,  While Griffin has issued an apology, admitting that the photo \u201cwent too far,\u201d she has yet to apologize directly to the president and his family. The U. S. Secret Service, however, is reportedly investigating the \u201ccircumstances\u201d surrounding the photo shoot. \u201cThe U. S. Secret Service has a critical mission. It is always unfortunate when people make statements that could be perceived as threats,\u201d the agency said in a statement, according to ABC News. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the luxury of knowing a person\u2019s intent. Each alleged or perceived threat has to be investigated thoroughly which taxes Secret Service manpower and resources that could be utilized elsewhere. \u201d   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @jeromeehudson'"}, "time": 1742561874.1353161}
