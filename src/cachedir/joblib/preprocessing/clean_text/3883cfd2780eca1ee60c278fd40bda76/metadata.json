Trump on Wednesday offered a defiant defense of his campaign\u2019s decision to publish an image widely viewed as    \u2014   saying he regretted deleting it  \u2014   and vigorously reaffirmed his praise of Saddam Hussein, the murderous Iraqi dictator. In the span of 30 minutes, an   Mr. Trump breathed new life into a controversy that was sparked on Saturday by his posting of an image on his Twitter account of a   star next to a picture of Hillary Clinton, with money seeming to rain down in the background. The image was quickly, and broadly, criticized for invoking stereotypes of Jews. Mr. Trump deleted it two hours later, and replaced the star image with a circle. \u201c \u2018You shouldn\u2019t have taken it down,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Trump recalled telling one of his campaign workers. \u201cI said, \u2018Too bad, you should have left it up.\u2019 I would have rather defended it. \u201d \u201cThat\u2019s just a star,\u201d Mr. Trump said repeatedly. It was a striking display of   from a presumptive presidential nominee and underscored the limitations of Mr. Trump\u2019s scattershot approach during the Republican primaries  \u2014   not to mention how difficult he often makes it for his campaign team to control him. The rally in Cincinnati had been promoted by Mr. Trump\u2019s team for two days as a chance for him to give a tryout to a potential running mate, former Speaker Newt Gingrich. Periodically, beginning midway through Mr. Trump\u2019s speech, the crowd chanted Mr. Gingrich\u2019s name, but Mr. Trump did not heed its wishes. Mr. Trump had not discussed the Twitter message at length until Wednesday night, at his rally in Cincinnati, and his remarks seemed to clash with those of his    Jared Kushner, an Orthodox Jew, who earlier in the day had defended Mr. Trump in an unusual and candid   article, suggesting that the Twitter post was \u201ccareless. \u201d The attention paid to the controversy had begun to die down by the time Mr. Trump took the stage, and he began to read from notes about the criticism leveled against Mrs. Clinton on Tuesday by the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey. But within 20 minutes, Mr. Trump tossed his notes aside and moved on to topics closer to home  \u2014   the criticism he had received for his praise of Saddam Hussein at a rally Tuesday night in Raleigh, N. C. Mr. Trump reiterated his belief that Hussein was \u201cbad,\u201d but effective at killing terrorists, despite Hussein\u2019s classification by the United States as a state sponsor of terrorism. But the bulk of Mr. Trump\u2019s energy was spent on the Twitter post. \u201cThey\u2019re racially profiling, they\u2019re profiling, not us,\u201d he said of the news media. Mr. Trump called the news media \u201cdishonest\u201d in the rambling and sometimes   address, in which he hopscotched from one topic to another. He angrily lamented his treatment at the hands of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign, which he called a \u201ccrooked, crooked, disgusting group. \u201d Raising his voice to a hoarse shout, he complained that the Clinton campaign had released an ad showing Mr. Trump playing golf, though he said he did not play golf on his recent trip to Scotland. \u201cThe picture was from two years before,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAt a different course!\u201d He also noted, in a calmer tone, that the clip used by the Clinton campaign made him look thin. \u201cThe swing,\u201d he added, \u201cactually looked good. \u201d At one point, Mr. Trump lamented that his youngest child, Barron, \u201cdraws stars all over the place. \u201d He continued, \u201cI never said, \u2018That\u2019s the Star of David, Barron, don\u2019t!\u2019 \u201d At another, he swatted at a mosquito that landed on his lectern and said he never liked the insects, before adding, \u201cSpeaking of mosquitoes, hello, Hillary. How are you doing?\u201d Hours earlier, the deeply private Mr. Kushner, who is married to Ivanka Trump, wrote the   article in which he described the \u201cDonald Trump I know. \u201d Mr. Trump, Mr. Kushner wrote, is not an  . He also described his family\u2019s experiences during the Holocaust, adding: \u201cI go into these details, which I have never discussed, because it\u2019s important to me that people understand where I\u2019m coming from when I report that I know the difference between actual, dangerous intolerance versus these labels that get tossed around in an effort to score political points. \u201d Mr. Kushner obliquely acknowledged that the Star of David post was a mistake, but cited it as evidence of the refreshing originality of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. \u201cIf my father in law\u2019s   team was careless in choosing an image to retweet, well part of the reason it\u2019s so shocking is that it\u2019s the actual candidate communicating with the American public rather than the armies of handlers who   ordinary candidates\u2019 every move,\u201d he wrote. But Mr. Trump said several times on Wednesday that he saw nothing wrong with the image. In an interview shortly before the rally, Mr. Trump said, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to delete it  \u2014   I would have never deleted it. My people deleted it before they told me about it, they did it because of the sensibilities and sensitivities. But when I looked at it, I thought that\u2019s a star. I never thought, that\u2019s the Star of David. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562270.7783744}
