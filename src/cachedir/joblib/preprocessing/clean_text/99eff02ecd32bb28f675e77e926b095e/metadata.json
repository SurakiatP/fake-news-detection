And weirdly he kept referring to himself in the third person. \\n\u201cAt first we thought it might have been a hoax or someone out of their head on mind-altering substances, but we have checked our account and the money is already there, so we will start fulfilling the order immediately.\u201d \\nWhen pressed by reporters, Mr Williams was reluctant to give further details for fear of breaching customer confidentiality, but he did confirm that the order was for a residence on Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, D.C 20500. \\nHe added, \u201cI don\u2019t know who this caller who referred to himself as \u2018The Big Cheese\u2019 could be, but he sure loves gold.\u201d Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday, for FREE!
