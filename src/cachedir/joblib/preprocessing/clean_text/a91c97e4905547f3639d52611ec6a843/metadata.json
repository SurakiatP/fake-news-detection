If that\u2019s so, how could the former Fox News chief executive, Roger Ailes, have conducted what now appears to have been a   campaign of sexual abuse and harassment of subordinates? Mr. Ailes has denied any wrongdoing. But thanks to two women who were courageous enough to speak out  \u2014   Rudi Bakhtiar (in The Times) and Laurie Luhn (in New York magazine)  \u2014   we know now that Fox News had already paid millions to settle sexual harassment accusations years before the lawsuit by a former Fox News anchor, Gretchen Carlson, that led to Mr. Ailes\u2019s resignation this summer. The bottom line? Neither Mr. Ailes nor any other Fox News executive suffered any consequences before Ms. Carlson\u2019s lawsuit and the subsequent investigation. The previous victims who filed complaints left the company, their careers in ruins, and in return for money, signed agreements that muzzled them. A 21st Century Fox spokesman, Nathaniel Brown, said the company had no comment beyond its previous statements. \u201cA lot of men have gotten away with sexual harassment with absolutely no consequences,\u201d said Catharine A. MacKinnon, a professor of law at the University of Michigan and Harvard Law School who pioneered sexual harassment lawsuits. No matter what companies say, she added, \u201cthe real rule is that the more powerful a man is, the more he gets away with. \u201d Jon Bauer, a professor of law at the University of Connecticut who has written extensively about workplace discrimination, also says the issue goes well beyond Fox News. \u201cEmployees are rewarded for shielding powerful people in the organization,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the culture in many workplace settings. \u201d The problem is compounded by settlements, like those at Fox News and most organizations, that impose silence on the victims. It\u2019s certainly understandable that companies would want to avoid the bad publicity and put such matters behind them. But at the same time, they foster the perception that the settlements are really   especially when no disciplinary steps are taken against the perpetrators. Professor Bauer likened the situation to the sexual abuse scandal that engulfed the Catholic Church. \u201cWe\u2019ve done thousands of confidential settlements,\u201d said Gloria Allred, a civil rights lawyer who has probably handled more prominent sexual harassment cases than anyone. \u201cWe do them every day. Complete confidentiality is usually the condition for a settlement. This can be very difficult for our clients. They want to be compensated and they want to tell the world about it. I tell them that\u2019s just not going to happen. \u201d (Full disclosure: The New York Times Company has also entered into confidential agreements in settling employment cases.) Victims of sexual harassment can see what happens to other victims who came forward. \u201cIt\u2019s career suicide to come forward,\u201d said Professor MacKinnon. \u201cYou\u2019re roadkill. Women know this, yet some come forward. That\u2019s what courage looks like. \u201d It\u2019s not just women who may suffer the consequences. Last week, The Times reported that the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates had settled sexual harassment accusations by Christopher Tarui, who claimed that his boss had \u201ccaressed\u201d his back in a hotel room and repeatedly propositioned him for sex. After he rebuffed his boss, Mr. Tarui\u2019s complaint states, he received a poor performance review. Mr. Tarui said he had been discouraged from pursuing a claim, and when it became clear that he was filing one, he was escorted out of the office and placed on a paid leave of absence. He has since found another job. Terms of that settlement, too, are confidential. Bridgewater, in a statement, emphasized that Mr. Tarui had withdrawn his claims. Bridgewater said it had waived a noncompete clause so that Mr. Tarui could take another job and paid him no money as part of the settlement. A spokesman for the firm declined further comment. Most employment contracts, including Ms. Carlson\u2019s, also require any sexual harassment claims to go to arbitration, where all evidence and proceedings are secret. \u201cI\u2019d love to see the end of the requirement to go to arbitration as a condition of employment,\u201d Ms. Allred said. \u201cIf a claim can\u2019t be resolved, an employee should have the right to file a lawsuit and have her day in court. \u201d That would require legislation, because courts have generally upheld such arbitration clauses. Even though the terms of the Luhn settlement were confidential, others at Fox News and 21st Century Fox should have known about it. And if so, they should have taken steps to investigate and, if warranted, discipline executives who violated company policy, not to mention federal law. Given the size of Ms. Luhn\u2019s settlement  \u2014   $3. 15 million, according to New York magazine  \u2014   Fox News must have believed that the claim had some merit. \u201cIf that\u2019s correct, it\u2019s a serious number, and she must have had a serious claim,\u201d Ms. Allred said. At Fox News, Dianne Brandi, executive vice president for business and legal affairs, handled Ms. Luhn\u2019s claim. She presumably conducted an investigation, if only to assess the merits of Ms. Luhn\u2019s claim. Fox News\u2019s parent company has said no one there knew about the Luhn payment until recently, and a Fox News spokeswoman said previously that Mr. Ailes alone directed the settlement negotiations and agreed to the terms. Ms. Brandi would appear to have plenty to answer for. Not only should Mr. Ailes have had no involvement in disposing of the matter given that he was the subject of the claim, but ethical standards suggest that she should have told higher ranking executives and perhaps even Rupert Murdoch, who was 21st Century Fox\u2019s chief executive at the time, or members of the company\u2019s board. The New York State Rules of Professional Conduct require internal lawyers who know of behavior \u201csubstantially likely\u201d to injure the corporation to take all steps \u201creasonably necessary\u201d to protect the company, which may include notifying the company\u2019s board. \u201cIt\u2019s the obligation of the   lawyer to protect the company,\u201d Professor MacKinnon said. \u201cUnfortunately, when you\u2019re dealing with a   executive like Ailes, there\u2019s a tendency to see protecting the company as the same as protecting him. They should be protecting the company from him. \u201d A Fox News spokeswoman, Irena Briganti, declined to make Ms. Brandi available for comment. The upshot: Despite decades of E. E. O. C. enforcement proceedings and the widespread adoption of strict   policies in the workplace, most sexual harassment claims never get reported and most of those that do get swept under the rug. \u201cSexual harassment is still a massive problem,\u201d Ms. Allred said. \u201cIt\u2019s severe and it\u2019s pervasive. \u201d But in the aftermath of Mr. Ailes\u2019s resignation, there is hope for improvement. After Ms. Carlson filed her suit, Fox News and 21st Century Fox did what they should have done years ago when faced with similar accusations: They hired outside counsel for an investigation, and when overwhelming evidence mounted, demanded Mr. Ailes\u2019s resignation. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to overstate how important it is that even someone as powerful as Ailes was held accountable,\u201d Professor MacKinnon said. \u201cThere have been a lot of situations where you\u2019d come to the conclusion that the law doesn\u2019t matter, and that what does matter is power, the rule of force. Then something like this comes along and you realize the law does matter. A lot of women are going to take heart from that. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562264.0213223}
