Cdebaca told police that she had planned on shooting Eustaquio for two weeks and that she bought a gun specifically for the purpose of killing him, KSWB reported. \u201cDid you check on him after you shot him?\u201d asked detectives. \u201cI didn\u2019t care,\u201d answered Cdebaca.  \u201cI would do it again. \u201d Cdebaca told detectives that she got into a fight with her    the morning of the shooting. \u201cI got dressed and he said, \u2018you can\u2019t go like that.\u2019 He told me you look ghetto,\u201d said Cdebaca during the video testimony. She said she got angry when Eustaquio told her she wasn\u2019t invited to attend her granddaughter\u2019s spelling bee that day, and that she reached her breaking point after that argument. She even recounted how she shot her    10 times, even stopping to reload and shoot at him again after initially wounding him. \u201cI shot him 10 times, then he went inside the house and locked the door,\u201d said Cdebaca. That\u2019s when she said she shot through the door, entered the home, fired the final rounds and stood over him. \u201cDid you shoot till it was empty?\u201d a detective was heard asking Cdebaca. \u201cYes, until it was empty,\u201d said Cdebaca. Cdebaca told investigators that she and her family suffered Eustaquio\u2019s abuse for 13 years. \u201cSo mean to me, to all of them. Yes he is,\u201d said Cdebaca. \u201cThey were afraid of him, yes. So mean to my daughter. I told her 13 years ago, he\u2019s evil. \u201d The video showed each member of Cdebaca\u2019s family hugging her and saying goodbye before she was taken to jail. When Cdebaca asked her youngest granddaughter for a hug, the girl refused. \u201cNo, you killed my dad,\u201d said the girl.'"}, "time": 1742562243.259084}
