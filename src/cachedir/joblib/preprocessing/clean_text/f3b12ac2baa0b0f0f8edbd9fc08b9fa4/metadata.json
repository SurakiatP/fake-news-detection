Canadian Liberals have been stonewalling on any access to information requests relating to the Syrian Muslim migrants they\u2019ve been shipping in by the tens of thousands . They\u2019re either embarrassed by the facts or don\u2019t even want to know what the facts actually are. Back in 2008, Toronto media left and right reported on hundreds of polygamous Muslim families in Toronto, many on welfare. Has anything changed? Neither Canada\u2019s government nor its welfare agencies bother to screen for polygamous marriages. And the media won\u2019t breathe a word about it.'"}, "time": 1742561779.2022388}
