[\u201cAs one   preexisting condition: I hope every GOPr who voted 4 Trumpcare sees a family member get a long term condition, lose insurance,  die,\u201d Eichenwald said in a series of tweets that have since been deleted.  After being confronted by Twitter users, Eichenwald doubled down and insisted that Republican lawmakers\u2019 family members be \u201ctortured. \u201d \u201cNobody tell me how to feel knowing if I lose my insurance, I\u2019m dead. I want the GOPrs who support this to feel the pain in their own families,\u201d Eichenwald tweeted. \u201cBecause I want them to be tortured. GOPr only gain empathy when they are touched by the consequences, never before,\u201d he continued.
