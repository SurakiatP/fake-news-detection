But over the last 12 months, the   and   era has not been as easy for the network. On Monday, Comedy Central announced that it was canceling \u201cThe Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore\u201d because of falling ratings and a distinct lack of buzz. The final episode of Mr. Wilmore\u2019s 11:30 p. m. show  \u2014   the slot formerly occupied by Mr. Colbert before he left for CBS  \u2014   will be Thursday. Kent Alterman, Comedy Central\u2019s president, said he informed Mr. Wilmore of the news late last week. The move, Mr. Alterman said in an interview, was made for a simple reason: The show \u201chasn\u2019t resonated. \u201d \u201cEven though we\u2019ve given it a year and a half, we\u2019ve been hoping against hope that it would start to click with our audience, but it hasn\u2019t happened, and we haven\u2019t seen evidence of it happening,\u201d Mr. Alterman said. The awkward timing of the cancellation, just 12 weeks before the presidential election, ultimately came down to a contract, Mr. Alterman said. Mr. Wilmore\u2019s deal, along with those of several of the show\u2019s other staff members, was set to expire in a few weeks and the network had to decide now whether to renew or cancel. For the time being, Comedy Central\u2019s 12 a. m. show, \u201c@midnight,\u201d will replace \u201cThe Nightly Show\u201d at 11:30 p. m. \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d with Trevor Noah remains at 11 p. m. Mr. Alterman said he hoped to name a   replacement for \u201cThe Nightly Show\u201d sometime next year. The cancellation makes Mr. Wilmore, 54, an early casualty of a television   comedy slate that has been vastly reordered over the last two years. With the retirement of David Letterman, Jay Leno and Mr. Stewart, and Mr. Colbert\u2019s move to CBS, a series of new hosts have stepped into the spotlight, including James Corden, Samantha Bee, John Oliver and Mr. Noah. Jimmy Fallon, the host of \u201cThe Tonight Show,\u201d has most formidably filled the power vacuum left by his predecessors, earning the highest ratings of any   show. While Mr. Stewart was the host of \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d Mr. Wilmore became a fixture as the program\u2019s \u201csenior black correspondent,\u201d offering wry observations on racial issues. In May 2014, Mr. Stewart tapped Mr. Wilmore to get his own show, and Mr. Wilmore formally became Mr. Colbert\u2019s successor when \u201cThe Nightly Show\u201d premiered in January 2015. \u201cThe Nightly Show\u201d has been known for a signature segment, \u201cKeep It 100,\u201d (slang for telling the truth, no matter the consequences) and for Mr. Wilmore\u2019s often stinging commentary on race and this year\u2019s election. (He called the election to find Barack Obama\u2019s successor \u201cThe Unblackening. \u201d) Though the   genre remains heavy on easygoing laughter, any one episode of \u201cThe Nightly Show\u201d could occasionally go for prolonged stretches without a single joke, something that intrigued some critics but failed to attract a broader audience. \u201cI\u2019m really grateful to Comedy Central, Jon Stewart and our fans to have had this opportunity,\u201d Mr. Wilmore said in a statement. \u201cBut I\u2019m also saddened and surprised we won\u2019t be covering this crazy election or \u2018The Unblackening\u2019 as we\u2019ve coined it. And keeping it 100, I guess I hadn\u2019t counted on \u2018The Unblackening\u2019 happening to my time slot as well. \u201d The move by Comedy Central is also the first concession that the transition from Mr. Stewart and Mr. Colbert  \u2014   both pioneers of a certain kind of political comedy as media criticism and social commentary  \u2014   to Mr. Noah and Mr. Wilmore has not gone as smoothly as the network had hoped. Though Mr. Alterman strongly defended Mr. Noah\u2019s iteration of \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d  \u2014   next month will be his first anniversary as host  \u2014   both Mr. Noah and Mr. Wilmore have failed to capture the critical praise that rivals like Ms. Bee, Mr. Corden and Mr. Oliver have enjoyed. This year, for the first time in 16 years, \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d was not nominated for an Emmy in the best variety show category. Mr. Noah and Mr. Wilmore have also lost a good portion of the audience that used to tune in to Comedy Central between 11 p. m. and midnight. \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d had an average of 2. 1 million viewers a night in Mr. Stewart\u2019s final year as host, while Mr. Noah\u2019s audience has averaged 1. 3 million, according to data from Nielsen. And Mr. Wilmore has lost more than half the audience that he inherited. In Mr. Colbert\u2019s final year as host of \u201cThe Colbert Report,\u201d he had an average audience of 1. 7 million viewers, but in Mr. Wilmore\u2019s first year, that viewership fell to an average of 922, 000 viewers, according to Nielsen. This year, the total has fallen to 776, 000 viewers a night. Likewise, in the demographic most important to Comedy Central  \u2014   young men  \u2014   he has not made a dent. In recent months, Mr. Wilmore has even started losing to the show that is on after his, \u201c@midnight. \u201d Mr. Wilmore\u2019s most visible role in the last year may have been his turn as host of the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner. But reviews for his act were decidedly mixed, and the exposure did not result in a ratings bounce. Mr. Alterman said that he had hoped that there would be a ratings surge  \u2014   particularly around the political conventions  \u2014   and that the decision to cancel \u201cThe Nightly Show\u201d was a recent one. \u201cWe were hoping that we would get a turnaround along the way including the wild, wild two weeks of the conventions,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just haven\u2019t seen it on any level from the general conversation to ratings to any sort of traction on social media platforms. \u201d That stands in contrast, he said, to what the network has seen regarding Mr. Noah. Calling the perception that Mr. Noah is struggling \u201ca myth,\u201d Mr. Alterman pointed to the show\u2019s strong performance on Hulu  \u2014   though he is not allowed to disclose figures, he said. Mr. Noah\u2019s show is the No. 2   show among young adults ages 18 to 34, Mr. Alterman said, and his ratings have grown among   to    men. Mr. Alterman said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t be happier\u201d with Mr. Noah\u2019s performance. \u201cIn the last couple of weeks  \u2014   leading up to the conventions and especially the conventions  \u2014   we feel like Trevor got to a whole new level in terms of having a strong voice and point of view,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been no surprise to us. We expected him to take time to find his rhythm and find his way. \u201d It\u2019s unclear whether Mr. Wilmore will stay on with Comedy Central  \u2014   \u201cWe haven\u2019t even addressed that,\u201d Mr. Alterman said  \u2014   but he is involved in other projects. In addition to developing ABC\u2019s   comedy \u201c\u201d he is an executive producer for HBO\u2019s coming comedy \u201cInsecure. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564530.0219514}
