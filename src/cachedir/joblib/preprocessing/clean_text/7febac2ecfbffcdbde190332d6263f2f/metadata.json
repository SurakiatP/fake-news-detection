It\u2019s what the embodiment of his clothes should be, if we were going by some unwritten aesthetic script. After all, the fashion Owens presents four times a year, for men and women, on the grand Paris stage, isn\u2019t free and easy. It isn\u2019t simple. It often looks like rags: Precious fabrics, like cashmere, are pilled and laddered, and leather is repeatedly washed to give it the texture and appearance of a prehistoric animal\u2019s skin. There is something monstrous about his gothic garments, with their strange, disturbing proportions attenuated and exaggerated, draped like ectoplasm clinging to thin limbs. When people wear them head to toe, as Owens\u2019s most enthusiastic followers frequently do, they don\u2019t look human. They look other. \u201cTroll clothes for the most desperate lemmings in the fashion herd,\u201d one observer wrote in 2008 on The New York Times\u2019s On the Runway blog. Owens appreciated the sentiment so much that he ran the phrase on his website, alongside   plaudits from the rest of the fashion world. There is, however, a disconnect between Rick Owens the man and Rick Owens the fashion designer. In photographs, Owens looks arresting, even sinister, with his   black hair and shroudlike attire, like the Grim Reaper crossed with a West Coast surf bum. (He often wears   shorts and sneakers, which undermines the goth undertones.) His spiky, sharply drawn features appear a little cadaverous. Presented in print, Owens  \u2014   generally quoted on topics such as death, renewal, creation  \u2014   can come across like a prophet of the apocalypse. And those monstrous \u201ctroll clothes\u201d he designs often seem, at first glance, cold and hard, solid carapaces of fabric, sharply cut and difficult to wear. \u201cI miss archness,\u201d he murmurs, as if by way of explanation. \u201cI think there was an arch moment in the \u201940s in fashion, and I\u2019m thinking forward, thinking about fashion cycles  \u2014   that\u2019s kind of a good cycle to bring back. \u201d But there\u2019s something unexpectedly soft about Owens, both the man and his clothes. In person, he\u2019s preternaturally tanned (he holidays in the United Arab Emirates, \u201cthe shortest flight to the most sun\u201d) and his voice, a languid Californian drawl, redolent of the state where he lived until the age of 42, softens his doomsday portents. It adds both a humanity and a note of wry humor that collapses any perceived pretension. And in person, those clothes collapse too, in on themselves, softly wrapping the body in protective layers of felted fabric and down padding. Up close, his arch silhouettes prove light and pliable to the touch, seductive. In the middle of the last century, the couturier Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga was first applauded, then deified by the fashion press for achieving the selfsame, and his approach influenced an entire generation of designers. Owens\u2019s technique has stealthily proved just as influential. Balenciaga probably didn\u2019t compare an especially visceral bunch of drapery to anal prolapse, as Owens has. But then he also, to my knowledge, didn\u2019t confess to an interviewer that he dyes his own hair. \u201cI\u2019m thinking I better shut up now,\u201d Owens says, almost as an aside. The delivery is so deadpan it begs for a punch line. \u201cIs it possible for designers to talk too much, do you think?\u201d He smiles, but thankfully doesn\u2019t stop talking. Owens is 55, and was born in Porterville, Calif. a small city in the San Joaquin Valley. He moved to Los Angeles after graduating high school, originally studying fine art at the Otis Art Institute of Parsons School of Design, then dropping out after two years. \u201cI wanted to be an artist at the beginning,\u201d he says. \u201cBut then I didn\u2019t think I had it in me. I didn\u2019t think I had the intellectual stamina for it, so I decided to be a fashion designer, because that was frivolous and easy. \u201d Owens smiles wider. He is, again, deflating the myth that has grown around him. He doesn\u2019t take himself as seriously as his work would lead people to believe. Unlike many fashion designers, however, Owens is able to articulate, precisely and vividly, what he\u2019s trying to do with his clothes, namely talk about those big, overarching themes affecting humanity, and offer something different in the fashion landscape. When he talks, he makes you take him seriously. And he likes to talk. We meet in Paris to discuss his men\u2019s wear which, perhaps even more so than his women\u2019s wear, is revolutionary, and has proved groundbreaking in its influence. In a soupy sea of mediocre suiting and sportswear, he offers something entirely different from other designers. He boldly experiments with fabric and silhouette, pushing boundaries of sexuality and gender. Owens is as likely to propose a dress for a man as for a woman, but without sacrificing manliness in favor of runway novelty. \u201cMy stuff seems to attract guys that I think might want to consider themselves some kind of heroic lone wolf, kind of playing by their own moral codes,\u201d Owens says, slowly. \u201cI was thinking about men\u2019s fashion, I was thinking in the \u201980s Calvin Klein, he promoted male sexuality . .. males as an object of sexual attention. That was what happened then, and then in the \u201990s men\u2019s fashion was a reaction to that and it became about youth. It became skinny and slim and young and introspective and vulnerable. Now, what is now?\u201d He stops. \u201cIf the last cycle was vulnerability, the obvious reaction would be heroism. \u201d Heroism for Owens isn\u2019t about the   jacket or   pants. It isn\u2019t about any clich\u00e9 of dressing. Owens has created collections inspired by Nijinsky\u2019s performance in \u201cAfternoon of a Faun,\u201d and by the athletic silhouette of Fred Astaire. In both he used drapery instead of tailoring, garments twisted and captured in motion, seemingly frozen in frenzied, balletic movement. He also jokingly stated a collection was inspired by \u201ctops\u201d and \u201cbottoms\u201d  \u2014   not the garments, but rather the words denoting sexual preference in the gay vernacular. (Owens is bisexual.) For spring, Owens produced a remarkable collection, pumped with   colors of putty pink, peppermint and sulfuric yellow. But it was the silhouette that made the strongest impact: jackets abbreviated high on the torso, pants billowing organically around the leg, like a fusion of languid \u201930s styles  \u2014   Owens loves that period  \u2014   and   skater trousers. It seemed totally out of place at a moment when other men\u2019s wear designers showed either generic sportswear or predictably straight suiting. Owens isn\u2019t overtly interested in tailoring, the linchpin of the masculine wardrobe since the early 19th century. You seldom see anything approaching a suit jacket in his shows. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be [who] somebody trusts for tailoring over Dior,\u201d Owens says. \u201cEven one of my partners. For his wedding, he wore Dior!\u201d What he does offer is an alternative to the general thrust of fashion. And it\u2019s seductive. His business is relatively small. His turnover is approximately $140 million, paltry when compared to the   luxury behemoths. But it\u2019s perfectly formed. \u201cMy mantra for everybody is better, not bigger,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard. When there\u2019s a group of people together, they\u2019re thinking of the team, and you want to win. Sometimes commercial success is a little bit more tangible than aesthetic success. \u201d Yet for all those disparaging comments about fashion lemmings, and the hordes of devotees clustered outside Owens\u2019s shows in his most extreme looks, a core of his business comes from older, fashionable women and men, for whom a   asymmetric Rick Owens jacket is the dernier cri of   elegance. He also has a substantial celebrity following, although he doesn\u2019t care about things like that. He\u2019s often dubbed a \u201ccult designer. \u201d \u201cI hear the word cult used a lot,\u201d he admits. \u201cWhich means you have a following, but you never hit the popular big time. \u201d But by his own estimation, Owens is not a cult designer. Like the Chanel jacket in the \u201950s, his leather biker jacket has become part of a uniform of our times. Pay attention, and you\u2019ll see it endlessly copied. Owens\u2019s output is prodigious. Alongside his men\u2019s and women\u2019s runway lines and their commercial offshoots, he creates two accessibly priced secondary lines: Lilies, a range of   women\u2019s wear, and Drkshdw, a more unisex streetwear incarnation that began as a denim collection. He also has a fur line, Hunrickowens. (From 2003 to 2006, Owens was the creative director at the French furriers Revillon Fr\u00e8res.) Owens designs nearly every facet of a contemporary wardrobe  \u2014   outerwear and sportswear, accessories and shoes. Or, rather, redesigns it. His sneakers, produced with Adidas and retailing for several hundred dollars a pair, don\u2019t look like other sneakers. With odd protrusions of rubber or leather, they resemble fossilized animal remains strapped to the body. His gloves sometimes have wings of leather, like dorsal fins. He also designs furniture. His dramatic pieces resemble great altars of Carrara marble or prehistoric slabs of    petrified wood. A bed he designed looks like a sarcophagus crafted from alabaster, and weighs over a ton. Even Owens\u2019s toilets, in each of his three homes, look like chalices of marble. OWENS\u2019S FASHION EXPERIENCE began in the commercial world of Los Angeles. After dropping out of art school, he worked for a factory that copied designer clothing in shoddier fabrics. In 1994, he started his own line, selling directly to retailers. He didn\u2019t stage his first show in New York until 2002. A year later, he relocated to Paris. He still doesn\u2019t speak French, which he doesn\u2019t mind. \u201cI was just as isolated in Los Angeles as I am in Paris,\u201d he says. Owens is somewhat reclusive: He doesn\u2019t go out much, his life revolving around his home, the gym and a couple of nearby restaurants. He lives and works in a single building, the former headquarters of the French Socialist Party, on a grand square opposite the French parliament. The only windows in his studio overlook the quiet, deserted garden of the former Ministry of Defense. Here, his aesthetic is complete. The floors and many walls are raw concrete. Owens gutted the building when he moved in, but didn\u2019t do much else. Raw wires hang from the ceiling. I\u2019ve visited him here three times, in three different years. Eventually I understood I wasn\u2019t standing in the middle of a renovation. It was already complete. Owens lives with his wife of a decade,   Mich\u00e8le Lamy, who is a creative force behind many of Owens\u2019s endeavors. She codesigns a jewelry line with Loree Rodkin under the Owens umbrella named Hunrod (\u201cHun\u201d is Owens\u2019s pet name for Lamy, combined with Rodkin\u2019s surname). She also collaborates with Owens on the design of his furs, and on his acclaimed furniture line, an exhibition of which is currently on view at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. She walks in halfway through our discussions, clad head to toe in Rick Owens. Her teeth glisten with gold, her fingers are tattooed and stained black. Together, they look remarkable  \u2014   fascinating and terrifying in equal measure. They seem perfectly at home in Owens\u2019s odd clothes among a grouping of their anthropomorphic spindly chairs that resemble something out of \u201cBeetlejuice. \u201d \u201cThe furniture thing is really about completing . .. \u201d Owens stops, then continues: \u201cOf completely creating my own planet. \u201d Near Owens\u2019s studio window, a huge altarpiece of a table holds an arrangement of stone blocks, flowers and a skull. It looks eerily like a memento mori painting. He begins to talk about the darker themes within his work. His father, John, a former social worker, died in 2015, aged 95  \u2014   which prompted a series of introspective, somewhat nihilistic collections. \u201cHow do you face decline gracefully?\u201d he asks. \u201cI suppose it was because of Dad declining and me getting older and me thinking about how we face change and all of that. Ecological change, and political threat. Me thinking, Isn\u2019t all of this stuff maybe just supposed to happen?\u201d He shrugs. \u201cOur primal urge is to procreate. That\u2019s one of the reasons that we\u2019re on earth, our prime motivation is to procreate and to live forever. We\u2019re doing our best to do both, so isn\u2019t it inevitable that we just overcrowd it until something else happens? We just kill ourselves off? Something\u2019s got to evolve. \u201d These are seldom ideas connected to fashion nor ideas fashion designers willingly talk about. \u201cIt\u2019s sociology and anthropology,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just the way  \u2014   that\u2019s what happens in real life. In real life, the act of creation is defying death. I think it\u2019s just that dumb and simple. \u201d\u2019 \u201dPreamble aside, Owens isn\u2019t feeling particularly dour. It\u2019s early December, and he\u2019s planning his fall 2017 men\u2019s wear collection, which he\u2019ll show a month later in Paris. He named his previous two collections \u201cMastodon\u201d and \u201cWalrus. \u201d They concentrated on the primordial, with thoughts about mankind going the way of the dinosaurs. This season the theme is \u201cGlitter. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s going to be about joyful abandon,\u201d he says. The show is inspired by glam rock, full of   silhouettes with a theatrical bent, a hint of Bowie, possibly meeting Wagner, whose music Owens loves. There are lots of operatic trains. It doesn\u2019t contain sequins, or beading or, indeed, any glitter. \u201cSequins in a collection called \u2018Glitter,\u2019\u2019u2009\u201d says Owens, making a face at such banality. He\u2019s saving the embellishment for his next collection, he says. It\u2019s going to be called \u201cDirt. \u201d \u201cIt was what can be as transgressive as possible for me,\u201d Owens says. \u201cWhenever I do anything transgressive, it\u2019s never out of anger or just provocation. There\u2019s usually something well intentioned, there\u2019s a   spirit behind it. \u201d Owens pauses. He\u2019s worried he\u2019s talking too much again.\u201d \u2019\u201cIt\u2019s just going to start getting corny,\u201d he reasons. \u201cBut there is another side of me that\u2019s thinking not everybody reads those things. Not everybody is reading everything, so you should take every opportunity to put a positive message out whenever you can. \u201d Joy as transgression. It\u2019s a fitting summary of Owens\u2019s work, which, for all its subversion winds up feeling like a celebration of the power and energy of creativity. That Times comment on Owens\u2019s website, disparaging his output, closed with the refrain: \u201cA line needs to be drawn whereby credit is given to collections that deserve it. Too much talk is spent on too little. \u201d I\u2019d argue that is precisely why Owens warrants such consistent applause. His collections deserve to be talked about, by us, and by Owens himself. They\u2019ll be talked about by future generations, too, if Owens proves to be the Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga of our time. Producing designs that defy fashion and challenge physics, turning the hard into soft, the cold into warm, blending masculine and feminine, he very well may be. \u201cI always think that the act of creation is your fight for immortality,\u201d Owens says. \u201cThe energy of resisting death, and trying to be remembered in the best possible way. \u201d He says it lightly. Then he stops talking.'"}, "time": 1742562098.0120442}
