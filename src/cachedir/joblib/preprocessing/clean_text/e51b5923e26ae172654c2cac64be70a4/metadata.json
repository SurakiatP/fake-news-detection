In the mere span of 4 years, the prices have skyrocketed and many families have to pay more in monthly premiums than they pay on their mortgages. Meanwhile, medical costs have been driven up to astronomical prices, making it nearly impossible to pay out-of-pocket for care. \\nAnd these premiums? They are for the crappiest coverage you can imagine. Some families pay $1500-2000 a month for 60% coverage after they pay the $5000 deductible. That\u2019s nearly $20,000 per year before Obamacare pays for a penny of their costs. \\nAnd now\u2026now that insurance companies have gone belly up when they were forced to become a part of the \u201cexchange,\u201d medical costs are skyrocketing, doctors won\u2019t see patients who aren\u2019t \u201ccovered,\u201d employers stopped offering insurance as a benefit, and people lost their jobs due to Obamacare costs\u2026 \\nThe whole thing is failing. Even President Obama has admitted it . And now we have proof that it was planned that way. \\nBut that isn\u2019t the worst of it. The worst of it is that this program was designed to fail and steer us into single payer healthcare, where a government entity can decide what procedures will or will not be covered. They\u2019ll decide who is deserving of cancer treatment and who is not. They\u2019ll mandate things like flu shots and childhood vaccines. \\nOne of the recent Wikileaks shows that Hillary Clinton knew this and was complicit. \\nMelissa Dykes of The Daily Sheeple wrote : \\nIn an email thread dated September 26, 2015 between Hillary and her senior policy adviser Ann O\u2019Leary titled \u201cMemo on Cadillac Tax for HRC,\u201d Hillary wrote, \u201cGiven the politics now w bipartisan support including Schumer, I\u2019ll support repeal w \u2018sense of the Senate\u2019 that revenues would have to be found. I\u2019d be open to a range of options to do that. But we have to be careful that the R version passes which begins the unraveling of the ACA .\u201d \\n\u201cWhich begins the unraveling of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d \\nA Democrat supporting Republican legislation to destroy Obamacare on purpose. How many millions have they raked in on this deal and bilked the American people for in Obamacare penalties because they can\u2019t afford the \u201caffordable\u201d health care? And the American people will look at this like a \u201cvictory\u201d when it does unravel, even though it has been the plan all along. \\nHillary Clinton, that savior of woman and children, knew that this would fail . She is supporting the legislation to destroy it, leaving everyone in America at the mercy of the horrible replacement that she will dream up to redistribute wealth and deal the death blow to the already-struggling middle class. \\nMark my words, as bad as this disaster is, it is only going to get worse.
