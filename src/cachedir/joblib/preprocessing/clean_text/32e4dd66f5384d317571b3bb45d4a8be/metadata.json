Trump have handled their medical histories feels strange, secretive and theatrical (Dr. Oz, anyone? ). But there\u2019s a long and rich history of candidates concealing  \u2014   even lying about  \u2014   the details of their health. In the latest episode of The   we talk to John Dickerson, a history buff, columnist at Slate and moderator of CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d who recalls the United States\u2019 pivotal brush with a president\u2019s   ailment: the heart attack of Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1955. Mr. Dickerson, the author of \u201cWhistlestop,\u201d a new book about the history of presidential campaigns, explains how the White House\u2019s initial resistance to disclose the incident triggered something new in American public life: a deluge of deeply private medical information about the commander in chief. We also speak with the doctor who, more than anyone else, is responsible for our modern expectation that candidates give detailed disclosures about their health: Lawrence K. Altman, a reporter at The New York Times who was the first to interview candidates about their medical histories. Mr. Altman recalls his tough and sadly prescient question to Ronald Reagan when he was a candidate in 1980 about a potential condition that would later haunt him. We also hear from voters in Times Square about whether they even care about candidates\u2019 health. Short answer: not particularly. One voter told us he\u2019d be going with Mrs. Clinton over Mr. Trump. Was there anything about her health that might change that? \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s crazy,\u201d the man said, \u201cand that\u2019s more dangerous than her dying in office. \u201d From a desktop or laptop, you can listen by pressing play on the button above.
