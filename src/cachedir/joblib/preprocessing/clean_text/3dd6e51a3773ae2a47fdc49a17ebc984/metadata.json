The surprise announcement was delivered last Friday by FBI Director James Comey who knew that the action would create a cloud of suspicion around Clinton that could directly effect the outcome of the election. \\nRecent surveys suggest that that indeed has been the case, and that Hillary is now neck in neck with GOP contender Donald Trump going into the home-stretch of the bitterly contested campaign. \\nBy inserting himself into the democratic process, Comey has ignored traditional protocols for postponing such announcements 60-days prior to an election, shrugged off the counsel of his bosses at the DOJ, and tilted the election in Trump\u2019s favor. His action is as close to a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat as anything we\u2019ve seen in the U.S. since the Supreme Court stopped the counting of ballots in Florida in 2000 handing the election to George W. Bush. \\nIt is not the job of the FBI to inform Congress about ongoing investigations. Comey\u2019s job is to gather information and evidence that is pertinent to the case and present it to the DOJ where the decision to convene a grand jury is ultimately made. Comey is a renegade, a lone wolf who arbitrarily decided to abandon normal bureaucratic procedures in order to torpedo Clinton\u2019s prospects for election. The widespread belief that Comey is a \u201cgood man who made a bad decision\u201d is nonsense. He is an extremely intelligent and competent attorney with a keen grasp of Beltway politics. He knew what he was doing and he did it anyway. It\u2019s absurd to make excuses for him. \\nIn a carefully-crafted statement designed to deflect attention from his flagrant election tampering, Comey said this to his fellow agents: \\n\u201cWe don\u2019t ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations, but here I feel an obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed,\u201d Comey said. \u201cI also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record.\u201d ( CNN ) \\nLet\u2019s take a minute and parse this statement. First: \u201cWe don\u2019t ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations.\u201d \\nTrue, because it is not the FBI\u2019s job to do so. The FBI\u2019s job is to dig up evidence and refer it to the Justice Department. Comey is not the Attorney General although he has arbitrarily assumed her duties and authority. \\nSecond: \u201cI also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record.\u201d \\n\u201cSupplement the record\u201d? \\nThat\u2019s a pretty suggestive statement, don\u2019t you think? When someone says they\u2019re going to supplement the record, you naturally assume that they\u2019re going to add important details to what the public already knows. Obviously, those details are not going to be flattering to Hillary or there\u2019d be no reason to reopen the case. So the public is left with the impression Comey is going to produce damning information that could lead to an indictment of Hillary sometime in the future. \\nThis is precisely why normal protocols require that no new investigations be announced 60 days before an election. Why? \\nBecause the public invariably assumes that \u201cinvestigation\u201d equals \u201cguilt\u201d. In other words, \u201cThe FBI wouldn\u2019t be investigating Hillary unless they had some dirt on her. Therefore, I\u2019d better not waste my vote on Hillary.\u201d \\nThis is the logic upon which Comey\u2019s dirty trick rests. He knows the effect his announcement will have because he is law enforcements version of Karl Rove, a bone fide partisan who\u2019s mastered the dark art of political sabotage. \\nAnd just in case Comey\u2019s announcement didn\u2019t produce the desired effect (by destroying Hillary\u2019s chances for victory), a former assistant director at the FBI, Tom Fuentes, appeared on CNN shortly after the announcement was made with more explicit information. Here\u2019s a clip from the interview: \\n\u201cThe FBI has an intensive investigation ongoing into the Clinton Foundation,\u201d Fuentes said Saturday, citing current and former senior FBI officials as sources\u2026 \\nAccording to the CNN report, officials with the FBI and Justice Department met in Washington earlier this year to discuss opening an investigation into possible conflicts of interest between the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton State Department.\u201d \\n(\u201c Former FBI Official: FBI Has An \u2018Intensive Investigation\u2019 Ongoing Into Clinton Foundation \u201c, Daily Caller) \\nOkay. So we\u2019re no longer dealing with just classified emails. The FBI expanded its investigation and is now wading through the real sewage, the pay-to-play corruption scandal that surrounds that vast reservoir of illicit contributions known as the Clinton Foundation. In other words, the FBI is on to something big, really BIG. I can almost see them dragging poor Hillary off to the hoosegow in leg irons and shackles. Isn\u2019t that the impression the above quote is supposed to produce? Here\u2019s more from Fuentes: ORDER IT NOW \\n\u201cSeveral FBI field offices and U.S. attorneys offices pushed for the investigation after receiving a tip from a bank about suspicious donations to the Clinton Foundation from a foreign donor, according to the report\u2026.\u201d (Daily Caller) \\n\u201cForeign donors\u201d, \u201csuspicious donations\u201d, smoky rooms, bundles of money. It all fits, doesn\u2019t it? It\u2019s all designed to increase suspicion and make Hillary look like a crook which, coincidentally, is the relentless mantra of the Trump campaign. Funny how the FBI and Trump appear to be reading from the same script, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s almost like it was planned that way. \\nBut what about the timing of all this? Is it really a coincidence or are Comey and Fuentes part of a one-two punch from the Trump campaign? \\nAnd, more important, what does the FBI actually have on Hillary? According to Fuentes: \\n\u201cWhen the team looking at the Weiner computers went to the team of investigators who worked on the Clinton email case, and showed the emails to them earlier in the week, they said, \u201cThis is really significant. We need to take this to the Director.\u201d ( 2:05 to 2:23 video ) \\nRepeat: \u201cThis is significant\u201d. \\nWhat\u2019s significant? Neither Comey nor Fuentes nor the more than year-long investigation has uncovered anything, unless you think the ridiculous rehash of the 15-year old Marc Rich investigation (which popped up on the FBI website this week) is \u201cnew news\u201d that should alter the course of the election. This is pathetic. If they have something, show us. Otherwise, Ferme ta bouche. \\nCheck this out from Thursday\u2019s Wall Street Journal: \\n\u201cAs 2015 came to a close, the FBI and Justice Department had a general understanding that neither side would take major action on Clinton Foundation matters without meeting and discussing it first. \u2026 \\nThe public-integrity prosecutors weren\u2019t impressed with the FBI presentation, people familiar with the discussion said. \u201cThe message was, \u2018We\u2019re done here,\u2019 \u201d a person familiar with the matter said. \\nJustice Department officials became increasingly frustrated that the agents seemed to be disregarding or disobeying their instructions. \\nFollowing the February meeting, officials at Justice Department headquarters sent a message to all the offices involved to \u201cstand down,\u2019\u2019 a person familiar with the matter said\u2026. \\nAs prosecutors rebuffed their requests to proceed more overtly, those Justice Department officials became more annoyed that the investigators didn\u2019t seem to understand or care about the instructions issued by their own bosses and prosecutors to act discreetly. \\nIn subsequent conversations with the Justice Department, Mr. Capers told officials in Washington that the FBI agents on the case \u201cwon\u2019t let it go,\u201d these people said.\u201d ( Wall Street Journal ) \\nCan you see what\u2019s going on here? There\u2019s a nest of rogue agents running wild at the FBI who\u2019ve been giving the DOJ the finger while they conduct their witch hunt on Hillary. And what have they achieved? \\nNothing! So far, they have nothing. \\nNow, I\u2019m not a fan of Madame Clinton either, in fact I wouldn\u2019t vote for her if they rubbed me down with bacon grease and stuck me in a bear cage, but, c\u2019mon now, do we really want rogue cops and self righteous bureaucrats inserting themselves into our elections and picking the winners? \\nThat\u2019s bullshit. \\nIf the FBI has some solid proof of wrongdoing that will put Hillary behind bars for good, than I say, \u201cBravo\u201d. But until then, they should keep their damn hands off our elections! \\nMIKE WHITNEY lives in Washington state. He is a contributor to Hopeless: Barack Obama and the Politics of Illusion (AK Press).
