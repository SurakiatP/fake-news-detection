[\u201cWe have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it,\u201d is what Pelosi said March 9, 2010 to the National Association of Counties.  Tuesday, Pelosi wrote: \u201cMembers must not be asked to vote on this legislation before the CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation have answered the following questions about your legislation in 2018 and 2019, over the   budget window, and in the decade after: How will this bill measure up to the Affordable Care Act and current Medicaid law on coverage, quality, and cost?  And how will it impact Medicare solvency?\u201d Pelosi said Ryan should appreciate her concerns. \u201cMr. Speaker, as a former Chair of both the Committee on Ways and Means and the Budget, you understand the importance of having the numbers as well as anyone,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe American people and Members have a right to know the full impact of this legislation before any vote in Committee or by the whole House,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThese are critical questions and I hope that Republicans will honor their responsibility to the American people both before the Committees vote and before the final bill goes to the House floor. \u201d What a difference seven years makes.'"}, "time": 1742562210.0262222}
