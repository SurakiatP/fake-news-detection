The penalty for violating the government-wide gag order would be a second misdemeanor charge, however, exemptions would be made for the Attorney General and district attorney\u2019s offices.\\nThe bill sailed through Pennsylvania\u2019s House 151-32 and 39-9 in the Senate, with a significant amount of Philadelphia-area lawmakers voting against it, according to Philly.com . Gov. Tom Wolf (D) still needs to sign the bill to make it law, but he has made no public indication of whether or not he will do so.\\nThe bill was introduced by Rep. Marina White (R) as a means of providing officers involved in shootings \u201cbasic protection from threats\u201d After voting in favor of the bill, Rep. Dominic Costa (D) declared, \u201cWe are the protectors of our protectors.\u201d\\nLast year, then-Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey changed the department\u2019s long-standing policy of releasing officers\u2019 names whenever it felt it was appropriate to limiting the delay to a maximum of 72 hours. Ramsey was quoted by NPR as saying, \u201cI don\u2019t think you can shoot someone and expect to remain anonymous\u2026and I do think that we have a responsibility as a police agency that work[s] for the people to provide that information, unless there are some extenuating circumstances.\u201d If the bill becomes law, it would supersede Philadelphia\u2019s more transparent policy.\\nWriting of the proposed bill, the Cato Institute\u2019s Jonathan Blanks noted:\\nCurrent Pennsylvania law is bad enough as it is. Authorities already have the discretion to release or withhold the names of officers involved in use-of-force incidents. Without a timetable for release of officers\u2019 names, the process to get to the bottom of what happened can be a very lengthy one.\\nTransparency is also a problem for the Pennsylvania State Police , which makes public very little information about its officer involved shootings, nearly all of which are ruled justified.\\nPhoto Credit: Flickr/Savannah River Site\\nAnthony L.
