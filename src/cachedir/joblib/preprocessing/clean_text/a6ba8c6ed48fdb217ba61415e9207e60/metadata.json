[In an online press conference, Assange acknowledged that some companies had asked for more details about the CIA cyberespionage toolkit whose existence he purportedly revealed in a massive leak published Tuesday.  \u201cWe have decided to work with them, to give them some exclusive access to some of the technical details we have, so that fixes can be pushed out,\u201d Assange said. Once tech firms had patched their products, he said, he would release the full data of the hacking tools to the public. The CIA has so far declined to comment directly on the authenticity of the leak, but in a statement issued Wednesday it suggested that the release had been damaging by equipping adversaries \u201cwith tools and information to do us harm. \u201d Assange began his online press conference with a dig at the agency for losing control of its cyberespionage arsenal, saying that all the data had been kept in one place. \u201cThis is a historic act of devastating incompetence,\u201d he said, adding that, \u201cWikiLeaks discovered the material as a result of it being passed around. \u201d Assange said the technology was nearly impossible to keep under wraps  \u2014   or under control. \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely nothing to stop a random CIA officer\u201d or even a contractor from using the technology, Assange said. \u201cThe technology is designed to be unaccountable, untraceable it\u2019s designed to remove traces of its activity. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562649.8844063}
