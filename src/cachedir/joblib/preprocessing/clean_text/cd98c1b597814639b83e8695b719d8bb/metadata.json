At station after station, the train doors would open, and the passengers would look out on throngs of fellow protesters  \u2014   women, men, children, babies, the occasional dog  \u2014   waiting on the platform. As people emerged from underground into the morning air, it was hard to tell where to go, so they found their way by gauging the human density, moving until they reached a spot so full of people that they could no longer move at all. There was an enormous rally happening somewhere in there  \u2014   activists and celebrities speaking into microphones  \u2014   but much of the crowd couldn\u2019t see or hear anything except rumbling waves of cheers. By the time they were meant to march, the crowd was so large that it already stretched across the entire route, from the rally site near the Capitol to the Ellipse near the White House. The signs they carried spoke to any number of issues: immigration, abortion, race, the environment, inequality, the new president. REFUGEES WELCOME, KEEP YOUR LAWS OUT OF MY VAGINA, BLACK LIVES MATTER, SCIENCE IS REAL, FLINT NEEDS CLEAN WATER, NOBODY LIKES YOU. The handmade pink \u201cpussyhats\u201d that many marchers wore  \u2014   a reference to Donald Trump\u2019s    boasts about grabbing unsuspecting women by the genitals  \u2014   had been sneered at in the days before the march. They were called corny, girlie, a waste of time. Seen from above, though, on thousands of marchers, their wave of color created a powerful image. It was, somewhat unexpectedly, one of the largest mass demonstrations in American history. Millions of protesters  \u2014   estimates range from three to five million  \u2014   took to the streets of Washington, Los Angeles, New York, Palm Beach, Fla. Boise, Idaho, even Fargo, N. D. Sister demonstrations were held in Thailand, in Malawi, in Antarctica. The energy of almost every group alarmed or incensed by Trump\u2019s election seemed to have poured into a single demonstration. That it happened on the day after his inauguration was not surprising. What was striking was that all these people had come together under the auspices of a march for women. Just two months earlier, the left did not appear to be a unified front. The polls had barely closed before the infighting began. Some blamed Hillary Clinton for ignoring Wisconsin, or the Democratic National Committee for boxing other candidates out of the primary field. Some blamed identity politics, which made   white voters \u201cfeel excluded,\u201d according to Prof. Mark Lilla of Columbia. Others blamed white people, particularly the coastal ones who couldn\u2019t get their heartland relatives on their side. But a crew of   angry women was still aiming its ire at Trump. In the hours after his victory on Nov. 8, Teresa Shook, a retired lawyer in Hawaii, posted to Facebook, suggesting a march on Washington. Some women on the East Coast had the same idea. At first, these suggestions were so impulsive that they seemed almost metaphorical. But within days, tens of thousands of women had pledged to join in. Over the course of two months, the idea became something far bigger than initially imagined. Eventually, an entire organizing team would have permits,   fleets of buses, portable toilets, celebrity sponsors and support from Gloria Steinem. Men meekly asked their female family members and Twitter followers: \u201cAre we allowed to join?\u201d By the middle of January, with the event shaping up to be the   demonstration, the New York magazine writer Jonathan Chait worried that \u201cWomen\u2019s March\u201d was too niche an organizing principle  \u2014   it was a \u201cbad name,\u201d he tweeted, a divisive \u201cbrand. \u201d The opposite turned out to be true: Women led the resistance, and everyone followed. A march for women managed to crowd a broad opposition force onto its platform. In the weeks since the march, that energy has only spread. After Trump\u2019s executive order halting travel from seven   countries, the march\u2019s striking proof of concept  \u2014   hit the streets, and a surprising number of others will join you  \u2014   fueled more spontaneous actions in unexpected places: outside courthouses, Trump hotels, airport terminals, the offices of Senator Mitch McConnell. At each protest, you were likely to see a few pink cat ears poking out of the crowd, a reminder of the opposition\u2019s first gathering. It seems unlikely that any other kind of march would have turned out quite this way. In this moment, it happened that \u201cwomen\u201d was the one tent large enough to contain almost every major strain of protest against Trump. Those who know their feminist history might see a paradox here. The women\u2019s movement has not always been a site for unity. It has been marked just as deeply by its fractures, failures and tensions. But more than a century of internal turmoil has also forced the movement to reckon with its divisions. Now, the question is whether it can bring even more Americans into the fold. Clinton\u2019s loss on Nov. 8 was a pivotal,   moment in the course of the American women\u2019s movement. In an evening, the   first female president was shoved to the side by what a sizable chunk of the nation saw as that classic historical figure: the male chauvinist pig. In parts of the popular imagination, it wasn\u2019t just a loss for Clinton or for the Democratic Party. It was a repudiation of feminism itself. But Clinton has always been a wary avatar of feminism. In 2008, she didn\u2019t run for president as a \u201cwomen\u2019s candidate\u201d if anything, she campaigned with her sex in the closet and the strategist Mark Penn advising her to harden her image into an American Iron Lady. \u201cThey do not want someone who would be the first mama,\u201d he wrote in one memo. Years later, HBO\u2019s \u201cVeep\u201d would satirize that posture through its own fictional politician. \u201cI can\u2019t identify myself as a woman!\u201d she tells her staff. \u201cPeople can\u2019t know that. Men hate that. And women who hate women hate that, which I believe is most women. \u201d In the eight years between Clinton\u2019s first and second presidential campaigns, though, something shifted: Feminism became fashionable. By the start of the Obama era, incisive women\u2019s blogs like Jezebel and Feministing had already hit the web and started throwing popcorn at the big screen of American culture, covering the same topics that women\u2019s magazines did  \u2014   fashion, movies, sex  \u2014   but taking on the women\u2019s magazines too. By Obama\u2019s second term, this model had thrived and multiplied so many times over that even a   of the sports website Bleacher Report started his own women\u2019s site, Bustle. Soon enough, no corner of culture was safe from a feminist critique, from Christmas songs to \u201cmanspreading. \u201d Pop stars  \u2014   people like Lady Gaga, Katy Perry and Taylor Swift  \u2014   were asked if they were feminists, and if they shied away from the label, outrage would greet them online. Feminism became increasingly popular, but in a very specific way  \u2014   one attuned to the concerns of people with office jobs and time to spend online. The feminist priorities of this new media landscape tended to involve topics that   women would experience firsthand: reproductive rights, catcalling, campus rape, professional opportunity,   representation. The writers setting its tone tended to be young women who were asked to produce large amounts of clickable copy, for not much money, in very little time, exploring feminist issues not through   reporting but through \u201ctakes\u201d on the women already making news: the   balance of Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Marissa Mayer the pay gap between Jennifer Lawrence and her male  . Some content chased sexist slights down to the most passing personal concerns, like an item from The Huffington Post that sighed: \u201cThere is no proper way for a woman to cut her hair, let alone do anything right in this world. \u201d It\u2019s not that women\u2019s activist groups vanished or political organizing stalled. But it did become possible for an American woman to cultivate a relationship to feminism that was primarily consumerist: There were feminist TV shows to watch, feminist celebrities to follow, feminist clothes to buy. Unlike many other major social movements, women\u2019s liberation dovetails neatly with an important advertising demographic, a lesson capitalism absorbed more than a century ago. In 1908, the advertiser J. Walter Thompson hired suffragists to address the growing women\u2019s market. Over the next decades, the industry would slip women\u2019s rights messaging into ad copy. Old Dutch Cleanser offered \u201cfreedom from household drudgery\u201d Shredded Wheat promised a \u201cdeclaration of independence\u201d from cooking. These days, even our bath products have achieved empowerment. Ads for Secret deodorant nudge us to ask for a raise, and those for Always prompt us to challenge stereotypes about girls. Dove wants us to feel beautiful at any size. It\u2019s telling which strand of feminism these brands have deemed marketable: the one that doubles as  . This is a vision of feminism in which the primary thing that needs to change is a woman\u2019s frame of mind. Something similar happened to the pop stars who once hesitated to call themselves feminists  \u2014   they came around to feminism by redefining feminism around themselves. To Lady Gaga, feminism was about protecting \u201cthe integrity of women who are ambitious. \u201d Taylor Swift realized, she said, that she had \u201cbeen taking a feminist stance without actually saying so. \u201d Feminism was being defined down to its most benign interpretation. It was less a political platform than a brand identity. In 2013, \u201cLean In,\u201d by Sheryl Sandberg, raised this   subtext to the level of text. Sandberg called the book \u201csort of a feminist manifesto,\u201d but it preached individual solutions to systemic problems, encouraging women to focus on \u201cinternal obstacles\u201d and \u201cdismantle the hurdles in ourselves. \u201d This feminist mode, where personal success becomes synonymous with social progress, can be plugged into any number of political orientations. The latest model for the   feminist brand is Ivanka Trump, who has built a lifestyle company under the hashtag #WomenWhoWork. A recent pitch neatly weds activist language with shoppable solutions: \u201cWe\u2019re committed to solving problems. If we can\u2019t find a solution, we\u2019ll make it ourselves (case in point: the Soho Tote, the ultimate work bag). \u201d By the time the 2016 campaign rolled around, Clinton wasn\u2019t just permitted to run as a feminist  \u2014   she was practically obligated to. Her messaging shifted accordingly. Years of women\u2019s debating the right way to be a feminist had the side effect of forcing the first female   candidate to the left. In 2008, she argued that she wanted abortion to be \u201csafe, legal and rare  \u2014   and by rare I mean rare. \u201d In last year\u2019s debates, she stopped qualifying her support. \u201cI will defend Planned Parenthood,\u201d she said in one. \u201cI will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend women\u2019s rights to make their own health care decisions. \u201d Meanwhile, her campaign mimicked the aesthetics of the   feminist mode. The candidate affirmed her feminism in a video interview with Lena Dunham, posed in a Kim Kardashian selfie and made a cameo on \u201cBroad City. \u201d Her campaign posted a   listicle informing Latinos that Clinton was \u201cjust like your abuela. \u201d (With the Twitter hashtag #NotMyAbuela, those voters begged to differ.) Her site sold embroidered pillows that said \u201cA Woman\u2019s Place Is in the White House\u201d and a   with a big \u201cYAAAS, HILLARY!\u201d printed over her senior portrait from high school. After Trump accused her of playing \u201cthe woman\u2019s card,\u201d her campaign introduced a free   \u201cOfficial Hillary for America Woman Card\u201d that drove more than $2 million in donations within days. One young woman earnestly prodded her at an Iowa campaign event: \u201cIf you could choose, would you rather be the president or Beyonc\u00e9?\u201d Pop feminism, having been washed of its political urgency, was now being integrated back into politics at the highest level. The candidate who once shrank from feminism was positioning herself as an icon of the movement. Her image became closely aligned with two metaphors  \u2014   the pantsuit and the glass ceiling  \u2014   that speak to a particular kind of woman: a corporate careerist at the top of her field. A \u201csecret\u201d Facebook group, Pantsuit Nation, popped up to encourage Clinton supporters to wear pantsuits to the polls. When she clinched the Democratic nomination for president last June  \u2014   the one she would formally accept the following month, dressed in suffragist white  \u2014   Clinton called back to the Seneca Falls convention of 1848, where \u201ca small but determined group of women, and men, came together with the idea that women deserved equal rights. \u201d The feminist project started there, she implied  \u2014   and she was going to finish it. When Clinton lost, pop feminism suffered a crisis. As everyone pored over exit polls, some of the   fractures between different groups of women exploded into view.   percent of black women voted for Clinton, but 53 percent of white women voted for Trump, perhaps more likely to see themselves in his vision of the world than in the pop feminism that fed Clinton\u2019s campaign. Despite Trump\u2019s palpable, eminently bloggable disrespect for women  \u2014   and that infamous tape  \u2014   he had successfully courted a faction of female voters. His win suggested that Americans were more comfortable with misogyny than many had thought, but it also burst the bubble of cheery pop feminism, which had achieved its huge popularity at the expense of class consciousness and racial solidarity. In some places, you could watch the mood turn in a matter of days. The Pantsuit Nation Facebook group ceased its celebrations and became a site for sharing stories of pain and resilience. But when the group\u2019s founder, a Maine educator named Libby Chamberlain, announced a plan to channel the power of the group in real life, it wasn\u2019t exactly a call to activism  \u2014   it was a   book. \u201cYou are a force, Pantsuit Nation,\u201d she wrote. \u201cLet\u2019s see if we can harness that force within the pages of a book and see it on night stands and coffee tables all around the world. \u201d The idea brought on a revolt. \u201cThe N. R. A. with its five million members has a stranglehold on Congress,\u201d one commenter wrote. \u201cPantsuit Nation has four million members and decides its main mission is \u2018storytelling\u2019 and now, selling books. What a colossal waste. \u201d But for some outside observers, this was a productive comeuppance. Rhon   an associate professor of Africana studies at Williams College in Massachusetts, published \u201cAn Open Letter to White Liberal Feminists,\u201d on the website Black Perspectives, expressing her disappointment that it had taken Donald Trump to shake them into her reality. \u201cI am delighted that you have received the potential awakening of a lifetime, and that now you might actually get what so many of us have been describing all along,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWelcome to that deep perpetual angst. Embrace it, and allow it to motivate you to a deeper form of action. \u201d In those same November weeks, the nascent    project was navigating its own identity crisis. Some of the early organizers had    jobs  \u2014   pastry chef, yoga instructor. One of the women, Bob Bland, a fashion designer, had amassed a small online following by designing \u201cNASTY WOMAN\u201d and \u201cBAD HOMBRE\u201d   and selling them online. \u201cI had this whole network of \u2018nasty women\u2019 and \u2018bad hombres,\u2019\u2019u2009\u201d she told me. \u201cAfter the election, they were looking to me like, \u2018What are we going to do next? \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d Disparate organizers convened around a Facebook event announcing a Million Women March. There was one major problem with this: In 1997, activists organized a Million Woman March in Philadelphia to address the particular concerns of black women. When this new march on Washington unwittingly chose a very similar name, it crystallized the idea that the nascent movement was being run by a handful of white women with no organizing history. Comments began pouring in from all sides. The organizers had stumbled into a conflict that has dogged women\u2019s organizing from the very beginning: Of all the tensions that have coursed through the women\u2019s movement, none has ever been quite so pronounced as the one between white and black women. Consider what happened when Sojourner Truth showed up at a women\u2019s rights convention in Ohio in 1851. Frances Gage, the woman running the show, recalled the scene 12 years later: \u201cThe leaders of the movement trembled on seeing a tall, gaunt black woman in a gray dress and white turban, surmounted with an uncouth sunbonnet, march deliberately into the church, walk with the air of a queen up the aisle and take her seat upon the pulpit steps. \u201d A \u201cbuzz of disapprobation\u201d spread through the church. White women in attendance complained that a black woman\u2019s testimony would distract from the convention\u2019s focus. \u201cDon\u2019t let her speak, Mrs. Gage  \u2014   it will ruin us,\u201d one said. \u201cEvery newspaper in the land will have our cause mixed up with abolition and niggers, and we shall be utterly denounced. \u201d Throughout the convention, men arrived to speak out against women\u2019s suffrage. Women, they said, were too weak and helpless to be trusted with the power of the vote. Because \u201cthere were very few women in those days who dared to \u2018speak in meeting,\u2019\u2019u2009\u201d as Gage put it, their points went unchallenged until Truth stepped forward. White women hissed, but Truth\u2019s very identity nullified the arguments coming from both men and women in attendance. \u201cThat man over there says that women need to be helped into carriages, and lifted over ditches, and to have the best place everywhere,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody ever helps me into carriages, or over mud puddles, or gives me any best place. And ain\u2019t I a woman? Look at me! Look at my arm!\u201d She rolled up her sleeve to the shoulder. \u201cI have plowed and planted, and gathered into barns, and no man could head me. And ain\u2019t I a woman?\u201d In that moment, Truth shattered an idea of white femininity that had been used to both underpin and undermine the cause of suffrage. As a slave, she had worked in the fields like a man as a free black woman, she could not rely on the offerings of white male gentility. Gage wrote that Truth\u2019s testimony compelled the white women in attendance to embrace her \u201cwith streaming eyes, and hearts beating with gratitude. \u201d But two years later, Truth still drew jeers from white crowds when she attended women\u2019s meetings. A vision of whiteness was ingrained in the leaders and the arguments of the mainstream movement. Even the suffragists\u2019 signature white clothes were deliberately chosen to signal purity. This ideal of feminine virtue did not extend to black women, or   ones. Some suffragists made their racism and classism explicit. In 1894, a white woman at a meeting of the Brooklyn Woman Suffrage Association complained that New York had become an \u201casylum for the trash of all nations,\u201d arguing that women\u2019s suffrage ought to be restricted. \u201cThink what it means to give it to all women,\u201d she said. \u201cOur criminal and pauper men have wives there are thousands of female operatives in tobacco factories and similar fields of labor there are probably two million Negro women in this country who are but little uplifted above the plane of animals. \u201d One curious point of this history is that so many suffragists came from the antislavery movement. Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, whose partnership would come to define the suffrage movement in the United States, started their activist careers as abolitionists. But after the Civil War, as black men and all women agitated for the right to vote, a political battle broke out over who would be enfranchised first. (Either way, black women would be last.) In 1865, Stanton lamented having to \u201cstand aside to see \u2018Sambo\u2019 walk into the kingdom first,\u201d as she put it in The National   Standard. Over time, these racial contours would harden into lasting institutions. When women\u2019s social clubs spread across the United States at the turn of the century, two models emerged.   clubs leveraged   women\u2019s leisure time to campaign for social reforms. Black women, who largely worked outside the home, came together around urgent needs. One of the first actions of the black Chicago Women\u2019s Club was to raise money to prosecute a police officer who killed a black man. The main distinction between clubs, the black activist Fannie Barrier Williams wrote, was that for black women, \u201cit is not a fad. \u201d Black women distinguished themselves not only as suffragists but also as vocal critics of a movement that pushed one kind of justice aside in pursuit of another. In 1913, when thousands of suffragists marched on Washington to agitate for the vote, black women were instructed to march in the back. Ida B. Wells defied the order and marched with the delegation from Illinois, her home state. She wasn\u2019t just protesting for her right to vote. She was protesting the protest too. This dynamic is not only a thing of distant history: In the thick of feminism\u2019s second wave, women were often still divided along lines of identity. In 1967, as the   author Betty Friedan called the first meeting of the New York chapter of the National Organization for Women, she found herself at odds with a black activist and lawyer named Flo Kennedy, who pushed the women around her to make common cause with the antiwar and Black Power movements. Friedan and the meeting\u2019s host  \u2014   Muriel Fox, the   female executive at the world\u2019s largest   agency  \u2014   were not pleased. As Kennedy put it in her memoirs, they \u201cwent bonkers. \u201d Friedan\u2019s 1963 book, \u201cThe Feminine Mystique,\u201d had been an awakening for a class of white, married,   women, and she pictured herself as the leader of what she called a \u201cmainstream\u201d feminist movement. When women at one 1970 march offered her a lavender armband to wear in solidarity with a NOW member recently attacked for her bisexuality, Friedan dropped it on the ground, furious at the attempt to add gay rights to her program. Kennedy continually pushed in the opposite direction, trying to build bridges between feminist groups and other movements. At one point, Friedan admonished her to leave the feminist movement alone and \u201cfocus her attention on matters of Black Power. \u201d As the second wave matured, black women found themselves continually calling on it to consider a new approach, one that acknowledged the different needs of different women. As the black feminist and leftist Barbara Smith told the National Women\u2019s Studies Association in 1979, any feminism that didn\u2019t account for the specific concerns of black women, poor women, disabled women, lesbians and others was not really feminism  \u2014   it was \u201cmerely female  . \u201d There has never been one women\u2019s movement. It\u2019s difficult, for example, to say that the American feminist project started in Seneca Falls, N. Y. in 1848, because black women were not invited to that convention. It\u2019s hard to say that electing a woman as president would have been feminism\u2019s crowning achievement, because the success of one woman does not naturally trickle down to all. The history of the women\u2019s movement is one of warring factions and sharp  . But its 150 years of navigating internal disputes put it in a position to lead what seemed, at the end of last fall, like a highly divided left. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing to me now to say it, but I didn\u2019t know the term \u2018intersectionality\u2019 when we started,\u201d Bob Bland, the Women\u2019s March   told me. Now she deployed it often to emphasize the growing diversity of the march. She told various reporters that she had met women working \u201cin so many different intersectionalities\u201d and hoped to reach a \u201ca wide intersectionality of people\u201d in a march that reflected \u201call of the different intersections of human rights. \u201d That magic word comes from a 1989 paper by the legal scholar Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw that was published in The University of Chicago Legal Forum. Crenshaw had studied cases in which black women sued their employers for what appeared to be \u201ccompound discrimination\u201d  \u2014   both racial and gender biases. But they were often told they lacked legal standing: Laws protected them from discrimination as   or as women, but not specifically as black women. Crenshaw used a traffic metaphor to describe the interlocking forms of oppression a person might face. Cars flowed through an intersection in all directions when an accident happened, it could be caused by cars from any number of sides, or even all sides. That metaphor would be plucked from Crenshaw\u2019s paper and grow in resonance over the next two decades, until \u201cintersectionality\u201d became a rallying cry  \u2014   the main point of rhetorical resistance against the tide of   feminist conversation. Even beneath the shiny surface of   pop feminism, dissenters took countless shots at its racial cluelessness, its lack of   its sometimes shallow concerns. Women of color convened on Twitter under hashtags like #SolidarityIsForWhiteWomen to detail their experiences of being sidelined in feminist conversations, and many on the left criticized the way a     feminism was becoming popular just as income inequality between women was ballooning. (It\u2019s hard to \u201clean in\u201d to a job cleaning hotel rooms.) In recent years, intersectionality even popped up in People. com, on Bustle and in a tweet from Clinton. Often the criticism that lies behind this word is brushed off, met with defensiveness, taken personally. (As the founder of Pantsuit Nation wrote to critics of her book deal: \u201cThis is not the place for divisiveness. \u201d) Women turn to feminism because they want to stand up and say something it can be jarring for them be told to sit down and listen to someone else. But the concept became a useful tool for the march on Washington, which set about the task of uniting feminism\u2019s mainstream, popular arm and its dissenting factions  \u2014   all in the space of two months. Soon after the suggestion to march raced across the web, Vanessa Wruble  \u2014   a white producer and   of the media company OkayAfrica  \u2014   made a pivotal intervention in its planning. \u201cI thought the stakes were so high,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt needed to be an inclusive movement, or it was going to be a total disaster. I felt that it could damage the country. \u201d At this critical moment, with the march quickly ballooning into something bigger than the initial organizers could handle on their own, Wruble reached out and urged them to drop the name Million Women March. Then she linked them up with her network, and soon three seasoned activists  \u2014   Carmen Perez, Linda Sarsour and Tamika Mallory  \u2014   got on board. These women hadn\u2019t necessarily supported Clinton, and they didn\u2019t necessarily identify as feminists. But they had experience organizing in communities of color and saw the march as an opportunity to reach a large new audience. When Sarsour got the call, she had just posted a comment on the march\u2019s Facebook page: \u201cCan you include Muslim women and Muslim communities in the list?\u201d The three women  \u2014   one Chicana Latina, one   one black  \u2014   met through their involvement in Justice League NYC, a   initiative. In 2015, they organized a   march from New York to Washington, ending in a rally at the Capitol that drew a small crowd. Now hundreds of thousands of women whose previous interest in justice may have been abstract at best were turning to them for leadership. The question, Perez told me, was \u201cHow do we get them to understand that their liberation is bound with ours?\u201d Meanwhile, the three had some catching up to do with the mainstream feminist perspective. \u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of what I would consider to be deep, transformative relationships with white women,\u201d Sarsour told me. \u201cI\u2019ve been learning a lot,\u201d she said, and working toward becoming \u201cmore comfortable around this movement of feminism that I always felt didn\u2019t particularly include Muslim women. \u201d The organizers appeared on the   radio morning show \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d and loaded their Instagram page with black feminist heroes. But they also posed for windswept photos in Vogue, and some dropped by the Wing, a private Manhattan women\u2019s club with a $2, 250 annual membership fee. Their rally put Angela Davis on the same stage as Scarlett Johansson. When I called Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw in January, she had just returned home to Los Angeles from the march on Washington, where she walked with a group of women from the African American Policy Forum. Her group was so far back in the crowd that they couldn\u2019t hear the rally, and \u201cI\u2019m kind of glad about it,\u201d she told me. \u201cWe were in this sea of humanity. \u201d Wading through the crowd, she said, \u201cI saw all the different issues and people that had found their way under the banner of the Women\u2019s March. It was the embodiment of the intersectional sensibilities that a lot of us have been working on for a very long time. \u201d The women\u2019s movement\u2019s tendency toward a singular perspective is \u201cnot an exceptional problem for feminism,\u201d Crenshaw told me. \u201cPatriarchy works in such a way that these critiques never even surface in a lot of movements led by men. This conversation isn\u2019t always happening in other spaces. And if the conversation leads to more robust ways of thinking about women, feminism and social justice, it can be a very good thing. \u201d \u201cThe   question is: Can these feminisms live together under an   banner?\u201d Crenshaw said. \u201cIt happened for 24 hours all across the world. \u201d When I made my way back to my hotel after the march, the cheers of the crowd fading into the distance, I opened my laptop and saw a different version of what I had just seen in person. Now it was all filtered through my own   bubble  \u2014   that of a   white woman who lives in Brooklyn. Facebook\u2019s trending topics, tailored to fulfill each user\u2019s particular online habits, served me up a   version of the day\u2019s events. It pointed me toward the speeches of Scarlett Johansson and Madonna, and nobody else. As scenes of the march traveled through the media and across the web, the story spun out in even more directions. Twitter lit up with notes of internal dissent and snapshots of signs from the march: DON\u2019T FORGET: WHITE WOMEN VOTED FOR TRUMP and BLACK WOMEN TRIED TO SAVE Y\u2019ALL and I\u2019LL SEE YOU NICE WHITE LADIES AT THE NEXT #BLACKLIVESMATTER MARCH, RIGHT? But for the moment, at least, Trump appears to be the great uniter. In the days and weeks since the march, its energy spilled into spontaneous actions across the country, with protesters coming together on behalf of Muslims and immigrants. Donations poured into Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union. Congressional switchboards were inundated with calls. When The Washington Post polled Americans   it registered a huge shift in energy among Democrats, especially Democratic women, 40 percent of whom said they planned to get more involved in activism. But liberals are not the only ones drawing inspiration from the protests. Flip to Fox News, click around conservative blogs or browse   Twitter, and you can watch the demonstrations fuel a different kind of opposition narrative. After the march, Fox News set clips of rally speeches to foreboding music. Breitbart published photos with the headline \u201cSee what a massive, Hillary shaped bullet America just dodged?\u201d The   Media Research Center aggregated the most \u201cvile and ridiculous signs. \u201d Twitter exploded with   attacks on Linda Sarsour, who was called a \u201cterrorist\u201d who \u201cloves ISIS. \u201d When the annual March for Life hit the Mall to demonstrate against abortion rights, The Blaze called it \u201cthe real women\u2019s march. \u201d (The Women\u2019s March did, at one point, remove the name of an   group from its list of partners, after an uproar.) According to Public Policy Polling, 48 percent of Trump voters think the protesters who convened at airports to protest the travel ban were paid by George Soros. Trump tweeted recently: \u201cProfessional anarchists, thugs and paid protesters are proving the point of the millions of people who voted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\u201d In the first weeks of the Trump administration, the factions that split over his election are deepening along the same lines. Each side seems oddly confident in its political position. Trump supporters call themselves \u201cthe silent majority,\u201d while his critics identify as the \u201cpopular vote. \u201d When I called Eleanor Smeal, a   of the Feminist Majority Foundation, and asked her whether the organization had any plans to reach out to the 53 percent of white women who voted for Trump, her response was to question the margin of error in the polls. \u201cWe don\u2019t really know if we lost the majority or not, and I believe that we did not,\u201d she told me. \u201cI think they\u2019re with us. \u201d For now, the factions of the left seem to have found an accord. But to regain any power in Washington, they will need to sway the center too  \u2014   including some of those women who voted for Trump. The white women of the left, many of whom are just now finding their footing as activists, have been eager to dissociate from that group. Mention the 53 percent, and they\u2019re quick to tell you that they\u2019re of the 47. But of all the people who marched on Washington last month, they may be among the best positioned to reach across that aisle. \u201cI know of no other time when it would be more important,\u201d Barbara Smith, the black feminist and leftist, told me. \u201cThat\u2019s not my work to do, but somebody ought to do it. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562690.2433605}
