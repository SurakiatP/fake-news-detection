Nancy Pelosi ( ) said when Republicans voted for President Donald Trump they were voting a \u201ccertain way,\u201d almost like \u201cany mammal will do. \u201d  When asked if Trump was a dealmaker, Pelosi said, \u201cI will give you this as an example, the first meeting we had, House and Senate, Democrats and Republicans leadership in the White House, this is a big deal. I mean it feels you with some pride to have a seat at the table and a new president, I have been at that meeting with President George W. Bush as a leader and same thing with President Obama, and now here we are with a new president. The first thing he says, \u2018You know I won the popular vote.\u2019 Well, I thought since he\u2019s being unconventional so will I. Because I was respectful with President Bush and we worked closely with him  \u2014  \u201d Joe Scarborough interjected, \u201cI bet you are missing him now? Pelosi replied, \u201cHe told me I would. He said, \u2018You\u2019re going to miss me.\u2019 That was a long time ago. I wish he were president now. I wish Mitt Romney were president. I wish John McCain were president. As far as the Republicans, the people that voted, it\u2019s almost like any mammal will do. They were just voting a certain way. \u201d She continued her story, \u201cWhen he said that, I said, \u2018That\u2019s not true, there is no evidence to support what you just said.\u2019 If we were going to work together, we have to stipulate to a certain set of facts. When we work with President Bush or when we work across the aisle, we all have to start at a place where we are dealing with facts, evidence, and data and you can compromise. You cannot make things up. He said, \u2018Well 3 or 4 million people voted illegally.\u2019 I said, \u2018Well, that\u2019s not true.\u2019 And he said \u2018and I am not counting California.\u2019 That was pretty sad because he didn\u2019t understand his place in history. \u201d Pelosi also said Trump does not sleep enough, adding, \u201cI\u2019m concerned about his fitness for office. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742628424.6765723}
