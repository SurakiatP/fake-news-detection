I\u2019m actually leaning into it a little bit these days. Because  \u2026    it\u2019s a stark reminder that the Democrats [have] no game,\u201d Conway told host Judge Jeanine Pirro. Pirro then asked who the Democratic leader was, to which Conway replied, \u201cIs it Tom Perez, who bears the title of DNC Chair? Is it [Senator] Bernie Sanders ( ) who\u2019s out there with his supporters booing Tom Perez? Is it Hillary Clinton, who won\u2019t go away and saying she\u2019s going to start a political action committee, as if people want her to revisit the campaign?\u201d \u201cThe Democratic Party, as far as I can see, Jeanine, is just this collection of ad hoc protesters.   \u2026     There\u2019s no cohesive or coherent message. There\u2019s no true leader,\u201d she added. Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent'"}, "time": 1742563558.908774}
