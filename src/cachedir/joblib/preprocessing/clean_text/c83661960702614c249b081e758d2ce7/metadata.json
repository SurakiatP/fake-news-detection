Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said Monday during an interview on Fox News\u2019 America\u2019s Newsroom that \u201cthere really isn\u2019t any Common Core anymore\u201d in the country\u2019s schools. [\u201cThe Every Student Succeeds Act [ESSA] which is in the process of being implemented now, essentially does away with the whole argument about Common Core,\u201d DeVos said, adding:  Each state can set the standards for their state. They may elect to adopt very high standards for their students to aspire to and work toward. That will be up to each state to be able to ascertain what is right for that state. We hope that all of them will have very high expectations. \u201d The secretary\u2019s comments come in sharp contrast with President Donald Trump\u2019s statement at a CEO Business Town Hall several weeks ago. During that meeting, Trump returned to his campaign promise to end the Common Core standards and once again make education policy the domain of state and local governments. \u201cCommon Core, I mean, we have to bring education more local,\u201d Trump said at the White House. \u201cWe can\u2019t be managing education from Washington. \u201d The president continued: When I go out to Iowa, when I go out to the different states and I talk, they want to run their school programs locally and they\u2019ll do a much better job  \u2026     And I like the fact of getting rid of Common Core. You know, Common Core, to me, we have to end it. We have to bring education local, to me. I\u2019ve always said it, I\u2019ve been saying it during the campaign, and we\u2019re doing it. DeVos\u2019s statement is similar to that of other establishment Republicans in Congress. In December of 2015, Sen. Lamar Alexander ( ) chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, touted that he and Democrat Sen. Patty Murray (WA) had facilitated the \u201cbipartisan\u201d passage of the ESSA measure that would replace the George W.   No Child Left Behind (NCLB). President Barack Obama signed the bill into law almost immediately, referring to it as a \u201cChristmas miracle. \u201d \u201cWe have reversed the trend toward a national school board, repealed the federal Common Core mandate, and enacted what the Wall Street Journal called \u2018the largest devolution of federal control to states in a quarter century,\u201d Alexander said. A statement on Sen. Richard Burr\u2019s ( ) website following the signing of ESSA into law also said the measure had succeeded in \u201crepealing the common core mandate. \u201d \u201cThis is a big deal,\u201d Burr said about the new law. \u201cIt will bring an additional $24 million per year in funding to poorest children in North Carolina and put a stop to the Common Core mandate. \u201d Establishment Republicans based their pronouncements on the portion of ESSA that states, \u201cThe federal government is prohibited from   \u2026     Mandating, directing, controlling, coercing, or exercising any direction or supervision over academic standards that states develop or adopt, including Common Core State Standards. \u201d Parent activists and education scholars who have studied the law, however, assert ESSA neither repeals the Common Core mandate, nor prohibits the education secretary from coercing states into adopting the standards. In fact, those who have been battling against Common Core in the states say ESSA actually does the opposite: it keeps states anchored to the controversial education reform. \u201cWithin the other 1, 060 pages of ESSA lurk the provisions that will keep states in Common Core, or something that looks very much like Common Core,\u201d American Principles Project (APP) education fellow Jane Robbins and Indiana parent activist Erin Tuttle wrote at The Pulse 2016. \u201cThe Secretary won\u2019t have to mandate anything, because the other parts of the bill contain the requirements for   \u2026     \u2018high standards,\u2019\u201d a phrase that has come to refer to Common Core. ESSA also requires every state to submit its education plan for approval to the U. S. Department of Education. Robbins and Tuttle assert: That plan must be \u201ccoordinated\u201d with 11 federal statutes, including the   Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act passed a year ago the Education Sciences Reform Act, which is all about collecting student data for research the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act, which adds to the Head Start requirements on preschool standards and the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) Authorization Act, which governs the NAEP test that will almost certainly be aligned to Common Core to hide the fact that Common   students perform poorly on NAEP. Requiring state plans and therefore state standards to coordinate with all these federal statutes means, as a practical matter, states will keep Common Core. The ESSA law also says, \u201cEach State shall demonstrate that the challenging academic standards are aligned with entrance requirements for   coursework in the system of public higher education in the State and relevant State career and technical education standards. \u201d \u201cThis is simply another way of saying states must have \u2018  and  \u2019 standards,\u201d say Robbins and Tuttle. \u201cAnd as made clear by the U. S. Department of Education\u2019s own materials, \u2018  and  \u2019 means Common Core. \u201d Upon Trump\u2019s comments earlier this month that \u201cwe have to end Common Core,\u201d American Principles Project senior fellow Emmett McGroarty said, \u201cToday\u2019s comments show that President Trump has not forgotten his promise to end Common Core and return to local control of education. \u201d McGroarty added that Trump\u2019s leadership on the elimination of Common Core in the states is vital from this point forward. \u201cEvery Swamp creature will unite to fight against the president on this, so his leadership will be critical,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe look forward to seeing what steps the Trump Administration will take in the coming months to take power away from Washington D. C. and return it to parents. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628567.5412352}
