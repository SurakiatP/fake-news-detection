{"duration": 0.29975104331970215, "input_args": {"text": "'When Julia Jones arrived at her office in Santa Monica at 8 a. m.  \u2014   by Hollywood screenwriter standards, the crack of dawn  \u2014   she found Stephen K. Bannon already at his desk, which was cluttered with takeout coffees. They were   on a Ronald Reagan documentary, but Mr. Bannon had pretty much taken it over. He had been at work for hours, he told her, writing feverishly about his political hero. Today, with Donald J. Trump, whose election Mr. Bannon helped engineer, on the threshold of power, the 2004 film \u201cIn the Face of Evil\u201d has a prophetic ring. Its trailer has an    apocalyptic feel: lurid footage of bombs dropping on cities alternating with grainy clips of Reagan speeches, as a choir provides a soaring soundtrack. The message: Only one man was up to the challenge posed by looming domestic and global threats. \u201cA man with a vision,\u201d the trailer says. \u201cAn outsider, a radical with extreme views. \u201d The Reagan presidency has been a recurring touchstone for Mr. Bannon since 1980, when as a    Navy officer he talked his way into Mr. Reagan\u2019s election night celebration. It was at an early screening of \u201cIn the Face of Evil\u201d that he met fellow Reagan admirer Andrew Breitbart, the budding conservative media provocateur. Breitbart. com\u2019s scorn for Muslims, immigrants and black activists drew a fervent following on the   an extremist fringe of message boards and online magazines popular with white supremacists, and after Mr. Bannon took control of the website in 2012, he built a raucous coalition of the discontented. More quietly, Mr. Bannon systematically courted a series of politicians, especially those who share his dark, populist worldview: at home, a corrupt ruling class preying on working Americans globally, \u201cthe   West\u201d in a \u201cwar against Islamic fascism. \u201d They were views that placed him closer to the European right than to the Republican mainstream. He made flattering films about Michele Bachmann, the former congresswoman from Minnesota, and Sarah Palin, the former Alaska governor and   candidate repeatedly pressed the television host Lou Dobbs to run for office and flirted with a range of Republican presidential hopefuls, including Rick Santorum, Ben Carson and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Finally, in Mr. Trump, Mr. Bannon found his man. Mr. Bannon told a colleague in multiple conversations during the presidential campaign that he knew Mr. Trump was an \u201cimperfect vessel\u201d for the revolution he had in mind. But the upstart candidate and the media entrepreneur bonded anyway. In August 2015, Mr. Bannon told Ms. Jones in an email that he had turned Breitbart, where employees called certain political stories \u201cBannon Specials,\u201d into \u201cTrump Central\u201d and joked that he was the candidate\u2019s hidden \u201ccampaign manager. \u201d He hosted Mr. Trump for friendly radio interviews and offered tactful coaching. This August, with the Trump campaign foundering, Mr. Bannon took over as chief executive. Like Reagan, Mr. Trump addressed the people he called \u201cthe forgotten men and women of our country\u201d  \u2014   the white working and middle class. He vowed to take on Islamic radicalism, as Reagan had faced off against communism. Echoing the   theme of \u201cIn the Face of Evil,\u201d Mr. Trump declared of the nation\u2019s predicament, \u201cOnly I can fix it. \u201d Ms. Jones, for one, had no trouble seeing the parallels. \u201cTrump,\u201d she said, \u201cis Steve\u2019s Reagan. \u201d Mr. Trump, of course, is not Mr. Bannon\u2019s creation, and the   would not take kindly to any such implication. (Asked on Tuesday by New York Times journalists about Mr. Bannon, Mr. Trump praised him but said, pointedly, \u201cI\u2019m the one who makes the decisions. \u201d) But Mr. Bannon understood better than any other 2016 campaign strategist how many voters were seeking dramatic change, said Patrick Caddell, a veteran pollster, who all but predicted a Trump victory on election eve as most pundits were calling the race for Hillary Clinton. \u201cHe\u2019s been the forerunner intellectually of this moment,\u201d Mr. Caddell said. \u201cHis ideology is that of the outsider and the insurgent. \u201d To understand what to expect from the Trump administration means in part to fathom the driven, contradictory character of Mr. Bannon, whom the   has named senior counselor and chief White House strategist. Rarely has there been so incendiary a figure at the side of a   thrilling Mr. Trump\u2019s more extreme supporters while unnerving ethnic and religious minorities and many other Americans. How did this son of Richmond, Va. who attended Harvard Business School, spent years at Goldman Sachs and became wealthy working at the intersection of entertainment and finance come to view the political and financial elites as his archenemy? Why does a man who calls himself a \u201c  capitalist\u201d rail against \u201cglobalists\u201d of \u201cthe party of Davos\u201d and attack the Republican establishment with special glee? As a filmmaker, Mr. Bannon, 63, has cited both the Nazi propagandist Leni Riefenstahl and the   documentarian Michael Moore as models. In top physical shape as a young Navy officer, and for years wearing the banker\u2019s uniform of expensive suits, Mr. Bannon has in recent years sported flannel shirts and cargo pants. With a paunch and a sometimes scraggly beard, Mr. Bannon has a rugged look that Stephen Colbert described as \u201cRobert Redford dredged from a river. \u201d He is an avid reader of history, fond of citing Plutarch and Plato, and his career reflects a restless, eclectic mind. He has conceived a rap musical based on Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cCoriolanus\u201d (never completed) overseen the troubled Biosphere 2 project, an experiment in the Arizona desert meant to mimic the earth\u2019s ecosystem acquired partial rights to \u201cSeinfeld\u201d before it became a megahit moved to Shanghai to run a company marshaling Chinese computer gamers to earn points for Western players and produced films on Washington corruption, Occupy Wall Street and Phil Robertson of \u201cDuck Dynasty. \u201d Vociferous critics of his appointment, a diverse group that includes the conservative   host Glenn Beck and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who challenged Mrs. Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, have variously called Mr. Bannon a racist, a sexist, an   and an Islamophobe. Interviews with two dozen people who know him well, however, portray a man not easily labeled, capable of surprising both friends and enemies, with unshakable   and striking intensity. (Mr. Bannon turned down a request for an interview, saying he was too busy with the presidential transition.) Fans and foes agree that he is a \u201cscreamer,\u201d a volcanic personality who sometimes resorts to offensive or hyperbolic language. One of his three former wives claimed in court papers that he had said he did not want their twin daughters to go to school with Jews who raise their children to be \u201cwhiny brats,\u201d a claim Mr. Bannon denies. In a 2011 radio interview, he dismissed liberal women as \u201ca bunch of dykes that came from the Seven Sisters schools. \u201d In a radio interview last year with Mr. Trump, Mr. Bannon complained, inaccurately, that \u201c  or   of the C. E. O.s in Silicon Valley are from South Asia or from Asia. \u201d He has sometimes portrayed a grave threat to civilization not just from violent jihadists but from \u201cIslam. \u201d He once suggested to a colleague that perhaps only property owners should be allowed to vote. In an email to a Breitbart colleague in 2014, he dismissed Republican congressional leaders with an epithet and added, \u201cLet the grass roots turn on the hate. \u201d \u201cNo one has called him nice,\u201d said Patrick McSweeney, a former chairman of the Virginia Republican Party and a Bannon admirer who has known his family for years. \u201cHe is the least politically correct person I know. His overriding concern is getting the mission accomplished. \u201d Mr. Bannon encouraged clickbait incitement on Breitbart. com, and links to Breitbart articles are often spread on Twitter and Facebook alongside Nazi rhetoric and racial slurs. Saying he is an economic nationalist and not a white nationalist, Mr. Bannon has dismissed such devotees as the kind of marginal characters who turn up in every political movement, but he has only mildly denounced the bigots among his admirers. Some longtime associates said they had never heard him express bigoted views. \u201cIn the 14 years I\u2019ve known him, I\u2019ve never heard him utter a racist or   comment,\u201d said Peter Schweizer, a conservative author and the president of the Government Accountability Institute, where Mr. Bannon was a founder and the executive chairman. Mr. Bannon\u2019s backers note that several of Breitbart\u2019s top editors and managers are Jewish  \u2014   as was Mr. Breitbart himself  \u2014   and the site is staunchly  . They also point out that Mr. Bannon\u2019s longtime assistant, Wendy Colbert, is   so are Sonnie Johnson, a conservative writer he promoted on Breitbart, and a former Goldman colleague who has been a close friend for three decades and considers Mr. Bannon family, but who asked not to be named to avoid a flood of media attention. Mary Beth Meredith, Mr. Bannon\u2019s sister, said accusations of personal bigotry against him were \u201cabsolutely absurd. \u201d \u201cWe have interfaith marriages in our own family,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have interracial marriages  \u2014   our family is a microcosm of the U. S. \u201d Where some perceive racism and nativism, others see a different  : opportunism. Whatever may be in his heart, they say, Mr. Bannon was happy to draw a white nationalist following to Breitbart, while denying that was his intent. Ben Shapiro, a former Breitbart editor who has been sharply critical of Mr. Bannon, called him \u201ca manipulator\u201d who had \u201cmainstreamed\u201d   extremists for cynical political purposes. Ms. Jones, Mr. Bannon\u2019s former film collaborator, who describes herself as very liberal, said, \u201cSteve\u2019s not a racist. \u201d But, she added, \u201che\u2019s using the    \u2014   using them for power. \u201d Robin Mickle, a fellow Navy officer of Mr. Bannon\u2019s aboard the destroyer Paul F. Foster, remembers that he and some of his idealistic mates were struck by something Mr. Bannon told them in 1978. \u201cHe said he joined the Navy so it would look good on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 because he wanted to go into politics someday,\u201d said Mr. Mickle, a retired defense contractor. Another officer, Sonny Masso, who would stay in the Navy and eventually make admiral, recalls a devoted reader of The Wall Street Journal who picked stocks to buy through a San Diego broker and had an astonishing ability to retain information. He was fit, too. \u201cHe\u2019d run five miles at lunch and he had a   waist,\u201d Mr. Masso said. \u201cVery preppy when we were out of uniform  \u2014   polo shirts with alligators on them, and penny loafers with no socks. \u201d Mr. Bannon was the middle child of five in an Irish Catholic family from a leafy North Richmond neighborhood. His father, Martin, 95, to whom he remains very close, was a telephone lineman who had worked his way into middle management at the phone company. Steve and his two brothers went to Benedictine High School, an   Catholic military school in Richmond where the boys wore uniforms, kept their hair short and were called cadets. \u201cIt was a very conservative world,\u201d said John Pudner, a Benedictine graduate who knows Mr. Bannon and runs Take Back Our Republic, an advocacy group based in Alabama. Steve was bit of a brawler as a boy, said his older brother Mike Bannon. \u201cHe was a fighter. He was a guy that believed what he believed. \u201d On occasion, Steve summoned Mike to the neighborhood pool for reinforcement. \u201cHe\u2019d get in little scrapes and come back and get me, and I\u2019d say, \u2018I wished it wasn\u2019t eight guys we were fighting. If it was two or three, I wouldn\u2019t mind. \u2019\u201d Mike Bannon, eager to rebut charges of racism against his brother, said the boys took two buses to get to Benedictine, and their parents instructed them to give up their seats if a woman boarded: \u201cIt didn\u2019t make any difference if they were black or white or Indian or Jewish or anything else,\u201d he said. Their mother, Doris, who died many years ago, loved to tell them about sneaking Jewish friends into her neighborhood pool in Baltimore  \u2014   past a sign that said \u201cNo Jews Allowed. \u201d She later worked on campaigns for Douglas Wilder, a Democrat who became the first   governor of Virginia. For Mike Bannon, his brother Steve is \u201ca son of the South\u201d who has never shifted his principles or his character. \u201cHe knew who he was in fourth grade and he\u2019s never changed much over the years,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s very comfortable in his own skin. \u201d At Virginia Tech, Steve Bannon got his first taste of politics, winning the Student Government Association presidency in a 1975 race that grew quite heated after he challenged the status quo. An opponent, Gary Clisham, told the student newspaper that Mr. Bannon had \u201cimmense charisma\u201d but predicted that he would get nothing done. After graduation, Mr. Bannon joined the Navy, attended Officer Candidate School and served two deployments aboard the Foster, a destroyer that took him all over Asia and into the Persian Gulf. His basketball style  \u2014   running the length of the court without passing  \u2014   earned him a sarcastic nickname,    said Mr. Masso, his shipmate. Still, he said, Mr. Bannon was popular with the sailors he led in the engineering department, nearly 50 men, the majority of them   Hispanic or Asian. Though his family had Democratic roots, Mr. Bannon, like most of his fellow officers, was scornful of President Jimmy Carter and entranced by Ronald Reagan. At Mr. Masso\u2019s condo, while they watched the two candidates\u2019 debate on television in 1980, Mr. Bannon could hardly contain his excitement. \u201cHe was pacing my living room, and whenever there was a   he\u2019d say, \u2018Yeah!\u2019 like we were watching a boxing match,\u201d Mr. Masso said. When Mr. Bannon heard later that the Reagan election night party was planned for a Los Angeles hotel, the Century Plaza, he worked the phones to try for tickets. When he got the brushoff, Mr. Masso said, Mr. Bannon said, \u201cHey, listen pal, we just got back from the Persian Gulf. \u201d Soon, he had Reagan aide Lyn Nofziger on the phone saying, \u201cThe governor would be honored to have you there. \u201d It was 4 a. m. when their group left the victory celebration to return to the ship, Mr. Masso said. Both men went on to take Pentagon jobs, and Mr. Bannon earned a master\u2019s degree in international relations at Georgetown at the same time. Mr. Masso thought his friend might try to get into politics, but he was accepted at Harvard Business School, and he left the Navy in 1983 to begin a new life. Friends at Harvard and later at Goldman Sachs were aware of Mr. Bannon\u2019s conservative views, but politics was rarely discussed. \u201cHe was in mergers and acquisitions, I was in corporate finance, and we were both working 100 hours a week,\u201d said Scot Vorse, who met Mr. Bannon on their first day at Harvard and joined Goldman at the same time. After less than four years, Mr. Bannon left Goldman to start his own firm, Bannon  Co. which Mr. Vorse soon joined. As head of a scrappy   going up against financial behemoths to get Hollywood deals, Mr. Bannon showed the fierce competitiveness that would later drive his politics. \u201cWe were the underdog,\u201d Mr. Vorse said. \u201cWe were competing for the business of the biggest entertainment companies in the world, and we did well. \u201d Mr. Vorse said Bannon  Co. represented the Saudi businessman Prince Alwaleed bin Talal the Italian media tycoon and later the prime minister Silvio Berlusconi Samsung Westinghouse and other big players. Mr. Vorse was the detail man, he said. Mr. Bannon \u201cwas the visionary, seeing things before anyone else. He was the rainmaker. He was a leader. \u201d Even as they became successful, Mr. Bannon was not a lavish spender. \u201cHe was driving an    Celica convertible,\u201d he said. In fact, Mr. Bannon appears to have gone through some lean moments in the 1990s  \u2014   court records show five federal and four state tax liens for amounts from $10, 993 to $136, 610. Ms. Jones, his film collaborator, said that when Mr. Bannon and his second wife, Mary Louise Piccard, separated, he lived for a time in a spare room at the home of his first wife, Cathleen Houff Jordan. Ms. Piccard had accused Mr. Bannon of grabbing her wrist and neck during an argument, an allegation he denied. But in 1993, as part of the sale of Castle Rock Entertainment to Turner Broadcasting System, he acquired a share of the royalties from \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d a move that would prove extremely lucrative as the show became a cultural force. In 1998, Bannon  Co. was acquired by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, and Mr. Bannon ran a series of companies working at the intersection of entertainment and finance. \u201cVery intense, very passionate,\u201d said Trevor Drinkwater, who worked with him in film distribution from 2004 to 2010. \u201cI was impressed that while he was very right wing, he had a lot of liberal friends. \u201d He saw Mr. Bannon\u2019s dress evolve toward the casual, \u201cthe flannel shirt over the polo shirt. \u201d Through films, Mr. Bannon was turning his attention back to politics. Tim Watkins, his   on the Reagan documentary, said Mr. Bannon worked from 7 a. m. to 2 a. m. \u201cI\u2019ve never known him to, say, go to a ballgame,\u201d he said. But Mr. Watkins found his collaborator\u2019s combativeness wearying. \u201cSteve thinks everything has to be a fight,\u201d he said. Once, an argument broke out when he told Mr. Bannon that the rough cut of the film, at two hours and 10 minutes, should be trimmed further. Angry, Mr. Bannon \u201cactually flipped over the table,\u201d Mr. Watkins said. At first, he recalled, before the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, they intended to make a standard biopic. But the attacks \u201cchanged the film radically,\u201d Mr. Watkins said. Mr. Reagan\u2019s Cold War battles merged with the coda, which showed the hijacked airliners hitting the World Trade Center and people jumping to their deaths. \u201cSteve crafted a lot of the big ideas,\u201d Mr. Watkins said, notably that \u201clife is a battle of good and evil, and history repeats itself. \u201d Lou Cannon, a Reagan biographer, rejects comparisons of Mr. Reagan and Mr. Trump. He notes that Mr. Reagan had been governor of California before becoming president, never demonized opponents and signed a law giving amnesty to three million undocumented immigrants. Nonetheless, Mr. Watkins sees striking similarities and is sure Mr. Bannon does, too. In the Reagan memorabilia he accumulated while working on the film, Mr. Watkins said, he recently found some lapel stickers. \u201cLet\u2019s Make America Great Again,\u201d they read. When his eldest child, Maureen, got into West Point, Mr. Bannon was thrilled and joked about switching his allegiance to Army from Navy. He never missed her volleyball games, and he was at Fort Campbell, Ky. in 2011 when she returned from a deployment to Iraq. \u201cThat was one of the greatest feelings I\u2019ve had, seeing my dad when I walked off the plane,\u201d she said. But through his daughter\u2019s service, he saw an inequity that fueled his anger at the privileged Americans among whom he had long worked. At West Point, \u201che saw a complete, utter lack of people from the upper economic levels of American society,\u201d said Mr. Schweizer, the conservative writer. \u201cHe thought it was appalling, especially because the elite set so many policies that sent these kids into war. \u201d Mr. Bannon was put off by the George W. Bush administration\u2019s creation in 2003 of the Medicare prescription drug benefit, which he saw as a blatant giveaway to the pharmaceutical companies. The financial collapse of 2008 and the bailouts that followed infuriated him, including the devastating effect of the stock market collapse on the retirement accounts of men like his father, a phone company retiree. Mr. Bannon often spoke to friends about his father\u2019s \u201chonest work,\u201d contrasting it with the   he had seen on Wall Street. \u201cWe consider ourselves middle class, and we think the middle class has been shafted,\u201d Mike Bannon said. \u201cBlack, Hispanic, white, everybody. The political class has given them happy talk but delivered nothing. I think that\u2019s what Steve\u2019s talking about. \u201d By the time of a Tea Party gathering in 2010 in New York, Steve Bannon had fully embraced a   diagnosis of the country\u2019s woes: \u201cIn the last 20 years, our financial elites and the political class have taken care of themselves and led our country to the brink of ruin,\u201d he said. By contrast, he said, the Tea Party was backed by \u201cthe people who fight our wars, pay our taxes, run our civic organizations, who build our cities and who hold our neighborhoods together. \u201d Mr. Bannon honed his message as he reached out to politicians, beginning with his films about Mrs. Bachmann and Ms. Palin. He criticized the conservative elite, including some of his former business colleagues. \u201cThe reason I made these films is my buddies on Wall Street said, \u2018These women are a bunch of bimbos,\u2019\u201d he told a 2011 gathering. \u201cI said, \u2018I know Governor Palin and Congresswoman Bachmann  \u2014   they\u2019re every bit as tough and smart as you guys are. \u2019\u201d At times, Mr. Bannon\u2019s rants against the ruling class  \u2014   in which he is at least as unsparing of Republicans as of Democrats  \u2014   strikingly echo populists on the left. In a revealing 2014 talk via Skype to a Vatican conference, some of his words might have come from Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts or Mr. Sanders of Vermont. \u201cNot one criminal charge has ever been brought to any bank executive associated with the 2008 crisis,\u201d Mr. Bannon fumed. \u201cAnd in fact, it gets worse. No bonuses and none of their equity was taken. \u201d But if his scathing economic analysis sometimes seemed to dabble in Marxism, on other subjects, including race and religion, he made no concessions to political sensitivities. After Mr. Bannon met Mr. Breitbart at the 2004 screening of \u201cIn the Face of Evil,\u201d the two men hit it off, bonding over their similar views and a common irreverent streak. Ms. Jones, the film colleague, said that in their years working together, Mr. Bannon occasionally talked about the genetic superiority of some people and once mused about the desirability of limiting the vote to property owners. \u201cI said, \u2018That would exclude a lot of \u2019\u201d Ms. Jones recalled. \u201cHe said, \u2018Maybe that\u2019s not such a bad thing.\u2019 I said, \u2018But what about Wendy? \u2019\u201d referring to Mr. Bannon\u2019s executive assistant. \u201cHe said, \u2018She\u2019s different. She\u2019s family. \u2019\u201d Mr. Bannon\u2019s   friend from his Goldman years said that he had been at pains to defend him in recent years to mutual acquaintances put off first by Breitbart\u2019s reputation and now by Mr. Bannon\u2019s association with Mr. Trump. Most Christmas seasons over the past two decades, he said, Mr. Bannon was \u201cmy only token white guy,\u201d or one of two or three, invited to an annual dinner at a New York City club for nearly a score of   friends who work or worked in finance. \u201cNow I\u2019m getting a lot of, \u2018What happened to Steve? \u2019\u201d from concerned black acquaintances, the friend said. He said he hoped Mr. Bannon  \u2014   and more important, Mr. Trump  \u2014   would more forthrightly denounce the bigots who have cheered them on. Still, he said, he completely rejects the accusations against Mr. Bannon. \u201cHell, no, he\u2019s not a white nationalist,\u201d the friend said. Mr. Bannon took over as executive chairman of Breitbart News in 2012 after Mr. Breitbart died, playing a   role in assigning, approving and sometimes dictating changes to articles, according to several former Breitbart employees. Staff members grew polarized for or against him. Most of them spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed a nondisclosure agreement. They describe a decentralized operation overseen by Mr. Bannon in two conference calls a day. Employees rarely had any idea where their peripatetic boss was because he seemed to be constantly moving between homes, offices or borrowed premises in Florida, Washington, New York and occasionally Los Angeles or London. Mr. Bannon\u2019s critics assert that he sometimes put his political preferences ahead of fairness or even of the facts, directing that stories be rewritten to his specifications and shrugging off protests that his changes might make them inaccurate. While Breitbart did not traffic in outright racial slurs, it specialized in inflammatory coverage of police shootings, immigration and Islam in ways intended to prick liberal pieties. Alex Marlow, the editor in chief of Breitbart, denied that Mr. Bannon ever deliberately permitted an inaccurate story to run on the site. \u201cBreitbart represents certain values, like conservatism, populism and nationalism, and Steve Bannon wanted our content to reflect that,\u201d Mr. Marlow said. He said the site has 45 million readers and should not be judged by \u201ca couple thousand people on Twitter\u201d who express offensive views. In 2011, as Mr. Trump pondered a 2012 presidential run, David Bossie, a conservative activist who headed Citizens United, took Mr. Bannon to Trump Tower in New York to meet him. \u201cThey definitely hit it off,\u201d said Mr. Bossie, who has collaborated with Mr. Bannon on a series of films. Mr. Trump and Mr. Bannon had in common a willingness to defy some   conservative notions  \u2014   for instance, by pushing for a large, costly infrastructure plan to create jobs. Mr. Bannon was deeply impressed in 2014 when an insurgent Virginia Republican, David Brat, managed an unexpected primary race upset of Representative Eric Cantor, the House majority leader. \u201cHe began casting around for other unconventional candidates to support  \u2014   people that were not a part of the establishment and would run populist campaigns,\u201d Mr. Schweizer said. As Mr. Bannon became a steadily more obvious supporter of Mr. Trump, some Breitbart editors and reporters thought he was turning a news site into a propaganda platform  \u2014   though other staff members approved. Mr. Shapiro was the most outspoken critic, saying that Mr. Bannon had \u201cbetrayed\u201d Mr. Breitbart\u2019s mission of \u201cfighting the bullies. \u201d \u201cIn my opinion, Steve Bannon is a bully, and has sold out Andrew\u2019s mission in order to back another bully, Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Shapiro wrote in a statement when he quit Breitbart in March in support of Michelle Fields, a Breitbart reporter who had been roughly grabbed by Corey Lewandowski, then Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager. \u201cHe has shaped the company into Trump\u2019s personal Pravda. \u201d If the criticism bothered Mr. Bannon, he did not show it. He was already deeply involved in advising Mr. Trump, and he believed, unlike most pollsters and pundits, that the chaotic,   campaign had a chance. One warm evening in August, after Mr. Trump called on Mr. Bannon to take charge of the campaign, Mr. Caddell, the pollster, met with him at a New York hotel, sitting outside on a veranda. Mr. Bannon said he knew the campaign needed discipline, with Mr. Trump more consistently presenting himself as a populist outsider, Mr. Caddell recalled. \u201cHe said, \u2018Believe me, I\u2019m going to bring this home. I know what needs to be done, and I\u2019m going to do it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Caddell said. Whatever Reagan scholars like Mr. Cannon might say, Mr. Bossie, who also joined the Trump campaign, said that he and Mr. Bannon discussed Reagan parallels as they saw huge crowds waiting for hours to hear Mr. Trump. Mr. Reagan had run when many voters felt the country was threatened at home and abroad, Mr. Bossie said. \u201cYou can see the same things today with Donald Trump  \u2014   that America has lost its way and it\u2019s lost its strength, and Americans are looking for leadership,\u201d he said. Kellyanne Conway, who took the job of campaign manager when Mr. Bannon became chief executive, would later call him \u201cthe general\u201d who made many critical decisions. He pushed for Mr. Trump to visit Flint, Mich. where the water supply was contaminated with lead, and to appear at a black church. Mr. Bannon also hugely accelerated the tempo of what he thought had been a    campaign.
