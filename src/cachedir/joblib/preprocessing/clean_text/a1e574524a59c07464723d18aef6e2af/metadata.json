Mrs. Clinton shares more with the defeated \u201cRemain\u201d campaign than a similar slogan  \u2014   her \u201cStronger Together\u201d echoing its \u201cStronger In. \u201d Her fundamental argument, much akin to Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s against British withdrawal from the European Union, is that Americans should value stability and incremental change over the risks entailed in radical change and the possibility of chaos if Donald J. Trump wins the presidency. She offers reasonableness instead of resentment, urging voters to see the big picture and promising to manage economic and immigration upheaval, just as Mr. Cameron did. She, too, is a pragmatic internationalist battling against nationalist anger, cautioning that the turmoil after the   Brexit vote underscores a need for \u201ccalm, steady, experienced leadership in the White House. \u201d But prudence is cold comfort to people fed up with    . According to their friends and advisers, Mrs. Clinton and former President Bill Clinton have worried for months that she was out of sync with the mood of the electorate, and that her politically safe messages  \u2014   like \u201cI\u2019m a progressive who gets results\u201d  \u2014   were far less compelling to frustrated voters than the \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d of Senator Bernie Sanders or Mr. Trump\u2019s   promise to \u201cMake America Great Again. \u201d Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump won a combined 25 million votes during the primary season, compared with 16 million for Mrs. Clinton. And while many of Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters are expected to support her in November, she has not recalibrated her message to try to tap into the anger that he and Mr. Trump channeled. Nor does Mrs. Clinton have any plans, advisers say, to take cues from the Brexit campaign and start   her support for globalized markets, or denouncing porous borders, illegal immigrants and the lack of job protections in   agreements. Much distinguishes the presidential contest from the British fight, of course, including a    matchup between   candidates, a sharply different economic context, and a long and proud history of immigration. Yet in addition to worrying that she is out of step, Mrs. Clinton is somewhat hemmed in by her record: She supported her husband\u2019s North American Free Trade Agreement, which caused significant economic pain in the industrial Midwest after it went into effect in 1994. And her nuanced views about free trade are a harder sell to many voters than Mr. Trump\u2019s   vows to trash bad trade deals and use tariffs as economic weapons of national defense. While Mrs. Clinton is counting on Mr. Trump\u2019s history of racist and sexist remarks to doom his candidacy, Thursday\u2019s Brexit referendum was an unnerving reminder that voter anger is deeper and broader than many elite politicians and veteran pollsters realize. In swing states like Ohio, many Democrats and Republicans yearn for an economic comeback and are not confident that Mrs. Clinton understands their frustrations or has the ideas and wherewithal to deliver the sort of change that could satisfy them. \u201cBrexit is clearly a cautionary tale for the Clinton campaign not to get too complacent with a potential victory,\u201d said David B. Cohen, a professor of political science at the University of Akron. \u201cTrump, Sanders and those in Great Britain who ran the Leave campaign are tapping into an anger and anxiety that is clearly festering.   folks in the United States are similar to   folks in Europe. And a lot of those   people feel as if the international economic system is not working for them and strangling the middle class. \u201d Mike DuHaime, a Republican strategist, said the British vote was the clearest sign yet that \u201cthe intensity against the status quo is far more real than many are still willing to acknowledge. \u201d \u201cIf the Trump victory in the primary wasn\u2019t enough of one, the Brexit vote serves as a major   call indicating just how frustrated average voters are with those in power,\u201d Mr. DuHaime said. Several Democrats cautioned against drawing too many lessons from the Brexit vote, saying mass immigration and economic malaise were bigger problems in Britain and the European Union than in the United States. They also said many British voters were revolting against a bureaucracy in Brussels that they regarded as bloated, overpaid and prone to interfering in the affairs of sovereign countries. Yet the Democrats acknowledged that the worldview held by Mrs. Clinton and many of the party\u2019s elites was not as attractive to many voters as it once was. \u201cLiberal internationalism seems to have been dying for a while,\u201d said Mark S. Mellman, a Democratic pollster who is not involved with the Clinton campaign. \u201cBut while that may be the animating philosophy of foreign policy intellectuals the world over, it is not the animating philosophy of America, nor of our domestic politics. \u201d For Sean Harrington, a husband and father of three who owns the Town Pump Tavern in downtown Detroit, the support for   deals and international markets cannot die fast enough. Taking a break from his bookkeeping duties on Friday, he said President Clinton\u2019s economic policies were still \u201cruining the economy\u201d by giving benefits to large corporations that move jobs overseas, while in states like Michigan, \u201cthe average work force loses. \u201d \u201cIf my fellow Americans were doing better, there would be more money around and traded in and out of my pockets,\u201d said Mr. Harrington, a registered independent who is undecided between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump. On the campaign trail, Mrs. Clinton regularly pledges to \u201cmake sure our economy works for everyone, not just those at the top,\u201d as she put it on Wednesday in Raleigh, N. C. where she also promised to reject \u201cbad trade deals and unfair trade practices. \u201d She also argued in favor of Britain\u2019s remaining in the European Union. But she was not surprised that the \u201cLeave\u201d campaign won, her advisers said Friday, because she understands the extent of voter anger. Her advisers said they were confident the referendum in Britain did not mirror the presidential election in the United States. \u201cThese are two different countries, with very different circumstances and demographics, facing different choices,\u201d said Jennifer Palmieri, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s communications director. \u201cWe believe American voters are looking for concrete solutions to address their economic frustrations and unlikely to find the turmoil, economic uncertainty and roiling of markets caused by the Brexit vote particularly appealing. \u201d Frank Luntz, a Republican expert on political messaging, said Mr. Cameron and the \u201cRemain\u201d camp had failed to \u201cpersonalize, individualize or humanize their campaign. \u201d The \u201cStronger Together\u201d slogan shared by the \u201cRemain\u201d campaign and Mrs. Clinton feels bloodless and overly intellectual compared with the more emotional,   appeals of Mr. Trump and the \u201cLeave\u201d movement, he said. \u201cThe problem with the concept of \u2018together\u2019 is that it promotes groupthink rather than individual pursuits,\u201d Mr. Luntz said. \u201cWe are in an age of individual action, not collective responsibility. \u201d Mrs. Clinton\u2019s arguments against Mr. Trump often require a great deal of explanation to voters, which can sometimes turn them off. While Mr. Trump thrills his audiences with big promises  \u2014   without saying much about how he would fulfill them  \u2014   Mrs. Clinton can get caught in the gears of policy. One recent exception was a foreign policy speech in early June, when she hit a rhythm and ripped into Mr. Trump with memorable lines like \u201cHe says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the Miss Universe pageant in Russia. \u201d But when Mrs. Clinton takes pains to explain why Mr. Trump\u2019s promises and policies do not add up, or are too risky, she runs a risk of her own: that she will sound as though she is instructing or talking down to her audience. Not many voters want a lecturer as president. \u201cA slogan and a message must be aspirational  \u2014   either give people hope things will get better or that the bad stuff will stop  \u2014   both,\u201d said Ruth Sherman, a political communications analyst who is not affiliated with any campaign. Referring to one of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s taglines, she said: \u201cHillary\u2019s \u2018I\u2019m with her\u2019  \u2014   I remember thinking when I first saw it, \u2018Really?\u2019 It\u2019s not my job to be with her. She should be with me. \u201d If Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d is resonant  \u2014   \u201cby far the best slogan of all the candidates,\u201d Ms. Sherman said  \u2014   Mrs. Clinton is counting on voters to appreciate policy ideas that are more strategic than  . She argued in Raleigh, for instance, that markets like the European Union \u201cwork best when all the stakeholders share in the benefits. \u201d While that statement was hardly in the aspirational vein that Ms. Sherman recommends, it set a clear goal and was less divisive than Mr. Trump\u2019s comments on the British referendum. The American electorate has tilted this year toward presidential candidates who make them feel as much as think, but Mrs. Clinton and her allies hope that voters will reflect on the vote in Britain and opt for the steadiness and predictability that she promises. \u201cI don\u2019t think the average American who has a retirement account right now is thrilled about Donald Trump\u2019s support of Brexit,\u201d said Thomas R. Nides, who was a deputy secretary of state under Mrs. Clinton. \u201cHillary Clinton understands we always need to change  \u2014   but change that doesn\u2019t cause unintended consequences for the average American. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563395.9591134}
