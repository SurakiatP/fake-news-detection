Marsha Blackburn ( ) discussed the possible elimination of the FCC\u2019s 2016 broadband privacy rules on Tuesday\u2019s Breitbart News Daily with SiriusXM host Alex Marlow. [\u201cThe Senate, under the leadership of Sen. Flake, took this up last week,\u201d Blackburn said. \u201cWhat we are doing is recalling a privacy rule that the FCC issued right at the end of the Obama administration, and the reason we are doing this is because it is additional and duplicative regulation. \u201d  \u201cThe FCC already has the ability to oversee privacy with broadband providers,\u201d she explained. \u201cThat is done primarily through Section 222 of the Communications Act, and additional authority is granted through Sections 201 and 202. Now, what they did was to go outside of their bounds and expand that. They did a swipe at the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission, the FTC. They have traditionally been our nation\u2019s primary privacy regulator, and they have done a very good job of it. \u201d  \u201cWhat the FCC did was clearly overreach. It gives you two sets of regulators that you\u2019re trying to comply with, not one. So we are recalling the FCC\u2019s rule, and that authority will go back to the FTC,\u201d she said. Blackburn said Congress wants to ensure \u201cprivacy is being overseen, protected, and that when there is a necessity for enforcement, that it\u2019s being exercised  \u2014   if there is a necessity for penalties, that they are being placed. \u201d \u201cIn the physical space, that has rested with the FTC,\u201d she noted. \u201cSo if someone were to abridge your online privacy and sell your information without your knowledge, without your consent, that would be something that the regulators would go after. Let\u2019s say if someone starts to wholesale sell your data, and you said, \u2018Do not share my data. Do not share my information,\u2019 that\u2019s the kind of effect that it has. \u201d She said Congress was aware of the need for more privacy and   legislation, as opposed to regulations promulgated by agencies. \u201cThe other thing with the broadband providers, let\u2019s say your ISP which is holding data, and they were to scoop up that data and then begin to sell that history without your knowledge. They are prohibited from doing that, and the FCC currently has the authority to go after them. The FTC has the ability to protect consumers, and that is what they do. They are the primary regulator. But let\u2019s say an ISP begins to sell that data, then there would be complaints filed, and the FCC would go after that broadband provider under the regulations that are on the books,\u201d Blackburn said. Marlow raised criticism that Internet users will be exploited by aggressive advertisers if the 2016 FCC rule is recalled. \u201cWhat the Obama administration did  \u2014   and I will say they did this against this, against the wishes of a lot of Democrats  \u2014   they reclassified your Internet service as Title II, which is a common carrier classification. It is the rule that governs telephone usage,\u201d Blackburn responded. \u201cThose rules were put on the books in the thirties. So what the Democrats did, and this was pushed by the White House in the last administration, they reclassified Internet, which is an information service, as a telephone service, and then put those   rules on top of your Internet service. \u201d  \u201cThey did that so they could tax it, so they could begin to regulate it. Then one of the additional regulations  \u2014   which is going to cost money for compliance and paperwork and additional bureaucrats  \u2014   one of those regulations is privacy. But as we say, the authority that they need to oversee broadband is already articulated in Section 222 of the Communications Act,\u201d she said.  \u201cYou don\u2019t need another layer of regulation. It\u2019s like flashing alerts: We don\u2019t need net neutrality. We don\u2019t need Title II. We don\u2019t need additional regulations heaped on the Internet under Title II. The Internet is not broken. It has done just fine without the government controlling it. That\u2019s the way it should stay,\u201d she contended. Blackburn said Democrats \u201cthink government is the solution for all things. It should be either the bureaucracy or the courts that are solving the problems. \u201d \u201cTo them, another added layer of regulation, where you are having a federal agency require compliance of businesses, so now they\u2019re having to file compliance papers with two regulators, not one  \u2014   they don\u2019t see a problem with that,\u201d she charged. \u201cWhat we\u2019re saying is, it is unnecessary it\u2019s an added cost to doing business. Who pays those costs of doing business? It\u2019s the consumer. It\u2019s the end user. \u201d Blackburn said Ajit Pai is \u201cdoing a great job as chairman of the FCC. \u201d \u201cHe was my pick to lead the FCC, and I\u2019m thrilled that he is there,\u201d she said. \u201cHe understands the utilization of the Internet, all the   components. He understands the backbone of the Internet and what and how it works. He understands why we need to be careful with spectrum so that we increase broadband deployment and utilize that spectrum in the Internet of Everything. Ajit knows that these components are critical for economic growth and jobs growth in this country. \u201d  \u201cWe are very fortunate to have someone with skill set and understanding as we turn the corner and put the focus on broadband expansion in the country. I\u2019m looking forward to working with him. I talk with him regularly,\u201d she said.  \u201cWe are going to go through reauthorization of the FCC, which has not been done since the early nineties. We are going to go through reauthorization of the NPIA. We\u2019re going to put some emphasis on spectrum management and spectrum utilization from a government and also a private sector standpoint and do what we can to get broadband into these unserved areas across the country. We\u2019re full steam ahead on that,\u201d she promised. Marlow suggested unsolicited robocalls are an annoyance the American public would like to see controlled more tightly. \u201cThat is something that\u2019s called the TCPA. Looking at how individuals interface with their customers is what we will do in that,\u201d Blackburn replied, referring to the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991. \u201cWe\u2019ll pull that up after we do reauthorizations and then do a revisit on some of the components of the TCPA. \u201d \u201cPeople who want to work with their customers need the ability to do   with them, but we also want to make certain that people are not harassed, if you will, by unwanted marketing calls,\u201d she said.
