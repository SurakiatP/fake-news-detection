Every table in Rue La Rue Cafe  \u2014   a new restaurant in Washington Heights dedicated to Rue McClanahan and her hit television series, \u201cThe Golden Girls\u201d  \u2014   was occupied, including one in a replica of the kitchen set from the show. The pumps Ms. McClanahan (Blanche) wore in the pilot episode are displayed in a glass case. Mannequins draped in her gowns surrounded a pianist and guitarist playing mellow jazz on a corner stage. Behind them, on a pedestal, was her 1987 Emmy for lead actress. When the musicians took a break, a mounted television was turned up so customers could watch episodes that play steadily. Conversation happily quieted as Bea Arthur (Dorothy) and Hal Linden were heard saying good night after a   date. \u201cThis is a museum!\u201d said a woman in line to order. From behind the counter, the   Michael J. LaRue, replied, \u201cIt\u2019s a museum with good food. \u201d Few series radiate the necessary warmth to justify a tribute restaurant, but \u201cThe Golden Girls,\u201d that enduring electric blanket of American television, is a part of the culture that people have held tight. It has been 25 years since the end of the sitcom about four older Miami housemates  \u2014   Dorothy, the salty wit Rose (Betty White) the lovable dim bulb Sophia (Estelle Getty) the Italian spitfire and Blanche, the Southern vixen  \u2014   but fans keep finding new ways to love it, with countless parodies, action figures and   and Hulu\u2019s recent nabbing of exclusive streaming rights. For all the show\u2019s zany plots, what fans seem to cherish most are the intimate scenes in which the four friends sit around their kitchen table, sharing a cheesecake and talking into the night. That spirit has now become a guiding force for Mr. LaRue, 53, who owns the restaurant with Ms. McClanahan\u2019s son, Mark Bish. Mr. LaRue first met Ms. McClanahan at an animal rights charity event at Studio 54. They quickly became best friends, he said, and she repeatedly asked him, in jest, to marry her so she could be Rue LaRue. When Ms. McClanahan died in 2010, he became the executor of her estate, which includes an extensive personal archive that Ms. McClanahan wanted made available to her fans. \u201cA little voice in my head said, \u2018Restaurant! \u2019\u201d Mr. LaRue said during a recent interview. A   resident of Washington Heights, he had no other neighborhood in mind for the new spot. \u201cBefore, we\u2019d have to go downtown for good food and live entertainment,\u201d he said. \u201cI want people to stay in the neighborhood, and if they don\u2019t live here, to come uptown. \u201d Construction on the space, formerly a pet store, lasted nearly a year. The bathroom was outfitted to match the show\u2019s pink and mint tiles, with a bawdy door Ms. McClanahan had designed for her California house. The banana leaf Martinique wallpaper on two walls was   to match its exact look in Blanche\u2019s bedroom. CHOCnyc, an Inwood bakery, created a cheesecake in honor of each Girl, and the Bronx Brewery provided two custom beers. The menu, from Michele Weber, formerly the chef at Good Enough to Eat, will feature nods to the show  \u2014   lasagna al forno, Gen\u00fcgenfl\u00fcrgen cake  \u2014   and recipes shared by the cast: Ms. Arthur\u2019s chutney, Ms. White\u2019s angel food cake, Ms. Getty\u2019s pasta salad. There are also signature coffee blends: Sophia\u2019s \u201cPicture It\u201d Sicilian Roast (inspired by a favorite line of the character) Rose\u2019s St. Olaf blend, Dorothy\u2019s   Roast, and, for a little spice, Blanche\u2019s Gentlemen Caller\u2019s Beans. \u201cMy grandma loved the show,\u201d said Patrick Rickerfor, 41, who was making his fourth visit to Rue La Rue. \u201cShe was from Honduras and didn\u2019t understand English all that well, but she got the slapstick comedy. \u201d Ana Perez, 28, was back for the second day in a row. \u201cI\u2019m a Blanche,\u201d she admitted proudly. Anabel Perez, 23, her sister, said, \u201cI\u2019m a Dorothy. \u201d \u201cAnd we\u2019ve got a little Sophia over there,\u201d Ana added, gesturing to their young cousin, buried in a game on her smartphone. \u201cIt was my favorite show growing up. That episode where Mario Lopez got deported makes me cry. \u201d Junko (a Sophia) and Paul Lindberg (a Rose) were   when they noticed that the cafe had opened. They threw their bags down at home and raced over. \u201cWe used to walk by here every day, thinking, \u2018When\u2019s it going to open? \u2019\u201d Ms. Lindberg said. \u201cMy mom in Japan keeps asking me, \u2018Is that cafe open yet? \u2019\u201d Bix Gabriel, from Bloomington, Ind. and her sister Marisa Gabriel, from Adelaide, Australia, overheard talk of the place in an Ethiopian restaurant a few nights earlier and frantically Googled. \u201cWe sang the theme song coming in,\u201d Bix Gabriel said. \u201cThe show was so progressive and ahead of its time,\u201d Joe Samalian, Ms. Gabriel\u2019s husband, added. \u201cIt passes the Bechdel test like you wouldn\u2019t believe. \u201d \u201cI must say,\u201d Marisa Gabriel said, leaning in, \u201c\u2018The Golden Girls\u2019 is the best cure for postpartum depression. I have two children, and I watched it each time, and it helped me immensely. \u201d Mr. LaRue echoed a similar sentiment: \u201cI know people who put on \u2018Golden Girls\u2019 DVDs the way others take a Valium. \u201d One of the walls features photographs of Ms. McClanahan\u2019s six husbands, while another is dedicated to Ms. White, the last surviving Girl, who hopes to get to Rue La Rue in the spring. Near the end of Ms. McClanahan\u2019s life, Ms. White sent her a fresh orchid every week, as well as pears and oranges from California. \u201cShe would call and say, \u2018Can I talk to Ruesy? \u2019\u201d Mr. LaRue recalled. \u201cOne day, right before the stroke, do you know what they were talking about? Ryan Reynolds. Betty was in that movie \u2018The Proposal,\u2019 and Rue\u2019s in the hospital, like, \u2018Who\u2019s that young man? He\u2019s delicious.\u2019 She was   up until the last minute of her life. \u201d Mr. LaRue is full of these stories, and happy to share them. \u201cShe sewed for me, she baked for me,\u201d he said. \u201cMy mother died when I was 8 years old. I had this hole in my being that I didn\u2019t even realize. \u201d A sidewalk plaque at the entrance bears Ms. McClanahan\u2019s name and the opening lyrics of the show\u2019s theme song, \u201cThank You for Being a Friend. \u201d Some of her ashes are buried underneath. \u201cThere\u2019s never a time when \u2018The Golden Girls\u2019 is not playing on this globe,\u201d Mr. LaRue said. \u201cIt taps into something that we all share as human beings  \u2014   a fear that as we age we\u2019re going to become irrelevant and alone. The show is a tonic for that fear. It says you can still look good and have sex and have a very full life, with friends. \u201d \u201cI once asked Rue why she got married so often, and she said, \u2018I don\u2019t want to die alone,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd she didn\u2019t I was there, holding her. I was able to look in her eyes and tell her, \u2018Everything\u2019s going to be O. K. you have nothing to worry about. \u2019\u201d He smiled, suddenly teary. \u201cI still miss her. \u201d Looking around the cafe, he added, \u201cBut she would love this. \u201d On the television, Ms. McClanahan, Ms. Arthur and Ms. White sang \u201cMr. Sandman\u201d to lull a baby to sleep. Patrons, seeking shelter from the cold, happily watched. The baby quieted, and the Girls tried to tiptoe off. He cried, and they started up again. They sang until he slept.'"}, "time": 1742563982.45161}
