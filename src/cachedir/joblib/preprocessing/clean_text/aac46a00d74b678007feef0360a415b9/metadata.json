The blast is likely to disrupt NASA\u2019s cargo deliveries to the International Space Station, exposing the risks of the agency\u2019s growing reliance on private companies like SpaceX to carry materials and, soon, astronauts. The explosion, at Cape Canaveral, Fla. intensified questions about whether Mr. Musk is moving too quickly in his headlong investment in some of the biggest and most complex industries, not just space travel but carmakers and electric utilities. This is not the first problem Mr. Musk has suffered as he tries to create space travel that is cheap and commonplace. Each of his companies, including Tesla and SolarCity, has hit major stumbling blocks recently. The owner of a Tesla car died in May in a crash using the company\u2019s autopilot software, and SolarCity faces major financial challenges. \u201cSpaceX is running a punishing schedule,\u201d said Scott Pace, the director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University and a former NASA official. \u201cThere is probably some human factor involved here. To what extent was human error part of this? And if so, why? Are you running your people too hard? What are your safety requirements?\u201d Dr. Pace said an internal investigation would have to look at the company\u2019s operations as it tried to ramp up the pace of launches. The company\u2019s president, Gwynne Shotwell, said in a statement, \u201cOur No. 1 priority is to safely and reliably return to flight for our customers, and we will carefully investigate and address this issue.\u201c The Falcon 9 rocket burst into flames in a violent series of blasts starting at 9:07 a. m. spewing plumes of dark smoke around the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and sending vibrations felt by residents nearby. The rocket had been set to launch on Saturday, carrying a satellite for Spacecom, an Israeli company. The explosion was particularly painful news for Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, who is touring Kenya, promoting a program reliant on the satellite, known as   with entrepreneurs in the country. He had promised them connectivity. Just hours after the news of the explosion broke, Mr. Zuckerberg expressed disappointment on his Facebook page \u201cthat SpaceX\u2019s launch failure destroyed our satellite,\u201d a swipe at Mr. Musk and his team, who were still trying to figure out what went wrong. Mr. Musk did not respond publicly to Mr. Zuckerberg. But he posted a brief explanation on Twitter: \u201cLoss of Falcon vehicle today during propellant fill operation. Originated around upper stage oxygen tank. Cause still unknown. More soon. \u201d The Falcon 9, developed by SpaceX with NASA financing, has had previous problems. In June 2015, a rocket carrying NASA cargo to the International Space Station fell apart   when a strut holding a helium bottle snapped, setting off a chain of events that destroyed the rocket moments later. This latest episode is likely to push back the timetable NASA had after hiring SpaceX and Boeing to carry astronauts to the space station by the end of next year. NASA said it was too soon to say how the explosion would affect its space station operations, asserting that it remained \u201cconfident\u201d in its commercial partners. \u201cToday\u2019s incident  \u2014   while it was not a NASA launch  \u2014   is a reminder that spaceflight is an incredible challenge, but our partners learn from each success and setback,\u201d the agency said. SpaceX\u2019s next cargo mission to the space station is scheduled for November. Coincidentally on Thursday, a report released by NASA\u2019s inspector general, Paul K. Martin, said SpaceX and Boeing were likely to face additional delays in their launch schedules anyway. Launches with crews will probably not lift off before the second half of 2018, three years later than planned, the inspector general said. Changes that SpaceX is making to the design of the capsule, to allow landing in water instead of on land, are causing the latest delays, Mr. Martin said. In addition, NASA has been slow in examining safety reviews submitted by the companies, and as a result, late and costly redesigns might be needed, Mr. Martin said. SpaceX lists about 40 launches of satellites and other cargo on its manifest for commercial companies, NASA and the Air Force. Space industry experts say that Mr. Musk faces risks in balancing SpaceX\u2019s backlog of contracts  \u2014   spanning the next few years  \u2014   without cutting corners to stay on the company\u2019s busy schedule. \u201cWhenever you have a failure along these lines, you of course face delays, which inevitably sets back some of your commercial and government satellite contracts,\u201d said Marco C\u00e1ceres, senior space analyst and director of space studies at The Teal Group, an aerospace research firm. \u201cThey have to fight the temptation to keep to a schedule, even if that means setting back their launches into next year. \u201d SpaceX had hoped for 18 rocket launches this year so far, eight have occurred. Over all, SpaceX has had 27 successful launches of Falcon 9 rockets. An episode like Thursday\u2019s is rare. Jonathan McDowell of the   Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass. who tracks rocket history, said the last time such an explosion happened on a Cape Canaveral launchpad, before the ignition of engines for liftoff, was in 1959. SpaceX is rebuilding a separate launchpad, one of the two formerly used for NASA\u2019s space shuttle missions, for the astronaut launches. That launchpad is scheduled to be ready by the end of the year. Business analysts were mixed on the effects of the explosion on Mr. Musk\u2019s other investments at a time when he is under considerable financial pressure with the planned merger of Tesla and SolarCity. Mr. Musk draws vocal admirers and detractors, some of whom are \u201cshort\u201d investors betting that Tesla cannot execute on its business plan. Trip Chowdry, a senior analyst at Global Equities Research who studies Tesla\u2019s performance, described Mr. Musk\u2019s situation as a \u201c  sword. \u201d \u201cWhen things work out well, people believe Musk to be a superstar,\u201d Mr. Chowdry said. But when things go wrong like an explosion at a separate company, Tesla investors tend to make more general inferences, too. \u201cWhen all is said and done, does it have any impact on Tesla stock? No,\u201d he said. \u201cBut events at SpaceX do create headline risk for Tesla stockholders. \u201d The demise of the satellite, called   puts a significant damper on Facebook\u2019s Internet. org initiative, a grand plan spearheaded by Mr. Zuckerberg to provide wireless connectivity to nations across the world that do not otherwise have easy internet access. In a partnership with Eutelsat, a French satellite provider, Facebook planned to use   to offer internet coverage to large parts of   Africa. Along with satellite coverage, Facebook is teaming with local internet providers to offer access, and is also building its own drones  \u2014   the first of which is named Aquila  \u2014   to beam internet connectivity down to cities. Its Internet. org initiative had already sustained a setback when the company\u2019s aggressive overtures were rejected by local regulators in India earlier this year. On Thursday, Mr. Zuckerberg struck an upbeat tone in his post about the rocket failure, noting that the company has other strategies in the works to expand internet connectivity across the world. Aquila, the   drone, he noted, recently undertook its first successful flight in the desert. Still, the setback will delay Facebook\u2019s ambitious plans and even more ambitious timetable. Shortly after his SpaceX comments, Mr. Zuckerberg struck a cheerier note by posting some \u201cgood news\u201d from the region: A family of baby giraffes was seen on his safari.'"}, "time": 1742562470.9404988}
