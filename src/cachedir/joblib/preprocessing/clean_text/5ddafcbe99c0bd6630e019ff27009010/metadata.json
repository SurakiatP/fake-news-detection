Blessed is your name, and exalted is your majesty. There is no God but you.\u201d \\nIt had been given to the girl during a lesson in \u201cethics\u201d at the Bavarian school. \\nHeadteacher Gisela Herl did not confirm the incident when questioned, but said the school would issue a written statement detailing its position in the coming week. \\nThe incident comes just weeks after parents complained to German newspaper Hessian Nieders\u00e4chsische Allgemeine (HNA) that their children\u2019s nursery was refusing to acknowledge \u201cChristmas rituals\u201d to accommodate the \u201cdiverse cultures\u201d of other pupils. The Sara Nussbaum House daycare centre in Kassel refused to put up a Christmas tree, tell Christmas stories or celebrate Christmas in general because it said only a minority of pupils were Christian. \\nA spokesman for Kassel explained: \u201cThere will be no Christmas celebrations, in the strictest sense. Because the majority of children at this kindergarten are not Christian the festival will not be celebrated in the way that it is at other schools.\u201d \\nMigrants now outnumber native children at many schools in Germany as the country has been inundated with migrants in recent years. More than one million migrants are estimated to have arrived in Germany during the last year alone. \\nThe Federal Office for Migration and Refugees estimates that another 200,000 people will apply for asylum in 2017. \\nDCG'"}, "time": 1742628554.4869628}
