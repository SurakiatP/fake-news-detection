But it was not a runaway. The lyrical \u201cMoonlight,\u201d about a young black man growing up in a poor Miami neighborhood, drew six nominations, including best drama, director and screenplay. \u201cManchester by the Sea,\u201d focused on a New England plumber coping with horrific loss, was also nominated for best drama, receiving five nods total. [See the complete list of Golden Globe nominees] Joining those two films in the best drama category were \u201cLion,\u201d an adoption   set in India and the Weinstein Company\u2019s lead Oscar hope Mel Gibson\u2019s \u201cHacksaw Ridge,\u201d based on the true story of the World War II hero Desmond T. Doss and the CBS Films   \u201cHell or High Water. \u201d Nominated alongside the Ryan Gosling and Emma   \u201cLa La Land\u201d for best comedy or musical: the raunchy superhero blockbuster \u201cDeadpool\u201d the   musical \u201cSing Street\u201d the Meryl Streep vehicle \u201cFlorence Foster Jenkins\u201d and \u201c20th Century Women,\u201d a comedic period drama starring Annette Bening and set for release on Christmas Day. \u201cAs we speak, the entire \u2018Deadpool\u2019 team is engaged in a grotesque, early morning \u201d Ryan Reynolds, the star of that film, wrote on Twitter. The Globes are bestowed by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, a group of mostly freelance journalists, only 85 of whom are active members. Long competitive with the more highbrow Oscars, the Globes often strive to make   choices. Nominating Mr. Gibson for best director fit that bill. Mr. Gibson became a Hollywood pariah in 2006 when he was charged with drunken driving and went on an     tirade. In 2011, he pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge of battering a former girlfriend. By putting his comeback film forward in three prominent categories  \u2014   Andrew Garfield was also nominated for best actor in a drama  \u2014   the Globes may force Oscar voters to similarly contend with Mr. Gibson. \u201cI\u2019m very appreciative,\u201d Mr. Gibson said in a statement. \u201cThis film was a labor of love for everyone involved and is also about a man who truly exemplified love and goodness. \u201d The press association filled out the directing category with Damien Chazelle (\u201cLa La Land\u201d) Barry Jenkins (\u201cMoonlight\u201d) Kenneth Lonergan (\u201cManchester by the Sea\u201d) and Tom Ford (\u201cNocturnal Animals\u201d). The inclusion of Mr. Ford may prove controversial because of Tom   swag sent to voters by Focus Features, the studio behind his film. Because the combined value of the gift  \u2014   bottles of cologne and perfume  \u2014   exceeded the press organization\u2019s $95 limit, the organization asked members to return part of it. To include him, Globe voters overlooked contenders like Martin Scorsese, whose \u201cSilence\u201d arrives in limited release on Dec. 23. Mr. Scorsese may have diminished his prospects by delivering the film late. \u201cSilence,\u201d an epic drama about two priests who face violence in   Japan, was shut out on Monday. It was a bad morning for other Hollywood elder statesmen, with Clint Eastwood\u2019s \u201cSully\u201d uninvited to the banquet and Warren Beatty\u2019s \u201cRules Don\u2019t Apply\u201d barely alive, receiving a lone nod for Lily Collins\u2019s performance. Also ignored was Nate Parker\u2019s \u201cThe Birth of a Nation,\u201d a slave rebellion film once seen as a leading awards contender that collapsed at the box office after scrutiny of Mr. Parker\u2019s past he was accused of rape in 1999 and later acquitted. The diversity on display during Hollywood\u2019s   season  \u2014   or the lack thereof  \u2014   has been an incendiary topic in recent years. When Oscar voters put forward an   group of acting nominees at the most recent Academy Awards, there was a global outcry. The Globes are not necessarily predictive of the Oscars, but Monday\u2019s nominations give reason to believe that a wide variety of faces will be honored. In the acting categories, Globe voters noted performers like Viola Davis and Denzel Washington, both nominated for \u201cFences,\u201d an adaptation of August Wilson\u2019s play about race and family relations. Naomie Harris and Mahershala Ali received attention for their roles in \u201cMoonlight\u201d Dev Patel was nominated for \u201cLion\u201d and Ruth Negga made the best actress cut for \u201cLoving,\u201d a gentle portrait of a   couple whose marriage ended   laws. \u201cHidden Figures,\u201d about unsung black heroines in the space race of the 1960s, received attention for Octavia Spencer\u2019s acting and a score by Pharrell Williams, Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch. But the Globes are not especially prognostic of what will happen on Oscar night. Last year, \u201cThe Revenant\u201d and \u201cThe Martian\u201d were the Globes\u2019 best picture winners both lost to \u201cSpotlight\u201d at the Oscars. The Globes ceremony has been increasingly important on the television front, largely for its acknowledgment of fledgling series like \u201cBrooklyn  . \u201d This time around, \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d a new NBC drama, may have filled that quota. \u201cThis Is Us\u201d received nominations for best drama and for two actresses (Chrissy Metz and Mandy Moore). In the best drama category, rookie shows made a   of the nominations, with \u201cThe Crown,\u201d \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cWestworld\u201d filling out the category, along with the HBO stalwart \u201cGame of Thrones. \u201d Several returning shows were snubbed. \u201cMr. Robot,\u201d last year\u2019s drama winner, received only acting nominations Fox\u2019s \u201cEmpire\u201d got nothing. Showtime, which has had three wins in the best drama category in the past five years, fell to just one nomination: Liev Schreiber for best actor in a drama in \u201cRay Donovan. \u201d Streaming services have made inroads at the Globes, but on Monday the traditional players were back on top. HBO led the pack with 14 nominations (up from seven last year) and FX was in second place with nine. FX was propelled by \u201cThe People vs. O. J. Simpson,\u201d which led all shows with five nominations, including best limited series. In the best comedy category, the returning winner, Amazon\u2019s \u201cMozart in the Jungle,\u201d is up against Amazon\u2019s \u201cTransparent,\u201d HBO\u2019s \u201cVeep\u201d and two shows that feature primarily black casts: ABC\u2019s \u201c \u201d and FX\u2019s rookie hit \u201cAtlanta. \u201d The press association has labored in recent years to shed its reputation for bizarre nominations that were interpreted more as efforts to populate the banquet with stars than honor the year\u2019s best in film and television. Monday\u2019s list contained no outright embarrassments, but there were still some   including a nod for Jonah Hill as best comedic actor in the critical dud \u201cWar Dogs. \u201d As previously announced, Ms. Streep, a   Globes nominee and   winner, will receive the Cecil B. DeMille lifetime achievement award. Foreign film nominees were \u201cDivines\u201d (France) \u201cElle\u201d (France) \u201cNeruda\u201d (Chile) \u201cThe Salesman\u201d (Iran and France) and \u201cToni Erdmann\u201d (Germany). Among film companies, Lionsgate was the runaway winner, with its various labels and partnerships resulting in 17 nominations. A24 was second, with nine, while Paramount and Universal each had eight. Jimmy Fallon is to host the 74th Golden Globes in all of his goofy glory, taking the reins from the acerbic British comedian Ricky Gervais. Mr. Fallon is under pressure to lift ratings. The most recent Globes telecast attracted about 18. 5 million viewers, compared with 19. 3 million the previous year, according to Nielsen. The Globes are to be broadcast live by NBC on Jan. 8.'"}, "time": 1742562636.7321634}
