Details of Mr. Castro\u2019s death on Friday night, at the age of 90, have yet to be made public. But as if performing a play that had been rehearsed for a decade, the government continued to roll out plans for what official statements have called a   period of \u201cDuelo Nacional,\u201d or national mourning. Government employees have begun setting up speakers and yellow   gates at the Plaza de la Revoluci\u00f3n, where the memorial will begin on Monday. Granma, the main government newspaper, published a special edition on Mr. Castro\u2019s life and achievements. Statements and articles in government news outlets have also been lionizing Mr. Castro\u2019s life and achievements  \u2014   \u201cAll of Cuba With Fidel,\u201d said one headline  \u2014   while warning that liquor sales would be limited nationwide until next Sunday, when the mourning period is scheduled to end at noon. \u201cPublic activities and events will be suspended, and national flags will fly at   in public buildings and military installations,\u201d Granma reported. \u201cRadio and television will continue with programming that is informative, patriotic and historical. \u201d All across Havana on Saturday night and Sunday morning, Cubans seemed quieter, more cautious, less certain of what the future might hold. Several nightclubs stayed closed on Saturday night. Traffic lessened, and the usual weekend music and revelry seemed dialed back. Many predicted that the somber mood  \u2014   both sincere and enforced by the state  \u2014   would hold until Mr. Castro\u2019s ashes were interred in Santiago de Cuba next Sunday after a procession along the country\u2019s central highway. Elian Gonzalez, the center of an international custody battle waged by Fidel Castro nearly two decades ago, returned to the public eye on Sunday to praise the leader who fought to return him to Cuba. Echoing the    adulation on state media, Mr. Gonzalez said on   television that the Cuban leader\u2019s legacy will long outlive him. It\u2019s \u201cnot right to talk about Fidel in the past tense . .. but rather that Fidel will be,\u201d Mr. Gonzalez said. \u201cToday more than ever, make him omnipresent. \u201d At one of Havana\u2019s most popular   hot spots  \u2014   behind the imposing Capitolio building, which is being restored to hold the country\u2019s national legislature  \u2014   the crowds were smaller than usual after dark on Saturday. Several young Cubans could be seen scrolling through Facebook and pointing out what relatives and friends around the world were sharing about Mr. Castro\u2019s death. Only a handful were talking to those relatives by video chat, which is usually the most popular activity in the hot spots spread across Havana. Tourists in the group said they were surprised but pleased to have been on the island during such a historic moment. \u201cI\u2019m definitely going tomorrow to see everyone saying goodbye to Fidel,\u201d said Miguel Castillo, 52, a visitor from Costa Rica. \u201cHe was a symbol of resistance. The people of Latin America had long been listening to his voice, to his call for autonomy. \u201d Marini Danilo, 30, a tourist from Italy, said he couldn\u2019t believe his vacation had turned into a chance \u201cto live in such a big story. \u201d \u201cFor me, he was just another dictator,\u201d Mr. Danilo said. \u201cHe was not my dictator, he was Cuba\u2019s, but it feels crazy to be here. \u201d At least on Sunday, the scale of the goodbye for Mr. Castro was hard to gauge. Cubans have long known that when the world is watching, so are the state authorities: During international conferences, during President Obama\u2019s visit in March and, now, after Mr. Castro\u2019s death, the presence of state security becomes more intense, both in the streets and behind the scenes. Even without such clear warnings, Cubans  \u2014   after decades of living under Mr. Castro and his brother Ra\u00fal  \u2014   know that in such moments they are expected to behave and to say very little, especially to visiting reporters. So far, grief and memorialization have been dominated by the state. There have been only occasional public expressions or gatherings of any kind: a few students from a young Communist group getting together to grieve publicly on Saturday a small group of Cubans waving flags on the Malec\u00f3n, the city\u2019s seaside boulevard. At the Plaza de la Revoluci\u00f3n on Saturday night, the wide expanse of concrete was empty except for the police, some soldiers  \u2014   and exactly four visitors snapping photos. But starting on Monday, Cubans expect to see thousands of others, for the final spectacle of the Fidel Castro era.'"}, "time": 1742628593.5143187}
