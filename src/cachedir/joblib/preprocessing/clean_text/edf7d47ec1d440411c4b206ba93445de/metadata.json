Perhaps most importantly are cellular growth and regeneration. A recent article from the New York Times fingered folic acid as one of the most, \u201cluscious micronutrients\u201d available and multiple studies suggest a lack of folic acid may lead to mental conditions such as depression. Folic acid allows the body to perform many essential functions including nucleotide biosynthesis in cells, DNA synthesis and repair, red blood cell creation, and prevention of anemia. Folic acid, also known as vitamin B9, is well known for its application in the prevention of fetal deformities, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and several types of cancer. Fortunately, there are many foods that are naturally rich sources of folic acid. Folic Acid vs. Folate While folic acid and folate are often marketed as one and the same, their metabolic effects can be quite different. Folate is the bioavailable, natural form of vitamin B9 found in a variety of plant and animal foods. Folic acid, while readily utilized by the body, is the synthetic form of the vitamin, often found in supplements and fortified foods. The body is more adept at using folate and will regulate healthy levels by releasing excess through the urine. Foods with Folate (AKA Folic Acid Although Slightly Different) 1. Dark Leafy Greens It should come as no surprise that one of the planet\u2019s healthiest foods is also one of the highest in folate. For an immediate boost in folic acid, consider adding more spinach, collard greens, kale, turnip greens and romaine lettuce into your daily diet. Just one large plate of these delicious leafy greens can provide you with almost all of your daily needs for folate. Spinach \u2014 1 cup = 263 mcg of folate (65% DV) Collard Greens \u2014 1 cup = 177 mcg of folate (44% DV) Turnip Greens \u2014 1 cup = 170 mcg of folate (42% DV) Mustard Greens \u2014 1 cup = 103 mcg of folate (26% DV) Romaine Lettuce \u2014 1 cup = 76 mcg of folate (19% DV) 2. Asparagus This woody treat is perhaps one of the most nutrient dense foods with folic acid out of the entire vegetable kingdom. Eating just one cup of boiled asparagus will give you 262 mcg of folic acid, which accounts for approximately 65% of your daily needs. Not only is asparagus a delicious snack, but it\u2019s also full of nutrients your body craves, including Vitamin K, Vitamin C, Vitamin A, and Manganese. 3. Broccoli Not only is broccoli one of the best detox foods you can eat, it\u2019s also a great source for folic acid. Just one cup of broccoli will provide you with approximately 24% of your daily folic acid needs, not to mention a whole host of other important nutrients. We recommend eating organic broccoli raw or lightly steamed. 4. Citrus Fruits Many fruits contain folic acid, but citrus fruits rank the highest. Oranges are an especially rich source of folic acid. One orange holds about 50 mcg, and a large glass of juice may contain even more. Other folate-rich fruits include papaya, grapefruit, grapes, banana, cantaloupe and strawberries. Here is a short list of fruits high in folic acid. Papaya \u2014 One papaya = 115 mcg of folate (29% DV) Oranges \u2014 One orange = 40 mcg of folate (10% DV) Grapefruit \u2014 One grapefruit = 30 mcg of folate (8% DV) Strawberries \u2014 1 cup = 25 mcg of folate (6.5% DV) Raspberries \u2014 1 cup = 14 mcg of folate (4% DV) 5. Beans, Peas and Lentils Beans and peas especially high in folic acid include pinto beans, lima beans, green peas, black-eyed peas and kidney beans. A small bowl of any type of lentils will give you the majority of your recommended daily amounts of folate. Here is a short list of which beans have the most folic acid.

Seeds and Nuts It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s pumpkin, sesame, sunflower or flax seeds , eating them raw, sprouted, or sprinkled onto a salad will add a healthy serving of folic acid. Sunflower seeds, flax seeds and peanuts are especially high in folate, with one cup offering up to 300 mcg.
