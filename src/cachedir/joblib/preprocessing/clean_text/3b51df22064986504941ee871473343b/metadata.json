[The liberal bubble has only grown worse as the news business has transition from print media to online publications. As Shafer and Doherty report, \u201cToday, 73 percent of all internet publishing jobs are concentrated in either the      corridor or the West Coast crescent that runs from Seattle to San Diego and on to Phoenix. \u201d  From Politico Magazine: As the votes streamed in on election night, evidence that the country had further cleaved into two Americas became palpable. With few exceptions, Clinton ran the table in urban America, while Trump ran it in the ruralities. And as you might suspect, Clinton dominated where internet publishing jobs abound. Nearly 90 percent of all internet publishing employees work in a county where Clinton won, and 75 percent of them work in a county that she won by more than 30 percentage points. When you add in the shrinking number of newspaper jobs, 72 percent of all internet publishing or newspaper employees work in a county that Clinton won. By this measure, of course, Clinton was the national media\u2019s candidate. Resist \u2014  if you can \u2014  the conservative reflex to absorb this data and conclude that the media deliberately twists the news in favor of Democrats. Instead, take it the way a social scientist would take it: The people who report, edit, produce and publish news can\u2019t help being affected \u2014  deeply affected \u2014  by the environment around them. Former New York Times public editor Daniel Okrent got at this when he analyzed the decidedly liberal bent of his newspaper\u2019s staff in a 2004 column that rewards rereading today. The \u201cheart, mind, and habits\u201d of the Times, he wrote, cannot be divorced from the ethos of the cosmopolitan city where it is produced. On such subjects as abortion, gay rights, gun control and environmental regulation, the Times\u2019 news reporting is a pretty good reflection of its region\u2019s dominant predisposition. And yes, a   ethos flourishes in all of internet publishing\u2019s major cities \u2014  Los Angeles, New York, Boston, Seattle, San Francisco and Washington. The Times thinks of itself as a centrist national newspaper, but it\u2019s more accurate to say its politics are perfectly centered on the slices of America that look and think the most like Manhattan. Something akin to the Times ethos thrives in most major national newsrooms found on the Clinton coasts \u2014  CNN, CBS, the Washington Post, BuzzFeed, Politico and the rest. Their reporters, an admirable lot, can parachute into Appalachia or the rural Midwest on a monthly basis and still not shake their provincial sensibilities: Reporters tote their bubbles with them. In a sense, the media bubble reflects an established truth about America: The places with money get served better than the places without. People in big media cities aren\u2019t just more liberal, they\u2019re also richer: Half of all newspaper and internet publishing employees work in counties where the median household income is greater than $61, 000 \u2014  $7, 000 more than the national median. Commercial media tend to cluster where most of the GDP is created, and that\u2019s the coasts. Perhaps this is what Bannon is hollering about when he denounces the \u201ccorporatist, global media,\u201d as he did in February at the Conservative Political Action Conference. If current trends continue \u2014  and it\u2019s safe to predict they will \u2014  national media will continue to expand and concentrate on the coasts, while local and regional media contract.
