Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/putin-begins-banning-clinton-cabal-from.html Vladimir Putin has begun banning members of the corrupt Clinton cabal from Russia, just days after Vladimir Putin told President-elect Donald Trump he hopes the two nations can rebuild their relationship.Michael McFaul, a close Clinton ally and former US ambassador to Moscow under President Barack Obama, is the first of many to be banned from entering Russia, according to Russian Foreign Ministry sources .Mr McFaul, US ambassador in Moscow from 2012-2014, said he had learnt of the ban when applying for a visa to Russia last week. Asked what the purpose of his visit was, McFaul said it was to help presidential candidate Hillary Clinton prepare for what he assumed would be her transition to the White House.Now McFaul, currently a Stanford University professor, is banned from Russia and Kremlin sources say he is the first of many Clinton allies to be banned.Mr McFaul said: \u201cI have hundreds of friends in Russia. I\u2019m really sorry that these sanctions will make communicating with people harder. \u201cI was told that I am on the Kremlin\u2019s sanctions list because of my close affiliation with Obama.\u201d The Russian Foreign Ministry did not publicly confirm the ban, but ministry sources told Russian news agencies McFaul had been added to the sanctions list.He was not banned because of his support for President Obama, a Foreign Ministry source told the TASS and RIA news agencies, but because of his \u201cactive participation in the destruction of the bilateral relationship and relentless lobbying in favour of the Clinton campaign to destabilize Russia.\u201dPresident Putin was one of the first world leaders to congratulate Donald Trump following his election victory, telling the tycoon that he had followed the election closely.Russia is hoping for a \u201cnew understanding\u201d and \u201crestored Russian-American relations\u201d according to Kremlin sources, with President Putin said to be \u201cencouraged\u201d by the American people voting to back themselves and reject the prospect of a New World Order totalitarian world government.According to sources, Putin believes that the result of the U.S. election proves the globalists\u2019 destructive agenda is deeply unpopular with real people, and when given a chance they will instinctively reject it out of hand. \u201cThe American people stood up against the media, the banks, the establishment, everything was against them, but they said enough. They want change.\u201d By Baxter Dmitry Dear Friends, HumansAreFree is and will always be free to access and use.
