The antidoping officials and athletes were expected to pressure Olympic leaders on the matter as soon as Monday  \u2014   less than three weeks before the opening ceremony in Rio. They were waiting for the results of an investigation into claims published in The Times of a   doping program conducted by Russian officials at the 2014 Sochi Olympics. Grigory Rodchenkov, Russia\u2019s former antidoping lab director, told The Times in May that he followed government orders to cover up the widespread use of   drugs by dozens of Russian Olympians at the Sochi Games. At least 15 of them won medals, he said. Russian officials have dismissed allegations of a   doping program as a Western conspiracy intended to smear Russia. The country\u2019s track and field team has already been barred from the Rio Games for doping violations calls for sanctions against Russian athletes in every sport would be unprecedented and would likely escalate the geopolitical debate. At least 10 national antidoping organizations  \u2014   including those in the United States, Germany, Spain, Japan, Switzerland and Canada  \u2014   and more than 20 athlete groups representing Olympians from around the world have banded together as they anticipate validation of Dr. Rodchenkov\u2019s claims. The chief executive of the Institute of National   Organizations, a trade group to which dozens of nations\u2019 antidoping agencies belong, urged all members to sign on to the request on Friday, according to an email reviewed by The Times. \u201cIt seems very likely that the Report will confirm what will be one of the biggest doping scandals in history, implicating the Russian Government in a massive conspiracy against the clean athletes of the world,\u201d wrote Joseph de Pencier, the chief executive of the national antidoping trade association. \u201cThis will be a \u2018watershed moment\u2019 for clean sport. \u201d In an interview on Saturday, Travis Tygart, head of the United States   Agency, said: \u201cWe\u2019re not asking for the worst, and obviously we hope there\u2019s no doping going on by states. But if we\u2019re not preparing for all potential outcomes, then we\u2019re not fulfilling our promise to clean athletes. \u201d Reuters first reported on Saturday that United States and Canadian antidoping officials were planning to call for a wider ban of Russian athletes at the Rio Games. Mr. Tygart and other antidoping officials said they had not seen the report, which was commissioned by the World   Agency and prepared by a Canadian lawyer, Richard McLaren. It is expected to be released on Monday morning in Toronto. Mr. McLaren has indicated that his inquiry will prove true what Dr. Rodchenkov told The Times last spring. Last month, Mr. McLaren delivered a preliminary report to global track and field officials as they were scrutinizing Russia he called Dr. Rodchenkov\u2019s detailed account of swapping out   urine at Sochi with the help of Russia\u2019s intelligence service \u201ccredible and verifiable,\u201d adding that he had evidence to confirm that \u201cthe ministry of sport was involved in instructing the laboratory to not report positive sample results. \u201d After that report, track and field\u2019s governing body barred Russian athletes from the Games, leaving a \u201cnarrow crack in the door\u201d for Russian athletes who had been subjected to rigorous   outside Russia to petition to compete in Rio, but under a neutral flag. So far, two Russian athletes have been given dispensation. One of them, Yuliya Stepanova, fled Russia in 2014 after alleging widespread doping. President Vladimir V. Putin has called her a \u201cJudas\u201d for betraying the country. \u201cIf McLaren produces clear, convincing, irrefutable evidence that there has been systemic   doping in Russian sport,\u201d said Paul Melia, Canada\u2019s top antidoping official, \u201cthe appropriate sanction would be for the I. O. C. to ban the Russian Olympic Committee from taking a team to Rio. \u201d Anticipating confirmation of Dr. Rodchenkov\u2019s account, the group of dozens of antidoping officials are considering addressing Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee, and the organization\u2019s executive board members. They are preparing to request that the ban applied to Russia\u2019s track and field athletes be applied across sports, with opportunities for athletes to appeal and possibly be given permission to compete under a neutral flag. Since Dr. Rodchenkov outlined an elaborate doping scheme at the Sochi Games, the I. O. C. has repeatedly called for \u201cthe right balance between collective responsibility and individual justice. \u201d It is unclear if Mr. Bach would be persuaded by the antidoping organizations\u2019 request to bar the entire Russian delegation. In May Mr. Bach said he would apply a \u201c \u201d policy and would not rule out bans against Russia across entire sports, like track and field. But last month he defended the Russian Olympic Committee, distancing the organization from the sports ministry. Dr. Rodchenkov, however, said he took direct orders from Russia\u2019s deputy sports minister, Yuri Nagornykh, who is a member of Russia\u2019s Olympic Committee. United States lawmakers from the House of Representatives and Senate have expressed concern about Dr. Rodhchenkov\u2019s allegations. Last month, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation said the scandal called into question the \u201cstrength and credibility\u201d of the antidoping system. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce echoed that this month, urging Mr. Bach to seize \u201ccrucial and timely opportunities\u201d to clean up global sports. \u201cThe failure to do so is simply irresponsible, and we will not remain silent,\u201d the lawmakers wrote. Both the Senate and House committees have United States government jurisdiction over international sports, and the United States has contributed tens of millions of dollars to the World   Agency since the early 2000s. Russia\u2019s sports ministry has admitted to doping problems in recent months but denied government involvement. In an interview with The Times in Moscow this month, Vitaly Mutko, Russia\u2019s sports minister, diminished the power of Mr. McLaren\u2019s commission and WADA, which have the ability to make recommendations such as the ones the antidoping officials and athletes are prepared to do. The I. O. C. and sports federations have ultimate authority over who competes at the Games. \u201cRecommendations?\u201d Mr. Mutko said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the decisions. With respect to the commission, they do not determine the fate of world sport. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563234.5580602}
