Carville voiced his anger on MSNBC this Monday at the way FBI Director James Comey has reignited the investigation into candidate Clinton\u2019s emails. \\n\u201cAmerican democracy is really under attack here,\u201d he said, pointing the finger at Comey and House Republicans. \\n\u201cWe do know our that democracy is under assault, \u201d adding, \u201cPeople have to decide, do we want our country for ourselves and the people in charge or do we want the KGB and the House Republicans to decide this election?\u201d \\nAnchor Thomas Roberts brought up the praising of Comey by Democrats back in July, but Comey stood firm in his stance, strongly urging Roberts, \u201cWhy are you defending this?\u201d \\nHe continued, \u201cWhy are you sitting here when our democracy is under assault, when the FBI is acting at the behest of Jason Chaffetz, and sitting here acting like this is legit, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s an effort to effect this election. Democrats and people across this country have to know that,\u201d he noted resoundingly. \\n\u201cWhen the facts change you change your mind,\u201d he continued, regarding the change in the FBI from July to now. \\n\u201cYou\u2019re defending an assault on the American Democracy,\u201d Carville fumed, adding that this is, \u201c An unprecedented event.\u201d Carville again cautioned that our government is at risk at the hands of Comey, the GOP. \\nAs Carville so passionately advocated, we will not let the election and our democracy be squandered at the hands of these perpetrators. \\nWatch it here:'"}, "time": 1742563481.1756346}
