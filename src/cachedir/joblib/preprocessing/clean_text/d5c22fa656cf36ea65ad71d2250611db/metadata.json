Garland, President Obama\u2019s pick for the Supreme Court? After a comprehensive look at every past Supreme Court vacancy, two law professors have concluded that it is an unprecedented development. Senate Republicans say they will not consider any nominee offered by Mr. Obama to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February. The power to appoint Justice Scalia\u2019s successor, they say, should belong to the next president. That categorical stance is new in the nation\u2019s history, the professors, Robin Bradley Kar and Jason Mazzone, wrote in a study published online by The New York University Law Review. The Senate has never before transferred a president\u2019s appointment power in comparable circumstances to an unknown successor, they said  \u2014   an argument that many Democratic lawmakers have also made. In every one of the 103 earlier Supreme Court vacancies, the professors wrote, the president was able to both nominate and appoint a replacement with the Senate\u2019s advice and consent. This did not always happen on the first try, they wrote, but it always happened. \u201cThere really is something unique about the position Republican senators are taking with respect to the Scalia vacancy,\u201d said Professor Mazzone, who teaches at the University of Illinois. \u201cYou really cannot find any single comparable case,\u201d he said. \u201cWe really did not find any precedent for the idea, notwithstanding the Senate\u2019s very broad powers in this area, that a sitting president could be denied outright the authority to offer up a nominee who would receive evaluation through normal Senate processes. \u201d The study was the subject of a thorough critique by Edward Whelan, a prominent conservative legal blogger, who said Professors Kar and Mazzone had to perform semantic gymnastics to discern a consistent historical practice. The study considered only nominations to the Supreme Court, though the Senate must also confirm other federal judges and senior executive branch officials. \u201cIt is nonsensical to read into the Constitution one rule governing Supreme Court justices and another rule for everyone else,\u201d Mr. Whelan wrote in a series of posts on National Review\u2019s Bench Memos blog. The professors also excluded nominations from three presidents who gained office by succession rather than election, saying that the constitutional status of unelected presidents was contested until the adoption of the 25th Amendment in 1967. In addition, they excluded three presidents who started the nomination process after their successors had already been elected. You can make a decent case for both exceptions. It is harder to ignore President Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s failure in 1968, an election year, to fill Chief Justice Earl Warren\u2019s seat. Johnson ultimately withdrew his nomination of Justice Abe Fortas. The study\u2019s authors \u201cgerrymander their way around this inconvenience,\u201d Mr. Whelan wrote, by saying that there was no actual vacancy to fill because Warren had merely declared in a letter to Johnson that he was prepared to step down \u201ceffective at your pleasure. \u201d The Fortas affair helps both sides in the debate. Some senators opposed his nomination on the grounds that the next president should make the appointment. But the Senate Judiciary Committee held confirmation hearings and sent the nomination to the Senate floor. The nomination failed, but mostly on the basis of an individualized assessment of Fortas\u2019s qualifications to be chief justice. \u201cThere is a difference,\u201d Professor Mazzone said, \u201cbetween the Senate rejecting, as it\u2019s quite entitled to do, a particular nominee on the merits, and the Senate taking the position that a president cannot exercise a constitutionally delegated power. \u201d Should it matter if the Senate has always given presidents a real shot at appointing a Supreme Court justice? At a minimum, the authors say, the historical precedents establish \u201ca benchmark of fair dealing. \u201d More controversially, they say that historical practices \u201ccan ripen into constitutional rules. \u201d That is not obviously true, but the Supreme Court seemed to say something similar in 2014, in a case on recess appointments. But even if the constitutional argument is a stretch, tradition counts for something. \u201cHistory draws a distinction between rejecting a candidate and rejecting a presidential power,\u201d said Professor Kar, who also teaches at the University of Illinois. \u201cIt\u2019s a norm of fair dealing in the Senate. Procedure matters, and this breach is a dangerous one. \u201d Mr. Whelan wrote that the study supplied an answer to the wrong question. The right one, he said, is \u201chow to deal with (a) a nomination by an   president, (b) in an election year, (c) that threatens to dramatically alter the ideological composition of the court. \u201d That is a good description of current political realities. Professors Kar and Mazzone say they instead tried to discern a neutral principle from centuries of unbroken practice. I asked Professor Mazzone what he would tell a Republican senator to do in considering Judge Garland\u2019s nomination. \u201cYou do what the Senate has always done in comparable circumstances,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich is you proceed with a   evaluation of the candidate on the merits. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628593.4669461}
