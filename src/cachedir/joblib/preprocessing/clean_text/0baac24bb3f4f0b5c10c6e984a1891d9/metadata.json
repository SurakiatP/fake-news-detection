S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). [The   program, set to launch this summer, will test online ordering and payment methods.  The USDA, which oversees the $74 billion food stamp program, also known as SNAP or the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, says it plans to expand the online program nationwide and eventually add more retailers. Participating retailers include Safeway, ShopRite,   Hart\u2019s Local Grocers, and Dash\u2019s Market, and will serve  food stamps recipients in seven states: Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Washington, Iowa, and Oregon. However, Amazon is by far the largest online food distributor participating in the federal government\u2019s new program. \u201cAmazon is excited to participate in the USDA SNAP online purchasing pilot,\u201d the Seattle,   company said in a press release. \u201cWe are committed to making food accessible through online grocery shopping, offering all customers the lowest prices possible. \u201d For years, government watchdog groups have demanded tighter regulations as food stamp fraud remains a common and costly problem. The USDA, seemingly aware of the risks for fraud, says \u201conline payment presents technical and security challenges that will need to be examined and fully addressed before it is offered nationwide. \u201d News of the USDA\u2019s pilot program comes as a new report reveals Americans used food stamps to buy more than $600 million worth of \u201csweetened beverages,\u201d and bought hundreds of millions more of junk food and sugary snacks. Overall, $1. 3 billion in food stamps were spent on \u201csweetened drinks, desserts, salty snacks, candy, and sugar,\u201d which accounted for about 20 cents of every dollar spent on food items purchased by 26. 5 million households in 2011, according to a recently released report from the USDA. What\u2019s more, the USDA\u2019s plan to allow tens of millions of food stamps recipients to purchase products from Amazon is the latest example of   profiting from poverty. Big banks like J. P. Morgan have made millions providing electronic benefits transaction (EBT) services for state governments and their respective food stamps programs. \u201cSince 2004, 18 of 24 states who contract with J. P. Morgan to provide welfare benefits have contracted to pay $560, 492, 596. 02,\u201d an investigation by the Government Accountability Institute (GAI) found. Christopher Paton, the company\u2019s former managing director of treasury services, told Bloomberg News in 2011: This business is a very important business to JP Morgan. It\u2019s an important business in terms of its size and scale. We also regard it as very important in the sense that we are delivering a very useful social function. We are a key part of this benefit delivery mechanism. Right now volumes have gone through the roof in the past couple of years or so   \u2026     The good news from JP Morgan\u2019s perspective is the infrastructure that we built has been able to cope with that increase in volume. Walmart, which wasn\u2019t selected to participate in the USDA pilot program, hopes to be added to the USDA\u2019s Food and Nutrition Service online purchasing program in the future. \u201cWe look forward to working with FNS as they continue to explore this opportunity,\u201d the company said, CBS reports. \u201cWe\u2019ve expanded our highly popular online grocery service from five markets to more than 100 markets over the past 18 months in both large and small communities across the country. \u201d Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson'"}, "time": 1742628598.456134}
