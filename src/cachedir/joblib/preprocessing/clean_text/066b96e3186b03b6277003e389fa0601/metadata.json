Ms. Stowell has won six times in a row on taped episodes of the quiz show that began broadcasting last week. Ms. Stowell has developed a fan base like few other contestants. But she is unable to enjoy her performance on TV, or the outpouring of love from \u201cJeopardy!\u201d watchers. That\u2019s because she died on Dec. 5, just over a week before her episodes began showing. She was 41. When the science content developer from Austin, Tex. began recording her episodes on Aug. 31, she had Stage 4 colon cancer, a fact known by only a few of the show\u2019s staff members and the host, Alex Trebek. Her competitors were unaware. The show has not announced how long Ms. Stowell\u2019s streak of victories will continue. A \u201cJeopardy!\u201d champion continues playing until unseated by a contestant. On Tuesday, she won again, bringing her total prize money to $103, 803. Her boyfriend, Jason Hess, and her relatives Greg Stowell and Carole Stowell said in a statement, \u201cCindy came on \u2018Jeopardy!\u2019 to play the game she loved, and in doing so, she was able to make a contribution to cancer research in the hopes that no one else would have to go through what she did. \u201d The money will go to the Cancer Research Institute, according to KXAN, a TV station in Austin. \u201cShe knew she wasn\u2019t going to be around, and so she felt like the best thing she could do was try to help do what she could to help get us to a cure faster,\u201d Mr. Hess told the station. After passing an online contestant test early this year, Ms. Stowell was invited to an audition in Oklahoma City. At that point, she reached out to a producer. \u201cDo you have any idea how long it typically takes between an   interview and the taping date? I ask because I just found out that I don\u2019t have too much longer to live,\u201d she wrote, according to the show\u2019s website. \u201cThe doctor\u2019s best guess is about six months,\u201d she continued. \u201cIf there is the chance that I\u2019d be able to still tape episodes of \u2018Jeopardy!\u2019 if I were selected, I\u2019d like to do that and donate any winnings to   \u2026     charities involved in cancer research. If it is unlikely that the turnaround time would be that quick, then I\u2019d like to give up my tryout spot to someone else. \u201d A producer told her to go to Oklahoma City for the interview, and if she qualified she would be booked three weeks later, the fastest turnaround possible. She competed on painkillers while fighting a blood infection, according to Mr. Hess. \u201cCompeting on \u2018Jeopardy!\u2019 was a lifelong dream for Cindy, and we\u2019re glad she was able to do so,\u201d Mr. Trebek said in a statement. In her first performance, she won $22, 801, defeating an editor from Vermilion, Ohio, who had won $107, 499 over seven days. She won $8, 199 in her second episode, and on Thursday she came from behind, adding $8, 600 to her   total. While it\u2019s not unusual for the show to establish back stories for the contestants, the viewers\u2019 knowledge of Ms. Stowell\u2019s condition \u201cis to share a sad secret with her,\u201d Seth Rosenthal wrote at SB Nation. \u201cI sit in awe of a brilliant woman earning every last dollar she can for the causes dearest to her building a sum of infinite potential in the face of her own finality,\u201d he said. \u201cI have never rooted harder for anyone to win anything. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628307.4669843}
