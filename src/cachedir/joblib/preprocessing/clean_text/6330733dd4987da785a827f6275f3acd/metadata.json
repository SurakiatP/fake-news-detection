If this is so, soon you will have most of your teeth. And at two years, you are just about old enough to enjoy Wrigley\u2019s gum. \u201d Ms. Trombley, of Berkley, Mich. dates the letter to 1938, based on her father\u2019s age. She sent a picture of it to her siblings, speculating that \u201cWrigley was trying to track down lots of babies and get them hooked on gum. \u201d According to the Wrigley Company, that\u2019s exactly what William Wrigley Jr. the founder of the business, was trying to do. \u201cWrigley has been credited with being the father of direct marketing,\u201d said Michelle Green, the United States marketing communications manager for Wrigley. \u201cIn the early 1900s, he actually shipped free sticks of gum to every address in the U. S. phone book, and that is thought to be the first national direct marketing campaign. \u201d The letter Ms. Trombley found was part of a campaign to mail free gum to every American child turning 2. Mr. Wrigley also commissioned a Mother Goose booklet starring \u201cSprightly Spearman,\u201d the mascot for Spearmint gum, and sent thousands of the booklets to schools in poor areas, according to the Wrigley website. On Mr. Trombley\u2019s letter, \u201cwe can kind of see the little glue dots where the stick was,\u201d his daughter said. The reference to the sweet, juicy flavor and the use of the Juicy Fruit brand in the illustration in the letterhead suggest that the gum sent with the letter was Juicy Fruit, Wrigley\u2019s oldest product. It was introduced in 1893, a few months before Wrigley\u2019s Spearmint gum, the company\u2019s website says. The letter claims that chewing gum \u201cis good for children\u2019s teeth, which need more exercise than they get with modern soft food. \u201d But there is no evidence for this claim or for any other oral health benefits of chewing the gum that was sold in the 1930s, all of which contained sugar, said Dr. Jade Miller, president of the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry. \u201cBack in the \u201820s and \u201930s, quite honestly, there was really not a whole lot of science about whether gum had any effect on bacteria,\u201d Dr. Miller said. But he hypothesized that perhaps people knew that gum increased saliva flow and thought the extra saliva, combined with the mechanical effect of the gum rubbing across the teeth, might have helped clean the mouth and teeth. Research now shows, though, that chewing gum containing sugar actually increases the risk of cavities. What\u2019s more, the American Academy of Pediatrics now considers gum a choking hazard for children younger than age 5. \u201cWe also know a whole lot about how toddlers\u2019 brains work, and    simply have not yet developed the ability to think through their actions, consider consequences or consistently follow rules,\u201d said Dr. Laura Jana, a pediatrician and author of \u201cThe Toddler Brain: Nurture the Skills Today that Will Shape Your Child\u2019s Tomorrow. \u201d She added: \u201cIf you\u2019re 2 and something tastes good, you swallow it, regardless of whether you\u2019ve been cautioned not to. \u201d Dr. Miller agreed. \u201cWhen a child understands they shouldn\u2019t be swallowing  \u2014   that\u2019s the right time to allow chewing gum,\u201d he said. The letter also suggests that chewing gum might offer relief from teething pain. \u201cIf you still have a few teeth to come through, chewing Wrigley\u2019s gum will help you,\u201d it says. But this advice no longer holds up. Though teething babies have been known to gnaw on anything they can get their gums on, these days the recommended remedies are usually sanctioned teething toys or timeless homemade options like a cool washcloth. (Note that experts say to avoid frozen teething items  \u2014   even frozen washcloths  \u2014   since they can hurt the gums and cause pain.) Dr. Jana suggests a   toothbrush, which your child can chew, suck or rub on his gums to lesson discomfort. Wrigley was far from unique in promoting child care protocols that have since fallen out of favor. \u201cThere are many examples of significant shifts in parenting norms: Toddlers used to sit on parents\u2019 laps in the front seat of cars before car seats were invented children\u2019s hands were strapped to the side of the crib to prevent thumb sucking babies slept on their bellies and a bit of brandy for teething was a thing,\u201d Dr. Jana said. \u201cIn all instances, we now know much better. \u201d Wrigley has since updated the science behind its recommendations. In 2006, the Wrigley Science Institute was founded to support research evaluating the effects of   gum on health. Interestingly, Mr. Trombley grew up to be a dental technician, making crowns and bridges for people\u2019s teeth. Ms. Trombley is not sure what her father might have thought of the Wrigley letter but she said he preferred candy to gum. As for whether or not Mr. Trombley\u2019s mother let him chew that free stick of gum in 1938: \u201cWe don\u2019t have any idea, but we like to think she kept it for herself,\u201d Ms. Trombley said. Does swallowed gum really stay in your stomach for seven years?  No. It\u2019s true that our digestive system is unable to break down the synthetic gum base, but it doesn\u2019t stay in the stomach for long. The gum eventually moves through the small intestine into the colon and is passed in the stool. Dr. Jade Miller notes that there have been rare instances in which gum has caused intestinal blockages in young children. He said the current thinking on the matter is \u201cnot to give gum to a child when they\u2019re too young to understand not to swallow it. \u201d Does chewing gum build up your jaw muscles?  It is conceivable that chewing gum could strengthen the muscles in and around the mouth but it\u2019s not likely to have any effect on your jaw line. \u201cAlmost all of the muscles used for mastication are not externally visible, so it wouldn\u2019t impact your facial contour at all,\u201d said Dr. John Dahl, assistant professor of otolaryngology at Indiana University School of Medicine and a surgeon at Riley Hospital for Children at IU Health. The more likely outcome of chewing a lot of gum is that you would get a sore jaw and exacerbate pain in the temporomandibular joint, or TMJ, the hinge that connects your jaw to the bones of your skull. Are there any health benefits to chewing gum?  Over the years, dental experts have come to the conclusion that chewing   gum after meals increases the flow of saliva, which can help clear sugars and bacteria from the mouth, neutralize plaque acids and strengthen teeth, all of which can help to prevent cavities. Dr. Miller said that increased salivary flow may be particularly helpful for people who have trouble with mouth dryness. \u201cThat can be caused by a lot of medications or medical problems, and increased salivary flow can really be helpful for reducing the risk of cavities,\u201d he said. Can gum help with speech therapy? Yes. Some speech pathologists use gum and other chewy treats to exercise the mouth and improve articulation. As long as children are old enough, chewing gum helps them practice using their jaw, cheek and tongue muscles in new ways while managing saliva flow and breathing  \u2014   skills that are all necessary for speaking. Therapists may also incorporate gum into sessions with children with autism because chewing offers sensory stimulation, which can help the children regulate their nervous systems.'"}, "time": 1742563074.310207}
