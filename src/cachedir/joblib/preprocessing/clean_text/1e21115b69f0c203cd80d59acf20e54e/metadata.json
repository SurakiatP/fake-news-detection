Soccer President Sunil Gulati noted that President Donald Trump is \u201cfully supportive\u201d of the effort. [The comment comes after the soccer federations of the United States, Mexico, and Canada announced a joint bid to host the upcoming World Cup, USA Today reported.  During Monday\u2019s joint press conference, Gulati addressed the question of how the Mexican soccer officials could work with their U. S. counterparts after last year\u2019s contentious election. \u201cWe have the full support of the United States government in this project,\u201d Gulati said during the presser. \u201cThe president of the United States is fully supportive and encouraged us in having this joint bid. He is especially pleased that Mexico is part of this bid, and that\u2019s in the last few days that we have gotten further encouragement on that,\u201d the U. S. soccer chief continued. \u201cWe\u2019re not at all concerned about some of the issues that other people may raise,\u201d Gulati added. \u201cWe looked at bidding alone, and again, decided we wanted to bid with our partners in North America, and we have a strong encouragement from President Trump to that very end. \u201d For his part, Decio de Mar\u00eda, president of the Federaci\u00f3n Mexicana de F\u00fatbol and CONCACAF vice president, agreed that the World Cup is about soccer, not politics. \u201cI believe, like Sunil said, this is not a forum to talk about politics, it\u2019s a forum to talk about soccer,\u201d de Mar\u00eda said. \u201cWhat I am certain of is that both countries will work tirelessly to build many soccer fields, so that the ball keeps rolling and so that our respective communities can enjoy the benefits that soccer creates. \u201d Certainly the issue of immigration featured prominently in Trump\u2019s campaign and subsequent election to the White House. But, the three soccer heads assured the media that the issue would not be part of the World Cup. \u201cThat us three are standing here as presidents of the federations of the countries that took in our families is a very strong statement,\u201d Victor Montagliani, president of the Canadian Soccer Association and president of CONCACAF, said during the conference. \u201cAnd it\u2019s something that I\u2019m very proud of. \u201d Speaking in Spanish, de Mar\u00eda added that, \u201cthe real winners are soccer and the region to have invited the world to enjoy this celebration. I think that\u2019s how you create a beautiful story. \u201d The vote on where the 2026 World Cup will end up occurs in 2020, as President Trump\u2019s current term in office winds down, though the game itself would be held during another president\u2019s term, regardless. According to the plan worked out between the three countries, the U. S. would get 60 of the 80 games and Mexico and Canada would host ten each.
