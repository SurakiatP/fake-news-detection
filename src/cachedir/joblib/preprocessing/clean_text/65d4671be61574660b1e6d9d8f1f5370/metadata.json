Or maybe a Michael Moore who went to finishing school and learned how to charm rather than intimidate the people she talks to. In \u201cMeet the Donors: Does Money Talk? ,\u201d her 10th documentary for HBO (where it makes its premiere on Monday) she\u2019s often in the frame, and her appearances grow more frequent as the hourlong film progresses. A characteristic shot is of Ms. Pelosi conducting an interview while holding a camera herself  \u2014   a selfie by proxy  \u2014   so that we can see her while she playfully hectors her subjects. Those interviewees are mostly rich white men who donate enormous amounts to political, specifically presidential, campaigns. You may think that \u201cDoes Money Talk?\u201d is missing a \u201cDuh!\u201d at the end, and watching the film won\u2019t change your mind, as Ms. Pelosi asks one financier after another why he gives away so much money and hears a series of variations on \u201cbecause it\u2019s the right thing to do. \u201d But investigation isn\u2019t what Ms. Pelosi\u2019s film is really about. As in earlier works like \u201cJourneys With George\u201d and \u201cDiary of a Political Tourist,\u201d she uses her sense of the absurd and her access  \u2014   gained in part through her status as a daughter of the California congresswoman Nancy Pelosi  \u2014   to present the American political system as a mostly lighthearted farce. She\u2019s worried about what\u2019s going on, but her tone is more    than   . More than half the film is taken up with her series of interviews with \u201cmegadonors\u201d to both parties, who disburse the money they\u2019ve made in finance, oil, broadcasting and other industries. Some of them are evidently serious thinkers committed to sincere ideologies, but the film perks up when Ms. Pelosi zeros in on unbridled ego or vanity. Foster Friess, a Republican donor intent on \u201crestoring the   value system that made our country great,\u201d acknowledges his detractors and   compares his tribulations to those of Jesus. The New York grocery mogul John Catsimatidis, an   giver, positively glows as he shows off his wall of photos of presidential candidates visiting his apartment. There is periodic affirmation that giving millions of dollars to politicians gets your phone calls answered, and a few stark admissions that money gets laws made and regulations rewritten. (These tend to involve anecdotes about the Koch brothers, who declined to be interviewed.) But even the biggest fish Ms. Pelosi interviews project a rueful sense of being small cogs in the machine, and in a brief coda she agrees with them, hurriedly making the point that real power lies with lobbyists and industry consortiums, not rich individuals. Ms. Pelosi begins \u201cMeet the Donors\u201d with scenes of Jimmy Stewart as the   senator in \u201cMr. Smith Goes to Washington\u201d and ends it with archival,    film of people voting. She\u2019s invoking a   ad,     era, but it leaves her sounding a little like the megadonors she interviews, who uniformly couch their giving as an attempt to reinforce \u201ctraditional\u201d American values. We could all get along if we could all just live in the past.'"}, "time": 1742564044.1505537}
