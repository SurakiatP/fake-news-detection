Some of it dazzles me, some doesn\u2019t, and I write my reviews accordingly. As time passes, though, it\u2019s the less frenetic stuff that tends to stand out in my memory. The juicy   slab of roast beef, the egg on toast served Mumbai style, the \u00eele flottante that vanished on my tongue leaving behind just a memory of transient happiness  \u2014   these are some of my favorite dishes from new restaurants in New York, listed here in no particular order. EGGS KEJRIWAL AT PAOWALLA It\u2019s a fried egg on toast under melted Cheddar that stands out from all others because of a   green chutney that has a glossy underpinning of coconut oil: 195 Spring Street, SoHo    paowalla. com.   PHEASANT AT LE COUCOU Oh, just beautifully juicy pheasant breast, a little meatball of braised pheasant leg cooked in cabbage, and enough wobbly foie gras to make you forget that the United States recently held an election: 138 Lafayette Street, SoHo    lecoucou. com. HONEY MESQUITE CAKE AT PONDICHERI Flour from almonds and ground mesquite pods, seasoned purposefully with ginger, make this a morning pastry without precedent: 15 West 27th Street, NoMad    pondichericafe.  . FROZEN YOGURT AT OLMSTED A heap of lavender cream whipped to stiff peaks sits on and blends in with the yogurt in this wonderfully uncomplicated duet for dairy products: 659 Vanderbilt Avenue, Prospect Heights, Brooklyn    olmstednyc. com.

It\u2019s dusted with hard grains of caramel that crackle between your teeth as the meringue collapses: 30 East 20th Street, Flatiron district    lecoqriconyc. com. ROAST BEEF AT MR. DONAHUE\u2019S The flavor is less like the sandwich meat of delis and bodegas than it is like a great slab of rib roast served on your favorite holiday: 203 Mott Street, NoLIta    mrdonahues. com. CLASSIC BURGER AT SALVATION BURGER This is the pure stuff of hungry roadside American daydreams, with all the most   qualities singled out and amplified: 230 East 51st Street, Midtown East    salvationburger. com. CACIO E PEPE FRITELLE AT LILIA Reconfiguring the great and elemental Roman pasta dish as a fried bar snack is an even more clever idea than it sounds: 567 Union Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn    lilianewyork. com. BUCATINI WITH SQUID AND MUSSELS AT HIGH STREET ON HUDSON Seaweed in the noodles and orange curls of cured lobster coral on top give this pasta an oceanic pull as strong as a riptide: 637 Hudson Street, West Village    highstreetonhudson. com.'"}, "time": 1742564486.972554}
