Ms. Brewer Lane, at the time a    model, did as Mr. Trump asked. \u201cI went into the bathroom and tried one on,\u201d she recalled. It was a bikini. \u201cI came out, and he said, \u2018Wow.\u2019 \u201d Mr. Trump, then 44 and in the midst of his first divorce, decided to show her off to the crowd at    his estate in Palm Beach, Fla. \u201cHe brought me out to the pool and said, \u2018That is a stunning Trump girl, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 \u201d Ms. Brewer Lane said. Donald Trump and women: The words evoke a familiar cascade of casual insults, hurled from the safe distance of a Twitter account, a radio show or a campaign podium. This is the public treatment of some women by Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president: degrading, impersonal, performed. \u201cThat must be a pretty picture, you dropping to your knees,\u201d he told a female contestant on \u201cThe Celebrity Apprentice. \u201d Rosie O\u2019Donnell, he said, had a \u201cfat, ugly face. \u201d A lawyer who needed to pump milk for a newborn? \u201cDisgusting,\u201d he said. But the 1990 episode at    that Ms. Brewer Lane described was different: a debasing    encounter between Mr. Trump and a young woman he hardly knew. This is the private treatment of some women by Mr. Trump, the   and more intimate encounters. The New York Times interviewed dozens of women who had worked with or for Mr. Trump over the past four decades, in the worlds of real estate, modeling and pageants women who had dated him or interacted with him socially and women and men who had closely observed his conduct since his adolescence. In all, more than 50 interviews were conducted over the course of six weeks. Their accounts  \u2014   many relayed here in their own words  \u2014   reveal unwelcome romantic advances, unending commentary on the female form, a shrewd reliance on ambitious women, and unsettling workplace conduct, according to the interviews, as well as court records and written recollections. The interactions occurred in his offices at Trump Tower, at his homes, at construction sites and backstage at beauty pageants. They appeared to be fleeting, unimportant moments to him, but they left lasting impressions on the women who experienced them. What emerges from the interviews is a complex, at times contradictory portrait of a wealthy,   and provocative man and the women around him, one that defies simple categorization. Some women found him gracious and encouraging. He promoted several to the loftiest heights of his company, a daring move for a major real estate developer at the time. He simultaneously nurtured women\u2019s careers and mocked their physical appearance. \u201cYou like your candy,\u201d he told an overweight female executive who oversaw the construction of his headquarters in Midtown Manhattan. He could be lewd one moment and gentlemanly the next. In an interview, Mr. Trump described himself as a champion of women, someone who took pride in hiring them and was in awe of their work ethic. \u201cIt would just seem,\u201d he said, \u201cthat there was something that they want to really prove. \u201d Pressed on the women\u2019s claims, Mr. Trump disputed many of the details, such as asking Ms. Brewer Lane to put on a swimsuit. \u201cA lot of things get made up over the years,\u201d he said. \u201cI have always treated women with great respect. And women will tell you that. \u201d But in many cases there was an unmistakable dynamic at play: Mr. Trump had the power, and the women did not. He had celebrity. He had wealth. He had connections. Even after he had behaved crudely toward them, some of the women sought his assistance with their careers or remained by his side. For Ms. Brewer Lane, her introduction to Mr. Trump at    was the start of a whirlwind romance  \u2014   a heady blur of helicopter rides and   hotel rooms and flashing cameras. \u201cIt was intimidating,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was Donald Trump, obviously. \u201d It started at the New York Military Academy, a small, severe boarding school 90 minutes\u2019 drive north of New York City. Strictly enforced rules prohibited girls from setting foot on the   campus unless it was a special occasion. And on those special occasions, young Donald Trump paid careful mind to the kind of girls he brought to school. They had to be gorgeous  \u2014   10s, in his future parlance. \u201cDonald was extremely sensitive to whether or not the women he invited to campus were pretty,\u201d recalled George White, a fellow student in the class of 1964. \u201cFor Donald,\u201d he added, \u201cit\u2019s display. \u201d He steadily built an image as a young playboy amid the deprivations of a   military school, where most boys craved but rarely enjoyed the company of a girl. By senior year, his classmates had crowned him \u201cladies\u2019 man\u201d in the yearbook, a nod to the volume of his dates. Asked how he had earned the \u201cladies\u2019 man\u201d title, Mr. Trump at first demurred. \u201cI better not tell you  \u2014   I\u2019ll get myself in trouble,\u201d he said. He later elaborated, saying he had \u201ca great feeling\u201d and \u201ca great like\u201d for women. Mr. Trump grew up with an influential role model for how to deal with women: Fred C. Trump, his powerful and unyielding father. The elder Mr. Trump exerted control no matter how big or small the decision, as Ivana Zelnickova learned over dinner one night in the late 1970s. Her boyfriend, Donald Trump, had invited her to join his siblings and parents at Tavern on the Green, the ornate restaurant in Central Park. When the waiter came to take orders, Ivana made the mistake of asking for what she wanted. Fred Trump set her straight, she recalled in a previously unpublished interview with Michael D\u2019Antonio, the author of \u201cThe Truth About Trump. \u201d Mr. Trump defended his father\u2019s conduct. \u201cHe would\u2019ve said that out of love,\u201d he said. If his father had overruled her fish order, Mr. Trump said, \u201che would have said that only on the basis that he thought, \u2018That would be better for her.\u2019 \u201d The elder Mr. Trump did not hide his more traditional views on gender. When his son hired a woman, Barbara A. Res, as his head of construction in the 1980s, Fred Trump was mystified and annoyed. Mr. Trump said it was a different era. \u201cMy father,\u201d he said, \u201cprobably never would have seen a woman in that position. \u201d Mr. Trump still holds up his parents as models, praising his    mother for understanding and accommodating a husband who worked almost nonstop. \u201cMy mother was always fine with it,\u201d he said, recalling her \u201cbrilliant\u201d management of the situation. \u201cIf something got interrupted because he was going to inspect a housing site or something, she would handle that so beautifully. \u201d \u201cShe was an ideal woman,\u201d he said. With his purchase of the Miss Universe Organization, Mr. Trump was now in the business of young, beautiful women. They craved his advice and approval, a fact he seemed to understand well. Temple Taggart, the    Miss Utah, was startled by how forward he was with young contestants like her in 1997, his first year as the owner of Miss USA, a branch of the beauty pageant organization. As she recalls it, he introduced himself in an unusually intimate manner. Mr. Trump disputes this, saying he is reluctant to kiss strangers on the lips. But Ms. Taggart said it was not an isolated incident. At the gala celebration after the show, she said, Mr. Trump immediately zeroed in on her, telling her how much he liked her style and inviting her to visit him in New York to talk about her future. Soon enough, she said, he delivered another unwelcome kiss on her lips, this time in Trump Tower. After boasting of his connections to elite modeling agencies, he advised her to lie about her age to get ahead in the industry, she said. \u201c \u2018We\u2019re going to have to tell them you\u2019re 17,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Taggart recalled him telling her, \u201cbecause in his mind, 21 is too old. I was like, \u2018No, we\u2019re not going to do that.\u2019 \u201d His level of involvement in the pageants was unexpected, and his judgments, the contestants said, could be harsh. Carrie Prejean, who was 21 when she participated in the Miss USA contest in 2009 as Miss California, was surprised to find Mr. Trump personally evaluating the women at rehearsal. \u201cWe were told to put on our opening number outfits  \u2014   they were nearly as revealing as our swimsuits  \u2014   and line up for him onstage,\u201d she wrote in her memoir, \u201cStill Standing. \u201d Mr. Trump, in an interview, said he would \u201cnever do that. \u201d Such behavior, he said, would bruise egos and hurt feelings. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t hurt people,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s hurtful to people. \u201d Mr. Trump was not just fixated on the appearance of the women around him. He possessed an almost compulsive need to talk about it. Inside the Trump Organization, the company that manages his various businesses, he occasionally interrupted routine discussions of business to opine on women\u2019s figures. Ms. Res, his construction executive, remembered a meeting in which she and Mr. Trump interviewed an architect for a project in the Los Angeles area. Out of the blue, she said, Mr. Trump evaluated the fitness of women in Marina del Rey, Calif. \u201cThey take care of their asses,\u201d he said. \u201cThe architect and I didn\u2019t know where he was coming from,\u201d Ms. Res said. Years later, after she had gained a significant amount of weight, Ms. Res endured a stinging workplace observation about her own body from Mr. Trump. \u201c \u2018You like your candy,\u2019 \u201d she recalled him telling her. \u201cIt was him reminding me that I was overweight. \u201d Her colleague Louise Sunshine experienced similar observations from Mr. Trump when she gained weight. But she saw it as friendly encouragement, not a cruel insult. \u201cHe thought I looked much better thin,\u201d she said. \u201cHe would remind me of how beautiful I was. \u201d Whenever possible, Mr. Trump wanted his visitors to see his most attractive employees, as Ms. Res learned. Mr. Trump frequently sought assurances  \u2014   at times from strangers  \u2014   that the women in his life were beautiful. During the 1997 Miss Teen USA pageant, he sat in the audience as his teenage daughter, Ivanka, helped to host the event from onstage. He turned to Brook Antoinette Mahealani Lee, Miss Universe at the time, and asked for her opinion of his daughter\u2019s body. \u201c \u2018Don\u2019t you think my daughter\u2019s hot? She\u2019s hot, right?\u2019 \u201d Ms. Lee recalled him saying. \u2018I was like, \u2018Really?\u2019 That\u2019s just weird. She was 16. That\u2019s creepy. \u201d Ms. Brewer Lane, who dated Mr. Trump for several months in 1990 and early 1991, said it did not take long for him to solicit her view on the attractiveness of two of his previous romantic partners, Marla Maples and Ivana Trump. Mr. Trump said he did not know Ms. Brewer Lane very well, despite dating her. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have asked anybody about how they rate other women,\u201d he said. He liked to brag about his sexual prowess and his desirability as a date, no matter who was around. Barbara J. Fife, a deputy mayor under David N. Dinkins, New York\u2019s mayor in the early 1990s, was not especially close to Mr. Trump. But that did not stop him from telling her why he was in such a hurry one day as he sat in her office at City Hall. \u201cI have this great date tonight with a model for Victoria\u2019s Secret,\u201d Ms. Fife recalled him telling her. \u201cI saw it as immature, quite honestly,\u201d she said. At his office in Trump Tower, Mr. Trump seemed eager for his colleagues to hear about his new companion, Ms. Maples. When The New York Post feasted on her supposed satisfaction with him in bed, captured in the headline \u201cBest Sex I\u2019ve Ever Had,\u201d Mr. Trump was unabashed, Ms. Res said. Mr. Trump denies boasting about the headline. He seems more bashful these days, saying he cannot recall how many women he has dated. \u201cNot as many as people would think,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not somebody that really loved the dating process. \u201d To build his business, Mr. Trump turned to women for a simple reason: They worked hard  \u2014   often harder than men, he told them. When Mr. Trump hired Ms. Res to oversee the construction of Trump Tower, he invited her to his apartment on Fifth Avenue and explained that he wanted her to be his \u201cDonna Trump\u201d on the project, she said. Few women had reached such stature in the industry. He entrusted several women in his company with enormous responsibility  \u2014   once they had proven themselves worthy and loyal. Ms. Sunshine had little experience in real estate, but as a top campaign   for Gov. Hugh Carey of New York, she had fulfilled a lifelong wish for Mr. Trump: She secured him a vanity license plate with his initials, DJT, which adorned his limousine for years. Ms. Sunshine worked for Mr. Trump for 15 years, becoming a major New York real estate figure in her own right. Ms. Res remained at the company for 12 years, left after a disagreement over a project and then returned as a consultant for six more years. Both expressed gratitude for the chances Mr. Trump had taken on them. In a    industry thoroughly dominated by men, Mr. Trump\u2019s office stood out for its diversity, recalled Alan Lapidus, an influential architect who designed the Trump Plaza casino in Atlantic City. To women who had climbed to positions of power outside his company, Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior could feel like a jarring throwback. Alair A. Townsend was for a time the   woman inside New York\u2019s City Hall during the Koch administration, with the title of deputy mayor for economic development. But when Mr. Trump called her, she said, her position seemed less relevant to him than her gender. It was an unthinking habit when he interacted with women, colleagues said. \u201cAt Trump Tower,\u201d said Ms. Res, his longtime colleague, \u201che called me Honey Bunch. \u201d No single figure better encapsulated the paradoxes of Mr. Trump\u2019s treatment of women in the workplace than his first wife, Ivana. He entrusted her with major pieces of a corporate empire and gave her the titles to match. She was the president of Trump\u2019s Castle, a major casino in Atlantic City, and the Plaza Hotel, the storied complex on Central Park South in Manhattan. \u201cShe ran that hotel,\u201d Ms. Res said. \u201cAnd she ran it well. \u201d But he compensated her as a spouse, not a   employee, paying her an annual salary of $1 for the Trump\u2019s Castle job, according to her tax documents. And he grew to resent her outsize role. By the end of their marriage, Mr. Trump wrote in his 1997 book, \u201cThe Art of the Comeback,\u201d he regretted having allowed her to run his businesses. He seems to have kept his word. His current wife, Melania, has marketed her own lines of beauty products and jewelry. But Mr. Trump remains mostly uninvolved in her work. After calling it \u201cvery successful,\u201d he struggled to describe it. \u201cWhat is it on television with the sales?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat do they call that? Not Home Shopping, the other one. \u201d Once his first marriage started to collapse, Mr. Trump faced his most serious allegations of aggression toward women. When \u201cLost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J. Trump,\u201d by the journalist Harry Hurt III, was released in 1993, it included a description of a night in which Mr. Trump was said to have raped Ivana in a fit of rage. It also included a statement from Ivana that Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers insisted be placed in the front of the book. In the statement, she described an occasion of \u201cmarital relations\u201d during which \u201cI felt violated, as the love and tenderness, which he normally exhibited toward me, was absent. \u201d \u201cDuring a deposition given by me in connection with my matrimonial case, I stated that my husband had raped me,\u201d the statement said. \u201cI referred to this as a \u2018rape,\u2019 but I do not want my words to be interpreted in a literal or criminal sense. \u201d Mr. Trump denied raping Ivana, and she did not respond to a request for comment. After the allegation   in the news media last year, Ivana said in a statement, \u201cThe story is totally without merit. \u201d In the early 1990s, Jill Harth and her boyfriend at the time, George Houraney, worked with Mr. Trump on a beauty pageant in Atlantic City, and later accused Mr. Trump of inappropriate behavior toward Ms. Harth during their business dealings. In a 1996 deposition, Ms. Harth described their initial meeting with Mr. Trump at Trump Tower. Mr. Houraney said in a recent interview that he was shocked by Mr. Trump\u2019s response after he made clear that he and Ms. Harth were monogamous. \u201cHe said: \u2018Well, there\u2019s always a first time. I am going after her,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Houraney recalled, adding: \u201cI thought the man was joking. I laughed. He said, \u2018I am serious.\u2019 \u201d By the time the three of them were having dinner at the Oak Room of the Plaza Hotel the next night, Mr. Trump\u2019s advances had turned physical, Ms. Harth said in the deposition. \u201cBasically he   throughout that dinner, when he wasn\u2019t groping me under the table,\u201d she testified. \u201cLet me just say, this was a very traumatic thing working for him. \u201d Ms. Harth, who declined to comment, gave the deposition in connection with a lawsuit that alleged Mr. Trump had failed to meet his obligations in a business partnership. Mr. Trump settled that case but denied wrongdoing. Ms. Harth withdrew her own lawsuit against Mr. Trump alleging unwanted advances, but she has stood by her original claims. Mr. Trump said it was Ms. Harth who had pursued him, and his office shared email messages in which Ms. Harth, over the past year, thanked Mr. Trump for helping her personally and professionally and expressed support for his presidential candidacy. Mr. Trump says the world misunderstands his relationship with women. He sees himself as a promoter of women  \u2014   a man whose business deals, like the purchase of the struggling Miss Universe pageant, have given them untold opportunities for employment and advancement. \u201cHundreds and hundreds of women, thousands of women, are the better for it,\u201d he said. He has groomed his daughter, Ivanka, to run his company. And as a chief executive, he said, he admires women for a work ethic that can exceed that of the men around them. Mr. Trump recalled a telling exchange with a female worker. Several women who have held positions of power within the Trump Organization in recent years said they had never known Mr. Trump to objectify women or treat them with disrespect. \u201cI think there are mischaracterizations about him,\u201d said Jill Martin, a vice president and assistant counsel at the company. Ms. Martin said Mr. Trump had enthusiastically supported her decision to have two children over the past five years, even when it meant working from home and scaling back on business travel. \u201cThat\u2019s hard with women lawyers,\u201d she said. \u201cFor me, he\u2019s made it a situation where I can really excel at my job and still devote the time necessary for my family. \u201d After competing in the 2009 Miss USA pageant, Laura Kirilova Chukanov, a Bulgarian immigrant who lived in Utah, met with Mr. Trump in his New York office and explained that she wanted to make a documentary about her home country. Mr. Trump encouraged the project and followed through on a promise to put her in touch with his production company. \u201cHe genuinely wanted to know what I wanted to do with my life and how he could help,\u201d Ms. Chukanov said. But when Mr. Trump lost confidence in women, he could inflict lasting damage on their lives. After Alicia Machado won the 1996 Miss Universe title, something very human happened: She gained weight. Mr. Trump did not keep his critique of her changing body quiet  \u2014   he publicly shamed her, she said. Mr. Trump said he had pushed her to lose weight. \u201cTo that, I will plead guilty,\u201d he said, expressing no regret for his tactics. But the humiliation, Ms. Machado said, was unbearable. \u201cAfter that episode, I was sick, anorexia and bulimia for five years,\u201d she said. \u201cOver the past 20 years, I\u2019ve gone to a lot of psychologists to combat this. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628498.7295494}
