In an interview with Breitbart News after the show, Villa said she wore the dress in an attempt to \u201cbring us together and start a dialogue. \u201d \u201cLike hey, maybe if she is proud of what she believes in maybe I can leave her alone. Maybe I can leave my friend alone. Maybe I can leave my brother alone. Maybe I can actually still love them even though they disagree with my politics. That\u2019s what we need. A little bit of tolerance,\u201d Villa said.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum'"}, "time": 1742563491.9921122}
