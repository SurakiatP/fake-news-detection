[According to the Wrap, Fox News personality Jeanine Pirro will host the show, with each episode featuring a courtroom battle based on the day\u2019s   topics like free speech, gay rights and religious freedom.   After the facts and evidence in each case are presented, viewers will get to vote  \u2014   American   through text messages and the Fox Now app  \u2014   on the outcome of the case, with both the plaintiff and the defendant agreeing beforehand to abide by the decision of the voters. While Eastern and Central time zone viewers will get to weigh in earlier, the verdict could be overturned on the West Coast broadcasts if the cumulative number of votes from all viewers is enough to sway the outcome. The Wrap also reports that the \u201cclosing arguments\u201d in the cases  \u2014   traditionally delivered by attorneys for the plaintiff and defendant  \u2014   will instead be delivered by the plaintiffs and the defendants themselves as they sit across from each other. \u201cWelcome to the new face of American justice,\u201d Pirro says in the promo for the series (above). In addition to Pirro, the show\u2019s cases will be presided over by former California Superior Court judge LaDoris Cordell and six attorneys are set as regulars: Jose Baez, Benjamin Crump, Joseph Tacopina, Areva Martin, Mike Cavalluzzi and Charla Aldous.
