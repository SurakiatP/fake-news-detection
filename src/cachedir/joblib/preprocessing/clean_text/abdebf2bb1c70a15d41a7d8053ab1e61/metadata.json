The price of an   bag of seed corn rose to $300 from $80 in the last decade, as the companies that produced them consolidated, he said. And with the recent decline in commodity prices, Mr. Halcomb said he expects to lose $100 an acre this year. \u201cWe\u2019re producing our crops at a loss now, just like the oil guys are pumping oil at a loss,\u201d Mr. Halcomb, who grows corn, soybeans, wheat and barley on his   family farm, said by telephone on Wednesday. \u201cYou can\u2019t cut your costs fast enough. \u201d It is a common plight of farmers across the United States, with the global agriculture industry in a wrenching downturn. Because farmers have produced too much corn, wheat and soybeans, they have been forced to slash prices to sell their crops. They have also reduced spending on seeds, pesticides and fertilizer, which has eaten into sales at agribusiness giants, including Monsanto and DuPont. In response, these companies have sought   deals to cut costs and weather the industry\u2019s storm. Four major agribusiness mergers have been announced in the last year. The latest is Bayer AG\u2019s $56 billion takeover of Monsanto  \u2014   the largest acquisition of 2016  \u2014   announced on Wednesday. Every merger creates the possibility of higher costs for farmers. Mr. Halcomb buys seeds with traits licensed to Monsanto of St. Louis and seeds from DuPont, which has a deal pending to merge with Dow Chemical. His fertilizers are made of potassium compounds and phosphate produced by Agrium of Calgary, Alberta, which on Monday agreed to combine with the fertilizer producer Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan. He uses pesticides made by Syngenta of Switzerland, which agreed in February to a takeover by the China National Chemical Corporation. \u201cIt\u2019s just like any other industry that consolidates,\u201d Mr. Halcomb said. \u201cThey tell the regulators they\u2019re   and then they tell their customers they have to increase pricing after the deal\u2019s done. \u201d The companies say they are merging to diversify and increase growth and research capabilities, but these deals, given their size and scope, have already caught the attention of lawmakers and regulators in Washington. There is no guarantee that they will all receive regulatory approval, and some companies may have to sell assets to allay antitrust concerns. Dow\u2019s merger with DuPont is under Justice Department review. The market seemed to anticipate hurdles for the Monsanto deal on Wednesday. Shares of the company closed about 20 percent lower than the $128 per share cash offer from Bayer, which is based in Leverkusen, Germany. Shares of each company gained less than 1 percent after the deal was announced. Adding the assumption of about $10 billion of Monsanto debt, Bayer\u2019s total $66 billion pact is the largest   deal, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters, ahead of InBev\u2019s $60. 4 billion offer for another St.   company,   in June 2008. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, scheduled a hearing next week to discuss the possible effect of these   mergers on farming. Iowa produced more corn last year than any other state, according to the National Corn Growers Association. \u201cIt seems to be catching fire and happening so fast with so many,\u201d Senator Grassley said in a phone interview. \u201cWhen you have less competition, prices go up. \u201d European competition regulators also said publicly, before a   deal was even signed, that they would look at how it could affect prices and the availability of seed products, as well as research. Liam Condon, who leads Bayer\u2019s   division, said in an interview that the company did an \u201cextensive analysis\u201d with regard to antitrust before approaching Monsanto in May. Mr. Condon said that he does not believe there is much overlap between their portfolios, because Bayer\u2019s focus is largely on crop protection, while Monsanto\u2019s is on seeds and traits. He said the companies assume they may need to sell off some assets to appease regulators. Monsanto, which is famous for its production of genetically modified seeds, rejected several offers from Bayer as too low. Wednesday\u2019s deal represented a 44 percent premium to Monsanto\u2019s stock price on May 9, the day before Bayer\u2019s interest in a deal surfaced. To assuage Monsanto\u2019s concerns, Bayer threw in a $2 billion breakup fee if the deal fell apart on antitrust grounds. The strategic goal of the deal, according to Bill Selesky, an analyst at Argus Research, is to create a    experience for farmers, making Bayer the world\u2019s largest supplier of seeds and farm chemicals. By improving the product for farmers, the combined company could ultimately raise prices, Mr. Selesky said in an interview. Senator Grassley said that he had spoken with a few farmers who believed the deals were necessary so large agribusinesses could continue to absorb the costs of researching and developing products and getting government approval for them. Bayer and Monsanto said they planned to cut about $1. 2 billion worth of costs as part of the deal, helping to improve efficiency. But Jim Benham of Versailles, Ind. the president of the Indiana Farmers Union, was not so optimistic. He blamed the rising costs of inputs  \u2014   seeds, fertilizer and the like  \u2014   for eating away at farmers\u2019 profit margins, and warned that consolidation will make it worse. Costs have already risen by double digits over the last four to five years, and the proposed   merger could accelerate that. \u201cThe merger is going to hurt the farmer,\u201d said Mr. Benham, who grows corn, soybeans and sometimes wheat on his   farm. \u201cThe more consolidation we have on our inputs, the worse it gets. \u201d Mr. Condon of Bayer said that the company would not raise prices without providing more value to farmers. \u201cThis is a highly competitive industry, and just increasing prices without having any additional advantage or benefit for growers won\u2019t go anywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s up to us to show what we\u2019re offering will help farmers improve their return on investment. \u201d Some farmers said the consolidation could even enable prices to fall. Christine Hamilton manages a farm of more than 12, 000 acres in Kimball, S. D. growing crops like corn and operating a ranch. She said that if the deal can pass the antitrust screening, then maybe it could actually help farmers. \u201cI understand how companies need to get bigger in order to be competitive,\u201d she said. \u201cAs we are in a low part of the cycle, anything that might have a chance of reducing our input prices would be great. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561625.137036}
