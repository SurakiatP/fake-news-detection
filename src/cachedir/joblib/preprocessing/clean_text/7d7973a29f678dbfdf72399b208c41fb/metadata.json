He was 76. His death was announced by his manager, Joe Gordon, who said that Mr. Jarreau had been hospitalized for exhaustion two weeks ago. On the advice of his doctors, he had canceled his tour dates and retired from touring. Mr. Jarreau did not begin a   musical career until he was nearly 30, but within a few years he had begun attracting notice for a vocal style that was both instantly appealing and highly unusual. Critics were particularly taken by his improvisational dexterity, in particular his virtuosic ability to produce an array of vocalizations ranging from delicious nonsense to clicks and growls to   sounds. Although he made his initial mark in the jazz world, Mr. Jarreau\u2019s style, and his audience, crossed stylistic barriers. His music incorporated elements of pop, soul, gospel, Latin and other genres. It was a mark of his eclecticism that he won six Grammys across three different categories: jazz, pop and RB. He was also among the performers on a   children\u2019s album, \u201cIn Harmony: A Sesame Street Record. \u201d If Mr. Jarreau\u2019s highly accessible, intensely personal style defied easy classification, that very accessibility  \u2014   and, perhaps, the mere fact of his considerable commercial success  \u2014   left some jazz purists skeptical. Reviewing a concert by Mr. Jarreau at the Savoy in New York in 1981, Stephen Holden of The New York Times encapsulated what many saw as both the pros and the cons of Mr. Jarreau\u2019s singular style: \u201cAl Jarreau may be the most technically gifted singer working in   today,\u201d Mr. Holden wrote. Of the evening\u2019s performance, however, he continued: \u201cMr. Jarreau\u2019s concert lacked the emotional range of great jazz. He is such a prodigious talent that the absence of even the slightest blues inflections kept his music from cutting deeply. \u201d But critics\u2019 reservations never deterred Mr. Jarreau, who prided himself, as he told The Los Angeles Times in 1986, on his \u201cjazz attitude,\u201d which he defined as \u201cthe idea of being open to each and every moment as a chance to create something different. \u201d \u201cI try to be receptive,\u201d he added, \u201cand to be listening, and to not be afraid to try something new. \u201d Alwin Lopez Jarreau was born in Milwaukee on March 12, 1940, into a musical family. His father, a minister, was a fine singer his mother played the piano in church. Young Al began singing at 4, harmonizing with his siblings. As a youth he sang in church, as well as with   harmony groups and local jazz bands. Mr. Jarreau earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in psychology from Ripon College in Wisconsin in 1962, and a master\u2019s in vocational rehabilitation from the University of Iowa in 1964. Afterward he moved to San Francisco, where he worked as a rehabilitation counselor for people with disabilities. But Mr. Jarreau found he could not resist the pull of jazz and before long was singing in local nightclubs. By the late \u201960s, he had quit his day job and embarked on a nightclub career, first on the West Coast and eventually in New York. He reached a national audience with the album \u201cWe Got By,\u201d released by Warner Bros. in 1975 to critical praise and commercial success. Though advertised as his debut, it was actually his second album. A decade earlier, Mr. Jarreau had quietly recorded an album, later released on the Bainbridge label under the title \u201c1965. \u201d Though Mr. Jarreau took legal action, without success, to block its belated release in 1982, it is esteemed by jazz connoisseurs today. Appearances on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and other television shows raised his profile, as did extensive touring. In 1981 he had his biggest hit with the song \u201cWe\u2019re in This Love Together,\u201d which reached No. 15 on the Billboard pop singles chart. He won his first Grammy in 1978, for best jazz vocal performance, for his album \u201cLook to the Rainbow. \u201d He won his last in 2007, for best traditional RB vocal performance the award was shared by Mr. Jarreau, George Benson and Jill Scott for their collaborative performance \u201cGod Bless the Child. \u201d In between, in 1982, Mr. Jarreau earned a Grammy for best pop vocal performance by a male artist for the title track of his album \u201cBreakin\u2019 Away. \u201d That year, he also received the Grammy for best jazz vocal performance by a male artist, for his version of Dave Brubeck\u2019s \u201cBlue Rondo \u00e0 la Turk,\u201d from the same album. His other Grammys came in 1979 for the album \u201cAll Fly Home\u201d (in the jazz category) and in 1993 for the album \u201cHeaven and Earth\u201d (in RB). A seventh Grammy came in 1981 for \u201cIn Harmony: A Sesame Street Record,\u201d a compilation children\u2019s album that featured a range of artists. Among Mr. Jarreau\u2019s   recordings was the theme song for the   television series \u201cMoonlighting,\u201d for which he wrote the lyrics to Lee Holdridge\u2019s music. He appeared on Broadway as a replacement in the role of the Teen Angel in the 1994 revival of \u201cGrease. \u201d Mr. Jarreau\u2019s first marriage, to Phyllis Hall, ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife, the former Susan Player a son, Ryan two brothers, Marshall and Appie and a sister, Rose Marie Freeman. Mr. Jarreau canceled a number of concert dates in 2010 after experiencing heart and breathing problems during a European tour. He was hospitalized for 11 days but resumed his touring schedule after his release, and had continued to perform until recently. Shortly after his 2010 hospitalization, he said in an interview that his health problems had not been as serious as reports suggested, but joked that he appreciated the attention they received in the media because it proved that he was a celebrity. \u201cI figured,\u201d he said, \u201c \u2018Yeah, maybe I have arrived.\u2019 \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564173.3406887}
