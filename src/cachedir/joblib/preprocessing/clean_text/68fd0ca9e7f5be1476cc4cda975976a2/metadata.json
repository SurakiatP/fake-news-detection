The Rock, its \u201cSexiest Man Alive\u201d for 2016, ushering him into an elite group of physically appealing men that over the years has included George Clooney, Matt Damon and David Beckham. The award is, of course, a naked public relations enterprise, bestowed upon a celebrity  \u2014   often an actor  \u2014   who is in the throes of promoting a new project. In Mr. Johnson\u2019s case, that would be \u201cMoana,\u201d an animated Disney film, which will open in wide release on Nov. 23. He will also   in the eighth film of the \u201cFast and the Furious\u201d franchise next year as well as in a remake of \u201cJumanji,\u201d and he has been chronicling daily the filming process of that film on his Instagram account, which has nearly 70 million followers. Mr. Johnson told the magazine: \u201cI\u2019m not quite too sure where we go from here. I\u2019ve done it all this is it. \u201d The magazine has been criticized for nearly always choosing a white man for the cover of this issue. But in Mr. Johnson, the magazine chose its first actor of Samoan heritage. (In interviews, Mr. Johnson has described himself as half black and half Samoan.) Denzel Washington was the first black actor to hold the title. Mr. Johnson, who is 44 and the father of two girls  \u2014   Simone, 15, and Jasmine, 11 months  \u2014   became famous in the late 1990s and early 2000s as a performer with World Wrestling Entertainment. He turned toward Hollywood and found success with films like \u201cThe Mummy Returns\u201d (2001) and a spinoff, \u201cThe Scorpion King\u201d (2002). He joined the \u201cFast and the Furious\u201d franchise in 2011 for its fifth film. This year, according to Forbes magazine, he became the world\u2019s   actor. (It may be noteworthy that four of the Top 5 earners  \u2014   Mr. Johnson, Mr. Damon, Tom Cruise and Johnny Depp  \u2014   have each been People\u2019s Sexiest Man Alive. It may also be noteworthy that with one exception, Kate Upton in 2014, the magazine does not traditionally name a \u201cSexiest Woman Alive. \u201d) \u201cRemember, sexy isn\u2019t something you \u2018try and be.\u2019 Sexy happens naturally when you\u2019re comfortable just being yourself,\u201d Mr. Johnson wrote on Instagram Tuesday when sharing the news. At    and 245 pounds, he is, physically, one of the largest men ever chosen by the magazine. Muscle and Fitness magazine once chronicled his daily diet at the height of his bodybuilding regimen: more than 5, 000 calories spread over seven meals, including a dozen eggs, a lot of cod and a steak. (In \u201cMoana,\u201d he voices the demigod Maui, a character that has been criticized as promoting negative stereotypes of Polynesians as overweight.) The actor is unabashedly populist in his career choices, telling British GQ last summer that he is \u201cin the business of making movies for people, making content for people. \u201d \u201cAnd that means people all over the world,\u201d he continued. \u201cBecause as soon as you start thinking on a global scale, you are making more people happy, you are making more money, you are making the studios more money, you are making everybody happy. \u201d In that same interview, Mr. Johnson floated the idea of following the model set by Arnold Schwarzenegger, a fellow    and perhaps going into politics. \u201cI can\u2019t deny that the thought of being governor, the thought of being president, is alluring,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd beyond that, it would be an opportunity to make a real impact on people\u2019s lives on a global scale. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628361.3437033}
