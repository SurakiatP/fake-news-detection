Now the property is about to set another record  \u2014   as Palm Beach\u2019s most expensive  . Backhoes and dump trucks have started crushing and carting away the    French provincial home at 515 North County Road, along with an    tennis house, a pool house and a carriage house. While such   have become common in Palm Beach and other   resort towns, the demolition of the   estate known as Maison de l\u2019Amiti\u00e9, or House of Friendship, represents a new level of disposable wealth. Bought by Mr. Trump in 2004 for $41 million and sold in 2008 to a Russian billionaire for $95 million, the residence has since sat empty, a monument to the housing bubble and to Trump\u2019s outsize salesmanship. The big question now is what will come next for one of Palm Beach\u2019s biggest white elephants and whether its value can ever reach its 2008 record price. According to town planning documents, the owner of the property, a limited liability company linked to the Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev, plans to split the property into three parcels that will be sold. Last week, the Palm Beach Town Council approved the owner\u2019s proposal to subdivide the property. It\u2019s unclear when the properties will be listed. Brokers say each parcel, at around two acres, would have to sell for $35 million to $40 million for the owner to make a profit. \u201cIt\u2019s an aggressive price,\u201d said Gary Pohrer, a real estate agent in Palm Beach. \u201cIt\u2019s possible. But it could take a long time. \u201d The history of the property is filled with financial ups and downs. It was once owned by Robert Dun Douglass, a member of the Dun  Bradstreet family. The property was sold in 1930 to Harrison Williams, an electric utility tycoon said to be one of the richest men in America. After successive owners and building changes, the property was bought in 1988 for $12. 08 million by Abraham Gosman, a Massachusetts nursing home and health care magnate. Mr. Gosman built the current mansion on the property. But after his business faltered and his debts piled up from lavish spending, Mr. Gosman filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation in 2003. In 2004, as part of the bankruptcy, the property went up for auction. Mr. Trump topped at least two other bidders with an offer of $41. 35 million. After the sale, he told The Palm Beach Daily News that he would turn the estate into the \u201c  house in America,\u201d after his    home down the road. He would then sell it to \u201ccreate terrific value. \u201d The extent of Mr. Trump\u2019s improvements after the purchase remain unclear. Mr. Trump initially said he had \u201cgutted the house\u201d and made $25 million in extensive renovations. Yet in the application for demolition, filed in February, the architect for the project said that the 2005 and 2006 renovations were limited to a new kitchen, the creation of new bedrooms and bathrooms, and \u201csome minor interior alterations of doors, frames and windows. \u201d Mr. Trump put the home on the market in 2006 for $125 million, making it the most expensive listing in America at the time. When no buyers emerged and Mr. Trump replaced several brokers, he trimmed the price to $120 million. In the summer of 2008, just before the real estate market crashed, Mr. Trump found his buyer: Mr. Rybolovlev, a former medical student who took his fertilizer company public in 2007 and later moved to Switzerland and Monaco. He had toured several homes in Palm Beach but hadn\u2019t found what he wanted. \u201cI showed him five big oceanfront homes,\u201d said Carol Digges, a real estate broker representing Mr. Rybolovlev at the time. \u201cBut he said, \u2018I want something more grand, something bigger. \u2019\u201d When she showed him Maison de l\u2019Amiti\u00e9, Mr. Rybolovlev was impressed and eventually negotiated a deal. Mr. Trump maintains he sold the property for $100 million, yet people involved in the deal, as well as the sales deed, put the price at $95 million. At the time, Mr. Rybolovlev said he bought the property as an investment. \u201cThis acquisition is simply an investment,\u201d he said in a statement and \u201cdoes not represent a decision by me to live in the U. S. \u201d Technically, the buyer was a limited liability company, County Road Property L. L. C. which is controlled by an offshore trust benefiting members of the Rybolovlev family. Mr. Rybolovlev was named in the Panama Papers (the leaked documents that disclosed information on offshore entities of the wealthy) as having used offshore trusts to hold assets, though a spokesman said the trusts were used for \u201casset protection and estate planning. \u201d Yet according to Mr. Rybolovlev\u2019s   Elena, Mr. Rybolovlev may have had other reasons to pay a high price for the property and to use offshore trusts. When the limited liability company bought the property, the Rybolovlevs were in the midst of a bitter divorce. Mr. Rybolovlev\u2019s   accused him in a lawsuit of \u201csecreting and transferring assets in order to avoid his obligations,\u201d and she sought half of the Palm Beach house. Mr. Rybolovlev denied the claims, adding that the trusts were created years before the divorce. Last fall, the two reached a settlement and agreed to end all legal actions related to the divorce, including the claims over the Palm Beach property. In the eight years after the purchase, Mr. Rybolovlev quietly entertained offers on the home, according to local brokers, but none met his asking price of more than $125 million. In March, the Palm Beach Architectural Commission approved the demolition of the estate. According to brokers and neighbors, crews have been working daily at the site with an oversize backhoe and bulldozer. The limited liability company has also submitted a request to the town to subdivide the land into three parcels. The proposal calls for the largest lot, at the southern end, to be 2. 35 acres, with the potential to include a house of more than 51, 000 square feet with 10 bedrooms and 12 baths. The other two parcels would be just under two acres, able to accommodate homes of 42, 000 square feet. In Palm Beach, the biggest land prize is ocean frontage. The largest parcel would have 173 linear feet on the water, while the other two would have about 150. To receive the expected asking price, the parcels would have to sell for more than $215, 000 a linear foot of ocean frontage. Brokers say most recent sales of Palm Beach oceanfront went for about $100, 000 to $120, 000 a linear foot. Kenneth Griffin, the hedge fund manager, has spent more than $120 million in Palm Beach to buy and combine four parcels of land, which brokers say worked out to be more than $200, 000 a linear foot. Mr. Rybolovlev\u2019s property is considered among the best on the island  \u2014   close to the town center and with direct access to the beach. Some brokers say it could well top the Griffin price. \u201cI suspect one person will buy all three parcels of land and keep it as one estate,\u201d said Angela Koch, a Palm Beach real estate broker. \u201cAll it takes is another Ken Griffin. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628452.1966436}
