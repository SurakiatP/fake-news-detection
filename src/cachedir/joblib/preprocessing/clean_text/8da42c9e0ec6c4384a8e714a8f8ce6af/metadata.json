Benjamin Barber, one of Hillary Clinton\u2019s major donors, said \u201cBlacks are seriously fucked in the head\u201d for helping \u201cthe other side.\u201d\\nIn the video, a Project Veritas journalist talks to Benjamin Barber i nside a Democrat fundraiser for North Carolina U.S. Senate candidate Deborah Ross. In the video, Barber compared black people voting for Republicans to Sonderkommandos Jews who helped kill other Jews for the Nazis.\\n\\n\u201cHave you heard of the Sonderkommandos? Jewish guards who helped murder Jews in the camps. So there were even Jews that were helping the Nazis murder Jews! So blacks who are helping the other side are seriously fucked in the head. They\u2019re only helping the enemy who will destroy them. Maybe they think \u2018if I help them we\u2019ll get along okay; somehow I\u2019ll save my race by working with the murderers.\u2019\u201d\\nDeborah Ross also makes comments about black voters being less likely to vote if an ID law was passed requiring voters to provide a form of identification.\\n\u201cRepublicans know that African Americans are less likely to have the ID so they won\u2019t vote.\u201d \u2013 Democratic Senate candidate D eborah Ross. \\nIn another segment of the video the Project Veritas journalist says \u201cso it\u2019s like they are voting against their own self interest?\u201d to both Benjamin Barber and Leah Barber.\\nBoth responded agreeing with the journalist\u2019s statement.\\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense, You\u2019re voting against your self interest. In the name of change, what is the change that they want to see.\u201d \u2013 Leah Barber\\nProject Veritas showed the comments made by Benjamin Barber and U.S. senate candidate Deborah Ross to several prominent black Americans who were all absolutely disgusted by the comments.\\n\u201cWow, so that\u2019s what they think of us? I\u2019m speechless. For the most part it\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s an eye opener but that\u2019s what happens when we as blacks vote for one party,\u201d Robert Foster said after seeing the video.\\nPastor William Cooper weighed in when questioned if he was betraying his race as an African American voter voting for a Republican.\\nCooper responded \u201cabsolutely not I think I\u2019m benefiting my race by voting against the Democrat party that takes the African American vote for granted. They don\u2019t offer us anything.\u201d\\nBishop Patrick Wooden added his frustration and disgust saying, \u201cI think that Deborah Ross has showed her true colors, if that\u2019s not racism and condescending and basically calling blacks stupid and ignorant and saying we\u2019re voting against our own self interest if we support any Republican I am appalled.\u201d\\nPamela Wooden expressed her disappointment saying she \u201cconsidered it an insult to see those accusations and hear that type of discussion is insulting to me as an African American.\u201d\\nFinally, John Amanchukwu said that \u201cIt\u2019s not just dark money, it\u2019s racist and evil money filled with venom and you can look at his eyes in the video and you can see there\u2019s a rage there and there\u2019s a deep seeded resentment of African Americans.\u201d\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThe post Video Exposes Hillary Donor: \u201cBlacks Are Seriously Fucked in The Head\u201d appeared first on We Are Change .\\n'"}, "time": 1742564432.1588483}
