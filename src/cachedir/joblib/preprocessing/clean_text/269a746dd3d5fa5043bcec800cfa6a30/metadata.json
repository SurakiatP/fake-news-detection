As you will see below, the percentage of \u201cnones\u201d in this country has absolutely skyrocketed over the past decade. But not all faiths are losing members in the United States. In fact, Islam, Buddhism, Wicca and various New Age organizations have all experienced excellent growth in recent years. Sadly, almost all of the growth for the \u201cnones\u201d has come at the expense of Christianity. Americans are leaving the Christian faith in droves, and this is why many of our churches are less than half full on Sunday mornings. What we are doing right now is clearly not working, and hopefully we can get the church in America to wake up while there is still time to do so. \\nEarlier today I came across a brand new study from the Pew Research Center entitled \u201c Why America\u2019s \u2018nones\u2019 left religion behind \u201c. One thing that particularly stood out to me was the fact that most \u201cnones\u201d were once affiliated with a particular religion but have now discarded that label\u2026 \\nPerhaps the most striking trend in American religion in recent years has been the growing percentage of adults who do not identify with a religious group . And the vast majority of these religious \u201cnones\u201d (78%) say they were raised as a member of a particular religion before shedding their religious identity in adulthood. \\nOverall, the percentage of \u201cnones\u201d in this nation has been absolutely soaring in recent years. Back in 2007, \u201cnones\u201d made up 16 percent of the population, but now that number has risen to 23 percent. The following is from a different Pew Research Center report that was published last year \u2026 \\nReligious \u201cnones\u201d \u2013 a shorthand we use to refer to people who self-identify as atheists or agnostics, as well as those who say their religion is \u201cnothing in particular\u201d \u2013 now make up roughly 23% of the U.S. adult population. This is a stark increase from 2007, the last time a similar Pew Research study was conducted, when 16% of Americans were \u201cnones.\u201d ( During this same time period, Christians have fallen from 78% to 71%. ) \\nI want you to notice one particularly sobering fact in the excerpt posted above. The seven percent increase in the percentage of \u201cnones\u201d was matched exactly by a seven percent decrease in the percentage of Christians. \\nIt is time to face a very hard truth \u2013 Christianity is in rapid decline in America. \\nSo why is this happening? \\nIs there an explanation for why so many people are leaving the church? \\nWell, here is some of the feedback that the Pew Research Center received while conducting their new survey\u2026 \\nAbout half of current religious \u201cnones\u201d who were raised in a religion (49%) indicate that a lack of belief led them to move away from religion. This includes many respondents who mention \u201cscience\u201d as the reason they do not believe in religious teachings, including one who said \u201c I\u2019m a scientist now, and I don\u2019t believe in miracles .\u201d Others reference \u201c common sense ,\u201d \u201c logic \u201d or a \u201c lack of evidence \u201d \u2013 or simply say they do not believe in God. \\nThis is such a tragedy, because during my decades of research into these things I have found that logic and reason should always point people toward the Christian faith and not away from it. There is an absolutely gigantic   for Christianity out there, but unfortunately most people don\u2019t know about it or they are not interested in considering it. \\nThe biggest cultural shift has been happening among our young people. Most of them have been raised in an environment where God has been removed from almost every corner of public life, and the results have been beyond catastrophic. \\nIn America today, 35 percent of all Millennials are \u201cnones\u201d. \\nMillennials are more than twice as likely to be \u201cnones\u201d as Baby Boomers (17 percent), and they are more than three times as likely to be \u201cnones\u201d as the Silent Generation (11 percent). \\nIn other words, the younger you are the more likely you are to be religiously unaffiliated. \\nAnd this shows up in the church attendance numbers as well. Millennials are much, much less likely to be in church on any particular Sunday morning than the oldest Americans are. The following information comes from another Pew Research Center report \u2026 \\nMillennials \u2013 especially the youngest Millennials, who have entered adulthood since the first Landscape Study was conducted \u2013 are far less religious than their elders. For example, only 27% of Millennials say they attend religious services on a weekly basis, compared with 51% of adults in the Silent generation . Four-in-ten of the youngest Millennials say they pray every day, compared with six-in-ten Baby Boomers and two-thirds of members of the Silent generation. Only about half of Millennials say they believe in God with absolute certainty, compared with seven-in-ten Americans in the Silent and Baby Boom cohorts. And only about four-in-ten Millennials say religion is very important in their lives, compared with more than half in the older generational cohorts. \\nWe are slowly losing an entire generation. \\nWhen you walk into most churches in America on Sunday morning, what are you going to find? \\nYou are going to find that the congregation is dominated by \u201cthe greys\u201d, and I am not talking about space aliens. \\nAs the oldest Americans die off, the United States is becoming less and less Christian. We are on the exact same path that Europe has already gone down, but most churches are just going on with business as usual and don\u2019t seem to even understand that we have a major crisis on our hands. \\nAs I said at the top of this article, what we are doing right now is clearly not working, and if we continue on the path that we are currently on we will continue to lose young people by the millions. \\nAmerica needs revival more than it has ever needed it before. \\nLet us pray that one arrives very soon. There Is A Mainstream Media Conspiracy To Hide Hillary Clinton\u2019s Rapidly Failing Health \u00bb Grillsgt. \\nAnd then there are those who realized virtually all churches in their area are either preaching heresy, or are downright apostate. Mke \\nOr they are so watered down and user-friendly that you feel like you wasted a good part of your Sunday when you leave. I\u2019m amazed at most churches I go into these days. Not a lot of comprehensive, honest Bible-teaching going on. That\u2019s why people are walking away. Sure, some will walk away when you boldly teach the Bible, but that\u2019s the way it is supposed to be. iris \\nYes, people need truth. Can the church growth models! Preach the gospel. If church leaders won\u2019t do it, that\u2019s their problem, we can share Christ every day with those we come in contact with, by word and deed. I\u2019m glad we\u2019re in a congregation where it is shared every week. PoorBoy2 \\nCould it be that all of these years of focusing on \u201cReligion\u201d and do\u2019s and don\u2019t\u2019s instead of relationship with the one true God is bearing fruit? Though ritual and tradition can be meaningful and helpful, without relationship they are dead and empty leading to \u201cnones\u201d. Mike \\nI\u2019d say it\u2019s more related to greasy grace, once saved always saved no matter how backslidden you are, and \u201cwe don\u2019t want to offend anybody\u201d type teaching going on. Most of the teaching on the radio and in the churches is weak. Paul Patriot \\nSo, do you think someone can lose their salvation based on works Can one obtain salvation by works \\nIf someone is a backsliding \u201cChristian\u201d then I concur that they were never really saved. \\nReference the parable of the sower and this will reveal the wheat and tares sitting next to one another in churches across this world. \\nIf Jesus does not have the power to truly save you and by your actions you can lose that salvation, then his work on Calvary was not as great as the Bible says it was\u2026\u2026.he is either the Savior or he is not, and a saved person will act a certain way, and not backside back into the pig pen, thus revealing their false conversion. \\nJust sayin\u2026\u2026.I agree with you most teaching today is weak, there is no more preaching of he\u2019ll and no more preaching that unless you are born again, you will not be saved\u2026and that Jesus is the ONLY name j Der heaven in which we can be saved. algol2000 \\nThe righteousness of Jesus is for Jesus. Work out your own by following in his footsteps. iris \\nSo very true! When Christians realize that it is His righteousness living in, guiding and empowering us, sanctifying us, redeeming us, we humbly and gratefully, submit to His leading in hope, peace and joy. We boast in Him, not in ourselves or our ability to do good, and have that blessed assurance. He is our confidence and our worth is in Him. We cling to what He has accomplished for us on the Cross, and even more, in what He is doing in our lives by God\u2019s Holy Spirit. 1Corinthians 1:30-31. Grillsgt. \\n\u201c8 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, 9 not of works, lest anyone should boast.\u201d Eph. 2:8-9 algol2000 \\nThe watering down, so to speak is in these very words, and has led to the blatant apostasy that you are witnessing. The grace that Jesus provides is so that God can be patient while you bring forth the fruits (works) required for sonship. Grillsgt. \\nA works-based salvation?? Seriously?? Do you also believe that one can lose their salvation? Not trying to sound snarky, but just asking about your views. watchmannonthewall \\nWhy would Jesus speak about blotting a persons name out of the Book of Life if it is an empty threat? Wouldn\u2019t He be guilty of atempted manipulation, deception, if one really can\u2019t be blotted out? of course the writer of Hebrews refers to this in Hebrews 6:4-6 and again in 10:26-31. \\nKorah is a prime example in the OT, having seen all of God\u2019s miracles and even been choosen to minister for God as Levite yet he rebelled and fire came out from God and the earth opened to receive him. The fire and opening of the earth is just a concealed OT way of indicating he went to the Lake of Fire for his rebellion! \\nOnce saved always saved is another false doctrine that has made many feel comfortable in their sin! But Jesus said, \u201cDepart from me you workers of lawlessness.\u201d This was to people convinced they knew Him, but He said He didn\u2019t know them! We need to make sure He knows us and this means, by definition, we walk in a \u201cLawful\u201d manner! algol2000 \\nA work-based salvation is what Jesus taught. \u201cExcept your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the pharisees and the pharisees, ye shall in no wise see the kingdom of heaven\u201d. \u201cBe ye perfect (in deeds) just as your heavenly father is perfect\u201d. \\nOn this earth, deeds are the basis for judgement in an earthly court, how much more so in heaven? Without laws to govern conduct, there can be no sin. Sin is the transgression of the law. And law-breakers will be punished by the Judge. watchmannonthewall \\nCan we take a look at scripture to see how well the statement you quoted, made by Paul, aligns itself to all of scripture? \\nGod says in Isaiah 46:10 that He declares the end from the beginning. Let\u2019s go to \u201cthe End\u201d, work our way back to \u201cthe Beginning\u201d, and see what God says in His Word, OK? \\nRev. 20:13- \u201cAnd the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged, every one of the according to THEIR DEEDS [works].\u201d This is speaking only of those who are \u201clost\u201d. What about the \u201csaved\u201d? \\nRev. 14:13- \u201cAnd I heard a voice from heaven, saying, \u2018Write\u2019, \u201cBlessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on!\u201d \u201cYes\u201d says the Spirit, \u201cthat they may rest from their labor, for their DEEDS [works] follow with them.\u201d \\nThe book of Revelation indicates the works by both saints and the wicked are noticed by God. See also in the message to each of the seven churches in Revelation 2-3, John records Jesus as claiming, \u201cI know thy works\u2026\u201d Clearly Jesus considers \u201cworks\u201d in His assessment of His people! \\nJames, the brother of Jesus, had this to say about works (James 2:14-24): \u201cWhat use is it brethren, if a man says he has faith, BUT he has no works? Can that [workless] faith save him?\u201d\u2026\u201dEven so faith, if it has no works, is DEAD being by itself.\u201d\u2026Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he offered up Isaac his son? You see that faith was working with his works, and as a result of THE WORKS, faith was perfected\u2026You see that a man is justified by works, and NOT by faith ALONE.\u201d James states works are a necessary addition to faith. What does Paul say? \\nIn Paul\u2019s pastoral epistle to Titus, he writes the following (3:8): \u201cThis is a trustworthy statement; and concerning these things I want you to speak confidently so that those who have believed God [those who have faith] may be careful to engage in good DEEDS.\u201d \\nIn his letter to Timothy (1 Tim. 6:17-18) Paul tells Timothy, \u201cInstruct those who are rich in this present world not to be conceited or to fix their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on God who richly supplies us with all things to enjoy. Instruct them to do good [deeds], to be rich in good WORKS, to be generous and ready to share\u2026\u201d Again, Paul speaks about putting feet to one\u2019s faith! \\nJust two verses after the one you quote in Ephesians above, Paul writes (v.10), \u201cFor we are His [the Father\u2019s] workmanship created in Christ Jesus FOR good works, which God prepared beforehand , that we should walk in them.\u201d God obviously expects His people to \u201cdo\u201d good works, having prepared these ahead of time for them! \\nJesus said the following concerning \u201cworks\u201d: \u201cFor the Son of Man is going to come in the glory of His Father with His angels; and will then recompense every man ACCORDING TO HIS DEEDS.\u201d (Mt. 16:27) Note that this specifically occurs with regard to the return of Christ and applies to His people, those who are \u201csaved\u201d! Jesus also said we are to let our light shine before men so they see our \u201cgood works\u201d and glorify His Father. (Mt. 5:16) You see Paul agreed with Jesus\u2019 teaching concerning His expectation of His people to perform \u201cgood works\u201d and says they will be rewarded in the kingdom according to these. \\nSo what are these \u201cgood works\u201d? Lots of debate about this, but not surprisingly, scripture clearly identifies these. It is just that people don\u2019t want to accept what God said that they tend to ignore His Words! \\nPaul tells us in 1 Timothy 3:16-17, \u201cALL Scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine, for REPROOF, for CORRECTION, for TRAINING IN RIGHTEOUSNESS [traininng in the performance of \u201cgood works\u201d],that the man of God may be adequate, and EQUIPPED for every good work\u201d. \\nPaul says Scripture, OT and NT(and understand the NT wasn\u2019t written when Paul wrote this to Timothy and Paul never claimed his letters were scripture as the Gentile \u201cChurch\u201d made this claim many years later), is the source of instruction to identify and instruct us in the performance of \u201cgood works\u201d. Paul just got done speaking to Timothy, in the prior two verses, about how he had known the \u201cscriptures\u201d from childhood. When Timothy was a child, none of the NT had been written! Not one word! Paul therefore told Timothy and US the OT contains the instructions regarding what God considers good works and how they are to be performed. We already have looked at the fact we will all be judged on how well we obey God\u2019s instructions in this matter! \\nWe see the NT, John, James, Paul , Jesus, all teach people, saved and unsaved , will be judged by their works. Where does \u201cfaith\u201d enter the outcome? If one has saving faith, as James said Abraham did as evidenced by his obedience to God\u2019s instructions, we will be obedient to God\u2019s Word. Note James also says the devils \u201cbelieve\u201d, but we know they do NOT obey God\u2019s instructions. How many of us are just like them? \\nIs being judged by our works just a NT expectation? James already used Abraham as an example to indicate it is not. Jeremiah (17:10) also says, \u201cI, the LORD, search the heart, I test the mind, even to give to EVERY man according to his ways, according to the results of his DEEDS.\u201d Adam and Eve were cast out of the Garden, according to their deeds! \\nThe \u201cgreasy grace\u201d of today is one catalyst for the current malaise affecting the people\u2019s relationship to God and/or the lack of relevance Christianity has for many. Many of today\u2019s preachers don\u2019t even know scripture says what I just shared, straight from scripture, with you! \\nWhen Jesus said he came to destroy the \u201cworks of the devil\u201d He was referring to destroying rebellion against obedience to God by empowering His people to obey His Word through the indwelling Spirit! \\nUnfortunately, the devil has now got many believing that once you say the prayer of faith, you\u2019ve done all you need to do to go to heaven, but Scripture doesn\u2019t teach that , does it? It actually teaches your faith is to be able to be seen by your daily walk, your works as defined by God\u2019s Word! Now you know!! Just do it! Grillsgt. \\nEphesians 2:10\u2026\u201d For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.\u201d Notice Paul said, FOR good works, not by them. Also, Titus 3: 4-7\u2026\u201d4 But when the kindness and the love of God our Savior toward man appeared, 5 not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, 6 whom He poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior, 7 that having been justified by His grace we should become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.\u201d Now\u2026does the Bible contradict itself, or could it be, one or more opinions of this subject might be mistaken? Grillsgt. \\nRight, PB2! There is a movement afoot to replace Christianity with \u201cChurchianity\u201d. AverGo \\nExciting, If you believe that God\u2019s Word, Never Returns Void. Then couple that with, Bring up a Man in the Way he should go, then Later he will not depart from it. Then as the Endtimes become more undeniable, God will bring back the Prodigal sons and daughters. 2 Thessalonians 2:3 Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; watchmannonthewall \\nBoth Paul and Solomon spoke of the children of the last generation being very rebellious and full of pride. It is the mirror image of what happened at the Exodus. \\nThere it was the parents who did not believe God and obey Him, refused to go up and take the Land. Here, in this last generation, it is the children who have rebelled againt parents and Jeus even said the those of a man\u2019s OWN household would be HIS worst enemies. \\nUnderstanding the passage, a paraphrase from Micah 7:6, the father, the man, is in the right and those opposing him are in the wrong! \\nJesus never taught opposition to parents any more than He taught opposition to the Father! Both are the Creators of others and Creators are to be honored and obeyed by the Created. 1st commandment and 5th commandment- Love God and others and parents are the first neighbors we are to love! K \\nWhich came first. People walking away from the Church? Or the Church walking away from real Godly teachings. Dale Graley \\nvery good point Ambassador 2Co 5:20 \\nA few years ago I was with a group of professed Christians who had this \u201cas long as we believe in Jesus it doesn\u2019t matter what else we believe\u201d attitude. They were lamenting the dumbing down of America in our schools primarily but the dumbing down of culture in general as well. I asked them if they believed the USA was a Christian nation, now or in the past. They said yes to which I replied \u201cyou can\u2019t dumb down a Christian nation unless you dumb down Christianity first.\u201d As you can imagine that didn\u2019t go over very well. \\nIsaiah 4:1 And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by thy name, to take away our reproach. \\nThat verse is a prophetic statement told in symbols, so those who don\u2019t have eyes to see will not get it. Read the surrounding context and you can tell it\u2019s about the end times. Anyway the symbol breakdown is this: \\nseven = completion or totality women = churches (bride of Christ) one man = Jesus bread = doctrine apparel = righteousness (white robes or filthy rags) \\nReread Isaiah 4:1 with the symbols decoded and it says \u201cAnd in the day all the churches shall say to Jesus, we will teach our own ways, and present ourselves to the world in any manner we see fit: only let us be called Christians to take away our shame. OriginalRS \\nThe latter, most definitely. RageHard84 \\nDang. This question cuts to the point. I mean, there are churches which have abandoned sound doctrine and adopted heresies like serpent seed, the idea that homosexuality and transgenderism are promoted by the Bible when they\u2019re really sins, it\u2019s crazy. LowellST13 \\nThe government and the 501C3 tax exempt for Churches has dissolved sound doctrine. Churches have sold their soul to the devil, government, I get those two confused. I am fortunate to be part of an Independent Baptist Church that is sound in the KJV 1611 and if I have a problem with Sermon\u2019s I look at the bible first and if it is there than it is my problem. I need to change, not THE CHURCH or the BIBLE THE BIBLE and how GOD Authored it is the same Yesterday, today, and forever AMEN David \\nrepenting is not enough.

Joan Camara \\nCan I have hate and anger toward evil people? krinks \\nThe Church walking away from Godly teaching. When I was a young man in the early 70s I clearly recall very few politicians dared to proclaim their support for abortion. They feared the wrath of the Christian Vote. Only the far left Pelosi/Sanders type dared to proclaim such. Over time people stopped taking the Lord into the Voting Booth, emboldening the Perverts. Today rare is the politician that can get ahead by proclaiming Christian Principles. The DNC in hacked correspondence actually discussed the best way to get rid of Religious Liberty in America. Yet even at this most that call themselves Christians will vote for them. It is all I can do to not go to Church and cuss them all out for what they have allowed our nation to become. watchmannonthewall \\nK, great question! I\u2019d like to give a shot as to the apex of the problem and answer a question Michael posed in his book, \u201cThe Rapture Verdict\u201d, where he inquired if anyone knew what the \u201cgreat apostacy\u201d is, which Paul spoke of in 2 Thessalonians 2:3 saying, \u201cLet no one in any way deceive you, for it [the Day of the LORD from verse 2] will not come unless the apostasy comes first [1] and the man of lawlessness is revealed [2], the son of destruction.\u201d (NASB) We see there is first a great apostacy, which comes BEFORE the anti-christ and THEN the anti-christ is revealed (Michael pointed this out in his book). It agrees with Jesus\u2019 timeline in Mt. 24:29-31 regarding the \u201cgathering\u201d of His saints! In fact, since the anti-christ is called \u201cthe man of lawlessness\u201d, this should clue us in to the fact the \u201capostacy\u201d is related to \u201clawlessness\u201d increasing, a necessity to set the stage for the anti-christ, even as Jesus prophesied in Mt. 24:12. Recall, Jesus also said He did not know those who \u201cPRACTICE lawlessness\u201d in Mt. 7:23, even though these people were PERFORMING MIRACLES using His Name!! The KJV translates \u201capostacy\u201d as \u201cfalling away\u201d in 2 Thess. 2:3, and Strong\u2019s says the term is used just twice in the NT: \u201cGrk. #646- apostasia\u201d and defines the term as \u201cdefection from truth\u201d. The great end time apostacy is \u201cdefection from truth\u201d. What is truth (Truth)?\u201cAll Thy commandments are Truth.\u201d (Ps. 119:151) \u201cThy Law is Truth.\u201d (Ps. 119:142)\u201cThy Word is Truth\u201d according to Jesus (Jn. 17:17), and Jesus is \u201cthe Way, the Truth, and the Life \u201c. (Jn. 14:6) Jesus also prayed for us saying, \u201cSanctify them by Thy Truth; Thy Word is Truth.\u201d We, God\u2019s people, are to be set apart from the world by \u201cpracticing\u201d the Word of God, the Law, the Commandments, the Word of God, and Jesus! Using the substitution principle, we can define defection from Truth as a defection from God\u2019s Commandments, His Law, His Word, and from Jesus. This should be easy to understand since present day Christian teaching has God\u2019s Truth, His Law, His Word, and His Commandments as all put to death by Jesus Christ at the cross; of course, Jesus had to die since He is Truth also! Today\u2019s Christianity, for the most part, worships ANOTHER resurrected Jesus, not the one of the NT! Can God\u2019s Truth die\u2026or is it forever? There are scriptures that say \u201cNo\u201d, despite claims of portions of God\u2019sWord passing away. In case one is not convinced, let\u2019s look at two NT examples: The first is the murder of Stephen, called the first martyr of \u201cthe Church\u201d, and the second is when Paul returns to Jerusalem after his third missionary journey to keep God\u2019s Festival of Leviticus 23:15-21, Shavuot, or what we call Pentecost. Why was Stephen put to death? What does Scripture say?\u201cAnd yet they were unable to cope with the wisdom and the Spirit with which he [Stephen] was speaking. Then they secretly induced men to say, \u2018We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God.\u2019 And they stirred up the people, and the elders and the scribes, and they came upon him and dragged him away, and brought him before the council [the Sanhedrin].\u201d\u201cAnd they put forth FALSE witnesses who said, \u2018This man incessently speaks against this holy place, and the Law [the Law of Moses- but they were FALSE witnesses, meaning he did NOT speak against EITHER the holy place OR against Moses]; for we have heard him say that this Jesus will destroy this place and altar the customs which Moses handed down to us [but they were FALSE witnesses- so Stephen never spoke against the customs MOSES handed down to them]'\u201d. (Acts 6:10-14) Please note: \u201cthe Church\u201d definitely believes the customs Moses handed down were changed, but if that were true, wouldn\u2019t the FALSE witnesses actually be TRUE witnesses? Well? Let God be true and every man a liar! What was it they thought Moses had taught them, the customs, but which he never really did? It was the Jewish Oral Law which Jesus referenced in Mark 7:9 where He referred to it saying, \u201cYou nicely set aside the commandment of God in order to keep your tradition\u201d! They had their own \u201ctraditions\u201d which superceded God\u2019s commandments, you know, sort of like how the Catholic church has its own traditions that are contrary to the Word of God, or how the Protestant Churches do the same. (See Romans 10:3 where Paul speaks of the same.) The second use of \u201capostasia\u201d is found in Acts 21 and it actually gives us God\u2019s definition of \u201capostacy\u201d, if one will accept it! God loves to hide things in plain sight!\u201cAnd when we [Paul and Luke, and others] had come to Jerusalem, the bretheren received us gladly. And now the following day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present. And after he had greeted them, he begun to relate one by one the things God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.\u201d\u201cAnd when they heard it they begn glorifying God; and they [the elders] said to him, \u2018You see brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed, AND THEY ARE ALL ZEALOUS FOR THE LAW [the Truth!]; and they have been told about you that you are teachinig all the Jews among the Gentiles to forsake Moses [to GRK- \u201capostacize\u201d Moses], telling them not to circumcise their children nor to walk according tot he customs.\u201d (Acts 21:17-21) Note that the charges leveled against Paul are the same ones which Paul consented unto regarding the death of Stephen. It was about \u201cthe customs\u201d of Moses. Paul did explain circumcision without a circumcised heart will not get you salvation before God. They didn\u2019t much like that one, did they? God wants both, but especially the spiritual one! But that was one \u201ccustom\u201d of Moses Paul taught against, the NT records these debates, but Moses never taught that! Moses said, \u201cCircumcise therefore your heart and stiffen your neck no more.\u201d (Deut. 10:16) And, \u201cYet to this day the LORD has not given you a heart to know, or eyes to see, nor ears to hear.\u201d (Deut 29:4) Moses clearly taught God wanted a circumcised heart so they could understand God\u201ds instructions! The Acts passage lets us know James, the brother of Jesus, and the elders were rejoicing that so many of their Judean brothers were finally living out the Mosaic Law the way God intended it to be lived, zealously! There is no hint of the idea that following the Mosaic Law is to be avoided here, is there? Also, James and the elders reported to Paul that some of their Judean brothers had heard Paul was teaching the Gentiles and those in the Diaspora to \u201capostacize\u201d the teachings of Moses. Stephen wans\u2019t guilty of this and neither was Paul! , What are the teachings of Moses? They are the Law, the Commandments and the Word of God; they are \u201cthe Truth\u201d, according to God\u2019s definition! I did not say it! God did! You can find it in your own Bible! God plainly defines the great end time apostacy as a departure from the Law of Moses! Jesus accused the Jews of not even knowing what Moses said and informed them Moses would be testifying against them in the judgment. (Jn. 5:45-47) Has \u201cthe Church\u201d forsaken, apostacized Moses in this day? You bet! This doctrine infiltrated the American church through the institutions of higher learning in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and has spread from there. It has been opposed by the RCC heirarchy from the 3rd century on, since if one puts God\u2019s Word as the highest spiritual authority then the RCC heirachy is not the highest authority but rather is to be in submission to God\u2019s Holy Word. Rome does not willingly abandon its power to claim to speak for God even for God Himself! I think the NT makes a great case for the great end time apostacy to be related to God\u2019s shepherds teaching and encouraging His people to \u201cpractice lawlessness\u201d by removing the standard of holiness God established through Moses and confirmed in Jesus Christ. Thisis why both jeremiah (23) and Ezekiel (34) speak of how the LORD is going to judge His shepherds uppn His return for the way they have destroyed His Word and people! One last point with respect to the OT: 1) Nearly the very last words of the last book written there, Milachi 4:4, are, \u201cRemember the the Law of Moses My servant, even the statutes, and ordinances, which I commanded him in Horeb for ALL of Israel.\u201d Paul says we have been grafted into Israel therefore this verse is for us, as Israel! (Romans 11:19-24 and Eph. 2:11-13) Everyone has a choice: one can begin to read Scripture as God had it written, a book of instruction on how He expects His family to live with one another, or one can decide to pick and choose favoite passages that seemto support our doctrine and the theologians, the leaders are nearly always wrong(!), and twist the scriptures to live according to the standard they want to live by in this life. We will all give an account of the things done in our body. However, if you love God, you will keep His Commandments, His Law, His Word, Jesus and Truth! If you want to know why today\u2019s \u201cChurch\u201d is dying, it is because it has perverted Gods\u2019 Truth, which only brings death! God\u2019s Word is bread and sustains life. Departing from life, means death!

Lorelei Vision \\nIt\u2019s not a judgment, it\u2019s the Truth! I knew a \u201cChristian\u201d woman who gossiped about everyone, sometimes Falsely. When Biblical Scripture was pointed out to this woman, admonishing her \u201csin\u201d, what did she do? She emphatically stated that she \u201cwould not change\u201d! She continued to speak with \u201cforked tongue\u201d until she died, even though her gossiping actually harmed other people. Many religious people hate it when their sin is pointed out, they hate being shown their hypocrisy. That is why so many non-believers hate Christians \u2013 our sheer hypocrisy of \u201cdo as I say, not as I do\u201d is deceitful, insincere, pretension and off-putting. Those that truly follow God and His word have no problem being told the Truth about themselves. If the chastisement is True, we will heed the admonishment and act accordingly. Just because we are \u201csaved\u201d doesn\u2019t mean we are to go out in the world with a chip on our shoulder, we are to walk a higher path and be an example to others. If you can\u2019t handle the Truth, then maybe you need to revisit your walk with God\u2026 Heather \\nHi Lorelei! Thanks for the honest feedback. Yes, you are right, some Christians set very bad examples, and their words are only a reflection of what is in their heart. Their relationship with the Savior needs much work! I\u2019ve been Born Again Christian for about 30+ years and in the first 10 years you would have never known it\u2026drinking and everything else under the sun. My \u2018communication\u2019 with Jesus was non existent, therefore my lifestyle reflected the world, nor Christ. After much heartache, I began a dialogue with Jesus, put my trust In Him, etc and I haven\u2019t been the same since. All we can do is pray for those who have wondered away. My guess is that this Christian woman dId not fully commit her life to Jesus. The New Testement (Bible) tells us exactly what God expects from us\u2026to be like Christ! God bless, and Marantha Lorelei Vision \\nThere is much Truth to your comment, Jim. How many Christians actually walk the walk?

In fact, during the country\u2019s entire history, only four popes had decided not to avoid the United States during their world tours. Heck, this country had spent the vast majority of its time inciting wars and expanding its empire so I would hardly describe it as being Christian. At best, it would more resemble the Roman empire, and even that characterization would be too kind. Make no mistake. Wealth, power and control have always reigned in the country, and not the Creator.

Some examples that come to mind would be the Babylonian Empire, the Soviets, Ottomans, the Byzantines, Romans, etc. Yes, we did change the course of countries\u2019 directions, but we are not the central authority, as the ones I mentioned. Mexico IS a sovereign nation, as are the other countries you listed. Others were occupied by tyrants, like Saddam Hussein, for example. Columbia was involved in the drug trade that was affecting the US. We could go on, but I think you get my drift. As for Germany, Japan, and South Korea, they want us there.

Gay Veteran \\n\u201c\u2026This is such a tragedy, because during my decades of research into these things I have found that logic and reason should always point people toward the Christian faith and not away from it. There is an absolutely gigantic   for Christianity out there, but unfortunately most people don\u2019t know about it or they are not interested in considering it\u2026.\u201d \\nevery religion on the planet think their religion is THE religion! \\nbtw, why does \u201cgod\u201d never regenerate the limbs of amputees? it that happened then talk about \u201can absolutely gigantic   for Christianity out there\u201d Grillsgt. \\nA passage in Matthew touches on that thought\u2026\u201cThe Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus and tested him by asking him to show them a sign from heaven. \\n2 He replied, \u201cWhen evening comes, you say, \u2018It will be fair weather, for the sky is red,\u2019 3 and in the morning, \u2018Today it will be stormy, for the sky is red and overcast.\u2019 You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times.[a] 4 A wicked and adulterous generation looks for a sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah.\u201d Jesus then left them and went away.

Because the beat goes on and on and never stops. Save for a few. DJohn1 \\nThe churches need to do some things. One of which is to establish what is fact and what is fiction. If I look at the material world then there are physical laws by which everything on this planet operates. One of those laws is the operation of gravity and the surface tension of water. It is mentioned in the BIble about Jesus walking on water and Peter attempting to do so. Without Jesus helping he could not walk on water. According to Jesus his faith was to weak. In the natural order of things Peter should drown when he attempts to walk on water. No representative of any religion that I know of can duplicate Jesus in walking on water. And there lies the problem. We live in the natural order of things. We live in the natural world with a set system of physical laws that none of us can break as Jesus could at will. Miracles are in the realm of the supernatural rather than the realm of the natural order of things. Yet many Christians have experienced Miracles of one kind or another. Just do not depend on Miracles. They are at the whim of our God and Creator. He decides what happens not us. I have felt the power of God in the form of the Holy Spirit before. Someone I was spiritually attached to confirmed this for me without prompting of any kind and 5,000 miles approximately between me and that person when I was 21. Yet none of this is taught anywhere that I know of. It is there. It is real. But it is not reproductable. So science has a huge problem attempting to reproduce anything that is talked extensively about in the New Testament. To them it is fable. It is myth without substance. And that basically in the form of Humanism is taught in the schools. So yes the old time religion of the churches is obsolete in not addressing the problem of science and natural laws of the universe. The young people are quick to pick up on this lack. They dismiss the Holy Spirit as a force. People like me have experienced it first hand and know different. I don\u2019t have all the answers. If Jesus ever chose me for anything I would be totally surprised. I have met him only second hand in the Bible. As just about everyone in this time has done. IF Jesus as a God and as an immortal being came back, the forces of this world would attempt to kill him again. Those forces of this world do not represent all of humanity and they certainly do not represent me. Jesus gave many lessons in 3 years of ministry on this planet. One of which was Peter attempting to walk on water. Another concerning Peter was in his fear of crucifixion he denied Christ. The lesson is you do not know what you might do under the right kind of pressures. Jesus taught many things. One was the limits we put on ourselves. I have no clue to the answers that science information has come up with. Is the universe 13.5 billion years old. Are galaxies as common as a grains of sand on deserts? Is the Universe so large it is difficult to even conceive how large it is? The universe as we see it through our telescopes is so incredibly large as to be above the ability of most people to even understand. AS for me and mine, we worship the God of creation, the alpha and omega, the beginning of it all and the end of it all and are loyal to both God and his son, Jesus. When will Jesus come back? Only God knows. john \\n\u201cYet many Christians have experienced Miracles of one kind or another. Just do not depend on Miracles. They are at the whim of our God and Creator. He decides what happens not us.\u201d \\nSo you are saying that god decides if a child will be abused? Is that really OK with you from your own logistical standpoint? DJohn1 \\nI am saying that God created it all. And no I am not all right with a lot of things allowed in this creation. But I wasn\u2019t there when it was created and had no say one way or another in how it was created. I also do not have the big picture as God sees it. God is not human. God is also immortal and all powerful in this universe. \\nLook around you. This world is full of violent interactions. Yet good Christians once took out the predators. The result was a far worse disaster. The herds increased too fast and starvation loomed. All because we upset the balance of nature. Is a child being abused part of God\u2019s creation or something else? Something wicked this way comes. God appears to have an opposite number in the Father of all Lies, Satan. This is documented fairly well in Job, the oldest book of the Bible. \\nWhen, not if, we succeed in finding life on another planet, will it follow the patterns of this world? The answer to that is it is likely. The reality of this world is it is a sick, violent place, and Christians are killed every day in other areas of the world. I do not agree with a lot of the reality I see out there. But only God can change it. To give him the glory is also to give him the responsibility. So in answer to your question ultimately the responsibility of this world lies on God\u2019s shoulders. john \\n\u201cSo in answer to your question ultimately the responsibility of this world lies on God\u2019s shoulders.\u201d \\nThat is exactly where you are wrong. Thinking that it is god\u2019s responsibility is why the world is the way it is. We are responsible for evil and good. We make the choice in how we behave and how we treat other people. There is no satan and no god. If you want to see god look in the mirror. If you want to see satan look in the same mirror. We are all light and dark. watchmannonthewall \\nThat\u2019s what satan told Eve: \u201cFor God knows in the day you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be LIKE God, knowing good and evil.\u201d (Gen. 3:5) \\nKnow what? Satan told the truth and you agreed. We all choose either the good or evil, but keep in mind only God, the Creator, gets to define what each term means. \\nThe problem with Adam and Eve eating from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil was that neither was yet mature enough or had the wisdom necessary to properly choose between good or evil. To overcome this deficit, mankind makes up its own definition of each. Many people are still in the same place. Those who accept God\u2019s definitions of \u201cgood and evil\u201d are further along than others! \\nThose who have chosen to obey God and follow His Word, are being taught the wisdom to properly make that choice, now. When Jesus returns and teaches Torah in Jerusalem during the Millennium (Is. 2:1-4, Micah 4:1-4), there will be a quantum leap forward in righteousness as this wisdom is taught without error, not like today.

TJAW \\nApologies for butting into this discussion, but God is not my creator, because I do not believe in him. He is not real to me, so there is no \u201cdangerous path\u201d. Of course, you will attempt to convince me otherwise, but there is no solid argument that can be made for his existence. Atheism is on the rise for a simple reason \u2013 it\u2019s better to think for yourself than blindly believe in fairy tales and exaggerated history. Paul Patriot \\nAnd you will continue in your rejection of God, and will be without excuse on judgement day. Just because he is not real to you, does not mean that he does not exist. \\nThe Bible has had its enemies like you for thousands of years, yet it has been true and unwavering in its scientific, historical and prophetic truth, so, I will trust in writings that have proven themselves for centuries ( over man\u2019s emotion and opinion and \u201cfeelings\u201d) \\nRest assured the Bible will be here and still be true long after you and I have died, and will continue to be a stumbling block to folks like you, and a source of peace, comfort and hope for folks like me. \\nGod \u201cis not real to me\u201d as an excuse to run away fro the savior that calls them to repent (of their sins) and believe in the only name under heaven in which a man can be saved\u2026Jesus. \\nNo hard feelings, I appreciate you corresponding with me. \\nHope you don\u2019t mind, still praying for you\u2026\u2026.I used to believe what you did, that\u2019s why I know where you are and how blind I was once Jesus came into my life Paul Patriot \\nHow blind I was until Jesus opened my eyes. TJAW \\nYou are hopelessly deluded. Jesus died almost 2000 years ago. Whatever happened to him back then has absolutely no correlation to your life. TJAW \\nEven if I believed in God, even if there was concrete proof that he exists, he has done NOTHING for me. He does nothing for anyone. He does not rid the world of disease, he refuses to shield the world from terrorism and evil, he lets children starve to death and families suffer. I don\u2019t need you to pray for me. I don\u2019t live in your childish fairy tale world of angels and demons and spirits. IsabellaSpeaking \\nSaying that you know that God has done \u201cnothing for anyone\u201d implies that you know everything. Many people claim God has done a lot for them, so\u2026how would you know otherwise\u2026unless you know everything? And since you know everything, why don\u2019t you rid the world of disease, shield the world from terrorism and evil, etc.? If not the whole world, then maybe one little part of it? Maybe, though, it can\u2019t be done\u2026not in this world\u2026 iris \\n(:!!! Can\u2019t argue with that one at all. As for the veracity of the Bible: historical details, archeological finds and detailed fulfillment of hundreds of prophecies, (about 300 about the Messiah, alone, almost all of which were fulfilled by Yeshua of Bethlehem, the remaining ones all have to do with the end of days and Messiah\u2019s return and reign on earth regarding the Messiah), the fact that 66 books, written 1500 years apart in some cases, by 40 authors from all walks of life, all having the same theme and going with each other, should give anyone doubting it, pause, at least. And the intricate patterning of the universe implies the opposite of random chance, not to mention the law of cause and effect. God bless! Paul Patriot \\nYou are repeating the same mantra that has been repeated by God hating folks for centuries. \\nOur founding fathers would disagree with you regarding the role of religion and faith in society, and the positive influence absolute morals has. I agree, \u201creligion\u201d can be destructive, but, a personal relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ, will only produce citizens who strive to please God in their actions, and cause fell o human beings no harm, and on the contrary, a relationship with Jesus, will prevent divorce, adultery, drug abuse, rape, robbery, murder, and entitlement attitudes. \\nAgain, it\u2019s not \u201creligion\u201d that is beneficial per say, it is a personal relationship with the Savior. Paul Patriot \\nThe \u201creligion of peace\u201d is not losing ground\u2026.somehow the pied piper of propaganda has brainwashed people to criticize Christinity due to its \u201cintolerant\u201d view of saying the Jesus is the only way to be saved from hell\u2026\u2026.yet are silent about a religious ideology in which the founders teachings are obeyed, have shown over the past 1400+ years, that \u201creligion of peace\u201d leaves a path of death, destruction and oppression wherever is goes and gains the \u201cupper house\u201d, proving to be the most intolerant religion known by modern man. \\nNo one here who criticize Christianity seem to want to speak out about Islam though\u2026\u2026. iris \\nYes, interesting, since Islam, like many religions, is based on man\u2019s perceived ability to perform enough works of righteousness, as they interpret them. The ways of man are sinking sand. We can never do enough to make it into heaven, for only God is perfect. We need the salvation provided by Jesus Christ, first, last and always. All religions are mankind trying to get to God or to become God or a god. Christianity is a relationship with God, who humbled Himself to come to us as one of us, to give His very self in our place, and took the punishment we all deserve, in order to provide the way of reconciliation to our Holy Creator. He is \u201cthe Way, the Truth and the Life\u201d. Maximus \\nI identify as a Christian. I just don\u2019t attend church. My beliefs are mine and mine alone; I have a pretty good understanding with the Lord. If other\u2019s think along the same lines, fine. If they don\u2019t, well that\u2019s fine too. \\nWhat gets me is the vilification of Christianity in modern times. I\u2019m not worried about it personally. You either stand with Him or stand alone. horse777res \\nAmerica has abandoned GOD, and GOD has abandoned America. The BIBLE says\u201dThe wicked shall be turned into hell, and nations that forget GOD.\u201d Psalm 9:17 tacoma \\nAll religions (with a few rarest exceptions) are based on the impossible. Christianity calls it miracle, other religions have other names. Miracles are impossible in the real world. It is delusion to believe they exist. \\nReligion is also about worshiping a god (or gods). The god represents the miracle. By doing this act of worship all kinds of powerful, even impossible benefits will happen. The differences between religions is one of different definitions of god, how to conduct the worship, and what kind of benefit will emerge. Only human beings of the past 10,000 years (but not earlier) do this kind of nonsense. It is the result of our powerful imagination. \\nWell the basic nonsense of worshiping gods is so great the leaders of religions were required to construct all kinds of fantastic structures and elaborate rituals to convince people to maintain belief and worship. Add to his are punishments and bloody enforcements. But why? The leaders want to keep their power over people, the age old human character. \\nMost religions offer \u2018teaching\u2019, some kind of wisdom. But teaching can certainly be offered without religion. An American Native (who treat lightning as a god) is as moral as any of the European religion without their teaching. Follower of Buddhism is at least as moral, likely much more, than followers of other major religions. But Buddhism does not have a god, and does not compel anybody to do anything. \\nBut are there gods, are they real? Of course there are gods, history of religion list thousands of gods. They are real, but only in the minds of man. A god is software; can be created, defined, killed off at will. Anybody can make a god, based on something real (like the Sun) or fantasy. This is why to make the \u2018establishment\u2019 god one needs to wrap all kinds of fantastism and protection around it, make it special. The world always have enough fools to be taken in. 90% of humans are born followers, and they love to be led or fooled. \\nIn the end, religions are just forms of sociology, politics, philosophy, mind over body. \\nThere have been great debate between science and religion. Well there are as many religions as human can create them. There is only one science, one based solely only proven facts and accurate predictions. This is why 10,000 universities of the world offer scientific education. And the modern world of great achievements is build on engineering, which in turn is built on science. Rebel w/out a Cause \\nOh my. I\u2019ve read through a lot of the comments, and I have to make a few observations. 1) I graduated from a Independent Fundamental Baptist Bible college, which was controlled by an IFB church, which in turn was easily identified as a cult. And therein lies the rub. Too many \u201cchurches\u201d are in reality \u201ccults\u201d. Following the preacher\u2019s teachings as if they\u2019re direct from God. Truth becomes warped. God\u2019s \u201cWord\u201d becomes manipulative teachings to contribute to the preacher\u2019s power and control. Don\u2019t believe me? Google the Hyles family and the First Baptist Church of Hammond Indiana, and the cesspool of corruption it entailed. Even after the demise of Dr. Hyles, the corruption went on to bring down his successor. These are the things that turn people away from Christianity. Who can you trust? What teachings can you trust to be real, and not perverted and twisted? I\u2019ve been a \u201cmember\u201d of numerous churches. Only one would I trust to be called \u201cGodly\u2019. The rest were ALL manipulative, controlling, and deceitful. What does THAT tell you about \u201corganized religion\u201d? iris \\nYes, indeed.
