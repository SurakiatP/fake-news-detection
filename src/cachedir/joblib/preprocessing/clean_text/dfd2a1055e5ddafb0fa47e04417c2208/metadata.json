But for 70 years the authorities have employed a policy of secrecy, denial and ridicule to keep the subject convert. Thus the responsibility of reporting and analyzing these contact phenomena has fallen to those called in various ways to participate. We Are the Disclosure is an embodiment of the bottom-up Disclosure process that has been underway for seven decades. Through in-depth interviews, it provides a people\u2019s history of the development of the field since the early days, and brings it up to date. Leading researchers in the field are joined by archeologists, radio hosts, a remote viewer, those engaging in direct ET contact, and several ET-human hybrids. This broad-ranging survey of the growth of this field, and our awareness of its meaning, is discussed in Part I of We Are the Disclosure by Alexis Brooks, Lyn Buchanan, Michael Cremo, Klaus Dona, Stanton Friedman, Robert Fullington, Marilyn Gewacke, Rey Hernandez, Gary Heseltine, C. B. Scott Jones, Jujuolui Kuita, Barbara Lamb, Vanessa Lamorte and Joanne Summerscales. This book provides strong evidence that Disclosure may prove to be the most important topic of our time, and that it is being driven in large part by the ETs themselves.
