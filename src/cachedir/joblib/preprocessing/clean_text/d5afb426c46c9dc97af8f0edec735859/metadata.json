[Newell admitted that customer support is where Valve most needs to improve, but made sure to highlight the changes the company has already made to its gaming distribution platform Steam:  Since the last AMA, we\u2019ve introduced refunds on Steam, we\u2019ve grown our Support staff by roughly 5x, and we\u2019ve shipped a new help site and ticketing system that makes it easier to get help. We\u2019ve also greatly reduced response times on most types of support tickets and we think we\u2019ve improved the quality of responses. We definitely don\u2019t think we\u2019re done though. We still need to further improve response times and we are continually working to improve the quality of our responses. We\u2019re also working on adding more support staff in regions around the world to offer better native language support and improve response times in various regions. He\u2019s also not entirely happy with the current state of Steam trading and wants to see it improved. When asked about the disappearance of the   \u201cflash sales\u201d from the marketplace during Steam\u2019s storewide sales throughout the year, he explained that the limited time they were available \u201cmade it difficult for many people to participate. \u201d Steam is apparently erring on the side of caution, so that \u201cusers can count on finding the best deals whenever they are able to visit the store during the sale. \u201d Steam\u2019s library increased by 40% in 2016 alone, but a huge portion of that increase was due to terribly rated shovelware titles like GASP. When asked about the increased pollution of the store by low quality titles, Newell waffled a bit. He considers handling the influx of   content more a question of organizing games so that the \u201cright\u201d titles are recommended to consumers: There\u2019s really not a singular definition of quality, and what we\u2019ve seen is that many different games appeal to different people. So we\u2019re trying to support the variety of games that people are interested in playing. We know we still have more work to do in filtering those games so the right games show up to the right customers. Will the \u201cright\u201d games include uncensored adult content? According to Newell, addressing uncensored content on the platform first requires solving two problems. First are the challenges of \u201ca completely uncurated distribution tool for developers,\u201d but perhaps even more important is a \u201ctoolset\u201d by which customers can both \u201cfind and filter content,\u201d so that your kid\u2019s front page isn\u2019t flooded with pornographic visual novels. This answer is just vague enough to offer a potential opportunity for the adult game industry. The strength of a trusted platform like Steam could open doors for content that would otherwise never become profitable enough to develop. Whether that would be good or bad for the industry at large remains to be seen, but Valve is apparently already loosening their grip a little, with titles like Ladykiller In A Bind launching on the platform uncut. On the future of Valve in the gaming industry, Newell had a lot to say. The company is focused on the promise of new technologies, rather than staying safely within the confines of their previous work: The big thing right now is broadening the range of options we have in creating experiences. We think investing in hardware will give us those options. The knuckles controller is being designed at the same time as we\u2019re designing our own VR games. Much more narrowly, some of us are thinking about some of the AI work that is being hyped right now. Simplistically we have lots of data and compute capability that looks like the kinds of areas where machine learning should work well. Personally I\u2019m looking at research in   interfaces. But while Newell ponders jacking a Steam account directly into your brain, that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ll know about it before it\u2019s ready. Many of the questions tried  \u2014   and summarily failed  \u2014   to extract information about the future of franchises like Left 4 Dead and  . When a user specifically questioned the company\u2019s   approach to development, Newell gave as clear an answer as he ever has about the way Valve as a whole likes to function. He claims that the way Valve makes decisions is \u201cway more conditional than most other companies,\u201d and that they are determined not to waste customers\u2019 time and money in the process. Because of that, they\u2019re much more likely to \u201ccancel or change stuff much later in development. \u201d He thinks that \u201ctracking [Valve\u2019s] choices would be annoying and frustrating. \u201d Interestingly, Newell stated that he had many regrets about the   franchise when asked about the games: \u201cThe issue with   for me is that I was involved in a much higher percentage of the decisions about the games, so it\u2019s hard for me to look at them as anything other than a series of things I regret. \u201d If you are involved in a game, everything ends up being a set of  . Anything in a game is a sacrifice of things not in the game. I just feel those more personally about   for a bunch of reasons. There were a variety of other questions answered. Among them: Steam will consider an option to toggle off the tray notifications. Newell confirmed the J. J. Abrams movies based in the    universe are still coming. He\u2019d like to see harsher punishments for Steam scammers. He enjoyed a visit to Amsterdam. The Valve snack bar has gotten healthier. And he\u2019s going to sign a copy of the   Lord GabeN art, for the original artist. For the full text, check out the Reddit AMA.
