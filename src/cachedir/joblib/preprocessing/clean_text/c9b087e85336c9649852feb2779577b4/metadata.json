[Boxer  \u2014   who just signed on as a client at CAA after leaving the Senate last year  \u2014   was one of several politicians and progressive leaders taking part in what the Hollywood   billed a \u201c \u201d political summit for clients and staff.  \u201cI don\u2019t think she talks down to anybody,\u201d Boxer said of Streep during a conversation with CAA agent Michael Kives, according to Deadline. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s up to people to worry about how one segment of the country thinks. What did Meryl Streep say that should be offensive to the middle of the country, that Donald Trump imitated a disabled person? Believe me, people in Middle America didn\u2019t like that one bit. \u201d During her acceptance speech at the Globes in January, Streep said that Hollywood belonged to the most \u201cvilified\u201d segment of American society in the wake of Trump\u2019s election, and criticized what she called the president\u2019s \u201cinstinct to humiliate,\u201d his \u201cdisrespect\u201d and his \u201cviolence. \u201d The speech was widely praised in Hollywood but sparked outrage among the president\u2019s supporters. While she defended Streep\u2019s speech, Boxer said it was important not to speak out politically just \u201cfor the sake of doing it. \u201d \u201cI believe in freedom of speech for every single person, whether they work in Hollywood, don\u2019t work at all, are old, young, whatever,\u201d she said, according to the Wrap. \u201cDon\u2019t do it for the sake of doing it, but if it moves your heart and you have a stage, use it. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not up to Meryl Streep to tailor our message to middle America, it\u2019s up to candidates who are running for office to tailor a message that resonates,\u201d Boxer added. CAA\u2019s \u201cTake Action Day\u201d runs all day Thursday and was also expected to include appearances by Sen. Kamala Harris ( ) Rep. Kevin McCarthy ( ) Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards and Muslim Public Affairs Council founder Salam  .   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum'"}, "time": 1742563976.6574984}
