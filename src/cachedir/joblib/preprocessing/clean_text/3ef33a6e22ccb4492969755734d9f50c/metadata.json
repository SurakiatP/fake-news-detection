The decision by China follows years of growing international and domestic pressure and gives wildlife protection advocates hope that the threatened extinction of certain elephant populations in Africa can be averted. \u201cChina\u2019s announcement is a game changer for elephant conservation,\u201d Carter Roberts, the president and chief executive of the World Wildlife Fund, said in a written statement. \u201cWith the United States also ending its domestic ivory trade earlier this year, two of the largest ivory markets have taken action that will reverberate around the world. \u201d According to some estimates, more than 100, 000 elephants have been wiped out in Africa over the past 10 years in a ruthless scramble for ivory driven by Chinese demand. Some Chinese investors call ivory \u201cwhite gold,\u201d while carvers and collectors call it the \u201corganic gemstone. \u201d Elly Pepper, a wildlife advocate with the Natural Resources Defense Council, which is based in New York, wrote that China\u2019s announcement \u201cmay be the biggest sign of hope for elephants since the current poaching crisis began. \u201d Wildlife advocates have said for years that the most important step in putting poachers out of business would be shutting down the ivory industry in China. The advocates have promoted   public campaigns to shame China and raise questions about its global responsibilities, at a time when China has been assuming a higher profile on the world stage. But the success of the new policy depends on how strictly it is enforced. Wildlife researchers estimate that 50 percent to 70 percent of all smuggled elephant ivory  \u2014   maybe even more  \u2014   ends up in China, where there are countless ivory workshops and showrooms. In the announcement, the State Council, China\u2019s cabinet, said the shutdown of the market, which includes all processing and sales, would occur in phases throughout 2017. In the first step, a designated group of legal ivory processing factories and businesses will be forced to close by March 31. The Ministry of Culture will assist in the transition of legal ivory into use in museums and other cultural sites, as well as help workers in the industry, including master carvers, find related jobs. Under the new rules, people who already own ivory products can keep them or give them as gifts, and owners can sell them at supervised auctions after getting official approval. But conservationists believe that the Chinese government is sincere in not allowing any significant domestic ivory market. \u201cIvory traffickers have just lost one of their biggest markets,\u201d said Aili Kang, the Asia executive director of the Wildlife Conservation Society. China\u2019s move is at least partly a result of negotiations at senior levels between Washington and Beijing. In 2015, when President Xi Jinping of China made a state visit to Washington, he and President Obama agreed that the two nations would impose \u201cnearly complete bans on ivory import and export\u201d and \u201ctake significant and timely steps to halt the domestic commercial trade of ivory. \u201d Those goals were reiterated this past June in Beijing during a summit meeting between the United States and China that addressed economic and strategic issues. A statement from that meeting noted that China enacted a ban on ivory imports and related products in March 2016 and that it would publish by the end of 2016 a timetable for ending its domestic commercial trade. Even with the import ban, smuggling continues as long as a domestic market exists. \u201cDemand for elephant ivory has skyrocketed in recent years, spurring poaching levels that are driving elephants towards extinction,\u201d Ms. Pepper wrote Friday. \u201cAnd ending the legal ivory trade in China  \u2014   the world\u2019s largest consumer of elephant ivory  \u2014   is critical to saving the species. \u201d Illegal ivory ends up on the legal market after being smuggled into the country, chiefly by criminal syndicates. Hong Kong has been a main transit point. Corruption and chaos in many parts of Central Africa, where the last great elephant herds roam, are fueling the trafficking. Poachers and rebel groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic, Chad and South Sudan have exploited conflicts and a breakdown in order to massacre thousands of elephants, often using the proceeds from ivory to buy more weapons. Like blood diamonds in West Africa in the late 1990s, ivory has become Africa\u2019s new conflict resource. Scientists say that for the first time in years, more elephants are being killed than born, with the population steadily decreasing. Tusks are often sold to African middlemen who pay off corrupt government officials either to look the other way or to take part in the smuggling themselves. Mombasa, Kenya, is one of the most notorious ivory ports. Iain   the founder of Save the Elephants, a wildlife advocacy group in Africa, has been working for years to turn China against the ivory trade. \u201cChina is moving from being the main problem to the main solution,\u201d he said, calling Friday\u2019s announcement \u201cthe most astonishing and wonderful piece of news. \u201d Ms. Pepper of the Natural Resources Defense Council urged other nations, including Britain, to follow China\u2019s lead, and said the United States, which has made significant progress on the issue, could do more to bolster enforcement. The question of enforcement is one that will apply to China, too, as it enacts the ban, and government actions will be closely watched by conservationists and advocates. Chinese officials often announce ambitious policies but sometimes fall short on carrying them out. This is true of many environmental protection and conservation policies. Pressure on the Chinese government over the ivory trade has come not just from international organizations. One of the most recognizable Chinese public figures, Yao Ming, the    former Houston Rockets center, has taken up wildlife conservation as his main cause and has denounced the domestic trade in elephant ivory, rhino horns and shark fins. Years ago, he lent his name to billboards in Chinese cities that showed horrific piles of tusks. He has visited Kenya and helped publish a book on the issue and appeared in a 2014 documentary, \u201cThe End of the Wild,\u201d made with the group WildAid. Grace Ge Gabriel, the Asia director for the International Fund for Animal Welfare, wrote on Friday that she was \u201coverwhelmed with joy\u201d at China\u2019s announcement. She said the legal market in China had long provided cover for the illegal market, and it had also sent \u201ca confusing message to consumers that it is O. K. to buy ivory. \u201d But the new policy, she said, \u201cdemonstrates the Chinese government\u2019s determination to save elephants. \u201d Once the Chinese market shuts down, the main international market for ivory may shift to Southeast Asia, but the demand in that region is not expected to be nearly as large as in China, which, with 1. 4 billion people, is the world\u2019s most populous nation.'"}, "time": 1742563786.758963}
