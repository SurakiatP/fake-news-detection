Amid upsets, winner after winner lashed out at the policy, pleaded for acceptance of differences in a bitterly divided time and, in the case of the cast of \u201cStranger Things,\u201d adopted the stance of political firebrands. \u201cWe will get past the lies, we will hunt monsters,\u201d said David Harbour, a cast member of that Netflix series, which won for best television drama, as the audience roared its approval. \u201cAnd when we are lost amid the hypocrisy and casual violence, we will punch some people in the face when they seek to destroy the weak and the disenfranchised and the marginalized. \u201d The political defiance dominating the night almost overshadowed the upset wins: \u201cHidden Figures\u201d picked up best film ensemble over \u201cMoonlight,\u201d and Denzel Washington, the star of \u201cFences,\u201d won best actor over Casey Affleck in \u201cManchester by the Sea. \u201d The Screen Actors Guild Awards are heavily predictive of Oscar wins, and actors make up the biggest branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which doles out those prizes next month. But in a weekend when the eyes of the world were fixed on the immigration order and widespread resistance to it, Hollywood was clearly primed to sound off. The awards, held at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, opened with Ashton Kutcher welcoming viewers and \u201ceveryone in airports that belong in my America. \u201d He added: You are a part of the fabric of who we are. And we love you, and we welcome you. \u201d The mantle was quickly picked up by the night\u2019s first winner, Julia   (best actress in a comedy series for \u201cVeep\u201d). \u201cMy father fled religious persecution in   France,\u201d Ms.   said. \u201cI\u2019m an American patriot. And I love this country, and because I love this country, I am horrified by its blemishes, and this immigrant ban is a blemish, and it is  . \u201d Mahershala Ali, who won best supporting film actor, made a heartfelt speech that touched on his experiences playing Juan in \u201cMoonlight\u201d and detailed how he bridged religious differences with his mother after he converted to Islam 17 years ago. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve learned from working on \u2018Moonlight\u2019 is, we see what happens when you persecute people,\u201d Mr. Ali said, referring to the story of a gay black boy growing up in poverty in Miami. \u201cThey fold into themselves. And what I was so grateful about in having the opportunity to play Juan was, playing a gentleman who saw a young man folding into himself as a result of the persecution of his community, and taking that opportunity to uplift him and tell him that he mattered and that he was O. K. and accept him and, uh  \u2014   I hope that we do a better job of that,\u201d he said, to applause. \u201cYou know, when we kind of get caught up in the minutiae, the details that make us all different, I think there\u2019s two ways of seeing that,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s an opportunity to see the texture of that person, the characteristics that make them unique. \u201d \u201cAnd then there\u2019s an opportunity to go to war about it, and to say that that person is different than me, and I don\u2019t like you, so let\u2019s battle,\u201d he continued. \u201cMy mother is an ordained minister. I\u2019m a Muslim. She didn\u2019t do back flips when I called her to tell her I converted 17 years ago. But I tell you now, we put things to the side, and I\u2019m able to see her, she\u2019s able to see me  \u2014   we love each other, the love has grown, and that stuff is minutiae. It\u2019s not that important. \u201d Viola Davis, who won best supporting actress for her performance in \u201cFences,\u201d stood out for not taking a jab at the ban  \u2014   because virtually every other winner did. Mr. Washington, accepting his award, called for a more empathetic society. Emma Stone, who won best actress in a feature for her performance in \u201cLa La Land,\u201d ended her speech with: \u201cThings are very inexcusable and scary and need action. I\u2019m so grateful to be part of a group of people that cares. \u201d Sarah Paulson, who won for best actress in a television   for \u201cThe People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story,\u201d urged people to donate to the American Civil Liberties Union. Lily Tomlin, given a lifetime achievement award, said, \u201cThe Doomsday Clock has been moved to     minutes before midnight. And this award came just in the nick of time. \u201d She later added: \u201cWhat sign should I make for the next march? So much to do. \u201d Bryan Cranston, winning best actor in a television movie for playing Lyndon B. Johnson in \u201cAll the Way,\u201d said he was often asked what that president would think about Mr. Trump. \u201cI honestly feel that 36 would put his arm around 45 and earnestly wish him success,\u201d Mr. Cranston said. \u201cAnd he would also whisper in his ear something he said often, as a form of encouragement and a cautionary tale: \u2018Just don\u2019t piss in the soup that all of us got to eat. \u2019\u201d And Taraji P. Henson, who starred in the night\u2019s big winner, \u201cHidden Figures,\u201d noted that that film was about unity, and she praised the   women the movie was based on for focusing on solutions. \u201cWhen we put our differences aside and we come together as a human race, we win, love wins. Every time. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563595.8233693}
