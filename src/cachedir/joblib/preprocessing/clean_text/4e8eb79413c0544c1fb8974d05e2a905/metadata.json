Warden Davenport then left the execution chamber, leaving [a correctional officer, identified only as D.F.] and the prison chaplain in the execution chamber. The chaplain walked over to Mr. Brooks, held his hand, and stepped away. Mr. Brooks\u2019 breathing became rapid and shallow. D.F. called out Mr. Brooks\u2019 name, raised his eyelids and reached behind Mr. Brooks\u2019 left arm momentarily. Mr. Brooks\u2019 eyes were closed at the end of this activity. D.F. stepped away from Mr. Brooks. Mr. Brooks\u2019 breathing further slowed. Before the curtains were closed, Mr. Brooks\u2019 left eye opened, and was still open when the execution chamber curtains were closed.\u201d\\nUsing these critical observations, federal defenders based in Montgomery, Alabama, cogently argue that:\\n[Alabama\u2019s] execution protocol uses potassium chloride, a drug that unquestionably causes an unconstitutional level of pain [.] [Alabama does] not intend to anesthetize [Ronald Smith]; rather, they intend to use a sedative with no analgesic properties to create the illusion of adequate anesthesia. [Alabama\u2019s] protocol further creates an illusion of adequate anesthesia by having an untrained corrections officer conduct a \u201cconsciousness assessment\u201d to determine whether an inmate is anesthetized prior to injection of potassium chloride, a drug that, if injected without adequate anesthesia, indisputably causes an unconstitutional level of pain.\\nBecause of the way midazolam works in the human body, it could sedate an individual to the point where he was incapable of communicating that he was in pain while doing nothing to suppress the experience of pain. Because midazolam is a sedative and not an analgesic, there is a high likelihood that an inmate who receives a high dose of midazolam would be unable to respond to the noxious stimuli that constitute the ADOC\u2019s consciousness check, but would still feel the excruciating effects of the second and third drugs.\\nIn layman\u2019s terms, what the public defenders are saying is, as human beings, if we insist on pumping caustic, corrosive drugs into other human beings, our Constitution, and specifically the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment, demands it not cause excruciating pain.\\nIn the case of lethal injection, I respectfully submit, this is an impossible burden to satisfy because (1) thankfully, exterminating human beings is hardly an exact science, and (2) corrections officers who execute in Alabama, and for that matter nationwide \u2013 whose government paychecks come with a duty to kill \u2013 are not, when it comes to administering lethal injections, the sharpest tools in the shed. See Stephanie Mencimer, \u201cState Executioners: Untrained, Incompetent, and \u2018Complete Idiots\u2019\u201d ( Mother Jones , May 7, 2014) (quoting Dr. Jay Chapman, the Oklahoma coroner who helped create the modern lethal injection protocol, who observed in The New York Times in 2007, \u201cIt never occurred to me when we set this up that we\u2019d have complete idiots administering the drugs.\u201d).\\nIn Alabama\u2019s executions, including Mr. Brooks\u2019, the critical \u201cconsciousness assessment\u201d the federal public defenders say, \u201cis performed by a corrections officer who has received no medical training, whereas anesthesiologists receive extensive training in order to assess a patient\u2019s depth of anesthesia. Not only must they graduate from college and medical school, they must follow this with four years of training before they can be certified to practice anesthesiology without supervision.\u201d\\nAnesthesiologists (the reputable ones in the U.S. at least), however, won\u2019t help Alabama, or any other state, to whitewash \u2013 using a seemingly mundane and sterile-looking medical procedure \u2013 the violent torture that lethal injection is. As Dr. J. Jeffrey Andrews, Secretary of The American Board of Anesthesiology wrote in May of 2014:\\n\u201c[We] should never confuse the death chamber with the operating room, lethal doses of execution drugs with anesthetic drugs, or the executioner with the anesthesiologist. Physicians should not be expected to act in ways that violate the ethics of medical practice, even if these acts are legal. Anesthesiologists are healers, not executioners.\u201d\\nFurthermore, as the federal defenders in Alabama highlight, even if anesthesiologists did violate their professional code of ethics and participate in the ignominy of public executions (and specifically, the grim but oh so important \u201cconsciousness assessment\u201d):\\n\u201c[A]nesthesiologists do not take such action based solely on a manual assessment, they also rely on the use of devices that monitor vital signs. The events of Christopher Brooks\u2019 execution indicate that Defendants\u2019 crude assessment conducted by an individual with no medical training creates a substantial risk of pain in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Mr. Brooks\u2019 left eye opened after the consciousness assessment and assuming they even noticed, no one from the ADOC took any action.\u201d\\nThe late Dr. Jack Kevorkian, nicknamed \u201cDr. Death,\u201d was once, according to his New York Times obituary, called \u201ca reckless instrument of death\u201d who \u201cposes a great threat to the public.\u201d But, compared to corrections officers on the execution squad in Alabama, at least when Kevorkian sent people to their deaths, he had some medical training and whatever their efficacy, he used machines.\\nIn a 1958 paper Kevorkian once authored called, \u201cCapital Punishment or Capital Gain?,\u201d Quote: :\\n\u201cMost of us are well aware that the ultimate \u2018laboratory\u2019 for testing every medical fact, concept or device is man himself \u2026. In this logical and proper sequence of trial, the human subject at the end, the \u2018 guinea pig ,\u2019 is and always will be, the most difficult link to procure \u2026. Viewing the problem purely realistically, capital punishment as it exists today, offers an unrivaled opportunity [.]\u201d (emphasis added)\\nIt would appear the State of Alabama agrees.\\n Stephen Cooper is a former D.C. public defender who worked as an assistant federal public defender in Alabama between 2012 and 2015.
