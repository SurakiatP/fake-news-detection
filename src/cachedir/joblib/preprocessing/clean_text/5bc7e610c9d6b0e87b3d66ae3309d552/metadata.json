[\u201cThey are getting away with murder,\u201d Trump said about drug companies at a press conference Wednesday. \u201cPharma has a lot of lobbyists and a lot of power and there is very little bidding on drugs. We\u2019re the largest buyer of drugs in the world and yet we don\u2019t bid properly and we\u2019re going to start bidding and we\u2019re going to save billions of dollars over a period of time. \u201d  \u201cThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index fell 2. 6 percent at 11:28 a. m. in New York, and the Standard  Poor\u2019s 500 Pharmaceuticals, Biotechnology  Life Sciences Index was down 1. 7 percent,\u201d Bloomberg reports. Trump also noted many drug manufacturers have relocated their legal addresses overseas to save on taxes, a situation he says he plans to address. \u201cWe have to get our drug industry coming back,\u201d Trump said. \u201cOur drug industry has been disastrous. They\u2019re leaving left and right. They supply our drugs but they don\u2019t make them here, to a large extent. \u201d Trump added he has plans for similar actions in other industries.'"}, "time": 1742563131.3803573}
