Gives her migraines? \\nFree speech and freedom of the press. \\nAnd here\u2019s why: people might just say what they think about her. And\u2026.it\u2019s not good! \\n*gasp!* \\nDespite the team effort of the Clintons and CNN to censor any story line that cast Hillary in a negative light, well-known and informed individuals are standing up and speaking out. \\nMSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews is the latest to do so. \\nAccording to Breitbart : \\nThursday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cHardball,\u201d host Chris Matthews said, it\u2019s the Clintons\u2019 \u201cpattern\u201d to raise money \u201chand over fist\u201d using the White House like a \u201cMotel 6\u201d and that will not change if Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton wins in November\u2026 \\n\u2026\u201cYou know what I think? I\u2019m going to be more judgmental than Beth who\u2019s a straight reporter. I\u2019ll make a judgment. Every time I watch a politician engage in a certain pattern of behavior before they go to the White House, they continue to engage in that pattern afterwards. People don\u2019t change because we swear them into the White House. They become that person big-time. And the Clintons were raising money like this hand over hand, hand over fist, back in 1996, using\u2014we called it Motel 6. They were hoarding them in, pulling them in by train loads of contributors and then letting them sit in the Lincoln bedroom for a while and charging them by the hour. You can still vote for Hillary Clinton, but remember, you\u2019re getting this as part of the package, because that\u2019s been their pattern.\u201d \\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t change because we swear them into the White House.\u201d \\nLet that sink in for just a moment. \\nThe Clintons will not shut down the Clinton Foundation; they will not stop using White House bedrooms as a Motel 6; they will not stop the horrific behavior they are best known for. \\nC, after all, stands for corruption, conspiracy, and Clinton. \\nThe Clintons have never been serving for the public good but for the Clinton good. \\nIf the Clintons have their way, C will stand for censorship soon.'"}, "time": 1742564360.5235298}
