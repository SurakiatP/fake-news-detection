[BBC News] \u2022 If you make it a point to start your day with us at the Morning Briefing, we imagine you\u2019re already aware of the power of following a morning routine. It cuts down on decision fatigue and can help you be more productive through the day. \u2022 In 1997, The Times looked at the   rituals of successful figures. We found they wake very early, exercise and consume a lot of news. \u2022 This month, we\u2019ll be discussing what practices work best. Join the conversation by emailing us with a few sentences about your own routine. On Thursday, we\u2019ll publish some of the best tips. \u2022 Recipe of the day: Try a   pasta dinner with butter, sage and Parmesan. \u2022 A writer in France who was praised as an authentic voice of the immigrant youth experience has been revealed as the   author of hateful and obscene Twitter posts. \u2022 Helene Cooper, who grew up in Liberia, tells the story of how women there upended centuries of male rule in 2005 to deliver Africa\u2019s first female president. \u2022 In memoriam: Nicholas Mosley, a British novelist and biographer who wrote unsparingly of his father, the fascist leader Sir Oswald Mosley, has died at 93.

On Feb. 22, The Washington Post added a new slogan beneath its nameplate  \u2014   \u201cDemocracy Dies in Darkness. \u201d The motto was not, The Post said, a response to President Trump\u2019s attacks on the news media, which he has called \u201cthe enemy of the people. \u201d Executives at The Post had planned on a slogan long before Mr. Trump even became the Republican presidential nominee. Their criteria was a phrase that \u201cmust be memorable and may be slightly uncomfortable for us at first. \u201d The newspaper acknowledged that the motto was \u201cdramatic\u201d and had become fodder for comics (Slate made a list of \u201c15 Metal Albums Whose Titles Are Less Dark Than The Washington Post\u2019s New Motto\u201d). The Columbia Journalism Review pointed out that slogans have been a tradition in American newspapers since the 16th century. Consider such classics as \u201cDaily Diary of the American Dream\u201d (The Wall Street Journal) or \u201cIf You Don\u2019t Want It Printed, Don\u2019t Let It Happen\u201d (The Aspen Daily News in Colorado).
