[University President John Jenkins announced the decision to host Pence as the speaker at this year\u2019s graduation event in a press release. Jenkins stated that it \u201cis fitting that in the 175th year of our founding on Indiana soil that Notre Dame recognize a native son who served our state and now the nation with quiet earnestness, moral conviction and a dedication to the common good characteristic of true statesmen. \u201d  Although there have been no calls to disinvite Vice President Pence, students at the University of Notre Dame have been expressing their concern over the decision to offer him the role of commencement speaker. The university\u2019s College Democrats organization expressed their concern over Pence\u2019s stances on immigration, abortion, and healthcare, suggesting that his values contradict those of what the group would consider an appropriate commencement speaker. \u201cVice President Pence has demonstrated this \u2018quiet earnestness\u2019 and \u2018moral conviction\u2019 on numerous other occasions: when he refused to allow Syrian refugees, fleeing from violence and terrorism, to find refuge in our state when he limited a woman\u2019s right to control her own body by slashing access to women\u2019s healthcare or when he limited needle exchange programs that could have prevented the worst HIV outbreak Indiana has ever seen,\u201d the College Democrats of Notre Dame wrote in a statement that appeared on their Facebook page. \u201cThe new Administration has shown a basic disregard for the fundamental rights of so many communities. We are saddened that Fr. Jenkins would invite Vice President Pence to serve as an ambassador of that Administration, as he receives an honorary degree on a stage shared by members of the very communities he marginalizes,\u201d the statement adds. Senior Film, Television, and Theatre major Elizabeth Hynes expressed her criticism of the decision in a satirical video that she uploaded to YouTube. \u201cJust as many people were opposed to the invitation of President Obama in 2008, I\u2019m opposed to the university inviting Pence today,\u201d Hynes claims. \u201cThe invitation of a man who, during his tenure as governor, made decisions that harmed the quality of life for many marginalized groups (e. g. refugees, drug users from lower socioeconomic levels, members of the LGBT community, and women) runs counter to the Catholic values of inclusion that both Pence and our university claim to perpetuate. Additionally, Pence\u2019s complicity in an administration that is hostile towards  \u2014   among many other groups  \u2014   DACA students and their   families makes him a threat to many of our peers\u2019 ways of life. \u201d Hynes adds that she plans to protest Pence\u2019s commencement address, but claims that she holds no hostilities towards the university. \u201cBut I do plan to protest, which won\u2019t invalidate any of the gratitude I feel towards Notre Dame and everyone that commencement weekend celebrates. My parents and this university have taught me to stand up for what I believe is right, so remaining silent would be a betrayal to those lessons. \u201d Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about education and social justice for Breitbart News.
