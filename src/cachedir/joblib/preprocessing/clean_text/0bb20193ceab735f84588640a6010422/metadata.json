A smiley face connotes an important person. If the professor says, \u201cMake sure you know this,\u201d she uses an asterisk. A triangular button signals a video clip played in class. Later, she will organize the notes, write a video summary and check uncertainties against the textbook or with the professor. For \u201cIntroduction to Classical Mythology,\u201d she\u2019ll even alphabetize a list of Greek gods and goddesses. Then, a few days before the exam, she puts it all up for sale. Since last fall, when she uploaded her macroeconomics notes onto Flashnotes. com to pay for a birthday gift for her mother, Ms. Gayle has sold more than 500 copies of the study guides that she\u2019s put together for her courses, made over $3, 285 and tapped into a growing, if controversial, online marketplace. In describing her approach, Ms. Gayle, a human resources major with a 3. 8   average, sounds aggressive in the best way. \u201cI sit in the front row center for every single class, whether I am selling notes or not,\u201d she says. \u201cFor me it is a matter of paying attention, being   and,\u201d if something is unclear, \u201ctaking the initiative to go out and find the answer. \u201d Her study guides are rated five stars by users. While borrowing, bartering and selling class notes is nothing new, the online market is just getting organized.   sites matching note sellers and buyers have come and gone in recent years as students who started them graduate. NerdyNotes at Stony Brook University is surviving the graduation of a founder, but bigger players are arriving. Flashnotes started up last fall on five campuses  \u2014   Kent State, Ohio State, Florida State, Rutgers and University of Maryland  \u2014   with 30, 000 registered users. There are now about 100, 000 at 100 campuses, and the company just bought   a Florida State  . The sites let student sellers set prices for notes (average is $9) but take a cut. Flashnotes gets 30 percent NerdyNotes takes 50. The marketplace has annoyed some professors, who bar their students from buying or selling notes. In 2010, California State University banned students on its 23 campuses from using NoteUtopia. com (since bought by Flashnotes) citing a   state education code prohibiting the selling of class notes for commercial purposes. Some argue that lectures are professors\u2019 intellectual property, including notes recording their ideas others warn that notes are a student\u2019s interpretation of a class. Some say that selling them promotes laziness by enticing students to skip lectures. Still others encourage it. \u201cI want them to use any resource they can to do well on my tests,\u201d says Lora Holcombe, an economics professor at Florida State. \u201cIt\u2019s not like with the notes you sleep on them and they\u2019ll go into your head. You have to do some heavy studying. \u201d Michael Matousek, who graduated from Kent State in 2010, dreamed up Flashnotes during a statistics class in his senior year. He had switched majors twice so was taking a required class that covered topics he had previously studied. Students found the professor confusing, but Mr. Matousek \u201cknew how they were confused. \u201d After classmates repeatedly sought his help, he compiled and sold his notes to a friend. Soon others wanted copies, so Mr. Matousek collected $10 for each emailed copy, netting more than $1, 000 for the semester. The experience showed him the power of peer education  \u2014   and not necessarily led by brainiacs. \u201cThe 4. 0 kids, they can\u2019t explain,\u201d he says. \u201cThe 3. 5, the 3. 6 kids understand what it takes to learn something. \u201d Mr. Matousek graduated with a 3. 67 G. P. A. and now heads a staff of 22 at Flashnotes headquarters in Faneuil Hall in Boston. The demand is not surprising. \u201cStudents are notoriously poor \u201d says Kenneth Kiewra, professor of educational psychology at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln. They tend to record only a third of the important lecture points. What makes notes great? \u201cCompleteness,\u201d Dr. Kiewra says. Research shows that having detailed, comprehensive notes raises test performance. In his   1985 study, published in Human Learning, Dr. Kiewra randomly assigned 100 students to one of seven groups.   hours after a lecture, the groups had 25 minutes to review before a test. Each group was assigned a learning method: Take your own notes and review (1) your notes, (2) your notes as well as instructor notes, (3) without any notes. Don\u2019t take notes but review (1) instructor notes, (2) without any notes. Skip the lecture but review (1) instructor notes, (2) without any notes. Groups that reviewed instructor notes performed best. \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter so much what you did during the lecture,\u201d Dr. Kiewra explains. \u201cIt mattered what notes you had. \u201d Even those who didn\u2019t attend the lecture but reviewed instructor notes did better than those who attended and \u201creviewed their own crummy notes. \u201d He concludes: \u201cThe real value of   is not so much in the taking as in the having. \u201d Getting down details along with main points is easier said than done. Average lecture speed is 100 to 125 words a minute, but college students listening to a lecture write 22 words a minute by hand they type just 33 words a minute. In his latest research Dr. Kiewra has found that when the professor pauses three times to let students catch up and fill in missing information, they have more \u201coriginal, additional and total notes\u201d than those who waited to revise immediately after a lecture. If a student fails to note a particular point, Dr. Kiewra says, there is only a 5 percent chance of recalling it later. Videotaped lectures help. When students viewed a video twice, they recorded 53 percent of the details, up from 38 percent, Dr. Kiewra says. Watching three times raised it to 60 percent. Memory is a weak tool, but thinking about the information  \u2014   paraphrasing rather than writing everything verbatim  \u2014   improves retention, according to a series of studies at Princeton, published last April in Psychological Science. Students who took notes by hand rather than laptop wrote less but performed better. Laptop users tended to merely transcribe a lecture \u201crather than processing and reframing it in their own words\u201d they scored strikingly lower on conceptual tests. Alexandra E. Hadley, a Boston College junior who has posted 29 different offerings on Flashnotes in the last year, uses paper for small discussion classes and a laptop for lectures. An English and communications major, she says she thinks hard about points the professor stresses. \u201cI try to be very present in all of my classes,\u201d she says. \u201cThat is key  \u2014   focusing on what I am doing. \u201d That means considering points as you take notes and connecting new ideas with information from earlier lectures. \u201cI was taking notes in my research methods class and we were talking about pop culture,\u201d she says. \u201cWe touched on two theories, but it reminded me of another one, so I threw that in my notes. \u201d Umar Zaidi, a Stony Brook senior from Queens   in political science and sociology, prefers to grab a seat near a power outlet and tap away. \u201cWhen you are typing you can look at your professor,\u201d he says. He reads over the syllabus before class, \u201cso when the professor mentions something that rings a bell, I type it up. \u201d While typing he organizes material into sections with main ideas, bullet points and asterisks. Mr. Zaidi uploaded a semester\u2019s worth of lecture notes for \u201cUrban Politics,\u201d an   course, when NerdyNotes started up last spring. Sales, at $10 a packet, were slow at first. (Biology notes are the most in demand on campus.) Classmates didn\u2019t take notes, he says, because they thought political science was a breeze  \u2014   until the midterm. After, he netted $150. \u201cIf they\u2019re too lazy to make notes,\u201d he says, \u201cthen I\u2019ll make notes and take advantage. \u201d But Mr. Zaidi won\u2019t sell the study guides he makes for himself. One doesn\u2019t want to make it too easy for classmates. Indeed, some campuses are not good   territory because students don\u2019t want to help competitors. In other words, at Flashnotes, Mr. Matousek says, \u201cwe\u2019re not putting a huge emphasis on Harvard. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562870.6091998}
