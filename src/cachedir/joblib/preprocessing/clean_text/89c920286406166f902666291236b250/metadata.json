Walsh just said he is going to grab his musket if Trump doesn\\'t win the 2016 presidential election. And yes, he invited others to join him. \\nCNN\\'s Jake Tapper saw the tweet and like most of us, he wanted Walsh to clarify his comments: @WalshFreedom what exactly does that mean? \u2014 Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) October 26, 2016 \\nWalsh responded: @jaketapper It means protesting. Participating in acts of civil disobedience. Doing what it takes to get our country back. \u2014 Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 26, 2016 \\nOthers weighed in, too: \u2014 Brian Fagioli (@brianfagioli) October 26, 2016 @walshfreedom @jaketapper Doing what it takes to get your country back? It\u2019s called voting. Never heard it referred to as \u201cmusketing\u201d \u2014 John Blanco (@ZaBlanc) October 26, 2016 I don\\'t think @WalshFreedom understands the meaning of \"civil disobedience.\" pic.twitter.com/qqdX6WDbP9 \u2014 John Haltiwanger (@jchaltiwanger) October 26, 2016 \\nBut one commenter said, \u201cI think you got a good portion of gun owners that are with you. But seriously a musket. You might want to update your arsenal.\u201d '"}, "time": 1742561857.9372265}
