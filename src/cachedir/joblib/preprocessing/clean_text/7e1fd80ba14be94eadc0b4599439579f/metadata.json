{"duration": 0.15012598037719727, "input_args": {"text": "'The uniquely uncivil presidential campaign is about to produce one of the biggest civic gatherings in decades: For 90 minutes on Monday night, a polarized nation will pause to watch the first    encounter between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump. The total audience, network executives and political strategists say, could be as high as 100 million viewers  \u2014   Super Bowl territory. That would surpass the 80 million who watched Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan in 1980, the record for a presidential debate, and rank among television benchmarks like the finales of \u201cMASH\u201d and \u201cCheers. \u201d Not all viewers will watch from their living rooms. At the Dreamland Theater in tiny Nantucket, Mass. so many are expected for a   party that the town assigned a police officer to stand watch in case of rowdiness. In Paris, many of those abroad for Fashion Week are setting     alarms so they can watch the debate live  \u2014   at 3 a. m. local time. \u201cI need to feel like I\u2019m part of this,\u201d said Laura Brown, InStyle\u2019s editor in chief. And in Richardson, Tex. the Alamo Drafthouse had to switch to a bigger room after overwhelming interest in a screening with refreshments like a \u201cbuild a wall around it\u201d taco salad. Mass experiences  \u2014   built around news events like the moon landing, and pop culture moments for older generations like the \u201cWho shot J. R. ?\u201d episode of \u201cDallas\u201d  \u2014   are rare in an age of fragmented media and the drift toward partisan outlets, where viewers can effectively choose their own news. But tight polls and curiosity about the unconventional Mr. Trump are luring viewers. In a New York   News poll this month, 83 percent of registered voters said they were very or somewhat likely to watch on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s a throwback to a phenomenon that has essentially disappeared in the era of digital media,\u201d said Andrew Heyward, a former president of CBS News. \u201cThis is Americans gathering around the electronic hearth. \u201d Advertisers, including Audi cars and Tecate beer, are taking advantage, introducing   commercials in the kind of   marketing usually reserved for events like the Super Bowl. Although the debate will air without commercials, cable and broadcast channels have sold millions of dollars\u2019 worth of ads for programming before and afterward. Television networks and online streaming sites, including Facebook and Twitter, will carry the same feed on Monday, showing a spare debate stage at Hofstra University, on Long Island, a format that predates the blaring graphics and   sets that now dominate television news. Still, even if a large portion of the country is watching, what Americans see may be as much about their beliefs and preferred news outlets as what transpires onstage. About 8 percent of registered voters remain undecided, according to the New York   News poll, a thin if crucial sliver of the electorate. And after Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump conclude on Monday, viewers are likely to return to their ideological silos, absorbing instant analysis from   anchors on MSNBC or commentators at   outlets like Breitbart News. The debate itself will be subject to instant,    interpretation on social media. \u201cRegardless of where you\u2019re watching, whether it\u2019s Facebook Live or NBC or Fox News, there will be a moment where we all witness it,\u201d said Charles L. Ponce de Leon, author of \u201cThat\u2019s the Way It Is,\u201d a history of television news. \u201cBut that moment will quickly crumble when all the instant analysis and opining comes into play. \u201d The event\u2019s impact is unlikely to rival that of, say, 1960, when John F. Kennedy\u2019s smooth performance in the first televised debate helped sway voters against his opponent, Richard Nixon. That debate aired without commentary  \u2014   or graphics and captions on the screen. \u201cJournalists were of the opinion they should wait and ruminate and think about what went down, and then, a day or a week later, talk about it,\u201d Mr. de Leon said. Tom Sander, who runs a program on civic engagement at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, said he was worried that voters might not have a chance to remove partisan blinders. \u201cMany of us come to these events more to confirm what we already think we know, rather than to search for common ground,\u201d Mr. Sander said. The candidates may hope otherwise. Mrs. Clinton has told donors privately that she expects 100 million people to watch the debate, and that 60 million of those viewers may be focusing on the campaign for the first time, a prime opportunity for her to make inroads. Many may tune in merely for the spectacle. \u201cIt\u2019s like waiting for the   fight,\u201d said Dick Cavett, the longtime   host, referring to the highly anticipated boxing bouts between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier in the 1970s. Mr. Cavett said he would cut short a dinner on Monday to ensure he would be in front of a TV by 9 p. m. \u201cThere\u2019s possible drama and fireworks and insults and horror and disaster and potential enlightenment,\u201d Mr. Cavett said. \u201cIt would attract anybody. \u201d Some in TV noted that the 2008 meeting between Joseph R. Biden and Sarah Palin attracted 70 million viewers, more than any of that year\u2019s presidential debates, a sign that civic interest may be less of a draw than seeing a colorful candidate like Ms. Palin  \u2014   or Mr. Trump. The 1980   debate scored a record audience in part because it was the only    matchup between the candidates in a precable era. But Neal Shapiro, a former president of NBC News, recalled that Mr. Reagan\u2019s unusual background as a Hollywood actor spurred interest. \u201cPeople wanted to see, would they really feel comfortable with Reagan as president?\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. \u201cPeople were wondering, \u2018Can I live with this guy? \u2019\u201d The first debate between President Obama and Mitt Romney in 2012 drew 67 million viewers. Advertisers, anticipating even more this time, are using the opportunity to unveil new ads with themes that may resonate with Americans focused on the campaign. Audi\u2019s commercial shows a man and woman, both hotel valets, battling for the right to drive an Audi RS7 luxury car, and features the slogan \u201cChoose the next driver wisely. \u201d American flags, and ice sculptures of a donkey and an elephant, convey the message that the car, as an Audi vice president for marketing put it, is \u201ca metaphor for the importance of America. \u201d In a spot set for Monday night, Tecate, a Mexican beer label owned by Heineken, features a view of the Mexican border and a     that declares, \u201cThe time has come for a wall  \u2014   a tremendous wall. \u201d The wall is revealed as a   resting place for Tecate beers, \u201ca wall that brings us together. \u201d The ad, airing on networks including Fox News and Univision, is \u201cabsolutely not\u201d about a political point of view or affiliation, said Felix Palau, a vice president at Tecate. \u201cTecate, being a Mexican beer, is a perfect protagonist of a story where a wall brings people together in a very fun way,\u201d Mr. Palau said. The debate\u2019s biggest televised competition on Monday is likely to be another program featuring intricate strategies and crushing blows: \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d on ESPN. And one famous political junkie says he may flip the channel  \u2014   for a few minutes, at least  \u2014   to the action on the gridiron. \u201cThe president\u2019s fired up about \u2018Monday Night Football,\u2019\u201d Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, playfully told reporters who asked if President Obama planned to watch the debate. \u201cThere will be millions of people across the country who are quite interested to see the two candidates onstage together for the first time,\u201d Mr. Earnest added. \u201cI imagine the president will be one of them. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561914.9965293}
