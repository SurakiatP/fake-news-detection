Chuck Schumer can block construction of the border wall, says Vanity Fair. [The magazine\u2019s writer, T. A. Frank, is a liberal with some understanding of the Trump coalition and he argues that the Democrats hope to break Trump\u2019s presidency by blocking funds for the wall:  Thwart Trump and he looks weak. You force him to break his signature promise. His agenda stalls. The Hispanic vote moves even more solidly to the left. The Democratic base gets energized, and Trump\u2019s base gets demoralized and stays home in the next couple of elections. It\u2019s  . That\u2019s why Chuck Schumer has spoken of \u201cshutting down the government\u201d if Trump tries to get the wall going   \u2026     People are now suggesting Trump has given up on the wall in all but rhetoric. And this would be momentous. If Trump\u2019s wall is dead, then Trump\u2019s presidency is dead, But Trump is still trying to get funds for the wall, in the face of uniform and public Democratic opposition plus widespread   opposition from GOP leaders. In a Friday, April 28 speech to the National Rifle Association, for example, he declared that: \u201cWe\u2019ll build a wall. Don\u2019t even think about [not getting a wall]. Don\u2019t even think about it. Don\u2019t even think about it. That\u2019s an easy one. \u201d Amid unified Democratic opposition, Trump only has two choices, argues Vanity Fair: Trump\u2019s options are limited. He could in theory play \u2014  or have played \u2014  a ruthless game to get his way, since Trump has the power to revoke the \u201cdeferred action for childhood arrivals\u201d or DACA order that Barack Obama signed in order to shield those who have arrived here illegally as children. An icier type wouldn\u2019t have hesitated to hold the fate of these people hostage for wall funding, employing rhetoric about the importance of tying today\u2019s forgiveness to tomorrow\u2019s prevention, and so on. But Trump shows few signs of being that callous, and he has conveyed only reassurances to the Dreamers. So threats of this sort will not be his approach. The second option would be to try to sell the wall \u2014  and do a better job of it than he did with Ryancare   \u2026     Trump could try to sell people on a vision of America with tighter labor markets [that push up higher wages] more equitable distribution of wealth, and less [civic] balkanization   \u2026     He could pair this with a pitch for the wall, arguing that walls are peaceful and usually effective, and they reduce the need for more intrusive forms of enforcement such as workplace raids and deportation. But Trump has only figured out how to use the wall to sell himself. He never figured out how to use himself to sell the wall. Democrats oppose the wall, in large part, because it is an effective barrier that future politicians can\u2019t remove, and is also a concrete symbol of Americans\u2019 determination to block the flow of cheap labor,   customers, renters and future voters from Mexico to   cities along the coasts. But Trump also faces a huge problem in getting top GOP leaders to fund his plans for a wall, because the wall would shrink the flow of illegal immigrants sought by many business groups in Texas, Georgia and other red states. Throughout April, that   GOP opposition meant that GOP leaders failed to push Democrats to approve Trump\u2019s request to build an additional 48 miles of border barrier in 2017. The requested $1 billion was blocked by Democrats, although congressional leaders say Trump will get the extra funds for other homeland security tasks in the 2017 supplemental budget, now slated for approval in early May. The   GOP opposition is cloaking itself as a supporter of alternatives to Trump\u2019s permanent    barrier, such as an invisible fence of expensive sensors and border patrol agents which later can be switched off as soon as Trump leaves the White House. A wall \u201creally means \u2018security\u2019   \u2026     It could be open surveillance to prevent people from crossing,\u201d Florida GOP Rep. Dennis Ross told Bloomberg in December. \u201cIt does not mean an actual wall. \u201d \u201cI\u2019ve always thought the wall was a metaphor for securing the border,\u201d not an actual wall, claimed Wisconsin GOP Sen. Ron Johnson during an April CNN interview. \u201cThere will never be a   wall built, period,\u201d claimed South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, a   Republican. \u201cI think it\u2019s become symbolic of better border security. It\u2019s a code word for better border security. If you make it about actually building a   wall, that\u2019s a bridge too far. \u201d \u201cI think a wall is anything that will stop people from coming into the country illegally,\u201d claimed Pennsylvania GOP Rep. Lou Barletta. \u201cIt could be a variety of what can be used to be successful. \u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan is also downplaying the wall part of the wall. \u201cConditions on the ground determine what you need in a particular area,\u201d he told CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes. \u201d Immigration reformers are pushing Trump to fight for wall funding in the 2018 budget, due in October. \u201cConstruction of a border wall was one of the president\u2019s signature promises during his campaign,\u201d said a statement from the Federation for American Immigration Reform. As he has made clear, an effective border security plan would include a wall in areas of the border where it is a viable and effective deterrent and that other sections of the border would be enhanced by technology and additional manpower. We expect that the president will deliver on these commitments. Unfortunately, past versions of a \u2018comprehensive border security plan\u2019 have been ineffective because they did not require the laying of a single brick of border wall. Such a cosmetic approach was a precursor to amnesty and both have been consistently rejected by the American people. We look forward to seeing details of the president\u2019s plan that will actually get the job done of securing our southern border. \u201d However, border security is only one component of a needed overhaul of immigration. Much more is expected by the American people and the White House must demand Congress pass meaningful reforms to eliminate the incentives for illegal immigration and create a legal immigration system that truly serves identifiable national interests. \u201d Read more about the wall here.'"}, "time": 1742564479.8637092}
