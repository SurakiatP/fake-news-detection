Is he trying to use it as you\u2019d use a word such as \u2018largely\u2019 or \u2018finally\u2019? Would the opposite of \u2018bigly\u2019 be \u2018littlely\u2019? Is his grasp of the English language really that bad? \\nHe has used it a lot in his campaign speeches, and it has even been transcribed and reported at times as \u2018bigly.\u2019 Some people have decided he\u2019s actually saying \u2018big league.\u2019 Others aren\u2019t so sure. \\nIt turns out that it\u2019s not his vocabulary that\u2019s at fault, it\u2019s his pronunciation. \\nRaymond Navarro of Catholic broadcaster EWTN asked him directly in an interview this week if he\u2019s saying \u2018bigly\u2019 or \u2018big league.\u2019 Trump responded : \u201cI use big league.\u201d \\nYou can see the exchange on 25:05 in this video clip from the interview. \\nThe fact that he\u2019s saying \u2018big league\u2019 was also affirmed by his son Donald Trump Jr. who was asked about it after the September 26 presidential debate. \\nSo now the mystery is over. But not before broadcast and social media had a lot of bigly fun with it. Watch this funny clip from Bloomberg, which was made before the truth was revealed. It contains all the bigly/big league confusion you can handle. \\nFeatured image: screenshot from YouTube video Connect with me'"}, "time": 1742561839.4676552}
