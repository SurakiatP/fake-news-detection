Trump\u2019s translator to conservatives, character witness to evangelical Christians, and clarifier in chief, issuing explanatory statements after Mr. Trump has committed a variety of unforced political errors. By now, he had hoped to add another line to his 2016 political r\u00e9sum\u00e9: surrogate in chief, stumping with and raising money for Republican Senate candidates. But, especially among vulnerable incumbents, the reception has been tentative at best. The problem is not Mr. Pence, strictly speaking: He is largely viewed with respect and appreciation by fellow Republicans. The problem is the man on top of the ticket  \u2014   and the fear that Mr. Pence is an unwitting carrier of a kind of political toxicity. \u201cThis notion that, \u2018I\u2019m Mike Pence, I\u2019m here to help, and people won\u2019t notice I\u2019m associated with Donald Trump,\u2019 in these close Senate races, is notionally absurd,\u201d said Steve Schmidt, a Republican strategist who was a senior adviser to John McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign. \u201cThe association with Trump that Pence brings into your campaign  \u2014   I think most Senate candidates are going to want Mike Pence in their states the way they\u2019re going to want a mosquito bite in Miami. \u201d Aides to Republicans in several contested Senate races, when asked if their candidates had any plans to appear with Mr. Pence, politely demurred. \u201cKelly is focused on the Senate race and talking to as many New Hampshire voters as she can, and we\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d said Liz Johnson, a spokeswoman for Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire. \u201cWe look forward to helping Republicans up and down the ticket to make sure career politicians from the past like Senator Feingold and Hillary Clinton aren\u2019t elected,\u201d said Brian Reisinger, a spokesman for Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. And from the team of Senator Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania: \u201cPat and Mike are friends, and Pat would be happy to see him in Pennsylvania, but there are no plans to campaign together at this time,\u201d said Ted Kwong, a campaign spokesman. Even the campaign of Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, who has endorsed Mr. Trump, said the senator had no events scheduled with Mr. Pence, though he was \u201cnot closing the door. \u201d At one point after his selection by Mr. Trump, Mr. Pence  \u2014   the understated,   half of the Republican ticket  \u2014   was expected to play the role of national cheerleader, bringing party loyalty and a frisson of   excitement to the aid of Republicans in statewide and Senate races and helping to rally conservative voters to turn out in November. \u201cPence gives vulnerable senators an opportunity to campaign with the presidential ticket without the baggage of the photo op with Donald Trump,\u201d said Nathan Gonzales, editor of The Rothenberg and Gonzales Political Report. \u201cTrump makes it hard for many Republicans to be excited or unified about this entire election, but Pence is a breath of fresh air for them. \u201d But that may be in doubt, as Mr. Pence has increasingly backed up Mr. Trump, echoing some of his more contentious statements. In a CNN interview Thursday, Mr. Pence seconded Mr. Trump\u2019s contention that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was a stronger leader than President Obama. \u201cI think it\u2019s inarguable that Vladimir Putin has been a stronger leader in his country than Barack Obama has been in this country,\u201d Mr. Pence said. Mr. Pence did, however, break with Mr. Trump in saying he believes Mr. Obama was born in the United States. And on Friday, he released 10 years of his tax returns  \u2014   though it remained unclear whether Mr. Trump would follow suit. Some   appearances involving Mr. Pence may yet unfold: His aides have held discussions with several Senate campaigns, including that of Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, about coordinating joint outings. (\u201cMarco has tremendous respect and admiration for Governor Pence,\u201d said Olivia   a campaign spokeswoman, \u201cbut we have no joint events scheduled with him at this time. \u201d) To be sure, Mr. Pence is no outcast: Some Republicans believe that he can help shore up the party\u2019s base in states like Arizona, Georgia and Missouri, helping to energize social conservatives who appreciate his opposition to abortion rights. He recorded a video testimonial for Representative Joe Heck, the Republican candidate in the competitive Senate race in Nevada. He has appeared with at least 17 House members, many in solidly Republican districts where turnout will be crucial three governors and four senators  \u2014   including Richard Burr of North Carolina, who is in a tough   fight, and Mike Lee of Utah, who hosted Mr. Pence at a policy forum recently. \u201cMike\u2019s excited to continue to unify the party behind the ticket and he looks forward to helping competitive Senate races wherever he can,\u201d said Marc Short, a senior Pence adviser. \u201cHe knows it will be important to have a Republican Senate when he and Mr. Trump are elected. \u201d But Mr. Pence\u2019s firepower in attracting favorable attention, including that of major political donors, is somewhat limited. He lacks the star power of a Sarah Palin or Paul D. Ryan: Though reporters, aides and Secret Service agents were looking on while Mr. Pence got a haircut in Pennsylvania recently, the barber had no idea his customer was a   candidate. Another indication: He has appeared on Fox News only about a dozen times since becoming Mr. Trump\u2019s running mate. As Mr. Pence himself likes to joke, he\u2019s \u201ckind of a   Republican celebrity. \u201d Instead, he has been more active behind the scenes, not only helping Mr. Trump, but also burnishing his own credentials and relationships  \u2014   something that could help further his own  political ambitions if Mr. Trump is defeated. He has quietly reached out to former Trump rivals, like former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, and to fierce opponents, like the Wisconsin radio host Charlie Sykes, to try to quell lingering tensions. \u201cIt\u2019s a very, very soft sell,\u201d said Mr. Sykes, an outspoken critic of Mr. Trump who met privately with Mr. Pence during a recent campaign swing through the state. \u201cHe asks nothing. He basically said, \u2018Can we keep the lines of communication open? \u2019\u201d The Trump campaign has also largely ceded donor outreach to Mr. Pence, according to an Indiana Republican briefed on the discussions Mr. Trump does not enjoy making donor calls, and Mr. Pence\u2019s team has an existing   apparatus. On Tuesday, Mr. Pence will headline a   in Washington  \u2014   the first in the capital for the   campaign. Ryan Williams, a Republican strategist who worked for Mitt Romney\u2019s campaign in 2012, said that while Mr. Pence was \u201ca nice guy\u201d and generally   some Senate candidates understandably choose to avoid unnecessary risks. \u201cThe concern isn\u2019t that Mike Pence is going to say something crazy,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s that Donald Trump, on the other side of the country, is going to say something crazy, and he\u2019ll have to clean it up  \u2014   and that will involve other Republicans at the event. So even just having Mike Pence there could be a distraction. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564246.359448}
