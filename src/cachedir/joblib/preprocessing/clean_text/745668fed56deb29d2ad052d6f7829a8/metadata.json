They are among the most dishonest human beings on earth,\u201d Trump said. The approximately 400 CIA employees broke out into applause after Trump said this. In addition to making it seem, falsely, like he was in a feud with the intelligence community, Trump said the media \u201cshowed an empty field\u201d during his inauguration. \u201cWe had a massive field of people. You saw that, packed,\u201d Trump said. He then noted that when he woke up Saturday morning, he turned on the TV and noticed, \u201cI get up this morning, I turn on one of the networks and they show an empty field. I said, wait a minute. I made a speech. I looked out. The field was, it looked like a million  \u2014   a million and a half people. They showed a field where there were practically nobody standing there. And they said, \u2018Donald Trump did not draw well. \u2019\u201d  He added, \u201cWe have something that\u2019s amazing because we had it looked  \u2014   honestly, it looked like a million and a half people. Whatever it was, it was. But it went all the way back to the Washington Monument. And I turn on [the tv] and by mistake I get this network, and it showed an empty field. \u201d \u201cSo, we caught them,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we caught them in a beauty, and I think they\u2019re going to pay a big price. \u201d  Trump went on to note yet another lie perpetuated by the media. Specifically, Zeke Miller of Time magazine falsely reported that Trump removed the bust of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. from the Oval Office. The bust of the esteemed, late civil rights leader was never removed. (President Barack Obama had removed the bust of Winston Churchill from the Oval Office shortly after he moved in and replaced it with MLK Jr. \u2019s). \u201cIn the Oval Office, there\u2019s a beautiful statue of Dr. Martin Luther King,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd, I also happen to like Churchill  \u2026     He doesn\u2019t come from our country, but had a lot do with it. He helped us, real ally. \u201d Trump had requested that Churchill\u2019s bust be replaced in the Oval Office upon his move into the White House. \u201cBut there was a cameraman that was right in front of it. So Zeke, Zeke from Time Magazine\u201d wrote a fake news story, Trump said. \u201cI would never do that. I have great respect for Dr. Martin Luther King. And it was right there. But this is how dishonest the media is. \u201d Trump added, \u201cI love honesty. I like honest reporting. \u201d  And finally, he told the CIA, \u201cI love you. I respect you. There\u2019s nobody I respect more. you\u2019re going to do a fantastic job. And we are going to start winning again, and you are going to lead the charge. Thank you. I\u2019ll be back. \u201d White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer also pointed out the lies perpetuated by the media during his emergency press conference Saturday. \u201cSome members of the media were engaged in deliberately false reporting,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cPhotographs of the Inauguration proceeding were intentionally framed in a way to minimize the enormous support it had gathered on the National Mall,\u201d he said.  He noted earlier how Miller of Time magazine \u201cfalsely tweeted out that the bust of MLK, Jr. had been removed from the Oval Office. \u201cThis was just plain wrong. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562266.8061113}
