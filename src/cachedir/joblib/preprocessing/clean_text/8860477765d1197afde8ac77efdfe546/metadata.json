As a result of this effort, we\u2019re asking everyone to agree to a Community Commitment beginning November 1, 2016. Agreeing to this commitment will affect your use of Airbnb, so we wanted to give you a heads up about it. \\nWhat is the Community Commitment? \\nYou commit to treat everyone\u2013regardless of race, religion, national origin, ethnicity, disability, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation or age\u2013with respect, and without judgment or bias. \\nHow do I accept the commitment? \\nOn or after November 1, we\u2019ll show you the commitment when you log in to or open the Airbnb website, mobile or tablet app and we\u2019ll automatically ask you to accept. \\nWhat if I decline the commitment? \\nIf you decline the commitment, you won\u2019t be able to host or book using Airbnb, and you have the option to cancel your account. Once your account is canceled, future booked trips will be canceled. You will still be able to browse Airbnb but you won\u2019t be able to book any reservations or host any guests. \\nWhat if I have feedback about the commitment? \\nWe welcome your feedback about the Community Commitment and all of our nondiscrimination efforts. Feel free to read more about the commitment. You can also reach out to us at [email protected] \\nThe Airbnb Team'"}, "time": 1742562482.8923838}
