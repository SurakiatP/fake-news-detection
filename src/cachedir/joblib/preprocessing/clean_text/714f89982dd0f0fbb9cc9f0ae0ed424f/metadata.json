Pregnant with her first child, she stood in the kitchen of her home on the North Fork of Long Island and stirred a pan of cabbage and butter. Her husband, Vincent Catalano, was upstairs painting the baby\u2019s room. Petersson had a bowl of ground meat on the counter beside her, some potatoes, a small glass of cream. It was her grandmother\u2019s recipe she was making, she said, a kind of cabbage meatloaf that she remembered from childhood outside Gothenburg, in Sweden. Kalpudding, it\u2019s called. You serve it with lingonberries. I wanted to eat it right away. These are hard days for cooking, as winter too slowly gives way to vernal rain and sunshine. Farmers\u2019 markets are bare in many precincts, and for some a kind of fatigue has set in, an exhaustion with soups and stews, with root vegetables and pot roasts, with salads built of factory greens and flavorless tomatoes. Soon there will be strawberries, asparagus, rhubarb, snow peas and watercress, the paschal lamb, the Easter ham. But soon is not now. Early March can leave cooks adrift in home and restaurant kitchens alike, unsure of themselves, desirous of inspiration. And here was mine. I wasn\u2019t staying for dinner. I had only dropped by for a brief, neighborly   before the birth, a what\u2019   and see you soon. But the scent of the cabbage was ambrosial:   approximating caramel on the razor\u2019s edge of burned. I could imagine the vegetables stirred into and enrobing the meat, and I knew if I couldn\u2019t find lingonberries, I could swap them out for cranberries and be happy with the result. I cooked a kalpudding the next day. I cooked a lot of them after that: ground beef and pork mixed with bread crumbs and some of the caramelized cabbage, formed under a cloak of more cabbage and baked until the top went dark and almost dry at the edges, delicious crunch above the succulent meat. I served them with lingonberry preserves (thanks, Internet!) cut with vinegar and Worcestershire sauce, made velvet with butter, alongside boiled potatoes. One day in the middle of all this cooking, I called Magnus Nilsson, the chef at Faviken, a restaurant on a large estate in northwestern Sweden that regularly appears on lists of the world\u2019s best. Nilsson is fanatical in his devotion to Nordic cuisine. In 2015, he published \u201cThe Nordic Cookbook,\u201d an invaluable guide to the region\u2019s cooking, from the braised guillemot of the Faroe Islands to the taco quiche of suburban Stockholm. He has a recipe for kalpudding in the book. It was as much casserole as meatloaf. Kalpudding, he told me  \u2014   \u201cand I\u2019m just theorizing here\u201d  \u2014   is just an    version of the stuffed cabbage the Swedes call kaldolme, a dish Nilsson traces back to the 18th century, a Nordic version of the Turkish dolmas that Swedish soldiers tasted in the Ottoman Empire when they sought refuge there after an unsuccessful military campaign against the Russians. \u201cIt\u2019s an infidel\u2019s version, with pork,\u201d he said. \u201cBut hard to make, with all that stuffing and rolling. So kalpudding is what you\u2019d make at home. \u201d Nilsson said he was once particular about the preparation of the dish. When he set out to compile the cookbook, he said, \u201cit was a big documentary project. I was dead set on accuracy. There was no room for adaptation. \u201d But making the recipes work for the regular home cook put the lie to that goal, he said, and so did the hundreds of regional differences in particular dishes prepared in different parts of Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark and Iceland. (What, you don\u2019t have any goose blood around to make the svartsoppa?) Nilsson used as an example the binders that are used in kalpudding, to help the meat hold together. \u201cHistorically, there are breadcrumbs in kalpuddings made in Stockholm,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s because there were bakeries there. You don\u2019t see that to the north, where there were no bakeries,\u201d and crushed barley is used instead. Some bind their kalpudding with rice, or shredded potatoes. That\u2019s good, I said, because Nilsson calls for the use of \u201cgolden syrup\u201d to help caramelize his cabbage, and the rest of the world doesn\u2019t easily have access to the Swedish version of that   syrup, amber and   very different from our own (the Internet isn\u2019t perfect). Nilsson laughed. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t use molasses,\u201d he said. But you can. The result will be no less Nordic, Nilsson said. \u201cCabbage smells in a very special way when it almost burns,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt gets savory, almost like a beef stock. It tastes almost brown and umami yummy. \u201d How you get it to that point, he added, is \u201cwhat\u2019s interesting, what happens when you cook a dish elsewhere, with what you have available to you. It always, always, makes sense. \u201d Recipe: Kalpudding (Meatloaf With Caramelized Cabbage)'"}, "time": 1742562092.7271492}
