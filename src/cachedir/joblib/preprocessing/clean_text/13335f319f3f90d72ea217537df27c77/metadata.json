The recent actions of the Tea Party are prompting an exodus among left-leaning citizens who fear they\u2019ll soon be required to hunt, pray, and to agree with Bill O\u2019Reilly and Glenn Beck. \\nCanadian border farmers say it\u2019s not uncommon to see dozens of sociology professors, animal-rights activists and Unitarians crossing their fields at night. \u201cI went out to milk the cows the other day, and there was a Hollywood producer huddled in the barn,\u201d said Manitoba farmer Red Greenfield , whose acreage borders North Dakota . The producer was cold, exhausted and hungry. He asked me if I could spare a latte and some free-range chicken. When I said I didn\u2019t have any, he left before I even got a chance to show him my screenplay, eh?\u201d \\nIn an effort to stop the illegal aliens, Greenfield erected higher fences, but the liberals scaled them. He then installed loudspeakers that blared Rush Limbaugh across the fields. \u201cNot real effective,\u201d he said. \u201cThe liberals still got through and Rush annoyed the cows so much that they wouldn\u2019t give any milk.\u201d \\nOfficials are particularly concerned about smugglers who meet liberals near the Canadian border, pack them into Volvo station wagons and drive them across the border where they are simply left to fend for themselves.\u201d A lot of these people are not prepared for our rugged conditions,\u201d an Ontario border patrolman said. \u201cI found one carload without a single bottle of imported drinking water. They did have a nice little Napa Valley Cabernet, though.\u201d \\nWhen liberals are caught, they\u2019re sent back across the border, often wailing loudly that they fear retribution from conservatives. Rumors have been circulating about plans being made to build re-education camps where liberals will be forced to drink domestic beer and watch NASCAR races. \\nIn recent days, liberals have turned to ingenious ways of crossing the border. Some have been disguised as senior citizens taking a bus trip to buy cheap Canadian prescription drugs. After catching a half-dozen young vegans in powdered wig disguises, Canadian immigration authorities began stopping buses and quizzing the supposed senior citizens about Perry Como and Rosemary Clooney to prove that they were alive in the \u201950s. \u201cIf they can\u2019t identify the accordion player on The Lawrence Welk Show, we become very suspicious about their age.\u201d an official said. \\nCanadian citizens have complained that the illegal immigrants are creating an organic-broccoli shortage and are renting all the Michael Moore movies \u201cI really feel sorry for American liberals, but the Canadian economy just can\u2019t support them.\u201d an Ottawa resident said. \u201cHow many art-history majors does one country need?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742628514.4617734}
