James Comey better hope that there are no \u201dtapes\u201d of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017,  Trump fired Comey on Wednesday, setting off a slew of speculation and leaks over why the former FBI director  \u2014   who had been disliked on both sides of the aisle  \u2014   was fired. On Thursday, the New York Times published an account of a dinner, sourced to two Comey associates, that differed from the president\u2019s account. It\u2019s not clear yet whether Trump has any recordings of the conversation that took place. Trump told NBC\u2019s Lester Holt on Thursday Comey had requested the dinner on January 27, because the wanted to stay on as FBI director. He said at that dinner, Comey told him he was not under investigation. But according to Comey\u2019s associates, Trump requested the dinner, and pressed him to pledge his loyalty. \u201cMr. Comey declined to make that pledge. Instead, Mr. Comey has recounted to others, he told Mr. Trump that he would always be honest with him, but that he was not \u2018reliable\u2019 in the conventional political sense. \u201d Comey\u2019s people added that Comey was wary about dining with the president, but believed he couldn\u2019t turn him down. The White House disputed the account. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe this to be an accurate account,\u201d said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the deputy press secretary. \u201cThe integrity of our law enforcement agencies and their leadership is of the utmost importance to President Trump. He would never even suggest the expectation of personal loyalty, only loyalty to our country and its great people. \u201d According to the White House, one of the many reasons Comey was fired was because he failed to stop sensitive leaks of information to the media.'"}, "time": 1742562206.9605138}
