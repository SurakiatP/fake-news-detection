What do you want to see here? Email us with your feedback at asiabriefing@nytimes. com. Here\u2019s what you need to know: \u2022 The contentious American presidential race is fracturing the Republican Party. Donald J. Trump and his allies are turning on Republican leaders in Congress with an intensity that sometimes matches their battle against Hillary Clinton. The latest hacked emails from WikiLeaks reveal worries about Clinton Foundation donations hurting Mrs. Clinton\u2019s political future. (The Clinton and Trump foundations are vastly different.) Mr. Trump has begun engaging in barely veiled promotions of his business brand, pulling reporters to his marquee properties between his campaign events. On Wednesday, he held a   at his   hotel near the White House. And Mr. Trump inaugurated a   talk show that is helping stoke speculation that he is planning to start his own network after the election. \u2022 President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines used his state visit to Japan to ratchet up his   remarks. \u201cI want them out,\u201d Mr. Duterte said of the United States troops in his country, adding that he was willing to \u201crevise or abrogate agreements\u201d on military bases. But deep cultural, economic and military ties make upending the alliance unlikely. \u2022 Russia abruptly withdrew its application to dock three warships for refueling at a Spanish port in the Mediterranean, after NATO members urged Spain to turn the vessels away. The ships are en route to support Russian military operations in Syria. \u2022 The Islamic State is under siege in Syria and Iraq, but its influence is still felt around the world. Fighters linked to the terror group seized a port town in Somalia, and a group of gunmen who claimed allegiance to the group executed 23 civilian hostages in western Afghanistan. \u2022 \u201cIncredibly lucky. \u201d That was our photographer, who was covering Iraqi forces\u2019 push toward Mosul when his convoy was hit by a suicide car bomb. This is his account, with photos and videos.  \u2022 Australia will suffer from drought, more extremely hot days and a longer and fiercer fire season, the county\u2019s top weather scientists say. The report offers a snapshot to countries around the world of the challenges of climate change. \u2022 ZTO Express, the Chinese delivery service, is coming to Wall Street in what many expect to be the biggest initial public offering of the year. ZTO\u2019s top customer is the   giant Alibaba. \u2022 Samsung Electronics\u2019 Galaxy Note 7 debacle virtually wiped out   profit at its mobile division. The company said it expected the division to recover in the coming quarter. \u2022 Recalled Takata airbags are still circulating freely in used cars in the United States, especially at auctions, the   rung of the market. \u2022 A glut of cash in Europe and Asia that is being pumped into the U. S. bond market has many economists warning of a looming crisis. They say the situation echoes a wave of investment in the years before last decade\u2019s financial meltdown. \u2022 U. S. markets were lower, led by real estate shares. Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets. \u2022 China is holding military drills in an area of the South China Sea today and has ordered all other shipping to avoid the zone. [Reuters] \u2022 Dreamworld, the Australian theme park, said it would reopen this week with a \u201cMemorial Day\u201d for the four adults who were killed on a ride. [BBC] \u2022 The Afghan woman whose photograph as a young refugee was published on the cover of National Geographic in 1985 was arrested in Pakistan for trying to obtain illegal identity cards. [The New York Times] \u2022 Hong Kong\u2019s legislative council was thrown into chaos and adjourned again as two barred lawmakers stormed into the chamber with supporters. [South China Morning Post] \u2022 China instituted the   policy on this day in 1982 and suspended it a year ago. A new study in a British medical journal predicts no baby boom and a peak population of 1. 45 billion in 2029. [CCTV] \u2022 Five officials with the environmental protection agency in Xian, China, have been detained for tampering with   devices and falsifying data. [The Straits Times] \u2022 Mount Fuji tied a record for the latest date it has ever been capped by snow. Japan began keeping track of the event in 1894 the record was set in 1956. [Asahi Shimbun] \u2022 AIDS arrived in the U. S. long before \u201cPatient Zero. \u201d [The New York Times] \u2022 Relocating the 6, 000 or more people who had been living in \u201cThe Jungle\u201d encampment in Calais has exposed France\u2019s divided view of migrants. [The New York Times] \u2022 The original set of 176 emojis, created by the Japanese mobile provider NTT DoCoMo and released in 1999, is now in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. \u2022 We\u2019ve all lied once or twice to spare someone\u2019s feelings, but a new study looks at how fibbing could turn into serial dishonesty. \u2022 The surfing world knew John John Florence was the best. Now it\u2019s official. How much is a rat\u2019s life worth? The universally loathed rodent is a frequent target of eradication programs in cities worldwide. Jakarta is the latest metropolis attempting to eliminate the urban pest to prevent outbreaks of diseases. Officials say they will offer a bounty of about $1. 50 a rat. That\u2019s a bump from Paris\u2019s offer of a nickel in 1920 (about 60 cents today) during its war on the animal. The Times reported then about a hunter using explosives who handed in about 250 tails. But it was a hoax. The police learned they were made of string and rubber. About 20 years later, the going rate for rat was just 2 cents in Chongqing, China. Humans were enlisted to help after it was said the rodents used their whiskers to poison the dogs sent to exterminate them. There are twists on the financial incentives to wipe out invasive species. Fishermen in Jamaica have reaped the benefits of a demand for lionfish on dinner plates. And prize money is offered in a Florida contest aimed at culling the state\u2019s Burmese python population. Contestants there are allowed to use guns, but that\u2019s something Jakarta\u2019s deputy governor hopes to avoid. \u201cIf you miss your shot,\u201d he warned, \u201cthe bullets could hit other people. \u201d Patrick Boehler contributed reporting.
