[As a part of an ongoing lecture series organized by the Griot Institute at Bucknell University entitled, \u201cThe Black Body (Re) Considered,\u201d activist Nyle Fort will return to campus to \u201cexplore the moral and spiritual dimensions of the Black Lives Matter movement. \u201d His lecture is   by the English department.  In the   2014 issue of Syndicate Theology, a   periodical, Fort wrote,\u201dunder conditions of white supremacist terror, revolutionary violence can be an expression of Christian love. \u201d I addressed Mr. Fort\u2019s work last year in the introduction to an event featuring   editor Milo Yiannopoulos, arguing that that the administration\u2019s liberal politics motivated their respective responses (or lack thereof) to the Yiannopoulos and Fort events. Before Yiannopoulos spoke at Bucknell last February, the administration sent out a   email to calm the community\u2019s concerns over his upcoming visit. Bridget Newell, then the university\u2019s Associate Provost for Diversity, suggested that Yiannopoulos\u2019 values contradicted the \u201cqualities of inclusiveness and respect that we want to emulate\u201d at Bucknell. Although he criticized President Obama and the Black Lives Matter movement in his event at Bucknell, Yiannopoulos argued that \u201cthere is stuff left to do on race in America  \u2026    ( ) are still owed something. \u201d Yiannopoulos addressed the struggles faced particularly by   females, who he suggested are on the receiving end of   institutional discrimination. Just weeks before Yiannopoulos appearance, Fort spoke at Bucknell without the smallest amount of resistance from those in the community on the right. This week, he\u2019ll return to Bucknell in the aftermath of an incident in which Bucknell Professor Marcellus Andrews slandered my peers and me, publicly calling us \u201cracists\u201d and instructing students to \u201cimpose a steep and lasting price\u201d on us for organizing last year\u2019s Yiannopoulos event. \u201cI praise Mr. Ciccotta for helping the young and dark understand that there is not much that the administration can do about racism on campus, because y\u2019all can\u2019t,\u201d Bucknell Professor Marcellus Andrews wrote in an email to University President John Bravman and I after I brought my concerns over Andrews\u2019 conduct to the administration. If there were to be \u201crevolutionary violence\u201d at Bucknell, as Fort calls for, who would it be directed towards? In a political climate in which the labels \u201cracist\u201d and \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d are thrown around arbitrarily without hesitation, and sometimes, without legitimate cause, Fort\u2019s call for violence should be deeply concerning to university administrators that host him on their campuses. Fort even acknowledges that his theories on violence are controversial, but justifies his radicalism by arguing that the theological concept of a god being \u201cone in three persons\u201d is equally controversial, but nonetheless worthy of serious consideration. To say Christian love can embody revolutionary violence is controversial. But so is saying God is \u201cOne in three persons\u201d! Just because something is controversial doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t take it seriously or even embrace it. The idea of the Trinity is controversial to many as is revolutionary violence. Interestingly, however, most Christians are silent about State violence on black bodies, and yet condemn the very idea of those same bodies engaging in counter, revolutionary violence. He adds that Christians must start to recognize \u201cthat the face of Jesus Christ is the body of Michael Brown,\u201d because \u201cJesus shows up in the suffering of black bodies and all the world\u2019s cruci\ufb01ed peoples. \u201d Fort, of course, should be allowed to speak, even without a disclaimer from the University, but it is concerning that the same community that took such issue with Yiannopoulos\u2019 brand of provocation and humor gave Minister Fort, and his justification of violence in the name of Christianity, a warm embrace, and will do so again this week at Bucknell a second time. This isn\u2019t a conversation about violence, but rather the failure of university administrations to act objectively when faced with   matters. Last week, before American Enterprise Institute Scholar Charles Murray spoke at Middlebury College, the school\u2019s president Laurie Patton injected her personal politics into the discussion and denouncing his scholarship, claiming that she \u201cprofoundly disagrees with much of Mr. Murray\u2019s views. \u201d In January, Dean of Students Amy Badal attended a candlelight vigil held at Bucknell in response to President Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration. Can students feel comfortable expressing their support of such legislation on campus if administrators like Badal are willing to take such a strong and public stance? Instead of defending my peers and I against Andrews\u2019 threat and accusations of racism, Badal and the administration claimed that I had \u201cmischaracterized\u201d the email (which you can read in its entirety here). The administration argued that the university \u201cvalues and encourages the free exchange of diverse ideas and perspectives,\u201d despite the texts assigned throughout my economics curriculum consisting almost exclusively of leftist and   market perspectives. University administrators must adopt an objective set of moral principles that isn\u2019t derived from partisan ideology if they are to ensure that all students are treated fairly, educated comprehensively, and so that they can rightfully condemn conduct that infringes upon students\u2019 ability to participate in the tradition of open intellectual inquiry upon which the academy was founded.
