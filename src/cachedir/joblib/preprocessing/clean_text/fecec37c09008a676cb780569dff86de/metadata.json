Trump just made his decision for the nation\u2019s highest legal official: Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama. \\nAnd it\u2019s a nightmare for liberal Democrats. \\nIn fact that\u2019s exactly what the Huffington Post called him in their flash headline moments ago\u2026 \\nJefferson Beauregard Sessions III, 69, would serve as the nation\u2019s top law enforcement official if nominated by Trump and confirmed by his fellow members of the Senate. Sessions, an early Trump backer, is an immigration hard-liner who has been in the Senate since 1997 and previously served as attorney general for the state of Alabama. \\nSessions is as \u201chardline\u201d as a conservative can get on the core issues of the Trump Agenda, and signals to Washington that Trump is dead-serious about enforcing laws against illegal immigration, enforcing voter ID and gutting the hard-left \u201ccivil rights division\u201d at the Department of Justice. \\nSessions is a former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama appointed by Ronald Reagan, and a tough prosecutor with little patience for liberal arguments, and a deep respect for the Constitution. \\nSessions is credited with crafting Trump\u2019s entire immigration platform , released last August. His plan includes building a permanent border wall, including details on how he would make Mexico pay for it ; end birthright citizenship , overhaul the refugee program that has overwhelmed America\u2019s heartland, enact mandatory E-Verify to block illegals from jobs, a \u201cpause\u201d in green card approvals to allow unemployed Americans a chance at job positions, and an increase in salaries of H1-B visa holders to stop the undercutting of wages by foreign workers. \\nAnd unlike some cutting-edge picks such as Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, Sessions is almost certain to win speedy confirmation as a sitting, senior Republican Senator. \\nThe official announcement from Trump\u2019s transition team is expected later today.
