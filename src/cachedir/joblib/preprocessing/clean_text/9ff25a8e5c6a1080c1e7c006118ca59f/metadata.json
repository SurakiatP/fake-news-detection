[The Syrian Foreign Ministry condemned the missile attack in two letters to the UN   and the president of the UN Security Council, saying such an attack would not have occurred had it not been for the \u201cdirect support from the outgoing American administration and French and British leaderships. \u201d  The ministry said the Israeli assault on the Mezzeh military airport comes as part of a series of periodic Israel attacks that started with Syria\u2019s war in March 2011. It called on the international community to \u201cpunish the Israeli aggressor. \u201d The attack was the third such incident recently, according to the Syrian government. In a statement carried on the official news agency SANA, the Syrian military said several missiles were launched just after midnight from an area near Lake Tiberias. The missiles fell in the vicinity of the Mezzeh military airport on the western edge of the Syrian capital. The statement did not say whether there were any casualties. Residents of Damascus reported hearing several explosions that shook the city. The Mezzeh airport compound, located on the southwestern edge of the capital, had been used to launch attacks on   areas near Damascus and has previously come under rebel fire. The Syrian army said Israel, through its attacks, was assisting \u201cterrorist groups\u201d fighting the Syrian government. \u201cThe Syrian army command and armed forces warn the Israeli enemy of the repercussions of this blatant attack and stress that it will continue its war on terrorism,\u201d the statement said. On Dec. 7, the Syrian government reported Israel fired    missiles that also struck near the Mezzeh airport. A week earlier, SANA said Israeli jets fired two missiles from Lebanese airspace toward the outskirts of Damascus, in the Sabboura area. The Israeli military has declined to comment on those incidents, and there was no immediate comment on Friday\u2019s reported attack. Israel is widely believed to have carried out a number of airstrikes in Syria in the past few years that have targeted advanced weapons systems, including     missiles and   missiles, as well as positions of the Lebanese militant Hezbollah group in Syria. The Shiite group has sent thousands of its fighters to Syria to support President Bashar Assad\u2019s forces in the country\u2019s civil war, now in its sixth year. Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman recently reiterated his government\u2019s position to not get involved in the Syrian war.'"}, "time": 1742562041.9169111}
