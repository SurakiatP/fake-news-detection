He faulted how the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, handled new emails related to the investigation into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s private server, and then shouted out to college students here in a pivotal battleground state that it was crucial that they vote because the \u201cfate of the world is teetering.\u201d \\nMr. Obama\u2019s comments about Mr. Comey, broadcast early in the day as recent polls showed a tightening race, were striking for a president who has insisted he does not comment on F.B.I. investigations. But Mr. Obama appeared to be doing exactly that in implicitly criticizing Mr. Comey\u2019s decision to send a vague letter last week to Congress \u2014 and by extension, the public \u2014 informing lawmakers about a discovery of new emails related to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s use of a private server as secretary of state. \\n\u201cWe don\u2019t operate on incomplete information,\u201d Mr. Obama said in an interview with NowThis News. \u201cWe don\u2019t operate on leaks. We operate based on concrete decisions that are made.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742563148.7935286}
