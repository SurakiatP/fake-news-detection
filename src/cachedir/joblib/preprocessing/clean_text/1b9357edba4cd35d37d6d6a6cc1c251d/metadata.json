City trucks blocked roads near army barracks. Buses and subways operated free of charge, and local officials and mosque preachers helped mobilize government supporters to the streets. And when President Recep Tayyip Erdogan finally emerged in public, after uncertain hours in which he narrowly missed being seized at a seaside hotel by soldiers trying to topple his government, he flew, not to the capital, Ankara, but to Istanbul, where he remained throughout the weekend and on Monday. Ankara may be the seat of Turkey\u2019s government, but it was Mr. Erdogan\u2019s grip on Istanbul, a city he once governed as mayor, that was crucial in putting down the coup. In the failed coup\u2019s aftermath, it was in the streets, mosques and public squares in Istanbul that his Islamist supporters raucously celebrated, and where Mr. Erdogan consolidated his hold on power. The two cities, in many ways, represent Turkey\u2019s deep divisions: Istanbul owns the hearts of the Islamists and is Turkey\u2019s showcase to the world, while Ankara is a special place for secular Turks. \u201cIstanbul\u2019s becoming almost the second capital of the country has been very instrumental in preventing the coup,\u201d said Yusuf Muftuoglu, who was an adviser to the former president, Abdullah Gul, and briefly for Mr. Erdogan. The drama of the failed coup mostly played out across two urban spaces and the skies overhead  \u2014   Istanbul, the sprawling megacity that symbolizes the country\u2019s past as the seat of Islamic empire, and Ankara, the utilitarian capital, a onetime Anatolian backwater built up by modern Turkey\u2019s secular founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. Much of the violence occurred in Ankara, where different factions of the armed forces battled over government buildings. But the events in Istanbul proved crucial in fending off the coup. It was there that two private news channels broadcast   coverage and gave a platform to elected leaders, including Mr. Erdogan. During his time in power, Mr. Erdogan has spent far more time in Istanbul than previous presidents and has overseen the construction of Turkey\u2019s largest mosque in the city. He has also built up the police force, much of which is based in Istanbul. By stocking the force with loyalists and purging suspected enemies, he created a counterweight to the military, which has a history of carrying out coups against civilian governments. And it was largely the police special forces that defended the government over the weekend, confronting the renegade military factions. In the days before the attempted coup, a palpable sense of melancholy could be felt when walking through the city, whose singularity is measured in numbers: seven hills, two continents, the capital of three former empires. Turks call it \u201chuzun,\u201d a rich,   word that means melancholy and a lot more: loss, sadness, spiritual anguish. Turkey\u2019s most famous novelist, Orhan Pamuk, used it to describe Istanbul in the dreary years after the fall of the Ottoman Empire. The word is back in the city\u2019s lexicon now, as years of optimism about Turkey\u2019s growing power on the world stage give way to anxiety over terrorism and internal conflicts. After the coup was decisively put down, and Mr. Erdogan\u2019s supporters flooded the streets and city squares over the weekend to celebrate, a sense of buoyancy returned to the streets, but the joy masked a deep unease that has enveloped the city. Istanbul, where ancient mosques and churches jostle with gleaming skyscrapers and   shopping malls to define an evolving cityscape, was reshaped by Mr. Erdogan\u2019s Islamist government, which created a glistening image of the city that is now threatened by instability. The government embraced Turkey\u2019s Ottoman and Islamic past as a mythical time of harmony and reimagined Istanbul as Turkey\u2019s true capital, investing heavily in public works projects, new shopping malls and office buildings. Ankara took a back seat. \u201cI think the city was presented as this perfect dream without its problems,\u201d said Kaya Genc, a novelist and essayist who wrote about \u201chuzun\u201d after the recent  attack on Istanbul\u2019s main airport, which left dozens of people dead. \u201cMaybe it was a lie, but we miss it. \u201d Now, he said, \u201cis the return of the real Istanbul. \u201d By that he meant a city whose mood is more in sync with its unstable past of military coups, political violence and economic crisis. In recent years, the government built an image of Istanbul as an urban wonderland of fascinating history and great architecture and cuisine, and tourism boomed. Mr. Genc said that like many other liberals and intellectuals he bought in to the vision. \u201cA past was reinvented, and repackaged as this great, multicultural history where there are no conflicts,\u201d he said. Even before the failed military coup, all that was clouded by spillover from the Syrian civil war  \u2014   terrorism and a flood of refugees, hundreds of thousands in Istanbul alone  \u2014   that set the city on edge. \u201cEverything is being Arabized,\u201d said Karaca Borar, who owns an antiques shop on one of the crooked, cobbled streets in European Istanbul, and supplied many of the items that fill a nearby museum owned by Mr. Pamuk that is based on his novel \u201cMuseum of Innocence. \u201d He said he was tired of hearing the Arabic greeting of \u201csalaam aleikum\u201d on the streets, and tired of so many Syrians in general. (It is a widely shared sentiment: When Mr. Erdogan recently said Turkey should offer citizenship to Syrians, a   secular newspaper called Syrians \u201cvermin\u201d in a   headline.) Asked about the mood of the city, which before the coup attempt had faced several devastating terrorist attacks for which the Islamic State was blamed, Mr. Borar said, \u201cTerrible, terrible, terrible. \u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not happy,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not at ease. \u201d He continued: \u201cWe were the only secular, decent country in a bad region. Now, we are like one of those Arab states. \u201d With so many threats, even the weather can set off panic, a clap of thunder sending people scampering for cover. People walking the streets are scrutinized for what they are wearing and what they are carrying. A backpack could be a bomb. A sweater or jacket in summertime could conceal a vest of explosives. Nowadays, it seems, all of Turkey\u2019s old conflicts  \u2014   most prominently the divide between religious and secular Turks  \u2014   and many new ones, are coming to the fore. The most dramatic was the long night of uncertainty as fighter jets buzzed the sky, gunfire echoed across the city, and protesters mobilized as the military tried to secure the city. But even before that, Turkey\u2019s traumas were playing out across Istanbul, in bitter conversations about politics, in painful decisions to move away or in to gated communities, in smatterings of protests quickly put down by the police, and in new debates over the use of public spaces. Three years ago, protesters in Gezi Park, in Taksim Square in European Istanbul where Mr. Erdogan\u2019s supporters rallied over the weekend, rose up to oppose plans to convert the park into a shopping mall. The protests became a widespread challenge to his rule, which is growing increasingly autocratic. It produced no lasting political changes, but it did save the park. But maybe not for long. In recent comments that seemed designed to provoke his enemies, Mr. Erdogan said he could revive the plan. On a recent afternoon, Ali Erdogan, a retired military man in his late 60s who is not related to the president, sat on a bench in Gezi Park, where the city has planted new trees, blossoming with pink flowers, and told how his life had improved since Mr. Erdogan came to power more than a decade ago. He pulled out his card for retirees for free rides on Istanbul\u2019s subway, which has been modernized in recent years, as has Turkey\u2019s health care system. \u201cEverything is new and shiny,\u201d he said. More important, he said, he can freely express his religion, something he was unable to do when Turkey\u2019s secular elite ruled the country for decades. He said when he was in the military, the guardian of secularism, he had to conceal his religiosity. \u201cI had to lie that I prayed five times a day,\u201d he said. \u201cI had to find a secret corner to pray. \u201d The city\u2019s most conservative district is Fatih, in the old city, across the Golden Horn waterway that divides European Istanbul. There, Mr. Erdogan spoke at a funeral on Sunday, and rallied his supporters to keep gathering in the city\u2019s public squares. It is also where three suicide attackers who carried out the airport bombings lived in an orange apartment building. But the area is far from homogeneous. In one gentrifying enclave of Fatih, in a neighborhood called Balat,   cafes and quirky antique shops have sprouted on the narrow streets, raising tensions and testing the limits of social diversity. \u201cIstanbul used to be like a village,\u201d said Hikmet Bardok, 63, a longtime resident. \u201cI don\u2019t recognize it anymore. A lot of people who live here are poor. And these rich people are coming in an looking for places to park their Ferrari. \u201d Mr. Bardok said he quit drinking in 1994 when he turned to religion, and blamed secular Turks for the country\u2019s polarization because they are \u201carrogant and disrespectful. \u201d Now that they are moving in to his neighborhood, he is worried that \u201cin five to 10 years this place is going to turn into Amsterdam. \u201d Mr. Genc, meanwhile, has been thinking of writing a book on what he calls the \u201cNew Istanbul,\u201d a chronicle of the \u201cartificial, distant new neighborhoods\u201d that have built up in the city\u2019s outer reaches during Mr. Erdogan\u2019s tenure. Mr. Erdogan once enjoyed the support of many of Istanbul\u2019s intellectuals and elites, some of whom now call him a dictator, even though they opposed a coup. They once thought him capable of healing the country\u2019s divides, and basked in the optimism that flowed through Istanbul. Now, in the aftermath of the coup attempt, they are left to wonder if Mr. Erdogan will turn more autocratic or, perhaps, seize the time to patch up relations with segments of the society he has alienated. That will become clearer in the days and weeks ahead. For now, Turks are simply trying to make sense of their dizzying weekend. The morning after the coup attempt, Mr. Genc woke early, and went for a walk along the Bosporus. \u201cIn the background was the waterway,\u201d he wrote in an essay for The New York Times, \u201ca burning sun and two bridges that span two continents, where just hours before tanks had been firing shots. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564398.8031445}
