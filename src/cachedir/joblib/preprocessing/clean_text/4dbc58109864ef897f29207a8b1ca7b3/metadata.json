[Singer Barbra Streisand tweeted Saturday that Trump is making her gain weight, because after hearing the morning news, she switches from liquids to pancakes doused in maple syrup.  Donald Trump is making me gain weight. I start the day with liquids, but after the morning news, I eat pancakes smothered in maple syrup!  \u2014   Barbra Streisand (@BarbraStreisand) March 5, 2017,  Trump just accused Obama of tapping his phones. Seriously crazy times. Time for more pancakes.  \u2014   Barbra Streisand (@BarbraStreisand) March 5, 2017,  The    singer and vocal supporter of former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton issued the tweets after Trump accused President Obama\u2019s administration\u2019s of tapping the phones at Trump Tower before the election in a series of tweets on Saturday. Former Obama spokesman Kevin Lewis denied the charge in a statement Saturday. \u201cA cardinal rule of the Obama Administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cAs part of that practice, neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U. S. citizen. Any suggestion otherwise is simply false. \u201d Streisand has been one of Trump\u2019s most outspoken celebrity critics. Just last week, she penned a column for the Huffington Post saying that the new president\u2019s first 40 days in office paled in comparison to those of his predecessor. \u201cTrump has promised to \u2018make America great again.\u2019 What makes America great is when our government is as good as our people, and acts with compassion and decency and humility,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHe has failed this test already in his first 40 days. \u201d At a pricey New York City fundraiser for Hillary Clinton in June, the singer mocked Trump by performing a rendition of Stephen Sondheim\u2019s 1973 song \u201cSend in the Clowns. \u201d Streisand previously called Trump \u201cclueless, reckless, graceless and heartless,\u201d and also \u201cterrifyingly scary. \u201d In August, the singer vowed to move to Australia if Trump won the election. But Streisand isn\u2019t the only celebrity who claims Trump is affecting their weight in February, Girls star Lena Dunham claimed that the pain of what she called the Republican\u2019s \u201c \u201d election victory contributed to her recent weight loss.
