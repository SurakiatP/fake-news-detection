He  \u2014   it was short and he went through it quickly, and it was militant, and it was dark, the crime, the gangs, the drugs, this American carnage, disrepair, decay. You can\u2019t imagine the outgoing president giving a speech like that. This president also repeating  \u2014   the new president, also repeating that our guiding principle will be America first, America first. We know how he has used that as a campaign slogan, that does also have dark echoes in American history. There was an America First Committee that formed in this country, hundreds of thousands of people in this country, some of the richest businessmen in the country were a part of of it. They were formed to keep us out of World War II. They were infiltrated by the Nazis. Many of them were   part of why they weren\u2019t alarmed by Hitler\u2019s rise in Germany. The America First Committee is something that means a specific thing in this country, to   it now, not that far down the historical path, it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s hard to hear. \u201d (  Daily Caller) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742563748.927497}
