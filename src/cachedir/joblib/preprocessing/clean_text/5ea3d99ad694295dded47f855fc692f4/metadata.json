They wander through a replica of Mr. Ban\u2019s old   house. They learn about his personal journey to the United Nations, where he was secretary general for 10 years. Despite criticism of his tenure there, Mr. Ban is seen as a role model by vast numbers of South Koreans. School textbooks, for example, celebrate him as a \u201cman who made South Korea proud. \u201d And many South Koreans want Mr. Ban to be their next president, succeeding Park   whom the National Assembly voted to impeach last month on corruption charges. When Mr. Ban arrived home on Jan. 12, crowds of   turned out at the airport, waving flags and shouting, \u201cBan   please save this country!\u201d Yet there is also deep skepticism about his potential presidential bid, especially among the nation\u2019s progressives. They say he is trying to be part of the establishment yet against it at the same time  \u2014   a \u201cMr. \u201d in the words of critics. (The word \u201cban\u201d in Korean means \u201chalf. \u201d) Mr. Ban calls himself \u201ca child of the United Nations,\u201d part of a generation of South Koreans who remembered United Nations handouts in the destitute years after the   Korean War, as well as   United Nations Forces who fought in the war. Many of his contemporaries view the United States as South Korea\u2019s savior and protector. \u201cI am ready to give my all to uniting the divided country and making South Korea a   nation,\u201d Mr. Ban said. \u201cAs United Nations secretary general, I have seen why some nations prosper and why some fail. \u201d His advocates say he is a seasoned,   diplomat who can best deal with both North Korea\u2019s advancing nuclear weapons program and President Trump, who has raised questions about Washington\u2019s trade and defense commitments to its allies. One of the first things Mr. Ban did after his homecoming was support the deployment of an American missile defense system that has angered North Korea and China. Critics say his place in the establishment makes him unsuitable as a figure who can restore trust in government. They believe the political class has been disgraced by Ms. Park\u2019s corruption scandal and yet is also desperate for a candidate it can support in an election that could take place as early as this spring. The Constitutional Court is expected to rule in the coming weeks whether Ms. Park should be formally unseated. As Mr. Ban crisscrossed the country after his return, paying homage to the dead at national cemeteries and shaking hands with street vendors, his detractors trailed him, holding signs that called him \u201can opportunist,\u201d or worse. \u201cHe has spent his entire life on the sunny side,\u201d said Moon   an opposition leader who comes in ahead of Mr. Ban in surveys on presidential hopefuls. \u201cHe is not the kind who shares the people\u2019s desperate desire for change. \u201d Lee   who served as South Korea\u2019s prime minister when Mr. Ban was its foreign minister from 2004 to 2006, called Mr. Ban \u201ca diplomat who looks twice but does not leap. \u201d Mr. Ban won his United Nations job 10 years ago with the support of Roh   then the president, a progressive who handpicked him as a candidate. Critics called Mr. Ban a turncoat when he later appeared to align himself closely with conservatives, including Ms. Park. His popularity rating as a presidential contender has plummeted in the wake of Ms. Park\u2019s scandal. Since he has returned home, Mr. Ban has defined himself as a \u201cprogressive conservative\u201d who can mend an ideologically fractured country. But some local news media suspect him of   while he tries to find an ally among the existing political parties or to woo enough lawmakers away to form his own. They also call him a \u201cslippery eel,\u201d accusing him of being notoriously vague on tough questions, a trait that has sometimes served him well as a diplomat but now is under harsher scrutiny as he considers a presidential bid. As United Nations secretary general, he praised the deeply unpopular agreement Ms. Park struck with Japan to end a dispute over \u201ccomfort women,\u201d or Korean sex slaves for Japan\u2019s World War II army. But as a presidential hopeful, he began raising questions about the deal, saying that an agreement that failed to satisfy the surviving victims was not enough. With his popularity ratings stuck behind Mr. Moon\u2019s, the usually   Mr. Ban began bridling at criticism. When journalists recently dogged him with hard questions and then wrote articles that accused him of being   over the comfort women issue, he called them names. (He later apologized.) He has also called himself a Mr. Clean, responding to the outcry over Ms. Park\u2019s scandal. But to people weary of recurring corruption scandals among political leaders and their families, Mr. Ban\u2019s claim has already lost some of its luster this month, the United States indicted his nephew, who is a New York real estate broker, and his younger brother in South Korea on charges of attempting to pay bribes to facilitate a Korean company\u2019s sale of a   commercial building in Vietnam. Mr. Ban denies involvement. Yet here in his home province of Chungcheong, pride in Mr. Ban is compared to a personality cult by his critics. Streets, marathons and   contests are named after him. Songs are written about him, including one that calls him \u201cKorea\u2019s favorite son who embraced five oceans and six continents. \u201d In Eumseong, the seat of the county that includes this village, a park displays a circle of bronze busts of Mr. Ban and other former United Nations secretaries general. And this hamlet, which has only a dozen households, is a veritable Ban   theme park. A monument erected by the local Ban clan calls him a \u201csacred peak of the world\u201d whose \u201cwarm smile dissipated international conflicts. \u201d Visitors stroll around the \u201cBan   Peace Land,\u201d a small park with a granite monument in the shape of the United Nations headquarters surrounded by flags of member states. In the \u201cBan   Memorial Hall,\u201d biographical sketches and video clippings tell how Mr. Ban, with his quiet tenacity and \u201cwarm charisma,\u201d overcame his humble origin and became the \u201cpresident of the world. \u201d \u201cIf I sleep now, I may dream, but if I study now, my dream will come true,\u201d goes one of the 19 Ban   sayings in a museum handout. Older villagers remember the young Mr. Ban walking on a dirt road with his eyes fixated on an English textbook. (His English skills gave him his first big break: As a teenager in 1962, he excelled at an   contest, winning a Red   trip to the White House, where he met President John F. Kennedy and resolved to become a diplomat.) A roadside motel here added more rooms because so many newlyweds believed that if their firstborns were conceived with the blessing of the energy of the mountains surrounding the village, they would grow up to be luminaries like Mr. Ban. \u201cI brought my children here so they can learn from Secretary General Ban\u2019s life that there is no easy way in life but that if you try hard, your dream comes true,\u201d said Lee   42, who recently visited here with his daughter and son. Kim   65, a   owner who recently visited Mr. Ban\u2019s birthplace, said Mr. Ban\u2019s \u201cvast experiences and  \u201d will make him a great president, enabling him to avoid the kind of mistakes that led to Ms. Park\u2019s scandal. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor to have him in our country,\u201d he said. But another visitor, Kim   also a Ban fan, feared that Mr. Ban might not survive the thrust and parry of domestic politics. \u201cI wonder why he risks ruining his image by entering domestic politics,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a mud pit, and he could end up losing all. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561855.8033628}
