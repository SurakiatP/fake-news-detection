He won the election fair and square, despite what the whiny liberals have to say about it. Of course that means that with his victory, President Obama is on his way out. \\nWe are literally two months away from having President Obama leave the White House. That is something that should be applauded, considering the destruction that he has caused the country over the past eight years. But there was a fear that some Republicans had regarding the time leftover in office. \\nConsidering the fact that Obama is leaving, there were fears that he was going to pass some legislation that would affect the country and be nearly impossible for Trump to repeal. These were going to be called the \u201cMidnight Rules\u201d and it was going to ensure that Trump was going to have some issues before tackling the issues he wanted to tackle the most. \\nExcept that fear is NO MORE. The House of Representatives passed legislation, by a margin of 240-179, allows Congress to undo any of the last-minute rules and regulations that were going to be put on the books before President Obama leaves office. \\nThe bill\u2019s sponsor, Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican out of California and the former chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, had this to say about the bill. \u201cThis bipartisan bill is about reviving the separation of powers to ensure our laws are written by the representatives we actually vote for \u2013 not unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats who are on their way out the door.\u201d \\nThis was put into place to make sure that Obama doesn\u2019t try to sneak any last minute laws by that would further his agenda. Which means that any law that he thinks is going to get through is going to get shut down by the GOP controlled Congress. Obama\u2019s Plans To Push His Agenda Through Last Second Have Been Just Squashed \\n\u201cPresidents of both parties have made habit of enacting scores of last-minute regulations, with little oversight, to sneak in as much of their agenda as possible before the clock runs out on their time in office.\u201d And there is still so much more that Obama wants to put in. After all, he was in favor of adding as many Syrian refugees as possible. \\n\u201cThe bill helps ensure this President, and any future president, will be held in check and that their policies have the proper level of scrutiny by both Congress and the American people. I\u2019m pleased to see the House pass this important measure and look forward to its quick passage by our colleagues in the Senate.\u201d \\nThis was an important bill because Obama has shown that he is willing to undermine the Constitution. He has done so repeatedly, including one of the more recent examples being the $1.7 billion that he sent to Iran as part of the ransom payment for four American hostages. \\nAnd it wasn\u2019t just members of Congress that were excited about this bill. FreedomWorks CEO Adam Brandon was also pleased with the House vote. He committed his Washington-based logistics and policy hub for conservative activists to working with Capitol Hill conservatives in making sure that law-making authority returns to Congress. \\n\u201cThe Obama administration\u2019s regulatory agenda has been damaging to the economy and the destructive to separation of powers in Article I of the Constitution.\u201d He is completely right. The Constitution ensures that there is supposed to be a separation of powers between the branches and make sure that one of the branches isn\u2019t more powerful than the other. Obama Continues To Try And Destroy Our Constitution \\nObama has proved over and over again that he wanted to go over the powers of Congress to make sure that his agenda was secure. This includes the fact that he tried to have millions of millions of illegal immigrants granted amnesty so that they were able to stay in the country and possibly vote. \\nAnd they ended up voting! In this last election there were three million illegal immigrants that cast a ballot. That was despite the fact that they weren\u2019t allowed to vote considering that they aren\u2019t legal citizens of the United States! And yet the liberals were all in favor of this because they were all voting for Hillary . Anything to help her out right liberals? \\nNot to mention that his ability to go over Congress has corrupted the minds of the younger generation. There have been several petitions out there that wanted to change the very basis of how this country works. First there was a petition that wanted to change the basis of electing the next president. \\nAnd the second petition that was going around included people asking that President Obama go over his Constitutional policies to appoint the next Supreme Court member without the consent of the Senate. Of course that is just another example of people saying that he should do what he can to overthrow the Constitution . \\nShare this article with your friends and family to show them that Congress has just passed a law that is going to make it impossible for Obama to implement any of his policies at the last second. This rule is going to make it impossible for him to try and push his agenda. \\nThis was the necessary change that needed to happen. President Obama has done enough to undermine the Constitution since he first sat in office eight years ago. And now any plans that he had to continue to do so until Trump gets into office have been destroyed.'"}, "time": 1742561966.378493}
