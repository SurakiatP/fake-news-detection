With the exception of Fox News and other conservative outlets, media like CNN go down this path because they see interest waning in the election, so they are looking to boost ratings with some artificial drama. \\nLike clockwork, some in the press are cooking up the comeback kid narrative. \\nDon\u2019t fall for it. Trust numbers. Trust facts, and trust voting results. The rest of it is the standard nonsense that gets pulled every election year when the networks begin to see their election bounce end and ratings decline.\""}, "time": 1742562606.6837537}
