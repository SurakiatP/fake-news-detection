A facts page summarizing Gorsuch\u2019s positions contains his full statement, which says the Supreme Court has held that \u201cthe Second Amendment protects an individual\u2019s right to own firearms and may not be infringed lightly. \u201d  He also wrote that there is \u201ca long tradition of widespread gun ownership by private individuals in this country. \u201d It is worth remembering that Trump pledged to nominate a justice \u201cin the mold of Scalia,\u201d and a SCOTUSblog entry for January 13, 2017, indicates he may have done just that.

He has an impressive record that demonstrates his support for the Second Amendment. We urge the Senate to swiftly confirm Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, just as it did in confirming him to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit by a unanimous voice vote. \u201d AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of \u201cBullets with AWR Hawkins,\u201d a Breitbart News podcast.
