{"duration": 0.08986949920654297, "input_args": {"text": "'It was a historic night that called for soaring rhetoric and unvarnished authenticity. Instead, Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump delivered victory speeches on Tuesday that leaned heavily on campaign clich\u00e9s  \u2014   in many cases, the same ones. On the page, anyway, the ideological and stylistic chasms that separate them start to dissolve in a sea of overlapping oratorical devices, similar phrases and at times identical word choice. Are their speechwriters out of juice? Or is the hackneyed phrase just too irresistible? We identified the passages that sounded the most alike: TRUMP: Tonight we close one chapter in history and we begin another. CLINTON: Now you are writing a new chapter of that story. It\u2019s a country, not a book. But this speechmaking construct won\u2019t die. Mrs. Clinton tries to infuse the familiar trope with the concept of inclusivity. Mr. Trump just trots out the same old wooden metaphor. _____ TRUMP: This is not a testament to me, but a testament to all of the people who believed real change . .. CLINTON: Tonight\u2019s victory is not about one person . .. So we all owe so much to those who came before and tonight belongs to all of you. It\u2019s not really about me, it\u2019s about you! But let\u2019s be honest: it\u2019s really about them. This   device is a clever way to claim a mandate without sounding  . Mr. Trump makes the most direct claim of humility. Mrs. Clinton makes a richer historical reference to previous barrier breakers. _____ TRUMP: And our country will never, ever back down. CLINTON: Our history has moved in that direction, thanks to generations of Americans who refuse to give up or back down. There\u2019s no backing down from this bromide. _____ TRUMP: I\u2019ve traveled to many of our states and seen the suffering in people\u2019s eyes. CLINTON: And I learned about those persistent problems and the unfinished promise of America that you\u2019re living with. Ever since Bill Clinton found the most economical way to say it in 1992, speechwriters have striven to complicate the sentiment: \u201cI feel your pain. \u201d _____ TRUMP: This election isn\u2019t about Republican or Democrat, it\u2019s about who runs the country. The special interests or the people. CLINTON: We want a government that listens to the people, not the power brokers . .. Everyone is a populist in 2016, even residents of Fifth Avenue and Chappaqua, N. Y. _____ TRUMP: Our campaign received more primary votes than any G. O. P. campaign in history. CLINTON: The first time in our nation\u2019s history that a woman will be a major party\u2019s nominee. Everyone wants to make history. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s breakthrough carries greater weight, but Mr. Trump  \u2014   not to be outdone  \u2014   tosses in his own milestone. _____ TRUMP: To those who voted for someone else, in either party, I\u2019ll work hard to earn your support. CLINTON: But whether you supported me or Senator Sanders or one of the Republicans, we all need to keep working toward a better, stronger America. The olive branch. Both extend it to their skeptics, without much creativity. _____ TRUMP: I\u2019m going to fight for you, the American people. I\u2019m going to be your champion. I am going to be America\u2019s champion. CLINTON: I hear you. I see you. And as your president, I will always have your back. Two approaches to the same trite message. Mr. Trump, ever the pugilist, deploys a slightly more combative construction  \u2014   \u201cfight for you. \u201d Mrs. Clinton takes a gentler and more supportive approach: \u201cI will have your back. \u201d _____ TRUMP: The beauty of America is that it brings us all together. CLINTON: Because we are stronger together. Let\u2019s say it together, folks: These campaigns need a thesaurus. _____ (Want to watch the full speeches?
