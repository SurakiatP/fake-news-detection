The Virginia senator said that just like he had changed his opinion on the issue, the Catholic Church is also likely to follow suit. Speaking at the 20th Annual Human Rights Campaign\u2019s National Dinner in Washington, the Roman Catholic senator reportedly said, \u201cI think it\u2019s going to change because my church also teaches me about a creator who, in the first chapter of Genesis, surveyed the entire world, including mankind, and said, \u2018It is very good.\u2019\u201d \\n\u201cAnd besides,\u201d he continued, \u201cwe are talking here about a country that was based and founded on democracy as a core value. By definition, that means that every single person and every single citizen is able \u2013 no, scratch that \u2013 encouraged to practice his civil, religious, and above all, sexual liberties to the best of their abilities. And I\u2019m sorry that some people don\u2019t like it, but to deny same-sex marriage in a country that should be the first one to accept it is just pointless. And the Catholic Church should also be accepting it instead of condemning it, which is what it\u2019s doing right now.\u201d \\nKaine also added that, if all else fails, \u201cthere are ways of making the Catholic Church listen to the voice of reason,\u201d which is how he dubbed all those who advocate LGBT equality. \u201cAt the end of the day, you know, we\u2019re a civilized people, of course the first thing we\u2019ll do is act nicely and ask nicely,\u201d he said. \u201cThen, if that doesn\u2019t work, we\u2019ll use our law and our legal system to enable ourselves to be who we are, or rather the LBGT community will do that \u2013 and it has. The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on same-sex marriage was a crucial milestone in our legal system that proves it works, it actually functions.\u201d \\n\u201cSo, what I\u2019m saying here,\u201d he argued, \u201cis that, while I respect the Catholic Church as I\u2019m sure millions of Americans do, you know, at some point it is going to start acting contrary to the Christian faith, and we\u2019re talking about an institution that\u2019s supposed to be the first one on the front line defending it. So, when that happens, and that\u2019s what\u2019s happening with condemning LGBT rights, we\u2019ll state an ultimatum. The United States of America, more precisely, the future President of the United States of America, Hillary Clinton, will state an ultimatum. And that ultimatum will be to either change its stance on same-sex marriage or pack its bags and get out of America. And yes \u2013 the President of the country can do that.\u201d \\n\u201cAnd in case anybody\u2019s wondering \u2013 no, Donald Trump won\u2019t do the same because he doesn\u2019t care about anyone other than Donald Trump. On the other hand, Hillary Clinton is a shining example of honesty, integrity and democracy, and you can rest assured she will do everything in her power as the president to make sure gays and lesbians throughout America are loved, respected and viewed as equals during her presidential term. What happens after that is not our problem,\u201d Kaine concluded.'"}, "time": 1742562173.4887493}
