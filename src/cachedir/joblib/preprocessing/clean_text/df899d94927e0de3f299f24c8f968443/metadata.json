Thousands of angry people in Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, Portland, New York and Los Angeles. The New York Times reports that crowds have been peaceful thus far:\\nProtesters claim they are there to reject Donald\u2019s Trump racist policies and some say they fear mass deportations under a Trump Presidency.\\nThe anxiety began to build on social media this morning as scores of people called for protests, revolution and open threats to kill President Elect Donald Trump .\\nIn the build up to November 8th we warned that the situation post-election, regardless of who wins, could quickly escalate into open warfare and Mike Adams of Natural News warned of a 95% chance of widespread post-election violence .\\nWith large-scale protests now brewing in major cities across the country, we believe it is only a matter of time before some or all of these forecasts could come to fruition.
