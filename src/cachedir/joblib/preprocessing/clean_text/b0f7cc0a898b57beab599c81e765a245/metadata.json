NBC is now reporting that Donald Trump\u2019s campaign management has fallen under the scrutiny of an FBI inquiry, which is sure to blossom into a formal criminal investigation centered on Trump\u2019s disgraced ex-manager Paul Manafort\u2019s stewardship of the Republican campaign and his close ties to Ukraine. When he departed, Manafort was facing felony charges , and now the FBI\u2019s suspicions have been confirmed by the evidence. \\nNew York Times f ound Ukrainian documents which outlined $12.7 million in previously unreported payments from a Ukrainian political party to Manafort, precipitating his departure from the campaign. \\nThe FBI has been conducting a preliminary inquiry into Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign manager Paul Manafort\u2019s foreign business connections, law enforcement and intelligence sources told NBC News Monday . Word of the inquiry, which has not blossomed into a full-blown criminal investigation, comes just days after FBI Director James Comey\u2019s disclosure that his agency is examining a new batch of emails connected to an aide to Hillary Clinton. \\nTrump has taken a series of pro-Russian positions that experts from both parties say are far outside the mainstream, and inexplicable from a political viewpoint. He continues to cast doubt on Russian involvement in election hacking, for example, despite the intelligence community\u2019s public assessment. \\nJust last night, we reported that Nevada Senator Harry Reid issued a statement alleging that the FBI had spoken of, \u201cexplosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government.\u201d Maryland Congressman Elijah Cummings told CNN this morning that members of Congress in the Democratic minority have actively requested that the FBI look into the various news reports that Trump\u2019s campaign, guided by Manafort, had drifted into Putin\u2019s orbit. \\n\u201cAny specifics of what the FBI or intelligence agencies may be looking at are not something that the bureau should be discussing publicly.\u201d ranking Democratic Congressman on the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff said, \u201cBut here, where the director has discussed an investigation involving one candidate, it opens the director up to claims of bias if he doesn\u2019t discuss other potential investigations.\u201d \\nThat\u2019s right, in a misguided pursuit of fairness, the FBI Director may have just trashed decades of investigatory policy and been forced to disclose the existence of their active inquiry into the Trump campaign.'"}, "time": 1742564425.0729792}
