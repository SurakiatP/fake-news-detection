Described as \u201cauthoritative,\u201d the newsletter is part of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. \\nHis total compensation in 2014 was $380,000. \\nOn the November 7 O\u2019Donnell show, Sabato predicted Clinton would win North Carolina (Trump won it) and that Clinton had a real shot of winning Ohio (Trump won it by nine points). \\nSabato said, \u201cOne of my great people at the Crystal Ball, Kyle Condik, wrote a book called Bellwether about Ohio\u2026so his contacts are the best and they keep telling us that it\u2019s much, much closer than people realize and that Clinton might, might be able to pull out a victory there\u2026\u201d \\nKondik is managing editor of Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball newsletter. \\nSabato also predicted a net gain of four for Democrats in the Senate, resulting in a 50-50 tie in Congress\u2019 upper chamber. \u201cIf we\u2019re right about the presidential contest, that means Vice President Tim Kaine (D) will be breaking ties after Inauguration,\u201d Sabato claimed. \\nSabato thought there was a chance of Democrats taking the Senate. \u201cIf we\u2019re off on the total number of seat changes [in the Senate],\u201d he said, \u201cwe think it\u2019s slightly likelier that Democrats get to 51 or 52 than Republicans. That could mean the Democrats pulling out a win in Indiana, Missouri, or North Carolina. If Republicans hold on to the majority, it probably would be because Ayotte survives in New Hampshire.\u201d \\nIn fact, Ayotte lost in New Hampshire and Republicans won in Indiana, Missouri, and North Carolina. \\nAyotte alienated Republicans by abandoning Trump. Her campaign alienated conservatives by passing out free condoms to get votes at the University of New Hampshire. \\nRather than being losses, the GOP victories were: In Indiana, the Republican Todd Young beat Democrat Evan Bayh by 52.1 to 42.4. In Missouri, the Republican Roy Blunt beat the Democrat Jason Kander by 49.4 to 46.2. In North Carolina, the Republican Richard Burr beat the Democrat Deborah Ross by 51.1 to 45.3. \\nAfter the Trump victory, Sabato\u2019s UVA website declared , \u201cWe heard for months from many of you, saying that we were underestimating the size of a potential hidden Trump vote and his ability to win. We didn\u2019t believe it, and we were wrong. The Crystal Ball is shattered. We\u2019ll pick up the pieces starting next week as we try to unpack what happened in this election, where there was so much dramatic change from just four years ago.\u201d \\nHe added, \u201cWe have a lot to learn, and we must make sure the Crystal Ball never has another year like this. This team expects more of itself, and we apologize to our readers for our errors.\u201d \\nPerhaps Sabato ought to spend more time teaching classes and less time on MSNBC, CNN and other channels. \\nTo make matters worse, O\u2019Donnell brought on Ana Marie Cox, a rabid feminist now with MTV, who breathed a sigh of relief at Sabato\u2019s prediction that Trump wouldn\u2019t win. But she said America still had a lot to fear because Trump\u2019s success in the primaries had revealed some \u201creal ugly things\u201d about the U.S. \\nShe added, \u201cI am hopeful this is going to be a fairly resounding victory and that is going to put some shame back in people about the kinds of things that have come up during this election.\u201d \\nFormer Jeb Bush communications director Tim Miller was then brought on to say that he was hopeful that Hispanic immigrants would be \u201cthe ones to put the nail in Donald Trump`s coffin\u201d in states like Colorado, Nevada and Florida. \\nTrump lost in Nevada by only 2 points and Colorado by only about 3 points. Trump beat Clinton in Florida. \\nSabato told O\u2019Donnell that a firm called Latino Decisions had estimated that Clinton would get a higher percentage of Latino votes than Barack Obama, and that Trump was at only 16 percent. \\nThe results were much different. In fact, the Pew Research Center says Clinton had a lower percentage of Latinos than Obama, and Trump got 29 percent, two more points that Mitt Romney in 2012. \\nMy crystal ball says Sabato will not change the name of his newsletter and that he will be back in four years making another round of predictions. \\nO\u2019Donnell himself bought into the hype, declaring that the fear is that \u201cthe presidency will be handed over to ignorance, incompetence and bigotry,\u201d but that \u201cthe latest polls indicate that\u2026America should have nothing to fear.\u201d \\nHe added, \u201cDonald Trump has taken this country to the brink, and tomorrow voters are likely to take it back.\u201d \\nThis episode of the O\u2019Donnell show demonstrates how the media talk among themselves, using sources that reaffirm their biases, while ignoring objective reality. \\nWe have come to expect this from MSNBC, but to have a prestigious university like UVA participate in such a charade is an absolute disgrace. \\n\u201cThe glass ceiling did not break Tuesday night, but the Crystal Ball shattered,\u201d wrote Andrew Cain of the Richmond Times-Dispatch, in a story about Sabato\u2019s humiliation. \\nBut don\u2019t think that Sabato will slink away in disgrace. He was back on CNN on Monday giving his opinion on the Electoral College.  '"}, "time": 1742628372.9402642}
