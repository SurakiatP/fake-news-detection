[Fabian Muir started his project in 2014 after former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott called for a ban on the burqa being worn on the premises of the National Parliament in Canberra. Mr. Abbott cited security concerns, calling the clothing a \u201cfairly confronting form of attire and frankly I wish it weren\u2019t worn\u201d.  According to the BBC, Mr. Muir\u2019s Urban Burqa project is a critique of \u201cthe rising far right and Islamophobia\u201d in general and Australians who feel that immigration from Islamic countries delivers less than desirable outcomes in particular. \u201cTragically, [  sentiment] has only become more magnified since 2014,\u201d Mr. Muir told the BBC, pointing to 49 per cent of Australians who, in a 2016 poll, supported a total ban on Muslims entering the country. \u201cThe refugee crisis  \u2026     is always such an easy target for politicians. There\u2019s always going to be a percentage of the population who swallows that because it seems like an easy solution to problems. \u201d Mr. Muir said Urban Burqa outlines a \u201ccultural clash\u201d that his art could overcome. \u201cIt\u2019s still about simulation but there\u2019s also a sense of confrontation and adaptation, hence this darker, edgier feel to it,\u201d he said. All the images in his series take the burqa and place it in everyday suburban scenes, from supermarkets to subway tunnels. Mr. Muir does not give historical nor religious context to the burqa which is the most concealing of Islamic female clothing. It covers the entire face and body, leaving just a tiny mesh screen as a window to the world. The burqa is worn when a woman leaves her home and is compelled to wear it until she returns. Critics regard it as a symbol of Islamist radicalism and supremacy. Rather than a religious symbol of oppression, Mr. Fabian likes to think of the burqa as an ennobling prospect for those who wear it. He told the BBC that the last image in his series shows a woman in a burqa standing in a skate park.  \u201cFor me it\u2019s a nice closing image, it\u2019s optimistic  \u2014   because of the reaching out,\u201d he said. \u201c[But] there\u2019s a sense that there are a lot of barriers that have to be overcome. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562088.0971837}
