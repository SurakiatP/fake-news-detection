Earlier this year, I highlighted how John Podesta\u2019s brother Tony was paid $140,000 per month by the medieval monarchy of Saudi Arabia. After all, who cares about women\u2019s rights when the pay is good? \\nHere\u2019s a excerpt from the post, \u201cGetting Things Done\u201d\u2013 The Brother of Hillary Clinton\u2019s Campaign Chair is a Major Lobbyist for Saudi Arabia : \\nThe kingdom employs a total of eight American firms that perform lobbying, consulting, public relations and legal work. \\nFive of the firms work for the Saudi Arabia Embassy, while another two \u2014 Podesta Group and BGR Group \u2014 have registered to represent the Center for Studies and Media Affairs at the Saudi Royal Court, an arm of the government. PR giant Edelman, meanwhile, is working for the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority to encourage international investment. \\nThe Podesta Group is billing Saudi Arabia $140,000 a month for its public relations services. During the last few months of 2015, it sent 27 emails, had two phone calls and one meeting with lawmakers and staffers, journalists, and organizations including Human Rights Watch and the Center for American Progress, disclosure forms show. \\nDLA Piper receives $50,000 a month from the kingdom and sent hundreds of emails to top congressional staffers between September and the end of February regarding meeting requests and, more generally, \u201cissues affecting U.S.-Saudi Arabia national security interests.\u201d \\nNotice the firm DLA Piper mentioned above. You\u2019ll want to remember that for later. \\nMoving along, the Podestas are diligent about making sure everyone gets to feed at the trough, including extended family. \\nAs James Rosen of Fox News uncovers: \\nAmid the tumult of the 2016 presidential campaign, John Podesta is best known as Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman and the individual from whose private account WikiLeaks is presently publishing some 50,000 hacked emails. \\nFor several months in 2012, Clinton\u2019s final year as secretary of state, Raytheon, the leading defense contractor, hired Podesta\u2019s sister-in-law, Heather Podesta, as a lobbyist, federal records show. \\nRaytheon was looking to enlarge its share of foreign military sales \u2013 transfers of advanced weapons systems to other countries that are reviewed and approved by the Department of State, then implemented by the Department of Defense \u2013 and was beefing up its lobbying operation to accomplish that goal before Secretary Clinton left office. \\nAt the same time, Raytheon retained two other lobbyists, John Merrigan and Matt Bernstein, both associated with the powerhouse D.C. law firm DLA Piper. All three of these lobbyists, including Ms. Podesta, were major donors or bundlers to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 and 2016 campaigns. Federal records show they have raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for Clinton\u2019s campaigns and earned hundreds of thousands of dollars lobbying her State Department. \\nThere\u2019s DLA Piper again. They appears to have their fingers in all realms of the military-industrial complex cookie jar. \\nIn the final three quarters of 2012, DLA Piper earned some $360,000 in lobbying fees from Raytheon, courting the State Department and other agencies, while Ms. Podesta, within that same time frame, received $100,000 from Raytheon for the same purpose. \\nThe gambit appears to have worked: Records maintained by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, the arm of the Defense Department that coordinates the transfers of weapons systems once they have received State\u2019s approval, show Raytheon as a prime contractor in at least seventeen foreign military sales in 2012, worth an estimated total of $26 billion. Of those contracts, three with the Gulf nation of Qatar \u2013 for missile defense, Apache attack helicopters and other materiel \u2013 accounted for $19 billion. \\nThe individual at the State Department who was statutorily entrusted to approve foreign military sales was Andrew Shapiro, the assistant secretary of state for political and military affairs. Prior to his nomination to that job, Shapiro had served as Clinton\u2019s national security adviser in her Senate office. Today, Shapiro is a partner in a Washington consulting firm whose other co-founders include Philippe Reines, Clinton\u2019s longtime press aide. \\nYou starting to see how all this works? \\nThe firm mentioned above is Beacon Global Strategies, and I covered them in this summer\u2019s post: New York Times Fails to Disclose Op-Ed Writer\u2019s Ties to Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u2018Principal Gatekeeper\u2019 . \\nAfter Clinton stepped down as secretary of state in February 2013, Raytheon discontinued the services of Heather Podesta + Partners, and ceased its use of DLA Piper at State. \\nWhile experts do not believe any laws were broken, the affair illustrates how Washington worked in the first Obama term, and particularly at the Clinton State Department. The Raytheon operation bears some similarity to a pop-up store that materializes to serve a seasonal need, such as Halloween candy or July Fourth fireworks, then vanishes once that need has been met. \\nSimply incredible. \\n\u201cI think this is as close an example of pay-to-play as we\u2019ve seen,\u201d said Raj Shah, deputy communications director at the Republican National Committee. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why [Raytheon] made these hires [of Heather Podesta, Merrigan and Bernstein]. \u2026 Their experience was getting access to Hillary Clinton and raising money for her.\u201d \\nBut hey\u2026'"}, "time": 1742564121.4295194}
