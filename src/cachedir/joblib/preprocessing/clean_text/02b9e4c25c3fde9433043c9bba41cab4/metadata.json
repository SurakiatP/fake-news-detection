Did the Clinton Foundation Personally Enrich Barack and Michelle Obama? \\nBy Judi McLeod \\nDid the pay-for-play Clinton Foundation personally enrich Barack and Michelle Obama? \\nA question well worth thinking about because the corruption of Hillary Clinton is the horse that bolted out of the barn on the watch of Community Organizer President Barack Obama. \\nIn her own words, Hillary Clinton went from \u201cbeing broke\u201d in 2001 to a net worth of $350 million and still counting in 2016. \\noo many forget that Clinton enriched personal friends and foreign powers while she would be under scant suspicion as Obama\u2019s chosen Secretary of State. It is vital to ask before Tuesday were Barack and Michelle two of the friends enriched by the corruption that flowed from the Clinton Foundation? \\nDuring the time of Hillary Clinton\u2019s corruption at work, Obama did not just keep looking the other way, he actually corresponded with Clinton on her private basement server under a fake name of. \\nHow like him to operate under a fake name as that\u2019s what he\u2019s been doing since 2008! \\nWhere\u2019s the forensic investigation to tell us how much money has been siphoned off to the bank accounts of Barack and Michelle Obama through the Clinton Foundation? \\nStanding in for the MIA mainstream media, radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh is asking the questions the voting public need need answered: \\n\u201cHave the Clintons been selling United States foreign policy? \\n\u201cHave the Clintons been engaging in pay for play? Meaning: You pay them and they\u2019ll play ball with you by giving you policy considerations or what have you.\u201d Have the Clintons been selling United States foreign policy? Engaging in pay for play? \\n\u201cThere is little doubt in the layman\u2019s world that that has been going on. Proving it is quite another matter, but there\u2019s little doubt, especially in the political world. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind that that\u2019s what\u2019s been going on and that\u2019s why she set up the server in the first place. The entire reason for the server in her basement was not because she wanted privacy per se. It\u2019s not because she wanted convenience. It\u2019s not because she didn\u2019t want to go to the hassle of having a StateDepartment.gov email address. It\u2019s not because she didn\u2019t trust people. ( Rush Limbaugh Nov. 3, 2016) \\n\u201cThe reason she set up the server in her basement was specific, and it was to be able to conduct business for the foundation and keep those emails from ever being seen by anybody, including Freedom of Information Act requests. And what the Clintons have been doing via their foundation is where the real criminality is. There\u2019s negligence and intent over on the email server side with classified data being trafficked and so forth. But over here at the foundation, that is where the Clintons have been engaging\u2026\u201d \\nThere can be little doubt that Obama\u2019s a valued player of the Bill, Hillary, Huma and Anthony Weiner baseball team. \\nIndeed we can see for ourselves that the Obamas are proud of what Hillary has done in the shocking and revolting pay-for-play game. Both president and First Lady have been out on the campaign trail telling Americans Hillary\u2019s the ONLY option for president. \\nIn praising his former Secretary of State, Obama has been telling outright lies, including the whopper that \u201cthe fate of the world is teetering\u201d because of Donald J. Trump. \\n\u201cThe fate of the world is teetering\u201d because Obama seeks to kill off all life for Western society. \\nHow conniving Obama is in his \u2018Elect Hillary\u2019 stumping: \\n\u201cYou know what? She\u2019s not flashy. She\u2019s not going around spending all the time giving big stemwinders. And as a consequence, sometimes she\u2019s underappreciated here at home,\u201d he said. \u201cBut she made me a better president,\u201d Obama told an audience of university students in Chapel Hill, N.C. \\n\u201cObama became most animated, and spent the most time, on the topic of Trump \u2013 a person he views as an existential threat to not only his legacy, but the world. \\n\u201cI am not on the ballot. But I tell you what, fairness is on the ballot, decency is on the ballot, justice is on the ballot, progress is on the ballot,\u201d he warned, his voice noticeably rising. \u201cOur democracy\u2019s on the ballot right now!\u201d Clinton didn\u2019t make Obama a better president but most likely only a richer one \\nClinton didn\u2019t make Obama a better president but most likely only a richer one. \\nObama IS \u201cOn the ballot\u201d because he\u2019s going for a third term through the election of the country\u2019s biggest liar. \\nCivil unrest is being planned by community organizers everywhere should Donald Trump be elected, and the draining of the swamp will be epic. \\n\u201cFor unto whomsoever much is given , of him shall be much required ,\u201d reads Luke 12:48 in the King James Version of the Bible. \\nTrump\u2019s first job should be return the White House, now a den of inequity, to the people. America needs a White House that belongs\u2014not to the perps but to the people. \\nWhen global masters inflicted the community organizer president on the world back in 2008, it did not include a right to dictate who would follow him as president. \\nToday\u2019s the last \u2018Friday Dump\u2019 until after election and millions wait for the other shoe to drop. \\nNo matter what today\u2019s dump brings, millions who want a better America will survive it and go on to fight the Obama-Clinton cabal to the finish. \\nGod help us all because the devil is now running as freely in the White House as he is at the Vatican. \\nH/T \u2013 CanadaFreePress \\nSupport the Trump Movement and help us fight Liberal Media Bias.
