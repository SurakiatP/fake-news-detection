[Ostensibly organized to protest the election of Donald Trump, the march on January 21, 2017, will showcase the losing platform of Hillary Clinton, especially her dogged devotion to   .  While the march\u2019s website claims that \u201cwe join in diversity\u201d by \u201cdefending the most marginalized among us,\u201d women who are   or defend traditional marriage and family fall outside the stated qualifications of those who wish to march and are not welcome. The \u201cunity principles\u201d that narrow the scope of the march specifically espouse \u201creproductive rights\u201d and \u201cLGBTQIA rights,\u201d while omitting the rights to religious freedom or the fundamental right to life. \u201cWe believe in Reproductive Freedom,\u201d the guidelines state. \u201cThis means open access to safe, legal, affordable abortion and birth control for all people, regardless of income, location or education. \u201d \u201cWe must have the power to control our bodies and be free from gender norms, expectations and stereotypes,\u201d it reads. Although organizers hail the event as a \u201cgrassroots effort,\u201d in reality, it is a massive   choreographed assembly paid for by major donors such as George Soros and Planned Parenthood, \u201chelmed by four national   and a national coordinating committee who are working around the clock to pull it all together. \u201d The list of \u201cPartners\u201d of the event reads like a who\u2019s who of radical feminism, and includes Catholics for Choice, the Center for Reproductive Rights, The Coalition of Nasty Women, EMILY\u2019s List, Free the Nipple, GLAAD, NARAL   America Foundation, National Abortion Federation, National Center for Lesbian Rights, National Institute for Reproductive Health, Pussyhat Project, and, of course, Planned Parenthood. The usual Hollywood shills for the abortion lobby will also be out in full force. Planned Parenthood advocate Scarlett Johansson, for instance, announced, \u201cI am marching on Washington to let our next president know that we, men and women alike, will not stand down or be silenced and will fight to protect our bodies and our choices. \u201d Actress Debra Messing of Will  Grace went further still, saying, \u201cAn attack on Planned Parenthood is an attack on all American women. \u201d Conspicuous by their absence will be the tens of millions of \u201cAmerican women\u201d who believe in the right to life for all, including the unborn.
