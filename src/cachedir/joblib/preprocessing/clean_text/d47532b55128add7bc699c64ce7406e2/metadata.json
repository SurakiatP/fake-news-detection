[\u201cOn a personal note, a lot of ya\u2019ll hurt me. You really did. I didn\u2019t expect the backlash to be so fierce,\u201d Harvey told his radio audience Monday.  \u201cChange can only happen when we sit at the table. If we sit at the table, then we can have a say as to what\u2019s to be eaten on the menu,\u201d Harvey said defending his decision to work with Trump. \u201cI have an obligation to take a seat at the table when invited. \u201d Harvey met with   Donald Trump on Friday at Trump Tower in Manhattan, telling reporters, \u201cI stepped from behind my microphone and I came and talked to the guy who is going to be the 45th president. \u201d The Family Feud host said he found Trump \u201cboth congenial and sincere,\u201d and announced plans to partner with Trump\u2019s Department of Housing and Urban Development nominee Dr. Ben Carson on restoring America\u2019s inner cities. But not everyone was supportive of Harvey\u2019s efforts to join forces with the incoming administration.

But when you\u2019re at the table, you should have experts at the table,\u201d Hill added. \u201cYou should have people who can challenge the president at the table. \u201d Harvey, however, said Monday \u201cIf I\u2019m going to keep getting stabbed at, then at least while you\u2019re stabbing me, you should understand my intent for taking the meeting in the first place. \u201d \u201cWhen I walked away, [I was] feeling like there might be a real chance for some positive to come out of what so many people think is all gloom and doom,\u201d he said.
