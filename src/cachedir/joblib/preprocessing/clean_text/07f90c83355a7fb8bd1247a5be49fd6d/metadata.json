Authorities did, however, note that the officer was unloading his 9mm Glock inside his home, directly behind the daycare, when it \u2018accidentally\u2019 discharged. \\nUp until that point, the staff and parents of the children at KinderCare probably thought that their children were safer being neighbors with a police officer. \\nDespite the officer clearly admitting to committing the misdemeanor offense of discharging a firearm within city limits, police have yet to charge him. \\n\u201cRight now our law department has it and they are reviewing it to see if there should be any charges,\u201d Police Chief Jack Davis said Wednesday morning. \\n\u201cIt was a very unfortunate incident for the school, as well as him,\u201d he added. \\nOutside of skating out of the misdemeanor charge so far, this officer also seems to be avoiding the felony offense of discharging a weapon in a gun-free school zone. \\nImagine for a moment that you were cleaning your pistol and all of the sudden, you accidentally squeeze off a round sending the deadly projectile through the wall of a daycare center, in a gun-free zone. \\nThere are two possible scenarios that would take place; the first one being that a SWAT team responds and you are killed. The second, less lethal result would be your inevitable arrest and charges of public endangerment, unlawful discharge, illegal use of a firearm, assault with a deadly weapon, terrorism, or a myriad of other charges associated with sending a deadly projectile hurling through walls and near the heads of innocent people. You would immediately be facing fines, jail time, probation, and firearms restrictions. \\nHowever, if you are a government agent who\u2019s trusted with carrying a deadly weapon into places others cannot, you needn\u2019t worry about any of those repercussions as this case will likely prove. \\nWhen the Akron Beacon Journal contacted the East Cleveland police department to inquire as to what would happen to this officer, they said their department was unaware of the incident. \\n\u201cWe\u2019re just grateful that nobody was hurt,\u201d KinderCare spokeswoman Colleen Moran told Ohio.com. So are we. \\nAs the gun controllers call for guns to be taken out of the hands of US citizens, what they really mean is they only want cops to have guns.
