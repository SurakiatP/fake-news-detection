Minds have been warped forever! \u201cWe can\u2019t have that, the truth being spewed out in public like that, people might think they actually have rights!\u201d \\n\u201cWhat will you do without freedom\u201d (William Wallace) I don\u2019t know about how others feel, but, in my mind, we\u2019re quite far from true freedom. You need to dispose rubbish? Better have your permit. Need to take a shit, better get your permit. Birth and Death certificates log you in and out and you\u2019re property. \\nThe dehumanizing of the species is well underway. Your number is 8675309.21 Like rats in a cage, we eat, shit, and breathe. Our cage is our own minds, manipulated beyond measure by unscrupulous bastards with a greed that can never be quenched. It\u2019s unfortunate that there are those that exist with a superiority complex and think their shit don\u2019t stink. That superiority complex leads to wars. We\u2019re the most advanced, civilized monkeys on the planet, but you steal my bananas, we\u2019re goin\u2019 to war. \\nA Confederate Flag? They get their undies in a bundy over a Confederate Flag? \\nYep, we must lie to our children and not tell them our true history. We must protect them from the psychological trauma of the truth! \u201cYes Jimmy, everything\u2019s lollypops and rainbows!\u201d\u201cHere, take some more Ritalin and STFU!\u201d \\nPharmacy regulars, it seems most parents on some damned drug too. \u201cWell, I gotta get the kids pills, I may as well get some for me, as long as I\u2019m there.\u201d Hey Dr. Feelgood, what\u2019s up? \\n\u201cMother\u2019s Little Helpers\u201d told the story decades ago. Now, snoop in anyones \u201cMedicine Chest\u201d and you\u2019ll discover an array of concoctions, herbals, stimulants, downers, mood enhancers, sleeping pills, wake up pills, stay awake pills, two in the morning, two at noon, two at bedtime, repeat every day until your dead. \\nYou want to live forever? I don\u2019t. I suspect bigger and better things await my arrival, at least, I hope so.'"}, "time": 1742564245.21365}
