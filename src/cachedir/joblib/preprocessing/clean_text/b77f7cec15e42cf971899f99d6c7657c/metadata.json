Its other two hosts, professional bakers Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry, have not announced if they intend to remain with the program when it moves to its new home, Channel 4. The Guardian reported on Monday that none of the four hosts were consulted during the negotiations. Channel 4 announced the move in a statement on Monday that said it had signed a deal with the show\u2019s producers, Love Productions, and will begin broadcasting the show in 2017. Both companies emphasized that Britons would still be able to watch the show without cost, but they will now have to contend with commercials. The BBC is publicly funded and does not have commercials, nor does the show\u2019s American home, PBS, where it is shown under the name \u201cThe Great British Baking Show. \u201d It is also available in the United States on Netflix. \u201cWe believe we\u2019ve found the perfect new home for \u2018Bake Off,\u2019 \u201d Richard McKerrow, the creative director of Love Productions, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s a public service,    broadcaster for whom Love Productions have produced high quality and highly successful programmes for more than a decade. \u201d Mr. McKerrow added that he believed Channel 4 would \u201cprotect and nurture\u201d the show \u201cfor many years to come. \u201d Jay Hunt, the chief creative officer of Channel 4, said she was \u201cdelighted\u201d that the deal would \u201ckeep this much loved show on    television. \u201d \u201cThe Great British Bake Off\u201d follows a group of amateur bakers as they execute increasingly complex recipes and is noteworthy among reality shows because its contestants are uniformly pleasant and likable. It is devoid of both the interpersonal drama and the cash prize that are the hallmarks of American reality TV. There are no screaming fights, just spongecake. The show has had a significant cultural impact in Britain and beyond. Its diverse,   cast has been heralded as a microcosm of modern Britain as it wrestles with questions of national identity in the wake of its surprise vote in June to leave the European Union. More than 10 million viewers in the United Kingdom watched its season premiere last month, and it has spawned a fleet of spinoffs in other countries. Many viewers in Britain reacted negatively to the news that an iconic TV show was leaving the country\u2019s iconic national broadcaster. Julia MacFarlane, a BBC producer, shared a picture on Twitter of the broadcaster\u2019s newly redecorated cafeteria, whose walls were adorned with the image of two of the hosts of \u201cBake Off. \u201d Those viewers were not alone. The BBC made no secret of its displeasure with the move. Shortly before Channel 4 announced it had acquired the rights to the show, the BBC issued what amounted to a plea to \u201cBake Off\u201d producers, saying in a statement that it had \u201cgrown and nurtured the programme over seven series and created the huge hit it is today. \u201d In their joint statement, Ms. Perkins and Ms. Giedroyc agreed with that sentiment. \u201cWe made no secret of our desire for the show to remain where it was,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe BBC nurtured the show from its infancy and helped give it its distinctive warmth and charm, growing it from an audience of two million to nearly fifteen at its peak. \u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve had the most amazing time on Bake Off, and have loved seeing it rise and rise like a pair of yeasted Latvian baps,\u201d they added. \u201cWe wish all the future bakers every success. \u201d In the end, the BBC said its disagreement with Love Productions came down to money. \u201cWe made a very strong offer to keep the show but we are a considerable distance apart on the money. The BBC\u2019s resources are not infinite,\u201d the BBC statement said. \u201cGBBO is a quintessentially BBC programme. We hope Love Productions change their mind so that Bake Off can stay ad free on BBC One. \u201d It was a rare moment of drama for a show noted for its placidness. When asked via email to comment on the news that \u201cBake Off\u201d had found a new home, a BBC spokesperson replied tersely, \u201cWe\u2019re not adding anything to the statement. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628532.876449}
