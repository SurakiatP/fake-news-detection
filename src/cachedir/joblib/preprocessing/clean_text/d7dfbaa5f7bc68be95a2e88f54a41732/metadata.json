Terror attack outside #FinsburyPark mosque. Police must urgently review security for all mosques #StandTogether,  \u2014   Diane Abbott (@HackneyAbbott) June 19, 2017,  Abbott\u2019s rush to judgement on this occasion stands in sharp contrast to her pronouncements following the Islamist terror attacks at Westminster Bridge, Manchester Arena, and London Bridge. The Westminster Bridge attack, in which Muslim convert Khalid Masood ran down several pedestrians before leaping from his car and stabbing a police constable to death on March 22nd, was not acknowledged as a terror attack until the following day in a tweet which pointed followers in the direction of a Guardian article emphasising the fact that the   migrant was \u201c \u201d. The following day, she released a statement in which she claimed it was \u201ctoo early now to debate the cause or motivation for this attack\u201d. She warned against \u201cwild assertions about this attack by people claiming to know what the police can\u2019t yet know, why this happened and who precisely was involved\u201d.

My thoughts go out to all those affected by the horrific incident in Manchester. Our emergency services have acted swiftly and bravely.  \u2014   Diane Abbott (@HackneyAbbott) May 23, 2017,  Abbott used similar language following the terror attack on London Bridge and Borough Market on June 3rd, in which   former child refugee Khuram Butt, bogus asylum seeker Rachid Redouane, and EU national Youssef Zaghba ran down and stabbed dozens of people in London. The Jeremy Corbyn ally was careful to refer to the terror attacks as \u201cincidents\u201d in two separate tweets. My thoughts are with all those affected by the incidents in London tonight,  \u2014   Diane Abbott (@HackneyAbbott) June 3, 2017,  Emerging news of frightening incidents tonight: London Bridge, Borough Market  Vauxhall.
