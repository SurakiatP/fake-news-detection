When asked if the Senate could approve the budget that slashes state park funding, McConnell said, \u201cProbably not. When we get to funding, the government obviously will be done on a bipartisan basis. It could be an opportunity for our Democratic friends to participate. They have chosen to not so far. And I for one, just speaking for myself, I think the diplomatic portion of the federal budget is very important. And you get results a lot cheaper frequently than you do on the defense side. So speaking for myself, I\u2019m not in favor of reducing what we call the 150 account to that extent. But we will sort all that out in the course of deciding how much were going to spend and how we\u2019re going to spend it. \u201d (  The Hill) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742561807.8178368}
