K. in the bloc\u2019s single market, but is warning that Britain couldn\u2019t pick and choose its conditions. [Brexit negotiations start on Monday, with question marks over Britain\u2019s approach after Prime Minister Theresa May lost her parliamentary majority in an election meant to strengthen her hand in the talks.  German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel told Sunday\u2019s Welt am Sonntag newspaper that \u201cmaybe there is now a chance to achieve a   \u2018soft Brexit. \u2019\u201d But he said staying in the single market would require Britain to accept EU workers\u2019 freedom of movement. It also would have to accept the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, \u201cor at least a joint court that is staffed by Europeans and Britons\u201d and in principle follows the ECJ\u2019s rulings, Gabriel said. For many Brexit advocates, those conditions would be impossible to accept as last year\u2019s referendum campaign focused on getting back control over laws and immigration from the EU. Gabriel said \u201cit would naturally be best if Britain didn\u2019t leave at all. \u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like that at the moment,\u201d he added. \u201cBut we want to keep the door open for the British. \u201d The   Social Democrat strongly criticized May\u2019s Conservatives, saying that they \u201cplayed with the emotions of citizens in Britain, told fake news about Europe and left people unclear about what consequences this would all have. \u201d Referring to the \u201cdifficult, even impossible situation\u201d created by the indecisive election, he added: \u201chere, those who created such chaos would have long since gone. \u201d \u201cWe will negotiate fairly,\u201d Gabriel was quoted as saying. \u201cAnd fair means that we want to keep the British as close as possible to the EU  \u2014   but never at the price that we divide the remaining 27 EU states. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561865.2059333}
