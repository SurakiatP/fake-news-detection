Allen is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and serves on the board of advisors of The Washington Institute for Near East Policy (WINEP), an American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) cutout. The retired four-star general attracted a lot of attention earlier this year when he delivered a forceful endorsement of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention. \\nLister was formerly a visiting fellow at the Brookings Doha Center in Qatar and is now a senior fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based Middle East Institute, which describes itself as \u201can unbiased source of information and analysis\u201d on the Middle East and partners with corporations such as Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, Chevron, ExxonMobil and Saudi Aramco. Lister has dismissed conflict of interest allegations by saying his contact with the Syrian opposition \u201chad absolutely nothing to do with Qatar\u201d and stressing that his \u201cwork on this is 100% funded by Western govts.\u201d[1] \\nAllen and Lister harshly criticize U.S. \u201cinaction\u201d in Syria in their October 21 op-ed, emphasizing that \u201cthe Assad clique and its backers must be brought to account before it is too late.\u201d \\nThe authors\u2019 case rests on the premise that U.S. policy in Syria has been characterized by inaction and \u201chas never sought to decisively influence the tactical situation on the ground.\u201d[2] \\nSince the beginning of the conflict, advocates of greater U.S. military involvement have tried to promote the myth of \u201cU.S. inaction in Syria.\u201d \\nEven after U.S. media disclosed the existence of a CIA weapons supply and training program in summer 2012, efforts to promote this myth continued unabated. \\nIn early 2013, about eight months after The Washington Post first reported that the United States is coordinating the flow of weapons to the so-called \u201cSyrian rebels,\u201d[3] the editorial board of The Washington Post warned of the \u201cconsequences of U.S. inaction in Syria,\u201d accusing the Obama administration of not doing enough to support the \u201crebels.\u201d[4] \\nNeither The Washington Post nor any other major media outlet in the United States has been willing to publicize the true extent of U.S. covert operations in Syria, which started as early as April-May 2011.[5] \\nFrom the very beginning, U.S. policy sought to decisively influence the tactical situation on the ground in favor of the foreign-backed anti-Assad opposition. But instead of exposing the U.S.-led war on Syria, the media has been feeding into the false narrative of \u201cU.S. inaction in Syria.\u201d \\nReferring to this narrative, Allen and Lister call for accelerating and broadening the provision of lethal and nonlethal assistance to \u201cvetted moderate opposition groups.\u201d[6] \\nThe United States\u2019 vetting process of militias plays a central role in all of Lister\u2019s policy proposals.[7] What Lister fails to mention is that this vetting process consists of nothing more than trace searches in old databases and half-hearted interviews. U.S. Special Forces soldiers on the ground in Turkey and Jordan told SOFREP that many \u201crebels\u201d had sympathies with terrorist groups but knew exactly how to sell themselves during such interviews.[8] \\nAs U.S. Special Forces soldiers on the ground voice their indignation over a mission that nobody believes in because they are just training the next generation of jihadis, Allen and Lister want to increase U.S. assistance to \u201cvetted\u201d groups in order to \u201csave Aleppo,\u201d which has become the focal point of the Syrian conflict: \\n\u201cFor a start, the United States must save Aleppo. Damascus, Moscow and Tehran are razing the city to prepare for an eventual ground assault. As both the CIA and Pentagon have concluded, an opposition loss in Aleppo would severely undermine the United States\u2019 counterterrorism objectives in Syria. The city\u2019s symbolism and strategic value are unmatched, and allowing it to fall would dramatically empower extremist narratives. Groups linked to al-Qaeda would reap the rewards of our shortcomings.\u201d[9] \\nAt the beginning of October, just hours after the U.S. suspended talks with Russia over Syria, The Washington Post reported that the CIA and the Joint Chiefs of Staff are pressuring President Obama to approve \u201ckinetic actions\u201d against Syrian government forces, arguing that an opposition loss in Aleppo \u201cwould undermine America\u2019s counterterrorism goals in Syria.\u201d[10] \\nGiven the fact that the opposition in \u201crebel-held\u201d eastern Aleppo is led by Jabhat al-Nusra, this argument seems rather dubious.[11] Despite rebranding itself as \u201cJabhat Fatah al-Sham\u201d and supposedly cutting its ties with al-Qaeda, the group is still considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations. Another group present in eastern Aleppo, Ahrar al-Sham, is also closely tied to al-Qaeda.[12] \\nIt is not exactly clear why \u201cgroups linked to al-Qaeda would reap the rewards\u201d if groups linked to al-Qaeda are defeated in eastern Aleppo or why their defeat \u201cwould severely undermine the United States\u2019 counterterrorism objectives in Syria.\u201d \\nIf Allen and Lister want to stop empowering extremist narratives, they could start by revising their portrayal of the battle of Aleppo and the Syrian conflict in general. \\nNusra and its allies are not defending civilians in eastern Aleppo, as frequently claimed, but holding them hostage in order to maintain a foothold in the strategic city, which was invaded by \u201crebels\u201d in summer 2012 after refusing to join the uprising. \\nAs soon as Syrian government forces and their allies first managed to encircle the \u201crebel-held\u201d areas of Aleppo in July of this year, they announced the opening of humanitarian passages for civilians and surrendering fighters. According to the pro-opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), only \u201caround 12 people managed to use the Bustan al-Qasr corridor before rebel groups reinforced security measures and prevented families from approaching the corridors.\u201d[13] \\nInstead of telling the \u201crebel groups\u201d in eastern Aleppo to stop holding civilians hostage, the United States and its allies supported a major offensive led and organized by al-Nusra to break the siege and \u201cput some pressure back on Russia and Iran.\u201d \\nOne Western diplomat tried to play down the outside support, saying: \\n\u201cThe rebels\u2019 problem has never been a lack of weapons. This was internally planned, and it succeeded not because of outside support but because Fatah al-Sham and the other jihadi groups are incredibly disciplined, with plenty of guys willing to blow themselves up at the front.\u201d[14] \\nNusra, Ahrar al-Sham and other involved groups referred to the Aleppo offensive as the \u201cIbrahim al-Youssef battle,\u201d a reference to the Syrian army officer who led the Aleppo Artillery School Massacre in the late 1970s. \\nIn June 1979, Ibrahim al-Youssef and members of a Muslim Brotherhood splinter group killed dozens of Alawite cadets after separating them from their Sunni colleagues. During the July-August Aleppo offensive, a spokesman for the Nusra-led forces said they would continue what Ibrahim al-Youssef had started and kill the Alawites.[15] \\nIbrahim al-Youssef\u2019s son Yasser is a political representative for the U.S.-vetted \u201crebel group\u201d Harakat Nour al-Din al-Zinki, which participates in the battle of Aleppo and lately joined the Nusra-led military alliance Jaish al-Fatah. Zinki is probably best known for beheading a child captive on camera. The group reportedly lost U.S. backing in August or September of last year and was in talks with the U.S. over the restoration of its support when the incriminating footage emerged.[16] \\nYasser al-Youssef has become the media\u2019s go-to-guy for information about the \u201crebels\u201d in and around Aleppo. After the Syrian government and its Russian allies recently announced a unilateral cease-fire to allow civilians and surrendering fighters once again to leave eastern Aleppo, Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted Yasser al-Youssef as saying that opposition fighters wanted \u201cnothing to do\u201d with the Russian initiative and asking: \u201cWho are they to decide to displace the Syrian people who rebelled against the dictator Assad?\u201d[17] \\nMeanwhile, the Associated Press (AP) quoted Zinki\u2019s al-Youssef as saying that the opposition had agreed to the initiative to evacuate wounded and allow in aid. According to al-Youssef, the evacuations didn\u2019t materialize because the Syrian government and Russia gave no assurances the wounded would not face arrest.[18] \\nAs both sides were blaming each other for the breakdown, Western journalists on the ground confirmed that \u201crebels\u201d were firing on the checkpoints and exit corridors, making it extremely dangerous for anyone to leave eastern Aleppo.[19] \\nWhen Allen and Lister say \u201cthe United States must save Aleppo,\u201d they are not referring to the civilians in eastern Aleppo who are being held hostage by the \u201crebels\u201d or to the civilians in western Aleppo who are being killed by indiscriminate \u201crebel\u201d shelling. They are referring to al-Nusra, Ahrar al-Sham, Zinki and other \u201crebel groups\u201d in eastern Aleppo. \\nOn the same day the Allen-Lister op-ed was published, Lister gleefully announced on Twitter that Ahrar al-Sham, Zinki and allied militias are preparing another offensive to break the siege of Aleppo. Nusra will of course join the fight, but \u201cthe impetus and most of the planning for this offensive largely excluded\u201d the terrorist group, as the PR disaster during the July-August offensive is still fresh on everyone\u2019s mind. \u201cRegional states have provided substantial support to buttress the offensive,\u201d according to Lister.[20] \\nU.S. allies Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar already provided substantial support to buttress the July-August Aleppo offensive \u2013 with the full blessing of the United States.[21] Washington\u2019s primary objective was to put some pressure back on Russia and Iran, not to save civilians. As before, the new offensive is going to prompt an adequate response from Russia and its allies, thereby prolonging the suffering of civilians in Aleppo. \\nWith current U.S. policy leading nowhere, the Obama administration is divided over Syria. Whereas the hawks around CIA director John Brennan and Defense Secretary Ashton Carter want to escalate the conflict, President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry are increasingly skeptical of such plans. \\nObama is reportedly not willing to approve plans to supply CIA-vetted militias with more powerful weapons. \\nOne senior U.S. official told The Washington Post that CIA-backed units are \u201cnot doing any better on the battlefield, they\u2019re up against a more formidable adversary, and they\u2019re increasingly dominated by extremists,\u201d raising the question of whether the program can accomplish anything beyond adding to the carnage in Syria.[22] \\nThe Lister-approved vetting process is apparently not working. \\nMoreover, the sceptics in the administration fear that the new weaponry could end up killing Russian military personnel and they want to avoid risking a confrontation with Russia. \\nBut not everyone shares this opinion. \\nDue to his reluctance to escalate the conflict in Syria, Obama has alienated Washington\u2019s foreign policy establishment, which favors more U.S. military action, including cruise missile strikes on Syrian government forces.[23] \\nThat is also a key point of the Allen-Lister plan. \\nWhen The Washington Post first reported on U.S. plans to target Syrian government forces, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major-General Igor Konashenkov stressed that Russian troops were now widely deployed across Syria, implying that any such attack would run the risk of killing Russian soldiers.[24] \\nAllen and Lister are of course aware of this risk. Explaining how to punish cease-fire violations by Syrian government forces with U.S. military action, they note in passing: \\n\u201cWe should expect the possible intentional co-mingling of Syrian and Russian forces and assets as a deterrent. While this may complicate targeting strategies, we should not miss the opportunity to hit offending Syrian elements and units, while sustaining counter-Islamic State operations elsewhere.\u201d[25] \\nNeither Allen and Lister nor Washington\u2019s foreign policy elite seem to mind risking a direct military confrontation with Russia. But President Obama and other sceptics in the administration don\u2019t want to start World War III over Syria, as one senior administration official who is involved in Middle East policy emphasized: \\n\u201cYou can\u2019t pretend you can go to war against Assad and not go to war against the Russians.\u201d[26] \\nWhile the war party in Washington is waiting for Obama to leave office, Russia is preparing for a showdown in Syria with the largest surface deployment since the end of the Cold War.[27] \\nAs Allen and Lister point out, the war party \u201ccannot wait for a new administration in Washington\u201d because \u201cevents are moving too quickly.\u201d[28] They may have lost Aleppo by the time Hillary Clinton takes office.[28] \\nSo Obama might have to deal with more \u201caccidents,\u201d such as the September 17 Deir Ezzor attack, during his last months as President of the United States.
