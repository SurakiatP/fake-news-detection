A growing body of evidence suggests that high blood pressure may impair children\u2019s cognitive skills, reducing their ability to remember, pay attention and organize facts. In the most comprehensive study to date, published on Thursday in The Journal of Pediatrics, 75 children ages 10 to 18 with untreated high blood pressure performed worse on several tests of cognitive function, compared with 75 peers who had normal blood pressure. The differences were subtle, and the new research does not prove that high blood pressure diminishes cognitive skills in children. Still, the findings set off alarm bells among some experts. \u201cThis study really shows there are some differences,\u201d said Dr. David B. Kershaw, the director of pediatric nephrology at C. S. Mott Children\u2019s Hospital at the University of Michigan, who was not involved with the research. \u201cThis was not just random chance. \u201d Dr. Marc B. Lande, a professor of pediatric nephrology at the University of Rochester Medical Center, and his colleagues had children tested at four sites in three states, matching those with and without high blood pressure by age, maternal education, race, obesity levels and other factors. The researchers excluded children with learning disabilities and sleep problems, which can affect cognitive skills. Children with elevated blood pressure performed worse than their peers on tests of memory, processing speed and verbal skills, the researchers found. But all the scores were still in the normal range. Because of increased obesity, elevated blood pressure, also called hypertension, is no longer rare in children, though it is underdiagnosed. In a recent survey, about 3. 5 percent of 14, 187 children ages 3 to 18 had hypertension. \u201cMost people don\u2019t understand that cardiovascular risk factors  \u2014   in this case, hypertension  \u2014   can affect thinking and memory, and certainly they don\u2019t think there could be an effect in childhood,\u201d said Dr. Kristine Yaffe, a professor of psychiatry, neurology and epidemiology at the University of California, San Francisco, who has researched the effects of cardiovascular risk factors on cognition. Dr. Lande and his colleagues noted that children with high blood pressure tended to have other risk factors that might negatively affect cognition, including insulin resistance and obstructive sleep apnea. Children who had a formal diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea were excluded from the new study, but some adolescents with poor sleep participated. Dr. Lande said the study found \u201cthat the presence of hypertension made the effect of poor sleep on cognition even worse. \u201d Lower scores on cognitive tests do not necessarily indicate that a child is struggling in everyday life, experts cautioned. \u201cYes, there are certain differences, but what they mean in terms of life functioning isn\u2019t clear,\u201d said Dr. Julie R. Ingelfinger, a professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and a senior consultant in nephrology at Massachusetts General Hospital. But, she added, \u201cWe know from other studies that problems with memory, attention and cognitive function have a lot to do with how well you do in your job and at school. \u201d Children may be uniquely susceptible to cognitive deficits, Dr. Kershaw said. \u201cOne of my concerns is, if you have high blood pressure and you\u2019re 10 to 18 years old, it may impact your cognitive function more than if you\u2019re 40 or 50,\u201d he said. The areas of the brain that control executive function mature until a person\u2019s early 20s. So the idea is that perhaps hypertension could hinder that function, Dr. Kershaw said. Observational studies have shown that having high blood pressure in one\u2019s early 40s to 60s increases the risk of cognitive decline later in life. Clinical trials have not shown, however, that controlling high blood pressure with drugs or lifestyle changes can prevent cognitive problems. More research is needed to decipher whether treating children who have high blood pressure with dietary changes, exercise or medication could improve their cognitive ability. The work is already underway: The 75 children with hypertension in the latest study are being treated and followed for a year. The last child will finish the study early next year, Dr. Lande said. \u201cThen we\u2019ll be able to know if subtle neurocognitive differences between hypertensive kids and the controls go away with treatment or not,\u201d he said. Dr. Ingelfinger applauded the \u201ccarefully done\u201d research, but said she was more interested in seeing the   research. \u201cThe most important thing is, if blood pressure is controlled, do these cognitive changes go away?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742562449.942629}
