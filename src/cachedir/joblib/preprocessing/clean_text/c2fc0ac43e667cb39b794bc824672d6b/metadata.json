President Obama has offered Israel the largest package of military aid the U. S. has ever proposed to any nation, but the Israelis have asked for a more generous plan. The package, possibly more than $40 billion over 10 years, is meant to replace the current $3 billion a year, which expires in 2018. Israel says the Iran nuclear deal has intensified its security challenges. _____ 2. \u201cLucifer in the flesh. \u201d \u201cI have never worked with a more miserable son of a bitch in my life. \u201d That was the former House Speaker John Boehner, revealing the depth of his antipathy for the Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz. Mr. Cruz responded that Mr. Boehner had \u201callowed his inner Trump to come out. \u201d He said the comments validated his own standing as a maverick in Washington. _____ 3. Donald Trump\u2019s sweep of five primaries this week added so significantly to his delegate count that he may not even need to win Indiana next week. He is estimated to have won 110 of the 118 pledged delegates at stake on Tuesday, and appears to have claimed about 40 of Pennsylvania\u2019s unpledged delegates. Check out the numbers in our updated delegate counter. _____ 4. One of our   articles today looks deeply at President Obama\u2019s handling of the economy. In a series of conversations with one of our top business reporters, Mr. Obama reveals frustration with Republican criticism that ignores gains, including the longest period of sustained job growth on record. When people hear \u201cthat things are terrible all the time,\u201d Mr. Obama said, \u201cthen people will start absorbing that. \u201d _____ 5. Round 1 of the N. F.

Our live coverage is here. _____ 6. Two female journalists have jolted the sports world with a   video revealing the kind of messages they regularly receive  \u2014   read aloud by male friends staggered by the viciousness. Examples: \u201cYou need to be hit in the head with a hockey puck and killed,\u201d and \u201cI hope you get raped again. \u201d Our columnist, who has received many similar messages, asks: \u201cSo much hate. And for what?\u201d _____ 7. Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York is under scrutiny in five investigations by federal, state and local agencies. Most involve   linked to the mayor, his election campaign or a nonprofit group connected with him. \u201cI can\u2019t recall any other sort of perfect storm like this, coming from all those different angles,\u201d a historian said of the welter of inquiries. _____ 8. China became the latest country to sharply restrict the operations of nongovernmental groups, fearing their power to undermine authoritarian rule. A new law requires some 7, 000 such groups to find an official sponsor and register with the police  \u2014   serious obstacles for those that promote workers\u2019 rights, ethnic equality or religious freedom. _____ 9. That\u2019s it for DreamWorks Animation, maker of \u201cKung Fu Panda,\u201d \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d and \u201cShrek. \u201d Hollywood\u2019s smallest publicly traded studio ended 12 years of turbulent independence with a deal to sell itself to Comcast\u2019s giant NBCUniversal.

Apple logged a second day of losses, helping drag down tech stocks, and energy stocks tumbled despite a gain in the price of oil. _____ 10. Syria\u2019s partial truce shattered as the northern city of Aleppo plunged back into   war. Government airstrikes destroyed a hospital, and rebels counterattacked with mortars. Vice President Joe Biden traveled to neighboring Iraq, hoping to pull that country\u2019s political leadership out of its latest crisis and strengthen the fight against the Islamic State. _____ 11. One of the first women to graduate from the Army\u2019s elite Ranger school is now qualified to lead troops into combat. Capt. Kristen Griest, above right, finished a final course, breaking another barrier to full service. \u201cWe are at a time and a place in the world where we need to have the best leaders from everywhere,\u201d an Army spokesman said, \u201cand that includes women. \u201d _____ 12. Finally, Happy Ed Balls Day. Britain has been celebrating its Twitter joke for five years, ever since a political official named Ed Balls inadvertently posted his name on the platform. Mr. Balls, pictured above in a typically   moment last year, has taken the joke in stride. \u201cIt\u2019s as incomprehensible as the Internet and social media can get, but people enjoy it,\u201d he said. \u201cI shrug my shoulders. \u201d _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.
