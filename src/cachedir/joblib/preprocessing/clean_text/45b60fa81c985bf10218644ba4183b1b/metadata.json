And, its London bureau chief, Nikolay A. Bogachikhin, jokes, \u201cWe overlook MI5 and we\u2019re near MI6,\u201d Britain\u2019s domestic and foreign intelligence agencies. Mr. Bogachikhin was poking fun at the charge from Western governments, American and European, that RT is an agent of Kremlin policy and a tool directly used by President Vladimir V. Putin to undermine Western democracies  \u2014   meddling in the recent American presidential election and, European security officials say, trying to do the same in the Netherlands, France and Germany, all of which vote later this year. But the West is not laughing. Even as Russia insists that RT is just another global network like the BBC or France 24, albeit one offering \u201calternative views\u201d to the   news media, many Western countries regard RT as the slickly produced heart of a broad, often covert disinformation campaign designed to sow doubt about democratic institutions and destabilize the West. Western attention focused on RT when the Obama administration and United States intelligence agencies judged with \u201chigh confidence\u201d in January that Mr. Putin had ordered a campaign to \u201cundermine public faith in the U. S. democratic process,\u201d discredit Hillary Clinton through the hacking of Democratic Party internal emails and provide support for Donald J. Trump, who as a candidate said he wanted to improve relations with Russia. The agencies issued a report saying the attack was carried out through the targeted use of real information, some open and some hacked, and the creation of false reports, or \u201cfake news,\u201d broadcast on   news media like RT and its sibling, the internet news agency Sputnik. These reports were then amplified on social media, sometimes by computer \u201cbots\u201d that send out thousands of Facebook and Twitter messages. To many Americans, the impression that RT is an instrument of Russian meddling was reinforced when its programming suddenly interrupted  \u2019s online coverage of the House of Representatives in January. (  later called it a technical error, not a hacking.) Watching RT can be a dizzying experience. Hard news and   graphics mix with interviews from all sorts of people: well known and obscure, left and right. They include favorites like Julian Assange of WikiLeaks and Noam Chomsky, the liberal critic of Western policies odd voices like the actress Pamela Anderson and cranks who think Washington is the source of all evil in the world. But if there is any unifying character to RT, it is a deep skepticism of Western and American narratives of the world and a fundamental defensiveness about Russia and Mr. Putin. Analysts are sharply divided about the influence of RT. Pointing to its minuscule ratings numbers, many caution against overstating its impact. Yet focusing on ratings may miss the point, says Peter Pomerantsev, who wrote a book three years ago that described Russia\u2019s use of television for propaganda. \u201cRatings aren\u2019t the main thing for them,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are campaigns for financial, political and media influence. \u201d RT and Sputnik propel those campaigns by helping create the fodder for thousands of fake news propagators and providing another outlet for hacked material that can serve Russian interests, said Ben Nimmo, who studies RT for the Atlantic Council. Whatever its impact, RT is unquestionably a case study in the complexity of modern propaganda. It is both a slick modern television network, dressed up with great visuals and stylish presenters, and a content farm that helps feed the European far right. Viewers find it difficult to discern exactly what is journalism and what is propaganda, what may be \u201cfake news\u201d and what is real but presented with a strong slant. A recent evening featured reports of Britain refusing to condemn human rights violations in Bahrain and a \u201cmainstream media firestorm\u201d over Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019s chats with the Russian ambassador to the United States. Other reports included the \u201cliberation\u201d of Palmyra by the Syrian Army with \u201cthe support of the Russian Air Force\u201d an interview with former British ambassador to Syria and a United States critic, Peter Ford and a report about a London professor decrying the fall in British living standards. There are \u201cclickbait\u201d videos on RT\u2019s website and stranger pieces, too, like one about a petition to ban the financier George Soros from America for supposedly trying to \u201cdestabilize\u201d the country and \u201cdrown it\u201d with immigrants for a \u201cglobalist goal. \u201d Mr. Bogachikhin and Anna Belkina, RT\u2019s head of communications in Moscow, insist it is absurd to lump together RT\u2019s effort to provide \u201calternative views to the mainstream media\u201d with the phenomena of fake news and social media propaganda. \u201cThere\u2019s an hysteria about RT,\u201d Ms. Belkina said. \u201cRT becomes a shorthand for everything. \u201d For example, she says, while RT was featured heavily in the American intelligence report, it was largely in a   annex (of a   report) that was written more than four years ago, in December 2012, a fact revealed only in a footnote on Page 6. She flatly denies any suggestion that RT seeks to meddle in democratic elections anywhere. \u201cThe kind of scrutiny we\u2019re under  \u2014   we check everything. \u201d For RT and its viewers, the outlet is a refreshing alternative to what they see as complacent Western elitism and   representing what the Russian Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov recently called a \u201c  world order. \u201d With its slogan, created by a Western ad agency, of \u201cQuestion More,\u201d RT is trying to fill a niche, Ms. Belkina said. \u201cWe want to complete the picture rather than add to the echo chamber of mainstream news that\u2019s how we find an audience. \u201d Nearly all the mainstream media came out against Mr. Trump during the campaign and much of the news coverage about him was negative, she said. \u201cThis is why we exist,\u201d Ms. Belkina said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to watch RT to hear alternative voices. You might not agree with them, but it\u2019s important to try to understand where they\u2019re coming from and why. \u201d A French legislator, Nicolas Dhuicq, who has appeared on RT and went to   Crimea in 2015 as part of a delegation of French legislators, said that RT\u2019s aim was \u201cto make the voice of Russia heard, to make the Russian point of view on the world heard. \u201d Still, Mr. Dhuicq said, \u201cthe impact of RT, in my opinion, is very low. \u201d He added: \u201cThere is enormous paranoia when we imagine that RT will change the face of the world, influence national or other elections. \u201d Afshin Rattansi, who hosts a talk show three times a week called \u201cGoing Underground,\u201d came to RT in 2013 after working at the BBC, CNN, Bloomberg, Al Jazeera and Iran\u2019s Press TV. \u201cUnlike at the BBC and CNN, I was never told what to say at RT,\u201d he said. There have been two cases of RT announcers quitting because of what they said was pressure to toe a Kremlin line, especially on Ukraine, but not in London, Mr. Rattansi said. Michael McFaul, a Stanford professor who was the United States ambassador to Russia during the Obama years, said that RT should not be lightly dismissed. \u201cThere is a demand in certain countries for this alternative view, an appetite, and we arrogant Americans shouldn\u2019t just think that no one cares. \u201d But there is a considerably darker view, too. For critics, RT and Sputnik are simply tools of a sophisticated Russian propaganda machine, created by the Kremlin to push its foreign policy, defend its aggression in Ukraine and undermine confidence in democracy, NATO and the world as we have known it. Robert Pszczel, who ran NATO\u2019s information office in Moscow and watches Russia and the western Balkans for NATO, said that RT and Sputnik were not meant for domestic consumption, unlike the BBC or CNN. Over time, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s more about hard power and disinformation. \u201d The Kremlin doesn\u2019t care \u201cif you agree with Russian policy or think Putin is wonderful, so long as it does the job  \u2014   you start having doubts, and of 10 outrageous points you take on one or two,\u201d he said. \u201cA bit of mud will always stick. \u201d Probably more important than RT, Mr. Pszczel said, are Sputnik and local language outlets sponsored by Russia, like the Slovak magazine \u201cZem a Vek,\u201d known for its conspiracy theories. Sputnik is the largest source of raw news in the Balkans, he said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s a free product in local languages. \u201d And \u201cthen they set up some friendly association, at some small university, which holds seminars, and then a number of strange websites start promoting the product, like an industrial marketing operation. \u201d But RT is also helpful in another traditional Moscow effort: making friends with useful people, and not just Mr. Assange, Mr. Pomerantsev said. \u201cRT made Mike Flynn feel good after losing his job\u201d as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, he said, paying him a reported $40, 000 to come to RT\u2019s anniversary celebration in Moscow and sit near Mr. Putin. And Mr. Flynn, for a time, was national security adviser of the United States. Mr. Nimmo of the Atlantic Council noted RT\u2019s small reach in Germany, where Angela Merkel, a Putin critic, is facing a tough   fight, and where there are up to 3. 5 million Russian speakers. \u201cI strongly suspect that RT Deutsch has a trivial effect compared to   Germans watching Russian television,\u201d he said. Stefan Meister, who studies Russia and Central Europe for the German Council on Foreign Relations, agreed that \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t overestimate RT. The main success of the Russians is the link to social media through bots and a network of different sources. \u201d That network, he said, is \u201cincreasingly well organized, with more strategic and explicit links between sources and actors  \u2014   Russian domestic media, troll factories, RT, people in social networks and maybe also the security services. \u201d \u201cOpen societies are very vulnerable,\u201d Mr. Meister said, \u201cand it\u2019s cheaper than buying a new rocket. \u201d RT is part of the reality of the 21st century, Mr. Pomerantsev said. \u201cEveryone will do it soon. It\u2019s the world we have to live in. \u201d Hacks and leaks are much more disruptive, he said. \u201cIf you can take out the electrical grid in Ukraine, that\u2019s scary. It\u2019s hard to get too scared about Larry King on RT. \u201d Mr. Pomerantsev agrees with Ms. Belkina that RT is not inventing popular mistrust about Western democracy. \u201cThe Russians are about sowing mistrust about institutions that is there already, feeding it,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do we make our institutions more trustworthy?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742563586.6343338}
