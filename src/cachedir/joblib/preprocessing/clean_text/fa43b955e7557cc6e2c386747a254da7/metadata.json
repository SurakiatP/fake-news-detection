Bannon appeared before a packed house at CPAC on Thursday, rallying conservatives to support the president\u2019s agenda and taking shots at the media. [During a panel moderated by CPAC\u2019s Matt Schlapp, Bannon repeatedly referred to the media as the \u201copposition party.  \u201cWhen you look at the opposition party and how they portrayed the campaign, how they portrayed the transition, and now portraying the administration, it\u2019s always wrong,\u201d Bannon said. Bannon said Trump was \u201cmaniacally focused\u201d on implementing his agenda, which he detailed in all of his campaign speeches. The media, Bannon added, kept getting the story wrong  \u2014   particularly on the reported \u201cchaos\u201d in the administration. \u201cJust like they were dead wrong on the chaos of the campaign, and just like they were dead wrong on the chaos of the transition, they\u2019re absolutely dead wrong about what\u2019s going on today, because we have a team that\u2019s just grinding it through on what President Donald Trump promised the American people,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cAnd the mainstream media better understand something. All those promises are going to be implemented. \u201d The pair denied reports that they were at war with each other at the White House, cracking jokes about their differences. \u201cRegarding us two, I think the biggest misconception is everything that you\u2019re reading,\u201d Priebus said, prompting laughter from the crowd. Bannon praised Trump for ignoring all of the people who tried to tell him what his agenda should be, despite his campaign promises. \u201cHe was like, \u2018No, I promised the American people this, and this is the plan we\u2019re going to execute,\u2019\u201d Bannon said.'"}, "time": 1742562338.3903162}
