As such, we have unsuspended your account.\u201d \\nWhen it terminated the account on Wednesday, YouTube cited unspecified \u201crepeated or severe violations of our Terms of Use and/or Community Guidelines\u201d and declared the account \u201ccannot be restored.\u201d \\nThe YouTube decision to terminate Williams\u2019 account blocked the nine-minute feature \u201cBANISHED \u2013 The Untold Story of Danney Williams,\u201d which had received 1.2 million views since Williams posted it last week. Produced by filmmaker Joel Gilbert, it drew nearly 100,000 views per day and more than 1,000 viewer comments, with the overwhelming majority expressing support for Williams and outrage at the Clintons for not being willing to allow a DNA test to determine paternity. \\n\u201cMy YouTube account has been deleted, but the same video appears in 50 other places on YouTube alone,\u201d Williams said on his Facebook page after being notified of YouTube\u2019s decision to suspend the account. \u201c[YouTube] can\u2019t handle the truth! Please share #BillClintonSon.\u201d \\nTwitter also continued to allow Williams to post the \u201cBanished\u201d video on Danney Williams\u2019 page , but the Twitter link to YouTube displayed the message : \u201cThis video is no longer available because the YouTube account associated with this video has been terminated. Sorry about that.\u201d \\nThe video is still running on Danney Williams-Clinton\u2019s Facebook page , as well as on the YouTube channel operated by Gilbert. \\nAttempt to silence Danney Williams? \\nGilbert told WND on Wednesday he helped Williams file an online appeal form on YouTube asking why the account was suspended and demanding it be immediately reinstated.
