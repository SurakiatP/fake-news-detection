For six successive seasons, Riga and Tallinn  \u2014   the capitals of Latvia and Estonia  \u2014   have waged a feud over which was the site of the world\u2019s first decorated Christmas tree. Riga says it was first, in 1510. Tallinn claims a much earlier event, in 1441. More than civic pride is at stake.   travel has become extremely lucrative, especially in the   north, where there are no swaying palms to lure the  . And this year, the rivalry has taken on both an added urgency and a darker tinge. Simmering tensions between Russia and NATO and the faltering Russian economy have squeezed tourist traffic from what had been a prime source of vacationers. And the deadly attack on Berlin\u2019s Christmas market this week has raised fears that holiday markets, in general, may see fewer customers for their hot spiced wine and sugary treats. The Christmas tree spat began in 2010, when Latvians started an advertising campaign that claimed that Riga was the first, citing 1510 as the year when a mysterious and rambunctious medieval brotherhood known as the House of the Black Heads paraded through Riga carrying a constructed replica of a tree. They decorated it with fruits and candles, danced around it and then, a few days later, burned it to the ground. Hold on a second, responded the Estonians. They produced evidence that they claim showed that a similar festival had taken place at yet another lodge of the Black Heads, this one in Tallinn in 1441. And their festival, Estonians claim, involved a real tree. In fact, said the historian Juri Kuuskemaa, \u201cwe can be sure it was a spruce. \u201d Riga\u2019s mayor, Nils Usakovs, countered that claim by saying that the Estonians employ   tactics when it comes to the invention of the Christmas tree. It\u2019s an unusual war, fought with ornaments and historians. \u201cCities like Berlin had to wait until the 18th century before the first recorded public use of a Christmas tree,\u201d sniffed Mr. Kuuskemaa, 74, who is also the official Herald of Tallinn, a ceremonial position for which he often dons period garb. \u201cAnd for Paris and London, it didn\u2019t happen until the 19th century. Tallinn and Riga did it centuries before all the great metropolises of Europe. \u201d Whizzing round the capital the week before Christmas, Mayor Usakovs has taken on the work ethic of an elf. At the foot of a former landfill site that is being converted into a miniature ski resort, Mr. Usakovs lit his 48th Christmas tree of the season. He said the Christmas tree conflict, in reality, had reached a bit of a historical stalemate, as there was not enough contextual evidence to say for certain which city came first. But he doesn\u2019t care. \u201cAny time they say they were first, they have to mention also our city,\u201d he said. \u201cTourists from Germany or Belgium or Russia don\u2019t care for historical truth they care about cities with fancy Christmas trees, fancy Christmas markets. And when they read that there is also this battle between Tallinn and Riga  \u2014   it\u2019s fun!\u201d Nearly 200 miles north, in Tallinn, the chairman of the Estonian Parliament\u2019s defense committee, Hannes Hanso, stood beside the official parliamentary tree and declared that he took a policy of total nonrecognition when it came to Riga\u2019s claims. \u201cI didn\u2019t know Latvia had any claim to the first Christmas tree,\u201d he said with mock incredulity. Mr. Hanso also reminded Latvians not to get any ideas about who has the highest mountain either, as Estonia\u2019s Big Egg Mountain, at 1, 043 feet, was clearly higher than Latvia\u2019s Gaizinkalns, which reaches to a mere 1, 024 feet. Deployments of elves and reindeer have become the important weapons for Baltic nations to keep tourism levels steady over an otherwise dead season. It is especially important for Latvia and Estonia where, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council, tourism\u2019s direct contribution to gross domestic product is twice as big as it is in Lithuania, the southernmost Baltic state. In 2015, in Lithuania it amounted to 1. 7 percent, whereas in Latvia and Estonia it was 4. 1 percent and 3. 9 percent. With the weak ruble keeping many Russian tourists at home, Christmas profits are even more under threat. The Russian Orthodox Church celebrates the birth of Jesus in early January, so the holiday markets could stay open for weeks longer and still find eager crowds. Mariann Lugus, secretary general of the Estonian Travel and Tourism Association, said that Estonia had detected a dip in the number of Russian tourists in January 2014. A year later, though, after the Russian seizure of Crimea and the imposition of international sanctions, Russian tourism plummeted. Only about half as many Russians visited that January. Latvia, for some reason, has not experienced similar drops. \u201cWe don\u2019t know why that is,\u201d said Irena Riekstina, secretary general of the Association of Latvian Travel Agents and Tour Operators. \u201cThis is probably going to happen at some point and we need to prepare for this. \u201d Maximilien Lejeune, executive director at European Best Destinations, a travel website, said that the Christmas tree war could end up attracting even more visitors to both cities as they compete for other popular Christmas season destinations like Lapland and Norway  \u2014   especially if tourists become nervous about attending holiday markets in cities that have experienced terrorist attacks. Keen to compete is Remigijus Simasius, the mayor of Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania. Though his city has no claim to the first Christmas tree, he hopes to compete with even larger and more elaborate presentations. He threw down the gauntlet this year with a towering tree adorned with 50, 000 bulbs, which drew wide acclaim. His tree provoked rebukes from Russia, though, where several articles accused the Lithuanians of copying the tree\u2019s design from a smaller one in Moscow\u2019s Red Square. Lithuania may have no claim to the first Christmas tree, Mr. Simasius said in his annual Christmas speech, but it was important to think in broader terms. \u201cWe are part of the Baltic Sea region, and we are happy that this tradition is born in our region,\u201d he said. Mr. Lejeune said that \u201cin troubled times, people like to have landmarks,\u201d and that\u2019s what European holiday markets have become. \u201cPeople also like to escape when the news makes them afraid,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why magic movies have such success in cinemas. The Christmas markets also allow people to escape a bit from reality. \u201d But not everyone is in the Christmas spirit. Gustavs Strenga, an archivist and historian at the National Library of Latvia, said that both Riga and Tallinn were guilty of making creative leaps with their historical interpretations. Actually, he said, those   celebrations by the Black Heads had nothing to do with Christmas and were connected to other festivities the brotherhood celebrated. Looking down at his coffee cup, Mr. Strenga admitted that his skeptical position had not gone down well in Latvia. \u201cI\u2019ve been called the Grinch,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742562124.2465305}
