WWN has reproduced it in full below: \\nEnda: \u201cHello, Donald, bog fan, sorry, I mean big fan, bit nervous chatting to you obviously\u201d \\nTrump: (speaking to someone in the room with him) \u201cIt\u2019s definitely \u2018Edna\u2019? That\u2019s a chick\u2019s name right? Invite her for Patty\u2019s Day. On a scale of 1-to-10, what are we talking? How grabbable is her pussy?\u201d \\nEnda: \u201cHi, huh-hello? Mr, eh, President Elect Trump sir..\u201d \\nTrump: (speaking to someone in the room with him) \u201cYeah, they say that now, but once I\u2019m in office, that gold statue of me is going on the White House lawn, believe me. We\u2019ll need to enhance the crotch area first, bigly.\u201d \\nEnda: \u201cHello, we\u2019re very happy for you here in Ireland, absolutely everyone loves you and your hair and I never called you a racist, they were Clinton lies. She\u2019s a big liar that Clinton one.\u201d \\nLong pause of over 1 minute when nothing is said. \\nTrump: (chewing loudly) Who is this again?\u201d \\nEnda: \u201cIt\u2019s Enda Kenny, I\u2019m the Taoise\u2026 I\u2019m the Mr. Ireland boss man\u201d \\nTrump: (chewing loudly) \u201cWe\u2019re winning big here, you understand, so big, we won so big, it\u2019s unbelievable and yet my assistant tells me you\u2019re not even following me on Twitter. Wrong. Big mistake, believe me\u201d \\nEnda: \u201cYes, yes, I\u2019ll change that immediately, sir. Now myself and Barack, we talked a lot of the Undocumented Irish and their plight, as it were, and we were making great progress, they\u2019re not an awful shower like the Muslims, you were dead right about them\u2026 we\u2019ve only about 4 of them here\u201d \\nTrump: \u201cI have no idea what a Demented Iris is. And I\u2019m bored.\u201d \\nSilence for a number of seconds. \\nEnda: \u201cOur two countries enjoy a great trade relationship, we hope that continues\u201d \\nTrump: \u201cI\u2019m a business guy, the best business guy. You a business guy?\u201d \\nEnda: \u201cI gave primary school teaching a go about 40 years ago\u201d \\nTrump: \u201cThis steak is great. Have you tried Trump steak? I\u2019ll send you some, you\u2019ll pay for it, but I\u2019ll send it. If there\u2019s maggots festering in it, that\u2019s nothing to do with us. It\u2019s the best steak.\u201d \\nEnda: \u201cOkay, now I\u2019ll have to put my foot down on corporation tax and other practices, Mr President, sir\u2026\u201d \\nTrump: \u201cBoring. I\u2019m making America great again, and you\u2019re taking up too much of my time. Anyway, if you\u2019re in Clare, you should check my course and hotel, it\u2019s beautiful, the most beautiful in the world. When I got there, this guy greeted me, and it was very Irish, probably the most Irish thing they\u2019ve ever done for anyone\u201d. \\nEnda: \u201cThat was Michael Noonan, he\u2019s my best friend\u2026\u201d \\nTrump: \u201cThey had a red carpet out, beautiful women, the silliest music you could imagine, they let me do anything down there, they really did. All because of a few jobs. Except that damn wall\u2026\u201d \\nEnda: (shouting) \u201cYou can have the wall!\u201d \\nTrump: \u201cWho is this again?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742562097.7830987}
