People are sick and tired of nothing getting done, at least nothing good, so they want a new leader who can actually accomplish great things. \\n\u201cI think that we have decided that rather than confront the disagreement and differences of opinion, we\u2019ll just simply annihilate the person who disagrees with us,\u201d Thomas said. \\nUnfortunately he is exactly right.
