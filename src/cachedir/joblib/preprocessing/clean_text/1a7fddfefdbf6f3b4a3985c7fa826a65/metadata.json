The 83-year-old peer said that every member of Thatcher\u2019s inner circle was forced to take a life and steal something irreplaceable from close family to prove they were outside bourgeois morality. He continued: \u201cIt\u2019s an idea I believe she took from Aleister Crowley. I decided to get both my trials over with at once and choked the dog with my bare hands. \u201cMy mother never forgave me, of course, but I have to say it worked. From that moment on I had no sentimental respect for life, and human suffering was no longer any impediment to policy. \u201cOf course, I was still terribly upset by what she did to Westland. That poor helicopter company. Still brings tears, even now.\u201d The revelation follows Sir Geoffrey Howe\u2019s admission that he threw a chimp from a moving train, Lord Tebbit\u2019s boast of thrashing owls with a riding crop in the Cabinet Room, and Nigel Lawson\u2019s confession that he hypnotised a swan to fly into a brick wall. \\nShare:'"}, "time": 1742563813.6144674}
