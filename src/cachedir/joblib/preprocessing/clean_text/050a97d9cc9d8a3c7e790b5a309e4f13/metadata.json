Good job Candace\u2014and good job, Candace\u2019s mom, for telling her exactly what to say! \\n\\nWitnesses were impressed by the maturity of the local second grader and her ability to sound out big words. \\n\\n\\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe she was able to memorize all that,\u201d witness Anna Hines says. \u201cIt didn\u2019t really change my mind, but she was so adorable up there on that podium!\u201d \\n\\nCandace reportedly spoke about her own challenges, like turning the water off while she\u2019s brushing her teeth, as well as the future world she hopes to live in. \\n\\n\u201cWhen I grow up, I hope to live in a world where we can reduce carbon emissions and be a model for the rest of the world,\u201d the seven-year-old said, inspiring the room with the beautiful words her mother wrote for her. \\n\\n\u201cHer speech gave us all a lot to think about,\u201d one state representative says. \u201cNamely, how hard the mother must have worked to make this all happen.\u201d \\n\\n\u201cDoes this kid even understand what a carbon emission is?\u201d she added. Probably not! \\n\\n\u201cI could see her mother sort of mouthing along the words as Candace was speaking,\u201d friend of the family June Gordon says. \u201cI don\u2019t know why Breanne didn\u2019t just speak herself. It would have been less jarring, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d \\n\\nThough Candace\u2019s mother\u2019s involvement is clear, the young girl is proud about standing up in public about climate change. \\n\\n\u201cI hope the state legislature will listen to me, since I am the future,\u201d Candace says. \u201cMom, did I say that right?\u201d SHARE: '"}, "time": 1742628556.773619}
