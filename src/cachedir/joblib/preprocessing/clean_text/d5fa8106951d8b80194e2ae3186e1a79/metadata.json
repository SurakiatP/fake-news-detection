[Trump signed H. J. Res. 58, which overturns the U. S. Education Department\u2019s (USED) rule that relates to how teacher training programs are assessed. Additionally, the president signed H. J. Res. 57, which nullifies USED\u2019s rule relating to state accountability requirements under ESSA.  The teacher training program requirement, part of the Higher Education Act, mandated states to rate training programs for teachers each year based, in part, on student outcome measures. The Washington Post describes the Obama rule as \u201cbroadly unpopular\u201d: Teachers unions said the regulations wrongly tied ratings of   programs to the performance of teachers\u2019 students on standardized tests colleges and states argued that the rules were onerous and expensive, and many Republicans argued that Obama\u2019s Education Department had overstepped the bounds of executive authority. The ESSA rule concerned states\u2019 accountability in identifying failing schools and reporting their plans for improving them to the federal government.. In his remarks about these two House joint resolutions, Trump said they \u201celiminate harmful burdens on state and local taxes on school systems that could have cost states hundreds of millions of dollars. \u201d \u201cSo it\u2019s the states and   school systems, and that was very important,\u201d the president added. \u201cParents, teachers, communities, and state leaders know the needs of their students better than anyone in Washington by far. So we\u2019re removing these additional layers of bureaucracy to encourage more freedom and innovation in our schools. \u201d The   Congress and Trump are overturning some   rules and regulations via the Congressional Review Act.'"}, "time": 1742563514.489537}
