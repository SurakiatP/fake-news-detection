At the time, he was working to put his life back on track after a rough childhood that included a harrowing two months in juvenile detention. But he set himself an unlikely goal. \u201cI am going to sing at the Met,\u201d he told one of his teachers. And he did. The story of his leap from solitary confinement to opera\u2019s grandest stage is the subject of a book released this month, \u201cSing for Your Life: A Story of Race, Music, and Family,\u201d by Daniel Bergner. And on Wednesday night, Mr. Green, now a      with a burgeoning international career, was back at the Met, basking in bravos and tossed flowers after singing his biggest role there yet: Colline, the poor philosopher in Puccini\u2019s \u201cLa Boh\u00e8me. \u201d In his review in The New York Times, James R. Oestreich called Mr. Green \u201cthe real showstopper\u201d and described his big moment  \u2014   a   ode to a beloved overcoat he plans to pawn to help his friends  \u2014   as \u201cimmensely touching. \u201d Backstage after the curtain calls, Mr. Green greeted some of the people who had helped him get there. There was Betty Hughes, who had taught him in an elementary school class made up of the most troubled children in his district, and who had not given up on him when he hurled his desk in anger on the first day. There was her husband, Leon, who ran the arts high school in Norfolk, Va. where Mr. Green studied singing. And there was Denyce Graves, the   who sang the title role in the Met performance of \u201cCarmen\u201d that he had heard on that high school trip  \u2014   his introduction to opera. \u201cYou changed my entire life,\u201d Mr. Green, who now stands    and has a rich, resonant voice both when he speaks and when he sings, told her. That Ms. Graves was   like him, had first given Mr. Green the idea that he, too, could sing opera one day. She had received his class warmly when they visited her backstage, in the same room where he was now embracing her. It was a heady capstone to a major month for Mr. Green. His life story and the new book about it have been featured in recent days by \u201cCBS This Morning,\u201d NPR\u2019s \u201cFresh Air,\u201d and a range of newspapers including The Washington Post and The New York Post. The book, which grew out of a 2011 article that Mr. Bergner wrote for The New York Times Magazine, recounts in unsparing detail Mr. Green\u2019s difficult childhood and family life, including his time in juvenile detention at the age of 12 for threatening his mother and brother, parts of which were spent in solitary confinement. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget that moment,\u201d Mr. Green said in an interview, of being taken from his family\u2019s home. \u201cThey shackled me, put me in   shackles, and carried me out of the house as I was fighting to get back into my house. \u201d But the book describes how he went on to turn his life around, and how, with the help of dedicated teachers, he painstakingly learned to sing opera: getting two music degrees winning the Met\u2019s prestigious National Council Auditions in 2011 joining its demanding Lindemann Young Artist Development Program, where he had to make up for lost time in a field where many singers receive training from early childhood and joining the Vienna State Opera as a member of the ensemble. \u201cThere can be competition between singers,\u201d Dominique Meyer, the director of the Vienna State Opera, said in an interview. \u201cBut Ryan Speedo Green came into the ensemble, and I think everyone loved him from the first day. \u201d Sharing the painful, personal stories in the book had helped Mr. Green begin to come to terms with his history. \u201cIt was somewhat therapeutic,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause for so long I\u2019d put my past behind me. \u201d He said that he hoped that by sharing his story, he might inspire troubled children and their families, as well as the teachers and professionals who work with them. He has started to advocate for more funding for children\u2019s mental health and returned with Mr. Bergner to speak with children in the detention center where he was held. He plans to go back in December. \u201cI want them to know this is not the end,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause if I can do it, you kids surely can do it. \u201d Mr. Bergner said that when he began the book there had been no guarantee that Mr. Green\u2019s career would take off. But he said that Mr. Green had by then come so far that it was already an uplifting story. \u201cI was just constantly stunned by the level of sheer will that it must have taken him,\u201d Mr. Bergner said. \u201cComing out of that institution at the age of 12, living in a trailer park, with just no direction offered on how to transform himself  \u2014   and yet he did. \u201d The book also offers a candid look at race in the opera world. Mr. Green describes the pain he has felt when, after singing arias by Verdi, Puccini or Mozart, white audiences regularly ask him at recitals or parties to sing \u201cOl\u2019 Man River. \u201d He said that at a moment when the nation was confronting issues of race in so many areas, it was important to speak frankly about it in classical music. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to put race at the forefront if you can,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause without talking about it, you can\u2019t change anything. \u201d Mr. Green, who started out in very small roles, has been working his way up to bigger  \u2014   if still mostly modest  \u2014   ones, like the assassin Sparafucile in \u201cRigoletto\u201d and the vengeful Commendatore in \u201cDon Giovanni. \u201d He noted that at 30, he is still young for a   and still working to establish himself in a tough field. But when Mr. Bergner, researching the book, showed him logs that the juvenile facility had kept on him, Mr. Green said it was staggering to reflect on them. \u201cIf I read that, and you asked me, \u2018Where is this kid now? \u2019\u201d he said, \u201cI would never tell you they probably have two degrees and have a wife and are living in Europe and are singing at the Metropolitan Opera. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562084.5731885}
