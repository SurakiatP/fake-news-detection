Despite the grand accusations, no evidence or proof has been offered by the US government. \\nIt goes without saying how damaging the Democratic Party\u2019s crazed witch hunt has been to US-Russian relations, where Clinton has led the anti-Russian crusade, and demonizing president Vladimir Putin at every opportunity. \\nToday\u2019s stunning presidential victory by Donald Trump means that all eyes are now on Putin to see how Moscow and Washington will be interfacing going forward. \\nWith such sensitive geopolitical issues like Syria and the Ukraine currently in play, what happens between the two leaders over the coming months could set the tone going forward\u2026 \\nIn a message to Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin has expressed confidence that the dialogue between Moscow and Washington, in keeping with each other\u2019s views, meets the interests of both Russia and the US. \\nPutin also expressed hope over the joint efforts on bringing Russian-American relations out of their current crisis. \\nThe Russian leader noted in the message that he hopes to address some \u201cburning issues that are currently on the international agenda, and search for effective responses to the challenges of the global security,\u201d RIA Novosti reported. \\nOn top of it, Putin has expressed confidence that \u201cbuilding a constructive dialogue between Moscow and Washington, based on principles of equality, mutual respect and each other\u2019s positions, meets the interests of the peoples of our countries and of the entire international community.\u201d \\nAccording to many observers, US-Russia relations are now at their lowest point since the Cold War. Putin has repeatedly noted that the worsening of Russia\u2019s relations with the US \u201cwas not our choice,\u201d however. \\nFor things to improve between Moscow and Washington, the US should first and foremost start acting like an equal partner and respect Russia\u2019s interests rather than try to dictate terms, Putin said last month. \\n\u201cWe are concerned with the deterioration of Russian-American relations, but that was not our choice, we never wanted that. On the contrary, we want to have friendly relations with the US, a great country and a leading economy,\u201d Putin said at an economic forum in Moscow\u2026 \\nREAD MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files \\nSUPPORT 21WIRE \u2013 SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV '"}, "time": 1742628607.063663}
