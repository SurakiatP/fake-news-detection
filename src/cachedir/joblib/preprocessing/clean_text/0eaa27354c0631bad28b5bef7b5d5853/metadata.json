By Friday evening, it was a Category 2 storm, with sustained winds of up to 110 miles per hour, and government officials and forecasters shifted their focus to the threat of more serious damage on Saturday as the storm approaches Savannah and Charleston. The storm was blamed for the deaths of more than 800 people in Haiti, according to a Reuters report based on information from civil protection and local officials. For much of the day, officials warned that Jacksonville could suffer the worst damage. But while there was flooding in the area, the eye of the storm remained about 40 miles offshore as it passed Jacksonville. Dispatches from our reporters on the ground a live storm tracker map and answers to reader questions will be updated below. \u25a0 At 10 p. m. the hurricane\u2019s center was 50 miles   of St. Simons Island, Ga. and 90 miles   of Savannah, Ga. The storm was moving at about 12 m. p. h. with maximum sustained winds of 110 m. p. h. \u25a0 It was predicted to continue to parallel the coast into Georgia and the Carolinas, putting Savannah Charleston, S. C. and Wilmington, N. C. at risk, before turning out to sea. \u25a0 Florida officials blamed the storm for at least five deaths: three in St. Lucie County, one in Volusia County and one in Putnam County. Early on Friday, the St. Lucie County fire service received a call to aid a woman who had suffered a heart attack, but winds approaching hurricane force prevented emergency vehicles from responding. An older couple running a generator inside a garage died from carbon monoxide poisoning, the county said in a social media post. Around noon, another woman was killed in Volusia, Fla. when a tree fell on her after she went outside to feed animals, according to James T. Dinneen, the Volusia County manager. In Putnam County, between Gainesville and Daytona Beach, the sheriff\u2019s office said a woman had been killed when a tree fell onto a camper. Another man was injured. \u25a0 Florida officials said Friday afternoon that more than 1 million customers were without electricity. \u25a0 Significant flooding hit cities south of Jacksonville, including St. Augustine and Ormond Beach, on Friday. \u25a0 The National Weather Service extended its hurricane warning northward into North Carolina. The Weather Service downgraded the hurricane warning for Florida\u2019s   coast to a tropical storm warning, and lifted the tropical storm warning for the state\u2019s southern coast. \u25a0 President Obama warned against complacency. \u201cI just want to emphasize to everybody that this is still a really dangerous hurricane, that the potential for storm surge, flooding, loss of life and severe property damage continues to exist,\u201d he told reporters at the White House. \u201cPay attention to what your local officials are telling you. If they tell you to evacuate, you need to get out of there and move to higher ground. \u201d The president has declared a state of emergency in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, allowing federal agencies to coordinate relief efforts. \u25a0 To cover the storm and its aftermath, The New York Times has journalists deployed along the path of Hurricane Matthew. Follow our correspondents on Twitter. Miami may have been spared the wrath of Hurricane Matthew, but for residents of the city\u2019s Little Haiti neighborhood the anxiety over the storm was acute. Haiti, birth nation to most of the people in the Miami enclave, was devastated by the storm, which killed hundreds of people on the island and left fears of an even greater toll. \u201cI have two cousins I have not heard from  \u2014   I\u2019m very worried,\u201d Daniel Fils Aim\u00e9, who has lived in Little Haiti for a quarter of a century and was last in his native Les Cayes two years ago, said. \u201cSomebody is supposed to let me know. Someone is investigating. \u201d Mr. Aim\u00e9, 72, managed to get in touch with several friends in the devastated southwestern region of Haiti. \u201cI\u2019ve heard from some friends  \u2014   not others,\u201d he said as he bought pastries and bread at the Piman Bouk Bakery. \u201cThey\u2019re all scattered now. People lost their houses. They had chickens and cows in the yard  \u2014   everything went straight into the ocean. \u201d As the chairman of the   Chamber of Commerce, which he founded in 2005, Mr. Aim\u00e9 said he was trying raise money to buy enough food to fill a container, with the intention of sending it to Les Cayes. Sitting with a friend in a small park at the intersection of 62nd Street and North Miami Avenue, Maximin Raphael, 59, closed his eyes and pursed his lips as he thought about his    sister, Gyslaine Joseph, in Les Cayes, and what she went through during the hurricane. Mr. Raphael, who has lived in the United States for 34 years, had finally managed to reach her by telephone on Friday morning, after days of trying. \u201cHer house is gone,\u201d Mr. Raphael said. \u201cThe roof flew away. Everybody that lives there has a big problem. \u201d At the Piman Bouk Bakery, murals, both inside and out, portray a verdant and abundant Haiti in the manner of much of the country\u2019s art. But the crushing realities of life there, made even more so by frequent batterings it takes from natural calamities like storms and earthquakes, were all too plain to the customers  \u2014   almost invariably Haitian immigrants  \u2014   who lined up Friday afternoon to buy goods. \u201cWe are all Haitian, so we have to be concerned, regardless of whether they are family or not,\u201d said   Richardson, a registered nurse who was born in Cap Haitien, in the country\u2019s north, and who moved to Miami in 1986 after completing high school in her native country.  \u2014   NICK MADIGAN, in Miami Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, declined to extend the deadline after a call from Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign to accommodate people disrupted by the hurricane.

Read more from John Schwartz \u00bb On Friday afternoon in Charleston, S. C. officials warned of potentially   high tides, urged people to evacuate if they had not done so and set a curfew, from midnight until 6 a. m. Saturday, for those who remained. But as the wind whistled and rain began to spit on this peninsular city, those who remained here seemed remarkably relaxed. \u201cThere\u2019s parties all over,\u201d said Elle Norton, 58, as she boarded up the windows of her pale pink house in downtown Charleston, and brought her potted plants inside. \u201cI have to go to the store now to get some appetizers. \u201d To Ms. Norton and many others here, the emptiness of Charleston\u2019s    streets, where antebellum architecture is dotted with hidden courtyards and lush window boxes, was a refreshing break, because the city is usually brimming with tourists. \u201cIt\u2019s so pleasant just hearing the birds,\u201d Ms. Norton said. A few streets over, Normandy Farm Bakery had filled the case it normally reserved for oysters  \u2014   of which there were only three left  \u2014   with hot dogs and beer, and strung up a random assortment of celebratory balloons outside to signal they were staying open. \u201cYou ride it out in your house, you\u2019re gonna go bananas,\u201d said the owner, Mike Ray, who seemed unmoved by the dire warnings from public officials. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s gonna flood right here. \u201d Nearby, Jerome Monroe, a local handy man, closed the shutters on a fine arts gallery. He was planning to ride out the storm inside the Footlight Player\u2019s Theater, where he would use a ShopVac to try to minimize flooding, though he knew he was powerless to prevent it entirely. \u201cWhen the water comes,\u201d Mr. Monroe said, \u201cyou\u2019re not stopping it. \u201d  \u2014   JESSICA BIDGOOD in Charleston, S. C. John Schwartz, a New York Times reporter who covers climate change and the environment, is answering reader questions about the storm. He rode out his first hurricane, Carla, in his hometown, Galveston, Tex. at age 4. He has covered the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, as well as other storms for The Times.  Ask your hurricane questions here. Why do weather agencies and the news media keep getting the forecasts so wrong and overstate the severity of hurricanes? Is this some kind of insurance liability issue, where they are afraid of getting sued if they don\u2019t paint a \u2018doomsday\u2019 picture?  \u2014   Jim The conservative approach isn\u2019t about liability, Jim, it\u2019s about saving lives. The storm track that Matthew has followed has been well within the range of possibilities that the National Hurricane Center has been talking about all along. This is still a dangerous storm, and just because some stretches of the Florida coast have not been hit as catastrophically as was possible, that does not mean the rest of Florida or Georgia or South Carolina are in the clear. Marshall Shepherd, the director of Atmospheric Sciences Program, University of Georgia, has been fiercely defending the warnings on Twitter, and I\u2019ll let him do the talking here: Chris W. Landsea, science and operations officer for the National Hurricane Center, said that while the storm has weakened somewhat, it is now spread over a larger area, and \u201ca larger hurricane can cause more storm surge,\u201d and a larger wind field the wind damage, in other words, can be felt over a larger area. So a slightly weaker but larger storm is \u201ckind of a wash, as far as impacts,\u201d he said. I grew up in Houston and also rode out Carla as a child as well as Henrietta in Cabo as an adult. I certainly believe in climate change, but is the hurricane season really worse now? What about the 1900 Galveston hurricane?  \u2014   Jackie Berry There have always been hurricanes, and many have been profoundly destructive. The Great Storm of 1900 killed at least 6, 000 people on Galveston Island, and remains the deadliest natural disaster in United States history. But climate change isn\u2019t about these isolated incidents. It\u2019s the   trend, and the   trend is not good. People remember the 1900 storm  \u2014   and the haunting song about it, Wasn\u2019t that a Mighty Storm? and Erik Larson\u2019s book \u201cIsaac\u2019s Storm\u201d  \u2014   because it stands out in the damage that it did. What climate change is doing is dumping more heat into the oceans and more moisture into the air  \u2014   conditions that are likely, over time, to make the strong storms that do develop become more powerful, and possibly more frequent, as well. Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University, noted that while global average temperatures are rising, \u201c20 times more heat is going into the ocean\u201d than into the atmosphere, and so that\u2019s a lot of power in the sea for hurricanes to draw on. And, in fact, while the 1900 storm was terribly destructive, much of that tragedy could be blamed on the lack of warning in those   times. It\u2019s hard to attribute any single weather event to climate change, but it\u2019s clear that climate change sets up conditions that can lead to more 1900 storms, more Katrinas, more Sandys. When I wrote about the science of attribution last year, Andrew E. Dessler, a climate researcher at Texas A  M, told me determining whether an extreme weather event like a flood is caused by climate change is like trying to figure out which of Barry Bonds\u2019s home runs were caused by his steroid use. \u201cYou know statistically some of them were, but you don\u2019t know which ones,\u201d he said. \u201cAlmost certainly, it would have rained a lot even without climate change  \u2014   but it\u2019s possible climate change juiced it, added a little bit. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564188.3549454}
