A series of populist anti-globalism shocks is a test for Western democracies. Trump\u2019s stunning ascent to the White House is the clearest signal yet of an anti-establishment revolt unfolding in major democracies, stretching across the Atlantic. \u2013 Swiss Info Tech \\nWas Trump\u2019s victory actually created by the very globalist elites that Trump is supposed to have overcome? \\nThere are some who believe the elites are actually splintered into numerous groups and that domestic US elites have positioned themselves against the banking elites in London\u2019s City. We see no fundamental evidence of this. \\nThe world\u2019s real elites in our view may have substantive histories in the hundreds and thousands of years. US elites are basically in the employ of a handful of families, individuals and institutions in our view. \\nIt is confusing because it is hard to tell if Hillary, for instance, is operating on her own accord or at the behest of higher and more powerful authorities. \\nIt is probably a combination of both but at root those who control central banks are managing the world\u2019s move towards globalism. History easily shows us who these groups are \u2013 and they are not located in America. \\nThis is a cynical perspective to be sure, and certainly doesn\u2019t remove the impact of Trump\u2019s victory or his courage in waging his election campaign despite what must surely be death threats to himself and his family.. \\nBut if true, this perspective corresponds to predictions that we\u2019ve been making for nearly a decade now, suggesting that sooner or later elites \u2013 especially those in London\u2019s City \u2013 would have to \u201ctake a step back.\u201d \\nMore: \\nThe vote to propel Trump to the US presidency reflects a profound backlash against open markets and borders, and the simmering anger of millions of blue-collar white and working-class people who blame their economic woes on globalisation and multiculturalism. \\n\u201cThere are a few parallels to Switzerland \u2013 that the losers of globalisation find somebody who is listening to them,\u201d said Swiss professor and lawyer Wolf Linder, a former director of the University of Bern\u2019s political science institute. \\n\u201cTrump is doing his business with the losers of globalisation in the US, like the Swiss People\u2019s Party is doing in Switzerland,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a phenomenon which touches all European nations.\u201d \\nAgain, this article presumes that Trump has \u201cwon\u201d and that he intends to attack the larger globalist enterprise and the bankers funding it. On the other hand, it could be that both Trump and Brexit have been engineered to look as if the tide is turning against globalism when it is not. \\nWhy would those in charge want to portray this point of view when it may not be so? Because of what we call the \u201cInternet Reformation\u201d that has blasted open the secretive manipulations of the globalist elite in the past decade or so. \\nIt is almost impossible for globalists to promote internationalist memes in this environment. Yet it is the secretive injection of internationalist memes into the body politic that moves society toward the globalist enterprise. \\nAs we have suggested before, it is perfectly possible that a decision has been made to pretend to grant the larger society a \u201cvictory\u201d over internationalism. \\nFollowing this analysis, certain trends would be identified and encouraged that would seem to portray globalism as falling back on its metaphorical heels. \\nIn truth, if this analysis is correct, globalism\u2019s retreat is a kind of pretense that will steer society less obviously in a globalist direction. \\nOne way this could happen is by ensuring the splintering of Europe \u2013 but not in a way that actually reduces control from Brussels. It will APPEAR to be so but won\u2019t actually happen. The same thing could take place in the USA under Trump. \\nAgain, this is not to say that Trump is party to this plot or even approves of it. But the idea that Trump is part of a co-option is certainly a feasible alternative to an alternative analysis that takes what is happening at face value. \\nNonetheless, even if an alternative elite strategy has been decided on to realize globalism in another fashion, it ought to be pointed out that things have changed. And the Internet and its revelations are surely responsible. \\nThis is a very big deal and it is one that ought to be emphasized repeatedly. Brexit and Trump could be, somehow, the result of a different elite approach \u2013 but the approach HAS changed nonetheless. \\nThink of it this way: Hillary represented the blunt approach toward the realization of further globalism. Her way included an aggressively expanded war and the pursuit of other globalist trends. \\nTrump, rhetorically anyway, has a different approach in mind that would gut many internationalist trends. \\nIf Trump follows through on his rhetoric, the trend toward an internationalist world will be reduced. And while there is controversy over Trump\u2019s recent staff appointments we should also bear in mind that the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) both seem to be failing now. \\nIf indeed Trump\u2019s election has damped the progress of TPP, and TTIP, this is a huge event. As we\u2019ve pointed out, both agreements effectively substituted technocratic corporatism for the current sociopolitical model of \u201cdemocracy.\u201d \\nThe elites were trying to move toward a new model of world control with these two agreements. This is similar to what happened after the advent of the Gutenberg Press when the elites of the day moved away from royal control and apparently swapped in democracy. \\nIt seems evident that internationalism is now going to take a longer time to realize than we thought. However, this observation may not be entirely accurate if Trump turns out to be something other than his rhetoric suggests \u2013 or if Brexit is denied in Europe. \\nAdditionally, one of the elite\u2019s most powerful, operative memes today is \u201cpopulism vs. globalism\u201d that seeks to contrast the potentially freedom-oriented events of Trump and Brexit to the discarded wisdom of globalism. See here and here. \\nThe reality of these two events, the victories of both Trump and Brexit, stand as signal proof that elite stratagems have been defeated, at least temporarily. Though whether these defeats have been self-inflicted as part of a change in tactics remains to be seen. \\nConclusion: But the change has come. One way or another the Internet and tens of millions or people talking, writing and acting has forced new trends. This can be hardly be emphasized enough. Globalism has been at least temporarily redirected'"}, "time": 1742561704.596618}
