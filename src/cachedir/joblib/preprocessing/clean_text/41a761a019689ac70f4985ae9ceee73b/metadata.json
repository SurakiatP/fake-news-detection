If Clinton is indicted before the election \\nThe FBI merely said that they are reopening their investigation to examine new emails that came to light. They have yet to even determine whether the emails are actually evidence of criminal activity, let alone decide whether or not to prosecute. Therefore, it\u2019s highly unlikely that an indictment would come before November 8. If it did, the indictment itself wouldn\u2019t mean that Clinton could no longer run, as an indictment is only an accusation, not a conviction\u2026. \\n2. If Clinton steps down before the election \\nShould Clinton relinquish her candidacy before the election, the Democratic National Committee has rules in place for what happens next. Article 2, Section 7 of the DNC Bylaws says that if there is a vacancy on the national ticket, a special meeting of the Committee \u201cshall be held on the call of the Chairperson,\u201d where they would choose a new candidate. Such meetings make decisions based on a majority of those in attendance. Since we are exactly 11 days away from the election, there is one major problem: The ballot deadlines have passed in nearly every state.'"}, "time": 1742562172.3792906}
