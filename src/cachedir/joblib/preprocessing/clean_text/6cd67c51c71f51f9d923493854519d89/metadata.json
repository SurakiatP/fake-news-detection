Turkey has really become a rogue nation,\u201d he added, referring to a 1923 treaty that set the border between Turkey and Greece, saying that was even being questioned by President Rececp Tayyip Erdogan.\\n\u201cAnd now you see this emerging threat against Western Europe by Turkey,\u201d he noted, further adding that Erdogan \u201chas made it clear that he looks to resurrection of the Ottoman Empire.\u201d\\n\u201cHe has become more and more aggressive; he\u2019s crushed the military, the free press; every powerful institution of the Turkish government has come under his iron fist and he\u2019s now a total dictator. He\u2019s a man who has said that he wants the constitution amended so that he will have power similar to those of Adolf Hilter\u2026 This is our great ally; we\u2019re allied with a man who would be Hitler.\u201d\\nHe also blasted Washington\u2019s alliance with Saudi Arabia, \u201cwhere women are not allowed to walk out in the front yard to pick up the newspaper without a man\u2019s permission; they can\u2019t drive a car!\u201d\\n\u201cSomehow, this is part of the liberalization that we seek to impose on the Middle East,\u201d he said ironically, calling it \u201cbizarre.\u201d\\nHe also praised the resistance against the Saudi aggression by the people of Yemen, saying, \u201cGod bless them! The Yemenis are giving the Saudis a bloody nose,\u201d despite being a \u201ctiny little, poor nation.\u201d\\n\u201cI think the world recognizes that Saudi Arabia has just embarked in massive war crimes in Yemen,\u201d he said, voicing regret over the US support for the monarchy.\\n\u201cWe don\u2019t pay too much attention to them while engaged in war crimes because they\u2019re our good allies,\u201d he said, concluding that Washington is on a \u201csuicidal course of action.\u201d\\n\u201cSaudi money pays the very top politicians in many Western nations. And they really have co-opted the American military into acting as mercenaries for Wahhabism.\u201dBlack referred to the Western media\u2019s portrayal of Iran as a supporter of terrorism, saying, \u201cThe fact of the matter is that if you really look at global terrorism, it all emanates from Saudi Arabia.\u201d\\nHe exemplified various terrorists attack, including the 9/11, the Boston bombing, and the Brussels attacks, noting that they are all a \u201creflection of the Wahhabi philosophy.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742561745.1209831}
