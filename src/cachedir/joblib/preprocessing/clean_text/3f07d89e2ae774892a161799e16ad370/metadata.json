With every mass shooting in America, a somber scene replays itself here. Victims\u2019 families and survivors of massacres  \u2014   Columbine, Virginia Tech, Aurora, Tucson, Sandy Hook, Charleston, San Bernardino  \u2014   traipse up to Capitol Hill. They knock on lawmakers\u2019 doors, attend news conferences and bear witness to Senate votes on gun measures that almost never pass. So there was a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu here on Monday as the Senate rejected four gun safety measures, one week after the Pulse nightclub massacre, which killed 49 and injured 53, in Orlando, Fla. Erica Lafferty Smegielski, 30, whose mother was the principal killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut, spent the day wandering the corridors of Congress with Colin Goddard, also 30, whose body still holds three bullets fired by the gunman at Virginia Tech in 2007. They stopped for a quick bite in a cafeteria, and ran into Patricia Maisch, 67, who, in 2011, was waiting in Tucson to have a picture taken with her congresswoman, Gabrielle Giffords, and helped end the massacre by grabbing the gunman\u2019s ammunition clip. They all hugged. \u201cIt\u2019s like, every time we come together for something like this, there is someone new we are introduced to for the first time, and we know the road that\u2019s ahead of them,\u201d said Ms. Smegielski over a basket of chicken nuggets. A tattoo honoring her mother is on her right arm. She looked at Mr. Goddard, to her right both work for Everytown for Gun Safety, an advocacy organization backed by Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor. \u201cJust like you were there for me three years ago,\u201d she told him. \u201cAnd now, I\u2019m somebody\u2019s Colin. \u201d Mrs. Maisch had cut short a family reunion in St. Louis to be here for the vote. In 2013, when the Senate voted against gun safety measures that President Obama pushed for after the Sandy Hook shooting, she stood up in the Senate gallery, looked down at the lawmakers and shouted, \u201cShame on you!\u201d She was escorted out by the police and detained for two hours. On Monday, she wore an orange button that read \u201cSurvivor\u201d and a collection of colored plastic wristbands, each one representing a shooting victim. One was for a congressional candidate from Wisconsin whose mother killed herself. One was for Jordan Davis, a    student shot in Florida, by someone who complained about his loud music. One was for Dawn Hochsprung, Ms. Smegielski\u2019s mother. \u201cThese are all people I know,\u201d she said. Gun safety advocates said they were not aware of any survivors or relatives from Orlando here it was simply too soon, they said. Lori Haas, whose daughter was badly injured at Virginia Tech, and who is now the Virginia state director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, was in Orlando with family members on Monday. \u201cThis is like a very, very, very bad Groundhog Day movie,\u201d she said in a telephone interview from the offices of Equality Florida, a gay rights advocacy group. Her presence there suggests a possible change after the rampage at Pulse, a gay nightclub. Leaders of the gay rights movement, which is   and   are now putting their muscle behind gun safety. Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said gun safety advocates hope to pattern their efforts after the campaign to legalize   marriage. If they cannot win in Washington, they will try to win in the states. They cite some progress: Since the Sandy Hook shooting, 42 states have passed some sort of gun safety legislation, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Mr. Gross\u2019 group helped run a social media campaign using the hashtag #DisarmHate he said it resulted in 150, 000 telephone calls to lawmakers last week  \u2014   10 times the number of calls the movement generated after last year\u2019s massacre in San Bernardino, Calif. \u201cThere\u2019s a moment for every great issue and every great movement  \u2014   usually in hindsight  \u2014   that when you look back and say, \u2018That\u2019s when things started to change,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd for the issue of gun violence, that moment is now. \u201d As senators voted on Monday, advocates with the Brady campaign sat in the gallery wearing orange   with the slogan #Enough Gun Violence. Afterward, Ms. Smegielski dabbed tears from her eyes. Mrs. Maisch said she was not surprised. Tina Meins, whose father was killed in San Bernardino, watched the vote from afar she had been here last week to attend a news conference with Senator Christopher S. Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat who held a   filibuster intended to force his colleagues to take up the issue of guns. She, like the others, expected the measures to fail. The life of a   advocate, she said, can be \u201cextremely frustrating. \u201d And the club is growing. \u201cIn San Bernardino, we had 14 families,\u201d Ms. Meins said. \u201cNow we have 49. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561671.2020915}
