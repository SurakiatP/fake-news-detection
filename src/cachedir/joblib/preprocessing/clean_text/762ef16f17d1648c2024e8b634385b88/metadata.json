[Said Pruitt, \u201cFAIRtax. org is holding a rally tomorrow and we\u2019re holding the rally to help remind President Trump of what he promised. Our fear after watching the recent events in Syria, our fear after watching what occurred with Obamacare is that President Trump is going to be urged, he\u2019s going to get a push from the media, to turn tax reform over to the establishment. \u201d  \u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly what we do not want,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo, we felt that at this time it is imperative that all the people who voted for him, who\u2019s sweat and I believe your previous guest who talked about having blood coming from their feet as they marched for him, we believe that it\u2019s imperative that we remind President Trump we were there for you. We got you there. When nobody else said you could, we said you can and you will. \u201d Pruitt also authored a   book titled Planes, Steak  Water: Defending Donald J. Trump in September of 2016.
