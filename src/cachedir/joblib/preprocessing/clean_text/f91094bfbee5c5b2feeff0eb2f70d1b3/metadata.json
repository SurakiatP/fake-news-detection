Trump has made it clear that he views the central basis for diplomatic relations between Washington and Beijing  \u2014   known as the \u201cOne China\u201d policy  \u2014   as ripe for review. Under that   policy, the United States severed diplomatic ties with Taiwan as part of its recognition of the People\u2019s Republic of China. But in early December, Mr. Trump stunned officials across the globe by becoming the first president or   to speak to a Taiwanese leader since at least 1979. Then on Sunday, he suggested that adhering to the One China policy could be used as a bargaining chip  on contentious issues like China\u2019s currency and its activity in the South China Sea. \u201cI don\u2019t know why we have to be bound by a One China policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade,\u201d he said in an interview. In trying to use Taiwan that way, Mr. Trump hit the most sensitive of what the Chinese Communist Party calls its \u201ccore interests. \u201d If Washington formally recognizes Taiwan, the Chinese are expected to break off diplomatic relations. Though the United States officially ended relations with Taiwan in 1979, it maintains an unofficial embassy there called the American Institute in Taiwan. It has also sold Taiwan advanced military equipment and has worked to promote its democracy. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, rejected Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion that American support for Taiwan was negotiable. \u201cTaiwan is not a source of leverage,\u201d Mr. Earnest said Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s a close partner of the United States. \u201d The Global Times, a Chinese   tabloid, put the matter more bluntly, saying Mr. Trump was \u201clike a child in his ignorance of foreign policy. \u201d It added: \u201cThe One China policy cannot be bought and sold. Trump, it seems, only understands business and believes that everything has a price. \u201d Here are five ways the Chinese could make life difficult for a Trump administration: Chinese analysts say China has plenty of leverage to retaliate against Mr. Trump. One prominent target is Boeing, whose Seattle plant Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president, visited in September 2015. In 2016, Boeing is expected to complete plane deliveries to China worth $11 billion, mostly 737s that have become the workhorse of China\u2019s rapidly expanding airlines. The Global Times warned that it would be easy for China to switch orders to Boeing\u2019s European competitor, Airbus. \u201cOn economic issues, China has more and more leverage,\u201d said Wu Xinbo, the director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University. \u201cIf we feel he is still pushing the Taiwan issue, we will take action. If he wants to keep it up on Taiwan, it will only backfire. \u201d American trade officials worry that China could intensify its discrimination against American technology firms by using the country\u2019s antimonopoly laws. Last year, the Chinese government slapped a $975 million fine on Qualcomm, a San   chip maker, for what it said were licensing infractions. A few years ago, there were worries that China might suddenly dump a large portion of its holdings of Treasuries, pushing up interest rates in the United States. Those fears ebbed as China pared its holdings gradually. Its holdings of Treasuries peaked at $1. 65 trillion in March 2014, declining to about $1. 3 trillion, said Brad Setser at the Council on Foreign Relations. Experts say that even if the country sold more, it may not have much effect because interest rates are already low, global demand for Treasuries has been strong, and the Federal Reserve could buy more bonds if needed to offset action by China. China could also weaken its currency, something Mr. Trump has argued it already does to make its products cheaper. But that could also result in more Chinese taking their money out of the country, as well as inflation for a nation that increasingly buys what it needs from abroad, like oil, because a weak currency means China must pay more for imported goods. Finally, China could order its   companies and private enterprises to slow their investments in the United States. A recent study by the Rhodium Group, a New   economic policy outfit, showed that since 2015, the amount of Chinese direct investment in the United States has outweighed the amount of American investment in China. Mr. Trump said on Sunday, \u201cAnd frankly, they\u2019re not helping us at all with North Korea. \u201d China has in fact cooperated with some American initiatives on curbing North Korea\u2019s nuclear program, specifically backing United Nations economic sanctions last month aimed at checking the North\u2019s foreign exchange earnings from coal, its biggest export earner. China could switch from being a reluctant ally of North Korea to a friendly neighbor. China is already angry at Washington for the recent decision to deploy a defense shield in South Korea, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, known as THAAD, which China argues is aimed at limiting its military capabilities. Among the tools China could use would be improved trade, aid and investment to strengthen the North\u2019s rudimentary economy, said John Delury, an American analyst in Seoul, South Korea. As a longstanding ally, China could conduct joint military exercises with the North, he said. In return for promises by North Korea not to proliferate, Mr. Delury said, China could go beyond improved trade, and provide substantial economic backing in a Marshall   initiative. President Obama spent much of his political capital with China ensuring that Beijing would agree to the international climate change agreement that committed the world\u2019s two biggest carbon emitters to lower greenhouse gases. Critics of Mr. Obama say he failed to force China to open up its markets, stood by while China fortified islands in the South China Sea and remained largely silent while Mr. Xi carried out repressive human rights policies in order to save the climate change accord. Moreover, China\u2019s agreement to the international deal was less a concession to American pressure than a restatement of its own goals. It was relatively easy for Mr. Xi to agree to a reduction in emissions given the outcry among the Chinese public about air pollution and contaminated food. The accord calls for China\u2019s carbon emissions to reach a plateau or decline \u201caround 2030\u201d but without any specific target for reductions like those Mr. Obama pledged for the United States. Mr. Xi would be unlikely to touch the climate accord because of the popularity of the prospect of cleaner air among the Chinese public. But if he did decide to ignore it, Mr. Trump would probably not care. At one point, Mr. Trump said climate change was a \u201choax\u201d invented by China to hurt American trade. Later, he said he was joking. If Mr. Trump supports Taiwan, China\u2019s first response may be to punish Taiwan rather than the United States, in an attempt to diminish its value to Washington. It could begin by intensifying efforts to persuade the 22 small sovereignties around the world, including the Vatican, that still maintain diplomatic relations with Taiwan to sever them and recognize China instead. China might then take aim at Taiwan\u2019s economy by restricting Chinese investments and limiting the number of Chinese tourists to Taiwan. Taiwan already has de facto independence, but China has warned that it will go to war to prevent it a formal separation from the mainland. From Beijing\u2019s perspective, the fear is that Mr. Trump\u2019s moves could encourage Taiwan to declare independence or that other nations might follow the United States in recognizing Taiwan. If President Tsai   of Taiwan declared independence, \u201cand the whole world says Taiwan is independent,\u201d then China \u201cwill take military action,\u201d said Shi Yinhong, professor of international relations at Renmin University. \u201cBut I don\u2019t believe that is Tsai\u2019s intention,\u201d he added. China was a signatory to the nuclear accord reached with Iran in 2015 that lifted sanctions in return for Iran\u2019s getting rid of 98 percent of its nuclear material. China now has unfettered access to its longtime friend\u2019s economy. Through Iran, Beijing will seek to enhance its influence in the Middle East, with the goal of weakening American prestige in the region. But if the deal is scrapped and renegotiated, as Mr. Trump has called for, China would keep trading with Iran, isolating the United States, said Edward C. Chow, senior fellow for energy and national security at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. About   of Iran\u2019s oil exports go to China, and China is Iran\u2019s top importer of goods. Thus China is Iran\u2019s top trading partner, a position that would not change in the event of Mr. Trump\u2019s renouncing Washington\u2019s participation in the nuclear deal. \u201cIf anything, China would redouble trading and investment in Iran now that Trump has started on the Taiwan front,\u201d Mr. Chow said.'"}, "time": 1742563694.8725176}
