An Eerily Similar Replica of the Doomed Ship Will Set Sail in 2018 posted by Eddie This lavish replica of the ill-fated RMS Titanic is expected to set sail in 2018 \u2013 and it will look eerily similar to the most famous ship in the world that sank back in 1912.Staying true to its namesake, the Titanic II will feature Turkish baths, an Edwardian gym and a small swimming pool. Of course, it will also feature the grand staircase which remains one of its most famous features due to its prominence in the 1997 movie about the ship\u2019s sinking.Like the \u201cunsinkable\u201d original, it will also have first, second and third class cabins and dining rooms, as well as a smoking room. With white panelling throughout, the first class dining room was nearly 115 feet long and spanned the entire width of the ship. Blue Star Line says that some of the elements will be retained purely for historic significance but will not be functional.Titanic II will be 13 feet wider than the original ship, but its length, height and weight will be similar, and it will also have nine decks like the original. First class cabins on board Titanic II will feature beds with curtains, wood paneling and his and hers sinks. It will meet modern safety and design requirements, meaning it will have a welded hull instead of a riveted one, a diesel-electric propulsion system instead of steam engines, stabilizers, and high-tech navigational equipment, reports the Daily Mail.And, of course, this time, it will have enough lifeboats for everyone on board \u2013 and evacuation systems put in place.
