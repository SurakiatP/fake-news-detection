Speaking via telephone at a conference in Argentina on Wednesday, RT reported that Assange claimed the daily email release ritual has \u201cwhipped up a crazed hornet\u2019s nest atmosphere in the Hillary Clinton campaign\u201d leading them to attack WikiLeaks. \\n\u201cThey attacked our servers and attempted hacking attacks and there is an amazing ongoing campaign where state documents were put in the UN and British courts to accuse me of being both a Russian spy and a pedophile,\u201d he added. \\nAssange described Ecuador\u2019s decision to shut down his internet for the duration of the presidential campaign as a \u201cstrategic position\u201d so that its \u201cpolicy of non-intervention can\u2019t be misinterpreted by actors in the US and even domestically in Ecuador.\u201d He said he was sympathetic with Ecuador, insisting they face the dilemma of having the US interfere with their elections next year if they appear to interfere with the US elections next month. He also said that he did not agree with Ecuador\u2019s decision but did understand it. WikiLeaks will not be affected by the decision as they do not publish from Ecuador, he said. \\nHe did, however, reject the idea that WikiLeaks is interfering with the US election, claiming, \u201cthis is not the interference of electoral process, this is the definition of electoral process \u2013 for media organizations and, in fact, everyone to publish the truth and their opinion about what is occurring. It cannot be a free and informed election unless people are free to inform.\u201d It will, of course, be spun as interference if Hillary were to lose as the tables would then be turned, and instead of Trump slamming the \u201crigged\u201d elections, it will be Hillary who will demand a pound of flesh, perhaps literally. \\nAssange did not stop there and also attacked US TV networks, many of whom he accused of being \u201ccontrolled by Clinton supporters.\u201d If there is anything the Podesta emails have revealed, it is that he is correct in his assessment .'"}, "time": 1742564030.1442313}
