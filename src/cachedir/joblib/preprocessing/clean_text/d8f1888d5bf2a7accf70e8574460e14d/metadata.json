One Night Only at the Cal Poly University Union A DEMONIC DOUBLE FEATURE,\u201d and the event will feature two films with satanic themes: Invocation of My Demon Brother (1969) and ReGoreGitated Sacrifice (2008). Cal Poly SQE, along with other progressive activist clubs on campus, have fought tirelessly against MILO\u2019s appearance at Cal Poly, and on Friday heralded UC Davis\u2019 cancellation of MILO\u2019s event. \u201cWhen we organize, we WIN!\u201d wrote the group in a Facebook post. \u201c#ShutITDOWN!

CORRECTION: The previous description for this article mistakenly claimed that Cal Poly SQE had partnered with The Satanic Temple to host their event. The Satanic Temple have since reached out to clarify that they have nothing to do with the event, and reject Cal Poly SQE\u2019s celebration of the shutdown of MILO at UC Davis. Their full comments, which emphasize The Satanic Temple\u2019s robust commitment to free speech, can be read in a   article here.'"}, "time": 1742561934.0968926}
