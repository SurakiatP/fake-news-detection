[\u201cIt is fanaticism, not only in Islam, that leads to terrible crimes,\u201d he said, speaking on German public radio station Deutschlandfunk Wednesday evening, when asked about the Islamist attack in which 22 mostly young people, including an    girl, lost their lives.  \u201cIt is certainly a misunderstanding of religion when belief slips into fanaticism or, at worst, violence. \u201cThe world\u2019s great religions all preach the message that one must look upon others as their sisters and brothers, and that one must live with the other because man cannot live alone,\u201d Sch\u00e4uble told presenter Christiane Florin. \u201c\u2018Islam is part of Germany\u2019 is a sober, factual statement,\u201d the minister remarked, commenting on sentiments voiced by Chancellor Angela Merkel on more than one occasion  \u2014   which are not shared by the majority of Germans. \u201cAnyone who denies this denies reality and is therefore not suited to being a politician, because politics begins with the confrontation of reality,\u201d he added. The country\u2019s rapidly growing Muslim demographic presents an \u201copportunity\u201d for \u201cChristians, and all who live in Germany\u201d Sch\u00e4uble stated, adding: \u201cWe can learn from them. \u201cMany human values are very strongly realised in Islam. Think of hospitality, and other things like, what is there  \u2026     And also tolerance, I believe, for example. \u201d Discussing his recently published book, Protestantism and Politics, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) minister said the church has no monopoly on truth and criticised voices within who \u201cargue too much in secular matters from a point of religious conviction\u201d. Commenting on how the \u201cstar\u201d at the biennial congress of the German Protestant Church on Thursday was to be Barack Obama rather than any   figure, Sch\u00e4uble lavished praise on the former U. S. president, describing him as \u201ca man who can truly inspire people, like few others\u201d. The minister expressed frustration with Obama\u2019s successor Donald Trump, lashing out at the president\u2019s \u2018America First\u2019 platform, and asserting that \u201cif Germans could choose between President Obama and his successor, a large majority of them would vote for President Obama\u201d.'"}, "time": 1742563787.6333435}
