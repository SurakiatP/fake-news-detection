It was taken by McCurry at the Nasir Bagh refugee camp near Peshawar in 1984 when she was about 12-years-old. \\nGula\u2019s striking green eyes has seen her being dubbed the Afghan Mona Lisa, and her photograph is ranked in the top 5 of National Geographic\u2019s most iconic images.

National Geographic was able to verify Gula was the famous girl by comparing her moles and scar, as well as using iris scanning technology. \\n\"Her eyes are as haunting now as they were then,\" McCurry said at the time. \"She remembered me, primarily because she had never been photographed before I made the image of her in 1984, or since then.\" Mentally ill convict to be executed after court rules schizophrenia \\'not a mental disorder\\' in #Pakistan https://t.co/UZZSogP6QS pic.twitter.com/UqfLREcAKM \u2014 RT (@RT_com) October 22, 2016 \\nLast year, Pakistani media reported the National Database and Registration Authority had cancelled the cards of Gula and two men said to be her sons because they had been illegally issued. Three officials are wanted for issuing her card and have been missing since it was first reported. \\nGula applied for an identity card in 2014, using the name Sharbat Bibi.
