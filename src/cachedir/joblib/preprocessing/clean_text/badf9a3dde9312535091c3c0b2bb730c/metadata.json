{"duration": 0.14857006072998047, "input_args": {"text": "'CNN checked in on the   surveillance story Monday morning and seemed profoundly confused about what is actually going on:[An incendiary idea first put forward by   radio host Mark Levin is now burning across Washington, fanned by President Trump\u2019s tweets and a huge number of supportive commentators and websites  \u2014   even though the facts don\u2019t back up the conclusion. Breitbart News has given the conspiracy theory a name: \u201cDeepStateGate. \u201d Others are going with \u201cObamaGate. \u201d And Fox News host Sean Hannity is asking: \u201cWhat did OBAMA know and when did he know it? ??\u201d Levin\u2019s original idea, advanced on Thursday, was that former President Barack Obama and his allies have mounted a \u201csilent coup\u201d against Trump using \u201cpolice state\u201d tactics. Levin   news stories that supported his thesis and omitted information that cut against it. The next day, Rush Limbaugh echoed Levin\u2019s \u201csilent coup\u201d language, and Breitbart columnist Joel Pollak published an \u201cexpanded version of that case. \u201d That\u2019s how the idea reached Trump\u2019s radar. The Breitbart article \u201ccirculated\u201d in the West Wing, a White House official told CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny, and the information \u201cinfuriated\u201d Trump. To be clear, Levin and Limbaugh and Pollak didn\u2019t publish any original reporting. They merely claimed to have connected some dots. [Emphasis mine] Perhaps CNN\u2019s writers should read their own copy more carefully and save themselves some befuddlement. This isn\u2019t an \u201cincendiary idea put forth by   radio host Mark Levin,\u201d   columnist Joel Pollak, or Joel\u2019s merry   sidekick, Yours Truly. We\u2019re all just reading stories the mainstream media pumped out with frantic speed over the past few months.   You made DeepStateGate happen, mainstream media. You ran   scuttlebutt from your old pals in the Obama administration to keep your precious \u201cRussia stole the election from Hillary!\u201d narrative alive. You led your readers to believe it was all hard news, based on solid intel from trustworthy sources. As I noted on Sunday, sometimes you buried \u201cthis is all groundless hearsay\u201d disclaimers six paragraphs into the stories, but the headlines screamed about the wiretaps that angered President Trump.  Here, for example, is a nice catch from   raconteur Raheem Kassam, the   editor of the   Breitbart London division of   Breitbart News: Mmmhmmm. pic. twitter.   \u2014   Raheem Kassam (@RaheemKassam) March 6, 2017,  That headline, \u201cWiretapped Data Used in Inquiry of Trump Aides,\u201d was most assuredly not a   production, and it\u2019s not even slightly ambiguous about the existence of wiretapping. Jeff Dunetz at The Lid couldn\u2019t help noticing that the exact same reporter who wrote that New York Times piece in January is now claiming, right in his headlines, that Trump has \u201cno evidence\u201d of the very same wiretaps he reported as established fact just two months ago. \u201cThis is the ultimate in liberal media bias. In January Michael S. Schmidt perpetuated the rumor that team Trump had Russian connections, and to support his point he said that Trump\u2019s people were wiretapped. However when President Trump claimed his people were wiretapped, the same guy, Michael S. Schmidt, said there was no evidence,\u201d Dunetz observes. This is backpedaling on a scale one would only expect to see if a pack of velociraptors appeared at the finish line of the Tour de France. It doesn\u2019t help that reporters slipped a few \u201cnone of this can be confirmed\u201d caveats into their stories  \u2014   caveats that were, of course, left out by the many social media loudspeakers that blasted their incendiary headlines into Twitter streams and Facebook feeds.  There were always cracks in the media\u2019s   stories. As of yesterday, the cracks became more important than the stories. Suddenly the media is shrieking at us for daring to take their coverage seriously. The problem with major media coverage of intelligence stories is that top officials and policymakers always have more information than the public. The mainstream press has gone so berserk with anonymous leaks since Trump won the 2016 election that We the People have no logical means of fully evaluating anything they write. We don\u2019t know who the sources for these stories are, or what their agenda is  \u2014   although skeptical readers can guess, based on how most of these anonymous leaks cut against the new White House. Kellyanne Conway made this point on Fox  Friends Monday, when she argued that President Trump \u201chas information and intelligence that the rest of us do not\u201d: \u201dHe\u2019s the President of the United States. He has information and intelligence that the rest of us do not.\u201d  \u2014  @KellyannePolls pic. twitter.   \u2014   FOX  friends (@foxandfriends) March 6, 2017,  We\u2019ve heard such assertions many times before, from both sides of the partisan divide. For example, the defenders of NSA surveillance operations insisted they were useful for preserving national security, but they couldn\u2019t give us the classified details that would prove it. Critics had the same problem from the opposite direction. Many national security and law enforcement debates end with assurances that our top men and women know things they can\u2019t tell us about. Until now, media coverage has been driven by anonymous leakers who assured us they know things they can\u2019t tell us about, peddling a few juicy tidbits they weren\u2019t supposed to talk about. The President of the United States is very well situated to play that game too.  If Trump is strictly going by the reports from big media outlets and their favorite leakers, whose fault is it that he became convinced the Obama administration was spying on him? Mark Levin hit that point in his response to the CNN article: I simply put together the stories that YOUR profession reported, on the public record.  Do you deny there were two FISA applications?  Do you deny the first was turned down?  Do you deny the second was approved?  It\u2019s called the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.  It is about surveillance.  The fact that we cannot discern all the details because of the secrecy, except for what the media have revealed and selective leaks by the government, should cause you to want to know more, not to trash those who point it out.   And yes, we can make several logical implications based on events and experience.   A FISA application is a big deal.  One, or two in this case, that involve campaign surrogates, or a server or computer related to a candidate or campaign, etc. is a big deal.  President Obama\u2019s statement is not a definitive statement of anything, other than he, personally, did not order a wiretap, which I never claimed.  But that does not mean he was unaware of surveillance activity by several of his departments, even through routine reports to the president, such as the Daily Intel Briefing or information conveyed to him or his staff via the Justice Department re the FBI   activities. Levin noted that in the course of denying any FISA surveillance was conducted against Trump Tower, James Clapper also said \u201cno connections between the Russians and the Trump campaign have been found. \u201d That is   \u2026     rather different from the conclusion one would reach by ingesting mainstream media coverage over the past few months, isn\u2019t it?  Perhaps CNN should take a break from sneering at \u201c  conspiracy theories\u201d and take a look at what   blogs have been saying about the   story. Until yesterday, they were firmly convinced that extensive surveillance was conducted against Trump and his campaign, and it produced all kinds of damaging information. President Trump is gambling a good deal of credibility with his accusation of Obama wiretapping. The Obama officials and Big Media outlets sitting across the table from him don\u2019t have much credibility to ante up against him. Complicated controversies usually have complex outcomes, so the smart bet is that both sides will end up with something that allows them to claim vindication, and we\u2019ll most likely have another credibility smackdown. Meanwhile, we\u2019ll probably see a sharp decrease in reports based on leaked material the media insisted was genuine, right up until the moment Donald Trump believed them.'"}, "time": 1742563492.6867867}
