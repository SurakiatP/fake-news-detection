[\u201cAs Donald Trump said in the course of the campaign, I think we have to get clarity as to the nature of the problem we\u2019re facing. It behooves us, before we start contorting ourselves even more than we have of late, to be honest about the nature of the threat,\u201d Gaffney said.  \u201cI think during the course of the campaign, Candidate Trump made great strides in trying to do that. He used the term \u2018radical Islamic terrorism.\u2019 We can quibble about that. I think a more accurate way to depict it  \u2014   as we\u2019ve discussed before, Raheem  \u2014   is \u2018sharia supremacism,\u2019\u201d he suggested. Gaffney went on to define sharia supremacism as not merely a personal dedication to following Islamic law, but a divine obligation \u201cto impose it on everybody else. \u201d Kassam noted that \u201csharia, in and of itself as a word, implies supremacy. \u201d \u201cIt does, and it actually explicitly commands its adherents to engage in supremacism, so there is a certain redundancy,\u201d Gaffney acknowledged.  \u201cBut I think it is the active nature of this that is the problem we have to come to grips with,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd when we hear the British government  \u2014   or, for that matter, President Trump of late  \u2014   talking about the threat in terms of extremism, or in terms of \u2018lone wolves\u2019 or people who have no connection with organized efforts, or are otherwise cast in terms that I think obscure their fidelity to this agenda, which is unfortunately part and parcel of what authoritative Islam describes, it is I think a formula for more loss of life and more distortion of our societies. Because as a practical matter, it comes down to our submission, and that\u2019s really the rub of the issue. \u201d Kassam cited reports that National Security Adviser General H. R. McMaster is one of the leading voices in the Trump administration seeking to divorce Islam from terrorism by defining it as inherently \u201c . \u201d \u201cI believe he is not the only promoter of this notion,\u201d Gaffney said. \u201cI think that there are large numbers of people who previously advanced this mistaken and seriously   characterization of the problem that are holdovers from the previous administration. \u201d \u201cIn addition to General McMaster, there are some that have been brought in by the president, I think to his great detriment,\u201d he continued. \u201cTo my way of thinking, he had this right before he came to office in the early days. I think since then, this has become much, much less clear, and to some extent has now become obscured in part, let\u2019s be honest, by the notion that we\u2019re going to find ourselves forging common cause with folks like the Saudis and the Qataris, the Turks, who include among them  \u2014   let us be clear  \u2014   sharia supremacists. \u201d \u201cIn fact, it is the stated policy of all of those governments to promote that goal of worldwide submission to this totalitarian program. There are lots of Muslims who don\u2019t want to live under it any more than the rest of us do. Unfortunately, we\u2019re making now the mistake that the Obama administration made, the Bush administration before it made, I think the Clinton administration before it made, to misperceive the threat,\u201d he warned.
