The avidly pro-Clinton network was virtually forced to sever ties with Brazile by the new revelations from the latest WikiLeaks dump of John Podesta\u2019s hacked e-mails. Podesta, the longtime adviser/crony/fixer for Bill and Hillary Clinton, and currently chairman of Hillary\u2019s election campaign, has now seen over 39,000 of his e-mails released by the WikiLeaks hacktivists, and they have been very revealing indeed, exposing the corruption, dirty tricks, and criminality of the Clinton political machine . \\nBrazile, a veteran Democratic Party hack, has been serving as interim chair of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) since July, when then-DNC chair Rep. Deborah Wasserman Schultz, was forced to resign in an e-mail scandal that exposed Wasserman Schultz and other DNC officials blatantly taking sides with Clinton and sabotaging Sanders, in violation of DNC rules to maintain neutrality in primary campaigns. \\nAs the Podesta e-mails reveal, Brazile was involved in those same ethics violations, extending to violating the rules for the televised debates. The Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD), which sponsored the debates, states on its website : \u201cAll debates will be moderated by a single individual and will run from 9:00-10:30 p.m. Eastern Time without commercial breaks. As always, the moderators alone will select the questions to be asked, which are not known to the CPD or to the candidates.\u201d \\nHowever, that obviously was not the case, as Brazile was providing Team Clinton with a heads-up of debate questions in advance. The first Brazile e-mail to leak out concerned the televised CNN-TV One Town Hall event on March 13 of this year. The day before, Brazile sent an e-mail to Clinton\u2019s director of communications, Jennifer Palmieri, saying she\u2019s worried about \u201cHRC\u201d (Hillary Rodham Clinton) facing a question on the death penalty. The subject heading of her e-mail was: \u201cRe: From time to time I get the questions in advance.\u201d \\nHere is the e-mail, as provided by WikiLeaks: On Mar 12, 2016, at 4:39 PM, Donna Brazile <   >; wrote: Here's one that worries me about HRC. DEATH PENALTY 19 states and the District of Columbia have banned the death penalty. 31 states, including Ohio, still have the death penalty. According to the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, since 1973, 156 people have been on death row and later set free. Since 1976, 1,414 people have been executed in the U.S. That\u2019s 11% of Americans who were sentenced to die, but later exonerated and freed. Should Ohio and the 30 other states join the current list and abolish the death penalty? Sent from Donna's I Pad. Follow me on twitter @donnabrazile \\nThe following day, on the CNN-TV One Town Hall, co-moderated by CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper and TV One\u2019s Roland Martin, Hillary Rodham Clinton was indeed asked a question about the death penalty, by audience member Ricky Jackson \u2014 and HRC had a scripted answer ready and waiting. We, the public, did not find out that the game had been rigged until months later, when WikiLeaks released the incriminating e-mail on October 11. Nevertheless, even after the WikiLeaks release, most of the establishment media ignored the Brazile-Podesta-Palmieri skullduggery in favor of bashing Donald Trump over unsubstantiated, sensationalistic charges of sexual harassment. For nearly two weeks, Donna Brazile was allowed to wave off the e-mail evidence with diversionary tactics and charges that the e-mails are fabrications by WikiLeaks and Russian intelligence. \\nHowever, on October 20 Brazile was skewered on Fox News by a relentless Megyn Kelly, who refused to let her weasel her way through another interview. Not that the DNC chair didn\u2019t try; Brazile kept going to script, using every diversion she could muster to avoid answering the direct, careful questions put to her by the Fox anchor. \\nShe tried the Christian/persecution diversion: \u201cAs a Christian woman I understand persecution, but I will not sit here and be persecuted,\u201d Brazile told Megyn Kelly. \\nShe tried the \u201cpoisoned fruit\u201d diversion: \u201cPodesta\u2019s emails were stolen. You\u2019re so interested in talking about stolen material, you\u2019re like a thief that wanna bring into the night the things that are in the gutter.\u201d \\nShe tried the motor-mouth/repetition diversion, the total innocence diversion, and much more. \\nIt was still more of the same patently absurd denial and rehearsed propaganda by Brazile when Kelly confronted her with the undercover video stings of top Democratic dirty tricks operatives Scott Foval and Bob Creamer, who were caught red-handed boasting of rigging elections and admitting to inciting violence at Trump rallies . \\nIncredibly, Brazile insisted to Megyn Kelly that \u201cI always play \u2018straight up\u2019 and I\u2019m going to be \u2018straight up\u2019 with you.\u201d However, it was painfully clear by the end of the Fox \u201cinterview\u201d that \u201cstraight up\u201d Donna Brazile is as weasely and deceitful as \u201cCrooked Hillary.\u201d \\nIt is noteworthy that during her Fox News interview, when Megyn Kelly repeatedly asked her where she got the advance debate questions, Brazile fatuously insisted that she had \u201cnever\u201d received any questions from CNN. She continued repeating the same lines even when Kelly asked her directly if the questions had come not from CNN itself but from Roland Martin, the former CNN commentator who now works for TV One and co-moderated the Town Hall event. \\nIn the same e-mail thread of March 12 cited above, Brazile responded to a reply from Jennifer Palmieri. Brazile told Palmieri: \u201cI'll send a few more [debate questions]. Though some questions Roland submitted.\u201d That would seem to be a very solid \u201cclue\u201d that Roland Martin was the source and Brazile was the conduit to Podesta and the Clinton Campaign. \\nPolitico reporter Hadas Gold reported on October 12 that Politico had obtained an e-mail of March 12 from Roland Martin to CNN debate producers with the identical death penalty question that appeared in Brazile\u2019s March 12 e-mail to Palmieri. What\u2019s more, it was Roland Martin who introduced Ricky Jackson, the pre-selected, pre-scripted \u201caudience\u201d member who asked the rigged question about the death penalty. \\nAs Gold reports, Martin initially denied that he had shared his questions \u201cwith anybody.\u201d However, after being confronted with the fact that Politico possessed e-mail evidence to the contrary, he began walking the denial back to more ambiguous ground. \\nMedia \u201cUncomfortable\u201d but not Outraged \u2014 Deceit, Propaganda Continue \\nIn an October 13 interview, Jake Tapper said he has \u201ctremendous regard\u201d for Brazile, but said the WikiLeaks revelation was \u201cvery, very troubling.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s horrifying,\u201d the CNN anchor said. \u201cJournalistically it\u2019s horrifying, and I\u2019m sure it will have an impact on [CNN] partnering with this organization [TV One] in the future.\u201d \\nThe following day, on October 14, CNN spokeswoman Lauren Pratapas stated that CNN hadn\u2019t given Brazile the debate questions in advance and announced Brazile had resigned from the network. \u201cCNN never gave Brazile access to any questions, prep material, attendee list, background information or meetings in advance of a town hall or debate,\u201d Pratapas said in a written statement. \u201cWe are completely uncomfortable with what we have learned about her interactions with the Clinton campaign while she was a CNN contributor.\u201d \\nThe October 30 WikiLeaks release contains another Brazile-DNC-Podesta debate revelation, concerning the March 6 debate in Flint, Michigan, where Democrat Party operatives and their media allies have transformed lead poisoning into a false national issue with which to clobber Republicans. The Clinton-Sanders Democratic primary debate was hosted by CNN and moderated by Anderson Cooper. (See the full debate here .) \\nThe event was held in Flint at Clinton\u2019s request, as she herself pointed out during the course of the debate. A Brazile e-mail from March 5 of this year to Podesta and Palmieri, is entitled: \u201cOne of the questions directed to HRC tomorrow is from a woman with a rash.\u201d \\n\u201cHer family has lead poison and she will ask what, if anything, will Hillary do as president to help the ppl of Flint\u201d Brazile\u2019s e-mail goes on to alert Hillary\u2019s debate coaches. Sure enough, the lead poisoning question came up on cue, and HRC slammed in another easy homerun answer. \\nYes, many in the pro-Clinton media industry are \u201cuncomfortable\u201d with the WikiLeaks revelations, but, judging from their continued overwhelmingly slanted coverage, the discomfort comes from being exposed, not from being disgusted with the serial cheating and lying of the Clinton camp and their media allies. There has been precious little outrage expressed by the pro-Clinton mainstream media elites of the kind and volume that would have gushed forth if the same rigging had been perpetrated by the Trump Campaign. There have been no media-orchestrated calls for TV One to fire Roland Martin, nor for the DNC to fire Donna Brazile, nor for Hillary Clinton to fire John Podesta and Jennifer Palmieri. \\nThe Brazile-Podesta-Palmieri debate e-mails are damning, but, arguably, not as serious as the many other revelations concerning the Clinton family\u2019s rampant criminality on national security matters such as Uranium One, and the \u201cpay-to-play\u201d wheeling-dealing at the HRC State Department and the Clinton Foundation. However, the WikiLeaks e-mails released thus far have shown an alarming willingness and ability of Hillary Rodham Clinton and her DNC-Big Media allies to rig the election debates. And the ones we\u2019ve seen may be only the tip of the iceberg. If this is the case in the primaries, are Donald Trump\u2019s charges about rigging the November 8 election really all that outlandish, as the pro-Clinton media choir would have us believe? \\nRelated articles :\""}, "time": 1742628584.5843546}
