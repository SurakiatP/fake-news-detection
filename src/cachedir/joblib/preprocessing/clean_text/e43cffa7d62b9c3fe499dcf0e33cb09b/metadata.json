Trump said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to telegraph what I\u2019m doing or what I\u2019m thinking. I\u2019m not like other administrations, where they say we\u2019re going to do this in four weeks. It doesn\u2019t work that way. We\u2019ll see what happens. I hope things work out well. I hope there\u2019s going to be peace, but they\u2019ve been talking with this gentleman for a long time. You read Clinton\u2019s book and he said, \u2018Oh, we made such a great peace deal\u2019 and it was a joke. You look at different things over the years with President Obama. Everybody has been outplayed.  They\u2019ve all been outplayed by this gentleman and we\u2019ll see what happens. I just don\u2019t telegraph my moves. \u201d (  The Hill) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742564224.159925}
