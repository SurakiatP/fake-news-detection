All three reinforce the premise in my headline. But it was the following statement that haunted Trump\u2019s campaign from the second the words left his mouth: \\nWhen Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best. They\u2019re not sending you. They\u2019re not sending you. They\u2019re sending people that have lots of problems, and they\u2019re bringing those problems with us. They\u2019re bringing drugs, they\u2019re bringing crime, they\u2019re rapists, and some, I assume, are good people. \\nWatching Trump say that on live television, I immediately thought, \u201cThere goes the Hispanic vote!\u201d The fact is demographic voter data shows that for a Republican to be elected president, he or she must win at least 47% of the national Hispanic vote. Then poof, in one 20-second rant, Trump destroyed all the Republican Party\u2019s Hispanic outreach rendered since Romney won only 27% of the Hispanic vote in 2012. \\nFrom the \u201cimpression list,\u201d Trump\u2019s inartful Mexican statement branded him with \u201clacks a political filter,\u201d and \u201clacks presidential demeanor\u201d to put it mildly. These two major negative \u201cbranding phrases\u201d may have begun with his much-maligned Mexican comments, but later applied to numerous Trump-isms which popped up over the last year slowly undermining and unraveling his chances of ever winning 270 electoral votes. \\nNext is a Trump foreign policy gem about terrorism: \\nIslamic terrorism is eating large portions of the Mideast. They\u2019ve become rich. I\u2019m in competition with them. \\nWhat the #@& does that mean? Let\u2019s go to the \u201cimpression list\u201d where we apply incoherent, inarticulate, uninformed, and desperately in need of a speech writer , to name just a few. And once again, repeat after me: \u201cAall we need to know we learned\u2026.\u201d \\nFor my last selection, I chose an example of how Trump, right out of the starting gate, tried to antagonize and denigrate other Republican presidential candidates (and later high-ranking party leaders.) It is important to note that Trump made the following statement within the first minute of his announcement speech: \\nThe other candidates \u2014 they went in, they didn\u2019t know the air conditioning didn\u2019t work. They sweated like dogs. They didn\u2019t know the room was too big because they didn\u2019t have anybody there. How are they gonna beat ISIS? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gonna happen. \\nYikes! That nonsensical statement exploded the \u201cimpression list.\u201d It was the opening act of an obstinate candidate who, we found out too late, is totally resistant to change even after his campaign began its slow-motion meltdown. \\nSadly, Trump\u2019s announcement speech stands as living proof that he flunked kindergarten etiquette. Circling back to Flughum\u2019s theory, during his campaign, Trump never learned to clean up his own mess and has never said he was sorry after hurting someone (or a group of someones.) \\nIn the end, Trump\u2019s likely defeat will be written off as an historical fluke. He will be viewed as a charismatic, untested, one-time outsider candidate who spearheaded a successful movement of fed-up voters. Through his celebrity status, he managed to parlay mass frustration into winning the Republican presidential nomination but, along the way neglected to learn the basics of kindergarten-level political behavior. \\nThe views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the editors. \\nCross-posted at RedState'"}, "time": 1742628523.5820498}
