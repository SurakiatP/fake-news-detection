[De L\u00e9on, who introduced the bill, made his remarks at a hearing in Sacramento on SB54, the bill to make California a \u201cSanctuary State. \u201d  He said (at 1:27:34 in the video that follows):   \u2026     I can tell you half of my family would be eligible for deportation under [President Donald Trump\u2019s] executive order, because if they got a false Social Security card, if they got a false identification, if they got a false driver\u2019s license prior to us passing AB60, if they got a false green card, and anyone who has family members, you know, who are undocumented knows that almost entirely everybody has secured some sort of false identification. That\u2019s what you need to survive, to work. They are eligible for massive deportation. Testifying before the Senate Public Safety Committee, De L\u00e9on defended the widespread practice by illegal aliens of using fraudulent documents to work and obtain   benefits, dismissing any concerns California citizens may have about being the target of identity theft. In an interview the following day on KPCC 89. 3\u2019s Air Talk with Larry Mantle, De L\u00e9on expressed outrage that President Trump\u2019s executive order would include those who possess fraudulent documents or committed identity theft to obtain a Social Security number. \u201cSomeone simply who received or purchased a [fraudulent] Social Security card down at McArthur Park, or elsewhere in my district would be eligible immediately for mass deportation,\u201d De L\u00e9on said (at 11:45 in the link above). \u201cHe\u2019s trying to deputize police officers  \u2014   and with the suspicion of someone being a criminal or having a broken taillight, that they themselves, as a local police officer, could call the ICE agents immediately and have that person deported without even legal due process. \u201d Host Larry Mantle asked him: \u201c  \u2026     First of all, I just  \u2014   I want to make sure I understand correctly: You don\u2019t think purchasing a phony Social Security card and number should be a deportable offense?\u201d De L\u00e9on replied: \u201cI don\u2019t think so   \u2026     the vast majority of immigrants  \u2014   hard working immigrants  \u2014   have done that.  I can tell you I have family members specifically who came here as undocumented immigrants, and they did the same thing. That\u2019s what you need to do to survive in this economy. \u201d Mantle objected: \u201cBut of course the problem is,  \u2014   and I know people too  \u2014   who\u2019ve had their Social Security numbers and identities stolen as a result of that  \u2026    . \u201d De L\u00e9on minimized the problem, saying it was not the same as \u201cRussian\u201d hacking. Breitbart News\u2019 calls to the President Pro Tem\u2019s office were unreturned. Tim Donnelly is a former California State Assemblyman.
