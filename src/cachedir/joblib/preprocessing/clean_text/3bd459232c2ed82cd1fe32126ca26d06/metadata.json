The internal sugar industry documents, recently discovered by a researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, and published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine, suggest that five decades of research into the role of nutrition and heart disease, including many of today\u2019s dietary recommendations, may have been largely shaped by the sugar industry. \u201cThey were able to derail the discussion about sugar for decades,\u201d said Stanton Glantz, a professor of medicine at U. C. S. F. and an author of the JAMA Internal Medicine paper. The documents show that a trade group called the Sugar Research Foundation, known today as the Sugar Association, paid three Harvard scientists the equivalent of about $50, 000 in today\u2019s dollars to publish a 1967 review of research on sugar, fat and heart disease. The studies used in the review were handpicked by the sugar group, and the article, which was published in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, minimized the link between sugar and heart health and cast aspersions on the role of saturated fat. Even though the   revealed in the documents dates back nearly 50 years, more recent reports show that the food industry has continued to influence nutrition science. Last year, an article in The New York Times revealed that   the world\u2019s largest producer of sugary beverages, had provided millions of dollars in funding to researchers who sought to play down the link between sugary drinks and obesity. In June, The Associated Press reported that candy makers were funding studies that claimed that children who eat candy tend to weigh less than those who do not. The Harvard scientists and the sugar executives with whom they collaborated are no longer alive. One of the scientists who was paid by the sugar industry was D. Mark Hegsted, who went on to become the head of nutrition at the United States Department of Agriculture, where in 1977 he helped draft the forerunner to the federal government\u2019s dietary guidelines. Another was Dr. Fredrick J. Stare, the chairman of Harvard\u2019s nutrition department. In a statement responding to the JAMA journal report, the Sugar Association said that the 1967 review was published at a time when medical journals did not typically require researchers to disclose funding sources. The New England Journal of Medicine did not begin to require financial disclosures until 1984. The industry \u201cshould have exercised greater transparency in all of its research activities,\u201d the Sugar Association statement said. Even so, it defended   research as playing an important and informative role in scientific debate. It said that several decades of research had concluded that sugar \u201cdoes not have a unique role in heart disease. \u201d The revelations are important because the debate about the relative harms of sugar and saturated fat continues today, Dr. Glantz said. For many decades, health officials encouraged Americans to reduce their fat intake, which led many people to consume     foods that some experts now blame for fueling the obesity crisis. \u201cIt was a very smart thing the sugar industry did, because review papers, especially if you get them published in a very prominent journal, tend to shape the overall scientific discussion,\u201d he said. Dr. Hegsted used his research to influence the government\u2019s dietary recommendations, which emphasized saturated fat as a driver of heart disease while largely characterizing sugar as empty calories linked to tooth decay. Today, the saturated fat warnings remain a cornerstone of the government\u2019s dietary guidelines, though in recent years the American Heart Association, the World Health Organization and other health authorities have also begun to warn that too much added sugar may increase cardiovascular disease risk. Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University, wrote an editorial accompanying the new paper in which she said the documents provided \u201ccompelling evidence\u201d that the sugar industry had initiated research \u201cexpressly to exonerate sugar as a major risk factor for coronary heart disease. \u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s appalling,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just never see examples that are this blatant. \u201d Dr. Walter Willett, chairman of the nutrition department at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, said that academic    rules had changed significantly since the 1960s, but that the industry papers were a reminder of \u201cwhy research should be supported by public funding rather than depending on industry funding. \u201d Dr. Willett said the researchers had limited data to assess the relative risks of sugar and fat. \u201cGiven the data that we have today, we have shown the refined carbohydrates and especially   beverages are risk factors for cardiovascular disease, but that the type of dietary fat is also very important,\u201d he said. The JAMA Internal Medicine paper relied on thousands of pages of correspondence and other documents that Cristin E. Kearns, a postdoctoral fellow at U. C. S. F. discovered in archives at Harvard, the University of Illinois and other libraries. The documents show that in 1964, John Hickson, a top sugar industry executive, discussed a plan with others in the industry to shift public opinion \u201cthrough our research and information and legislative programs. \u201d At the time, studies had begun pointing to a relationship between   diets and the country\u2019s high rates of heart disease. At the same time, other scientists, including the prominent Minnesota physiologist Ancel Keys, were investigating a competing theory that it was saturated fat and dietary cholesterol that posed the biggest risk for heart disease. Mr. Hickson proposed countering the alarming findings on sugar with   research. \u201cThen we can publish the data and refute our detractors,\u201d he wrote. In 1965, Mr. Hickson enlisted the Harvard researchers to write a review that would debunk the   studies. He paid them a total of $6, 500, the equivalent of $49, 000 today. Mr. Hickson selected the papers for them to review and made it clear he wanted the result to favor sugar. Harvard\u2019s Dr. Hegsted reassured the sugar executives. \u201cWe are well aware of your particular interest,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand will cover this as well as we can. \u201d As they worked on their review, the Harvard researchers shared and discussed early drafts with Mr. Hickson, who responded that he was pleased with what they were writing. The Harvard scientists had dismissed the data on sugar as weak and given far more credence to the data implicating saturated fat. \u201cLet me assure you this is quite what we had in mind, and we look forward to its appearance in print,\u201d Mr. Hickson wrote. After the review was published, the debate about sugar and heart disease died down, while   diets gained the endorsement of many health authorities, Dr. Glantz said. \u201cBy today\u2019s standards, they behaved very badly,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742628520.516846}
