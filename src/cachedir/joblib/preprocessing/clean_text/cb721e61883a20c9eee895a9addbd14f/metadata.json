It has more in common philosophically with the podcast \u201cSerial\u201d (whose first subject, Adnan Syed, was just granted a new trial) Netflix\u2019s \u201cMaking a Murderer\u201d and this year\u2019s two O. J. Simpson series  \u2014     stories that suggest that who is locked up, for what, is largely a matter of resources and random fate. In the fictional \u201cThe Night Of,\u201d as in those stories, someone dies, and someone goes to trial, but the biggest suspect is the notion of egalitarian justice. The worst night of Nasir Khan\u2019s life begins with promise. The studious, sexually inexperienced son of Pakistani immigrants, Naz, as he is known, drives his father\u2019s cab from Queens to Manhattan, headed to a party. He\u2019s told there will be girls. He never makes it. Andrea (Sofia  \u2019Elia) a young woman with sad, faraway eyes, mistakes him for a working cabby and hails a ride. It leads to conversation, a connection, a ride back to her townhouse. And then to drugs, sex  \u2014   and Naz\u2019s waking up to find her stabbed to death. Naz (Riz Ahmed) is picked up for the murder, smeared with DNA evidence. In retrospect, you see how the creators, Steven Zaillian (\u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d) and Richard Price (\u201cThe Wire\u201d) staged Naz\u2019s last night of freedom  \u2014   a   college kid\u2019s walk on the wild side  \u2014   as a pit of circumstantial quicksand: the casual encounters that will become eyewitness testimony the chain of bad breaks, bad timing and bad decisions. Mind your armrests when you watch it all unfold you may clutch them right through the upholstery. Naz is interrogated by Detective Dennis Box (Bill Camp) a glum loner whose eyes tell him that the case is    even as his gut says something\u2019s off. Naz\u2019s defense falls to John Stone (John Turturro)  \u2014   a rumpled \u201cprecinct crawler\u201d trolling the lockup for work  \u2014   who lays out the stakes for a young Muslim in jail for killing a rich white girl. \u201cNot to sound like a teabagger,\u201d he says, \u201cbut how do you feel about America?\u201d Stone\u2019s part was meant for James Gandolfini (still listed as a producer). It would have been fascinating to see that bearish actor play a courthouse sad sack, but Mr. Turturro is a fine fit, as is Mr. Camp. They\u2019re a pair of scuffed shoes on opposite feet of the law. The early episodes have a theaterlike intimacy, and they pay close attention to the particulars of arrest and processing. Mr. Ahmed deftly shows Naz\u2019s dawning terror as his world becomes ever smaller the cinematography conveys the isolation, the disorientation, the feeling of being funneled down a dank,   chute into the system. It\u2019s a slow ride to hell, last stop Rikers Island. A corrections officer asks Naz if he belongs to a gang he doesn\u2019t, but it turns out that \u201cyes\u201d would have been the better answer. \u201cWell, then, good luck to you,\u201d the officer says. Prison is its own confounding gantlet, overseen by an imperious inmate, Freddy (Michael Kenneth Williams, characteristically smoldering) who may matter more to Naz\u2019s survival than any judge. The later episodes become a more conventional legal story, as Stone patches together a defense, and the case becomes Nancy   in the media. There are nods to TV legal series throughout. When Stone prints   graphics at a copy shop, the clerk asks if he works for \u201cLaw  Order\u201d prisoners at Rikers spend break time watching daytime court shows. The series excels at laying out the snowballing costs of a case, financial and psychological. Naz\u2019s parents, who lose their livelihood when the cab is impounded, can\u2019t afford a modest defense fee and have to make   decisions on the fly. They also lose a measure of trust in their son they want to believe him, but like us, they didn\u2019t see him not commit the murder, either. And Naz\u2019s experience in prison suggests that, convicted or acquitted, he will be permanently changed. As a legal procedural, \u201cThe Night Of\u201d is richly detailed but profoundly unglamorous. A running subplot involves Stone\u2019s unappetizing case of foot eczema. His journey from doctor to herbal healer to doctor, looking for a cure, becomes a symbol for the befuddling process of navigating the legal system. Justice, in this grand, grim story, has feet not of clay but of gross, itchy, mortal flesh. But still it must stumble forward.'"}, "time": 1742562125.608602}
