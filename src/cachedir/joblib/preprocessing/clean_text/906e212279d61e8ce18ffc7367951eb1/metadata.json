The conversation will be live streamed on our Facebook page at around 7 p.m. PDT. \\nIn March, Frank summarized his complex investigation of the Democratic Party and the answers he found: \\nAnd you know, we call it inequality; it is the one great problem that we have. And so my, the question in the book is [\u2026] the Democrats have been talking about inequality forever. This is why they exist as a party, is to take this on. Why haven\u2019t they been able to do anything about it? And the answer isn\u2019t what you think. You know, it\u2019s not just because Republicans are so diabolically clever and stop them all the time. And it\u2019s also not just because of the money that is sloshing around in politics, although that\u2019s [\u2026] a huge part of the story. But the answer is because the Democrats aren\u2019t who we think they are. You know, they talk about inequality, but their heart really isn\u2019t in it. Income inequality is really not something that they have cared about for a very long time. You know, there are individuals here and there who do, but you talk about people like the Clintons\u2014I mean, Hillary Clinton, her concern for inequality is, this is, I would say is almost completely feigned. \\nFrank also joined Scheer earlier this week to promote \u201cListen Liberal.\u201d Watch a portion of the discussion below: \\n</p><p>'"}, "time": 1742564620.3624253}
