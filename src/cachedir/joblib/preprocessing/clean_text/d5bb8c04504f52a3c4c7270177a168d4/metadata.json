( Which Hillary Clinton has called a \u201cshining example of a \u2018moderate\u2019 Islamic country\u201d ) WSJ Police said an estimated 100,000 people turned out for a rally called by hard-line Muslim groups against the capital\u2019s Christian governor, whom they accuse of having committed blasphemy. Blasphemy is a criminal offense in Indonesia and prosecutions have increased in the past decade. President Joko Widodo had met with other political leaders amid calls for calm, but critics say he has been too slow since taking office in 2014 to respond to worsening tension for fear of being labeled anti-Muslim. \u201cReligiosity is rising, especially among the middle class,\u201d said Yon Machmudi, an Islamic politics expert at the University of Indonesia. \u201cA sense of identification is increasing.\u2019\u2019 Protesters were taking aim at Basuki Tjahaha Purnama, known as Ahok, who is the most prominent politician among the country\u2019s often-persecuted, ethnic Chinese minority. He was elected deputy governor in 2012 and elevated to the top job in 2014 after his boss, Mr. Widodo, was elected president. Some hard-liners had tried to block his ascent then, saying Muslims shouldn\u2019t be ruled by a \u201ckafir,\u201d or nonbeliever. Mr. Purnama, now running for re-election, angered the groups again by citing a verse of the Quran in a public address in late September. He has apologized and said he would cooperate with a police investigation, but has since been the target of protests. Vice President Jusuf Kalla met a group of protest leaders and said afterward that police would pursue a blasphemy case against Mr. Purnama. Nearly 90% of Indonesia\u2019s 250 million people are Muslim and are becoming more radical every year as seen by head scarves for women, once rare, are now widely worn and Islamic schools are expanding. A movement to ban alcohol is gaining steam and sales have been banned from convenience stores. Travel to Mecca for the minor pilgrimage of umrah, once a relatively uncommon undertaking for middle-class Indonesians, is newly popular. Security experts say the rising conservatism paves the way for potential violence , pointing to some religious hard-liners who have rebranded themselves as cells of Islamic State. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen in the last 18 months to two years is increasing crossover from organizations that started out \u2018nonviolent but hard-line\u2019 to organizations which are now committed to using violence,\u201d said Sidney Jones, director of the Jakarta-based Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict.
