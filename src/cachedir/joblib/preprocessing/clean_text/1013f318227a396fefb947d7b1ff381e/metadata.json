And let\u2019s state upfront that we are talking here strictly in sartorial terms. There is plenty to be said about the more serious of Mr. Affleck\u2019s shortcomings, the ones that have led him to settle two sexual harassment cases out of court and that some say may cost him the Oscar. For present purposes, however, what concerns us is Mr. Affleck\u2019s bizarro style, a kind of slovenly and idiosyncratic take on normcore that conjures up images of every high school stoner you have ever met. Lately, the star has been seen in public a lot, picking up prize statuary and barnstorming the   circuit  \u2014   from Jimmy Kimmel to Jimmy Fallon to \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d  \u2014   for \u201cManchester by the Sea. \u201d In this immaculately calibrated Kenneth Lonergan   Mr. Affleck plays a Boston handyman descended into a fugue of volatile,   depression after a tragic series of events. Making his strongest bid yet for an Oscar, the perennially underestimated actor gives a performance so tightly coiled that it threatens at times to crash projection software in theaters and plunge audiences into the dark. Slogging his way toward the biggest award show, in February, Mr. Affleck has so far picked up Golden Globe, Gotham, National Board of Review, New York Film Critics Circle and Critics\u2019 Choice trophies. And he has become, for now, a regular presence in the press and on television, the thinking person\u2019s Bill and Ted. \u201cThanks for dressing up,\u201d Stephen Colbert said to Mr. Affleck last February, when he appeared on \u201cThe Late Show\u201d to promote his previous movie, the crime thriller \u201cTriple 9. \u201d Mr. Colbert was referring to Mr. Affleck\u2019s hardly bothering  : a pair of roomy khakis, sneakers, a rumpled blazer and an untucked   shirt. His hair, as is customary, looked as though he had combed it with salad tongs. \u201cI can\u2019t tell whether this choice is the least celebrity thing to do or the most celebrity thing to do, because it\u2019s very casual,\u201d Mr. Colbert told the actor, whom he went on to liken, with some accuracy, to a \u201c  Jesus. \u201d Mr. Affleck, of course, is far from the first star to use clothes to register his pointed indifference to the industry\u2019s sports jacket or penguin suit conventions. Turning up on Jon Stewart\u2019s Comedy Central show, Mr. Sandler once wore an oversize corduroy shirt jacket he termed a \u201cshacket\u201d while flogging a forgettable 2011 movie titled \u201cJack and Jill. \u201d At the time, Mr. Sandler said his wife had purchased the shacket in a bid to upgrade his wardrobe, though to the average viewer, the garment looked like something found on a Greyound bus. When compared with Mr. Sandler, with his customary Stu Pickles   Mr. Affleck is a   Cary Grant. He appears to own a blazer and a suit or two, and can seemingly knot a tie. True, those ties tend to migrate off the centerline, his shirt collars curl at the ends, and his hairstyles skew messianic. But at least he has not been seen in public wearing sweatpants featuring the dorsal cleavage often referred to as plumber\u2019s   \u2026     never mind. \u201cCasey always looks vaguely unshowered anyway, in real life, as well,\u201d said Melissa Toth, whose meticulous work on \u201cManchester by the Sea\u201d is a master class in cinematic costume design. \u201cHe\u2019s a scruffy boy. \u201d The   scruff on his chin is occupational, Mr. Affleck explained in   on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d grown for a part. Yet the truth is, it has been some time since anyone has spotted the      actor without the chin whiskers that are the male version of the eyeglasses pretty girls sometimes wear to make themselves look smart. \u201cScraggly\u201d was the term Mr. Affleck applied to his beard on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d and \u201cnot in a Santa way, more of a \u2018Duck Dynasty\u2019 way. \u201d And if scraggly is the image he has cultivated in almost every appearance, it\u2019s a look he may decide to polish when Oscar season rolls around in full. After years spent \u201cbanging on Hollywood\u2019s door,\u201d as Variety said in October, the time may have come, with \u201cManchester by the Sea,\u201d for Mr. Affleck to break through to the big leagues. And when he does  \u2014   as odds suggest is likely  \u2014   he may want to spring for a   shave and a jacket that fits, and learn to tuck in his shirt, industry experts say. \u201cAs a sign of respect, it is better to err on the side of dressing too well than not dressing enough,\u201d said Rob Burnett, the longtime executive producer of \u201cLate Show With David Letterman. \u201d \u201cYou want to avoid the possibility of ever looking like you don\u2019t care. \u201d What should never happen, Mr. Burnett added, is that a   host like Mr. Fallon, Mr. Colbert or Mr. Kimmel takes an appraising look at an actor dressed in clothes you might wear to clean out the attic and says, \u201cOh, thanks for dressing up. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628485.8425217}
