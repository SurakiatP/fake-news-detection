Trump backed away on Sunday from a primary element of his immigration policy, further muddying an issue on which Mr. Trump himself sowed confusion in recent days. Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, Mr. Trump\u2019s running mate on the Republican presidential ticket, would not affirm that their administration would expel the estimated 11 million immigrants who are in the country illegally, a   stance that helped Mr. Trump vanquish opponents in the primary race. Asked if Mr. Trump still sought a \u201cdeportation force,\u201d which he called for last year, Mr. Pence said Mr. Trump was speaking of \u201ca mechanism, not a policy. \u201d He also backed away from Mr. Trump\u2019s opposition to automatic citizenship for children born in the United States to illegal immigrants. On CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d Mr. Pence promised that Mr. Trump would lay out a detailed immigration plan in the next two weeks, though Mr. Trump has emphasized the issue for more than a year. Mr. Trump last week suggested a \u201csoftening\u201d toward illegal immigrants, then seemed to reverse himself under fierce and immediate criticism from some conservatives. \u201cYou see a C. E. O. at work,\u201d Mr. Pence said. \u201cYou see someone who is engaging the American people, listening to the American people. \u201d On Sunday evening, Mr. Trump posted on Twitter that he will make a \u201cmajor speech\u201d about the issue in Arizona on Wednesday. The efforts of Mr. Trump\u2019s surrogates  \u2014   who argued on Sunday that nothing he had said recently was inconsistent  \u2014   reflected a problem for Mr. Trump as he lags Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, in many polls. He enters the campaign\u2019s final stretch with immigration policies that are popular with his core supporters but not with voters at large. Kellyanne Conway, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, went even further than Mr. Pence, suggesting that Mr. Trump no longer favored the forced removal of illegal immigrants. \u201cHe is not talking about a deportation force, but he is talking about being fair and humane,\u201d Ms. Conway said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation. \u201d \u201cHe has said that, if you want to be here legally, you have to apply to be here legally,\u201d she added. The statement seemed to suggest that immigrants would be able to attain legal status without leaving the country, a position that conservatives call amnesty  \u2014   and that Mr. Pence said was not an option. Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that he agreed Mr. Trump had oversimplified immigration during the primary campaign. \u201cBut now he\u2019s reflecting on it, and his position is going to be known,\u201d he said. Also appearing on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d was David Plouffe, President Obama\u2019s former campaign manager, who called Mr. Trump mentally unhinged. \u201cYou have a psychopath running for president,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, he meets the clinical definition, O. K.?\u201d The host, Chuck Todd, rebuked Mr. Plouffe for making an unfair judgment. Conceding he was no psychologist, Mr. Plouffe cited Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cgrandiose notion of   pathological lying, lack of empathy and remorse. \u201d He predicted that Mrs. Clinton would win the election in a landslide.'"}, "time": 1742562268.9976127}
