Still, it\u2019s shocking that this is what our elections have come to. \\nA Trump supporter picked a fight with a voter at a Palm Beach polling place over his choice of candidate. The crazed right-winger ended up pulling a gun on the African American man who was simply trying to cast his vote. \\nAccording to the victim , Tobian Norris, he was on his way to vote when he ran into a Trump supporter intent on causing trouble. \\n\u201cI saw this guy, he was basically soliciting votes for Donald Trump and he decided he wanted to solicit me,\u201d Norris said. \\nHe says he made it clear that there was no way he would ever consider voting for Trump. After a brief discussion about Trump and his opponent, Hillary Clinton, Norris finally asked the Trump supporter if he had graduated high school and all hell broke loose. The man lunged at Norris, attacking him and knocking the phone he had been using to film the incident to the ground. \\n\u201cHe grabbed my hand and knocked the phone out of my hand and called me the n-word, and I just blacked out and hit him in the ribs, and he pulled a gun on me,\u201d Norris recalled. \\nWhen Norris defended himself, punching the assailant in the ribs, the crazed man did what any good Trump supporter would do: He pulled out a gun. \\nThe victim ran and was thankfully unharmed. This could have ended so much worse. The Palm Beach County Sheriff\u2019s deputies arrived and arrested the gun toting Trump follower. \\nNorris recorded the entire exchange and posted it live on Facebook.
