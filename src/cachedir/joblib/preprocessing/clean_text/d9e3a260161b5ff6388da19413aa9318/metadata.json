Tuesday who had congregated outside the Turkish ambassador to America\u2019s residence, most Armenians and Kurds protesting Turkey\u2019s increasingly authoritarian bent under Erdogan. [CNN cites D. C. officials as stating that nine individuals, most protesters, were injured in the brawl. An estimated two dozen protesters congregated in front of Turkish ambassador Serdar K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7\u2019s residence, some waving a flag associated with the Syrian Kurdish People\u2019s Democratic Union (PYD) which Erdogan\u2019s government perceives as a direct threat to the integrity of Turkey. Two were arrested, one charged with assaulting a police officer it is unclear whether those arrested were protesters or members of Erdogan\u2019s security detail.  Videos circulating on social media appear to show Erdogan\u2019s guards among the most violent aggressors. A video published by Voice of America appears to show men in black suits carrying Turkish flags  \u2014   believed to be Erdogan\u2019s security detail  \u2014   attacking individuals holding megaphones and protest signs. The guards surround a   man who had been kicked to the ground and continuously kick him in the face. Men who appear to be wearing D. C. police uniforms then attempt to surround and capture the men in black suits.  The Kurdish outlet Rudaw published an exclusive video showing the injuries of some of the protesters involved. One man, walking away from the incident with a bloodied face, tells the camera, \u201cthe Turks attacked me. \u201d   Speaking to CNN, a protester identified as Flint Arthur said that his group had congregated to protest Erdogan\u2019s presence in Washington and his \u201cpolicies in Turkey, in Syria and Iraq. \u201d \u201cThey think they can engage in the same sort of suppression of protest and free speech that they engage in in Turkey,\u201d he argued. A similar incident occurred during Erdogan\u2019s visit to Washington last year, in which Erdogan guards beat Turkish journalists protesting for their rights. Erdogan\u2019s government has engaged in a prolonged military operation against the nation\u2019s Kurdish minority in the southeast of the country, arguing that the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK) a U. S.  Marxist terrorist group, is a threat to Turkish security. Ankara does not distinguish between the PKK and the PYD and its militia, the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG) who are strong U. S. allies and considered the most effective force against the Islamic State in Syria. Erdogan came to Washington in part to demand that President Donald Trump rescind his approval of a program to arm the YPG in anticipation of an operation to liberate Raqqa, the Islamic State \u201ccapital\u201d and its final stronghold in Syria. A week before arriving in America, Erdogan announced his \u201cpatience has ended\u201d with the United States and its alliance with the YPG. Prime Minister Binali Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m reiterated that resolve hours before Erdogan met with Trump, telling reporters that Turkey was open to doing \u201cwhat is necessary\u201d to keep the YPG from participating in the fight against the Islamic State, implying military action. Shortly after the Pentagon\u2019s announcement that Washington would provide the Syrian Kurds with heavy weapons, the Turkish military executed airstrikes against YPG positions in Syria. While Trump confirmed in a joint statement following their meeting Tuesday that he opposed the PKK, he did not walk back his administration\u2019s support for the YPG.
