Jeff Sessions on Tuesday\u2019s Breitbart News Daily. [\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here is that, look, professionally, Jeff Sessions has the perfect background to be the U. S. Attorney General  \u2014   from being a line prosecutor working for the Justice Department, to being a U. S. attorney, to being the state Attorney General in Alabama. Professionally, he\u2019s got the perfect background for this,\u201d von Spakovsky said.  \u201cBut Democrats really don\u2019t like him because of his views on issues,\u201d he continued. \u201cFor example, they really don\u2019t want someone who\u2019s actually going to enforce our immigration laws. They\u2019ve been giving him a hard time in the civil rights area too, even though many of their criticisms really have been false. So they\u2019re going to give him a very hard time, even if they eventually, perhaps, on the Democratic side will vote for him, because they have to make their liberal advocacy groups that support them happy that they gave him a hard time. \u201d SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam suggested that Democrats would be \u201cuncouth\u201d to Sessions to gin up donations and political support from their base. \u201cYes, because I think that\u2019s going to anger the same people all around the country that voted for Donald Trump,\u201d von Spakovsky agreed. \u201cAnd you can tell how this is going because after Sessions testifies, they\u2019re actually pulling up a panel of other witnesses. And who have the Democrats called? They have called the director of the ACLU, the president of the NAACP, and a woman from an LGBT group. All of them are simply going to be critical of him on issues, not his professional background  \u2014   and that\u2019s not a reason to not vote for him for confirmation. \u201d Kassam asked von Spakovsky to discuss his recent article about how Democrats have tried to portray strong action against voter fraud by Sessions as a nefarious attempt to suppress the minority vote. \u201cWhen he was a U. S. attorney in Alabama, he prosecuted three local civil rights activists who were accused of voter fraud,\u201d von Spakovsky recalled. \u201cThey were stealing absentee ballots from voters  \u2014   black voters  \u2014   and changing the votes. Unfortunately, the jury found them innocent, and so ever since then, he\u2019s been accused of having pushed this for racist reasons he was trying to suppress the black vote. \u201d  \u201cWhat all those stories leave out is that the reason this case was prosecuted was because local black voters and local black candidates called the FBI and called Sessions, saying, \u2018Look, we think our vote is being stolen by these other black candidates,\u2019\u201d he noted. There was a power struggle going on inside the Democratic party. This was an   county, in these races. The federal grand jury was presented with overwhelming evidence that these three defendants were stealing ballots. \u201d  \u201cYeah, a jury found them innocent, but I actually found and interviewed the   career Justice Department lawyer who worked on this case, and he said it was clearly a case of jury nullification,\u201d von Spakovsky said. \u201cThese folks were local activists, and the jury wasn\u2019t going to find them guilty no matter what they did. One quick example: a family of six people,   testified in court that one of the defendants had changed their votes without their permission, and yet the jury didn\u2019t believe them. They, instead, believed the defendant when he said, \u2018Well, yeah, I did change their votes, but I had their permission to do it. \u2019\u201d As Kassam put it, Sessions was \u201copposing the exploitation of minority groups, and this is now being used as a cudgel against him. \u201d \u201cThe NAACP came down to this case, and instead of wanting to get these   convicted, they actually provided lawyers to defend these folks in the lawsuit,\u201d von Spakovsky marveled. He said the Democrats\u2019 position was a combination of instinctively viewing \u201cold white guy\u201d Sessions as a racist in a story of conflict with black activists and crass political opportunism by senior Democrats who know perfectly well what really happened in the vote fraud case. \u201cTheir attitude towards any voter fraud prosecutions has always been: if the defendants are black, well, you must be doing it for racist reasons,\u201d he noted. \u201cRemember, we saw that in the New Black Panther story out of Philly in 2008, when Eric Holder came in and immediately dismissed the voter intimidation case against them, despite the overwhelming evidence that the Black Panthers had been intimidating voters and poll watchers. It was dismissed by the Obama Justice Department because they didn\u2019t believe that black defendants should be prosecuted. They don\u2019t believe in the   enforcement of the voting and election law. \u201d As to Sessions\u2019 prospects of making it through the confirmation process, von Spakovsky pointed out that \u201cthere\u2019s not a single Republican that has said he\u2019s going to vote against Sessions. \u201d \u201cI really think the worst that can happen is the Democrats put up a histrionic, almost hysterical, raising of all these issues, make all these false claims against Sessions  \u2014   but in the end, like I said, the Republicans have the majority, and I think they\u2019re going to be able to vote him in,\u201d he predicted.
