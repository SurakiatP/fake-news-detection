[Palin\u2019s website slammed Kaepernick\u2019s donation saying, \u201cSERIOUSLY? Colin Kaepernick Just Pulled ANOTHER Political Stunt. \u201d  Along with its knock against Kaepernick, the article written by website contributor Mary Kate Knorr noted that Donald Trump did not defund the Meals On Wheels program, gossip site TMZ reported. The player, who spent the past NFL season protesting against the country by refusing to stand for the playing of the national anthem, recently declared himself a free agent but has thus far been unable to find a new team to continue his pro football career. The Palin article specifically cited the player\u2019s protests. \u201cHis last stunt cost him the respect of most NFL officials, as teams across the country have chosen not to offer Kaepernick a contract following his      stunt last year,\u201d the piece insisted. Kaepernick did make his donation after liberals and the media began claiming that President Trump\u2019s budget plan defunded the charitable program that feeds tens of thousands of needy Americans. But, despite the media\u2019s claims that Trump was taking money away from the program, a closer examination of the president\u2019s budget revealed he wasn\u2019t actually proposing any cuts to the program at all. Ultimately, after TMZ highlighted the Palin article, for an unexplained reason the piece was pulled down from the former governor\u2019s website.
