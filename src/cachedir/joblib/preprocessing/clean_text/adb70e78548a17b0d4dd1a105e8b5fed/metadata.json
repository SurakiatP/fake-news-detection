Although it is non-ionising, and does not destabilise molecules directly, evidence of other harm has been growing since 1950s studies on radar workers. \\nAccording to the updated Bio-initiative Report (2012+) by 29 precautionary scientists, effects on biology feature in several thousand, peer-reviewed papers. Yet troubling new findings rarely filter into the media. Or global Green discourse. \\nThough many studies have reported \u2018no significant effect\u2019, research by University of Washington biology professor Henry Lai, and others, reveals that wireless-industry funding is far more likely to yield such findings. \\n\u201cToujours ils cr\u00e9ent doubte\u201d (\u2018they are forever creating doubt\u2019), explains former Luxembourg Green MP Jean Huss, whose research on the wireless industry inspired the Council of Europe to call for many precautions (2011), including protection of warning scientists, and wired internet in schools. \\nBut wireless-product marketing has a loud voice. Few of us realise that genetic effects and free radical damage \u2013 both disease risks over time \u2013 are the most common, cautionary findings. Device-crowded spaces, such as our peak commuter trains or all-wireless classrooms, may be creating a subtly toxic environment. \\nWide-ranging, oxidative harm to animals has been found from WiFi sources. And linked pre-diabetic and pre-cancerous changes. Ground-breaking work by biochemistry professor Martin Pall , Washington State University \u2013 winner of eight international awards \u2013 reveals a viable mechanism for such harm. But as with other \u2018inconvenient truths\u2019, it is going unheard. \\nBee-whispers: the sensitivity of life on Earth \\nLife\u2019s exquisite electro-physiology is still being discovered. Researchers at Bristol University reported in May that bees\u2019 hairs are highly sensitive to flowers\u2019 delicate EMFs. In controlled trials in Switzerland, bees reacted to mobile-phone signals with high-pitched \u2018piping\u2019: a cue to desert a hive. \\nOther studies show that mitochondria , the tiny power houses in our cells, are at risk from our new EMFs. And that even DNA , in its delicate antenna-like structure, may be frequency-sensitive. \\nThe long-term, ecological implications of our new, anthropogenic radiation are not known. But peer-reviewed studies revealing harm to birds , tadpoles , trees , other plants , insects, rodents and livestock , offer clues. \\nBiology professor Lukas Margaritis, at Athens University, for example, uncovered harm to fruit flies from just a few minutes\u2019 exposure to our everyday wireless devices, including cordless phones, Bluetooth, and even digital baby monitors. Reviewing research, India\u2019s Ministry of Environment and Forests warned that sensitive habitats may need some protection. \\nThe UK\u2019s Digital Economy Bill , about to receive its final seal, has sensible proposals for increasing country-wide access to fibre broadband: a technology that does not, in itself, stoke microwave pollution, though wireless add-ons do so. But probe beyond the bill to Ofcom\u2019s 5G consultations, and new EMF exposures emerge: part of global trend. \\nThe worldwide rush towards 5G or \u2018fifth generation\u2019 wireless rollouts is set to raise our pulsing pollution to new levels. Untested, high microwave frequencies are being lined up to increase bandwidth, automation, and usage \u2013 at great profit to the industry. \\nThese millimetre and centimetre waves, though too weak to heat us, may pose possible risks to our skin, and deeper surface tissue, including that of plants. High-density transmitters are envisaged. A troubling prospect for the many hundreds of patients seen by professor Dominique Belpomme \u2018s clinic in Paris: patients whose disabling symptoms from wireless technologies are supported by new brain scans and blood tests . \\nA delegation of scientists have petitioned for such electrosensitivity to be recognised as an environmentally-induced illness , with an International Disease Code (2015). \\nRip-tides: when profits outpace caution \\nPushing for fast rollouts, the wireless industry is also in conflict with the Internatonal EMF Scientists\u2019 Appeal to the United Nations. Signed by 223 scientists from 41 nations, it calls for remedial action \u2013 such as new safety limits, wave-free zones, and education of doctors \u2013 to protect our DNA, fertility, and nervous systems, plus children and pregnant women, from growing wireless exposure. And from rising, mains-electricity fields. \\nSigns that such caution may be needed are growing. The pulsed, polarized , microwaves used by wireless technologies pose more biological risks than smooth or natural waves. Weak millimetre waves have a known potential to increase antibiotic resistance : what ecological effects might they risk, perhaps, if used universally? \\nStudies also reveal a risk to skin pain receptors . Published associations between radio \u2013 masts and skin cancers, though at lower frequencies, plus mobile-phone masts and EMF-sensitive cancers (Adilza Dode, Minas Gerais University 2013), raise further questions. \\nIn his summer press conference, Tom Wheeler \u2013 former head of the CTIA, the vast telecoms lobby- group, and controversial chair of the Federal Communications Commission \u2013 proposed unbridled \u201cmassive deployment\u201d of commercial 5G transmitters, taking off in 2020. \\nAnticipating \u201ctens of billions of dollars\u201d of economic growth, with US telecoms \u201cfirst out of the gate\u201d, he warned \u201cStay out of the way of technological development! Turning innovation loose is far preferable to expecting \u2026 regulators to define the future\u201d. \\nWith no mention of health-testing, carbon costs, or corporate responsibility, the FCC voted unaminously to go ahead by releasing swathes of untested high frequencies for private sector exploitation \u2013 so setting a trend. To questionable ends: added to other issues, how will our communities be affected by addiction to 5G multi-stream videos? How will it impact our spiritual communion with Nature? \\nMany American health activists, and cautioning scientists, are aghast. Dr Joel Moskowitz, director of community health studies at the University of California, warns \u201cprecaution is warranted before 5G is unleashed on the world\u201d. \\nFormer government physicist Dr Ron Powell points out the plans \u201cwould irradiate everyone, including the most vulnerable to harm from radiofrequency radiation: pregnant women, unborn children, young children\u2026the elderly, the disabled, and the chronically ill\u2026 It would set a goal of irradiating all environments\u201d. \\nFracking the air? Fault-lines in safety \\nThis drive to mine the electromagnetic spectrum come-what-may has echoes of fracking, and other headlong trends. In Captured Agency , the Harvard ethics report on the FCC, and the wider wireless industry, Norm Alster exposes ruthless \u201chardball tactics\u201d, supported by \u201carmies of lawyers\u201d, at expense to our health. \\nMicrowaves, Science and Lies (2014), filmed by Jean H\u00eaches across Europe, exposes similar patterns that are driving our pulsed radiation to risky levels. Western \u201csafety limits\u201d, based only on high levels that heat tissue, far exceed those of Russia , China, and some other nations. \\nProfessor Yuri Grigoriev , long-serving chair of Russia\u2019s non-ionising radiation protection body (RNCNIRP), warned the UK\u2019s Radiation Research Trust \u201cionising radiation is monitored\u2026[but] levels of non-ionising radiation are constantly increasing and ubiquitous: it is out of control \u2026 Urgent action is needed\u201d. \\nStealthy pollution-raisers, such as the 5G Internet of Things \u2013 with 30 billion tiny transmitters forecast for 2020 \u2013 and also, sadly, wireless smart-meters [ 1 , 2 *], vetoed by the American Academy of Environmental Medicine , may run counter to a cherished Green goal: that of nurturing healthy environments. \\nCan we manage our energy, perhaps, in more bio-sensitive ways? Court claims for wireless-meter health harm, supported by medical testimonies \u2013 including by neurology professor Andrew Marino (Louisiana) \u2013 are sweeping America. Professor Pall explains such meters\u2019 \u201chigh intensity\u201d microwave pulses may be more toxic than we realise: \u201cWe know from the nanosecond studies these can be very damaging\u201d. \\nData obtained by a judge revealed all-hour, house-piercing pulses every few seconds. New data-over-wiring innovations (if free of \u201cdirty electricity\u201d) may offer inspiring, alternative ways forward. \\nChrysalis: a paradigm in waiting \\nTo create \u2013 in Wheeler\u2019s phrase \u2013 a global \u20185G ecosystem\u2019 of wireless super-saturated environments, at insidious risk, over time, to living ecosystems, not least our own bodies, is dysfunctional. And spiritually disturbing. It suggests a mindset deeply at odds with the orchid-like beauty of the Earth. \\nBut cleaner innovations, such as LiFi , \u2018eco-dect-plus\u2019 phones, and the latest fibre-optics, suggest a wiser course. A new paradigm \u2013 safer connectivity, plus more balanced use \u2013 is emerging. And reminds of other step-changes in awareness. From pesticides to organic, from smoke-filled to smoke-free. \\nWe can accede, if we wish, to our rising, planetary smog. To safety limits as high as the moon, in many scientists\u2019 eyes. And to wireless rollouts\u2019 growing carbon costs. Or taking pause, we may begin to call the industry to account \u2013 plus governments lulled by it. \\nWe may air helpful new findings, such as risks from tablet-like exposures ( Alexander Lerchl , Jacob Bremens University, 2015). And stark risks from passive exposure, bared by Leif Salford , medical professor at Lund University. We may defend DNA, if we wish, from ionizing and published non-ionizing risks , just as we defend our planet. \\nAnd alongside French Green Party MPs Laurence Abeille and Mich\u00e8le Rivasi , plus the interntional Baubiologie movement, we can explore electromagnetic hygiene. Uplifting possibilities for a safer, cleaner world. \\nLynne Wycherley is a nature poet with six published collections. Working in parallel with pioneering doctors, she has been investigating non-ionising radiation for 5 years. \\nThis article originally appeared in The Ecologist .
