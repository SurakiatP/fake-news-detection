That\u2019s unfair to service members and to taxpayers.\u201d \\nThousands of California National Guard troops had been ordered to repay enlistment bonuses \u2013 some of more than $15,000 \u2013 that were improperly given to them. The Los Angeles Times, which first reported on the bonuses last week, said audits revealed the California Guard had overpaid troops in order to entice them to join and meet enlistment targets. \\nThe Obama administration has been criticized by some military families and Republicans \u2013 including presidential candidate Donald Trump \u2013 for not doing enough for veterans. There also have been bipartisan calls in the U.S. Congress to forgive the overpayments. \\n\u201cThe president has been pleased to see that in the last 24 hours the Department of Defense make specific commitments to ensuring that our service members are treated fairly,\u201d White House spokesman Josh Earnest said during a media briefing in Washington. \\nCarter, speaking to reporters in Brussels as he announced the suspension, said the law required the Pentagon keep open the option of someday again seeking repayment. \\n\u201cBut the point is that \u2026 there won\u2019t be any more collections until we put in place a process that can expeditiously and fairly deal with these issues,\u201d he said. \\nSenior Defense Department officials have been told to assess the bonus situation and establish a \u201cstreamlined, centralized process\u201d by the start of next year, Carter said in the statement. He added that about 2,000 people had been asked to repay erroneous payments. \\n\u201cThe objective will be to complete the decision-making process on all cases as soon as possible \u2013 and no later than July 1,\u201d he said. \\nThe streamlined process, which will build on existing processes, would evaluate each case individually, Peter Levine, acting undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness, told reporters in Washington. \\nLevine said the amount of the improperly paid bonuses was unclear but a nationwide audit had found that the issue affected people outside California as well but the \u201cnumbers in other states are in the dozens, rather than the hundreds or the thousands.\u201d \\n\u201cThe process that we have allows us to correct our records and to correct our payment,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not have the authority or the ability to go and change people\u2019s credit records.\u201d \\nU.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement on Wednesday that Congress would \u201ccontinue to work on any reforms necessary to ensure this doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742564368.154812}
