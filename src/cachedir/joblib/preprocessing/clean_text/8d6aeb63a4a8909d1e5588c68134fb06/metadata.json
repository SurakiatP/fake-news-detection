According to a senior law enforcement official, the gunman, identified as Esteban Santiago, 26, walked into the F. B. I. office in Anchorage in November and made disturbing remarks that prompted officials to urge him to seek mental health care. Mr. Santiago, appearing \u201cagitated and incoherent,\u201d said \u201cthat his mind was being controlled by a U. S. intelligence agency,\u201d the official said. Other officials said it was too early to tell whether Mr. Santiago, who was captured in the airport, had been inspired by terrorist groups, including the Islamic State. The officials said he had viewed extremist materials on the internet. Shortly after 1 p. m. Friday, the suspect, who had been an airline passenger, pulled a semiautomatic handgun out of his bag and opened fire in a crowded baggage claim area in Terminal 2, officials said. The shooting spurred a scene of panic and confusion that played out on live television as scores of travelers burst out of the terminal and onto the tarmac, running and seeking cover, at times in response to erroneous rumors of   attacks. David Fogarty, a carpenter from Key West, was heading to Canc\u00fan, Mexico, on vacation when the people around him suddenly began running toward the gates. \u201cEverybody was dropping gear, panicking, jumping over tables,\u201d Mr. Fogarty said in a phone interview. \u201cWe were saying: \u2018What is going on? Are there people shooting?\u2019 I am not hearing any gunshots, and the whole place is panicking. \u201d Officers took Mr. Santiago into custody without firing a shot, and on Friday evening, he was being interviewed by F. B. I. agents and county investigators, as the wounded were being treated at hospitals. The senior law enforcement official said Mr. Santiago was making \u201cdisjointed\u201d statements in his Anchorage F. B. I. visit. \u201cAlthough Santiago stated that he did not wish to harm anyone, as a result of his erratic behavior, interviewing agents contacted local authorities,\u201d who took him to a medical facility for evaluation, the official said. \u201cThe F. B. I. closed its assessment of Santiago after conducting database reviews, interagency checks, and interviews of his family members,\u201d the official said. On Twitter,   Donald J. Trump said that he was \u201cmonitoring the terrible situation in Florida\u201d and that he had spoken to Gov. Rick Scott. Hours after the attack, a picture began to emerge of Mr. Santiago as a man who had served his country, but who had experienced trouble and failure. Mr. Santiago was discharged in August from the Alaska Army National Guard for \u201cunsatisfactory performance,\u201d according to Lt. Col. Candis A. Olmstead, the spokeswoman for the Alaska Guard. In September, Mr. Santiago became a father when his son was born, according to an aunt, Maria Luisa Ruiz, a resident of Union City, N. J. who spoke on Friday to the newspaper The Record. In an email, Ms. Olmstead said that Mr. Santiago joined the Puerto Rico National Guard in December 2007. In 2010, he deployed to Balad, Iraq, with the 130th Engineer Battalion, which spent a year clearing roads of improvised explosives and maintaining bridges he was awarded a Meritorious Unit Commendation. At least two soldiers from his company were killed in insurgent attacks during the tour, but there is nothing in the record that indicates Mr. Santiago had been in combat. Ms. Olmstead said he served in the Army Reserves before joining the Alaska Army National Guard in November 2014. Before his discharge last year, he worked as a combat engineer as a private first class. An official service record released on Friday by the Army showed that Mr. Santiago had received a number of commendations, including the Army Good Conduct Medal. Mr. Santiago\u2019s brother, Bryan Santiago, told The Associated Press that Esteban was born in New Jersey and moved to Puerto Rico when he was 2. Nelson Cruz, a Puerto Rico senator who represents Pe\u00f1uelas, the city in Puerto Rico where Mr. Santiago grew up, said he met Mr. Santiago about seven or eight years ago, and found him to be a \u201cgood young man\u201d who loved his family. Mr. Cruz said he spoke on Friday with Bryan Santiago, who relayed that the family was shocked by the news of the killings. The family offered no known motive for the crime, but noted that Esteban had recently been hallucinating and was receiving psychological treatment. \u201cBryan said his brother went to Iraq or Afghanistan, one of those places, and came back with psychological problems,\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cHe would suddenly see visions, but that he was a calm young man and was never violent. \u201d Esteban Santiago liked sports (particularly boxing, as Bryan is a boxing trainer) and was proud of his military career. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what happened with this guy,\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cHe was an intelligent, brilliant young man who came back affected. When he came back from the conflict, he did not return well. \u201d He added that the family wanted to express condolences, but was in a state of panic over the number of news reporters outside their house. At a news conference late Friday in Florida, officials warned that learning the gunman\u2019s motive would be a long, complex process. \u201cWe have not ruled out terrorism, and we will pursue every angle to try to determine the motive behind this attack,\u201d said George Piro, the special agent in charge of the F. B. I. \u2019s Miami division. The shooting comes at a tense time for a nation that has been watching nervously as terrorist attacks have occurred elsewhere in the world, and as Mr. Trump, who has promised to bar Muslims from entering the country, prepares to ascend to the presidency. Officials said that he had flown on a flight from Alaska to Minneapolis, and then to Fort   International Airport. In a Facebook post, a Broward County commissioner, Chip LaMarca, said the assailant had been a passenger on a Canadian flight who had checked his weapon in his luggage and then, upon disembarking, went to the airport bathroom to load it. \u201cCame out shooting people in baggage claim,\u201d Mr. LaMarca wrote. On CNN, Mark Lea, a witness, said the gunman \u201cjust randomly shot people, no rhyme or reason. \u201d After the shootings, the gunman lay facedown, spread eagle and \u201cwaited for the deputies to come get him,\u201d he said. At that point, the gunman showed no remorse, Mr. Lea said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing. No emotion, no nothing. About as   as you could get. \u201d Witnesses also recounted scenes of confusion and fear. \u201cAll of a sudden there was a stampede,\u201d said Tara Webber, 41, of Allentown, Pa. who was heading home after a   cruise to the Bahamas and was waiting with relatives in Terminal 3 for her flight. Those who were not running, she said, \u201chit the floor. \u201d She and her father, Dan Trinkle, 63, dived under a set of plastic chairs. Ms. Webber said she almost landed on a little girl, who was crying, and tried to comfort her. \u201cThis was the scariest thing I\u2019ve ever done in my life,\u201d said Ms. Webber, who works for her father\u2019s limousine company. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get a car and drive all the way home. \u201d Her father said he went for the floor like everyone else. \u201cThen the cops told us to leave all our stuff and get out,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything was thrown around all over the place. \u201d Mr. Trickle said the police and airport authorities seemed unsure of how to handle the situation. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, they weren\u2019t prepared for something like this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were all out on the runway for hours. It made no sense. \u201d He said he and his family were allowed to leave after three hours and go to a hospital only because his girlfriend, Barbara Keinert, 57, had left her insulin on the cruise ship and needed another dose. The suspect\u2019s name was made public by Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, soon after the shooting. Mr. Nelson said he had learned the name from the administrator of the Transportation Security Administration, Peter V. Neffenger. Mr. Nelson said Mr. Neffenger had also told him the suspect was in possession of an American military identification. Barbara Sharief, the mayor of Broward County, said authorities were confident that the gunman had acted alone. \u201cBased on the preliminary reviewing of the footage tapes, he is a lone shooter,\u201d Ms. Sharief said. \u201cHe is alive, he was not harmed, not shot. \u201d Airport police officers chased the gunman through the terminal as he continued to fire before apprehending him unharmed near a departure gate and arresting him. The scene that unspooled after shots rang out was intensely chaotic. Live TV showed government vehicles blocking the roads to and from the airport and scores of travelers milling on the tarmac, apparently having been evacuated from the building. Some could be seen marching en masse across the pavement, wheeling bags behind them. Moments later, the passengers would burst into movement, like frightened birds, running one way or another, apparently in reaction to concerns, which authorities later said were unfounded, that more attacks were underway. A number of witnesses called in to television news programs almost immediately after it happened. John Schlicher, a traveler who spoke in a phone interview with MSNBC, said he had been traveling with his wife and    and they were retrieving their bags from a carousel when he heard the first shot. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure what it was at first, but I saw the person right to my side fall to the ground, and I turned and looked and the shooter was in the center hallway,\u201d he told MSNBC. Mr. Schlicher did not hear the gunman speak, and described him as slender, with dark hair, and possibly wearing a blue \u201cStar Wars\u201d   . Mr. Schlicher said he and everyone around him dropped to the ground. \u201cI put my head down and prayed,\u201d he said. The shooting came as Florida lawmakers were preparing to consider legislation that would relax prohibitions on firearms. State laws allow for the purchase of rifles, handguns and shotguns without a permit, though a license is required to carry a concealed weapon in the state. The legislation, which was proposed last month, would eliminate some \u201c  zones\u201d in Florida  \u2014   which currently include airport terminals, schools and government meetings. The bill was introduced by State Senator Greg Steube, a Republican and longtime opponent of   zones. As the false alarms subsided at the airport, the scene remained tense. Workers and passengers leaving the airport were searched by law enforcement personnel. Passengers who had been on planes on the tarmac were forced to stay in their seats, where they received updates from captains and crew members. Television news stations showed video of medics taking care of a bleeding victim outside the airport. News helicopters showed hundreds of people standing on the tarmac as an ambulance drove by. With the airport shut down, the Federal Aviation Administration said that flights headed to Fort Lauderdale had been delayed or diverted to other airports. A number of travelers described harrowing moments of panic. Melody Dorward and a colleague, Amberly Buccholz, had just stepped off a Spirit Airways flight from Ohio when they got caught up in the tide of people who ran down the terminal. They joined in and were directed out to the tarmac, clustered there with others, shifting from spot to spot. Rumors of more gunfire spread through the crowd, with many convinced they had heard shots. \u201cI called my family to say goodbye,\u201d said Ms. Dorward, 22, an   worker, \u201cto tell them I love them. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628490.8302517}
