LOUIS  \u2014   At the end of the United States women\u2019s gymnastics championships here on Sunday night, so many gold medals hung around Simone Biles\u2019s neck that when she walked, they clinked so loudly it made her giggle. A few times, she grabbed her medals to silence them and laughed yet again. \u201cI always have so much fun,\u201d Biles said later, after she had won her fourth straight national title in the   event and gold medals in three of the four individual events. The last time a woman had won a fourth consecutive national title in the   was 42 years ago. \u201cPeople think you have to be serious to do a good job,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think if you\u2019re having fun, you can do better. You can look back someday and say, wow, I had a good time instead of being so stressed out. \u201d That\u2019s easier said than done in elite gymnastics, a sport that can be a dangerous endeavor. One slip could break bones or tear ligaments, or possibly something worse. But this    attitude in a grueling, often solemn sport works for Biles, the   defending world champion in the  . And it makes perfect sense that it works. After all, it\u2019s fun to compete when you win and win and when the word around the sport is that you\u2019re the best gymnast ever. Mary Lou Retton, the Olympic gold medalist in the   in 1984, has called Biles the top gymnast in history. Nastia Liukin, the Olympic gold medalist in 2008, has said that Biles is a lock for the gold medal at the Rio Games in August and that the real competition is for second place. During the   national championships here, which were a   for next month\u2019s Olympic trials in San Jose, Calif. Martha Karolyi, the women\u2019s national team coordinator, watched Biles\u2019s routines closely  \u2014   often with eyes opened extra wide. After several of Biles\u2019s big performances  \u2014   and nearly all of them were big performances  \u2014   Karolyi said, \u201cWow!\u201d It was a substantial reaction from a woman who is the opposite of effusive: She gave two slow claps to Gabrielle Douglas\u2019s floor exercise on Sunday, and Douglas is the reigning Olympic champion in the  . Could it be that Karolyi was saving her applause for Biles, who can perform feats more difficult than those of any other woman Karolyi has seen in her   years in the sport? \u201cShe\u2019s definitely on top of my list,\u201d Karolyi said when asked where she would rank Biles on the list of history\u2019s top gymnasts. \u201cShe\u2019s a great combination of physical abilities and strong mind. Oh, that\u2019s what we want. That\u2019s a package!\u201d Her husband, Bela Karolyi, a legendary gymnastics coach, got to the heart of why Biles is often smiling and joking when other gymnasts look stoic or pained. He, too, said that Biles was phenomenal and that he had \u201cnever seen anyone like her. \u201d \u201cShe can afford to enjoy it: She\u2019s   she\u2019s doing so easily what other people are struggling to do,\u201d Bela Karolyi said. \u201cOf course she could be happy. Son of a gun, I\u2019d love to be that way, too!\u201d He added that it was \u201calmost a certainty\u201d that Biles would win the gold medal in the   in Rio. Based on her performance at nationals and most of her performances of the last, let\u2019s estimate, 1, 068 days, at least, that appears to be true. At nationals, Biles, 19, beat   Aly Raisman, who won two gold medals at the 2012 Olympics, by nearly 4 points. That means by a mile. It also means Biles could have fallen during several of her routines  \u2014   even   on the uneven bars  \u2014   and still have won such is the high degree of difficulty of her routines, something that sets her apart from her competitors. But there was no   stumbling from Biles this time around. While she did have some bobbles on her final two events  \u2014   the uneven bars and the balance beam  \u2014   she still scored 125 points in all. That\u2019s an improvement from last year, when she won the title by nearly 5 points. It\u2019s hard to believe that someone so good is getting even better. Maybe that\u2019s what has put her in such a sunny mood. Biles smiled nearly the whole way through her floor exercise on both days of nationals, as if she were dancing barefoot on the lawn of her backyard, with no one watching. While waiting for her turn on the vault, she started laughing just seconds before sprinting down the runway. That\u2019s just before she landed one of the world\u2019s hardest vaults  \u2014   an Amanar, which has one flip and two and a half twists. Judges awarded her effort with a nearly flawless 9. 9 for execution. Biles\u2019s control and execution are just so crisp that her competition can\u2019t keep up. Raisman, who was in her rotation group, watched and marveled at the ease with which Biles floated from event to event while Raisman and the other gymnasts fought to stay focused. Both train about 30 to 34 hours a week, but with much different attitudes. \u201cI could never be as relaxed as she is, never,\u201d Raisman said before explaining that her coach, Mihai Brestyan, had warned her not to let Biles\u2019s   attitude rub off on her. \u201cMihai said when you can vault like Simone, then you can relax. Until then, you just focus. \u201d For Biles, the sport may just be simpler for her than for anyone else. She was made for gymnastics, with a tiny yet powerful body that makes it easier for her to launch herself into the air and twist and flip. She also has an uncanny ability to understand where her body is in the air in relation to the ground, an awareness that was noticed by her coach, Aimee Boorman, soon after she started taking lessons as a young child. Biles is 4 feet 9 inches and so springy that she might have springs for joints, although that suspicion remains unproven. The Karolyis said that the last time they had seen someone as naturally gifted as Biles was 40 years ago, when they coached Nadia Comaneci, the Romanian gymnast who won an Olympic gold medal in 1976 and scored the first perfect 10 at a Games. Comaneci was not bubbly the way Biles is, though. Far from it. When she performed her routines, she looked like a somber scientist following the steps of an equation, so careful not to misstep. She was great at what she did, but it looked like work. \u201cNadia kept everything inside,\u201d Bela Karolyi said. \u201cYou had to guess what she was feeling. \u201d You don\u2019t have to guess what Biles is feeling. Her grins and giggles say it all. You don\u2019t have to guess what a massive impact she has made on the sport, either. For that, her collection of clinking medals says it all. Her 14 medals make her history\u2019s most decorated American woman at the world championships. Reminded of that, Biles, of course, grins. \u201cGymnastics is a very good sport because you get to smile a lot if you want to, rather than running around on a basketball court or something, where it\u2019s kind of hard to run around and smile,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I like the personality of this sport. \u201d It\u2019s loud and clinking, and it\u2019s clear that the sport likes her back.'"}, "time": 1742563049.9068472}
