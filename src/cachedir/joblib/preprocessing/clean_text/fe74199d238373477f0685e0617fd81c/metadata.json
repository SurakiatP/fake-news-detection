Judicial Watch, a conservative group that\u2019s been at the forefront of Clinton\u2019s email scandal, is already talking impeachment for the not-yet president. \u2018I know this generation of Republican leaders is loath to exercise these tools, but impeachment is something that\u2019s relevant,\u2019 the organization\u2019s president, Tom Fitton, told NBC News. Fitton noted, however, that congressional Republicans were unlikely to follow his advice. \u2018They see [the oversight process] as an opportunity in some measure to keep their opponents off-kilter, but they don\u2019t want to do the substantive and principled work to truly hold corrupt politicians, or the administration, or anyone accountable,\u2019 he charged.
