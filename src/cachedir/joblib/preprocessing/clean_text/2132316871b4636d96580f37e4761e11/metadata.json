She was 61. The cause was complications of uterine cancer, her brother Roberto said. In a distinguished career, Ms. Ifill was in the forefront of a journalism vanguard as a black woman in a field dominated by white men. She achieved her highest visibility most recently, as the moderator and managing editor of the public affairs program \u201cWashington Week\u201d on PBS and the   and   editor, with Judy Woodruff, of \u201cNewsHour,\u201d competing with the major broadcast and cable networks for the nightly news viewership. They were the first   anchor team on network nightly news. Last spring, she and Ms. Woodruff were the moderators of a Democratic primary debate between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders, reprising a role that Ms. Ifill had performed solo between sparring   candidates in the 2004 and 2008 general election campaigns. She also wrote \u201cThe Breakthrough: Politics and Race in the Age of Obama,\u201d a book published the day President Obama was inaugurated in 2009. Speaking at a news conference on Monday, the president said, \u201cGwen was a friend of ours. She was an extraordinary journalist she always kept faith with the fundamental responsibilities of her profession: asking tough questions, holding people in power accountable, and defending a strong and free press that makes our democracy work. \u201d Ms. Woodruff, in a phone interview on Monday, described Ms. Ifill as \u201ca fiend about facts\u201d who \u201cloved storytelling and loved helping people understand what was going on in the world around them. \u201d She added, \u201cFor young women of color looking for a role model, she was it. \u201d Ms. Ifill had taken a monthlong leave from her PBS programs this year without disclosing her medical condition. She went on leave again a week ago, missing   coverage. On Oct. 7, though, in an online column for PBS titled \u201cThe End Is in Sight,\u201d she volunteered some parting wisdom for candidates that, unwittingly, might have proved prescient for Mrs. Clinton. \u201cOnce a candidate, they can no longer claim outsider status, and he or she begins to look more ambitious than chaste,\u201d Ms. Ifill wrote. \u201cHillary Clinton was a popular secretary of state, but now she is just Hillary Clinton. There\u2019s something about actually wanting a thing that makes voters think less of you. \u201d The daughter of Caribbean immigrants, Ms. Ifill said she had known since she was 9, growing up in the tumultuous 1960s, that she wanted to be a journalist. \u201cI was very conscious of the world being this very crazed place that demanded explanation,\u201d she recalled in a 2011 interview with the Archive of American Television. \u201cI didn\u2019t see a whole lot of people who looked like me doing it on television,\u201d she added, but \u201cyou get used to being underestimated. \u201d \u201cI got my first job by exceeding expectations,\u201d she said. And she kept going: \u201cThis is the way it is. How do I get around it, get through it, surprise them?\u201d Gwendolyn L. Ifill (she loathed her middle name and refused to reveal it) was born on Sept. 29, 1955, in Jamaica, Queens, to the former Eleanor Husband and Oliver Urcille Ifill Sr. an A. M. E. minister. With her father being periodically reassigned, she grew up in several places  \u2014   Queens, Staten Island, Manhattan, Buffalo, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts  \u2014   living in church parsonages and sometimes in federally subsidized housing. \u201cI knew who these people were because they were me,\u201d she said of her public housing neighbors. Charlayne   a former \u201cNewsHour\u201d correspondent and a pioneering   journalist, said that she and Ms. Ifill, both daughters of ministers, were equipped with a moral armor \u201cthat served her and me well as we traversed roads not usually traversed by women who looked like us. \u201d Ms. Ifill once said that being a preacher\u2019s daughter also \u201cmeans you always have to be good. \u201d In addition to her brother Roberto, an economics professor, Ms. Ifill is survived by another brother, Earle, a minister and a sister, Maria Ifill Philip, who is retired from the State Department. She graduated in 1977 with a bachelor of arts degree from Simmons College in Boston, where she majored in communications. After an internship at The Boston   she wrote about food there before reporting on education in the aftermath of the tumult over busing to desegregate schools in Boston. Politics, she learned, pervaded every aspect of public policy. Joining The Baltimore Evening Sun in 1981, she was assigned to report on local politicians  \u2014   most of whom, she said, she found to be committed to public service. She left The Evening Sun in 1984, hired by The Washington Post, and covered her first presidential campaign for that newspaper. As a neophyte, she was usually assigned to losing candidates who, aware of her specialty, were none too happy to see her coming. Ms. Ifill joined The Times in 1991, becoming a White House correspondent and covering Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 presidential campaign. In 1994, Tim Russert recruited her to cover Capitol Hill for NBC. On her first assignment, she forgot to take a cameraman along. In 2004, she moderated the debate in which Senator John Edwards criticized Vice President Dick Cheney\u2019s former employer, the Halliburton Company, prompting Mr. Cheney to plead, \u201cI can respond, Gwen, but it\u2019s going to take more than 30 seconds. \u201d \u201cWell,\u201d Ms. Ifill replied, \u201cthat\u2019s all you\u2019ve got. \u201d She was also credited with raising an issue that more conventional moderators might not have: the rate of AIDS deaths among black women in America. Neither candidate was prepared to respond. In 2008, some supporters of Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska suggested that Ms. Ifill might be biased in favor of Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. Mr. Obama\u2019s running mate, because she was writing a book about Mr. Obama. Other Republicans, though, defended her as objective, before and after the debate. James Rainey wrote in The Los Angeles Times that Ms. Ifill had \u201creached a high standard for reason, fairness and class. \u201d (Queen Latifah played Ms. Ifill when \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d lampooned the debates.) \u201cMy job as a reporter,\u201d Ms. Ifill explained, \u201cis not to know what I think. \u201d She joined \u201cWashington Week\u201d and \u201cNewsHour\u201d in 1999. Her 2008 campaign coverage earned her the George Foster Peabody Award. In 2012, she was inducted into the National Association of Black Journalists\u2019 Hall of Fame. Last year, she received the Fourth Estate Award from the National Press Club. She was scheduled to receive the John Chancellor Award for Excellence in Journalism from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism this week. Her proudest moment, she said, was in 2011, when she found herself surrounded by civil rights luminaries as M. C. at the dedication of the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial on Independence Avenue in Washington. Ms. Ifill saw herself more as a reporter than as a news anchor, program host or moderator. She was reluctant at first to be installed behind a desk in a studio. \u201cI loved covering presidential politics not so much because of the candidates, but because of the people it allowed me to talk to,\u201d she said. Would she ever have wanted to become a candidate herself? No, she replied. \u201cIt\u2019s much more fun to watch and to ask than to actually have to account for your behavior. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628462.8989677}
