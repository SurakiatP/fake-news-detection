As it has been reported by geologists, for the first time this anomaly was discovered in 1960\u2019s, when scientists found a strange underground rupture along the Lake Superior that would run south. The discovery surprised American scientists back then since there were no mountains in that area. Following studies showed that this anomaly was stretching across the whole continent, resembling in its form and shape the giant cracks in the east of Africa.\\nIt\u2019s been reported that the tectonic plate beneath the southeastern regions of the United States is being fragmented by the layers of earth above it, which may be the cause of future earthquakes in the Washington area and other cities on the east coast, where basically no preconditions for the emergence of aftershocks, according to Live Science.\\nAccording to Berk Biryol from the University of North Carolina, in recent years the Washington area and the areas around other large cities in the east of the country faced a pretty intense seismic activity, which at first puzzled seismologists since the east of the country is residing on a stable continental crust that must prevent any earthquake from occurring.\\nIn recent years, the relationship between fracturing and the mounting number of earthquakes has been brought to light by the US Geological Survey (USGS), that would note that the number of earthquakes in the US has increased drastically over the last six years. In fact, it expects an abrupt increase in the number of seismic events in some regions of the country where fracturing is being used including Oklahoma, California, Texas, Kansas, Colorado, Ohio, Alabama and New Mexico.\\nBut the split in the United States is not being predicted by the USGS alone, since the recent seismic political events aggravated the growing discord within the US society in the wake of the US presidential campaign.\\nWestern journalists are sounding the alarm \u2013 America\u2019s youth is now fascinated with the concepts of socialism and communism. According to the poll conducted by the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation (VOC), a half of all Americans under 35 years would love to be represented by a socialist president. Politicians who profess capitalist views doonly receive the support of 42% of the younger American generation. This explains the spectacular rise of DNC\u2019s Bernie Sanders which would most certainly become the next president, if Hillary didn\u2019t use her wealth and connections to replace him as the sole Democratic candidate.\\nThe German newspaper Tagesspiegel points out that this election campaign \u201cundermines the belief that most Americans share the idea about living in a democratic and constitutional state.\u201d The newspaper notes that there\u2019s been a lot of speculations about the possible armed resistance to the \u201cUS corrupt government system\u201d lately, no matter how unlikely the future post-election violence may look now.\\nThe latest poll conducted by USA Today and Suffolk University shows that only 40% of potential voters strongly believe in the peaceful transfer of power after the US presidential elections. With six in ten viewing the candidates unfavorably, Clinton andTrump are the two most unpopular presidential candidates in ABC/Post polls dating to the 1984 election. This ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted by landline and cellular telephone in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 1,165 likely voters.\\nThe level of antipathy towards the two main presidential candidates in terms of party affiliation has also been at staggering level, with 97% of Trump supporters despising Hillary Clinton and 95% of Hillary\u2019s loathing the Republican presidential candidate.\\nIt\u2019s no wonder that there\u2019s been a rapidly increasing number of petitions on the separation of various states, which refer to the Declaration of Independence, where the Founding Fathers explicitly stated that \u201cany Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it\u201d To date, the petitions on the separation from the US have been filled by a total of 40 states. Texas that is viewed as the last bastion of conservatism has already gathered more than 100 thousand signatures under its petition for obtaining the status of an independent state. Behind it are Louisiana, Florida, North Carolina, Alabama, Georgia and Tennessee.\\nTherefore, aside from the major geological rift that may soon hit the US, there\u2019s a deep social and political rift to be observed, which may, in case of loss of all confidence in the existing political system result in a major outbreak of violence.\\nEarth has already witnessed the existence of two supercontinent \u2013 Rodinia and Pangaea. First, the former continent formed about 800 million years ago, until the latter one appeared some 600 million years later. Scientists expect that in the future a new supercontinent will be formed that has it own name already \u2013 Amasia. This continent will be formed out of the modern North America and Asia, notes the Nature.\\nWho knows, maybe before Amasia even emerges we will witness a new state or even two that would replace the US?\\n'"}, "time": 1742564267.2577612}
