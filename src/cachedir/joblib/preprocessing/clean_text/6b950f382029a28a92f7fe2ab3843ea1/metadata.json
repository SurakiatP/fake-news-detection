[\u201cI believe that, more more more, ISIS will be using its supporters in Europe to carry out attacks\u201d the head of the International Center for the Study of Radicalization (ICSR) at King\u2019s College in London told ZDF on Monday.  Neumann said it\u2019s important that people have a realistic assessment of the threat of Islamist attacks, but insisted \u201cthis doesn\u2019t mean there are going to be acts of terrorism happening in Europe every day, or that people should be frightened to go out on the street\u201d. According to the professor, authorities in Europe are generally   in the fight against Islamist attacks, but he stressed that security services need to keep a closer eye on people deemed to be a potential terror threat. As well as boosting the resources and capacity of   bodies, Neumann said it\u2019s vital that intelligence agencies leave no threat file unprocessed. \u201cYou need to have a concrete, integrated, systematic approach to prevention,\u201d he added. Speaking after the Westminster attack in March  \u2014   in which Muslim convert Khalid Masood mowed down crowds with a vehicle and stabbed a police officer, killing five people and injuring more than fifty  \u2014   the ICSR chief said that nations in Europe are going to have to learn to live with terror. \u201cJust because nothing happens for two months doesn\u2019t mean the risk of a terror attack being carried out has declined, and this is something we need to adapt to,\u201d he said. Neumann pointed out that while   agencies in Britain are far superior to those in most of Europe, the problem is that they don\u2019t currently have enough resources to deal with the huge number of threats.'"}, "time": 1742628422.934163}
