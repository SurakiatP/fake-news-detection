He thought it would be hilarious to dress up as a clown and scare people, film it and post it on his YouTube page, which has been viewed over 6.7 million times. \u201cPeople love comedy,\u201d Mohammad said.\u201d \\nWell, not everyone. \\nBecause at least one of his \u201cvictims\u201d was having none of it. \\nThe Stockton, California, resident was pranking people all day on Monday \u2026 he had a run-in with some folks at a Taco Bell drive-through, ran after a kid playing basketball and chased some men carrying a saw. \\nHilarious, right? \\nFor his next prank, he hid behind a bush \u2026 a man was walking down the sidewalk, minding his own business. \\nWhen Mohammad jumped out, well \u2026 you\u2019ve got to see it: \\nWMC Action News 5 \u2013 Memphis, Tennessee \\nThe man hit him with his gun. \\n\u201cWhen that thing hit me, I was literally like oh dang, it\u2019s a prank it\u2019s a joke, it\u2019s a camera right there,\u201d Sadiq said, telling a reporter he was almost afraid to run. \\n\u201cYeah. I seen the gun and if I didn\u2019t tell him it was a prank if I wouldn\u2019t have run I felt like he would have shot me.\u201d \\nSacramento attorney Kresta Daly says people have self-defense rights, WMCActionNews5.com is reporting . \\n\u201cSo, a person has the right to defend themselves using reasonable force,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably not reasonable to pull a gun.\u201d \\nThat\u2019s because in the video the man starts telling him the prank is not funny and then pulls out his gun. \\n\u201cBy the time the clown is saying it\u2019s a prank and you know, trying to get away and visibly being very scared, the threat has ended and the right to self-defense ends when the threat ends,\u201d she said. \\nSadiq and his camera man took off running and never looked back. \\nWhat is the lesson learned? \\n\u201cLesson learned is like people don\u2019t play with the clown stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cLike, people really will shoot anybody.\u201d \\nThis lucky clown is now hanging up his costume for good.'"}, "time": 1742561963.919329}
