Written by and starring Mr. Eisenberg, this lacerating comedy of humiliation  \u2014   about a whiny, rich,   and terminally narcissistic young New Yorker who impulsively sabotages his own life and that of his Nepalese roommate  \u2014   appeared destined to be lost in translation. Yet since opening in June at Trafalgar Studios, \u201cThe Spoils,\u201d staged in New York by the New Group last year, has become the   production in that theater\u2019s history. Scott Elliott, the show\u2019s director and the New Group\u2019s artistic director, now plans to help bring over more productions, starting with \u201cBuried Child\u201d with Ed Harris, seen earlier this year in New York. Part of the   success of \u201cThe Spoils\u201d is a matter of star appeal: Mr. Eisenberg, an Oscar nominee for \u201cThe Social Network,\u201d is in \u201cBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\u201d and portrays Woody Allen\u2019s   in \u201cCaf\u00e9 Society. \u201d But celebrity doesn\u2019t explain the hard laughter and, more surprising, the tears that \u201cThe Spoils\u201d elicits. As the run neared its Aug. 13 end, Mr. Eisenberg and Mr. Elliott sat down in the theater\u2019s lobby to discuss why their production has grown, changed and flourished on British soil. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. SCOTT ELLIOTT They told me early on, \u201cWe don\u2019t want you to get your hopes up about audience reactions. \u201d The sarcasm and the humor in the show is so American. So I was worried thinking, \u201cOh, maybe they\u2019re not going to get it. \u201d Shockingly, the response was completely opposite, from the first preview. I came to the conclusion that people just listen better here. There is an English tradition of   characters in comedy. JESSE EISENBERG That was my feeling. In terms of modern English entertainment, I really liked Ricky Gervais\u2019s character in [the original British version of] \u201cThe Office,\u201d and when Americans remade that show [with Steve Carrell] it was a lot lighter, and so I just assumed that my play would be O. K. here. Did you have to translate some of the cultural references for the new British cast members? ELLIOTT There\u2019s a lot of bragging in the play. So it was interesting to teach them about that, and it took a while. EISENBERG I as a writer assume it\u2019s totally   that when people brag, they do it with this kind of facade of humility to subtly apologize for what they\u2019re saying. And Scott picked up right away that\u2019s not how it\u2019s done here. People don\u2019t freely talk about their problems here, don\u2019t freely brag. Maybe it\u2019s like a tall poppy syndrome. Jesse, you do create unusually   characters, including the writer in your earlier work \u201cThe Revisionist\u201d [in which he starred with Vanessa Redgrave in 2013]. EISENBERG I wish I could say he\u2019s more   than I am. The way I see the world  \u2014   this is probably so pretentious and    \u2014   I don\u2019t see why people aren\u2019t reacting the way my character reacts to bad news. Which is he falls apart, he weeps and shouts, he screams at strangers. That\u2019s how I think the world should always be, but of course it\u2019s inappropriate to do that when you get a coffee and don\u2019t have the right change. ELLIOTT I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that our job is to make people feel something. I think what you do, especially in this environment, is to let people feel through you. EISENBERG Yes, I was being glib. I think that\u2019s the real thing. I feel like out of every kind of performance I\u2019m involved in, theater is still the best way to communicate a story to a group of people. I think there is so much value in putting myself through the very difficult experiences of the character eight times a week because I think it communicates  \u2014   on a   the human condition, and on a     malaise,   the fear of immigrants usurping positions of power from hegemonic cultures like mine. Boy, did that turn out to be relevant this summer. EISENBERG Yes,   nationalist, nativist sentiment has been so present, and the play culminates with my character screaming at an immigrant to get the hell back home. But I think it\u2019s important that we\u2019re humanizing the bigot, that you realize that Ben is someone who\u2019s   who\u2019s struggling through his inaction, struggling though his own feeling that the world is passing him by. And if we can understand that that\u2019s where it comes from, that it doesn\u2019t come from some kind of   assessment of the damage that immigrants are doing to the country, then you realize that it\u2019s something that can be overcome. Unlike most actors who write parts for themselves, you don\u2019t seem to feel the need to make the audience like you. EISENBERG The way I think about it is, if I\u2019m writing the part and I\u2019m playing the part, I can make the part as distasteful on the page as possible, and then every other ounce of me will try to humanize it. If I wasn\u2019t playing the part, I\u2019d worry more about the character being likable. Do the laughs come in different places than they did in New York? EISENBERG Yeah, there\u2019s two jokes that never get a laugh here. I make fun of Jews. And Michael Moore, who\u2019s a friend of mine, saw the play last week, and he was like, \u201cYou realize everyone in the audience is cringing when you make that Jewish joke,\u201d and I was like, \u201cOh, is that what they\u2019re doing, because they\u2019re certainly not laughing. \u201d And I realized two things: One is that there is a history of   that\u2019s closer to the surface in Europe than it is in America  \u2014   people are uncomfortable with hearing that stuff  \u2014   and I think they don\u2019t have Jewish stereotypes here to make fun of. The play is much more affecting here than it was New York, especially its ending. Was that song  \u2014   Billy Joel\u2019s \u201cSummer Highland Falls,\u201d played in the background  \u2014   there before? ELLIOTT No, I changed the tone. I knew that in New York people were struggling with the ending. It was: \u201cAm I supposed to cry? Am I supposed to hate him?\u201d For me, there\u2019s always this fear that redemption is going to be sentimental. But then I said to Jesse, \u201cLook, you have written a redemptive ending, and we resisted going there in New York. But that\u2019s what you wrote, and we have to embrace it. \u201d EISENBERG It\u2019s not a play about this guy who\u2019s mean and gets his comeuppance. It\u2019s about this broken person, and if you\u2019re not tracking that throughout the show, you\u2019re not watching the show.'"}, "time": 1742563180.6416233}
