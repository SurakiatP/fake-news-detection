Marine Corps and Navy following a nude photo sharing scandal. [\u201cAn interim revision to Navy regulations prohibits Navy and Marine Corps personnel from posting intimate photos \u2018if the person making the distribution or broadcast does so without legal justification or excuse,\u2019\u201d reported the Navy Times on Wednesday. \u201cThe statute details three conditions that will be considered a violation of Navy regulations, including if images are broadcast or transmitted: \u2018with the intent to realize personal gain with the intent to humiliate, harm, harass, intimidate, threaten, or coerce the depicted person or with reckless disregard as to whether the depicted person would be humiliated, harmed, intimidated, threatened, or coerced,\u2019 the regs read. \u201d  The new rules, which were reportedly signed off by Acting Navy Secretary Sean Stackley, are also set to begin immediately. \u201cIt is characterized as interim until the next edition of Navy regulations is printed,\u201d the Navy Times explained, adding that those who ignore the new regulations could be charged with \u201cfailure to obey a lawful order. \u201d \u201cThe addition of Article 1168 \u2018Nonconsensual distribution or broadcasting of an image\u2019 to Navy Regulations serves to underscore leadership\u2019s commitment to eliminating degrading behaviors that erode trust and weaken the Navy and Marine Corps Team,\u201d said Rear Adm. Dawn Cutler in a statement. \u201cIt provides commanders another tool to maintain good order and discipline by holding Sailors and Marines accountable for inappropriate conduct in the nonconsensual sharing of intimate imagery. \u201cThis article adds the potential charge of Article 92 \u2018Failure to obey [an] order or regulation\u2019 to the possible charges that can be used against an alleged perpetrator,\u201d he continued. \u201cEach case of alleged misconduct will be evaluated on its own facts and circumstances. \u201d In March, it was reported that both the NCIS and the Pentagon had launched an investigation into the scandal, which saw the distribution of \u201cexplicit photos of current and former female Marines and other service members\u201d through a Facebook group. \u201cA private Facebook group called \u2018Marines United\u2019 contained a link to a Google Drive folder, where the photos were being stored,\u201d reported CNN last month. \u201cMembers on the site solicited others to submit photos of women without their knowledge. The cloud storage folder has been removed at the request of the military. \u201d \u201cIt was not clear to the Defense Department how many current and former Marines may be involved in potential wrongdoing,\u201d they continued. \u201cA former Marine originally brought the matter to the attention of the Marine Corps last month. \u201d Since the beginning of the scandal, the private images have spread across different parts of the internet and were even reportedly found up for sale on the dark web earlier this month.
