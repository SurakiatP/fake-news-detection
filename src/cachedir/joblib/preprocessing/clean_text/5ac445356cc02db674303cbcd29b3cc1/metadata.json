After months of fierce debate  \u2014   including a brawl in Parliament that left one deputy with a dislocated shoulder  \u2014   376 of the 550 deputies voted in a secret ballot to approve the constitutional amendment, allowing it to pass without a public referendum. Mr. Erdogan is certain to approve the change. The contentious amendment was proposed after Mr. Erdogan called for members of the Kurdish People\u2019s Democratic Party, or H. D. P. to face prosecution for alleged ties with Kurdish militants who have carried out a    insurgency against Turkey. \u201cThis is a historic vote,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said on Friday, speaking in his hometown, Rize, on the Black Sea coast. \u201cMy people do not want to see guilty lawmakers in this Parliament, especially the supporters of the separatist terrorist organization. \u201d The H. D. P. is the   party in Parliament with 59 seats 50 of those lawmakers face prosecution. Under the new amendment, they can be prosecuted for a number of charges, including some for terrorism, and will effectively be removed from Parliament. Mr. Erdogan\u2019s governing Justice and Development Party could then call early elections that would help him establish an executive presidency and consolidate more power. \u201cWe view this motion as a political coup attempt to completely destroy the separation of powers by subordinating the legislative to the executive and leaving the former to the mercy of a thoroughly politicized and biased judiciary,\u201d the H. D. P. chairmen Selahattin Demirtas and Figen Yuksekdag wrote in a letter to members of the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France. \u201cThis coup would be a most crucial step for Erdogan to replace Turkey\u2019s parliamentary democracy, which he has twice declared \u2018de facto over,\u2019 with an absolutist presidential system in which the legislative, executive and judiciary powers are virtually monopolized by the president himself,\u201d they added. The constitutional change could complicate Turkey\u2019s relationship with the European Union, and jeopardize a deal agreed in March that renewed talks for Turkey to join the bloc and allowed Turkish citizens to travel in Europe without visas in exchange for Turkey\u2019s help in stemming the flow of asylum seekers to the Continent. Kurdish politicians warned that their exclusion from Parliament could exacerbate tensions in Turkey\u2019s predominantly Kurdish southeast, where the Turkish state has been fighting a counterinsurgency campaign against the militant Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or P. K. K. since the group ended a   last July. \u201cTaking Kurds out of politics and shutting down the political channels to resolve this conflict will only disenfranchise Kurdish youth further and push them toward a radical path in the fight toward great autonomy,\u201d said Kubra Demir, a Kurdish activist in the southeastern city of Sirnak. Analysts who have watched the debate over immunity in Parliament in recent weeks have likened it to a period in 1994 when Kurdish deputies from the Democracy Party, or D. E. P. were imprisoned on terrorism charges, which led to one of the most violent periods in the conflict between Turkey and the Kurds. \u201cIt took Turkey almost two decades to recover from that,\u201d said Asli Aydintasbas, a fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cTo repeat the same mistake would set back Turkish democracy for quite some time. \u201d She added: \u201cThis will neither solve the Kurdish situation or help Turkey\u2019s territorial integrity in the long run. I worry that Erdogan\u2019s zeal and constant targeting of H. D. P. for this is paving the path for actual division of the country further down the road. \u201d The change to the Constitution will not just apply to members from the Kurdish party as many as 138 Turkish lawmakers from all parties now find themselves vulnerable to prosecution. Several members of the main opposition Republican People\u2019s Party face charges for insulting Mr. Erdogan, including the party\u2019s leader who called the president a \u201cpolitical and sexual pervert. \u201d In a statement earlier this week, the H. D. P. said that none of the investigations into its parliamentary deputies were about concerns over corruption, bribery or theft. \u201cThey are all about freedom of expression,\u201d the party said in a statement posted on Twitter.'"}, "time": 1742564158.798167}
