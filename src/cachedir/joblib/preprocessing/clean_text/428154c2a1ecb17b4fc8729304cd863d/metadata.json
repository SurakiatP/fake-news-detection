This, as you know, is the programme of Marxist socialism and then of communism. Are you therefore thinking of a Marxist type of society? \\nA: \u201cIt it has been said many times and my response has always been that, if anything, it is the communists who think like Christians. Christ spoke of a society where the poor, the weak and the marginalized have the right to decide. Not demagogues, not Barabbas, but the people, the poor, whether they have faith in a transcendent God or not. It is they who must help to achieve equality and freedom\u201d. \\nPope Francis also used a familiar progressive expression surrounding immigrants. He said in part, \u201c\u2026we need to break down walls and build bridges\u2026\u201d The pontiff said in part: \\nWe must break down the walls that divide us: we must try to increase well-being and make it more widespread, but to achieve this we need to break down walls and build bridges that allow us to reduce inequality and increase freedom and rights. More rights and greater freedom.\u201d Wall at Vatican City \\nAs an aside, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerburg was quoted in April as saying, \u201cInstead of building walls we can help build bridges.\u201d Just one month later, Zuckerburg reportedly \u201c\u2026started buying parcels around his Palo Alto home to protect his privacy.\u201d 0 Gulag-wide Bulletins from Sovereignty Unbound We respect your privacy, time, and inbox.

As America threatens to shatter, we must see how a semi-covert, global, cartel collective and their NWO in the USA (\"progressive\" neo-Marxists and neo-fascists corporatists, updated with 21st Century techniques and technology) intentionally perpetrate this sabotage, while we patriots try to prevent it.

If it comes to it, do not even respond in kind, until after the after the first times that extreme, anti-American violence is done by them. It calls for an attitude of self sacrifice -- first cheek, second cheek, then no more. \\nAnd speak out about the potential and strategic \"sense\" of the Obama/NWO\\'s DHS carrying out false flag missions of violence, blaming it on American patriots, perhaps upon our militia movements. \\nWe are in a real war, right now (of which others and I have been trying to alert fellow Sovereign Citizens for years) and the prime war is for the minds, hearts, and wills of the American People. We are opposed by an anti-American insurrection using any means of power (see Gramsci, Frankfurt School) including government power, as they are granted that opportunity.'"}, "time": 1742562311.1820009}
