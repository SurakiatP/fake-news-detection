{"duration": 0.12668895721435547, "input_args": {"text": "'The media is beginning to demonize the manosphere and alt right. Twitter has suspended multiple accounts, such as Milo Yiannopoulos, Ricky Vaughn, and Matt Forney. The Guardian wrote a hit piece against the red pill . The media has called alt-right groups \u201cxenophobic, racist, and misogynist,\u201d despite not pointing to a single piece of evidence.\\nAs anti-Trump rallies continue to rage across the nation, in New York City, Philadelphia, and Michigan, the media completely ignores all of the assaults occurring on Trump voters:\\n\\nDespite the elites\u2019 attempts to destroy us, we are, in fact, winning this battle. The reasons why are simple:\\nTruth is always more powerful than falsehood We are too numerous to be effectively silenced We don\u2019t congregate on one single platform; we\u2019re a collection of individuals based around an ideology We\u2019re high energy, decisive, assertive, and confident men Below, I would like to offer the supporters of our causes some signs of hope. Victory is near, and Trump is going to lead the way.\\n1. George Soros Being Sued For $550 Million \\nAccording to Breitbart , along with dozens of other alternative news sites, Dallas Police Department Sergeant Demetrick Pennie, President of the Dallas Fallen Officer Foundation, is suing a multitude of individuals for inciting a race war:\\nGeorge Soros Hillary Clinton Jesse Jackson Barrack Obama The New Black Panthers \u2026and more Some individuals might claim that there\u2019s no way someone can take on this collection of massively powerful and wealthy elites in a single lawsuit, and they may be right. However whether or not this lawsuit is successful, is completely irrelevant.\\nWhat matters far more, is that the word is starting to get out there. The President of the Dallas Fallen Officer Foundation, an extremely reputable organization, is taking steps to file a massive lawsuit against these individuals. This will, at the very least, do several things:\\nPotentially serve a massive blow to the globalists Show the elites that we will not back down Generate huge amounts of public awareness Show the average gun rights promoting, masculine, traditional American that they have our support. And best of all? The lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, which means that the outcome will generally be good either way.\\nFirst of all, there\u2019s a very high likelihood of them winning due to the case being handled in Texas, a highly conservative state. Second, in the event that the case doesn\u2019t win, it will likely be pursued all the way to the Supreme Court. If this occurs, expect truly amazing things to happen. The reason why? The President of the United States is responsible for appointing Supreme Court judges\u2014and guess who\u2019s going to be President in two months?\\n2. The GrubHub Crash \\nAfter Matt Maloney, CEO of the online food delivery service GrubHub, proclaimed in an email that if you agree with Trump\u2019s politics you should resign, their stock dropped by nearly 10% in just a few days.\\nSince this time, in addition to his company\u2019s stock tanking, he has received ample backlash on sites of all manner: from Twitter to Facebook to Reddit to independent blogs to major alt-right news centers.\\nThis is what my fellow ROK contributors and manosphere bloggers were talking about when they mentioned the \u201ctangible impact\u201d of Trump voters. Hillary\u2019s supporters lack the characteristics necessary to make change:\\nA burning passion and sense of purpose Moral fortitude and a sense of justice Self-confidence, and the courage to stand up for your rights A fucking spine This is why we will win, period. The anti-Trump crowd is based around having a massive entitlement complex, a victim complex, not thinking for yourself, and being a blind social sheep. Do people like this ever have ANY political or financial power in the world?\\nOf course not! Who do you think all of the hard working businessmen are? All of the entrepreneurs? All of the people investing in the stock market in order to take control of their financial future? Hard working, intelligent men, who don\u2019t make excuses, obviously. And do you know what? These are the types of men that voted for Donald Trump.\\nWhy do you think the Dow Jones Industrial Average is at an all time high? Because Trump\u2019s win restored faith in America.\\n3. Rise of the New Media \\nThe mainstream media has repeatedly shown to be completely incompetent in regards to actually reporting on the issues; they are nothing more than a puppet show meant to distract, entertain, and brainwash the American public.\\nThey have consistently lied about candidates, manipulated the evidence, falsified facts, skewed statistics and polls, and defamed multiple individuals for a mere political opinion; this will happen no longer.\\nWith the rise of the new media, more and more men have begun establishing outlets across all platforms: Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Periscope, the list goes on and on.\\nI firmly believe that the next eight years will be looked back on by historians as one of the most important times in all of humanity\u2019s time on this earth. \\nAmerica has brought the world stability; we have stood as a symbol and an ideal for other countries to follow. We are a monolith of free speech, bravery, and economic prosperity\u2014and the elites have tried to destroy all of this to satisfy their greedy little egos.\\nThe men of America will not have this. Over the past 8 years (*Cough* Obama\u2019s Presidency *Cough*) we have seen an exponential increase in not only the quantity of alternative news outlets, but also the quality.\\nSites that were merely blogs a few years ago have evolved into full-blown news syndicates with live reporting, on-site video footage, and actual news anchors. This is literally the people fighting back; we want freedom of speech, and we will have it.\\nWhile the mainstream media draws its final breath, they\u2019re proclaiming that there\u2019s this \u201cnew, radical white-nationalist group called the alt-right,\u201d in an attempt to make us look like evil Fascists. In fact, I just had somebody threaten to kill me on Twitter , but was he banned? Of course not.\\nThis repeated favoring of violent, mentally ill leftists makes it very clear what the MSM\u2019s agenda is\u2014total control and a complete suppression of our freedoms of speech. Sorry, but the alternative media isn\u2019t going to let this happen.\\n4. Massive Boycotts of Anti-Trump Companies \\nThe left\u2019s hypocrisy never ceases to amaze me. Somehow they can completely legally destroy an independent, family owned business for simply refusing to bake a gay couple a cake, but when Trump supporters simply boycott a multi-billion dollar conglomerate, we\u2019re the ones that are hateful?\\nIn response to several CEO\u2019s statements regarding Trump\u2019s \u201cracism,\u201d and \u201chate,\u201d the men and women who voted for Donald Trump decided to simply boycott them. Despite this completely legal and anti-violent response, the left is up in arms.\\nHere is a list of companies whose CEO\u2019s have been caught attacking Donald Trump and his pro-American policies:\\nPepsiCo (They own Pepsi, Lays, Mountain Dew, Starbucks, and More) Nabisco (Their brands include Oreo, Chips Ahoy!, Ritz, and More) Netflix Macy\u2019s Ben & Jerry\u2019s Each and every single one of these companies has either spoken out against Trump directly, has refused to do business with Trump, or has moved factory production outside of the US (such as Nabisco, which has started moving production to Mexico). Some companies, such as Ben & Jerry\u2019s, have even openly supported the terrorist movement Black Lives Matter .\\nAgain, what do these actions signify in Trump supporters? Power. Assertiveness. Courage. A willingness to take action. This is why Donald Trump won\u2014his supporters are grown ups, not little babies who want more safe spaces and anti-free speech zones.\\nWhen Donald Trump\u2019s voters get oppressed by the biased, controlled media, or by elite globalists, they don\u2019t whine or cry about it, they just do something. They protest and stop supporting companies that are shipping our jobs away. They speak out in a logical, rational way against the anger and hatred that the left has towards white men.\\nThey take their lives into their own hands rather than relying on a stupid system that caters to cry babies and whiners. They take their health into their own hands, they take their finances into their own hands, and they take their relationships into their own hands.\\nThey don\u2019t wait around for someone else to do it for them\u2014they get it done themselves. This is why Trump got into office, and this is why we\u2019re going to make America great again.\\nRead More: 5 Ways To Start Fighting Back Against The Onslaught Of Liberalism \\n'"}, "time": 1742562632.4800913}
