Mr. Sanders, who was running against her as an independent, saw himself as a leader, and viewed Ms. Kunin as a lightweight. \u201cShe does very well on television,\u201d he told one interviewer. \u201cShe has an excellent press secretary. \u201d But really, he said another time, the governor\u2019s appeal came down to one trait. \u201cMany people are excited because she\u2019s the first woman governor,\u201d he said. \u201cBut after that, there ain\u2019t much. \u201d Mr. Sanders has long presented himself as an     politician from rural New England, now seeking the presidency with promise of a political revolution. But his combative side has now emerged as the Democratic race has tightened and Hillary Clinton has sharpened her own rhetoric. The result is a far harsher tone in the Democratic campaign and a transformed Senator Sanders, who is now making the kinds of   attacks that some of his advisers regretted he did not deploy sooner. But his aggressiveness also worries some supporters who were powerfully drawn to his positive persona that forswore politics as usual. The senator\u2019s assertiveness was on vivid display in Thursday\u2019s debate with Mrs. Clinton ahead of the   New York primary on Tuesday, which Mr. Sanders must win big to dent Mrs. Clinton\u2019s strong lead in the delegates needed for the nomination. But he is also seeking to match the vigorous jabs from her aides and allies, who ignored Mr. Sanders for much of last year and are now assailing his policy ideas and leadership abilities on a   basis. His advisers say he is reacting to the New York political environment as well. \u201cPolitical combat is more restrained in places like Iowa and New Hampshire, but it\u2019s completely different in New York, and Bernie has no problem defending his ideas in a tough way against Secretary Clinton\u2019s,\u201d said Tad Devine, a senior adviser for the Sanders campaign. Mrs. Clinton is now trying to hold off Mr. Sanders while not alienating his supporters, whom she would need in the general election. But she is also refusing to back down, and their spiky clashes are suddenly making for a more explosive and unpredictable race. More than anything, the recent Sanders broadsides reflect a political strategy he has carried out in previous campaigns: the use of blunt criticisms, sarcastic asides and a thundering style against his opponents. In the 1986 race, Mr. Sanders argued that he would be a strong feminist and do more for women than Ms. Kunin had. While granting that Ms. Kunin was \u201cnot corrupt,\u201d he questioned if she had the same \u201ccourage\u201d that he had. He repeatedly challenged her credentials as a fellow progressive, using some of the same language he aims at Mrs. Clinton. In the end, he damaged Ms. Kunin politically, as some Clinton supporters and political analysts think he may do in the current race. \u201cIn a tough fight, Bernie is hardly the     guy that he claims to be,\u201d said Garrison Nelson, a longtime political science professor at the University of Vermont. Ms. Kunin was not the only foe that Mr. Sanders attacked with insinuations, as opposed to the more overtly negative television ads that Mr. Sanders has forsworn. In his 1990 race for Congress, he frequently laid political bait for his Republican opponent and relished watching him stumble. And in his 2006 Senate campaign, Mr. Sanders relentlessly linked his moderate Republican opponent with George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, and accused him of running \u201cthe most negative, dishonest campaign in the history of the state of Vermont. \u201d While such tactics are not unusual in many campaigns, Mr. Sanders has long tried to claim the high road. Yet if his past opponents remember anything about him, it\u2019s Bernie the brawler. \u201cThe way he kept tagging me as a typical rich guy who only cared about rich Republicans  \u2014   it was very tough, and very effective,\u201d said Richard Tarrant, a software executive who was the Republican Senate nominee in 2006 and ran many aggressive television ads. \u201cBernie knew that I earned my money myself, that my wealth was  . But that didn\u2019t matter. \u201d In the current race, after days of needling by the Clinton camp about his policies and ability to answer tough questions, Mr. Sanders hit back this month by saying Mrs. Clinton was \u201cnot qualified\u201d for the presidency because she had taken money from wealthy donors and supported the war in Iraq and some   agreements. Some Sanders supporters expressed dismay that their candidate was resorting to such sharp exchanges  \u2014   a Guardian columnist wrote on Tuesday that she felt \u201cbetrayed\u201d  \u2014   while the leading Republican candidate, Donald J. Trump, picked up the line of attack. \u201cBernie Sanders says that Hillary Clinton is unqualified to be president,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201cBased on her decision making ability, I can go along with that!\u201d Mr. Sanders has started running commercials in New York criticizing Mrs. Clinton for accepting   speaking fees from Wall Street banks but not supporting a federal $15 minimum wage. And in Thursday\u2019s debate, he suggested that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s speaking fees had influenced her to be soft on Wall Street regulation. She quickly dismissed that, saying that she had called out bankers over business practices  \u2014   drawing a sarcastic response from Mr. Sanders. \u201cSecretary Clinton called them out  \u2014   oh my goodness, they must have been really crushed by this,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd was that before or after you received huge sums of money by giving speaking engagements? So they must have been very, very upset by what you did. \u201d While Mr. Sanders has not run   and highly personal ads against Mrs. Clinton  \u2014   the sort that traditionally characterize a negative campaign  \u2014   Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advisers accused Mr. Sanders of breaking his word. \u201cAt times he does it deftly, but make no mistake, every day Senator Sanders is launching another attack, and that\u2019s not how he said he would run his campaign,\u201d said Joel Benenson, Mr. Clinton\u2019s campaign strategist. Mr. Devine, a longtime strategist for Mr. Sanders, said his candidate\u2019s quips and tone were a far cry from the   vitriol in the Republican race. He insisted that Mr. Sanders was seeking to reveal substantive differences with Mrs. Clinton, and denied that his candidate fears the Democratic nomination is slipping away. \u201cI think the race is just increasingly engaged,\u201d Mr. Devine said. In Vermont, however, Mr. Sanders was known for belittling opponents at times, rather than merely challenging their ideas. During one debate in the 1986 governor\u2019s race, Mr. Sanders was asked if he viewed Governor Kunin as \u201cthe lesser of two evils,\u201d given his descriptions of the Democratic and Republican parties as \u201cTweedledum\u201d and \u201cTweedledee,\u201d and if he thought he might contribute to her political \u201cdemise. \u201d Mr. Sanders chuckled and then looked at Ms. Kunin, seated a few feet away. \u201cGovernor, how does it feel to be the lesser of two evils?\u201d he asked. \u201cI think that really is what this campaign is about. \u201d Ms. Kunin was  . Toward the end of that campaign, Ms. Kunin said, Mr. Sanders argued at a rally in Burlington, Vt. that he would do far more for women than Ms. Kunin. \u201cBernie thought I was an empty suit, and insisted that he was the better feminist because he would solve income inequality and that would help women,\u201d Ms. Kunin said in the interview. \u201cHe could be sarcastic, but also very subtle. \u201d A supporter of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s presidential bid, Ms. Kunin said she saw similarities between his treatment of the two women. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to say, \u2018She\u2019s a woman, she\u2019s not qualified,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Kunin, who was   with 47 percent of the vote after Mr. Sanders siphoned off some support. \u201cBut he can paint a very subtle illusion talking about qualifications and judgment. \u201d Mr. Devine, the adviser to Mr. Sanders, said the senator would never make   attacks, in the 1980s or today. \u201cHis focus is on issues,\u201d he said. Peter Smith, the Republican candidate for governor in 1986 and the congressman Mr. Sanders ousted in 1990, said that Mr. Sanders used passion to create \u201ca contrast between him and his opponent that may not, in fact, exist. \u201d Mr. Sanders\u2019s aides in the 1990 campaign said they would regularly taunt Mr. Smith about his positions on issues like the minimum wage, which the congressman would dispute, and then Mr. Sanders would come forward and accuse Mr. Smith of dishonesty. As a result, a running theme of that campaign was that Mr. Sanders had integrity and Mr. Smith lacked it. \u201cThe tool he uses is his intensity and his belief that, on the major issues he cares about, there is only one right answer,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cAnd it is his. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562036.5274408}
