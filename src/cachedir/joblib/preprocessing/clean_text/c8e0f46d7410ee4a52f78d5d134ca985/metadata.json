WADA  \u2014   the global regulator of doping in sports that oversees three dozen testing labs around the world  \u2014   confirmed the suspension Friday, citing the Rio lab\u2019s \u201cnonconformity\u201d with international standards. The lab has a prior disciplinary record and is one of a handful of labs that have had their certification to conduct drug testing revoked in WADA\u2019s   history. Among those is Moscow\u2019s antidoping lab, which was disciplined last fall following accusations of a   doping program in Russia. Those allegations have prompted global sports officials to bar Russian track and field competitors from the Rio Games. At the urging of Olympic officials, 27 other Summer Olympics sports organizations are scrutinizing athletes from Russia and Kenya, another country facing accusations of widespread doping, ahead of the Games. The Rio suspension not only presents new logistical hurdles to testing at the Games but also highlights growing concern over an antidoping system in disarray that extends to how WADA itself operates. WADA has come under scrutiny for taking years to act on   tips about doping in Russia and for approving Russia\u2019s antidoping lab to lead testing at the Sochi Olympics in 2014 even amid questions about that lab\u2019s integrity. On Friday, WADA did not specify the issues with the Rio facility that had prompted the suspension. A person familiar with the lab\u2019s operations, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said the investigation centered on a specific case. The Rio lab was previously suspended in 2013  \u2014   the year before Brazil hosted soccer\u2019s World Cup  \u2014   and was reinstated by WADA last year. To win back its certification, the lab had spent roughly 200 million Brazilian reais ($60 million) to train more than 90 technicians and retrofit three floors of facilities at a federal university in Rio. That project necessitated a substantial commitment of government money in the face of a serious recession. In an interview last spring, Francisco Radler de Aquino Neto, a chemical scientist and the director of the Rio facility, credited firm support from the federal government for improvements. Dilma Rousseff, who was removed as Brazil\u2019s president this year amid a sweeping graft scandal, signed a measure in March to ensure that the lab\u2019s policies were changed to conform with global standards so that its certification to run Olympic testing was not revoked. The new suspension took effect on Wednesday, according to WADA. The lab has the option of filing an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland within 21 days. While under suspension, the lab is barred from conducting any antidoping analysis on urine and blood samples. It was unclear Friday if the issue would be resolved  \u2014   and the suspension lifted  \u2014   in time for the Olympics, though officials expressed skepticism that such a reversal could happen so quickly. In the meantime, WADA said that it would transfer any samples at the lab to a facility outside Brazil for testing. \u201cWADA will work closely with the Rio laboratory to resolve the identified issue,\u201d Olivier Niggli, WADA\u2019s incoming director general, said in the organization\u2019s statement. \u201cAthletes can have confidence that the suspension will only be lifted by WADA when the laboratory is operating optimally. \u201d The lab\u2019s previous suspension coincided with the 2014 World Cup, forcing organizers to send athletes\u2019 doping samples to Switzerland for testing. FIFA, the governing body of international soccer, bore the cost. If the Rio lab is not recertified in time for the Olympics, the International Olympic Committee would be responsible for arranging to have doping samples taken to another   lab. Earlier this month, WADA\u2019s president, Craig Reedie, stressed the necessity of a local testing lab at the Olympics. Compared to the World Cup, he said, the pace of Olympic testing and competition is far more intense. \u201cYou\u2019re in the first round of the 100 meters at 10 o\u2019clock in the morning and the second round at 2 o\u2019clock in the afternoon,\u201d Mr. Reedie said. \u201cWe need a laboratory on site at the Olympic Games. \u201d Just two years ago, facing enormous pressure to have an   laboratory at Sochi, Mr. Reedie permitted the Russian lab to conduct testing for the Games despite suspicious test results that had prompted a WADA investigation. The longtime director of Russia\u2019s lab, Grigory Rodchenkov, told The New York Times that after he was cleared to run the Sochi lab, he had tampered with roughly 100 of the 1, 917 urine samples the facility tested. He said he had substituted out the   urine of dozens of Russian athletes, at least 15 of whom won medals at Sochi  \u2014   where Russia placed first in the overall medal count. Mr. Reedie, who signed a certificate in January 2014 that allowed Dr. Rodchenkov to direct testing at Sochi, has defended that decision. \u201cThe suspension was suspended provided they met certain tests over a short period, which they did,\u201d Mr. Reedie said in an interview in Switzerland this month. \u201cHindsight is an exact science. \u201d In 2014, WADA\u2019s independent observation team called the Sochi lab \u201ca milestone in the evolution of the Olympic Games antidoping program. \u201d But in recent months  \u2014   as attention has focused on the global regulator, and after new rules took effect in 2015  \u2014   WADA has announced an unusual flurry of new disciplinary actions. About a quarter of the lab suspensions published on WADA\u2019s website have taken place in 2016. In the last three months alone, WADA announced more suspensions than it had in the preceding three years combined. Those suspensions  \u2014   of antidoping labs in Beijing Lisbon Madrid Bloemfontein, South Africa and now Rio  \u2014   affect more than 10 percent of WADA\u2019s testing facilities. The agency, which oversees individual countries\u2019 antidoping programs as well, has also disciplined national antidoping agencies at significantly higher rates since last fall. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a whole lot more scrutiny now,\u201d said Joseph de Pencier, the founding chief executive of the Institute of National   Organizations, a trade group that has been funded by WADA. \u201cWADA is realizing it should function like a financial regulator. \u201d At a November meeting in Colorado  \u2014   days after WADA had published an explosive report on Russia  \u2014   WADA\u2019s board resolved to be stricter, and Mr. Reedie said in a statement that the organization would have a \u201cgreater focus\u201d on ensuring countries played by the rules. Since then, the antidoping agencies of countries including Kenya and Russia have been sanctioned, either because the countries\u2019 policies were out of line with global standards or because the agencies made technical mistakes such as sending doping samples to an unapproved lab. For a national antidoping agency to be disciplined by WADA means little in itself, but depriving a country of WADA\u2019s endorsement is a powerful signal. Still, in an interview in Los Angeles last month, Dr. Rodchenkov minimized the rigor of WADA\u2019s scientific vetting process during the 10 years he headed Russia\u2019s lab. \u201cWADA is a kindergarten,\u201d Dr. Rodchenkov said. But he called WADA\u2019s seal of approval crucial to delivering on the cheating scheme he said he had carried out on orders from the Russian government. \u201cYou cannot do   doping without access to   accredited laboratory,\u201d he said. Though WADA revoked the accreditation of Russia\u2019s lab in the wake of the accusations, the agency cleared the facility last month to resume testing on blood samples. Mr. de Pencier, the head of the consortium of antidoping agencies, said the antidoping authorities had begun to appreciate the need for more robust regulation. \u201cThe antidoping community as a whole is still a work in progress,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re still developing. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562625.69742}
