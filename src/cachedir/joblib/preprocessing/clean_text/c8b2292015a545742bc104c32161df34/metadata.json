But the reality is I have serious concerns about equivocating sentences when national security\u2019s at stake. What happened here is that, literally hundreds of thousands of documents were released. It put national security at risk. It put individual operatives at risk. It put our national interests at risk with other countries. And at a time that we are seriously questioning what Russia did, as it relates to our recent elections, and the role that WikiLeaks  \u2026    has played in that regard, I\u2019m not sure what type of message we send here. And, so, I\u2019m really surprised that the president took this action and I have concerns about what message we send about ultimately revealing sensitive national security documents. \u201d He further wondered, \u201c[W]hat message do we send for the next person who thinks that they can get a treasure trove of documents released because something inspires them to do so and the consequences that flow from that?\u201d And \u201cif at the end of the day, you think you can do that, and then have your sentence commuted, I\u2019m not sure that we send the right message. \u201d Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742561770.9915621}
