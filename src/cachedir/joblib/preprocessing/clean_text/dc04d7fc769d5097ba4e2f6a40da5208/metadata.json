It became known in 2008 that the kingdom had given them between $10 million and $25 million. \\n\u201cSo those terrorist entities, which have been labeled as the enemies of the United States, have been appearing as Clinton Foundation donors,\u201d Bennett said. \\n\u201cThat is a serious crime, it is treason, it is corruption, it is bribery of officials,\u201d said the analyst. \\nBennett argued that all the leaks and investigations concerning the Clinton family were coming from \u201cthose personnel in the American government who have had enough.\u201d \\n\u201cThey have stepped up, they have released emails, they have hacked into their own computers and in some cases they have provided it to WikiLeaks,\u201d he added. \\nWhistle-blowing website WikiLeaks has released thousands of Hillary\u2019s campaign chairman and top aide John Podesta\u2019s emails since last month, exposing some of the well-kept secrets surrounding the Clinton family and Hillary Clinton\u2019s bid for the White House. \\nBennett predicted that the case would \u201cmost probably\u201d lead to indictments and some people would be arrested as early as this weekend.
