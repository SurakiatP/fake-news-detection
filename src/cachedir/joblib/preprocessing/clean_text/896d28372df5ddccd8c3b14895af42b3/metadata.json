[As Breitbart News reported:   James O\u2019Keefe and Project Veritas released a new undercover video on Tuesday showing   activists with the \u201cDisruptJ20\u201d effort plotting to stop Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration by chaining D. C. Metro trains and blocking roads. The video adds a layer of deep detail to a story by Ryan Lovelace in the Washington Examiner earlier this month, \u201cHow protesters plan to wreck Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration,\u201d which first reported the efforts of \u201c#DisruptJ20. \u201d One activist leader is captured on the Project Veritas video saying: \u201cSo simultaneous to the checkpoint blockades in the morning, we are also doing a series of clusterfuck blockades, where we are going to try to blockade all the major ingress points into the city. \u201d As far as others on the Left disavowing the alleged plan, said O\u2019Keefe, \u201cWe embedded this video compilation of the best terrorism bits, and we tagged Michael Moore,\u201d along with Van Jones, George Soros\u2019 deputies, Mark Ruffalo, and others. There was no indication that any of them disavowed any of it. The panel went on to discuss the media\u2019s refusal to hold the Left accountable by calling on them to denounce these groups, as they are quick to do with the Right.
