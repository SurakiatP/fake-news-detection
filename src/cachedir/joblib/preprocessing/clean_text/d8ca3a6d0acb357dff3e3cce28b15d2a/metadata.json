Returning hours later, Ms. Abdel Aziz, a psychiatrist who counsels torture victims, passed the same people still waiting listlessly  \u2014   a young woman and an elderly man, a mother holding her baby. The building remained closed. When she got home, she immediately started writing about the people in line and didn\u2019t stop for 11 hours. The story became her surreal debut novel, \u201cThe Queue,\u201d which takes place after a failed revolution in an unnamed Middle Eastern city. The narrative unfolds over 140 days, as civilians are forced to wait in an endless line to petition a shadowy authority called The Gate for basic services. \u201cFiction gave me a very wide space to say what I wanted to say about totalitarian authority,\u201d Ms. Abdel Aziz said in a recent interview. \u201cThe Queue,\u201d which was just published in English by Melville House, has drawn comparisons to Western classics like George Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984\u201d and \u201cThe Trial\u201d by Franz Kafka. It represents a new wave of dystopian and surrealist fiction from Middle Eastern writers who are grappling with the chaotic aftermath and stinging disappointments of the Arab Spring. Five years after the popular uprisings in Egypt, Tunisia, Libya and elsewhere, a bleak, apocalyptic strain of   literature has taken root in the region. Some writers are using science fiction and fantasy tropes to describe grim current political realities. Others are writing about controversial subjects like sexuality and atheism, or exhuming painful historical episodes that were previously off limits. In a literary culture where poetry has long been the most celebrated medium, writers are experimenting with a range of genres and styles, including comics and graphic novels, hallucinatory horror novels and allegorical works of science fiction. \u201cThere\u2019s a shift away from realism, which has dominated Arabic literature,\u201d said the   novelist Saleem Haddad, whose new book, \u201cGuapa,\u201d is narrated by a young gay Arab man whose friend has been imprisoned after a political revolt. \u201cWhat\u2019s coming to the surface now is darker and a bit deeper. \u201d Science fiction and surrealism have long provided an escape valve for writers living under oppressive regimes. In Latin America, decades of fascism and civil war helped inspire masterpieces of magical realism from authors like Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez and Isabel Allende. In Russia, the postmodern novelist Vladimir Sorokin has published disturbing and controversial futuristic novels that surreptitiously skewer the country\u2019s repressive government. Dystopian themes are not entirely new in Arabic fiction. But they have become much more prominent in recent years, publishers and translators say. The genre has proliferated in part because it captures the sense of despair that many writers say they feel in the face of cyclical violence and repression. At the same time, futuristic settings may give writers some measure of cover to explore charged political ideas without being labeled dissidents. \u201cThese futuristic stories are all about lost utopia,\u201d said Layla     of a collection of   Spring writing titled \u201cDiaries of an Unfinished Revolution. \u201d \u201cPeople really could imagine a better future, and now it\u2019s almost worse than it was before. \u201d In the turbulent months after the uprisings, when the promises of democracy and greater social freedom remained elusive, some novelists channeled their frustrations and fears into grim apocalyptic tales. In Mohammed Rabie\u2019s gritty novel \u201cOtared,\u201d which will be published in English this year by the American University in Cairo, a former Egyptian police officer joins a fight against a mysterious occupying power that rules the country in 2025. Mr. Rabie said he wrote the novel in response to the \u201csuccessive defeats\u201d that advocates of democracy faced after the 2011 demonstrations that ended President Hosni Mubarak\u2019s   rule. While there are parallels to   Egyptian society, setting the story in the near future allowed him to write more freely, without drawing explicit connections to Egypt\u2019s current ruler, he said in an email interview translated by his Arabic publisher. Nael Eltoukhy, whose darkly satirical 2013 novel, \u201cWomen of Karantina,\u201d takes place partly in a   Alexandria in the year 2064, said he felt that a futuristic farce was the best way to reflect the jaded mood in Egypt. \u201cIn Egypt, especially after the revolution, everything is terrible, but everything is also funny,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cNow, I think it\u2019s worse than the time of Mubarak. \u201d Gloomy futuristic stories have proved popular with readers, and several of these novels have been critical and commercial hits. \u201cOtared\u201d was a finalist for this year\u2019s prestigious International Prize for Arabic Fiction. Publishers say the books have caught on with the public in part because they distill a collective feeling of frustration. This new body of   literature shows a sharp tonal shift from the ecstatic outpouring that arrived immediately after the Arab Spring, when many writers published breathless memoirs or dug out old manuscripts they had stashed away for years. Celebrated Egyptian novelists like Ahdaf Soueif and Mona Prince wrote firsthand nonfiction accounts of the 2011 protests in Tahrir Square. The Syrian novelist Samar Yazbek published diaries she kept during the Syrian uprising. A new generation of writers drew inspiration from the stunning scenes of citizens rising up together against entrenched dictatorships. \u201cThere was something about the experience of the revolution where suddenly you had a voice, and your voice had weight and it had meaning,\u201d said Yasmine El Rashidi, an Egyptian journalist whose first novel, \u201cChronicle of a Last Summer,\u201d about a young woman\u2019s political awakening in Cairo during and after Mr. Mubarak\u2019s rule, will be published in the United States next month. In the years since the revolution, that optimism has withered, and the authorities have cracked down on creative expression across the region. In Saudi Arabia, the poet Ashraf Fayadh was sentenced to death last year for his verses, which religious authorities called blasphemous. After an international outcry, his sentence was reduced to eight years in prison and 800 lashes. In Egypt, under the strict rule of President Abdel Fattah   the government has shut art galleries, raided publishing houses and confiscated copies of books it views as controversial. Last year, customs officers seized 400 copies of \u201cWalls of Freedom,\u201d about Egyptian political street art, and charged that the book was \u201cinstigating revolt. \u201d \u201cWe are concerned now with what we publish,\u201d said   Rizk, director of Dar   Egypt, an Arabic publishing house. \u201cIf something is banned, it does create commercial problems. \u201d Despite explicit protections for free speech in Egypt\u2019s 2014 Constitution, the authorities have targeted individual writers and artists. The novelist Ahmed Naji is serving a   prison sentence for violating \u201cpublic modesty\u201d with sexually explicit passages in his experimental novel \u201cThe Use of Life. \u201d Many fear that his imprisonment will lead to more  . \u201cThe Arab Spring and the revolution broke people\u2019s fears and gave them the initiative to express themselves,\u201d said Ms. Abdel Aziz, whose novel, \u201cThe Queue,\u201d was published in Arabic in 2013. \u201cNow we are back to oppression. \u201d Ms. Abdel Aziz, 39, earned a master\u2019s degree in neuropsychiatry in 2005 and now works part time at a center in Cairo that counsels victims of torture and violence. She has published two   collections and several nonfiction books on sensitive subjects like torture and the human rights violations committed by Egyptian security forces. But after Mr. Mubarak\u2019s fall, writing a factual account felt like an inadequate way to capture the surreal experience of ordinary Egyptians who lived through the uprisings and subsequent crackdowns, she said. Instead, she aimed to write a universal story that reflected what was unfolding around her but transcended geography and current events. She started writing \u201cThe Queue\u201d in September 2012. The novel follows a young salesman, Yehya, who was shot during a failed uprising. Yehya is denied medical treatment and forced to wait in an endless line to petition The Gate for a permit to have surgery. As he grows weaker, the line only gets longer, stretching on for miles. Ms. Abdel Aziz uses coded language for loaded political terms and events throughout the novel, which was translated by Elisabeth Jaquette. The 2011 uprising against Mr. Mubarak is called \u201cthe First Storm. \u201d A later civilian revolt that ended in bloodshed is referred to as \u201cthe Disgraceful Events. \u201d Ms. Abdel Aziz worries about the growing scrutiny Egyptian writers and activists face. About a dozen of her friends are in prison, she said. She has been arrested three times for taking part in demonstrations and protests. But she feels that living in fear is futile. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cI will not stop writing. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561773.1643414}
