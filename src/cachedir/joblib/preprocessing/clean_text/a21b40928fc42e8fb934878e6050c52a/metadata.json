Time to be an adult. You\u2019re president. \u201d  According to Conway, it was Trump\u2019s policies that made it possible for Trump to be president. Conway said, \u201cIt\u2019s really disappointing to hear the vice president speak that way, not surprising. To what is he referring, the fact that his Democratic party under his watch, he\u2019s been the number two guy in the country and in the Democratic Party, they lost over 1, 000 state legislative seats, they lost over a dozen governorships, a dozen senators, they lost 68 House seats since he got there.  They lost the election in 2010, 2014, 2016. In large part because of the policies he supports like the awful unaffordable, inaccessible care act, Obamacare. \u201d \u201cLike these draconian taxes and regulations on small businesses and the rest of us, like all these bad trade deals that never benefited American workers,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd Donald Trump who came in  \u2014   without Joe Biden and Barack Obama, there may have never been a president Trump and a Vice President Mike Pence. So I\u2019d like to say to the vice president, thanks for the  . We\u2019ll ignore the insults and the slights. We very much appreciate all the failed policies that allowed us to usher in a new era of hopefulness and buoyancy, fresh blood and excitement in this administration. You\u2019re now going to see president Donald Trump, very quickly, deliver and perform and be accountable to results like as he has always done in his wildly successful business. It\u2019s gong to be a brand new, not just the tone but the content, in Washington. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563327.984957}
