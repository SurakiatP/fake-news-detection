[Surprisingly, the document takes aim at \u201cpolitical elites\u201d for fostering a doctrine of multiculturalism and silence, which can help and facilitate the nefarious ends of   organisation like the Brotherhood.  Somewhat predictably, however, the publication of such claims in Sweden  \u2014   where open criticism of liberal, multicultural ideals is rare  \u2014   has caused a row, with critics labelling the report \u201cconspiratorial\u201d and claiming it misrepresents Islam. Published Friday, the document was commissioned by Sweden\u2019s Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB) part of the country\u2019s Ministry of Defence, which is responsible for civil protection and public safety. The paper\u2019s authors claim the Brotherhood is working to increase the number of practicing Muslims in Sweden, encouraging tension with Secular society, and targeting political parties, NGOs, academic institutions and other civil society organisations. They also slam the \u201cestablished structure of values among the country\u2019s political elite [which] places a high value on \u2018acceptance\u2019 and \u2018tolerance\u2019 of citizens who are in some sense different from the mainstream\u201d. In the report, the Islamism of the MB is described as a totalitarian political ideology born out of Islam, a religion. This can make it \u201cdifficult to oppose what on the surface appears to be (a vulnerable minority) religious rights\u201d it explains. Critics, therefore, \u201crun the risk of being called \u2018racist\u2019 or \u2018Islamophobic\u2019 and because of the situation in Swedish society such classifications endanger people\u2019s careers\u201d. The press was quick to label these claims inflammatory, and 22 academics and \u201cexperts\u201d in religion have published a blog post questioning the methodology of the research. The academics  \u2014   from many of Sweden\u2019s leading universities  \u2014   say it is \u201calmost conspiratorial\u201d to suggest criticism of Islamism is difficult in Sweden. They also insist the claim that the Brotherhood is building a parallel society is refuted in past research. In response to the blog post, the department has refuted the criticism of their methodology, and the report\u2019s editor, Magnus Norell, told public service broadcaster SVT: \u201cHad they smoked something before they read it? You just need to read the report. If someone doesn\u2019t accept this, there\u2019s not much I can do about it. It\u2019s proven. \u201d Controversially in Sweden, the report also links Islamism and poor social integration to immigration. \u201cIslamists aim to build a parallel social structure competing with the rest of the Swedish society the values of its citizens. In this sense, MB\u2019s activists pose a   challenge in terms of the country\u2019s social cohesion\u201d it states. Adding: \u201cMigration from Africa and the Middle East is likely to continue in coming years, both in form of relatives and refugees  \u2026     \u201cGiven that MB\u2019s goal is to increase the number of practising Muslims in Swedish or European territory, there is a great likelihood that a \u2018tug of war\u2019 will occur between the majority community and the Islamic community with the MB\u2019s encouragement  \u2026    \u201d The authors of the blog post objected to this claim. \u201cThe [report\u2019s] authors seem to conclude that Swedish Islam is a homogeneous phenomenon and that Swedish Muslims are led by the Muslim Brotherhood  \u2026    \u201d they write. \u201cIt is a conclusion that goes against the overall research, which rather points towards the Muslim community being diverse and there being competition between Muslim groups  \u2026    \u201d Founded in 1826, the MB aims to create a global, Sunni Islamic Caliphate by organising Muslims politically. It is arguably the largest Islamist organisation in the world and has links to the Muslim Council of Britain and many other mainstream European Islamic institution. The group has been accused of fostering links to militants and is considered a terrorist organisation by the governments of Bahrain, Egypt, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.'"}, "time": 1742564622.0847871}
