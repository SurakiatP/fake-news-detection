Members of the Stutsman County SWAT watch protesters demonstrating against the Dakota Access Pipeline near the Stand Rock Sioux Reservation, as they stand next to a police barricade on Highway 1806 in Cannon Ball, N.D., Sunday, Oct. 30, 2016. \\nStanding Rock, North Dakota \u2014 Widespread outrage over both the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline and violent police crackdowns rages on. That outrage is spreading even to police agencies now returning from deployment to the reservation. Two departments have already refused to return, citing personal and public objections. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, an army of sympathizers is re-purposing social media to combat police efforts in Standing Rock. \\nMinnesota\u2019s Hennepin County Sheriff\u2019s Department is among that group. Lawmakers, according to MPR News , found police activities in Standing Rock \u201cinappropriate\u201d. It\u2019s to the point where they\u2019re considering rewriting legislation to avoid future deployments to incidents like the pipeline resistance. \\nPolice officials, of course, declined to comment on their return from North Dakota or their feelings on what\u2019s happening there. It\u2019s also made the task of rebuilding trust with the community an even loftier uphill battle. \u201cI do not support Sheriff Stanek\u2019s decision to send his deputies to North Dakota\u201d, says LT. Governor Tina Smith, \u201cnor did we approve his decision to begin with. I do not have any control over the Sheriff\u2019s actions, which I think were wrong, and I believe he should bring his deputies home if he hasn\u2019t already.\u201d \\nSmith\u2019s comments split the state\u2019s government, however, and she was targeted. Minnesota State Rep. Tony Cornish condemned Smith for prioritizing \u201cthe rights of protesters over the needs of law enforcement\u201d, saying she should apologize to the cops. \\nSheriffs from Wisconsin\u2019s Dane County were more empathetic, pulling out and refusing to return. According to the Bismarck Tribune , Sheriff Dave Mahoney made the decision after a \u201cwide cross-section of the community\u201d decried the deployment. \u201cAll share the opinion that our deputies should not be involved in this situation\u201d, says Mahoney. Dane County\u2019s deputies were deployed to Standing Rock for around a week. Sources report Dane County wasn\u2019t involved in recent arrests, a string of which scooped up an alderwoman from Madison Wisconsin. \\nAld. Rebecca Kemble traveled to North Dakota as a \u201clegal observer\u201d, filming and participating in prayer ceremonies. When Morton County officers\u2013if they cans till be called that\u2013grabbed and arrested her for engaging in a riot. According to Kemble, no riot was happening. Other Wisconsin departments have been recalled, with at least one staying behind for a more couple weeks. \\nMany other citizens have been charged for trespassing and participating in non-existent riots, including journalists. One of the most renowned reporters who\u2019s faced DAPL (Dakota Access Pipeline)- related charges was Amy Goodman of Democracy Now . Goodman\u2019s team filmed dog attacks by DAPL contractors who lacked proper K9 licenses. The contractors have also been accused of unethical surveillance, intimidation, and sabotaging the movement by attempting to make authorities believe the protesters have finally turned violent. \\nOther journalists, including documentarian Deia Schlosberg, face decades in prison for filming climate activists at a separate oil project. Journalists from the independent outlet Unicorn Riot, who recently reported use of a sound cannon on water protectors, have also been arrested. \\nThousands of opponents to the pipeline have flooded Standing Rock to repel construction and police brutality. More still have taken to the internet, spreading information in the form of writing, video, photography, and art. Among the renegade tactics is using Facebook to \u201ccheck-in\u201d at Standing Rock. According the Guardian , over a million people\u2013even people I know\u2013have joined the action. \\nIt began with a Facebook post, disclosing that Morton County sheriffs are allegedly using Facebook check-ins to track protesters. \u201cChecking in\u201d\u2013whether you\u2019re at a friend\u2019s, restaurant, or escalating resistance\u2013pinpoints your location to a tee. Once you check in, a notification is sent out to, yes, your friends, but theoretically anyone who\u2019s capable of watching. It\u2019s yet another tool in the bag of tricks authorities have deployed against civilians, and are likely utilizing in Standing Rock. \\nSome detractors have dismissed the social media action as a waste of time. An editor at The Fifth Column challenged these in a Facebook post, narrating a debate on the subject he\u2019d had. Editor Justin King pointed out that even if the check-in\u2019s wasted two minutes of time, multiplied by hundreds of thousands, that equates to two months of wasted police work. Now imagine how ineffective the surveillance may be with millions continuously checking. \\nMorton County Sheriff\u2019s, Guardian reports, called claims of police surveillance misguided \u201crumors\u201d. Morton County, by their own account, isn\u2019t \u201cmonitoring Facebook check-ins for the protest camp or any location for that matter.\u201d Before you trust them, consider that Facebook access for water protectors was reported as \u201cblocked\u2019 during a military-style raid on a camp. \\nData Collection Nationwide \\nOther police departments are similarly sketchy when pressured to speak on their surveillance technologies. Wisconsin\u2019s Milwaukee PD hid the use of cell site simulators , or Stingrays, from courts for months. Stingrays mimic cellphone towers, thus tricking phones into providing all manner of user information and data \\nNearby, the Wauwatosa Police Department , despite having admitting to \u201ccollecting and analyzing cell phone data\u201d in its public reports, denied ever even coming close to a Stingray. It took the department 5 weeks to respond to that open records request, which is considered unusually long. It remains unknown how Wauwatosa PD, which has been blasted for lack of transparency before , collects cell phone data. \\nThe Hand\u2019s Fingers In Open Rebellion \\nIn addition to the general retreat of departments, two officers have already turned in their badges in support of the protesters. North Dakota water protector Redhawk, MintPress reports , disclosed the revelation. The individual also pointed out \u201cyou can see it in some of them, that they do not support the police actions.\u201d \u201cSome are waking up\u201d, they continued, \u201cwe must keep reminding them that they are welcome to put down their weapons and badge and take a stand against the pipeline as well.\u201d Hints of shame could be seen in the faces of officers who confronted protesters as they blocked them from prayer grounds. As the protesters condemned officers , some of whom looked down or off to the horizon in shame. \\nThe modern era of internet and technology gifts us with a plethora of ways to express ourselves, and help one another. Standing Rock is quickly becoming a stand out of that fact. Citizens, journalists, and activists are all using the internet to achieve their own goals. Whether that be spreading information being blocked, tracking police movements, sending food and rations or just voicing opinions. Standing Rock\u2019s resistance is spreading globally, with protests occurring in Europe and elsewhere. As long as construction doesn\u2019t stop, the movement won\u2019t rest.'"}, "time": 1742561780.8367689}
