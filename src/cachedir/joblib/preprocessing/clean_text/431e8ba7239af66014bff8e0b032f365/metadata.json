But right about the time Ms. Sabo came aboard, the chief executive had accepted a new position elsewhere. The replacement in the top slot: a   . \u201cThe way he operated was classic for that age group: I would get texts and emails any time day and night,\u201d recalled Ms. Sabo, now 59. \u201cIf I said I had 30 years in the profession, he hated that. He would say: \u2018I don\u2019t want to hear how long you\u2019ve been in the field. I don\u2019t care how long you\u2019ve done this or that. \u2019\u201d The new boss seemed to be sending the message that the way Ms. Sabo approached   and development was out of date. \u201cAt the end of the day, it felt like, \u2018You need to come into the new millennium,\u2019\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cI used to chuckle and wonder what kind of relationship he had with his mother. \u201d Despite her growing discomfort, she tried to do her job and avoid conversation or confrontation with the boss  \u2014   who first demoted her, then fired her. \u201cHe told me that I wasn\u2019t hitting my goals, but that\u2019s not true,\u201d said Ms. Sabo, who has a new job and an older boss. \u201cI think it was that we butted heads. Some of it was style, but some of it was generational. \u201d Companies these days are looking to fill the management ranks with people who are \u201cdigital natives,\u201d which frequently translates to millennials and Gen  . Meanwhile, more baby boomers are staying on the job longer, and some retirees, looking for a second act, are rejoining the ranks of the employed, at least part time. Consequently, the odds are increasing that older workers will be answering to managers young enough to be their children. A 2014 Harris Interactive survey on behalf of CareerBuilder, a job recruitment website, found that 38 percent of American workers had a younger boss, up from 34 percent in 2012. \u201cObviously, there have always been younger people in the work force, but in the past, younger workers were on the lower floors and older workers were executives on the upper floors and in the executive dining room,\u201d said Jill Chapman, a senior performance consultant with Insperity, a personnel management firm. But because younger workers now have the advantage in sheer numbers, \u201cthere are more opportunities for them to move into management roles,\u201d Ms. Chapman continued. \u201cThey\u2019re in their 30s, and they\u2019ve had lots of experience because of internships we older workers gave them when they were in high school and college. They had those experiences, and they had the chops for exec positions at an earlier age. \u201d If older workers have difficulty adjusting, there\u2019s a good reason: It goes against the natural order that the subordinate would have several decades on the supervisor. \u201cResearch shows that older workers are not as responsive to that younger boss, because they feel he or she shouldn\u2019t be in that position,\u201d said Orlando Richard, an associate professor of management at the University of Texas at Dallas, who recently completed a study on status incongruence. There are implications for the organization, too. \u201cThe older workers with younger bosses are less committed to the company,\u201d Professor Richard said. \u201cThey\u2019re not as engaged in the job. If they\u2019re close to retirement, they may not leave, but they may not work as hard. \u201d Of course, there are plenty of older workers who continue to give the job their all, even though they now report to someone who thinks of Nirvana as an oldies band. The way they see it, though, that younger boss sure doesn\u2019t make it easy. Faye Keller, a public affairs specialist in the health care field in Salt Lake City, was 60 when she got a boss who was half her age. \u201cAt the beginning, I wasn\u2019t too concerned  \u2014   I was ready to look for his strengths,\u201d Ms. Keller said But then she started being excluded from certain meetings. At those meetings she did attend, \u201cI\u2019d say something, and my boss would respond \u2018yeah, \u2019 and move on to another topic. \u201d Colleagues closer to her boss\u2019s age were invited to hang out in his office. \u201cI felt ostracized,\u201d said Ms. Keller, who is now 64. She also felt micromanaged. \u201cI would go out of the building to meet with prospective clients, and when I explained that I was trying to develop relationships, he would tell me I could do it over the phone and through email,\u201d Ms. Keller said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019m old school in my ideas, but I think face to face is essential in building successful relationships, and he didn\u2019t value that. \u201d The boss stayed she went. There are challenges on both sides of the   workplace divide. Older workers may feel they\u2019ve lost their shot at running the show, and younger workers may feel their older subordinates just can\u2019t wait for them to mess up, said David Stillman, an author of the new book \u201cGen Z @ Work. \u201d The  : his son, Jonah, 17, perhaps a future younger boss. Further, older workers, accustomed to the parental role, may reflexively offer advice to younger bosses who chafe at the effrontery. \u201cThey\u2019ll say, \u2018In my day   \u2026    \u2019 implying \u2018your day is wrong,\u2019\u201d Mr. Stillman said. For their part, some younger bosses act as though the world began only when they arrived on the scene, \u201cwhich makes older workers feel that their own considerable experience doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Mr. Stillman added. Older workers may be made to feel that they\u2019re dinosaurs. Younger bosses may think that, yeah, the older worker is kind of a dinosaur. \u201cMy social media skills and computer skills weren\u2019t up to par,\u201d Ms. Keller said. \u201cI\u2019m willing to admit that. \u201d Some companies are making efforts to address the issue. ATT, for example, offers supervisors a   course, \u201cManaging the   Workforce,\u201d which \u201chelps prepare them to effectively communicate with and motivate their direct reports,\u201d said Jan Rasmussen, a company spokeswoman. And not every older worker feels marginalized or unappreciated, nor does every younger boss feel disdainful and misunderstood. \u201cI don\u2019t look at age  \u2014   I look at business intelligence,\u201d said Valentino Lanoce, 54, the regional director of operations for the restaurant chain Verts Mediterranean Grill, who reports to the company\u2019s founders, Dominik Stein, 29, and Michael Heyne, 32. \u201cDominik and Michael respect my experience in the industry, and they\u2019ll ask for my opinion and advice. It\u2019s very collaborative. \u201d Mr. Lanoce said that his interview with Mr. Stein and Mr. Heyne \u201cwas like sitting with mature officers of a company. \u201d He said: \u201cThey\u2019re disciplined and professional. Otherwise, I never would have left where I was to come and work with them. \u201d When talking about her tour of duty at O\u2019Connell  Goldberg, a public relations firm in Hollywood, Fla. Karen Dennis, 60, likes to invoke \u201cThe Intern,\u201d the 2015 comedy that starred Robert De Niro as an unpaid septuagenarian assistant to a much younger chief executive. Ms. Dennis, a former administrative social worker and marketing consultant, had always wanted to work for a P. R. agency  \u2014   badly enough to work without pay. Nine years ago, through a connection, she got her chance at O\u2019Connell  Goldberg. \u201cSocial media was starting to emerge, and I was so lacking in skills,\u201d Ms. Dennis said. She clearly learned quickly. After nine months, she was offered a paid position her boss, Barbara Goldberg, a founder of the company, was 10 years her junior. \u201cThere\u2019s a great work ethic with older workers,\u201d Ms. Goldberg said. \u201cThey come on time, and they stay, and they\u2019re  . They also avoid petty drama, because this isn\u2019t their first time at the rodeo. \u201d Ms. Goldberg said that Ms. Dennis filled an important role: \u201cKaren was so nurturing and motherly to the younger employees  \u2014   she had the time and patience, and I didn\u2019t. \u201d But there were some tensions. \u201cAs a    I tended to step back and assess a situation,\u201d Ms. Dennis said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re that age, you don\u2019t see jumping in as being to your best advantage, because you haven\u2019t yet seen the whole picture. \u201d Her boss\u2019s philosophy, on the other hand, was \u201cjump in. \u201d Ms. Dennis remembers being part of a conference call with a new client. She was silent throughout the conversation, and afterward, was yanked into Ms. Goldberg\u2019s office. \u201cBarbara told me, \u2018I need to hear from you,\u2019\u201d Ms. Dennis said. \u201cAnd I responded, \u2018I didn\u2019t have anything to say.\u2019 I wanted to understand the dynamics of the other team before I spoke. I promised that on the next call, I would be more forceful and part of the conversation  \u2014   and I was. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a dance you do,\u201d added Ms. Dennis, who was with the firm for more than six years before leaving to freelance she remains close to Ms. Goldberg. \u201cIt\u2019s like marriage,\u201d Ms. Dennis said. \u201cMy boss would say, \u2018This is what I want,\u2019 and I would say, \u2018This is what I can do. \u2019\u201d As in many new relationships, there\u2019s a struggle to find a way. Diversity issues have long been a part of the terrain, and \u201cthere are all these hangups at first,\u201d said Ms. Chapman of Insperity. It was a similar dynamic, she said, when women were coming into the work force. \u201cIt\u2019s something we have to work through, and we have to figure out how to make it work,\u201d Ms. Chapman said.'"}, "time": 1742564496.5314095}
