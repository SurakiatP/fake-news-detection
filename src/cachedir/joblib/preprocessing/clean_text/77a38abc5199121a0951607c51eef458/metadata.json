This time Guccifer 2.0 asserts that he has info from inside the FEC\u2019s systems that the Democrats may rig the election.\\n\\nAfter weeks of silence from Guccifer 2.0 with his last post about Trump\u2019s taxes and the Clinton campaigns possible provocation on, October, 18th. Guccifer has ended his silence emerging from the shadows to claim that he is inside the FEC systems and is going to monitor the U.S. elections . That\u2019s not all Guccifer 2.0 is urging fellow hackers to not hack the election to steal the vote but to hack to watch for suspicious activity and voting anomalies within the FEC\u2019s systems.\\nGuccifer 2.0 writes, \u201cI\u2019d like to warn you that the Democrats may rig the elections on November 8. This may be possible because of the software installed in the FEC networks by the large IT companies.\u201dHe adds, \u201c As I\u2019ve already said, their software is of poor quality, with many holes and vulnerabilities. \u201d\\nGuccifer 2.0 is referring to the speech he gave about the weakness of cyber security and how hackers aren\u2019t to blame it\u2019s the IT security to blame for breached systems.\\nGuccifer 2.0 then goes on to say \u201cI have registered in the FEC electronic system as an independent election observer; so I will monitor that the elections are held honestly.\u201d He ends his post calling for other hackers to join him, and monitor the elections from inside and inform the U.S. society about the facts of electoral fraud.\u201d\\nWith an unprecedented amount of election fraud during the primary all in favor of Hillary Clinton against Bernie Sanders and Project Veritas videos exposing various methods of election fraud including busing in minority voters and intimidating voters with violence . As well as cases of election fraud already starting to emerge across the U.S . in various states. Guccifer 2.0 is probably right that Democrats are trying to rig the election but at this point it would have to be so blatantly obvious that they would need to answer to not one case but two cases of election fraud in one election cycle.\\nA recent video by Bev Harris of BlackBoxVoting provided a real-time demo of how the GEMS vote-fraud system, \u201cfraction magic,\u201d worked. There is more detail available on Bev Harris\u2019s BlackBoxVoting website .\\nI will be doing my own election monitoring of early voting and compiling a list of all the fraud that may potentially take place on November 8th like I did for the primary if they are going to rig the election we will make it known. Guccifer 2.0\u2019s full statement is below.\\nGUCCIFER 2.0\u2019s Statement: \\nINFO FROM INSIDE THE FEC: THE DEMOCRATS MAY RIG THE ELECTIONS \\n \\nI\u2019d like to warn you that the Democrats may rig the elections on November 8.
