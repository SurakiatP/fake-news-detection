On Wednesday\u2019s broadcast of the Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cHannity,\u201d author Ann Coulter weighed in on the cancellation of her speech at   and President Trump\u2019s dropping of his demand for border wall funding by stating, \u201cI think the GOP should change their motto to \u2018Next Time.\u2019 We\u2019ll fight this next time. \u201d  Coulter said, \u201cI think the GOP should change their motto to \u2018Next Time.\u2019 We\u2019ll fight this next time. We\u2019ll show them how good we are this time. No, we want to win now. Whether it comes to judges, Ruth Bader Ginsburg gets  \u2014   you may Google it  \u2014   about 98 votes from the Republicans, and Clarence Thomas, 52. Gorsuch barely slips through. You have Donald Trump with,  \u2014   he gives away DACA, and then he doesn\u2019t get the wall. Well, that\u2019ll show \u2019em how good he is. What a good humanitarian, by saying what a big heart he has for those DREAMers, the illegal aliens he promised to deport. Next time we\u2019ll get them. And now we have YAF saying, well, we\u2019re going to strike a blow for the next speaker at Berkeley. No, I want to win now. Can Republicans ever win now?\u201d She later added, \u201c[A]ll of the people who should have been standing up for the First Amendment here all ran away with their tails between their legs. \u201d Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742562281.1973364}
