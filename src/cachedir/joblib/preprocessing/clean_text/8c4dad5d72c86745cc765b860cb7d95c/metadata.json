[\u201cThursday night, Yiannopoulos had a friendly interview on Fox News\u2019s \u2018Tucker Carlson Tonight\u2019  \u2014   a show that, according to the Washington Post, has ridden anger at   activism into    prime time ratings,\u201d wrote Reich on Saturday. \u201cYiannopoulos wasn\u2019t asked about the content of the speech that was shut down. The conversation focused instead on how Berkeley proved the point that the Left was ceding its right to federal grants by cracking down on free speech. Which raises the possibility that Yiannopoulos and Brietbart were in cahoots with the agitators, in order to lay the groundwork for a Trump crackdown on universities and their federal funding. \u201d  After repeatedly misspelling \u201cBreitbart,\u201d Reich then asked his readers to \u201cconnect these dots,\u201d in typical conspiracy theory form, before adding \u201cI don\u2019t want to add to the conspiratorial musings of so many about this very conspiratorial administration, but it strikes me there may be something worrying going on here. \u201d Reich, who works directly for the college administration at Berkeley, has repeatedly floated this conspiracy theory since the riot last week. He first suggested it in a CNN segment with host Don Lemon. In addition to not shutting down Reich when he made his baseless allegation, CNN\u2019s Lemon egged him on from the start, opening his segment by saying that the violence at Berkeley \u201cplayed right into the hands of the   white supremacist   \u2026     someone like Milo Yiannopoulos. \u201d Then, instead of challenging Reich\u2019s allegations, Lemon asked him to expand on them. \u201cYou think this was a strategy by Yiannopoulos or  ? They put this on in an effort to show that there\u2019s no free speech on a college campus like UC Berkeley?\u201d Reich went on to say that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t bet against it. \u201d \u201cDespite admitting explicitly that the claim was not based on facts, Reich charged ahead in claiming that Breitbart News had an affiliation with the violent rioters that lit fires around campus and beat and pepper sprayed the MILO supporters who were waiting to get into the venue,\u201d reported Breitbart News\u2019 Tom Ciccotta last week, after Reich initially pitched the conspiracy. Rush Limbaugh also mocked Reich\u2019s claims on his own show. The riot started at UC Berkeley on Wednesday after protesters against Breitbart Senior Editor MILO became increasingly violent outside of his show. \u201c \u201d started several fires, smashed windows and ATMs, looted downtown stores, attacked cars, and assaulted dozens of MILO fans, male and female, who they falsely accused of being \u201cNazis. \u201d Despite the large amount of violence, numerous reports indicate that police officers refused to intervene, and only one suspect was arrested. On Sunday, Breitbart News reported that one of the groups behind the riot, Refuse Fascism, had received $50, 000 from a group backed by socialist billionaire George Soros. DANGEROUS is available to   now via Amazon, in hardcover and Kindle editions. And yes, MILO is reading the audiobook version himself!  Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
