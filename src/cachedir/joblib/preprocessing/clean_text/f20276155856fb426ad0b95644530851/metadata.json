What follows are their lists of the fiction and nonfiction books that most moved, excited and enlightened them in 2016  \u2014   books that, in their own ways, are perhaps not finished saying what they have to say. The New York Times has three daily book critics: Michiko Kakutani, Dwight Garner and Jennifer Senior. Because they review different titles, it is impossible for them to compile a single unanimous Top 10 list. They have favorites, however, and are happy to have a chance to list them here. There is also a list from Janet Maslin, who has stepped down from   reviewing but remains a frequent contributor of reviews to The Times. The critics have presented their lists in rough order of preference. \u2018MOONGLOW\u2019 By Michael Chabon (Harper). Told as a faux memoir, this moving novel recounts the story of the narrator\u2019s grandfather: a    Augie   hero  \u2014   a former soldier who\u2019s also a dreamer, roughneck, pool shark and jailbird, by turns na\u00efve and proud, impulsive and romantic. Mr. Chabon is one of the most gifted prose stylists at work today, and he writes here with both easy lyricism and caffeinated ardor, capturing his hero\u2019s love affair with a French refugee (who becomes his wife) and his growing obsession with the moon shot and the space race. Through the lives of these two World War II survivors, he gives us an indelible portrait of one family and America\u2019s lurching progress through the 20th century. (Read the review.) \u2018HITLER: ASCENT,  \u2019 By Volker Ullrich (Alfred A. Knopf). How did a man described as a \u201c  rascal\u201d and \u201cpathetic dunderhead\u201d rise to power in the land of Goethe and Beethoven? Why did millions of ordinary Germans embrace him and his doctrine of hatred? How did this \u201cmost unlikely pretender to high state office\u201d assume complete control of a once democratic country and set it on a monstrous course through history? In this insightful and revealing biography, Mr. Ullrich shows how Hitler used an arsenal of demagogic tools (lies, fake promises, theatrical rallies, mantralike phrases) to exploit a \u201cconstellation of crises\u201d in   War I Germany, including economic woes, unemployment and political dysfunction. He argues that Hitler\u2019s rise was not inevitable but that his domestic adversaries failed to appreciate his ruthlessness, while foreign statesmen na\u00efvely believed that they could control his aggression. His book shows just how the unthinkable can happen. (Read the review.) \u2018NIGHT SKY WITH EXIT WOUNDS\u2019 By Ocean Vuong (Copper Canyon Press). These fierce, startling poems capture the history of prejudice in America (where \u201ctrees   the weight of history\u201d) and the hopes and fears that bring immigrants to its shores. Mr. Vuong  \u2014   who was born on a rice farm outside Saigon in 1988 and was the first in his immediate family to learn to read  \u2014   writes with a musical appreciation for the sound and rhythm of words. He has a talent for capturing stories and memories (like those of his grandmother, who remembers the fall of Saigon) in unexpected and searing images, and uses the magic of language here to turn \u201cbones to sonatas\u201d and by pressing pen to paper, to touch his family \u201cback from extinction. \u201d (Read the review.) \u2018LAB GIRL\u2019 By Hope Jahren (Alfred A. Knopf). The geobiologist Hope Jahren possesses the two attributes Nabokov deemed essential to the writer: \u201cthe precision of a poet and the imagination of a scientist. \u201d Her memoir communicates the electric excitement of a scientific discovery the discipline and tedium involved in conducting   experiments and the arduous, sometimes thrilling experience of fieldwork. The volume is, at once, an enthralling account of her discovery of her vocation, and a gifted teacher\u2019s guidebook to the secret lives of plants  \u2014   a book that should do for botany what Stephen Jay Gould\u2019s writings did for paleontology, and what Oliver Sacks\u2019s essays did for neurology. (Read the review.) \u2018THE NORTH WATER\u2019 By Ian McGuire (Henry Holt). This novel about a   whaling expedition is as gory as Sondheim\u2019s \u201cSweeney Todd,\u201d as darkly melodramatic as a classic Jacobean drama. Its villain, Henry Drax, is a monster, reminiscent of the demonic Judge Holden in Cormac McCarthy\u2019s operatic masterpiece \u201cBlood Meridian\u201d and the sadistic bully Wolf Larsen in Jack London\u2019s \u201cThe  \u201d and its   plot reverberates with echoes of \u201c\u201d \u201cLord Jim\u201d and \u201cThe Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket. \u201d Thanks to its author\u2019s gifts as a writer, however, the novel never reads like a   literary homage, but instead emerges as a gripping and original act of bravura storytelling that immerses us in a Darwinian world that is as unforgiving as it is bloody. (Read the review.) \u2018BORN A CRIME: STORIES FROM A SOUTH AFRICAN CHILDHOOD\u2019 By Trevor Noah (Spiegel  Grau). Best known as the host of \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d Mr. Noah brings to his comedy an outsider\u2019s gift for observation and an instinctive radar for the absurdities of life. His sense of humor was forged during his childhood in South Africa, where he grew up the son of a Xhosa mother and a   father  \u2014   a relationship whose very existence violated that country\u2019s racial laws during the apartheid era. Mr. Noah gives us a harrowing understanding of what it was like to grow up in a society where questions of race permeated every aspect of daily life, and at the same time has written a deeply affecting love letter to his mother, Patricia Nombuyiselo Noah, a remarkable woman who was determined that her son \u201cbe free to go anywhere, do anything, be anyone. \u201d (Read the review.) \u2018THE RETURN: FATHERS, SONS AND THE LAND IN BETWEEN\u2019 By Hisham Matar (Random House). The author\u2019s father, Jaballa Matar, a leading Libyan dissident, was kidnapped in 1990 by agents for that country\u2019s dictator Muammar   and sent to the notorious Abu Salim prison in Tripoli. In this beautifully chiseled book, the younger Mr. Matar chronicles his   search for his missing father, whose absence has haunted him for decades. It\u2019s a detective story of sorts, with Mr. Matar trying to piece together what happened to his father after his arrest. It\u2019s also a story of exile  \u2014   how the author, his brother and their mother tried to invent new lives for themselves abroad  \u2014   and a story of what\u2019s happened in Libya and the Middle East, as hopes fostered by the Arab Spring crashed and burned in one country after another. (Read the review.) \u2018NUTSHELL\u2019 By Ian McEwan (Nan A. Talese). It sounds like a ridiculous premise: a novel narrated by a talking fetus who\u2019s a kind of Hamlet in utero  \u2014   a    (or    as the case may be) who eavesdrops on the affair between his mother, Trudy, and his Uncle Claude. It\u2019s a tribute to Mr. McEwan\u2019s inventiveness and sleight of hand that he turns this incongruous setup into a small tour de force that showcases his gifts as a writer  \u2014   his authority, his imaginative verve, his sly delight in the gymnastics words can perform  \u2014   while conjuring the uncertainties of a contemporary world, troubled by social upheaval, new and old inequities and unexpected political change. (Read the review.) \u2018THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD\u2019 By Colson Whitehead (Doubleday). In this haunting novel, Mr. Whitehead turns the Underground Railroad from a metaphor into an actual train that ferries fugitives north. In doing so, he\u2019s written a potent, hallucinatory novel that leaves us with a devastating understanding of the terrible human costs of slavery. He\u2019s found an elastic voice that accommodates both brute realism and fablelike allegory, the   and the poetic  \u2014   a voice that enables him to convey the emotional fallout of slavery with raw, shocking power, reminding us, in Faulkner\u2019s words: \u201cThe past is never dead. It\u2019s not even past. \u201d (Read the review.) \u2018THE REVENGE OF ANALOG: REAL THINGS AND WHY THEY MATTER\u2019 By David Sax (PublicAffairs). In this captivating book, the reporter David Sax provides an entertaining account of how analog technologies are enjoying a spirited revival: vinyl record sales are booming,   cameras have caught on among millennials and their younger siblings, and   paper notebooks and erasable whiteboards have become a   option in many Silicon Valley offices. In an increasingly digital age, Mr. Sax reminds us of the human craving for tactile, physical things, and the persistence of the real. (Read the review.) Follow Michiko Kakutani on Twitter: @michikokakutani \u2018THE SPORT OF KINGS\u2019 By C. E. Morgan (Farrar, Straus  Giroux). This ravishing and ambitious   novel, set in Kentucky, is a   epic. The author has a special and almost Darwinian interest in consanguinity, in the barbed things that are passed on in the blood of people and of horses, like curses, from generation to generation. (Read the review.) \u2018WHAT BELONGS TO YOU\u2019 By Garth Greenwell (Farrar, Straus  Giroux). This short, incandescent first novel opens as two men meet in a public bathroom beneath the National Palace of Culture in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria. Thus begins a complicated relationship, so tangled that it allows the talented Mr. Greenwell to parse the largest questions about human loyalty, compassion and desire. (Read the review.) \u2018WHITE TRASH: THE   UNTOLD HISTORY OF CLASS IN AMERICA\u2019 By Nancy Isenberg (Viking). Ms. Isenberg retells United States history in a manner that not only includes the weak, the powerless and the stigmatized but places them front and center. As such, she has written an eloquent volume that is more discomforting and more necessary than a semitrailer filled with new biographies of the founding fathers and the most beloved presidents. (Read the review.) \u2018BORN TO RUN\u2019 By Bruce Springsteen (Simon  Schuster). Mr. Springsteen\u2019s memoir is big, loose, rangy and intensely satisfying. It has not been utterly sanitized for anyone\u2019s protection, and it is closely observed from end to end, especially on subjects like sex, art and social class. The Boss could have phoned this book in. He didn\u2019t. (Read the review.) \u2018COLLECTED POEMS  \u2019 By Rita Dove (Norton). Ms. Dove, a former poet laureate of the United States, writes poems that have earthiness, originality, power and range. There are so many casual pleasures in her work that the precision and dexterity  \u2014   the darkness, too  \u2014   can catch you unawares. This is a major collection. (Read the review.) \u2018ALBERT MURRAY: COLLECTED ESSAYS AND MEMOIRS\u2019 By Albert Murray (Library of America). This is a plump and welcome volume from a seminal American critic. Murray\u2019s great subject was the primacy of jazz and the blues in American cultural life. He built complex arguments about how these forms were vastly more than untutored improvisation, and about how music allowed black people to tell their story in ways that literature often could not. This is an enormous book that feels intimate. (Read the review.) \u2018HERE I AM\u2019 By Jonathan Safran Foer (Farrar, Straus  Giroux). Mr. Foer\u2019s first novel in 11 years is a divorce novel and a      novel and running below the narrative, like a headline news ticker, is a plausible dystopian nightmare. I was too hard on this book in my review. It has stuck with me. Its observations are crisp its jokes are funny its intimations of doom resonate. (Read the review.) \u2018KENNETH CLARK: LIFE, ART AND \u2018CIVILISATION\u2019 By James Stourton (Knopf). Mr. Clark was a   figure of cultural life in Britain during the 20th century. An art historian, he was the crusading director of the National Portrait Gallery during World War II and later the erudite host of the pathbreaking BBC series \u201cCivilisation. \u201d This biography tells his complicated story with sensitivity, grace and wit. (Read the review.) \u2018ALL THAT MAN IS\u2019 By David Szalay (Graywolf). Mr. Szalay writes with voluptuous authority. His collection of subtly linked short stories  \u2014   the title is deeply ironic  \u2014   is about masculinity under duress. This meticulous and persuasive book is a vehicle for pain and insult. It\u2019s about invidious distinctions, the ways men compare themselves to other men and come up short. (Read the review.) \u2018THEY CAN\u2019T KILL US ALL: FERGUSON, BALTIMORE, AND A NEW ERA IN AMERICA\u2019S RACIAL JUSTICE MOVEMENT\u2019 By Wesley Lowery (Little, Brown). Mr. Lowery has written an electric book about the shootings of unarmed black men by the police. His account is well reported, plainly told and evidently the work of a man who has not grown a callus on his heart. It contains a great deal of reporting, yet never feels like a data dump. (Read the review.) Follow Dwight Garner on Twitter: @DwightGarner \u2018EVICTED: POVERTY AND PROFIT IN THE AMERICAN CITY\u2019 By Matthew Desmond (Crown). I\u2019ve come to think of \u201cEvicted\u201d as a comet book  \u2014   the sort of thing that swings around only every so often, and is, for those who\u2019ve experienced it, pretty much impossible to forget. It regally combines policy reporting and ethnography, following eight families in Milwaukee as they struggle to find that most basic human necessity: shelter. After reading \u201cEvicted,\u201d you\u2019ll realize you cannot have a serious conversation about poverty without talking about housing. You will also have the mad urge to press it into the hands of every elected official you meet. The book is that good, and it\u2019s that unignorable. Nothing else this year came close. (Read the review.) \u2018IN THE DARKROOM\u2019 By Susan Faludi (Metropolitan Books). An absolute stunner of a memoir from Ms. Faludi, whose father, a   survivor of the Holocaust, decided at 76 to have a   operation. Ms. Faludi has spent a lifetime interrogating conventions of gender, which makes her the ideal narrator for such a story, told with equal parts skepticism and sympathy. Who knew she\u2019d find the ultimate subject under her own roof? (Read the review.) \u2018HILLBILLY ELEGY: A MEMOIR OF A FAMILY AND CULTURE IN CRISIS\u2019 By J. D. Vance (Harper). A compassionate, discerning sociological analysis of the white underclass that helped power the presidential victory of Donald J. Trump, written by a young man who knows whereof he speaks. You may quarrel with Mr. Vance\u2019s conclusions  \u2014   he holds his hillbilly kin personally responsible for much of what ails them  \u2014   but the love he feels for his culture is palpable, and his book is intelligible to Democrats and Republicans alike. Imagine that. (Read the review.) \u2018COMMONWEALTH\u2019 By Ann Patchett (Harper). An exquisite novel about escaping the cage of childhood, which for some involves more tools and a stronger crowbar than your average jailbreak. The pain and challenges of marriage, parenthood, blended families  \u2014   all are subjects Ms. Patchett explores with her customary sensitivity so, too, is the redemptive power of art. Be prepared to cry uncontrollably on Page 297. (Read the review.) \u2018THE ARAB OF THE FUTURE 2: A CHILDHOOD IN THE MIDDLE EAST,  \u2019 By Riad Sattouf, translated by Sam Taylor (Metropolitan Books). The second installment of the exuberantly heretical graphic memoir of Mr. Sattouf, a   cartoonist who once had a weekly comic strip in Charlie Hebdo. This volume focuses on his first year of school in Ter Maaleh, Syria. The children remain little beasts his father remains a baron of bluster and a deluded idealist, still smitten with the promise of  . His   mother tolerates it, but you can already see where their family life is headed  \u2014   south  \u2014   which will inevitably mean moving north, to France. (Read the review.) \u2018DO NOT SAY WE HAVE NOTHING\u2019 By Madeleine Thien (Norton). Here are the opening two lines of Ms. Thien\u2019s gorgeous, sorrowful novel about the horrors of the Chinese Cultural Revolution: \u201cIn a single year, my father left us twice. The first time, to end his marriage, and the second, when he took his own life. \u201d They reel you in, and you never stop reading. A whole world of embattled classical musicians and brave dissidents pops in three dimensions. (Read the review.) \u2018BLOOD AT THE ROOT: A RACIAL CLEANSING IN AMERICA\u2019 By Patrick Phillips (Norton). Stories of savage racism and judicial burlesque were depressingly common in the Jim Crow South, but the tale this book tells is far more astonishing than most: In response to one girl\u2019s murder  \u2014   almost certainly not committed by the three black suspects who were hanged for it  \u2014   the residents of Forsyth County, Ga. drove out all   in 1912, and white that county stayed, right through the end of the 20th century. Mr. Phillips adds texture and context to this shameful,   episode. It\u2019s a powerful reminder that a century isn\u2019t a very long time for hate to dissolve. (Read the review.) \u2018HERO OF THE EMPIRE: THE BOER WAR, A DARING ESCAPE AND THE MAKING OF WINSTON CHURCHILL\u2019 By Candice Millard (Doubleday). A thrilling account of the young Winston Churchill\u2019s heroics in the South African Republic in 1899, which culminated in a prison break and nine days on the run. This book is a   and   character study rolled into one: The man who would be prime minister spilled over with bravado, brains and awesome   even as a youth. Could someone be persuaded to make a movie about this episode of his life? I\u2019d watch. (Read the review.) \u2018GRACE\u2019 By Natashia De\u00f3n (Counterpoint). A dazzling, underappreciated debut novel about a runaway slave, the daughter she never gets to hold, and the saintly man who raises the child instead. Ms. De\u00f3n writes with her nerves  \u2014   she\u2019s got a terrific knack for suspense  \u2014   and thinks with her heart, showing just how devastating slavery was to families, and just how powerful maternal love can be. I\u2019d watch a movie of this one, too. (Read the review.) \u2018HIGH DIVE\u2019 By Jonathan Lee (Knopf). A vibrantly cinematic (again!) novel about the 1984 plot to kill Margaret Thatcher at the Grand Hotel in Brighton. The beauty of this book lies not just in its prose  \u2014   which, by the way, will shame just about anyone who writes for a living  \u2014   but also in its vulnerable, highly appealing characters, including the Irish Republican Army man who\u2019s tasked with doing the deed (a   accomplice to the   Patrick J. Magee). The tension in the book becomes so overpowering that it takes a monk\u2019s restraint not to flip to the end. I am not a monk. (Read the review.) Follow Jennifer Senior on Twitter: @JenSeniorNY \u2018WHEN BREATH BECOMES AIR\u2019 By Paul Kalanithi (Random House). Dr. Kalanithi, a neurosurgeon, had literary ambitions long before he diagnosed his own terminal cancer. He wrote his first book during his last months, with all the joy and hardships that job entailed. To read it is to engage with it actively, thanks to the incisive questions he asked about his life and the enormous immediacy he brought to every page.   and unforgettable, it\u2019s the book I have given as a gift most often in 2016. (Read the review.) \u2018HEAT AND LIGHT\u2019 By Jennifer Haigh (Ecco). Ms. Haigh has set many of her lifelike stories Bakerton, a fictitious mining town not unlike the place in Pennsylvania where she grew up. \u201cHeat and Light,\u201d her biggest novel yet, is a sweeping Bakerton tour de force with a contemporary time frame. The book\u2019s subject may sound shockingly unsexy, but you will be amazed by what Ms. Haigh does with the incursion of fracking into this unguarded little world. (Read the review.) \u2018VICTORIA: THE QUEEN: AN INTIMATE BIOGRAPHY OF THE WOMAN WHO RULED AN EMPIRE\u2019 By Julia Baird (Random House). Ms. Baird\u2019s uncommonly frisky biography is outstanding for its liveliness and originality. It whisks away any cobwebs of Victorianism from its portrait of a willful, complicated queen whose own father sized her up as \u201crather a pocket Hercules, than a pocket Venus. \u201d Ms. Baird\u2019s access to previously unexplored source material casts very new light on her subject. \u2018THE TRESPASSER\u2019 By Tana French (Viking). Ms. French has been a corker among crime writers ever since \u201cIn the Woods\u201d won the Edgar for best first novel. But her sixth, \u201cThe Trespasser,\u201d has expanded her renown. It features Antoinette Conway, the lone woman on the Dublin Murder Squad, who has to put up with    harassment while she tackles the murder of a woman who seems eerily familiar. Be warned: This book is a   ticket to its five predecessors. Ms. French is no genre author. She\u2019s a   novelist who just happens to see dead people at the centers of her stories. (Read the review.) \u2018AT THE EXISTENTIALIST CAF\u00c9: FREEDOM, BEING, AND APRICOT COCKTAILS\u2019 By Sarah Bakewell (Other Press). This is a surprisingly personal book for its author. She became a devotee of Sartre and the existentialists as a teenager. Decades later, she revisits their philosophies and personalities, as well as those of the phenomenologists who influenced them. If this sounds chilly and abstract, it is not. Ms. Bakewell is a wonderful explicator and a highly opinionated one. She makes both her ideas and her affections clear. A tough but splendid book on what, she demonstrates, is a newly fresh school of thought. (Read the review.) \u2018TRUEVINE: TWO BROTHERS, A KIDNAPPING AND A MOTHER\u2019S QUEST: A TRUE STORY OF THE JIM CROW SOUTH\u2019 By Beth Macy (Little, Brown). Ms. Macy, whose reporting led to \u201cFactory Man,\u201d a stunning account of what globalization had done to an Appalachian furniture factory and its owners and workers, has once again mined the area for nonfiction. This time, her story revolves around George and Willie Muse, albino   brothers born into a region where there was simply no place for them they disappeared after a recruiter for the circus came to town. The Muse family always believed that they\u2019d been stolen. But Ms. Macy balances compassion and doggedness in pushing past that easy answer. (Read the review.) \u2018NEWS OF THE WORLD\u2019 By Paulette Jiles (William Morrow). Set in the winter of 1870, this vigorous National Book Award nominee tells the story of Capt. Jefferson Kyle Kidd, an itinerant news reader in Texas who is asked to make a journey. Would he please go to the San Antonio area to return a white girl \u201crescued\u201d from the Kiowa Indians to what remains of her family? In Ms. Jiles\u2019s exquisite, unsentimental voice, this novel describes the captain\u2019s journey with the initially surly    he calls Johanna. The novel abounds with the joys of freedom, the adventure of traversing untamed Texas and the discovery of unexpected, proprietary love. (Read the review.) \u2018WE LOVE YOU, CHARLIE FREEMAN\u2019 By Kaitlyn Greenidge (Algonquin). Ms. Greenidge\u2019s daringly abrasive debut novel begins with an absurd premise: What if the members of a black family agreed to move to a very white part of the Berkshires and, for scientific purposes, raise a chimp named Charlie as one of their children? That family, the Freemans, lands at a large gated pile called the Toneybee Institute and is much too warmly welcomed. This happens in 1990, but the book also has a section (and a brave heroine) at Toneybee in 1929  \u2014   and it\u2019s here that Ms. Greenidge\u2019s ferocity breaks through. When the real nature of all the institute\u2019s \u201cscience\u201d is exposed, she steers her gutsy book toward a devastating conclusion. (Read the review.) \u2018IQ\u2019 By Joe Ide (Mulholland Books). This is the start of a   comedic crime franchise with a bright future. Isaiah Quintabe (IQ for short) is an unlikely Sherlock, an incongruously polite cogitator operating out of gangsta turf in East Long Beach, Calif. The commercially savvy Mr. Ide has cast this book well: It features a hugely famous but   rapper IQ\u2019s sidekick, a petty crook named Dodson Dodson\u2019s loudmouthed girlfriend and IQ\u2019s dead older brother, who serves as his conscience and really, really loved Motown. Aggressively entertaining plotting is paired with the kind of dialogue for which readers love Don Winslow. This series is a Los Angeles classic right from the start. (Read the review.) \u2018BEFORE THE FALL\u2019 By Noah Hawley (Grand Central). Beach book of the summer. Imagine that Agatha Christie had set a   mystery on an airplane and included Wall Street and entertainment executive types in her lineup of suspects. Now imagine that airplane crashing into the Atlantic before the story even gets going. Foul play, of course. Anyone on the plane could have been the reason it went down. And the poor survivor  \u2014   not an oxymoron here  \u2014   will catch hell just for being alive. Mr. Hawley, the expert TV showrunner, obviously had the skills to pull this off. Good thing he had the free time, too. (Read the review.)'"}, "time": 1742628513.2239406}
