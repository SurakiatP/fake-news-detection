Several congressional committees have referred the abortion provider for possible criminal prosecution as a result of investigations into the allegations.

President Donald Trump has promised to work to defund the group if it continues to provide abortions. A video produced by   organization Live Action highlights how   politicians promote Planned Parenthood\u2019s \u201chealthcare services\u201d when such services are either unavailable or greatly declining:   [VIDEO] A recent Marist poll found that 61 percent of Americans oppose taxpayer funding of abortion, including 40 percent of those who say they are \u201c\u201d and 41 percent of Democrats. Planned Parenthood performs more than 300, 000 abortions per year and receives over a half billion dollars in federal taxpayer funding annually. Live Action also reports that, over the last six years, Planned Parenthood\u2019s annual clientele has dropped half a million clients, and the organization has closed more than 200 clinics. Utilizing Planned Parenthood\u2019s own annual reports, the   group found that over the last ten years, Planned Parenthood\u2019s annual breast exams have declined 60 percent, Pap tests have decreased 77 percent, and annual cancer screenings have dropped 68 percent. \u201cHowever, Planned Parenthood\u2019s annual abortions have increased 27 percent,\u201d observes Live Action, noting the group performs 34. 9 percent of abortions in the nation.'"}, "time": 1742561717.789414}
