Recipient Name Recipient Email => \\nDear Mexican: I found your column about Mexican men and spousal abuse, and my question is: Is there any help for this ever ending? I\u2019ve been with a Mexican man, who is also an abuser of alcohol, although it has slimmed down some. He gets angry out of the blue and starts hitting on me and later realizes what he has done and cries. I had to leave him for my protection, but the feelings between us remain, and I don\u2019t know what to do with the situation. Can you provide any comments or help? \\nAbusada \\nDear Abused: Get out of that relationship\u2014now. But before you leave, coat that pendejo \u2019s toilet paper with habanero powder, so he gets the burn in the culo he deserves. \\nHow do Mexicans feel about environmental issues? Specifically, a population explosion that will cause eventual food shortages? I am told that procreation is a very macho thing for the Mexican male. You have even mentioned in the past that men do not perform oral sex on women because it\u2019s not important when having children. How does that way of thinking weigh in with regard to the future of the planet? \\nEl Blanco Pedro \\nDear Pedro Gabacho:Malthus called\u2014he wants his crackpot theory back. Besides, the gabacho love of suburbia proved far more toxic to the environment than any 12-child Mexican mom ever did, so vete a la chingada con your faux environmental concern. \\nOPEN LETTER TO OUR NEW PRESIDENT: Gentle cabrones: as I write this, the Mexican still doesn\u2019t have a feel for whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump (or neither?) will be the next president of the United States (The Mexican has to file his columna a week before actual publication\u2014 viva dead-tree journalism). In the interest of not looking more pendejo than usual, I will write three open letters to ensure I get the results right. Enjoy! \\nTO PRESIDENT HILLARY CLINTON: Congrats on beating that pendejo Trump\u2014you\u2019re now the greatest female savior of Mexicans since the original Santa Sabina, the legendary curandera for which the goth-Mex band was named. But that\u2019s not enough. Do not inherit the title of Deporter-in-Chief from Obama. Realize that the only reason you won is because raza overwhelmingly voted for you\u2014and we want results besides appointments of token vendidos (although do give a cool gig to Congressman Xavier Becerra, a truly down Chicano). Don\u2019t pay attention to all the Know Nothings who insist on enforcement before amnesty. There\u2019s millions of Mexicans who have lived their entire lives in limbo, and it\u2019s your job to save them. And if you do that? We\u2019ll create a new altar to you at Tepeyac. \\nTO PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Congrats on beating that pendeja Killary\u2014you\u2019re now the greatest unifier of Mexicans since Porfirio Diaz. Don\u2019t even try to deport 12 million people, or build that nasty, small-handed wall. Back in the day, raza mostly stood meekly as everyone from Presidents Hoover to Roosevelt to Eisenhower to Obama enacted mass deportations\u2014but those were honorable men. You\u2019re not. We will protest, we will resist, we will struggle, we will take over elected offices the way Irish took over Boston. You hear me, President Pendejo ? We ain\u2019t no sleeping giant\u2014we woke, and we\u2019re ready to make your one-term more pitiful than Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto. Oh, and #fucktrump. \\nTO NO RESULTS YET : No mames, America. \\nAsk the Mexican at themexican@askamexican.net, be his fan on Facebook, follow him on Twitter @gustavoarellano or follow him on Instagram @gustavo_arellano!\""}, "time": 1742561738.8824067}
