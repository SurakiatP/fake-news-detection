Despite all odds ( since all the public odds were rigged ) Trump\u2019s sweeping win of the electoral vote was a stunning blow to Hillary Clinton supporters. \\nAnd they aren\u2019t taking their loss gracefully. They\u2019re shouting, swearing, crying, and, according to the most frequent word I\u2019ve seen, absolutely terrified. They seem unaware of the irony that when they refer to Trump as a fascist, they\u2019re actually the ones protesting a legitimately elected leader simply because their candidate didn\u2019t win. \\nProtests began last night within hours of the announcement . \\nThe First Amendment guarantees our right to peaceful assembly , but that isn\u2019t what is happening. Injuries, obstruction of roadways, and destruction of property have begun to occur, and I strongly believe the violence will continue to escalate. If you can at all, stay home and away from areas with large gatherings \u2013 it doesn\u2019t take much to turn a peaceful crowd into an angry mob. If you are unprepared for civil unrest on this scale, go here for guidance . \\nWe\u2019re a small operation here at DaisyLuther.com , and there are just too many people having hissies because their team didn\u2019t win the trophy. Since we can\u2019t write a new article for each one, I\u2019m putting them into one feed that will be updated frequently. Check back for the latest temper tantrums updates frequently.
