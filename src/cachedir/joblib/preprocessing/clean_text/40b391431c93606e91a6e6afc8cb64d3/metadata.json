Today\u2019s introduction comes to us from Adam Popescu, a reporter based in Los Angeles.  In turning the Trayvon Martin tragedy into a virtual reality film, the director Nonny de la Pe\u00f1a combed through public court records and stitched together 911 calls to structure an auditory narrative of the rainy night that ended in the shooting death of the unarmed    by George Zimmerman. To get the look of the apartment complex in Sanford, Fla. where the events took place, Ms. de la Pe\u00f1a, a former Newsweek correspondent who runs a virtual reality company in Santa Monica, found architectural drawings of the location online, designs that were then rendered as video   C. G. I. models. The final product, called \u201cOne Dark Night,\u201d was recently shown at Los Angeles\u2019 Hammer Museum and is now available on Google Play and Steam. \u201cThis is immersive journalism,\u201d she said, intended to drive empathy. But it also raises issues about taste and truth. I caught up with Ms. de la Pe\u00f1a by phone. Here are some excerpts from the conversation: Q. How did this piece come together? A. \u201cOne Dark Night\u201d is sourced entirely from 911 calls, trial testimony and architectural drawings of the condo complex where the shooting took place. I\u2019m still an investigative journalist at heart, and it was very much the kind of story I used to cover as a print reporter. I really wanted to make a piece about the shooting, to be able to cast any kind of additional spotlight on the case using V. R. Q. Why Trayvon Martin? Why not Freddie Gray or another tragedy? A. Nothing other than I had the ability and I had the time and I felt I was the person to do it. Something clicked when I began investigating the Trayvon case. Q. You say it\u2019s meant to draw empathy. Do you acknowledge that videos of shootings can be interpreted in multiple ways, and that this piece is subject to such questions? A. Definitely. I\u2019ve had a journalist say that they better understood Zimmerman\u2019s position. We\u2019re always trying to figure out what we can convey to the viewer and what\u2019s appropriate to show. For audiences not reading newspapers or watching broadcast TV, V. R. can reach them where they play. This is how you keep an informed global citizenry and keep democracy robust. What do we decide to shield them from? I think that that question is only going to be more pronounced as this media becomes more mature.

[YouTube | Kevin Lowe] Among those most pleased by the return of rain to California have been wild mushroom enthusiasts. Years of drought put a damper on the foraging of fungus in the state\u2019s forests, a hobby that has burgeoned with the growing popularity of fresh, local food. Amateur clubs up and down the state are organized around both the culinary and scientific celebration of California\u2019s many mushroom species. As the rainfall began to surge last October, so did the autumn mushrooms, said Debbie Viess, a   of the Bay Area Mycological Society. \u201cWe had a tremendous year for porcinis,\u201d she said, \u201cand it\u2019s been a really good year for chanterelles too. \u201d Even with the continuing rain, several mushroom experts were wary about making predictions for the spring season, when popular morel mushrooms are normally abundant. While water is necessary, it isn\u2019t sufficient, said Patrick Hamilton, a longtime mushroom picker in Sonoma County. \u201cThere are so many things, from soil conditions, to climatic conditions, to the age of the trees, all these things are difficult to understand,\u201d he said. But the mystery, he added, \u201cis part of the fun. \u201d California Today goes live at 6 a. m. Pacific time weekdays. Tell us what you want to see: CAtoday@nytimes. com.
