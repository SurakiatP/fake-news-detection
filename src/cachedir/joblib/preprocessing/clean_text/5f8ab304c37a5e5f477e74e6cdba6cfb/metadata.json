But an offer from China to present the city with a nearly    bronze statue of Marx, the   intellectual who was one of the writers of \u201cThe Communist Manifesto,\u201d is overshadowing the festivities a year before they begin. After months of discussion and more than an hour of lively debate, the City Council in Trier, in western Germany near the border with Luxembourg, decided on Monday to accept the gift from the Chinese government, by the sculptor Wu Weishan. However, the Council left open the thorny questions of how large it would be and where in the city it would stand. \u201cKarl Marx is one of the most important citizens of this city, and we should not hide him,\u201d the mayor of Trier, Wolfram Leibe, told the public broadcaster SWR before the vote. Statues of Marx, who was born in Trier on May 5, 1818, and later lived in Berlin, London and Paris, were common throughout Eastern Europe during the Cold War, and several still survive in Germany\u2019s formerly communist eastern states, including in Berlin. But his birthplace, firmly in the former West Germany, has struggled with how best to remember its famous son. The city, which is on the banks of the Moselle River and in an important   area, has increasingly become a destination for tourists from China, but many residents are nevertheless uncomfortable with accepting a gift from the Chinese government. \u201cChina is not a free country, quite the opposite,\u201d a Trier newspaper quoted Tobias Schneider of the Free Democratic Party in Trier as saying on Monday. \u201cWe could draw up a long list of human rights violations. Do we want to allow such a rogue regime to set up a statue of Karl Marx in the heart of our city?\u201d The Chinese told city officials they were offering the statue to honor the bicentennial and as a symbol of the strong ties between the countries. The Chinese government agreed to cover about   of the cost of a pedestal for the statue and its installation, estimated at 105, 000 euros, or about $112, 000. But after word spread about the gift, many residents balked at the idea of a bronze version of the father of communism towering over the Simeonstiftplatz, the city\u2019s square, which is named for a church that once stood there. City authorities erected a wooden   in the square to give residents an idea of how it might look. In the end, a majority of the Council voted to accept the statue, although perhaps a smaller version of it than was originally envisioned, with a final height to be determined later. It would be unveiled as part of the city\u2019s attempt to   Marx\u2019s work and the turbulent time in which he lived, through exhibitions and intellectual discussions. \u201cThis debate is less about human rights, aesthetics or location\u201d of the statue, Richard Leuckefeld\u2019s of the Green Party said. \u201cIt is about getting the city out of a predicament, because those responsible have failed to honor Karl Marx. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561855.130116}
