Police investigators on Friday arrested Fran\u00e7oise Oliveira, the Brazilian wife of the Greek envoy, Kyriakos Amiridis, and S\u00e9rgio Gomes Moreira, the officer who confessed to killing the ambassador while having an affair with Ms. Oliveira. \u201cThis was a tragic, cowardly act,\u201d said Evaristo Magalh\u00e3es, the lead investigator in the case. He said that Ms. Oliveira, 40, and Mr. Moreira, 29, plotted the killing on Sunday before the officer carried it out on Monday. Ms. Oliveira tried to mislead investigators by saying her husband, 59, had disappeared, Mr. Magalh\u00e3es said, insisting that she was innocent before confessing on Friday that her lover had killed him. In tears, Ms. Oliveira said that the ambassador\u2019s death \u201ccould not be avoided,\u201d Mr. Magalh\u00e3es said. The case provided a gruesome finish to the year, as Rio reels from a harrowing crime wave, a financial crisis and graft scandals, just months after hosting the Olympic Games. The suspected murder of the ambassador by an officer also trains scrutiny on Rio\u2019s police forces, already under pressure over extrajudicial killings, torture, forming  militias and assassinating candidates in municipal elections. Ms. Oliveira is connected to another violent episode in Rio, the 2003 killing of Todd Staheli, an American executive for the oil giant Shell, and his wife, Michelle. The handyman who confessed to the murders was arrested after he allegedly jumped the wall into the nearby home where Ms. Oliveira lived with Mr. Amiridis, who was Greece\u2019s consul in Rio at the time. \u201cUntil then, no one knew that Amiridis was married,\u201d said Hildegard Angel, a columnist who writes about Rio\u2019s   and diplomatic circles, describing the Greek diplomat as \u201coutgoing and extremely charming. \u201d The police got a break in the killing of Mr. Amiridis when a man identified as a cousin of Mr. Moreira told investigators that Ms. Oliveira had offered him about $25, 000 to assist in the murder. The cousin, Eduardo Moreira de Melo, 24, was also arrested on Friday. Investigators found Mr. Amiridis\u2019s charred remains on Thursday in a car abandoned near an overpass in Nova Igua\u00e7u, a gritty city on the fringes of metropolitan Rio. While Mr. Amiridis and his wife lived in the capital, Bras\u00edlia, Ms. Oliveira was from the Rio area and they were here to spend the holidays with relatives, according to the police. Investigators identified the car as the same vehicle Mr. Amiridis had rented in Rio, while obtaining images from security cameras in the gated community where the ambassador and his wife owned a home. The footage appeared to show Mr. Moreira and Mr. de Melo preparing to haul Mr. Amiridis\u2019s body into the vehicle on Monday night. \u201cWe knew that police officer, he\u2019d even been in our family\u2019s home,\u201d Ros\u00e2ngela Oliveira, Ms. Oliveira\u2019s mother, told the newspaper Extra, explaining that the suspect had moonlighted as a security guard for a lawyer who is a friend of the family. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know if the two really were having an affair. \u201d Mr. Magalh\u00e3es, the police investigator, said that both Ms. Oliveira and Mr. Moreira had acknowledged being romantically involved over the last six months. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to determine if Fran\u00e7oise wanted to kill the ambassador to take control of his assets and live with the police officer,\u201d said Mr. Magalh\u00e3es. He said that Ms. Oliveira had also contended that she had been battered by her husband, but that authorities had not found any indication that she had pressed charges against him. According to his official biography, Mr. Amiridis studied law at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and received a master\u2019s degree in European law from the Sorbonne in Paris before doing postgraduate work in international penal law. He began his career as an attach\u00e9 at the Foreign Ministry in Athens. His first posting abroad was in 1988 at the Greek Embassy in Belgrade, then the capital of Yugoslavia and now of Serbia. In 1993, he joined the Greek delegation to the European Union, based in Brussels. From 2001 to 2004, Mr. Amiridis was the Greek consul general in Rio, a period during which he met Ms. Oliveira. This year, he returned to Brazil as the ambassador. He and his wife lived in Bras\u00edlia with their daughter. Between the Brazil stints, Mr. Amiridis was Greece\u2019s consul general in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and ambassador to Libya, among other postings. In a statement, Greece\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed sorrow over the killing of Mr. Amiridis, who had been lauded for his role in the evacuation of Greeks and other foreigners in Libya in 2014 during the continuing civil war there.'"}, "time": 1742563088.7366924}
