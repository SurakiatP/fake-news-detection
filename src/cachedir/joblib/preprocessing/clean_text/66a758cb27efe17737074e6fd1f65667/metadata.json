Farage called Clinton a \u201csad and pathetic\u201d and a \u201cbad loser\u201d now worthy of being ignored. \u201cI mean, Hillary said the same things about me when I came across and supported Donald Trump in his campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth getting angry about Hillary. I just think she looks sad and pathetic. There is nothing worse in life than a bad loser, nothing worse than somebody who blames absolutely everybody else for their own failings. And let\u2019s face it, you know, she represented an       establishment. She almost appeared as if it was her right to become the president and I\u2019m very pleased she didn\u2019t. I\u2019ll tell you what  \u2014   let\u2019s just from now ignore her. \u201d Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor'"}, "time": 1742561883.794045}
