Sounds EXACTLY like the type of guy we want one breath from the presidency, right? \\nAnd what exactly does Kaine mean by saying that the FBI \u201cisn\u2019t providing many details, but details are apparently being given\u201d? \\nThis may sound inappropriate to Kaine, because anything that isn\u2019t positive about Clinton is inappropriate. \\nOf course, it would be another matter altogether if this was about Trump.'"}, "time": 1742628326.98601}
