The Guardian reports : \\n\u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid\u201d was a phrase coined by her husband\u2019s adviser James Carville in the 1992 election and, in many ways, it ought to have helped Democrats again in 2016. Barack Obama helped rescue the US from the financial crash and presided over a record series of consecutive quarters of job growth. \\nUnfortunately for Clinton, many Americans simply did not feel as positive. Stagnant wage levels and soaring inequality were symptoms of the malaise felt by many voters. Trump successfully convinced them to believe this was caused by bad trade deals and a rigged economy. \\nDespite being pushed in this direction by Sanders in the Democratic primary, Clinton never really found a satisfactory response. Her volte-face on trade sounded \u2013 and was later proved by leaked emails \u2013 unconvincing at best; deeply cynical at worst. \\nSimilarly, Brexit \u2013 the other recent vote which went against all political forecasts \u2013 was largely a vote by those who lost out on the benefits of globalization \u2026 that only a handful of fatcats really profited from. \\nLeaders of the Brexit campaign noted the confluence of the two votes: \\nJeremy Corbyn described Mr Trump\u2019s victory as \u201can unmistakable rejection of political establishment\u201d . \\nUkip leader Nigel Farage \u2013 who went to the US to appear at a Trump campaign rally \u2013 said he was handing over his mantle as the creator of political earthquakes to the new President, saying that 2016 was \u201cthe year of two great political revolutions\u201d, adding: \u201cI thought Brexit was big, but boy, this looks like it\u2019s going to be even bigger\u201d. \\nN igel Farage has issued this statement following Donald Trump\u2019s victory. \\n\u201cToday, the establishment is in deep shock. Even more so than after Brexit. What we are witnessing is the end of a period of big business and big politics controlling our lives. \\nVoters across the Western world want nation state democracy, proper border controls and to be in charge of their own lives. \\nI commend Donald Trump for the courage with which he has fought this campaign and I look forward to a closer relationship between the USA and the UK. We now have a President who likes our country and understands our post-Brexit values. \\nPrepare for further political shocks in the years to come.\u201d \\nVoters in the UK and the world\u2019s strongest nation, the U.S., have both rebuked the status quo, including neoliberal trade and economic policies. \\nWhat\u2019s next? \\nThe rebellion will spread \u2026 \\nFor example, it\u2019s so probable that Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union party will be thrown out on its ear that Merkel is already trying to distract with silly claims that the Russians will hack the German election. \\nPostscript: There are, of course, other reasons that Trump won. But the economy is the main one.'"}, "time": 1742562464.1934483}
