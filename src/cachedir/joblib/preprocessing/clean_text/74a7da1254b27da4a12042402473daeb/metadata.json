Has it really been nine months since we saw him last, taking the final, cruelest blow from young Olly and collapsing onto the ground, blood pooling behind him? It seems like he never left, what with the various rumors and sightings, reports about haircuts and breathless dispatches about Kit Harington\u2019s romance with the equally dead, in \u201cThrones\u201d terms, Rose Leslie. But there he was on Sunday, stone dead and stiffening as Ghost howled in despair. And he only got stiffer as the hour progressed, while Davos pondered his next moves with a few loyalists and the mutineers went public with their treachery. Even the Red Woman, everyone\u2019s favorite candidate for resurrecting Snow, could only stand there dumbfounded by the turn of events. \u201cI saw him in the flames fighting at Winterfell,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t speak for the flames,\u201d Davos said. \u201cBut he\u2019s gone. \u201d Now, will he stay that way for long? Probably not. As I noted in a season preview, the show will have to resolve this thing one way or the other pretty soon or it will risk overshadowing the rest of the story  \u2014   ask the \u201cWalking Dead\u201d folks about viewers\u2019 general patience with narrative shenanigans these days. But for one week, at least, the dude was dead, just like everyone said. [ Subscribe to our Watching newsletter for expert movie and TV recommendations. ] The Snow thing was one of about 13, 000 subplots (a rough estimate) that got serviced in the season premiere, a terrifically busy episode that at times, with its quick glimpses of exposition and rapid cutting from scene to scene to scene, reminded me a bit of the old \u201cBatman\u201d show. Here\u2019s two minutes in Meereen  \u2014   CUT  \u2014   here\u2019s Cersei and Jaime  \u2014   CUT  \u2014   poor Blind Arya  \u2014   CUT  \u2014   Sansa in the snow  \u2014   CUT  \u2014   Sand Snakes!  \u2014   et cetera. Story density is a key component of \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d of course, the breadth and depth of its world is part of what makes the show so transportive. But it can make for frenetic viewing in these early   episodes. That said, the scenes at Castle Black had plenty of room to breathe and others, like Sansa\u2019s rescue and Ellaria Sand\u2019s power grab in Dorne, packed plenty of thrills into tight spaces. Also, you go into \u201cThrones\u201d premieres knowing they\u2019re about picking up the pieces from the previous season, and this year the shards are especially jagged. Cersei, former   has had everything ripped away, to the point that she can\u2019t even get mad at Jaime about the hash he made of the Myrcella rescue effort. The witch told me I\u2019d have three children and they\u2019d all die, she said. \u201cEverything she said came true, you couldn\u2019t have stopped it. \u201d (What\u2019s that, Tommen? Oh nothing. Never you mind   \u2026    ) Cersei\u2019s old nemesis Margaery, meanwhile, is still in the hoosegow, taking her own turn with the Nurse Ratched of TV nuns. \u201cSepta Unella can be overzealous at times,\u201d the High   said. Gee, ya think? Over in Essos, Daenerys Targaryen has to be wondering if you can really call yourself the Mother of Dragons if your dragons like to abandon you in random fields. She\u2019s now a prisoner of her new Dothraki friends, and they are classy. Khaleesi spent the early moments enduring two charming lads who made all sorts of offensive remarks and speculations. The confab with the Khal continued along the same trajectory until Khaleesi had finally had enough. I\u2019m the former wife of Khal Drogo, she said. I burned his body and everything. Oh, well that changes things, Khal Moro said, to Khaleesi\u2019s satisfaction, but then he threw her a curveball. The best place for you is the widow temple, she was told, which I\u2019m guessing is just as delightful as it sounds. I still think we should cut off her head, Moro\u2019s wife muttered, probably. Even Ramsay, the sociopathic monster we\u2019ve come to know and loathe, showed a bit of what almost seemed like actual human emotion and heartbreak. He mourned Myranda, tossed to her death by Theon last season, recalling how only she wasn\u2019t afraid of him back when he was a young bastard and she a simple kennel master\u2019s daughter. \u201cShe smelled of dog,\u201d he reminisced fondly. (Awww. Also, Ramsay\u2019s apparently been terrible forever.) He composed himself in time to make plans for the funeral. Coffin or pyre? someone asked. Try the dog dish. Finally, there was the aforementioned alluring Red Woman of the episode title, who in the startling concluding moments was revealed to actually be an Old Gray Mare. \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen her do what I\u2019ve seen her do,\u201d Davos had told his compatriots earlier. My friend, you haven\u2019t seen the half of it. At first I thought perhaps it was the omnipresent intricate choker that conferred her lustrous youth and beauty, but photographic evidence suggests she\u2019s removed it before without such dramatic consequences. There was a   on the vial on her dressing table so perhaps her beauty secret is contained therein. Whatever it is, the transformation made for a graphic illustration of the fall she, too, has taken. We saw last year what her ghastly strategic advice brought Stannis (R. I. P. Shireen) and now all of her plans for Jon Snow, glimpsed in the flames, have apparently gone up in smoke. There\u2019s nothing left for this once vivacious, insidiously confident force but to crawl miserably into bed like the feeble old woman she really is. Indeed, it\u2019s perhaps wishful thinking but there were signs that the arc of \u201cThrones\u201d history, mostly distinguished thus far by cruelty, might be starting to bend toward decency, or at least tipping away from the sinister interests that have dominated things lately. In addition to Melisandre\u2019s crisis of faith, there is the terrible Ramsay\u2019s inheritance crisis, after his reprehensible \u201cgames\u201d drove away the one thing that could have solidified his place in his family and his family\u2019s place in the North. I\u2019m talking about Sansa Stark, of course, whose escape and rescue by Brienne infused the narrative with more hope than has any other single scene I can recall. [ Interview: Maisie Williams on the Season 6 premiere ] Theon led Sansa away from Winterfell with great drive and courage, and continued to suggest Reek may be receding. (Some aspects of the old Theon are never coming back, of course, but maybe he can fill the void with volunteering or something.) He went on to sacrifice himself before Ramsay\u2019s hounds and men. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see what part Ramsay cuts off you this time,\u201d a henchman muttered with glee. Well, I can\u2019t wait to see warrior maiden slice you up like a ham,  . And so it went, when Brienne arrived with a notably   Podrick to save the day, for once. I\u2019ve bagged on Brienne for awhile now over her general failure to fulfill her oath to protect the Stark girls. So credit where it\u2019s due: Nice job, Brienne! Score one for dogged persistence. The lesson is that Brienne gets it done, it just takes longer than most of us would like. After all, she killed Stannis in last year\u2019s finale and she\u2019d only been after him since his smokebaby killed Renly in Season 2. So I should probably stop projecting my   impatience onto her. Finally, there was the emergence of Sansa, who you\u2019ll recall seemed ready to take charge of her destiny around this time last year before the whole Ramsay nightmare intervened. Whatever your thoughts about the brutalities she endured and how they were presented, they no doubt hardened her. And when she accepted Brienne\u2019s vow of loyalty and affirmed hers as well, it felt like a symbolic assumption of command of her shattered family. Starting with the death of Ned Stark and certainly since the Red Wedding, this story has been   with villainy. Sansa\u2019s union with Brienne felt like it could be a first step toward restoring some balance between wicked strivers and nobler interests. Of course, we\u2019ve seen something like this before: One of the most triumphant moments in the show was when Dany took off on Drogon, and look what that got her. There are still zombies out there somewhere, too. But just give me this for one week, O. K.? When it comes to \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d I\u2019ll take whatever hope I can get. \u2022 Someone\u2019s burning boats in Meereen. Maybe one day Tyrion and Varys can make me care about Meereen. There is apparently a mysterious figure orchestrating the Harpy insurrection, though, which could get interesting. The   joke was pretty broad but still enjoyable. (Name me another show about which you can read a phrase like \u201cthe   joke\u201d and not bat an eye.) \u2022 On the other hand, get a load of the action in Dorne! There was more excitement there in three minutes than there was in all of Season 5. An underrated aspect of this show is the way seemingly minor characters evolve into major players. Ellaria Sand seemed like little more than a lascivious sidekick when she arrived with Oberyn in Season 4, but there she was on Sunday staging a coup, inaugurating a new   men era of Dornish leadership. \u2022 Poor Trystane. He and Myrcella always seemed too delicate for this savage world, but that thing went bad in a hurry, and more graphically than I would have guessed. Obara the Sand Snake dispatched him with the sort of protruding Pinocchio skewer that\u2019s become a signature finishing move on \u201cGame of Thrones. \u201d (See also, the rotten Karl Tanner in Season 4.) \u2022 Blind in Braavos seems like no kind of fun, and that\u2019s before a girl starts beating you with a stick. \u201cSee you tomorrow,\u201d the Waif told Arya, in what might have been the most chilling line of the night. \u2022 Forget everyone who isn\u2019t us, Jaime told Cersei (more or less). Is it wrong that I found their reunion sort of touching? Also, should we be preparing for a more sympathetic Cersei this season? \u201cFrom her first breath she was so sweet. I don\u2019t know where she came from,\u201d she said about Myrcella. \u201cI thought if I could make something so good, so pure, maybe I\u2019m not a monster. \u201d \u2022 The weight of betraying Jon Snow really aged young Olly, huh? \u2022 Over all pretty good, right? I\u2019m intrigued by how Cersei and Melisandre are going to put themselves back together, and by Sansa\u2019s continuing emergence. Clearly Davos isn\u2019t going to   it south, as Ser Alliser advised, but how do you think that whole thing\u2019s going to shake out? Are you still invested in it either way?
