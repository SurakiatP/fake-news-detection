He was 62. Justin Long, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Prisons, said Mr. Pearlman died of cardiac arrest at a hospital. At his death he was an inmate at the Federal Correctional Institution in Miami. Mr. Pearlman began his career in blimp rentals before turning to the music business. All his interests, from aviation to boy bands and to the Ponzi scheme that lead to his conviction in 2008, were housed under the Trans Continental companies, whose financial centerpiece was an airline that existed only on paper. Before his scheme ran aground, however, Mr. Pearlman built some of the most successful music groups of the 1990s, one of which started the career of Justin Timberlake, managed from Mr. Pearlman\u2019s lavish home in Orlando, Fla. But he ended up locked in legal battles with almost all the musicians he managed, who accused him of lining his pockets at their expense. In a video interview with The Wall Street Journal, three members of the Backstreet Boys said he had used his ownership of their equipment and band name to halt one of their tours briefly in retaliation for suing him. The group settled out of court. Other musical acts under his management, like \u2019NSync and LFO, either reached their own settlements or disbanded. Almost all the musicians Mr. Pearlman worked with were young men, and some accused him of sexual impropriety. \u201cI would absolutely say the guy was a sexual predator,\u201d Steve Mooney, a singer who worked as Mr. Pearlman\u2019s assistant and lived in his home for two years, told Vanity Fair magazine in 2007. \u201cAll the talent knew what Lou\u2019s game was. If they say no, they\u2019re lying to you. \u201d Rich Cronin, a singer in LFO, told Vanity Fair that Mr. Pearlman was \u201calways grabbing\u201d the young men he worked with. He said he thought Mr. Pearlman had entered the music business to meet men and had become a hitmaker by accident. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t think Lou ever thought we would become stars,\u201d Mr. Cronin said. \u201cI just think he wanted cute guys around him this was all an excuse. And then lightning crazily struck, and an empire was created. It was all dumb luck. \u201d Mr. Pearlman was never prosecuted for any sex crimes, and in a 2014 jailhouse interview with Billboard magazine he denied that he had committed any. \u201cThe accusations that came out in that article, none of it was substantiated,\u201d he said. His empire collapsed under a cascade of lawsuits filed by investors and creditors who had helped finance his endeavors. Mr. Pearlman fled the United States in 2007 after the federal authorities began an investigation. He was found in a hotel in Indonesia later that year using the alias A. Incognito Johnson. He pleaded guilty in 2008 to charges of conspiracy and money laundering in connection with a   Ponzi scheme that defrauded investors who had poured an estimated $300 million into a company that never actually existed. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison. In his 2014 interview with Billboard, Mr. Pearlman insisted that he could have paid back the people he defrauded if the federal authorities had only allowed him to start auditioning singers, even from behind bars. \u201cIf I was given a chance to put another band together, that would have paid everybody back. \u201d he said. Information on survivors was not immediately available. On social media, two former members of \u2018NSync, Lance Bass and Mr. Timberlake, expressed sorrow but also alluded to Mr. Pearlman\u2019s checkered past. \u201cHe might not have been a   businessman, but I wouldn\u2019t be doing what I love today\u201d without \u201chis influence,\u201d Mr. Bass tweeted on Saturday. \u201cRIP Lou. \u201d Mr. Timberlake wrote, \u201cI hope he found some peace. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628464.1561131}
