It\u2019s no coincidence that he was a KKK Grand Wizard you know!)\\nBut instead of owning up to their past misdeeds, Democrats peddle the fiction of a \u201creset\u201d that saw the racists in their party migrate to the GOP, allowing them to become a kinder, more tolerant organization. This narrative unravels, however, when one hears what one of the party\u2019s biggest donors had to say about African-Americans who don\u2019t vote the way he wants them to.\\nAs one of the biggest donors to the Democratic Party, Benjamin Barber was easily able to gain access to a fundraiser for the Clinton campaign.
