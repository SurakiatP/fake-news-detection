[Evans has expressed deep contempt for what he considers to be in the ignorant masses of Americans that voted Donald Trump into the White House. These are, however, the very masses that make up the core viewership of Marvel\u2019s superhero movies.  \u201cPeople were just so desperate to hear someone say that someone is to blame,\u201d Evans said in a recent interview with Esquire magazine. \u201cThey were just so happy to hear that someone was angry, hear someone say that Washington sucks. \u201d \u201cI feel rage,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel fury. It\u2019s unbelievable. \u201d \u201cThey just want something new without actually understanding,\u201d he continued. \u201cI mean, guys like Steve Bannon  \u2014   Steve Bannon!  \u2014   this man has no place in politics. \u201d Evans\u2019 trolling of Trump on Twitter seems more an obsession than a pastime, and the actor seems to blame the President for all of the country\u2019s woes. They did not die because of you. They died because of a hateful, ignorant, pathetic, EMBOLDENED piece of trash. https:  .   \u2014   Chris Evans (@ChrisEvans) May 29, 2017,  Unacceptable. This man disgusts me. If you dont think Trump has played a role in this unapologetic wave of ignorance and hate, you are WRONG https:  .   \u2014   Chris Evans (@ChrisEvans) May 15, 2017,  This administration LOVES to distract. This will only make it harder for women to stay healthy. Government $ can\u2019t be spent on abortions! https:  .   \u2014   Chris Evans (@ChrisEvans) April 14, 2017,  Of course, no one expects Hollywood actors to be intellectually sophisticated, but to have them try to infect Americans with their own ignorant bigotry is really a bridge too far. In large part, the bizarre rants the Marvel folks carry out on Twitter and elsewhere are abortion driven. Spitting in the face of their conservative fan base that is overwhelmingly   Whedon and Evans, along with other Marvel stars such as Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow) and Mark Ruffalo (Hulk) fawn over Planned Parenthood while painting abortion foes as backward and unenlightened. \u201cAs most of you know, Planned Parenthood has been under attack for many years now for another service they thankfully offer, providing a safe place for legal abortions,\u201d Johansson said during a Variety luncheon last year. \u201cA woman\u2019s right to choose what to do with her body shouldn\u2019t just be a woman\u2019s rights issue. It\u2019s the year 2016, and this is a human rights issue. \u201d Whedon recently went so far as to produce a short video panegyric to Planned Parenthood, calling America\u2019s largest abortion provider a \u201cbeacon of hope\u201d for the nation, while imagining how horrible life would be without Planned Parenthood to eliminate the unintended consequences of sexual libertinism. Why actors and filmmakers feel an irresistible urge to allow partisan politics to get in the way of their craft is a mystery, but whatever their motives such unrestraint often has consequences. It\u2019s only a matter of time before Marvel\u2019s fan base calls them out for their hypocrisy.     are not what patriots pay to see. Follow Thomas D.
