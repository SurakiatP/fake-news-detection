Trump, urging him to disclose details of his overseas business investments before Election Day. The letter  \u2014   signed by dozens of supporters of the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton  \u2014   was drafted as Mr. Trump, the Republican pick who is reported to have extensive overseas entanglements, has refused to release his tax returns. Michael J. Morell, a former acting director of the C. I. A. and Michael G. Vickers, a former under secretary of defense for intelligence, put together the letter with input from Samantha Vinograd, a former senior adviser to Thomas E. Donilon, a former national security adviser. \u201cDonald Trump still has not revealed to the American public his international business relationships, even as it becomes increasingly clear that his overseas ties could well constitute significant conflicts of interest when it comes to charting U. S. foreign policy,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cThis is unprecedented for a candidate for the nation\u2019s highest office. As such, we are calling on Mr. Trump to disclose, in full, the nature of his business relationships overseas  \u2014   to include specifically who his business partners are and what and where are his foreign investments. \u201d The signers  \u2014   who also include prominent Republicans such as Michael Chertoff, who led the Department of Homeland Security under President George W. Bush, and Paul D. Wolfowitz, Mr. Bush\u2019s deputy secretary of defense  \u2014   add that Mr. Trump should \u201cpledge that he will divest himself of his overseas business interests should he win the presidency. \u201d In a comment after this article was published, Jason Miller, a spokesman for Mr. Trump, singled out one of the letter\u2019s relatively   signers for criticism, without directly addressing the substance of the letter. \u201cIf Wendy Sherman is the definition of who is considered a reliable government official, this letter and its signatories lose all credibility,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cSherman was appointed to the State Department by Hillary Clinton during her disastrous tenure and was the lead negotiator in opening up Iran \u2014  the world\u2019s leading state sponsor of terrorism \u2014  for business, ultimately funding terrorist activities and exporting violence around the world. \u201d He added, \u201cBased on her complete failure in representing American foreign policy and deep ties to Secretary Clinton, this letter epitomizes the rigged system in Washington that has continued to fail Americans over and over again. \u201d Mrs. Clinton\u2019s husband, former President Bill Clinton, recently announced changes that would take place at the Clinton Foundation, which relies heavily on foreign donations, in an effort to eliminate the potential for the appearance of conflicts of interest if she becomes president. Those changes were announced after Mrs. Clinton faced intense scrutiny, including from Mr. Trump, over the foundation\u2019s foreign donations. Mr. Morell, a supporter of Mrs. Clinton who worked with her while she was secretary of state, said he and Mr. Vickers sought the letter after Newsweek reported that Mr. Trump has had business dealings with questionable figures in China, India and Russia, and claimed to have had negotiations with Col. Muammar   before he was toppled as the dictator of Libya. \u201cOn the campaign trail, Mr. Trump has repeatedly praised Vladimir Putin\u2019s authoritarian leadership, while outlining policies that read like a Kremlin wish list,\u201d the letter reads, referring to the president of Russia. \u201cHe has claimed that Putin would never invade Ukraine, suggested permanently ceding Crimea to Russia and placed conditions on upholding our obligation to protect our NATO allies,\u201d according to the letter. \u201cHe has floated lifting sanctions against Russia, which would benefit both Putin and the Trump Organization. \u201d The signers wrote that the next president would take office at a complicated moment globally, adding: \u201cOur policies must be motivated exclusively by what is in America\u2019s best interest, not by the financial interests of our president. The onus is on Donald Trump to assure voters that this will be the case by disclosing the nature of his overseas relationships and committing to divest such assets. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562447.709707}
