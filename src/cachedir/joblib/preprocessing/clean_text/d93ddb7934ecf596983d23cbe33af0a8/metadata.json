FBI Director James Comey\u2019s decision to reignite the controversy witch-hunt directed at Hillary Clinton and her private email server was an appalling show of partisan scheming by the FBI, and it\u2019s becoming clear that the entire agency is working to undermine the Democratic nominee in clear violation of the Hatch Act. \\nThe New York Times has revealed that the FBI\u2019s investigation of the Clinton Foundation was based on the rantings of a wingnut conspiracy theorist who wrote the an anti-Clinton propaganda tract. \\n\u201c\u2026had not developed much evidence and was based mostly on information that had surfaced in news stories and the book \u2018Clinton Cash,\u2019 according to several law enforcement officials briefed on the case.\u201d \\nClinton Cash, written by Peter Schweizer, has been best described as : \\n\u201ca trainwreck of sloppy research and shoddy reporting that contains over twenty errors, fabrications, and distortions. Schweizer pushes conspiracies \u201cbased on little evidence\u201d that are \u201cinconsistent with the facts\u201d and \u201cfalse\u201d; takes quotes \u201cbadly out of context\u201d; excludes exculpatory information that undermines his claims; and falls for a fake press release.\u201d \\nSchweizer rubs shoulders with other prominent wingnuts like Sarah Palin and Glenn Beck, another cog in the conservative agitation-propaganda machine. \\nHe is also the president of the Government Accountability Institute, an agitprop think tank run by \u2013 wait for it \u2013 ex-Breitbart CEO and current Trump campaign chair Steve Bannon. \\nThis morning, it was revealed that Donald Trump donated $1 million dollars to a Marine Corps veterans association run by the ex-assistant FBI director James Kallstrom. \\nThis afternoon, an FBI official spoke to the Guardian and said Clinton is \u201cthe antichrist personified to a large swath of FBI personnel,\u201d and that \u201cthe reason why they\u2019re leaking is they\u2019re pro-Trump.\u201d It is clear that there are a great many forces at work behind the scenes trying to destroy the United States as we know it \u2013 and Trump is the one with the nerve to claim \u201crigged election!\u201d Related Items:'"}, "time": 1742628494.6591337}
