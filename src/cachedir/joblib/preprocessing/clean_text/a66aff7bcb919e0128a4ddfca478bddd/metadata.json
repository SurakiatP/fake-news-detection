Unfortunately, the commentariat has taken far too much of this up, as in has featured links to dodgy stories and theories and has treated them with far more dignity than they warrant. \\nWe have shut down comments entirely when the quality has decayed too far or they have become too fractious. We hope not to have to do that, but in the last week alone, we\u2019ve had to rip out two entire comment threads, something we are extremely loath to do. That sort of thing should happen at most once a year, not with anything approaching this frequency. \\nThis site has policy impact. We have spent far too many years building that to put it at risk. We lose credibility with some of the discussions that have been taking place recently. Please use better discernment as to whether the topic you\u2019d like to chew over really belongs here, as opposed to Facebook or Zero Hedge. \\nAt Last, a Black History Museum New York Review of Books (Kevin C) \\nPlayboy model charged over locker room \u2018body-shaming\u2019 image BBC.
