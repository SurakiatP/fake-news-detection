Over sampling is happening somewhere. \\n\\nHere\u2019s the thing: Bernie voters and black Americans were already Democrats. (Even if she gets 100% of them (which she won\u2019t) she\u2019s not broadening her numbers beyond her own party . . . which is a mere 29% of the electorate.) \\nLet\u2019s recap: 29% of the country are Democrats, 29% are Republicans and 42% are Independents. See here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAopWX9Mzgs \\nWhoever wins Independents wins the election. \\nTrump is more than doubling Hillary\u2019s position with Independents. He\u2019s leading in the single largest voting bloc in the country . . . yet all the mainstream media propaganda polls are pretending like Hillary\u2019s ahead. \\n(Of course she isn\u2019t. She\u2019s been losing this entire cycle\u2013with the media grossly oversampling Democrats and undersampling Independents to create a synthetic paper advantage for her.) \\nBut things get worse for Hillary than the ass-kicking she\u2019s getting [as a Status Quo candidate] in a Change election, vis-a-vis Independents: For a Democrat to win a national election, they have to carry 92% of the black vote. Trump is now polling between 25-30% of the black vote. (Meaning that Hillary isn\u2019t even coming remotely close to the benchmark she\u2019d need to win.) \\nSo you have Hillary hemorrhaging African-Americans, Independents and blue collar workers. \\nYet every mainstream media poll is lying to you and telling you she\u2019s winning. \\nThe math doesn\u2019t work. \\n(Turn off the TV. They\u2019re lying to you.)'"}, "time": 1742564014.9269383}
