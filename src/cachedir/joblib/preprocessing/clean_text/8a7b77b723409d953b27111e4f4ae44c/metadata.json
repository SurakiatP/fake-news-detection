The man then helps her to make a step up onto the platform. \\nJust one step. \\nHere\u2019s the video: \\nLater that day, Hillary leaves Florida for another rally in Winston Salem, North Carolina. \\nWalking up a flight of 15 steps to board her campaign plane, while holding an umbrella in her left hand and clutching the handrail with her right, and \u201cmumbling to herself\u201d (according to Live Satellite News ), Hillary appears to be wobbly and unsteady.
