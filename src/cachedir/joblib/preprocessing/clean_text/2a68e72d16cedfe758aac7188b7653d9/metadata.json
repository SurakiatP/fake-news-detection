Rand Paul ( ) said President Donald Trump has been \u201cfed a bill of goods\u201d by House leadership on the proposed House Republican health care legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare.  Paul said, \u201cYou know, I think that he has been told things by House leadership that frankly just are not accurate. He\u2019s been told this is the only vehicle, and Paul Ryan\u2019s been saying it for weeks, \u2018it\u2019s a binary choice, you either take it, it\u2019s my way or the highway,\u2019 I think he\u2019s been fed a bill of goods on this thing, and I do believe that there\u2019s something that could pass, that actually would bring down insurance costs, but this bill doesn\u2019t do it. I\u2019ve fought against Obamacare for six years, I am a physician and I want to repeal it, but I don\u2019t want to repeal it and replace it with something that just as bad or doesn\u2019t work.
