The nerve of Assad, trying to defeat terrorists and maintain the sovereignty of his nation! \\nKirby did, at least, acknowledge the presence of al-Nusra, but only tepidly. \u201cWe recognize Al-Nusra as a spoiler, we have concerns about co-mingling, I\u2019ve talked about this ad nauseam,\u201d he said. \\nOf course, al-Nusra is more than just a mere \u201cspoiler,\u201d it is open terrorist organization that the United States armed, funded, and trained to act as a proxy force that is no ideologically (or even physically) different than ISIS, Ahrar al-Sham, or the \u201cmoderates\u201d of the Free Syrian Army. It is also an organization that the United States was supposed to separate from the groups of these shadowy \u201cmoderates\u201d we have heard so much about over the course of the last five years but who are apparently phantoms lurking about in the rafters of the Syrian theatre. \\nThe very fact that the United States blamed Russia (along with Assad) for the collapse of the ceasefire and argued that the U.S. was not supposed to separate the \u201cmoderates\u201d from the \u201cextremists\u201d until after seven days is thus an admission that, without the requirements of the ceasefire in place, the U.S. would never have separated them at all. But this was the crux of the U.S. position; essentially that it knew who the \u201cmoderate\u201d cannibals were and that they were different from the extremist cannibals. If that is the case, then wouldn\u2019t separating the two be the goal all along? Why did the United States need to be required by a ceasefire agreement (as a concession no less) to separate the two different elements of the \u201copposition\u201d if it was truly in support of defeating the \u201cextremists?\u201d \\nAs Joseph Thomas writes for New Eastern Outlook , \\nIt also appears to be no coincidence that this scenario now openly unfolding in Syria fulfils warnings published by Western journalists as early as 2007 ( Seymour Hersh, The Redirection ) in which it was revealed that the US was already at that time providing material support to extremist organisations \u201csympathetic to Al Qaeda\u201d toward the end goal of overthrowing the governments of both Iran and Syria. \\nWhile the US now claims Russia has sabotaged US efforts to bring an end to hostilities in Syria, Washington is also illogically attempting to argue that the failure of its feigned \u201cpeace talks\u201d has also somehow prevented the US from targeting terrorists organisations in Syria, the alleged pretext of America\u2019s presence in Syria to begin with. \\nDespite strained relations with Russia, the US is still cooperating with Moscow regarding the use of Syrian airspace to avoid unintentional confrontations. While the cessation of hostilities may have collapsed, is there really any excuse as to why separating designated terrorist organisations from militant groups the US and its allies are providing billions in weapons and equipment to is still not an absolute and urgent priority? \\nThe answer is, no \u2014 there is no excuse. Or perhaps it is more accurate to say, it is simply an excuse for the US to continue funnelling men and materiel into Syria Washington knows with absolute certainty will end up in the ranks of Al Qaeda, whom the US admittedly intended to use as early as 2007 to overthrow the Syrian government with. \\nAs a result, the State Department\u2019s ridiculous leveling of the blame for the failure of the ceasefire on Assad can be chalked up to yet another statement based in absolute falsehood and intentional deception. Indeed, this is the type of statement the U.S. State Department is becoming renowned for the world over, from blaming Russia for bombing a convoy even if it didn\u2019t bomb the convoy , claiming Russian aggression in Ukraine, asserting that Assad is \u201ckilling his own people,\u201d \u201cbarrel bombing civilians,\u201d and attacking hospitals, what little shred of credibility the State Department may have left outside of American borders is rapidly disappearing. \\nBrandon Turbeville \u2013 article archive here \u2013 is the author of seven books, Codex Alimentarius \u2014 The End of Health Freedom , 7 Real Conspiracies , Five Sense Solutions and Dispatches From a Dissident, volume 1 and volume 2 , The Road to Damascus: The Anglo-American Assault on Syria, and The Difference it Makes: 36 Reasons Why Hillary Clinton Should Never Be President .

He stated that, \u2018the \u201conly thing\u201d standing in the way of a \u201cpermanent ceasefire\u201d in Syria is the \u201cregime\u201d of Bashar al-Assad.\u2019 \\nYes, the well worn political science propaganda phrase, \u201cthe only thing standing in the way of a permanent ceasefire is \u2026\u201d has been used across the centuries to twist the truth in favor of the aggressor. Imagine England\u2019s King George III proclaiming this to the American colonists or the Nazi\u2019s dictating it to the French Maquis, or in more modern times, the Israelis persuading the Hamas resistance in Zionist occupied Palestine. \\n\u201cSurrender to U.S. hegemony and relinquish all sovereign rights to Syrian land and its natural resources so our corporations can exploit it,\u201d is what the stark message really means. \\nAt the end of the session, Kirby left the journalists dumbfounded with his favorite Furbish goodbye, \u201cu-nye-way-loh-nee-way\u201d which translates to, \u201cYou go sleep now\u201d. The whole world is in a slumber, insouciant to the ground swell of evil slime that flows out of the Potomac\u2019s foggy bottom to spread tyranny everywhere. madrino \\nMr. Swanson\u2019s research of America\u2019s history of coups, wars and similar acts identifies to me, not to expect change to come from the power structure that has been in place since the country\u2019s inception. Syria, Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan and countless others are under the boot of the war of terror. Those of us that want peace must wage peace since all other organizations that claim to be such have proven otherwise. Since the creation UN, the wealth gap between rich and poor nations has gotten much greater, and the movement of wealth within rich nations is concentrated at the top .01% as so aptly described by Carl Herman. Charles Hugh Smith has promoted ideas and solutions to change the current system of privlage of the few, to opportunities for all willing to put in the effort to succeed socially and economically. twinfishfour . \\nThe US has left Iraq and Libya in chaos, and it intends to leave Syria in chaos, with portions of the spoils promised to Israel and other portions promised to the Kurds. The chaos inflicted on Syria by US policy with help from the Saudis and others will not resolve immediately, but it will resolve a lot sooner if the US ceases to attempt regime change in Syria. Which is more \u201cconvert to failed state\u201d than regime change if you look at the pattern established in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya. Even Ukraine, in spite of the conversion of property and power to the Fortune 500 and crony capitalists from the west, is worse off than it was before US attempts (through proxies) at regime change. So, now, when it comes to foreign policy, if Uncle Sam\u2019s lips are moving, they are telling lies. Irony of ironies. skygroup \\nApply online in just minutes, with no impact to your credit score.
