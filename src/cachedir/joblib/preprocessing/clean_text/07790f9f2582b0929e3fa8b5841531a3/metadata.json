Mr. Scahill, a   and editor of the news site The Intercept,  announced his decision on Twitter only hours after Mr. Yiannopoulos\u2019s scheduled appearance was made public. Mr. Scahill said that allowing Mr. Yiannopoulos to appear on \u201cReal Time\u201d was \u201cmany bridges too far. \u201d \u201cHe has ample venues to spew his hateful diatribes,\u201d Mr. Scahill said in a statement. \u201cThere is no value in \u2018debating\u2019 him. Appearing on \u2018Real Time\u2019 will provide Yiannopoulos with a large, important platform to openly advocate his racist,   campaign. It will be exploited by Yiannopoulos in an attempt to legitimize his hateful agenda. \u201d But Mr. Maher defended his decision. \u201cMy comments on Islam have never veered into vitriol,\u201d he said. \u201cLiberals will continue to lose elections as long as they follow the example of people like Mr. Scahill whose views veer into fantasy and away from bedrock liberal principles like equality of women, respect for minorities, separation of religion and state, and free speech. If Mr. Yiannopoulos is indeed the monster Scahill claims  \u2014   and he might be  \u2014   nothing could serve the liberal cause better than having him exposed on Friday night. \u201d Mr. Yiannopoulos, an editor at Breitbart News, often engages in provocative displays to highlight what he considers the intolerance of the political left. At an appearance in December at the University of   he mocked a transgender student while displaying her photograph during his talk. This month, a planned appearance by Mr. Yiannopoulos at the University of California, Berkeley, was canceled when protests against the speech turned violent and led to rioting that caused around $100, 000 in damages. He had been invited to speak by the school\u2019s College Republicans group. In a Facebook video posted after the speech\u2019s cancellation, Mr. Yiannopoulos said that the \u201chard left\u201d was to blame, having \u201cbecome so utterly antithetical to free speech in the last few years. \u201d \u201cThey simply will not allow any speaker on campus, even somebody as silly and harmless and gay as me, to have their voice heard,\u201d he added. Other schools have withdrawn invitations to him in recent weeks. In January, a man was shot during protests outside a speech Mr. Yiannopoulos was giving at the University of Washington in Seattle. Last summer, Mr. Yiannopoulos was barred from Twitter after helping rally other users to direct racist and sexist remarks at Leslie Jones, a star of \u201cGhostbusters\u201d and \u201cSaturday Night Live. \u201d Mr. Maher, a comedian who is liberal on many issues  \u2014   he donated $1 million to a \u201csuper PAC\u201d supporting President Barack Obama\u2019s   in 2012  \u2014   features guests from across the political spectrum on \u201cReal Time. \u201d His show on Friday was set to include the comedian Larry Wilmore, the actress Leah Remini and former Representative Jack Kingston, Republican of Georgia.'"}, "time": 1742562095.4307191}
