[In fairness to the NFL, a bounce in ratings occurred after the election ended in early November. In fact, ratings of the \u201caverage game,\u201d as reported by Awful Announcing, increased by 14%. This represents the biggest   jump since 2007 when ratings showed a 9% increase after the election.  Those numbers look quite impressive. However, when you compare viewership numbers after this year\u2019s election against last year\u2019s 2015 NFL season numbers during the same period of time, per game viewership declined by approximately 4 percent from 19. 24 million viewers in 2015 to this year\u2019s 18. 43 million. Quick arithmetic calculates the NFL lost over 800, 000 viewers since last year during the same period. Many have speculated that Colin Kaepernick and others who kneeled during the national anthem may have contributed to the fans deciding to clean the garage or take the kids to the park rather than tune in to the game. According to a   poll, 29 percent of NFL fans turned their TVs off or watched something else during game time. Moreover, four out of ten of those tuning out blame Kaepernick\u2019s protests as the reason. In the final analysis, the elections had their effect on viewership, but not the impact the NFL would like to believe.'"}, "time": 1742563039.9275515}
