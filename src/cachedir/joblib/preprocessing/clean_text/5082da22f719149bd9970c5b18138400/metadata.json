Trump\u2019s stop in North Charleston was part of Boeing\u2019s rollout of the aerospace manufacturer\u2019s   aircraft. Transcript as follows: TRUMP: USA. AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! TRUMP: Thank you, Dennis (ph). And I have to say, I love South Carolina. I love it. (APPLAUSE) Remember we came down all together. We came down, and this was going to be a place that was tough to win, and we won in a landslide. This was a good one. (APPLAUSE) So I want to thank  \u2014   I want to thank the people of South Carolina. And your governor, tremendous guy. He supported us right from the beginning. So I\u2019d like to thank Governor McMaster for the incredible job, he\u2019s right here someplace. Thank you very much. You have been fantastic. And I have to say also, that is one beautiful airplane. (APPLAUSE) Congratulations to the men and women here who have built it. What an amazing piece of art. What an amazing piece of work. Thank you, Dennis (ph) for the invitation to be with you today. You know, the old days when I made this speech, I got paid a lot of money. Now I have to do it for nothing. (LAUGHTER) So, not a good deal, but that\u2019s OK, we love it. It\u2019s wonderful to be back in South Carolina, especially with your new governor. Where is Henry? He\u2019s around here someplace. Where is he? Stand up, Henry. Proud of you. He helped us so much. (APPLAUSE) And I want to also thank your former governor, Nikki Haley, who\u2019s doing an awfully good job for us. (APPLAUSE) She\u2019s representing America very well as our ambassador to the United Nations. She is doing a spectacular job. It\u2019s early, but she has just been really great. We\u2019re here today to celebrate American engineering and American manufacturing. We\u2019re also here today to celebrate jobs, jobs. (APPLAUSE) This plane, as you know, was built right here in the great state of South Carolina. Our goal as a nation must be to rely less on imports and more on products made here in the USA, right here in the USA. (APPLAUSE) It\u2019s amazing to think that a little over 113 years ago, next door in North Carolina, Orville Wright was the first man to sail the skies in a very little airplane. The 1903 Wright Flyer was made of mostly wood and cloth. It was so small that Orville\u2019s brother Wilbur could not join him on the flight. He was always very upset about that. The flight lasted all of 12 seconds, but it was incredible. That flight was a testament to the American spirit. I see that same spirit everywhere I travel in the country. I saw that spirit all throughout the campaign. We have the greatest people anywhere in the world. We have the greatest spirit, and you just look at what\u2019s going on today in our country, you look at what\u2019s happening with jobs, you look at what\u2019s happening with plants moving back into our country. TRUMP: All of a sudden, they\u2019re coming back and they\u2019re gonna be very happy about it, believe me. (APPLAUSE) They\u2019re gonna be very, very happy. As your president, I\u2019m going to do everything I can to unleash the power of the American spirit and to put our great people back to work. (APPLAUSE) This is our mantra, \u201cbuy American and hire American. \u201d We want products made in America, made by American hands. You probably saw the keystone pipeline I approved recently and the Dakota. And I\u2019m getting ready to sign the bill I said where is the pipe made? They told me, not here. I said, that\u2019s good, add little sentence that you have to buy American steel. And you know what? That\u2019s the way it is. (APPLAUSE) That\u2019s the way it is going to be. We are going to fight for every last American job. We\u2019ve come a long way since the Wright brothers and their first flight more than a century ago. Your plane is made of carbon fiber. It seats 330 passengers. Its 18 feet longer than the previous version of the 787, and this airplane can fly for half away before it touches the ground. The name says it all \u201cDreamliner,\u201d great name. Our country is all about making dreams come true. Over the last number of years, that hasn\u2019t been necessarily the case, but we\u2019re going to make it the case again. (APPLAUSE) That\u2019s what we do in America. We dream of things and then we build them. We turned vision into reality, and we will be doing a lot more of that believe me, in the months and years to come. (APPLAUSE) I also want to say a word to all of the members of the armed forces who are here with us today in this record crowd. (APPLAUSE) South Carolina has a long, very, very proud military tradition and history. We salute all South Carolina military families, and we salute all of the men and women who wear the uniform. (APPLAUSE) We are going to fully rebuild our military  \u2014   by the way, do you care if we use the   Super Hornet or do you only care about  \u2014   what do you think? (APPLAUSE) Well  \u2014   I thought that was Super Hornet. We are looking seriously at big order, and we will see how that  \u2014   you know, the problem is that Dennis is a very, very tough negotiator. But I think we may get there. We\u2019re also working on the Air Force One project which was a difficult project for previous administrations, but it looks like we are getting closer and closer. And we\u2019re going to ensure  \u2026     (APPLAUSE)   \u2026     that our great service members have the tools, equipment, training, and resources they need to get the job done. (APPLAUSE) As George Washington said, \u201cbeing prepared for war is the best way to prevent it. \u201d And that\u2019s really what it is. The best way to prevent war, being prepared. Peace through strength. We build a military might so great, and we are going to do that, that none will dare to challenge it, none. (APPLAUSE) We will ensure our men and women in uniform have the latest, the most cutting edge systems in their arsenal. Right now, it\u2019s not that way. It will be that way very, very soon, believe me. You will be an important player in this effort. TRUMP: Boeing has built many important aircraft including, as I said, the   Super Hornet, the   Strike Eagle, and the Apache helicopter, just to name a few. (APPLAUSE) And I am being very, very serious, the new Air Force One, that plane, as beautiful as it looks is 30 years old. Can you believe it? What can look so beautiful at 30? An airplane. (LAUGHTER) I don\u2019t know. Which one do we like better, folks, tell me. AUDIENCE: ( ) TRUMP: On every front, we are going to work for the American people. No where in our focus is  \u2014   and I mean this so strongly, and our focus has to be so strong, but my focus has been all about jobs, and jobs is one of the primary reasons I am standing here today as your president. And I will never, ever disappoint you, believe me. I will not disappoint you. (APPLAUSE) I campaigned on the promise that I will do everything in my power to bring those jobs back into America. We wanted to make much easier  \u2014   it has to be much easier to manufacture in our country and much harder to leave. I don\u2019t want companies leaving our country. Making their product, selling it back, no tax, no nothing, firing everybody in our country. We\u2019re not letting that happen anymore, folks, believe me. There will be a very substantial penalty to be paid when they fire their people and move to another country, make the product and think they are going to sell it back over what will soon be a very, very strong border. It\u2019s going to be a lot different. It\u2019s going to be a lot different. (APPLAUSE) Already, American industry is roaring back. And believe me, if we  \u2014   not me, I\u2019m a messenger  \u2014   if we didn\u2019t have this victory, we wouldn\u2019t even be talking about it. To achieve that goal, we are going to massively reduce job crushing regulations  \u2014   already started you\u2019ve seen that  \u2014   that sent our jobs to those other countries. We are going to lower taxes on American business so it\u2019s cheaper and easier to produce product and beautiful things like airplanes right here in America. (APPLAUSE) We are going to enforce, very strongly, enforce our trade rules and stop foreign cheating  \u2014   tremendous cheating, tremendous cheating. We want products made by our workers, in our factories, stamped with those four magnificent words, made in the USA. (APPLAUSE) AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! TRUMP: Since November, jobs have already begun to surge. We\u2019re seeing companies open up factories in America. We\u2019re seeing them keep jobs at home. Ford, General Motors, Fiat Chrysler, just to name a very, very few, so many more already. They are keeping and bringing thousands of jobs in our country because the business climate they know, has already changed. In Arizona, Intel announced it will open a new plant that will create 10, 000 American jobs. They\u2019re spending billions of dollars. (APPLAUSE) We will see more and more of that across the country as we continue to work on reducing regulations, cutting taxes, including for the middle class, including for everyone and including for business, and creating a level playing field for our workers. When there is a level playing field  \u2014   and I\u2019ve been saying this for a long time  \u2014   American workers will always, always, always win. But we don\u2019t have a level playing field. Very shortly, you will have a level playing field again. (APPLAUSE) Because when American workers win, America as a country wins big league, wins. That\u2019s my message here today. America is going to start winning again, winning like never, ever before. We\u2019re not going to let our country be taken advantage of anymore, in any way, shape, or form. We love America and we are going to protect America. We love our workers, and we are going to protect our workers. We are going to fight for our jobs, we are going to fight for our families and we are going to fight to get more jobs and better paying jobs for the loyal citizens of our country. Believe me. (APPLAUSE) You have heard me say it before and I will say it again. From now on, it\u2019s going to be America first. (APPLAUSE) Working together as a unit, there is nothing we cannot accomplish, no task too large, no dream too great, no goal beyond our reach. Just like you built this incredible airplane behind me, both of them when you think about it, we are going to rebuild this country and ensure that every forgotten community has the bright future it deserves. And by the way, those communities are forgotten no longer. The election took care of that. (APPLAUSE) And we will pass onto our children the freedom and prosperity that is their American birthright. Our children will inherit from us a nation that is strong, that is proud and that is totally free. And each of you will be part of creating that new American future. I want to thank you, South Carolina. I want to thank the great people of South Carolina. God bless you. May God bless the United States of America and God bless Boeing. (APPLAUSE) Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor'"}, "time": 1742563225.0902805}
