A prolific writer and chronic oversharer, she published several heavily autobiographical novels, including the best seller \u201cPostcards From the Edge,\u201d which drew on her struggles with drug abuse and mental illness, and three memoirs that recounted her experiences growing up in the shadow of Hollywood royalty, her affair with Harrison Ford while shooting the \u201cStar Wars\u201d films, and her   battle with bipolar disorder. One of her final creative acts was publishing her memoir \u201cThe Princess Diarist,\u201d which came out last month. Ms. Fisher\u2019s literary legacy seemed to offer some solace to fans mourning her death this week, at age 60. \u201cThe Princess Diarist,\u201d which drew on the diaries Ms. Fisher wrote when she was a    actress on the cusp of fame for playing Princess Leia, rose to the top of Amazon\u2019s   list, and was listed as temporarily out of stock on Thursday. Blue Rider Press, which published the book, plans to reprint 65, 000 copies, in addition to the 173, 000 copies already in circulation. \u201cPostcards From the Edge\u201d and \u201cWishful Drinking\u201d also rose to the top 10 on Amazon and were out of stock. Simon  Schuster, which published those books, is reprinting another 20, 000 copies of \u201cWishful Drinking\u201d and 17, 500 copies of \u201cPostcards From the Edge. \u201d Over all, Simon  Schuster has sold some 500, 000 copies of Ms. Fisher\u2019s books. Readers also turned to \u201cUnsinkable,\u201d a 2013 memoir published by Ms. Fisher\u2019s mother, the actress Debbie Reynolds, who died at age 84 on Wednesday, one day after her daughter. (\u201cUnsinkable\u201d rose to No. 395 on Amazon on Thursday, from 24, 172.) Following Ms. Fisher\u2019s death on Tuesday, some novelists praised her prose as being as blunt, funny and honest  \u2014   much like Ms. Fisher. \u201cFisher\u2019s legacy includes her written words  \u2014   cutting, clever, observant,   and unbowed,\u201d the science fiction writer John Scalzi wrote in The Los Angeles Times.'"}, "time": 1742562171.457783}
