[The organisation made the claim on the BBC Sport Facebook page, over the news that the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) had changed a ruling that did not allow female basketball players to wear the hijab during matches, on the grounds that it was a safety issue.  However, the claim was poorly received by the page\u2019s followers, who contended the decision is, in fact, a step backwards rather than forwards. \u201cIn what way is this a big step forward? The hijab is an oppressive garment for men to control their wives. But yeah, if it makes the beeb feel more virtuous then let\u2019s pretend it\u2019s progressive,\u201d user Nathaniel Shelley wrote. Another user, Codey Sharp, wrote: \u201cThis is a step backwards, allowing women to be oppressed even whilst playing sport, marvellous. \u201d In 2014, the Qatari women\u2019s team were forced to withdraw from the Asian Games after being denied permission to wear the garment during matches. Last month, the BBC lauded an Australian photographer\u2019s response to what he called a \u201ctragic\u201d rise in \u201c  sentiment\u201d in his homeland by taking the   piece of Islamic female clothing known as the burqa and using it as an art prop, describing it as \u201ccritique of the rising far right and Islamophobia\u201d. BBC Radio host Roger Bolton recently described the organisation\u2019s coverage of religion as a \u201cmess\u201d because its young metropolitan liberal staff are \u201cdangerously   \u201d.
