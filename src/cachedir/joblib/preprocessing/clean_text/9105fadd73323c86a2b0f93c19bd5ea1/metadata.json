The operator, \u201cJohn,\u201d asked if I would be interested in attending the 15th World Cardiology and Angiology Conference in Philadelphia next month. \u201cDo I have to be a doctor?\u201d I said, because I\u2019m not one. I got the call because 20 minutes earlier I had entered my phone number into a website run by a Hyderabad, India, company called OMICS International. \u201cYou can have the student rate,\u201d the man replied. With a 20 percent discount, it would be $599. The conference was in just a few weeks, I pointed out  \u2014   would that be enough time for the academic paper I would be submitting to be properly reviewed? (Again, I know nothing about cardiology.) It would be approved on an \u201cexpedited basis\u201d within 24 hours, he replied, and he asked which credit card I would like to use. If it seems that I was about to be taken, that\u2019s because I was. OMICS International is a leader in the growing business of academic publication fraud. It has created scores of \u201cjournals\u201d that mimic the look and feel of traditional scholarly publications, but without the integrity. This year the Federal Trade Commission formally charged OMICS with \u201cdeceiving academics and researchers about the nature of its publications and hiding publication fees ranging from hundreds to thousands of dollars. \u201d OMICS is also in the less   business of what might be called conference fraud, which is what led to the call from John. Both schemes exploit a fundamental weakness of modern higher education: Academics need to publish in order to advance professionally, get better jobs or secure tenure. Even within the halls of respectable academia, the difference between legitimate and fake publications and conferences is far blurrier than scholars would like to admit. OMICS is on the far end of the \u201cdefinitely fake\u201d spectrum. Real academic conferences evaluate potential participants by subjecting proposed papers and presentations to a rigorous   process. Some 15, 000 people attend the American Educational Research Association\u2019s annual conference, for example, and only about a third of submitted proposals are accepted. In October, a New Zealand college professor submitted a paper to the   \u201cInternational Conference on Atomic and Nuclear Physics,\u201d which was held last month at the Hilton Atlanta Airport. It was written using the autocomplete feature on his iPhone, which produced an abstract that begins as follows: \u201cAtomic Physics and I shall not have the same problem with a separate section for a very long long way. Nuclear weapons will not have to come out the same day after a long time of the year he added the two sides will have the two leaders to take the same way to bring up to their long ways of the same as they will have been a good place for a good time at home the united front and she is a great place for a good time. \u201d The paper was accepted within three hours. An OMICS employee who identified himself as Sam Dsouza said conference papers are reviewed by its \u201cexperts\u201d within 24 hours of submission. He couldn\u2019t provide a list of its reviewers or their credentials. Having dispensed with academic standards, OMICS makes money on volume. Its conferenceseries. com website lists hundreds of   academic meetings, many at vacation destinations like Las Vegas and Orlando, Fla. On Dec. 1 and 2, the \u201c2nd International Congress on Neuroimmunology and Therapeutics,\u201d the \u201c13th International Conference on Vaccines, Therapeutics and Travel Medicine: Influenza and Infectious Diseases,\u201d and the \u201cInternational Conference on Clinical and Medical Genetics\u201d were all held, simultaneously, at the Hilton Atlanta Airport. Stacking multiple fake conferences at the same hotel is a common practice, says Jeffrey Beall, a tenured University of Colorado Denver librarian. He maintains a website for identifying \u201cpredatory open access scholarly publishers\u201d that masquerade as scholarly journals, but are actually in the business of pumping out worthless articles and exploiting scholars with hidden fees. \u201cYou just rent a hotel, make up a name and stand around while everyone is reading their papers,\u201d Mr. Beall says. \u201cIt\u2019s easy money. \u201d Mr. Beall\u2019s list, which has grown to 923 publishers from 18 in 2011, also includes a British company called the \u201cInfonomics Society. \u201d Like OMICS, it publishes a raft of journals, 17 in all, with legitimately   titles like \u201cInternational Journal of Sustainable Energy Development. \u201d Mr. Beall calls Infonomics an \u201cimpostor scholarly society\u201d that is \u201cdesigned to generate as much revenue as possible. \u201d All 17 journals are run by a single person named Charles Shoniregun out of a modest   attached brick home in the outer suburbs of London. Infonomics also sponsors a series of conferences. But when I looked into one of them, the \u201cWorld Conference on Special Needs Education,\u201d or W. C. S. N. E. the story was more complex than I expected. Like many predatory publishers, the Infonomics website for W. C. S. N. E. has a certain        quality familiar to anyone who reads the spam folder in their email. \u201cThe Infonomics Society has an established reputation for promoting research esteem that is valued by research community,\u201d it says. The W. C. S. N. E. is attended by \u201cPolicy Makers and Stakeholders who care deeply about bringing creative, innovative and rigorous learning practices barriers. \u201d The W. C. S. N. E. paper submissions guidelines warn that all papers must be strictly limited to \u201ca total of 4 to 6 pages. \u201d That includes all figures, tables and references. Robert Kelchen, a professor of higher education at Seton Hall, says that this is \u201ca red flag. \u201d Education research papers are typically much longer, he notes  \u2014   the tables and reference pages alone can run to double digits. But short papers are easier to pack into a single \u201cjournal. \u201d The website included a long list of \u201cProgram Committee members\u201d with impressive academic credentials, as well as \u201cKeynote Speakers\u201d for the coming conference, scheduled to be held in August at Temple University, the W. C. S. N. E. host for the last three years. But when I contacted those identified as committee members and speakers, many immediately replied that they had no idea they were on the website and had no affiliation with the W. C. S. N. E. The announced keynote speakers told me they were nothing of the kind. Within 24 hours of my inquiries, someone removed their names and biographies from the site and replaced them with a page that said \u201cKeynote Speakers to be Announced!\u201d A spokesman for Temple, Hillel Hoffmann, said the university condemned \u201cpredatory   publishing\u201d and said no university money had been spent on the conference. He said that   learners in the community, including adult literacy students, had attended parts of the conference and had benefited from it, but that none had paid to participate. He added that the W. C. S. N. E. would no longer take place at Temple. Richard Cooper, the director of disability services at Harcum College, a private   institution in Philadelphia, helped create W. C. S. N. E. along with Mr. Shoniregun. He says he has no involvement with the paper selection process or financial aspects of the conference, simply serving as an organizer, presenter and master of ceremonies. He described it as a worthwhile gathering of scholars, many of whom live in Africa and India and pay hundreds of dollars in conference fees to attend. The papers presented at previous W. C. S. N. E. conferences don\u2019t appear to have been composed using the autocomplete function on an iPhone. They mostly describe small qualitative studies and surveys that examine   ideas, break little new ground and use statistical jargon to make their findings seem more complicated than they really are. They very likely would be rejected by the American Educational Research Association. But they are also well within the bounds of what gets published in many scholarly journals that, while not prestigious, have never been called a fraud. Barba Patton, an education professor at the University of   in Victoria, Tex. defended the W. C. S. N. E. unreservedly. \u201cI have attended ten to fifteen of the conferences in the U. S. Canada and in Europe,\u201d she wrote via email. \u201cI have no concerns about the website. You must remember that the conference reaches many who are using the British English rather than the American. \u201d Mr. Shoniregun did not respond to messages sent to his several email addresses. But he appears to have created a kind of hybrid conference that combines the shady,   internet marketing practices of OMICS with the more quotidian inattention to academic rigor that characterizes much of legitimate academia. Take the Society for Social Studies of Science (4S) by all accounts a legitimate organization. This year, Peter Dreier, chair of the Urban and Environmental Policy department at Occidental College, described how he submitted a proposal full of jargon, misquotation, non sequitur and general academic gobbledygook to an international conference sponsored by the 4S. It was accepted. \u201cI look forward to meeting you in Tokyo,\u201d the panel organizer wrote. Lucy Suchman, a sociologist at Britain\u2019s Lancaster University and the president of 4S, acknowledges that the abstract review process is \u201cnot perfect\u201d and that she would have rejected Mr. Dreier\u2019s submission. But, she notes, 4S reviews hundreds of submissions every year with an \u201cassumption of good faith. \u201d It would not have occurred to them that someone of Mr. Dreier\u2019s standing in academia was engaged in such an \u201cunfortunate prank,\u201d she said, emphasizing the overall high quality of 4S presentations. There are real, prestigious journals and conferences in higher education that enforce and defend the highest standards of scholarship. But there are also many more Ph. D.  than there is space in those publications, and those people are all in different ways subject to the \u201cpublish or perish\u201d system of professional advancement. The academic    system is subject to no real outside oversight. Standards are whatever the scholars involved say they are. So it\u2019s not surprising that some academics have chosen to give one another permission to accumulate publication credits on their C. V.\u2019s and spend some of the departmental travel budget on short holidays. Nor is it surprising that some canny operators have now realized that when standards are loose to begin with, there are healthy profits to be made in the gray areas of academe.'"}, "time": 1742562277.666803}
