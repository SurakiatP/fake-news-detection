Moreover, in the same article, she praises Colin Kaepernick for being \u201celoquent\u201d in his criticism of law enforcement in America. [The San Francisco 49ers quarterback, who refused to stand for the Star Spangled Banner this season and wore socks with pigs dressed in police uniforms, is \u201celoquent in detailing his concerns over police brutality in minority communities. He\u2019s sparked conversations and reflection in NFL locker rooms and beyond,\u201d states Armour. \u201cKaepernick has been open, available and consistent with his opinion. \u201d   As she trashes the 45th president of the United States, Armour seems surprised when Kaepernick is \u201cportrayed as     and  . \u201d The writer empathizes with the beleaguered QB because after all, he denies those charges. \u201cHe\u2019s had insults, slurs and worse directed at him. He was blamed for the drop in TV ratings early in the season,\u201d Armour laments. And to the author, perhaps the worst insult you could possibly levy on Kaepernick is that \u201cOne person last week even tried to say Trump\u2019s election was partly the result of Kaepernick\u2019s protests. \u201d Of course, as far as Brady is concerned he deserves some tough questioning for his friendship with the president. \u201cTrump\u2019s campaign was steeped in racism, bigotry, and misogyny, and he has doubled down on his hatred in his first week as president. It\u2019s left Americans across the country angry and frightened, fearful that the ideals that have made this country exceptional for more than 200 years are being abandoned,\u201d Armour opines.  Brady describes his relationship with Trump as a long time friendship. He also had the audacity to have a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat in his locker. For Armour that makes the Patriot\u2019s star in support of racism and misogyny, that is unless he can unfriend Trump, Armour leads us to believe.  But, Brady said about the president that, \u201cif you know someone, it doesn\u2019t mean that you agree with everything that they say or do. Right?\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s things I don\u2019t believe [in] absolutely. I don\u2019t believe in, you know, there\u2019s a lot of things,\u201d Brady continued. \u201cNot to denounce anything, it\u2019s just that there are different things that I feel like, you know   \u2026     I don\u2019t agree with everything. That\u2019s fine, right?\u201d Nope. That\u2019s not good enough for Armour. Brady must be interrogated this week about Trump. And if he doesn\u2019t know how to open himself to the media then all he needs to do is call on Colin. Because, \u201cIf Brady needs an example of how that\u2019s done, he can look at Kaepernick,\u201d Armour informs us. '"}, "time": 1742564475.6058314}
