Share on Twitter Print This Post \\nIt was a standard day in the life of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, as the Republican nominee spent much of his time on the campaign trail Thursday making outrageous and insulting comments. \\nThis was on clear display at a rally in Toledo, Ohio, when Trump proposed one of his most ridiculous ideas yet: Cancel the election and just anoint him president. \\nVideo: Trump jokes: \u201cWe should just cancel the election and just give it to Trump, right? What are we even having it for? Her policies are so bad!\u201d pic.twitter.com/Stz46iDbpf \\n\u2014 Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) October 27, 2016 \\n\u201cI\u2019m just thinking to myself right now, we should just cancel the election and just give it to Trump, right?\u201d Trump asked the crowd. \u201cWhat are we even having it for? \u2026 Her policies are so bad.\u201d \\nDespite Trump\u2019s plea to cancel the election as he continues to struggle in the polls, it will be the voters who decide which candidate has the better policies \u2013 thankfully. \\nThe remark also aligns closely with other recent comments in which Trump claimed the process is rigged against him, and he will only accept the outcome of the election if it\u2019s favorable for him. \\nBut Trump wasn\u2019t done at his Buckeye State rally. He also made sure to take a dig at minority communities. \\nVideo: Help me out there. Did Trump just say \u201cwe\u2019re going to work on our ghettos\u201d before mentioning inner cities, violence and African Americans? pic.twitter.com/v9KqZSLbh6 \\n\u2014 Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) October 27, 2016 \\nTrump\u2019s comments: \\nWe\u2019re gonna work on our ghettos \u2026 take a look at what\u2019s going on where you have pockets of, areas of land, where you have the inner cities, and you have so many things, so many problems, so many horrible, horrible problems \u2013 the violence, the death, the lack of education, no jobs. We\u2019re gonna work with the African-American community and we\u2019re going to solve the problem of the inner city \u2026 You can\u2019t walk out the street. You buy a loaf of bread and you end up getting shot. \\nThe Republican nominee\u2019s \u201cghetto\u201d comment is the newest addition to what is the standard Trump narrative that black communities are hellscapes. This particular set of remarks comes a day after he visited North Carolina for a rally and told supporters \u2013 mostly white \u2013 that he would enact \u201ca new deal for black America.\u201d \\nIn the closing days of this election, Donald Trump is once again showing that there is no better version of who he is. The man who built a campaign on racial resentment is doubling down on it as this election season comes to a conclusion.\""}, "time": 1742562860.2470486}
