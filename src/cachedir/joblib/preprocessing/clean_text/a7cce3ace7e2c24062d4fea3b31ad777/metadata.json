Some of the musicians at Talladega College have been excited to see the capital for the first time. But because the   is Donald J. Trump, the school has become the subject of an impassioned national outcry, with online petitions, threats to end donations and a flurry of    from alumni who feel that performing in the parade would betray the values of an institution founded by newly freed slaves 150 years ago. On Thursday, after days of speculation that the college administration might bow to the pressure and remove the band from the parade roster, the president of Talladega College, Billy Hawkins, issued a statement confirming the participation of the band, the Marching Tornadoes, and argued, in essence, that the 58th presidential inauguration is about something bigger than Mr. Trump. \u201cWe respect and appreciate how our students and alumni feel about our participation in this parade,\u201d Dr. Hawkins said. \u201cAs many of those who chose to participate in the parade have said, we feel the inauguration of a new president is not a political event but a civil ceremony celebrating the transfer of power. \u201d Similar issues have been raised about other entertainers scheduled to perform, among them the Radio City Rockettes and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. But because of Talladega\u2019s history, the issues have been especially intense here, with calls for the college to reverse its decision to take part in the festivities. And beyond Talladega, the controversies raise tough questions for Mr. Trump\u2019s most ardent critics as his presidency dawns: What is the proper response to a president as polarizing as Mr. Trump? Should the office of the president be honored, no matter who fills it? Or should there be four years of pure rejection and defiance? And if Mr. Trump\u2019s opponents refuse to participate in his presidency, can critics on the right do the same thing to some other   in the future? To a number of Talladega alumni, the Dec. 30 announcement that the band would march in the parade was an insult to the very principles of the college, which was established two years after the end of the Civil War. The school is affiliated with the United Church of Christ, a liberal Protestant denomination that was deeply involved in the civil rights movement, and for decades it served as an incubator for theories and practices of social justice. Nikky Finney, a poet and Talladega graduate who is now a professor at the University of South Carolina, said in a statement this week that the band should not help celebrate Mr. Trump, who, she said, has maligned women and Mexican immigrants and has proposed barring all Muslims from entering the country. In an interview on Thursday, Ms. Finney, channeling a James Brown lyric, said the college had \u201csold out the history of Talladega College for chicken change\u201d and \u201cmaybe a tin star on a hatemonger\u2019s parade route. \u201d As of Thursday afternoon, an online petition calling for the band to withdraw from the inaugural parade had attracted more than 1, 900 signers, some of them supporters of the college who have threatened to withhold future contributions. But a second petition, which had nearly 300 supporters, argued that the parade was not about politics but \u201cabout seeing firsthand the process of a transition\u201d and giving the students a chance to be a part of history. \u201cWe are not   thinkers and believe everyone is entitled\u201d to their own beliefs, it stated. \u201cHowever, we are in support of the United States of America. \u201d As the debate heated up this week in online forums for students and alumni, the leadership at the private,   college hunkered down to consider how best to proceed. The campus police ordered reporters off the   campus. Brief interviews with a few band members on Tuesday evening revealed a group divided. Jerome Haynes, 18, a freshman who plays the snare drum, said he hoped politics would not get in the way of an exciting opportunity for the band. In contrast, Ronald Peterson, 21, a sophomore who plays cymbals, said he was going to talk to the director about staying home. \u201cI feel that those who are not Republicans should not have to play for it,\u201d he said. On Thursday afternoon, some students said the administration had done the right thing, despite the protests from alumni. Antonio Phillips, 24, a senior and a drum major, welcomed the exposure. \u201cWe\u2019re musicians, so this is a good platform for us to showcase our talent in front of the world,\u201d he said. His friend Ken Randolph, 20, a junior who is not in the band, said the concerns of alumni like Ms. Finney \u201cweigh heavily on the students of Talladega. \u201d But he said Mr. Trump might benefit from the exposure to a black art form. \u201cThis is a part of our culture,\u201d Mr. Randolph said. \u201cWith it being on his front doorstep, he might be able to apprehend the vibe and the culture. \u201d That drama in Talladega, a city of 15, 000 about an hour\u2019s drive east of Birmingham, played out as black activists, including the N. A. A. C. P. president, Cornell William Brooks, were arrested on Tuesday in Mobile in a   action at the office of Senator Jeff Sessions, the Alabama Republican nominated to be attorney general in the Trump administration. Mr. Sessions, who is white, was rejected by the Senate for a federal judgeship in 1986 after he was accused of making racially insensitive statements. To some Talladega alumni, the possibility that policies long opposed by   could now be enacted by a   Congress and executive branch was what made the notion of a black band marching for Mr. Trump seem so distasteful. \u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of fear in this country that the Voting Rights Act is going to be abolished, that the Affordable Care Act is going to be abolished, that Planned Parenthood is going to be cut off from funding, that Medicaid is going be cut off from funding,\u201d said J. Mason Davis, a Birmingham lawyer who graduated from the college in 1956. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand why we have a fear of the man?\u201d Donavon Jackson, 24, a former trumpet player in the band who graduated last year, said performing as part of the inauguration would be particularly special for a college of about 1, 000 students whose band program is only about five years old. The school does not have a football team, which makes parade invitations all the more important. \u201cI\u2019m honored to go to a school that can say they marched in an inauguration parade,\u201d said Mr. Jackson, who received a chemistry degree and now lives in Houston. \u201cNot necessarily for the person  \u2014   and that\u2019s not necessarily saying he\u2019s a bad person. \u201d In the statement on Thursday, school officials said they still faced the \u201cchallenge\u201d of raising more than $60, 000 to cover expenses for the trip. The population of the city of Talladega is divided about evenly between blacks and whites, and to a visitor, it can feel like a place where racial harmony and discord coexist on seemingly parallel planes. Whites speak with pride about the historic black college downtown  \u2014   though one white person was overheard on Wednesday warning of a liberal plot to foment a \u201crace war\u201d so that President Obama might declare martial law before the inauguration. While some residents said the band should stay home, and others said it should attend the event in Washington, a few spoke harshly of Mr. Trump while hoping the inauguration would help the band get noticed  \u2014   something the city, which was bypassed by the interstate highway system, has struggled with in recent decades. Bonquita McClellan, 26, manages her father\u2019s restaurant, Big Mac\u2019s Open Pit BBQ, near campus. Ms. McClellan, who is black, said the disdain for Mr. Trump among her   peers was universal. \u201cIf anybody would have had us in concentration camps,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019d be him. \u201d But she also said the band should go and make a name for itself in the nation\u2019s capital. \u201cHow often,\u201d she asked, \u201cdoes Talladega College get a chance to play for the president?\u201d Up the street at a real estate office near the   courthouse, Randy and Heather Roberts, a white couple who voted for Mr. Trump, raved about the Talladega College band and its performance at the Dec. 5 Christmas parade. Ms. Roberts showed a video of the band on her phone. \u201cThey were phenomenal,\u201d Ms. Roberts said. Ms. Roberts, 41, said she grew up with black and white friends. Mr. Roberts, 48, said he and his wife were pleased to cater to their multiracial clientele. But when they spoke about politics, the couple sounded like people who knew something was broken but did not know how it might be fixed. \u201cIt is not going to be pleasant for the next four years,\u201d Ms. Roberts said. \u201cIt is going to be a battle. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561950.985808}
