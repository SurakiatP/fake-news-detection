[But he backed calls for an independent inquiry into a suspected chemical weapons attack on a   town in northwestern Syria on Tuesday that Trump blamed on the Damascus regime.  \u201cThis man who is now in office in America claimed that he wanted to fight terrorism but today all terrorists in Syria are celebrating the US attack,\u201d Rouhani said in a speech aired by state television. \u201cWhy have you attacked the Syrian army which is at war with terrorists? Under what law or authority did you launch your missiles at this independent country?\u201d Iran and Russia are the closest allies of Syrian President Bashar Assad. They have provided him with military support not only against jihadists like the Islamic State group and former   affiliate Fateh   Front that are targeted by a   coalition but also against other rebels they deem \u201cterrorists\u201d too. Both governments have defended their Damascus ally against Western allegations that it carried out a chemical weapons attack on the   town of Khan Sheikhoun on Tuesday, killing dozens of civilians. Rouhani called for \u201can independent commission\u201d by \u201cimpartial countries\u201d into the claims. \u201cAccording to the United Nations, the Syrian government does not possess chemical weapons,\u201d he said. Rouhani was referring to the   destruction of the Damascus regime\u2019s chemical arsenal under a 2013 agreement between Washington and Moscow. On Friday, hours after the US missile strike, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said the Western allegations were \u201cbogus. \u201d He likened them to the claims that Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime had weapons of mass destruction which premised the   invasion of Iraq in 2003 but which later turned out to be baseless.'"}, "time": 1742628447.8253863}
