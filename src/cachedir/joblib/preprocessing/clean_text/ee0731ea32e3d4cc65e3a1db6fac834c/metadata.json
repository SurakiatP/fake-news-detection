[Redacted due to information \u201ckept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy;\u201d \u201cforeign relations or foreign activities of the US, including confidential sources\u201d] \\nFrom: Huma Abedin [Huma@clintonemail.com] \\nSent: Monday, October 26, 2009 8:06:12 AM \\nTo: humaabedin [Redacted] \\nSubject: Fw: Honduras \\nThe emails also include an exchange between Abedin, Clinton personal assistant Lauren Jiloty, and Iris Anaya, the assistant to sugar magnate and Clinton Foundation donor Alfonso Fanjul concerning a request for special access to Clinton. On October 13, 2009, Anaya emailed Abedin seeking to arrange a meeting between Fanjul, the CEO of Florida Crystals, and Clinton. Jiloty responded the next day, asking that Anaya talk with Clinton scheduler Lona Valmoro about \u201csetting up a meeting.\u201d Fanjul donated more than $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation and was a Bill Clinton co-chairman in Florida. \\nIn an October 26, 2009, email exchange, power attorney and Hillary Clinton financial supporter, Charlie Ann Syprett, contacted Doug Band, apparently seeking help in getting around U.S. Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) restrictions on U.S. citizens\u2019 ability to travel to Cuba. Syprett ostensibly wanted a waiver from the restrictions to enable people from her organization, SYC Charitable Foundation, to travel to Cuba, noting \u201cwe are not asking for something out of the ordinary.\u201d \\nThe emails also show that Valmoro sent Clinton\u2019s government schedule to the unsecure email addresses of numerous members of the Clinton Foundation staff on October 16, 2009, again on October 18, 2009, and on October 25, 2009. The emails also include discussions of personnel matters and appointments on Clinton\u2019s unsecure account, which may run afoul of federal privacy law. \\nThis is the thirteenth set of records produced for Judicial Watch by the State Department from the non-state.gov email accounts of Huma Abedin. The documents were produced under a court order in a May 5, 2015, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit against the State Department requiring the agency to produce \u201call emails of official State Department business received or sent by former Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin from January 1, 2009 through February 1, 2013, using a \u2018non-state\u2019.gov email address\u201d ( Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of State (No. 1:15-cv-00684)). Previous records releases documented special Clinton State Department consideration for Clinton Foundation supporters (see here , here , and here .) \\n\u201cWe\u2019ve once again uncovered classified information in Hillary Clinton\u2019s and Huma Abedin\u2019s emails,\u201d said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. \u201cIt is frankly remarkable that the FBI and Justice Department are only now investigating Abedin\u2019s connection to Clinton\u2019s mishandling of classified information.\u201d Post navigation'"}, "time": 1742628587.5178542}
