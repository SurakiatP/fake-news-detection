In a ceremony outside the government headquarters of Mexico\u2019s Puebla State, Ms. Luna, a candidate for governor, unleashed a troupe of Aztec dancers across the colonial building\u2019s cobblestone forecourt. They hopped around wearing leather skirts and spectacular feather headdresses. One drew designs in the air with smoke from burning tree resin. Another blew a conch shell. Ms. Luna explained to bemused onlookers that the event last week was a purification ritual intended to flush out \u201cthe curse\u201d of bad government, along with fear, coercion, vote buying, apathy and violence. \u201cPeople who feel desperate turn to ritualistic cleansings,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been cursed. \u201d It is election time in Mexico again, with voters going to the polls on Sunday for municipal and regional elections, including the governorships in 12 of Mexico\u2019s 32 states. While some might quibble with Ms. Luna\u2019s technique, few would argue against her appeal to clean up Mexico\u2019s electoral politics. Mexican political campaigns have never been for the faint of heart, and this year has been no different, with    contests that have made a certain presidential contest north of the border look almost quaint in comparison. The official campaign period in Mexico, which by law lasted only two months and ended on Wednesday, was marked by \u201ca dirty war,\u201d to use the favored term of the Mexican news media and political class. Candidates all over the country have hurled accusations of corruption at one another, including charges of graft and financing by drug traffickers. In the governor\u2019s race in Veracruz, one candidate even accused his main competitor of being a pedophile. Some contests also featured violence and intimidation, including the firebombing of a party leader\u2019s office in Veracruz. Dozens of local and regional candidates withdrew from races, reportedly because of threats from drug traffickers. A lot is at stake. More than 1, 300 seats are up for grabs, with the governorships the most important. The outcome of Sunday\u2019s vote could also serve as a prologue for the 2018 presidential election. President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s Institutional Revolutionary Party holds nine of the 12 contested governorships, but he is polling lower than any president in the past two decades, and his plummeting popularity could hurt his party\u2019s chances on Sunday. Luis Carlos Ugalde, the director of Integralia Consultores, a political consultancy in Mexico City, said the level of invective and the prevalence of corruption allegations had increased in recent electoral cycles. This year\u2019s tone was \u201cthe most negative\u201d he had seen, he said. The rancor of the current campaigns is likely to influence the tenor of the presidential election, said Mr. Ugalde, who served as president of Mexico\u2019s election commission in the 2000s. \u201cThis could cause a very troubled atmosphere in 2018,\u201d he predicted. Arguably, the most contentious race this year has been for governor in Veracruz, a state wracked by corruption and violence. The   are two cousins who, despite their family ties, have lobbed accusations and insults at each other. H\u00e9ctor Yunes Landa, the candidate for the incumbent Institutional Revolutionary Party, has accused his opponent, Miguel \u00c1ngel Yunes Linares, the candidate of a coalition between the Democratic Revolution Party and the National Action Party, of being a pedophile, warning voters to \u201ctake care of the safety of your children,\u201d according to local news media. Mr. Yunes Linares, who is trying to break the rival party\u2019s   hold on the state\u2019s governorship, has denied the charges. Officials in Mr. Yunes Linares\u2019s campaign have accused his cousin of vote buying and of underreporting his wealth in a public declaration of his assets. Mr. Yunes Linares\u2019s chances may have improved in light of a recent investigation by the news site Animal Pol\u00edtico, which found that the state\u2019s current administration funneled about $35 million to ghost companies. The governor, Javier Duarte, has denied any wrongdoing. In the northern border state of Tamaulipas, the leading candidates for governor and their parties have been accused of having links to drug cartels. The Institutional Revolutionary Party\u2019s candidate for governor, Baltazar Hinojosa Ochoa, has been accused of receiving money from the Gulf Cartel during a mayoral run in 2002 in the municipality of Matamoros. He has denied the allegations. Mr. Hinojosa Ochoa\u2019s party has accused his main rival, Francisco Garc\u00eda Cabeza de Vaca, the candidate for the National Action Party, of having his own links to organized crime. To support its accusations, the Institutional Revolutionary Party submitted a photo to government investigators showing gunmen riding around in a truck decorated with the symbol of the rival party. A Revolutionary Party official later admitted that the photograph had been taken in another state and, in any case, had been doctored. Candidates for governor in several other states  \u2014   including Chihuahua, Oaxaca, Quintana Roo and Sinaloa  \u2014   have also had to parry accusations of corruption and links to organized crime. The war of words has been punctuated by violent threats and attacks. On Tuesday, a group of armed attackers firebombed the offices of the Veracruz state leader for the National Action Party. \u201cThese are the costs of challenging a corrupt, unscrupulous system,\u201d the party leader, Jos\u00e9 de Jes\u00fas Mancha, said in a statement after the bombing. In Puebla, an official from the Institutional Revolutionary Party was wounded in a shooting while he was driving. A party leader, Jorge Estefan Chidiac, blamed the state administration, led by the National Action Party, for the attack, saying it \u201cwas part of a strategy of the state government to destabilize, intimidate and threaten the people of Puebla. \u201d National Action Party officials denied responsibility. In Sinaloa, a candidate for the state legislature said his house had been shot at, and an office linked to the campaign of a mayoral candidate was ransacked by burglars, according to local news media accounts. In Culiac\u00e1n, the capital of Sinaloa, someone spray painted death threats against a candidate for governor on the walls of a university. During a radio interview on Thursday, Miguel \u00c1ngel Osorio Chong, Mexico\u2019s interior secretary, called the campaign period \u201cthe most ruthless of any electoral processes. \u201d \u201cI don\u2019t understand this kind of democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe in competition, and when there\u2019s an accusation and there are problems, you have to say something. But it went too far. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564524.2010121}
