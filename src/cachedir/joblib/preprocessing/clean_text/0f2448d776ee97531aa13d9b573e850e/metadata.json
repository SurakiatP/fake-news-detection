That represents a decline of more than 4 percent from the total of 9. 63 million people who signed up through HealthCare. gov at this time last year. The numbers do not include activity in the 11 states that run their own online marketplaces under the Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law. State reports suggest that they have signed up about three million people. Veterans of the Obama administration said President Trump\u2019s opposition to the health law and his efforts to undermine it had taken a toll. People may also have been influenced by signals from Congress that the law would soon be repealed. And some consumers may have been put off by the termination of their health plans, which was caused by an exodus of major insurers from the market in many states. Just before leaving office, the Obama administration reported that   through HealthCare. gov were running slightly ahead of the number at the same time last year, with 8. 8 million as of Jan. 14. \u201cTrump\u2019s sabotage worked,\u201d said Ben Wakana, who was a spokesman for Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services under Mr. Obama. \u201cWe were on track to exceed last year\u2019s total. We expected a million people to sign up on the federal exchange in the final week of the open enrollment period. \u201d Still, the numbers present a challenge to Republicans who are struggling to repeal the law that allowed those millions to purchase insurance plans  \u2014   and who have promised not to displace anyone covered by it. The fourth annual open enrollment season began Nov. 1 and ended Tuesday, 11 days after Mr. Trump took office. The Trump administration scaled back publicity and advertising in the final days of the open enrollment period. Mr. Trump also issued a broadly worded executive order that directed federal officials to waive or delay any provision of the Affordable Care Act that would impose \u201ca cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals. \u201d The order, issued within hours of Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration on Jan. 20, did not specify what actions would be taken. But lawyers and health policy experts read it as an indication that the government might not enforce the federal requirement for people to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty. Mr. Trump has described the Affordable Care Act as \u201ca complete and total disaster\u201d and has said he wants to replace it with better, cheaper coverage \u201cfor everybody,\u201d but he has not offered a plan to achieve that goal. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and chairman of the Finance Committee, who is trying to draft a replacement for the law, said that \u201ctoday\u2019s numbers failed to keep pace with last year\u2019s. \u201d In addition, he suggested, some people who signed up will not pay their premiums and will therefore not have coverage this year. \u201cEither way,\u201d Mr. Hatch said, \u201cenrollment numbers are down, and costs are up. \u201d That response was predicted by Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader and an architect of the law. \u201cNow, Republicans will cynically point to the dip in enrollment they caused, declare the Affordable Care Act broken and move to steal the affordable health coverage of every American,\u201d she said. \u201cMeanwhile, in states committed to delivering affordable health coverage to their residents, enrollment in the Affordable Care Act\u2019s marketplaces has surged. \u201d \u201cDemocrats will continue to stand our ground to ensure that every American has access to affordable health coverage,\u201d she added. Enrollment reports from the Obama administration were invariably upbeat, saying the numbers showed that people needed and wanted insurance under the Affordable Care Act. The first report from the Trump administration struck a different tone. \u201cObamacare has failed the American people, with one broken promise after another,\u201d Matt Lloyd, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said Friday. \u201cPremiums in the A. C. A. marketplace have increased 25 percent while the number of insurers has declined 28 percent over the past year. \u201d Of the 9. 2 million people who signed up through HealthCare. gov,   were new to the federal marketplace, and   were returning customers. The individual insurance market is in constant flux. With changes in income and employment, consumers may gain or lose coverage from Medicaid, employers and other sources of insurance. The Obama administration predicted in October that 13. 8 million people would sign up for coverage in the enrollment period that ended this week. The total appears likely to fall short of that goal. Leslie Dach, a former Obama administration official who is trying to preserve the health law as a leader of the Protect Our Care Coalition, said, \u201cEnrollment was a success, and it would have been even higher without the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to suppress enrollment. \u201d Despite those efforts, he said, \u201cAmericans continued to enroll in the final weeks, proving that there is considerable demand for quality and affordable coverage. \u201d Several states that run their own insurance exchanges appear to have done better than the federal marketplace. In New York, 908, 200 people signed up through the state marketplace for either a qualified health plan or the \u201cbasic health program\u201d authorized by the Affordable Care Act for   people. That represents an increase of 39 percent. Under the Obama administration, enrollment in marketplace insurance plans was consistently lower than the levels originally projected by the Congressional Budget Office, in part because consumers were more likely to get and keep   insurance.'"}, "time": 1742562146.927404}
