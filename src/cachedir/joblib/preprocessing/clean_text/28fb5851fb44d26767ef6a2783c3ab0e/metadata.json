Is President Trump willing to sign a government spending bill that does not include that money?\u201d He answered, \u201cYeah. Because I think the bill  \u2014   at least the offer that we received from the Democrats  \u2014   the last couple days  \u2014   included a good bit of money for border security. The Democrats said they\u2019d go to the mat and shut the government down over the border wall, the bricks and mortar. But there\u2019s a lot of things we agree on, both parties do, in securing the border. And it allows the president to follow through on his promise to make that border more secure, stop people coming over, stop drugs from coming over. So, there\u2019s things we can do, by way of maintenance and technology, gates, bridges, roads, that kind of stuff, that make a real difference in that southern border security. \u201d Mulvaney added, \u201cWe\u2019re not backing down. Keep in mind, this is just  \u2014   this bill is just for the last five months of this year.   \u2026     The discussion for what to do in fiscal year \u201918, which starts October 1st, that discussion actually starts as soon as this bill is signed. So, we\u2019re going to continue these conversations. We just thought that it would be a good first step to get these things that everybody agrees on and take that idea of a government shutdown off the table. \u201d Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742564195.7550595}
