[\u201cI hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go,\u201d Trump told Comey, according to parts of the memo read to the New York Times. \u201cHe is a good guy. I hope you can let this go. \u201d  At the White House Tuesday afternoon, White House aides denied the story. \u201cThis is not a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation between the president and Mr. Comey,\u201d they said, assuring reporters that Trump never asked Comey to shut down the investigation. They also pointed to a statement from acting F. B. I. director Andrew G. McCabe saying a week ago that there had been no effort to impede the Russian investigation. According to the Times, Comey kept detailed memos about every conversation he had with Trump over the phone and in person. After Trump spoke to him about Flynn, he shared the memo about the conversation with senior FBI officials.'"}, "time": 1742562064.3158767}
