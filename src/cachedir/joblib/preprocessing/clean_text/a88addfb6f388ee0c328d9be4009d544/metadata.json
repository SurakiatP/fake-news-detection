Mr. Crutcher, 40, was killed Friday evening on a Tulsa street by an officer identified as Betty Jo Shelby, a   veteran of the city\u2019s Police Department. Officer Shelby, who is white, was responding to reports of a tan S. U. V. abandoned in the middle of the road  \u2014   its motor running, the driver\u2019s door open and the driver nowhere in sight. The family\u2019s news conference came as the Tulsa police promised a thorough investigation and as a lawyer for Officer Shelby, Scott Wood, defended her actions. The case is the latest in a series of deaths across the country at the hands of the police that have raised questions about officers\u2019 use of force, particularly against   men. Mr. Wood said Mr. Crutcher had behaved erratically and refused to comply with police commands. He said that Mr. Crutcher had been reaching through the vehicle\u2019s window when he was shot, and that Officer Shelby believed he had a weapon. \u201cShe is extremely distraught over what has happened,\u201d Mr. Wood said. \u201cShe has never used deadly force in her   career. She is a pretty seasoned officer and has worked in a lot of different areas. She is viewed by everyone as someone who is really squared away. \u201d The family\u2019s lawyers, who include Benjamin L. Crump, who represented the relatives of Michael Brown, the unarmed black teenager who was killed in 2014 by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo. challenged Mr. Wood\u2019s account. Mr. Crump displayed photos at the news conference showing that the window of the S. U. V. had been rolled up. On Tuesday, the Tulsa police declined to comment on whether Mr. Crutcher had been reaching inside the car. \u201cThis investigation is ongoing, and the U. S. attorney and the district attorney has requested no additional information be released,\u201d a police spokesman, Officer Leland Ashley, said. Protesters gathered in Tulsa on Monday and Tuesday, calling for an unbiased investigation. At a prayer vigil Tuesday afternoon, a pastor, Jeremiah Hale, called for prayers for the family. Adrian Colbert, who is   said the shooting occurred near his house, and he referred to the riots in the 1920s, in which white residents killed up to an estimated 300   in the city. \u201cHe had his hands up, and they popped him,\u201d Mr. Colbert said. \u201cBut that\u2019s something we\u2019re used to. It goes back to 1921. What happens here usually gets swept under the rug. \u201d The Tulsa police have opened a criminal investigation into the shooting, and the Justice Department has started a civil rights inquiry. A police video of the shooting from a department helicopter shows Mr. Crutcher slowly walking away from Officer Shelby and toward his vehicle. Moments after Mr. Crutcher is seen reaching the driver\u2019s side of the vehicle, one officer fired a Taser and Officer Shelby fired a single round, killing Mr. Crutcher. Videos from the police helicopter and dashboard cameras did not capture the shooting itself. The helicopter video appears to show that at least one of Mr. Crutcher\u2019s hands was raised when he was shot. The police said Officer Shelby did not have any disciplinary actions against her that resulted in a suspension or loss of pay since she joined the department in 2011. Before that, she worked for the Tulsa County sheriff\u2019s office. Deputy Justin Green, a spokesman for the sheriff\u2019s office, said she joined the department in June 2007 and was a member of the agency\u2019s dive team. Mr. Wood, the officer\u2019s lawyer, said that when Officer Shelby arrived at the scene Friday, she found Mr. Crutcher walking nearby. He did not respond to her questions, Mr. Wood said, but instead \u201clocks his eyes on her,\u201d which the officer described as \u201ca   stare. \u201d Mr. Wood said Officer Shelby was \u201ca drug recognition expert,\u201d who had received specialized training in 2014. Officer Shelby, the lawyer said, believed Mr. Crutcher was \u201cunder the influence of something. \u201d When Mr. Crutcher ignored the officer\u2019s order to get on his knees, she drew her gun, the lawyer said. But Mr. Crutcher continued to keep his hands in the air. He was shot about 30 seconds after other officers arrived. On Tuesday, referring to reports that Mr. Crutcher had been using drugs, David Riggs, one of the Crutcher family\u2019s lawyers, said: \u201cWe do not know if that\u2019s true or not. We are looking into that. \u201d He added: \u201cLet\u2019s assume that it was. You have to ask yourself again, what is the proper way to handle a situation where someone is acting in a strange way and perhaps not entirely in control of his emotions or his mental state at that time? This is a textbook case of how not to treat someone in that condition. \u201d Mr. Crump said the Tulsa police needed sensitivity training, a reference to comments heard on the videos by two officers in a helicopter. One was Officer Shelby\u2019s husband, David H. Shelby. The other officer in the helicopter, whom the department did not identify, can be heard saying, \u201cTime for a Taser, I think,\u201d as they watched the confrontation \u201cI got a feeling that\u2019s about to happen,\u201d David Shelby said. \u201cThat looks like a bad dude, too,\u201d the second officer said. Mr. Crutcher was shot moments later \u201cThey should not look at citizens like that,\u201d Mr. Crump said of the officer\u2019s comment. \u201cBecause if every big black man is going to be looked at as a criminal and taken down with lethal force, then our society is in a lot of trouble. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564106.0074053}
