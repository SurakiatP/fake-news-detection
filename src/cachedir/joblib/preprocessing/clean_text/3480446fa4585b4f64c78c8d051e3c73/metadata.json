Trump insisted that Mexico would ultimately pay for its construction. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get reimbursed,\u201d Mr. Trump said during a brief telephone interview. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to wait that long. But you start, and then you get reimbursed. \u201d The congressional Republicans\u2019 talk led to speculation that Mr. Trump was retreating on his campaign promise to make Mexico pay for the wall. Mr. Trump insisted he is not. Republicans have balked at increases in domestic spending during the Obama administration and are unlikely to enthusiastically rally behind a proposal that could require billions of taxpayer dollars. Building a wall to keep out unauthorized immigrants could also face intense opposition from a bipartisan coalition in Congress that argues that a vast barrier along the border would be ineffective in stopping people who are determined to enter the country illegally and would represent a symbolic affront to the idea that the United States is a welcoming country that embraces immigration. In the interview, Mr. Trump vowed that Mexico would ultimately reimburse the United States. He said that payment would most likely emerge from his efforts to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with the Mexican government. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be part of everything,\u201d Mr. Trump said of the cost of building the wall. \u201cWe are going to be making a much better deal. It\u2019s a deal that never should have been signed. \u201d But he said that the trade negotiations would take time and that he supported the idea of using taxpayer money to begin construction of the border wall \u201cin order to speed up the process. \u201d The full cost of a wall as described by Mr. Trump could be enormous. Attaching such a charged issue to annual, mandatory government funding measures could instigate a risky political fight. Those who want to block money for the wall by holding up the bills could find themselves accused of shutting down the government. The Government Accountability Office has estimated it could cost $6. 5 million per mile to build a   fence, with an additional $4. 2 million per mile for roads and more fencing, according to congressional officials. Those estimates do not include maintenance of the fence along the nearly   border with Mexico. \u201cThe chairman and the committee have no interest in threatening a shutdown,\u201d said Jennifer Hing, a spokeswoman for the House Appropriations Committee, referring to Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen, Republican of New Jersey and the committee\u2019s new chairman. If funding for the border wall is included in spending bills this spring, it would provide money to begin construction on a barrier that was authorized by legislation passed in 2006, but was never completed. Ms. Hing said neither Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team nor Republican leaders had asked for funding to build a wall on the Mexican border. \u201cIf and when a proposal is received, we will take a careful look at it,\u201d she said in an email on Friday. At a rally in August in Phoenix, hours after meeting with President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico, Mr. Trump vowed that America\u2019s southern neighbor would bear the financial burden of securing the border. \u201cMexico will pay for the wall, believe me  \u2014   100 percent  \u2014   they don\u2019t know it yet, but they will pay for the wall,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019re great people, and great leaders, but they will pay for the wall. \u201d In a Twitter post on Friday, Mr. Trump mocked news reports about the possible taxpayer funding of the border barrier, suggesting that Mexico would be forced to reimburse the American government for any costs incurred in building the wall. \u201cThe dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed) will be paid back by Mexico later!\u201d he wrote early Friday. Vicente Fox, who was Mexico\u2019s president from 2000 until 2006, responded to Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter message with a barrage of outraged posts that became an internet talking point on their own. In one of them, he made reference to the intelligence agency reports about Russian meddling in the 2016 election. \u201cSr Trump, the intelligence report is devastating,\u201d Mr. Fox said. \u201cLosing election by more than 3M votes and in addition this. Are you a legitimate president?\u201d Representative Chris Collins, Republican of New York and one of Mr. Trump\u2019s liaisons on Capitol Hill, said on Friday morning that members of his party in Congress were eager to get moving on construction of a border wall, even if that meant using taxpayer money to finance it. In an appearance on the CNN program \u201cNew Day,\u201d Mr. Collins said it should come as no surprise to anyone that the United States government would have to pay for building the wall. \u201cOf course, we have to pay the bills,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re building the wall. \u201d As a candidate, Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to build a wall to keep out immigrants from Mexico was one of his most powerful speaking points. He often used it at rallies to whip up his supporters and bolster his argument that illegal immigration was damaging the United States. His repeated pledge to make Mexico pay was in part a way to rebut one of the central criticisms of a border wall  \u2014   that its cost could run into the many billions of dollars. Democrats slammed the reports that Mr. Trump would ask Congress to fund the project. \u201cIf President Trump asks Congress to approve taxpayer dollars to build a wall, which he has always said would not be paid for by U. S. taxpayers, we will carefully review the request to determine if these taxpayer dollars would be better spent on building hospitals to care for our veterans, roads and bridges to help taxpayers get to work, and for N. I. H. to find cures for cancer,\u201d Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, said in a statement. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, said she thought even Republicans might balk at spending what she said could be $14 billion on a wall. \u201cI think that\u2019s a heavy sell,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a tough sell for them. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561916.5324721}
