Number one on the list was his failure to secure gun control. [Obama shared this same regret with CNN in early December 2016, and the BBC quoted him in July 2015 speaking about the \u201cdistressing\u201d failure to secure gun control.  On Wednesday, he used the letter to highlight his regrets once more. After listing numerous things he views as achievements \u2014  such as shifting from coal to solar power, pulling out of Iraq, pulling out of Afghanistan, and securing Obamacare \u2014  Obama wrote: Still, through every victory and every setback, I\u2019ve insisted that change is never easy, and never quick that we wouldn\u2019t meet all of our challenges in one term, or one presidency, or even in one lifetime. And for all that we\u2019ve achieved, there\u2019s still so much I wish we\u2019d been able to do, from enacting gun safety measures to protect more of our kids and our cops from mass shootings like Newtown, to passing commonsense immigration reform that encourages the best and brightest from around the world to study, stay, and create jobs in America. Regardless of whether a gun control group or an individual gun controller like Obama raises the topic, it is notable that no gun law would have prevented the Newtown, Connecticut, attack against Sandy Hook Elementary School. It is especially notable that the gun controls President Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, and Senator Joe Manchin ( ) pushed in the wake of Sandy Hook would have done nothing to prevent another Sandy Hook. Manchin touted an expansion of background checks in reaction to the Sandy Hook attack. And then, just days before the Senate rejected the gun controls, he admitted that his proposal would not have prevented the attack. Isolated Sandy   attacks continued around the country during the last four years of Obama\u2019s presidency, and background checks would not have stopped one of them. But nearly all of them could have been reduced \u2014  or perhaps prevented altogether \u2014  by changing the one commonality many of them shared: namely, policies that mandate the disarmament of   citizens in certain buildings   locations.
