[\u201cAmerica will thrive as long as we continue to have faith in each other and faith in God,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat faith in God has inspired men and women to sacrifice for the needy, to deploy to wars overseas, and lock arms at home to ensure equal rights for every man, woman, and child in our land. \u201d  He vowed to protect religious liberty in America, specifically promising to get rid of the Johnson Amendment, which prevents churches and   organizations from endorsing and opposing political candidates. \u201cOur republic was formed on the basis that freedom is not a gift from government, but that freedom is a gift from God,\u201d Trump said. But Trump warned that Islamic State terrorists were specifically targeting Christians and \u201cpeaceful Muslims. \u201d He also mentioned that the Jewish people were under attack from terrorists. \u201cThe world is in trouble, but we\u2019re going to straighten it out. That\u2019s what I do,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI fix things. We\u2019re going the straighten it out. Believe me. \u201d The president paid tribute to slain Navy SEAL Mark Owens and quoted John 15:13 to recognize his sacrifice. \u201cGreater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends,\u201d he said. Trump also used his speech to defend his decision to restrict refugees and immigration from seven   Middle East countries, calling it a \u201cnecessary\u201d step to prevent opponents of American values from entering the country. \u201cWe will not allow a beachhead of intolerance to spread in our nation,\u201d he said, promising to develop an immigration system to only allow people into the country who would share American values. \u201cIn the coming days, we will develop a system to help ensure that those admitted into our country fully embrace our values of religious and personal liberty and that they reject any form of oppression and discrimination,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe want people to come into our nation, but we want people to love us and to love our values, not to hate us and to hate our values. \u201d Trump spoke about his mother, who raised him with faith, and he explained that personal wealth fails to bring true happiness. \u201cI tell you that from somebody who has had material success and knows tremendous numbers of people with great material success, the most material success,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of those people are very, very miserable, unhappy people, and I know a lot of people without that, but they have great families. They have great faith. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561978.7917354}
