The sad truth is that I\u2019ve have a song from the NBC series \u201cSmash\u201d stuck in my head for three whole days. And not even one of the great ones. No, I\u2019ve been humming \u201cHistory Is Made at Night. \u201d That\u2019s Tier 2 at best! Thanks for nothing, brain. This weekend, in an attempt to dislodge said   number, I\u2019ll be finishing up my \u201cSouthland\u201d rewatch (if you\u2019ve never seen this police drama, you should start) and seething with jealousy that England is able to enjoy a new season of \u201cThe Great British  . \u201d We in the States have to just practice patience, I guess. See you Monday, pals. \u201cHorrible Histories,\u201d Hulu Watch if you wish Monty Python were more factual, or if you imagine you\u2019d be the coolest social studies teacher. \u201cHorrible Histories\u201d is a beloved series of   books, and it\u2019s been adapted into several TV formats, including this brilliant   sketch version that premiered in Britain in 2009. It\u2019s deeply silly and frequently hilarious, and is hosted by a rat puppet  \u2014   but it\u2019s also genuinely educational, and covers a wide variety of historical topics (Socrates, Joan of Arc, the Titanic). There are 82 episodes available, and it\u2019s very consistent, so there\u2019s no bad episode to pick. There\u2019s occasional toilet humor, but if you\u2019re trying to convince an    to give it a go, that might be a selling point. \u201cI Miss Downton Abbey!\u201d Sunday, 9 p. m. some PBS affiliates (check your local listings). Watch if   \u2026     well, you get it. I\u2019m surprised that more shows don\u2019t have   specials like this, especially this long after their finales. I\u2019d totally watch a \u201cAre You Still Thinking About \u2018Mad Men\u2019?\u201d special. Or \u201c\u2018Lost:\u2019 Like, It\u2019s Been a Few Years, You Can Chill. \u201d Or \u201c\u2018ER\u2019 Was So Good. \u201d So many people complaining about the \u201cnostalgia boom,\u201d so few people making the sort of nostalgia I am deeply interested in. \u201cSpiral\u201d (\u201cEngrenages\u201d in France) Netflix (four seasons) Hulu (five seasons). Watch if you like gory, bleak foreign murder mysteries. The French series \u201cSpiral\u201d premiered in 2005, so it predates most of the shows that are like it  \u2014   \u201cThe Killing\u201d and \u201cThe Bridge\u201d specifically. Do I even need to say that the series begins with the discovery of a dead woman\u2019s mutilated, mostly nude body? It does. But it also has depth and potency, particularly in its character development, if not always in its plotting. The   first season focuses on one particular investigation, and subsequent seasons keep the cop and lawyer characters but vary the cases. \u201cMonkey Thieves,\u201d Hulu. Watch if you like monkey business. Ho, ho. You might think this is about people who steal monkeys, \u00e0 la the absolute worst moment in \u201cLaw  Order\u201d franchise history, but it\u2019s the monkeys themselves who are the thieves! HBO\u2019s   limited series \u201cThe Night Of\u201d ends its   season Sunday night with an   installment. (It\u2019s almost two hours long.) If you need to brush up a little, our recaps of the previous episodes can be found here. She\u2019s a tomboy who doesn\u2019t fit in at the local community center  \u2014   not at her brother\u2019s boxing ring and not on the   dance team. But    Toni (Royalty Hightower) wants to belong. Unfortunately for her, fitting in means potentially catching a mysterious   condition that has befallen the dancers. They call it \u201cthe fits,\u201d which gives the movie its name. \u201cThe Fits\u201d is an impressive debut for both Hightower and the director Anna Rose Holmer. Hightower\u2019s understated performance allows her (and us) to observe the gender divided corners of her community center. And Holmer makes every one of her visually stunning scenes count by getting close to the action and slowing down the   hits, kicks and fits. (Watch on Amazon or iTunes)  \u2014   Monica Castillo Something silly: Uproxx\u2019s explainer about CBS\u2019s incoherent      drama \u201cZoo\u201d is a thing of beauty.  Something serious: The Hollywood Reporter\u2019s feature \u201cLittle People, Big Woes in Hollywood: Low Pay, Degrading Jobs and a Tragic Death\u201d is a long, worthwhile read. Something surprisingly interesting: At first I scoffed, but Atlas Obscura\u2019s \u201cI Made a Shipwreck Expert Watch \u2018The Little Mermaid\u2019 and Judge Its Nautical Merits\u201d is actually fascinating. Maritime archaeology! What a cool job.'"}, "time": 1742628491.7478504}
