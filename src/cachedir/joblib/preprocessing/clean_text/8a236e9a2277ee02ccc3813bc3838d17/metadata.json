In 2012, as he campaigned for   five members of the president\u2019s cabinet addressed the party convention in Charlotte, N. C. But in issuing the prohibition this year, Mr. Obama\u2019s chief of staff, Denis McDonough, decided to \u201csend a signal about the primacy of the Obama administration\u2019s responsibility to manage the government and serve the American people,\u201d said Jennifer Friedman, the deputy White House press secretary. It is hardly the first judgment that Mr. Obama\u2019s team has had to make about how deeply to get involved as the president takes on an increasingly active role in the raucous campaign to succeed him  \u2014   decisions that involve not only considerations of policy and appearances, but legal ones, as well. Federal law requires top appointees to carefully separate their official duties from political ones, and those distinctions have taken on added significance this year, given the unusual nature of the race to succeed Mr. Obama. White House officials believe that the campaign presents a particularly tricky set of challenges: a presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Donald J. Trump, who routinely prompts controversy with his provocative statements and positions a presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Mrs. Clinton, who once served in the administration and has considered several cabinet secretaries as potential running mates and a   president who looms over the race. \u201cThis is largely an effort to delineate as clearly as possible the public, official governing responsibilities we have at the White House, and separate that from politics,\u201d said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. Administration officials must walk a fine line, one that sometimes involves hairsplitting differences. Hurling a personal insult at Mr. Trump from a White House lectern? Off limits. But Mr. Earnest can note the many ways in which Mr. Trump\u2019s positions are at odds with the president\u2019s. Headlining a   for Mrs. Clinton? No problem for a cabinet secretary, as long as the secretary does not use his or her official title or ask for contributions. The White House counsel, Neil Eggleston, and members of his staff have stepped up their warnings to White House officials and other top administration appointees to exercise care that their political activity stays within the law, which limits the use of official resources for partisan activities. At the same time, lawyers at the Office of Special Counsel, which enforces the federal law that restricts partisan activity by government officials, have increased their investigations of federal employees and have been warning Mr. Obama\u2019s top advisers and appointees to watch what they say and do when it comes to the presidential campaign. The president and vice president are exempt from many of the legal strictures. But even Mr. Obama has taken precautions to separate his role as the head of the Democratic Party from his official duties. When Mr. Obama taped his endorsement video last month for Mrs. Clinton at the White House, it was done in the Map Room  \u2014   part of the residence, rather than his West Wing offices  \u2014   and Mr. Earnest was quick to note that it was \u201cnot filmed at government expense. \u201d This week, when Mr. Obama travels to North Carolina for his first campaign appearance with Mrs. Clinton, the cost of the trip on Air Force One will be shared between the White House and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign, according to a complicated formula worked out by his legal counsel to comply with federal election law. The risk of ethics breaches is increased by the sheer number of cabinet secretaries active on the campaign trail. A handful have publicly endorsed Mrs. Clinton, and three  \u2014   Juli\u00e1n Castro of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Thomas E. Perez of the Labor Department and Tom Vilsack of the Agriculture Department  \u2014   routinely surface on lists of potential   candidates. White House officials emphasized that there had been no finding that cabinet secretaries were barred by law from speaking at the convention, although Mr. Obama\u2019s lawyers concluded before the 2012 election that they must not use the title of \u201csecretary\u201d if they did.     from the past serve as cautionary tales. In 2012, the Office of Special Counsel concluded that Kathleen Sebelius, then the secretary of health and human services, had violated the Hatch Act  \u2014   the 1939 law that governs federal employees\u2019 participation in political activity  \u2014   by making \u201cextemporaneous partisan remarks\u201d during a speech at a gala for the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights group, in North Carolina. Ms. Sebelius, who asserted that the Democratic lieutenant governor \u201cneeds to be the next governor of North Carolina\u201d and that Mr. Obama should be \u201cpresident for another four years,\u201d later said the comments were an unscripted \u201cmistake. \u201d A year earlier, the special counsel found that the Office of Political Affairs in George W. Bush\u2019s White House had committed numerous violations of the Hatch Act during the 2006 midterm congressional elections, including by coordinating requests from members of Congress to have cabinet secretaries make campaign appearances in their districts. Mr. Obama shuttered the office, and when it reopened in 2014, his lawyers issued new guidance about how to comply with the law. They have erred on the side of caution ever since, current and former officials said. \u201cThey\u2019re pitching a   in the ninth inning of the administration, and why screw it up at the end?\u201d said Norman Eisen, a former special counsel for ethics and government reform under Mr. Obama. \u201cHistorically, the last months of an administration are a time when people get lazy and things go off the rails, so extra vigilance is called for. \u201d The Hatch Act, which was enacted after officials in Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s administration were accused of using New Deal programs to sway the outcome of the 1938 congressional elections, is designed to prevent political favoritism and coercion in the administration and ensure that citizens receive the same service from the federal government, no matter their political affiliation. In theory, it means that most federal employees may participate in partisan politics only on their own time  \u2014   following strict rules  \u2014   and at their own expense. In practice, it can lead to awkward contortions. Mr. Earnest and other administration press representatives are advised to pivot away from overt questions about partisan politics and stick to \u201csafe zones,\u201d such as what the president himself has said publicly. At the Agriculture Department, Mr. Vilsack requires all political appointees to attend hourlong ethics and legal briefings during the campaign season, and asks agency lawyers to present an \u201cethics moment\u201d each week to explain the intricacies of the rules, said Matt Herrick, his communications director. When he wrote an opinion article in The Gazette of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in August endorsing Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Vilsack left out his official title, signing it as the former governor of the state. \u201cWith Republicans in control of the House and the Senate, you can bet that the investigative arm will swing into action very quickly if anything is even hinted at being wrong,\u201d said Richard W. Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota who served as Mr. Bush\u2019s chief ethics lawyer from 2005 to 2007. \u201cThe public is very cynical about ethics issues across the board, so anybody in the administration going even close to the line is not going to help Secretary Clinton. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563980.1078424}
