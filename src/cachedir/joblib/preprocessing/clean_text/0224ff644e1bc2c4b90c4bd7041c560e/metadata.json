Reyes, CEO of The Silent Partner Marketing, claims he makes potential employees take a \u201csnowflake test\u201d before hiring them, in a new article for the New Boston Post. [In the article, Reyes explained how his test works, and what questions it includes.  \u201cI don\u2019t want most people to work for my company. No, seriously. Most people suck,\u201d wrote Reyes. \u201cAnd I want people to work for me who don\u2019t suck  \u2026     So I\u2019ve implemented something that is going to give HR managers and the PC Police night sweats. I lovingly refer to it as The Snowflake Test. \u201d \u201cAnyone who may be a viable candidate for our agency has to take the test before they get an   at an interview,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s 30   and   questions that help us to really get to know a candidate. We want to get in their heads. See how they apply logic and reason to different scenarios. See what makes them tick. See if they\u2019d be a good fit for our culture. \u201d The test includes questions on how the applicant feels about guns, safe spaces, and trigger warnings, as well as some which are more personal and complex. \u201cWhen was the last time you cried and why?\u201d is allegedly one, as well as \u201cYou see someone stepping on an American Flag. What happens next?\u201d \u201cSince I launched this \u2018filtering\u2019 process, if you will, I\u2019ve gotten a tremendous amount of whining from the general public,\u201d claimed Reyes, added that he was \u201cscolded by a woman on the phone yesterday who told me she wouldn\u2019t take the test and \u2018shame\u2019 on me for making people take a test to come work for us. \u201d \u201cShe \u201cdemanded\u201d I remove the test or risk losing out on \u2018perfect employees\u2019 like herself,\u201d he claimed. \u201cBummer. Well, snowflake, it\u2019s back to the heaping pile of applications for me. \u201d Reyes has previously criticized safe spaces and trigger warnings, publishing \u201cAn open letter to college crybabies from a CEO,\u201d last year.
