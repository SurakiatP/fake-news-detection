[Lansing City Council voted   to reverse a decision made April 3 in a   vote that deemed the city a \u201csanctuary city\u201d in writing, the Detroit Free Press reported.  A letter the city council received from the Lansing Regional Chamber and Michigan Chamber of Commerce urging the council to remove all references to \u201csanctuary city\u201d from its resolution is behind the change in course, the Associated Press reported. The term \u201csanctuary city\u201d has sparked much debate as some cities decide to fight President Trump\u2019s decision to crack down on cities that refuse to have their law enforcement agencies cooperate with U. S. immigration authorities. \u201cThe term \u2018sanctuary\u2019 in the resolution has become very problematic and distracting  \u2014   so distracting in my opinion that\u2019s it\u2019s taken away from the intent of our resolution, which is to protect individuals,\u201d said Councilwoman Judi Brown Clarke. \u201cIt\u2019s basically a \u2018don\u2019t ask\u2019 policy, which was outlined by the mayor\u2019s executive order and what we had in our policy complements that. \u201d The council\u2019s decision does not change the recent executive order penned by Lansing Mayor Virg Bernero, which prohibits Lansing police officers and city employees from asking about immigration statuses \u201cexcept as required by federal or state statute or court decision,\u201d M Live reported.'"}, "time": 1742561912.0351908}
