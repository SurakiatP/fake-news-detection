The conviction of Mr. Silver, 72, served as a capstone to a campaign against public corruption by Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, which has led to more than a dozen state lawmakers\u2019 being convicted or pleading guilty. But none had the power, cachet or longevity that Mr. Silver, a Democrat, had enjoyed, and prosecutors sought to make an example of him. They asked that he receive a sentence greater than the terms that had been \u201cimposed on other New York State legislators convicted of public corruption offenses. \u201d The longest such sentence cited by the government was 14 years, the term imposed last year in the case of another former Democratic assemblyman, William F. Boyland Jr. who was tried and convicted in federal court in Brooklyn. Judge Valerie E. Caproni of Federal District Court in Manhattan noted that even before Mr. Silver\u2019s arrest, when some of his fellow legislators had been arrested on corruption charges, he remained undeterred. \u201cOne would think that the image of Mr. Silver\u2019s colleagues being arrested and led off to jail would have caused someone who was basically honest to reappraise what was going on,\u201d Judge Caproni said. Instead, she said, Mr. Silver \u201cstopped nothing,\u201d continuing to lie to his staff and to the press while holding himself out as \u201ca paragon of virtue. \u201d Judge Caproni said that there had been an \u201cincalculable, intangible harm\u201d to the people of New York, and that the cumulative effect of public corruption \u201cmakes the public very cynical. \u201d She then listed some of Mr. Silver\u2019s misdeeds and addressed him directly: \u201cMr. Silver, those are not the actions of a basically honest person. \u201d In court, Carrie H. Cohen, an assistant United States attorney, had asked that Mr. Silver\u2019s sentence \u201creflect the massive damage caused to the public by his crimes. \u201d The sentence, Ms. Cohen continued, should send a message that this is not the way \u201cbusiness is done in Albany, or at least that it shouldn\u2019t be, and that no one, including Sheldon Silver, is above the law. \u201d Mr. Silver briefly addressed the court before his sentence was delivered, saying he had let down his constituents, family and colleagues. \u201cI\u2019m truly, truly sorry for that,\u201d he said. Mr. Silver was convicted on Nov. 30 of charges that included honest services fraud, money laundering and extortion. Upon his conviction, he forfeited his Assembly seat. Two weeks later, Dean G. Skelos, who as majority leader had been Mr. Silver\u2019s Republican counterpart in the State Senate, was also convicted of corruption. Mr. Skelos is to be sentenced on May 12 a week later, John L. Sampson, a former leader of the Senate Democrats, will face his own sentencing. Prosecutors\u2019 scrutiny of New York lawmakers continues: Several inquiries are now focused on possible wrongdoing connected to the administrations of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio, both Democrats. To date, however, Mr. Silver\u2019s precipitous fall has no recent rival in the world of New York politics. In a statement issued moments after the sentencing, Mr. Bharara said that the \u201cstiff sentence is a just and fitting end to Sheldon Silver\u2019s long career of corruption. \u201d Mr. Silver had served for more than two decades as the Assembly speaker, imposing his will on matters large and small he had a reputation as a staunch defender of New York City, a shrewd negotiator in budget talks and, at times, a recalcitrant opponent of anything he disliked. But during a   trial last fall, a different side of Mr. Silver emerged. Evidence showed that he had obtained nearly $4 million in illicit fees in return for taking official actions that benefited a prominent cancer researcher, Dr. Robert N. Taub, at Columbia University, and two real estate developers, Glenwood Management and the Witkoff Group. Mr. Silver had expressed regret that his actions made the State Capitol the object of ridicule. In a letter sent last month to Judge Caproni, he offered an emotional apology, saying that he had \u201cfailed the people of New York. \u201d His lawyers had argued that the former speaker should be allowed to use his \u201cunique talents\u201d to benefit others, and that a sentence that incorporates \u201cextensive community service and little  \u2014   if any  \u2014   incarceration could do that. \u201d Mr. Silver\u2019s lawyers had suggested that he could work with the Fortune Society to help current and former inmates find jobs. One of Mr. Silver\u2019s lawyers, Joel Cohen, told the judge that his client had been \u201cdevastated\u201d and \u201ccrushed\u201d by everything that had happened. Notwithstanding everything he has done, Mr. Cohen said, \u201chis obituary has already been written. \u201d Another prosecutor, Howard S. Master, on Tuesday questioned the authenticity of Mr. Silver\u2019s contrition, noting he had insisted that he would be exonerated \u201cuntil the very moment of the jury\u2019s verdict. \u201d Judge Caproni, citing Mr. Silver\u2019s age, said she would not adhere to sentencing guidelines that recommended a term of roughly 22 to 27 years, calling such a sentence \u201cdraconian and unjust. \u201d The court\u2019s probation office had recommended a   sentence. The judge ordered that Mr. Silver forfeit more than $5 million in proceeds from his crimes and pay a $1. 75 million fine. She rejected a defense assertion that Mr. Silver\u2019s actions had not caused \u201cdiscernible harm. \u201d She said the specter of corruption made it impossible to know whether government officials were making decisions for the right reasons or for personal financial gain. His crimes \u201ccast a shadow over everything he has done and has thrown into doubt every difficult decision any legislator has ever made,\u201d the judge said. Mr. Silver must surrender himself by noon on July 1 his lawyers have requested that he serve at the Federal Correctional Institution in Otisville, N. Y. a prison known for its familiarity with the housing of prisoners who, like Mr. Silver, are Orthodox Jews. Governor Cuomo said on Tuesday: \u201cToday\u2019s decision sent a simple message that officials who abuse the public\u2019s trust will be held accountable. Justice was served. \u201d Last month, prosecutors, in a written submission to the judge, offered what they said was additional evidence of the ways Mr. Silver had abused his office \u201cfor personal benefit,\u201d by helping two women with whom he had conducted extramarital affairs. One of the women had regularly lobbied Mr. Silver on behalf of clients with business before the state he had \u201cused his official position,\u201d prosecutors said, to help the other woman get a state job. Mr. Silver\u2019s lawyers said after the hearing that his case would be appealed. Mr. Silver, addressing a crowd of reporters, said, \u201cI believe in the justice system in this nation, and we\u2019ll pursue whatever remedies the system makes available. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628596.3171928}
