Here is the ugly truth that is sending Black Lives Matter leadership into orbit over Hillary\u2019s pandering hypocrisy! Eric Garner died a tragic, unexpected death at the hands of a police officer. His death has sometime\u2019s referred to as \u201cthe chokehold death.\u201d Video of the sad episode can be seen below: Eric Garner\u2019s daughter, Erica, is a prominent Black Lives Matter leader, and she is none to pleased at what WikiLeaks has brought to light. In discussing an upcoming statement to describe Hillary\u2019s stance on gun violence, Clinton staffer Nick Merrill wrote: \u201cFinally, I know we have Erica Garner issues but we don\u2019t want to mention Eric at all? I can see her coming after us for leaving him out of the piece.\u201d Maya Harris replied, \u201cEric Garner not included because not killed by gun violence.\u201d The full email can be read here . Hillary\u2019s campaign was clearly considering how to best use, or not use, the Eric Garner story to push their agenda. The revelation, understandably, has set off a firestorm in the Black Lives Matter community. Erica Garner is teeing off! I\u2019m troubled by the revelation that you and this campaign actually discussed \u201cusing\u201d Eric Garner \u2026 Why would you want to \u201cuse\u201d my dad? \\n\u2014 officialERICA GARNER (@es_snipes) October 27, 2016 I dont care what BLM activists endorse #Hillary \u2026 They WILL continue more of the same, they dont care about Black lives and I got proof! \\n\u2014 officialERICA GARNER (@es_snipes) October 27, 2016 https://t.co/jzfUl0FbXF In this #PodestaEmails leak @CoreyCiorciari n @NickMerrill plot to use police violence victims to push gun control \\n\u2014 officialERICA GARNER (@es_snipes) October 27, 2016 They can get whoever they want to play their game,she called YOU super predators, they passed the crime bill and welfare reform. JUST SAY NO \\n\u2014 officialERICA GARNER (@es_snipes) October 27, 2016 If you vote for her by default you are endorsing her and whatever she does. Remember her hiding being Nergos that supported the crime bill? \\n\u2014 officialERICA GARNER (@es_snipes) October 27, 2016 \\nDo you blame Erica Garner for feeling the way that she does? For years, since the days of Lyndon Johnson, the Democrats have pandered to blacks, women, and other minorities. Many times, these minority groups have fallen in step behind these pandering, hypocritical, power-hungry leaders. \\nWith WikiLeaks on the scene to reveal the truth, it appears that times are changing!'"}, "time": 1742562641.7836313}
