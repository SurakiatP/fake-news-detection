Hillary LIES In First Press Conference While A LEAKED PHOTO From Her Airplane Reveals The Truth \\n0 comments Hillary is trying to present a strong front but the truth continues to emerge, in VIDEO and in PHOTOS! Hillary was traveling to Iowa when news broke of the FBI\u2019s newly-reopened investigation of her email practices. Her plane sat on the tarmac for thirty minutes before she emerged, and, of course, the media was hungry for a statement. Last night, the press got their wish, as Hillary tried to appear strong in her first press conference following the bombshell news. Watch Hillary\u2019s statement below: \\nMostly, Hillary is echoing her Campaign Manager, John Podesta, who is calling for the release of more information from the FBI. \\nRight out of the gate, Hillary is already lying in an attempt to minimize the damage that this new investigation is causing. \\nShe clearly states in the video above that the FBI sent the investigation announcement to Republicans in Congress. As a former Senator, Hillary knows this to be untrue, and she is trying to paint the issue as a partisan attack. Fact check: Contrary to what Clinton said, Comey sent letter to both Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill. @benyc \\n\u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) October 28, 2016 \\nMultiple media sources have reported that the FBI found new information while investigating the sexting scandal of former Congressman Anthony Weiner. Weiner is married to Hillary\u2019s top aide, Huma Abedin. When asked about the reports, Hillary responded: \\n\u201cYou know, we\u2019ve heard these rumors. We don\u2019t know what to believe and I\u2019m sure there will be even more rumors that\u2019s why it\u2019s incumbent upon the FBI to tell us what they\u2019re talking about because, right now, your guess is as good as mine and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s good enough.\u201d \\nHillary is trying to appear defiant and in control. But, speaking of Huma Abedin, take a look at this leaked photo from inside of Hillary\u2019s airplane after the news had broken: Image surfaces of Huma Abedin crying on plane as Clinton Campaign finds out the FBI has re-opened the email investigation. #HillarysEmails pic.twitter.com/2yIUgiYOsV \\nWe hate to see a lady crying, Huma, but when the company you keep includes Anthony Weiner, sometimes you have good reasons to cry. Perhaps Hillary\u2019s Campaign is not so strong after all. Related Items'"}, "time": 1742563724.89963}
