[Prison officials at the Marco Aurelio Soto prison were not exactly sure when the escape happened, but believed it to be sometime during the week of May 8, TeleSUR reported.  \u201cPrisoners were locked up in the special \u2018Scorpion\u2019 unit for members of the notorious Barrio 18 gang, one of the strongest organized crime groups in Central America,\u201d TeleSUR noted. Officials did not realize that the prisoners had escaped until days later when custodians noticed they were gone. Rosa Gudiel, the head of the National Penitentiary Institute, said in a news conference that the escape happened because the prisoners wanted to avoid going to a new facility. \u201cThe prisoners fled because arrangements are being made to transfer them to new,   jails and they don\u2019t want to go to those places,\u201d Gudiel said. Due to previous prison breaks, Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez ordered the military to guard the country\u2019s largest prisons. Marco Aurelio Soto prison, located just north of Honduras\u2019 capital city of Tegucigalpa, is reportedly the country\u2019s most   prison with 17, 000 inmates occupying a space designed to house 8, 000. Prison officials keep Barrio 18 gang members in special facilities that are equipped to handle violence and criminal activities common among prison gangs.
