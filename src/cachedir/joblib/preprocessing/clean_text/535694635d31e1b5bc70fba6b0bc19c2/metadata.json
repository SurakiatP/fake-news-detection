Wolf a contentious measure that would block public officials from immediately releasing the names of officers involved in such incidents. \\nThe measure, sponsored by State Rep. Martina White (R., Phila.) and approved by the GOP-controlled legislature, stoked sharp opinions. \\nSupporters say the bill, supported by local police unions, is necessary to protect officers and their families after such incidents. \\n\u201cWe are the protectors of our protectors,\u201d said one proponent, State Rep. Dom Costa (D., Allegheny), a former Pittsburgh police chief. \\nOpponents said the bill flies in the face of transparency, which they believe is critical in police-involved shootings. \\n\u201cDo not undermine the bridges that have been built between law enforcement and communities of color,\u201d Rep. Margo Davidson (D., Delaware) said in a floor debate. \u201cThis legislation will do nothing but breed suspicion.\u201d \\nWolf has not said whether he will sign the bill. Civil libertarians said a law could be the first of its kind in the United States. \\nState law now lets local officials determine when to publicly identify an officer who has used force. \\nUnder the legislation, public officials would be barred from releasing the name of an officer involved in a shooting until 30 days after the incident, or after an official investigation into it ends. Violators could be charged with a second-degree misdemeanor. \\nThe Attorney General\u2019s Office and district attorneys would be exempt. \\nThe law would supersede current policy in Philadelphia, where the Police Department typically discloses names of officers involved in shootings within 72 hours if there are no credible threats to those officers. A department spokesman on Thursday would say only that if the bill became law, Philadelphia police would follow it. \\nThe Pittsburgh Police Department generally does not identify officers involved in shootings unless they are charged with a crime. Officer Robert Swartzwelder, president of the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 1 there, called the proposal fair. \\n\u201cThere\u2019s an obligation by society to protect its police officers as well,\u201d he said. \u201cThe police put their lives on the line to protect the public, and they don\u2019t lose their rights because they put on a badge.\u201d \\nElizabeth Pittinger, executive director of the Pittsburgh Citizen Police Review Board, a city-funded independent watchdog, called the bill chilling. \u201cGagging a public official from disclosing a police officer\u2019s identity and then criminalizing a public official\u2019s accountability to the public is outrageous,\u201d she said. \\nCritics also complained that Republican legislators pushed through a controversial measure on their last expected voting day without a full airing. \\nWhite\u2019s bill was approved, 151-32, with many Philadelphia-area lawmakers against it. In the Senate, it passed 39-9. \\nThe legislature has enough votes to override a Wolf veto, but would have to take the unusual step of reconvening for votes after Election Day to do so.'"}, "time": 1742564328.6762595}
