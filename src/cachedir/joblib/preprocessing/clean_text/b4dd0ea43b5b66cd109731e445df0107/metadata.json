God, that\u2019s all we need; a video of an adorable pug hurting itself,\u201d parent Dermot Ferry shared with WWN, only making himself upset. \\nThe Nation said that if a video of a suitably uplifting dog couldn\u2019t be found, it was willing to settle for a video of baby laughing at its own hiccups or just a hug from someone.'"}, "time": 1742564437.8790858}
