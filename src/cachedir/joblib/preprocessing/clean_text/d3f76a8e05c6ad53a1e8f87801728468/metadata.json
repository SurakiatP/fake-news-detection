Somewhat more Republicans express trust in government today than did so prior to the election, while views among Democrats have moved in the opposite direction. For the first time since George W. Bush\u2019s presidency, Republicans (28%) are more likely than Democrats (15%) to say they can trust the government in Washington to do the right thing just about always or most of the time. The number of Americans who describe their feeling toward the federal government as \u201cfrustrated\u201d were in the majority at 55 percent. This compares with 22 percent who chose \u201cangry\u201d and only 19 percent who said they are \u201cbasically content. \u201d Confidence in the country\u2019s future also reflects partisan attitudes, Pew reported.  Overall, 41 percent of Americans say they have \u201cquite a lot\u201d of confidence in the future of the U. S. while 30% have some confidence. The number who say they have \u201clittle or no confidence\u201d is 28 percent, up from 15 percent in the fall of 2015. Since then, the share of Republicans expressing quite a lot of confidence in the nation\u2019s future has increased 19 percentage points  \u2014   from 40% to 59%  \u2014    while falling 22 points among Democrats  \u2014   50% to 28%. Pew Research Center conducted the survey between April   with 1, 501 adults participating.'"}, "time": 1742561650.3769782}
