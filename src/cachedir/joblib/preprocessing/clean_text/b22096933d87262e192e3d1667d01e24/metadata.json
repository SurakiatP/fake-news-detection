{"duration": 0.4317903518676758, "input_args": {"text": "'The way the lawyer William Timmons described the case, it was practically a newsreel melodrama, with a helpless widow being menaced by a heartless tycoon. The story began with the widow, whose name is Yolanda Signorelli von Braunhut. She is a onetime heir to the considerable fortune still generated by her husband Harold\u2019s iconic invention, Amazing Live  . As her lawyer told it, she was now isolated,   often without electricity or running water on a palatial estate on the Potomac River in southern Maryland. Having retreated to a single room in the old mansion, she was prepping for her second freezing winter, barricaded by thick quilts, her bed next to a fireplace stocked with split wood. From this bunker, Signorelli von Braunhut has been waging legal combat against Sam Harwell, chief executive of a   toy company whose name seems straight out of a Chuck Jones cartoon: Big Time Toys. In his tiny office in Sayville, on Long Island, Timmons spoke in clipped,   tones, handing me a   summary of the case, eager to   the plotline. \u201cThe heart and soul of this case is trademark infringement,\u201d he said. Signorelli von Braunhut \u201cbelieves in the concept of justice,\u201d he continued, \u201cand when you have that on your side, then you can get through the day. \u201d A few years after her husband\u2019s death in 2003, Signorelli von Braunhut licensed out part of the labor of his multimillion dollar   enterprise, mostly packaging and distribution, to Big Time. If you\u2019ve ever been 8 years old, then you know that   arrive in a small plastic aquarium with several small packets that include the tiny   critters, which reanimate once you add water  \u2014   by way of a secret formula that Signorelli von Braunhut keeps locked in a vault in Manhattan. The original deal held that Big Time would supply everything except the specially engineered critters  \u2014   and the accompanying packets, which von Braunhut would manufacture and sell separately to Big Time, which would then bundle the full kits and handle the sales. Also in the contract was a second deal  \u2014   to buy the company, including the secret formula. It allowed Big Time to pay a   $5 million fee and then $5 million more in installments. Three winters ago, Big Time called up the widow and announced that it considered its previous payments for the packets to be a kind of layaway deal for the company and that, as far as Big Time was concerned, it now owned the   franchise. Signorelli von Braunhut first sued in 2013, and last year Timmons filed a further complaint accusing Big Time of breach of contract and trademark infringement. Big Time\u2019s national law firm, Epstein Becker  Green, sent me a statement denying any wrongdoing and claiming instead that the widow improperly terminated the contract. In a particularly contemporary twist to the melodrama, Big Time\u2019s court filings revealed that it was now buying knockoff   from China. \u201cThis is a David and Goliath story,\u201d Timmons said, only \u201cwithout a slingshot. \u201d Timmons shrugged as if to invite me to look around. His office is, to be generous, snug. There was barely enough room for me. It was surprising that the door doesn\u2019t bang his desk as in that Alan Cumming gag from this season\u2019s \u201cThe Good Wife. \u201d Timmons is a tall, thin man with some Nicolas   to him. At times he seemed uninterested, not so much in   but maybe in the law in general, or just in the wanton quotidian reality into which we are all born. Our conversation easily swerved off topic and into, say, a debate about Bill Maher\u2019s atheism, or about how \u201cwe are all individuals at the tail end of a universe expressing itself,\u201d or Timmons\u2019s rock band, which plays in the local bars under changing names like Rainbow Bridge and Dreamworld. He likes \u201crenaissance\u201d rock. \u201cIt\u2019s a convergence  \u2014   Lennonesque with Hendrix overtones and some Dylan, maybe \u2018dinosauric\u2019 at this point,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s altruistic, seeking the higher ground instead of just lamenting upon the human condition. \u201d Timmons represents Yolanda Signorelli von Braunhut because years ago he used to go to this legendary Halloween party hosted by a    opera singer known as Maestro Signorelli, a Bohemian possessed of \u201cthis   field of energy. \u201d The grand patriarch of a bustling family, Signorelli taught bel canto to locals determined to improve their coloratura. His annual Halloween masked ball attracted hundreds of \u201cmusicians, dancers and artists,\u201d all of whom came in their most flamboyant costumes. Some attended, if only to meet one of his five beautiful daughters. The   Yolanda, was particularly stunning and began a film career in the  . She played Lorilie in the 1967 bondage classic \u201cVenus in Furs\u201d  \u2014   based on the Leopold von   novel of that name, as well as various minxes in \u201cAll Women Are Bad,\u201d \u201cToo Much Too Often!\u201d \u201cDeath of a Nymphette\u201d and \u201cAssignment: Female. \u201d I watched three of them, for research, and was struck mostly by how these films appeared long before the phrase \u201cmoney shot\u201d entered the lexicon and the director\u2019s mandatory scene list. When I finally screwed up the courage to ask Signorelli von Braunhut about her previous career, she casually said: \u201cIn those days, they might have been racy, but today? I don\u2019t think so. \u201d Which is true. If anything, her brief movie career looks presciently campy  \u2014   less like porn than like a Mike Myers parody titled, \u201cCool It Baby\u201d (which is also the title of a 1967 Signorelli von Braunhut film). On paper, including the legal summary Timmons gave me, the issues of Yolanda von Braunhut v. Big Time Toys might be technical  \u2014   breach of contract, sure  \u2014   until you find yourself reading affidavits that suggest this could be one of those unusual contests, not of law but of meaning  \u2014   maybe not the tail end of a universe expressing itself, but definitely one that leads into that lively place between ordinary truth and hopeful dreams and all the way to the essential contradiction at the core of the American character. As it happened, Signorelli von Braunhut was visiting Long Island that very afternoon to see her sister. We met at Timmons\u2019s office and then walked down to the Aegean Cafe (\u201cSteaks Seafood Pasta\u201d) on Main Street for a luncheon. Von Braunhut is a very good looking woman whose age I was just too chicken to ask. But if she was 18, as she told me, when she started her film career in 1966, then she\u2019s about 70 now. She is trim and   looking in skintight jeans and an equally engaged   top, reminiscent of the ageless Sophia Loren or Raquel Welch. She has an artful muss of dark hair framing a smile that\u2019s slow to form but amplified by flirtatious eyes that sparkled at the end of each sentence. Over a salad, she said she was eager for me to understand the inventive genius of her husband, Harold. Beginning in the 1950s and \u201960s, he took out patents on 196 different inventions, gadgets and toys. That whole last page of zany novelties found in comic books for years was the domain of Harold von Braunhut. He also raced motorcycles under the name the Green Hornet. He was a sometime television producer and the agent for one of those guys who   into a wading pool with 12 inches of water. He was a magician who worked under the name the Great Telepo. She said he also invented the     \u2014   a device into which you punched your destination in New York City, and the machine told you the fastest subway route  \u2014   half a century before Google Maps.   were von Braunhut\u2019s most lucrative toy (and still are: In 2006, according to the filings in this lawsuit, sales were $3. 4 million). Part of what made   successful was a scientific breakthrough Harold von Braunhut claimed he achieved in the early years. In 1960, after observing the success of Uncle Milton\u2019s Ant Farm, von Braunhut first started shipping Instant Life  \u2014   simple brine shrimp that could travel in their natural state of suspended animation. This was the era when a good idea with smart marketing was the dream: D. F. Duncan\u2019s   George Parker\u2019s Monopoly game, Ruth Handler\u2019s Barbie. Around the same time, the   toy company of the day,   started selling a similar product called Instant Fish, which was an immediate dud. \u201cThey didn\u2019t work because the formula wasn\u2019t thought through properly,\u201d Signorelli von Braunhut said.  \u2019s product was actually African killifish, which were supposed to come back to life when rehydrated. But they didn\u2019t. \u201cSo it really hurt sales for Harold, too. \u201d  \u2019s 1960 failure led von Braunhut to reintroduce his creation with new science and a new concept. He worked with a marine biologist named Anthony D\u2019Agostino, and using a process he flamboyantly called superhomeogenation, they created a hybrid brine shrimp that could more easily survive the United States Postal Service and be more likely to flourish after reanimation. They worked with the   species artemia salina, and because they made their breakthrough at Montauk\u2019s NYOSL, the New York Ocean Science Laboratory they called their new hybrid artemia \u201cnyos. \u201d (I contacted D\u2019Agostino at his home, but his wife said he was seriously ill and couldn\u2019t come to the phone.) According to Richard Pell, who maintains an aquarium of   at the Center for PostNatural History in Pittsburgh (alongside displays about    goats and other attractions) \u201cThey were selectively bred in the early \u201970s so that they would have this extra long dormant cycle in their egg state, and they were able to increase that yield so that you get that satisfying swarm. \u201d Pell admits he\u2019s worried these days. \u201cThe new ones come from China,\u201d he said, \u201cand they are technically not   because they don\u2019t come from that original culture developed by Harold and Dr. D\u2019Agostino. \u201d Over coffee, Signorelli von Braunhut talked about this formula for altering the shrimp as one of her husband\u2019s greatest scientific breakthroughs, his greatest invention. Timmons himself jumped in to add that Harold\u2019s genius was with \u201cthe science to get them to live for a prolonged period of time. \u201d She agreed and said, \u201cYes, he went through tremendous efforts to make sure that they  \u2014   should I elaborate on that?\u201d and then Timmons said, abruptly, no. Whenever the science came up, in fact, Timmons shooed me away. Signorelli von Braunhut met her husband in the late 1960s, when she happened to be in the audience for a taping of a television program he was producing for the magician Joseph Dunninger. \u201cHarold was such an exciting person,\u201d Signorelli von Braunhut said, explaining why she set her movie career aside. \u201cShow business was kind of a tough thing, and I am not into all that myself. I liked being around Harold and the  . \u201d So she went to work for him, and later they married. While Dunninger has been largely forgotten, the couple\u2019s fortuitous meeting on his set came at a crucial juncture in the development of American magic and marketing. Dunninger served as a bridge that led away from live performance  \u2014   dating to   vaudevillian stagecraft  \u2014   and toward the small stage of television, where magic was more patter than prestidigitation, more pizazz than performance. Harold von Braunhut was the perfect person to attend to this shift, as he was, in a sense, a kind of marketing Jedi master. Remember Amazing   Monsters (a bald troll printed on a card that grew green mineral locks when watered)? That was von Braunhut\u2019s, and although his novelty toys were, once they arrived, a bit disappointing, the marketing of them was a wonder of what we\u2019d all come to know as informercialism. His Crazy Crabs were nothing more than hermit crabs in a little cardboard box, but the ad copy described another world: \u201cAs gentle as a pussycat, it lives on LAND instead of water, DOES NOT BITE unless mishandled. \u201d And: \u201cIt loves to be touched and petted, and enjoys running from hand to hand, swinging from your fingers or just cuddling on your shoulder like an adorable tame parrot. \u201d With   von Braunhut took his marketing to new levels. He spun off numerous whimsical books with all kinds of imaginary advice for caring for the tiny critters. You could coddle them with   \u201cBanana Treat\u201d or \u201cCupids Arrow\u201d Mating Powder. (Inside joke for the arthropodologists:   don\u2019t always need mates.) There were timely variations of the toy. There was a Space   kit, and a   Speedway that deployed giant eyedroppers to create racecourses. The same equipment was repurposed into kits for       Fox Hunt and   Mystery  . In 1992, CBS broadcast a   TV show starring, naturally, Howie Mandel. To this day, there is a website for   zealots, who exchange   lore and kitschy enthusiasms. What made Braunhut\u2019s work so edgy, so American, was just how wickedly far he\u2019d journey  \u2014   far past the product itself  \u2014   into the fictional. I remember   Spex (also von Braunhut\u2019s) with that promise of seeing girls naked beneath their clothes, as my first shattering disillusionment with the world of adults and all their horrible lies. Signorelli von Braunhut told me that Harold\u2019s purest novelty was his Invisible Goldfish. \u201cIt was a glass bowl with some sea plants,\u201d she said, \u201cand a sign that said, \u2018Invisible Goldfish: Do Not Feed. \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d The kit came with a printed guarantee that you\u2019d never see them. Not everyone appreciated the joke. In the 1970s, at the height of a nationwide focus on consumer protection, New York\u2019s attorney general, Louis Lefkowitz, went after von Braunhut. \u201cThe suit against Harold by Louie Lefkowitz,\u201d Signorelli von Braunhut said, \u201cargued that   were fraudulent, because it\u2019s a fantasy. \u201d A federal judge who reviewed Lefkowitz\u2019s case was amused by the attorney general\u2019s intense concern. According to the judge, Lefkowitz argued that the novelty\u2019s marketing included von Braunhut\u2019s claim that \u201c  are covered by \u2018Limited Group   Life Insurance Policy. \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d Lefkowitz demanded that von Braunhut cease \u201cthe usage of the name \u2018 \u2019 in the sale of brine shrimp\u201d because they \u201cwere not miniature monkeys, and are not a miracle or anything new scientifically. \u201d Finally, Lefkowitz beseeched the courts to \u201cenjoin the issuance of insurance policies covering \u2018 . \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d In the legal record, it\u2019s not clear that Lefkowitz got any further than this legalistic tantrum, but Signorelli von Braunhut remembers a judge\u2019s coming down on the side of whimsy. \u201c  were vindicated,\u201d she said. The judge compared the issue to \u201csponge cake  \u2014   it\u2019s not a sponge and butterflies are not made of butter. \u201d But apparently, this fundamental question about   was not settled. In the scores of files that have already been entered into court for the current litigation, one is an affidavit by Sam Harwell, the chief executive of Big Time Toys. He is a very powerful man in Nashville, not only because he owns a   toy company but also because his wife, Beth Harwell, is the speaker of the Tennessee House of Representatives. Harwell declined to return my phone calls, but Big Time has continued to sell   to Walmart and Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, even after Yolanda claimed a breach of contract and quit sending out the specially formulated shrimp. In this affidavit, Harwell explains precisely why he outsourced his   to China. He declares that there are seven recognized species of artemia brine shrimp and that artemia nyos \u201cclaimed by plaintiffs is not one of them,\u201d because it is a hybrid. Regular old,   brine shrimp  \u2014   at least in terms of their size and life expectancy  \u2014   \u201care indistinguishable from the pouches supplied by plaintiffs. \u201d In essence, Harwell is making a kind of existential case about the fundamentals of American marketing, and a familiar one. He\u2019s practically picking up where Lefkowitz left off by arguing that there is no there there,   . It\u2019s all part of the confidence game. Part of the sham. It\u2019s humbug. And if the issues in Harwell\u2019s affidavit go forward, then that is what may be on trial. Humbug. When P. T. Barnum, the great   impresario of public entertainment (and   of the Barnum  Bailey Circus) popularized that word  \u2014   \u201chumbug\u201d  \u2014   he was talking exactly about things like  . Most assume, as Harwell might, that the word is synonymous with total nonsense and absolute fraud. But that overgeneralization misses Barnum\u2019s sly nuance. \u201cHumbug\u201d is not a lie, the great promoter used to say: \u201cNo humbug is great without truth at bottom. \u201d It\u2019s unfair to say that Barnum peddled pure fantasy. Great humbug simply took off from a small truth and used that to show people what they wanted to see. In his own way, P. T. Barnum was the greatest cognitive scientist of the 19th century. He understood that when you pit humbug against harsh cold reality, reality doesn\u2019t stand a chance. Knowing this explains so much  \u2014   World Wrestling, Taco Bell, Donald Trump. Humbug is as American as   apple pie. Which is why   are involved in a lawsuit now and why Barnum got tangled up in one in his time, litigating the nature of humbug. The case involved one of the biggest tourist attractions after the Civil War: the 1869 discovery of the Cardiff Giant in a little town of that name near Syracuse. Just as nowadays, there was an argument between rationalists and people of faith about the science of the Bible, in this case, whether the giants described in the Scriptures were real. (People forget that the reason God flooded the entire earth during the time of Noah is that angels and humans kept having lots of illicit sex and inadvertently created a race of deranged giants.) At the time, \u201cfossil\u201d had become one of the buzzwords in the popular battle between Darwinian scientists and angry pastors. So a cigar maker named George Hull thought it would be entertaining to fabricate a fossil of one of Noah\u2019s giants. He had a   man secretly sculpted, treated it to look old and then buried it in rural New York State, where he contrived to have it found. Instantly, massive crowds of astounded Christians started pouring into town, eager to see biblical proof in the petrified man with the    feet and the   nose and all the other proportionate appendages. Hull made lots of money charging 50 cents a viewing. But as his wealth grew, he became nervous that the hoax would blow up. So he sold the Cardiff Giant to a consortium of businessmen, headed by a man named David Hannum. P. T. Barnum instantly offered the consortium $50, 000 to buy the Cardiff Giant, no doubt convinced that humbug of this magnitude really deserved his marketing skills. Hannum declined, but he clearly did not appreciate just whom he was up against. Barnum had his own copy carved and rushed his giant to New York City. At one point the fake giant and the knockoff fake giant were being exhibited two blocks from each other. Barnum\u2019s marketing drew much larger crowds. And even as Hull, the original forger, publicly confessed that the original Giant was a fake, Hannum took Barnum to court. The judge, of course, ruled in favor of Barnum  \u2014   you can\u2019t be sued for calling a fake a fake. Humbug won, and the Giants toured for years afterward. Before the judge\u2019s 1870 ruling, Hannum still believed in his giant\u2019s authenticity and fumed about the popularity of Barnum\u2019s, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s a sucker born every minute. \u201d Many mistakenly ascribe the remark to P. T. Barnum himself. And it\u2019s understandable. The quote has a way of making complete sense, no matter which side you\u2019re on. A few weeks after lunch with Signorelli von Braunhut, I visited the grand estate built by   south of the nation\u2019s capital just off a road called Hard Bargain. Large metal gates decorated with prancing     open to a number of No Trespassing signs. About a mile down the road, it turned into farmland, with a barn and a scalloped wood bridge decorated with large festive red bows crossing a pond gleaming with bright chartreuse scum. From the trees, like a visual illusion, a large brick house emerges. Nearby, a small array of propane generators thrums. Inside, Yolanda Signorelli von Braunhut greeted me warmly. She invited me into her kitchen, where a propane heater was at work, a Coleman cooler held her comestibles and a camping stove heated us up some tea. A large yellow bird in the kitchen hopped around, upset. \u201cThat\u2019s Josephine, a cockatoo who flew into my window in New York in 1981,\u201d she said as she fixed vegan snacks and recommended some antioxidizing super plant protein called Wild Force Green Formula. \u201cIt helps you \u201d she said. Through a hallway crowded with scores of smiling angel dolls and various cherubim, we parted a few warming curtains to the living room and entered a cabinet of wonders. Whimsies abounded  \u2014   on the table beside me, a Snow White lamp, a Bambi figurine,   bobble heads. On the wall there was a painting of her mother, whose   beauty seems familiar. \u201cI met the artist for Superman,\u201d Signorelli von Braunhut said. \u201cHe had a few Lois Lane models, and she was one of them. \u201d Signorelli von Braunhut was dressed in tight jeans with a d\u00e9colletage Guess top. Josephine perched on her shoulder for the duration of my visit, occasionally striking Angry Bird poses and voicing some shrewd concern at my queries. Signorelli von Braunhut elaborated about what happened after the   Instant Fish disaster. That was when her husband changed the name from Instant Life and started marketing them as Amazing Live  . Joe Orlando, who would later achieve fame at DC Comics and Mad Magazine, illustrated the cover art. The image itself is famous. You know it: a   family with three antennas wagging on their heads and long paddle tails lounging outside their underwater castle. Von Braunhut took his new marketing to the back page of comics  \u2014   the one place where he could bypass parental skepticism and speak directly to children\u2019s imaginations. His campaign was a textbook case of what we now call \u201ccognitive priming. \u201d That is, the deep cerebral desire we all have to see what we expect to see. So when you buy a   kit, you get the tiny plastic aquarium and fitted into the sides are little magnifying lenses that enhance the tiny brine shrimp just enough, setting off a little motion picture in your head of   primates swinging to and fro by their curved tails, gamboling in a watery jungle. The real innovation may never have been the secret formula of his brine shrimp but the cognitive ignition of those four perfect words of distilled humbuggery: Amazing Live  . That alone might well have been enough to loft Harold von Braunhut into the pantheon of toy inventors, alongside Uncle Milton Levine, D. F. Duncan and George Parker. Except for one almost unimaginable and horrible thing. Harold von Braunhut was a  . Moreover, a Jewish  . He was born Harold Nathan Braunhut, to Jewish parents. He inserted the \u201cvon\u201d to sound more Germanic. Von Braunhut even indulged his dark side with one particular invention  \u2014   the Kiyoga, a retractable baton for   also known as the Steel Cobra. When Richard Butler, the head of Aryan Nations, was indicted in the late \u201980s, he encouraged his supporters to buy Kiyogas because the \u201cmanufacturer had made a pledge of $25 to my defense fund for each one sold to Aryan Nations supporters. \u201d After an   League report emerged, von Braunhut refused to answer any more questions and was known to simply slam down the phone when any reporter called him. His background is the source of great remorse on marketing chat boards, where writers are distraught that someone as visionary as the   Spex and   guy could be such a racist head case. \u201cI came close to writing a biography,\u201d wrote a contributor known as Kierkegaard, but found it would be too \u201cdifficult to write a sympathetic account due to his political views. \u201d Apparently there are some realities that marketing can\u2019t obscure. Signorelli von Braunhut grew quiet, even sad, when I brought up this subject. There are calculated silences at the heart of any marriage, and this was definitely one. \u201cHarold and I never really talked about things like that,\u201d she told me. \u201cWe just really loved each other, and I didn\u2019t question him or interrogate him. \u201d She said, \u201cI am very inclusive with everybody\u201d and \u201cthat\u2019s why I live on a farm with all kinds of animals and try to impact the earth in the least possible way and try to live a peaceful, happy, loving life. \u201d She handed me an     kit on the way out the door. On the drive home, I stopped by Walmart and found the Big Time version. The container makes no mystery of the fact that this is a product of China. So I conducted an experiment  \u2014   setting up both kits at precisely the same time and with the same water. Von Braunhut\u2019s kit had extra packets to keep the water stable. Big Time\u2019s kit seemed very stripped down. On the day that the shrimp reanimated, there was really no comparison. Von Braunhut\u2019s produced hundreds of   which  \u2014   I have to say  \u2014   are still irritatingly tiny after all these years. Big Time\u2019s tank was very quiet by comparison, requiring a lot of squinting and really good light for the embedded magnifiers to offer a fleeting glance of one or two drifting by. It also felt odd that, for a company that broke with von Braunhut years ago, Big Time enclosed literature that still offered such Haroldian extras as \u201cSea Medic\u201d   Medicine, \u201cCupids Arrow\u201d Mating Powder and the   \u201c . \u201d Despite Big Time\u2019s court claims of buying plain old brine shrimp from China, the enclosure boasts that \u201cafter years of crossbreeding, we developed a hybrid,\u201d and \u201cThese amazing new hybrids grow larger and live longer than any \u2018natural\u2019 variety of brine shrimp. \u201d (Big Time had no comment when asked about its use of natural or hybrid artemia, and dismissed my test as \u201cnot reliable. \u201d) The last item on Big Time\u2019s pamphlet was especially surprising. In small print, it urged its new   owners to earn a DLD degree (Doctor of Denizens of the Deep) by writing directly to the Crustacean College of   Knowledge. It then lists the Maryland address of the   estate where Yolanda Signorelli von Braunhut lives in her   room and answers   mail by firelight.'"}, "time": 1742563860.1353176}
