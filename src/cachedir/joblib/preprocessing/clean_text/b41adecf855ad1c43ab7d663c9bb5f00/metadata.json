This Ken Bone of our imaginations was born on Sunday, during a presidential debate, when the American public saw him and decided that he was more important than whatever those two nameless individuals running for president had to say. The real Ken Bone is still alive and well, of course. To prove it, he has tried, like any enterprising American, to capitalize on the country\u2019s feverish, bewildering affection by accepting some sort of sponsorship deal from Uber, creating his own \u201cBone Zone\u201d   line, and conducting an interview with the people of Reddit on Thursday. Judging from his active account history and the breadth of Mr. Bone\u2019s discussions, they are his sort of people. The media coverage has been so intense that it inspired one journalist to write existential poetry. In just a few short days, Mr. Bone broke Chewbacca Mom\u2019s   record for permeating our consciousness. But the pendulum of adoration must always swing back, it seems. Chewbacca Mom, whose real name is a lot less fun to say than \u201cKen Bone\u201d or \u201cBone Zone,\u201d made the transformation in the eyes of some to a symbol of racial privilege, or maybe an avatar of our modern tendency to award provocative people with gross amounts of money for doing very little. It all depended on who was watching, who was writing, and what they felt. Now the bell tolls for Mr. Bone. It is Mr. Bone\u2019s turn to show the world that he is a flawed person  \u2014   a human, even  \u2014   who decided to take the ride when   was given to him. He might also now be forced to acknowledge that he has said and done things that are bad, unpopular or even illegal. And the rest of us, in our indignant perfection, will shake our heads and tweet about it. As Mr. Bone conducted his Ask Me Anything session on Reddit, reporters at Gizmodo  \u2014   a site literally hours ahead of anyone else in revealing the supposed badness of Mr. Bone   \u2014   and their counterparts at The Daily Dot and The Daily Beast soon ferreted out Mr. Bone\u2019s past Reddit history, finding tidbits that were sure to provoke somebody. It seems Mr. Bone had engaged in a discussion of his sex life after having undergone a vasectomy. Using the pseudonym StanGibson18, he had revealed that he enjoyed viewing the nude photos of the actress Jennifer Lawrence (that were, for the record, posted online without her consent). He also commented on pictures of scantily clad women on the Bodyperfection and RealGirls subreddits. \u201cBeautiful human submarines,\u201d he wrote on a post about pregnant women in an    subreddit called PreggoPorn. Before anyone knew his real name, he had decided to tell Reddit about the most illegal thing he said he\u2019s ever done, by claiming that he had once forged car insurance documents to keep his job as a pizza delivery driver. And four months ago, Mr. Bone summed up the 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman as a \u201cjustified\u201d episode: \u201cBad guy legally kills kid in self defense. Sucks for everybody,\u201d he wrote, before blaming the news media. Under this Reddit account, Mr. Bone was a semiregular commenter, with about 150 comments made over the course of the year, not including the flurry of posts he made during his A. M. A. He posted about gun control and his job as an operator at a coal plant in Illinois. He voiced support for President Obama but said that he himself was \u201ca pretty conservative guy. \u201d What else? He enjoys video games, is O. K. with calling himself \u201cfat and bald,\u201d and once offered words of comfort to a survivor of rape. \u201cYour value has not changed due his words,\u201d he wrote to that person, \u201cor any assault you have endured. You are still valuable. \u201d Quite a mixed bag. But in this world of online   only extremes break through. The echo chamber doesn\u2019t do nuance. On Friday, Mr. Bone\u2019s voice mail box was full. He did not reply to a text message, but he did eventually answer email questions about the criticism of his old anonymous comments on Trayvon Martin and Jennifer Lawrence. \u201cIf you read the whole post on the Trayvon Martin tragedy you\u2019ll see that I said based on what I read, which was the release from the D. O. J. the shooting was ruled as legally justified,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt was also an awful thing to happen. Just because it was legal does not mean it was right. I wish Trayvon were still alive. \u201d (The Department of Justice said that the evidence surrounding the case did not meet the law\u2019s high standard for prosecuting   crimes.) On his posts about Ms. Lawrence, he had this to say: \u201cIt was a joke in poor taste made from my former anonymity. I take full responsibility for saying it. I wholeheartedly apologize and wish I could do so to her directly. \u201d Now that he is the opposite of anonymous, Mr. Bone would like everyone to know something: \u201cMy message has been one about elevating the level of conversation, and if I want to hold our leaders accountable for their words then I must be accountable for mine. \u201d In a later email, Mr. Bone ended this long and strange week by saying that his insurance fraud comments had been a fabrication: \u201cThat was a made up story, and even in the story no documents were passed to law enforcement. They were used for employment. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562526.288461}
