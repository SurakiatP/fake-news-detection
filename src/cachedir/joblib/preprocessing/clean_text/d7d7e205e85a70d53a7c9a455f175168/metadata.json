{"duration": 0.2152242660522461, "input_args": {"text": "'In the first episode of \u201cOne Day at a Time,\u201d Netflix\u2019s reboot of the   Norman Lear sitcom, Penelope (Justina Machado) has an argument with her    son, Alex (Marcel Ruiz) who wants an expensive new pair of sneakers. \u201cMom,\u201d he says, \u201cI know we\u2019re not rich. But are we poor?\u201d It\u2019s a casual line that sets up a joke. (Penelope reminds Alex that they have a TV, a refrigerator and a laptop. \u201cThose are things poor people have!\u201d he says.) But it\u2019s based on an acknowledgment you don\u2019t really hear in prime time anymore: that there is a class divide, nebulous but real, and that your family is closer to the bad side of it. The new \u201cOne Day at a Time,\u201d arriving on Friday, is lively and full of voice, a rare reboot that\u2019s better than the original. It\u2019s a throwback in the best sense, to an era of mainstream, socially engaged   sitcoms. And just as the political debate has pitted diversity against class in a   contest, it\u2019s a reminder that the two aren\u2019t mutually exclusive. In the 1970s, TV was full of characters living paycheck to paycheck, whether cabbies (\u201cTaxi\u201d) waitresses (\u201cAlice\u201d) auto mechanics (\u201cChico and the Man\u201d) or brewery workers (\u201cLaverne and Shirley\u201d). Mr. Lear, the sitcom maestro of the era, produced a suite of shows like this: \u201cAll in the Family,\u201d \u201cGood Times,\u201d \u201cSanford and Son. \u201d Mr. Lear, an   populist liberal, made   TV about the little guy. In part, the programming reflected the economy of the time. The average American wage peaked in 1973, and the middle class was broader. But, as income inequality began to grow in the 1980s and \u201990s, TV, like any neighborhood buffeted by market forces, got gentrified. Advertising rates became increasingly tied to audience demographics, which made poorer viewers less valuable. Basic cable fragmented the viewership  \u2014   more shows, made for smaller niches  \u2014   and premium networks like HBO focused on series about the kind of people who could afford to pay for networks like HBO. TV courted upscale audiences by showing them versions of themselves. Goodbye, Roseanne Conner hello, Carrie Bradshaw. With few exceptions (like ABC\u2019s \u201cThe Middle\u201d) sitcoms moved into offices, cafes and living rooms populated by comfortably   characters. (A recent \u201c \u201d slyly acknowledged this remove its affluent parents were mortified when their youngest son took an aptitude test that pegged him as a future \u201cskilled laborer. \u201d) Work  \u2014   nonprofessional,     work  \u2014   became the stuff of   reality TV (\u201cDeadliest Catch\u201d). Just as actual labor became increasingly invisible to consumers, shunted off overseas or hidden through     people entered TV through the poor door, or not at all. With \u201cOne Day at a Time\u201d  \u2014   like \u201cFuller House\u201d and \u201cGilmore Girls,\u201d another product of Netflix\u2019s drive to exhume our every nostalgic memory  \u2014   peak TV is restoring something of what peak TV took away: the kind of family that buys discounted meat at the grocery store and whose old car stalls when you turn on the  . The original \u201cOne Day at a Time,\u201d based on the   Whitney Blake\u2019s experience as a divorced mother, was lighter and more disposable than \u201cAll in the Family. \u201d (I still have warm memories of Mackenzie Phillips and Valerie Bertinelli duetting on \u201cDon\u2019t Go Breaking My Heart,\u201d but let\u2019s not kid ourselves.) But it spoke to the times. Compared with Mr. Lear\u2019s outspoken Maude, Ann Romano (Bonnie Franklin) expressed her feminism practically  \u2014   bouncing from job to job, getting the rent paid and raising two independent girls. (This was in 1975, just five years after it was deemed too outrageous to have Mary Richards be divorced in \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show. \u201d) The update, which Mr. Lear produces with Gloria Calder\u00f3n Kellett and Mike Royce, moves the setting from Indianapolis to Echo Park, Los Angeles, and reimagines the family as  . (Mr. Lear\u2019s   remake of his own work recalls how he adapted the British \u201cSteptoe and Son\u201d as \u201cSanford and Son,\u201d with an   cast.) Gloria Estefan reprises the theme song, now syncopated. There\u2019s a   third generation: a   Rita Moreno as Penelope\u2019s   mother, Lydia. The    daughter, Elena (Isabella Gomez, a charmer) is a school debate champ who sees her coming quincea\u00f1era as a tool of the patriarchy. The omnipresent apartment super, Schneider (Todd Grinnell)  \u2014   played in the original by Pat Harrington, with a mustache that defined \u201970s    \u2014   is now a stubbly   hipster whose dad owns the building. The most productive rethinking involves Penelope, a veteran of Afghanistan who works as a medical assistant. The war ended her marriage  \u2014   she separated from her husband, also a soldier, who developed a drinking problem from stress  \u2014   and left her with anxiety and a bum shoulder. The show understands, in a way comedies about more privileged families don\u2019t have to, that circumstances shape choices and exact costs. Despite the   laughs, the series works best in   dramedy mode. The season has a serial arc, and Ms. Machado (previously of \u201cSix Feet Under\u201d) handles the emotional material with a light touch. One of the strongest episodes is built around a long, frustrating phone call with the Department of Veterans Affairs as Penelope tries to wrangle a chiropractor referral. The   humor is clunkier. Stephen Tobolowsky carries some familiar workplace subplots as Penelope\u2019s   boss, and the show leans heavily on Ricky   jokes about Lydia\u2019s accent. Still, if the comedy can be dated, the retro approach  \u2014   multicamera, theatrical,    \u2014   feels current, as the headlines recall the tumult of the \u201970s and the   seems to be tweeting from Archie Bunker\u2019s armchair. (One of the season\u2019s themes, immigration, lands harder, if differently, from the way it might have before the election.) Of course, one sitcom can represent only so much. Scripted TV still neglects   rural America, though Netflix has lately stepped into that gap with \u201cThe Ranch. \u201d NBC\u2019s affable workplace sitcom \u201cSuperstore\u201d speaks to an economy that, campaign rhetoric aside, is more about service and retail jobs than about assembly lines. Maybe they\u2019ll have company soon: ABC, for instance, is talking about making its programming more    after the election. If efforts like this manage to find us the next \u201cRoseanne,\u201d that\u2019s all good. But the new \u201cOne Day at a Time,\u201d which arrives while Hispanic TV families are still a rarity, also casually refutes the lazy postelection punditry that \u201c \u201d is a euphemism for \u201cwhite,\u201d that there is an   choice between the \u201cidentity politics\u201d of representing the underrepresented and a   focus on people\u2019s economic struggles. If TV can help divided Americans see one another better, it\u2019s by telling more specific stories of every kind. It\u2019s true that we don\u2019t see enough   people on TV, or military veterans or Hispanic families. And guess what? Sometimes, this \u201cOne Day at a Time\u201d reminds us, you find all those people under the same roof.'"}, "time": 1742562180.5669107}
