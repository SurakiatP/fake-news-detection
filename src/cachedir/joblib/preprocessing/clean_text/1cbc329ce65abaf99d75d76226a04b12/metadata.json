Silence may not be Frank Ocean\u2019s greatest gift, but it\u2019s one the RB singer has wielded effectively for most of the four years since his last album, \u201cChannel Orange. \u201d The reactions to his evaporation from public life have been most intriguing to watch  \u2014   his denial has been seen as a necessary balm against the scrutiny of fame, and then, after a while, a sort of insult, and finally, in the   to his   projects, a possible sign of failure on the horizon. Lest you mistake the silence of creative gestation for the silence of lethargy, Mr. Ocean has now swapped scarcity for abundance. Since Thursday, he has released, in effect, two new albums  \u2014   \u201cBlonde\u201d and a \u201cvisual album\u201d called \u201cEndless,\u201d both exclusive to Apple Music  \u2014   a video for the song \u201cNikes,\u201d and an oversize art magazine, Boys Don\u2019t Cry, which includes a CD version of \u201cBlonde\u201d and was made available free at   shops in four cities. Though \u201cEndless,\u201d with its meaningfully slow   video of Mr. Ocean building a staircase, came first, the pairing of \u201cBlonde\u201d and Boys Don\u2019t Cry captures the range of Mr. Ocean\u2019s ambitions and gifts. \u201cBlonde\u201d is dewy, radiant and easeful, with an approach to incantatory soul that evolves moment to moment. It\u2019s feverish but unhurried, a slowly smoldering set that\u2019s emphatic about loneliness. \u201cI couldn\u2019t gauge your   can\u2019t relate to my peers,\u201d Mr. Ocean sings on \u201cSeigfried. \u201d Mr. Ocean writes impressionistically, and sings with a casual sternness, as if sauntering into the studio, smearing out an idea running through his head, then retreating. That\u2019s reflected in the range of vocal approaches he takes on \u201cBlonde\u201d:   exhalation, digitally manipulated childlike singing, forceful spoken word,   rapping, obscured conversation. Mr. Ocean\u2019s previous projects  \u2014   the 2011 mixtape \u201cNostalgia, Ultra\u201d and the 2012 album \u201cChannel Orange\u201d  \u2014   were products of an intuitive songwriter and a singer just getting comfortable with the outer boundaries of his power. \u201cBlonde\u201d and \u201cEndless\u201d show someone willing to forsake that progress in service of perfecting a mood. He excels on the ecstatically relaxed \u201cPink + White\u201d and the mildly    \u201cSelf Control. \u201d On the puppyish \u201cSolo,\u201d he\u2019s as close to content as he gets here mostly, he labors over romantic scenarios that leave him vexed, or worse. So often on this album, he\u2019s pleading for recognition: \u201cI\u2019ll sleep between y\u2019all, it\u2019s nothing\u201d (\u201cSelf Control\u201d) \u201cI\u2019m not him but I\u2019ll mean something to you\u201d (\u201cNikes\u201d). \u201cBlonde\u201d is also not precious about the sanctity of Mr. Ocean\u2019s perspective. It includes a scolding voice mail from a mother (possibly Mr. Ocean\u2019s) to a son a story narrated by the French producer Sebastian about the paranoia of the digital age and a kinetic,   verse from Andr\u00e9 3000 on \u201cSolo (Reprise)\u201d that swallows all the air around it. Yet at the same time, Beyonc\u00e9 and Kendrick Lamar are here, in largely ceremonial roles. (A list of album collaborators appears in the magazine, but full writing and production credits were not immediately made available.) In 2016, the condition and circumstances of an album\u2019s release are integral to its reception. For Beyonc\u00e9, the sudden drop of \u201cLemonade\u201d underscored her militaristic precision for Kanye West, the   album \u201cThe Life of Pablo\u201d reflected his artistic restlessness for Rihanna, the stumbled rollout of \u201cAnti\u201d matched her confident indifference. From a distance, Mr. Ocean\u2019s return came in fits and starts, with release plans hinted at, then abandoned. But what Mr. Ocean has achieved with the complexity of this rollout  \u2014   as well as his ability to mold corporate motives to his benefit  \u2014   is an almost complete reframing of his public narrative. Mr. Ocean is now a photographer. A screenplay writer. An essayist (his Tumblr posts after the Orlando shooting and Prince\u2019s death have been cleareyed and devastatingly felt). And in the video of \u201cEndless,\u201d a carpenter. (One of the more fun artifacts of Mr. Ocean\u2019s absence  \u2014   and there are many  \u2014   was a tweet, recently rediscovered, written in March by a woman who met a man at a bar who boasted of teaching Mr. Ocean how to build a staircase. He wasn\u2019t lying.) Much of this comes in Boys Don\u2019t Cry, which is an impressively polished and elaborate data dump of Mr. Ocean\u2019s nonmusical taste. The aesthetic is decidedly indebted to the peak Tumblr era of a few years ago, a jumble of ideas inspired by the curiosity fostered and satiated by the internet. Over 300 pages long, it includes a   printed with Jenny Holzer\u2019s \u201cTruisms\u201d (which he wears in the \u201cNikes\u201d video) a photo spread of Kanye West picking up McDonald\u2019s at a   in a Lamborghini another photo spread detailing what appear to be the   specifications in the studio of the artist Tom Sachs and what look like internet search histories collected from Mr. Ocean and some of his collaborators. Much of the magazine is given over to the eroticism of the automobile  \u2014   there are photos of Mr. Ocean looking blissful around cars, a spread of racecar drivers deep in thought, a striking photo shoot of nude young Chinese men draped on and in a compact sedan. In an essay at the beginning of the magazine, Mr. Ocean suggests his car fixation might be part of \u201ca deep subconscious straight boy fantasy,\u201d but then adds, \u201cConsciously though, I don\u2019t want straight  \u2014   a little bent is good. \u201d Mr. Ocean announced on his Tumblr in 2012 that when he was 19 he fell in love with a man. Sexual fluidity and ambiguity play key parts in the new projects. The magazine features both nude men and women, and there are small references to gender nonconformity throughout these works: a shot of Mr. Ocean wearing strong eyeliner in the \u201cNikes\u201d video, and another in the middle of a   photo shoot in the magazine or a sample of the drag icon Crystal LaBeija, taken from the documentary \u201cThe Queen,\u201d on \u201cEndless. \u201d And most vividly, his album is called \u201cBlonde,\u201d but its cover reads \u201cblond,\u201d alongside a photo of Mr. Ocean, his short hair dyed neon green  \u2014   the feminine, the masculine, the none of the above. This elasticity extends to the music, which avoids easy formatting, in terms of structure. On this record, there is nothing like \u201cThinkin Bout You,\u201d his biggest hit  \u2014   no song that centers Mr. Ocean\u2019s very real gift for melody. Instead, Mr. Ocean moves from feeling to feeling, hurt to hurt, not stopping long enough to privilege any one moment. On iTunes, you can only buy \u201cBlonde\u201d as a whole, conveniently both a comment on its unity and also a clear commercial tactic  \u2014   with four years in the shadows, Mr. Ocean has perfected the navigation of the intersection of corporate and emotional concerns. This is perhaps the truest way to release music in 2016, especially for an artist who inspires fervor at the level Mr. Ocean does: Use the available tools to fill the vacuum of your own making, not the one made for you. On \u201cFutura Free,\u201d he tells off the world: \u201cI ain\u2019t on your   ain\u2019t on no schedule. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561890.8182445}
