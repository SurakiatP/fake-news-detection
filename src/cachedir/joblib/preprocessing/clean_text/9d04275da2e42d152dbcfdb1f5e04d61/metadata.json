Several of the panels that kept the water back were missing, while others were out of true. Weeks of work stretched before him, compounded by the vagaries of the river. Mr. Helland, 37, is master of Lock and Dam No. 52 on the Ohio River. That makes him responsible for billions of dollars\u2019 worth of cargo and the operation of countless factories, power plants, farms and refineries east of the mighty Mississippi. By extension, then, he is responsible for the livelihoods of millions of Americans. Built in 1929, Lock No. 52 sits in a quiet corner of southern Illinois that happens to be the busiest spot on America\u2019s inland waterways, where traffic from the eastern United States meets and passes traffic from the Gulf Coast and the Mississippi River. More than 80 million tons of grain, coal, fuel and other goods  \u2014   worth over $22 billion  \u2014   move through here each year. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t seem like it, but this is more stressful than when I was in the military,\u201d said Mr. Helland, a farm boy from Wisconsin who worked as an Army welder and machinist in South Korea before he took this job. Lock No. 52 is a serious bottleneck in innumerable supply chains nationwide. It is emblematic of the nation\u2019s crumbling transportation infrastructure coast to coast  \u2014   including locks, ports, highways and railroads.   Donald J. Trump has said he will spend $1 trillion on infrastructure, but how the money will be raised remains unclear. To avoid raising taxes or increasing debt, his plan calls for much of the money to come from the private sector, with a proposed tax credit offered in return. Funding might also come from taxes on repatriated money, as companies receive incentives to return cash that they have been accumulating overseas. Even with a tax credit, though, companies building roads or locks would want a return on their investment  \u2014   most likely in the form of toll collection, said Mike Toohey, president of the Waterways Council, an advocacy group for the river shipping industry. His industry is \u201cnot in favor of a toll,\u201d he said. Still, he is optimistic that spending on inland waterways will increase under a new administration. The average delay at No. 52 in October and November was 15 to 20 hours. At the moment, No. 52\u2019s sister dam downriver, No. 53, is adding 48 more hours to the wait. Dealing with both dams, it can take five days to travel just 100 miles on this stretch of the Ohio River. And if something goes wrong at either one  \u2014   which does happen  \u2014   the delay can build to a week or more. On Sept. 14, for instance, all river traffic stopped for an additional 15 hours while emergency repairs were made to No. 52\u2019s dam. No. 52 and No. 53 have been waiting to be blown up since 1998, when a new   near Olmsted, Ill. was supposed to be finished. Authorized in 1988, the project is now wildly over budget and decades behind schedule. What was supposed to cost $775 million and be finished in 1998 will now most likely cost $2. 9 billion and be operational in October 2018 at the earliest. Capt. David Stansbury was in the pilot house of the towboat William Hank, which was tied to a fleet of barges near Metropolis, Ill. waiting for its turn to pass through 52\u2019s lock. \u201cWhat would happen if both lanes of Interstate 95 were completely shut down for three or four days?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou\u2019re talking total gridlock in a major metropolitan area  \u2014   this is the equivalent of that. \u201d Right now, the inland waterways are out of most Americans\u2019 sights and minds. \u201cIf 52 does fail, or one of the other locks fails, and you cut off half the United States from their barge traffic, then you\u2019ll see a public outcry,\u201d Mr. Stansbury said. He explained: If corn cannot get to the factories, the price of any   product will go up, and people will say, \u201cWhat do you mean I\u2019ve got to pay $10 for a box of cornflakes? Are you out of your mind?\u201d A towboat and its barges need at least nine feet of water to stay afloat. To guarantee this depth from, say, Pittsburgh to Cairo, Ill. a distance of 980 miles, the United States Army Corps of Engineers built dams. The dams make pools. Each pool is like a step, climbing from sea level to the Appalachians, say, or St. Paul. To get from one step to another, boats use water elevators, called locks, that raise anything that floats from one pool to another. Before the locks and dams, many rivers in the United States were low enough to walk across during dry months. On an overcast September morning, the William Hank was pushing 13 barges  \u2014   two tankers of soybean oil, one barge of dry cement, one barge of aluminum ingots, three barges of scrap steel, four barges of iron ingots, one barge of wheat and one of grain  \u2014   a total of 19, 200 tons of cargo, worth around $6. 5 million. Most towboats push a   tow, which holds the equivalent of 225 train cars or 1, 050 truckloads. There is a lot at stake when this much stuff is late. In a low   building on the outskirts of Paducah, Ky. are the offices of Tennessee Valley Towing, which owns the William Hank. Gordon Southern, the company\u2019s senior vice president, calculated that the   river closure on Sept. 14 cost him around $80, 000. His company is just one of dozens. \u201cWe call that bleeding,\u201d said Harley Hall, Tennessee Valley Towing\u2019s vice president for operations. \u201cIf 52 failed, all that tonnage that passes through here each way, it would have to move on rail and road, and the rail cars aren\u2019t there and there\u2019s no room on the highways. There\u2019s no way to bypass this. \u201d Domestically, trucks moved five times as many goods, by weight, as ships or barges did in 2013. Trains moved twice as much as was moved via water, and planes moved far less. But 72 percent of all international trade moved via water in 2014, compared with 10 percent by truck, 5 percent by rail, and less than 1 percent by air. Many supply chains rely on multiple modes of transportation, and no single mode has enough redundancy to accommodate the goods of another. \u201cThe corps does so much with so little,\u201d Mr. Hall said. \u201cThis is the hub, holding all the spokes together,\u201d he said of No. 52, but \u201cuntil Olmsted is completed we have a ticking time bomb,\u201d referring to the dam under construction in Illinois. The corps, an agency within the federal government, decided to build Olmsted with an experimental \u201cin the wet\u201d construction method: Hollow sections of the dam are built on the bank, skidded down to the river, towed into position and lowered into the water, where they are filled with concrete. Traditionally, a project like this would have used a coffer dam  \u2014   a small temporary dam that keeps water out of the site while construction goes on in the dry. The \u201cin the wet\u201d method was supposed to save time and money and minimize delays, but it did the opposite. By the time the corps realized its folly, it was too late to alter course. The novel construction process and inadequate congressional funding, among other things, have dragged the project past the   mark. Olmsted has been under construction for so long that the company contracted to build it has been bought and renamed three times, the new locks at the Panama Canal  \u2014   Olmsted\u2019s global equivalent  \u2014   have been begun and finished, and grandchildren of the early workers have been hired. Meanwhile, the old locks and dams are costing the country $640 million a year in delays and closures, according to the Army corps. Little has changed at No. 52 and No. 53 since 1929. Each dam is made of over 400 steel or oak panels, called wickets, that sit in the river and hold back water. When the river is high  \u2014   about 40 percent of the year for No. 52, more for No. 53  \u2014   the wickets can be lowered to the river bottom to let boats pass above them. When the water goes down, a   crane from 1937, with a boiler the size of a car, is towed out into the river. A worker reaches into the seething current with a   steel hook and feels around for an   bar. When he has hooked it, the crane grabs the end of the hook, pulls the wicket up, and the force of the current sets it in place. This is repeated until all the wickets are up, which might take 24 hours. \u201cThis is all farmer work,\u201d said Mr. Helland, the lockmaster. \u201cIf you grew up on a farm, what\u2019s in your back pockets? Either a pair of pliers or a hammer  \u2014   that one tool you always use to fix everything with. \u201d He sat on the steps of the old white frame house, on a hill above the lock, that serves as his office. \u201cThe lock is kept going with all the bubble gum and duct tape we\u2019ve got left,\u201d he said, but \u201cwe\u2019re running out. She\u2019s deteriorating so fast it makes it hard to keep up. \u201d The corps has identified 25 failure points at No. 52 and No. 53  \u2014   things that are on the verge of breaking, and shutting the locks down. Both are built on wood pilings driven into the river bottom sand. The lock walls are cracking and sagging, the hydraulic pipes are paper thin, concrete is crumbling, metal is rusted through, railings are gone, and seals are leaking. Mr. Helland worries about his dam every day. Last year, a family of six drove their pleasure boat down the spillway and four people died. Recently a contractor hit the dam and broke another wicket (cost: $20, 000) adding a   hole to many   holes and a   hole. Each hole makes it harder for the dam to hold back water. After the contractor crash, the smaller lock chamber was shut for a few days because pipes carrying hydraulic fluid to the gate were leaking and about to burst. \u201cThese are old backbreaking places,\u201d said Randy Robertson, the    master of Lock and Dam No. 53. \u201cTrying to keep these things going, it\u2019s a struggle every day. We work a lot of overtime just to try and maintain junk  \u2014   and that\u2019s what it is. There are things we can\u2019t get parts for anymore. You can\u2019t just go to a boat store or a hardware store and get a drum for a 1937 steam engine. You have to go to a machine shop and have it machined. \u201d On a recent Friday, Mr. Robertson\u2019s lock resembled ancient ruins,   emerging from the river. It is still in working order, but it looked abandoned. Paint peeled, concrete cracked, and there was no reason to fix it. Each piece of Olmsted that is placed in the river is \u201cone step closer to 53 being obsolete,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m getting phased out and I\u2019m O. K. with that,\u201d Mr. Robertson said. Earlier, Mr. Robertson was driving past Mound City, Ill. just downstream from Olmsted. The grain harvest was coming in, filling the huge elevators and making   piles on the ground. Trucks carrying grain drove by every few minutes. All the farmers in the surrounding countryside depend on him, he said. If the locks fail, their corn doesn\u2019t get to market. \u201cYou know that everybody pinpoints down to you. You see it firsthand, they\u2019ve got a wife, kids, a paycheck,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you mess up, you cost everybody. \u201d Mr. Robertson was lockmaster of No. 52 for five years. Because of the stress, he said, his doctor told him he needed to do something else if he wanted to live. When the job opened up, he was relieved to be transferred to No. 53, where the dam is down more and stress is lower. Even drinking water is at the mercy of the locks. When the corps lowered No. 52\u2019s pool to work on the dam on Sept. 14, Paducah\u2019s intake pipes  \u2014   which suck water directly out of the river  \u2014   could have risen above water. If the closing had persisted for 96 hours, as was predicted, the town of 25, 000 people would have had to find another source of water. A few days later, Mr. Helland stood above the dam on a steel box that would protect his divers from the fierce current when they dived into the river to fix the wickets. The   maneuver boat lay against the dam, boiler hissing. The crane operator jiggled his foot on the pedals. Warm vapor rose from the roiling rapids below. On top of the dam, a milk crate, a dead fish, a bowling ball and hundreds of logs had come to rest. \u201cDid you know bowling balls float?\u201d asked Scott Davis, a lock operator. Earlier that week, it was starting to rain, and Mr. Davis and Sadie, his black dog, were leaving for the night. They walked past three retired wickets on the ground above the lock. The wood was gray, pockmarked and scoured from the river. \u201cThis is the   thing I\u2019ve ever seen in my life,\u201d said Mr. Davis, 52. \u201cThe wood is spectacular  \u2014   it\u2019s the heartwood of white oak trees. \u201d He has been taking old wickets home, milling the wood, and making picture frames and coffee tables. \u201cWhen somebody retires from here, I\u2019m going to give them a picture of a sunset over the lock and a coffee table to put their feet on,\u201d he said. By the time the William Hank was cleared to enter No. 52\u2019s lock, the captain had gone to bed, and the pilot, Jackson Walker (universally called Bubba) was in the pilot house. \u201cI have actually sat on both sides of this lock for a week to a week and a half before,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s money these companies are having to pay these guys just to sit. \u201d Slowly, the boat chugged toward the lock wall. One thousand feet in front of him, on the head of the tow, a deckhand called over the radio telling him how close he was: \u201cAll right, Bubba, four more feet you be looking at daylight on that long wall   \u2026     about a foot or two to the good. \u201d Mr. Walker maneuvered the William Hank into the   chamber, a temporary addition from 1969 that has long outlived its design life. Instead of a smooth wall, the chamber is made of poured concrete cylinders that almost seem designed to catch the front of a barge. \u201cYou can easily get quartered just enough that you can jam up in here and do a bunch of damage,\u201d Mr. Walker said. His tow, like most, was 105 feet wide. The lock chamber is 110 feet wide. To park his     craft, he had as much space as a car does in a crowded parking lot. Gently tapping the stainless steel levers that control the rudders and pulling back and forth on the two throttles, Mr. Walker steered, came ahead, and stopped in the center of the chamber. To his right, the bedraggled condition of the wickets was apparent. \u201cIt\u2019s just like holding your fingers up against the water and letting it flow through,\u201d he said. The William Hank had waited eight hours to get here. \u201cThis is one of the fastest I\u2019ve seen it,\u201d Mr. Walker said. A man in a neon green vest rode a little yellow scooter to the end of the lock wall. He got out and leaned back on a long metal lever. The lock gate began to creak and groan. A big red gear turned, a black steel arm stretched out, and the gate slowly closed. No. 52 is operated entirely by hydraulics, and Mr. Helland said he could tell by the sound if something was wrong. The lock operator can move a tow through the chamber in an hour by himself, using the levers and a set of buttons inside two sheet metal shacks a little bigger than portable toilets. At Olmsted, this will all be done with clicks of a mouse, but no matter how much money is invested in infrastructure by the Trump administration, Mr. Helland\u2019s shoulders will feel the weight of 80 million tons for at least two more years.'"}, "time": 1742563943.435663}
