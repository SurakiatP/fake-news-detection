[That\u2019s a bit of a trick question because the left still plans to seize more power and money by recapturing Congress and the White House. They\u2019ll never stop attacking the legitimacy of the Trump administration. The only lingering mystery is why so many Republicans think they can counter this strategy by appeasing Democrats.   At a cost of hundreds of billions of dollars in other people\u2019s money, Republicans purchase a couple of sound bites that allow them to claim they aren\u2019t heartless monsters because they funded every   priority, from \u201csanctuary cities\u201d to Planned Parenthood.  In reality, these capitulations don\u2019t win Republicans anything. Democrats will still depict them as tightwads on welfare spending, reactionaries on social policy, and footmen to the evil rich. As soon as the Republican \u201cleaders\u201d who meekly funded 100 percent of the Democrat agenda for 2017 object to 20, 30, or 50 percent increases in that agenda, they will be denounced as greedy pigs who want poor people to die.  We won\u2019t even have to wait that long because Democrats are already cranking up the   machine to defeat Trump\u2019s tax reform proposals. How can any GOP leader be dense enough to think that caving to the Democrats on spending will secure their cooperation, or even slightly mute their objections, for dramatic   tax reform?  Indeed, the flabby bulk of these   spending deals will be used as an argument against tax cuts. How can Republicans propose cutting taxes after they just agreed to finance the entire Democrat wish list? Tax cuts are the one thing we\u2019re told we can never, ever \u201cafford. \u201d The GOP appears to have given up on even the minimal fiscal responsibility of serious budgeting. From here on in, we\u2019ll have nothing but bloated omnibus spending bills, crammed with pork and passed in a feverish haze of shutdown panic. You\u2019d risk shutting down the government for cuts to Planned Parenthood, green energy programs, or the EPA? You maniac! You can vote for Trump presidencies all you want, peons, but the GOP leadership has conceded that Democrats hold the ultimate budgetary trump card. It\u2019s an article of Republican faith that they will lose any and all budget battles, no matter the size of the GOP majority, because in the final hours Democrats will simply shrug and say, \u201cGive us what we want, or we\u2019ll shut the government down and you\u2019ll be blamed for it. \u201d  The Democrats are so confident of their eternal whip hand in budget disputes that they openly threatened to shut the government down if their demands were not granted this time around, without bothering to conceal the threat at all. They know Republicans believe they will be held responsible for any such crisis. It doesn\u2019t matter how many    Democrat fingers are on the shutdown. It wouldn\u2019t matter if Democrat senators and representatives were caught on video running around Washington and pulling the plugs out of government computers. Terrified Republican leaders are convinced the media will never, ever frame the crisis as \u201cDemocrats Shut Down Federal Government to Protect Illegal Alien Criminals. \u201d The GOP Establishment just emerged from a presidential primary in which Donald Trump bulldozed a huge field of   Republican contenders, in no small part because the public was furious with Republican inability to make progress on a conservative agenda despite holding both House and Senate. They seem to have learned nothing from the experience.  The GOP promised that if voters gave them the Senate in 2014  \u2014   an outcome deemed extremely unlikely going into the election cycle  \u2014   they would march over former Majority Leader Harry Reid\u2019s political grave and get things done at last.  That didn\u2019t happen. We were told the power of President Obama\u2019s veto pen was unbeatable. But Obama didn\u2019t even have to use that pen, because the revolutionary new GOP Congress immediately set about giving the Democrat minority   control over the budget. The first item on the Republican leadership agenda in 2015 was sidelining every young Republican representative who took all that     stuff seriously. By the end of the year, Democrats were crowing that House Speaker Paul Ryan and his allies \u201cgave away the store. \u201d It\u2019s funny how having a Republican president doesn\u2019t slow down Democrat budget priorities a bit, isn\u2019t it? In 2009, Republicans said they were helpless without congressional majorities. In 2010 they won the House, but said they were helpless without the Senate. Then they took the Senate, but said they were helpless without the White House. Democrats today are basically where Republicans were in 2009  \u2026     but they\u2019re not helpless at all. They\u2019re still writing the budget and treating the GOP leadership like Harry Potter\u2019s house elves. Paul Ryan can only hope that one day Nancy Pelosi will mistakenly give him a sock and set him free. The winter of Republican triumph in 2014 gave us the horror of the \u201ccromnibus\u201d bill  \u2014   a complete surrender to the losers of the midterm election. Democrats effectively wrote the first budget after the big GOP midterm triumph. After listing all of the Republican capitulations, including legislative tricks that made it easier for President Obama to shoot down every Republican idea he didn\u2019t like, Senator Ted Cruz ( ) wrote in December 2015 that the only bright spot he could see were \u201csignificant\u201d steps toward \u201crepealing Obamacare and defunding Planned Parenthood. \u201d How significant do those steps look in retrospect? Angry and disappointed Republican voters sent an unmistakable message by turning to Trump in the GOP primary, even though every Establishment official and   pundit assured them nominating Trump was tantamount to throwing the 2016 election away. The stunning upset of the 2014 midterm was surpassed by the even more stunning election of President Donald Trump in 2016. One hundred days in, the leaders of both party establishments and 90 percent of the punditocracy are still walking around like they use tasers on their temples in the shower every morning. And the result of all those shocking upsets is  \u2026     this? A budget bill Barack Obama would cheerfully have signed, assuming he didn\u2019t think he could squeeze a few billion more out of Republicans at the eleventh hour? Voters keep giving the GOP astounding election victories, and they keep responding with the same budget, over and over again. Nearly everything Trump proposed cutting is funded in full  \u2014   in many cases with substantial increases? $1. 5 billion for border security, but not a nickel for the border wall  \u2014   the single most concrete, unambiguous promise Trump made, both before and after the election? We were given endless excuses why the congressional \u201cpower of the purse\u201d could not be used to thwart Obama\u2019s agenda, but apparently, the Democrat minority can use it to thwart Trump\u2019s with ease. The big achievement touted by the White House and congressional leaders is increased military spending. \u201cWe have boosted resources for our defense needs without corresponding increases in   spending,\u201d Speaker Ryan proclaimed. Those defense spending increases might be vitally needed, but what Ryan is saying here violates everything he previously stated about the need for fiscal discipline. The only enduring accomplishment of the Budget Control Act of 2011 was modestly restricting federal spending by menacing Republicans with military cuts and Democrats with domestic spending cuts  \u2014   an Obama idea that was supposed to terrorize Republicans out of insisting on fiscal discipline at all.  Here we are in 2017, and the big \u201cachievement\u201d is that Democrats agreed to let Republicans spend more on the military, while Republicans gave Democrats everything they wanted on domestic spending. Republicans ended up right where Obama wanted them to be all along. The message sent by this budget betrayal is that elections don\u2019t really matter all that much. The special interests that demand lavish funding from taxpayers will not be denied. Most of the matters we have heated political arguments over are actually beyond debate  \u2014   the left will be funded no matter how you vote. What\u2019s the point of entering the arena of ideas, to do the hard work of arguing against the abortion lobby, when Planned Parenthood gets its bulging sack of taxpayer cash from a Republican House, Senate, and White House? Do Republicans have the faintest clue how hollow and insincere their rhetoric sounds when the budgets and resolutions dribble out, and everything they claimed to oppose with passionate fury is fully funded? They\u2019re already reeling from the embarrassing \u201cObamacare Lite\u201d debacle, after years of vowing to repeal the Affordable Care Act at every fundraiser  \u2014   years of passing repeal bills they knew were doomed, folding them into paper airplanes, and tossing them at the window of Obama\u2019s Oval Office. How often do they think they can get away with fighting for nothing before disgusted voters throw up their hands and walk away forever?'"}, "time": 1742562158.0198243}
