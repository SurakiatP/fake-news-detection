She was believed to be 85. Nguyen Ngoc Thuy, a former colleague of Mrs. Ngo\u2019s at Voice of Vietnam, the state broadcaster where she worked for decades, confirmed her death in a telephone interview on Tuesday and said she had been treated for liver ailments. Mrs. Ngo, who broadcast in English, was a propaganda weapon for North Vietnam as it battled the United States and the South Vietnamese government. Her work was in the tradition of Tokyo Rose and Axis Sally, whose radio broadcasts were intended to damage the morale of American troops during World War II. Mr. Thuy said that Mrs. Ngo was both a national celebrity and a role model to her younger colleagues, including himself. \u201cWe admired her perfect voice and her legendary role\u201d in the war effort, he said in the interview. Mrs. Ngo was born in Hanoi, the capital, in 1931, when Vietnam was a French colony. (Her exact birth date could not be learned, nor was there information on survivors.) She learned English from private tutors in the early 1950s  \u2014   partly, she later recalled, because she loved watching Hollywood films like \u201cGone With the Wind. \u201d \u201cI always preferred American movies to French films,\u201d she said in an interview with The New York Times in 1994. \u201cThe French talked too much. There was more action in American movies. \u2019\u2019 Mrs. Ngo began broadcasting for Voice of Vietnam in 1955, a year after Vietnamese revolutionaries defeated France at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, forcing the French from Indochina. Early in her career she used the name Thu Huong, or Autumn Fragrance, because it was easier for her   listeners to pronounce, she told The Times. \u201cFewer syllables,\u201d she said. Her broadcasts aimed at United States forces began in 1965, and she was still on the air in 1975, when North Vietnam captured Saigon, the South Vietnamese capital, and renamed it Ho Chi Minh City. As part of her programs, each 30 minutes long, Mrs. Ngo would announce the names of American soldiers who had died in battle the previous month. Her listeners included the Navy pilot John McCain, the future United States senator, who was a prisoner of war in Hanoi for five and a half years after his plane was shot down in October 1967. On a visit to Hanoi in April 2000, Senator McCain said he had listened to Mrs. Ngo\u2019s broadcasts on loudspeakers that hung from the ceiling in a cellblock illuminated by a single bulb. \u201cI heard her every day,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s a marvelous entertainer. I\u2019m surprised she didn\u2019t get to Hollywood. \u201d Mrs. Ngo\u2019s broadcasts included music by Pete Seeger, Joan Baez and other antiwar American folk singers, and she took a friendly approach to her listeners, Mr. Thuy said. But beneath her gentle tone, he added, was a steely confidence in the North Vietnamese cause. Nguyen Van Vinh, a Vietnamese cameraman who filmed Mrs. Ngo\u2019s meeting the actress and antiwar activist Jane Fonda in Hanoi in 1972, said Mrs. Ngo had \u201ctalked in a whisper to the G. I. s. \u201d \u201cSoldiers used a gun, but in Hanoi, in North Vietnam, she used her voice,\u201d he said. Mrs. Ngo acknowledged as much in the 1994 interview with The Times. \u201cMy work was to make the G. I. s understand that it was not right for them to take part in this war,\u201d she said. \u201cI talk to them about the traditions of the Vietnamese, to resist aggression. I want them to know the truth about this war and to do a little bit to demoralize them so that they will refuse to fight. \u201d She said the Americans had called her Hanoi Hannah for a simple reason: alliteration. \u201cThe Americans like nicknames,\u201d she added.'"}, "time": 1742628360.9942522}
