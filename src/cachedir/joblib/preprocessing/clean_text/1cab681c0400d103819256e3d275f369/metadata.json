But for many prisoners, especially those involved in the national prison strike against slave labor, access to such technology is considered a lifeline.\\nPrisoners in Alabama, South Carolina, New York, and other states use contraband phones to communicate with family, supporters, and members of the media about their work, and to document the violence, deteriorating and filthy facilities, and the testimonies of other incarcerated people. If prisoners did not have access to these cell phones, it\u2019s possible the public would know even less about the prison strike than they do today.\\n\u201cA lot of people have phones in prison. But a lot of them are scared to use them the way we use them. It\u2019s complicated,\u201d said a prisoner, who was granted anonymity to prevent retaliation from prison officials. \u201cBeing able to stay in contact with our families is helpful as far as rehabilitation goes.\u201d\\n\u201cCell phones are part of the day to day life that we live in today. To say that you\u2019re preparing someone to re-enter society and to rehabilitate them [and then] say that they can\u2019t have access to a cell phone is contradictory,\u201d the prisoner argued. \u201cThis serves as a supplement to rehabilitation but also it allows us to be connected to society, to the actual world that we\u2019re going to be entering back into when we go back out there.\u201d\\n\u201cThey don\u2019t let the media inside of any prisons in any state. If they do allow the media to come in, it\u2019s a dog and pony show. They walk them where they wanna walk them. They don\u2019t let them talk to nobody they don\u2019t really want them to talk to. So there\u2019s no realistic perspective of what prisons are really all about.\u201d\\n\u201cWith these cell phones, it allows us to put the reality out there, and they\u2019re afraid of that. And they should be, because of what\u2019s going on in the prisons.\u201d\\nAnother incarcerated person, who operates the @prisonslavery1 Twitter account, told Shadowproof, \u201cThe prison system slave drivers want to muffle our voice, dehumanize us through silence.\u201d\\n\u201cWith them allowed to control the narrative and the prisoners silenced under brutal repression tactics, it\u2019s a win-win for the enslavers. These phones level the playing fields. These (weapons) will go down in history as an essential tool used by 21st century slaves,\u201d they said. \u201cThese weapons will cause their collapse. As we continue to expose them and push for human rights\u201d\\nGoing back to the prisoner, who spoke about cell phones as a connection to society, the phones may be especially useful to incarcerated parents eager to play a role in their children\u2019s lives.\\n\u201cChildren live in households that they\u2019re not in control of. They can\u2019t just call collect to reach someone else\u2019s house. They may be able to get a phone and let\u2019s say their child acts out and they\u2019re going through something. Well, that child can call their parent, their daddy or their momma on the cell phone and say, \u2018Dad I\u2019m in a bad situation. What do I do?'\u201d\\n\u201cBut the wall phone, [the child] can\u2019t call the wall phone. That\u2019s a problem that [the parent] can\u2019t offer advice, that he can\u2019t help.\u201d\\nThe prisoner pointed out that many of these phones are smuggled in by the officers and sold at a high price to the incarcerated. But he argued the primary motivation for prison officials to clampdown on contraband phones is that it deprives them of a revenue stream.\\n\u201cThey\u2019ll say, \u2018Well, if you got the money to pay for the cell phone, you should be able to pay for the [wall] phone bill. But the cell phone allows us unlimited calls. The wall phone you have to pay every time you use the phone.\u201d\\n\u201cSo if I pay $60 a month and I get unlimited calls, well that may be five or ten phone calls on a wall phone. And after that it\u2019s over with. It\u2019s not an unlimited amount of time on the phone call.\u201d\\n\u201cYou get 15 minutes\u2014that\u2019s a $6 phone call,\u201d they added. \u201cYou got to hang up and call back. Fifteen more minutes, six more dollars, so you can run through your 10 phone calls in just a few hours and that\u2019s it. You can\u2019t talk to anyone else for the rest of the month \u2019cause they don\u2019t have money.\u201d\\n\u201cSo [cell phones] just make it easier, it makes everyone more accessible. They can check on their cases, if they cant find information they can call a lawyer or they can seek legal help. You can\u2019t do that on a wall phone, you really can\u2019t help yourself on a wall phone.\u201d\\n\u201cIf they allowed us to have cell phones and they told us they were gonna monitor our calls, no one would care,\u201d the prisoner argued. \u201cThe issue is not that they\u2019re monitoring our phone calls, we\u2019re not on the phone trying to get in touch with ISIS or no shit like that. We\u2019re trying to call our brothers and see how their day was at school.\u201d\\nThe prisoner mocked the argument by prison officials that the phone are how they get drugs in the prison. He noted drugs have been in prisons since their inception.\\n\u201cThey had drugs and shit, since the first time the prison doors open. So the cell phones do not facilitate anything. If the individual wants to commit crime, they\u2019re gonna do it regardless. So the cell phone is not a part of that.\u201d\\nThe post For Incarcerated, Contraband Cell Phones Are Lifeline To Outside appeared first on Shadowproof .\\n\""}, "time": 1742564291.4699807}
