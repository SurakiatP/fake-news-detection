[\u201cI don\u2019t use the term resistance   \u2026     That was a term I associate with the French underground and people who risked their lives. So I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s a fair, apt metaphor for the latest contretemps over policy,\u201d Brown told Nagourney.  Nagourney\u2019s article explores the efforts of Democratic politicians in California  \u2014   who dominate the state\u2019s politics  \u2014   to lead the nationwide opposition to the Trump administration. The question of how, exactly, to conduct that opposition is one that divides the state party, and which is already playing into the election to succeed Brown as governor in 2018. While some candidates, and the state legislature, are pushing for more aggressive confrontations, Nagourney notes, \u201ca more pragmatic dynamic is emerging for Democrats who are more settled in office\u201d and need Trump\u2019s \u201ccooperation. \u201d He mentions lobbying by state and local officials for a share of Trump\u2019s proposed spending on infrastructure projects. An important example that escaped Nagourney\u2019s attention is California\u2019s reliance on the Trump administration to provide emergency relief. Already, the state has requested aid from the federal government four times since Trump took office, as it wrestles with the damage of heavy winter rains, snow and flooding. Each time, Trump has granted the aid. Democrats  \u2014   not just in California  \u2014   have embraced the term \u201cresistance. \u201d   Jewish groups are even calling themselves the \u201cJewish resistance,\u201d even though the original Jewish Resistance Movement was a   militia.
