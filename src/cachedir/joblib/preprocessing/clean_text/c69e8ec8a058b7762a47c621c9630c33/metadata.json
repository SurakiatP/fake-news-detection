[Writing on the potential to run down the political and social influence of \u201ctoxic white males\u201d by withdrawing their right to the ballot, Huffington Post contributor Shelley Garland  \u2014   who describes herself as an \u201cactivist and a feminist\u201d student who is \u201cworking on ways to smash the patriarchy\u201d  \u2014  says the change only need be enacted for 20 to 30 years or so. This period would \u201cgo some way to seeing a decline in the influence of reactionary and   ideology in the world\u201d.  Blaming white males for \u201cSome of the biggest blows to the progressive cause in the past year\u201d including Brexit and the election of President Donald Trump, Garland\u2019s apparently serious piece claimed just a couple of decades of white men being excluded from elections could see such progressive leaps forward as the collapse of Western law and capitalism, and a massive redistribution of wealth from \u201ctoxic white masculinity\u201d through \u201cexpropriation of these various assets\u201d. Among the charges laid at the feet of white males by the author are the 2008 recession, and \u201c500 years colonialism, slavery, and various aggressive wars and genocides\u201d. If this was about any other group it would be the end of @HuffingtonPost, Is It Time To Deny #WhiteMen The #Vote ? https:  .   \u2014   Ben   (@B_HQ) April 13, 2017,  The extremely sexist and racist nature of the piece has been noted by many on social media. Ben   chairman of Britain\u2019s oldest Conservative think tank The Bow Group, took to Twitter to suggest that had the piece targeted any other minority group as opposed to white males, it would \u201cbe the end\u201d of the online publication. Social media users also speculated on the likelihood of Shelley Garland merely being a pseudonym, with some pointing out her lack of presence on the internet besides The Huffington Post. A parody account for Garland created after the article was published joked about the amount of \u201c[white male] tears\u201d shed for the piece, and rejected the notion she was a work of fiction. The implication that I was created by @HuffingtonPost to spread their opinions or that I wasn\u2019t properly vetted is absurd!  \u2014   Shelley Garland (@garland_shelley) April 14, 2017, '"}, "time": 1742564288.2532322}
