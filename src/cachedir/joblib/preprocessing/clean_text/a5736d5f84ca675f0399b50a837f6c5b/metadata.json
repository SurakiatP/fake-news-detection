[Adam Morgan, the Editor in Chief of the Chicago Review of Books, published an article today in The Guardian explaining why the Chicago Review of Books chose to boycott Simon  Schuster, the company publishing MILO\u2019s new book, DANGEROUS.   The title of the Guardian article reads, \u201cPublishing Milo Yiannopoulos\u2019 book is wrong. My magazine is fighting back. \u201d However the URL of the article and the Facebook sharing preview reveal the title, \u201cSimon  Schuster is rewarding   hate speech. We cannot stay silent. \u201d This may be a simple error but it is also likely that the title calling MILO\u2019s book \u201c  hate speech\u201d was the original tile of the article. The Guardian may have realised their error in calling MILO \u201c \u201d a political movement which MILO has repeatedly stated he is not part of, despite the media\u2019s various attempts to paint him as a \u201cleader\u201d of the movement, and changed the article title. Morgan\u2019s article goes on to make a number of claims such as, \u201c2016 taught us that ridiculing women, people of colour, Muslims and members of the LGBTQ community can make someone immensely popular,\u201d and that MILO is, \u201cnot a conservative intellectual leader with a political agenda. He\u2019s a clickbait grifter who has made a name for himself spewing hate speech. \u201d  What Morgan considers to be \u201chate speech\u201d have garnered MILO a position as Senior Editor of one of the largest political news website on the internet, media appearances on news outlets across the world, over one million Facebook likes and an army of fans that listen to him speak at his immensely successful Dangerous Faggot college tour. Morgan then states that he \u201cmade a decision that has nothing to do with political ideology and everything to do with human rights and decency,\u201d by refusing to review Simon  Schuster books in 2017. Exactly what human rights MILO\u2019s book is denying people, Morgan fails to state.  Morgan then states that MILO\u2019s book may inspire terrorist acts. \u201cRhetoric like [MILO\u2019s]  \u2014   which targets racial, religious and cultural minorities  \u2014   invites discrimination. It arguably encourages people such as Omar Mateen and Dylann Roof to think of entire groups of people as less than human. \u201d MILO of course gave a speech at the site of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando where he urged the gay community to fight back, to let it be known that they will never let an attack such as the one at Pulse nightclub happen again, and that they will protect themselves if the left will not.  When asked for comment on the accusation that his words will lead to terrorism MILO said, \u201cFollowing Omar Mateen\u2019s horrific crimes, I travelled to Orlando and spoke out against Islam\u2019s hatred of homosexuals outside Pulse nightclub. The websites Dylann Roof is associated with hate me as much as anyone. Regressives like Adam Morgan can\u2019t stand free speech or opposing viewpoints being heard. \u201d Further discussing the Chicago Review of Books\u2019 decision to refuse to review Simon  Schuster books in 2017, Morgan states \u201cAfter the Chicago Review of Books attracted so much attention for our stance, and writers more talented than me asked us to reconsider, I lost sleep. But on Saturday, when the biographer of a lesbian artist criticised Simon  Schuster, Yiannopoulos responded: \u2018There is only one place for lesbians: porn. \u2019\u201d Read the article in full here. DANGEROUS is available to   now via Amazon, in hardcover and Kindle editions. And yes, MILO is reading the audiobook version himself! '"}, "time": 1742562404.5356011}
