Last month, Assange\u2019s WikiLeaks made a 2014 email public that exposed how then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged then adviser to President Barack Obama John Podesta to \u201cbring pressure\u201d on Qatar and Saudi Arabia, saying that they were \u201cproviding clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL [Islamic State, IS, ISIS] and other radical Sunni groups.\u201d In a video, Assange called the email the \u201cmost important\u201d of the entire collection of ammo WikiLeaks has obtained against the Clinton campaign: All serious analysts know, and even the US government has agreed, that some Saudi figures have been supporting ISIS and funding ISIS, but the dodge has always been that it is some \u201crogue\u201d princes using their oil money to do whatever they like, but actually the government disapproves. But that email says that it is the government of Saudi Arabia, and the government of Qatar that have been funding ISIS.\\nAssange sat down with veteran journalist John Pilger for a 25-minute interview within the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where Assange has been living as a refugee since 2012. He discussed in detail the conflict of interest between Clinton\u2019s official position, which occurred during Obama\u2019s first term, husband Bill Clinton\u2019s nonprofit, and the Middle East officials, claiming the output or urgency to fight terrorism may not have been heartfelt.\\nHere is a valuable excerpt from the interview: \\nJohn Pilger: The Saudis, the Qataris, the Moroccans, the Bahrainis, particularly the first two, are giving all this money to the Clinton Foundation, while Hillary Clinton is secretary of state, and the State Department is approving massive arms sales, particularly Saudi Arabia.\\nJulian Assange: Under Hillary Clinton \u2013 and the Clinton emails reveal a significant discussion of it \u2013 the biggest-ever arms deal in the world was made with Saudi Arabia: more than $80 billion. During her tenure, the total arms exports from the U.S. doubled in dollar value\\nJP: Of course, the consequence of that is that this notorious jihadist group, called ISIL or ISIS, is created largely with money from people who are giving money to the Clinton Foundation?\\nJA: Yes.\\nPilger asked Assange if he thought the accusations against the Clinton campaign would have any effect on the Democratic nominee winning the 2016 presidential election. Assange also believes that next Tuesday\u2019s election is absolutely rigged, and is in favor of Hillary Clinton. He said,\\nMy analysis is that Trump would not be permitted to win. Why do I say that? Because he has had every establishment off his side. Trump does not have one establishment, maybe with the exception of the Evangelicals, if you can call them an establishment. Banks, intelligence, arms companies, foreign money, etc. are all united behind Hillary Clinton. And the media as well. Media owners, and the journalists themselves.\\n'"}, "time": 1742562506.7339268}
