They do not exist,\u201d Francis said in his speech to a world meeting of populist movements.  What he apparently meant is that not all Christians are terrorists and not all Muslims are terrorists \u2014  a fact evident to all \u2014  yet his words also seemed to suggest that no specifically Islamic form of terrorism exists in the world, an assertion that stands in stark contradiction to established fact. \u201cNo people is criminal or   or violent,\u201d Francis said, while also suggesting \u2014  as he has on other occasions \u2014  that terrorism is primarily a result of economic inequalities rather than religious beliefs. \u201cThe poor and the poorer peoples are accused of violence yet, without equal opportunities, the different forms of aggression and conflict will find a fertile terrain for growth and will eventually explode. \u201d The Pope also reiterated his conviction that all religions promote peace and that the danger of violent radicalization exists equally in all religions. \u201cThere are fundamentalist and violent individuals in all peoples and religions \u2014  and with intolerant generalizations they become stronger because they feed on hate and xenophobia,\u201d he said. While denying the existence of Islamic terrorism, Francis also seemed to condemn the denial of global warming, asserting that \u201cthe ecological crisis is real. \u201d \u201cA very solid scientific consensus indicates that we are presently witnessing a disturbing warming of the climatic system,\u201d he said. We know \u201cwhat happens when we deny science and disregard the voice of Nature,\u201d the Pope said. \u201cLet us not fall into denial. Time is running out. Let us act. I ask you again \u2014  all of you, people of all backgrounds including native people, pastors, political leaders \u2014  to defend Creation. \u201d While acknowledging that science is not \u201cthe only form of knowledge,\u201d and that \u201cscience is not necessarily \u2018neutral\u2019\u201d and often \u201cconceals ideological views or economic interests,\u201d he still insisted that people of good will should not oppose \u201cscientific consensus\u201d regarding global warming. Leftist media like the liberal Guardian in the U. K. immediately politicized the speech, predictably claiming that the Pope was backing \u201c  protests,\u201d despite the fact that the Pope himself denied such a claim, explicitly declaring that \u201cI am not speaking of anyone in particular. \u201d \u201cI am not speaking of anyone in particular, I am speaking of a social and political process that flourishes in many parts of the world and poses a grave danger for humanity,\u201d he said. Moreover, although the Guardian claimed that the Pope was \u201ccondemning populism,\u201d in point of fact, he was speaking to populist movements and praised their commitment to democracy. \u201cThe direction taken beyond this historic \u201d Francis said, \u201cwill depend on people\u2019s involvement and participation and, largely, on yourselves, the popular movements. \u201d Nevertheless, the Vatican\u2019s Secretary of State, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, said Monday that the Holy See is concerned over growing populist and nationalist movements, both in Europe and in the United States. In an interview for the Italian evening news on the   RAI network, the Cardinal was asked whether the Vatican is worried about what the interviewer called \u201cthe spread of nationalism and populism not only in Europe but also in the United States with Donald Trump. \u201d \u201cI think so, I think so,\u201d Parolin said. \u201cCertainly these closings are not a good sign,\u201d since many of them \u201care born of fear, which is not a good counselor. \u201d In his address Friday, the Pope denounced \u201cthe guise of what is politically correct or ideologically fashionable,\u201d which he described as a \u201chypocritical attitude,\u201d while urging real solutions to unemployment, corruption, the identity crisis, and \u201cthe gutting of democracies. \u201d \u201cThe system\u2019s gangrene cannot be whitewashed forever because sooner or later the stench becomes too strong,\u201d he said.
