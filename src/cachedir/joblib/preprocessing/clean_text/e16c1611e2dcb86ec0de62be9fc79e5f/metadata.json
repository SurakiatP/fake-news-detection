This kind of targeted enforcement marks out   Americans, regardless of immigration status, as different, other, suspect. It\u2019s a clear demarcation of whom Trump and his cohort consider real Americans. The Detroit Free Press editorial board goes on to say that \u201cthe idea that a border wall would halt or even pause illegal immigration \u2014  much less the idea that Mexico will volunteer payment for such a wall \u2014  is absurd. \u201d However, Trump has proposed a 20 percent tax on imports coming into the U. S. from Mexico which would serve as a payment from Mexico for the border wall, as Breitbart News reported. Likewise, the claim that walls do not serve to secure borders has been challenged by the National Border Patrol Council, which has heralded Trump\u2019s immigration plans, as Breitbart Texas reported. \u201cWe know we won\u2019t have a wall along the 2, 000 miles of border,\u201d the President for the Local 2455 of the National Border Patrol Council Hector Garza said. \u201cWhat we will have is a wall where it is needed. That barrier with proper manpower, resources, technology and other tools will be effective. But most important, for the first time we have a president that wants to secure the border. \u201d The editorial board also wrote that Trump tapped into \u201cbigoted fear\u201d over immigration: But Trump gained a lot of his support by manipulating truth about America\u2019s immigration challenges, by painting a picture of Latino and Muslim immigrants as, broadly, leeches and potential terrorists. That\u2019s what his policies are about. That\u2019s the bigoted fear he tapped into. The Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) has found that illegal immigrants are somewhat of a drain on American   social services, costing about $113 billion for them to live in the country, as Breitbart Texas reported. Ending the editorial, the Detroit Free Press calls on residents and citizens to be a \u201cresistance\u201d to Trump, writing, \u201cthere is undoubtedly much more to come. Which means the protests over his early actions may need to take a turn toward another tactic: resistance. \u201d John Binder is a contributor for Breitbart Texas.
