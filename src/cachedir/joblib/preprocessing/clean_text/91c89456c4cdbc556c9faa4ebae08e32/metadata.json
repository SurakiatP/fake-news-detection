Trump\u2019s temperament and competence, President Obama urged leaders of the Republican Party on Tuesday to withdraw their endorsements of Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy, flatly calling him \u201cunfit to serve\u201d as the nation\u2019s 45th president. Speaking in the East Room of the White House while Mr. Trump rallied supporters in a nearby Virginia suburb, the president noted the Republican criticism of Mr. Trump for his attacks on the Muslim parents of an American soldier, Capt. Humayun Khan, who died in Iraq. But Mr. Obama said the political recriminations from Republicans \u201cring hollow\u201d if the party\u2019s leaders continue to support Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. \u201cThe question they have to ask themselves is: If you are repeatedly having to say in very strong terms that what he has said is unacceptable, why are you still endorsing him?\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cWhat does this say about your party that this is your  ?\u201d The president\u2019s condemnation of Mr. Trump, and his direct appeal to Republicans to abandon their candidate, were stunning even in a city where politics has become a brutal and personal affair. Mr. Obama seemed eager to go beyond his past interventions in the race, which have included forceful rejections of Mr. Trump\u2019s statements and policy proposals. The last time a sitting president was as openly critical of the other party\u2019s candidate, said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian, was when President Harry S. Truman mocked Dwight D. Eisenhower during the 1952 campaign. And once Eisenhower was elected, Truman said he did not know \u201cany more about politics than a pig knows about Sunday. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a reflection of just how radical and dangerous President Obama feels that Trump is,\u201d Mr. Brinkley said. Using the formal backdrop of a joint news conference with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore, Mr. Obama suggested that Mr. Trump would not abide by \u201cnorms and rules and common sense\u201d and questioned whether he would \u201cobserve basic decency\u201d should he reach the Oval Office. The president said he would have been disappointed to lose in 2008 or 2012, but added that he had never doubted whether his Republican rivals in those races, John McCain and Mitt Romney, could function as president or had the knowledge to make government work. \u201cThat\u2019s not the situation here,\u201d Mr. Obama said. As Mr. Obama condemned Mr. Trump, the Republican candidate  \u2014   apparently unaware of the president\u2019s remarks  \u2014   repeatedly criticized his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, and the president in an hour of remarks. He called Mrs. Clinton a \u201cliar\u201d and a \u201cthief\u201d and said the country would be \u201cfinished\u201d if voters chose four more years of a presidency like Mr. Obama\u2019s. Mr. Trump also accused Mrs. Clinton of repeatedly lying over the weekend when she told Chris Wallace on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that James B. Comey, the F. B. I. director, had said her statements about her private emails were truthful. \u201cI mean, she lied,\u201d Mr. Trump said, prompting cries of \u201cLock her up!\u201d from his supporters. \u201cShe, pure and simple, she only knows to lie. She really does. She only knows to lie. But she lied, and it\u2019s a big story. \u201d Mr. Comey, testifying last month to Congress, said that \u201cwe have no basis to conclude she lied to the F. B. I. \u201d But he also said he could not say whether Mrs. Clinton\u2019s many public statements on the issue were truthful. Mr. Trump, in a written statement meant to respond directly to the president\u2019s remarks, called Mrs. Clinton \u201cunfit to serve in any government office. \u201d He also accused Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton of allowing Americans to be slaughtered in Benghazi, Libya letting veterans die waiting for medical care and releasing immigrants into the United States to kill innocent people. \u201cOur nation has been humiliated abroad and compromised by radical Islam brought onto our shores,\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s statement said. \u201cWe need change now. \u201d The dueling appearances by the president and the Republican candidate seeking to replace him escalated the heated political rhetoric in a race that had already devolved into a series of personal attacks and character assassinations. Mr. Obama cited Mr. Trump\u2019s reaction to Captain Khan\u2019s parents, Khizr and Ghazala Khan, as a principal reason for his extended remarks. Mr. Trump had criticized the Khans after they honored their son at the Democratic National Convention and urged people to vote for Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Obama lamented what he called an attack on a \u201cGold Star family that had made such extraordinary sacrifices on behalf of our country. \u201d He said he did not doubt that Republicans were outraged about the statements Mr. Trump and his supporters had made about the Khan family in the last several days. \u201cBut there has to come a point at which you say somebody who makes those kinds of statements doesn\u2019t have the judgment, the temperament, the understanding, to occupy the most powerful position in the world,\u201d Mr. Obama said. The president did not limit his criticism to Mr. Trump\u2019s treatment of the Khan family. Mr. Obama said the Republican nominee had repeatedly demonstrated that he was \u201cwoefully unprepared to do this job. \u201d The president said Mr. Trump had proved he lacked knowledge about Europe, the Middle East and other parts of Asia. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a situation where you have an episodic gaffe. This is daily,\u201d Mr. Obama added. \u201cThere has to be a point at which you say, \u2018This is not somebody I can support for president of the United States, even if he purports to be a member of my party.\u2019 The fact that that has not yet happened makes some of these denunciations ring hollow. \u201d Mr. Trump, who spoke at a boisterous rally at Briar Woods High School in Ashburn, Va. began his remarks there by saying a veteran had given him a Purple Heart medal earlier in the day. \u201cI always wanted to get the Purple Heart,\u201d said Mr. Trump, who received five deferments from the draft during the Vietnam War. \u201cThis was much easier. \u201d Throughout his speech, Mr. Trump argued his case that Mrs. Clinton was \u201cunfit\u201d for the presidency, accusing her of being dishonest, weak on foreign policy and corrupt. He accused the president of doubling the national debt and said the Iraq war exit was a \u201cdisaster. \u201d \u201cLet Obama go to the golf course,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cBut you know what? We\u2019d be better off. \u201d At one point during the rally, a crying baby interrupted Mr. Trump\u2019s speech. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that baby. I love babies,\u201d Mr. Trump said at first. \u201cI hear that baby crying, I like it. What a baby, what a beautiful baby. Don\u2019t worry, don\u2019t worry. \u201d A few beats later, he changed his tune. \u201cActually, I was only kidding,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cYou can get that baby out of here. \u201d Laughs and a few gasps escaped from the crowd. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I think she really believed me that I love having a baby crying while I\u2019m speaking,\u201d Mr. Trump added. \u201cThat\u2019s O. K. People don\u2019t understand. That\u2019s O. K. \u201d Even as Mr. Obama discussed trade policy and security issues with the Singaporean prime minister, Mr. Trump criticized world leaders. He said he would ask Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany \u201cwhat went wrong\u201d in her country. And he criticized Mrs. Clinton for what he called \u201cterrible relations\u201d with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. At the White House, Mr. Lee of Singapore responded to a question about Mr. Trump with diplomacy, and said Singapore would look forward to working with whomever Americans chose as president. \u201cMany pressures build up during the election campaign, and after the elections in a calmer, cooler atmosphere, positions are rethought, strategies are nuanced, and a certain balance is kept in the direction of the ship of state. It does not turn completely upside down,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cThe Americans take pride in having a system with checks and balances,\u201d he added. \u201cSo, it is not so easy to do things, but it is not so easy to completely mess things up. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564572.8597405}
