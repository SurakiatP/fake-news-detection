In fact, he has always never admitted guilt, according to Politifact : \\nThe case was settled and Trump never admitted guilt, though his company had to agree to stipulations meant to prevent future discrimination at his rental properties. Donald Trump\u2019s Properties Had 75% Fewer Minorities Than Lived Nearby In Other Buildings \\nThe Trump Organization had 9,050 apartment units covered under the settlement agreement with the federal government, which housed only 399 minority residents across 35 covered properties, or only 4.4% of Fred and Donald Trump\u2019s New York City rental real estate empire. \\nThe public record document proves the Trump Organization and principals Fred and Donald Trump\u2019s buildings schemed to ignore the Fair Housing Act of 1968 but failed miserably and ultimately landed in court for two years starting in 1973. \\nThe Trumps eventually capitulated to the government in 1975. \\nKeep in mind, the federal government named Donald Trump personally in their Fair Housing complaint, so he wasn\u2019t just a bit player in the dark history of his family business\u2019 illegal management practices \u2014 but a named defendant. \\nThe Justice Department named 39 buildings in their original complaint, which leading to a story entitled, \u201c Major Landlord Accused of Antiblack Bias ,\u201d on the front page of the New York Times. \\nOut of the total of 14,000 units that The Times says the Trump family owned in 1973, 68% of their holdings fell under the settlement. \\nThe Trumps segregated a small group of non-white tenants into a few of their properties, maintained a single building with just over half minority residents, and virtually excluded minorities from 24 New York City buildings of the 36 total project covered in their 1975 settlement with the federal government which covered a mind-boggling 9,500 apartments. \\nFive of the Trump buildings affected had no minority residents whatsoever, and more than half of the buildings had less than ten minority residents. \\nThere\u2019s also spreadsheet below with easier to read copy of the key public record document proving Trump\u2019s discriminatory housing practices, but you can see the original here: \\nWho Wrote This Letter At The Department of Justice Civil Rights Division And Why Did They Write It? \\nDrew S. Days, III transmitted the Trump Leak (below) to the Open Housing Center of New York shortly after his appointment by President Carter. It was prepared by career Civil Rights division lawyer Harvey L. Hanley in the summer of 1977, \\nDays , was the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Civil Rights division then, where he personally oversaw the Trump family\u2019s desegregation efforts. \\nHe went on to become a Yale Law Professor, and eventually the US Solicitor General under President Clinton in 1993. \\nDays\u2019 memo reveals that the portfolio of Trump Organization realty which was covered in the 1975 settlement, and their slow progress of racial integration as of July 11th, 1977. \\nBy then, the Trump Organization had designated two additional buildings to accommodate significant blocks minority renters compared to other buildings. \\nBut across the board, non-white occupancy rates only went from 4.4% to 7.2% with 663 residents of color housed. \\nWhen you factor out those two buildings \u2013 named Argyle Hall and Westminster Hall who accepted 48 of only 264 new minority tenants \u2013 the Trump Organization\u2019s overall minority occupancy rate stood at only 6.45%. Trump Organization Management Actively Discriminated Against African-Americans \\nThe New York Times reported in August that Trump\u2019s property managers \u2013 both New York and Cincinnati, Ohio \u2013 marked minority housing applications for denial whether they were segregationists or more likely following their orders strictly. One manager spilled the beans on Trump\u2019s discriminatory practices: \\nA former Trump superintendent named Thomas Miranda testified that multiple Trump Management employees had instructed him to attach a separate piece of paper with a big letter \u201cC\u201d on it \u2014 for \u201ccolored\u201d \u2014 to any application filed by a black apartment-seeker. \\nThat wasn\u2019t only reason to date why the federal Department of Justice\u2019s Civil Rights division monitored fully 2/3rds of the Trump family\u2019s realty empire for racial discrimination in the 70s. \\nCase records like the one provided by DCAT below show that Trump\u2019s manager would tell prospective tenants that their neighborhoods were safe, \u201cbecause there were no blacks around.\u201d \\nFurthermore, as in many housing discrimination cases, the below court document also documents testers visiting the Trump Organization\u2019s buildings and coming out with different results based on the skin color of the prospective tenant.

(doc 2, page 11 in link) US Census Data. Click to Open in New Tab \\nRoughly 20% of that 1970 population was listed as African-American. \\nBy the 1980 US Census , the population of the two New York City boroughs dipped slightly, however the percentage of African-American and hispanic residents in the two boroughs was 40% of the population. (pages 29-30 in link) \\nThis data demonstrates that the Trump Organization\u2019s covered apartments only had one fourth of the proportion of minority residents compared their surrounding neighborhoods in the mid-1970s, while 15% percent of their properties had zero African-Americans residing inside them. \\nFor the purposes of this story, we used the blended average of minority population in both districts, since there\u2019s a large portfolio of buildings. Conclusion \\nDonald Trump settled a federal Fair Housing Act lawsuit because most of his buildings often had few, or even no minority residents. \\nA careful examination of his record shows that his family\u2019s real estate empire systematically excluded African-Americans from its housing, and even after settling with the US Department of Justice, the Trump Organization continued to use the same tactics of loading just a few properties with most of the minority tenants.'"}, "time": 1742562107.4432461}
