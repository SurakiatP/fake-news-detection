Capital to   the offensive,   painting depicting police as pigs. Members of the Caucus are insisting that they are \u201cdefending the Constitution\u201d by   the controversial artwork. [The news of the CBC\u2019s intentions was made public by a January 9 tweet from Fox Business Network contributor Charles V Payne.  Breaking News Congressional Black Caucus to rehang \u201dPolice as Pigs\u201d painting tomorrow saying: \u201dIt\u2019s about defending the Constitution. \u201d  \u2014   Charles V Payne (@cvpayne) January 9, 2017,  The painting depicting police officers as giant pigs pushing minorities around in Ferguson, Missouri, was originally hung by Missouri Democrat Lacy Clay in the tunnel of the Congressional Cannon office building of the U. S. Capitol complex. But it was recently pulled down by California Republican Duncan Hunter who said the thing fosters an \u201cuntrue narrative\u201d that police don\u2019t care about the public in general and minorities in particular. \u201cThis false narrative portrays law enforcement professionals as posing a danger to the very communities we serve. That is untrue and this \u2018art\u2019 reinforces this false narrative and is disrespectful on so many levels,\u201d Rep. Hunter said after he removed the offensive painting from the wall. The Californian also said that numerous members of the Capitol Police had expressed their dismay at the painting\u2019s inclusion in the display of art works submitted by the nation\u2019s high schoolers to the Congressional Art Competition. Hunter also noted that Rep. Lacy can keep putting it up, but he can also keep taking it back down. Since the painting attacking police went up in the Capitol, police groups and unions have criticized the artwork and have demanded its removal. One police union called the painting \u201creprehensible and repugnant. \u201d The CBC, though, is claiming it is replacing the panting because of \u201cthe Constitution. \u201d \u201cThe rehanging of this painting for public view represents more than just protecting the rights of a student artist, it is a proud statement in defense of the 1st Amendment to the U. S. Constitution which guarantees freedom of expression to every American,\u201d a statement by the CBC said. The statement also noted the offensive painting had been \u201cremoved without permission or proper authority\u201d by Rep. Hunter. In reply to his tweet announcing the intention to   the painting, one Twitter user ruefully noted that the family of a recently murdered African American Orlando officer might not be very appreciative of the CBC\u2019s using the Constitution as an excuse to spread hate. @cvpayne I am sure Master Sgt. Debra Clayton\u2019s family  OPD is thankful that the Black Caucus fought so hard in defending a stupid painting. pic. twitter.   \u2014   Mrz Mazz (@mrzmazz) January 9, 2017,  Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com.'"}, "time": 1742564133.7042148}
