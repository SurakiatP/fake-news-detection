Ruff was placed on administrative leave on April 21 after the video of his interaction with the young activists went viral. \u201cYou can go to hell where they are too,\u201d he said pointing at pictures of aborted children. \u201cThey\u2019re not children! They\u2019re cells!\u201d \u201cListen here, son, alright? I am as gay as the day is long, and twice as sunny. I don\u2019t give a fuck what you think Jesus tells me about what I should and should not be doing,\u201d Ruff barked. \u201cYou\u2019re acting very immaturely. I\u2019m 16 and you\u2019re yelling at me,\u201d one of the teens responded. The school said Ruff resigned from his position in a news release. \u201cDr. Ruff has acknowledged that the demonstrators had a right to be on a public sidewalk,\u201d the news release said. \u201cHe acknowledged that his conduct cannot be defended or condoned, and he deeply regretted his actions as displayed on the video. This school district will not interfere with the rights of anyone to express themselves. \u201d \u201cIn reviewing the video Dr. Ruff knew that the conduct he displayed was not representative of who he is and was not representative of the kind of educational leader he prided himself on being,\u201d the news release added.
