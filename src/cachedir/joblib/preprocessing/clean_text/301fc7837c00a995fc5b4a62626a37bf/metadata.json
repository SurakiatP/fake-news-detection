The Foundation also has a sister company called the Clinton Health Access Initiative however, which appears to have also received funding from Australian taxpayers. \\n\u201cSince 2006, Australia has contributed $88 million to [the Clinton Health Access Initiative] and its sister organization, the Clinton Foundation,\u201d Bishop said in a statement on September 22, 2014. \\nDocuments released in July by Australia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade provided a different number from both, however, listing 11 separate grants to the Clinton Foundation, and a \u201cChina Clinton Foundation\u201d that totaled almost $71 million. \\nThese disparities prompted Republican Representative Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, the vice-chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, to bring the issue to the attention of the IRS. \\nIn July, she told the Daily Caller that \u201creports have shown that the Clinton Foundation has failed to accurately report tens of millions of dollars in foreign government grants, including some while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state.\u201d \\n\u201cThis should be troubling to all Americans as it gives the appearance that there could be a pay-to-play arrangement between the Clintons and foreign governments while the interests of the American people were pushed aside. The tax-exempt status of the foundation should be reviewed immediately,\u201d Blackburn said at the time. \\nSEE ALSO:'"}, "time": 1742562321.9372182}
