But Mr. Obama also spoke hard truths to both sides. Addressing a crowd of 2, 000 at a concert hall, the president chided the police for not understanding what he called the legitimate grievances of   who he said were victims of systemic racial bias. \u201cWe cannot simply turn away and dismiss those in peaceful protest as troublemakers or paranoid,\u201d Mr. Obama said to applause. \u201cWe can\u2019t simply dismiss it as a symptom of political correctness or reverse racism. To have your experience denied like that, dismissed by those in authority, dismissed perhaps even by your white friends and   and fellow church members again and again and again  \u2014   it hurts. \u201d But the president also turned to the protesters of the Black Lives Matter movement and said they were too quick to condemn the police. \u201cProtesters, you know it,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cYou know how dangerous some of the communities where these police officers serve are, and you pretend as if there\u2019s no context. These things we know to be true. \u201d It was the poignant speech of a man near the end of his patience about a scourge of violence that he said his own words had not been enough to stop. Mr. Obama spoke after a week in which the police killed two black men, in Minnesota and Louisiana, and Micah Johnson, the Army veteran, killed the five officers in Dallas. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken at too many memorials during the course of this presidency,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cI\u2019ve hugged too many families. I\u2019ve seen how inadequate words can be in bringing about lasting change. I\u2019ve seen how inadequate my own words have been. \u201d He acknowledged that the Dallas killings  \u2014   \u201can act not just of demented violence but of racial hatred\u201d  \u2014   had exposed a \u201cfault line\u201d in American democracy. He said he understood if Americans questioned whether the racial divide would ever be bridged. \u201cIt\u2019s as if the deepest fault lines of our democracy have suddenly been exposed, perhaps even widened,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cAnd although we know that such divisions are not new, though they have surely been worse in even the recent past, that offers us little comfort. \u201d Americans, he said, \u201ccan turn on the TV or surf the internet, and we can watch positions harden and lines drawn, and people retreat to their respective corners, and politicians calculate how to grab attention or avoid the fallout. We see all this, and it\u2019s hard not to think sometimes that the center won\u2019t hold and that things might get worse. \u201d But Mr. Obama insisted on holding out hope. \u201cDallas, I\u2019m here to say we must reject such despair,\u201d Mr. Obama said, adding that he knew that because of \u201cwhat I\u2019ve experienced in my own life, what I\u2019ve seen of this country and its people  \u2014   their goodness and decency  \u2014   as president of the United States. \u201d He cited both the Dallas police and protesters as part of that decency. \u201cWhen the bullets started flying, the men and women of the Dallas police, they did not flinch and they did not react recklessly,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThey showed incredible restraint. Helped in some cases by protesters, they evacuated the injured, isolated the shooter and saved more lives than we will ever know. We mourn fewer people today because of your brave actions. \u2018Everyone was helping each other,\u2019 one witness said. \u2018It wasn\u2019t about black or white. Everyone was picking each other up and moving them away. \u2019\u201d Mr. Obama concluded: \u201cSee, that\u2019s the America I know. \u201d A row of police officers behind Mr. Obama in the concert hall did not clap when Mr. Obama spoke of racial bias in the criminal justice system, saying that \u201cwhen all this takes place more than 50 years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act, we cannot simply turn away and dismiss those in peaceful protest as troublemakers or paranoid. \u201d But when Mr. Obama added, \u201cWe ask the police to do too much, and we ask too little of ourselves,\u201d the officers behind him applauded. Law enforcement officials who attended the service broadly welcomed Mr. Obama\u2019s remarks. \u201cTo me, this is one of his best speeches I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d said Chief Warren Asmus of the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department, who saw the speech as a milestone in the acrimonious national debate about policing and race. \u201cHe started to build that bridge that I think hasn\u2019t been built for a long time,\u201d Mr. Asmus said. \u201cFrom what I heard today, I see it as a turning point. \u201d But Chief Terrence M. Cunningham of the Wellesley, Mass. police said that while he liked much of Mr. Obama\u2019s speech, he was concerned about the president\u2019s discussion of the shootings by the police in Louisiana and Minnesota, which remain under investigation. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like he\u2019s put his thumb on the scale a little bit,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s let the facts come in. \u201d Some protesters responded positively to Mr. Obama\u2019s remarks. \u201cI liked his speech,\u201d said Dominique Alexander, the founder of Next Generation Action Network, an activist group in Dallas that organized the protest the night of the shooting. The president, he said, \u201cdid a good job\u201d in a situation where \u201cboth sides are mourning, both sides are hurting. \u201d Many conservatives were angry about a reference Mr. Obama made in his remarks to gun control, when he said that \u201cwe flood communities with so many guns that it is easier for a teenager to buy a Glock than get his hands on a computer or even a book. \u201d Three others spoke at the memorial, including former President George W. Bush, a Dallas resident who said his city was not prepared for the evil visited upon it on Thursday, nor could it have been. \u201cToday the nation grieves, but those of us who love Dallas and call it home have had five deaths in the family,\u201d Mr. Bush said. He said the forces pulling the country apart sometimes seemed greater than the ones bringing it together. \u201cToo often we judge other groups by their worst examples while judging ourselves by our best intentions,\u201d Mr. Bush said to applause. \u201cAnd this has strained our bonds of understanding and common purpose. \u201d The memorial was held in the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center, a cavernous concert hall with a massive   organ dominating the back of the stage. Nearly all of the auditorium\u2019s seats were filled, many with men and women wearing blue police uniforms from places like Massachusetts and South Carolina, and from towns throughout Texas, like League City, Huntsville, Robinson and La Marque. They walked into the hall under a giant American flag strung from fire trucks. On one side of the stage, five seats sat empty except for uniform hats and folded American flags to memorialize the five dead.'"}, "time": 1742564031.0573568}
