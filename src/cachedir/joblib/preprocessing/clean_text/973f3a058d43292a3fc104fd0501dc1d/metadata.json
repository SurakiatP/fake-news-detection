It appears that the president of Russia is ecstatic to work alongside business mogul turned statesman Mr. Trump. \\nVia ViralThread \\n\\nIt\u2019s well known that American-Russian relations are pretty grim right now. Within the past few months, Russia has practiced nuclear evacuation drills and launched airstrikes on the war-torn Syrian city of Aleppo. It seems as if we\u2019re entering a second Cold War, however president-elect Trump is hoping to change all of that.\\n\\nPresident Obama and Secretary of State Clinton also hoped to repair the relationship between the two old foes. Sadly however the conflicting ideologies between the Putin and Obama Administrations got in the way. Putin has previously pleaded Obama to come together with Russia. On Independence Day, he claimed: \u201cThe history of Russian-American relations shows that when we act as equal partners and respect each other\u2019s lawful interests we are able to successfully resolve the most complex international issues for the benefit of both countries\u2019 peoples and all of humanity.\u201d Try as he might though, Obama hasn\u2019t budged.\\n\\nJust a few month ago, Obama claimed: \u201cI\u2019m not confident that we can trust the Russians or Vladimir Putin, which is why we have to have to test whether or not we can get an actual cessation of hostilities that includes an end to the kinds of aerial bombing and civilian death and destruction that we have seen carried out by the Assad regime.\u201d\\nDifficulty surrounding stances on Ukraine and Syria are the main culprits for this distrust. So when Putin learned that he may have another shot at a healthy relationship with America (and Trump), he decided to celebrate.\\nPutin celebrated Donald Trump\u2019s win in the election with the hope of a stable relationship with America. Trump spoke about repairing the relationship with Russia in his campaign, something Putin took note of. In the clip below, it\u2019s clear that Trump will deal with Putin in a completely different way than Obama.\\nAt a foreign ambassadors meeting in Moscow, Putin expressed his satisfaction with the election, where he congratulated both the American people and president-elect Trump. Putin also told the ambassadors that he was hopeful for future prospects between the two superpowers, America and Russia, especially when it comes to efforts in Syria.\\n\\nFollowing his speech, Putin clinked glasses of champagne with the ambassadors in celebration. With the tensions between America and Russia growing at an alarming rate, the world has a watchful eye on what actions Mr. Trump will take when he finally enters the Oval Office.\\n\\n \\n'"}, "time": 1742561767.255175}
