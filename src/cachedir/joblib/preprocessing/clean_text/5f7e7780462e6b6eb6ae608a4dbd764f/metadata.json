[Richard Cordray directs the CFPB.   legislation tasked the CFPB with regulating mortgages and other consumer loans from predatory practices.  The Boston Globe reports that the White House will decide the future of the director, seen by critics as partisan, unconstitutional, and abusing his authority to regulate the consumer financial world. One lobbyist said, \u201cThey want to fire him. Their legal counsel are looking at every angle. \u201d Firing Cordray will not be as simple. The CFPB is an independent agency, and his term as director expires in 2018. Trump can only dismiss Cordray for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance. Sources say that the administration examines Cordray\u2019s   tenure as director to justify his termination. A Washington, D. C. circuit court ruled in October that the CFPB is, by design, unconstitutional. Judge Brett Kavanaugh wrote in the majority opinion, \u201cThe director of the CFPB possesses more unilateral authority  \u2014   that is, authority to take action on one\u2019s own, subject to no check  \u2014   than any single commissioner or board member in any other independent agency in the U. S. government. \u201d He continued, \u201cThe CFPB\u2019s concentration of enormous executive power in a single, unaccountable, unchecked director not only departs from settled historical practice, but also poses a far greater risk of arbitrary   and abuse of power, and a far greater threat to individual liberty, than does a   independent agency. \u201d Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s opinion gave a blistering refutation of the CFPB, until this month when a U. S. appeals court agreed to reconsider the D. C. court\u2019s opinion to repeal his job protection. The U. S. appeals court will start in May. Republicans believe that the CFPB has made it harder for Republicans to get credit. Other conservatives contend that accountable to the president or Congress. Reformers in Congress want Congress, not the Federal Reserve, to fund the CFPB. Senator Ben Sasse ( ) said, \u201cThe CFPB has done some things that are good, and they\u2019ve done some things . . . that are really bad  . There are counties in Nebraska where you really can\u2019t get a mortgage, and it\u2019s because of CFPB and larger   overregulation. \u201d He continued, \u201cIf people in Nebraska have a problem that\u2019s actually created by bad   by the CFPB, who do they complain to? Who really has the power? He doesn\u2019t report anywhere. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628517.8051026}
