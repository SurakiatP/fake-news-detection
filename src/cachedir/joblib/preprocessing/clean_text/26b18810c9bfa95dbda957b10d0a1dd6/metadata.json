And that was before a series of freewheeling phone calls with foreign leaders that has unnerved diplomats at home and abroad. In the calls, he voiced admiration for one of the world\u2019s most durable despots, the president of Kazakhstan, and said he hoped to visit a country, Pakistan, that President Obama has steered clear of during nearly eight years in office. Mr. Trump told the British prime minister, Theresa May, \u201cIf you travel to the U. S. you should let me know,\u201d an offhand invitation that came only after he spoke to nine other leaders. He later compounded it by saying on Twitter that Britain should name the   leader Nigel Farage its ambassador to Washington, a startling break with diplomatic protocol. Mr. Trump\u2019s unfiltered exchanges have drawn international attention since the election, most notably when he met Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan with only one other American in the room, his daughter Ivanka Trump  \u2014   dispensing with the usual practice of using State   talking points. On Thursday, the White House weighed in with an offer of professional help. The press secretary, Josh Earnest, urged the   to make use of the State Department\u2019s policy makers and diplomats in planning and conducting his encounters with foreign leaders. \u201cPresident Obama benefited enormously from the advice and expertise that\u2019s been shared by those who serve at the State Department,\u201d Mr. Earnest said. \u201cI\u2019m confident that as   Trump takes office, those same State Department employees will stand ready to offer him advice as he conducts the business of the United States overseas. \u201d \u201cHopefully he\u2019ll take it,\u201d he added. A spokesman for the State Department, John Kirby, said the department was \u201chelping facilitate and support calls as requested. \u201d But he declined to give details, and it was not clear to what extent Mr. Trump was availing himself of the nation\u2019s diplomats. Mr. Trump\u2019s conversation with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan has generated the most angst, because, as Mr. Earnest put it, the relationship between Mr. Sharif\u2019s country and the United States is \u201cquite complicated,\u201d with disputes over issues ranging from counterterrorism to nuclear proliferation. In a remarkably candid readout of the phone call, the Pakistani government said Mr. Trump had told Mr. Sharif that he was \u201ca terrific guy\u201d who made him feel as though \u201cI\u2019m talking to a person I have known for long. \u201d He described Pakistanis as \u201cone of the most intelligent people. \u201d When Mr. Sharif invited him to visit Pakistan, the   replied that he would \u201clove to come to a fantastic country, fantastic place of fantastic people. \u201d The Trump transition office, in its more circumspect readout, said only that Mr. Trump and Mr. Sharif \u201chad a productive conversation about how the United States and Pakistan will have a strong working relationship in the future. \u201d It did not confirm or deny the Pakistani account of Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks. The breezy tone of the readout left diplomats in Washington   with some initially assuming it was a parody. In particular, they zeroed in on Mr. Trump\u2019s offer to Mr. Sharif \u201cto play any role you want me to play to address and find solutions to the country\u2019s problems. \u201d That was interpreted by some in India as an offer by the United States to mediate Pakistan\u2019s border dispute with India in Kashmir, something that the Pakistanis have long sought and that India has long resisted. \u201cBy taking such a cavalier attitude to these calls, he\u2019s encouraging people not to take him seriously,\u201d said Daniel F. Feldman, a former special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan. \u201cHe\u2019s made himself not only a bull in a china shop, but a bull in a nuclear china shop. \u201d Husain Haqqani, a former Pakistani ambassador to Washington, said his government\u2019s decision to release a rough transcript of Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks was a breach of protocol that demonstrated how easily Pakistani leaders misread signals from their American counterparts. \u201cPakistan is one country where knowing history and details matters most,\u201d Mr. Haqqani said, \u201cand where the U. S. cannot afford to give wrong signals, given the history of misunderstandings. \u201d At one level, Mr. Trump\u2019s warm sentiments were surprising, given that during the campaign, he called for temporarily barring Muslims from entering the United States to avoid importing   terrorists. His conversation with Mr. Sharif also came a day after an attack at Ohio State University in which a   student, Abdul Razak Ali Artan, rammed a car into a group of pedestrians and slashed several people with a knife before being shot and killed by the police. Law enforcement officials said Mr. Artan, whom the Islamic State has claimed as a \u201csoldier,\u201d had lived in Pakistan for seven years before coming to the United States in 2014. Mr. Obama never visited Pakistan as president, even though he had a circle of Pakistani friends in college and spoke fondly of the country. The White House weighed a visit at various times but always decided against it, according to officials, because of security concerns or because it would be perceived as rewarding Pakistani leaders for what many American officials said was their lack of help in fighting terrorism. \u201cIt sends a powerful message to the people of a country when the president of the United States goes to visit,\u201d Mr. Earnest said. \u201cThat\u2019s true whether it\u2019s some of our closest allies, or that\u2019s also true if it\u2019s a country like Pakistan, with whom our relationship is somewhat more complicated. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s call with President Nursultan A. Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan raised similar questions. Mr. Nazarbayev has ruled his country with an iron hand since 1989, first as head of the Communist Party and later as president after Kazakhstan won its independence from the Soviet Union. In April 2015, he won a fifth term, winning 97. 7 percent of the vote and raising suspicions of fraud. The Kazakh government, in its account of Mr. Trump\u2019s conversation, said he had lavished praise on the president for his leadership of the country over the last 25 years. \u201cD. Trump stressed that under the leadership of Nursultan Nazarbayev, our country over the years of independence had achieved fantastic success that can be called a \u2018miracle,\u2019\u201d it said. The statement went on to say that Mr. Trump had shown solidarity with the Kazakh government over its decision to voluntarily surrender the nuclear arsenal it inherited from the Soviets. \u201cThere is no more important issue than the nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation, which must be addressed in a global context,\u201d it quoted Mr. Trump as saying. Mr. Trump\u2019s statement said that Mr. Nazarbayev had congratulated him on his victory, and that Mr. Trump had reciprocated by congratulating him on the 25th anniversary of his country. Beyond that, it said only that the two leaders had \u201caddressed the importance of strengthening regional partnerships. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628552.5761583}
