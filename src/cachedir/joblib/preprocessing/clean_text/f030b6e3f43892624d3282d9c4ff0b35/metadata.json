President Donald Trump condemned the \u201cevil losers\u201d who carried out last night\u2019s bombing of a pop concert in Manchester in which at least 22 people were murdered. [\u201cI extend my deepest condolences to those terribly injured in this terrorist attack, and to the many killed, and the families, so many families, of the victims,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe stand in absolute solidarity with the people in the United Kingdom. So many young innocent people living and enjoying their lives, murdered by evil losers in life. \u201d  \u201cI won\u2019t call them monsters, because they would like that term,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey would think that\u2019s a great name. I will call them from now on losers, because that\u2019s what they are, they\u2019re losers. and we\u2019ll have more of them, but they\u2019re losers. Just remember that. \u201d \u201cThis is what I\u2019ve spent these last few days talking about during my trip overseas,\u201d Trump said, referring to combatting terrorism. \u201cOur society can have no tolerance for this continuation of bloodshed. We cannot stand a moment longer for the slaughter of innocent people. \u201d \u201cThe terrorists and extremists and those who give them aid and comfort must be driven out from our society forever,\u201d Trump added. \u201cThis wicked ideology must be obliterated, and I mean completely obliterated, and innocent life must be protected. All civilized nations must join together to protect human life and the sacred right of our citizens to live in safety and in peace. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562046.1950655}
