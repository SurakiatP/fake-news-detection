Stop bleeding in 10 seconds with this simple trick! \\n\\nCayenne pepper does much more than just add spice to culinary dishes. This miracle working substance can also stop bleeding in less than one minute under most circumstances. It works miracles because cayenne pepper reacts with the body to equalize the blood pressure. This means that cayenne will keep the extra gushing of pressure from becoming concentrated in the wound area as it normally is. Blood will instead quickly clot when the pressure is equalized. \\n\\nTopical Application \\n\\nCayenne can be sprinkled directly onto the wound with absolutely no modification. You can also dissolve it in a bit of water and saturate a piece of gauze to be placed over the wound area. \\n\\nInternal Application \\n\\nCayenne pepper can also be taken orally. Dissolve a teaspoon of cayenne in one cup of water and drink it down. If the taste of this seems like a bit too much, simply dissolve a teaspoon of cayenne into the juice of half a lemon and a dash of maple syrup. \\n\\nOther Uses \\n\\nWhile cayenne can stop bleeding from exterior wounds, it also works for internal hemorrhages inside the nose, stomach, and throat if taken orally. Cayenne can also work to improve blood circulation, assist digestion, stimulate perspiration and saliva, and lessen pain from swollen or arthritic joints and limbs. \\n\\nCayenne salves are great as deep heating balms for cramps, stiff neck, arthritis, sore muscles, etc. Make your own cayenne salve with olive oil, cayenne, oil of wintergreen, pure distilled mint crystals, and beeswax.'"}, "time": 1742563563.5205655}
