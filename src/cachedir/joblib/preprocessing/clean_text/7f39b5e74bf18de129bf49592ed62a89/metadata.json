The Trump administration took shape as more cabinet choices emerged. The Transportation Department, the focus of the  \u2019s pledge to spend billions on rebuilding infrastructure, will be headed by Elaine Chao, above, a former labor secretary who is married to the Senate\u2019s top Republican, Mitch McConnell. Steven Terner Mnuchin, a financier with deep roots on Wall Street and in Hollywood but no government experience, is expected to be named Treasury secretary as soon as Wednesday, people close to the transition say. Tom Price, a   Republican congressman from Georgia, is the choice to head the Department of Health and Human Services, meaning that a chief critic of President Obama\u2019s health care initiative will oversee its future. Here\u2019s the full list of Cabinet choices. The push for a vote recount is quietly advancing, even though reversing Donald Trump\u2019s win seems unlikely. ____ 2. On Twitter, Mr. Trump\u2019s subject of the day was flag burning, possibly in response to a Fox News segment about a protest at a Massachusetts college. He proposed that flag burners could be stripped of their citizenship. The Supreme Court has already ruled that such a penalty is unconstitutional. ____ 3. Only a handful of people survived the crash of a chartered plane in Colombia, which killed most of the members of a wildly successful Brazilian soccer team and journalists traveling with them. \u201cThe shock is so intense that it\u2019s nearly impossible to remain calm,\u201d one of Brazil\u2019s most eminent soccer journalists said. ____ 4. Firefighters are still battling the remnants of wildfires in Tennessee that forced thousands of people to evacuate their homes in Gatlinburg, in the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains. Hundreds of buildings were damaged, and three deaths were reported. Video shot by residents shows flames lining the edge of the highways used for evacuations. ____ 5. Scientists reported that the recent coral   at the Great Barrier Reef, a World Heritage site off the coast of Australia, was the worst ever recorded. Warm waters this year bleached and weakened the coral, and environmentalists say the government is not doing enough to protect the reef. ____ 6. President Park   of South Korea offered to step down in a televised address. But opposition lawmakers said they would still insist on a vote to impeach Ms. Park, who was named a criminal suspect in an   scandal. ____ 7. As many as 2, 000 veterans from diverse backgrounds plan to serve as human shields for Dakota Access Pipeline protesters near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota. The veterans\u2019 plan may run up against the Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 plan to close off access to the protesters\u2019 campsite by Dec. 5, as well as an evacuation order for the protest site issued by the governor, who cited \u201canticipated harsh weather conditions. \u201d ___ 8. With Fidel Castro gone and Mr. Trump threatening to undo President Obama\u2019s d\u00e9tente with Cuba, what\u2019s next for the island? Much of the warming relationship was accomplished through executive action, which could be reversed. But analysts say it would be legally difficult, as American companies have already invested millions to enter the market. ____ 9. News organizations are examining their use of the term   to refer to the   white nationalist movement that came into focus as part of Mr. Trump\u2019s base. Above, an   gathering in Washington this month. Critics say the term is a euphemism and legitimizes hateful ideologies. The New York Times is encouraging its reporters to explain what the term means, rather than use it as a label. ___ 10. Finally, we\u2019d like to help you reclaim one of the joys of winter. America\u2019s inexorable march to processed food turned chicken soup into something to buy, not make. But our food writer offers some expert advice  \u2014   don\u2019t toss the skin!  \u2014   on how to make a fragrant, golden, savory version sure to keep you warm.
