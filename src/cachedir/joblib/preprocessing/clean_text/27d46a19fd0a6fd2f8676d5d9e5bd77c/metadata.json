function wunsch expand even lecture accord wunsch little onethird energy body require maintain thermal equilibrium come food eat electron transfer food primarily fat carbohydrate ultimately transfer oxygen generate atp near infrared get less nutritional energy require maintain thermal homeostasis say differentiation order metabolically use energy come food thermodynamic aspect well maintain normal body temperature degree c degree f involve two mechanism energy production mitochondria food photonic energy nearinfrare radiation sunlight incandescent light bulb able penetrate deeply tissue even clothing radiation enter body transform long wavelength infrared part important support temperature level thermal energy level body crucial aspect lot energy come form radiation support thermal balance wunsch explain key takehome message bodys energy production involve food intake also need exposure certain wavelength light order metabolism function optimally yet another reason sun exposure vitally important optimal health analog versus digital lighting lead lamp form digital nonthermal lighting whereas incandescent light bulb halogen analog thermal light source color change system three different led red green blue lead intensity three color channel change order achieve different color use perceive eye end control intensity output lead realize digital manner difficult low intensity many different step dimming led realize socalled pulsewidth modulation mean led switch full intensity fully switch switch constant frequency high eye able discriminate cellular level still perceivable cell cause flicker perceivable let say percent population still biologically active flicker something harmful biology likely experience old enough recall old tv visible intense flicker modern flat screen perceptible flicker still switch scientist try develop system capable transmit information via highfrequency flicker led lighting replace wireless lan system accord wunsch bad idea health perspective call led trojan horse appear practical we appear many advantage save energy solid state robust invite home aware many stealth healthrobbing property harmful biology harmful mental health harmful retinal health also harmful hormonal endocrine health say unfortunately use led mandate federal policy us much europe attempt conserve energy inarguably effective regard biological impact bulb completely ignore mandate option restrict understand danger led understand led harm health begin recognition light emit led bulb different quality natural light source normally natural light source black body radiator give kind wavelength less continuous manner led fluorescent lamp consist blue lead driver lead fluorescent sheet cover blue lead transform part blue light long wavelength thereby create yellowish light yellowish light fluorescent layer combine together residual blue light kind whitish light large portion aggressive blue light blue high energy visible part spectrum produce infuse production ros oxidative stress say blue light cause ros tissue stress need balance nearinfrare present led need even regeneration blue light regenerative part spectrum find blue short wavelength part find long wavelength part red nearinfrare tissue regeneration tissue repair result wavelength present led spectrum increase stress short wavelength part reduce regeneration repair long wavelength part primary problem not kind light quality nature consequence stress consequence retina consequence endocrine system probably know blue light evening reduce melatonin production pineal gland also cell retina responsible produce melatonin order regenerate retina night use lead light sunset reduce regenerative restore capacity eye needless say less regeneration end degeneration case degeneration lead amd primary cause blindness among elderly however fail appreciate lead light exposure balance full sunlight load red part spectrum always damage biology night summarize main problem led fact emit primarily blue wavelength lack counterbalance healing regenerative nearinfrare frequency little red infrared wavelength require repair regeneration use aggressive low frequency blue light create ros generate excess cause damage use led end increase damage decrease repair regeneration healthy led wide range lead light market day cool white other warm white example former emit high amount harmful blue light warm led deceptive give warmappeare light actually red wavelength warmth come mask blue high amount yellow orange also led available less blue close spectral distribution incandescent lamp regard blue part spectrum unfortunately without tool measure will not know exactly get sharp contrast incandescent light bulb know exactly kind light spectrum get lead layman able tell tailored spectrum blue part mask excessive part spectral region wunsch say different technology soraa example violet driver lead blue technology red little bit emphasize compare standard white light fluorescent led fact well bad lead type around spectral distribution one thing interested r represent full red information sometimes give package example cri color render index r sign customer high level high index r identify healthy lead buy led one way get healthy light look cri sunlight gold standard cri incandescent light bulb candle look light r full red spectrum cri close ever get natural light lead another factor look color temperature two different kind color temperature physical color temperature mean temperature light degree kelvin k apply sunlight candlelight incandescent

somehow lead produce flicker two three year ago would much easy camera old smartphone hightech equip today old smartphone camera look light source see wander line detect light source flicker wunsch explain simple way would purchase flicker detector available fairly inexpensively another way determine flicker rate would use slow motion mode camera record light source slow motion mode check visible flickering unfortunately not always work new camera smartphone build algorithm detect flicker frequency change shutter speed accordingly improve recording thereby eliminate interference camera algorithm record visible flicker even healthy solution like cutting edge technology quickly switch incandescent bulb led lighting realize enormity mistake time go back almost year completely unaware could health consequence use fullspectrum fluorescent equally deceptive full spectrum name convince lead light exposure serious danger especially room without natural light biological risk somewhat mitigated plenty sunlight stream window night led become great danger matter whether windowless room counterbalance nearinfrare light personally swap light back incandescent energy hog light night switch clear incandescent bulb without coating change beneficial wavelength takehome message interview grab supply old incandescent switch back incandescent light bulb remember get incandescent crystal clear coat white give cool white light want k incandescent thermal analog light source actually fragrancefree candle would even well particularly mindful use type light night sunset also use blueblocke glass definitely good idea keep away short wavelength evening sunset also good idea intoxicate environment much light know artificial light level night reach insane intensity candle
