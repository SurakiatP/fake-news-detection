The king of Morocco had personally pledged to give $12 million with the understanding she\u2019d attend, according to emails released last week by WikiLeaks. \\nBut then there was the awkward fact that Clinton would be running for president by then. That set up a bind: Go to the event, and Clinton would be appearing to indulge a foreign government known for egregious human right abuses to help her family\u2019s private charity. Pull out, and Clinton would be going back on her word to the Moroccan king. \\n\u201cThe King has personally committed approx $12 million both for the endowment and to support the meeting. It will break a lot of china to back out now when we had so many opportunities to do it in the past few months,\u201d Clinton aide Huma Abedin wrote in an email in November 2014, several months before Clinton declared her candidacy. \u201cShe created this mess.\u201d \\nHillary Clinton ultimately decided against attending, and Chelsea Clinton and Bill Clinton went instead. (Politico has reported a Moroccan phosphate export firm gave \u201cat least\u201d $1 million, but it\u2019s not clear if the other $11 million came through. The foundation doesn\u2019t have to disclose the gift and has declined to confirm one way or another to reporters.) \\nBut since this story broke late last week, Clinton has been getting attacked for it far and wide. And this time it\u2019s not just Donald Trump and Fox News: Even mainstream outlets like the Atlantic and the Associated Press have published tough pieces about the controversy. (The Huffington Post said it amounted to a \u201cbrutal, clean hit\u201d on the Democratic nominee.) \\nThis controversy has stoked wildly misleading allegations implying that Clinton is corrupt, even in some leading news outlets. But while those claims are overblown, the story still illustrates how the foundation helped put wealthy donors into Clinton\u2019s orbit \u2014 and allowed them to buy a rare chance to shape her perspective that few average Americans will ever get.
