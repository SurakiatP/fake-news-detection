Gorsuch stressed that Amendments protecting freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and private property also show the how determined the Founders were to protect liberty.  Sasse pointed out that a number of teachers in Nebraska planned to use the Supreme Court confirmation hearings to teach civics in their classrooms. Sasse stressed that the Constitution \u201cis a negative document  \u2014   it is not the government giving us freedoms, it is us giving the government a limited set of enumerated powers. \u201d He explained that we did not originally have a Bill of Rights and asked, \u201cWhy do we have a Bill of Rights and what fundamental difference would it make if we didn\u2019t have one. \u201d Sasse tweeted Gorsuch\u2019s answer: Asked Judge Gorsuch for quick overview of why we have the Bill of Rights. It\u2019s worth watching his answer. #GorsuchHearing pic. twitter.   \u2014   Senator Ben Sasse (@SenSasse) March 22, 2017,  Gorsuch said, \u201cThe Constitution is a negative document. And the theory behind it, in short order, was to divide power to better protect liberty. That was the theory. If you put all power into one set of hands you are going to get tyranny. And our Founders had too much evidence of that in their own time. \u201d He went on to explain how the Constitution divides the federal government into three branches  \u2014   stressing that this division was intended to safeguard liberty  \u2014   and how the states retain and enjoy the powers not given to the federal government, another safeguard. But Gorsuch said these safeguards \u201cwere not thought enough,\u201d thus the Bill of Rights. He said, \u201cOur Founders were very suspicious and very jealous of their liberties, so they added the Bill of Rights  \u2026     and they enumerated 10 of them, starting with the freedom of speech, freedom of religion, no establishment of religion, [and] the right to bear arms. \u201d He pointed to the Third Amendment, which shields Americans from having the government commandeer private property for the purposes of housing soldiers. Gorsuch smiled and said he was glad issues tied to the Third Amendment are not litigated much.
