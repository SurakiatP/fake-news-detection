Talking about it put smiles on band members\u2019 faces in an   string of interviews last month at the Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills, a few days after the band\u2019s jubilant set at the first weekend of the Desert Trip festival in Indio, Calif. \u201cThis album,\u201d said the drummer, Charlie Watts, \u201cis what I\u2019ve always wanted the Stones to do. It\u2019s what we do best and what we did when we first got together. \u201d In conversation, they play   roles: Mr. Watts as   and supportive, the guitarist Ronnie Wood still treating himself as a new band member (he joined in 1975) Mr. Richards as the    roots music fan and Mick Jagger as the extrovert and  . \u201cBlue  Lonesome\u201d is not the batch of new   songs that the band has been laboring over intermittently for years between bursts of touring, like the Latin American tour that concluded with an unprecedented concert in Havana and that has been the subject of two documentaries: \u201cOl\u00e9 Ol\u00e9 Ol\u00e9\u201d and \u201cHavana Moon. \u201d In recent years, the band has tried to follow up on touring momentum with recording sessions. But the new songs, Mr. Jagger said with a frown, currently add up to \u201chalf an album. \u201d Mr. Wood said new songs need time to settle in. \u201cIt\u2019s like putting it on top of the strainer and seeing what soaks through by the time you come back to them again,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe lumps that are left on top after time has gone by, that\u2019s what you make your dough out of. \u201d He added, \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me if we recut them all again. It\u2019s one of those things. \u201d Instead, \u201cBlue  Lonesome\u201d is a set of a dozen blues songs that were originally recorded, mostly in the   by titans like Howlin\u2019 Wolf, Little Walter and Jimmy Reed. It was the breakthrough era of electric Chicago blues: a modernized, urbanized, amplified update of music from the Deep South. \u201cThese guys were basically inventing,\u201d Mr. Richards said. \u201cThey had nothing to fall back on. They\u2019d got these new guitars and amplifiers. They were all feeling their way through it. So there\u2019s a feeling about that particular period of the blues which we could identify with, because you could hear the guys egging each other on and wondering where it\u2019s going to go. \u201d The style was barely a decade old when it changed the lives of the English teenagers who would become the Rolling Stones, along with a generation of musicians worldwide. The rest is rock history, as the blues has been transplanted, revamped, venerated, repeatedly rediscovered and sometimes plundered, with its ideas ricocheting across cultural and geographical divides long before the more recent discussions about cultural appropriation. The blues became one of the foundations of rock, though its influence has been waning in recent decades. \u201cSounds have changed,\u201d Mr. Jagger said. \u201cWhat makes you excited now is not the same. In music, everything\u2019s different. But the blues still have something about them that\u2019s really good. I love all kinds of music, and I still listen to the blues. \u201d The songs for \u201cBlue  Lonesome\u201d were all on his iPod. Half a century on, playing vintage blues songs is an act of preservation and reclamation  \u2014   and for the Rolling Stones, who have always been careful to credit their sources, a matter of continuity. \u201cWe\u2019ve known these songs for 50 years,\u201d Mr. Jagger said. \u201cIt is a learned idiom. It\u2019s like me singing in Italian. If I\u2019d been doing that for 50 years, you wouldn\u2019t ask me, \u2018How do you feel about singing in Italian?\u2019 I don\u2019t feel anything about singing in Italian, I always sang in Italian.\u2019 It works most of the time. It\u2019s like, you just have to go with it and suspend disbelief. \u201cTo me it\u2019s a homage to all those people that we\u2019ve always loved since we were kids,\u201d he added. \u201cI can see why people might find it vaguely not correct, but we\u2019ve always done it. And the artists themselves, they never objected. \u201d \u201cBlue  Lonesome\u201d was recorded nearly a year ago, on the spur of the moment. While planning for recording sessions, Mr. Richards recalled, he emailed Mr. Wood, urging him to learn \u201cBlue and Lonesome\u201d by the   singer and harmonica player Little Walter. \u201cIf Keith says something like that, there\u2019s a reason for it,\u201d said Don Was, the Stones\u2019 longtime  . \u201cI don\u2019t think he meant, \u2018Go do this because we\u2019re going to do a blues album.\u2019 More like, \u2018Let\u2019s apply the principles of \u201cBlue and Lonesome\u201d to what we\u2019re doing here. \u2019\u201d The sessions took place in December at British Grove Studios, a West London complex owned by Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits. There, the Stones were recording together in a large open room with a setup generally used to record classical music: a tall,   contraption called a Decca tree, which uses overhead microphones to capture what a conductor hears. (The tree was devised at Decca Records, the Stones\u2019 first label British Grove also has a vintage Decca mixing console, Mr. Was said.) It was a deliberately   configuration: not layering isolated instruments, but demanding an    live approach. The band was \u201ca little unsure of the studio and the sound of it,\u201d Mr. Richards recalled. So it fell back on the blues. \u201cI looked at Ronnie and said, \u2018Let\u2019s put a hold on this new stuff while we try and figure things out and get the room warmed up. O. K.: \u2018Blue and Lonesome.\u2019 \u201cAnd it comes out that suddenly the room\u2019s opened up and the sound is there,\u201d Mr. Richards continued. \u201cAnd then, \u2018That was damned good, man!\u2019 Mick turns around and says, \u2018Let\u2019s do Howlin\u2019 Wolf\u2019s \u201cCommit a Crime\u201d\u2019  \u2014   and it really just led from there. No preplanning, no real instigation. Suddenly Mick just jumped on this train that he\u2019s so good at. \u201d Mr. Richards recalled thinking: \u201cKeep rolling, keep rolling! I don\u2019t care how many you do  \u2014   just catch it while the man\u2019s in the mood. \u201d He laughed. \u201cIt just bloody happened. That was the amazing thing and the beauty of it,\u201d he said. At the end of the first session, the Stones had recorded five songs. \u201cNo one said, \u2018We should do a blues album,\u2019\u201d Mr. Was said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, when a guy\u2019s throwing a   you don\u2019t talk to him about it in the middle of the game. \u201d Still, Mr. Was suggested that Mr. Jagger choose more songs band members who didn\u2019t know them learned them over a weekend. With further serendipity, Eric Clapton was also at British Grove, doing some mixing, and in the next session he ended up sitting in on two songs, joining the improvisational weave of guitars. Mr. Richards was happy to, as he said, \u201cJust roll it, decide later what to do with it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was only at the end, when we\u2019d got 12 tracks and Don Was and I were talking together, and Mick was there and he was saying, \u2018This is an album. You can\u2019t chop this up. \u2019\u201d Mr. Wood recalled, \u201cI got a text from Mick saying, \u2018The blues tracks are really sounding good.\u2019 And I thought, is this from the Jagger that I know? Because he never, never says that things are happening well. \u201d Mr. Jagger described the album as \u201can exercise in sprezzatura\u201d  \u2014   a term for hiding skillful effort behind seeming nonchalance. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to concentrate, but it can\u2019t sound like it\u2019s difficult. And it doesn\u2019t,\u201d he said. The Stones tucked lifelong blues scholarship behind the kick and yowl of the music. As they delved into individual songs, the band praised the   studio musicians who forged the Chicago sound: guitarists like Howlin\u2019 Wolf\u2019s sideman Hubert Sumlin (with whom Mr. Richards shared regular jam sessions) and drummers like Freddy Below and Earl Phillips. \u201cWhen I was doing my song choices, I was thinking about tempos, moods, keys, different emotions,\u201d Mr. Jagger said. But feel came first. \u201cThey\u2019ve still got to blow you away a bit. They\u2019ve still got to be exciting. \u201d The songs on \u201cBlue  Lonesome\u201d are, deliberately,   choices rather than   war horses. The Jimmy Reed song, for instance, isn\u2019t \u201cBig Boss Man\u201d but the spooky, echoey, melancholy \u201cLittle Rain. \u201d From Howlin\u2019 Wolf, Mr. Jagger chose two tales of fierce, comic romantic strife and churning rhythm: \u201cJust Like I Treat You\u201d and \u201cCommit a Crime. \u201d Little Walter\u2019s songs  \u2014   there are four on the album  \u2014   fell naturally into Mr. Jagger\u2019s vocal range and gave him a chance to play lots of harmonica. Many of the songs elude the regularity of   blues they add or skip beats, start vocals in unexpected places, lurch and leap.     have often flattened out those quirks, but the Stones maintain them. \u201cIt\u2019s not like rock music or programmed drum music,\u201d Mr. Jagger said. \u201cIt pulsates in a very weird way, where each bar is different. And that\u2019s what\u2019s interesting about this kind of music when it\u2019s played properly. It has a swerve, and it has a dynamism about it. \u201d Mr. Jagger also noted that while the songs were recorded almost entirely in real time, the final mixes were painstaking. \u201cI just looked back at the original records, and we wanted some of these moods,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery track is different. We all thought it was going to be easy but it wasn\u2019t. \u201d Still, after more than a decade between albums, \u201cBlue  Lonesome\u201d may have loosened up the Stones for their own new songs. Sessions for the next studio album are still in progress. \u201cWe did things after we\u2019d done this and I\u2019d say, \u2018O. K. just play it! It\u2019s only got three chords, just play it, stop thinking about it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Jagger said. \u201c\u2018Just imagine this is a blues. \u2019\u201d'"}, "time": 1742561722.4650261}
