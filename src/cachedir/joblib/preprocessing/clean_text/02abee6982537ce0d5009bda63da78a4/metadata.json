Anonymous, the infamous group responsible for hacking multiple high-level officials and agencies, just made a grave announcement: \\n\u201cIt\u2019s over, folks. \\nThey are absolutely taking this from Trump. If you were able to see these stories they already have prepared for us to start running next week, your jaw would hit the ground. \\nThey are going to \u201cfind\u201d that the results were indeed \u201chacked\u201d. They have everything set in place, and have been ready to play this out for over a week. \\nAll 3 states (Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania) are going to be reversed and awarded to Hillary Clinton. Speculations are in the midst of who is pulling the strings, but this is undoubtedly going to happen. \\nStart preparing for the news to pour in, NOW. \\nWhen Michigan is reversed, it will send a clear message of irreversible corruption; the state had only paper ballots. Furthermore, the votes have already been certified. The stringent program was designed specifically to defend against cyber attacks.\u201d \\nThere is already evidence that death threats were sent to multiple electors, but that didn\u2019t work. Jill stein has already raised enough money to trigger a complete recount of the votes in Wisconsin\u2014the other 2 states are even cheaper. This is BAD News \\nTrump may have taken Michigan, but it won\u2019t matter. Jill Stein demanded a recount, and as a third party it will be carried out. The election WILL be rigged. January 20 th is literally 2 months away. Do you seriously think they are going to remain idle for 2 months? \\nI\u2019m a realist\u2014I call it like it is and I don\u2019t care who I offend. But, do not be mistaken. This is BAD news. \\nIt\u2019s already happening. Multiple fake \u201ccomputer experts\u201d have stated there are \u201canomalies\u201d in the vote that favor Trump. Who have they blamed? Russia. \\nSo then what happened next? Jill Stein was able to push a recount order on these grounds. If foul play is \u201cdetected\u201d, a recount can be initiated (even if the \u201cfoul play\u201d is completely false and planned as a scapegoat to initiate the recount for Hillary). Rogue Hacking Groups Like Anonymous And WikiLeaks Gave Us A TREMENDOUS Amount Of Factual Information During The Election Race. This Warning Is Not To Be Taken Lightly. \\nBut wait a second. How is Jill Stein connected to Hillary and why would the recount benefit Clinton? The answer lies in a serious screw-up that became apparent when a bot was found in the donation system. \\nGo to the fundraising website and see for yourself! The campaign was started literally yesterday and already has over $4,000,000 in donations! This Is NO Coincidence. Do You Think A Man Who Has Spent BILLIONS Will Stop Now? The Media Is On His Side, Pushing The Entire Narrative! \\nThat\u2019s not the scary part though. What gives away the entire operation is the behavior of the donations. The funding came in at an absolutely perfect $160,000 per hour. That wouldn\u2019t be odd, except the donations continued full speed through the middle of the night when all of America was asleep! \\nJill Stein now has the money she needs to initiate the recount. Where did the funds come from? Soros. The mainstream media is pushing the narrative hard right now that the votes were hacked, even In Pennsylvania where that\u2019s not even possible . \\nThey are openly and brazenly lying about everything. Google, Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter are all censoring the spread of this information, creating dissent and misinformation. To make things even worse, the establishment has launched a campaign against \u201cfake news\u201d, allowing the mainstream media to dictate reality for hundreds of millions of Americans who receive constant news! \\nThis is BAD news people, and it\u2019s about to get even worse. There is no reason they would be attempting to pull this stunt unless they had absolute certainty it would execute successfully. \\nPlease spread word of what is about to come. I will continue to keep you informed, but you must join me in this fight and spread word. This news is being suppressed on literally every channel. We must fight back. \\nAlex Cooper, CDP, Reports.
