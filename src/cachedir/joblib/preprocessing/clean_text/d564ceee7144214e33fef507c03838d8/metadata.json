It also set up a system of federal insurance marketplaces. The local media can sometimes make it sound more confusing without meaning to. \\nPresident Bill Clinton helped explain it during a recent speech. He said : \u201cAll the headlines are full of the stories that average premiums are going up 22 percent. But the subheadline is, if you\u2019re in the healthcare program, your subsidies are going up too so the increase won\u2019t be as much.\u201d \\nAlso, 70 percent of people buying insurance on the Marketplace will be able to get a plan for under $75 per month. \\nHe further said : \u201cSo you\u2019ve got one proposal, her opponent, just repeal it and go back to the way it used to be.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a terrible idea. More than 20 million people would lose their health insurance. Families that can now insure their kids up to age 26 wouldn\u2019t be able to do it anymore and 100 percent of Americans would be worse off because you today cannot deny someone coverage based on a preexisting condition. We do not want to get rid of that.\u201d \\nHe did talk about some of the disadvantages of the law, but it is still better than Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump\u2019s non-plan . \\nClinton said : \u201cThe people who are getting killed in this deal are the small business people and individuals who make just a little too much to get in on these subsidies.\u201d \\nYes, the co-pays and drug prices are high. However, the Marketplace is the only way some people can get insurance. If your employer doesn\u2019t offer healthcare or if you are self-employed, you would be screwed under the old rules. We need to fix this system, not throw it away. \\nHere is a video of the Young Turks talking about Bill Clinton\u2019s Obamacare speech: \\nFeatured image is a YouTube screengrab.
