S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.  Listen below: \u201cWhy is the president of the United States playing footsie with Abbas, who is a known terrorist?\u201d Levin asked. \u201cAbbas dresses nicely, he comes to the U. S. and he makes what people consider reasonable demands and then when he goes back, the [PA] continue[s] to fund terrorism, they continue to encourage their children in elementary schools  \u2014   and even in preschool  \u2014   to become suicide bombers. I\u2019m not even talking about Hamas, I\u2019m talking about Fatah  \u2014   the moderates!\u201d Abbas, who Levin notes received his PhD for a thesis denying the Holocaust, is a \u201cgruesome, loathsome, genocidal maniac who is treated as if he\u2019s some kind of statesman. \u201d Trump met with Abbas on May 3 in Washington and is due to meet him again next week in Bethlehem during his visit to Israel. According to Levin, Trump \u201cmay not be informed\u201d and instead has been placing his trust in people like Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and \u201cmilitary bureaucrat\u201d H. R. McMaster, Trump\u2019s national security advisor, both of whom, Levin argued, are \u201cpushing the agenda\u201d that a two state solution is still possible. Levin said, \u201cSo quickly and easily has the president of the United States fallen into the lap of the leftists, of the bureaucrats, of the State Department, of the swamp. \u201d Moroever, Levin said, despite Trump\u2019s \u201cvigorous and unequivocal\u201d campaign pledge to move the U. S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, he now appears to be \u201cbetraying that promise. \u201d \u201cWhy did the president say he would move our embassy to Jerusalem when he didn\u2019t mean it?\u201d he asked. Levin referred to Tillerson\u2019s remarks to NBC\u2019s Meet the Press  \u2014   an interview the radio host said was \u201can abomination\u201d  \u2014   in which the secretary of state said the impact of an embassy move on a future peace deal was being considered and the president \u201cwas listening to input from all interested parties. \u201d \u201cWhat is the president\u2019s obsession now with a peace negotiation? Where did this come from? In many respects a two state solution for Israel is a final solution for Israel,\u201d Levin said. Later on the show, Levin lambasted Tillerson for using the phrase \u201cIsrael and Palestine\u201d when the latter does not yet exist, saying Tillerson \u201chas just given the Palestinians, effectively, a country. \u201d \u201cI am stunned. I am shocked at how quickly the president of the United States reversed course and appears to have sold out. \u201cI hope I\u2019m wrong. I hope I\u2019m wrong. Nothing effectively has been done yet, but this is really quite shocking to me. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563770.8035414}
