Trump, has been suspended by NBC. The NBC executive in charge of \u201cToday,\u201d Noah Oppenheim, wrote in a memo to his staff members on Sunday that \u201cwe\u2019ve all been deeply troubled by the revelations of the past 48 hours. \u201d \u201cLet me be clear  \u2014   there is simply no excuse for Billy\u2019s language and behavior on that tape,\u201d he said. \u201cNBC has decided to suspend Billy, pending further review of this matter. \u201d It is unclear how long the suspension will last. Mr. Bush was at the center of an explosive 2005 video that was released on Friday, in which he is heard laughing and goading Mr. Trump as they engaged in a vulgar and misogynistic conversation about women. The news of the suspension is a reversal for NBC News, whose executives maintained throughout the weekend that it had no plans to discipline Mr. Bush and that he was expected to address the controversy on Monday\u2019s program. But in the two days since the video\u2019s release, there has been a strong social media backlash, including hundreds of angry comments on his Facebook page, many of them from women. Mr. Bush released a statement on Friday saying that he was \u201cembarrassed and ashamed\u201d of his role in the recording. But he added, \u201cThis happened 11 years ago  \u2014   I was younger, less mature and acted foolishly in playing along. \u201d \u201cToday\u201d is gripped in a ratings battle with ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d and both shows rely on women as a significant part of their viewership. At the time the video was shot, Mr. Bush was a host of NBC\u2019s \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d and talking with Mr. Trump, then the star of \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d as he was about to leave a bus to visit a soap opera set. In the video, Mr. Bush laughs at Mr. Trump\u2019s most outrageous comments, and the two vividly discuss the physique of a \u201cDays of Our Lives\u201d actress, Arianne Zucker, who arrived to accompany Mr. Trump on set (\u201cOh, that\u2019s good legs,\u201d Mr. Bush said at one point). In a statement on Sunday, Ms. Zucker said: \u201cHow we treat one another, whether behind closed doors, locker rooms or face to face, should be done with kindness, dignity and respect. Unfortunately, there are too many people in power who abuse their position and disregard these simple principles and are rewarded for it. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563201.9919562}
