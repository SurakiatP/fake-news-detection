However, the protesters are using very dangerous means to slow us down. Their aggressive tactics include using horses, fire and trying to flank us with horses and people.\u201d \\nWitnesses on the scene, backed by patchy live stream and recorded video , paint a sharply contrasting picture of the incident.

We call on the state of North Dakota to oversee the actions of local law enforcement to, first and foremost, ensure everyone\u2019s safety. The Department of Justice must send overseers immediately to ensure the protection of First Amendment rights and the safety of thousands here at Standing Rock. DOJ can no longer ignore our requests. If harm comes to any who come here to stand in solidarity with us, it is on their watch. They must step in and hold the state of North Dakota and Morton County accountable for their acts of violence against innocent, prayerful people.\u201d VIdeo of police shooting into crowd of water protectors cc: @UNPeacekeeping #NoDAPL https://t.co/7ggsEZ6bUY pic.twitter.com/O5mRsptxZq \\n\u2014 Occupy Wall Street (@OccupyWallStNYC) October 27, 2016 \\nIndeed, for weeks, many witnesses have recounted the same violent tactics against those engaged in prayer, as Danny Grassrope told ABC News on Saturday, \u201cThis weekend we went to go demonstrate with peaceful action. We went to go pray. Then while we were praying, the cops came and told us we couldn\u2019t be there. We were just standing there and then this police officer came and opened up with some pepper spray. We weren\u2019t antagonizing them or anything, we were just praying.\u201d \\nSo absurdly overzealous was the police response to the unarmed crowd on Thursday, even proponents of the pipeline took to social media to voice deep concerns about the needless escalation. \\nSuch incidents are only likely to continue, as water protectors have vowed to peacefully resist until ETP completely abandons plans to construct the Dakota Access Pipeline \u2014 which, incidentally, won\u2019t even benefit Americans in any way as the crude it transports will be shipped overseas to line the pockets of investors in the project. \\nThat resistance and protection of the water supply of millions could come at a steep price in the very near future \u2014 an unusually bitter winter looms on the horizon. \\nNorth Dakota winters are notorious for biting winds, heavy snowfall, and generally brutal conditions \u2014 but the forecast for this winter predicts lower than average temperatures. By the end of November, daytime highs will hover around the low 30s Fahrenheit, and will continue to slip downward through the month of December into the 20s and even teens. \\nJanuary highs for the Bismarck area average just 24 degrees in a given year \u2014 but January 2017, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, will be much colder, with many days not even close to breaking 20 degrees, and lows in the negative digits. And that bleak picture doesn\u2019t account for wind chill \u2014 roughly, the temperature and wind speed combination which affects the rate of the body\u2019s heat loss when exposed to the elements \u2014 and North Dakota\u2019s winter winds are higher than the national average. \\nBecause the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and their supporters view protection of water \u2014 which they consider a living entity \u2014 as an unequivocal duty, encampments in various locations include particularly vulnerable populations, including elders, women, and children. \\nIn no uncertain terms, this is a dangerous set of circumstances. \\nThese encampments have been preparing to deal with frigid conditions, but are in desperate need of support from those empathetic to their cause. After all, this is not a protest by any stretch of the imagination, despite mainstream media\u2019s narrative. This movement, this resistance \u2014 unprecedented in size and scope in over a century \u2014 concerns every person reliant on not only the Missouri River, but every water source in the country. \\nSo, if you have wanted to support the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in protecting the water but are unable to travel to the camps in person, there are still a number of ways you can help \u2014 and it is sorely needed. Remember, Native American reservation populations are among the most impoverished in the nation, thanks to centuries of exploitation and unkept government promises \u2014 simply going to a big box store and purchasing necessary supplies isn\u2019t an option. \\nBut many of us can spare a little to help support those on the front lines who are protecting all of us from poisoned water. \\nPerhaps the easiest way to donate is through the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe\u2019s PayPal fund, which will be allotted for \u201clegal, sanitary, and emergency purposes,\u201d and can be found here , or through the Tribe\u2019s GoFundMe page, here . \\nIf you would prefer to write a check, make it payable to \u201cStanding Rock Sioux Tribe\u201d and send it to: Standing Rock Sioux Tribe'"}, "time": 1742628419.3889382}
