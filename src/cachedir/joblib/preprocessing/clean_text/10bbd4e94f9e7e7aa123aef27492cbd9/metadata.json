Henry (William Sydney Porter) coined the term. It refers to a politically unstable and/or repressive country where a small percent of the population enjoys a disproportionate share of wealth and power. It\u2019s where ordinary people are exploited, persecuted, imprisoned, murdered or disappeared for daring to challenge ruthlessly corrupt power responsibly, where profits are privatized while ordinary people bear the burden of high unemployment, impoverishment and loss of fundamental freedoms. It\u2019s a kleptocracy run by criminals, complicit with corporate thieves, bribing them to get their way \u2013 corrupt, rotten to the core gangsterism, run for personal gain, profiting at the public\u2019s expense. Bill and Hillary Clinton, America\u2019s most notorious crime family, a Machiavellian duo, are heading back to Washington in January for their third co-presidential term, things rigged to assure it. Their excessive corruption rivals how mafia bosses and drug lords amass wealth \u2013 the old-fashioned way by stealing it, selling influence, and other disreputable means. Corruption is endemic virtually everywhere, likely nowhere more excessively than in America, given the nation\u2019s enormous public and private wealth, its distribution as disproportionate as in third world countries, special interests grabbing all they can at the expense of most others. Inside the bubble is paradise \u2013 outside dystopian hell. America resembles Guatemala, thirdworldized for its privileged few, bipartisan gangsters profiting at the expense of the public they\u2019re sworn to serve. Never with Hillary and Bill in charge, addicted to endless wars, predatory capitalism and self-enrichment. WikiLeaks exposed volumes on how they operate. Even the militantly anti-Trump, pro-Hillary Washington Post took note \u2013 on October 26 headlining \u201cInside \u2018Bill Clinton Inc.:\u2019 Hacked memo reveals intersection of charity and personal income.\u201d Written by top Bill Clinton aide Douglas Band, it explained \u201ca circle of enrichment,\u201d involving blurred lines between the Clinton Foundation and \u201ctop-tier\u201d corporate clients of his for-profit Teneo Consulting firm. It provided a detailed look at how the Clintons and their top aides operate. It\u2019s not pretty. According to WaPo: \u201cBand\u2019s memo provided data showing how much money each of Teneo\u2019s 20 clients\u2026had given to the Clinton Foundation, how much they had paid Bill Clinton\u2026\u201d \u201cBand wrote that Teneo partners had raised in excess of $8 million for the foundation and $3 million in paid speaking fees for Bill Clinton.\u201d \u201cHe said he had secured contracts for the former president that would pay out $66 million over the subsequent nine years if the deals remained in place.\u201d One observer called the Band memo \u201cthe Rosetta stone of the Teneo-Clinton Foundation complex\u201d \u2013 a revenue generating arm for large Foundation donations, along with highly-paid Bill and Hillary speeches, he after leaving the White House, she in 2013 and 2014 after leaving State, before announcing her presidential candidacy. What\u2019s coming under their leadership should shock and terrify everyone \u2013 policies polar opposite ones Hillary promised on the stump. They\u2019ll be broken straightaway once in power, the way GW Bush, Obama and the first Clinton co-presidency betrayed loyal supporters \u2013 this time more ruthlessly dangerous than ever.
