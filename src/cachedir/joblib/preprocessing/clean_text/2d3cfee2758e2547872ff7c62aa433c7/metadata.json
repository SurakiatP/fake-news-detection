Here\u2019s a brief rundown of what the court decided and what it means: What was the case? Fisher v. University of Texas, No.   was brought by Abigail Fisher, a white woman who claimed that she had been denied admission to the University of Texas, Austin, because of her race. Under a provision known as the Top 10 Percent program (the actual percentage can vary in practice) high school students from Texas who finish near the top of their class are guaranteed admission to the state\u2019s public universities. The universities evaluate the remaining students using a number of criteria, including race and ethnicity. This practice is similar to processes at colleges and universities throughout the country. What did the court rule? The court rejected the challenge,   handing a major victory to supporters of affirmative action. In a lengthy dissent from the bench, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. criticized his colleagues and defined the university\u2019s practices as \u201caffirmative action gone berserk. \u201d Justice Elena Kagan did not vote in the case after recusing herself because of her previous work on the case. What does the ruling mean? The decision means that the university can still consider factors like race and ethnicity when evaluating other prospective students. What was the case? The case concerned President Obama\u2019s attempt to shield unauthorized immigrants who are parents of citizens or lawful permanent residents from deportation while providing them with work permits. When Mr. Obama introduced the plan in 2014, he virtually dared the   Congress to fight him on the issue, defending the series of executive actions as being within his authority. \u201cThe actions I\u2019m taking are not only lawful they\u2019re the kinds of actions taken by every single Republican president and every Democratic president for the past \u201d he said. A coalition of 26 states, led by Texas, disagreed and challenged the plan, arguing that it ignored procedures for rule changes and abused the power of the president\u2019s office. A federal judge shut down the program pending its legal case in early 2015, an action that was later upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans. What did the Supreme Court decide? The court deadlocked,   in the case: United States v. Texas, No.  . The stalemate was made possible by the empty seat left by Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February. What does the stalemate mean? The deadlock was a sharp blow to Mr. Obama\u2019s ambitious plan, which he had hoped would become one of his lasting legacies. It also amplified the     debate over immigration policy and presidential authority. There are three cases remaining to be decided by the court this month. \u2022 Perhaps the most keenly anticipated is a major abortion case that could affect millions of American women. The case, Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt, challenges a Texas law that imposes severe restrictions on abortion clinics  \u2014   requiring, for example, that doctors have admitting privileges at hospitals nearby  \u2014   ostensibly to protect women\u2019s health. Critics have argued that the law would force most of the state\u2019s clinics to close. As they heard arguments in March, the justices appeared to be sharply divided over the case, as The Times\u2019s Adam Liptak reported. \u2022 Also pending is a decision in the case of Bob McDonnell, the former governor of Virginia, who challenged his conviction on public corruption. In that case, McDonnell v. United States, the justices seem prepared to side with Mr. McDonnell, who has argued that prosecutors went too far in interpreting routine political favors as corruption, Mr. Liptak reported. Mr. McDonnell faces two years in prison. \u2022 The third decision to come centers on a case involving domestic violence. President Obama said in a news conference Thursday that the court\u2019s action on immigration further set back the United States from being the kind of country that \u201cwe aspire to be. \u201d Mr. Obama said the deadlock was \u201cfrustrating\u201d to those who sought to grow the economy and bring rationality to the immigration system, as well as to those who wished to \u201ccome out of the shadows\u201d and lift this \u201cperpetual cloud on them. \u201d He called the justices\u2019 inability to come to a decision a \u201cvery clear reminder\u201d of why it was so important for the Supreme Court to have a full bench, emphasizing the importance of lawmakers\u2019 acting on his nominee for the open spot, Merrick B. Garland. Mr. Obama said existing immigration programs would continue, adding, \u201cI promise you this: Sooner or later, immigration reform will get done. \u201d Mr. Obama also asked whether Americans would continue to tolerate the \u201chypocrisy\u201d of having people \u201cmake our beds\u201d or \u201cpick our fruit\u201d without allowing them to have a chance to \u201cget right with the law,\u201d or whether the country would take actions that would divide families. These are questions that voters would have to weigh for the election in November, he added. He said that Congress must now pass a law, and that he hoped there would be a \u201cvigorous debate\u201d in the coming election. Hillary Clinton shared her reaction on Twitter: So did Donald J. Trump: And politicians like the speaker of the House, Paul D. Ryan, and Senator Harry Reid: Others on social media weighed in:'"}, "time": 1742563429.1830134}
