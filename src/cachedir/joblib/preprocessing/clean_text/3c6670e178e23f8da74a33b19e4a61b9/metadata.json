[The arrests of Dr. Nagarwala and two others last week represent the first federal female genital mutilation (FGM) investigation in United States history. FGM is common in the Islamic world, particularly in Africa. According to UNICEF, 98 percent of Somali girls and 87 percent of Egyptians have endured the procedure. FGM involves removing varying amounts of the victim\u2019s  \u2014   usually a   girl  \u2014   clitoris, labia majoria, and labia minora. In its most extreme form, the victim is \u201cinfibulated,\u201d having virtually all her external genitalia removed and being sewn up, leaving her with only a tiny hole from which to urinate and menstruate.  Nagarwala\u2019s attorney, Shannon Smith, claimed in her initial court hearing that no cutting of the    alleged victims took place and that excess skin was simply scraped off to be buried in a religious ceremony. The Free Press, however, reports that documents they reviewed show the injuries to the two Minnesota girls\u2019 genitals were \u201cmuch more severe\u201d than Nagarwala is claiming. Previously unheard of in the United States, the criminal complaints against the three suspects in this   conspiracy to commit FGM  \u2014   Nagarwala, Dr. Fakhruddin Attar, and his wife, Farida Attar  \u2014   describe them as members of a \u201cparticular religious and cultural community. \u201d That community has since been revealed as the Dawoodi Bohra Muslim sect, a branch of Shi\u2019ite Islam popular in India, Pakistan, and East Africa. The worldwide leader of that sect, Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin, has repeatedly called for the tradition of FGM to continue, describing it, according to a State Department report, as an \u201cact of religious purity\u201d and \u201ca religious obligation for all women and girls. \u201d According to the complaints, the alleged victims in this case were brought by their parents, in what was described to them as a \u201cspecial girls trip,\u201d all the way from Minnesota to Dr. Attar\u2019s Burhani Medical Center in Livonia, Michigan. The girls, who are not related, were allegedly told the cutting was needed to \u201cget the germs out\u201d and that they were not to tell anyone about what happened to them. One of the victims told the FBI she screamed in pain as Dr. Nargawala operated between her legs and that she was barely able to walk as she left the clinic. According to the complaint, doctors working with the FBI found that both   \u2019 genitals were \u201cabnormal looking\u201d with \u201cscar tissue\u201d and \u201csmall healing lacerations. \u201d Authorities believe many more than these two girls have been mutilated by this suburban Detroit FGM operation. Evidence suggests girls have been brought to Michigan from around the Midwest to undergo the gruesome operation since at least 2005. According to the complaint, several Michigan girls have complained to authorities that they were mutilated by Dr. Nargawala in Dr. Attar\u2019s clinic. Authorities believe Nargawala came to the Burhani clinic on weekends to perform FGM separately from her weekday job as an emergency room doctor at Detriot\u2019s Henry Ford Hospital. In her interview with the FBI, Farida Attar, the clinic owner\u2019s wife, claimed Nargawala came to their clinic to see six to nine girls a year. The defendants will face up to five years in federal prison for each count of FGM in this first case, in a wider push to eradicate the barbaric Islamic practice from America.'"}, "time": 1742563809.5842514}
