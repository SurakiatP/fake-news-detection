Al Green ( ) speaking on the House floor Wednesday morning, said President Trump \u201cmust be impeached. \u201d[\u201cIt\u2019s a position of conscience for me,\u201d Green said. \u201cThis is about what I believe. And this is where I stand. I will not be moved. The president must be impeached\u201d:  Rep. Al Green calls for Trump\u2019s impeachment: \u2019No one is above the law and that includes the president\u2019 pic. twitter.   \u2014   Philip Lewis (@Phil_Lewis_) May 17, 2017,  Green joined other Democratic lawmakers to call for the president\u2019s impeachment, although Democratic leadership in Congress said it was too soon to move ahead with such action, Fox News reported. \u201cI rise today, Mr. Speaker, to call for the impeachment of the President of the United States of America for obstruction of justice,\u201d Green said, suggesting that Trump\u2019s firing of former FBI Director James Comey obstructed an investigation into his campaign\u2019s alleged ties to Russia. \u201cWe cannot allow this to go unchecked \u2014  the president is not above the law, it is time for the American people to weigh in. \u201d Green was the first of his Democratic colleagues in the House to call for Trump\u2019s impeachment, inspired by a New York Times report claiming that Trump asked Comey to end an investigation into the former National Security adviser, Michael Flynn. The Hill reported that Green started calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment on Monday, when he said his colleagues in Congress should take up the mantra \u201cITN: Impeach Trump Now. \u201d Green originally said that he would wait a few weeks before starting impeachment proceedings, KHOU reported. Many Democrats and Republicans in Congress, however, are not ready to jump on the impeachment bandwagon just yet. \u201cMembers are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the president such as accusations that he committed an impeachable offense,\u201d Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick ( ) told lawmakers after the speech. Ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff ( ) said Wednesday that impeachment is not something that should be rushed. \u201cNo one should rush to embrace the most extraordinary remedy for removing a president,\u201d  Schiff said.'"}, "time": 1742562506.2380233}
