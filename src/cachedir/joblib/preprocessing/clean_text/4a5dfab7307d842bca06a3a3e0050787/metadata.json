He was clutching a device that he contends could change the monotony of bathroom routines forever. \u201cThere has been zero innovation in this market for over 60 years,\u201d said Mr. Dyson, 68, a billionaire who was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2006. \u201cMillions of people use contraptions daily that are hideously inefficient, waste their time and are causing them   damage,\u201d he said. \u201cWe realized that we could  \u2014   and should  \u2014   sort this situation out. \u201d He triumphantly held up what appeared to be a sleek black and pink plastic doughnut on a stick. \u201cFour years, 100 odd patents and 600 prototypes later, I think we might have found the answer. \u201d Known as the Dyson Supersonic and unveiled in Tokyo on Wednesday, the device is his response to a question many never thought to ask: Is it possible to make a better hair dryer? This may not seem like a big deal. A few burned scalps and frizz issues aside, people have been doing just fine with the standard hair dryer for decades. But, as Dai Fujiwara, a Japanese fashion designer who collaborated with Mr. Dyson on an Issey Miyake runway presentation, wrote in an email, \u201cBecause everyday life is too common, people rarely realize there is a problem. \u201d About 92 percent of British women regularly use a hair dryer (according to the consultancy Mintel) while 75. 5 percent of all women and 24. 5 percent of men in the United States and 97 percent of women and 30 percent of men in Japan use one (according to Dyson) and most spend an average of 20 minutes on each session. So changing even a small percentage of that behavior could have outsize repercussions. Mr. Dyson, Britain\u2019s   living inventor, is the Steve Jobs of domestic appliances. He has built a fortune from making otherwise standard products seem aesthetically desirable, in the process persuading untold numbers of consumers that they really, really want cordless and bagless vacuum cleaners, air purifiers, bladeless fans and even household robots. \u201cHis inventions are disruptive  \u2014   beautifully so,\u201d said Terence Conran, the British restaurateur, retailer and furniture designer. \u201cWho would have imagined that a bagless vacuum cleaner could become a highly covetable status symbol? He has made other businesses think differently about how to use design, creativity and innovation. \u201d Mr. Dyson studied furniture design and architecture at the Royal College of Art in London. He is currently provost there. \u201cHis advocacy for the discipline and for British manufacturing has had a profound influence on the British national psyche,\u201d said Dr. Paul Thompson, rector of the Royal College. Now Mr. Dyson is trying to extend that influence into hitherto unchartered territory: the global beauty and grooming sector. Dyson said there were 103 engineers involved in the creation of the Supersonic, which included the taming of over 1, 010 miles of human hair tresses and 7, 000 acoustic tests as teams tackled three core issues: noise, weight and speed. Ground zero for the project was the Dyson research facility, a Willy   world deep in the rolling Wiltshire hills, with a Harrier fighter jet and spliced Mini car in the visitors\u2019 parking lot. Projects are kept firmly under lock and key from virtually all outsiders  \u2014   as well as many within the walls itself (which, like those owned by Roald Dahl\u2019s flamboyant fictional chocolate factory owner, are often painted a lurid purple). Matt Kelly was one of many young engineers milling around the plant in near identikit uniforms of hoodies, jeans and sneakers or battered brogues. \u201cYou can sit next to someone in the cafeteria here for years and not have the first idea what they are working on, and they will have no clue what you do, either,\u201d Mr. Kelly said. \u201cDiscretion and an ability to keep secrets are essential traits if you want to work at Dyson. \u201d Especially when doing something so counterintuitive as moving from the practical question of what to use to clean carpets to the more   question of what to use to style a personal image. Ed Shelton, a design manager for the Supersonic, said: \u201cIt was the hardest project I\u2019ve ever worked on. Beyond having to crack the science of hair, we\u2019ve had to tackle a highly subjective user psychology. \u201cTrust me when I say there are many more approaches and angles to   than vacuuming in the world. British women want volume. Japanese women want straightness. No one wants hair damage. And then we had to create a fleet of robots specifically to test that over and over again. \u201d The company says the key to the Supersonic is its     motor. About the size of a quarter, the motor is small enough to fit in the base of the hair dryer handle, rather than in the conventional motor position at the top of the device, a shift that creates its unorthodox streamlined aesthetic. The smaller motor allows for high velocity flow but not pressure, the company says, which is how temperatures shoot up on traditional hair dryers and users burn themselves if the dryer is too close to the head. The company says the positioning of the motor in the hand also limits the   dumbbell effect of   models, where   weighting can cause arms to ache. Weighing just 370 grams, the new structure allows for a longer silencer tube and smaller fan, cutting down drastically on noise. Coupled with the high motor speed, the fusion of new technologies gives rise to Dyson claims that the sound waves can operate at an ultrasonic level  \u2014   in other words, at frequencies higher than the upper audible limit for humans. It also has magnetic heatproof nozzles and intelligent heat sensors to prevent hair burn. \u201cFrankly, I\u2019m rather terrified,\u201d Mr. Dyson said. \u201cWe had to learn a great deal with the Supersonic, and there have been a lot of firsts on all fronts, including the fact that I had to grow my hair especially for a launch. \u201d \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been this long since my \u201960s student days, when I wore flowered shirts and flares,\u201d Mr. Dyson said. Despite his newly flowing locks, both Dyson the man and Dyson the company are conscious that they may not come across as the most convincing of beauty gurus. Consequently, the company has enlisted the services of Jen Atkin, a celebrity hairstylist with a client Rolodex that includes Kim Kardashian, Jessica Alba and Katy Perry and a social media following of millions. Her job is to decode the appliance and its styling power to viewers via online tutorials following the introduction (i. e. she\u2019s a brand ambassador) but her input was also instrumental in its creation. Jake Dyson, the oldest son of Mr. Dyson and heir apparent to the Dyson helm, said the company understood that personal care \u201cwas a radically different market from the ones we are used to competing in. Cleaning floors is much less glamorous than styling hair. \u201d Ms. Atkin, who can see up to 30 clients a day, said she had initially begun the relationship by \u201cgiving her two cents\u201d to Dyson engineers on the model and what it needed. \u201cThat   feeling that usually makes your arms ache completely disappears with this, whether working on your own hair or blow drying someone else,\u201d she said. \u201cFor me, or any woman, that is a game changer. This is the \u2018break the Internet\u2019 dryer. \u201d As with any other Dyson device, research and development didn\u2019t come cheap: The investment, including a     hair laboratory, reached \u00a350 million (about $72 million). As a result, the Supersonic will retail at $399 when it arrives in the United States at Sephora stores in September, a price at stark odds with the     business model that has traditionally defined the competitive hair dryer market. Currently, hair dryers sold by Amazon in the United States retail for $12. 99 to $219. 98. Still, Dyson has a convincing track record in persuading fans to pay hundreds of dollars on domestic status symbols that spend most of their working lives in the cupboard under the stairs or next to the dog basket. But there have been expensive failures along the way, like its washing machine, which the company no longer makes. More recently, some of Dyson\u2019s boldest claims, about advancing science in certain markets, have also been called into question by critics like the University of Westminster in London. This month the university released research suggesting that Dyson Airblade hand dryers spread 60 times more germs than standard air dryers, and 1, 300 times more than standard paper towels, although the assertion is one that the company emphatically and repeatedly rejects. So the hair dryer stakes are high and the market deeply fragmented, not least by the popularity of newer   electrical appliances like straightening irons and curling tongs. Can Dyson really pull off another product revolution? \u201cThis all does feel a lot more personal than usual,\u201d Mr. Dyson said. \u201cWhich I suppose makes me a little nervous. But actually, I have found everything we are learning with the Supersonic very exciting. It\u2019s the start of a new push into this sector for us. Though I can\u2019t tell you more than that. \u201d What he can say is that the company is set to spend \u00a31. 5 billion (about $2. 2 billion) investing in future technology and recently announced the development of four new portfolio sectors. While bullish, he also knows that not all his   inventions could be winners. \u201cI actually believe that success teaches you nothing failures teach you everything,\u201d he said, surrounded by sketches and prototypes in his meticulously cluttered office. One hundred new products are in the pipeline in the next four years around the world, he said. The hair dryer is just the beginning. \u201cFor decades, people have just accepted a subpar experience because no one was offering them anything else,\u201d said Stephen Courtney, concepts director at Dyson and a leader on the hair project. The company wants to change that, one locker room, spa and beauty salon at a time.'"}, "time": 1742563536.2121203}
