Host Ryan Smith asked Manfred if the MLB would consider moving its   game if the Indians chose not to get rid of the logo, much like other sports have done in response to North Carolina\u2019s bathroom bill. While Manfred stated he does not want to deal with hypothetical questions, he did say the league is discussing the logo. \u201cI think it\u2019s important for the commissioner\u2019s office to engage with the owner in terms of addressing the offense that some people take with respect to that logo,\u201d Manfred told Smith. \u201cWe\u2019ve begun those conversations, and I think you will see that over the relatively short term that we\u2019ll be responsive to those concerns. \u201d Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent'"}, "time": 1742562084.7094634}
