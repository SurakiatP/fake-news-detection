Bruce Springsteen\u2019s song lyrics have injected more drama and mystery into the myths of the American road than any figure since Jack Kerouac. He knows this, of course. So it\u2019s one of the running jokes in his big, loose, rangy and intensely satisfying new memoir, \u201cBorn to Run\u201d (what else was he going to call it?) that he didn\u2019t begin to drive until he was well into his 20s  \u2014   around the time he landed simultaneously on the covers of Time and Newsweek. His brooding and violent father had been too impatient to teach him and, anyway, he couldn\u2019t afford a car. When Mr. Springsteen was forced to sneak behind the wheel, licenseless, to handle some of the driving on his earliest tours, his ineptitude terrified his band members. He did not exactly, when young and virile, ride through mansions of glory on suicide machines. He mostly stuck out his thumb. He\u2019d been born to hitch. \u201cEvery sort of rube, redneck, responsible citizen and   the Jersey Shore had to offer, I rode with \u2019em,\u201d he writes in \u201cBorn to Run. \u201d These rides matter because Mr. Springsteen\u2019s songs, like the   poems of Philip Levine, are intensely peopled. Wild Billy and Crazy Janey, Johnny 99, Mary from \u201cThunder Road,\u201d Wayne from \u201cDarlington County,\u201d Jimmy the Saint and Bobby Jean had to come from somewhere. This memoir suggests Mr. Springsteen met many of them while cackling over there in the shotgun seat. The headline news in \u201cBorn to Run,\u201d to judge by the early news media tweets, is that Mr. Springsteen, who turns 67 on Friday, has suffered periodically from serious depression. I will admit that this information shook me. If Bruce Springsteen has to resort to Klonopin, what hope is there for anyone? But these sections are not the reason to come to \u201cBorn to Run. \u201d The book is like one of Mr. Springsteen\u2019s shows  \u2014   long, ecstatic, exhausting, filled with peaks and valleys. It\u2019s part s\u00e9ance and part keg party, and then the house lights come up and you realize that, A) you look ridiculous dancing to \u201cTwist and Shout\u201d and, B) you will be driving home in a minivan and not a Camaro. His writing voice is much like his speaking voice there\u2019s a big, raspy laugh on at least every other page. There\u2019s some raunch here. This book has not been utterly sanitized for anyone\u2019s protection, and many of the best lines won\u2019t be printed in this newspaper. Most important, \u201cBorn to Run\u201d is, like his finest songs, closely observed from end to end. His story is intimate and personal, but he has an interest in other people and a gift for sizing them up. Here\u2019s just one example, chosen nearly at random. When Mr. Springsteen meets a future girlfriend on the boardwalk in Asbury Park, N. J. (one of innumerable girlfriends on display here) he delivers this electric introduction: \u201cShe was Italian, funny, a beatific tomboy, with just the hint of a lazy eye, and wore a pair of glasses that made me think of the wonders of the library. \u201d Well, hello, you think. Much of the writing in \u201cBorn to Run\u201d is this fresh  \u2014   the sound of a writer who could have phoned his book in but did not. There are dollops of pretension and   in \u201cBorn to Run. \u201d Springsteen wouldn\u2019t be Springsteen without homilies, a few of them leaden, about fathers and sons and love and work and community. But this book mostly gets away clean, leaving behind the scent of lightly scorched rubber. Mr. Springsteen\u2019s father was a frequently unemployed bus driver, among other   jobs his mother a legal secretary. They were fairly poor. In their houses  \u2014     more often  \u2014   there was generally no telephone and little heat. Meals were cooked on a coal stove. \u201cBorn to Run\u201d is potent on the subject of social class. In Mr. Springsteen\u2019s part of New Jersey it was the \u201c \u201d (preppies) versus the greasers, and there was no doubt which side of that line he was on. At some of his early shows, guys in chinos spat on him. \u201cI could still feel the shadow of that spit that hit me long ago when I moved to Rumson in 1983, 16 years later,\u201d he writes. He\u2019d found fame and bought a decent place. Yet: \u201cAt 33 years old, I still had to take a big gulp of air before walking through the door of my new home. \u201d He suggests there\u2019s a freight of psychic payback in \u201cDarkness on the Edge of Town,\u201d his most fully realized album. \u201cFor my parents\u2019 troubled lives I was determined to be the enlightened, compassionate voice of reason and revenge. \u201d Mr. Springsteen got his first guitar, a rental, after seeing Elvis on \u201cThe Ed Sullivan Show. \u201d He had a serious work ethic, and went on to play in a string of   bands with names like Child and Earth and Steel Mill. When his   first record, \u201cGreetings From Asbury Park, N. J.,\u201d appeared in 1973, he was lumped with the   New Dylans, folk singers like Loudon Wainwright III and John Prine. But there was a crucial difference. Unlike those performers, Mr. Springsteen onstage, thanks to his long   apprenticeship, could blow audiences backward. Mr. Springsteen writes that he\u2019s never thought much of his singing voice. As good a guitar player as he is, others were better. It was his songs, he realized early, that would have to put him over the top. If this book has one curious blind spot, it\u2019s that we never quite understand how those words came into being. He studied the songwriting of people like Mr. Dylan, Donovan and Tim Buckley, he writes. But so did many others. If his early reading was an influence, he doesn\u2019t say. The words were apparently just there, available, on tap. And they stayed there, even when his lyrics became pared down. Songs like \u201cThe River\u201d and \u201cStolen Car\u201d are as evocative in their details as are Raymond Carver\u2019s best short stories. \u201cBorn to Run\u201d takes us, album by album, through his career. These chapters sometimes feel clipped and compressed, as if he\u2019s wedged the data in his heart onto a thumb drive. The book takes us through his many stabs at romance, which tended to end badly. (He once gave his father the crabs after they\u2019d shared a toilet seat.) He details the failure of his first marriage, to the actress Julianne Phillips, and the success of his second, to Patti Scialfa, whom he describes, in a childhood photo, as \u201ca   Raggedy Ann of a little girl. \u201d He raised his three children without   mementos in the house. \u201cMy kids didn\u2019t know \u2018Badlands\u2019 from matzo ball soup,\u201d he writes. \u201cWhen I was approached on the street for autographs, I\u2019d explain to them that in my job I was Barney (the   purple dinosaur) for adults. \u201d His eldest son says, in shock, \u201cDad, that guy has you tattooed on his arm. \u201d Mr. Springsteen\u2019s work ethic has never abandoned him, or he it. \u201cI\u2019m glad I\u2019ve been handsomely paid for my efforts,\u201d he writes, \u201cbut I truly would have done it for free. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628360.1938374}
