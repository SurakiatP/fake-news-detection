Marco Rubio ( ) questioned the \u201chumanitarian rationale\u201d behinds those memos.  Rubio said, \u201cWe need to acknowledge that there is no right to illegally immigrate to the United States. Then there is the human side, and that is, okay, there is no legal right but is there not a humanitarian rationale for perhaps allowing some of the people here legally to remain because they have been here a long time because they are good people because they were brought here as children. \u201d He continued, \u201cThe answer is I think quite frankly they\u2019ll have a lot of questions about whether it\u2019s the best use of our resources. \u201d Rubio added, \u201cI think the implementation of it is much more intense from what I\u2019m hearing. Stories I\u2019m hearing of how it\u2019s actually being implemented. For example, individuals who have never had a run in with the law somehow take a stop sign they get pulled over, they could get turned in, and they can\u2019t prove they been here for two years, and they are deported out of the country. I think if that\u2019s the way it\u2019s applied you are going to have to spend a lot of money to do it number one and you are going to have to deal with the humanitarian reality that over time the America people are going to say maybe this is not what we meant. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742563394.0615244}
