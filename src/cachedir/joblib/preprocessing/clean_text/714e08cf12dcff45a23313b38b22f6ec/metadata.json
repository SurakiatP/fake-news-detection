Creepy Uncle Joe got so upset when asked if he would like to debate Trump that he said that he wished he could go back to high school because he \u201ccould take him behind the gym.\u201d \\nSide note: don\u2019t go anywhere alone with creepy Uncle Joe, no matter how much candy he offers you. \\nIt seems like Biden\u2019s comments were a skosh defensive, probably because unlike Trump, who just talked about being able to grope women who would be willing because of his star status, Biden is actually on camera groping women and children. \\nBut what does the media do? \u201cOh that\u2019s just Uncle Joe, he\u2019s harmless. Wait, just don\u2019t sit on his lap, okay? Or get in his van. Isn\u2019t he charming?\u201d \\nTrump wasn\u2019t too concerned about creepy Joe and his empty threats. At a rally in Florida on Tuesday, Trump responded to gropey Biden\u2019s blowhard comments, courtesy of the U.K. Daily Mail: \\n\u201cDid you see where Biden wants to \u2018take me to the back of the barn.\u2019 Me! He wants to \u2013 I\u2019d love that. I\u2019d love that. Mr. Tough Guy! You know, he\u2019s Mr. Tough Guy,\u2019 Trump boasted.\u201d \\n\u201cYou know when he\u2019s Mr. Tough Guy? When he\u2019s standing behind a microphone by himself. That\u2019s when he\u2019s Mr. \u2013 \\n\u201cHe wants to bring me to the back of the barn. Ohhhh. Some things in life you could really love doing! \\n\u201cAnd by the way,\u2019 Trump vented, \u201cif I\u2019d said that? They\u2019d say, \u2018He\u2019s violent! How could he have done that? How could he have?'\u201d \\nYeah, I\u2019m going to go out on a limb here and say that Trump isn\u2019t too concerned about Biden, a man who gropes women \u2014 including elderly women \u2014 and little girls on camera and probably does so because even the elderly women and little girls could take him if they weren\u2019t caught off guard by the lecherous vice president molesting them in public with cameras all around. \\nMaybe Biden should learn to keep his hands, feet and other objects to himself before he worries about Trump\u2019s comments on tape 11 years ago about what consenting, adult women would hypothetically allow him to do.\""}, "time": 1742561838.0997167}
