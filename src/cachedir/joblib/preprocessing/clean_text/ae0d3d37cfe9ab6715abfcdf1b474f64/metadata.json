Terry McAuliffe (D) quietly vetoed legislation that would have granted women immediate approval to carry guns for   against domestic abusers. [The bill, HB 1852, would make exceptions in the issuance of concealed carry permits, \u201c[providing] that for a period of 45 days after the issuance of a protective order the individual seeking the protective order may lawfully carry a concealed weapon. \u201d  McAuliffe vetoed the legislation on March 24, claiming HB 1852 weakens the \u201cCommonwealth\u2019s gun safety laws\u201d and \u201cperpetuates the dangerous fiction that the victims of domestic violence will be safer by arming themselves. \u201d Breitbart News reported the story of Carol Bowne, a New Jersey woman who had gotten a protective order against her   and applied for state\u2019s permission to have a gun for  . The   process of getting permission to have a gun was still playing out when a defenseless Bowne was stabbed to death by her   on June 3, 2015. Fast forward to the state of Kentucky in May 2016, where a man violated a protective order, went to his  \u2019s house, and was later discovered lying in the grass with multiple gunshot wounds. His former girlfriend was armed and handled his breach of the protective order accordingly. McAuliffe\u2019s veto makes tragic stories like Bowne\u2019s more likely and   stories like the one in Kentucky less probable.
