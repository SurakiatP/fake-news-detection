She says that, in 1994, she was offered modeling work and money in exchange for her attendance to a series of parties. These parties were to be held at the home of Jeffrey Epstein, who is now a convicted, registered sex offender. Epstein served thirteen months of an eighteen month sentence for running a prostitution process that involved minors. It should be noted that former President William Jefferson Clinton, husband of Democrat Presidential Nominee Hillary Clinton, has been tied to Jeffrey Epstein. Allegedly, Bill Clinton flew on Epstein\u2019s jet multiple times, and even ditched his Security Detail more than once to do so. Epstein is reported to run a vacation island where wealthy individuals can go to have sex with strangers. According to Jane Doe, she attended four parties at Epstein\u2019s venue, and Donald Trump approached her in a sexual way at every party. Allegedly, Trump raped her at the fourth and final party that she attended. Now, one week before the Presidential Election of 2016, Jane Doe scheduled a Press Conference to speak of her experience, publicly, for the first time. Doe is represented by Lisa Bloom, daughter of celebrity ambulance-chasing lawyer Gloria Allred. She is asking for $75,000 in damages. Trump\u2019s response to the allegation is clear. \u201cThe allegations are not only categorically false, but disgusting at the highest level and clearly framed to solicit media attention or, perhaps, are simply politically motivated. There is absolutely no merit to these allegations. Period.\u201d The Press Conference was to happen today, but, unfortunately for Jane Doe\u2019s lawyer, was cancelled.
