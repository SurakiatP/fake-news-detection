The site, which housed some 2,000 refugees until last week, now contains 16 apartments that will never be used as the occupants already own at least four other properties each. Developer Julian Cook said: \u201cWe\u2019re hoping to get some really rich people moved in here as soon as possible. \u201c We won\u2019t be calling it the Calais Jungle any more either, because that might put some buyers off. It\u2019ll be called Sunnyside Towers or the East Village or something stupidly nice instead. \u201cAlthough there will be a club and cocktail bar in the basement called \u2018Jungle Nites\u2019, because when you build these places you have to respect local history.\u201d \u201cI t will have a massive wall built around it to make sure only rich people can get in.\u201d He added: \u201c There will still be immigrants here, obviously. After all, the toilets won\u2019t clean themselves.\u201d \\nShare:'"}, "time": 1742563942.576623}
