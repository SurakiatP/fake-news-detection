The company is currently seeking a $85 billion acquisition deal for Time Warner. \\nDocuments show the telecommunications giant was not only working with US Drug Enforcement Agency but routinely sold customer data to local police departments who were investigating a range of crimes from murder to Medicaid fraud. The documents were first reported by The Daily Beast. AT&T provides the leads, then investigators just happen to find the exact same evidence through police work: https://t.co/d01Uc4iWYm \u2014 The Daily Beast (@thedailybeast) October 25, 2016 \\nUnder its secretive program called Hemisphere, AT&T could search trillions of call records and analyze cellular data to determine where a target is located, with whom they speak and potentially why. \\nThe documents also show the company only required an administrative subpoena, a lower-level legal document which \u2013 unlike a search warrant \u2013 does not require authorization from a judge. Police departments paid anywhere from $100,000 to $1 million a year for access to the Hemisphere program. Under the agreement, police were prohibited from disclosing use of the program to the public or even in court. \\n\u201cLike other communications companies, if a government agency seeks customer call records through a subpoena, court order or other mandatory legal process, we are required by law to provide this non-content information, such as the phone numbers and the date and time of call,\u201d AT&T told the Beast in a statement.

AT&T was one of the first companies to be exposed for its role in government surveillance when it shared its customer\u2019s metadata with the NSA. \\nMark Klein, a former AT&T technician and whistleblower, revealed details about the NSA installing network hardware at a San Francisco, California site known at Room 641A to monitor, capture and process American telecommunications, beginning in 2002. \\n\u201cI knew this wasn\u2019t legal because the NSA is not supposed to do domestic spying,\u201d Klein told RT in an interview in 2015. He said the engineering documents showed \u201cthey were tapping into the main data flow on the internet and sending that data down to the secret room.\u201d \\n\u201cI knew that was totally illegal. The apparatus itself did not provide for any kind of selection it was just a vacuum cleaner sweep of everything. That violates the Fourth Amendment right there which requires warrants for specific information,\u201d Klein said. \\nAT&T was also known to have a \u201cpartnership\u201d \u2013 through its Hemisphere program \u2013 with the DEA for the purpose of counter-narcotics operations. \\nThe revelations come as AT&T\u2019s proposed $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner has surveillance critics and privacy advocates alarmed. \\nJeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, told the Daily Beast he opposed the merger because it would allow AT&T \"to use Time Warner\u2019s content as bait to invade every aspect of the lives and habits of its nearly 30 million wired customers of its broadband and television services \u2013 many through its DirecTV subsidiary \u2013 and its more than 100 million wireless subscribers.\" \\n\u201cIt\u2019s commercial surveillance,\u201d Chester told the Beast, noting that through mobile devices, AT&T can even pinpoint the geographical locations of users.'"}, "time": 1742563261.0545995}
