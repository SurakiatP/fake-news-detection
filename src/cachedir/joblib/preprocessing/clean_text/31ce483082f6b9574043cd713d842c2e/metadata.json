Fortunately, the entire ordeal was caught on camera. | November 7, 2016 Be Sociable, Share! A member of the Stutsman County SWAT team who declined to give his name nor to be identifiable by badge stands guard by an armored personnel carrier while deployed to watch protesters demonstrating against the Dakota Access Pipeline near the Stand Rock Sioux Reservation, in Cannon Ball, N.D., Sunday, Oct. 30, 2016. \\nTensions continue to escalate in Cannon Ball, North Dakota, where protesters attempt to peacefully face off against riot police and the National Guard. In addition to being maced and beaten with batons, activists opposing the four-state Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) have been tased and even shot with rubber bullets. \\nAs the recent incident (below) reveals, violence seems to only be escalating rather than ceasing. Though the UN has called on the U.S. government to halt all construction of the pipeline , its development continues. Desperate and on edge, activists at Standing Rock continue to put their lives on the line, unaware of what will come next \u2013 prepared to expect anything. Unfortunately, what recently occurred is a reminder of the danger people protesting corporate greed face. I was shot by militarized police WHILE interviewing a man on camera at #StandingRock \u2026and here's the footage. #NoDAPL https://t.co/FfWiSCbiKf pic.twitter.com/4DRwNPkfZ9 \\n\u2014 Erin Schrode (@ErinSchrode) November 3, 2016 \\nDuring an interview with Cantapeta Creek, activist and journalist Erin Schrode was talking when out of nowhere, police shot her with a rubber bullet. She can be heard screaming, \u201cOw!\u201d before crumbling to the ground. \\nIn the Facebook post , Schrode wrote that while \u201cmilitarized police\u201d shot her at \u201cpoint-blank range\u201d, she was physically unhurt but shaken from the attack. In an interview with Fusion , she later relayed that she couldn\u2019t fully comprehend what had happened but just remembered being in \u201cexcruciating pain.\u201d \\nShe said: \u201cI couldn\u2019t fathom that I\u2019d just been hit. Why would they target me? Why would they shoot anyone? There was absolutely nothing violent, aggressive, provocative going on at the protests yesterday.\u201d \\nThe day after the activist realized she\u2019d caught the entire incident on camera, she quickly uploaded it to social media to share with the world. \\nWhat\u2019s happening in Standing Rock doesn\u2019t just pertain to the indigenous in the area, it affects present and future generations. In addition to trying to protect the Missouri river, activists supporting the Standing Rock Sioux tribe are hoping to preserve sacred burial ground and send a message about the need to respect Native American treaties. Commenting on the scene at Standing Rock, Schrode says: \u201cI can\u2019t believe what is happening here in Standing Rock. It\u2019s a scene like I\u2019ve never seen anywhere else in the world, and it\u2019s right here at home.\u201d \\nYou can bet that this activist isn\u2019t leaving Standing Rock until justice is served. She\u2019ll remain \u2013 like the majority of people who have set up camp on the edge of the reservation \u2013 until the pipeline is halted or all are physically forced off the land. If the latter occurs, expect deafening outcry from activists around the world. These men shot me at #StandingRock today. I pray for them\u2013 and for our peaceful, prayerful water protectors. #NoDAPL https://t.co/hUXigAF6u4 pic.twitter.com/5HI14dTEO8 \\n\u2014 Erin Schrode (@ErinSchrode) November 3, 2016 This work by True Activist is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 International License.\""}, "time": 1742564260.1152496}
