They are all graduates of just three Ivy League law schools. None are Protestants. All but one come from a coastal state. In remarks last week in Arizona and Colorado, Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, President Obama\u2019s two appointees, steered clear of commenting directly on the stalled nomination of his third choice, Judge Merrick B. Garland. But they did talk about how a new colleague could reinforce or disrupt a court that is in some ways exceptionally homogeneous. \u201cWe\u2019re not as diverse as some would like in many important characteristics  \u2014   educational institutions, religion, places where we come from,\u201d Justice Sotomayor said on Thursday at a judicial conference here. Justice Kagan, speaking on Wednesday at the University of Arizona in Tucson, said the court may suffer from what she called a \u201ccoastal perspective,\u201d The Arizona Daily Star reported. (She is from New York City. As is Justice Sotomayor. As is Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. As was Justice Scalia. Between the four of them, they represented every borough but Staten Island.) Justice Scalia made a similar point in a dissent last year. \u201cEight of them grew up in East and West Coast states,\u201d Justice Scalia wrote of the court\u2019s membership at the time. \u201cOnly one hails from the vast expanse \u201d he added, referring to Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. who is from Indiana. On this score, Judge Garland would bring a dash of variety to the court, as he is from Chicago. But he has long worked in Washington, in the Justice Department and, for the past 19 years, on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In other ways, Judge Garland would not bring notable diversity to the Supreme Court. He attended Harvard Law School, as did five of the current justices. (The other three went to Yale. Justice Ginsburg started at Harvard and graduated from Columbia.) Judge Garland is Jewish, as are three of the current justices. (The other five are Roman Catholic.) In last year\u2019s dissent, Justice Scalia, also Catholic, mused that his court included \u201cnot a single evangelical Christian (a group that comprises about   of Americans) or even a Protestant of any denomination. \u201d Judge Garland would be the eighth former federal appeals court judge on the Supreme Court. (The exception is Justice Kagan.) Justices used to come from more varied professional backgrounds. They had often been governors, lawmakers, cabinet members, law professors, practicing lawyers or state court judges. As late as 1972, when Justice William H. Rehnquist joined the court, former federal judges were in the minority. At the judicial conference here on Friday, Justice Kagan suggested that prior judicial experience or other deep engagement with the law was desirable given the broad social issues the Supreme Court sometimes decides. In those cases, she said, \u201claw has a kind of values feel to it. \u201d \u201cEven in those cases, you have to understand that it\u2019s still about law,\u201d Justice Kagan said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want a court of   philosophers. You want a court of people who really care about law and are good at doing it and are experienced at doing it and who bring that worldview even to cases that involve matters of broad principle. \u201d Both justices said that more diversity on the court would bolster public confidence in its work. \u201cPeople look at an institution and they see people who are like them, who share their experiences, who they imagine share their set of values, and that\u2019s a sort of natural thing and they feel more comfortable if that occurs,\u201d Justice Kagan said in Tucson. But does diversity on the bench affect outcomes? \u201cIt\u2019s obviously true,\u201d Justice Kagan said, \u201cthat people bring their backgrounds and experiences to the job in some sense. \u201d But Justice Sotomayor said that shared experiences can lead to different perspectives, mentioning her ideological opposite, Justice Clarence Thomas. Both grew up poor, and both climbed to the pinnacle of the American legal profession. \u201cYou would think that Clarence Thomas and I would be more similar, wouldn\u2019t you, if you looked just at our background and upbringing,\u201d Justice Sotomayor said. Both justices said that vacancies are so infrequent and tenures are so long that change will come haltingly. \u201cThe Supreme Court is never going to be a melting pot reflective of the country,\u201d Justice Sotomayor said. \u201cIn most of our lifetimes, the court is only going to turn over one full circle. \u201d Asked if there would ever be a female chief justice, she said, \u201cWe hope that Chief Justice Roberts will have a very long tenure, and if he does, the issue of whether a woman would or would not be appointed would be a product of the circumstances of that moment. \u201d For now, the   Supreme Court has a muted quality. It \u201csputters along on its new screensaver mode,\u201d Dahlia Lithwick wrote in Slate. That is partly a consequence of the loss of an outsize personality, Justice Sotomayor said. \u201cNino Scalia was a big presence and he took up a lot of space in the room,\u201d she said, using her former colleague\u2019s nickname. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that arguments have toned down a little bit. There are more silent pauses during argument. \u201d There is also the matter of simple math. The   court has been working hard to avoid deadlocks, Justice Sotomayor said, but sometimes at the expense of actually resolving anything. \u201cThere\u2019s a few cases where you can see we ruled very, very, very narrowly,\u201d she said, \u201cand it doesn\u2019t take a genius to figure out why. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562902.6395144}
