In another first, growth in renewables outstripped all other forms of new power generation in 2015, with clean energy accounting for more than half of the world\u2019s new electricity capacity added last year.\\nThe new figures, released in a market report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) this week, mean that energy forecasts from only a year ago now need to be revised \u2013 with renewables growth between 2015 and 2021 predicted to be 13 percent greater than estimated last year.\\nThat revised estimate should see renewables be responsible for 28 percent of electricity generation by 2021 \u2013 last year, it accounted for 23 percent , so each year, renewables take over about 1 percent of the electricity market.\\nThat 2021 prediction might only be a little over a quarter of the world\u2019s total electricity in five years\u2019 time, but it amounts to a massive 7,600 terawatt hours \u2013 equivalent to the total combined electricity generation of the US and the European Union (EU) today.\\nAnd in that five-year timespan, renewables are expected to absorb 60 percent of all power capacity growth, which basically means the IEA doesn\u2019t see the record-setting gains shown in the past year slowing down any time soon.\\n\u201cWe are witnessing a transformation of global power markets led by renewables and, as is the case with other fields, the centre of gravity for renewable growth is moving to emerging markets,\u201d said IEA executive director Fatih Birol .\\nIn those emerging markets, the rate of renewables adoption is almost unimaginably fast. In China, two new wind turbines were installed every hour in 2015, meaning the nation had built almost 20,000 new turbines by the end of the year.\\nThat flurry of investment saw China soak up about half of all new wind power additions, and approximately 40 percent of global renewable capacity increases in total.\\nWind power led the growth in renewables, adding 66 gigawatt (GW) of capacity in 2015, followed by solar , which represented 49 GW.\\nAnd just in case you think that means solar\u2019s been slacking off, bear this in mind: that additional 49 GW of capacity amounts to about 500,000 new solar panels being installed around the world every day last year.\\nSo obviously there\u2019s a lot to celebrate in these new figures, which the IEA puts down to stronger renewables policies \u2013 chiefly in the US, China, India, and Mexico \u2013 plus falling prices thanks to stronger competition in the marketplace, and better technology .\\nBut the researchers also say we need to make sure the momentum keeps up.\\nMany countries around the world still aren\u2019t getting behind renewables strongly enough, and even in nations that have thrown their support behind clean power \u2013 such as China \u2013 their increase in renewables capacity still doesn\u2019t meet their ever-higher electricity demands.\\nWhereas in the US, EU, and Japan, additional renewables capacity is expected to outpace electricity demand over the next five years.\\nThe report also shows that the renewables landscape has changed, with industrialised countries \u2013 that once led the charge on clean power \u2013 losing ground to emerging nations like China and India. By 2021, these two nations alone are predicted to account for almost half of global renewable capacity additions.\\n\u201cIf you think of running a marathon, Europe started with a big advance, more than half of the marathon they are leading by far,\u201d Birol told Adam Vaughan at The Guardian . \u201cThey are now getting a bit tired, and some others are overtaking Europe slowly but surely.\u201d\\nEven with the massive gains we\u2019re making, though, the researchers warn that uptake still isn\u2019t happening fast enough for the world to meet the ambitious commitments made at the 2015 UN Paris climate deal , designed to keep rises in global temperature under 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century.\\nIn other words, we\u2019ve come a long way on renewables, but there\u2019s still a long way to go .\\n\u201cI am pleased to see that last year was one of records for renewables and that our projections for growth over the next five years are more optimistic,\u201d Birol said in a statement .\\n\u201cHowever, even these higher expectations remain modest compared with the huge untapped potential of renewables.\\nThe Medium-Term Renewable Energy Market Report 2016 is available online.\\nSource: Science Alert \\n'"}, "time": 1742562256.718461}
