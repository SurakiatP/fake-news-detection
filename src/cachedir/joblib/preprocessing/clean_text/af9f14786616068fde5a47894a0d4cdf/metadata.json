[\u201cMy heart is filled with gratitude for the 90 years that the good God has given me,\u201d said Benedict, who retired as pope on Feb. 28, 2013, the first pontiff to do so in 600 years.  \u201cThere have also been trials and difficult times, but through it all He has always led me and pulled me through, so that I could continue on my path,\u201d he said. Prior to his election as Pope Benedict on April 19, 2005, Joseph Ratzinger enjoyed a brilliant career as university professor, bishop and author and has been acclaimed as one of the most eminent Catholic theologians of the late 20th century. Saint John Paul II brought Ratzinger to Rome in November 1981 to serve as prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, a role he held for more than 20 years until the death of Pope John Paul in 2005. Although a gentle,   man in person, Ratzinger proved a faithful caretaker of Catholic doctrine, and was especially tough on   \u201cLiberation Theology,\u201d which attempted to   salvation history through the prism of the Marxist ideology of class struggle between social classes. Surrounded by friends and   from his native Bavaria on his birthday, Benedict said he was full of thanks in a special way for his \u201cbeautiful homeland,\u201d adorned with \u201cchurch towers, houses with balconies filled with flowers, and good people. \u201d Bavaria is beautiful, Benedict reminisced, \u201cbecause God is known there and people know that He has created the world and that we do well to build it up together with Him. \u201d \u201cI am glad that we were able to gather together under the beautiful blue Roman sky,\u201d he continued, \u201cwhich with its white clouds also reminds us of the white and blue flag of Bavaria \u2014  it is always the same sky. \u201d \u201cI wish you all God\u2019s blessings,\u201d he said. \u201cCarry my greetings home, as well as my gratitude to you. How I enjoy to continue living and walking about amidst our landscapes in my heart. \u201d Follow Thomas D. Williams on Twitter Follow @tdwilliamsrome'"}, "time": 1742562976.326349}
