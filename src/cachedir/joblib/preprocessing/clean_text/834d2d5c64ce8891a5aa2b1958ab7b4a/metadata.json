Trump intensified his sweeping claims of corruption in the American justice system. The announcement by James B. Comey, the F. B. I. director, of a new review of emails that may be linked to Mrs. Clinton overshadowed the candidates\u2019 usual messages over the weekend. The news threw Mrs. Clinton and the Trump campaign into an unexpected debate over both her emails and Mr. Comey\u2019s conduct, though only scant information has been made public about the substance of the F. B. I. \u2019s activities. Campaigning in Florida, Mrs. Clinton appeared to group Mr. Comey\u2019s surprise role in the presidential race with the flurry of partisan attacks that often mark the last days of political campaigns. Without mentioning Mr. Comey by name, Mrs. Clinton struck a defiant note at a nightclub in Wilton Manors, she invoked her mother\u2019s admonition to \u201cnever, ever quit. \u201d \u201cWe won\u2019t be distracted, no matter what our opponents throw at us,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be knocked off course. We know how much this election matters, and we know how many people are counting on us. \u201d At a black church in Fort Lauderdale, Mrs. Clinton urged voters to turn out in force to vote in order to reject \u201ca negative, hateful, bigoted vision\u201d on the other side of the race. If Mrs. Clinton has aimed to stifle interest in her emails, Mr. Trump has seized on Mr. Comey\u2019s announcement with exuberant glee. At a rally on Sunday in Colorado, Mr. Trump called the disclosure a \u201cbig bombshell\u201d and predicted it would lift him in the polls. Having spent months criticizing both Mr. Comey and the Department of Justice for deciding not to press charges against Mrs. Clinton for her use of a private email server, Mr. Trump redirected his attack on Sunday, going after Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Mr. Trump accused Ms. Lynch of corruption for failing to indict Mrs. Clinton, claiming without evidence that Ms. Lynch had likely interfered with an investigation in the hope of retaining her job in a Clinton administration. \u201cEffectively, you\u2019d call that a bribe, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d Mr. Trump asked at a speech in Las Vegas. Mr. Trump\u2019s closest advisers stopped well short of his provocative claim. But on the Sunday news programs, allies of Mr. Trump, including his running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, attempted to sow deeper doubts about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s trustworthiness without explicitly attacking the justice system. Still, both sides  \u2014   having scant information about what, exactly, Mr. Comey\u2019s new review might entail  \u2014   offered more insinuations than arguments with Election Day just nine days away. The code word for Mr. Pence was \u201ctroubled\u201d  \u2014   a term he used freely on television to raise the notion, if not quite an accusation, that prosecutors had gone easy on Mrs. Clinton. \u201cI\u2019m one of millions of Americans that were troubled by that  \u2014   why there\u2019s this double standard when it comes to the Clintons,\u201d Mr. Pence said on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on NBC. \u201cI mean, no one is above the law. \u201d And for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s allies, the word of the day was \u201cpuzzled\u201d  \u2014   the descriptor top Clinton surrogates wielded repeatedly as they implied, without quite saying, that Mr. Comey had staged an unforgivable political intervention late in the presidential race. \u201cIt\u2019s just extremely puzzling,\u201d said Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s running mate, on \u201cThis Week\u201d on ABC. \u201cI just have no way of understanding these actions. They\u2019re completely unprecedented and that\u2019s why I think he owes the American public more information. \u201d The stakes of the clash, muddled as it is, are plainly higher for Democrats: Mrs. Clinton had led consistently in polls ahead of Mr. Comey\u2019s announcement, and appeared close to having a firm lock on the 270 Electoral College votes required for victory. Only a late plot twist, it seemed, might be capable of undoing her advantage. It is unclear whether Mr. Comey\u2019s actions could amount to such an unforeseen turn. Mr. Comey, who notified Congress on Friday that information from a separate case prompted the fresh review of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails, has not offered any additional comment on the matter. Government officials have described the F. B. I. \u2019s new information as emerging from an investigation into allegations that Anthony D. Weiner, a former congressman married to Huma Abedin, one of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s closest aides, exchanged sexually themed messages with a teenager. Clinton allies repeatedly accused Mr. Comey of breaching Justice Department protocols by commenting on a confidential inquiry so close to an election, and expressed bewilderment at his conduct. Robby Mook, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, adopted the same phrasing, describing the campaign as \u201cso puzzled\u201d by Mr. Comey\u2019s actions. He lamented that Mr. Comey had opened the floodgates to wild speculation by offering such a nonspecific announcement. \u201cThe issue here is, if he doesn\u2019t come out and get all the information on the table, he\u2019s going to let anyone  \u2014   any conspiracy theory  \u2014   take the day,\u201d Mr. Mook said on \u201cMeet the Press. \u201d But Mr. Mook said he did not expect the F. B. I. director\u2019s unusual action to cost Mrs. Clinton the election. On the contrary, Mr. Mook said Mrs. Clinton was faring well in early voting and could lock down one or more swing states, starting with Nevada, before Election Day. A smattering of new polling information released on Sunday painted a mixed picture of the race in its final days, with Mrs. Clinton consistently holding an advantage but of uncertain size. It is likely too soon to see any direct effect from Friday\u2019s events, casting additional uncertainty over the importance of the latest revelations. Still, an ABC   Post tracking poll showed Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advantage nationally slipping to just one percentage point, in a dramatic narrowing over the past week. And a New York   College poll showed Mr. Trump retaking the lead in Florida. But polling from NBC News and The Wall Street Journal, conducted by Marist College, found Mrs. Clinton faring better in Florida, ahead of Mr. Trump there by one point, and leading him by six points in North Carolina. Mr. Trump is spending several of the few days left in the race campaigning well outside the traditional band of states that decide presidential elections. He was campaigning on Sunday in New Mexico and plans on Monday to be in Michigan  \u2014   two solidly blue states where polling has shown Mrs. Clinton with a clear lead.'"}, "time": 1742561834.7997212}
