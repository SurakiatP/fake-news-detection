Never before has virtually the entire mainstream media avidly, emphatically endorsed one Presidential candidate while furiously, contemptuously vilifying the other. Never has a sitting President joined in general denunciation of a candidate. With ten days to go it\\x92s affirmed by most key sources that Donald Trump can\\x92t win and Hillary Clinton will. Many pundits predict a landslide for her. Assume it. What then? The most hated President-elect ever will not be loved by the Congress she will confront. Even with a majority in the Senate--just possible--and in the House--not--prospects for a legislative agenda, should she have one, are non-existent. What Obama\\x92s phony charm failed to achieve, Hillary\\x92s lack of it will scarcely obtain. This presages four more years of stasis and nullity, of social and economic rot, financial chicanery, and national decay. As regards the composition of the Supreme Court--the panicky Liberal pitch for being \\x93with her\\x94--unless she nominates hidebound conservatives, which is probable, not a single selection will be confirmed during her term. So... paralysis in Congress, reaction in the Court; two limbs of government neutralized, gives us rule by a disliked, distrusted figurehead with the full power of Wall Street and the Imperial War-loving Establishment behind her. What then will be accomplished? First, the interests of The Empire will be promoted at least as robustly as in Obama\\x92s eight years of sycophancy. Including his Rube Goldbergian Obamacare, still foundering and gouging, nothing of any benefit to Americans was achieved under this charlatan who perfected the skill of describing an airplane crash as a triumph of gravity. So what will she do in office? Well, start with what she won\\x92t do. She won\\x92t make any effort to restrain The Big Casino, the Gold Sacks Mafia. They made her an offer she couldn\\x92t refuse. She won\\x92t attempt any closing of the inequality gap. That would entail clipping her base--\\x94Our Crowd\\x94 of the Hamptons, Palm Beach and Beverly Hills. She won\\x92t meddle with Sick Care--\\x94fool me once...\\x94--or, corporate tax enforcement. Her Big Donors don\\x92t want to pay them and why should they, right? She can just let Labor die of its own raging leukemia. College grads have to stay in their parents\\x92 basements and service their college debt via Macdonalds because Arbeit Macht Frei. No need to do anything about Global Warming so long as you denounce it boldly at international meetings. Best leave the environment in the hands of those who can turn idle nature into money. Besides, the solution to pollution is dilution and clearcuts grow back in a millenium or so. On the minor agenda, she knows there are still small poor countries who require our R2P and cluster bombs. Others have resources that, with the odd military coup or assassination, should come on line nicely. Africa, say, has low-hanging fruit, and the Latin American mess needs our firm hand to prevent Lefty dictators diverting perfectly good profits to their own societies. Turning to the major crises, Exceptionalism requires that they be made far bigger. Our Defense Industries can\\x92t be expected to muck along forever on paltry brushfire wars: Iraq, Afghanistan--though in fairness they\\x92ve profuced steady income streams--and Libya, no bonanza, and Syria, which Putin\\x92s diabolical meddling prevented blossoming as we hoped. Still, there\\x92s no earthly reason we can\\x92t achieve a profitable Third World War simply by refusing to take the bait of Satanic Putin\\x92s wimpy peace offers and calling them what they really are: a mortal threat to our Capitalist System. So much for her first Hundred Days. Beyond the panicked cheerleading of the Imperial Elite--those that the late, great George Carlin referred to as \\x93your owners\\x94--and their failing organs of crowd manipulation, and beyond the day Clinton takes office if their hopes are consummated, America faces a cataclysmic crisis of governance; one of the order of magnitude of the secession of The South under Lincoln. Clinton and Trump are the physical, mental and emotional symptoms of that crisis. Our dead system must, and will, have catharsis. Which of them precipitates it may not greatly matter. Or it may mean everything. As Brutus said at Philippi: \\x93Oh, that a man might know the end of this days business ere it come; but it sufficeth that the day will end and then the end is known.\\x94\\nPaul Edwards is a writer and film-maker in Montana.
