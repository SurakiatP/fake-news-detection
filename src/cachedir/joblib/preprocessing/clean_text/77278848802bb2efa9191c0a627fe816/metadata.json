[\u201cI stress to you once again: the Syrian army has not, did not, and will not use this kind of weapons  \u2014   not just against our own people, but even against the terrorists that are targeting our civilians indiscriminately,\u201d Muallem said at a press conference in Damascus, as reported by  .  Muallem went on to give the same account of the incident that Russia has insisted upon, claiming that Syrian warplanes \u201cattacked an arms depot belonging to   Front,\u201d which is  \u2019s affiliate in Syria. The Foreign Minister claimed the Nusra Front, ISIS, and other organizations \u201ccontinue to store chemical weapons in urban and residential areas. \u201d He dismissed calls for an international investigation by saying Syria\u2019s previous experience with \u201cpoliticized\u201d investigations was \u201cnot encouraging\u201d because \u201cthey come out of Damascus with certain indications which then change at their headquarters. \u201d Walid also went out of his way to slam Turkey, evidently in response to Turkish denunciation of the attack in Idlib, and Turkey\u2019s treatment of victims from the chemical weapons deployment. Turkish authorities have said autopsies of people killed in the attack revealed signs of chemical weapons exposure.'"}, "time": 1742628555.5387552}
