Blair had argued that Britain should stay in the EU before the referendum. \\nEconomic growth in the UK is expected to slow significantly next year, due to uncertainty over of the Brexit vote. \\nExperts have warned that leaving the EU will severely hurt London\u2019s position as a financial hub, unless the UK decides to keep its access to the single EU market by loosening its stance on immigration. \\nIf the UK loses its access to the EU\u2019s single market, the resulting increase in the costs of doing business and exporting to the EU would hurt Britain\u2019s competitive position in Europe.
