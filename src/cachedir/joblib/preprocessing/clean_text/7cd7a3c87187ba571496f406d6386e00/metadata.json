Amanda Kosal pleaded guilty to killing    Jerome Zirker and severely injuring his    fiancee Brittany Johnson. She was sentenced to three to 15 years in prison. Judge Lillard said Donna Kosal and an unidentified boyfriend were acting disrespectfully in the courtroom. \u201cIt\u2019s time for him to go,\u201d Judge Lillard said, looking out into the gallery. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know who he is, but whoever can sit here at a tragic moment like this and laugh and smile when somebody has lost a family member  \u2026     in the entire time that Mr. Zirker\u2019s sister was speaking that clown, and that\u2019s what I am going to call him, a clown, was sitting there smiling and laughing. \u201d A guard escorted the man from the room, and Judge Lillard addressed Donna. \u201cYou can go too because if you don\u2019t know how to act, you can go to jail, so leave,\u201d she said. When Judge Lillard brought Donna back in, they exchanged a few words and the judge motioned to the bailiffs to take Donna to jail. \u201cTake her, she\u2019s going in the back,\u201d the judge said to the bailiffs. \u201cAnybody else wanna go? You can go, too. \u201d Donna said something   about the judge\u2019s mouth, to which the judge replied, \u201cOh, my mouth? Well, thank you, your mouth got you 93 days,\u201d the New York Post reported. The next day, Donna appeared before the judge, and apologized for what she did. \u201cI deeply apologize for what I did. I was under a lot of stress,\u201d Donna said to the judge. The judge took pity on her and reduced her sentence by 92 days, setting her free. Amanda\u2019s vehicle slammed into Johnson and Zirker head on, crossing the center line.
