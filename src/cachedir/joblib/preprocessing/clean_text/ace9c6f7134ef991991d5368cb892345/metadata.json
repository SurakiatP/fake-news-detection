[Snatched doesn\u2019t hit theaters until Friday, May 12, but already reviewers from the New York Times, the Hollywood Reporter and IndieWire have derided the film as \u201clazy,\u201d \u201cuninspired\u201d and \u201cwildly scattershot. \u201d  The film stars Schumer as Emily Middleton, who is dumped by her boyfriend just before a planned exotic vacation to Ecuador. While Middleton persuades her mother (Goldie Hawn, in her first film appearance in 15 years) to join her on the trip, the two get more than they bargained for as they try to survive after being kidnapped in the jungle. In his review of the film, the New York Times\u2018 A. O. Scott calls the film \u201clazy, sloppy and witless,\u201d and says Hawn in particular is \u201ccruelly and inexplicably\u201d denied the ability to be as funny as she can be. \u201cSnatched is one of those movies that subscribes to a dubious homeopathic theory of cultural insensitivity by which the acknowledgment of offensiveness is supposed to prevent anyone from taking offense,\u201d Scott wrote. \u201cThe idea is that if you use variations on the phrase \u2018That\u2019s racist!\u2019 as a punch line a few times, nothing else you say or do could possibly be racist. Including, say, populating your movie with   thugs with funny accents and killing a few of them for cheap laughs. \u201d But perhaps the most harsh criticism of the film comes from IndieWire\u2019s Kate Erbland, who calls it \u201ccriminally unfunny. \u201d Like Scott, Erbland says Snatched commits the \u201cunforgivable sin\u201d of not allowing Hawn to \u201cinhabit her stature as a great comedic performer. \u201d \u201cOne character calls [Schumer\u2019s character] \u2018garbage\u2019 (and makes her repeat the insult) while another tells her she\u2019ll be safe from sex trafficking because she\u2019s just not pretty enough, but even these attempts to add some meat to the undercooked film fall flat,\u201d Erbland wrote, giving the film a D grade. \u201cPairing up talented comedians like Hawn and Schumer with a wacky plotline to match should spell comedy gold, but Snatched is about as cheap and disposable as a tourist trap tchotchke. \u201d The Village Voice\u2018s Melissa Anderson was similarly down on the film, accusing it of trading in \u201coffhand xenophobia\u201d and \u201csoft racism\u201d for its depiction of two white main characters unable to cope in a foreign country. \u201c[Hawn\u2019s]   performance here, however understandable, suggests she may have regretted the decision to end her \u201d Anderson wrote. Meanwhile, Variety\u2018s Owen Glieberman and the Hollywood Reporter\u2018s Jon Frosch gave the movie slightly better marks, though Glieberman wrote that the film\u2019s \u201c  jokes are like firecrackers with damp fuses. \u201d \u201cStill, in the apocalyptically bleak landscape of the mainstream studio comedy, the mere sight of Schumer and Hawn just doing their thing is almost pleasing enough to get a pass. Almost,\u201d writes THR\u2018s Frosch. Snatched   Wanda Sykes, Joan Cusack, Ike Barinholtz, Randall Park, Tom Bateman, and Christopher Meloni. Jonathan Levine (The Wackness) directed off of a script by writer Katie Dippold (The Heat, Ghostbusters). The film hits theaters May 12.
