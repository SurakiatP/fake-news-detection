The image below shows Arctic sea ice extent on October 26, 2016, when extent was only 6.801 million km\u00b2. \\nOne reason for the low sea ice extent is the high and rising temperature of the Arctic Ocean. On October 27, 2016, the Arctic Ocean was as warm as 14.8\u00b0C or 58.6\u00b0F (green circle near Svalbard), 12.1\u00b0C or 21.7\u00b0F warmer than 1981-2011, as the image below shows. \\nOn October 29, 2016, the Arctic Ocean was as warm as 14.9\u00b0C or 58.8\u00b0F (green circle near Svalbard), 12.1\u00b0C or 21.8\u00b0F warmer than 1981-2011, as the image below shows. \\nAs the sea ice shrinks, less sunlight gets reflected back into space, while more open water and higher sea surface temperatures also cause storms and cyclones to become stronger. Stronger cyclones also cause greater amounts of water vapor to move up the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean toward the Arctic.

The two above images show temperature forecasts for November 1 & 2, 2016. In both cases, temperatures over the Arctic as a whole are forecast to be as much as 6.40\u00b0C higher than 1979-2000. \\nAs these images show, temperature anomalies in many places are at the top end of the scale, i.e. +20\u00b0C or +36\u00b0F. \\nAbove combination image shows record low Arctic sea ice for the time of the year (left) and near record low Antarctic sea ice for the time of the year (right), with a combined sea ice extent of only 23.751 million km\u00b2 on October 28, 2016. In other words, the world is now absorbing a lot of sunlight that was previously reflected back into space. \\nBelow are two further temperature forecast: \\nAbove image shows forecasts for October 31, 2016. The Arctic is forecast to be 6.07\u00b0C warmer than 1979-2000, while the Antarctic is forecast to be 4.56\u00b0C warmer than 1979-2000. \\nAbove image shows forecasts for November 1, 2016. The Arctic is forecast to be 6.42\u00b0C warer than 1979-2000, while the Antarctic is forecast to be 3.70\u00b0C warmer than 1979-2000. \\nRising temperatures over the Arctic further contribute to a rise in the amount of water vapor in the air over the Arctic at a rate of 7% more water vapor for every 1\u00b0C warming. Since water vapor is a potent greenhouse gas, more water vapor further accelerates warming in the Arctic. \\nThe Climate Reanalyzer image below shows the temperature rise in the Arctic over time. \\nIn the video below, Dr. Walt Meier of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center describes how the Arctic has been losing its thicker and older sea ice over the years (1991 to September 2016). \\nThe Naval Research Lab 30-day thickness animation below (up to October 28, 2016, with forecasts up to November 5, 2016) further shows minimal recent growth of the Arctic sea ice, especially in terms of the ice with a thickness of 1m or above. \\nAs the Arctic Ocean gets warmer, the danger grows that large amounts of methane will erupt from destabilizing hydrates at its seafloor. Ominously, high methane levels are visible over the Arctic on the image below, showing methane levels as high as 2424 ppb on October 24, 2016. \\nThe animation below, made with images from another satellite (and a different scale), shows high methane levels over th Arctic Ocean from October 26 to 28, 2016.'"}, "time": 1742562703.4046154}
