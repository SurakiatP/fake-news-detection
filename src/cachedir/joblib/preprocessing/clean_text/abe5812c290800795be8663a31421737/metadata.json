Some worry that they will be forgotten, along with their concerns and frustrations. Others believe the nation may be headed for violent conflict. \\nJared Halbrook, 25, of Green Bay, Wis., said that if Mr. Trump lost to Hillary Clinton, which he worried would happen through a stolen election, it could lead to \u201canother Revolutionary War.\u201d \\n\u201cPeople are going to march on the capitols,\u201d said Mr. Halbrook, who works at a call center. \u201cThey\u2019re going to do whatever needs to be done to get her out of office, because she does not belong there.\u201d \\n\u201cIf push comes to shove,\u201d he added, and Mrs. Clinton \u201chas to go by any means necessary, it will be done.\u201d \\nWhat\u2019s ominous about this level of programming is that we know the system is already gearing up for this possibility with an election military drill that could go live at any time until a month after the election, as previously reported: \\nAccording to an unnamed source \u2013 who has provided accurate intel in the past \u2013 an unannounced military drill is scheduled to take place during a period leading up to the election and throughout the month after. \\nIt appears that the system is gearing up to handle outbreaks of violence, chaotic rallies and poll stations, and the possibility that the people of the United States may become very dissatisfied with the outcome by using military force and martial law. \\nThe drill could, of course, go live at any time; Homeland Security and the military are prepared to contend with a period of unrest, and restore order to a divided and broken country \u2013 regardless of whether people like their new leader or not. \\nAs you know, DHS is already monitoring this election and prepared to take over its \u2018critical infrastructure\u2019. The scope of this drill would, of course, take things much further: \\nHi Guys, \\nI got some gouge from a former military colleague who is in contact with active duty personnel and he received an email about an upcoming drill. We need confirmation on this, but if we put it out there we might get a leaker to come forward and confirm: \\nDate: October 30th \u2013 30 days after the election Suspected Region: Northeast, specifically New York \\n1st Phase: NROL (No Rule of Law) \u2013 drill involving combat arms in metro areas (active and reserve). Source says active duty and reserve service members are being vaccinated as if they are being deployed in theatre. \\n2nd Phase: LROL (Limited Rule of Law) \u2013 Military/FEMA consolidating resources, controlling water supply, handing out to public as needed. \\n3rd Phase: AROL (Authoritarian Rule of Law) \u2013 Possible new acronym or term for \u201cMartial Law\u201d. Curfew, restricted movements, basically martial law scenario. \\nSource said exercise involves FEMA/DHS/Military \\nIf the Powers That Shouldn\u2019t Be are planning to steal this election for Hillary as hard as it appears they are , then it makes sense they\u2019d be planning to try and clean up their mess afterward. \\nEither way, the people have about reached their limit and are sick and tired of this level of corruption coming out of this government\u2026 and we know what happened the last time America finally got fed up with a tyrannical government.
