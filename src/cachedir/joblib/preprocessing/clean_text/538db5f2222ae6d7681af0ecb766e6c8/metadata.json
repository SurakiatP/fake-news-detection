Engineer Roy Hobbs has seemed reluctant to spend time with family members for the last decade or so, preferring to be in the shed or slumped in his chair with a can of lager and a forbidding look on his face. Son Paul Hobbs said: \u201cCome to think of it, dad has seemed a bit pissed off since a few years after I was born. \u201cMaybe something happened near the start of the 20th century that annoyed him. \u201cI suppose we could ask him but that might just make it worse. I sometimes hear whistling from the shed so he seems to be okay when he\u2019s on his own.\u201d Hobbs\u2019s wife Linda said: \u201cHe was quite chirpy during the 90s. He\u2019s probably just hungry.\u201d \\nShare:'"}, "time": 1742628555.5226529}
