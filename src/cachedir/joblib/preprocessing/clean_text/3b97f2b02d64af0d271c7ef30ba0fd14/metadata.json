(Photo: DPS) \\nCommunists from the \u201c Red Guards Austin \u201d were arrested after violently attacking Trump supporters during an anti-Trump rally at the Capitol on Sunday night, as reported at a local CBS affiliate . \\nTrevor Loudon is well aware of the violent and \u201csecretive\u201d Red Guards Austin, who he describes as \u201cextreme Maoist.\u201d This communist group, Loudon explains, is \u201caligned with the Red Guards Los Angeles and the Kansas City Missouri-based Progressive Youth Organization , both of which were heavily involved in anti-Trump protests before the election.\u201d \\nReferring to the arrests, the Red Guards Austin posted the following on Facebook using the code name \u201cPuka\u201d for one of those arrested: \\nA brief perusal of Red Guards Austin Facebook page reveals that this anti-capitalist group is not interested in peace. Advertising an anti-Trump rally last Thursday, they wrote : \\n\u201cCalling all militants. F\u2014 the police. Show up if your pissed at this system and lets shut s\u2014 down.\u201d \\nThe communist group shared an event for students from the \u201c Revolutionary Student Front \u201d (which describes itself as a \u201crevolutionary anti-capitalist student movement\u201d ) scheduled for this Friday night called \u201c\u2018Not My President\u2019 to \u2018No More Presidents!'\u201d which seeks to build \u201ca movement that can create a revolution to end capitalism will burn the oppressive roots from which fascism grows:\u201d \\n\u201cWith Donald Trump as president-elect, a lot of us are wondering how we got here and what we can do about it. The Democratic Party won\u2019t save us; even \u2018progressives\u2019 like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have said they\u2019ll work together with President Trump. Peaceful protest won\u2019t save us ; as Stokely Carmichael said, \u201cNonviolence only works if your opponent has a conscience. The United States has none.\u201d \\nThe only thing that has stopped fascism historically is an organized anti-fascist fighting force; Hitler was only stopped by the Red Army. The rising wave of fascist movements emboldened by Trump\u2019s presidency can only be countered by an even more bold mass movement of anti-capitalist resistance. Now more than ever, the steps necessary for building this type of mass revolutionary movement need to be made. And only a movement that can create a revolution to end capitalism will burn the oppressive roots from which fascism grows. \\nJoin the Revolutionary Student Front at Jester A203A (tentative) on 6:30 on Thursday, to talk about the concrete steps necessary in building power on campus as working-class students to create a better world and defend each other from the threat of fascism.\u201d \\nThe Revolutionary Student Front supports the Red Guards Austin, according to this post: Red Guard Austin are friends with the Revolutionary Student Front \u2013 Austin \\nThe Red Guard Austin\u2019s cover photo on Facebook: Red Guards Austin Facebook photo \\nThe Revolutionarfy Student Front gives tips to protesters who are \u201cnew to protests that are more on the disruptive and confrontational side,\u201d such as writing the phone number of the National Lawyers Guild on the protester\u2019s arm before the protest. Not surprisingly, the communist agitators do not discourage violence. \\nWatch a local CBS affiliate report (mildly) on the arrest: \\nThe same communist organization attacked Alex Jones during a pro-life rally in May, 2015. \\nWatch the video here: \\nIt is highly unusual for a local news report to identify \u201cactivists\u201d as members of communist groups, although the majority (if not all) of the recent anti-Trump protests are indeed organized by communists. \\nREAD MORE:\""}, "time": 1742628466.7774754}
