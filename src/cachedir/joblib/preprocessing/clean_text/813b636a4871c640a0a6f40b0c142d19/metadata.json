We\u2019re all looking for the same thing. We\u2019re looking for greatness for our country. We\u2019re looking for religious liberty,\u201d the Manhattan billionaire said before the rubber Trump mask caught his eye. \u201cLook at this mask. Look at this mask. Oh wow. Wow, that\u2019s beautiful. Look at that. Looks just like me.\u201d \\nTrump then left the podium for a few seconds as the mask made its way up to the stage. He returned to the microphone and held up the mask next to his own face, before examining it closer. He held it up once more time and joked \u201cnice head of hair, I\u2019ll say that,\u201d before tossing it back. \\n\u201cIs there any place more fun to be than a Trump rally?\u201d has asked the crowd before resuming his remarks, turning to his proposal to stimulate job growth in the U.S. by placing a tariff on companies who move production out of the country. \\nThe Sarasota, Florida, rally is the first of five for Trump on Monday. From Florida, he will head to events in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Michigan. He will be joined at the final two by his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence.'"}, "time": 1742562589.4395375}
