And it should be consistent with the nation\u2019s guiding principles, as well as internally consistent \u2013 meaning that the components of the foreign policy don\u2019t conflict with each other. \\nVia TruthAndAction \\n\\nIt should be affordable, and recognize the nation\u2019s strengths and weaknesses. None of this requires a genius to figure out. In other words, a proper foreign policy is exactly what we do not have in the United States. It\u2019s difficult to imagine a more stupid foreign policy than one of using NATO to provoke Russia.\\nScroll Down Below For Video NATO should have been disbanded when the Soviet empire fell. Of course, ending a government program, regardless of how useless or detrimental it is, is all but impossible. The Obama Administration\u2019s foreign policy in Eastern Europe is one of lunacy as NATO and Russia appear to be preparing for war.\\nNobody should admire cowardice. But recklessness needs to be condemned as well. When a nation engages others to assist it in taking rash and provocative actions, it needs to be called out for the danger it is. The military buildup in Eastern Europe, largely sponsored by the Obama Administration, supported by Hillary Clinton, and conducted through NATO, has the potential to trigger the unthinkable.\\nA key Russian defence figure says the deployment of US Marines at V\u00e6rnes is part of a US buildup to go on a \u201cglobal blitz\u201d and warned that Norway may make itself a target for a potential nuclear attack. Frants Klintsevitsj, a deputy chairman of Russia\u2019s defence and security committee, told TV2 that Russia views the presence of 330 Marines in Norway as a direct military threat that demands a reaction. Klintsevitsj, considered one of Russia\u2019s most influential defence politicians, said that Norway may now be added to \u201cthe list of targets for our strategic weapons\u201d.

He should be.\\nRussia has on several occasions criticized the plans to deploy 330 US troops at V\u00e6rnes. Norway\u2019s defence minister, Ine Eriksen S\u00f8reide, has rejected those criticisms and insisted that the deployment does not constitute a US military base but is rather a test run that will be evaluated during 2017.\\n\u201cThere is no objective reason for the Russians to react to this. But the Russians are reacting at the moment in the same way toward almost everything the Nato countries are doing,\u201d S\u00f8reide said.\\nNow a bit of history to put this into context.\\nBefore joining Nato in 1949, Norway allayed Russian fears by pledging not to open its territory to foreign combat troops so long as Norway was not attacked or threatened with attack.\\nSomething changed.\\nThe perspective of this article may appear to be pro-Russia, but the truth is that the intention is to be neither pro-Russia, nor anti-Russia, but pro-US. It\u2019s difficult to see how an Obama Administration sponsored military build-up on Russia\u2019s western border is pro-US. Using NATO as a cover doesn\u2019t help or give it legitimacy. It just drags other countries into a potential nuclear conflict with Russia. And for what?\\n'"}, "time": 1742563105.953279}
