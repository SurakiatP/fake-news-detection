Leaves have multiple beneficial purposes in the yard and garden. Don\u2019t miss out on this sustainable garden treat! \\n\\nCompost \\n\\nLeaves are the perfect carbon ingredient for your compost pile. Layer dead leaves in between all the green garden debris you find as you gather as you clean up the garden and prep it for winter. If you shred the leaves first, they will decompose even faster. You don\u2019t even need a compost pile or bin! There are many town and city waste disposal sites that will gladly compost your leaves for you and put the final product out for residents. \\n\\nLeaf Mold \\n\\nIf you have a lot of dead leaves, leaf mold is a great option. It does miraculous things to your garden! It is a crumbly, compost-like product that remains when leaves are left to decompose on their own. \\n\\nLeaf mold improves soil structure, which greatly improves the soil\u2019s water holding capability. It also attracts beneficial organisms who are important in maintaining healthy soil. \\n\\nAll you have to do is rake up your leaves into a pile and let them rot. So easy! The more compact the pile, the faster your leaves will decompose. You can also contain your leaves in a bin or any other composting contraption. \\n\\nMulch \\n\\nLeaves make an excellent attractive mulch, suppressing weeds and eventually decomposing and feeding the soil. When using leaves for mulch, it is a good idea to shred them first. Placing a thick layer of wet leaves over you garden soil will block water and air from getting through the soil which isn\u2019t what you want. Yet when shredded, the leaves will form an airy cushion that slowly settles in and settles down. This makes perfect mulch! \\n\\nIf you live in an area that gets windy in the fall, hose your leaves down when you first shred them. This will help them stay in place. \\n\\nAmend Your Soil \\n\\nAdd your leaves directly into your soil. Soil is constantly in flux and you can never have enough soil amendments. Leaves make a great alternative to buying bags of manure. It\u2019s a lot cheaper too! \\n\\nShred the leaves first and either turn them into the top few inches of soil or simply spread a layer of leaves on top of the soil and chop them a bit with a fork or spade. Be sure they are making good contact with the soil and watch nature work its wonders! \\n\\nThe leaves will disintegrate and create a great habitat for earthworms and other beneficial organisms that reside in your garden soil. \\n\\nInsulation \\n\\nLeaves can be used to insulate tender plants and even cold storage vegetables. Circle your plants or planted containers with wire fencing and stuff leaves around your plant. In the spring, rake them up and toss them in the compost. Double use! \\n\\nIf you have a root cellar or storage basement, use dry leaves to layer your vegetables in, instead of saw dust or newspaper. This will help your veggies easily last through the winter.'"}, "time": 1742563403.472657}
