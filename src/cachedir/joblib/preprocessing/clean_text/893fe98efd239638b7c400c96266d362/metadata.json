For the next seven years she was held hostage by the rebels, forced to become a child soldier. Her family thought she had died in battle. Then M\u00e9lida suddenly returned to her village at 16, carrying a pistol and a grenade. Only her grandfather recognized her  \u2014   from a birthmark on her cheek. The very next day, the military surrounded her house, called by an informant seeking the bounty on her head. \u201cI found out my own father had turned me in,\u201d she recalled. Colombia is nearing a peace agreement with the rebels to end a   of fighting, one of the longest conflicts in the world. More than 220, 000 people have been killed, leaving a country bitterly divided over what role, if any, former rebels should play in society once they drop their weapons for a new, unarmed life outside the jungle. That includes thousands of rebel fighters who were raised since childhood to carry out armed struggle. Many of them know little else but war. \u201cThere are times when I think about returning to the guerrillas because this life is hard here,\u201d said M\u00e9lida, now 20, who, like other former child soldiers, asked that her last name not be used because she fears reprisals over her links to the rebels. She is now caught between two worlds, she says, belonging to neither. \u201cTrue, we were children waiting for our deaths. But I\u2019m always thinking about returning. \u201d The rebels, known as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, say they don\u2019t recruit children. Yet during a recent visit to a FARC camp by The New York Times, a   soldiers as young as 15 said they had been recruited by the rebels only months earlier. In government rehabilitation centers throughout Colombia, minors told similar stories of being spirited away to camps by rebels. Now they face a future for which they are thoroughly unprepared. Fabio said he was kidnapped by rebel fighters at the age of 9. By the time he was 13, he said, his commanders began sending him on solo missions to slit the throats of government soldiers as they slept. He said his own family did not look for him or inform the authorities of his abduction. \u201cThey would have been killed,\u201d said Fabio, who is now 19. Freddy said he joined the FARC at 14 to avenge the killing of a cousin by paramilitary forces. He deserted at 16 with two dozen other soldiers. But he said his aunt, fearing reprisals from the guerrillas, told him never to return to his village. Finding a place for these former soldiers is vital to the success of any peace deal, analysts say. \u201cIf poor or botched reintegration programs fail to offer opportunities to former child combatants, Colombia\u2019s powerful paramilitaries and trafficking groups may offer them a tempting alternative,\u201d said Adam Isacson, a senior analyst at the Washington Office on Latin America, a human rights group. At the rebel camp, one FARC commander, who goes by the name Te\u00f3filo Panclasta, defended the use of child soldiers, saying that many joined to escape trouble at home. \u201cIf a girl comes at 15 as a prostitute and wants to join us to stop being a whore, what are we going to say?\u201d he asked. M\u00e9lida said that when her captors came to her house along the river, they drew her attention by saying they had soup in their canoe. The guerrillas brought her up the river until they reached a distant camp. She woke up alongside several other children, each around 10 or 11. Their first lesson was hiding in trenches during bombings by the military. M\u00e9lida\u2019s father, Mois\u00e9s, a traditional healer of the Amazon\u2019s Cubeo group, was away at the time and did not return to their village for another month. He quickly left again to find the girl. Mois\u00e9s went to the guerrilla camp near the village and asked to meet the commander, a tall FARC fighter in fatigues. \u201cI said, \u2018I came for my daughter,\u2019 \u201d Mois\u00e9s recalled. \u201cHe said she wasn\u2019t there. \u201d In the camp, M\u00e9lida had been renamed Marisol and began her schooling. A Dutch woman who had joined the fighters and spoke broken Spanish taught lessons on the history of communism, the FARC and Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution, something M\u00e9lida had never learned in her indigenous village. M\u00e9lida was also learning to make land mines. One \u201clooked like a fish\u201d and was triggered with a tripwire made of string, she said. Another was called the \u201cquiebrapatas,\u201d or the \u201c\u201d because it maimed rather than killed its victim. \u201cI said, \u2018I want to go home,\u2019 \u201d she remembered saying. \u201cBut they told me, \u2018Once you enter a camp, you cannot leave.\u2019 \u201d M\u00e9lida said she saw the fate of runaway fighters firsthand. Once, a    and his    sister disappeared before dawn and soon found themselves trapped on the edge of a muddy river. They had not learned to swim. M\u00e9lida joined the search for them. When the pair were found, they were shot dead. \u201cFirst the brother, then the sister,\u201d M\u00e9lida recalled. She remembered feeling no remorse that day. \u201cI said to myself, \u2018Yes  \u2014   yes they should be killed.\u2019 \u201d She was 12 years old. Years after she was kidnapped, FARC rebels passed through her village and mentioned M\u00e9lida to her family. \u201cThey said she had died in an attack,\u201d her father recalled. \u201cAfter that, I just forgot about her. I thought it was best to forget. \u201d In reality, a commander in his 40s had taken an interest in her. At first, he followed her around the camp. Then one day, when she was 15, he asked her to wash his clothes in his tent. \u201cGive me a kiss,\u201d she recalled him saying. \u201cI don\u2019t know how,\u201d she said. \u201cThen I\u2019ll teach you,\u201d the commander said. She was later given a birth control implant in her arm and the commander forced her into a relationship, she said. \u201cImagine waking up next to someone who was that old when you are that young,\u201d she said. At 16, she asked the commander if she could visit her family. She was surprised when he agreed. Carrying the pistol and the grenade, she made her way back home for what was meant to be a short reunion. The village was unrecognizable. A warship was now stationed near the dock. The home from which she had been abducted was abandoned. \u201cI told the first person I saw that I was Mr. Mois\u00e9s\u2019 daughter, and they said I couldn\u2019t be because that daughter was dead,\u201d she said. M\u00e9lida says she does not know why her father turned her in to the military the next day. \u201cHe wanted me not to go back perhaps,\u201d she said. \u201cHe wanted the best for me. \u201d But Mois\u00e9s, sitting in his daughter\u2019s living room on a recent afternoon, offered another explanation. \u201cI wanted to buy a motorcycle,\u201d he said. After a moment he added, \u201cThey never gave me the reward I was promised. \u201d The soldiers interrogated M\u00e9lida at one base after another, she said. What was her real name, they asked? Who were her commanders? Where were the FARC bases? After two weeks, M\u00e9lida was taken to a government rehabilitation center for indigenous youth who had left the FARC. It was on a mountainside in an alien part of the country for M\u00e9lida, who had never seen the Andes before she was captured. The center was home to about 20 other former child soldiers. Daily classes and chores, meant to adjust them to civilian life, were new to her. Other requirements, like another birth control implant, reminded her of the FARC. War was constantly on M\u00e9lida\u2019s mind. \u201cWhen I would get up, I would reach beside me to take my rifle and realize there wasn\u2019t one there,\u201d she said. V\u00edctor Hugo Ochoa, the center\u2019s director, said M\u00e9lida arrived angry and often threatened to run away. \u201cIt was hard to intervene,\u201d he said. \u201cShe formed her own constellation of kids who turned on us. \u201d At night, M\u00e9lida began sneaking out of the center with a man named Javier, whose mother was a cook there. He was nine years older than M\u00e9lida, but the two would go out drinking and partying in a nearby town. Javier had a bad history with the rebels. In 2004, his brother, a soldier, was killed by a FARC sniper. His family never forgave the guerrillas, a tension at the heart of any peace deal. Despite this, M\u00e9lida and Javier realized they were falling in love. \u201cWhy did it have to be her?\u201d he said. \u201cFrom the people who killed my brother?\u201d M\u00e9lida was forming another relationship  \u2014   with her father, who began visiting to get to know her again. After turning M\u00e9lida in, Mois\u00e9s now wanted a role in his daughter\u2019s life. But even communicating was a challenge: M\u00e9lida had lost some of her fluency in Cubeo, the indigenous language they had spoken when she was a child. \u201cShe was just some young lady I didn\u2019t know,\u201d he said. The new ties were changing her, Mr. Ochoa said. She was getting to know her two cousins, Mar\u00eda and Leila, themselves former FARC members who had left the center. Javier\u2019s mother, Dora, was teaching M\u00e9lida to cook and clean, taking on a mother\u2019s role. Dora took M\u00e9lida\u2019s FARC history in stride. \u201cMy daughter is married to a policeman another is with a soldier,\u201d she said. \u201cJavier is with an  . The only thing we\u2019re missing in this family is a paramilitary. \u201d One day M\u00e9lida\u2019s birth control implant failed and she became pregnant. Dora pulled M\u00e9lida aside. \u201cI told her, \u2018Now you have something to fight for that\u2019s not the revolution.\u2019 \u201d Her daughter, Celeste, was born last year. The daily tasks of motherhood consumed M\u00e9lida for weeks. But the anger remained. \u201cShe told me she was raised for war, not to care, not to be a lover,\u201d Javier said. \u201cShe would tell me, \u2018I love you, but understand my life hasn\u2019t been easy.\u2019 \u201d One day, Javier returned to find that M\u00e9lida and the baby were gone. Days before, M\u00e9lida had mentioned returning to rebel territory to see her sister, but now Javier thought it was a ruse to return to the FARC fold. It wasn\u2019t the case. Instead, her bus had been stopped at a checkpoint by rebels who questioned each of the passengers. \u201cI thought they would catch me again,\u201d said M\u00e9lida, who realized then she did not want to go back, at least not that day. M\u00e9lida\u2019s relationship with her father remains strained. They rarely talk about her life in rebel hands. On a recent day, M\u00e9lida was recovering from a blow to her face. \u201cShe started to argue with me and I hit her,\u201d said Mois\u00e9s, looking at the ground. Recently, M\u00e9lida\u2019s cousin Leila, the former FARC member, committed suicide. M\u00e9lida sometimes travels to visit the unmarked grave. Dora says M\u00e9lida is too strong to take her own life. But she worries M\u00e9lida might return to the guerrillas. \u201cShe is a good mother and puts her daughter first,\u201d Dora said. \u201cBut she also tells me she is bored and doesn\u2019t like this life. And I tell her: \u2018If you want to leave, then leave. But think of the girl. Leave Celeste with me.\u2019 \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562666.9127896}
