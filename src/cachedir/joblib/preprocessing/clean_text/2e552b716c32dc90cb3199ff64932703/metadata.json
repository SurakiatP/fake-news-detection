That\u2019s what it takes for Alonzo Adams and his wife, Ronica, to make ends meet, and that\u2019s without any money left for retirement savings. But they are raising their children in a neighborhood they like better, a few miles up the road in Florissant, Mo. Their children, they have concluded, are a product of their environment. So what must the couple give up now to give their children a better future? \u201cI give up the ability to have a better later,\u201d Alonzo said. Every one of us makes money   nearly every day, whether we realize it or not. Residence over retirement. Later over now. Needs over wants. Faith over financial facts. But all too often these   are subconscious, which means we don\u2019t discuss them openly and fail to question them relentlessly. \u201cIt\u2019s like money is just this big blob,\u201d said Sallie Krawcheck, a   and chief executive of Ellevest, an online investment service for women that tries to make these   visible. \u201cPeople think about it conceptually and not in terms of wanting to start a business, retire well, buy a house or have a baby. \u201d The blob, she concluded when she was starting her business, needed clearing up. \u201cThis is not money to get more money,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s money to do these things. Help me figure out what I can afford and when and what the   are to getting there. \u201d The people you\u2019ll encounter in this section have been sorting it out for themselves for some time now. Their household income is at or close to the median in their area. Meeting the most basic of needs is usually not a problem, but it\u2019s a challenge to figure out how often to allow themselves things they want and to weigh those desires against longstanding debt or the contributions they probably ought to make to their futures. Below are some of the most common   that they  \u2014   and all of us  \u2014   face most often. In January 2010, Jordan Hightower\u2019s younger sister, Molly, was killed in an earthquake while volunteering in Haiti. Jordan soon resolved that she would end her \u201cone day\u201d saving mentality and focus on today. That meant travel, to a dozen bachelorette parties around the United States and to 23 countries around the world in the last seven years. While she\u2019s traveled on a hostel budget and managed $4, 000 in annual retirement savings, her down payment savings have suffered, even as prices for starter homes in Tacoma, Wash. have risen. Jordan, 31, has no regrets, though. A wedding and kids are on the horizon in the next few years, and she plans to adjust her house savings accordingly now that she\u2019s been able to see and do so much. \u201cI\u2019m not worried or sad about changing those things,\u201d she said. Martin and Raquel Vergara met as rivals, operating neighboring mall kiosks. She eventually became a personal banker, while he is a mixed martial arts fighter and a personal trainer. Now that they\u2019re the parents of two small children, Raquel, 26, has hit the pause button on her career to care for the kids. They don\u2019t want to miss too much time with them, wondering if their hours with their children will add up to more than those of   providers. \u201cWe are investing time in our kids,\u201d said Martin, who is 25. \u201cThat means more than money. \u201d Even single parents make similar decisions if they possibly can, and some believe it\u2019s necessary. Natalie Davis was 31 and pregnant when her husband died unexpectedly five years ago. Now, she has a    boy and a    girl. She\u2019s also no longer a   executive, even though she ran up some   debt and sacrificed savings after her decision to work less. For her, the choice wasn\u2019t a close call. \u201cThey needed it,\u201d she said, even though her husband did not have life insurance. Being with her children more often also helped clarify what counted as a mere want when it came to the family budget. \u201cSometimes my son will really want something and I used to feel guilty, being that he doesn\u2019t have his dad,\u201d she said. \u201cI used to do everything I could to get him what he wants, and now I don\u2019t stress on that anymore. \u201d Chris and Tanya Brashers have faced health problems, landlord problems and employment problems. Both have declared personal bankruptcy. Soon, they will move from Bryan, Ark. to Fairhope, Ala. They are both veterans, and they are crossing their fingers that the optimistic new postal address will bring new career opportunities for Chris, who is 46. He trained as an engineer, but his passion is photography, and his research suggests that he will be able to get freelance work there. While the couple is in debt, Tanya, who is 41, professes a certain serenity about their circumstances given all they have experienced. \u201cI\u2019ve learned not to depend on money for your happiness,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, living as simply as we do, I\u2019m kind of at peace. \u201d Alonzo, 46, the minister with multiple other jobs, works 65 to 70 hours each week so his children can grow up in a safe neighborhood. The family has a security system, but they sometimes forget to turn it on and then leave the doors unlocked. Nobody comes in. \u201cWould I be that comfortable in another neighborhood?\u201d he said. \u201cThe neighborhood where I grew up in? Nope. \u201d So the family has physical security, paying now so that the kids can have a better later, as Alonzo puts it. But hanging over that   is another one that he said so many   families face. \u201cWhat can I leave for them?\u201d he wondered. \u201cMost black people leave their families a bill when they die, not a legacy. Not an estate. We don\u2019t have estates. The only thing we know about estates is when we see the sign for estate sales, and we get happy because this is a real big garage sale. \u201d All joking aside, Alonzo doesn\u2019t need to look far to see where a lack of retirement savings can get you, given that his father is still a pastor at the church as well. Black preachers just die, he said. They don\u2019t retire. Still, at least his choice is deliberate: Trade a better later for himself for a better later for his children. It\u2019s the same   parents have made for centuries, and it\u2019s a swap that many parents continue to make without much hesitation.
