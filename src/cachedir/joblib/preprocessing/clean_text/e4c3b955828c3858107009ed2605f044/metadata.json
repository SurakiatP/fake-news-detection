His family issued a statement rejecting the verdict and claiming that Mr. Adam was tortured into confessing, The Times reported. \\nThe steel cable worker said he had only signed a document admitting the offences after being repeatedly beaten. He said he had been accused of \u201csending texts\u201d when he was too poor to own a mobile phone. \\nForty-seven protesters and alleged supporters of al-Qaeda were executed in a single day in January. In July, the number of beheadings in Saudi Arabia reached 108 this year, putting the country, which has a population of nearly 29 million people, on track to exceed its 2015 execution total. \\nSaudi Arabia is one of the world\u2019s most prolific executioners. Research last year by human rights organisation Reprieve found that, of those identified as facing execution in Saudi Arabia, some 72 per cent were sentenced to death for non-violent alleged crimes, while torture and forced confessions were common. \\n\u201cMunir Adam\u2019s appalling case illustrates how the Saudi authorities are all too happy to subject the most vulnerable people to the swordsman\u2019s blade,\u201d said Maya Foa, of Reprieve. \u201cSaudi Arabia\u2019s close allies, including the UK, must urge the kingdom to release Munir, along with juveniles and others who were sentenced to death for protesting.\u201d \\nThe traditionally close relationship between Saudi Arabia and Britain has become strained in the past year as people in the West have protested against the use of the death penalty, including against minors. Protests also erupted across the Middle East in January. \\nSara Hashah, Amnesty International\u2019s Middle East and North Africa spokesperson, said Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Iran were responsible for 90 per cent of all recorded executions globally and were out of step with the rest of the world . \\n\u201cIn Saudi Arabia, where people are routinely sentenced to death after grossly unfair trials, we have seen a dramatic surge in the number of executions in the past two years which has shown no sign of abating in 2016,\u201d she told The Independent in July. \\n\u201cThis clearly demonstrates that Saudi Arabia\u2019s authorities are increasingly out of step with a global trend of states moving away from the death penalty. \u201cSaudi Arabia\u2019s authorities must end their reliance on this cruel, inhuman and degrading form of punishment immediately.\u201d \\nMr. Adam was reportedly detained in February 2012 for taking part in protests in his home town of Qatif the previous year, when he was 18 years old. \\nRead the rest of the story here . \\nDCG'"}, "time": 1742562227.9527614}
