I can make stuff up, but that won\u2019t go over very well.\u201d \\nFrom similar comments over time, I\u2019ve made perhaps ten requests for this person to summarize war law in a sentence or two. So far, I\u2019ve received only dodges avoiding this easy and essential citizen responsibility. This said, this isn\u2019t the only individual who can\u2019t summarize war law, and see that it\u2019s meant to be as clear as: \u201cstop sign\u201d law for driving, a baseball rule, like the strike zone, a chore for one\u2019s child at home, like taking out the trash. \\nLet\u2019s look at these three examples compared to this comment, then review war law to see that its violation by US .01% \u201cleaders\u201d is as outrageous as one can imagine, not even close to legal, started on lies known to be false as they were told, and requiring immediate arrests to stop an obvious crime war-murdering millions, harming billions, and looting trillions. \\nTo give you the punch line now for clarity of what war law states , and without disagreement our colleagues and I are aware of from anyone who points to the law with explanation: \\nUnless a nation can justify its military use as self-defense from armed attack from a nation\u2019s government that is \u201cinstant, overwhelming, and leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation,\u201d all other acts of war are unlawful. The legal definition of \u201cself-defense\u201d ends when the attack terminates. In general legal definition , no party is allowed use of force under the justification of \u201cself-defense\u201d if the law can be applied for redress and remedy. \\nThis is the same as if you\u2019re walking down the street: nobody can attack you unless, and only unless, you attack first or are an imminent threat (pulling a knife and raving, etc.). And if you are attacked, once law enforcement takes the case any attack on your part is the crime of retribution fully prosecuted against you. Example 1: Stop sign law: \\nIn general, law is meant to be crystal-clear so as to help produce a desired result. Traffic law is meant to make driving as safe and efficient as possible, with California stop sign law as a perfect example: \\n\u201cAn 8-sided red STOP sign indicates that you must make a full \u201cSTOP\u201d whenever you see this sign. Stop at the white limit line (a wide white line painted on the street) or before entering the crosswalk. If a limit line or crosswalk is not painted on the street, stop before entering the intersection. Check traffic in all directions before proceeding.\u201d \\nThere\u2019s more that could be said about this law, but this is enough as we all have personal experience of what this law means. \\nNow imagine this scenario: \\nIn your residential neighborhood with a 25 mph speed limit, you have a stop sign one house away. Your child attends the elementary school down the street, and you know that children have been hit by cars on this street. One day you observe at 7 AM a red Toyota truck speed through that stop sign ~40 mph, and at 5 PM he speeds through the other way. As you watch, horrified this has happened twice, you see your next-door neighbor has also observed this. You walk over: \\nYou: Did you see that?! I saw that same truck do that this morning; just blow by that stop sign, and speeding! \\nNeighbor: Yeah. I\u2019ve seen it the last three weekdays, morning and evening. Same truck, same driver, same speed, never even slows down. \\nYou: Have you called the police? Let\u2019s stop this! \\nNeighbor: While I can say it strongly appears this driver is in violation of the law and therefore likely illegal, there is no way for myself to make that a legally binding finding and attach legal demands based upon it. I can make stuff up, but that won\u2019t go over very well. \\nYou: Are you joking? \\nNeighbor: No. I take neighborhood safely seriously. Because he\u2019s seen me, he threw this note at me yesterday. Well, it was attached to a brick that missed me and went through my windshield. But anyway, this is what the note says: \\n\u201cMy driving is legal because: I have white decals on my vehicle , and have extra driving privileges. My wife is pregnant. Emergencies change everything. I must use emergency \u201cenhanced driving techniques.\u201d It\u2019s pretty well confirmed you\u2019re in communication with Al-Qaeda terrorists, so I\u2019m acting in legal self-defense before you attack again.\u201d \\nYou: Dude. \\nNeighbor: What? While I can say it strongly appears this driver is in violation of the law and therefore likely illegal, there is no way for myself to make that a legally binding finding and attach legal demands based upon it. I can make stuff up, but that won\u2019t go over very well. \\nYou: Ok, let\u2019s look. First: his truck doesn\u2019t have those white stickers, plus it\u2019s irrelevant for speeding through a stop sign. Second: if he drives like this every day AND both ways that has nothing to do with a pregnant wife. And the last one, seriously, are you going to take that shit that you\u2019re the cause of his speeding because you\u2019re some evil terrorist?! \\n** \\nI could go on, but you get the points about this neighbor within the limits of an analogy: No demonstrated understanding of this law. Need of greater voice for responsible citizenship. Example 2: baseball\u2019s strike zone \\nScenario: You attend your son\u2019s high school baseball game with about 100 other adults and students in your team\u2019s stands. Your same neighbor is at the game with you, with his son at bat. The pitcher delivers a pitch ten feet over everyone\u2019s head to the backstop. The umpire calls, \u201cStrike one!\u201d You, in shock, attempt to ask your neighbor if you heard correctly. As you begin talking, the pitcher\u2019s second pitch is tossed to their team\u2019s manager in the dugout: \\nUmpire: Strike two! \\nYou: This game is rigged! \\nNeighbor: While I can say it strongly appears those pitches are outside the strike zone and therefore likely balls, there is no way for myself to make that a binding finding and attach demands based upon it. I can make stuff up, but that won\u2019t go over very well. \\nYou: Dude! The first one was over everyone\u2019s heads by 10 feet! The second is a joke! \\n(as we talk, the pitcher delivers the third pitch: rolling it to the third baseman and smirking at the \u201cumpire\u201d calling, \u201cStrike three!\u201d) \\nNeighbor: (loudly encouraging to son) Next time, next time, son! You\u2019ll have to swing at one of those to have a chance! \\n** \\nLet\u2019s do some analysis: Again, your neighbor shows no understanding of the law. Your neighbor is at risk of being a sucker to whatever consequences might come from such ignorance. \\nOf course, because Americans take sports law s seriously (and here ), many of the 100 fans would be on the field to stop the game after the second pitch, and would never ever ever ever allow a game they cared about to be destroyed by Orwellian \u201cumpires.\u201d Example 3: taking out the trash \\nScenario: Your son has a chore to take out the trash before he goes to bed each night. One morning before school, you notice the trash wasn\u2019t taken out last night. Your son comes downstairs. \\nYou: Son, you didn\u2019t take out the trash last night. \\nSon: C\u2019mon Dad: while you can say it strongly appears the trash is in violation of the agreement and therefore likely illegal, there is no way for you to make that a binding finding and attach demands based upon it. You can make stuff up, but that won\u2019t go over very well. \\nYou: (blinking twice, indicating with body language that your son now has your full attention) \\nSon: (recognizing this bullshit isn\u2019t working, clears his throat) Besides, taking the trash out is a relative term. If it\u2019s out , then relative to that location, inside the house is outside of that domain. If the trash is in , it\u2019s already outside the domain of out ! \\n(placing his hand in mock sincerity upon my shoulder) Dad, America needs clear laws and enforceable laws, not the arbitrary stop you\u2019re making of my morning in lawless arbitrary demand. It\u2019s up to our household legislation to plug loopholes; it\u2019s the duty of the family to understand what needs to be done and demand it. \\nFair laws, clear laws, enforceable laws. \\nDon\u2019t be a preening weenie, Dad. \\nYou: You\u2019re joking, right? \\nSon: Not at all. I take household responsibilities very seriously. Very seriously. \\nYou: (pursing lips and nodding) Anything else you\u2019d like to add to your explanation? \\nSon: Yes. The rule states that the trash go out before I \u201cgo to bed.\u201d I never went to bed last night. I had a \u201ctemporary emergency bailout of consciousness\u201d distinct from \u201cgoing to bed.\u201d So, technically, I won\u2019t be in violation until I actually \u201cgo to bed.\u201d And this state of emergency might need to be continued indefinitely. Oh, and I still stand on my point that given the ambiguity of the rule with in and out , neither one of us can determine any violation of law. \\nYou: Son, laws are meant to be clear; this one is. Your first excuse has to destroy known and agreed terms of in and out to pretend the law is unclear. Your second excuse again destroys a definition of an essential part of the law, then, as the first excuse, attempts to bullshit your way to willfully destroy clear law. This bullshit includes rhetoric of caring about responsibility, a need for clear laws, and justice. \\nThe law is simple: (pointing to trash) That is inside the house. It needs to go outside to the trash container (pointing) every night. Nobody is confused by this. \\nHow did you get this wild idea? \\nSon: (snapping out of his experiment with psychopathy): My baseball teammate and neighbor uses it on his dad all the time. He says it works. Thanks for not being played, Dad. That\u2019s the type of man I want to be! War law is as clear as our three examples: \\nWar law is just as easy to understand as \u201cstop sign law,\u201d and far easier than most sports laws, such as when a football punt is or is not legal, or baseball\u2019s \u201cinfield fly\u201d rule. Because everyday people care enough to know traffic law and sports rules , the idea of knowing war law can be accomplished by refreshing what you\u2019ve already learned by reading this article (and confirming its accuracy as needed). \\nWar law, as we\u2019re about to document and prove, is clear and helpful for the outcome of denying military armed attack as a foreign policy. This is an outcome 95%+ of humanity agree is desirable, especially after all our families\u2019 awful sacrifices through two world wars. \\nConversely, war-mongers for empire will do their best to be silent about war law, lie that it\u2019s so unclear that any dictatorial claim of \u201cself-defense\u201d is valid, and take every evasive maneuver imaginable for the public (especially military and law enforcement) to never understand war law and/or never recognize how US wars are Orwellian unlawful. \\nAgain: what war law states , and without disagreement our colleagues and I are aware of from anyone who points to the law with explanation: \\nUnless a nation can justify its military use as self-defense from armed attack from a nation\u2019s government that is \u201cinstant, overwhelming, and leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation,\u201d all other acts of war are unlawful. The legal definition of \u201cself-defense\u201d ends when the attack terminates. In general legal definition , no party is allowed use of force under the justification of \u201cself-defense\u201d if the law can be applied for redress and remedy. \\nThat\u2019s the letter of the law. The intent is soooo strongly worded in both relevant treaties, as you\u2019ll see, and is simply to end the scourge of wars chosen by governments as foreign policy (in historical context of empires looting the world for resources: natural and human). \\nOur condition today is of OBVIOUSLY unlawful Wars of Aggression (and started with lies known to false as they were told ), as the facts to follow clearly demonstrate for anyone caring to look and apply basic high school-level of education already learned. \\nImportantly, Left and Right \u201cleaders\u201d and corporate media , including Clinton and Trump, will never ever ever ever ever remind us that war is illegal, with current wars in Orwellian opposition. \\nThe appropriate \u201cvote\u201d of We the People for this presidential election is \u201cNo\u201d for more illegal war, and \u201cYes\u201d to stop the wars and arrest those who orchestrated them. Without public demand, these illegal wars will only continue. \\nThe following is from my paper for the 2015 Claremont Colleges\u2019 conference, Seizing an Alternative Toward an Ecological Civilization reframed for our three specific points in this essay. Importantly, colleagues and I working on this topic are unaware of any refutation that the US wars are illegal. That is, we\u2019ve never encountered anyone in person or in writing who points to the law and argues: \u201cWar law means (a, b, c), so the US wars are legal because (d, e, f).\u201d If any reader has found any such argument, please share it with me. Accurately and confidently know the law \\nUnlawful Wars of Aggression: The US/UK/Israel \u201cofficial story\u201d is that current wars are lawful because they are \u201cself-defense.\u201d The Emperor\u2019s New Clothes fact here is that \u201cself-defense\u201d means something quite narrow and specific in war law, and US/UK/Israel armed attacks on so many nations in current and past wars are not even close to the definition of \u201cself-defense.\u201d \\nAddressing three nations and several wars again seems ambitious for one academic paper, and again, these are all simple variations of one method: Ignore war law. Lie to blame the victim and claim \u201cself-defense.\u201d \u201cOfficials\u201d and corporate media never state the Emperor\u2019s New Clothes simple and obvious facts of war law and war lies. \\nProving unlawful wars with massive deception is easier when the scope is broadened to see the same elements in three cases. \\nImportantly, a nation can use military, police, and civilians in self-defense from any attack upon the nation. This is similar to the legal definition of \u201cself-defense\u201d for you or I walking down the street: we cannot attack anyone unless either under attack or imminent threat. And, if under attack, we can use any reasonable force in self-defense, including lethal. \\nTwo world wars begat two treaties to end nations\u2019 armed attacks forever. They are crystal-clear in content and context: Kellogg-Briand Pact ( General treaty for renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy as official title) United Nations Charter . \\nBoth are listed in the US State Department\u2019s annual publication, Treaties in Force (2013 edition pages 466 and 493). \\nArticle Six of the US Constitution defines a treaty as US \u201csupreme Law of the Land;\u201d meaning that US policy may only complement an active treaty, and never violate it. \\nThis is important because all of us with Oaths to the US Constitution are sworn to honorably refuse all unlawful war orders; military officers are sworn to arrest those who issue them. Indeed, we suffer criminal dishonor if we obey orders for armed attack when they are not \u201cself-defense,\u201d and family dishonor to so easily reject the legal victory won from all our families\u2019 sacrifices through two world wars. \\nTreaty 1. Kellogg-Briand: General treaty for renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy : \\nThe legal term renounce means to surrender access; that is, to remove that which is renounced as lawful option. This active treaty (page 466 \u201cRenunciation of War\u201d), usually referenced as the Kellogg-Briand Pact , states: \\n\u201c ARTICLE I \\nThe High Contracting Parties solemly declare in the names of their respective peoples that they condemn recourse to war for the solution of international controversies, and renounce it, as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another. \\nARTICLE II \\nThe High Contracting Parties agree that the settlement or solution of all disputes or conflicts of whatever nature or of whatever origin they may be, which may arise among them, shall never be sought except by pacific means.\u201d \\nSo, in the most clear framing of a rule as possible, the first two parts of the treaty state \u201cnever war\u201d and \u201calways peace\u201d to resolve conflicts. \\nTreaty 2. United Nations Charter: \\nIt\u2019s helpful to understand what the UN is not. The only area of legal authority of the UN is security/use of force; all other areas are advise for individual nation\u2019s legislature\u2019s consideration. The UN is not global government. It is a global agreement to end wars of choice outside of a very narrow legal definition of national self-defense against another nation\u2019s armed attack. \\nThe preamble of the United Nations includes to \u201csave succeeding generations from the scourge of war\u2026 to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained, and\u2026 to ensure, by the acceptance of principles and the institution of methods, that armed force shall not be used\u2026\u201d \\nThe UN purpose includes: \u201cTo maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace\u2026\u201d \\nArticle 2: \\n3. All Members shall settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security, and justice, are not endangered. \\n4. All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations. \\n5. All Members shall give the United Nations every assistance in any action it takes in accordance with the present Charter\u2026 \\nArticle 24 : In order to ensure prompt and effective action by the United Nations, its Members confer on the Security Council primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, and agree that in carrying out its duties under this responsibility the Security Council acts on their behalf. \\nArticle 25: The Members of the United Nations agree to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council in accordance with the present Charter. \\nArticle 33 : The parties to any dispute, the continuance of which is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security, shall, first of all, seek a solution by negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, resort to regional agencies or arrangements, or other peaceful means of their own choice. The Security Council shall, when it deems necessary, call upon the parties to settle their dispute by such means. \\nArticle 37: Should the parties to a dispute of the nature referred to in Article 33 fail to settle it by the means indicated in that Article, they shall refer it to the Security Council. \\nArticle 39: The Security Council shall determine the existence of any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression and shall make recommendations, or decide what measures shall be taken in accordance with Articles 41 and 42, to maintain or restore international peace and security. \\nArticle 40: In order to prevent an aggravation of the situation, the Security Council may, before making the recommendations or deciding upon the measures provided for in Article 39, call upon the parties concerned to comply with such provisional measures as it deems necessary or desirable. \\nArticle 51: Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. \\nThe International Court of Justice (ICJ) is the judicial branch of the UN. Their definition of \u201carmed attack\u201d is by a nation\u2019s government. Because the leadership of the CIA and FBI both reported that they had no evidence the Afghan government had any role in the 9/11 terrorism, the US is unable to claim Article 51 protection for military action in Afghanistan (or Iraq , Syria , Ukraine , Iran [ here , here , here ], Russia , or claims about ISIS or Khorasans ). The legal classification of what happened on 9/11 is an act of terrorism, a criminal act, not an armed attack by another nation\u2019s government. \\nThe US use of force oversees could be a legal application of Article 51 if, and only if, the US could meet the burden of proof of an imminent threat that was not being responded to by the Security Council. To date, the US has not made such an argument. \\nAmerican Daniel Webster helped create the legal definition of national self-defense in the Caroline Affair as \u201cnecessity of that self-defence is instant, overwhelming, and leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation.\u201d The US attack on Afghanistan came nearly a month after the 9/11 terrorism. Article 51 only allows self-defense until the Security Council takes action; which they did in two Resolutions beginning the day after 9/11 ( 1368 and 1373 ) claiming jurisdiction in the matter. \\nIn conclusion, unless a nation can justify its military use as self-defense from armed attack from a nation\u2019s government that is \u201cinstant, overwhelming, and leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation,\u201d all other acts of war are unlawful. The legal definition of \u201cself-defense\u201d ends when the attack terminates. In general legal definition , no party is allowed use of force under the justification of \u201cself-defense\u201d if the law can be applied for redress and remedy. \\nAnother area to clarify is the US 1973 War Powers Act (WPA). The authorization by Congress for US presidential discretion for military action in Afghanistan and Iraq references WPA. This act, in response to the Vietnam War, reframes the Founders\u2019 intent of keeping the power of war in the hands of Congress. It also expressly limits the president to act within US treaty obligations; the principle treaty of use of war being the UN Charter. \\nThis means that presidential authority as commander-in-chief must always remain within the limitations of the UN Charter to be lawful orders. It\u2019s not enough for Congress to authorize use of force; that force must always and only be within the narrow legal definition of self-defense clearly explained in the UN Charter. Of course, we can anticipate that if a government wanted to engage in unlawful war today, they would construct their propaganda to sell the war as \u201cdefensive.\u201d The future of humanity to be safe from the scourge of war is therefore dependent upon our collective ability to discern lawful defensive wars from unlawful Wars of Aggression covered in BS \u2013 Emperor\u2019s New Clothes claims of self-defense. \\nThe most decorated US Marine general in his day warned all Americans of this fact of lie-started wars, and W. Bush\u2019s Senior Advisor and Deputy Chief of Staff, Karl Rove, chided Pulitzer-winning journalist, Ron Suskind, that government will continue with such actions to \u201ccreate our own reality\u201d no matter what anyone else might say. \\nThe first round of US current wars, the attack of Afghanistan on October 7, 2001, continues this history as a deliberate act of unlawful war, not defense that was \u201cinstant, overwhelming, and leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation.\u201d The burden of proof the US would have to provide is imminent threat of another attack in order to justify self-defense. US Ambassador to the UN, John Negroponte, in his letter to the UN Security Council invoking Article 51 for the attack upon Afghanistan mentions only \u201congoing threat;\u201d which does not satisfy this burden of proof. \\nArticle 51 requires self-defensive war coming from an attack by a nation\u2019s government, which the CIA and FBI refute in the case of the Afghan government with the terrorism on 9/11. Self-defense ends when the attack ends. The US war began four weeks after 9/11 ended; making the US war one of choice and not defense. Article 51 ends self-defense claims when the UN Security Council acts. Resolution 1373 provides clear language of international cooperation and justice under the law, with no authorization of force. \\nThis evidence doesn\u2019t require the light of the UN Charter\u2019s spirit of its laws, but I\u2019ll add it: humanity rejected war as a policy option and requires nations to cooperate for justice under that law. The US has instead embraced and still embraces war with its outcomes of death, misery, poverty, and fear expressly against the wishes of humanity and the majority of Americans. These acts are clearly unlawful and should be refused and stopped by all men and women in military, government and law enforcement. \\nSome war liars argue that UN Security Council Resolution 687 from 1991 authorizes resumption of force from the previous Gulf War. This resolution declared a formal cease-fire; which means exactly what it says: stop the use of force. The resolution was declared by UNSC and held in their jurisdiction; that is, no individual nation has authority to supersede UNSC\u2019s power to continue or change the status of the cease-fire. The idea that the US and/or UK can authorize use of force under a UNSC cease-fire is as criminal as your neighbor shooting one of your family members and claiming that because police have authority to shoot dangerous people he can do it. \\nThe categories of crime for armed attacks outside US treaty limits of law are: Wars of Aggression (the worst crime a nation can commit), Treason for lying to US military, ordering unlawful attack and invasions of foreign lands, and causing thousands of US military deaths. \\nAll 27 UK Foreign Affairs Department attorneys concluded Iraq war is unlawful: I wrote in 2010 : \\n\u201cAll the lawyers in the UK\u2019s Foreign Affairs Department concluded the US/UK invasion of Iraq was an unlawful War of Aggression. Their expert advice is the most qualified to make that legal determination; all 27 of them were in agreement . This powerful judgment of unlawful war follows the Dutch government\u2019s recent unanimous report and UN Secretary General Kofi Annan\u2019s clear statements . \\n\u201cThis stunning information was disclosed at the UK Chilcot inquiry by the testimony of Foreign Affairs leading legal advisor, Sir Michael Wood , who added that the reply from Prime Minister Tony Blair\u2019s office to his legal department\u2019s professional work was chastisement for putting their unanimous legal opinion in writing. \\n\u201c Sir Michael testified that Foreign Secretary Jack Straw preferred to take the legal position that the laws governing war were vague and open to broad interpretation: \u201cHe took the view that I was being very dogmatic and that international law was pretty vague and that he wasn\u2019t used to people taking such a firm position.\u201d \\n\u201cUK Attorney General Lord Goldsmith testified he \u201cchanged his mind\u201d against the unanimous legal opinion of all 27 of the Foreign Office attorneys to agree with the US legal argument that UN Security Council Resolution 1441 authorized use of force at the discretion of any nation\u2019s choice . This testimony is also criminally damning: arguing that an individual nation has the right to choose war violates the purpose, letter and spirit of the UN Charter, as well as violates 1441 that reaffirms jurisdiction of the Security Council in governance of the issue. This Orwellian argument contradicts the express purpose of the Charter to prevent individual nations from engaging in wars. \\n\u201cMoreover, the US and UK \u201clegal argument\u201d is in further Orwellian opposition to their UN Ambassadors\u2019 statements when 1441 was passed that this did not authorize any use of force: \\n\u201c John Negroponte , US Ambassador to the UN: \\n[T]his resolution contains no \u201chidden triggers\u201d and no \u201cautomaticity\u201d with respect to the use of force. If there is a further Iraqi breach, reported to the Council by UNMOVIC, the IAEA or a Member State, the matter will return to the Council for discussions as required in paragraph 12. \\n\u201c Sir Jeremy Greenstock , UK Ambassador to the UN: \\nWe heard loud and clear during the negotiations the concerns about \u201cautomaticity\u201d and \u201chidden triggers\u201d \u2014 the concern that on a decision so crucial we should not rush into military action; that on a decision so crucial any Iraqi violations should be discussed by the Council. Let me be equally clear in response\u2026 There is no \u201cautomaticity\u201d in this resolution. If there is a further Iraqi breach of its disarmament obligations, the matter will return to the Council for discussion as required in paragraph 12. \\n\u201cThe Chilcot inquiry was initiated from public outrage against UK participation in the Iraq War, with public opinion having to engage a second time to force hearings to become public rather than closed and secret. The hearings were not authorized to consider criminal charges, which is the next battle for UK public opinion.\u201d \\nThe UN Charter is the principle law to end wars; designed by the US to produce that result. That said, West Point Grads Against the War have further legal arguments of all the violations of war from US attack and invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, including further analysis of the UN Charter and expert supporting testimony. Another resource for documentation and analysis is David Swanson\u2019s War is a Crime . Ironically, Americans would never allow a favorite sport such as baseball or football to be similarly destroyed by such Emperor\u2019s New Clothes lies to those rules/laws. \\nLawful war analysis: Negroponte\u2019s letter invokes a legal Charter Article of self-defense in contrast with the loss of over 3,000 lives on 9/11. The letter portends legal evidence of al-Qaeda\u2019s \u201ccentral role\u201d in the attacks and claims military response is appropriate because of al-Qaeda\u2019s ongoing threat and continued training of terrorists. This reasoning argues for a reinterpretation of self-defense to include pre-emptive attack while lying in omission that such an argument is tacit agreement of current action being outside the law. \\nThe US Army\u2019s official law handbook provides an excellent historical and legal summary of when wars are lawful self-defense and unlawful War of Aggression in a seven-page Chapter One. \\nImportantly, after accurately defining \u201cself-defense\u201d in war, the JAG authors/attorneys explicitly state on page 6 that war is illegal unless a nation is under attack from another nation\u2019s government, or can provide evidence of imminent threat of such attack : \\n\u201cAnticipatory self-defense, whether labeled anticipatory or preemptive, must be distinguished from preventive self-defense. Preventive self-defense\u2014employed to counter non-imminent threats\u2014is illegal under international law .\u201d \\nHowever, despite the US Army\u2019s law handbook\u2019s accurate disclosure of the legal meaning of \u201cself-defense\u201d in war, they then ignore this meaning to claim \u201cself-defense\u201d as a lawful reason for US wars without further explanation ( details here ). \\nPresident George Washington\u2019s Farewell Address, the culmination of his 45 years of political experience, warned of the primary threat to America as \u201cthe impostures of pretended patriotism\u201d from people within our own government who would destroy Constitutional limits in order to obtain tyrannical power: \\n\u201cAll obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and associations, under whatever plausible character, with the real design to direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and action of the constituted authorities, are destructive of this fundamental principle, and of fatal tendency.\u201d \\nYoung Abraham Lincoln wrote eloquently to defend the US Constitution from unlawful tyrants within our own government . In Congress, he spoke powerfully and truthfully that the President\u2019s claims for armed attack and invasion of a foreign country were lies . Although war-mongers slurred Lincoln\u2019s name at the time, history proved him correct in asserting the President of the US was a war-mongering liar: \\n\u201cI carefully examined the President\u2019s messages, to ascertain what he himself had said and proved upon the point. The result of this examination was to make the impression, that taking for true, all the President states as facts, he falls far short of proving his justification; and that the President would have gone farther with his proof, if it had not been for the small matter, that the truth would not permit him\u2026 Now I propose to try to show, that the whole of this, \u2014 issue and evidence \u2014 is, from beginning to end, the sheerest deception.\u201d \\nLincoln also wrote that \u201cpre-emptive\u201d wars were lies, and \u201c war at pleasure .\u201d \\nThose of us working to end these illegal Wars of Aggression have found zero refutations of our documentation that address war law. All we\u2019ve ever found are denial and unsubstantiated claims of \u201cself-defense\u201d while having to lie about the legal limits in that term. \\nNote: other sections of that paper may be useful that just as clearly demonstrate Israel\u2019s illegal war on Gaza, criminally complicit corporate media to \u201ccover\u201d these crimes, all \u201creasons\u201d for these wars were known to be false as they were told, and the fundamental fraud of creating what is used for money as debt. Demand arrests of Left and Right .01% US \u201cleaders\u201d because the wars are not even close to lawful \\nTherefore, We the People have an obvious solution: lawful arrests of .01% \u201cleaders\u201d for the most egregious crimes centering in war and lies to start them. \\nThis is a 1st Amendment responsibility to maintain our constitutional republic under law rather than what we\u2019ve become with war: \u201cleaders\u201d dictating/saying what we can do completely removed from limitations of the law. Left and Right .01% \u201cleaders\u201d completely violate the rules, and only from public ignorance with corporate media propaganda. \\nThe categories of crime include: Wars of Aggression (the worst crime a nation can commit). Likely treason for lying to US military, ordering unlawful attack and invasions of foreign lands, and causing thousands of US military deaths. Crimes Against Humanity for ongoing intentional policy of poverty that\u2019s killed over 400 million human beings just since 1995 (~75% children; more deaths than from all wars in Earth\u2019s recorded history). Looting trillions , such as the Department of \u201cDefense\u201d claiming to have \u201clost\u201d $6.5 trillion. \\nUS military, law enforcement, responsible citizens, and all with Oaths to support and defend the US Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic, face an endgame choice: Demand arrests , with those with lawful authority to enact it. An arrest is the lawful action to stop apparent crimes , with the most serious crimes documented here meaning the most serious need for arrests. Watch the US escalate its rogue state crimes that annually kill millions, harm billions, and loot trillions. \\nHow military and law enforcement choose to honor their Oaths in creative adaptation to the rogue state is up to them. We the People can help with our educated voices in this Emperor\u2019s New Clothes environment whereby these crimes only persist from public ignorance. \\nIn just 90 seconds , former US Marine Ken O\u2019Keefe powerfully states how you may choose to voice \u201cvery obvious solutions\u201d: arrest the criminal leaders (video starts at 20:51, then finishes this episode of Cross Talk ): \\nOur condition requiring YOUR voice is what Benjamin Franklin predicted would be the eventual outcome of the United States. On September 18, 1787, just after signing the US Constitution, Ben met with members of the press. He was asked what kind of government America would have. Franklin warned: \u201cA republic, if you can keep it.\u201d In his speech to the Constitutional Convention, Franklin admonished: \\n\u201cThis [U.S. Constitution] is likely to be administered for a course of years and then end in despotism\u2026 when the people shall become so corrupted as to need despotic government, being incapable of any other.\u201d \u2013 The Quotable Founding Fathers , pg. 39. \\nThese warnings extend to all social science teachers of the present: \\n\u201cAs educators in the field of history\u2013social science, we want our students to\u2026 understand the value, the importance, and the fragility of democratic institutions. We want them to realize that only a small fraction of the world\u2019s population (now or in the past) has been fortunate enough to live under a democratic form of government.\u201d \u2013 History-Social Science Framework for California Public Schools , pgs. 2, 7-8 \\nDo you have the intellectual integrity and moral courage to at least act with the honesty of a child to speak the Emperor\u2019s New Clothes truth? Remember, I\u2019m just asking you to use your voice in a democratic republic to ask US military and various law enforcement to honor their Oaths and do the job we pay them for: protect and defend the US Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. There is no greater enemy than those committing treason to war-murder US military by lying them into invasive illegal Wars of Aggression. \\nThe converse argument is that US military and law enforcement should not enforce our most important laws, especially not those that annually kill millions, harm billions, and loot trillions. Of course, this argument is Orwellian. Cause a lawful end to the dictatorial US rogue state \\nIn conclusion, this essay has reminded you of what you already know: laws are meant to be simple and helpful, what you\u2019ve suspected about the wars is demonstrated as true with a few clear facts, and that your voice is essential if we are to maintain our republic from devolving into dictatorship (literally being dictated/told what the rules are rather than knowing them ourselves). \\nTo remind you of other history that demonstrates this has been an ongoing problem of what is most accurately described as a rogue state : a \u201ctop ten\u201d list of state crimes supporting today\u2019s arrests in a constitutional republic: Introduction to define \u2018rogue state\u2019 as perfect match with US illegal Wars of Aggression, Crimes Against Humanity, dictatorial government The US violated ~600 treaties with Native Americans to steal Native American land. A treaty is signed by a US President, approved by 2/3 vote of the US Senate, and under Article VI of the US Constitution becomes US \u201csupreme Law.\u201d These ongoing \u201cin your face\u201d violations of \u201csupreme Law\u201d became the precedent to typical hypocritical and unlawful US policies of the present. US President Polk lied to Congress (with their approval) to initiate War of Aggression on Mexico . The result was the US illegally stealing 40% of Mexico in 1848. Congress opposed Abraham Lincoln\u2019s crystal-clear explanation as a member of Congress that the Adams-On\u00eds Treaty placed the so-called \u201cborder dispute\u201d 400 miles within land forever promised to Mexico and forever promised as outside any US claim.'"}, "time": 1742564206.2126906}
