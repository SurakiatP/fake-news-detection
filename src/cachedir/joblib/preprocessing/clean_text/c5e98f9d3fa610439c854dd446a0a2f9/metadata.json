And with few exceptions, at some point, most of the executives say something critical, even derogatory, about Donald Trump  \u2014   but it is quickly followed by, \u201cI could never say that on the record. \u201d Almost as quickly, I ask why. The answer is almost universal: fear. Which brings us to Reid Hoffman, the   of LinkedIn and celebrated venture capital investor who had one of the first stakes in both Facebook and Airbnb. Unlike many of his peers, Mr. Hoffman has taken to publicly denouncing Mr. Trump. Last week, he pledged to donate $5 million to a veterans\u2019 group if Mr. Trump released his tax returns before the last presidential debate in October. And now he has gone so far as to release a card game, \u201cTrumped Up Cards: The World\u2019s Biggest Deck\u201d that pokes fun at Mr. Trump. The website that sells the game describes it as \u201ca multiplayer card game where players need really big hands to win. \u201d The game, which is modeled after \u201cApples to Apples\u201d or \u201cCards Against Humanity,\u201d includes a free pass called, \u201cPlay the women card\u201d and uses the tagline: \u201cThis is a game, democracy isn\u2019t. \u201d The box, in tiny print, says, \u201cMade in China, just like   ties, dress shirts, suits, cuff links, eyeglasses, pens, lamps, mirrors, salad bowls, body soap and teddy bears. \u201d But Mr. Hoffman said he almost didn\u2019t make his political views  \u2014   and the card game  \u2014   so public because he worried, as did his family and friends (who originally counseled him against it) that he might become a target for Mr. Trump and his Twitter account  \u2014   or worse. \u201cPeople are fearful that, especially in a circumstance where he might be in a position of extreme power as a potential presidential candidate, that that would be used in a retaliatory way, that would be used in vengeful way,\u201d Mr. Hoffman told me in an interview. \u201cEveryone gets worried about being attacked, and part of the logic and mechanics of bullies is that they cause people to be fearful that they\u2019ll be singled out and attacked. \u201d Mr. Hoffman continued: \u201cIt\u2019s the same thing like on school grounds, when people won\u2019t go help the kid who is being bullied because they\u2019re worried that the bully will focus on them. \u201d Mr. Hoffman articulated a view that is often whispered within the business community  \u2014   among those who are voting against Mr. Trump  \u2014   but rarely spoken aloud. I have talked to some of the top executives of the Fortune 500 companies in recent months, and I\u2019d be   to name one who didn\u2019t at least roll his or her eyes when Mr. Trump\u2019s name was mentioned. Technology companies are afraid that Mr. Trump might criticize their approach to privacy, as he did with Apple. Wall Street banks worry he might seek to break them up. Health care companies are nervous that he might attack them over pricing. Multinationals are worried about trade. All of these are valid issues on the campaign trail  \u2014   but with Mr. Trump, unlike other politicians, the criticism seems more personal and vitriolic. \u201cI\u2019ve had a whole bunch of those kinds of concerns from people around me,\u201d Mr. Hoffman said. \u201cPeople who have legitimate concerns about, \u2018Would LinkedIn become a target for Trump\u2019s ire and attacks? Would he make Second Amendment jokes about your friends and family? \u2019\u201d That is not to say that all chief executives have remained silent this election season. A new survey I wrote about several weeks ago in this column showed just how influential those political positions can be, even if they are simply a signal to others. Chief executives like Howard Schultz of Starbucks, who has endorsed Hillary Clinton, have said positive things about the candidate they support  \u2014   without going negative on the other candidate. However, only a handful of executives  \u2014   mostly retired ones or entrepreneurs who work for themselves (think Mark Cuban, who has come out against Mr. Trump, or Kenneth Langone, who has castigated Mrs. Clinton) or those who seem to have been granted a special status (think Warren Buffett, a Trump foe) have been openly critical of either side. Mr. Hoffman said he had a theory for the silence. \u201cThere\u2019s two sets of things that cause people to be quiet,\u201d he said. \u201cOne is there\u2019s a culture in America that business leadership is to be apolitical. It\u2019s like Michael Jordan\u2019s comment, \u2018Republicans buy Nikes too. \u2019\u201d (Mr. Jordan was quoted as saying that in \u201cSecond Coming,\u201d the 1995 Sam Smith book about the athlete, about why he sought to avoid taking political positions publicly. Mr. Smith cited one of Mr. Jordan\u2019s friends as the source.) Another reason for reticence in the business community, Mr. Hoffman said: \u201cIt\u2019s fear for themselves, or fear they\u2019re attentive to bringing their communities into it. \u201d While these undercurrents are always there during big elections, they seem more pronounced than usual during this ferociously contentious cycle. \u201cI feel sympathetic to the folks, compassionate to the folks who fall silent in that fear,\u201d said Mr. Hoffman, who then proceeded to issue a call to arms. \u201cI think the only thing I would say is that precisely when you feel that fear, it\u2019s precisely the time where if you aspire to be a courageous leader, that fear is a signal to you that you should step forward. \u201d After all, if those who can afford to make their voices heard do not do so, who will? \u201cIf you are in a position of power and in a position of being able to make a difference and you are feeling fearful, think what everyone else is feeling,\u201d Mr. Hoffman said. All these sentiments dovetail with the reactions Mr. Hoffman said he had received about his card game. \u201cI\u2019ve had a number of Republicans actually think it was terrifically funny,\u201d he said, explaining that he had asked some of them to provide promotional quotes about the game. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful maybe in the next week or two I might be able to persuade a couple of them, but thus far all of my requests to my friends for public quotes have been demurred  \u2014   maybe out of fear of retaliation. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562679.3958602}
