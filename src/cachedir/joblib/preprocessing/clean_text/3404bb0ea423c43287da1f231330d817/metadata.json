[\u201cThe   brother Abu Zakariya    \u2014   may Allah accept him  \u2014   detonated his   vehicle on a headquarters of the Rafidhi army and its militias in Tal Kisum village, southwest of Mosul,\u201d the claim quoted by SITE said.  The IS statement did not say when the bombing occurred. The jihadist group uses the word \u201crafidha\u201d which means \u201crejectionists\u201d to refer to Shiite Muslims in a derogatory way because it considers them heretics. Forces from the Hashed   (Popular Mobilisation) a paramilitary umbrella dominated by Shiite militias backed by Tehran, are active in the area mentioned in the statement. They are fighting alongside other Iraqi forces  \u2014   including the army and the federal police  \u2014   as part of a push that started on Sunday to retake the west bank of Mosul. Tens of thousands of Iraqi forces launched a massive offensive on October 17 to retake the city, which is Iraq\u2019s second largest and the only remaining major stronghold of the jihadists in the country. They retook control of the eastern side of Mosul last month. IS fighters of a variety of nationalities, including Britons, have carried out suicide attacks on many occasions in Iraq and Syria in the past three years. The IS statement said that the British fighter\u2019s attack, and that of another suicide bomber of Iraqi nationality, caused many casualties but AFP could not immediately verify the claim.'"}, "time": 1742562297.1524768}
