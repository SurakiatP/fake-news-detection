(See, for example, the website Arkancide .) \\nBut the deaths are the stuff of rumors \u2014 until now. \\nOn September 24, 2013, on the Pete Santilli radio show, a former longtime Clinton associate named Larry Nichols admitted that he had killed people as the Clintons\u2019 hit man or murderer-for-hire. I took this screenshot of Larry Nichols from one of his videos uploaded to YouTube in 2009. \\nLarry Nichols (LN), a self-described former Green Beret, was a longtime associate of Bill Clinton (BC) and served as the marketing director of BC\u2019s Arkansas Development Finance Authority (ADFA), \u201cthe best kept secret in Arkansas.\u201d The two men first met in the late 1970s when BC was an up-and-coming politician. Wikipedia has no entry on Arkansas Development Finance Authority except for a brief reference to ADFA as one of the entities investigated by the United States Senate Whitewater Committee , but without identifying or describing what ADFA is. So I did an Internet search for ADFA and discovered that it is actually an agency of the Arkansas State government. The ADFA website describes itself as \u201c Arkansas\u2019 largest source of low-cost financing for low-to-moderate income housing development, small industries, government, education, agricultural business enterprise & health care.\u201d \\nOn September 24, 2013, Nichols was interviewed by the Pete Santilli radio show for GuerillaMediaNetwork.com. As introduced by Santilli, Nichols \u201chas a lot of inside information on the Clinton crime family.\u201d He published The Clinton Chronicles (a 1990 documentary subtitled \u201cAn Investigation Into the Alleged Criminal Activities of Bill Clinton\u201d) on the Clintons\u2019\u201cchild trafficking,\u201d Bill\u2019s \u201csexual escapades,\u201d and how Hillary \u201cspent 30 years covering up Bill Clinton\u2019s sexual and criminal activities.\u201d \\nHere\u2019s the audio of Nichols\u2019 interview with Santilli: \\nLarry Nichols\u2019 interview begins at the 1:11:08 mark in the YouTube audio. Here\u2019s my transcription of what Nichols said. LN is Larry Nichols; PS is Pete Santilli. \\nLN: \u201cI have actually beat up women and beat up husbands to protect the Clintons\u2026. Not only have I killed people for [Bill Clinton], I\u2019ve [never been in] jail.\u201d \\nPS: \u201cYou\u2019ve always been protected by the Clintons.\u201d \\nBeginning at the 1:11:49 mark, LN says: \u201cBut now let\u2019s call a spade a spade. I\u2019ve been all over the world killing people for this country, some deservedly, some not. Ain\u2019t matter to me. Just what I was paid to do\u2026. Ronald Reagan sent me to El Salvadore. I did it for God and country.\u201d \\nPS asks if, at the time when LN killed for the Clintons, did he do it patriotically, for the common good? \\nLN: \u201cI didn\u2019t give a shit. Some of these people, like Wayne Damond (?), needed to be dealt with. So I went to the jail, cut his nuts off, put them in a jar, put formaldehyde in it and left it there.\u201d \\nPS asks what motivated LN in killing for the Clintons. \\nLN: \u201cJust money. One minute I was doing something for the government, next minute I was doing something for the Clintons. What difference was it?\u201d \\nPS asks how the Clintons presented \u201cthese [murderous] tasks\u201d to LN. \\nLN: \u201cWhenever I got an F2 call, that meant go and kill. State police are not trained to kill in \u2026 the late \u201970s, early \u201980s. There were no SWAT teams\u2026. I had an F2 call, that meant go in and kill a guy. I didn\u2019t give a shit\u2026. When it [the order to kill] came from the president [Reagan], it was for God and country. When it came from Clinton, hell, I didn\u2019t give a damn. I just go kill somebody, cut his nuts off.\u201d \\nPS asks if LN was paid to murder. \\nLN answers that if the Clintons did not pay him, \u201cthey\u2019d piss me off and they didn\u2019t want to piss me off.\u201d \\nAt some point, however, the Clintons turned on LN and he had to defend himself. LN says: \u201cI had to [defend myself] because I didn\u2019t have a support group. The media weren\u2019t going to cover it, so if I died, they\u2019d just pour alcohol over me and say I was drunk and crashed on the side of the road.\u201d \\nPS asks LN what kept him alive. \\nLN: \u201cI\u2019m a Green Beret. I\u2019m trained \u2026 I\u2019m skilled in staying alive. We have one rule: Kill back first. So if they send people to me, I\u2019ll just kill them back first. I don\u2019t ask questions. I deal with it.\u201d \\nLarry Nichols was also asked about Hillary Clinton\u2019s fitness to be president. His answer: \u201cAfter the Benghazi debacle, No.\u201d \\nNichols claims that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a friend, told him what we already now know \u2014 that the Obama administration had been providing arms for Muslim terrorists in Syria (via Libya). When Netanyahu voiced his objection, the arms supply stopped, which enraged the al-Qaeda-connected terrorists to attack the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. \\nWhat Nichols doesn\u2019t say (doesn\u2019t know) is that the Obama regime has NOT stopped supplying arms to the Syrian \u201crebels,\u201d but is actually expanding the CIA\u2019s training of the terrorists . \\nH/t Dean Garrison and FOTM\u2019s TnRick \\nSee also:'"}, "time": 1742562147.3564456}
