[\u201cI haven\u2019t heard that from our clubs in any way that that\u2019s an issue,\u201d Goodell said during a press conference to conclude the NFL owners meetings at the Arizona Biltmore Hotel in Phoenix.  Goodell believes that if a team feels Kaepernick can help them win, he\u2019ll likely get signed. \u201cMy experience in 35 years is that our clubs make independent evaluations of players they work hard to try to improve their teams,\u201d Goodell added. \u201cBut if they think a player can help improve their team, they\u2019re going to do that. \u201d The NFL has a dearth of elite quarterbacks. With only around   of them in a   league, about   of teams are still searching for a true   at quarterback. Without an elite quarterback, it\u2019s hard to challenge for an NFL championship. The NFL is a   league. Teams like Cleveland, Houston, Denver, San Francisco, Jacksonville and the New York Jets are desperately searching for a franchise quarterback. If Kaepernick was one, he\u2019d be signed by now. But, he\u2019s not, and he hasn\u2019t played well since the 2013 season. As ESPN\u2019s Trent Dilfer put it, he\u2019s a \u201cremedial\u201d reader of defenses. Kaepenick often gets stuck on his primary read, and doesn\u2019t do a good job of seeing the whole field. He has a tendency to drop his eyes and halt his progressions when he feels pocket pressure. He also has accuracy issues. Teams don\u2019t sign mediocre players who are distractions. Great player who are a distraction  \u2014   yes. Middle of the road performers who are distractions usually have a very hard time finding a job. Kaepernick was a major distraction for the 49ers last year due to his anthem kneeling, which became an international story. Why did he kneel? \u201cI am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,\u201d Kaepernick told NFL. com last August. How the United States \u201coppresses black people and people of color\u201d in the modern era is unclear, but he feels it\u2019s still an issue. However, Kaepernick\u2019s camp has made it clear the quarterback will stand for the National Anthem moving forward. That should help him in his job search. But, what really would help him is playing better.'"}, "time": 1742564422.9529762}
