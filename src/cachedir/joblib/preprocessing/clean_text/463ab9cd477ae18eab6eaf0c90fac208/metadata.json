[The bill does not abolish the monarchy as CNN observes, Emperor Akihito is ready to pass the throne along to his oldest son,    Crown Prince Naruhito.   In fact, the bill specifically refers to Akihito instead of changing the rules of abdication for all emperors to follow because, as the Daily Sabah puts it, \u201cthe conservative government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is reluctant to open the imperial system to   debate. \u201d However, Daily Sabah notes there is strong popular support in Japan for a permanent law on abdication. Although Akihito and his Empress Michiko are currently in good health, he has publicly expressed concerns about their advancing age becoming an impediment to their official duties. \u201cWhen I consider that my fitness level is gradually declining, I am worried that it may become difficult for me to carry out my duties as the symbol of the State with my whole being as I have done until now,\u201d Akihito said last year. The BBC recalls that the emperor has undergone both heart surgery and treatment for prostate cancer. He has been on the throne since 1989, when he succeeded Hirohito  \u2014   the ruler who brought Japan into World War II  \u2014   and became the 125th Emperor. The Japanese imperial line is the longest unbroken hereditary monarchy in the world, stretching back for fourteen centuries. Akihito is a direct descendant of the first emperor, Jimmu, who reigned around 660 B. C.  Empress Michiko is the first empress of common birth in the entire history of Japan, celebrated as Japan\u2019s answer to Cinderella when she married Akihito in 1959. She said she was \u201csurprised and pained\u201d when she learned of her husband\u2019s desire to abdicate while still alive.  Legislation to permit abdication is necessary because emperors are currently required to serve for life under Japanese law. The previous voluntary abdication occurred in 1817 when the scholarly Emperor Kokaku retired after an exceptionally long reign. Following approval by the Cabinet, the bill must still be debated and approved by the Japanese parliament, but plans are already being made for Akihito to pass the throne along to Naruhito on New Year\u2019s Day 2019. Another possible date is Emperor Akihito\u2019s birthday on December 23rd, although that would be inconvenient for the Japanese calendar since beginning a new imperial \u201cera\u201d in the middle of a year is complicated. Japan Times offers a preview of how the ceremony might proceed: The likely location for the abdication ceremony of Emperor Akihito is the Imperial Palace. The timing of the event will be either before or after      a ceremony to hand down traditional properties, such as the sacred sword and jewels, to the new emperor, the sources said. After the handing of properties ceremony, which marks the completion of the throne ascending procedures, the new emperor is to hold the    first audience ceremony to meet with the heads of the   administrative and judicial systems. The government is planning to hold those ceremonies by the end of 2018, and an enthronement ceremony, called    that formally announces the new emperor\u2019s accession sometime in 2019. Channel News Asia observes that there has been some anxiety about the shortage of princes to take over after Naruhito only a handful of other male relatives  \u2014   four, by the most generous count  \u2014   are eligible to follow Naruhito.  \u201cThe scarcity of young men in the family has prompted talk of alternatives, including letting women ascend the throne, though traditionalists abhor the idea,\u201d Channel News Asia reports. Other ideas include expanding the size of the royal family to make more distant relations eligible for the throne, for instance by permitting female royals to marry commoners without losing their royal status. Such is the situation currently confronting    Princess Mako, Akihito\u2019s oldest granddaughter, who is engaged to marry a young man who works at a law firm. Her aunt Princess Sayako, Akihito\u2019s only daughter, likewise surrendered royal status by marrying a commoner in 2005. '"}, "time": 1742561833.1083765}
