Lincoln Center Theater said Monday that it would stage a revival of the musical, directed by Bartlett Sher, who has become the nonprofit organization\u2019s   director for revivals of midcentury classics. The show, as any theater lover knows, is about a   flower saleswoman, Eliza Doolittle, who is taking speech lessons from a professor named Henry Higgins. Set in and around London in 1912, it is based on a play, \u201cPygmalion,\u201d by George Bernard Shaw. The original production of \u201cMy Fair Lady,\u201d featuring music by Frederick Loewe and a book and lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner, opened on Broadway in 1956, starring Julie Andrews and Rex Harrison, and by the time it closed, in 1962, it was the   musical in Broadway history, with 2, 717 performances. There were Broadway revivals in 1976, 1981, and 1993, and the New York Philharmonic staged a production in 2007. But the show is probably best known from the 1964 film adaptation, which starred Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison and won eight Academy Awards in 1965, including best picture. \u201cIt\u2019s a show of great delight and great sophistication,\u201d said Andr\u00e9 Bishop, the artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater, which will present the revival in association with the Nederlander organization. \u201cAnd I love the idea that at this particular time, when people are not always precise in the way they speak or write, here\u2019s this show that is about speaking. \u201d Mr. Sher, a resident director at Lincoln Center Theater, has directed two classic revivals there  \u2014   \u201cThe King and I,\u201d in 2015, and \u201cSouth Pacific,\u201d in 2008, both of which won Tony Awards for best musical revival. In 2015, he also directed a Broadway revival of another midcentury classic, \u201cFiddler on the Roof. \u201d \u201cBart has this very interesting ability to zero in on the themes of an old musical that seem to apply to today,\u201d Mr. Bishop said. \u201cHe has his own spin, yet clearly honors the original intention, which is why people like him so much. \u201d The revival of \u201cMy Fair Lady\u201d is scheduled to begin previews on March 22, 2018, and to open on April 19, 2018, at Lincoln Center\u2019s Vivian Beaumont Theater. The cast has not yet been chosen.'"}, "time": 1742562096.3689175}
