Storytelling was a nightly ritual in the Clemens home. But something about this particular tale must have stuck with Clemens, better known as Mark Twain, because he decided to jot down some notes about it. The story might have ended there, lost to history. But decades later, the scholar John Bird was searching the Twain archives at the University of California, Berkeley, when he came across the notes for the story, which Twain titled \u201cOleomargarine. \u201d Mr. Bird was astonished to find a richly imagined fable, in Twain\u2019s inimitable voice. He and other scholars believe it may be the only written remnant of a children\u2019s fairy tale from Twain, though he told his daughters stories constantly. It\u2019s impossible to know why Twain did not finish the tale, or if he ever intended it for a wider audience. Now, more than a century after Twain dreamed it up, \u201cOleomargarine\u201d has taken on a strange new afterlife. After consulting a few other scholars, Mr. Bird brought the text to the attention of the Mark Twain House and Museum in Hartford, which sold it to Doubleday Books for Young Readers. This fall, Doubleday will release \u201cThe Purloining of Prince Oleomargarine,\u201d an expanded version of the story that was fleshed out and reimagined by the children\u2019s book    team of Philip and Erin Stead. From Twain\u2019s spare   the Steads created a   illustrated story featuring talking animals, giants, dragons, a kidnapped prince and a wicked king. While the original work has a timeless quality, the Steads added a postmodern twist: Twain himself makes an appearance in the book, to argue with the author, Philip Stead, about the direction the story takes. Finishing a partial manuscript by one of the country\u2019s most revered writers was terrifying at times, the Steads said. \u201cWe said yes before our brains could tell us it was a terrible idea and we would never be able to do it,\u201d Mr. Stead said in a telephone interview from the couple\u2019s home studio in Northern Michigan. Erin Stead, who did the illustrations, said they were very aware of the creative risks involved in taking on the work of such a towering literary figure. \u201cWe both just tried to approach the text respectfully and with as much reverence as possible,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one\u2019s qualified to write for Mark Twain. \u201d \u201cOleomargarine\u201d is the latest abandoned children\u2019s tale to resurface decades after a revered writer\u2019s death. In recent years, publishers and estates have dug deep into the archives of beloved children\u2019s book authors in search of partial manuscripts and castoff gems, and have released previously unpublished works by Dr. Seuss, Beatrix Potter and Margaret Wise Brown. Twain\u2019s story may hold even greater literary significance for scholars and fans, because it represents a new genre for him. While he wrote fiction, essays, journalism, travelogues, short stories and satire, he never published fiction for very young children, apart from his translation of a German fable. It certainly wasn\u2019t for a lack of ideas. As Twain describes in his journals, his daughters constantly demanded he make up stories on the spot. They often gave him an image from a magazine or another visual prompt to use as inspiration. Sometimes they would insist that his stories mention every knickknack on their living room mantel, beginning with a painting of a cat and ending with a portrait of a young girl. \u201cThey were a difficult and exacting audience  \u2014   those little creatures,\u201d he wrote of his daughters in his journal. \u201cThe stories had to be absolutely original and fresh. \u201d Like an artifact from a lost civilization, \u201cOleomargarine\u201d gives a tantalizing glimpse of the wild, ephemeral tales that Twain spontaneously created for his daughters each night, in the period when he was working on \u201cAdventures of Huckleberry Finn. \u201d Scholars haven\u2019t found any written remnants of those stories, apart from \u201cOleomargarine,\u201d which suggests Twain thought it might hold lasting appeal for a wider audience. \u201cHe had at least some inkling that it might be publishable,\u201d said Robert Hirst, the editor of \u201cWho Is Mark Twain?\u201d and the curator of Twain\u2019s papers at Berkeley, a vast archive of more than 500 manuscripts. Mr. Bird stumbled on the manuscript in 2011, when he was searching the Twain archives for food references, for a Mark Twain cookbook. The word \u201coleomargarine\u201d sounded as if it could be part of a recipe. \u201cWhat I found is what seems to be the only remaining record of these bedtime stories that he told his kids,\u201d Mr. Bird said. The manuscript was just 16 handwritten pages long, and unfinished. It opens as a poor starving boy named Johnny is given a magic seed, which grows into a flower. He eats it and discovers he can understand animals. Johnny and the animals go on a quest to rescue Prince Oleomargarine, who has been kidnapped by giants and taken to a cave guarded by dragons. At one point, Twain scribbled down a suggestion that his daughter Susie made, when she asked if the kangaroo was the hostess. After finding references to bedtime stories about a boy named Johnny in Twain\u2019s journals, Mr. Bird theorized that Twain had probably told this story to his daughters while the family was in Paris in 1879. Johnny was a recurring character in the nightly tales for the Clemens girls, at least for a while. In a diary that Twain kept about his daughters, he described how they lost interest in Johnny after the character told a lie. \u201cJohnny\u2019s days of usefulness were over he was up a stump,  I had to leave him there,\u201d Twain wrote. At first, Mr. Bird was unsure what to do with the fragmentary text. After talking to Mr. Hirst and a few other scholars, he decided that the story offered a significant new perspective on Twain\u2019s domestic life and work, and that it should be published. \u201cIt\u2019s a testament to his incredible powers of invention,\u201d said Mr. Bird, a professor of English at Winthrop University in South Carolina. He wrote his own version, which closely followed Twain\u2019s blueprint and incorporated his language, and took the idea of publishing it to Cindy Lovell, who was then the executive director of the Mark Twain House and Museum. But Mr. Bird\u2019s version, which hewed to the original, was never published. Doubleday, which acquired rights to the story from the Twain House, decided to hire the Steads, who are stars in children\u2019s publishing, to finish the story. \u201cWhat we ended up with is this wonderful story inspired by Twain\u2019s unfinished manuscript, which makes any Twain purist uneasy,\u201d Ms. Lovell said. Mr. Stead secluded himself in a cabin on Beaver Island, in the middle of Lake Michigan, and wrote the first draft of the   story in a feverish nine days. He often found himself arguing with Twain about the changes he wanted to make and found the imagined conversations so compelling that he put them in the book. To capture a rhythm that mirrored Twain\u2019s natural speaking voice, Mr. Stead read the first and second volume of Twain\u2019s autobiography, which Twain had dictated. \u201cI tried to approach the project as a piece of oral history,\u201d Mr. Stead said. \u201cThis was a story that Twain told his daughters, and now he\u2019s going to tell it to me, and now I\u2019m going to tell it. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563660.6807556}
