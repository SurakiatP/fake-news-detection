The new case of the missing trillions, and the combustible political climate in the U.S. in 2016, has left many commentators fearing that \u201csomething big is about to happen again.\u201d\\nEveryone knows by now that the US military has the largest budget on the planet. It\u2019s so large in fact, that it could pay for China\u2019s military budget 3 times over. Which has to make you wonder, where does all of that money go? You may think that question has an obvious answer, since we are aware of most of the military\u2019s weapon systems, personnel numbers, and equipment.\\nIn reality, we don\u2019t know. And when I say we, I mean even our own government doesn\u2019t really know. In response to Congressional demands that the Pentagon provide a comprehensive audit of their finances for the first time, a Department of Defense Inspector General\u2019s report was published last week. It revealed that the Pentagon could not provide documentation pertaining to $6.5 trillion in transactions.\\nOn top of that, the report showed that the Pentagon \u201cdid not document or support why the Defense Departmental Reporting System . . . removed at least 16,513 of 1.3 million records during Q3 FY 2015. As a result, the data used to prepare the FY 2015 AGF third quarter and year-end financial statements were unreliable and lacked an adequate audit trail.\u201d Sounds like the Pentagon is deliberately hiding some of their expenses, doesn\u2019t it?\\nWhich wouldn\u2019t come as a surprise, since the Pentagon has been ignoring a federal law passed 20 years ago, which mandates regular audits for all government agencies. In that time, they\u2019ve never once provided a good explanation for where their our money is spent. Is this money being burned up in fraud and waste, or are they spending it on clandestine activities that would outrage the American people? Since they never get in trouble for ignoring our auditing laws, we\u2019ll probably never know.\\n'"}, "time": 1742562252.8058245}
