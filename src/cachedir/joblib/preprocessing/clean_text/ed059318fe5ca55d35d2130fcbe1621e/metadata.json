No test of galactic franchise sustainability here. But Disney did face a   enemy: Mother Nature, in the form of winter storms that blanketed the upper half of the United States and much of Canada. She turned out to be no match, either. \u201cRogue One: A Star Wars Story,\u201d with a cast led by Felicity Jones and Diego Luna, collected an estimated $155 million at theaters in North America, on par with expectations and the   December opening on record, behind last year\u2019s \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens. \u201d In release in about 70 percent of the overseas market, \u201cRogue One\u201d sold an additional $135. 5 million in tickets, according to Disney. \u201cRogue One,\u201d about stealing blueprints to the planet vaporizer known as the Death Star, cost roughly $350 million to make and market worldwide. \u201cWe saw no real impact from the weather,\u201d Greg Foster, chief executive of Imax Entertainment, said by phone on Sunday. \u201cIt boils down to the movie. Felicity plays an awesome character, and the movie feels very authentic to the \u2018Star Wars\u2019 universe. \u201d More than 700 Imax theaters played \u201cRogue One\u201d worldwide, delivering the strongest opening results of the year for that   chain. While a few critics found fault with the film, which was directed by Gareth Edwards, \u201cRogue One\u201d received reviews that were 84 percent positive in aggregate, according to RottenTomatoes. com, making it the   reviewed \u201cStar Wars\u201d entry in two decades, behind only \u201cThe Force Awakens. \u201d Ticket buyers gave \u201cRogue One\u201d an A grade in CinemaScore exit polls, boding well for momentum in the weeks ahead. \u201cPart of the hope here was to create a way for the uninitiated to have a way in and bring them along for future films,\u201d said Dave Hollis, Disney\u2019s executive vice president for theatrical distribution. About 40 percent of ticket buyers were under the age of 25. Terrible reviews most likely hurt the weekend\u2019s other new   movie, \u201cCollateral Beauty. \u201d That latest effort by Will Smith sputtered with about $7 million in ticket sales, a career low for Mr. Smith, according to comScore, which compiles box office data. \u201cCollateral Beauty,\u201d about a man who writes letters to Love, Time and Death, cost New Line Cinema, a division of Warner Bros. at least $60 million to make and market. On the bright side: The film could do better overseas, where Mr. Smith\u2019s star power remains more intact. Domestic interest in \u201cRogue One,\u201d on the other hand, was strong enough to prompt some fans to camp outside theaters in   temperatures one group in Ellensburg, Wash. set up an outdoor fireplace to keep warm. (Insert bad joke about the   Hoth here.) Wearing costumes to   screenings is a tradition for   \u201cStar Wars\u201d fans, and \u201cRogue One\u201d proved to be no exception. Disney, as ever, leveraged every asset in its empire to market the film. Exclusive \u201cRogue One\u201d footage was shown on   ABC. At one point, Disney used lighting effects to turn one of its theme park landmarks  \u2014   the    golf   sphere at Epcot\u2019s entrance in Orlando, Fla.  \u2014   into the Death Star spaceship. An array of   merchandise stretched to a Death Star popcorn popper and clothing for dogs. Notably, Disney had to fight months of online hyperventilation over leaked news that \u201cRogue One\u201d underwent extensive \u201creshoots,\u201d shorthand for going back after the end of principal filming to rework certain scenes or add to them. Once upon a time, such efforts were rare  \u2014   it\u2019s expensive to reassemble cast and crew  \u2014   and usually meant the movie as a whole was a train wreck. But that is no longer the case, at least not always. Movies on the scale of \u201cRogue One,\u201d   productions with loads of visual effects, now schedule time for reshoots up front as a routine part of filmmaking.'"}, "time": 1742564463.605266}
