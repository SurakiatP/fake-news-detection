We are going to be starting those negotiations relatively soon. And we will be in a form reimbursed by Mexico, which I\u2019ve always said. \u201d He continued, \u201cI\u2019m just telling you there will be a payment. It will be in a form, perhaps a complicated form. You have to understand what I\u2019m doing is good for the United States. It\u2019s also going to be good for Mexico. We want to have a very stable, very solid Mexico. \u201d When asked when construction will begin Trump said, \u201cAs soon as we can, as soon as we can physically do it  \u2026    I would say in months, yeah.
