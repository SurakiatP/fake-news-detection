No gang-related colors, no cut-offs, nothing too offensive or revealing. \\nWomen at Boston Latin School can\u2019t wear skirts whose hemlines are more than four inches above the knee and their bra straps can\u2019t be the \u201cspaghetti\u201d style, where they\u2019re so thin they\u2019re barely there. This is a middle and high school folks \u2026 not a college for adults. \\nIt\u2019s a way of showing a little decorum \u2013 a little respect for yourself and for the school. \\nAnd it promotes rape culture . \\nBecause for radical feminists, telling them not to dress provocatively is telling them that men are sexist pigs who simply can\u2019t resist the wiles of a woman. \\nThey call it \u201cvictim-blaming\u201d and while there\u2019s a point to it \u2013 you can\u2019t blame a woman for being assault if she\u2019s jogging alone in a park, but certainly you can bring up a woman\u2019s attire if it is specifically designed to attract attention from the opposite sex. \\nLet\u2019s be honest: Women sometimes dress for attention. They want guys to look at them. \\nBut under leftist-feminist theory, they shouldn\u2019t. \\nSo, as HeatStreet reports, there\u2019s a Change.org petition that claims this dress code sends the message that \u201cwe live in a patriarchal society where men can decide whether a female\u2019s clothing is appropriate or inappropriate.\u201d \\nThe dress code, they claim, creates a \u201ca sense of shame towards girls [sic] bodies\u201d and reinforces the notion that \u201cyes, it is our fault when girls get raped because they should have covered up and avoided the situation by dressing in a way that does not attract another person.\u201d \\nI\u2019m not sure what these women want. Do they want to be able to attend school wearing micro-miniskirts and just bras? Pasties? Maybe we shouldn\u2019t have a dress code at all? \\nIn reaction to the idiotic controversy, Boston Latin School changed their policy, allowing women to wear \u201cleggings\u201d as long as they\u2019re not \u201csee-through.\u201d The rest of the policy will stay in place until Nov. 1 \u2013 then it will probably be changed again. \\nHere\u2019s how their \u201cpetition\u201d reads: By allowing the school to dress code us, we are telling the school several things: Yes, we still live in a patriarchal society where men can decide whether a female\u2019s clothing is appropriate or inappropriate. Yes, a body should be covered in order to be attractive. Establishing a sense of shame towards girls bodies is okay and perfectly acceptable. Yes, a girl\u2019s body is a sinful temptation that needs to be covered up at all costs for others to focus on their education. Yes, a female\u2019s body is more tempting and sexual than a male\u2019s body. Yes, it is our fault when girls get raped because they should have covered up and avoided the situation by dressing in a way that does not attract another person. Are these statements correct to you? Is it okay to assign a dress code in this manner? If the answer is NO! then sign this petition to tell Mr. Contompasis to reconsider his dress code restrictions. \\nWhat a bunch of nonsense. These are CHILDREN. They do not get a say in establishing a school\u2019s dress code. PERIOD.'"}, "time": 1742564501.8318396}
