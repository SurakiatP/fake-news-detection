Trump could have avoided paying income taxes for up to 18 years to unleash a new torrent of criticism of her opponent, saying he pretended to help working Americans even as he personified \u201cthe same rigged system he claims he will change. \u201d \u201cHe abuses his power, games the system, puts his own interests ahead of the country\u2019s,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told a crowd of more than 1, 100 gathered for a rally on Monday at the Downtown Toledo Train Station. \u201cIt\u2019s always Trump first, and everyone else last. \u201d Mrs. Clinton unleashed the attack during a previously planned economic speech in Ohio, where she has struggled to connect with white   voters, who have seen huge job losses amid the   flow of manufacturing plants overseas. But the revelation on Saturday night that Mr. Trump declared a $916 million loss on his 1995 income tax returns and could have avoided paying federal taxes for years added a new impetus and an extra dose of fire and brimstone to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s economic pitch. She wasted little time in tying Mr. Trump\u2019s tax practices to her broader economic message of reining in corporate excess and alleviating income inequality. \u201cToledo is the kind of place where people work hard, look after one another and, yes, pay their taxes,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said at the start of her remarks here. And noting the defense Mr. Trump\u2019s allies have put forth  \u2014   that his handling of his taxes reflects his \u201cgenius\u201d  \u2014   Mrs. Clinton said, \u201cWhat kind of a genius loses a billion dollars in a single year?\u201d She criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s reluctance to release his tax returns  \u2014   as every other major recent presidential candidate has done  \u2014   and mentioned the article in The New York Times revealing his tax records. \u201cWhile millions of American families, including mine and yours, were working hard and paying their fair share,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said, \u201cit seems he was contributing nothing to our nation. \u201d Several hours later, at a campaign rally in Pueblo, Colo. Mr. Trump said that he had used the tax code \u201cbrilliantly,\u201d and that his mastery of it meant he was best qualified to overhaul a deeply flawed system. \u201cI understand the tax laws better than almost anyone, which is why I am the one who can truly fix them,\u201d he said. Mrs. Clinton wove her attack on Mr. Trump into an address in which she also criticized other corporate actors, including top executives at Wells Fargo after employees opened roughly 1. 5 million bank accounts and applied for 565, 000 credit cards that may not have been authorized by customers, according to regulators. The bank paid $185 million in fines, including a $100 million penalty from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the largest penalty the agency has ever issued. Mrs. Clinton seemed upbeat at the rally, her first since the revelations Saturday about Mr. Trump\u2019s taxes. She boasted of being endorsed by LeBron James, who led the Cleveland Cavaliers to the N. B. A. championship and grew up in Akron, Ohio, which Mrs. Clinton was also visiting Monday. \u201cI hope to be elected president, but I know here in Ohio, LeBron will always be the king,\u201d she said. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s speech fit into a broader economic philosophy, endorsed by her closest economic advisers and often referred to as inclusive capitalism, that calls for corporations to put less emphasis on   profits and invest more in employees, the environment and communities. On Monday, Mrs. Clinton reiterated her proposal to raise the minimum wage, strengthen labor unions and offer tax incentives to companies that share profits with employees. She also unveiled two new policies to protect workers, including curbing the use of \u201cforced arbitration\u201d clauses in contracts that prohibit workers and consumers from bringing legal action against companies that have harmed them. \u201cWe are not going to let corporations like Wells Fargo use these   \u2018gotchas\u2019 to escape accountability,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. And she took aim at pharmaceutical companies, against the backdrop of outrage against Mylan, which repeatedly raised the price of EpiPens, leading to widespread consumer anger, particularly among parents whose children rely on the lifesaving injections after allergic reactions. \u201cWe should slap penalties on companies trying to cheat people who need these drugs,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. The campaign stops in Toledo and Akron marked the first time Mrs. Clinton had visited Ohio since Labor Day, as polls show the state\u2019s white   voters gravitating toward Mr. Trump. Fifty percent of likely voters in Ohio preferred Mr. Trump, compared with 46 percent for Mrs. Clinton, in a   poll last month. Early voting begins next week in Ohio, and the Clinton campaign has roughly 300 staff members and an army of volunteers working to register voters. On Tuesday, former President Bill Clinton plans to embark on a   bus tour through the state largely focused on   economic issues. Recent polls have shown that Mrs. Clinton has gained an advantage on Mr. Trump when voters are asked who will best handle the economy. Ever since the Democratic nominating fight, Mrs. Clinton has called out specific corporate players for criticism, trying to demonstrate to voters how she would approach corporate misbehavior as president. The same day Mrs. Clinton fought to present herself as a champion of   Rust Belt voters, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the Clinton family\u2019s finances. In the years since Mr. Clinton left the White House, the Clintons have amassed in excess of $125 million delivering paid speeches to Wall Street and other special interests. \u201cHillary Clinton hasn\u2019t made an honest dollar in her entire life,\u201d he said in Pueblo, contrasting his   experience to her profiting off her career of public service by making speeches. \u201cHillary Clinton left the White House dead broke,\u201d he said. \u201cNow she and her husband have made more than $200 million without building a company or creating a single thing of value. \u201d Although the data has shown steady job growth under President Obama, voters in states like Ohio have not felt that the economy has come back, said Nina Turner, a former state senator from Ohio who supported Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in the Democratic primary race. \u201cThey feel like, \u2018My quality of life hasn\u2019t gotten much better, and I need somebody to speak to those issues,\u2019\u201d Ms. Turner said. \u201cInstead,\u201d she said of the two   nominees, \u201cwe have two wealthy people battling back and forth. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562232.2780108}
