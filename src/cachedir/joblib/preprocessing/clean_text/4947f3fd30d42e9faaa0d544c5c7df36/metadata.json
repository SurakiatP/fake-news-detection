[Media sites are struggling to frame the news of Breitbart\u2019s recent high profile hires, plans to open new bureaus in Europe, and the departure of former Breitbart employees to work in the Trump White House. We summarize their findings here for the amusement of our 45 million unique monthly readers.  First up, the Washington Post is upset that Breitbart is not racist. While falsely labeling us an \u201c \u201d site, the Washington Post\u2019s Callum Borchers speculates on Breitbart\u2019s future in an article titled: \u201cHow Breitbart could lose its   street cred. \u201d The Post moans: \u201cBreitbart has, in fact, looked increasingly mainstream since Election Day. \u201d After weeks of disingenuously associating us with \u201cwhite supremacists,\u201d \u201cwhite nationalists,\u201d and \u201c\u201d the Post appears frustrated to learn that we\u2019re not cross burners after all. But, of course, the Post couches their disappointment by feigning concern for our \u201cstreet cred. \u201d If we \u201cgo mainstream,\u201d the Post warns that we \u201crisk alienating readers who were drawn to the website because it seemed to be by and for outsiders. \u201d When reached for comment, Breitbart senior management thanked the Post for the warning and shared the following image from Alexa. com\u2019s top US website rankings: The Atlantic\u2019s Rosie Gray claims we\u2019re trying \u201cto go Mainstream. \u201d She describes Breitbart News as a \u201cscrappy, outsider publication\u201d that \u201chas never enjoyed this much prominence \u2014  but it\u2019s discovering that success brings its own challenges. \u201d Like the Washington Post, Gray expresses concern that the more Breitbart \u201cbecomes part of the mainstream, the more its outsider cred is threatened. \u201d Ironically, Gray mocked Breitbart just a few days ago for running an oversized headline framing Trump\u2019s inaugural address as  : Breitbart going with the   font pic. twitter.   \u2014   Rosie Gray (@RosieGray) January 20, 2017,  When reached for comment, Breitbart senior management thanked the Atlantic for its concern and shared the following image from Alexa. com\u2019s top US website rankings: Meanwhile, Salon labels Breitbart News a \u201cfringe news site\u201d and \u201c  propaganda organ. \u201d Salon\u2019s Gary Legum writes that the recent White House hiring of former Breitbart employees ranks high on the list of the \u201cmany tragedies   \u2026     set in motion by the nascent Donald Trump administration. \u201d And as a \u201cfake news\u201d bonus, Salon used a headline photo purporting to show the former Breitbart employees who left to join the Trump White House. They included an image of former Breitbart Executive Chairman Steve Bannon, former Breitbart Senior National Security Editor Sebastian Gorka, and a woman they claim is former Breitbart reporter Julia Hahn. Breitbart    Alexander Marlow, when reached for comment, said, \u201cScoreboard. Oh, and I have no idea who that woman is. \u201d Legum describes in lurid detail the horrors of \u201ca fully   White House\u201d: With Bannon in the West Wing, it was inevitable that the administration would bring in a few of the propagators of the racist, isolationist, nativist swill that over the last few years has made Breitbart the   \u201cnews\u201d site for the sort of white people who berate Mexican restaurants for printing their menus in Spanish. But even recognizing the likelihood that Bannon would poach some of his former employees was not enough preparation for the   ugliness we will likely hear on a daily basis from a fully   White House. We offer no comment about \u201c  ugliness,\u201d but Breitbart National Security Editor Frances Martel, when reached for comment, said this about the Mexican restaurant menus: Ojal\u00e1 que tenga raz\u00f3n Salon que los americanos que no hablan espa\u00f1ol le est\u00e9n dando tanto negocio a los restaurantes mexicanos, porque la comida mexicana es deliciosa (aunque, claro, no mejor que la cubana). The Associated Press  \u2014   the mainstay of establishment journalism  \u2014   is perhaps understandably miffed that Breitbart is now treated with the same respect as their own hallowed organization at White House press briefings. Two weeks ago, they offered a snarky aside that only Breitbart got a reserved seat at Trump\u2019s January 11 presser. \u201cOther reporters scrambled to save their seats. Reporters shouted and waved their arms at Trump to get his attention, rather than the president calling on questioners from a list, as is often the practice,\u201d the AP sniffed. Breitbart CEO Larry Solov was unavailable for comment.'"}, "time": 1742564302.4050715}
