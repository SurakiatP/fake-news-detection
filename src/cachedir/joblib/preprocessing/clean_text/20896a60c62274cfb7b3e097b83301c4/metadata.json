Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d while defending   Donald Trump\u2019s use of Twitter, the incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer said,\u201dI think it freaks the mainstream media out that he has this following of over   million people that follow him on social media, that he can have a direct conversation. He doesn\u2019t have to have it funneled through the media. \u201d  Partial transcript as follows: KARL: So you\u2019re the incoming press secretary and communications director. I\u2019ve got to ask you about what we saw in \u201cThe New York Times\u201d last week, a headline about Trump talking about expanding U. S. nuclear ability. But what struck me was the subhead, \u201cStatement on Twitter. \u201d In the beginning of the second paragraph, \u201cMr. Trump\u2019s statement in a midafternoon Twitter post. \u201d Here, big   headlines, generated by a midafternoon Twitter post. Is that what we\u2019re going to see? I mean you\u2019re the press secretary  \u2014   SPICER: Sure. Why not? But  \u2026     KARL: So major policy done via Twitter? SPICER: You know, with all due respect, I think it freaks the mainstream media out that he has this following of over   million people that follow him on social media, that he can have a direct conversation. He doesn\u2019t have to have it funneled through the media. This is the  \u2014   this is going to be  \u2014   business as usual is over, as I\u2019ve said before. There\u2019s a new sheriff in town and he\u2019s going to do things, first and foremost, for the American people  \u2014   KARL: So we\u2019re still going to see a lot of Twitter as president? SPICER: You\u2019re going to see  \u2014   absolutely you\u2019re going to see Twitter. Why wouldn\u2019t  \u2014   KARL: He said he was  \u2014   well he had said on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that he was going to cut back. SPICER: No. You know what, the fact of the matter is that, when he tweets, he gets results. So whether it\u2019s Twitter, holding a news conference, picking up the phone, having a meeting, he is going to make sure that he continues to fight for the American people every single day. KARL: Bottom line, are you going to have regular White House press briefings, Sean Spicer? SPICER: Absolutely, in some way. You know some of them will be on camera some of them will be off. But absolutely. We understand the importance  \u2014   KARL: So no more daily televised press briefings? SPICER: No, no. No decisions have been made. But we\u2019re looking at every single facet of government and figuring it out. Can we do it better? We\u2019ll sit down with the White House Correspondents Dinner, Correspondents Association. I\u2019ve already had reporters reach out and say, hey, we\u2019ve got some ideas. This isn\u2019t  \u2014   this is about we understand that we have a message to get out and successes to  \u2014   that we want the American people to understand. So we\u2019ll use every tool possible. And, absolutely, we\u2019ll sit down and make sure that, on a daily basis, the press is informed. KARL: And regular presidential press conferences? SPICER: Absolutely. KARL: All right. Sean Spicer, incoming press secretary for the Trump administration, thank you for joining us. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742563646.7394977}
