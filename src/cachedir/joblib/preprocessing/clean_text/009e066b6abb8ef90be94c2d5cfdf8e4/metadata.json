The U.S. Justice Department official Peter Kadzik in charge of of the probe into Hillary Clinton\u2019s and Huma Abedin\u2019s emails sent Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta a \u2018heads up\u2019 about a congressional hearing into her secret server last year. Wikileaks reveals Podesta responded by looping senior campaign staff into the conversation and said the hearing would provide \u2018additional chances for mischief.\u2019 \\nThey are last week\u2019s scandal in a year running over with scandals, but in truth their significance goes far beyond mere scandal: they are a window into the soul of the Democratic party and into the dreams and thoughts of the class to whom the party answers. \\nThe class to which I refer is not rising in angry protest; they are by and large pretty satisfied, pretty contented. Nobody takes road trips to exotic West Virginia to see what the members of this class looks like or how they live; on the contrary, they are the ones for whom such stories are written. This bunch doesn\u2019t have to make do with a comb-over TV mountebank for a leader; for this class, the choices are always pretty good, and this year they happen to be excellent. Is Huma Abedin Hillary Clinton\u2019s Secret Weapon Or Her Next Big Problem? \\nThey are the comfortable and well-educated mainstay of our modern Democratic party. They are also the grandees of our national media; the architects of our software; the designers of our streets; the high officials of our banking system; the authors of just about every plan to fix social security or fine-tune the Middle East with precision droning. They are, they think, not a class at all but rather the enlightened ones, the people who must be answered to but who need never explain themselves. \\nLet us turn the magnifying glass on them for a change, by sorting through the hacked personal emails of John Podesta, who has been a Washington power broker for decades. I admit that I feel uncomfortable digging through this hoard; stealing someone\u2019s email is a crime, after all, and it is outrageous that people\u2019s personal information has been exposed, since WikiLeaks doesn\u2019t seem to have redacted the emails in any way. There is also the issue of authenticity to contend with: we don\u2019t know absolutely and for sure that these emails were not tampered with by whoever stole them from John Podesta. The supposed authors of the messages are refusing to confirm or deny their authenticity, and though they seem to be real, there is a small possibility they aren\u2019t. \\nWith all that taken into consideration, I think the WikiLeaks releases furnish us with an opportunity to observe the upper reaches of the American status hierarchy in all its righteousness and majesty. Bill Clinton now leads a sprawling philanthropic empire like no other. And yet it\u2019s hard to shake the sense that it\u2019s not all about saving the world. \\nThe dramatis personae of the liberal class are all present in this amazing body of work: financial innovators. High-achieving colleagues attempting to get jobs for their high-achieving children. Foundation executives doing fine and noble things. Prizes, of course, and high academic achievement. \\nCertain industries loom large and virtuous here. Hillary\u2019s ingratiating speeches to Wall Street are well known of course, but what is remarkable is that, in the party of Jackson and Bryan and Roosevelt, smiling financiers now seem to stand on every corner, constantly proffering advice about this and that. Citigroup bank chose Obama\u2019s 2008 cabinet \u2013 WikiLeaks \\nIn one now-famous email chain, for example, the reader can watch current US trade representative Michael Froman, writing from a Citibank email address in 2008, appear to name President Obama\u2019s cabinet even before the great hope-and-change election was decided (incidentally, an important clue to understanding why that greatest of zombie banks was never put out of its misery). \\nThe far-sighted innovators of Silicon Valley are also here in force, interacting all the time with the leaders of the party of the people. We watch as Podesta appears to email Sheryl Sandberg. He makes plans to visit Mark Zuckerberg (who, according to one missive, wants to \u201clearn more about next steps for his philanthropy and social action\u201d). Podesta exchanges emails with an entrepreneur about an ugly race now unfolding for Silicon Valley\u2019s seat in Congress; this man, in turn, appears to forward to Podesta the remarks of yet another Silicon Valley grandee, who complains that one of the Democratic combatants in that fight was criticizing billionaires who give to Democrats. Specifically, the miscreant Dem in question was said to be: \\n\u201c\u2026 spinning (and attacking) donors who have supported Democrats. John Arnold and Marc Leder have both given to Cory Booker, Joe Kennedy, and others. He is also attacking every billionaire that donates to [Congressional candidate] Ro [Khanna], many whom support other Democrats as well.\u201d \\n(Hilariously, in another email chain , the Clinton team appears to scheme to \u201chit\u201d Bernie Sanders for attending \u201cDSCC retreats on Martha\u2019s Vineyard with lobbyists\u201d.) \\nThen there is the apparent nepotism, the dozens if not hundreds of mundane emails in which petitioners for this or that plum Washington job or high-profile academic appointment politely appeal to Podesta \u2013 the ward-heeler of the meritocratic elite \u2013 for a solicitous word whispered in the ear of a powerful crony. \\nScandal at Clinton Inc. \\nThis genre of Podesta email, in which people try to arrange jobs for themselves or their kids, points us toward the most fundamental thing we know about the people at the top of this class: their loyalty to one another and the way it overrides everything else. Of course Hillary Clinton staffed her state department with investment bankers and then did speaking engagements for investment banks as soon as she was done at the state department. \\nOf course she appears to think that any kind of bank reform should \u201ccome from the industry itself\u201d. And of course no elite bankers were ever prosecuted by the Obama administration. \\nRead these emails and you understand, with a start, that the people at the top tier of American life all know each other. They are all engaged in promoting one another\u2019s careers, constantly. Architects of \u201cRegime Change\u201d Wars \\nEverything blurs into everything else in this world. The state department, the banks, Silicon Valley, the nonprofits, the \u201c Global CEO Advisory Firm \u201d that appears to have solicited donations for the Clinton Foundation. Executives here go from foundation to government to thinktank to startup. There are honors. Venture capital. Foundation grants. Endowed chairs. Advanced degrees. \\nFor them the door revolves. The friends all succeed. They break every boundary. \\nBut the One Big Boundary remains. Yes, it\u2019s all supposed to be a meritocracy. But if you aren\u2019t part of this happy, prosperous in-group \u2013 if you don\u2019t have John Podesta\u2019s email address \u2013 you\u2019re out. \\nRead more:'"}, "time": 1742564158.6505902}
