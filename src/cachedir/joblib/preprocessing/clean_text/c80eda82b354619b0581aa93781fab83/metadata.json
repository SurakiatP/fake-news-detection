A day after the assault injured 11 people, local and federal law enforcement agencies were searching for evidence to determine whether it was an act of terrorism and whether the assailant acted alone, while the large Somali immigrant community here denounced the attack and braced for a possible backlash. The attacker, identified as Abdul Razak Ali Artan, a   Ohio State student, was shot and killed by a police officer. The Islamic State, which has urged Muslims to carry out attacks in the West, released a   statement on its news wire, via the messaging app Telegram, that included the same stock phrases it has used in previous claims. Although there was no immediate evidence that Mr. Artan had declared allegiance to any terrorist group or claimed allegiance to one, the vast majority of attacks claimed this way by the Islamic State have eventually been shown to at least have been inspired by the group\u2019s propaganda. Shortly before the attack, the student had warned on social media about what he called mistreatment of Muslims, NBC News reported. If the United States wants \u201cMuslims to stop carrying lone wolf attacks, then make peace with \u2018dawla in al sham,\u2019\u201d Mr. Artan was said to have written on a Facebook page that has since been taken down, referring to the Islamic State\u2019s territory in Syria and Iraq. In the same post, he wrote, \u201cEvery single Muslim who disapproves of my actions is a sleeper cell, waiting for a signal. I am warning you Oh America. \u201d Mr. Artan was admitted to the United States in 2014 as the child of a refugee, his mother, and before that he lived for seven years in Pakistan, federal law enforcement officials said. Catholic Charities of Dallas said Tuesday that investigators had contacted the group because it had supplied \u201cshelter, clothing and other basic humanitarian services for a short time in 2014\u201d to a person who might have been a family member of the attacker. In Columbus, Mr. Artan lived with his mother, several siblings and possibly other family members crowded into a townhouse apartment in the southwest part of the city. Leaders of local mosques and Somali community groups said they did not know him or his family. On Tuesday, the police and federal agents could be seen entering and leaving the apartment, and questioning other residents of the complex. \u201cThey just seemed like a normal family,\u201d said Joe Brickner, a neighbor. \u201cThey always parked right here, that\u2019s the only thing weird about them,\u201d he said, pointing to a fire hydrant, \u201clike they didn\u2019t understand no rules. \u201d Mr. Artan, who was in his first semester studying management at Ohio State, earned an associate degree with honors this year at Columbus State Community College. Ohio State said he was 18, but investigators say there are conflicting records, and he might have been older. The university police said they had never encountered Mr. Artan before Monday, and local court records show no cases involving him. In August, he was featured in The Lantern, a campus publication, saying that he had not found a place for a Muslim to pray at Ohio State, and that he was afraid of how people would react if he prayed in the open \u201cwith everything that\u2019s going on in the media. \u201d He voiced a similar concern at Columbus State, a fellow student recalled. \u201cHe didn\u2019t talk a lot, but when he did, it was about his beliefs,\u201d and was at times \u201ca little preachy,\u201d said Myranda Thompson, a Columbus State student who was Mr. Artan\u2019s partner for a project in a sociology class. \u201cYou could tell he had a passion for his religion. I remember him being upset having to pray around here in the cafeteria,\u201d and a concern about how others would see it. Even so, \u201cHe was always smiling and seemed happy,\u201d and she had no sense that he might snap, she said. \u201cGoing to a bigger college like O. S. U. there were more people to pick on him he may have had a breaking point. \u201d Other Somalis and Muslims said this week that Mr. Artan\u2019s complaints about a place to pray, or an adverse reaction, rang hollow. \u201cIt\u2019s a nonsense excuse,\u201d said Mahamud Kassin, a math teacher in Columbus who graduated from Ohio State in 2014. \u201cEvery library has a place you can worship. \u201d Jibril Mohamed, a lecturer in Somali language and culture at Ohio State, and adviser to the Somali Students Association, said he had never encountered Mr. Artan, but he spoke with a student who was taking an accounting class with him. \u201cHe said he was a quiet, intelligent young man, he was the kind of guy who knows his content before class, he asks the right questions,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of a sudden for him to attack people and lose his life, it makes no sense. \u201d Over three decades, millions of people have fled Somalia, a country racked by civil wars and terrorism. The Columbus area has the   Somali population in the United States, after the  . Paul area, estimated by the Somali Community Association of Ohio at 38, 000 people. \u201cWe have not had any serious incidents up until now, so this is frightening,\u201d Mr. Mohamed said. \u201cMany of the young Somali people on campus are really scared. \u201d Nabeel Alauddin, a president of the university\u2019s Muslim Students\u2019 Association, said the attack worried him \u201cbecause it is getting to be increasingly challenging to be an American Muslim. \u201d But as a Buckeye, he said, he was angry because \u201cthis really was an attack on student safety. \u201d On Tuesday afternoon, three victims remained hospitalized, and one who was released recounted the attack at a news conference. William Clark, an emeritus professor of materials science and engineering, said he was among several people standing outside Watts Hall, which had been evacuated because of a fire alarm. They were about to   the building, when \u201cI suddenly heard a shout and then this tremendous crash,\u201d he said, as a silver car drove onto the sidewalk, and slammed into a concrete and brick planter. \u201cIt clipped the back of my right leg, and basically flipped me up in the air and I landed on concrete. \u201d Officials have said that Mr. Artan got out of the car and began slashing people with a butcher knife, and ignored commands by Alan Horujko, a university police officer, to drop the knife. The officer fatally shot him. \u201cI never heard the assailant say anything,\u201d Professor Clark said. The entire episode seemed to last just \u201c15 to 30 seconds,\u201d he said, but he and others, unsure if it was over, went inside and took shelter in a basement laboratory. He did not realize he had two deep lacerations above his right ankle until a student pointed out that he had left \u201cfootprints of blood all the way down the hall. \u201d The attack put the sprawling campus on lockdown for about an hour and a half, as people barricaded themselves in academic buildings and dorms. The claim of responsibility \u201cdoesn\u2019t prove that there is a connection to the Islamic State, but it increases the probability that there was one,\u201d said Thomas Joscelyn, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. In its propaganda, the Islamic State has stressed that supporters do not need to plan complex attacks, explicitly calling on them to commit violence with cars, knives or whatever else is at hand. Hours after the attack, Telegram channels run by Islamic State supporters referred to the assailant as \u201cbrother\u201d and used an Arabic hashtag that translates to #OhioAttack. The statement on Amaq, the Islamic State\u2019s news agency, said the attacker had acted \u201cin response to calls to target the citizens of the international coalition. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562644.5682812}
