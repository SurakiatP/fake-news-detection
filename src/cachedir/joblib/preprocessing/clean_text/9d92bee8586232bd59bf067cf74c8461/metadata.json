[Planned Parenthood awarded the former Democratic Party presidential nominee its \u201cchampion of the century\u201d award in New York City Tuesday evening as the organization held yet another celebration of its centennial anniversary.  The Hollywood Reporter noted that, in her remarks at the event, Clinton cited Margaret Atwood\u2019s 1985 dystopian feminist novel, The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. A new television production of the novel  \u2014   about a totalitarian theocracy that forces women to procreate  \u2014   can be seen courtesy of Hulu. \u201cTo paraphrase Margaret Atwood, \u2018We can never let them grind us down,\u2019\u201d Clinton said. \u201cIn The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, women\u2019s rights are gradually, slowly stripped away. As one character says, \u2018We didn\u2019t look up from our phones until it was too late. \u2019\u201d \u201cIt is not too late for us,\u201d Clinton added. \u201cBut we have to encourage the millions of women and men who support Planned Parenthood to keep fighting. \u201d Democratic National Committee (DNC) chairman Tom Perez also recently announced that his party\u2019s commitment to abortion is \u201cnot negotiable,\u201d and that the Democrat Party would exclude   candidates for office. Perez\u2019s autocratic remarks came after abortion lobbying group NARAL   America slammed the DNC for its embrace of Heath Mello, an Omaha mayoral Democratic candidate who had previously voted as a state lawmaker with his   conscience. \u201cThe actions today by the DNC to embrace and support a candidate for office who will strip women  \u2014   one of the most critical constituencies for the party  \u2014   of our basic rights and freedom is not only disappointing, it is politically stupid,\u201d fumed NARAL\u2019s president, Ilyse Hogue. In the wake of Perez\u2019s comments, many Democrats have attempted to correct the optic of their party\u2019s subservience to the abortion industry. While the party has attempted to portray itself as built upon morally upright virtues  \u2014   such as diversity and inclusiveness  \u2014   Perez\u2019s statement clearly indicates the opposite. Democrats are now \u201cnewly divided   \u2026     as they attempt to decide who they will welcome, and who they will exclude, amid soul searching over how the party should rebuild after its 2016 loss,\u201d observes Clare Foran at the Atlantic, who interviewed   Democrats such as Sens. Claire McCaskill (MO) and Joe Donnelly (IN) who objected to Perez\u2019s exclusion of   candidates. In a column at Jesuit magazine America, Robert David Sullivan also observed, \u201cAbortion is proving that the Democratic Party can outdo Republicans in  . \u201d The author continued: Abortion is now the single issue defining the Democrats, and Ilyse Hogue, the president of NARAL   America, is the de facto head of the party. This gives the Republicans a major advantage in holding off electoral losses if the Trump administration continues to founder. Realizing the potential threat of a divide in a party that is already struggling,   individuals such as Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards are attempting to smooth over the perhaps harsh reality that the abortion industry is running the Democratic Party. Richards appeared with MSNBC\u2019s Nicolle Wallace this week, reports Newsbusters\u2019 Katie Yoder. \u201cIs it difficult right now to be a   Democrat?\u201d Wallace asked Richards. \u201cDo you guys make it difficult?\u201d \u201cOh, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d she replied. \u201cAbortion is one of these issues that it is  \u2014   I think shouldn\u2019t be politicized. \u201d Yoder notes, of course, that Planned Parenthood donated $38 million to Clinton\u2019s campaign. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi  \u2014   known for simultaneously touting her Catholic faith and her   views  \u2014   also tried to soften Perez\u2019s dictum that all Democrats must promote abortion. \u201cThis is the Democratic Party. This is not a   party,\u201d she told the Washington Post, in response to a question about Perez\u2019s exclusive statement. Pelosi, however, also acknowledged her doubt whether, at this point in time, a true   candidate could ever win a Democratic presidential primary. She suggested, in fact,  Democrats lost in the 2016 election races because their   positions on social issues did not appeal to average Americans who ended up voting for Donald Trump. \u201cYou know what? That\u2019s why Donald Trump is president of the United States  \u2014   the evangelicals and the Catholics,   equality,  . That\u2019s how he got to be president,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything was trumped, literally and figuratively by that. \u201d The Post\u2019s Karen Tumulty, however, reports Pelosi\u2019s comment again drew the wrath of NARAL\u2019s Hogue. \u201cEncouraging and supporting   candidates leads to bad policy outcomes that violate women\u2019s rights and endanger our economic security,\u201d Hogue reportedly said in an email. Stephanie Schriock, the president of Democrat super PAC EMILY\u2019s List, also reasserted the importance of abortion as a major issue for Democrats at her abortion lobbying group\u2019s gala event this week. \u201cThey want us arguing about whether we\u2019re a party focused on elevating diverse voices or a party focused on appealing to the white working class,\u201d Schriock said, reports Roll Call. \u201cAnd, from what I can tell, a lot of people in the Democratic Party are happy to have that argument. Well, I\u2019m not one of them. \u201d \u201cI don\u2019t buy the argument that Democrats have to decide whether we\u2019re a party of   white men in rural America or a party of   women in the big cities, a party of immigrants or a party of feminists,\u201d Schriock said. \u201cDemocrats should be the party of working people. But we shouldn\u2019t make the mistake of equating \u2018working people\u2019 with \u2018white men. \u2019\u201d At the Planned Parenthood event, Clinton  \u2014   using the common euphemism \u201creproductive health care\u201d  \u2014   said about abortion, \u201c[A]nyone who wants to lead should also understand that fundamentally, this is an issue of morality. \u201d The abortion industry appears to have succeeded at turning its \u201chandmaid,\u201d the former party of the \u201cworking class,\u201d into one whose most cherished goal is ensuring women can end their pregnancies as they demand. Neither Perez nor the DNC responded to Breitbart News\u2019s request for comment.'"}, "time": 1742562671.9138713}
