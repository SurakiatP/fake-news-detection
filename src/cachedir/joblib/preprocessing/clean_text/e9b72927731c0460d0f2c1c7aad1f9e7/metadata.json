James and Clinton will appear together at a get-out-the-vote rally at the Public Auditorium in Cleveland, Ohio in the late afternoon. This will be James\u2019s first appearance with Clinton. In fact, a source says, the two have never met. James \u2013 a hero to many Ohio sports fans, especially in the African American community \u2013 could prove helpful to Clinton\u2019s effort to win the state\u2019s 18 electoral votes. While Clinton is handily beating Donald Trump among African American voters, she is struggling to gin up enthusiasm. According to the 2010 census, 53 percent of Clevelanders are African American. \\nThe stakes could not be higher. If Clinton can win Ohio, there is almost no scenario in which Trump can win. If Ohio goes for Trump, then he has a real shot of becoming president. As Ohio\u2019s biggest star (sorry, John Kasich), James has a lot of power to motivate people to get out and vote. It could be a difference-maker in a tight election. \\nJames\u2019 decision to stump with Hillary comes after other big-name celebrities publicly expressed their support for her campaign. Just days ago, musical power couple Beyonce and Jay Z held a concert in support of Clinton. The star power has spooked Trump\u2019s campaign, as evidenced by the fact that they are claiming the celebrities backing Hillary give her an \u201cunfair\u201d advantage. Trump, a man who once okay\u2019d a DJ calling his daughter a \u201cpiece of ass\u201d and who bragged about grabbing women \u201cby the pussy,\u201d went so far as to lament the language used in some of Jay Z\u2019s songs. \\n\u201cHe used every word in the book last night,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe used language last night that was so bad and then Hillary said, \u2018I did not like Donald Trump\u2019s lewd language.\u2019 My lewd language. I tell you what, I\u2019ve never said what he said in my life.\u201d \\nEye roll. \\nMeanwhile, in related news, Trump will be campaigning with his own star power tonight. The cream of the crop. The best of the best. The A-lister\u2026Ted Nugent. A man who once \u201c joked \u201d about shooting Hillary Clinton with a machine gun. \\n\u201cObama, he\u2019s a piece of shit. I told him to suck on my machine gun. Hey Hillary,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou might want to ride one of these into the sunset, you worthless bitch.\u201d \\nYeah, Trump sure seems concerned about what language musicians use. \\nFeatured image via Jamie Sabau/Getty Images Share this Article!'"}, "time": 1742564081.5988994}
