Peter R. Rose of the 94th Precinct in Greenpoint said, \u201cI deeply regret the statements I made last week about rape,\u201d adding that his comments \u201cwere not meant to minimize the seriousness of sexual assault. \u201d \u201cEvery rape whether it is perpetrated by a stranger or someone known to them is fully investigated,\u201d Captain Rose wrote. \u201cWe make no distinction in our response. \u201d The apology came days after the officer was quoted in an article on the local news website DNAinfo. com about an increase of sexual violence in the neighborhood of Greenpoint, where there were eight reported attacks or attempted attacks in 2015 and 13 last year. Of last year\u2019s cases, three led to arrests, but 10  \u2014   including two allegedly by taxi drivers on young female passengers  \u2014   remain unsolved. In the article, which appeared on Friday, Captain Rose told DNAinfo. com that while every rape should be investigated, the spike in reported assaults was \u201cnot a trend that we\u2019re too worried about\u201d because many of them had been committed by acquaintances of the victims. \u201cIf there\u2019s a true stranger rape,\u201d Captain Rose went on, \u201ca random guy who picks up a stranger off the street, those are the troubling ones. That person has, like, no moral standards. \u201d Not long after the interview, Captain Rose elaborated on the unsolved sex assault cases at a meeting of the 94th Precinct community council, where he said some of the attacks had involved   of the victims and others hookup apps like Tinder and thus were \u201cnot   rapes where strangers are being dragged off the streets. \u201d He added that the cases remained open because the victims refused to cooperate with investigators and in some cases left New York for their homes in other states. Both of his comments set off a firestorm of criticism from public officials and advocates for victims of sexual assault who condemned Captain Rose for perpetuating the idea that rapes committed by those who know their victims are somehow less troubling than those committed by strangers. \u201cRape is rape,\u201d Eric Phillips, a spokesman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, said in remarks published on Friday in a separate article on DNAinfo. \u201cThe crime merits no moral qualification and does not involve shades of criminality or degrees of danger. \u201d The same day, Stephen Davis, a spokesman for the New York Police Department, issued a statement saying, \u201cCaptain Rose\u2019s comments did not properly explain the complexity of issues involved with investigating rape complaints. \u201d The statement added: \u201cAll complaints of rape and other types of sexual crimes are taken seriously whether they are committed by domestic partners, acquaintances or strangers. \u201d Then on Monday, the city\u2019s new police commissioner, James P. O\u2019Neill, wrote a rare opinion article in The Daily News in which he called Captain Rose\u2019s comment \u201cinsensitive\u201d and said that they had \u201cleft the misleading and inaccurate impression that the N. Y. P. D. treats these types of cases differently. \u201d Commissioner O\u2019Neill continued: \u201cWe do not, either as a matter of policy or practice. \u201d In his article, the commissioner also said that only some rape victims report their attacks to the police, and he detailed a number of steps that the department has taken in recent years to change that. Those steps, he said, included collaborating with victims\u2019 advocates, sponsoring poster contests on college campuses to encourage students to report rapes and assaults, and creating a hotline so that victims can directly call the detectives who investigate such crimes. Commissioner O\u2019Neill did not say whether Captain Rose would face any disciplinary action. Reports of sexual assault have greatly decreased in the last 20 years. Quoting federal crime statistics from 2010 to 2014,  the Rape Abuse Incest National Network said seven in 10 rapes were committed by someone known to the victim. That was the argument of two dozen demonstrators who gathered in the snow on Tuesday outside the 94th Precinct station house to protest Captain Rose\u2019s statements, with signs reading \u201cTake Rape Seriously\u201d and \u201cRape Is Always a Crime. \u201d \u201cIt is an outrageous idea that acquaintance rape matters less  \u2014   it isn\u2019t just bad policy, it\u2019s bad law enforcement,\u201d Jane Manning, the director of advocacy for Women\u2019s Justice NOW. \u201cMost rapists target women they know because they\u2019ll have a better chance to get away with it by claiming consent. \u201cThe idea that acquaintance matters less is pervasive in our culture,\u201d Ms. Manning added. \u201cCaptain Rose was unfortunately saying something out loud that many, many people already believe. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563810.8487377}
