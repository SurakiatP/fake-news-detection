Putin of Russia, and on Friday she met with him in the Kremlin. Russian television broadcast images of Ms. Le Pen, gesticulating energetically across the table from a   Mr. Putin. Earlier, she called for \u201cdeveloping relations\u201d with Russia and \u201ccooperation\u201d in antiterrorism. Both were nods to her presidential campaign platform, which advocates closer ties with Mr. Putin, friendliness toward President Trump and rejection of the European Union. The meeting highlighted the potential for a general realignment of relations with Russia, even at a time when it has been accused of meddling in Western elections through computer hacking and the promotion of fake news, sowing alarm on both sides of the Atlantic.  The Trump administration has shown itself sympathetic to Moscow, to the extent that   contacts between the two sides are being investigated in the United States. In a crucial election year in Europe, campaigns are now peppered with parties and candidates that could sharply redirect ties with Moscow. Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s   challengers in Germany, on the left and the far right, tilt more easily toward Russia. The Five Star Movement in Italy, which presents a rising challenge to the political establishment if elections are held there this year, does as well. Then there is Ms. Le Pen, who Russian television reported had met earlier with parliamentary deputies in Moscow, while calling for the lifting of sanctions against Russia for its land grab in Ukraine. Mr. Putin\u2019s Russia has long been a source of aid for Ms. Le Pen\u2019s National Front. In 2014, her party received a $9. 7 million loan from a Russian bank Ms. Le Pen said French banks were shunning her party. The loan nonetheless drew condemnation from the governing Socialists as an unsavory example of foreign financing for a French political party. Denying any quid pro quo, the National Front was the only French party to approve of Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, and its officials have regularly called for the lifting of Western sanctions against Russia. National Front officials regularly visit Russia. From its earliest origins, the party has not been reticent about displaying an affinity for authoritarian leaders. \u201cI won\u2019t hide that, in a certain sense, I admire Vladimir Putin,\u201d Ms. Le Pen was quoted as saying in the Russian paper Kommersant in 2011. \u201cHe makes mistakes, but who doesn\u2019t? The situation in Russia is not easy. \u201d Her foreign policy positions in the 2017 campaign  \u2014   Ms. Le Pen is favored to win in a first round of voting on April 23 but lose in the second round two weeks later  \u2014   have a clear   tilt. Aides have praised Ms. Le Pen\u2019s ideological closeness to both Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin, saying she is well placed to form alliances with both. \u201cShe\u2019s the only one who can speak with both Putin and Trump,\u201d one of Ms. Le Pen\u2019s top lieutenants,   Lacapelle, said in an interview here two weeks ago. \u201cShe\u2019s got a privileged relationship with Putin,\u201d said Mr. Lacapelle, a longtime friend of Ms. Le Pen. \u201cYou can\u2019t be isolated when you\u2019ve got both Putin and Trump on your side. \u201d Asked whether the Le Pen campaign was in touch with Trump officials, Mr. Lacapelle would say only, \u201cThere are lots of things going on. \u201d In a fiercely nationalist speech to diplomats in Paris last month, Ms. Le Pen criticized the European Union, which she wants France to leave, for having \u201cmistreated\u201d Russia, calling Russia an \u201cindispensable interlocutor\u201d in the Middle East. Ms. Le Pen spoke of wanting to \u201canchor\u201d Russia to Europe, even as she heaped scorn on the European Union, which she said was \u201cfacing contrariwise to the rest of the world. \u201d \u201cEverywhere, globalization is in retreat,\u201d Ms. Le Pen told a group of bemused diplomats in a gilded hall in the fashionable 16th Arrondissement. \u201cThe Europe of peoples will be constructed against globalist dissolution,\u201d she said. \u201cI celebrate the renaissance of the European peoples. \u201d She \u201csaluted\u201d what she called Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201crealism\u201d and his \u201cdesire for change,\u201d while quoting approvingly Charles de Gaulle\u2019s dictum that states have \u201cno friends, but only interests. \u201d She insisted that the \u201csingularity of the world\u2019s populations is not soluble merely in the market,\u201d while denouncing the \u201clies of globalization and liberalism. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563859.2058177}
