And I agree sometimes it will revert back or sometimes maybe it doesn\u2019t come out \u2014 you have to be careful with it.\u201d \\nWhen exactly has Trump been careful with what he posts on social media? Try never. \\nMelania Trump, who was also interviewed, said that if she becomes First Lady, one of her primary areas of focus would be social media: \u201cWhat\u2019s going on is very hurtful to children, to some adults as well.\u201d \\nDoes that mean she\u2019ll take away Donald\u2019s cell phone and duct tape his hands to his sides so he can\u2019t tweet out hateful and hurtful shit the way he normally does? Yeah, good luck with that, Melania! \\nEarlier this week, the New York Times ran a two-page spread listing all of the insults and unkind postings Trump has made on Twitter since he announced he would be running for President in 2015. If you want to see a completely unhinged, uninformed, and unfiltered mind at work, just take a look at the Times article and recall what Hillary Clinton said regarding the Donald: \u201cA man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.\u201d \\nDonald Trump cannot be trusted with a smart phone, let alone the reins of power for the most important nation in the world. \\nFeatured Image Via YouTube Screengrab About Andrew Bradford \\nAndrew Bradford is a single father who lives in Atlanta.
