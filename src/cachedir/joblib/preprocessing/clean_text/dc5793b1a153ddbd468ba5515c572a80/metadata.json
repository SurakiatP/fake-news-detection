[\u201cWe got cocky and became arrogant and we also became bullies,\u201d the   told AFP.  Saldana, the face of multiple blockbuster film franchises \u2014  Star Trek, Avatar, and Guardians of the Galazy \u2014  says celebrities demonizing Trump only emboldened the voters who believed in him. \u201cWe were trying to single out a man for all these things he was doing wrong   \u2026     and that created empathy in a big group of people in America that felt bad for him and that are believing in his promises,\u201d she said. While she did not support Trump\u2019s candidacy, Saldana says, \u201cI\u2019m learning from (Trump\u2019s victory) with a lot of humility. \u201d She said she is hopeful that America under Trump will not become the racially segregated society that it once was. \u201cIf we have people continue to be strong and educate ourselves and stand by equal rights and treat everyone with respect, we won\u2019t go back to those times,\u201d Saldana said.

They might buy your CD or watch your movie, but you don\u2019t put food on their table. You don\u2019t pay their bills. \u201d Last week, actress Nicole Kidman said, \u201c[Trump is] now elected and we, as a country, need to support whoever is the president. \u201d Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson.'"}, "time": 1742561692.8765123}
