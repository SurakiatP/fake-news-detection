Last Friday, seven days before his departure from the White House, Mr. Obama sat down in the Oval Office and talked about the indispensable role that books have played during his presidency and throughout his life  \u2014   from his peripatetic and sometimes lonely boyhood, when \u201cthese worlds that were portable\u201d provided companionship, to his youth when they helped him to figure out who he was, what he thought and what was important. During his eight years in the White House  \u2014   in a noisy era of information overload, extreme partisanship and   reactions  \u2014   books were a sustaining source of ideas and inspiration, and gave him a renewed appreciation for the complexities and ambiguities of the human condition. \u201cAt a time when events move so quickly and so much information is transmitted,\u201d he said, reading gave him the ability to occasionally \u201cslow down and get perspective\u201d and \u201cthe ability to get in somebody else\u2019s shoes. \u201d These two things, he added, \u201chave been invaluable to me. Whether they\u2019ve made me a better president I can\u2019t say. But what I can say is that they have allowed me to sort of maintain my balance during the course of eight years, because this is a place that comes at you hard and fast and doesn\u2019t let up. \u201d [ Read a transcript of the interview with Barack Obama ] The writings of Lincoln, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Gandhi and Nelson Mandela, Mr. Obama found, were \u201cparticularly helpful\u201d when \u201cwhat you wanted was a sense of solidarity,\u201d adding \u201cduring very difficult moments, this job can be very isolating. \u201d \u201cSo sometimes you have to sort of hop across history to find folks who have been similarly feeling isolated, and that\u2019s been useful. \u201d There is a handwritten copy of the Gettysburg Address in the Lincoln Bedroom, and sometimes, in the evening, Mr. Obama says, he would wander over from his home office to read it. Like Lincoln, Mr. Obama taught himself how to write, and for him, too, words became a way to define himself, and to communicate his ideas and ideals to the world. In fact, there is a clear, shining line connecting Lincoln and King, and President Obama. In speeches like the ones delivered in Charleston and Selma, he has followed in their footsteps, putting his mastery of language in the service of a sweeping historical vision, which, like theirs, situates our current struggles with race and injustice in a historical continuum that traces how far we\u2019ve come and how far we have yet to go. It\u2019s a vision of America as an unfinished project  \u2014   a continuing,     journey to make the promises of the Declaration of Independence real for everyone  \u2014   rooted both in Scripture and the possibility of redemption, and a more existential belief that we can continually remake ourselves. And it\u2019s a vision shared by the civil rights movement, which overcame obstacle after obstacle, and persevered in the face of daunting odds. Mr. Obama\u2019s long view of history and the optimism (combined with a stirring reminder of the hard work required by democracy) that he articulated in his farewell speech last week are part of a   faith, grounded in his reading, in his knowledge of history (and its unexpected zigs and zags) and his embrace of artists like Shakespeare who saw the human situation entire: its follies, cruelties and mad blunders, but also its resilience, decencies and acts of grace. The playwright\u2019s tragedies, he says, have been \u201cfoundational for me in understanding how certain patterns repeat themselves and play themselves out between human beings. \u201d Presidential biographies also provided context, countering the tendency to think \u201cthat whatever\u2019s going on right now is uniquely disastrous or amazing or difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just serves you well to think about Roosevelt trying to navigate through World War II. \u201d Even books initially picked up as escape reading like the Hugo   apocalyptic   epic \u201cThe   Problem\u201d by the Chinese writer Liu Cixin, he said, could unexpectedly put things in perspective: \u201cThe scope of it was immense. So that was fun to read, partly because my    problems with Congress seem fairly petty  \u2014   not something to worry about. Aliens are about to invade!\u201d In his searching 1995 book \u201cDreams From My Father,\u201d Mr. Obama recalls how reading was a crucial tool in sorting out what he believed, dating back to his teenage years, when he immersed himself in works by Baldwin, Ellison, Hughes, Wright, DuBois and Malcolm X in an effort \u201cto raise myself to be a black man in America. \u201d Later, during his last two years in college, he spent a focused period of deep   and study, methodically reading philosophers from St. Augustine to Nietzsche, Emerson to Sartre to Niebuhr, to strip down and test his own beliefs. To this day, reading has remained an essential part of his daily life. He recently gave his daughter Malia a Kindle filled with books he wanted to share with her (including \u201cOne Hundred Years of Solitude,\u201d \u201cThe Golden Notebook\u201d and \u201cThe Woman Warrior\u201d). And most every night in the White House, he would read for an hour or so late at night  \u2014   reading that was deep and ecumenical, ranging from contemporary literary fiction (the last novel he read was Colson Whitehead\u2019s \u201cThe Underground Railroad\u201d) to classic novels to groundbreaking works of nonfiction like Daniel Kahneman\u2019s \u201cThinking, Fast and Slow\u201d and Elizabeth Kolbert\u2019s \u201cThe Sixth Extinction. \u201d Such books were a way for the president to shift mental gears from the briefs and policy papers he studied during the day, a way \u201cto get out of my own head,\u201d a way to escape the White House bubble. Some novels helped him to better \u201cimagine what\u2019s going on in the lives of people\u201d across the country  \u2014   for instance, he found that Marilynne Robinson\u2019s novels connected him emotionally to the people he was meeting in Iowa during the 2008 campaign, and to his own grandparents, who were from the Midwest, and the small town values of hard work and honesty and humility. Other novels served as a kind of foil  \u2014   something to argue with. V. S. Naipaul\u2019s novel \u201cA Bend in the River,\u201d Mr. Obama recalls, \u201cstarts with the line \u2018The world is what it is men who are nothing, who allow themselves to become nothing, have no place in it.\u2019 And I always think about that line and I think about his novels when I\u2019m thinking about the hardness of the world sometimes, particularly in foreign policy, and I resist and fight against sometimes that very cynical, more realistic view of the world. And yet, there are times where it feels as if that may be true. \u201d Writing was key to his thinking process, too: a tool for sorting through \u201ca lot of crosscurrents in my own life  \u2014   race, class, family. And I genuinely believe that it was part of the way in which I was able to integrate all these pieces of myself into something relatively whole. \u201d Mr. Obama taught himself to write as a young man by keeping a journal and writing short stories when he was a community organizer in Chicago  \u2014   working on them after he came home from work and drawing upon the stories of the people he met. Many of the tales were about older people, and were informed by a sense of disappointment and loss: \u201cThere is not a lot of Jack Kerouac   young kid on the make discovering stuff,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s more melancholy and reflective. \u201d That experience underscored the power of empathy. An outsider himself  \u2014   with a father from Kenya, who left when he was 2, and a mother from Kansas, who took him to live for a time in Indonesia  \u2014   he could relate to many of the people he met in the churches and streets of Chicago, who felt dislocated by change and isolation, and he took to heart his boss\u2019s observation that \u201cthe thing that brings people together to share the courage to take action on behalf of their lives is not just that they care about the same issues, it\u2019s that they have shared stories. \u201d This lesson would become a cornerstone of the president\u2019s vision of an America where shared concerns  \u2014   simple dreams of a decent job, a secure future for one\u2019s children  \u2014   might bridge differences and divisions. After all, many people saw their own stories in his  \u2014   an American story, as he said in his keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention possible \u201cin no other country on Earth. \u201d In today\u2019s polarized environment, where the internet has let people increasingly retreat to their own silos (talking only to   folks, who amplify their certainties and biases) the president sees novels and other art (like the musical \u201cHamilton\u201d) as providing a kind of bridge that might span usual divides and \u201ca reminder of the truths under the surface of what we argue about every day. \u201d He points out, for instance, that the fiction of Junot D\u00edaz and Jhumpa Lahiri speaks \u201cto a very particular contemporary immigration experience,\u201d but at the same time tell stories about \u201clonging for this better place but also feeling displaced\u201d  \u2014   a theme central to much of American literature, and not unlike books by Philip Roth and Saul Bellow that are \u201csteeped with this sense of being an outsider, longing to get in, not sure what you\u2019re giving up. \u201d Mr. Obama entered office as a writer, and he will soon return to a private life as a writer, planning to work on his memoirs, which will draw on journals he\u2019s kept in the White House (\u201cbut not with the sort of discipline that I would have hoped for\u201d). He has a writer\u2019s sensibility  \u2014   an ability to be in the moment while standing apart as an observer, a novelist\u2019s eye and ear for detail, and a precise but elastic voice capable of moving easily between the lyrical and the vernacular and the profound. He had lunch last week with five novelists he admires  \u2014   Dave Eggers, Mr. Whitehead, Zadie Smith, Mr. D\u00edaz and Barbara Kingsolver. He not only talked with them about the political and media landscape, but also talked shop, asking how their book tours were going and remarking that he likes to write first drafts, long hand, on yellow legal pads. Mr. Obama says he is hoping to eventually use his presidential center website \u201cto widen the audience for good books\u201d  \u2014   something he\u2019s already done with regular lists of book recommendations  \u2014   and then encourage a public \u201cconversation about books. \u201d \u201cAt a time,\u201d he says, \u201cwhen so much of our politics is trying to manage this clash of cultures brought about by globalization and technology and migration, the role of stories to unify  \u2014   as opposed to divide, to engage rather than to marginalize  \u2014   is more important than ever. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563218.007816}
