And another interesting development this weekend, there were massive marches across the country, people protesting. These were called tax marches. People demanding that President Trump releases his tax returns as presidents have routinely since Jimmy Carter. And that was the subject of a tweet this morning from President Trump. Let\u2019s put it up on the screen. The president apparently not liking those marches. He says, \u201cI did what was an almost impossible thing to do for a Republican, easily won the electrical college. Now tax returns are brought up again? Gillian, this president apparently thinks transparency is overrated. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742628597.4014819}
