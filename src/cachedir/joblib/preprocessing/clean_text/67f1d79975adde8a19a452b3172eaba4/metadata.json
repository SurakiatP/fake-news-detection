Trump voters, please think again. Sure, you\u2019re mad. I get that. But you don\u2019t burn down the house because you don\u2019t like the decor. \\n\u2014 Stephen King (@StephenKing) October 27, 2016 \\nTrump voters are lashing out after being used and abused by a Republican legislature that has disrespected them and their woes for eight years, funneling the money of the working class up to the richest Americans and passing no meaningful legislation. They have every right to be mad \u2013 but voting for Donald Trump is not the answer. Trump\u2019s \u201cplans\u201d for our nation will wreck the economy, undo all the progress of the Obama Recovery, and further divide our country along ethnic and racial lines. \\nBut it seems like most Trump voters don\u2019t want answers \u2013 they just want to be mad.'"}, "time": 1742561895.8518534}
