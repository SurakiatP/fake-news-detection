[The section has caused backlash from some users online who claim it to be \u201cinappropriate\u201d and  .   \u201cWhy did Google add \u2018Executive Orders\u2019 to my news feed? My feed is personalized. I will add what I want to add,\u201d complained one user in a post to Google\u2019s product forums. \u201cIt is unacceptable for Google to push crap I did not request into my personal feed. \u201d \u201cIt was added to mine also,\u201d added another. \u201cSuddenly Google cares about executive overreach? Stop forcing your agenda on me. I get plenty enough Trump news already. \u201d One user called the section \u201cWeird, inappropriate, and even a little creepy,\u201d while another complained: \u201cThis is so inappropriate, and google\u2019s response has been pathetic. \u201d Google News feeds typically feature sections under popular categories such as entertainment, science, and technology, but \u201cExecutive Orders\u201d appears to be new, with the URL for the section designated \u201c  \u201d. In June, Wikileaks founder and editor Julian Assange claimed Google was \u201cdirectly engaged in Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign,\u201d while leaked emails showed Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google\u2019s   Alphabet, had been sending campaign plans to Clinton\u2019s team as far back as 2014. \u201cWe should understand that Google  \u2026     is intensely aligned with U. S. exceptionalism,\u201d claimed Assange. \u201cPersonally at the top aligned with Hillary Clinton\u2019s election campaign and almost certainly once Hillary Clinton becomes president, those people in Google, like Jared Cohen, will be placed into positions around the new Clinton presidency. \u201d Google has not responded to a request for comment at the time of this publication.
