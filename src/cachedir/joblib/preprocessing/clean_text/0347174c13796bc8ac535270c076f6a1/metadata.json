Gabby Giffords in 2011 even though it has long been established that there has never been any evidence whatsoever linking Palin to the attempted assassination.  Palin tweeted that a journalist suggested to her on Thursday that the Times \u201chas fulfilled the two criteria for libeling a public figure\u201d \u2014  a reckless disregard for the truth and malice. She said she is \u201ctalking to attorneys this AM and exploring options. \u201d ( ) @nytopinion  \u2014   commonsense suggestion by a journalist, am talking to attorneys this AM and exploring options. BTW, wonder.. pic. twitter.   \u2014   Sarah Palin (@SarahPalinUSA) June 15, 2017,  ( )   \u2026    WHY someone would no longer be in public eye? Think constant libel  slander have anything to do with it?   \u2014   Sarah Palin (@SarahPalinUSA) June 15, 2017,  After James T. Hodgkinson, who supported Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) and hated President Donald Trump and Republicans, shot House Majority Whip Steve Scalise ( ) and targeted other Republicans as they were practicing for their Congressional baseball game, the Times decided to publish an editorial on Wednesday in which it falsely blamed Palin for the assassination attempt on Giffords: Was this attack evidence of how vicious American politics has become? Probably. In 2011, when Jared Lee Loughner opened fire in a supermarket parking lot, grievously wounding Representative Gabby Giffords and killing six people, including a    girl, the link to political incitement was clear. Before the shooting, Sarah Palin\u2019s political action committee circulated a map of targeted electoral districts that put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs. In addition, despite plenty of evidence to the contrary (Hodgkinson asked at least two Representatives whether the players on the baseball diamond were Republicans or Democrats before he started shooting) the Times added that \u201cthere\u2019s no sign of incitement as direct as in the Giffords attack\u201d As Breitbart    Joel Pollak pointed out, \u201cthe Times\u2018 false equivalence between the two shootings provides a sick excuse for what Hodgkinson did by making it appear to be partially Republicans\u2019 fault. That is worse than \u2018fake news.\u2019 It is an effort to exploit a horrific act of violence for the purpose of stoking political divisions, reinforcing the hysteria in which Hodgkinson was steeped. \u201d Palin linked to Pollak\u2019s article in a Facebook post and slammed the Times\u2018 \u201csickening editorial\u201d that attempted to \u201cdestroy innocent people with more lies and more fake news\u201d to advance the Times\u2018 preferred narrative at all costs, facts be damned: With this sickening NYT\u2019s editorial, the media is doing exactly what I said yesterday should not be done. Despite commenting as graciously as I could on media coverage of yesterday\u2019s shooting, alas, today a perversely biased media\u2019s   blame game is attempting to destroy innocent people with lies and more fake news. As I said yesterday, I\u2019d hoped the media had collectively matured since the last attack on a Representative when media coverage spewed blatant lies about who was to blame. There\u2019s been no improvement. The NYT has gotten worse.  \u2014   SP, As Breitbart News has extensively reported, hours after Giffords was shot on January 8, 2011, outlets like CNN immediately tried to implicate Palin. It turned out that Loughner, the murderer who killed six people and shot 18, did not have any political leanings whatsoever. He actually spoke to Giffords at a town hall event years before and may have been upset that Giffords brushed off his question with a  . In any event, authorities definitively concluded that Loughner was \u201cin no way influenced by Tea Partiers, conservative media, or Palin. \u201d After the Giffords shooting, Zach Osler, Loughner\u2019s friend, told ABC that Loughner was apolitical and did not even watch television. \u201cHe disliked the news. He didn\u2019t listen to political radio. He didn\u2019t take sides. He wasn\u2019t on the left. He wasn\u2019t on the right,\u201d Osler added. Another friend, Bryce Tierney, told   Mother Jones that Loughner was not political. As the   outlet noted: Tierney notes that Loughner did not display any specific political or ideological bent: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like he was in a certain party or went to rallies  \u2026    It\u2019s not like he\u2019d go on political rants. The Times\u2018 editorial was so outrageous and egregious that even mainstream media journalists, some of Palin\u2019s most vicious haters on the right, and those on the left like Chris Hayes agreed that the Times had to issue a correction. Yep. If editorial board has any intellectual honesty they\u2019ll issue a correction for the    claim. https:  .   \u2014   Jonathan Swan (@jonathanvswan) June 15, 2017,  On Thursday morning, the Times finally issued a correction that read: \u201cAn earlier version of this editorial incorrectly stated that a link existed between political incitement and the 2011 shooting of Representative Gabby Giffords. In fact, no such link was established. \u201d  '"}, "time": 1742562302.52659}
