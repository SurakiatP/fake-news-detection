C.  \u2014   The Trump Administration released it\u2019s fiscal year 2018 budget entitled \u201cA New Foundation for American Greatness\u201d on Tuesday morning which prioritizes money for defense, border security, law enforcement, veterans and school choice. [Documents previewed on Monday included a summary of the plan.  One document entitled \u201cA New Foundation for a Balanced Budget\u201d stated that this budget \u201cwill reverse the damaging trends from previous administrations and restore the American Dream. \u201d It asserts that under this budget, by 2027 \u201cpublicly held debt will be reduced to less than 60 percent of GDP, the lowest level since 2010, when the economic policies of the last Administration took effect. \u201d Mulvaney reinforced this in a Monday budget preview briefing. He said that the budget will balance in 10 years under this plan, \u201cthe concept we put in place is a general, what we call the   plan, which is that every single year we see those reduced by two cents on the dollar, every single year. \u201d The document emphasizes that there are no cuts to core Social Security benefits and no cuts to Medicare. Another document entitled \u201cA New Foundation for American Jobs\u201d laid out a vision for regulatory, welfare, and tax reform. The summary states that fiscal year 2018 budget projections include the Congressional Review Act resolutions that roll back certain Obama Administration regulations. This, the summary states, will generate \u201cannual cost savings of approximately $600 million to $1. 2 billion per year. \u201d The budget reforms the federal SNAP program for an estimated combined savings of $193 billion over 10 years. Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) reforms are estimated to save $21 billion over ten years. The OMB document states that total welfare reforms in the budget proposal will save $274 billion over 10 years. The tax reform element of the budget assumes several reforms laid out in the Trump Administration\u2019s recently released tax reform outline. This includes paring down tax brackets from 7 categories to three, cutting the business tax rate to 15 percent and making many small businesses eligible for the 15 percent rate. A third document \u201cA New Foundation for a Secure Nation\u201d laid out an increase in defense spending and spending on border security immigration enforcement. Defense spending would be increased by $54 billion or 10 percent more than the 2017 CR President Barack Obama signed into law and the 2018 budget cap. Border security and immigration enforcement is allocated $2. 6 billion for \u201cnew infrastructure and technology investments in 2018 to give CBP frontline law enforcement officers the tools and technologies they need to deter, deny, identify, track and resolve illegal activity along the border. \u201d The President\u2019s budget assumes passage of the   American Health Care Act AHCA as well as tax reform, though a tax reform plan is still being formulated. The full plan was posted to the Office of Management and Budget website at 11 a. m. eastern at the same time Director Mick Mulvaney began a briefing on the details. This is a developing story.
