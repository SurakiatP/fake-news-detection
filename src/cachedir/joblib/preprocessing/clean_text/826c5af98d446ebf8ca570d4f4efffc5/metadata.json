Upon perusal of the emails leaked yesterday in dump number 19, an interesting discussion surfaced, exposing how Muslims got in Obama\u2019s administration, and it\u2019s so unbelievable, you have to read it for yourself. \\nUnder the subject line, \u201c Asian American Candidates, Muslim American Candidates, \u201d we get some juicy insight into how these candidates got into the Obama administration. However, the first thing that should stand out like a sore thumb is the date of this email. October 18, 2008, was about 3 weeks before Obama was elected. Muslims were chosen to be in the Obama administration weeks before his \u201celection.\u201d \\nThe date indicates that Gayle Smith and John Podesta were staffing the Obama administration with Muslims weeks before Barack Obama was actually elected. This is not mainstream information, but Mad World News noticed that Obama was \u201ctransitioning\u201d to the White House long before the election even took place. Unfortunately, that is not the worst part of this email. \\nThe fact that Muslims were selected for the Obama administration before the American public voted for him is not a good sign, but it doesn\u2019t look like Obama chose these appointments either. He\u2019s not included in the conversation about who will be in his cabinet, leading skeptics to believe that this is all a setup. The date on this is September of 2008, well before Obama was elected. Note the highlighted areas where Christians are specifically excluded. \\nThe even more terrifying aspect of this email is highlighted. \u201cI excluded those with some Arab American background who are not Muslim (e.g., George Mitchell). Many Lebanese Americans, for example, are Christian.\u201d Those who selected Obama before the election handpicked Muslims for his Administration knowing he\u2019d be \u201celected.\u201d Not only that, they specifically excluded Christians. \\nThis particular email does not list a reason why Christians were excluded and Muslims were chosen specifically because of their religion, but with several more days of WikiLeaks Podesta email dumps, we may get some answers. But, that\u2019s still not all. The email also indicated that a list for Muslim DOJ and judges would come soon. \\nLater, in the email right before signing off, Preeta Bansal , an Indian-American lawyer who ended up in the Obama administration as the General Counsel and Senior Policy Advisor to the federal Office of Management and Budget from 2009 until 2011, says the Muslim list for the DOJ (Department of Justice) will be on its way soon. Not long after, the list of Muslim Judges and US attorneys to appoint will follow. \\nNow, we know how the Obama administration was packed with Muslims, but we still aren\u2019t sure why. Maybe they were hoping to avoid discrimination \u2014 or perhaps the reason is more sinister. Perhaps the infiltration of the US government with Muslims is a preplanned way to slowly allow the religion to permeate the West. Although that seems far fetched, this email is absolutely horrifying and nothing should shock us anymore after reading these leaked emails.'"}, "time": 1742561737.319856}
