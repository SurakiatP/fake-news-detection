S.[\u201cA group of anonymous keyboard warriors who claim they helped Donald Trump win his presidency have moved their fight to Europe and are trying to help elect a   leader for France,\u201d the radio programme\u2019s description reads.  \u201cIn 2016 politically and racially charged memes and symbols started spreading from U.

Front National denies any role in \u2018Great Meme War\u2019 A glass of half full milk is code for white supremacy  \u2026     and other shocking racially charged memes, Posted by BBC Trending on Monday, 10 April 2017, The BBC presenter says meme \u201cactivities\u201d miraculously \u201cstopped\u201d in November 2016, after the election of President Donald J. Trump, with the \u201csame accounts\u201d becoming active again in January 2017, \u201cthis time targeting France\u201d. According to the BBC, the \u201coperation\u201d has generated 50, 000 tweets so far, with right wing activists organising in online gaming chat rooms \u201clike their U. S. counterparts\u201d. The prospect that memes are merely the result of unorganised and unlinked individuals amusing themselves online is not seriously considered. \u201cThe \u2018Great Meme War\u2019 symbols and memes have travelled to France. But their influence cannot yet be quantified,\u201d concludes the film. The BBC does little to explain how such memes could influence elections, other than implying right wing politicians use them to \u201cconnect\u201d with young voters. The example of Florian Philippot is given, a   of the Front National and advisor to Marine Le Pen, who used a meme on his YouTube channel. He flashed the \u2018Risitas\u2019 or \u2018Spanish laughing guy\u2019 meme at the end of a video, which has been used by both left and right wing activists. Mr. Philippot\u2019s spokesman responded to the BBC\u2019s insinuation that using the meme might be racist. \u201cEl Risitas is not a symbol with a racist connotation that echoes the ideology of the far right. It is just funny,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742563101.1071742}
