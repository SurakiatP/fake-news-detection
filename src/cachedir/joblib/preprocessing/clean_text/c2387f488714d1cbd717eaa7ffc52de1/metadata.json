These are still reports from various insider sources, but if true, this would be a major factor in how much damage Hillary\\'s cover up did . \\nAuthorities now believe there is about a 99 percent chance that up to five foreign intelligence agencies may have accessed and taken emails from Hillary Clinton\u2019s private server, two separate sources with intimate knowledge of the FBI investigations told Fox News. \\nThe revelation led House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul to describe Clinton\u2019s handling of her email system during her tenure as secretary of state as \u201ctreason.\u201d \\n\u201cShe exposed [information] to our enemies,\u201d McCaul said on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d Thursday morning. \u201cOur adversaries have this very sensitive information. \u2026 In my opinion, quite frankly, it\u2019s treason.\u201d \\nMcCaul, R-Texas, said that FBI Director James Comey told him previously that foreign adversaries likely had gotten into her server. When Comey publicly discussed the Clinton email case back in July, he also said that while there was no evidence hostile actors breached the server, it was \u201cpossible\u201d they had gained access. \\nIf true, this is much more than possible, and it would explain the level of outrage within the FBI at the pass that Hillary Clinton has received.'"}, "time": 1742563813.2634957}
