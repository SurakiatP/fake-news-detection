[None of the different pieces of the conspiracy theory could hold up on their own, but journalists  \u2014   and the Hillary Clinton campaign  \u2014   treated the pile of Russia innuendo like a real monument. But then Trump made the move that forced them to tug at the foundations of their own illusion, and it crashed.  @joelpollak comes up with amazing new meme in @chucktodd interview #JengaJournalism https:  .   \u2014   TundraTabloids (@TundraTabloids) March 17, 2017,   In the past several days, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former Acting Director of the Central Intelligence Agency Mike Morell have both stated publicly that there is no evidence that the Trump campaign cooperated with Russia. But they held their tongues for months as the false accusations mounted against Trump. It was only after the president tweeted that former President Barack Obama had wiretapped him that they found the courage to tell the truth. Trump based his claim on the mainstream media\u2019s own reporting  \u2014   a point made by conservative talk radio host Mark Levin and then later at Breitbart News. The New York Times, the BBC, and others had reported that the Obama administration had carried out surveillance on people close to Trump. Furthermore, the Times reported that the previous administration relaxed the rules of the National Security Agency to disseminate the results of that surveillance, some of which was evidently leaked. The media latched onto Trump\u2019s claim that Obama had tapped his \u201cphones,\u201d as if that proved Trump was lying. But no one could dispute any of the core elements of Trump\u2019s claims  \u2014   until this past Thursday, when the Senate Intelligence Committee issued a short bipartisan statement: \u201cBased on the information available to us, we see no indications that Trump Tower was the subject of surveillance by any element of the United States government either before or after Election Day 2016. \u201d The committee\u2019s statement was interpreted by the media as a definitive conclusion  \u2014   though the investigation is ongoing. But if true, the only part of the story that has been debunked concerns surveillance of Trump Tower itself, a claim first made by the Heat Street website. It does not mean the warrant that Heat Street reported  \u2014   and which the BBC reported as well  \u2014   was never sought. That warrant, reportedly rejected by a FISA court, amended, and then approved, concerned a computer server. The New York Times also reported in October that the FBI had been investigating that server for \u201ca possible secret channel of email communication from the Trump Organization to a Russian bank. \u201d (The FBI found no evidence of any \u201cconclusive or direct link,\u201d which did not stop Democrats and the media from claiming there was one.) All the Senate committee did this week was confirm what Clapper had already said  \u2014   that there had been no warrant for surveillance of Trump Tower itself. So no \u201cphones,\u201d but the basic case still stands: there was surveillance of the Trump campaign, the results were shared widely within the government, and the intelligence made its way  \u2014   often illegally  \u2014   to the mainstream media. The people leaking the intelligence are happy to defend what they are doing, through surrogates like former CIA agent and presidential candidate Evan McMullin, who told CNN the leakers were stopping \u201ca security threat coming from the White House. \u201d Yet the mainstream media are behaving as if Trump\u2019s tweets about having his \u201cwires tapped\u201d are a very serious lie that undermines his entire administration. Having congratulated each other for exposing Trump on an entirely trivial matter, journalists are now using Trump\u2019s tweets to badger other Republicans, like UN Ambassador Nikki Haley. (How many Obama Cabinet members had to face such questions about their \u201ccredibility\u201d after he was caught spying on foreign leaders?) Moreover, in skewering Trump for claims about \u201cwiretapping\u201d and \u201cphones,\u201d the media are holding Trump to a standard of literalism they would never apply to themselves. For example, mainstream media headlines screamed for months about a \u201clove affair\u201d between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin: \u201cThe curious   love affair\u201d (CBS) \u201cTrump and Putin: A Love Story\u201d (New Yorker). But it turns out there is no evidence Trump had sexual intercourse with Putin. Liars! Nervous Republicans like Rick Santorum fret that Trump is \u201churting himself\u201d with his tweets. On the contrary: not only has he exposed the media\u2019s double standards, but he is also forcing them to impeach their own evidence. After all, if there was no surveillance of the Trump campaign, then there was no Russian collusion, and the media are simply \u201cfake news\u201d partisans. By tweeting about Obama, Trump moved the last weak Jenga block. Now the tower is wobbling. Your move, journalists. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.
