It is a topic that fascinates the Haggler, who can still barely fathom that for a mere $10 a month, he can get access to just about any musical recording on the planet. But which streaming app is the best? The Haggler has been mulling this question for a while, and after a lot of dabbling he regards Spotify as the gold standard. It is sturdy and remarkably fast when you play a song from the cloud, it starts so quickly it seems to be waiting for you. The system is also easy to use. Streaming services, at least to the Haggler, are all about creating playlists  \u2014   grabbing albums and songs and putting them in a place where you can find them quickly. That process is simple and intuitive on Spotify. If the system has a weakness, it is a    user interface, which is black and a Halloweenish shade of green  \u2014   a little too goth for the Haggler\u2019s tastes. Far more important, it isn\u2019t great at introducing you to new albums and acts. It has features and algorithms designed to help you find undiscovered music, but they aren\u2019t compelling or visually appealing enough to be much help. The Haggler winds up listening to the same stuff over and over. This is why the Haggler has been rooting for Apple Music since an Android version of it was unveiled in November. The user interface is gorgeous  \u2014   bright, airy and dominated by album art  \u2014   and it is the finest new music introduction system ever created. It\u2019s like a professional matchmaker who never sleeps. It is always trying to find you something to love. But for all its upsides, Apple Music for iOS has been criticized for randomly deleting both songs and playlists. On Android, though, the app behaves even more weirdly. It took the Haggler a while to figure out what was happening. Then, a few weeks ago, it all became clear: Apple Music is stoned. Not   stoned, either. Apple Music is fried. It has the kind of \u201cWhere am I?\u201d buzz that should worry its friends. To wit: When the Haggler tries to turn an album into a playlist, only half the songs make the journey. Or all the songs make the journey but there are three copies of many. Or two copies. Sometimes, inexplicably, the songs are arranged alphabetically. \u201cHeh heh heh,\u201d says Apple Music, or so it seems to the Haggler\u2019s ears. \u201cI\u2019m really high right now. \u201d You sure are! Just as bad, the system is supposed to learn what music you like, but no matter how many times the Haggler presses the \u201cI don\u2019t like this suggestion\u201d button on jazz albums, Apple Music keeps serving up Chet Baker and Bill Evans in a \u201cFor you\u201d list on the main menu. That\u2019s especially vexing because each time that button is pressed, up pops this message: \u201cGot it. We\u2019ll keep that in mind. \u201d But Apple Music forgets. Do you know why? It\u2019s totally baked. When someone consumes this amount of weed, for so long, it\u2019s time for an intervention, and fortunately Apple Music just completed one. On July 8, the company updated the program, promising a fix for an assortment of bugs. A fix for the iOS version was released a few weeks ago. The Haggler doesn\u2019t own an iPhone, so he can\u2019t comment on whether it has improved, though the \u201cMy music has vanished!\u201d online complaints do seem to have died down. But he is happy to report that on his Android smartphone, the fixes work. Since the program update, playlists have been rationally sorted. No more triple copies, no more alphabetized albums. So is it time to ditch Spotify? Not so fast. Apple Music is still missing essential features. It doesn\u2019t let users make and share their own playlists, \u00e0 la Spotify, which is how the Haggler got to know every song from the HBO show \u201cSilicon Valley. \u201d (Some fan of the show just made a compilation.) Apple Music also lacks crossfade, which allows the next song to fade in, over a customizable number of seconds, as the last song fades out. This is invaluable if you listen to music in part to block out the noise made by the rest of the universe. Also, while it\u2019s off recreational drugs, Apple Music is still balkier than Spotify, and is more likely to leave you staring at a spinning red line as it gathers its wits and looks for songs. And Apple Music has failed to streamline its playlist adding system. On Spotify, a playlist of Drake\u2019s album \u201cViews\u201d is automatically designated \u201cDrake  \u2014   Views. \u201d On Apple Music, when you create a new playlist, it has no idea what to call it. The name is blank. So you have to type it yourself. This isn\u2019t exactly hard labor. But it adds to the sense that Apple Music needs more tweaks. The Haggler contacted Apple, but the company would not discuss whether any of these tweaks were coming, because it generally does not discuss future iterations of products. What\u2019s odd is that Apple is the user interface master of the world. If anything, you would expect it to take the bar established by Spotify and then leap over it. Instead, at least in a few crucial areas, it\u2019s lagging. Yet recently, after a few hours of rummaging around the \u201cRadio\u201d section of Apple Music  \u2014   a bunch of shows curated by artists and D. J. s  \u2014   the Haggler fell hard for a fantastic indie band from Oklahoma called Broncho and its song \u201cClass Historian. \u201d On Dr. Dre\u2019s radio station, the Pharmacy, he was reacquainted with A Tribe Called Quest\u2019s \u201cOh My God\u201d which he hadn\u2019t heard in years. The \u201cFor you\u201d list last week included an album of Beethoven\u2019s string trios that the Haggler will never again live without. If only someone could splice together the best parts of Apple Music and the best parts of Spotify, and then subtract each of their flaws. Unlikely, yes. But the Haggler can dream.'"}, "time": 1742563299.0568373}
