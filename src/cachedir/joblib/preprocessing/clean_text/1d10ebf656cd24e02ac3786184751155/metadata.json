Over the past week, Mr. Parker generated one damaging headline after another as he appeared on \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d \u201cGood Morning America\u201d and \u201cThe Steve Harvey Show\u201d to promote \u201cThe Birth of a Nation. \u201d On Friday, The Hollywood Reporter summed it up in blunt terms: \u201cNate Parker\u2019s Failed Media Tour: Anger, No Remorse and Oprah\u2019s Advice Ignored. \u201d Fox Searchlight, having paid the highest price in its history, $17. 5 million, to acquire \u201cThe Birth of a Nation,\u201d which dramatizes the 1831 Nat Turner slave revolt, said it was too early to assess the film\u2019s financial picture. \u201cWe thought it could be a little higher, but word of mouth is going to be positive, which will allow us to string out to a good result,\u201d said Frank Rodriguez, Searchlight\u2019s head of distribution. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say we are disappointed,\u201d he added. \u201cThe Birth of a Nation,\u201d   Aja Naomi King and Armie Hammer, received an A grade in CinemaScore exit polls, Mr. Rodriguez noted.   made up roughly 60 percent of the   audience, he said. To what degree did the toxicity around Mr. Parker dent ticket sales? Mr. Rodriguez said that he was not sure. \u201cIt\u2019s a question that we\u2019ve been grappling with,\u201d he said. Hurricane Matthew, which hit Southeastern states over the weekend, appeared to have a limited influence on ticket sales. \u201cThe storm didn\u2019t damage it that much,\u201d Mr. Rodriguez said. Given its start, Mr. Parker\u2019s film  \u2014   even with strong word of mouth  \u2014   will be lucky to collect a total of $30 million at the domestic box office, analysts said. Under traditional accounting rules, theater owners would keep about half that total. In addition to the acquisition price, Fox Searchlight spent at least $10 million on marketing. \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d is not expected to generate much interest overseas. It tells an American story, and its stars are not well known outside of North America. (In contrast, Fox Searchlight\u2019s \u201c12 Years a Slave,\u201d which collected $131 million overseas in 2013, starred the British actors Chiwetel Ejiofor and Benedict Cumberbatch featured Brad Pitt and won best picture at the Oscars.) In some ways, the poor performance of \u201cThe Birth of a Nation,\u201d seen as a corrective to the #OscarsSoWhite maelstrom that consumed Hollywood over the past two years, both opens a corridor for and adds pressure to coming films about   experiences. \u201cFences,\u201d an adaptation of the August Wilson play starring Denzel Washington and Viola Davis, arrives on Dec. 25. \u201cMoonlight,\u201d a    drama centered on a young black man in Miami, has been set for an Oct. 21 release. (Joining \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d in failing to find a wide audience: \u201cQueen of Katwe,\u201d a euphorically reviewed and aggressively marketed Disney drama starring Lupita Nyong\u2019o that has taken in only $5. 4 million since Sept. 23.) For the weekend, the No. 1 movie at North American theaters was \u201cThe Girl on the Train,\u201d which collected about $24. 7 million, according to comScore, which compiles box office data. Distributed by Universal and produced by DreamWorks Pictures, a division of Steven Spielberg\u2019s Amblin Partners, \u201cThe Girl on the Train\u201d cost about $45 million to make. Based on the best seller by Paula Hawkins, \u201cThe Girl on the Train,\u201d starring Emily Blunt as an alcoholic who becomes wrapped up in a murder, received weak reviews and a   grade in CinemaScore exit polls, which could hurt it in the weeks ahead. \u201cMiss Peregrine\u2019s Home for Peculiar Children\u201d (20th Century Fox) was second, taking in about $15 million, for a   domestic total of $51. 1 million. Third place went to \u201cDeepwater Horizon\u201d (Lionsgate) with about $11. 8 million in ticket sales, for a   domestic total of $38. 5 million. Despite playing in 2, 105 theaters, Mr. Parker\u2019s film did not crack the top five.'"}, "time": 1742564472.5808082}
