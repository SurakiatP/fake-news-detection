[Mayor John Cranley announced, alongside Muslim, Jewish and Christian religious leaders, that his city would \u201cstand in solidarity with the immigrant community,\u201d and declare itself a sanctuary city, despite the threat of losing federal funding under President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.  \u201cThis city stands with immigrants,\u201d Cranley said during the live press conference. \u201cThis city stands with Muslims. This city stands with Syrian refugees yearning to break free. \u201d \u201cThis city opposes executive orders to halt refugee resettlement and targeting cities that are trying to live up to the promise of the Statue of Liberty,\u201d Cranley continued. Cranley\u2019s call to become a sanctuary city came just after the Trump Administration enacted an executive order to temporarily halt all refugee resettlement from select nations. Cranley said he supported Catholic Charities, which is contracted by the federal government to resettle refugees all over the country, citing that his wife\u2019s family are immigrants from Jordan. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio has come under fire for his sanctuary city designation after the NYPD released a previously deported criminal illegal immigrant, forcing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to launch an investigation to capture the suspect, as Breitbart Texas reported.
