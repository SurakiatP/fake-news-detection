[\u201cThe trip will underscore the commitment of the United States to our enduring alliances with Japan and the Republic of Korea, and further strengthen U. S.   of Korea security cooperation,\u201d said Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis.  \u201cPresident Donald Trump raised concerns during the campaign by asserting that some allies are not pulling their weight and by suggesting that he might not object to Japan or South Korea developing their own nuclear weapons if they do not pay more for U. S. military support,\u201d Stars  Stripes noted in reporting Mattis\u2019 travel agenda. CNN reports the trip is scheduled to last four days, and will include meetings with Mattis\u2019 opposite numbers in Japan and South Korea. There are currently about 50, 000 U. S. troops stationed in the former nation and 28, 000 in the latter. A defense official told CNN that \u201cfolks in Japan are very happy about the visit. \u201d Japan has been looking to improve its military capabilities to deal with potential threats from China and North Korea. The Japan Times reports that Mattis will meet with Defense Minister Tomomi Inada on February 3rd, after paying a courtesy call to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. During these meetings, Japan Times anticipates that Mattis \u201cmay request that Japan increase defense spending and expand the role of the   Forces abroad in line. \u201d Mattis and Inada are also expect to \u201cexchange views on China\u2019s island construction and military buildup in disputed areas in the South China Sea and North Korea\u2019s development of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles,\u201d as well as on a plan to relocate the U. S. Marine Corps Air Station in Okinawa. In South Korea, Mattis will likely discuss \u201cNorth Korea and the planned deployment of an advanced U. S. missile defense system known as the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system (THAAD) to South Korea\u201d with Defense Minister Han  . The Financial Times writes that THAAD deployment is \u201clooking increasingly in jeopardy amid political strife in Seoul and increasingly strident Chinese opposition. \u201d Said opposition recently took the form of punitive Chinese action against the South Korean conglomerate that owns the land where the THAAD system would be erected, prompting the conglomerate to delay negotiations. South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency predicts \u201c  for U. S. Forces [and] Korea may also be on the agenda, as Trump called for U. S. allies to pay more for the upkeep of the U. S. military during his election campaigning. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562334.4906893}
