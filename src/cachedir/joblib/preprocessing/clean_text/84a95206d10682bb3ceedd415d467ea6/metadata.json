Early voting has already begun in a closely watched special House election to replace former Representative Tom Price, who became Mr. Trump\u2019s health secretary, but in the suburbs north of Atlanta, few seem quite sure what exactly the party stands for now. \u201cThere are shades,\u201d Mr. Fitzgerald finally said as he considered what it now meant to be a Republican. \u201cCan I point to an individual and say, \u2018Here\u2019s your ideal conservative\u2019?\u201d He did not answer his own question, but he did not need to. Mr. Trump\u2019s takeover of the Republican Party has blurred the   ideological distinctions that defined the right for the past eight years. Driven more by personal loyalty and a ravenous appetite to win than by any fixed political philosophy, the   president has been received warmly by some mainstream conservatives. At the same time, even ideological   who share the president\u2019s pugilism but not his pragmatism have stuck by him because Mr. Trump has made the right enemies  \u2014   and gleefully ridiculed them with public insults rarely heard from a president. These loyalties have upended the Tea    divide, which has dominated fratricidal primary seasons since 2010 but increasingly has the air of fins on the back of a car, a quaint relic from an earlier era. With Mr. Trump in charge, the political market for purity on the right has been devalued. \u201cBecause of the loyalty that the most conservative voters in our base have to Trump, there\u2019s a pull there that\u2019s scrambling the ideological lines,\u201d said Andy Sere, a Republican ad man who has been heavily engaged in the party\u2019s internecine wars. \u201cHe wants wins on the board, and that\u2019s traditionally been the goal of the pragmatists. \u201d The shifting conservative fault lines are on display in the affluent and   northern suburbs of Atlanta, which were at the front end of the South\u2019s political realignment in the 1970s when they turned away from their Democratic roots and elected a loquacious young college professor named Newt Gingrich to Congress. The special election on April 18 has drawn substantial attention because one of the Democrats running, Jon Ossoff, has raised a remarkable $8 million, and his success in a   district could presage a midterm backlash against Mr. Trump. (Voters will pick from candidates of both parties on a single ballot if no one clears 50 percent, the top two finishers will advance to a runoff election.) But the way the Republican hopefuls are running is just as instructive. Even as they try to win over the sort of conservative activists dedicated enough to participate in a rare April election, the Republicans are casting themselves more as   pragmatists in the spirit of Mr. Trump than unwavering ideologues. At the forum and in individual interviews afterward, three of the Republicans in the   field invoked some variation of Ronald Reagan\u2019s maxim that it is better to get 80 percent of what you want than nothing at all. Few embraced the Tea Party moniker. And none of the   candidates pledged to join the Freedom Caucus, the   conservative group whose uncompromising ideology helped derail Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. One of the leading Republican candidates, Karen Handel, even wore her practicality as a badge of honor, citing not just Reagan but also Margaret Thatcher\u2019s \u201crelentless incrementalism\u201d credo. \u201cRepublican voters are expecting that we get down to business and deliver and do the job,\u201d said Ms. Handel, a former Georgia secretary of state, failed Senate candidate and failed candidate for governor. This time around, she said, the expectations from the party base have shifted. Bob Gray, who calls himself an outsider and is a businessman supported by the conservative Club for Growth, played to type at the forum as he twice criticized Speaker Paul D. Ryan for having \u201cfailed\u201d on the health care legislation. But in an interview, Mr. Gray allowed that he would have backed the   bill (which the Club for Growth opposed) shied away from the Tea Party label and sounded more like a   centrist than a   conservative. \u201cThis is the problem with D. C.,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody has retreated to their political corners with a jersey on. We need people like President Trump who want to go to D. C. and change the way they do business. The American people are tired of the bickering. \u201d Such remarks from a Club for   candidate would have been jarring only three years ago, but one Tea Party leader here said the change was the inevitable result of last year\u2019s presidential campaign. \u201cThe Republican primary voters rejected a purist ideologue when they chose Donald Trump over Ted Cruz,\u201d said Debbie Dooley, chairwoman of the Atlanta Tea Party Patriots. Ms. Dooley\u2019s frequently updated Facebook page is the stuff of a political scientist\u2019s dreams, a nearly   look at the shifting sands of the Republican Party at the outset of the Trump era. \u201cPeople began to want results, not platitudes,\u201d Ms. Dooley said, conceding her own \u201cevolution,\u201d as she called it. \u201cYou still have some who are still purists, but the Trump train has left the station. \u201d Republican swords have been sheathed well beyond this House race. Nine Republican senators are up for   next year, but there is little talk of the sort of primaries that terrified Republican lawmakers and convulsed the party during President Barack Obama\u2019s administration. What talk there is has come from Mr. Trump\u2019s backers, and is based on a perceived lack of fidelity to the president rather than on any ideological apostasy. Nowhere has the newly muddled nature of the party been more evident than in the fallout from the Republican failure to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Activists are angry over the display of dysfunction, but they are uncertain whom to turn their guns on. They will not blame Mr. Trump, because to fault him is to link arms with the left and an adversarial news media, a nonstarter in an era of tribal politics. Some on the right are tempted to point a finger at Mr. Ryan, a pillar of the   party establishment, but that approach has been complicated by Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to align himself with the speaker, both on the health care issue and more broadly. This leaves the Freedom Caucus. But these lawmakers, backed by an array of   outside groups, are some of the most dependably conservative members of Congress and were hailed for their steadfast opposition in the Obama years. \u201cFor eight years, the heroes in this movement were the Freedom Caucus members, and now they\u2019re suddenly in the bad camp?\u201d asked the Republican strategist Chip Lake, a touch of wonder in his voice. \u201cIt\u2019s really confusing right now as a Republican to figure out who\u2019s on first. \u201d To Republican veterans, the turn toward    politics on the right does not represent any sort of great awakening, just activists aligning themselves with the preferences of a new president. The   question is just how much Mr. Trump can tug the Republican electorate along with him if he decides to go further toward the center (or even left) than any of his Republican predecessors. For now, Ralph Reed, a longtime Republican strategist who lives just outside this congressional district, said the bedrock of the Republican base will not abandon Mr. Trump. \u201cThe guy who is enemy of our enemy can\u2019t be our enemy,\u201d he said. \u201cTrump is the only game in town. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562034.9771004}
