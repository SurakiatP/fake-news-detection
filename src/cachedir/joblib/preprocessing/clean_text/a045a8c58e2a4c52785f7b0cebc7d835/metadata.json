The crowd and the people that are behind him are unbelievable to see.\u201d \\nBut when Stephanopoulos questioned whether she'd physically get out there on the campaign trail and stump for Trump, she wasn't as confident: \\n\u201cWe will see. My priority is my son Barron and I support [my husband] 100% and I\u2019m there for him every time he needs me.\u201d \\nTrump was quick to interject, saying Melania would actually give two or three speeches soon, something that seemed to be news to Melania: Image Credit: Screenshot/ ABC News \\nTrump explained that her speeches would be \u201cbig\u201d and \u201cimportant\u201d: \\n\u201cShe\u2019s amazing when she speaks. She is an amazing public speaker. She\u2019s agreed to do two or three speeches, and I think it\u2019s going to be big speeches, important speeches.\u201d \\nIt's understandable if Melania isn't eager to give speeches on the campaign trail, given what happened at the Republican National Convention in July. \\nTrump's wife was publicly ripped apart after journalist Jarrett Hill pointed out the similarities between her speech and Michelle Obama's in 2008. \\nThough a side-by-side video comparison showed how certain passages were identical, Melania said she wrote the speech herself...with a little help from Hillary Clinton's former speechwriter. \\nDespite the controversy, however, many commended her speech as \u201cbeautiful\u201d and given \u201cwith tremendous poise\u201d\u2014 reflecting skills Trump's campaign may benefit from in these next two weeks. \""}, "time": 1742563133.5872662}
