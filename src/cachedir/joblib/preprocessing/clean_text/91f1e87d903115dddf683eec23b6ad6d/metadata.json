[Elias Velazquez made a decision to enlist in the U. S. Army after he graduated from Redlands High School, but his school\u2019s policy states that students cannot decorate their graduation gowns or caps except for California Scholarship Federation chords and sashes, KTTV reported.  \u201cIt means something really honorable to me, it\u2019s a whole new life transition to me,\u201d Elias said. Elias and his father are hoping the policy can be changed. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of defeating the purpose of achieving that greatness,\u201d Joe said. \u201cWe push our kids to strive and try to be better and do the best they can and then we tell them at their grad ceremony, \u2018We need you all to be the same because we don\u2019t want to hurt anyone else\u2019s feelings. \u2019\u201d His father, Joe, posted about the situation on social media to \u201copen community dialogue\u201d about the situation. \u201cWe\u2019re simply trying to open some community dialogue and get people to understand some rules are okay to change,\u201d Joe said. The Redlands School District said the reason for the rules is to promote fairness and has nothing to do with not supporting the military. \u201cWe are totally supportive of our men and women in the military. This has nothing to do with a lack of our support,\u201d a spokesperson for the district said. Although Elias says he is not happy about not being able to wear the sash, he is \u201ccommitted to following every order they give\u201d him since he is not one to stray from the rules. The school said that students can wear sashes during other graduation events and before and after the ceremony. A high school senior in Indiana was also told not to wear her Army sash at graduation May 25 because the school district wanted to focus on \u201chigh school accomplishments\u201d at the graduation ceremony. In 2016, a Maine high school senior was told by his school\u2019s superintendent that he could not display his Army sash at graduation, but could display it at the school\u2019s senior awards ceremony.'"}, "time": 1742561911.3728118}
