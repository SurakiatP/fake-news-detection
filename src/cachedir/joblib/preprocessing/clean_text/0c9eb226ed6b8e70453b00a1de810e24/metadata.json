By the way, were you paid $15,000 to be a thug?\u201d Republican nominee Donald Trump yelled at a black man from his lectern during a rally Wednesday evening in Kinston, North Carolina. \\nTrump went on suggesting that the man had been paid by Hillary Clinton to protest Trump. But it turns out, as usual, Trump\u2019s paranoia got the best of him and he kicked out his own supporter, a man named C.J. Cary who happened to be wearing a GOP badge and holding a letter supporting Trump but urging him to stop being so offensive. \\nWatch here via Raleigh\u2019s News & Observer: \\nThe News and Observer reported, \u201cCary says he wanted to deliver a note to Trump urging him to be less offensive and more inclusive to four demographic groups: black people, women, people with disabilities and college students. Cary, an African-American, says he\u2019s an ex-Marine who also worked in Afghanistan as a civilian for the U.S. Army.\u201d \\nThe irony is no doubt lost on the Trump crowd that this man came to urge Trump to be more inclusive of African Americans and he got called a paid thug and kicked out. So the answer to his plea seems to be, \u201cNever gonna happen.\u201d \\nCary was wearing a GOP badge and his letter slammed Hillary Clinton and President Obama. \\nLeave it to Donald to shrink his own tent even more. It wasn\u2019t enough that he tossed out a baby, now he\u2019s going after his few minority supporters. \\nSome things never change.\""}, "time": 1742563958.4801116}
