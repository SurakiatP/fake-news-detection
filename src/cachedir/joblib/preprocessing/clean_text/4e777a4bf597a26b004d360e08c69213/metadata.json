Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has touched on the issue as well, releasing a brief healthcare position paper . \\nBecause of Clinton\\'s role in the framework and selling of the Affordable Care Act, Priebus said that voters should reject Clinton. \\n\u201cThe best way to hold Hillary Clinton and Democrats in Congress accountable for this mess is to elect Donald Trump president and return Republican majorities to the House and Senate so we can pass patient-centered healthcare reform that won\u2019t cripple family budgets,\" he said.
