Heard \\nOur world is on the cusp of a new era. Traditional taboos are being smashed. Respect has become an old-fashioned word. Nothing is too low or too dirty to be ignored, overlooked or even applauded by some. \\nThe rise of antiestablishment popularism plays to the lowest common denominator and is potentially divisive and corrosive of values held dear for generations. We\u2019ve witnessed how a populist candidate spouting what he imagines the struggling sectors want to hear has not only lowered the tone but has dragged many of his supporters and rivals down to the same level. \\nThe American political sphere has turned into a swamp of muckraking, hatred of the other and threats of violence to the extent that white supremacist militias are preparing to attack African Americans if their candidate doesn\u2019t make the White House. \\nIt\u2019s suddenly okay for the son of one to announce the former head of the Ku Klux Klan \u201cdesperately needs a bullet in the head.\u201d What happened to judicial process? On the other hand Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton cynically attempted to woo African Americans by appearing on the stage with her new buddies, celebrity black rappers. \\nRobert de Niro\u2019s video urging voters not to support Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, adding he would love to punch him in the face went viral. Trump supporters claim they are a \u2018movement\u2019 and threaten revolution if he fails to win an election they believe may be \u2018rigged.\u2019 Republicans anxious to keep their grip on Congress have threatened to block Clinton\u2019s initiatives at every turn. \\nEven the feuding Justice Department and the FBI aren\u2019t exempt from the ire. Both are being hit by accusations of interfering in the political process. The country that\u2019s stood as the greatest example of democracy and the rule of law is gradually embracing the law of the jungle. I\u2019m amazed that most Americans see nothing amiss about their president, his wife and his vice-president spending days stumping for their candidate. Isn\u2019t a US president supposed to represent all Americans? \\nThere are echoes within the UK where politicians still quarrel over the validity of a referendum over Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. The High Court\u2019s judgment to the effect that the prime minister doesn\u2019t have the authority to take the country out without a parliamentary vote has resulted in media attacks on judges whose reputations were formerly unassailable. I may be wrong but I don\u2019t recall such venom directed at the judiciary throughout my lifetime. \\nTabloid headlines scream \u201cWho do you think you are? \u201cThe judges versus the people\u201d and the Daily Mail has gone as far as to post photographs of three judges referring to them as \u201cEnemies of the People,\u201d describing one as being \u201copenly gay.\u201d This is nothing short of an attack on democracy\u2019s checks and balances. \\nThe High Court has pronounced on a legal point, not on the pros and cons of Brexit. The government has the right to appeal in the Supreme Court but UK Prime Minister Theresa May has indicated she will proceed with triggering Article 50 come what may. \\nCharles Falconer writing in The Guardian was right to assert \u201cthe judiciary is a vital pillar of our constitution. The government must defend it from these unconscionable attacks\u2014or put all our freedoms at risk.\u201d \\nGina Miller, an activist who lodged the legal challenge is now receiving online death threats! Britons posting on Facebook have called for her \u201cto be shot or hung.\u201d \\nPopulist leaders tap in to people\u2019s basest instincts. They are not reliant on knowledge of how the world works or of experience but rather on personal charisma and the power of persuasion. They inspire devoted followings blind to their transgressions which gives them a sense of power and infallibility. \\nWe\u2019ve seen the rise of rank outsiders in the Philippines and Indonesia whose rhetoric and policies defy all norms. \\nThis \u2018anything goes\u2019 trend fuelled by fear and economic grievances is a slippery slope reminiscent of Germany in the early 1930s when Hitler wasn\u2019t viewed as the monster he was but as a saviour from a brutal economic depression resulting in worthless currency and unemployment in the millions. He mesmerised crowds as he vowed to make Germany strong again. Perhaps it\u2019s time that lessons were learnt before there\u2019s no going back. \\nLinda S.
