It found Jews are \u201cincreasingly concerned for their safety due to everyday experiences of  \u201d as the number surveyed who agreed with   statements rose from 28 per cent in 2014 to 40 per cent in 2016.

About 200, 000 Jews live in Germany, Europe\u2019s third largest community after Britain and France, up from only about 15, 000 who survivied after the end of the Nazi Third Reich. \u201cForty percent agree with   \u201d Green Party member of the Bundestag Volker Beck told DW. \u201cThat\u2019s almost half of the society.

Previous analysis of crime figures had put the number of   cases in 2015 at 1, 366, but closer analysis revealed that crimes such as the smashing of headstones in Jewish ceremonies, or starting fires at synagogues had been incorrectly classified as criminal damage or attempted arson in some states, with no mention made of the   nature of the crimes.
