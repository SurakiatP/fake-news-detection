Katie Ledecky, the most dominant female swimmer in Rio, demolished her own record in the   freestyle. Ledecky finished the 400 with a time of 3 minutes 56. 46 seconds. Ledecky\u2019s historic performance fired up the U. S. men\u2019s 4x100 relay team, which added Michael Phelps to the mix on race day. That move paid off when Phelps swam an incredible second leg in 47. 12, which his coach Bob Bowman said was one of his   fastest, to lead the Americans to victory over France. The gold was Phelps\u2019s   19th. He\u2019s sure to add more in these Games. Follow us here for the latest updates on our Olympics coverage. In the first big surprises of the Olympic tennis tournament, Novak Djokovic, the world\u2019s dominant tennis player, and the doubles team of Venus and Serena Williams were upset in the first round. Djokovic had made the Olympic gold medal in singles one of his big priorities for 2016. He could not make it past the first round, and when it was over, both he and his conqueror, Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro, were in tears in Rio de Janeiro. In a raucous atmosphere on center court at the Olympic Tennis Center, Del Potro produced one of the most remarkable performances of his career: upsetting Djokovic,   (4)   (2). The Williamses lost,     to the Czech team of Barbora Strycova and Lucie Safarova. The defeat was the Williams sisters\u2019 first loss playing together at the Olympics. They won the gold medal in 2000, 2008 and 2012, and Sunday\u2019s surprise defeat came against a team that had never won a match together.  \u2014   CHRISTOPHER CLAREY How to Watch: NBC broadcasts on a tape delay, but you can stream all the events here. The Dutch cyclist Annemiek van Vleuten was involved in a spectacular crash near the end of the women\u2019s road race at the Olympics on Sunday, suffering a concussion and fracturing her spine. Van Vleuten was leading the race by 40 seconds about 12 miles from the finish and was heading downhill when she failed to negotiate a turn, hit the curb and tumbled over her handlebars, landing on her head. The Dutch team said that van Vleuten had suffered a concussion. She was in stable condition in the intensive care unit of a Rio de Janeiro hospital. \u201cAnnemiek went through a total CT scan and is stable now,\u201d said the team\u2019s chief medical officer, Cees Rein van den Hoogenband. \u201cNo internal bleedings or damage.

She also suffers from three minor fractures in her lumbar spine. \u201d  \u2014   VICTOR MATHER Simone Biles lived up to her reputation as the world\u2019s greatest gymnast in her first day of competition. In the qualifying competition, Biles had the highest score, ahead of her teammates Aly Raisman and Gabby Douglas. She was also first in three apparatus  \u2014   the floor exercise, the balance beam and the vault. And the American team also finished in first place. The team competition is Tuesday.

The defending champion Dana Vollmer, who returned to competition last summer after the birth of her first child, won the bronze. She was trying to become the first mother from the United States to win an individual swimming gold. Paralympics officials have done what Olympics officials chose not to do, barring all Russian athletes from their Games after an elaborate cheating scheme. Speaking on Sunday in Rio de Janeiro, the head of the International Paralympic Committee, Philip Craven, decried Russia\u2019s \u201cthirst for glory\u201d and \u201cmedals over morals\u201d mentality, calling the     of doping among Russia\u2019s top disabled athletes \u201cabominable. \u201d  \u2014   Rebecca Ruiz Miles   the flamboyant American world champion with the distinction of having a fencing move named after him, was beaten by Artur Akhmatkhuzin of Russia,   in the round of 32 of the men\u2019s foil on Sunday morning.   tried his signature move, in which he whips his sword around the back of his head or back, four times but did not score with it. He will still compete in the team event on Friday as part of a strong American team that will be a medal contender.  \u2014   Victor Mather Blowout Alert: It was expected to be a blowout. It was. The American women\u2019s basketball team got its Olympics underway against Senegal. The final score was  . Breanna Stewart, Sylvia Fowles and Diana Taurasi each had 15 points for the United States. First for Kosovo: Competing as an independent nation in the Olympics for the first time, Kosovo did not wait long for its first gold medal. Majlinda Kelmendi won the women\u2019s   judo competition. Some will tell you the first several days of the Summer Olympics are all about the pool. (The Australians have learned to swim again! Michael Phelps is still around! And so are Ryan Lochte\u2019s abs!) There are a bevy of stars, and more medal ceremonies than you can handle. And of course, the smell of chlorine really brings you back to your childhood. But if you are in Rio for the Games (or even are watching from home) do what the locals do: Go to the beach. In a feat of intrepid reporting, John Branch spent the entire day and night at Copacabana Beach on Saturday, listening to the waves and watching Olympic athletes play in the sand.
