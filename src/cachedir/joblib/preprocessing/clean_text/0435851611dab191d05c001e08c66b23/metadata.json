[\u201cHe represents an existential threat to legal abortion in the United States and must never wear the robes of a Supreme Court justice,\u201d an online statement from NARAL read.  Other   organizations agreed. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s nominee, Neil Gorsuch, has an alarming history of interfering with reproductive rights and health. He ruled that bosses should be able to deny women access to birth control coverage,\u201d wrote Planned Parenthood CEO Cecile Richards in a fundraising letter calling for supporters to donate. The   organization also debuted a hashtag #NoRoeNoGo for activists to share. Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune, described Gorsuch as \u201cmore extreme than Justice Scalia. \u201d \u201cGorsuch has proven himself hostile to environmental protection, women\u2019s rights, and the rights of workers and cannot be trusted to protect our air, our water, or our communities,\u201d he said in a statement. Climate change alarmist group NextGen also opposed Gorsuch\u2019s nomination in a statement from billionaire funder Tom Steyer. \u201cIn light of Trump\u2019s despotic tendencies and Russia\u2019s role in his election, the Senate must reject any nominee whose allegiance to our Constitution and our most fundamental rights is in doubt,\u201d he wrote in a statement.'"}, "time": 1742563556.7019863}
