Share on Facebook \\nHere we go with the liberal left\u2019s latest boogeyman \u201cfake news\u201d . \\nLet\u2019s find anything, absolutely anything to blame on Hillary\u2019s election loss\u2026blame it on Putin, on not getting their way, on Brexit, on Farage, on not having enough safe spaces, on all the apparent injustices of the world. Now let\u2019s blame it on the \u201cfake news\u201d. \\nWTF is \u201cfake news\u201d even mean. The politically correct, crying liberal masses are reaching a point of stupid, that is beyond compare in the history of mankind. \\n\u201cFake news\u201d is right on up there with WMDs, barrel bombs, mansplaining, color revolutions, humanitarian wars, moderate rebels, gender fluidity, the patriarchy\u2026all made up, destructive apparitions engineered to avoid confronting the man in the mirror. \\nHere we go with the lying establishment media, and the \u201csocially responsible\u201d social media tech giants jumping on board censorship in disguise, telling the world what they should or should not read. Book burning for a digital age. \\nGoogle\u2019s chief executive Sundar Pichai will \u201cdo no evil\u201d , saying it is important for Google and other social media businesses to promote \u201caccurate\u201d stories to their billions of users \u2026and Pichai is just the man to judge what is \u201creal news\u201d and what is \u201cfake news\u201d, because we the deplorables have neither the brains, nor the judgement, to discern between right and wrong, real and fake. \\nThank God for the liberal left, and their neo-liberal value system, to help us plebiscites make sense of such a mixed up world. \\nWe got conned into supporting Trump because the \u201cfake news\u201d seemed so real and was so enticing that we completely fell for it, and in the process prevented the the peace loving, saintly Hillary Clinton from keeping America great. \\nTalking to the BBC\u2019s Economics editor Kamal Ahmed in the wake of fake news controversies during the US election campaign, Mr Pichai said the firm had made some mistakes. \\n\u201cThere have been a couple of incidences where\u2026 we didn\u2019t get it right.\u201d \\n\u201cIt is a learning moment for us and we will definitely work to fix it.\u201d \""}, "time": 1742564365.2904267}
