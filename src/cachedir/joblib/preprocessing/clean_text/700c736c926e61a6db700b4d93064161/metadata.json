In the long run, it is an inevitability.\\nThough major asteroids big enough to wipe out life across the entire planet are rare, scientists believe they have taken place and reset entire epochs. Moreover, smaller asteroids, comets or meteors can all do major damage, even if they aren\u2019t record breaking hunks of space rock.\\nvia the UK Metro :\\nWhen American government representatives asked NASA head Charles Boden what the best response to a large asteroid headed for New York City would be, his answer was simple: \u2018Pray.\u2019\\nBut what would happen if a smaller asteroid hit Los Angeles?\\nDescribing the scenario as a \u2018not if \u2013 but when,\u2019 NASA recently simulated what would happen if a 300 to 800ft asteroid approached Los Angeles with an 100% chance of impact. \\n\u2018It\u2019s not a matter of if \u2013 but when \u2013 we will deal with such a situation,\u2019 said Thomas Zurbuchen, Associate Administrator for NASA\u2019s Science Mission Directorate in Washington. \\n\u2018But unlike any other time in our history, we now have the ability to respond to an impact threat through continued observations, predictions, response planning and mitigation.\u2019 \\nWhat will it mean for civilization as we know it? There is a definite threat of an existential crisis that would change the planet over night \u2013 though the chances are extremely low, there is still a chance.\\nHow much warning would we have? We could have as little as three days warning of an asteroid which would blast London with the power of a hydrogen bomb. \\nAnd it\u2019s possible that we might have no warning at all \u2013 at least with a smaller asteroid capable of shattering windows across the city. \\n[\u2026]\\nBigger asteroids could cause nearly unimaginable damage \u2013 wiping out many species and plunging Earth into a bleak winter lasting for years \u2013 although the larger an asteroid is, the more warning we would have of its approach. \\n\u2018The high degree of initial uncertainty coupled with the relatively long impact warning time made this scenario unique and especially challenging for emergency managers,\u2019 said FEMA National Response Coordination Branch Chief Leviticus A. Lewis. \\nOn the other hand, really big asteroid are routinely monitored and there are several known \u2018big ones\u2019 that will approach in the next decade or so\u2026 and while they might be headed for the planet, space agencies aren\u2019t planning to take it lying down, instead, they have a plan to exploit it as a major opportunity, born perhaps, out of an unavoidable risk they hope to mitigate.\\nNow that researchers are getting good at spotting these objects and tracking their path, scientists are beginning to formulate workable strategies for knocking any incoming asteroids off their trajectories and even \u2018catching\u2019 them in Earth\u2019s orbit to mine and exploit.\\nThis man on stage at a Ted Talk explains what is at stake:\\nPhil Plait: How to defend Earth from asteroids \\n\\nYes, asteroid defense is now a major enterprise, and somewhere in the shadows a team is gearing up to outdo the casts of Armageddon and Deep Impact combined.\\nWhen asteroids do hit, the damage they can do is unimaginably catastrophic \u2013 and can easily dwarf the power of a nuclear detonation, depending upon the size of the incoming rock.\\nBut what is perhaps worse than a rock that could pack the punch of \u201c3 billion nukes\u201d is one that is just big enough to destroy a major area, but too small for NASA or other groups to track effectively. In fact, the latter scenario happens all the time \u2013 not long ago, a big enough meteor hit and NASA had no idea until it was too late.\\nWill they catch the one that counts? And will anyone be ready if they don\u2019t?\\nRead more: \\nNASA Plan to Protect Planet Hopes \u201cNuclear Blast Could Nudge Large Asteroid Off Course\u201d \\nImpact?
