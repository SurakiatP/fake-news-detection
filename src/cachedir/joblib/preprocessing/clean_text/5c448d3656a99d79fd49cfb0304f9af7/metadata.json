Here\u2019s what you need to know: \u2022 President Trump\u2019s immigration order barring refugees and citizens of seven countries from entering the United States unleashed chaos on the U. S. immigration system, prompting continuing protests and legal action, much of it by lawyers working   at airport arrival halls. A White House official appeared to reverse part of the order, saying that green card holders from the barred countries  \u2014   Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen  \u2014   would be allowed to enter \u201cgoing forward. \u201d Here\u2019s what we know and don\u2019t know about the executive order. And here\u2019s our full coverage of the Trump administration. _____ \u2022 Several European leaders rejected the refugee ban in blunt terms, and an array of Christian leaders denounced provisions that would favor Christian immigrants as discriminatory, misguided and inhumane. Even some top Republicans objected. Mr. Trump appeared to have more pleasant exchanges with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Australia\u2019s prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, who hoped for reassurance that the U. S. would honor the refugee resettlement deal struck with the Obama administration. _____ \u2022 Myanmar was shaken by a rare and brazen assassination. The country\u2019s most prominent Muslim lawyer, U Ko Ni, was shot dead at the airport in Yangon, after returning with a government delegation from a trip to Indonesia. He appeared to have been shot while in his family car, while holding his grandchild. A suspect was arrested, but no motive was immediately evident. _____ \u2022 As Japan moves to accommodate Emperor Akihito\u2019s wish to give up the throne, many Japanese believe it is also time to clear the way for a woman to reign. It has been nearly 250 years since Japan had an empress. \u201cLike Queen Elizabeth in England, if Princess Aiko becomes the emperor, things may change in society,\u201d a woman in Kanagawa Prefecture said. _____ \u2022 And Roger Federer, 35, became the oldest man to win a Grand Slam singles title in 45 years by defeating his longtime rival, Rafael Nadal, in an epic   final of the Australian Open. It was Federer\u2019s record 18th tournament championship and his first since 2012. The victory came a day after Serena Williams, 35, defeated her sister Venus, 36, for her   23rd Grand Slam singles title, becoming the oldest female Australian Open winner in the current era. \u2022 Hong Kong\u2019s monetary office says the city needs as many as 400 million more bank notes in circulation to handle Lunar New Year transactions and lai see distribution, which is valued at $1 billion. \u2022 Toshiba\u2019s   from its   investment in a U. S. construction firm focused on nuclear power projects could rise to $4 billion to $7 billion, enough to put the    company\u2019s future at risk. \u2022 Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets. \u2022 Three people were killed when a boat carrying 31 people capsized in Sabah, Malaysia.   people, mostly Chinese tourists, have been rescued. [Bernama] \u2022 The Philippine government\u2019s free distribution of birth control has pitted President Rodrigo Duterte against the Catholic Church, and not for the first time. [The New York Times] \u2022 An American commando was killed in a raid on Qaeda militants in Yemen, the first counterterrorism operation approved by President Trump. [The New York Times] \u2022  North Korea appears to have resumed operation of a reactor used to produce plutonium for its nuclear weapons program, the think tank 38 North said. [Reuters] \u2022 The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, weighed in on a contentious issue, saying the U. S. Embassy \u201cneeds to be\u201d in Jerusalem. \u201cAll embassies should come here,\u201d he said. [The New York Times] \u2022 Thousands of Mongolians protested for the second time this winter to demand that the government address choking air pollution in the capital, Ulan Bator. [Associated Press] \u2022 Taliban militants are tapping new revenues sources beyond the opium trade, including collecting utility bills, as they take over increasingly large areas of Afghanistan. [The New York Times] \u2022 If you made a New Year\u2019s resolution this year, there\u2019s an 80 percent chance you\u2019ve already given it up or you\u2019re just about to. We want to help you stick with it  \u2014   or revamp it into something you really want to achieve  \u2014   so this month Smarter Living will offer tips, advice and motivation to help you. Every Monday in this space we\u2019ll pose a new idea, offer advice for staying strong and ask you a question. Then every Thursday we\u2019ll highlight a few of our favorite emails and offer a helping hand. To join in, email us at smarterliving@nytimes. com with the subject line \u201cMy resolution\u201d and send us answers to the following three bullets. And, because this goes both ways, I\u2019ll start us off: \u2022 Your name: I\u2019m Tim Herrera, your Smarter Living Editor. \u2022 Your resolution and why you chose it (either the one you started with, or the one you really want to achieve): My resolution is to be better with money so I can save more and *gasp* maybe actually retire someday. \u2022 Two specific   within your resolution: In February, I\u2019ll order delivery for dinner one fewer night per week, and I\u2019ll stop buying one of my daily afternoon coffees (which I buy solely out of habit, but which cost me around $500 over the course of a year). \u2022 An audacious plan to respond to climate change by building a city of floating islands in the South Pacific is moving forward, with the government of French Polynesia agreeing to consider hosting the islands in a tropical lagoon. \u2022  A song spreading fast online in China offers a bit of relief for those who dashed home for the new year only to face relentless personal questions from their families. \u2022 And we review \u201cBehemoth,\u201d a documentary from Zhao Liang that finds horror and surrealism in Inner Mongolia, where migrant iron and coal workers are shown as cogs in China\u2019s economic progress. Bruce Lee, the first superstar of   films, appeared to Western audiences in only five movies and a handful of TV roles before his early death in 1973. But his influence has never really stopped growing, and his legacy can be found in some remarkable places. Take, for example, the video that Tom Brady, the N. F. L. quarterback, recently posted online to motivate his team for the playoffs. It features Lee\u2019s mantra \u201cBe water, my friend. \u201d Or the impact he had on 1970s reggae music, appearing on album covers, like Lee Perry\u2019s \u201cKung Fu Meets the Dragon,\u201d and inspiring countless songs and artists, such as Dillinger. David Henry Hwang, the   playwright, devoted an entire play to Lee\u2019s life, and called him the first \u201c  male hero. \u201d This week, the Museum of Modern Art in New York is screening all five of Lee\u2019s films in a series called \u201cEternal Bruce Lee. \u201d He\u2019s been honored in museums from Hong Kong to California, not to mention the Bruce Lee Action Museum in Seattle. Despite all the fanfare, Lee still has an aura of mystery. Did you know he was the 1958   champion of Hong Kong? _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings.
