An old friend, it turns out: the   king of Miami, Jorge P\u00e9rez  \u2014   often described as the Donald Trump of the tropics. Mr. P\u00e9rez is accustomed to such phone calls  \u2014   and to people returning his. When Forbes magazine estimates your net worth at nearly $3 billion, V. I. P. treatment  \u2014   even from the White House  \u2014   tends to follow. That attention is also bipartisan. Mr. P\u00e9rez, 67, a major figure in the Miami art world and a developer who has helped remake the city\u2019s skyline, publicly supported Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign. But he said Mr. Trump lost little time in phoning him after his victory in November. In fact, the emails and calls between the two men  \u2014   who have known each other as business partners for several decades  \u2014   actually increased. \u201cYou have to give him credit for reaching out,\u201d Mr. P\u00e9rez said of these conversations in an interview in the living room of his waterfront Miami mansion. Though Mr. P\u00e9rez passed on Mr. Trump\u2019s January request for help constructing the wall  \u2014   pointedly quipping, \u201cOnce it\u2019s finished, which side of it will I be on?\u201d  \u2014   he said Mr. Trump still seemed eager to enlist him in joining the administration. Despite differences regarding both foreign affairs and federal housing policy (Mr. P\u00e9rez said, \u201cI\u2019m a strong believer in increased housing subsidies. \u201d) the president offered him the job of deputy secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Secretary Ben Carson\u2019s No. 2, Mr. P\u00e9rez said. Again, he declined. In late January, he said, President Trump was back on the phone, discussing the job of assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, the position responsible for promoting United States interests throughout Latin America. Mr. P\u00e9rez, the son of Cuban exiles who was raised in Colombia, said no once again. Hope Hicks, a White House spokeswoman, asked about these offers and the current state of the relationship between President Trump and Mr. P\u00e9rez, declined to comment. Mr. P\u00e9rez, in describing his rejection of the job offers, explained, \u201cI\u2019m not a yes man. \u201d He added, \u201cI told him he needs to hear the voices of people that are not dependent on him, that are going to give him the truth. \u201d To that point, he then told Bloomberg News in a Jan. 31 article he thought the idea of a Mexican border wall was \u201cidiotic. \u201d That was more than two weeks ago. Despite sending   letters to Mr. Trump\u2019s personal email account, and getting confirmation from Mr. Trump\u2019s personal secretary that they had been read, Mr. P\u00e9rez hasn\u2019t heard a word back. It\u2019s a rupture that speaks to the uncomfortable social terrain Mr. P\u00e9rez now occupies. He is trying to balance a longstanding personal relationship with Mr. Trump as well as his own increasingly prominent role as an arts philanthropist  \u2014   from producing documentary films and financing exchange programs for Cuban artists to donating over $55 million in cash and art to the financially beleaguered Miami Art Museum, which rechristened itself the P\u00e9rez Art Museum Miami in his honor. Yet these two milieus  \u2014   the White House and the cultural arena  \u2014   now eye each other with both open hostility and wariness toward anyone unwilling to pick a side. Mr. P\u00e9rez may see himself as a trusted back channel between apprehensive cultural figures and President Trump: \u201cI would help him try to see the different opinions of the art world,\u201d he said. Much of the art world, however, hardly seems in the mood for such a genteel   . \u201cJorge P\u00e9rez is wasting his time,\u201d insisted Amanda Keeley, the owner of Miami\u2019s Exile Books, when asked about Mr. P\u00e9rez\u2019s efforts to reach out to the president. Ms. Keeley led fellow Miami artists to demonstrate at the Womens March on Washington last month. \u201cDonald Trump isn\u2019t interested in listening,\u201d she said, \u201cand you can\u2019t have a conversation with someone who doesn\u2019t want to listen to you. \u201d Indeed, as Inauguration Day loomed, many staff members at the museum carrying Mr. P\u00e9rez\u2019s name said they believed the time had already passed for measured discussion. There was talk of heeding the call from the New   organizers of the J20 Art Strike, which sought to close museums nationwide as a symbolic action opposing not only Mr. Trump but also \u201cTrumpists who use the social prestige of art to legitimize power. \u201d It was hard not to see the museum\u2019s largest benefactor falling within those cross hairs. In response, its director, Franklin Sirmans, sent a memo to the staff, insisting \u201cwe will be open to all in our community as a place of dialogue and conversation\u201d on Inauguration Day. A month later, Mr. P\u00e9rez is the one looking for help in sparking a dialogue. \u201cHe\u2019s a good friend,\u201d Mr. P\u00e9rez said of Mr. Trump. \u201cOr at least he was, until I made a statement about the wall. \u201d The last time they spoke? \u201cHim saying \u2018please come to Palm Beach and    we\u2019re spending weekends there. \u2019\u201d And now? \u201cIt\u2019s gone to radio silence, to zero,\u201d he said. Mr. P\u00e9rez said he believed that as president, \u201cinstead of moderating, Donald was retrenching. The rhetoric of the campaign was brutal,\u201d but he never assumed it was a preview of the candidate\u2019s actual policies. Mr. P\u00e9rez was distressed by reports that Mr. Trump intended to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts, on whose board Mr. P\u00e9rez had served under President Clinton. He was even more upset at chatter that Mr. Trump might take a tougher stand on the trade opening with Cuba, where Mr. P\u00e9rez accompanied President Obama last March as part of a historic state visit. Mr. P\u00e9rez said he couldn\u2019t fathom this turnaround in Mr. Trump: \u201cWe used to talk about Cuba as a place to do business  \u2014   a Trump hotel, a Trump golf course. \u201d So during that last phone call, he asked Mr. Trump   did he intend to tighten the trade embargo against Cuba? \u201cHe gave me no real answer  \u2014   not yes, not no. Just \u2018We\u2019re going to see what happens, I haven\u2019t decided on that yet. \u2019\u201d Next came Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order announcing a travel ban, prompting an exasperated Mr. P\u00e9rez to give his fateful Bloomberg interview. Meanwhile, Mr. P\u00e9rez is focusing on art. Later this month, he returns to Havana with Mr. Sirmans, visiting artists\u2019 studios as a prelude to the June exhibition of \u201cOn the Horizon: Contemporary Cuban Art From the Jorge M. P\u00e9rez Collection,\u201d drawn from more than 160 artworks that he recently donated. \u201cCubans came here and built up great businesses, bringing in Latin Americans who have a love for the city. \u201d He concluded, \u201ccontemporary Latin American art and culture is what should go with that movement. \u201d The composition of \u201cOn The Horizon\u201d is evidence of further social changes. The work of younger Cuban artists who came of age in Miami, such as Antonia Wright, will be installed alongside that of artists who left the island at various points in their adult careers, such as Rub\u00e9n Torres Llorca, as well as those still based there, like Kcho. In years past, that lack of distinction would have been politically fraught. Mr. P\u00e9rez bristled at the notion that   with Mr. Trump was futile. \u201cPlaying into the game is O. K. if you produce results,\u201d he said of such outreach, citing his concerns over a report that the Trump administration was considering eliminating the arts endowment. \u201cIf I could sit down with him and get it to function at half its budget until the next Democratic president gets in, is that worse than having it totally cut?\u201d Mr. P\u00e9rez stopped short and chuckled to himself. \u201cFirst I need to be able to talk to him. \u201d He\u2019s still waiting for the phone to ring.'"}, "time": 1742628412.3261533}
