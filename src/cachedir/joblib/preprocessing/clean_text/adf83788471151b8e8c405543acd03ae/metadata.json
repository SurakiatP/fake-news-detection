Today on TRUNEWS, Rick Wiles raises the alarm about Germany\u2019s biggest bank bracing for a potentially catastrophic earnings report Thursday, and NATO redeploying forces to Russia\u2019s doorstep. Rick also speaks with Jeremy Wiles, the CEO of KingdomWorks Studios, about his harrowing new film \u201c \u201d, which details the apathy German Christians displayed toward the Holocaust during World War 2, and the warning American evangelicals MUST heed everyday while the lives of the unborn are slaughtered domestically. \\nToday\u2019s Audio Streamcast.
