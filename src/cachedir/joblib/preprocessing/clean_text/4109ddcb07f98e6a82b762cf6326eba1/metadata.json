[Next Saturday night I will be holding a BIG rally in Pennsylvania. Look forward to it!  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 22, 2017,   \u201cNext Saturday night I will be holding a BIG rally in Pennsylvania. Look forward to it!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter. The announcement comes after Trump made the decision to skip the annual dinner in February, breaking with the tradition presidents in recent years have set by attending the event. The rally will be held April 29 in Harrisburg, the same day as Trump marks the 100th day of his presidency, Politico reported. A senior White House official said the decision to hold the rally that day had more to do with how Trump planned to spend the hours of the 100th day than the correspondents\u2019 dinner. \u201cThe media is trying to make this about them when  \u2014   respectfully it has nothing to do with you guys,\u201d said the official. \u201cIt\u2019s about focusing on the people. \u201d No White House staff will attend the dinner either as a show of solidarity with Trump, and outlets such as Vanity Fair, TIME, People, Bloomberg, and the New Yorker have canceled their parties. Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein will headline the event in Trump\u2019s place to present journalism awards.'"}, "time": 1742562685.2510884}
