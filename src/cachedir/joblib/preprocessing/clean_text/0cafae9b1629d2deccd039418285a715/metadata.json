The party posted images on Twitter of the damaged building in Hillsborough, N. C. on Sunday afternoon that showed blackened walls, charred couches and burned campaign signs for Donald J. Trump and several local candidates. A window was broken, and a swastika was   nearby alongside the words \u201cNazi Republicans leave town or else. \u201d The bombing occurred at a tense moment in American politics, just three weeks from Election Day and near the end of a divisive presidential campaign that has seen deepening hostility and suspicions between supporters of Hillary Clinton and those of Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly said that he believes the vote will be \u201crigged\u201d against him. On Sunday, the Hillsborough police said the fire had been caused by a firebomb thrown through a window of the office, which is in a shopping center about 14 miles outside Durham. The damage was not noticed until Sunday, when a business owner called the authorities around 9 a. m. the police said. Gov. Pat McCrory said in a statement that no one had been injured. \u201cThis highly disturbing act goes far beyond vandalizing property it willfully threatens our community\u2019s safety via fire, and its hateful message undermines decency, respect and integrity in civic participation,\u201d Mayor Tom Stevens of Hillsborough said in a statement. \u201cOur law enforcement officials are responding quickly and thoroughly to investigate this reprehensible act and prosecute the perpetrators. \u201d The Hillsborough police said they were investigating the attack along with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. In a statement to The Charlotte Observer, Dallas Woodhouse, the executive director of the state Republican Party, called the bombing \u201cpolitical terrorism. \u201d \u201cThe office itself is a total loss,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only thing important to us is that nobody was killed, and they very well could have been. \u201d \u201cWhether you are Republican, Democrat or independent, all Americans should be outraged by this   and violent attack against our democracy,\u201d he added. \u201cEveryone in this country should be free to express their political viewpoints without fear for their own safety. \u201d Mr. McCrory, a Republican, condemned the bombing as \u201can attack on our democracy. \u201d \u201cViolence has no place in our society  \u2014   but especially in our elections,\u201d he said in his statement. \u201cFortunately no one was injured however, I will use every resource as governor to assist local authorities in this investigation. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562003.587663}
