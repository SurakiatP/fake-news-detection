S. soil between 1974 and 1983.[  Ward Alderman Robert Maldonado submitted a proposal to name a   stretch of North Luis Munoz Marin Drive after the convicted terrorist early in February. The proposal was quickly pushed through ahead of new rules that would prevent people who are still living from having a Chicago street named after them.  Alderman Maldonado attempted to claim that the new street name is not meant to honor the FALN terror outfit but is only meant to honor Rivera. Others note that it is farcical to claim you are honoring a man whose only claim to fame is in starting a terror group while pretending you are not also honoring the terror group. Joe Connor, the son of a man killed by a FALN terror attack in 1975, was furious at the move to honor his father\u2019s murderer, according to the Chicago  . \u201cHe is a sworn terrorist,\u201d Connor said. \u201cHe was convicted of bombings in Chicago that did injure people. He tried to escape from prison with machine guns and plastic explosives where he was gonna kill the guards.   \u2026     And Chicago is gonna put up a sign in his honor?\u201d \u201cThe idea that people will walk by and see this street sign and think that Oscar Lopez was some sort of great person  \u2014   it\u2019s diabolical,\u201d Connor added. \u201cThe world is upside down here. What\u2019s next for Chicago, bin Laden Boulevard? Charles Manson Court? This is worse than a disgrace. It is sinister. It\u2019s a direct insult to my father\u2019s life. \u201d The plan to honor the Puerto Rican separatist approved by Chicago\u2019s Transportation Committee advanced this year after Barack Obama commuted Rivera\u2019s sentence. Obama ordered Rivera\u2019s release despite that he has never renounced his past violence. New York Councilman Joe Borelli said the commutation \u201cproves that Obama and most liberals are out of touch with reality and willing to sacrifice all norms in the name of progressivism. \u201d Indeed, Joe Conner noted that Rivera isn\u2019t even supported by most Puerto Ricans. In an   in the Chicago   Connor noted that few Puerto Ricans have ever supported the independence movement Rivera championed. Lopez has never represented the people of Puerto Rico. Never more than 5 percent of Puerto Ricans have ever voted for independence from America and in 2012 fully 60 percent voted for statehood. Further, Lopez and the FALN\u2019s vision of \u201cfreedom\u201d never involved freedom at all for Puerto Ricans but subjugation in a   Marxist state with Lopez and the FALN no doubt in the role of the Castros, as they wanted a \u201cfree and socialist\u201d Puerto Rico. The son of the murdered New Yorker ended his   with a plea to the city. This is the felon whom Chicago plans to honor. I ask Ald. Maldonado, in the name of decency, to withdraw the honorary street designation for terror leader Oscar Lopez Rivera and cancel the vote. Should Maldonado refuse, I ask Mayor Emanuel and the other aldermen to reject and vote against the naming of Oscar Lopez Rivera Way. Twelve members of the FALN serving lengthy jail sentences were offered amnesty in 1999 by President Bill Clinton but only on the condition that they sign a statement expressing sorrow for their past crimes. Rivera was the only one of the dozen convicted terrorists who refused to sign the oath.
