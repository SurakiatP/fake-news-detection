Her doctor assured her that reconstructive surgery would spare her nipples and leave her with   breasts. It did. But while Ms. McCree\u2019s rebuilt chest may resemble natural breasts, it is now completely numb. Her nipples lack any feeling. She cannot sense the slightest touch of her breasts, perceive warmth or cold, feel an itch if she has a rash or pain if she bangs into a door. And no one warned her. \u201cI can\u2019t even feel it when my kids hug me,\u201d said Ms. McCree, 31, a store manager in Grand Junction, Colo. who is raising two daughters on her own. Plastic surgeons performed more than 106, 000 breast reconstructions in 2015, up 35 percent from 2000. And they have embraced   techniques to improve the appearance of reconstructed breasts and give them a more natural \u201clook and feel\u201d  \u2014   using a woman\u2019s belly fat to create the new breast, sparing the nipple, minimizing scarring with creative incisions and offering enhancements like larger, firmer lifted breasts. Doctors often promise patients that their reconstructed breasts will look even better than the breasts they had before. But they often describe the potential consequences of the surgery in ambiguous terms. Women say the fact that sensation and sexual arousal will not be restored is not made clear. The main problem is using the word \u201cfeel,\u201d said Dr. Clara Lee, an associate professor of plastic surgery at Ohio State University who does reconstructive breast surgery. Surgeons who use a woman\u2019s own tissue to recreate a breast might tell the patient that it will \u201cfeel\u201d like a natural breast, referring to how it feels to someone else, not the woman. \u201cWe don\u2019t always mean what\u2019s important to the patient,\u201d Dr. Lee said. \u201cOur focus has been on what women look like,\u201d said Dr. Andrea L. Pusic, a plastic surgeon at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who specializes in breast reconstruction and studies patients\u2019 quality of life after breast surgery. \u201cWhat it feels like to the woman has been a kind of blind spot in breast surgery. That\u2019s the next frontier. \u201d The focus on how breasts look and feel to other people, rather than how they feel to the patient, speaks to the fact that women are still largely judged by their appearance, said Victoria   a professor and the head of feminist, gender and sexuality studies at Wesleyan University. \u201cThere\u2019s such a strong cultural gaze at women\u2019s breasts,\u201d Dr.   said. \u201cIt does raise the question: Who is breast reconstruction for?\u201d Adding to the confusion has been the excitement over surgical innovations, particularly \u201c \u201d mastectomies. During a traditional mastectomy, doctors remove the nipple and scoop out breast tissue, causing considerable nerve damage. But now, in certain cases, the nipple can be spared, raising hopes that some feeling will be preserved. The actress Angelina Jolie wrote about her   preventive double mastectomy in a New York Times   in 2013, inspiring other women at high risk of breast cancer to have their breasts removed. But the   surgery has yet to fulfill its promise, and in most cases, sensation is not restored. For many women, the loss of sensation in their breasts can be devastating. \u201cNo one said, \u2018You will not have sexual arousal in your chest again,\u2019\u201d Ms. McCree said. \u201cI thought that because I was able to keep my nipples and the blood supply, I\u2019d keep my feeling. \u201d Eve Wallinga, 60, a cancer survivor from St. Cloud, Minn. said many women who choose   mastectomies believe that reconstructive surgery will make them \u201cwhole\u201d again and are not told that the sensation lost during the surgery is unlikely to come back. \u201cThey go into it thinking everything will be the same when they come out  \u2014   they\u2019ll just have   stuffing in their breasts,\u201d Ms. Wallinga said. \u201cSome are very angry and upset, and say, \u2018Why wasn\u2019t I told?\u2019 They feel very betrayed. \u201d The lack of sensation is potentially dangerous. Women who have had mastectomies and reconstruction surgery have sustained severe burns on their breasts from heating pads, hair dryers, curling irons, sunbathing and overly hot showers. Several women interviewed recounted times when they had not realized a bra was cutting into their skin until they saw blood. Many described embarrassing \u201cwardrobe malfunctions,\u201d when a bathing suit or   shifted to reveal part of their breast without their knowing because they did not feel the air on their exposed skin. A doctor recalled a patient who had burned herself while draining hot pasta for dinner she did not realize she was hurt until she saw red marks on her skin in the shower several hours later. Some women described losing the sense of the position of their breasts. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the sexual arousal, it\u2019s the awkwardness,\u201d said Cathy Balsamo of Berkeley Heights, N. J. \u201cYou can\u2019t figure out your space  \u2014   almost like you\u2019re bigger than you really are. It\u2019s a bizarre feeling. \u201d She added, \u201cWhen I put on a sports bra, I have to look in the mirror and focus on the breasts to make sure they\u2019re in the pocket where they belong. \u201d Nerve damage during mastectomies can create   pain syndrome. Some women experience tingling sensations, and others have debilitating pain. Patients say physicians minimize the condition, even though it is fairly common, affecting anywhere from 25 percent to 60 percent of mastectomy patients, according to published studies. Michelle Lamon Romero, 45, of East Longmeadow, Mass. said she had been incapacitated by pain since having a double mastectomy two years ago. She lost her job and now relies on a cocktail of five drugs to keep the pain at a manageable level. \u201cThe surface of the skin is numb  \u2014   if you run a needle over it, I can\u2019t feel it,\u201d Ms. Romero said. \u201cBut I can feel the pain underneath just radiating everywhere. \u201d She added that her plastic surgeon had told her that she was an anomaly and that \u201cthis isn\u2019t real, it\u2019s all in your head. \u201d Other patients Ms. Romero has met through Facebook have had the same experience. \u201cSo many women who join are just relieved to know they\u2019re not alone,\u201d Ms. Romero said. \u201cThey all start out the same way: \u2018My doctor told me I was crazy. \u2019\u201d Most surgeons agree that the best chance for sensory restoration after a mastectomy is a procedure that uses a woman\u2019s own body tissue rather than an implant because nerves have a better chance of regenerating in natural tissue. The procedure has produced modest results. If sensation returns, it is usually limited to the perception of pressure, without improved sensation related to touch, temperature or sexual arousal. \u201cIt\u2019s a shadow of the degree of sensation that people had before,\u201d said Dr. Edwin G. Wilkins, a plastic surgeon at the University of Michigan who is running a large study on reconstruction outcomes and complications with Dr. Pusic. \u201cIt\u2019s a poor substitute. \u201d Dr. Aldona J. Spiegel, a plastic surgeon in Houston who has pioneered techniques to reconnect nerves in the breast and restore sensation, said the procedure remained promising. \u201cI tell patients that if I am able to reconnect nerves in the reconstructed breast, it will improve the sensation. But I never tell them it will be normal,\u201d Dr. Spiegel said. She added that many of her patients had shown \u201cvery significant improvement. \u201d One of her patients, Karen Holt, 65, a retired principal from Houston, had her left breast removed and reconstructed from her own tissue 14 years ago. Ms. Holt knows she\u2019s unusual, she said, but claims she has \u201cjust about as much erogenous sensation in the left breast as in the right. \u201d But doctors say such results are rare. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to give people false hope,\u201d said Dr. Frank J. DellaCroce, a plastic surgeon and a founder of the Center for Restorative Breast Surgery in New Orleans. Restoring sensation is \u201cone of those things that\u2019s regarded as the holy grail of breast reconstruction,\u201d he said. \u201cBut no one has shown in any scientific article to date that we\u2019re able to return sensation in any reliable way. \u201d Dr. Christine Laronga, a breast oncologist at the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Fla. said she tried to make clear to patients that feeling would not be restored after reconstruction, telling them, \u201cIt may look like a breast, but it won\u2019t feel like a breast. \u201d While doctors agree on the need for a mastectomy procedure that spares nerves, they note that the goal of the surgery is to make sure the cancer is gone. There is also a risk that efforts to restore sensation will trigger a pain syndrome. \u201cIt\u2019s a very tricky area,\u201d said Dr. Ida K. Fox, a plastic surgeon at Washington University in St. Louis who specializes in breast and hand surgery. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to restore sensation and give someone chronic pain. \u201d Ms. Balsamo, 50, who had a double mastectomy after testing positive for a genetic mutation that increases breast cancer risk, said she did not regret the surgery, but wished she had been better informed. \u201cI just wish I had known,\u201d Ms. Balsamo said. \u201cThey said there\u2019s going to be a difference in the sensation  \u2014   not that there wouldn\u2019t be any. Before you go in, shouldn\u2019t you know the facts?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742563551.730079}
