S. Commission on Religious Freedom for four years,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cWe have an ambassador of religious freedom that goes around the world, trying to advance American values and protecting minorities. And it is extremely American, if not our first freedom, obviously, to protect religious freedom. That includes the persecution of minorities. \u201d \u201cThe executive order from President Trump said nothing specifically about any specific religion. It said we will protect those persecuted in the name of religion, for their religion. So that would include Christians, Yazidis, and even Sunni Muslims like myself who are part of the majority in Syria  \u2014   or Egypt, or Saudi Arabia, or wherever  \u2014   but yet have dissident opinions that are persecuted,\u201d he pointed out. Jasser said it truly would be wrong to favor one religion over the other, \u201cbut it is very American to favor those who are persecuted over those who are the oppressors. \u201d  \u201cAnd there\u2019s nothing more American than vetting refugees, and beginning to vet them against those who believe in theocracy,\u201d he added. \u201cWe don\u2019t want people coming into this country that believe in the Islamic states. We want those who believe in freedom and liberty. I think it\u2019s appropriate to pause and begin the process of vetting ideology, which hasn\u2019t happened so far. We\u2019re sort of welcoming in anyone, including jihadists. It\u2019s just amazing how the identity Left loves to use us Muslims as a foil of identity politics. They\u2019re really not addressing what was written in that order. \u201d Jasser said Trump\u2019s order was, if anything, too narrow. \u201cI think there should have been more countries: Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Qatar. The havens of the founding fathers of ISIS, I think, should have been included. But that would not make it more \u2018 .\u2019 There is nothing more   than helping dissident Muslims, helping those persecuted under theocracy, under the sharia state, if you will. \u201d He noted that the seven countries affected by Trump\u2019s executive order are \u201cthe same seven countries that Obama listed as hot spots. \u201d \u201cI will say, there should be some fair criticism about the messaging from the White House on this,\u201d he added. \u201cI understand why they rushed it: because they didn\u2019t want people to get a head start, the radicals to get a head start. But still, probably the implementation could have been done better at the front lines, in airports, etc. But that\u2019s a different criticism from having what I believe are   rallies across the country to try to undercut the stability of our country. \u201d Jasser said it was time to begin shifting \u201cthe axis of the conversation\u201d about Islam and religious freedom. \u201cThe conversation for the last eight years, or even into the Bush administration, has been about \u2018countering violent extremism,\u2019 which is a tactic,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to start shifting to saying, \u2018Well, what are we for?\u2019 We\u2019re against extremism. I think we should change it so that we\u2019re against violent Islamism, so that we make it clear  \u2014   because when you make it clear and identify the enemy as theocratic Islamists, then Americans can start to say, \u2018Okay, so the   are our friends and allies, and the Islamists are our enemies.\u2019 That makes it actually more   rather than creating this sort of generic phobia of, \u2018Well, any Muslim could be a terrorist. \u2019\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s number one. Number two, we need to talk about what we\u2019re for,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe will advance those who want freedom and liberty, who believe in secular democracy. Our Muslim reform movement has a   declaration that is a declaration of principles, that says we\u2019re against the Caliphate. We believe in the universal declaration of human rights. These are things that I\u2019d like to see the President, as he has this   stay, start to engage. \u201d \u201cHe talks about a commission on radical Islamism. I hope he starts putting that into play because the pause is just going to be a pause, with nothing gained, if we don\u2019t start to educate Americans about what we\u2019re for, and what the sides are,\u201d he warned. \u201cThe old allies in the Middle East  \u2014   Saudi Arabia, etc.  \u2014   they might be with us in this    program, but they\u2019re both the firefighters and the arsonists. We need to make clear that our principles in America, our religious freedom, are not embodied in those countries that are the cauldrons of radical Islam,\u201d he said. Jasser invited listeners to consult the resources at the American Islamic Forum for Democracy website and the larger umbrella Muslim Reform Movement that stretches across Europe and Canada.  \u201cUnfortunately, the identity Left, and the Islamists who are what I call \u2018\u2019 have been dominating the conversation, and they\u2019re just apoplectic right now because they\u2019ve lost control,\u201d he said.
