It\u2019s time for more drastic measures.\u2019 \\nAll features in the paper will now be expected to have a Brexit angle, with the exception of the daily filler piece on the dangers of statins, for which copy is already in the can for at least the next five years. \\nEarly sightings of tomorrow\u2019s paper reveal a front-pager on the big overnight news from the US, revealing \u2018Meghan Markle looking Supreme, that\u2019s the Judgement of everyone, as she looks for a quick Brexit back to Stateside\u2019.
