It\u2019s 13 days before the elections. This email leak confirms Hillary Clinton and her staff were engaged in a cover up designed to prevent Congress from seeing incriminating emails about well \u2013 everything! \\nThe issue is this. Early voting has occurred and is occurring across the nation. People have already cast their ballots for Hillary Clinton. If the Democrats pull her as a candidate and put anybody else in \u2013 likely Biden \u2013 then they will lose all the votes cast for Hillary as she will no longer be the Democratic candidate. \\nAll the Democrat illegal immigrant voting fraud, dead peopl e voting fraud, busing people around to vote in multiple precincts fraud plus all legal citizen Democrat votes cast early will no longer be valid if Hillary Clinton is removed as the candidate! \\nAnd the 32K emails haven\u2019t yet been released! How low did you go, Hillary? \\nIt\u2019s a bit late now to do Michelle Obama\u2019s bidding to \u201ctake the high road.\u201d For you that might be a gutter.
