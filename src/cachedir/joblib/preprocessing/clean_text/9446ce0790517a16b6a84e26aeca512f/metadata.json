Stephany, Orlando\u2019s chief medical examiner, still has the image of what he saw inside the Pulse nightclub on the morning of the slaughter seared into his head. Strobe lights were still flashing. The television was still on. Purses and cellphones were strewn about the floor. And there were bodies everywhere. \u201cWhat you saw was drinks that were just served. You saw bills that were about to be paid. You saw   food,\u201d said Dr. Stephany, 41, who was called into duty hours after Omar Mateen barged into the popular gay nightclub and opened fire.   people were killed in the attack. \u201cTime just stopped. \u201d Although he had been filling in for about a year, Dr. Stephany was officially made Orange County\u2019s chief medical examiner two days after the slaughter at Pulse. On his first real day on the job, his office completed 18 autopsies. He said he performed at least seven of the 49 autopsies. The exact number he is not certain of. He lost count. He and his four colleagues, aided by two state pathologists called in from elsewhere in Florida, have now conducted autopsies on all 49 victims as well as the assailant. Out of respect for those who were killed, Mr. Mateen\u2019s corpse is being held in a different part of the morgue, in an area typically used for decomposing bodies. Determining the cause of death was routine in this case, as all of the victims had bullet wound after bullet wound. \u201cSo you kind of take a typical homicide scene, multiply it by 50, even that just won\u2019t prepare you for what you see,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can find anybody more experienced than medical examiners to go to that type of events, but to see the sheer number of decedent is almost surreal. \u201d The pathologists put aside their emotions, he said, as they sought to identify everyone. The technicians photographed,   and fingerprinted the bodies to confirm their identities. They inspected tattoos. They washed blood off the victims\u2019 faces so they could be compared to photographs from their driver\u2019s licenses and Facebook profiles. The identity of one victim frustrated the team for dozens of hours, until Dr. Stephany realized that a wallet he had picked up off the ground at the club as evidence contained the person\u2019s name. In autopsy after autopsy, the doctors documented every wound and plucked every bullet, noting where it entered and the direction it traveled. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t appear anyone suffered,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone went down where they were. I don\u2019t think anyone had prolonged suffering. \u201d A New Hampshire native, Dr. Stephany has conducted several thousand autopsies in his life. He has seen his share of overdoses, suicides, hangings and car crashes. But he said he knows this case, his first as the chief, will be one he will not forget. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been able to sink in yet,\u201d Dr. Stephany said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way it could not affect you immediately or eventually. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628315.5425334}
