The possibility that Ms. Trump\u2019s remarks had been plagiarized cast a cloud over the second day of the Republican National Convention and laid bare lingering tensions within the party surrounding the nomination of Donald J. Trump, whose campaign continues to be plagued by stumbles and infighting despite several reboots. The disarray was evident as Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and senior Republicans offered conflicting explanations for the similarities in the speeches, with some officials conceding that the passages were lifted and demanding accountability, and others arguing that nothing untoward had occurred. Among Mr. Trump\u2019s aides, there was a palpable sense of frustration that Ms. Trump\u2019s speech, which they considered a highlight of the evening, had become a cause for embarrassment. Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, pushed back aggressively against accusations of plagiarism and even tried to go on the offensive. Describing it as \u201ca great speech,\u201d Mr. Manafort said at a morning convention briefing that \u201cobviously Michelle Obama feels very similar sentiments toward her family. \u201d Deflecting questions about the passages themselves, Mr. Manafort instead attacked Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, for what he said was an effort to draw attention to the matter. \u201cThis is once again an example of when a woman threatens Hillary Clinton, she seeks out to demean her and take her down,\u201d Mr. Manafort said on CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to work against Melania Trump. \u201d Surrogates for Mr. Trump mused aloud on Tuesday about what might have happened, raising questions about fissures within his team and allowing the controversy to drag on. One adviser to Mr. Trump, who has assisted in the drafting of some of his speeches, acknowledged that Ms. Trump used words that were not her own. \u201cI\u2019m sure what happened is the person who was helping write this plucked something in there and probably an unfortunate oversight  \u2014   and certainly Melania didn\u2019t have anything to do with it,\u201d the adviser, Sam Clovis, a Trump campaign   said in an interview on MSNBC. Katrina Pierson, another spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, acknowledged that Ms. Trump used phrases similar to those used by Mrs. Obama but insisted that the language was not copied verbatim. She said in an interview with Sky News that Ms. Trump was trying to echo themes expressed publicly by prominent women including Laura Bush and Elizabeth Dole. \u201cShe really wanted to communicate to Americans in phrases they\u2019ve heard before,\u201d Ms. Pierson said. Talk of who was to blame for the speech also buzzed among former advisers to Mr. Trump. Corey Lewandowski, the campaign manager who was ousted in favor of Mr. Manafort, said that Mr. Manafort should take responsibility. \u201cWhoever signed off, the final signoff that allowed this to go forward, should be held accountable,\u201d Mr. Lewandowski said on CNN. \u201cI think if it was Paul Manafort, he would do the right thing and resign. \u201d Two people briefed on the process, who insisted on anonymity to discuss such a sensitive issue, said that Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s    had commissioned a draft of Ms. Trump\u2019s speech from two former speechwriters for George W. Bush. Matthew Scully and John McConnell, who had worked together as speechwriters during Mr. Bush\u2019s first term, wrote a draft of Ms. Trump\u2019s speech in June, sending it to the campaign for review about a month ago. The pair did not hear back from the campaign until about 10 days ago, according to one person familiar with the conversation, when they were told that the lineup of speeches and the timing of Ms. Trump\u2019s speech had been changed, leading to the speech having to be shortened. Ms. Trump then worked with a person from within the Trump organization to make substantial revisions. The   duo was not aware that the speech had been significantly changed until Ms. Trump delivered it on Monday night. According to one source, the only parts that remained from the original draft were the introduction and a passage that included the phrase \u201ca national campaign like no other. \u201d Mr. Scully is a veteran Republican speechwriter who wrote an early draft of a speech for Senator John McCain\u2019s   nominee in 2008. Mr. Scully had prepared a generic version of the speech and then rewrote it during an extended session with Sarah Palin, after he learned she was Mr. McCain\u2019s choice. Mr. Scully also helped write the acceptance speech given by Paul Ryan when he was chosen as Mitt Romney\u2019s running mate in the 2012 presidential campaign. Ms. Trump initially earned praise for her speech on the opening night of the convention, but her remarks almost immediately came under scrutiny when striking similarities were discovered between her speech and one delivered by Mrs. Obama The phrases in question came when Ms. Trump  \u2014   who told NBC News earlier on Monday that she had written her speech herself  \u2014   was discussing her upbringing in Slovenia and her parents. Here are the relevant passages: Ms. Trump, Monday night: Mrs. Obama, in her 2008 speech:  Ms. Trump:  Mrs. Obama, in 2008:  Mr. Trump\u2019s aides have thus far declined to identify who, if anyone, on the campaign helped in writing the speech In a statement released hours after the speech, a spokesman for Mr. Trump, Jason Miller, was vague about how it was crafted. \u201cIn writing her beautiful speech, Melania\u2019s team of writers took notes on her life\u2019s inspirations, and in some instances included fragments that reflected her own thinking,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cMelania\u2019s immigrant experience and love for America shone through in her speech, which made it a success. \u201d Sarah Hurwitz, a White House speechwriter who composed Mrs. Obama\u2019s 2008 address, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment, but Democrats were watching the fallout carefully. Advisers to Hillary Clinton said they decided to take a restrained approach to the controversy. The Clinton campaign often challenges the integrity of the Trump campaign, but doing so over the speech could create an opening for Trump advisers to suggest that Mrs. Clinton was to blame for the furor. After Mr. Manafort tried to do so anyway on Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, replied \u201cnice try, not true\u201d on Twitter and added, \u201cblaming Hillary Clinton isn\u2019t the answer\u201d for every Trump campaign problem. Stephanie Cutter, a Democratic strategist who has also been an Obama adviser, argued that the controversy revealed an inability among people closest to Mr. Trump to talk about his character. \u201cThe person who is supposed to know the candidate best and can speak to his values and what drives him couldn\u2019t write her own speech on it,\u201d Ms. Cutter wrote in an email. \u201cInstead, she lifted from a first lady who spoke from the heart about her husband. \u201d At the White House, Josh Earnest, the press secretary, said he would leave the analysis of Ms. Trump\u2019s speech to reporters. But several times, he emphasized the positive reviews that Mrs. Obama received when she delivered her remarks in 2008. \u201cShe received an enthusiastic reception and strong reviews because of her words and her life story and the values that she and her husband deeply believe in and try to instill in her kids,\u201d Mr. Earnest said. A few minutes later, he emphasized that when it comes to Mrs. Obama, \u201cher words and her values and her life story are quite powerful. \u201d Accusations of plagiarism are not unknown in political speeches, although the consequences have varied. In 2008, Mrs. Clinton criticized Mr. Obama for appearing to lift a passage from Deval Patrick, then the governor of Massachusetts, in a speech about how words matter. Mr. Obama, then a senator, said that he should have credited Mr. Patrick but that he did not consider it a case of plagiarism. When Mr. Biden was running for president in the 1980s, he faced questions about plagiarizing speeches from Robert F. Kennedy, Hubert H. Humphrey and Neil Kinnock, a British Labour Party leader. Mr. Biden said at the time that it was \u201cludicrous\u201d to expect a politician to attribute everything he said. Jarrett Hill, a Twitter user whose biography describes him as an interior designer and journalist, apparently first noticed the resemblance between Ms. Trump\u2019s speech and Mrs. Obama\u2019s in 2008. Mr. Hill, a television journalist who was recently laid off, said that one of Ms. Trump\u2019s lines  \u2014   the words \u201cstrength of your dreams\u201d  \u2014   caught his attention as he was watching on his computer from a Starbucks in Los Angeles, juggling Facebook chats and browsing Twitter. He tracked down the clip of Mrs. Obama\u2019s speech online and noticed that parts of the two speeches were nearly the same. \u201cI thought, \u2018That\u2019s legit plagiarism,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Hill, who described himself as a supporter of President Obama. \u201c\u2018Someone took this piece and plugged in their own information. \u2019\u201d'"}, "time": 1742628450.7922606}
