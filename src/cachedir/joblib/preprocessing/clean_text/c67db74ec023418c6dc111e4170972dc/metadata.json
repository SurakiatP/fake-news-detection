Alice, who is 5 and lives in a Chicago suburb, likes the part when Sal Paradise eats ice cream and apple pie whenever he feels hungry. She hasn\u2019t actually read Kerouac\u2019s        classic. (Alice is a precocious reader, but not that precocious.) Instead, her father read her a heavily abridged and sanitized illustrated version of \u201cOn the Road\u201d designed for   to    children. \u201cShe didn\u2019t love it,\u201d said her father, Kurt Hemmer, an English professor at Harper College and scholar of the Beat Generation, who noted that even some college students failed to appreciate the novel\u2019s subtle spiritual message. \u201cTo really grasp it, you need to be a bit more mature. \u201d \u201cOn the Road,\u201d with its recurring references to sex, drugs and domestic violence, might not seem like an ideal bedtime story for a child. But that\u2019s precisely the point of KinderGuides, a new series of books that aims to make challenging adult literary classics accessible to very young readers. Along with \u201cOn the Road,\u201d KinderGuides recently published picture book versions of Ernest Hemingway\u2019s \u201cThe Old Man and the Sea\u201d and Truman Capote\u2019s melancholy novella \u201cBreakfast at Tiffany\u2019s. \u201d (It skipped over the awkward question of whether Holly Golightly is a prostitute.) In one of its most ambitious and bizarre efforts, it released a cheerful take on Arthur C. Clarke\u2019s opaque,   science fiction novel, \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey,\u201d an allegory about the evolution of human consciousness that many adult readers find impenetrable. With their bright illustrations and breezy language  \u2014   \u201cSal is ready for an adventure!\u201d pretty much typifies the tone of \u201cOn the Road\u201d  \u2014   the books almost seem like parodies, or the perfect gag gift for the hipster parent who has everything. But the creators of the series, the graphic designer Melissa Medina and her partner, the writer Fredrik Colting, insist they aren\u2019t joking. They\u2019re already working on the next four titles in the series  \u2014   versions of Paulo Coelho\u2019s   novel \u201cThe Alchemist,\u201d Jane Austen\u2019s \u201cPride and Prejudice,\u201d J. D. Salinger\u2019s \u201cThe Catcher in the Rye\u201d and Harper Lee\u2019s \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d (minus the rape charges, Ku Klux Klan rallies and racial slurs). \u201cThe goal of all of this is to get them really psyched about these books now, so that they\u2019ll want to read the originals later,\u201d Ms. Medina said. Though the premise of their project may strike some as absurd  \u2014   does a first grader really need to be introduced to Kerouac or Capote?  \u2014   kiddie lit has become a surprisingly lucrative and crowded niche. Anxious parents who played Mozart for their babies in utero and showed them Baby Einstein educational videos have snapped up children\u2019s books that promise to turn their offspring into tiny literature lovers. BabyLit, an imprint that publishes board books for babies based on \u201cAnna Karenina,\u201d \u201cWuthering Heights,\u201d \u201cDon Quixote\u201d and other classics, has sold more than 1. 5 million copies of its 24 titles. Next fall, the company will introduce a series of picture books based on classic novels geared toward older children, which will include more of the plot, starting with \u201c \u201d and \u201cPride and Prejudice. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a more educational approach than just Spot the dog,\u201d said Suzanne Gibbs Taylor, the creator of the BabyLit series. Another popular series, Cozy Classics, which was created by the twin brothers Jack and Holman Wang, reduces great works of literature to   stories, illustrated with photos of handmade felt figurines. (Their rendition of Tolstoy\u2019s \u201cWar and Peace\u201d can be rattled off in a single breath: \u201c       !    . \u201d) Their titles, which include \u201cJane Eyre,\u201d \u201cEmma\u201d and \u201cAdventures of Huckleberry Finn,\u201d are designed for babies and toddlers, but include some arch visual jokes directed at the parents, like a felt figurine of Miss Havisham flailing about in flames in \u201cGreat Expectations. \u201d Even with the adorable fuzzy figures, the books can be overwhelming. \u201cMy daughter started crying hysterically 3 pages into it,\u201d one reader wrote of her    in an Amazon review of \u201c . \u201d Another reviewer questioned whether a toddler is ready for \u201cJane Eyre,\u201d and called the Cozy Classics version \u201cweird, dark and not the most appropriate for kids who are reading board books. \u201d Holman Wang said he and his brother wanted to preserve the sometimes grim and complex tone of the originals, rather than conforming to the \u201cfluffy bunny aesthetic\u201d of most contemporary picture books. \u201cIt\u2019s not about saying, \u2018My    has read \u2018Pride and Prejudice,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWe try not to cheaply capitalize on these   stories by sanitizing them and losing the themes. \u201d Some educators are skeptical of efforts to   complex literary works to small children, especially when there\u2019s such a rich body of classic children\u2019s literature. \u201cIt\u2019s ludicrous to take great works that are clearly for adults and reduce them for children,\u201d said Monica Edinger, a   teacher at the Dalton School in Manhattan, who dismissed KinderGuides as a disingenuous attempt to exploit parents\u2019 insecurities. Still, some parents counter that children can absorb the bigger themes, like the idea of resilience in \u201cThe Old Man and the Sea\u201d or adventurousness in \u201cOn the Road. \u201d Brent Almond, a graphic designer and parenting blogger who lives in Maryland, said his    son, Jon, had responded enthusiastically to some of the books. \u201cA lot of these books are melancholy or outright depressing, but it\u2019s been cool to see how he reacts to them,\u201d Mr. Almond said. Jon likes the book based on \u201c2001\u201d the best, because \u201cit\u2019s in space and it\u2019s kind of creepy,\u201d Mr. Almond said. (Jon didn\u2019t seem especially bothered by one of the more chilling scenes, when the ship\u2019s computer, Hal, turns on the astronauts and sends one of them out of the spaceship to his death, Mr. Almond said. ) Ms. Medina and Mr. Colting got the idea for KinderGuides about a year ago, when they were visiting her family in Kansas. Mr. Colting was reading \u201cThe Old Man and the Sea,\u201d and Ms. Medina\u2019s    niece asked him what it was about. He realized the story was easy to summarize, and saw a market opportunity. Mr. Colting, a native of Sweden, already had a background in publishing, albeit a somewhat checkered one. In 2009, he was sued by the Salinger estate for publishing an unauthorized sequel to \u201cThe Catcher in the Rye. \u201d He settled the lawsuit and withdrew copies from North America. Despite that earlier legal entanglement, Mr. Colting had no qualms about repurposing famous novels as picture books, including \u201cThe Catcher in the Rye. \u201d He argues that because they function as study guides as well as entertainment, the KinderGuides books don\u2019t infringe on copyrighted works. Some copyright experts dispute that logic. \u201cIf you are literally taking a book and trying to translate it for children, taking what makes it literature and copying that, that sounds like infringement,\u201d said Rebecca Tushnet, a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center. This year, Mr. Colting and Ms. Medina started an independent publishing company out of their home in Los Angeles, and began making a list of beloved classics to recast. After choosing their first few titles, they read the original works and highlighted the central themes and characters, and consulted study guides like CliffsNotes and SparkNotes. Mr. Colting wrote the text, and Ms. Medina created storyboards pairing the texts with sketches or descriptions of images. They hired a different illustrator for each book, and printed 20, 000 copies in total for the first four titles. They aim to publish 50 books, though not every classic novel seems feasible. James Joyce\u2019s \u201cUlysses,\u201d for instance, was considered but ultimately rejected. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t in good faith do it,\u201d Mr. Colting said, \u201cbecause we haven\u2019t read it. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561755.7787676}
