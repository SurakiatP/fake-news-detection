Townsend Brown, such as differentiated load space install a force without reaction on the ship, towards the positive pole. \\nA drive by electro-gravity of this kind could allow the B-2 work with an efficiency propulsion over-drive crossing at supersonic speeds. 9 and March 1992, the weekly magazine Aviation and Space made a surprising destapamiento, the B-2 is loaded electrostatically its current extractor, and the leading edges of your body, like wings. \\nThose familiar with the investigation of Tesla in the early 20th century, quickly will realize that this is equivalent to indicate that the B-2 cone anti-gravity aircraft can operate. The magazine Aviation obtained its information about the B-2 of a small group of renegade scientists and engineers, on the west coast, who were previously formally associated with black research projects. \\nMaking these discoveries, these scientists broke the code of silence that rivals those of the Mafia. They took the risk because they felt it was important for economic reasons, that efforts be made to declassify certain black technologies for commercial purposes. \\nTwo of these individuals said that their civil rights were clearly abused (in the name of security), either to keep them quiet or to prevent that they left the black tightly controlled research and development community. Although scientists No mention anything about electro-gravity in its destapamiento in the journal Aviation, about the B-2, they admit the existence of very dramatic secret technologies applicable to the control and propulsion of aircraft.
