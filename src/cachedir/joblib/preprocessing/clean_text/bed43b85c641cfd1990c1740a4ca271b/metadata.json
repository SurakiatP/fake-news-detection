[\u201cHow dare this mayor says \u2018We won\u2019t allow ICE or the FBI to do their job,\u2019\u201d Dietl said, shortly after de Blasio upped his opposition to the enforcement of federal immigration laws. \u201cIf \u2018Big Bird de Blasio\u2019 wants them [ilegals]  in New York, I will tell you what I would do, send the   gang over to Gracie Mansion. \u201d   He continued: de Blasio has no idea what he is doing regarding this issue   \u2026     We should not allow felons and criminal illegal gang members like   to be in this country. When they go to Rikers Island [jail] these criminals should be turned over to ICE. Public concern about   has risen amid a crime wave by illegal alien   members in New York\u2019s Long Island. Dietl\u2019s stinging criticism of de Blasio was accompanied by a promise to work with other politicians if he gets elected as mayor in November. \u201cI really believe that I can work really well with the governor and stop the antagonistic attitude of this mayor to the governor and to the president,\u201d Dietl said Thursday morning in a Press Conference outside Governor Cuomo\u2019s New York office. \u201cWe got to realize one thing  \u2014   whether you like Donald Trump or not, he\u2019s our president for the next four years. There is a word called \u2018compromise\u2019 and [de Blasio] needs to compromise with the President and the governor of this great state. \u201d  Dietl stated as mayor, he would go to Washington to sit down with President Trump and work with the fellow New Yorker on issues such as immigration enforcement and obtaining federal funding for affordable housing and infrastructure.  \u201cI\u2019ll say to him, \u2018Mr. President, you love this city. The Brooklyn Bridge is falling and what we need is federal funding from Washington. \u2019\u201d Dietl said. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be good to get as much money as we can out of him instead of being antagonistic with him?\u201d The press conference began with Dietl continuing his push to ask the Governor to open an independent investigation regarding the mayor\u2019s campaign finance violations, despite de Blasio has been cleared by both New York\u2019s federal U. S. Attorney and the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office. \u201cThis is not over. Just because they didn\u2019t have enough to indict him on criminal charges, there is enough evidence to take de Blasio down on civil charges and make him return that money he raised and fine him,\u201d Dietl said, while reading a   letter he sent to the Governor.  \u201cI want the Governor, who is against corruption to not let de Blasio get away with it. New York City is not a    city. Let keep it clean from corruption,\u201d Dietl said. \u201cNew York City needs a mayor for all the people, not just people that will give him money like the big union backers,\u201d Dietl said. \u201cNew York will not stand for a mayor as corrupt as him. He talks about the tale of two cities, well he is on the tale of the rich side. \u201d He added, \u201cWhy are we   him. Once he gets   de Blasio is going to become more lazy, he won\u2019t even show up to work. What has this mayor done the past three and a half years to give him the credit to now be  . \u201d '"}, "time": 1742563071.8453548}
