This leak is a virus that targets Windows computers, sharing files with remote users in a local network. WikiLeaks described the program on their website writing,  \u201cToday, June 1st 2017, WikiLeaks publishes documents from the \u2018Pandemic\u2019 project of the CIA, a persistent implant for Microsoft Windows machines that share files (programs) with remote users in a local network. \u2018Pandemic\u2019 targets remote users by replacing application code    with a trojaned version if the program is retrieved from the infected machine. To obfuscate its activity, the original file on the file server remains unchanged it is only   while in transit from the pandemic file server before being executed on the computer of the remote user. The implant allows the replacement of up to 20 programs with a maximum size of 800 MB for a selected list of remote users (targets). \u201d \u201cAs the name suggests, a single computer on a local network with shared drives that is infected with the \u2018Pandemic\u2019 implant will act like a \u2018Patient Zero\u2019 in the spread of a disease. It will infect remote computers if the user executes programs stored on the pandemic file server. Although not explicitly stated in the documents, it seems technically feasible that remote computers that provide file shares themselves become new pandemic file servers on the local network to reach new targets. \u201d Documentation published by WikiLeaks states that the virus is installed via a minifilter device driver. Jake Williams, a malware expert at Rendition InfoSec, spoke to Ars Technica about the virus stating, \u201cThis code looks like it was developed with a very specific use in mind. Many larger organizations don\u2019t use Windows file servers to serve files. They use special built storage devices (network attached storage). My guess here would be that this was designed to target a relatively small organization. \u201d Williams worked at the National Security Agency\u2019s elite Tailored Access Operation until 2013 and believes that WikiLeaks may be withholding some documentation relating to Pandemic. \u201cIf you handed me this tool, I don\u2019t have enough information to make it go,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s more documentation than this. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess as to why it wasn\u2019t released. \u201d Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
