[After Twitter announced on Monday that a new   feature would stop notifying users when they\u2019d been added to a list, several complaints started to immediately gain traction.  We want you to get notifications that matter. Starting today, you won\u2019t get notified when you are added to a list. https:  .   \u2014   Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) February 13, 2017,  \u201cBeing added to a list and knowing what list you were added to was literally the last useful thing about Twitter,\u201d complained one user. @TwitterSafety Being added to a list and knowing what list you were added to was literally the last useful thing about Twitter.  \u2014   Anthony Quintano \ud83c\udf34 (@AnthonyQuintano) February 13, 2017,  \u201cThis isn\u2019t a good move.
