Flynn had reportedly resigned the day before. [It turns out that Comey documented the conversation in a memorandum, \u201cpart of a paper trail\u201d he reportedly created to release later to tell his side of the story in the event things went awry  \u2014   which, as the world now knows, it did. (The White House has rejected Comey\u2019s version of the conversation, which took place in the Oval Office.)  The Times identifies its source as \u201cone of Mr. Comey\u2019s associates,\u201d who did not provide a copy of the memo but read it aloud on the telephone. The Drudge Report calls the story \u201cComey\u2019s revenge,\u201d and thus it would seem to be. If anything justifies President Trump\u2019s decision to fire Comey, it would be this effort to leak details of their private conversations to the media with the obvious intention of causing the maximum political damage to the president. But this dagger is a rather dull blade. It lacks any apparent \u201cquid pro quo\u201d  \u2014   a sense that Trump was offering something to Comey in exchange for dropping the investigation. Trump had already suggested in January that he would keep Comey on in his job as FBI director the conversation in the memorandum happened in February. Moreover, the Times seems to oversell the story, interpreting the word \u201chope\u201d as a request. Assuming, for the sake of argument, that the Comey memo is accurate, what Trump says  \u2014   \u201cI hope you can let this go   \u2026     I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go   \u2026     He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go. \u201d  \u2014   is never actually framed as a request at all. Yet the Times calls it a \u201crequest\u201d and an effort to interfere in the investigation. That is a rather liberal (pun intended) spin on Trump\u2019s words. Democrats, predictably, are pouncing on the story. But so far, is just the latest hysterical episode in their effort to deny the legitimacy of the November election. If this is the best that Comey\u2019s \u201cpaper trail\u201d can produce, his \u201crevenge\u201d may backfire, at least in political terms. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.
