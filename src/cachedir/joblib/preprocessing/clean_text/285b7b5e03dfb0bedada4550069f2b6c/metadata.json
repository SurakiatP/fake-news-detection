Who snuffed the dogs out? Hezza! Hezza! Hezza!\u201d a sample of some of the lyrics which go on a permanent loop for three and a half minutes include a soundbite from Margaret Thatcher saying \u201cGet orf my neck!\u201d \\nThe eighties drum machine sound is very retro, and also the very realistic sound of a gurgling dog in the background while Heseltine conducts an almighty Tarzan wail makes for interesting listening. \\nAll proceeds of the record will not go to the RSPCA but will instead be funnelled into Heseltine\u2019s latest acquisition, a duck house in his large pond, so he can shoot the shit out of the ducks when they\u2019re trying to nest.
