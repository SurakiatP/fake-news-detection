The one trophy he\u2019d spent his entire life trying to claim for his mantle of accomplishments had always evaded him\u2014until today. By winning the 2016 presidential election, Donald Trump is finally able to kick the nation\u2019s most powerful black family out of their house. \\nOne can only imagine the immense joy Donald\u2019s wife and children feel for him today. \\nTrump has been preparing for this moment ever since the Trump Organization first started buying buildings throughout New York City and raising rent for African-Americans until he could toss them out for no longer being able to afford it. Now, after decades of practice and determination, the president-elect will see his magnum opus arrive in the form of booting the incredibly influential and powerful Obama family out of the home they\u2019ve lived in for the past eight years. \\nEjecting black people from their residences has been a lifelong passion for Donald. From practicing discriminatory housing policies that prevented black people from moving into Trump buildings to tagging black people\u2019s rental applications with a separate sheet of paper marked \u201cC\u201d for \u201ccolored,\u201d Donald has never lost focus on his goal. But that was all just warm-up for Trump, who clearly wanted to challenge himself by attempting to evict a wealthy black family of international renown. And when he sends President Obama, Michelle, Malia, Sasha, and all their boxed-up belongings packing from their house in January, Trump will have done just that. \\nWhat a truly stunning feat. With the biggest item on his bucket list now firmly checked off, Trump would be more than justified in resting on his laurels to soak in the consummation of all his dreams. It\u2019s hard to imagine an even more powerful and famous black family Donald could evict, but knowing Trump, he will continue to push himself. Whatever his plans are now, the world will be watching in anxious anticipation.'"}, "time": 1742563938.725724}
