It\u2019s worth going to neighborhoods just a bit off the usual path. If you want to spend the day exploring, with a mix of stores and great food, these four neighborhoods will keep you satisfied. ________________________ Sometimes, when you get off the Bedford Avenue stop of the L train in Williamsburg and are bombarded with a crush of people, it seems like every traveler in the world has been told to get over to what\u2019s been hyped as Brooklyn\u2019s coolest neighborhood. But it\u2019s worth heading that way and taking a walk north to Greenpoint, Williamsburg\u2019s less gentrified, untouristy neighbor. You\u2019ll find a   mix of millennials, young families and longtime residents, many of them Polish. There\u2019s an almost tangible sense of community in the neighborhood, in both   businesses and   openings. For shoppers, there are appealing options in each category. Explore Greenpoint \u00bb RACHEL FELDER ________________________ Shop in NoLIta and you will see that New York City is not at all impersonal. NoLIta is a small, quaint neighborhood bordered by SoHo, Little Italy and the Lower East Side. It retains a romantic and nostalgic feel. Having recently moved back to the area, I found my perfect Saturday right outside my door: coffee at the new Caf\u00e9 Integral, followed by stops at favorites like Warm, Totokaelo and McNally Jackson, and, after running into a friend, cocktails at the Randolph at Broome. It\u2019s easy to reach via the No. 6 train to Spring Street the B, D, F or M to   or the N or R to Prince Street. Explore NoLIta \u00bb XENIA ROLLINSON ________________________ Much like each New York City neighborhood has its distinct mood, architecture and demographic, so, too, does each have its own dining and shopping. One of the most stimulating shopping districts is the Lower East Side, accessible by the F, M, J or Z trains at   Street or the B and D at Grand Street. Full of small and alluring independent boutiques, it\u2019s a   for anyone who likes to shop at locally owned stores and experience the heart and charm of the city. Explore the Lower East Side \u00bb  XENIA ROLLINSON ________________________ Clinton Hill, with its brownstones and   streets, isn\u2019t exactly the first place most people think of when they plan an afternoon of shopping in Brooklyn. But the neighborhood  \u2014   adjacent to Fort Greene and once best known for the Pratt Institute and the Navy Yard  \u2014   is worth a trip. While it\u2019s a bit spread out, a vibrant retail scene has developed in the last few years, with dynamic stores popping up on blocks that are otherwise either residential or industrial. There\u2019s a relaxed, unassuming sensibility to the community that makes it especially pleasant to stroll through it\u2019s a neighborhood in the truest sense, but welcoming even on a first visit. It\u2019s easy to get to as well: the A, C and G subways stop in Clinton Hill, about a   ride from Midtown Manhattan. Explore Clinton Hill \u00bb RACHEL FELDER'"}, "time": 1742563174.5574374}
