It\u2019s a fucking travesty is what it is,\u201d shared local Alan Healy, who had taken to dressing head to toe in Christmas lights to counteract the lack of Christmas cheer in the city. \\nDublin council defended their decision by pointing out the lights cannot be turned on until the first a person is driven insane by Christmas ads which now dominate TV. \\n\u201cThis year took a little longer, but I think it was a Laois woman who lost the plot after seeing the same Tesco ad for the 50th time that day,\u201d shared council official Aine Kilbride. \\nThe council confirmed that in an ideal world they would turn on the Christmas lights in an over the top ceremony once a week from the beginning of August. \\n\u201cSome people forget that August, September, October and November are part of Christmas and it is our job to hammer people ove rthe head with it until they want commit acts of violence against us,\u201d added Kilbride.'"}, "time": 1742562289.275918}
