[Chinese companies are investing in manufacturing plants and expanding operations in the U. S, the Wall Street Journal reports. \u201c  investment from China is booming,\u201d WSJ columnist Andrew Browne notes.  Several factors are driving the trend. One is a closing wage gap, particularly for skilled workers. Another: industrial land in the U. S. can be cheaper than in the coastal cities of China from which manufacturers can easily ship their product. Lower U. S. energy costs are also playing a role, Browne writes. The biggest factor, according to Browne, is advanced manufacturing technology \u2014  which could curb some of the   power of China\u2019s investments in the U. S. Browne calls Trump\u2019s promise to bring about a manufacturing jobs renaissance \u201cpure fantasy. \u201d Don\u2019t be so sure. Taken alone, the factors that Browne notices might not be enough to massively revive jobs making and building things in America. But they won\u2019t be \u201ctaken alone. \u201d The Trump administrations budget, for example, calls for large cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency \u2014  specifically telling the agency to quit funding the implementation of a massive expansion of the administrative state that would have raised energy costs for American consumers and businesses. At the same time, taxes on imports could push the move from \u201cMade in China\u201d to \u201cMade in the U. S. A. \u201d along even further, as the Wall Street Journal itself noted in an earlier article. \u201cA hefty U. S. import tax on goods produced in China could accelerate a trend already underway: Chinese companies setting up factories and expanding in the U. S.,\u201d WSJ\u2019s Nina Trenmann wrote in February. Far from creating the conditions for a trade war, it appears that President Donald Trump\u2019s tough talk on trade is bringing around an end to the quiet trade war waged against American workers for the last two decades. Peace \u2014  and jobs \u2014  in our time is a real possibility.'"}, "time": 1742562095.141977}
