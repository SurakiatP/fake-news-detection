Donald Trump by being more multicultural and more \u201cgay. \u201d[Head of Die Welt Ulf Poschardt wrote a combative editorial in response to an interview Mr. Trump did with the Bild tabloid on Monday. The highly negative reaction from many online forced the paper into changing the world \u201cschwuler\u201d or gay to \u201d more creative\u201d after hundreds of comments were made on the paper\u2019s website and over one thousand more on their Facebook page.  In the editorial, Mr. Poschardt claims that Germans need to oppose Donald Trump because he threatens the system of globalisation he says has greatly benefited Germany. \u201cChancellor Angela Merkel and her Cabinet have been right to promote, popularize, and engage in global politics in tough diplomatic struggle,\u201d he wrote, saying that it was good for Germans when   globalisation ideas were spread across the world. \u201cThe distribution of global prosperity will, in the future, be aggressively decided by the US in its favor  \u2014   if we do not resist and become better, more courageous, more diligent, innovative, free, open, gay and multicultural,\u201d he wrote initially with gay being replaced with \u201ccreative\u201d after the torrent of comments online. Facebook user Kirsten Zander slammed the editorial saying, \u201cWhy this martial rhetoric? To defend ourselves against the US president. Did he declare war on us? First of all, we need to take care of our own country instead of squinting at the whole world, as our chancellor does. \u201d Others took exception to the word gay being used with another Facebook user commenting, \u201cWhat has this man smoked? Why do we become more successful when we become \u201cgay\u201d and STILL \u201cmulticultural\u201d? Is there a correlation between being gay and growing multiculturalism and success?\u201d Another wrote: \u201cWhy should we be gay? More open in dealing with gays in our society, I could understand that. But why gay when it comes to Trump?\u201d The comments caused Mr. Poschardt to explain why he chose the word gay which was, according to him, \u201cwas meant in the sense of the theses of Richard Florida, The Rise of the Creative Class. When this one detail became vital and threatened to cover the rest of the comment, I changed it. \u201d After the change,   website Queer. de slammed Die Welt saying Poschardt had given in to \u201c  populists\u201d and called it \u201cembarrassing\u201d that he replaced gay with \u201ccreative\u201d rather than \u201cmore tolerant\u201d or \u201cmore diverse. \u201d The reaction to the election of Donald Trump among German media and German politicians has been highly negative since November. German Chancellor Angela Merkel went as far as to claim that Russian hacking directly influenced the election and warned it could influence the upcoming German federal election later this year.   Tiedje, chairman and primary shareholder of communications consultancy WMP Eurocom AG, slammed German media for its coverage of the   saying, \u201cwhatever he says, whatever he does, it\u2019s never right according to the German television class. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628579.9292543}
