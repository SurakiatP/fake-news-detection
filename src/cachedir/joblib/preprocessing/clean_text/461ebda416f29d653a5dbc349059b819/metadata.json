Jenna loved it Wesley not so much. We also decode the inherent racism of the sharing economy. Airbnb recently issued a report about how they plan to fight discrimination on the site.

Um, what? \u201cI\u2019ve got to be honest with you,\u201d Wesley tells Jenna on the show. \u201cIf AirbnB wants to make the avatars smaller, make mine twice as big!
