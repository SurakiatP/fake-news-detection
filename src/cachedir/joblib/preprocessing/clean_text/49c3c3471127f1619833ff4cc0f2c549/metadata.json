This may be possible because of the software installed in the FEC networks by the large IT companies. \\n\u201cAs I\u2019ve already said, their software is of poor quality, with many holes and vulnerabilities. \\n\u201cI have registered in the FEC electronic system as an independent election observer; so I will monitor that the elections are held honestly. \\n\u201cI also call on other hackers to join me, monitor the elections from inside and inform the U.S. society about the facts of electoral fraud.\u201d \\nIt is unclear what FEC information the hacker was in possession of, or was referring to, and how he intends to observe the elections. A recent video by Bev Harris of BlackBoxVoting provided a real-time demo of the GEMS vote-fraud system, \u201cfraction magic,\u201d an election theft mechanism with context and explanation. There is much more detail on the BlackBoxVoting website .

Over 5000 subcontractors and middlemen have the access to perform this for any or all clients. It can give contract signing authority to whoever the user chooses. All political power can be converted to the hands of a few anonymous subcontractors. It\u2019s a product. It\u2019s scaleable. It learns its environment and can adjust to any political environment, any demographic. It runs silently, invisibly, and can produce plausible results that really pass for the real thing. \\nIt is possible that this is the process that Guccifer is referring to, although we are merely speculating. We are confident he will provide more detail shortly. \\nWhile we wait, watch the following video explaining how elections can be (and perhaps are) rigged.\""}, "time": 1742563499.1135492}
