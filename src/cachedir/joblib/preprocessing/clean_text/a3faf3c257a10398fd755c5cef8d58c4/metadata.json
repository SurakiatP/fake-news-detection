I almost exclusively covered fires and shootings in NYC area. \u201d She added, \u201cAnd I\u2019d rather be honest about what I know and don\u2019t know in the moment. Got off air, did the research, then talked about it at 5pm on MTPD. \u201d Tur did reference the \u201cflexibility\u201d comments while hosting \u201cMTP Daily\u201d later in the day.  During an interview with Representative Francis Rooney on Monday\u2019s \u201cMSNBC Live,\u201d host Katy Tur stated that she didn\u2019t know what Rooney was referring to when he referenced (with an incorrect retelling of which Russian Obama was speaking to) President Obama telling Russia, \u201cAfter my election, I have more flexibility. \u201d Rooney said that we\u2019ll have to see what President Trump \u201cdoes, not just what he says. \u201d And that Putin is \u201ca serious character\u201d that \u201cwe need to deal forcefully with. \u201d He later predicted that Trump would be \u201cfirm\u201d with Russia. Rooney added that he didn\u2019t know what Trump meant with his comments that the US has killers as well, and \u201cI definitely think we need to protect the Baltics, and some of the talk of moving NATO exercises over to Poland and Estonia, I think\u2019s a real good idea. I think Putin is going to respond to actions. \u201d Later on, Tur stated that there were people in the Trump administration who have friendlier views of Russia than past administrations. Rooney countered, \u201cWell, I think it was Obama that leaned over to Putin [Note: Obama\u2019s comment that he\u2019d have \u2018more flexibility\u2019 after the election was said to Dmitry Medvedev, not Putin. After the interview, Rooney tweeted a correction] and said, I\u2019ll have a little more flexibility to give you what you want after the  . \u201d Tur then stated, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re referring to, Congressman. \u201d Rooney said, \u201cRemember when he leaned over at a panel discussion  \u2014   or a meeting and he said, I\u2019ll have more flexibility after the election. no one ever really pushed the president on what he meant by that, but I can only assume for a thug like Putin, that it would embolden him. \u201d Rooney tweeted after the interview, \u201cMy error, it was Medvedev that Obama whispered to about flexibility. Still projects Obama admin weakness in dealing with Russia. \u201d (  Mediaite) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742628469.8655424}
