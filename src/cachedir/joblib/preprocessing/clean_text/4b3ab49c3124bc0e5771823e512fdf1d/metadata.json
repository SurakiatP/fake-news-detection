[Professor of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Science, and Mathematics John Cushman presented new research at the International Society for Porous Media 9th International Conference in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Entitled \u201cRedox reactions in   in porous media  \u2014   membraneless battery applications,\u201d the report outlines a new type of battery, and the method by which it could be recharged with unprecedented speed.  Cushman called the growing worldwide sales of electric and hybrid vehicles \u201cincredible,\u201d but said that there remained \u201cstrong challenges\u201d for the industry and consumer alike. Chief among those concerns is the life of a hybrid or electric vehicle\u2019s battery, and the massive infrastructure development needed to keep them charged. For drivers, it boils down to practicality. The time and effort required to keep their cars running is still an ongoing hurdle. Purdue Professor Eric Nauman is the   along with Cushman, of Ifbattery  \u2014   a company exploring the commercial applications of their research. He highlighted the \u201ctremendous cost\u201d of developing infrastructure to handle the needed distribution and storage of the energy used by traditional electric vehicles. With Cushman and Nauman\u2019s new developments, they may have a solution: \u201cIfbattery is developing an energy storage system that would enable drivers to fill up their electric or hybrid vehicles with fluid electrolytes to   spent battery fluids much like refueling their gas tanks. \u201d Using fluid electrolytes to power batteries gives them a much more accessible fuel supply. Furthermore, the spent electrolytic fuel could be collected and recharged at a wind, solar, or hydroelectric power plant. Cushman said: Instead of refining petroleum, the refiners would reprocess spent electrolytes and instead of dispensing gas, the fueling stations would dispense a water and ethanol or methanol solution as fluid electrolytes to power vehicles. Users would be able to drop off the spent electrolytes at gas stations, which would then be sent in bulk to solar farms, wind turbine installations or hydroelectric plants for reconstitution or   into the viable electrolyte and reused many times. It is believed that our technology could be nearly \u2018 \u2019 ready for most of the underground piping system, rail and truck delivery system, gas stations and refineries. With the potential for clean, efficient, and reusable fuel, both hybrid and electric vehicles could be poised for a leap into mass consumer relevance. Backed up by higher capacity and recharging that is as easy as a stop at the gas station, we may be looking at the first truly pragmatic alternative to   vehicles. All that remains to be seen is whether the cost of implementation is prohibitive. If not, Purdue and Ifbattery may very well force car companies and consumers alike to take notice.
