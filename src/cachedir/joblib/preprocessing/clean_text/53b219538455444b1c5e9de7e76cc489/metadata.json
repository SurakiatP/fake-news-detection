Author and self-described \u201ccapitalist evangelist\u201d Wayne Allyn Root was giving a rambling speech as a warm-up before Der Fuhrer Donald took the stage, and while portions of it were comparable to the rantings of Charles Manson after too much caffeine, it was the language Root used (highly militaristic and warlike) that you cannot help but notice. At various points in his unhinged diatribe, Root used the following phrases : \u201cTrump warriors\u201d \u201cTrump army\u201d \u201cTrump revolution\u201d \\nThen, in full psychotic rant, Root attempted to mix together plot elements from the O.J. Simpson case with the movies Driving Miss Daisy and Thelma and Louise , telling the ecstatic crowd : \u201cIt\u2019s Hillary in a White Ford Bronco. She\u2019s got Huma driving and they\u2019re headed for the Mexican border. I have a name for the future TV movie. It\u2019s called Driving Miss Hillary. And the ending, if we all get our wish, is like Thelma and Louise!\u201d \\nFinally, Root ended his echo of Nuremberg by declaring: \u201cI will give you my country when you pry it from my cold dead hands.\u201d \\nWhen I listen to Wayne Allyn Root (or any of the other fanatical Trumpkins), the movie that comes to mind for me is One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest. \\nFeatured Image Via Right Wing Watch About Andrew Bradford \\nAndrew Bradford is a single father who lives in Atlanta.
