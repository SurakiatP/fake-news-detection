The    ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, overturned a decision by a   panel of the same court and was a setback for gun advocates. The California law requires applicants to demonstrate \u201cgood cause\u201d for carrying a weapon, like working in a job with a security threat  \u2014   a restriction sharply attacked by gun advocates as violating the Second Amendment right to bear arms. \u201cBased on the overwhelming consensus of historical sources, we conclude that the protection of the Second Amendment  \u2014   whatever the scope of that protection may be  \u2014   simply does not extend to the carrying of concealed firearms in public by members of the general public,\u201d the court said in a ruling written by Judge William A. Fletcher. The case was brought by gun owners who were denied permits in Yolo and San Diego Counties. The plaintiffs did not immediately say whether they planned to appeal to the United States Supreme Court. \u201cThis is a huge decision,\u201d said Adam Winkler, a professor of constitutional law at the University of California, Los Angeles, School of Law. \u201cThis is a major victory for gun control advocates. \u201c The Supreme Court has ruled that individuals have a right to possess a weapon in their home. Thursday\u2019s ruling centers on the next frontier in the   debate. \u201cProbably the most important battleground of the Second Amendment has been whether there is a right to carry guns outside the home, and if there is, to what extent can states and localities regulate that right,\u201d said Jonathan E. Lowy, the director of the Legal Action Project at the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Gun advocates swiftly condemned the ruling. \u201cThis decision will leave good people defenseless, as it completely ignores the fact that   Californians who reside in counties with hostile sheriffs will now have no means to carry a firearm outside the home for personal protection,\u201d Chris W. Cox, the executive director of the National Rifle Association Institute for Legislative Action, said in a statement. With Thursday\u2019s decision, the Ninth Circuit joins several other federal appeals courts in allowing state or local governments to put restrictions on the granting of   licenses. Mr. Winkler, the law professor, noted that the best indicator of whether the Supreme Court would take up a constitutional issue was there was a split among district courts. \u201cWithout a split in the circuits, the Supreme Court is less likely to take up the case,\u201d he said. But Mr. Lowy said that given the stakes of the decision  \u2014   and the long history of litigation on the issue  \u2014   he would not be surprised if the court decided to step in. \u201cThere is no circuit split, but it\u2019s certainly possible that the court could decide it wants to address this,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d be surprised but not shocked if Supreme Court took this for review. \u201d The decision by the   panel of the Ninth Circuit had thrown out the requirement that a gun owner demonstrate \u201cgood cause\u201d for getting a weapon. Within days of that decision, in 2014, counties across the state, which administer the permits, reported getting a flood of applicants seeking concealed weapons permits. Although the decision was stayed pending appeal, some county sheriffs began issuing permits the status of those permits was not immediately clear. In a dissent to Thursday\u2019s ruling by the full court, Judge Consuelo Maria Callahan said that the Second Amendment protection to gun owners that applied in the privacy of one\u2019s home  \u2014   upheld in a 2008 Supreme Court decision involving a law in Washington, D. C.  \u2014   \u201cextends beyond one\u2019s front door. \u201d \u201cLike the rest of the Bill of Rights, this right is indisputably constitutional in stature and part of this country\u2019s bedrock,\u201d she wrote. Kamala Harris, the state attorney general who asked the full court to reconsider the decision by the   panel, said the ruling \u201censures that local law enforcement leaders have the tools they need to protect public safety by determining who can carry loaded, concealed weapons in our communities. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563589.8700802}
