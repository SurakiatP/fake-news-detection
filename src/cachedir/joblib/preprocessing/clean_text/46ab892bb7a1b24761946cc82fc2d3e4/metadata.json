Border will be challenged through environmental lawsuits, according to California\u2019s   official. [California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom said in an interview with \u2018The Golden State Podcast\u2019 that he would use specific environmental laws in the state to stop the border wall from being built, at least in southern California.  \u201cThere\u2019s something called CEQA in California \u2014  NEPA at the federal level,\u201d Newsom told the podcast host. \u201cThere\u2019s indigenous lands and autonomies relating to governance on those lands. There are all kinds of obstructions as it relates to just getting zoning approval and getting building permits. All those things could be made very, very challenging for the administration. \u201d Newsom hinted that if he could not actually stop the construction of the border wall in California, he would at least try to tie it up in bureaucratic battles. Trump\u2019s border wall is reportedly in the works, as he explained at a press conference at Trump Tower today that he would not be waiting on payment from Mexico and begin construction immediately. \u201cI could wait about a year and a half until we finish our negotiations with Mexico, which will start immediately after we get into office,\u201d Trump said as Breitbart News reported earlier. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to wait. Mike Pence is leading an effort to get final approvals through various agencies and through Congress for the wall to begin. \u201d \u201cI don\u2019t feel like waiting a year or year and a half. We\u2019re going to start building,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cMexico, in some form, and there are many different forms, will reimburse us. And they will reimburse us for the cost of the wall,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat will happen, whether it\u2019s a tax or whether it\u2019s a payment. Probably less likely that it\u2019s a payment. But it will happen. \u201d John Binder is a contributor for Breitbart Texas. Follow him on Twitter at @JxhnBinder.'"}, "time": 1742628516.9107177}
