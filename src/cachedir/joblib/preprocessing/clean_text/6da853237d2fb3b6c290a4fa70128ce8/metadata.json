Lindsey Graham ( ) said he believed the congressional Democrats \u201ccleaned our clock\u201d in the proposed $1   government spending bill.  Graham said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to vote for the bill they\u2019re going to present to the Senate here soon. \u201d He continued, \u201cI think the Democrats cleaned our clock. I think there are things in this bill that I just don\u2019t understand. This is not winning from the Republican point of view. The bottom line is I don\u2019t want to shut the government down, but I don\u2019t want to continue to fund Obamacare, either and that is what we do here. \u201d He added, \u201cThere is all kinds of ways to look at it. We got more money for the military. I\u2019m for comprehensive immigration reform, but the sanctuary cities go untouched. Obamacare continues to be funded in a way we all say is illegal. The bottom line is this whole process of funding the government where the put 12 bills into one and you don\u2019t get any input, and you vote on a bill two days after you have a chance to look at it is just bad government. I think the Republican party\u2019s goal for 2018 should be to bring ever appropriation bill to the floor   rather than these giant bills. That is the best way to correct the system. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742628524.1719325}
