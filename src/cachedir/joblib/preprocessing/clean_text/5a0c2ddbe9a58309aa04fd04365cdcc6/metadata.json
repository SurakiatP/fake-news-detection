[In fact, sheriffs say the December 28 opinion handed down by Nevada Attorney General Adam Paul Laxalt basically renders the checks moot by proving them unenforceable.  Breitbart News reported that Laxalt pointed out how the language of Question 1 actually ensnared those who framed it, rendering it \u201cunenforceable\u201d by presuming the FBI would do that which the FBI refuses to do while simultaneously failing to grant the Nevada Department of Public Safety the authority to act in the FBI\u2019s stead  \u2014   as a \u201cPoint of Contact\u201d (POC) for sales in Nevada. Framers of Question 1 wanted licensed gun dealers to serve as POCs throughout the state, but the FBI refused this plan of action in a letter dated December 14. The FBI said they were willing to let the Nevada DPS serve as POC on the universal checks, but that is not possible because the DPS was not granted authority to do so by those who designed the Nevada checks. The   Journal is reporting that sheriff\u2019s across the state reacted to Laxalt\u2019s opinion by making clear that they have no plans to enforce the background checks once the January 1 effective date arrives. For example, the Lyon County Sheriff\u2019s Office voiced \u201csupport\u201d for Laxalt\u2019s opinion, saying, \u201cWe will not enforce any provisions of this ballot initiative until the issues have been resolved. \u201d Washoe County Sheriff\u2019s Office spokesman Bob Harmon said, \u201cBased on the Nevada Attorney General\u2019s opinion, the Washoe County Sheriff\u2019s Office cannot enforce this law at this time. \u201d And the Douglas County Sheriff\u2019s Office is advising residents of its county to \u201cproceed with private party firearm sells and transfers as they did prior to the passing of ballot question #1. \u201d Storey County Sheriff Gerald Antinoro went even further, saying  Question 1 \u201cis not enforceable even without the opinion. \u201d The bottom line \u2014  Bloomberg  Co. appear to have acted prematurely in celebrating the passage of gun control in Nevada.
