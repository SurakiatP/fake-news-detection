Lately, he\u2019s been shining a light on a trend that he helped cultivate  \u2014   a resurgence of humor in country music, which has made modest hits of albums that let mainstream and alternative country fans feel as if they\u2019re in on the joke. For one week in February, \u201cRedneck ____\u201d by Wheeler Walker Jr. a provocative creation of the comedian Ben Hoffman, was both the No. 1 comedy album and the No. 9 country album. Granger Smith\u2019s \u201cRemington\u201d arrived a month later, featuring jokey numbers by his outsized alter ego, Earl Dibbles Jr. And Mr. Bones\u2019s own band, the Raging Idiots, a jocular duo that also features his show producer Eddie Garcia, recently released its first   album, \u201cThe Critics Give It Five Stars,\u201d which not only made its debut atop Billboard\u2019s comedy albums chart but landed at No. 4 on the country chart. Country music has never been devoid of comedy: The Grand Ole Opry once featured the winking, rustic humor of Minnie Pearl, Grandpa Jones and Stringbean the Statler Brothers cultivated the rube alter egos Lester Roadhog Moran  the Cadillac Cowboys and Alan Jackson cast the comic Jeff Foxworthy in a music video. But at least from an outside perspective, the flirtatious party jams dominating the format in recent years seemed to repel humor. Now country is generating new, knowing ways of poking fun at itself in song. Mike Dungan, the chairman and chief executive of Universal Music Group Nashville, noted that every country songwriting era has had wits like Roger Miller and Tom T. Hall. Brad Paisley has parlayed his drollness into a   gig as a host of the Country Music Association Awards and a new one as M. C. for the Wild West Comedy Festival in Nashville. \u201cI think it\u2019s always been there,\u201d Mr. Dungan said. \u201cHowever, I do believe that in tough times, people want to feel better. I think these types of songs are a really great   to what\u2019s going on in your life. \u201d Mr. Smith, 36, enlarged his audience by capitalizing on the contrast between Granger Smith, a country centrist with a temperate, conversational vocal style, and Earl Dibbles Jr. who packs his bottom lip with tobacco and spins vigorous, nonsensical yarns. The Dibbles persona struck viral gold with a string of YouTube videos. In gentle selections like \u201cTractor\u201d and \u201cTailgate Town,\u201d Mr. Smith sentimentalizes sturdy agrarian values. \u201cThat\u2019s probably the real Granger, if you will,\u201d he said. The deliberate exaggeration of the Dibbles material is best exemplified by \u201c\u2019Merica,\u201d with its   combination of M\u00f6tley   riffs, banjo rolls and absurd patriotic bluster: \u201cWe\u2019re    undefeated world war   take a cup, raise it up for my Uncle Sam. \u201d Mr. Bones\u2019s fans have come to expect a similarly affectionate strain of irreverence. Growing up in rural Arkansas, he enjoyed the downhome clowning of Jerry Clower and Ray Stevens, but also liked Adam Sandler\u2019s sophomoric ditties. On the Raging Idiots album, he accentuated his own vocal limitations with guest performances from Carrie Underwood and Mr. Paisley. \u201cI don\u2019t want people to think I\u2019m trying to win best male vocalist at the C. M. A. s,\u201d Mr. Bones said, referring to the Country Music Association Awards. \u201cI can sing just good enough to be funny. \u201d After spending the first decade of his career in other radio formats and doing   comedy on the side, Mr. Bones\u2019s shift to anchoring a Nashville country station generated some skepticism. He and his   crew broke with the customary respectful strolls through   talking points. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t want to do the show, because they didn\u2019t know what I would ask,\u201d he said. Occasionally, Mr. Bones would encourage musicians to participate in daft parodies of their hits Florida Georgia Line and Dierks Bentley were among the many acts that obliged. As the show\u2019s ratings surged, Mr. Garcia and Mr. Bones brought their musical act to charity events. \u201cWe said if we hit a million bucks, we\u2019d try to do a comedy record,\u201d Mr. Bones said. They raised well past that. Wheeler Walker Jr. who draws an entirely different audience, has an origin story that positions him as a    outsider. To hear him tell it, he\u2019s been chewed up and spat out by every label in Nashville, ultimately recording a batch of obscene   and Southern rock numbers, the lyrics of each and every one unprintable. \u201cSome of them, this is just me spouting off bad words,\u201d he said, \u201cbut sometimes I use my brain a little bit more. \u201d (The character borrows choice autobiographical details  \u2014   like hailing from Kentucky  \u2014   from his creator, Mr. Hoffman, 41, who had a Comedy Central sketch show.) Having Dave Cobb, the Academy of Country Music\u2019s 2016 Producer of the Year, produce \u201cRedneck ____\u201d lent the project weight. Still, it required an unorthodox marketing plan, including partnering with a pornography site to preview the music. Wheeler Walker Jr. who gives interview in character, credited the album\u2019s theatrical bravado to his \u201c  aggression. \u201d When he recorded it, he said, he was fed up with \u201cmy love life, my work life, my family life, and I just let it all out. \u201cA lot of people are having those problems too,\u201d he continued, \u201cand they can listen to my album and it kind of gets it all out of their system. If you\u2019ve got those problems, Florida Georgia Line ain\u2019t gonna help,\u201d he added, referring to the duo who epitomize the \u201cbro country\u201d trend. By far the wittiest critique of bro country came from female voices striving for a mainstream hearing in 2014, when the   duo Maddie  Tae teasingly inverted bro country tropes with their debut single, \u201cGirl in a Country Song. \u201d \u201cI think that\u2019s what made the whole song, was the humor,\u201d Maddie Marlow said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want people to think, \u2018Oh, they\u2019re just whining.\u2019 We want our point to get across, but also we want people to have fun and relate to it and laugh too. \u201d These days, cheekiness like Maddie  Tae\u2019s  \u2014   which resurfaced in their singles \u201cShut Up and Fish\u201d and \u201cSierra\u201d  \u2014   is much more common in country than outright comedy is. Luke Bryan is not only country\u2019s most popular entertainer but its biggest target for impersonations by other artists, thanks to his   grin and dance moves that play up the silly side of his sex appeal. \u201cHe recognizes that as part of what he does, he\u2019s going to draw a little bit of jabbing here and there,\u201d Mr. Dungan said. \u201cYes, there is a smile to almost everything he does, and I think that\u2019s why he resonates so well. \u201d The Raging Idiots have a bit called \u201cFake Luke Bryan,\u201d in which Mr. Garcia apes Mr. Bryan\u2019s unflagging enthusiasm and glottal delivery. But Mr. Bones brushed off the notion that they would have sought the star\u2019s blessing before recording the shtick: \u201cI\u2019ve worked in alternative and pop and sports and  . This is by far the nicest,      format I\u2019ve been in. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562421.5971434}
