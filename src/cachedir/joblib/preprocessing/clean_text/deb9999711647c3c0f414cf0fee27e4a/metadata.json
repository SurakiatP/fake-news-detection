With the lack of funding in the 2017 budget, those concerns are growing. [Construction of President Trump\u2019s proposed border wall along the U. S.  Border is slated to kick off in June when 20 selected bidders will be asked to build prototypes based on the proposals they submitted, Breitbart Texas previously reported.  However, The Arizona Republic reports that some bidders are starting to have serious doubts with some already giving up on the project due to how poorly the government is managing details. Michael Hari, the founder of Crisis Resolution Security Services in Illinois, submitted a proposal but is now one of its skeptics. \u201cFrom the beginning it\u2019s not a serious process, it\u2019s not going to get the wall built,\u201d Hari said. \u201cRight from the   there were conflicts, there was not enough time given to it, to develop a reasonable process that would result in a wall getting built. \u201d Hari, a former sheriff\u2019s deputy, described to the Chicago Tribune in April his vision and reasons for wanting to work on the border wall, which is about more than money. \u201cWe would look at the wall as not just a physical barrier to immigration but also as a symbol of the American determination to defend our culture, our language, our heritage, from any outsiders,\u201d Hari said. M3 Federal, a consulting firm for contractors that has over 40 years of experience working on government contracts, warned that Washington not have a specific concept in mind for what exactly they seeking, as evidenced by multiple changes made to the requests for proposals. \u201cThe fact that things are being delayed and the fact that there are seven amendments out there just verifies the fact that the government does not have a confirmed concept about what they want to put in place,\u201d said Patrick Malyszek, owner of M3 Federal. \u201cThe way the government is handling this is actually going to create a very high risk in terms of the overall project. \u201d Among those bidders who have already given up on the border wall project is Christopher Dillon, owner of a construction management company based in Alaska. \u201cFrom the outset of the project, I have been tracking it and it\u2019s a political stunt,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cIt\u2019s burning a lot of money. It\u2019s really jerking the contracting community around. \u201d Building a wall on the U. S.  Border was a hallmark for Donald Trump\u2019s campaign. During the campaign launch at Trump Tower, he said, \u201cI would build a great wall on our southern border and I will have Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words. \u201d Despite this promise, President Trump said that he was \u201cvery happy\u201d with the $1. 2 trillion spending bill that he signed on May 5 which included $0 for a border wall. President Trump has reassured supporters that the wall is going to get built despite the setbacks in the 2017 budget in which he blamed Democrats for being \u201cobstructionists. \u201d \u201cLook, the Democrats are obstructionists that\u2019s all they can do is obstruct. They have no leadership. And we have to agree, and I think both  \u2014   both sides agree, we have to keep government going, we don\u2019t want to shut government,\u201d he said.
