The culprit? People like John Reynolds, if you listen to restaurant executives. A salesman for a convenience store distributor, Mr. Reynolds used to spend several evenings a week eating in New York restaurants with friends and relatives after making the rounds of customers in the city. But in the last year, he has taken to making turkey burgers or a pot of chili at home. \u201cIt\u2019s just a financial thing for me  \u2014   eating out is expensive,\u201d Mr. Reynolds, 31, said. \u201cAnd eating at home more has actually had an additional benefit  \u2014   it\u2019s healthier. \u201d Such words strike terror into the heart of the restaurant industry, which has blamed a crash in food prices that has made groceries cheaper for its woes. Egg prices, for instance, hit a   low this summer, and beef prices are lower than they have been in more than three years. \u201cIf I\u2019m not mistaken, it\u2019s the biggest gap we\u2019ve seen in the last 10 years,\u201d Mike Andres, the departing president of McDonald\u2019s American business, told reporters in July. \u201cThis is clearly impacting the whole   industry. \u201d The gap between grocery and restaurant prices adds to a variety of other factors putting pressure on the restaurant business, especially the   segment. Americans now have a greater interest in healthy foods. They also have more and better choices of prepared food in grocery stores, and many options for meal kit and grocery delivery services, all of which make eating at home easier. It is unclear whether these changes add up to a temporary change or the start of a major reversal in where people eat. For the last couple of decades, the general direction of food spending in the United States has been toward restaurants, and in 2014, dining out eclipsed home cooking for the first time, according to the United States Agriculture Department. \u201cThe reasons people are eating more away from home aren\u2019t going away,\u201d said Howard Elitzak, an agricultural economist at the U. S. D. A. \u201cWomen continue to enter the work force. People continue to work longer hours. Families have higher disposable income. Everyone wants convenience  \u2014   these are very   trends. \u201d Yet the Agriculture Department statistics, and individual restaurant sales figures, strongly suggest that Americans are revisiting the kitchen table. In January, for instance, people spent more in supermarkets than in restaurants, an aberration that was repeated in June. (The department\u2019s data from the Census Bureau is somewhat imprecise. For example, the supermarket numbers don\u2019t include food bought at Walmart, America\u2019s largest grocery chain.) The National Restaurant Association estimates that restaurant sales will increase 5 percent this year, to $783 billion. But B. Hudson Riehle, a senior vice president of the trade group, noted that the growth rate of those sales has slowed since 2007, partly because of the recession that started around that time. \u201cIt is still over all an environment where consumers continue to use restaurants, but for the industry, it\u2019s a more moderate growth rate than in the past,\u201d Mr. Riehle said. To help compensate for sagging profits, many restaurants have been raising prices, even as the cost of food has declined. For instance, Zoe\u2019s Kitchen, a   chain of more than 150 stores, said its sales in restaurants open at least one year had grown 4 percent. But more than 3 percent of that gain came from price increases. Slightly less than 1 percent of its sales growth came from what the industry calls \u201ctraffic\u201d  \u2014   or more customers. Diners have noticed. \u201cI definitely feel like prices at restaurants have increased,\u201d said Kathryn Shannon, who works at a financial services company in New York. Ms. Shannon, 28, began cooking at home with deliveries from Blue Apron, a meal kit service, but now she just goes to the grocery store. If she does go out for dinner, it is to a restaurant where she can get something she wouldn\u2019t make at home. \u201cI\u2019m not going to buy a really nice cut of steak because I\u2019ll probably screw it up,\u201d Ms. Shannon said. \u201cBut I can make basic Chinese food that\u2019s just as good as what I get on the corner and at a quarter of the price. \u201d Some   restaurants, where people like Ms. Shannon might go for a steak, don\u2019t appear to be having the same problem as their far bigger   cousins. Sabato Sagaria, the chief restaurant officer at the Union Square Hospitality Group, said he had noticed more tourists dining this summer in the company\u2019s restaurants, which include Gramercy Tavern and Blue Smoke in Manhattan. He expected that mix to change in the fall, when the regulars return. Nonetheless, he said, competition for customers has never been greater. \u201cRestaurants are competing with delivery services, meal kit companies, prepared foods in the grocery store, salad bars,\u201d he said. Jack Bishop, chief creative officer at America\u2019s Test Kitchen, a media company that publishes Cook\u2019s Illustrated and produces TV shows and events, said he had also noticed a difference among generations. Younger people, in his experience, seem to be more suspicious of food prepared by big corporations. And the rise of diet trends like Paleo, vegetarian and   also is spurring more home cooking, he said, because adherents have difficulty finding something they can eat on many menus. \u201cThere\u2019s also just an overall shift in the American diet to a healthier place,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter all, most of the worst trends in that diet over the last 20 years coincided with people eating less at home. \u201d One big question, of course, is whether America\u2019s new cooks will stay in the kitchen once food prices at the grocery store rise again. Inara Kalnins, a retired retail executive, said she had no plans to return to restaurants. She began cooking for herself about a year ago, after finding a deal for Blue Apron meal kits on Groupon, the online commerce site. Before that, her stove was used to heat up leftovers from restaurants or a roast chicken from the grocery store. Now she\u2019s in her kitchen three times a week, preparing meals from Blue Apron that she often shares with friends and neighbors. \u201cI\u2019m chopping and zesting and eating foods I\u2019ve never tried before,\u201d she said, \u201cwith ingredients I would have never thought of buying, like Meyer lemons and watermelon radishes. \u201d When she vacationed with a friend on a remote island off the Maine coast this summer, the mail boat delivered Blue Apron meal kits. \u201cI\u2019ve ordered so many times that I\u2019m able to gift meal kits to friends,\u201d Ms. Kalnins said. \u201cI\u2019ve given one to a friend whose wife passed away, and to my brother, who was used to eating out of a can. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563404.6669595}
