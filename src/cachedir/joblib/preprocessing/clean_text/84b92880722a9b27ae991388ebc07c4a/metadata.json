Without the media, Trump would be nowhere in this election. The real rigging by the media is their shameless reporting on documents illegally leaked by the Russians to influence our election in Donald Trump\u2019s favor. \\nTrump is a creation of the media. He has expertly played the media in this campaign, gaining vastly more coverage than Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton . He even received some 20 minutes of free coverage when the media covered a purported announcement about his claim that President Obama was not born in the United States. \\nTrump spent about 30 seconds on the birther issue and the rest of the coverage amounted to about $1 million dollars\u2019 worth of free media advertising for his campaign and, incidentally, his new hotel as well. \\nAccording to the TV News Archive, Trump has received about twice as many television mentions as Clinton: 1.1 million for Trump as compared to 571,485 for Clinton.'"}, "time": 1742628536.7339323}
