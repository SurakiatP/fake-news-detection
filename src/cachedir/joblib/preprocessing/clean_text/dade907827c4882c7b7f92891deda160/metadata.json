[Surrounded by a heavy police contingent, about 2, 000 protesters, some carrying placards saying \u201cPolice rape\u201d and \u201cPolice kill innocent people,\u201d gathered in Bobigny, northeast of the French capital, to demand \u201cJustice for Theo\u201d.  Theo, a    black youth worker, required surgery after his arrest on February 2 in the \u201c3, 000\u201d estate in the gritty suburb of    when he claims a police officer sodomised him with a baton. Projectiles were thrown at police on a footbridge with several vehicles torched and windows smashed on the sidelines of the protest, police said. \u201cSeveral hundred violent and very mobile individuals\u201d committed various \u201cacts of violence and damage,\u201d said the Paris police prefecture. In a statement it listed projectiles thrown against public buildings, four vehicles torched, two shops and a bus station damaged and several bins burned. \u201cThe police had to intervene to rescue a young child in a burning vehicle,\u201d the police said, adding however that no injuries had been reported so far during the protest. Two media vehicles were also attacked, with no casualties reported. The demonstration ended in the evening after police fired tear gas. Theo, who is still in hospital, and his family have appealed for calm after several days of protests over the alleged assault. Rape charges have been filed against the officer and all four police involved in Theo\u2019s    have been suspended pending an investigation. With a presidential election this year, the incident has become highly politicised. It has also underscored the breakdown in trust between young people and the authorities in French suburbs. \u201cAll the time, we get checks, we get assaulted, they talk trash to us, we say, \u2018Shut up\u2019  \u2026     We are given little slaps,\u201d a young man of about 20 named Kenzo told AFP. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it still exists,\u201d said    Anissa. \u201dHow can they say it\u2019s an accident?\u201d Rallies took place in other French cities, including Rouen where some 200 people demonstrated, while around 250 gathered in Toulouse and more than 300 in Nantes.'"}, "time": 1742628565.1910114}
