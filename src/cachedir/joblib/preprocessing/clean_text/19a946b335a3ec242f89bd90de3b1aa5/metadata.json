His appointment is a    swap, a conservative replacing another conservative. But there is a more instructive way to think about what Judge Gorsuch\u2019s impact will be after he is sworn in on Monday. It is to consider how the court would have been reshaped by President Barack Obama\u2019s pick for the same seat, Judge Merrick B. Garland. The answer shows just how polarized the Supreme Court has become. The titanic struggle over who would replace Justice Antonin Scalia was nothing if not partisan, and for good reason  \u2014   the Supreme Court is just as divided as the rest of the nation. Had Judge Garland replaced Justice Scalia, the court would have immediately shifted to the left. A majority of its members would have been Democratic appointees for the first time in almost 50 years. And, in a shift in recent years, partisan affiliation has become a very strong predictor of voting trends for all its members. All four of the court\u2019s current Republican appointees are more conservative than all four of the Democratic ones, and that familiar dynamic seems very likely to hold when Judge Gorsuch joins the court. But it has not always been thus. As recently as 2009, two Republican appointees to the court, Justices John Paul Stevens and David H. Souter, were members of the court\u2019s liberal wing. In losing the 2016 presidential election, Democrats may have given up the chance to change the balance of power on the Supreme Court for a generation. Judge Gorsuch is 49. If he serves as long as Justice Stevens, the last member of the court to retire, he will still be hearing cases in 2052. He would be 84, as old as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is now. Actuarial realities suggest that President Trump will have additional chances to move the court to the right. The court\u2019s three oldest members are Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, 80, a moderate conservative who holds the decisive vote in many closely divided cases, and the court\u2019s two senior liberals, Justice Stephen G. Breyer, 78, and Justice Ginsburg. Were Mr. Trump to replace any of the three, a court that generally leans right would have a   conservative majority. Were Mr. Trump to replace all three, the court\u2019s remaining liberals  \u2014   Justices Sonia Sotomayor, 62, and Elena Kagan, 56  \u2014   could find themselves writing lonely dissents for years to come. Until the Democrats\u2019 surprise loss on Election Day in November, liberals had been anticipating something entirely different. \u201cA Garland appointment would have swapped a centrist justice for a conservative one,\u201d said Pamela S. Karlan, a law professor at Stanford University. \u201cThis means Garland would have been more likely to be a key vote on more issues than Gorsuch is likely to be, because Kennedy remains the critical vote for a   conservative bloc, while Kennedy or Garland could have been the fifth vote for a liberal result. \u201d Not only would Justice Kennedy have been ousted from his central role, but Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. would have been thrust into the ideological minority. That would have put the Roberts court\u2019s least popular precedent in immediate peril, said Jamal Greene, a law professor at Columbia. \u201cThe biggest substantive change would probably have been in the area of campaign finance,\u201d he said. \u201cCitizens United would almost immediately have been on the chopping block with a liberal majority. \u201d That decision allowed corporations and unions to do what individuals had long been able to do: independently spend as much as they liked to support or oppose political candidates. \u201cI can even imagine a court with Garland on it chipping away at the    rule that forbids limits on individual campaign expenditures,\u201d Professor Greene said. A range of other liberal policy priorities could also have been preserved, even though Judge Garland is not especially liberal. \u201cWith a Justice Garland,\u201d said Elizabeth Wydra, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center, \u201cthe right for women to choose an abortion and exercise equal citizenship would have been comfortably protected. The ability of agencies to safeguard clean air and water, civil rights and workplace safety would be less threatened. Gay men and lesbians would rest secure in their marriages and not feel vulnerable to discrimination based on who they love. \u201d On the other hand, some said that Mr. Trump delivered on his campaign promise and found a nominee whose views reflected, among other things, his hostility to the administrative state, a position Judge Garland does not share. \u201cGarland has a record of deferring to the government on pretty much everything, be it labor regulation or law enforcement, while Gorsuch is much more skeptical both of government action and of judicial deference to executive agencies,\u201d said Ilya Shapiro, a fellow at the Cato Institute, the libertarian group. Judge Gorsuch is very likely to be precisely the sort of conservative Mr. Trump promised his supporters. \u201cThe justices that I\u2019m going to appoint will be \u201d Mr. Trump said at the third presidential debate in October. \u201cThey will have a conservative bent. They will be protecting the Second Amendment. \u201d Liberal despair over the future of the Supreme Court is compounded by hostility to Mr. Trump. \u201cA president with unprecedented ignorance of, and contempt for, fundamental constitutional values has gotten the opportunity to fill Justice Scalia\u2019s seat with a nominee who is likely to have a   career of moving the court to the right,\u201d Professor Karlan said. In some ways, Judge Gorsuch\u2019s impact in the short term will be modest. He will very likely vote much as Justice Scalia did. The court will thus be basically unchanged since 2006, when Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. \u2019s appointment moved it to the right. Justice Kennedy will remain at the court\u2019s center, generally leaning right but occasionally joining the court\u2019s liberal bloc, as he did in important decisions on gay rights, abortion and affirmative action. Those decisions are probably secure for now, but a newly empowered conservative majority is likely to continue the signature projects of the Roberts court: deregulating campaign finance law, allowing states to limit voting, expanding gun rights and viewing   decisions by the government with skepticism. A threat to public unions, averted by a    deadlock after Justice Scalia\u2019s death, is likely to  . Justice Breyer\u2019s campaign to do away with the death penalty will founder. Richard H. Pildes, a law professor at New York University, said the array of cases in which the actual Justice Gorsuch and the hypothetical Justice Garland might differ is vast, including on campaign finance, affirmative action, voting rights, religious freedom, class actions, and aspects of criminal and immigration law. But he cautioned in an email that the two judges should not be reduced to stereotypes. \u201cNeither Gorsuch nor Garland has written opinions in most of these areas,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut if you treat them as place holders for \u2018conservative\u2019 or \u2018liberal\u2019 outcomes  \u2014   which is too simplistic and unfair to both of them  \u2014   these are where those fault lines have been in recent years. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562214.3152812}
