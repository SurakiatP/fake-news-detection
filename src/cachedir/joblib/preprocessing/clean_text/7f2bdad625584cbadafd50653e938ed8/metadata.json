Seriously \u2013 this is reportedly happening! Fukushima reactor cooling system stops following quake & tsunami \\nThe cooling system of the third reactor at the Fukushima nuclear power plant has stopped circulating water following a powerful 7.3 offshore earthquake. \\nTokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) told national broadcaster NHK that the cooling system in the Reactor 3 spent fuel pool stopped working. Japan\u2019s national nuclear agency has confirmed that the temperature rise in the pool is \u201cgradual.\u201d The exact cause of the cooling system stoppage is currently unknown. However, the system might have been \u201cshaken\u201d during the earthquake, according to nuclear agency officials, as reported by NHK. No cooling water leaks or any other \u201cabnormalities\u201d have been reported. According to NHK, cooling equipment for the spent nuclear fuel pool in the reactor No. 3 of Tepco\u2019s Fukushima No. 2 power plant has stopped. \\n\u2014 The Japan Times (@japantimes) November 21, 2016 \\nThere may still be large waves \u2013 potentially as big as 10 feet \u2013 that hit the shores of Japan, though the size and extend, and the potential scope of the damage and/or loss of life remains to be seen. \\nOn March 11, 2011 a 9.0 magnitude earthquake struck near Japan and triggered an enormous and devastating tsunami that crippled the nuclear power plant, and exposed that world\u2019s oceans and biosphere to potential contamination. \\nFukushima is already an open wound but these new events could exacerbate the problems \u2013 or magnify them. \\nThat\u2019s why it is so completely disturbing that the powers that be never properly fixed the problems that were still ongoing after years. The situation at Fukushima Daiichi was never fully contained, and the reactors continued to leak; there is no way to stop the reactions or disable the rods. The authorities simply lied and killed all the press coverage, forcing silence on the issue, except for the online blogosphere, where the issue has lived on as a hotly debated topic that people believe is causing health problems and environmental issues on a widespread basis. RT: Video of blast at Fukushima nuke plant, radiation leak reported 2013:Fukushima Nuclear Disaster Going From Horrible To Horrendous \\nBut whatever has been swept under the rug is likely to come to the forefront if a new tsunami brings massive destruction to Japan\u2019s mainland again. \\nThe failure of the cooling systems is \u2013 for now \u2013 only the first problem to be acknowledged in news reports. The situation is ongoing, and less than 24 hours have passed. \\nConsidering that the corporate and government authorities in Japan made a concerted effort to silence bad news and pretend the problem away, there is no reason to believe that transparent coverage about what happens after this new earthquake and tsunami will be forthcoming. \\nSo keep your eyes open, and your screen\u2019s recording what is being reported and what other information comes out. \\nRT has continued live coverage of the events in Japan. \\nThe reality of a potential catastrophe compounding the existing damage at Fukushima, and to everything its waters touch, simply may not be reported. \\nThe powers that be on the Internet, and in the spheres of politics, are going out of their way to censor the grassroots media that thrives online, and are using 21st Century gestapo tactics to silence what they are labeling \u201cfalse news.\u201d \\nThis story may be updated as more information becomes available. \\nFlashback:'"}, "time": 1742563130.8948054}
