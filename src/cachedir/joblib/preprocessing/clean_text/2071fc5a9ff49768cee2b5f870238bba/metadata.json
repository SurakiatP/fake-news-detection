Slaughterhouses proliferated in the west of Uttar Pradesh, and the surrounding villages underwent an economic transformation. Children raised on plain roti began to eat lentils twice a day. But that spurt of prosperity came under threat this week, when a new   government in the state, led by the fiery cleric Yogi Adityanath, began shutting down parts of the   buffalo meat industry. Hindu activists say the industry conceals the illegal slaughter of cows, which are sacred to Hindus. Though Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s governing party has long balanced its commitment to   development against its embrace of   Hindu causes, it has rarely made such a stark choice between them. The state\u2019s new leaders promise more meat factories will be shut in the coming days, and they say the blow to the economy is less important than the principle of protecting the cow. \u201cThe government should do it on moral grounds,\u201d said Karunesh Nandan Garg, 57, president of the Meerut division of the governing Bharatiya Janata Party. He cited the example of prostitution in Thailand, which is largely tolerated by the authorities and \u201ca major revenue producer\u201d there. \u201cBut is that right? Money isn\u2019t everything. \u201d Uttar Pradesh is India\u2019s largest   state, with 41 of the country\u2019s 75 licensed slaughterhouses and meat processing plants, according to the Commerce Ministry. Scores more operate without licenses, and an exhaustive list of laws govern the slaughter, transport and sale of meat, so the government can easily find a pretext to shut even licensed businesses. On Hapur Road, which is lined with slaughterhouses and meatpacking plants, economic activity had ground to a halt within days of Mr. Adityanath\u2019s  . District officials sealed seven factories in the area on Tuesday and Wednesday, citing irregularities in paperwork. The police were ordered to patrol the plants and search vehicles for cows, so frightening suppliers that they stopped delivering buffaloes. Workers, told to go home for the day, had instead gathered in tea stalls, nervously trading reports. \u201cWe are waiting to see what the government decides,\u201d said Muhammad Akhtar, a migrant from Bihar who has worked in the meat factories for 20 years, earning around 10, 000 rupees, about $150, in a good month. \u201cModi has said he wants economic development for everyone,\u201d Mr. Akhtar said. \u201cThis job has allowed my children to eat and go to school. All we want is peace, to be allowed to work in peace. \u201d Life in this strip of villages had changed drastically with the advent of the meat factories a decade ago, people here said. Mud huts, which routinely collapsed during the monsoon, had been replaced by solid brick buildings. Men working in the factories had begun to invest in motor scooters. Women had been pulled into the work force, abruptly doubling family incomes. Mr. Akhtar said he could afford to remain in Uttar Pradesh for two weeks without pay, and then he would have no choice but to return to his native village, along with thousands of other migrant workers who gravitated here for jobs. Other men clustered around him  \u2014   peddlers, truck dispatchers, factory supervisors, cleaners, butchers. Some of them warned that further pressure on the industry would lead to violence. \u201cSuppose that there are five people in a single family working here, and they are all jobless,\u201d said Muhammad Majid, 21, who has been working at a slaughterhouse since he was 15. \u201cIf there are riots, they will be difficult to contain. \u201d Most Indians were not aware that buffalo meat overtook rice as the country\u2019s largest food export in 2015. The industry\u2019s growth has gone unnoticed mainly because of religious sensitivities: Meatpacking, like leather, is a sector dominated by Muslims, who make up around 19 percent of this state\u2019s population. Though it is legal to slaughter buffalo when they are old and can no longer give milk,   Hindu groups have long suggested that cows were being spirited into the facilities, and they have routinely intercepted supply vehicles for aggressive searches. In January, in its manifesto ahead of Uttar Pradesh\u2019s state elections, the B. J. P. promised to take a step further: to shut down \u201call illegal slaughterhouses\u201d and restrict mechanized ones. It was not clear this week whether that campaign would extend to the largest meatpacking businesses, which are licensed by the government and bring in vast amounts of revenue. Some people in the Muslim neighborhoods dependent on meat processing said they doubted that it would. \u201cLook at the numbers,\u201d said Nadeem Chauhan, a politician with the    Bahujan Samaj Party. \u201cWhy do you think the central government and the prime minister have not already shut down this business? It\u2019s the biggest cash generator for the government. It brings in foreign currency. \u201d That optimism was not apparent on Hapur Road, where the face of the   campaign was Sanjay Chaturvedi, a district veterinary officer. Mr. Chaturvedi was making rounds of the area\u2019s factories wearing a red tilak, the smudge of vermilion applied after Hindu prayers, and a Los Angeles Lakers cap. He said he had often tried to take action against slaughterhouses on environmental grounds but had never been free to do so because they had protectors in the previous,   government. \u201cAs soon as I would approach a factory, I would get a call from some politician,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople in government had their hands in the business. \u201d That had changed almost as soon as the new chief minister was sworn in. His new orders were to be on \u201chigh alert,\u201d and Mr. Chaturvedi happily complied, cruising around surrounding factories with his new police escort. At midday, Mr. Chaturvedi passed a chicken feed factory called Universal India and caught a whiff from its   vats that he described as \u201cvery, very foul. \u201d \u201cThe smell seemed to indicate that there were cow parts there, inside the factory,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know it from the smell. \u201d He proceeded to the gate and informed the factory\u2019s owner, Aas Muhammad, that his vehicles would be searched for illicit cow parts. Mr. Muhammad protested that his plant, which employs 150 people, does not slaughter animals at all, but instead uses byproducts discarded by   slaughterhouses. When that proved unpersuasive, he charged out onto the roadway after Mr. Chaturvedi, his hands shaking with rage and anxiety. He shouted to a waiting camera crew that the inspector had for years solicited bribes, most recently of 200, 000 rupees. Mr. Chaturvedi brushed the accusation aside, saying, \u201cOh, that is nothing, that is nothing. \u201d \u201cYou go and prove that this smell is coming from our factory,\u201d said the owner\u2019s brother, Wasim Qureshi. \u201cYou will see, you will see!\u201d Mr. Chaturvedi shouted as he drove away. His day was close to its end, and he was in a good mood. Of the 10 working meat factories on this road, he said, four would be shuttered by the summer. A detachment of police officers and state officials pulled up to Universal India on Wednesday morning and sealed the premises, by orders of the state government. Mr. Muhammad sent his workers home, asking them to be patient before seeking other jobs. \u201cThey will wait for the next week, maybe 10 days,\u201d he said. \u201cThen, some of them will end up pulling rickshaws. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561917.7677996}
