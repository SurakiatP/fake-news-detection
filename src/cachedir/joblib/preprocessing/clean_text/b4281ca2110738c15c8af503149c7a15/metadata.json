The compromise measure, drafted by Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, had emerged as the one piece of legislation since the mass shooting in Orlando, Fla. with a chance of winning bipartisan support and passage in Congress. The measure, which had been in danger of failing because of Republican opposition, would block gun sales to anyone on the government\u2019s   list or the   \u201cselectee\u201d list of people subjected to heightened screening before they are allowed to board a plane. Republican leaders, however, had expressed deep misgivings about the bill because they said it would deny due process to individuals who might have ended up on the lists without just cause. That left them in a quandary of how to stall the measure without allowing Democrats to gloat that Republicans were so opposed to tighter gun restrictions that they defeated even a bill offered by a member of their own party. The solution was a procedural maneuver by which the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, scheduled the bill for a vote on a motion to table it. By voting not to table it, Republicans could keep it alive without advancing or defeating it outright  \u2014   putting it in a sort of legislative purgatory. Supporters of the measure sought to preserve some hope, but it was a reach. \u201cIt is absolutely not dead,\u201d said Senator Heidi Heitkamp, Democrat of North Dakota, who was a main partner with Ms. Collins in drafting the proposal and selling it to Democrats. But asked whether the measure was still alive, Ms. Heitkamp was less certain. \u201cWell, we\u2019ll see,\u201d she replied.'"}, "time": 1742562244.8493757}
