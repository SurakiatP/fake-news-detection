(Photo: Unicorn Riot/Creative Commons) \\nSTANDING ROCK SIOUX RESERVATION, North Dakota \u2014 Law enforcement commenced a violent crackdown on Native American activists blocking construction on the Dakota Access pipeline on Thursday, resulting in over 100 arrests and multiple injuries. \\nAt least 107 people were arrested and both Native American \u201cwater protectors\u201d and members of the media were harmed when hundreds of militarized riot police, accompanied by armored vehicles and the National Guard, stormed a blockade on North Dakota Highway 1806 and an accompanying encampment. \\nAmong the injured was Derrick Broze , an independent journalist reporting for MintPress News from the Standing Rock Sioux reservation this week. He was shot with pepper spray and shocked with a \u201cless-lethal\u201d taser. Police also took his smartphone, which he had been using to document the day\u2019s events via Facebook Live. \\n\u201cToday was filled with tense moments as the Morton County Sheriff\u2019s Department and other law enforcement moved to destroy the frontline camp in a militarized fashion,\u201d Broze told MintPress News, using a borrowed smartphone. He continued: \u201cThe water protectors chose to set fire to several barricades on [county road] 134 and [North Dakota Highway] 1806 in an attempt to hold their line. Despite identifying as press several times, the police tasered and pepper sprayed myself and several others.\u201d http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Broze-Standing-Rock-2.mp4 \\nTwo members of Unicorn Riot, an independent media collective, were also attacked by police, and Native American livestreamers reported being hit by rubber bullets.

An activist posted a picture of severe facial bruising reportedly caused by a rubber bullet. Other injuries of varying severity were reported via social media and confirmed by sources at the scene.

Live feeds of the police raid frequently cut out, and on-the-ground sources reported that cellular phone signals appeared to be jammed.

Police fired on the horses and their riders, reportedly injuring some of each.

The water protectors, however, claim that the land belongs to the Sioux under the terms of an 1851 treaty . The new encampments also bordered on a sacred burial ground where Dakota Access pipeline security personnel used attack dogs on activists on Labor Day. \\nBy Thursday evening, police, security and National Guard had completely overrun the region, pushing water protectors back onto the reservation and onto land claimed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. \\nIn one of the most disturbing reports, confirmed by Broze and social media reports, a Dakota Access pipeline security guard reportedly drove his truck onto tribal lands, threatening to run down protesters, then brandished what appeared to be an AR-15 assault rifle in the Oceti Sakowin camp. A source in the camp told MintPress that the situation was eventually de-escalated by police under the Bureau of Indian Affairs. My friends on scene say this is the civilian who almost ran down at least 30 Natives with a car. It\\'s open season on our people. #NoDAPL pic.twitter.com/W2lWyZlYAn \\n\u2014 Kelly Hayes (@MsKellyMHayes) October 27, 2016 \\nTeepees, a sweat lodge, and other sacred items were also destroyed by police. \\n\u201cPolice showed no respect for the native people or their culture,\u201d Broze said. http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Broze-Standing-Rock.mp4 \\nAs night set in, the situation appeared to be escalating further. Broze reported : \u201cRiot police have raided resistance camps and are still firing tear gas at protesters north of Red Warrior camp on 1806. Protesters have set an SUV on fire as a barricade on the bridge there. They are also setting the bridge on fire.\u201d Be Sociable, Share!'"}, "time": 1742563708.3271549}
