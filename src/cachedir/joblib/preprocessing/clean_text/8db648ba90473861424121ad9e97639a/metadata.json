[As Lizza notes, the issues that animate Bannon\u2019s worldview and propelled Trump to victory were left off the CPAC agenda in the 2013 conference following Mitt Romney\u2019s failed presidential campaign. That year, Bannon, then the executive chairman of Breitbart News, organized an \u201cUninvited\u201d panel of speakers to discuss such pressing topics as illegal immigration, crony capitalism, and radical Islam.  From The New Yorker: The   appearance was a reminder of how quickly Bannon\u2019s view of conservatism came to defeat Priebus\u2019s. Back in March, 2013, Bannon was something of an outcast at CPAC. In the wake of Mitt Romney\u2019s loss in the 2012 Presidential election, conservatives were trying to emphasize their movement\u2019s diversity and tolerance. The prevailing takeaway from the election was that the right had grown too old, too white, and too intolerant \u2014  and so CPAC, which often serves as an incubator for ideas emerging on the far right, needed to downplay the fringes of the movement.   \u2026     Bannon, who was the head of Breitbart News, roamed the halls as a disgruntled and dishevelled fringe player. Before the conference, he had scanned the schedule and complained that CPAC\u2019s organizers had cast out the voices representing what he viewed as the real issues on the right: the threat from Islam, illegal immigration, and corporate America\u2019s influence on politics. He organized an evening of counterprograming to highlight those issues, which he called the Uninvited. Even at the most conservative gathering in America, Bannon liked to play the role of aggrieved outsider. On the CPAC sidelines, Bannon described his alternative lineup to an interviewer: \u201cA former Attorney General from the Bush Administration talking about jihad and the \u00e9lites\u2019 inability to recognize it. Peter Schweitzer talking about crony capitalism. Pam Geller, Robert Spencer, Frank Gaffney, Nina Shea talking about the global persecution of Christians. These are huge topics. Illegal immigration. These are huge issues. They have to be vetted. \u201d Read the rest here. '"}, "time": 1742562347.119904}
