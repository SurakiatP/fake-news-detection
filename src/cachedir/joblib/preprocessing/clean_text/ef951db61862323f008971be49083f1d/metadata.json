Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, elevating a conservative in the mold of Justice Antonin Scalia to succeed the late jurist and touching off a brutal, partisan showdown at the start of his presidency over the ideological bent of the nation\u2019s highest court. Mr. Trump announced his selection during a   evening ceremony that unfolded in prime time at the White House. He described Judge Gorsuch, a federal appeals court judge based in Denver, as \u201ca man who our country really needs, and needs badly, to ensure the rule of law and the rule of justice. \u201d \u201cJudge Gorsuch has outstanding legal skills, a brilliant mind, tremendous discipline and has earned bipartisan support,\u201d Mr. Trump said, standing beside the judge and his wife, Louise, as White House officials and Republican lawmakers looked on. \u201cIt is an extraordinary r\u00e9sum\u00e9  \u2014   as good as it gets. \u201d But Democrats  \u2014   embittered by Republican refusals for nearly a year to consider President Barack Obama\u2019s choice to succeed Justice Scalia, and inflamed by Mr. Trump\u2019s aggressive moves at the start of his tenure  \u2014   promised a showdown over Judge Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation. Joined by liberal groups that plotted for weeks to fight Mr. Trump\u2019s eventual nominee, leading Democrats signaled they would work to turn the Supreme Court dispute into a referendum on the president, and what they contend is his disregard for legal norms and the Constitution. Conservatives and business groups cheered Judge Gorsuch, calling his record distinguished and his qualifications unparalleled. The announcement came at a particularly tumultuous moment in an extraordinarily chaotic beginning to Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency. Just a day earlier, he dismissed the acting attorney general for refusing to defend his   immigration order that started a furor across the United States over what critics condemned as a visa ban against Muslims. \u201cNow, more than ever, we need a Supreme Court justice who is independent, eschews ideology, who will preserve our democracy, protect fundamental rights and will stand up to a president who has already shown a willingness to bend the Constitution,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said in a statement. \u201cThe burden is on Judge Neil Gorsuch to prove himself to be within the legal mainstream and, in this new era, willing to vigorously defend the Constitution from abuses of the executive branch and protect the constitutionally enshrined rights of all Americans,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. He said he would insist that Judge Gorsuch meet the   threshold needed in the Senate to overcome a filibuster for his confirmation to move forward. That would either require eight Democrats to join the Senate\u2019s 52 Republicans to advance the nomination, or force Republicans to escalate a parliamentary showdown  \u2014   as Mr. Trump has already urged them to do  \u2014   to change longstanding rules and push through his nominee on a simple majority vote. Republicans and conservative groups signaled they relished a war over Judge Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation. \u201cI hope members of the Senate will again show him fair consideration and respect the result of the recent election with an    vote on his nomination, just like the Senate treated the four   nominees of Presidents Clinton and Obama,\u201d said Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader. He noted that the Senate confirmed Judge Gorsuch without opposition in 2006 to his current seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit. Carrie Severino, the chief counsel for the Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative group that immediately started a $10 million campaign to defend Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee, said the coalition would mount intensive campaigns in crucial states to \u201cforce vulnerable senators to choose between obstructing and keeping their Senate seats. \u201d If confirmed, Judge Gorsuch would become the 113th justice and take a seat held not only by Justice Scalia, but also by Justice Robert H. Jackson, perhaps the finest writer to have served on the court. As an Episcopalian, Judge Gorsuch would be the only Protestant seated among five Catholics and three Jewish jurists. He would restore the    split between conservatives and liberals on the court, returning the swing vote to Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, whose rulings have fallen on both sides of the political spectrum. At 49, Judge Gorsuch (pronounced  ) is the youngest nominee to the Supreme Court in 25 years, underscoring his potential to shape major decisions for decades to come. In choosing him, Mr. Trump reached for a reliably conservative figure in Justice Scalia\u2019s mold, but not someone known to be divisive. Mr. Trump, who recognized Justice Scalia\u2019s wife, Maureen, in the audience as he announced his choice, heaped praise on the \u201clate, great\u201d jurist, saying his \u201cimage and genius was in my mind throughout the   process. \u201d Judge Gorsuch said he was humbled by his \u201cmost solemn assignment. \u201d \u201cI will do all my powers permit to be a faithful servant of the Constitution and laws of this great country,\u201d he said. He also praised Justice Scalia as \u201ca lion of the law. \u201d The announcement reopened the bitter wounds that dominated the political battle last year over Mr. Obama\u2019s nominee for the seat, Judge Merrick B. Garland. Republicans refused to even consider  \u2014   much less support  \u2014   his nomination in the thick of a presidential campaign. A Colorado native who was in the same class at Harvard Law School as Mr. Obama, Judge Gorsuch is known for his   measured opinions that are normally, though not exclusively, conservative. He holds a doctorate from Oxford University, where he was a Marshall Scholar, and was a Supreme Court law clerk to Justices Byron R. White and Kennedy. That Judge Gorsuch has a personal connection to Justice Kennedy is no accident. By choosing a familiar figure, several officials said, the White House is sending a reassuring signal to Justice Kennedy, 80, who has been mulling retirement. Choosing a more ideologically extreme candidate, the officials said, could have tempted Justice Kennedy to hang on to his seat for several more years, depriving Mr. Trump of another seat to fill. Still, Judge Gorsuch\u2019s conservative credentials are not in doubt. He has voted in favor of employers, including Hobby Lobby, who invoked religious objections for refusing to provide some forms of contraception coverage to their female workers. And he has criticized liberals for turning to the courts rather than the legislature to achieve policy goals. \u201cIt is the role of judges to apply, not alter, the work of the people\u2019s representatives,\u201d he said on Tuesday. \u201cA judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge, stretching for results he prefers rather than those the law demands. \u201d Judge Gorsuch is the son of Anne Gorsuch Burford, who became the first female head of the Environmental Protection Agency under President Ronald Reagan. He attended Georgetown Preparatory School, outside Washington, before going to Columbia University. There had been some speculation that Mr. Trump would choose someone with a less elite background for the court. The other finalist for the post, Judge Thomas M. Hardiman, was the first person in his family to graduate from college, and helped pay for his education by driving a taxi. The White House stoked suspense over Mr. Trump\u2019s court choice in the hours before announcing it. A senior Trump administration official said both Judge Gorsuch and Judge Hardiman were summoned to Washington for the nomination ceremony. But only Judge Gorsuch appeared at the White House gathering shortly after 8 p. m. In an allusion to the intense foreshadowing he and his team did to encourage interest and speculation over the pick, Mr. Trump interrupted his own announcement to marvel at his showmanship: \u201cSo was that a surprise?\u201d the president said after announcing Judge Gorsuch\u2019s name. \u201cWas it?\u201d As he looked out into an audience that Democrats had refused to join  \u2014   several senior lawmakers declined his invitation to attend the East Room ceremony  \u2014   the president expressed hope that he could avoid a partisan battle. \u201cI only hope that both Democrats and Republicans can come together for once, for the good of the country,\u201d Mr. Trump said. But progressive groups had already gathered at the steps of the Supreme Court to protest a nominee they predicted would be extreme. Nan Aron of the   Alliance for Justice called Judge Gorsuch \u201ca disastrous choice,\u201d adding that his record showed \u201cno sign that he would offer an independent check on the dangerous impulses of this administration. \u201d Conservatives were as ardent in their support. Tom Fitton, the president of the   group Judicial Watch, called Mr. Trump\u2019s nomination \u201ca major step in the right direction in defining his presidency and moving the Supreme Court away from dangerous and destructive judicial activism. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561657.8716128}
