And John LaBarbera and Craig Starling, wearing rainbow \u2018Gays for Trump\u2019 T-shirts, made sure they were there. Breitbart \u201cWe\u2019re concerned about the possibility of Musilm terrorism and anti-gay violence such as the deadly attack on a gay nightclub in Orlando,\u201d Starling told Breitbart News. \u201cTrump is better on security and immigration.\u201d LaBarbera, who drove with Starling from Savannah, Georgia, to attend the rally, agreed, adding that he also preferred Trump\u2019s economic policies. He said that he had lost several yard signs to theft, and had endured hate on Facebook. But he added that people at Savannah\u2019s gay pride rally had been \u201ckind\u201d when they set up a booth for Trump, and that Trump fans at the rally had been \u201csupportive\u201d as well. Other \u201cGays for Trump\u201d signs have been popping up at Trump rallies elsewhere in the Sunshine State. One supporter waved a homemade sign at Trump\u2019s rally in Orlando on Wednesday. And Trump emerged onstage in Colorado on Sunday holding a rainbow flag with the words \u201cLGBTs for Trump\u201d written on it. More and more gays are supporting Donald Trump. In light of the Orlando terror attack they realize that Trump is the only one who will keep them safe. Hillary helped to create ISIS with her bumbling handling of Libya and the killing of Muammar Gaddafi. In addition, Hillary Clinton supports and takes millions of dollars from Saudis, who not only abuse and execute gays, they also treat women like second-class citizens.'"}, "time": 1742563571.159013}
