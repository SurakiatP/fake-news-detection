[While he failed in his aim of starting a \u201cpatriotic revolution,\u201d Wilders has already succeeded in shifting the debate and the tone in Dutch politics on immigration and integration, observers said.  Campaigning on an   ticket, the   politician saw his hopes wilt from an   high in January when opinion polls had said he could win as many as 37 seats in the   Dutch lower chamber. Instead, he captured a more sobering 20 seats in Wednesday\u2019s general elections, behind the 33 won by the Liberal party of Prime Minister Mark Rutte, but enough to place his Freedom Party (PVV) second. \u201cIt would have been great if we were the largest, but we\u2019re willing to talk and help govern. That\u2019s my hope,\u201d Wilders told journalists Thursday. But he warned his party would \u201cshow our hard opposition side\u201d if he were excluded. The long process to form the next government has begun with the VVD sounding out other parties to try to cobble together a coalition. Most parties leaders, including Rutte, have already vowed not to work with Wilders, alienated by his fiery     rhetoric, and his    attitude.  \u2014   Long shadow  \u2014   But analysts say Wilders, who quit the VVD in 2006 to set up his party, will continue to cast a long shadow across the Dutch political landscape and has already succeeded in pulling the lowlands country to the right. \u201cWhat\u2019s telling is that many parties, including Rutte\u2019s VVD, have already taken on some of the PVV\u2019s viewpoints and content  \u2026     particularly when it comes to immigration policies,\u201d said Matthijs Rooduijn, a political sociologist at Utrecht University. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that parties like the VVD  \u2026     suddenly moved to the   but there certainly is a shift in that direction,\u201d he said. \u201cMost parties have become more nationalist and that\u2019s because of the PVV\u2019s influence,\u201d he said. With Wilders likely to end up the largest party in opposition, more clashes are also forecast, such as with rising young   star Jesse Klaver, whose GroenLinks party upped their seats from four to 14. Wilders will also likely lock horns with the progressive leader of Democracy party D66, Alexander Pechtold, which the PVV beat into third place with 19 seats. Should D66 or GroenLinks enter government with Rutte \u201cthe clash is going to continue when it comes to social and cultural topics. And the sparks are going to fly,\u201d Rooduijn said.  \u2014   \u2018Bland political elites\u2019  \u2014   Wilders, who already triggered the collapse of one Rutte government in 2012, could also seek to exploit the fragmented nature of the next coalition which will be made up of at least four and maybe five parties, Rooduijn said. \u201cHe could argue the new cabinet is making too many compromises and   deals  \u2014   it will give him extra ammunition for his populist message that there\u2019s a bland political elite who still won\u2019t listen to voters\u2019 concerns,\u201d he said. \u201cThe outcome of this election does not at all mean the end of Geert Wilders and the issues that he is advocating,\u201d said Claes de Vreese, politics professor at the University of Amsterdam. \u201cHe remains an important force in Dutch and European politics. He had more votes and increased his number of seats, even though it was not this \u2018people\u2019s revolution\u2019 that he was claiming. \u201d Wilders was hailed by European   leaders too, ahead of other key elections in France and Germany this year, who said his polls performance was far from a defeat. His success \u201cproves that the ideas we share are advancing in the various European countries,\u201d said Marine Le Pen, leader of France\u2019s National Front, who is hoping to upset the French presidential elections. \u201cIgnore the froth: whilst the establishment did cling on, they took a beating at this election,\u201d wrote the new   British blog Westmonster. Wilders\u2019s notoriety has already spread across the Atlantic. Trevor Noah, who hosts the popular US late night programme \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d gave Wilders and his \u201chateful\u201d message a roasting Thursday, comparing his blond mesh to Donald Trump, and likening him to a blond villan played by the actor Christopher Walken\u2019s in \u201cBatman Returns. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562955.5636573}
