But Mr. Mabag, 54, who runs a neighborhood volunteer association in a sprawling Manila slum, still enthusiastically supports Mr. Duterte, saying that his policies will make the country safer and more orderly. \u201cI\u2019m delighted,\u201d said Mr. Mabag, who was wearing a Duterte  . \u201cThis is the only time I\u2019ve seen a president like this, who says exactly what he wants to say. \u201d The rest of the world may have trouble understanding this, but Mr. Duterte still commands ardent support in the Philippines. Since he took office in June promising to kill drug addicts and dealers, about 1, 400 people have been killed by the police in antidrug operations, and hundreds more by vigilantes. His embrace of violence has shocked other countries and brought condemnation from human rights groups. He has compared himself to Hitler (and later apologized) called President Obama a \u201cson of a whore,\u201d and joked after an Australian missionary was raped and killed that \u201cshe was so beautiful\u201d he should have been first to rape her. He has lashed out at the pope, despite leading a nation that is overwhelmingly Roman Catholic, and cursed the United Nations and the European Union. No matter. For many Filipinos, Mr. Duterte\u2019s passionate outbursts, however crude and impolitic, are signs of his fearlessness and willingness to act. The weak leadership of previous presidents, they say, led to high rates of violent crime, drug use, woefully inadequate infrastructure and widespread poverty. The first national polls since Mr. Duterte became president came out this week, showing that his outbursts and the mounting body count have barely dented his extraordinary popularity. One poll, conducted in late September, found that 83 percent of Filipinos had \u201cmuch trust\u201d in him, compared with 84 percent in June, after he was elected but before he took office. The other showed his trust rating falling slightly, to 86 percent in September from 91 percent in July. \u201cHis initiatives, and this includes the antidrug campaign, are well received by the people,\u201d said Ramon C. Casiple, executive director of the Institute for Political and Electoral Reform. \u201cThey don\u2019t have an impact on the overall perception of his administration or presidency. \u201d While Mr. Duterte\u2019s antidrug campaign and outrageous statements have received all the attention abroad, he has pushed ahead with an array of progressive social policies that have won him broad support in the Philippines. Lorraine Badoy, a dermatologist and a volunteer at a nongovernmental organization who lives in one of Manila\u2019s gated communities, acknowledges that the president\u2019s outbursts make her cringe. \u201cI just wish he\u2019d shut up sometimes,\u201d she said. But she says she is more enamored of his social policies than she is concerned about the casualties of the antidrug campaign. In Mr. Duterte, she said: \u201cI see something that I have not seen in a long time in the Philippines, which is that he cares. He cares for the small guy, which is very important to me. \u201d His government has paved the way for indigenous people displaced by mining and logging to return to their ancestral lands, has committed to providing free irrigation to subsistence farmers, has suspended the operations of mining companies that violated environmental protection laws, and has begun a program of free checkups for the 20 million poorest Filipinos. His support has blossomed on social media  \u2014   followers on the most popular   pages number in the millions  \u2014   which his administration has cannily harnessed. Social media catapulted Mr. Duterte to the presidency, says his communications secretary, Martin Andanar, and it remains a bastion of support in the face of what Mr. Andanar considers negative coverage by international and local news media. \u201cIt is very important for our team to maintain, and even encourage  \u2014   foster  \u2014   the relationship of the different social media patriots of President Duterte,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do it by reaching out to them, they reach out to us. \u201d Mr. Duterte\u2019s social media team, which Mr. Andanar oversees, selects a weekly message, often tied to the news, and creates posts it hopes will be reposted and widely shared by supporters. He said he recently told followers on social media that \u201cthe crime news has been blown out of proportion, and nobody\u2019s listening to our economic policies. \u201d So even as the value of the Philippine peso began to slip last week, Mr. Duterte\u2019s supporters were arguing that a weakened currency increased the buying power of remittances sent back by Filipinos working overseas. When Mr. Duterte likened himself to Hitler, his supporters rushed to defend him on social media, arguing that the comment was precipitated by a remark by former President Benigno S. Aquino III, who compared Mr. Duterte to Hitler five months earlier. The argument aligned with ones made the same day by administration officials. \u201cIt is a matter of record that the reference to Hitler did not originate from the president,\u201d his spokesman Ernesto Abella said in a statement. A   site went further, posting photographs of two Reuters journalists it accused of causing the furor by misrepresenting Mr. Duterte\u2019s words, and calling for their punishment. The post was shared thousands of times on social media and whipped up an untold number of commenters, who created a flurry of threats and insults. Mocha Uson, a blogger with 4. 2 million followers on Facebook, shared the images, adding the caption in Tagalog, \u201cEnemies of change. \u201d Critics of Mr. Duterte have been threatened with rape and a variety of deaths, including by hanging, drowning and, as one   doctor suggested to Emily Rauhala, who has written about the Philippines for The Washington Post, that she crawl back into her mother\u2019s uterus and suffocate. Mr. Andanar said that the administration did not condone threats of violence on social media. So far, none has been carried out. However, he said, \u201cI cannot blame the Duterte social media patriots when they protect the president and when they do everything that they can to pounce on the enemy. \u201d Many Duterte supporters say their cause is unfairly portrayed in the mainstream news media. But Melinda Quintos de Jesus, executive director of the Center for Media Freedom, said that threats by   online mobs had intimidated the national news media. The local news media has published some criticism and several reports on specific cases of extrajudicial killings, she said, but the major television stations and newspapers have failed to produce critical analyses of Mr. Duterte\u2019s policies. \u201cThey like him, they fear him,\u201d she said. \u201cThey basically are afraid to be singled out. \u201d In The Hague on Thursday, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Fatou Bensouda, issued a blunt warning to the government, saying that the violent   crackdown could become a target of a criminal investigation because   killing fell within the jurisdiction of the court. There are signs, in some quarters at least, that the killings have begun to tarnish Mr. Duterte\u2019s popularity. In a slum in Pasay, a district of greater Manila, on a recent Saturday, Migo Paladio, 24, stood in a narrow alley and watched the crowds from two wakes spill out. They were for men killed by vigilantes on the presumption that they were drug dealers. Mr. Paladio, a technician, said they were not dealers. He said they were among 10 people he knew who had been killed in the last three months in Mr. Duterte\u2019s antidrug campaign. He voted for Mr. Duterte, but he said his support was wavering. \u201cI was wrong about what I thought was going to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s prioritizing the killings too much. And we have six more years of this. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564163.4191346}
