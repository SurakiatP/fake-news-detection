Ms. Latroche, a sociology student who is Muslim, came to Mass in the Rouen Cathedral on Sunday to pay tribute to the Rev. Jacques Hamel, the priest who was killed last week by two young men acting in the name of the Islamic State. \u201cThey welcomed us very nicely, me and my friend,\u201d said Ms. Latroche, who was wearing a pale blue veil as she entered the church with a mixture of respect and shyness. She said she was shocked about what had happened to the priest, and even more so by the age of one of the killers, Adel Kermiche: 19, just like her. \u201cI have not even started my life yet, and he basically ruined his and so many others\u2019,\u201d Ms. Latroche said. \u201cI don\u2019t get it. \u201d In the wake of Father Hamel\u2019s murder, Muslim and Christian communities around France came together over the weekend to show solidarity by attending each other\u2019s religious services, in churches and mosques alike. But the services in Rouen, and in St.    a nearby suburb where Father Hamel was killed, took on a special resonance. For people in this part of Normandy, the exchange served as a reminder that long before Father Hamel was killed, he and many others from both faiths had worked together to build bonds. In fact, the only mosque in St.    was built on land adjacent to one of the town\u2019s churches after the church sold it for a symbolic price of one euro. The church where the priest was killed is in the city center. In the north of the city, members of the St.  du Madrillet church and the   Yahya Mosque prayed together after the killing. \u201cThis event should help us strengthen the links which already exist between us,\u201d the Rev. Auguste   said on Friday in the mosque, where several Christian worshipers also attended. \u201cAs believers, we must show the example to build bridges between us and not walls, and this could be one of the solutions to fight what is happening right now. \u201d The imam, Abdellatif Hmito, emphasized the special links between the communities. \u201cYou don\u2019t know, you the murderer, the history of this town, who was Father Hamel, and the history of this mosque,\u201d the imam said. \u201cYou mistook the community you attacked, you mistook the city and the target, and I would even say you mistook the country. \u201d St.    was a small countryside village until the 19th century, when several waves of immigration transformed it into a   community of nearly 29, 000 today. Belgians first built a cotton and textile factory. Portuguese and Spanish people came after World War I and brought a strong Catholic community. North African immigrants first arrived in the 1950s, and Kurdish refugees in more recent years. \u201cSt.    has always been a melting pot of nationalities and immigrants,\u201d said Pierre M\u00e9nard, a local historian. It was also one of the poorest cities in France, he noted, and has been a Communist Party stronghold for more than 50 years. The poverty helped forge ties between religious communities. Still, many inhabitants fear the attack\u2019s potential impact on the social connections that have frayed considerably in recent years. In St.    young Muslims are increasingly worried about the radicalization of people they know, the high unemployment rate and a future in which no one is safe. \u201cWe all heard about how crazy Adel Kermiche was, and yet we just never took him seriously,\u201d said Le\u00efla Meterfi, 21, who is of Algerian descent. \u201cWe are so upset of how they so easily become brainwashed. \u201d St\u00e9phane Meterfi, 44, emphasized that instead of being upset, young people needed to act, as he once did. Mr. Meterfi, born and raised in St.    lost one of his brothers at the age of 19 in a fight between rival neighborhood gangs. \u201cIt was in the \u201990s I decided to create an association to help young people to get out of the quartier mentality and the violence,\u201d Mr. Meterfi added, referring to something akin to a street mentality. \u201cThen, when I created my association, the priest of the parish of St.  was the only one who gave us a place for meetings,\u201d he added. \u201cNobody trusted the young petty thugs of the town, except for him. \u201d \u201cThe sisters used to be nurses for our mothers, and they planned every cultural activity in the town,\u201d Mr. Meterfi said, referring to local nuns. Years later, Mr. Meterfi used to gather all of the neighborhood\u2019s Muslim mothers and Abb\u00e9 Pierre, a famous French priest who helped the homeless, for a giant couscous to celebrate interreligious dialogue in St.   . \u201cI can\u2019t believe that 20 years afterwards, a guy would kill the symbolic figure of the people who helped us at the time,\u201d Mr. Meterfi said. Near the red and beige Yahya Mosque, the church of St.  du Madrillet with multicolored windows was welcoming believers on Friday for a prayer. Some were silently crying, others writing down messages in memory of Father Hamel. Sister Marie Wandrille, 71, came to pay a tribute to the man she had worked with for 20 years. \u201cHe was so attached to interreligious dialogue,\u201d she said. \u201cHe and I used to give tutoring classes for children after schools. Muslims and Catholic children used to come to our parish every day. \u201d Near the church, Muslim women and Christian women set up an association to collect clothes for poor people. \u201cThe link between the two communities is very strong here,\u201d Sister Wandrille said. \u201cAt the end of Ramadan, we still celebrate together,\u201d she added, referring to the Muslim holy month. \u201cI am sure that this attack will bring us closer, not the reverse. \u201d In front of the mosque, a group of young men from a Salafist group distributed leaflets condemning the attack, but they refused to speak to reporters. For Mr. Meterfi, it was an example of the two faces of the new generation in St.   . \u201cThey might be doing this peaceful distribution, and at the same time, they would hide their real intentions,\u201d he said. \u201cThe truth is, we don\u2019t really know or control our youth anymore. \u201d According to the local   department, 140 people in the region were considered \u201cradicalized\u201d last year. At St.   \u2019s City Hall, which faces the house of Father Hamel, people have left several messages calling for peace between members of different faiths. Hubert Wulfranc, the mayor, said he still believed that the town would \u201cstand up\u201d in the wake of the murder. \u201cIt must stand up\u201d he added. But he recognized that recent violence might exacerbate tensions. He said he would be vigilant about reports of verbal aggression against Muslims, as well as other cases of \u201cradicalization. \u201d \u201cThere were 2, 000 people gathered in the local stadium on Thursday to pay a tribute to Father Hamel,\u201d Mayor Wulfranc noted. \u201cWe must ask ourselves where the other inhabitants were and why they did not come. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628580.851813}
