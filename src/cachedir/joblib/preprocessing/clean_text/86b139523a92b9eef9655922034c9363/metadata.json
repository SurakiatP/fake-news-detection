They\u2019re made with a lot of tongue, a dash of pig snout and just a little bit of cow brain. Masks of Mr. Trump\u2019s face, topped by tufts of artificial blond hair, are rolling off the lines at a factory in Cuernavaca  \u2014   a recent batch numbered 10, 000. At the town of Otumba\u2019s annual May Day celebration, 40, 000 visitors were treated to a donkey dressed as him. This is Mexico\u2019s return volley in its informal war of words with Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, who fired the opening salvo the day he began his campaign, calling Mexican immigrants \u201crapists. \u201d Where Mr. Trump brought bellicosity, many in Mexico have responded with humor. As the campaign in the United States grinds on, south of the border you can buy Trump pi\u00f1atas, watch the candidate be skewered in a satirical play, throw shoes at him in a video game, or purchase a special version of the classic    game balero, with Mr. Trump as the cup (you can guess where the stick goes). There are too many cartoons to count. D\u00e1maso Morales Ram\u00edrez, a political science professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, said Mr. Trump had helped stir up feelings of Mexican nationalism as \u201cpeople have seized their traditions and popular expressions to defend themselves. \u201d \u201cWhat a Mexican says through caricatures is, many times, what they wouldn\u2019t dare say out loud,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a Mexican way of expressing anger. And expressing something they don\u2019t like. \u201d Mr. Ram\u00edrez pointed to a new word, Trumpear, a play on the Spanish verb trompear, which means \u201cto hit\u201d or \u201cto punch. \u201d The exact definition of the neologism is still being debated. A Mexican reporter suggested on Twitter that it meant \u201cto hit, to vilify, to polarize, to revile, to terrorize as an electoral strategy. \u201d An academic defined it as \u201cthe act and effect of proposing stupid things that are impossible to realize. \u201d A technology businessman wrote that it meant \u201cto do the ridiculous and then contradict yourself afterwards. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628546.1784384}
