The devoted marchers came from over 60 different countries, with the majority marching all the way to Karbala from Iraqi cities such as Najaf and Baghdad. Imam Hussein was martyred in a battle with the army of Yazid, who was promoting a similar type of Islam as ISIS, following a refusal of allegiance to the tyrant caliph. The under reporting of this seemingly peaceful event has been seen by some as a biased act and double standard, considering the sensationalist reporting on terror and Muslims at many other opportunities. This mark of mourning takes place each year, as Sunni Muslims and followers of other religious groups, including Christians, join the journey to mourn the martyrdom of Imam Hussein. Whilst this traditional mourning is usually used to mark the anniversary of the 7th century social justice leader, several people took the seemingly controversial step of taking the march towards a more political stance following the global ISIS terror attacks, in order to denounce all forms of terror, where tens of thousands of Muslims have been killed, since these terrorists began a campaign of terror in June 2014. The yearly occasion has begun to create additional significance in recent years, due to it becoming a rallying cry for the campaign against ISIS terrorists, who have frequently targeted the pilgrims. Due to this, Iraqi troops are deployed to act as added security for these dedicated pilgrims. Whilst terrorist campaign, has not dissuaded pilgrims from around the world from making the journey, the media seemed to turn a blind eye to this peaceful event, which many are seeing as biased reporting.
