Schumer said, \u201cThe bottom line is very simple: the president, if he works with us, particularly on issues like trade and infrastructure, we can work. But on the issues so far, taxes and healthcare, he doesn\u2019t consult us at all. \u201d He added, \u201cHe\u2019s not governing from the middle, he\u2019s governing from the hard right. That\u2019s why his regime has had hardly any major successes, with the exception of Gorsuch. If he changes, we can work together. But he can\u2019t just dictate what he wants. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742563126.226297}
