Kraus of the South Side sponsored the bill with three other members. \\nCouncil last week was prepared to introduce a version of the rules that contained a gag order and fine for members found to be in violation of attorney-client privilege by speaking publicly about private meetings known as executive sessions. Kraus said council tweaked the legislation to censure members found to be in violation of attorney-client privilege for talking publicly about private meetings with city attorneys. The rule does not define attorney-client privilege but keeps the $500 penalty. \\nThe previous version empowered the council president with doling out punishment to members. Kraus said that was changed to require a unanimous vote of council.'"}, "time": 1742562890.1483464}
