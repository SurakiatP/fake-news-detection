With only 23 days left in his   turn as secretary of state, during which he made the search for peace in the Middle East one of his driving missions, Mr. Kerry said the Israeli government was undermining any hope of a   solution to its   conflict with the Palestinians. The American vote last week in the United Nations allowing the condemnation of Israel for settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, he added, was driven by a desire to save Israel from \u201cthe most extreme elements\u201d in its own government. \u201cThe status quo is leading toward one state and perpetual occupation,\u201d Mr. Kerry said, his voice animated. His speech was a powerful admonition after years of tension and frustration, with the Obama administration giving public voice to its   concern that Israel was headed off a cliff toward international isolation and was condemning itself to a future of   perpetual warfare with the Palestinians. Reaction was immediate and harsh, not only from Mr. Netanyahu, but also from Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York.   Donald J. Trump did not even wait for Mr. Kerry to speak before condemning the secretary of state. The United States and Israel are in the middle of a breach rarely seen since President Harry S. Truman recognized the fragile Israeli state in May 1948. In a direct response to Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s barb over the weekend that \u201cfriends don\u2019t take friends to the Security Council\u201d  \u2014   a reference to the Obama administration\u2019s decision to abstain from the resolution condemning the building of new settlements in disputed territory  \u2014   Mr. Kerry said the United States acted out of a deeper understanding of the meaning of its alliance. \u201cSome seem to believe that the U. S. friendship means the U. S. must accept any policy, regardless of our own interests, our own positions, our own words, our own principles  \u2014   even after urging again and again that the policy must change,\u201d he said. \u201cFriends need to tell each other the hard truths, and friendships require mutual respect. \u201d Toward the end of his   speech in the State Department\u2019s auditorium, Mr. Kerry acknowledged that Mr. Trump may well abandon the major principles that the United States has used for decades of Middle East negotiations, including the   solution that both Republicans and Democrats support. Mr. Trump is nominating a new American ambassador, David M. Friedman, who has broken with even the pretense of supporting a   negotiated agreement and has helped fund some of the settlements Mr. Kerry denounced. On vacation in Palm Beach, Fla. Mr. Trump posted two Twitter messages rejecting the speech before it was delivered. \u201cWe cannot continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect,\u201d he wrote on Wednesday morning. After assailing the nuclear deal in Iran and last week\u2019s vote at the Security Council, he said, \u201cStay strong Israel, January 20th is fast approaching!\u201d He was soon praised  \u2014   also on Twitter  \u2014   by Mr. Netanyahu, who later released a video statement that was unsparingly direct and dismissive of Mr. Kerry. \u201cThe entire Middle East is going up in flames, entire countries are toppling, terrorism is raging and for an entire hour the secretary of state attacks the only democracy in the Middle East,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said. \u201cMaybe Kerry did not notice that Israel is the only place in the Middle East where Christmas can be celebrated in peace and security. Sadly, none of this interests the secretary of state. \u201d Mr. Kerry\u2019s speech was criticized at home as well. Mr. McCain called it a \u201cpointless tirade,\u201d while Mr. Schumer, the incoming Senate Democratic leader, said he feared that Mr. Kerry had \u201cemboldened extremists on both sides. \u201d Mr. Kerry did make note of the Palestinian violence, the \u201cextremist agenda\u201d of Hamas, and the Palestinian unwillingness to recognize Israel. All, he said, were at the heart of the conflict. But Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s continued support of settlements, \u201cstrategically placed in locations that make two states impossible,\u201d he said, is driving a solution further and further away. Mr. Kerry argued that Israel, with a growing Arab population, could not survive as both a Jewish state and a democratic state unless it embraced the   approach that a succession of American presidents have endorsed. Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, responded to Mr. Kerry\u2019s speech by calling on Israel to freeze housing construction in order to restart negotiations. \u201cThe minute the Israeli government agrees to cease all settlement activities, including in and around occupied East Jerusalem, and agree to implement the signed agreements on the basis of mutual reciprocity, the Palestinian leadership stands ready to resume permanent status negotiations,\u201d he said. Mr. Netanyahu has said he is willing to meet Mr. Abbas anytime for talks as long as there are no preconditions. It was notable that it was Mr. Kerry who delivered the speech rather than President Obama, who has long kept a distance from Middle East peace negotiations, a pursuit he has always doubted would succeed. After talks at Camp David collapsed in 2000, it was President Bill Clinton himself who gave a speech laying out the parameters of an ultimate deal, about 10 days before leaving office in 2001. At the time, Mr. Clinton also censured Israel for its settlements, but in far more measured terms. Mr. Kerry called them a violation of international law, a position he said the State Department had taken since 1978. \u201cThe Israeli prime minister publicly supports a   solution, but his current coalition is the most   in Israeli history, with an agenda driven by its most extreme elements,\u201d he said. \u201cThe result is that policies of this government  \u2014   which the prime minister himself just described as \u2018more committed to settlements than any in Israel\u2019s history\u2019  \u2014   are leading in the opposite direction, towards one state. \u201d Seldom in modern American diplomacy has an American administration so directly confronted  \u2014   and disavowed  \u2014   a close ally\u2019s actions as Mr. Kerry did on Wednesday, dropping most of the restraint he had shown in public over the past four years. One of the last times was during the Eisenhower administration, when the United States broke with Britain, France and Israel over the 1956 invasion of the Egyptian Sinai. Eisenhower had warned against the invasion and threatened to harm Britain\u2019s financial system in retaliation. When Mr. Kerry got to the principles for a future settlement, they were unsurprising. Many date to the 1990s or earlier, and many to past United Nations resolutions. The principles he described started with a \u201csecure and recognized border between Israel and a viable and contiguous Palestine,\u201d based on Israel\u2019s withdrawal from territory occupied since the 1967 war and land swaps to \u201creflect practical realities on the ground. \u201d A second principle was the creation of a state for the Palestinian people, and a third was a \u201cfair and realistic solution to the Palestinian refugee issue,\u201d including compensation. There was no mention of a \u201cright of return\u201d for refugees and their descendants forced to leave Israel and the Palestinian territories, back to 1948. The fourth principle called for Jerusalem to be the recognized capital of both states, which Mr. Kerry said was \u201cthe most sensitive issue for both sides. \u201d The fifth was an agreement to satisfy Israel\u2019s security needs while ending its military occupation of Palestinian territories. Mr. Kerry, who has cast himself as one of Israel\u2019s greatest friends, said in recent months it became clear he had to \u201csave the   solution while there was still time. \u201d \u201cWe did not take this decision lightly,\u201d he said of the vote in the United Nations Security Council, where the American abstention allowed a    condemnation of Israel go forward. \u201cIsraelis are fully justified in decrying attempts to delegitimize their state and question the right of a Jewish state to exist. But this vote was not about that. It was about actions that Israelis and Palestinians are taking that are increasingly rendering a   solution impossible. \u201d It was also about Mr. Kerry\u2019s own personal disappointment. As soon as he took over from Hillary Clinton as secretary of state in 2013, Mr. Kerry plunged into the tar pit of Middle East peace negotiations with an enthusiasm neither Mrs. Clinton nor Mr. Obama shared. The goal was a   negotiation leading to a \u201cfinal status\u201d of the   conflict by the summer of 2014. It never got that far. Despite scores of meetings between Mr. Kerry and his two main interlocutors, Mr. Abbas, the Palestinian president, and Mr. Netanyahu, Mr. Kerry and his lead mediators, Martin S. Indyk and Frank Lowenstein, could not make progress. They blamed both sides for taking actions that undermined the process, but the continued expansion of the settlements was one of their leading complaints  \u2014   an effort, in the American and European view, to establish \u201cfacts on the ground\u201d so that territory could not be traded away. Mr. Netanyahu has accused the United States of \u201corchestrating\u201d the vote, and his aides have said that Mr. Kerry and Mr. Obama effectively stabbed Israel in the back. Israeli officials have said they have evidence that the United States organized the resolution. Mr. Kerry pushed back at that narrative on Wednesday. Mr. Netanyahu, for his part, is biding his time and waiting for Mr. Kerry and Mr. Obama to move on. Israeli leaders postponed plans on Wednesday to move ahead with new housing in East Jerusalem, just hours before the speech.'"}, "time": 1742561856.7409465}
