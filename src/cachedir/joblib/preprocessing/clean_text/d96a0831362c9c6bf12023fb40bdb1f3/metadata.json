During a visit to the National Museum of   History and Culture, Mr. Trump said he was reminded of the need to combat hatred \u201cin all of its very ugly forms. \u201d He spoke one day after 11 bomb threats were phoned in to Jewish community centers around the country and a Jewish cemetery in University City, Mo. was vandalized. \u201cThe   threats targeting our Jewish community and community centers are horrible, and are painful, and a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil,\u201d Mr. Trump said. The statement came after weeks of private complaints from leaders of major Jewish organizations to members of Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle, including his    Jared Kushner, about the president\u2019s seeming unwillingness to speak out forcefully against   acts. His failure to do so stoked concern among some Jewish leaders that Mr. Trump, whose presidential campaign drew the support of racist and   groups including the Ku Klux Klan, was at best willing to stay silent about such actions and at worst quietly condoning them. Mr. Trump\u2019s comment on Tuesday was a rare concession to the demands of outside forces by a president who prides himself on standing his ground. Despite the questions that arose during his campaign, Mr. Trump has never proactively delivered a statement condemning  . \u201cThe president\u2019s sudden acknowledgment of   is a   on the cancer of   that has infected his own administration,\u201d said Steven Goldstein, the executive director of the Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect. \u201cWhen President Trump responds to   proactively and in real time, and without pleas and pressure, that\u2019s when we\u2019ll be able to say this president has turned a corner. \u201d He added, \u201cThis is not that moment. \u201d The White House was criticized by Jewish groups last month when it issued a statement honoring International Holocaust Remembrance Day that did not mention the six million Jews who perished, instead broadly mentioning \u201cthe depravity and horror inflicted on innocent people by Nazi terror\u201d and \u201cthose who died. \u201d Pressed on the matter, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, defended the statement as \u201cinclusive\u201d of all of those targeted during the Holocaust, including Gypsies, priests and gay people, and he called the criticism \u201cpathetic. \u201d Concern mounted among Jewish leaders after a news conference last week at which Mr. Trump reacted angrily to a question about his response to the increasing number of   acts around the nation. The president called the query insulting and demanded that the questioner, who works for a Jewish publication, sit down. The   League called the president\u2019s reaction \u201c . \u201d Mr. Trump, who was criticized during his campaign for being slow or halfhearted in condemning hate speech, has been particularly stung by accusations that he is   or that he has nurtured the rise of such sentiments. Such accusations have been leveled against both the president and his chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, a former chairman of Breitbart News, a website that has cultivated a white nationalist following. The president\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump, who converted to Judaism to marry Mr. Kushner, an observant Jew, wrote in a Twitter post on Monday: \u201cAmerica is a nation built on the principle of religious tolerance. We must protect our houses of worship  religious centers. #JCC. \u201d JCC is the abbreviation for Jewish community centers. Morton A. Klein, the president of the Zionist Organization of America and a strong supporter of Mr. Trump, said, \u201cOne of the issues here is that President Trump and Steve Bannon are very upset and very frustrated that so many Jewish organizational leaders have accused them of being   which is very unfair and simply inaccurate. \u201d Mr. Klein added, though, that \u201cPresident Trump needed to, himself  \u2014   not through a statement by his daughter that didn\u2019t even mention    \u2014   speak up against this kind of hatred and urge law enforcement to do all they can to find these perpetrators and hold them accountable. \u201d The president\u2019s slow response, he argued, may have been in part because Mr. Trump \u201cwants to make these decisions on his own and not feel like he\u2019s being told what to do. \u201d The proliferation of   acts in the United States and the president\u2019s failure to address them publicly were frequent topics of conversation in Jerusalem over the weekend, where the leaders of American Jewish groups gathered for meetings, according to attendees who described the private discussions on the condition of anonymity. On Tuesday, several organizations issued statements praising Mr. Trump\u2019s comments. \u201cWe appreciate that President Trump spoke directly to this matter,\u201d said Nathan J. Diament, the executive director for public policy at the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America. \u201cThe words of a president of the United States carry great weight, and it is important that Mr. Trump addressed the American Jewish community and all our fellow Americans at this time. \u201d Still, some leaders said they wished Mr. Trump had made a personal call for his administration to find and prosecute perpetrators of the recent   threats. The Simon Wiesenthal Center urged Mr. Trump to present a plan for combating   and called on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to form a task force on the matter. Mark Potok, a senior fellow at the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks   activities, said the wave of threats was \u201creally worrying,\u201d especially because of the \u201ctendency on the part of this administration to completely overlook terrorism and political violence from the domestic radical right. \u201d Mr. Potok also welcomed Mr. Trump\u2019s comments, but he criticized them as tardy. \u201cIt\u2019s very nice that President Trump opposes these crimes,\u201d Mr. Potok said. \u201cIt might have been helpful if he had done so months or even years earlier. \u201d Mr. Spicer complained on Tuesday that Mr. Trump was being treated unfairly. \u201cIt\u2019s ironic that, no matter how many times he talks about this, that it\u2019s never good enough,\u201d he said at a briefing with reporters. He declined to respond to a shouted question about whether Mr. Trump would ask the Justice Department to prosecute those responsible for the   acts. Mr. Trump has mentioned his Jewish grandchildren and daughter when questioned about his commitment to combating  . Yet defenses of Judaism that do not involve fealty to Israel have proved tougher for a man raised in New York, a city heavily populated with Jews. In an interview with Jake Tapper of CNN at the end of February 2016, soon after Mr. Trump won the South Carolina primary, Mr. Trump demurred when pressed repeatedly about the support offered to him by David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know David Duke,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the time. Asked by reporters days later why he would not simply disavow Mr. Duke, Mr. Trump shrugged and said, \u201cI disavow, O. K.?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742563916.1216927}
