California\u2019s bullet train plan is the state\u2019s biggest public works project. If all goes to plan, the $64 billion rail line would whisk passengers between San Francisco and Los Angeles in 2 hours 40 minutes. Other rides would make stops in the Silicon and Central Valleys. But it\u2019s not taking off soon. A segment between San Jose and a station near Bakersfield is expected to begin operating in 2025. The target date for the San   Angeles line isn\u2019t until 2029. (A second phase would extend the lines north to Sacramento and south to San Diego.) As you may have guessed, to pull all of this off is complicated  \u2014   technically, financially and politically. From time to time, California Today readers have written to ask for an update on where things stand. We checked in with Karen E.

A big storm is expected to drench much of the state. Forecasters warned of high winds, surging waterways and the potential for flooding in places throughout the state into Friday. On Thursday, heavy rain was poised to soak the northern half, especially along the coasts and in the Sierra Nevada, where up to five inches of rain could fall, said Brooke Bingaman, a forecaster with the National Weather Service\u2019s Sacramento office. From there, it was expected to spread to Southern California, where officials circulated warnings about the possibility of flash floods and mudflows on slopes stripped bare by wildfires. At the same time, the anticipated rain was seen as more welcome news for the state\u2019s lakes and reservoirs, depleted by five years of drought. Strong rainfall in Northern California over the last few months has helped lift water levels above historical averages at several reservoirs, including Lake Don Pedro, Lake Shasta and Folsom Lake. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some nice rain,\u201d said Doug Carlson, information officer for the California Department of Water Resources. \u201cAnd that\u2019s reflected in some of these reservoirs. \u201d But Mr. Carlson added that the greater concern for drought relief was the level of snowpack in the Sierra Nevada, which plays a vital role in replenishing the reservoirs in the spring and summer. On Wednesday, the statewide snowpack was only 55 percent of the historical average, according to government data. \u201cThat\u2019s a bad sign,\u201d Mr. Carlson said.
