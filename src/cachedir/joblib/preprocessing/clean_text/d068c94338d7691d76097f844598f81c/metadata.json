Somehow, this particular new person generates a reaction within us that sparks our primal instincts beyond the usual associations registered when meeting a new person.   One of the most baffling encounters occurs when meeting a person for the first time and so strongly sensing you\u2019ve known this person before. It\u2019s an uncanny feeling that too often is dismissed as a \u201cpast-life connection\u201d or simply being reminded of another person whom you cannot for the life of you recall. It might be an instant dislike or an affinity, even those \u201clove at first sight\u201d moments. Whatever the case, there\u2019s a short-term overwhelm happening while we\u2019re taking their measure, a subconscious reading. Personally, I\u2019ve always been taken aback by these moments, so much so that it can prevent me from being able to react in expected social dialogue. I\u2019m preoccupied, trying to observe what is it that\u2019s so charging me and why. There\u2019s a kind of knowing, a recognition taking place that\u2019s occurring down in the subconscious \u2014 or possibly through some astral dimension. Is this experience similar to d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu? Cognitive science explains this sensation as a chemical reaction in the brain which floods our senses with a feeling that we\u2019ve lived the moment before. Perhaps something similar is happening upon meeting people who cause this effect? I\u2019m not buying it, however, and here\u2019s why. There have been several times in my life when this sensation occurred, and it was shared mutually with the person whom I had just met. In effect, we\u2019re both having the same feeling that we\u2019ve known each other before, somehow, somewhere. The most vivid example I will share is from a trip to China. I was in a small village in a remote area, walking along a canal with my Chinese hosts. Approaching us was another group, all Chinese, and upon passing each other, this one Chinese gentleman stops and turns; simultaneously, I was doing the exact thing. There we were, facing each other, both of us grinning like school children, with tears forming in our eyes. He spoke no English and I no Mandarin, yet we were both speaking softly to each other. My Chinese guide returned to my side, providing translation: \u201cThis man says he knows you. Ask where have you been?\u201d my guide said. Evolve Your Inbox & Stay Conscious Daily Inspiration and all our best content, straight to your inbox. \u201cI feel like I know him too, somehow,\u201d I replied, \u201cHas he ever been to California?\u201d \u201cNo, he says he\u2019s never been outside of China,\u201d my guide continued, somewhat perplexed and embarrassed by our exchange. \u201cBut I know him,\u201d I protested. \u201cWe, we were friends, good friends, but I cannot remember where or when?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what this fellow just said about you,\u201d my guide lamented, feeling such talk inappropriate. \u201cI know, you didn\u2019t have to translate. I knew what he was saying,\u201d I answered, trying to control my emotions. \u201cThis strange person, he says, he says he misses you,\u201d the guide stated, now officially embarrassed. \u201cI miss you too, my old friend,\u201d I said, staring into the man\u2019s eyes. We exchanged business cards, and he bowed to me, and I to him. We shook hands, and then, much to the horror of my guide, this total stranger and I embraced. Somewhere in a cluttered cubbyhole I still have his card, my long lost friend who has slipped back into the ethers. Yet, what I actually want to speak to is something quite different from my warm Chinese anecdote. This is a vastly more unsettling subject \u2014 encountering someone who does not read as a human being. By that, I mean there\u2019s something so otherly about the person that, at the visceral level, you can\u2019t ignore your reaction. This might not be a common experience for most people, but among my spiritual colleagues, we\u2019ve spoken of this kind of encounter, so it\u2019s not just me. There are myriad theories as to what\u2019s going on here, the prime one being that these are alien beings from various star systems composed as hybrids of animal, fairy, cyborg, or other essences who live within a human form and have agendas that may be beneficial for or malevolent toward the human race. There\u2019s a plethora of literature on such things readily found in metaphysical bookstores, not to mention online. And the subject matter can range from angels and spirit guides to a complex ontological philosophy that incorporates quantum physics. Yet, the common thread to all of this is the perception that we, meaning us humans, are not alone. And this of course opens the question: What is the agenda of these others \u2014 why are they here? This is where the speculation ramps up and the wormholes open. While it can be amusing to think of certain individuals fitting such a description, it\u2019s a serious matter for those who monitor this subject. Movies and books have employed this concept to create various storylines for their plots. I, too, in my books have used this sense that other beings, non-humans, are among us. In Call of the Forbidden Way , an alien threat to colonize our planet is at the core of the drama. But I didn\u2019t come to this idea casually. No, I have always felt an awareness of other beings active on our planet. And I have had my share of encounters with an assortment of folk who, to me, simply didn\u2019t register as authentically human \u2014 some far from it. So, while prevailing logic requires me to present such ideas as fiction, I write with much more than a casual what-if attitude on the subject. Perception, be it accurate or not, is how we experience the world. My own perception seems to register that we\u2019re not alone. \\nThe Sacred Science follows eight people from around the world, with varying physical and psychological illnesses, as they embark on a one-month healing journey into the heart of the Amazon jungle. \\nYou can watch this documentary film FREE for 10 days by clicking here. \\n\"If \u201cSurvivor\u201d was actually real and had stakes worth caring about, it would be what happens here, and \u201cThe Sacred Science\u201d hopefully is merely one in a long line of exciting endeavors from this group.\" - Billy Okeefe, McClatchy Tribune'"}, "time": 1742564409.7278671}
