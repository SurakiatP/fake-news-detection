S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. \u201cHaving a job, I have to look at health care like it is a privilege. \u201d On Sunday night, McCullough sparked a social media firestorm over her answer at the pageant, after she was asked if affordable health care should be considered a right for all Americans. \u201cI\u2019m definitely going to say it\u2019s a privilege,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cAs a government employee, I am granted health care and I see firsthand that for one to have health care, you need to have jobs. \u201d \u201dI\u2019m definitely going to say it\u2019s a privilege.\u201d Listen to your new #MissUSA talk about healthcare in the USA. pic. twitter.   \u2014   Miss USA (@MissUSA) May 15, 2017,  McCullough also clarified her thoughts on feminism, after saying Sunday that she doesn\u2019t want to be called a feminist and prefers the term \u201cequalism. \u201d \u201cFor me, where I work at with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, \u2018equalism\u2019 is more of a term of understanding that no matter your gender, you are still just kind of given the same accolades on your work,\u201d McCullough said Tuesday. \u201cI believe that if a person does a good job, they should be, you know, credited for that in a sense. \u201d She added, \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to look at it as if I\u2019m not all about women\u2019s rights, because I am. We deserve a lot when it comes to opportunity in the workplace as well as just like leadership positions. I\u2019ve seen and witnessed firsthand the impact that women have. \u201d WATCH: @MissUSA 2017 K\u00e1ra McCullough speaks out following her victory the other night and social response: https:  .  pic. twitter.   \u2014   Good Morning America (@GMA) May 16, 2017,  McCullough said she was \u201cnot at all\u201d surprised by the backlash she faced for her original comments. \u201cI believe that is what America is based on, like having opinions and views,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I would like to just take this moment to truly just clarify   \u2026     what I said. \u201d   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson'"}, "time": 1742628475.3479507}
