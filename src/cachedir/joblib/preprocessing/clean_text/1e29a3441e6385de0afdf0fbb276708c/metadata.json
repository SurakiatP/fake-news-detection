Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) for leadership of the House Democrats, Rep. Tim Ryan (D-OH) used an old quotation, saying that the definition of insanity is to do the \u201csame thing over and over again and keep getting the same results.\u201d He meant that the Democrats keep losing seats with the same leaders and the same message. But the famous quote also applies to the liberal media, who use the same talking heads to make the same points over and over again, even after they were humiliated by Donald J. Trump on Election Day. \\nInterviewing former Utah Governor Mike Leavitt (R) on Monday on MSNBC, Kristen Welker of NBC News demonstrated how the bias works on a day-to-day basis. She contrasted the \u201cimpassioned\u201d partisan plea from the cast of the Broadway show \u201c Hamilton \u201d to Vice President-elect Mike Pence with the president-elect\u2019s \u201cTwitter storm\u201d in response. She wondered if Trump\u2019s tweets were presidential, but did not question if it was appropriate for the \u201cHamilton\u201d cast to use their production for political purposes. Leavitt gave a diplomatic answer, saying Twitter was a new way for a president to communicate. \\nIt is also a very effective way. The media know it and don\u2019t like it. In just a few words, Trump can effectively expose liberal bias. He called the show \u201coverrated\u201d and said the crew had harassed Pence, adding, \u201cThe cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!\u201d \\nOn CNN, anchor Chris Cuomo was troubled by Trump\u2019s use of Twitter in response to the \u201cHamilton\u201d controversy. His former campaign manager Kellyanne Conway replied , \u201cWhy do you care?\u201d \\nIt\u2019s a good question, and she knows the answer. She noted that Trump is \u201cjust trying to cut through the nonsense\u201d of what the media and other opponents of Trump want people to believe. \\nTrump beat the media, as well as the Democrats, on Election Day. Of course, the emails from WikiLeaks demonstrated that they are one and the same. \\nIn this context, Politico is emerging as one of the most dishonest publications in the Trump era. A Politico story by Kelsey Hutton about media collusion with the Clinton campaign said , \u201cmost of the correspondences revealed by WikiLeaks consisted of reporters asking for comment, setting up in-person meetings and trying to get information from sources, which is a reporter\u2019s job.\u201d \\nAIM\u2019s Spencer Irvine noted that the WikiLeaks e-mails exposed how the liberal media establishment \u201chas worked almost hand-in-hand with the Hillary Clinton campaign.\u201d He cited ten examples, including: Politico reporter Glenn Thrush admitted to being a \u201chack,\u201d writing to her campaign chairman John Podesta, \u201cBecause I have become a hack I will send u the whole section\u201d of a story he was writing. \\nA \u201chack\u201d is usually defined as a person who is supposed to be a professional but does mediocre work. \\nAnother Thrush email to Podesta about an Obama White House story said, \u201cyou are in the thing\u2026in a good way\u2026but could really use your insights\u2026sorry to be a pain in the ass.\u201d This is not asking for comment. It constitutes flattery, in the context of assuring him that he\u2019s already covered \u201cin a good way\u201d and begging for more quotes. \\nThe Clinton campaign got an article from Politico in advance of publication that contained some mild criticism of Hillary. The article was provided in advance so the Clinton campaign could formulate a response. \\nPolitico has a media reporter, Jack Shafer, who tried to rationalize much of the collusion in a story that carried the headlines, \u201cWikiLeaks and the Oily Washington Press. A bunch of reporters got caught up in the Podesta flypaper. How bad is it, really?\u201d The final headline suggested it was much ado about nothing. \\nHe admitted that Politico reporter Glenn Thrush sent Podesta \u201ca chunk of his story-in-progress,\u201d but that he was among many reporters who \u201cappear to have conned their way into the inner sanctums to produce creditable work that is accurate and useful to readers.\u201d He added, \u201cWhat appear to be compromises ultimately redound to their favor.\u201d \\nIn other words, Thrush was acting like a sycophant just to get information. Is this what modern journalism has become? What happened to speaking truth to power? \\nShafer said, \u201cIn my own journalism, this isn\u2019t how I work: I don\u2019t give my sources a sneak preview of what I\u2019m writing\u2014unless the topic is technical and complicated (law, medicine, science, tech, et al.) and demands an expert\u2019s checkmark.\u201d \\nNevertheless, there has been no apology from Politico senior management over Thrush\u2019s pathetically subservient coverage of the Democrats. They will just move on, doing the same thing over and over again, hoping that we will all forget what they have done. \\nWe won\u2019t.
