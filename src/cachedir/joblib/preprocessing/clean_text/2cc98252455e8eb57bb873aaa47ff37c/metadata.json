It\u2019s an amazingly cheeky statement, as if he was taunting the people who crucified him, and giving them the proverbial middle finger\u201d. \\nExperts were left shocked to find the inscription was still intact following almost 1,600 years of being covered by marble cladding. \\n\u201cWe spotted the Jesus graffiti immediately after we removed the top layer of marble and dusted it off,\u201d added Mouzakis, \u201cHis writing is very neat, as you would expect from the son of God. Hopefully this will put any doubts about the origin of the tomb to bed\u201d. \\nJesus Christ was crucified nearly 2,000 years ago on the Hill of Calvary after claiming he was the king of the Jews. It is understood he then came back to life three days later in the tomb, wrote Jesus woz ere, spent a few days freaking out his apostles, before then levitating into the sky, through the earth\u2019s atmosphere and back to his dad\u2019s place in heaven.'"}, "time": 1742564450.8766565}
