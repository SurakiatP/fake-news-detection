Prime Minister Theresa May made a statement outside of 10 Downing Street following chairing the meeting of COBRA: Referencing the Westminster terror attack and Manchester attack, Ms. May said: \u201cIn terms of planning and execution, the recent attacks are not connected. But we believe we are experiencing a new trend in the threats we face as terrorism breeds terrorism and perpetrators are inspired to attack not only on the basis of carefully constructed plots after years of planning and training and not even of attackers radicalising online, but copying one another. \u201d \u201cWe cannot and must not pretend that things can continue as they are. Things need to change and need to change in four important ways\u201d: 1) Ms. May stated that the attacks are bound together by \u201cthe single ideology of Islamist extremism\u201d which she called \u201ca perversion of Islam\u201d. \u201cDefeating this ideology is the greatest challenge of our time. But we cannot defeat it through military intervention alone\u201d or permanent defensive counterterrorism operations. She said it will only be defeated when \u201cpeople\u2019s minds are turned away\u201d from Islamism and they are \u201cmade to understand that our values  \u2026    are superior to anything offered by the preachers of  and supporters of hate\u201d. 2) \u201cSafe spaces\u201d where this ideology is allowed to breed online must be tackled, she said, saying that they need to work with foreign governments to reach \u201cinternational agreements that regulate cyberspace to prevent the spread of extremism and terrorism planning\u201d. 3) The prime minister also targeted \u201csafe spaces that exist in the real world\u201d. \u201cYes that means military action to destroy ISIS in Iraq and Syria, but that also means taking action here at home\u201d \u201cYes that means military action to destroy ISIS in Iraq and Syria, but that also means taking action here at home. \u201d \u201cThere is, to be frank, too much tolerance of extremism in the country. So we need to become far more robust in identifying it and stamping it out across the public sector and across society. \u201cThat will require often embarrassing and difficult conversations. But the whole of our country needs to come together to take on this extremism and we need to live our lives not as a series of separted, segregated communities but as one truly United Kingdom. \u201d 4) Robust counter terrorism strategy: \u201cAs the nature of the threat become more complex, fragmented, and hidden, especially online, the strategy needs to keep up. so in light of what we are learning about the changing threat we need to review Britain\u2019s counter terrorism strategy to make sure police and secruity services have all the power they need. And if we need to increase the length of custodial sentences for   ofences, even apparently less serious offences, that is what we will do. \u201d \u201cIt is time to say enough is enough. Everbody must go about their lives as they normally would. \u201d The prime minister stated that the Conservative and other parties will suspend campaigning for Sunday, but the election will go ahead as planned on Thursday.
