[\u201cI say to all Dutch people at home, when you go to vote on Wednesday, if you want to put our country up for sale and ensure that our money goes to asylum seekers, Brussels and Africa instead of our own people, vote for the VVD\u201d  \u2014   the political party which Rutte heads.  Wilders also called on Rutte to expel Turkey\u2019s ambassador, after the country\u2019s authoritarian president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan denigrated the Dutch as \u201cNazi remnants\u201d and threatened the Netherlands with \u201charsh retaliation\u201d for preventing Turkish government ministers from staging a political rally in Rotterdam. Wilders said anything less would be \u201can insult to us and our police officers\u201d after Turkish migrants and dual nationals rioted in support of their native country\u2019s Islamist president. But Rutte ruled the measure out. \u201cIt\u2019s the difference between tweeting from the sofa and running a country,\u201d he said, in reference to the robust message to Turkish rioters which Wilders broadcasted in the wake of the unrest. \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddf1\ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\uddf7 Geert Wilders\u2019s message to Turks: \u201dYou are not welcome here!\u201d    #Turkey #Rotterdam pic. twitter.   \u2014   Keith Walker (@KeithWalkerNews) March 12, 2017,  \u201cYou are no Europeans, and you will never be,\u201d he said. \u201cAn Islamic state like Turkey does not belong to Europe. All the values Europe stands for  \u2014   freedom, democracy, human rights  \u2014   are incompatible with Islam. \u201cTurkey voted for Erdo\u011fan, a dangerous Islamist who raises the flag of Islam. We do not want more, but less Islam. So Turkey, stay away from us. You are not welcome here. \u201d Rutte cited a desire to avoid escalating the dispute with Turkey as his reason for failing to act  \u2014   although the Turks have already effectively expelled the Dutch ambassador from their own capital. BREAKING: Turkey says Dutch ambassador can\u2019t return, will advise parliament to withdraw from   friendship group.  \u2014   The Associated Press (@AP) March 13, 2017,  The VVD leader ruled out any sort of coalition agreement with Wilders\u2019s party, which is on course to come first in the upcoming election, casting up comments Wilders made about Moroccan criminals which resulted in controversial hate speech charges. \u201cSince then you have radicalised still further by saying the mosques will close and you will remove Qur\u2019ans from people\u2019s homes,\u201d Rutte claimed. \u201cI will not work with a politician like that, either in government or with a supporting deal. Not ever, ever. \u201d Wilders did, in fact, rise in the opinion polls after the courts convicted him for his remarks.'"}, "time": 1742561722.6294365}
