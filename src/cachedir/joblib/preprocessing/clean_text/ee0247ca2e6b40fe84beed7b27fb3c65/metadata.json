But as Republicans head to Cleveland to nominate Donald J. Trump in two weeks, a convention city chosen with Battleground Ohio much in mind, a vortex of headwinds are rising against Mr. Trump in the state. The barely concealed disdain of Gov. John R. Kasich, a former rival who has not endorsed the presumptive nominee, echoes through the state\u2019s Republican leadership, whose full engagement in the fall campaign will be needed to turn out voters. Images of disunity in Cleveland, where delegates are gathering July   in the shadow of local polls showing a majority of Republicans prefer a different nominee, could make it harder for the party to attract   activists for the fall campaign. Mr. Trump ignored Ohio for six weeks after clinching the nomination, until a visit last week to coal country, where he spoke to an audience of largely white   voters, including some Democrats. It was the group he has performed best with in primaries and polls. But in describing a trade deal during the same visit as a \u201crape of our country,\u201d his oratory and protectionist policies are turning off other   voters, including suburban women and business interests, in a state whose economy depends on global exports. \u201cIf you look at the primary and extrapolate, Trump could get   of the white working class,\u201d said John C. Green, a political scientist at the University of Akron. That would improve on Mitt Romney\u2019s share of these voters in Ohio in 2012, when the state slipped from his grasp by only 103, 000 votes. \u201cThe flip side is Trump\u2019s appeal to white   men very well may cost him other kinds of Republican voters,\u201d Mr. Green said. Public polling of Ohio, which has been scant, shows Hillary Clinton with an average lead of about three percentage points. Mrs. Clinton and her supporters are already spending heavily in the state on ads to define Mr. Trump negatively, and last week Mrs. Clinton visited Cincinnati with Senator Elizabeth Warren, who electrified the crowd by mocking Mr. Trump for running a campaign no deeper than the slogans on his \u201cgoofy\u201d hats. A recent Quinnipiac Poll of Ohio, showing the race deadlocked, indicated women were moving toward Mrs. Clinton while Mr. Trump\u2019s strength among men was unchanged. Bob Seszko, a school bus mechanic from rural Bellaire, Ohio, said he voted for Senator Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary but planned to vote for Mr. Trump in November. In the 1980s, he had made good money at a steel plant in the Ohio River Valley  \u2014   until it closed. \u201cOverseas was selling it cheaper than we could make it, so I lost my job,\u201d he said. \u201cI think Trump\u2019s more sincere than Hillary is. She\u2019s riding on the coattails of her husband. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s appeal to such voters is likely to be strong, especially in the industrial region around Youngstown and Akron. That he has kept the race tight even after weeks of negative news  \u2014   about his visit to Scotland, his firing of his campaign manager and his congratulating himself after the nightclub shooting in Orlando, Fla.  \u2014   is a testament to the strength of Mr. Trump\u2019s appeal with his base, as well as the polarization of the electorate. To counter the threat, Mrs. Clinton and her supporters began a barrage of   television ads in Ohio and other swing states in May, and for the Fourth of July weekend, they planned a $13 million blitz mostly in Ohio and Florida. Mr. Trump, who is skeptical of TV ads and short on campaign cash, has not bought any general election ads in the state. The first ad supporting him from an outside group, the National Rifle Association, featuring a survivor of the terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya, was just rolled out. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten to the point where I feel so much of this is on the Trump campaign,\u201d said Matt Borges, chairman of the Ohio Republican Party. He said Mr. Trump recently called him after reading that Mrs. Clinton was far ahead in hiring field staff members in Ohio. In March, Mr. Borges and other Republican leaders in the state bluntly warned that if Mr. Trump were the nominee, he could not carry their perennially   state. \u201cWe want to distance ourselves from the kind of rhetoric that Donald Trump is using to divide Americans,\u201d Mr. Borges said at the time. \u201cIf Donald Trump is unfortunately our choice and our nominee, it could imperil not only the race for the White House but many other candidates  . \u201d The state\u2019s Republican leaders, who supported their native son Mr. Kasich before his withdrawal from the race, no longer openly scorn Mr. Trump. But they pick their words carefully, withholding full support. \u201cA great many people in Ohio are watching Mr. Trump closely to see if over the weeks and months he will emerge as an individual of presidential stature,\u201d said Brad Sinnott, chairman of the Republican Central Committee of Franklin County, which includes Columbus, the capital. \u201cThere is some work to be done. \u201d Mr. Trump, who has signaled a strategy of outsourcing   organizing to the national party, hired a state director only late last month. The Republican National Committee, which promised last year to hire more than 200 field staff members in the state, has about 50 now, and has yet to open its first Ohio office. The Clinton campaign, which declined to say how many staff members it has in Ohio, is also coordinating with state and national Democrats, who collectively have more than 100 people in the field, said Kirstin Alvanitakis, a state party spokeswoman. The Clinton campaign plans to open offices across the state in the coming weeks. Mr. Trump\u2019s appeal helped drive record turnout in the primary in March. \u201cI told him we had a million new Republicans,\u201d Mr. Borges recalled of a conversation he had with Mr. Trump. \u201cHe asked, \u2018Is that because of me? \u2019\u201d \u201cI told him yes,\u201d he said. What he did not say is that many Republican primary voters came out to vote against Mr. Trump, who received nearly 36 percent of the vote in the contest, which Mr. Kasich won. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a   movement without Trump,\u201d Mr. Borges said.'"}, "time": 1742562923.781585}
