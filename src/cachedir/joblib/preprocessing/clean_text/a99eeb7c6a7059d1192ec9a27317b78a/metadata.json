Trump has been saying recently about black people: That their neighborhoods were \u201cwar zones. \u201d That they struggle to get by on food stamps. That they see nothing but failure around them. Mr. Williams, 61, a retired postal employee who is   acknowledged that Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks described a reality for some black people. But it was not his reality, or that of people he knew. And the fact that those generalizations, in which all   inhabit a hell of violence and dysfunction, came as part of an outreach effort on Mr. Trump\u2019s part elicited from Mr. Williams an incredulous and slightly bitter cascade of chuckles. \u201cWho\u2019s he talking about?\u201d Mr. Williams said Wednesday over lunch at Ponce City Market, an upscale development with a hip food court that draws an ethnically and racially mixed crowd. \u201cI don\u2019t know  \u2014   most of the black people I know are educated and live in nice neighborhoods. Everybody in my family is required to have a degree. \u201d Dogged by suggestions that he has been running a racist campaign, Mr. Trump has been expressing concern for   more in the past week than at any other point in his presidential run and making a direct appeal for their votes. \u201cWhat do you have to lose?\u201d he has asked. But the unrelievedly dire picture he has painted of black America has left many black voters angry, dumbfounded or both. Interviews with roughly a dozen blacks here turned up no one who found any appeal in Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks. More common was the suggestion that Mr. Trump was trying to appeal to whites who might support him. \u201cI hear him not talking to black people, but talking to white people about black people so they will think he cares about black people,\u201d said Alexis Scott, a former publisher of The Atlanta Daily World, a   newspaper. \u201cThe real thing that he\u2019s trying to do is to try to protect some of the white vote by suggesting to them that he cares. \u201d Speaking invariably to almost   audiences, Mr. Trump has portrayed blacks as living lives of utter desperation. \u201cWhat do you have to lose by trying something new, like Trump?\u201d he asked a crowd in Virginia on Saturday. \u201cYou\u2019re living in your poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58 percent of your youth is unemployed  \u2014   what the hell do you have to lose?\u201d Marc Morial, the president of the National Urban League, said that black Americans faced challenges, but that Mr. Trump\u2019s depiction of a hopeless, violent black America did not match reality. \u201cIt\u2019s an inaccurate portrayal of the community that seeks to define the community by only its biggest challenges,\u201d Mr. Morial said. \u201cBlack America has deep problems  \u2014   deep economic problems  \u2014   but black America also has a large community of striving, successful,   people: college educated, in the work force. \u201d Poverty is far more prevalent in black households than the general population, but the vast majority of   do not live in poverty. According to census data released last year, 26 percent of blacks live in poverty, compared with 15 percent of the country as a whole. Only about one out of every four households receiving food stamps in 2014 was black, according to the United States Department of Agriculture. One area where blacks lag severely is homeownership. Rates of homeownership for blacks have dipped over the past four years to 41. 7 percent in the second quarter of this year, the lowest rate among any racial group, according to the Census Bureau. The unemployment rate for blacks is nearly double the national average. Mr. Trump\u2019s tone and strategy in courting the black vote is distinctly different from that of previous Republican presidential nominees, whose more formal outreach efforts had limited success. In 2004, for instance, President George W. Bush addressed the National Urban League, and in 2012, Mitt Romney appeared before the N. A. A. C. P. \u201cSomeone like George W. Bush, to his credit, actually went to black audiences with people who had real connections to black communities,\u201d said Matthew B. Platt, a political scientist at historically black Morehouse College. \u201cHe actually made those kinds of connections to then filter down to regular black people. Trump is not doing anything of that sort. \u201d But he noted that Mr. Trump\u2019s basic presentation to black voters was perhaps not altogether different from the one he has made to white voters. \u201cIt seems to me that Trump\u2019s argument is this: \u2018Your life sucks. Try something new. I\u2019m something new,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the argument he\u2019s making to black voters and, more broadly, that\u2019s the entire Trump campaign. \u201d Mr. Trump would seem to have nowhere to go but up among   voters. A recent NBC   Street Journal poll found Hillary Clinton with a 91 to 1 percent advantage over Mr. Trump among blacks. Many say Mr. Trump\u2019s role in leading the   birther movement that questioned President Obama\u2019s birthplace doomed his chances with   voters. \u201cSocial media and YouTube have a record of what he\u2019s said in the last year, much less the last five or six years,\u201d said Andra Gillespie, an Emory University political scientist, who is black. \u201cYou can\u2019t just make one speech, have a good week and then all of a sudden think people are going to forget everything you\u2019ve done. \u201d Some black conservatives, however, defended Mr. Trump. Wayne Dupree, a radio host, posted a live video to Periscope, an app that allows users to   video, saying that Mrs. Clinton had been tricking black people for years. He urged blacks to look at the conditions they were living under. \u201cLook to the left, look to the right and look in front of you and tell me if things haven\u2019t changed,\u201d he said. \u201cThen why do you keep voting for the Democratic Party? Why do you keep voting for the same side?\u201d He urged blacks to help get Mr. Trump \u201celected so that we can change America. \u201d\u2019 \u201cAmerica needs to go a different route,\u201d Mr. Dupree said. The Trump campaign rejected criticism with a statement from Lynne Patton, a black woman who is an assistant to the Trump family, accusing Democrats of treating black voters as a \u201cmonolith. \u201d In Atlanta on Wednesday, Nate Cohen, 35, a health care information technology worker, was among the   unimpressed by Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts. Mr. Cohen\u2019s most generous interpretation was that perhaps Mr. Trump had not done his homework. Perhaps he needed to hit the streets and see the variety of the black experience. \u201cI don\u2019t recall ever seeing him going out into those hedges and highways,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just go on what you see on TV. \u201d Certainly, he said, some live in dire poverty. Mr. Cohen\u2019s side job is as a motivational speaker, work that takes him to troubled neighborhoods. But he said blacks and Latinos were not the only people living in such conditions. He said he had tried to give Mr. Trump a fair hearing, but had been turned off to him long ago. Mr. Trump, he said, will say \u201cwarped\u201d things  \u2014   like proposing to bar Muslims from entering the country or deporting all illegal immigrants  \u2014   and then say things to \u201cpatch it up. \u201d He wondered whether Mr. Trump was appealing to whites, reinforcing stereotypes about blacks. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be mindful of who you affect, and who you infect,\u201d he said, adding that Mr. Trump might be \u201cinfecting\u201d his white audience with racist ideas. Or as Ms. Scott put it: \u201cHe is giving voice to every stereotype he\u2019s ever heard. I heard someone say, \u2018It\u2019s like he only watches \u201cThe Wire,\u201d and that\u2019s what he knows about black people. \u2019\u201d At Six Feet Under, a seafood restaurant popular among blacks and whites, Anthony Simpson, 55, said he had heard Mr. Trump\u2019s comments, but paid them little mind. He said he had long dismissed Mr. Trump as \u201ca joke. \u201d Mr. Simpson, who owns a demolition business, said he was not surprised that Mr. Trump had offended many black people, after the things he had said about Muslims and Latinos. \u201cHe eventually was going to get around to it,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742561798.3207848}
