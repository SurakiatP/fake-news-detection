Trends US Elections 2016 \\nPolitical consultant Jesse Benton is once again in hot water. After journalists from The Telegraph introduced themselves to the former Senator Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) aide as lawyers representing a potential Trump donor who was also a Chinese national, Benton proceeded to not only tell them how to donate to Trump\u2019s campaign despite it being against federal election law, but also discussed attempts to suppress votes in Cleveland, Ohio. \\nThis isn\u2019t Benton\u2019s first time engaging in politically and legally questionable behavior. In May, he had to take a step back from his role at the Great America PAC after pleading guilty to buying an endorsement for presidential candidate Ron Paul in 2012, during his time as campaign manager. Benton was sentenced to two years of probation.

When they met with Benton, he discussed the Trump campaign\u2019s plans in the swing state of Ohio. Referring to Hillary Clinton\u2019s support in Ohio, he said: \u201c In Cleveland, if we can...turn her to regular turnout levels, she's gonna lose about 60,000 votes in that area \u2013 that's a dead heat. \u201d \\n\u201c So we have a voter suppression campaign quite frankly, targeting African-Americans, and sort of suburban moms, just bad stuff about Hillary, just trying to take their taste for her away, \u201d he explained. \\nWhen it came to the issue of how the Trump campaign would be able to accept money from a Chinese national without arousing suspicion, Benton explained that he would channel the cash through a dark money tunnel. \\nSuper PACs make use of non-profit organizations to collect money from donors because 501(c)4 nonprofit groups are allowed to donate funds to political campaigns without disclosing who their donors are. Benton said he could accept the offered $2 million contribution from the non-existent Chinese donor by having the money sent to his company, which would then pass it on to one or two more non-profits.

Dan Backer, a lawyer for Great America, told The New York Times that \u201c I think it\u2019s pretty clear that someone who used to work for the organization decided to leverage that former relationship for his own purposes. \u201d \\nBacker suggested that Benton had exaggerated his role in the PAC, telling The Telegraph that Benton was engaging in \u201c puffery and self-promotion. \u201d \\nBenton has denied any wrongdoing, claiming that the reporters were brought to him as a \u201c business referral \u201d from Beach and that the clip was actually a part of a \u201c public affairs contract, \u201d The Telegraph reported. \\nThe Trump campaign claims to have severed ties with the PAC, releasing a statement saying it \u201c publicly disavowed this group back in April. This is public via Federal Election Commission filings. \u201d \\nHowever, it was just a month ago that Trump\u2019s son Eric and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani spoke at a Great America PAC fundraiser, Raw Story reported .\""}, "time": 1742628586.468105}
