I have also spoken with Prime Minister (Justin) Trudeau who outlined Canada\u2019s generous immigration policy for wealthy individuals, so we\u2019ll see.\u201d \\nThe story was immediately picked up by American newsrooms, who ran it with headlines like \u201cObama Just Said He\u2019s Moving If Trump Is Elected, Sounds Good To Us!\u201d \\nWhen asked about the rumors, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest would not say outright that Obama is not considering a move to Canada should the American people elect Trump. \\n\u201cHe\u2019s working very hard to make sure that nobody has to leave the country as a result of an electoral outcome that the president doesn\u2019t support,\u201d said Earnest, according to MRC Blog . \\nWhile this all originated as a rumor, the White House\u2019s decision not to categorically deny the reports had any validity only makes it appear as though Obama may actually consider moving out of the country if Trump is elected. \\nDo you think Obama would ever leave the US?
