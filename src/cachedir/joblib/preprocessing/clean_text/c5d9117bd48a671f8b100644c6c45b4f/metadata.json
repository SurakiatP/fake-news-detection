Lamar Smith ( ) spoke with Breitbart News\u2019 Washington Political Editor Matt Boyle on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 on Saturday about the media bias that\u2019s reached unprecedented levels since President Donald Trump was elected and poses a risk to the democracy it is tasked to protect. [\u201cI think the media bias today is a threat to our democracy for this reason,\u201d said Smith, who is the chairman of the House Media Fairness Caucus. \u201cIf the American people don\u2019t get the facts then they can\u2019t make good decisions.  \u201cAnd if the American people can\u2019t make good decisions because they\u2019re not getting the facts then I think that is a threat to democracy,\u201d Smith said. Smith said the \u201c  mainstream media\u201d is not only replacing facts with opinion but \u201cinvective and venomous opinions\u201d when it comes to reporting on Trump. During the interview, Smith cited a number of polls that show clear media bias, including a   poll conducted in May that shows the majority of Americans  \u2014   or 65 percent  \u2014   believe the media publishes \u201cfake news. \u201d Smith also said that the media has an \u201cincredible responsibility\u201d to provide accurate news and that the \u201cconstant barrage of personal attacks\u201d on the president and Republicans can contribute to individuals acting irrationally as was the case this past week when a shooter opened fire on GOP lawmakers and staff at a baseball practice in Alexandria, VA. The gunman,    James T. Hodgkinson of Illinois who supported Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign and posted   messages on social media, died from his injuries after Capitol Police on security detail for House Majority Whip Steve Scalise ( ) engaged him in a gun battle. Scalise remains in critical condition following multiple surgeries for his injuries. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen before in my 35 years of involvement in politics, and quite frankly this amount of venom contributes to  \u2014   I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s the only reason  \u2014   but it does contribute to an environment of hatred and violence and we shouldn\u2019t be surprised I think if it does have an impact,\u201d Smith said. Smith also said that the media clearly did not expect Trump to win the presidency and that it was a \u201cshock to their system. \u201d \u201cBut that\u2019s still no excuse for the amount of bias we\u2019re seeing,\u201d Smith said. When Boyle asked Smith what Americans should do to fight media bias, he said people should speak out. \u201cThe most important thing that we can do to counter the media\u2019s bias, quite frankly, is to speak out against it,\u201d Smith said, adding that he is not advocating censorship but encouraging people to write to their representatives in Congress and to write letters to the editors of their local newspaper. \u201cThe mistake we make overall is letting the media tell us what to think,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got make sure that we warn the American people to not let the liberal media tell them what to think. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562124.0004928}
