The words were more urgent, as Senators debated a compromise offered by a Republican. But by day\u2019s end on Thursday, Congress was in the same place: a fierce stalemate over the nation\u2019s gun laws, even with the additional pressure from the mass shooting in Orlando, Fla. In the Senate, a bipartisan proposal drafted by Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, won a majority of 52 votes in support  \u2014   including the backing of seven other Republicans and 44 Democrats. But the measure fell short of the 60 votes needed to overcome procedural obstacles and was set aside, with no chance of passage soon. \u201cEventually we\u2019ll find a compromise because the need is too real,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who supported the Collins measure. But Mr. Graham said that another terrorist attack might have to occur before Congress was spurred to action or, he said, lawmakers might need to get an earful from their constituents. \u201cThe only way this movie ends is for people to calm down, go home, chill out and get beat up a little bit,\u201d Mr. Graham said. \u201cI am going to get beat up a little bit. I am going to get praised a little bit. And then we\u2019ll come back and realize we have to do something about this. \u201d The measure proposed by Ms. Collins would block gun sales to terror suspects on the government\u2019s   list or on the   selectee list of individuals who are subjected to heightened screening before they are allowed to board a plane. It was far more narrow than proposals broadly favored by Democrats that focused on the much larger terror screening database, but it also put a far lighter burden on law enforcement officials seeking to block a gun sale than a measure put forward by Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the chamber\u2019s No. 2 Republican. Ms. Collins said she was encouraged by the outcome. \u201cI am very pleased with the strong vote that we received today,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign that the Senate is serious about passing   provisions. \u201d Others were less optimistic. \u201cIt is absolutely not dead,\u201d said Senator Heidi Heitkamp, Democrat of North Dakota, who was a main partner with Ms. Collins in drafting the proposal and selling it to Democrats. But asked if the measure was still alive, Ms. Heitkamp seemed less certain. \u201cWell, we\u2019ll see,\u201d she said. In the House, Democrats on Thursday ended their      \u2014   a protest Speaker Paul D. Ryan called a   stunt that undermined the basic institutions of government. \u201cOne of the things that makes our country strong is our institutions,\u201d Mr. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, said at a news conference as Democrats continued to lay siege to the House chamber. \u201cNo matter how bad things get in this country, we have a basic structure that ensures a functioning democracy. We can disagree on policy, but we do so within the bounds of order and respect for the system. Otherwise, it all falls apart. \u201d Mr. Ryan said he was \u201cnot going to allow stunts like this to stop us from carrying out the people\u2019s business. \u201d He added, \u201cThis is about a publicity stunt and now a   scheme. \u201d But Democrats countered that they had effectively drawn attention to the gun issue and created momentum that would ultimately lead to legislation. \u201cThe American people are with us, and people around the world are with us,\u201d Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia and one of the leaders of the protest, said. Indeed, Democrats had amassed a large audience by using social media, primarily Twitter\u2019s Periscope   feature, to broadcast their   after the official television coverage of proceedings ceased because the House was not formally in session. It was a strategy that was at once effective in gaining an audience while also being an affront to House rules. But on legislative business, Mr. Ryan prevailed. He reclaimed control of the House, pounding his gavel and muscling through a major appropriations bill that included funding for combating the Zika virus. He and the Republicans, who hold the majority, then declared the House adjourned with no votes until after the Fourth of July holiday. Democrats still gave speeches all through the night. And they said they would continue to press their case throughout the recess for votes to tighten the nation\u2019s gun control laws. \u201cWe will not rest,\u201d the Democratic leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, said in a speech that began at 7 a. m. With barely a dozen colleagues gathered around her, looking like bedraggled travelers who had spent the night in a bus station, Ms. Pelosi politely rebuffed an officer who asked if Democrats might clear the chamber for a daily security sweep. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be able to do that,\u201d she replied. By pushing through the appropriations bill on a largely   vote without any debate, Mr. Ryan had to abandon his commitment to regular order in the House. It was a step that he said he had taken with absolutely no remorse, given the Democrats\u2019 efforts at obstruction. \u201cNot in the least,\u201d Mr. Ryan said when asked if he had backed away from his promise to maintain order. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve learned is that Democrats are not interested in advancing the process. They are interested in stopping the process. Our members want Congress to function. \u201d He added: \u201cWhen the Democrats are trying to stop Congress from doing anything, that is not an open process. That is a no process. That is a halting process. \u201d In fact, Democrats had expressly sought an opportunity to debate the bill before Mr. Ryan pushed it through. Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts, voiced surprise that Mr. Ryan had not offered the usual equal time for debate. \u201cI don\u2019t see any time for debate, which kind of surprises me,\u201d Mr. McGovern said. \u201cWe\u2019re locked out of everything,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThis is a lousy process, Mr. Speaker. \u201d The appropriations measure including the money for Zika is almost certain to fail in the Senate. Democrats said the bill had been loaded with provisions they would never accept because they would result in millions of dollars in cuts in other health care spending. The Obama administration also reacted negatively to the legislation, which was the product of negotiations between House and Senate Republicans with no substantial input from Democrats. Democrats have repeatedly accused Republicans of siding with the National Rifle Association rather than with the victims of gun violence. And Democrats picked up a new slogan, saying that the N. R. A. stands for \u201cNo Republican Action. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628528.6873536}
