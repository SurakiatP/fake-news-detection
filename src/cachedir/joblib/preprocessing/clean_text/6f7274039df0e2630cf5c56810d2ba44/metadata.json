[Roseann Sdoia, a Boston native who was a spectator near the finish line of the race in 2013, was hit by shrapnel from the second bomb that exploded, the Daily Mail reported.  Firefighter Mike Materia stepped in to save Sdoia\u2019s life by using a belt as a makeshift tourniquet, and he held her hand as she was rushed to the hospital. While at the hospital, Sdoia\u2019s mother tried to set him up with her. \u201cIn the hospital, my mom tried to set me up with him,\u201d Sdoia told the New York Post. \u201cShe was like, \u2018Oh, did you see that firefighter? He\u2019s so cute.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018Mom, I just got blown up. \u2019\u201d Sdoia\u2019s leg required amputation, and Materia was there by her side throughout the recovery process. \u201cI do feel that, in a sense, some things happen for a reason,\u201d Sdoia said. The couple went on their first date in June 2013, and Materia proposed to Sdoia in December. He put a special engraved dog tag on their dog Sal, saying \u201cMike wants to know  \u2026     If you\u2019ll marry him. \u201d The couple plans to have a small wedding in October or November. They plan to release a book in March called Perfect Strangers, which tells the story of four lives that intersected during the bombing.'"}, "time": 1742564600.1288688}
