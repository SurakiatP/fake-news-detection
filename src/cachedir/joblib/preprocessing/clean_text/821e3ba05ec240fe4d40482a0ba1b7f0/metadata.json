In a separate social media post, Cotton characterized Booker\u2019s transparent political opportunism, testifying against his colleague to further his own \u201cpresidential aspirations,\u201d as \u201cdisgraceful. \u201d \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed that Senator Booker has chosen to start his 2020 presidential campaign by testifying against Senator Sessions,\u201d Cotton wrote on Facebook. \u201cThis disgraceful breach of custom is especially surprising since Senator Booker just last year said he was \u2018honored to have partnered with Senator Sessions\u2019 on a resolution honoring   marchers. \u201d Cotton continued: Senator Booker says he feels compelled to speak out because Senator Session wants to keep criminals behind bars, drugs off our streets, and amnesty from becoming law. He\u2019s welcome to oppose these   policies and vote against Senator Sessions\u2019s nomination, but what is so unique about those views to require his extraordinary testimony? Nothing. This hearing simply offers a platform for his presidential aspirations. Senator Booker is better than that, and he knows better. Cotton\u2019s claim that Booker\u2019s decision was motivated by his own political aspirations was echoed throughout the beltway. NBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough noted that there was \u201ca collective groan\u201d \u2014   and Democratic lawmakers, in particular, were \u201cirked\u201d \u2014   as they watched Booker\u2019s \u201cobviously calculated\u201d decision to \u201claunc[h] his bid for the 2020 campaign\u201d before the Senate Judiciary Committee. NPR\u2019s Cokie Roberts described the maneuver as \u201c \u201d.

Carney writes: The top recipient of money [in the 2014 midterm election] from the financial sector was Sen. Cory Booker, who pocketed $4. 5 million from financial executives and PACs. Within that sector, Booker dominated among cash from real estate developers (almost 50 percent more than the Senate  ). He also dominated in Wall Street money. Carney reports that Booker\u2019s support for the policies of his corporatist donors has been  .   publications, Carney notes, have described Booker as \u201cdisturbingly tight with Wall Street and entrenched financial interests\u201d \u2014   a politician who \u201cshares a worldview with the financial elites who fund his campaigns,\u201d and who \u201crepresents the interests of both Wall Street and Silicon Valley. \u201d By contrast, Sessions is   as the intellectual   of the conservative   populist movement that emphasizes the need to enact an agenda that puts the interests of American workers first. Sessions, Carney writes, has clashed with the Silicon Valley tycoons and \u201cWall Street titans who have bankrolled Booker\u2019s rapid rise\u201d \u2014  most notably, on the issue of immigration, where Sessions has pushed for policies that prioritize the job and wage opportunities of working Americans over corporatists\u2019 desire for cheap labor. In recent months, Cotton has seemed primed to take up Sessions\u2019 mantle as the leader of this populist movement in the Senate. In particular, Cotton has become a vocal champion for American workers of all backgrounds against the     policies lobbied for by corporate special interests and advanced by Washington politicians like Cory Booker, who represent the interests of the donor class. In a New York Times   last month, Cotton wrote:   Trump now has a clear mandate not only to stop illegal immigration, but also to finally cut the   influx of   immigrants that undermines American workers  \u2026     For too long, our immigration policy has skewed toward the interests of the wealthy and powerful: Employers get cheaper labor, and professionals get cheaper personal services like housekeeping. We now need an immigration policy that focuses less on the most powerful and more on everyone else  \u2026     In some quarters, proposals like these invoke cries of \u201cnativism\u201d and \u201cxenophobia. \u201d But recent immigrants are the very Americans who have to compete with new immigrants for jobs. Far from being   this proposal would give recent arrivals a better shot at higher wages, stable work and assimilation. Following Cotton\u2019s clarion call for an immigration policy that benefits American workers, the Center for Immigration Studies\u2019 Mark Krikorian wrote a piece titled \u201cImmigration: As Sessions Moves On, Cotton Steps Up. \u201d In the post, Krikorian assured voters that as Sessions, Congress\u2019s tireless advocate for an America First immigration policy, departs the Senate to join the incoming President\u2019s cabinet, American workers should \u201cfear not\u201d as \u201cTom Cotton has reported for duty. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563258.5210862}
