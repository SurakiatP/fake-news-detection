Hannity said he expected Comey, who was fired last week by Trump, to have multiple opportunities given a memo he penned that was leaked to The New York Times about his meeting with Trump had potentially spurred this appointment of a special prosecutor. \u201cNow James Comey  \u2014   he didn\u2019t do his job,\u201d Hannity said. \u201cHe got fired. Now he\u2019s a bitter partisan and he\u2019s out for blood. He\u2019s a disgruntled fired  . And frankly, anything he has to say for himself in a memo  \u2014   well first, it is his word versus Trump, but it is meaningless. Donald Trump is not getting impeached over this. And it\u2019s only a matter of time  \u2014   what did I say after he got fired? Comey will get a   dollar book deal, a movie, a   primetime special  \u2014   Diane Sawyer, or why not George Stephanopoulos? Why not go totally in for the Clintons and probably a MSNBC contributorship? He wants to be booked on Rachel Maddow, Stephen Colbert, Bill Maher  \u2014   the biggest Trump haters in the country. \u201d Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor'"}, "time": 1742561965.2279747}
