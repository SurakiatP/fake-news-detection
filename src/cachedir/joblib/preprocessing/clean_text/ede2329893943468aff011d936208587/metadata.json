Just recently, the University of Michigan\u2019s Innocence Clinic, part of the University\u2019s law school, was awarded $250,000 to train attorneys to fight wrongful shaken baby syndrome convictions.

This was after experts testified that the children\u2019s symptoms just as well have been caused by birth trauma and not skakv\u00e5ld. Several parents have subsequently cleared of suspicions that have harmed their child with skakv\u00e5ld. \\nComment on this article at MedicalKidnap.com. \\nSee Also: Child Abuse Pediatricians: An \u201cEthically Bankrupt\u201d Profession that Destroys Families Support the cause of Medical Kidnapping by purchasing our new book!
