Instead it\u2019s an ongoing dialogue about what\u2019s really happening in the markets\u2026 the economy\u2026 and governments\u2026 so you can understand the world around you and make better decisions for yourself. \\nDavid believes the world -- certainly the United States -- is at a great inflection point in human history. The massive credit inflation of the last three decades has reached its apogee and is now going to splatter spectacularly. \\nThis will have lasting ramifications on how governments tax and regulate you\u2026 the type of work you and your family members will have available and what you get paid\u2026 the value of your nest egg\u2026 and all other areas comprising your quality of life.
