Cashing in on PM Narendra Modi\u2019s recent shell-shockingly bold move of invalidating currency notes of the \u20b9500 and \u20b91000 denomination, Hasbro has announced that for the first time in the board game\u2019s history, real notes of these denominations will be used. (Image via hasbro.com) \\n\u201cHUGE ANNOUNCEMENT: India, we\u2019re coming soon to you guys, with your own version of Monopoly! Say goodbye to Boardwalk, Vermont, Park Place, Ventnor etc etc. You will soon see Connaught Place, Park Street, Marine Drive, Anna Salai, Silk Board and so on, along with a dozen places that belong to Robert Vadra and DLF! And guess what? For the first time in the history of this classic board game, we will be using real notes for \u20b9500 and \u20b91000! So this is an open offer to you all \u2013 please send us all your notes of these denominations and we will transfer the corresponding amount to you online! Avail this historic opportunity!\u201d Hasbro CEO Brian Goldner announced. \\nGoldner added that it\u2019s not just the properties that would be Indian. \u201cThere will be a \u2018Go to Tihar Jail\u2019 box at one of the corners. There will also be a \u2018Get out of Tihar Jail free\u2019 card with Sanjay Dutt\u2019s face on it. As for the vehicles players would use, we will have a bullock cart, a Bajaj Chetak, a Maruti 800 and so on. And guess what \u2013 there will be no notes for denominations of \u20b91 and \u20b95! True to the Indian spirit, we will have Eclairs chocolates and 5-star bars in our game banks. The deal with Cadburys will be finalized soon. We\u2019ll make this game as Indian as it can possibly get, all you folks as well as your illegal Bangladeshi immigrants are going to love it!\u201d the CEO told The UnReal Times . \\nAccording to sources, Hasbro is likely to be helped by Mukesh Ambani\u2019s Reliance Industries Ltd in the distribution of the game. \u201cOh I absolutely love Monopoly, I just can\u2019t have enough of it!\u201d Ambani reportedly smiled while discussing the deal with Goldner. Hasbro is also said to have been approached by NCP supremo Sharad Pawar for the supply of currency notes in the state of Maharashtra. Sources in Tamil Nadu added that the ruling AIADMK wanted special \u2018Amma\u2019 currency notes for the game packs distributed in Tamil Nadu, but their request was reportedly turned down by Goldner. \\nThe announcement has drawn reactions from across the border too. While Pakistan has warned Hasbro of including any property from Kashmir in the game, China has issued a similar warning to not include any property from Arunachal Pradesh. From the center of the country, a letter by the Rashtreeya Swayamsevak Sangh has urged the brand to include other countries like Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka etc and make the game set in Akhand Bharat as opposed to being India-specific. \\nRegardless though, Monopoly India is all set to be officially launched soon at the office of the BJP\u2019s Margdarshak Mandal. \u201cJoshi bhai , Yashwant bhai and I are greatly looking forward to this! Will be quite a change from the usual Rummy or Bridge,\u201d BJP patriarch LK Advani, who recently turned 89, sniffed.
