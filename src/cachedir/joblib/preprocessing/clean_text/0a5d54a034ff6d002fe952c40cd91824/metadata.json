Its people are sharply divided, but more than that, covert finance is pushing things towards unrest and martial law.\\nIf Soros money and its ilk proves effective, inauguration day on January 20th will become one of the largest demonstrations on record, with a group calling itself #DISRUPTJ20 planning to block \u201cpeaceful transition\u201d and disrupt Trump\u2019s swearing in.\\nThe groups promoting it are calling on people nationwide to join in, and for business in D.C. to take sides and take \u201cdirect action\u201d and attempt to stop the parade, block streets and other delay the events as scheduled:\\n#DisruptJ20: Call for a bold mobilization against the inauguration of Donald Trump on January 20, 2017 \\nOn Friday, January 20, 2017, Donald Trump will be inaugurated as President of the United States. We call on all people of good conscience to join in disrupting the ceremonies. If Trump is to be inaugurated at all, let it happen behind closed doors, showing the true face of the security state Trump will preside over. It must be made clear to the whole world that the vast majority of people in the United States do not support his presidency or consent to his rule.\\n[\u2026] If there is going to be positive change in this society, we have to make it ourselves, together, through direct action. From day one, the Trump presidency will be a disaster. #DisruptJ20 will be the start of the resistance. We must take to the streets and protest, blockade, disrupt, intervene, sit in, walk out, rise up, and make more noise and good trouble than the establishment can bear. The parade must be stopped. We must delegitimize Trump and all he represents. It\u2019s time to defend ourselves, our loved ones, and the world that sustains us as if our lives depend on it\u2014because they do.\\n[\u2026]\\nIf you can\u2019t make it to Washington, DC on January 20, take to the streets wherever you are. We call on our comrades to organize demonstrations and other actions for the night of January 20. There is also a call for a general strike to take place. Organize a walkout at your school now. Workers: call out sick and take the day off. No work, no school, no shopping, no housework.\\n#DisruptJ20 Spread the word.
