[Schweizer said Podesta has \u201ca very interesting relationship with Russia, going back to when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. \u201d  \u201cWhen she was secretary of state, he was an adviser. He sat on her foreign policy advisory board. We know from the Podesta emails that he was talking to her all the time on everything from speeches to personnel decisions to policy positions,\u201d Schweizer elaborated. \u201cIn 2011, he joins the executive board of this small energy company in Massachusetts called Joule Energy,\u201d Schweizer recalled. \u201cAnd Joule Energy, about two months after he joins the executive board, gets a large infusion of cash. They get one billion rubles, which is about $35 to $45 million, invested from Russia. It comes from a very unusual entity, this entity called RUSNANO. \u201d  \u201cRUSNANO is this   investment fund, called \u2018Putin\u2019s Child\u2019 by the Russian Science Ministry, so it shows you how connected this fund is,\u201d he explained. \u201cThey actually buy an equity stake in this John   company, which they can do. You can raise the question of why they\u2019re doing it while he\u2019s advising Hillary Clinton, but they can legally do that. \u201d \u201cThe problem for Podesta becomes when he joins the Obama White House as counselor to the president in 2013,\u201d he continued. \u201cIn order to do that, he\u2019s got to file those large, cumbersome, but I think essential financial disclosure forms where you list what boards are you on, that you are connected to or have been connected to in the last year, what entities. You\u2019re also required to disclose your stock holdings. \u201d  \u201cIn the case of Podesta, there are two omissions. One of them is the way the Joule was structured, it has three corporate boards. It has one based in Massachusetts, one based in the Netherlands, and then it has a holding company. John Podesta, according to corporate records, was on all three of those boards. He only listed two of them on his financial disclosure. He omitted probably the most important one, which was the holding company,\u201d said Schweizer. \u201cNow, you could say okay, maybe it was just an omission. He listed two of the three that\u2019s not bad,\u201d he granted. \u201cThe problem is that he failed to disclose what he did with the 75, 000 shares of stock that he had in the company that were given to him as a board member. He gave them to his daughter through an LLC. \u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a question of whether she actually owned them  \u2014   and by that I mean the Podesta emails show that he had a   email conversation with Joule Energy executives and people connected with them, even though he ostensibly didn\u2019t own stock anymore. But he failed to disclose that transaction. He failed to disclose the 75, 000 shares he owned that he gave to his daughter. That is a direct, clear violation of what you are supposed to disclose on these federal forms,\u201d Schweizer said. Marlow noted there have been \u201czero pieces of hard evidence connecting the Trump campaign to the Russian government,\u201d while \u201cthere is so much evidence, much of it uncovered by you, connecting the Clintons with the Russian government. \u201d  \u201cAnd yet, the media is obsessed with one and not the other,\u201d he said. Schweizer found the disparity of coverage interesting as well. \u201cI\u2019m a big believer that you need to investigate and look into things, particularly if you\u2019re talking about foreign governments or foreign entities trying to influence our politicians,\u201d he declared. \u201cWhat we know right now about the Russia story as it relates to Trump is the relationship, as it were, amounts to meetings that some Trump officials had with people from Russia. Those Trump officials never really made it into the Trump administration  \u2014   with the exception of Michael Flynn, who left pretty quickly,\u201d he pointed out.  \u201cThe thesis that everybody is operating on is the Russians helped Trump win and Trump is going to do all these favors for Russia. The problem is, when you look at the personnel decisions, who\u2019s running Russia policy in the United States  \u2014   whether that\u2019s General Mattis at the Pentagon, whether that is McMaster, the national security adviser, whether that\u2019s the CIA director, whether that\u2019s the director of Russia policy on the National Security Council, who\u2019s a very solid scholar from the Brookings Institution  \u2014   none of these are remotely \u201d he said.  \u201cAll you have is sort of this concern that the Russians were hacking during the election, which I think is a legitimate concern and a theory that hasn\u2019t been proved, that there was a connection between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. There\u2019s just been no evidence of that,\u201d he noted.  \u201cMy point is both should be looked into, but you actually have very substantial things that went on when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, that, number one, included the transfer of money to the Clintons and to John Podesta and number two, very serious favors done by the Hillary Clinton State Department to the Russians, including technology transfer, et cetera,\u201d he said.  \u201cThe kind of scenario that people envision happened with Trump happened in the Clinton State Department. And yet, there seems to be a lack of interest in pursuing and investigating precisely what those relationships were and how everything was carried out,\u201d Schweizer observed.
