[Lee wrote on Instagram, \u201cSmells MAD fishy to me, stinks to the high heavens\u201d  Lee and others feel Kaepernick is being blackballed because he kneeled during the national anthem last season. Perhaps that is part of the story, but not the whole story. The biggest reason Kaepernick\u2019s still unsigned is that he\u2019s just not a very good quarterback right now. His play has slipped significantly since he helped lead the San Francisco 49ers to a 2013 Super Bowl appearance. The NFL has a dearth of elite quarterbacks. If a team felt Kaepernick would solve their quarterback issue, he\u2019d likely be on a team right now. Lee asked, \u201cWhat owner and GM is going to step up and sign Colin so their team has a better chance to win?\u201d Mr. Lee, teams are very forgiving if they think a player can help them win. That is why Kaepernick\u2019s fellow   Miami receiver Kenny Stills, recently got a new   $32 million contract from the Dolphins. He was forgiven because he had a terrific 2016 season (nine touchdowns) and the Dolphins think he can help them win. The Dolphins are also bringing back safety Michael Thomas, who also kneeled. He\u2019s a very good safety and special teams player. Teams are willing to add mercurial players they think will help them win. Why do you think wide receiver Terrell Owens got so many jobs? However, if teams think a player isn\u2019t very good, and a headache to boot, they tend to stay away. Kaepernick\u2019s unemployment right now isn\u2019t as much related to disrespecting the country and police (remember his   socks last summer) but more about his underwhelming play. Last year, in    losses to a pair of terrible teams, Chicago and the New York Jets, he showed why he\u2019s out of work. Against the Bears, he threw for four yards in three quarters before being benched. Against the Jets, he threw for four yards in the second half, against perhaps the NFL\u2019s worst secondary, and 49ers lost in overtime. One problem is he\u2019s not very good at reading defenses, and gets fixated on his first read, not doing a great job going through his progressions. ESPN NFL analyst Trent Dilfer feels Kapenerick is a \u201cremedial passer\u201d once defenses take away his first read. Dilfer told Sports Illustrated in 2013, \u201cHe takes his first read and sticks with it. But if they take your first read away, that\u2019s pretty much it. You don\u2019t work deep through your progressions, you don\u2019t get the ball out to other receivers. \u201d This has been problem the last four seasons. He also tends to abandon the pocket too quickly. In other words, he scrambles too much. The great NFL quarterbacks like Tom Brady, Drew Brees and Aaron Rodgers do their best work from the pocket, rarely running. \u201cHe\u2019s going to have to tie his legs in training camp,\u201d ESPN\u2019s Steve Young said in 2014. \u201cLiterally, he should tie his legs, physically, so he can\u2019t do anything but throw from the pocket. \u201d Also, his throwing mechanics are flawed leading to accuracy issues. He once admitted he\u2019s not that into \u201cthrowing mechanics. \u201d Teams aren\u2019t going to jump through hoops to sign inaccurate free agent quarterbacks. \u201cThere is no more important attribute for a quarterback than accuracy, especially for a free agent who is shopping himself to teams with various schemes,\u201d wrote ESPN NFL columnist Kevin Seifert. \u201cAll passers miss throws, but Kaepernick over the past two seasons has done it as much or as more as anyone. \u201d So it\u2019s more performance, than a perceived lack of patriotism, that has Keapernick unemployed right now.'"}, "time": 1742561861.4277446}
