[James Lowell Pennington, 57, who does not have a license to practice medicine in Colorado, was arrested Thursday and charged with felony reckless aggravated assault causing serious bodily injury, the Denver Post reported.  Police called Pennington in for an interview, which he agreed to after the victim was taken to a hospital for excessive bleeding. Pennington told investigators that he willingly performed the procedure at the victim\u2019s apartment in Denver, KUSA reported. Detectives said he used an Army surgical kit that contained a scalpel, lidocaine, medical dressing, and other medical equipment. According to a record of the interview, the suspect \u201cused the scalpel and surgically disconnected and removed the victim\u2019s two testicles and then sutured the opening back up. \u201d The victim\u2019s wife was with the victim throughout the   procedure. Pennington allegedly told them to call 911 if any problems occurred after the procedure. The victim\u2019s wife told police she called 911 after a large amount of blood poured out from the wound when she was changing his dressing. Paramedics called the police. Doctors could not reattach the testicles because of the time that passed between the procedure and the 911 call. The victim suffered serious injuries that run the risk of \u201cpermanent disfigurement,\u201d according to the affidavit. Police say Pennington is a licensed pilot, not a medical professional in Colorado.'"}, "time": 1742562800.6368194}
