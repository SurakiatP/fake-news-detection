Now, the nation is awash with anguish over word that SMAP  \u2014   Japan\u2019s   boy band, if it can still be called that with its youngest member pushing 40  \u2014   is splitting up. The news has dominated newspaper headlines and television talk shows since the band\u2019s announcement this month. Even the mayor of Tokyo and two members of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s cabinet have weighed in. One said he was worried about the effect on the Japanese economy, the world\u2019s  . \u201cWe will not let them stop!\u201d a grieving fan wrote in one of more than a dozen petitions on change. org pleading with the aging heartthrobs to remain together. \u201cIf we let them go and disband, it means Japan is finished. \u201d To understand the bedlam unfolding here, think of the Beatles\u2019 breaking up, the airing of the final episode of \u201cSeinfeld\u201d and the \u201cconscious uncoupling\u201d of Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin all rolled into one  \u2014   the end of an era on the Japanese cultural landscape. SMAP\u2019s most famous saccharine single, \u201cThe Only Flower in the World,\u201d is regularly taught in Japan\u2019s schools. But SMAP is not just a wildly popular band whose albums have sold more than 35 million copies, making it one of the most successful musical acts in Japanese history. For two decades, its five members  \u2014   Masahiro Nakai, Takuya Kimura, Goro Inagaki, Tsuyoshi Kusanagi and Shingo Katori  \u2014   have also hosted one of Japan\u2019s   television programs, \u201cSMAP X SMAP,\u201d a   variety show in which they cook for celebrity guests, compete in games, perform comedic skits and, of course, sing. Each has starred on his own in numerous television series, movies and commercials. The frontman, Mr. Nakai, has been a newscaster for several Olympic Games. The group, whose members started out as teenagers performing on skateboards and now range in age from 39 to 44, managed to both broaden its audience beyond adolescent girls and hold on to them over the years. Many of their most ardent fans are women who grew up with them. SMAP, an acronym for Sports Music Assemble People, also has legions of fans in China, South Korea, Taiwan and elsewhere in Asia. In 2011, it performed in Tokyo for Wen Jiabao, the Chinese premier at the time, and then gave a rare concert in Beijing  \u2014   which may have helped ease tensions after a Chinese trawler collided with Japanese coast guard ships in disputed waters of the East China Sea. Much of the drama and commentary surrounding SMAP\u2019s breakup has been tied to suspicions among fans and industry analysts of skulduggery by the talent agency that manages the group, Johnny  Associates, which has dominated the Japanese   scene for nearly four decades. Founded by Johnny Kitagawa, now one of the most powerful figures in the Japanese entertainment industry, the agency recruits boys and puts them through a rigorous training program of singing and dancing. They start out as backup performers before the agency assembles them into new bands that it promotes and tightly controls, leveraging the success of its other acts. That business model, pioneered in Asia to dizzying success by Mr. Kitagawa with SMAP and other groups, has since been replicated by talent agencies in China and South Korea, many of which have been accused of signing children to \u201cslave contracts\u201d that require them to surrender half or more of all profits for as long as a decade. According to Japanese news reports, SMAP decided to call it quits after four of its members tried to leave the Johnny agency, which is said to control their appearances on television and in movies, as well as merchandising rights to their images. In announcing the band\u2019s dissolution, the agency said it would continue to represent each of the group\u2019s members as solo acts. The agency said it had initially proposed a temporary break but that \u201csome members\u201d wanted a permanent split. SMAP seemed on the verge of disbanding in January as rumors swirled of infighting. But in a rare live appearance on their television show, the singers, wearing somber black suits, announced that they were staying together and apologized for having caused their fans distress. The public apology was viewed in nearly seven million households, and even the prime minister, Mr. Abe, was moved to comment, telling a parliamentary committee that \u201cthe group will remain intact in response to many fans\u2019 wishes, which is good. \u201d Mr. Abe has yet to address the breakup. Each of the band\u2019s members has issued a written statement, but so far only two have spoken in public about the split, apologizing on their weekly radio shows for surprising fans with the announcement. Writing in Josei Seven, a weekly magazine, the cultural critic and columnist Akio Nakamori asked if the performers were being muzzled. \u201cJust recently the emperor talked about the abdication,\u201d Mr. Nakamori wrote, referring to the televised address in which Emperor Akihito expressed his desire to retire. \u201cIt was such an unusual thing. He decided to talk to the people. I wonder if SMAP is more untouchable than the imperial family? They should at least have a press conference or even a recorded video, and directly talk to fans. \u201d Given SMAP\u2019s popularity in Asia, Japan\u2019s minister of economy, trade and industry, Hiroshige Seko, said he was concerned that the breakup might undermine the country\u2019s \u201cCool Japan\u201d campaign, aimed at exporting Japanese culture to foreign countries. But there are signs that SMAP is already being replaced by its successors. On a visit this week to a store run by Johnny  Associates in the Harajuku neighborhood of Tokyo, I watched fans buy professional photo cards of their favorite singers, but there were no SMAP cards on sale. And when I checked out an official fan club in the Shibuya district, also operated by the agency, I saw videos only of other Japanese boy bands playing on a screen. A wall was covered with current promotional posters for multiple boy bands. There was just one for SMAP, from 2012.'"}, "time": 1742628521.3478298}
