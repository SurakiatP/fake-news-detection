And, while she has condemned Trump\u2019s lewd remarks \u2013 including how \u201cloving fathers are sickened by the thought of their daughters being exposed to this kind of vicious language\u201d \u2013 the Obamas have hosted in the \u201cThe People\u2019s House,\u201d where their two daughters reside, rappers who obscenely rap about date rape and sexual predatory behavior.\\nIndeed, it is not the presidential race that \u201clittle girls\u201d are tuned into to hear \u201cabout who they should look like, how they should act,\u201d or hearing \u201clanguage so obscene that many of us worry about our children hearing it when we turn on the TV,\u201d as Obama claimed in her speech. Young people are not watching TV with mommy and daddy. They tune into the music/entertainment world that promotes \u201chateful language about women\u201d performed by White House guest rappers such as:\\nRick Ross, \u201cU.O.E.N.O.\u201d\\nPut Molly all in her champagne, she ain\u2019t even know it\\nI took her home and I enjoyed that, she ain\u2019t even know it\u2026\\n(Molly is a street name for ecstasy, a \u2018love drug\u2019) \\nBig Sean, \u201cMona Lisa\u201d \\nI believe in God and rubbers\\nEven if we sex you are not my lover\\nHit you on the couch and not the covers \\nAnd if you bring you friend then we got to f#ck her\u2026\\nWhen they go low, we go high\\nBeyond the rappers, Michelle Obama also has elevated Beyonce\u00b4 \u2013 a performer who dresses and dances in sync with her sexually explicit lyric library \u2013 as a \u201crole model for young girls around the world,\u201d and is \u201cproud to have my daughter grow up in a world where she has people like you, to look up to.\u201d\\nThus, while the first lady continually brags about raising the moral bar of integrity while condemning Trump\u2019s words and deeds, the media have ignored the far greater of two evils: The blatant hypocrisy of Michelle Obama, who supports a deplorable, debased entertainment industry drenched in debauchery that is poisoning the planet.\\nPublisher\u2019s Note: We are political atheists and support neither presidential candidate.\\nThe post Michelle Obama Promotes Lewd Rappers appeared first on PaulCraigRoberts.org .'"}, "time": 1742563257.4792871}
