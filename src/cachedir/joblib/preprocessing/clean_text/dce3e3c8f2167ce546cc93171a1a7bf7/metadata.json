An African-American church in Mississippi, the Hopewell M.B. Church in Greeneville , has been set ablaze, causing heavy damage to the building \u2013 and in case there was any mystery as to who was responsible, \u201cVOTE TRUMP\u201d was spray-painted on the side. \\nFor all their talk about \u201creligious freedom,\u201d conservative Trump fans sure does have a fondness for attacking religious institutions. Mosques have been torched around the country in response to terrorist attacks , collectively punishing members of an entire religion for crimes committed by mentally disturbed individuals. \\nBlack churches have also been torched throughout the South as white supremacists and neo-Nazis come out of the wood-work, emboldened by Trump\u2019s racial dogwhistles and ethno-nationalist rabble-rousing. The worst of these targeted attacks came last summer when a white supremacist walked into the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, S.C, and murdered nine peaceful worshippers. \\nThis is the second act of domestic terrorism committed in the United States today, coming just hours before a white man murdered two police officers in Iowa, and as Trump continues to rile up his base and perpetuate the delusions of a conspiracy against him, it\u2019s not likely to be the last.'"}, "time": 1742561640.3847623}
