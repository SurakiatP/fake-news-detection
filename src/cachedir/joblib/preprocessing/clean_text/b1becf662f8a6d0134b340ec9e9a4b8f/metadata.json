Some in the audience gasp, including several women wearing head scarves. Onstage, a Muslim terrorist in an orange prison jumpsuit appears. During the play, we learn that he has killed people at a Jewish school whom, in other circumstances, he might have befriended, we come to understand. The play is \u201cG\u00e9henne,\u201d or \u201cHell,\u201d the latest by Isma\u00ebl Saidi, a comic Belgian playwright and actor, whose work  \u2014   with its comedic touches and visceral understanding of the frustrations of young, underprivileged European Muslims  \u2014   has been used by the French and Belgian governments as a cultural weapon against radicalization. His play \u201cJihad,\u201d from 2014, was about three hapless Belgian Muslims who travel to Syria but eventually understand that their attempt at holy war is a grave mistake. But with \u201cG\u00e9henne,\u201d the somewhat hopeful message of \u201cJihad\u201d  \u2014   that terrorists can come back from the dark side  \u2014   has been tempered. Mr. Saidi, a practicing Muslim and former police officer, said that performing \u201cJihad\u201d in prisons across Belgium and France for the past two years has caused him to doubt whether violent religious zealots can ever really change. If a person doesn\u2019t want to, \u201cyou can take this guy to A. A. all your life, but one day he will drink again,\u201d Mr. Saidi said in a recent interview after a performance of \u201cG\u00e9henne\u201d before a packed audience of nearly 1, 000 people at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre   here. His latest play implicitly argues for prevention, suggesting that teaching young people how to get along in a multicultural society is far better than trying to reform violent criminals. \u201cThe only cure I think is like a vaccination that had to be done long before,\u201d he added. Mr. Saidi\u2019s more sober outlook about deradicalization  \u2014   which he said was shaped by conversations with inmates jailed on terrorism charges  \u2014   was echoed by a report released last month by two French senators. They found that France\u2019s approach, especially creating a handful of rehabilitation centers to   violent terrorists, had been ineffective. But even as the centers\u2019 effectiveness is questioned, some are not ready to jettison such efforts. Ouisa Kies, a sociologist who has worked with terrorists in French prisons, said culture was fundamental to programs that help bring jihadists back from violence. \u201cThe problem is that France is very late to this,\u201d she said. \u201cThe failure is in coordination and evaluation, not in the contents of the programs. \u201d In the past two years, after a flurry of terrorist attacks, the French government has begun investing in efforts to shape young hearts and minds. It has given money to schools and other venues that host \u201cJihad,\u201d while the Belgian government has spent 50, 000 euros (about $54, 000) to underwrite tours of the play. \u201cJihad\u201d has also been included in the French Education Ministry\u2019s school curriculum aimed at preventing radicalization. Muriel Domenach, who leads the French government\u2019s task force on the prevention of radicalization, called Mr. Saidi\u2019s work both funny and important. \u201cIt\u2019s a   counternarrative,\u201d she said. It shows \u201cthat of course there\u2019s discrimination, lack of prospects\u201d for many young Muslims, \u201cbut at the same time it\u2019s everyone\u2019s responsibility, including citizens who are Muslim, to be taking action. \u201d The play, in which three men tell stories of personal humiliation that led them to militant Islam, was seen as prescient when it debuted in Schaerbeek, an area of Brussels with a large North African immigrant population. That happened just weeks before terrorists attacked the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket in Paris in January 2015. (Some of the terrorists involved in the attacks in Paris on Nov. 13, 2015, were from Schaerbeek.) Mr. Saidi, who was born in Belgium to parents from Morocco, dislikes being told he was prescient. \u201cWhat pains me is that this is about things we\u2019ve been living for the past 25 years,\u201d he said of \u201cJihad\u201d after a performance at a cultural center in    a Paris suburb with a large immigrant population. \u201cSyria is just an excuse,\u201d he added. \u201cMy play is about broken identities. \u201d It\u2019s shot through with a quick,   humor. When the   jihadists meet an Arab named Michel, unaware that he\u2019s Christian, one tells him not to worry, he\u2019s not in Belgium looking for a job so he can use his real name. The \u201cJihad\u201d performance was well received that night. \u201cWe need the kind of humor you find in \u2018Jihad\u2019 to talk about this topic,\u201d said Hamza Irfan, 15, who attended with an   program. \u201cIt speaks to everyone. It doesn\u2019t feel boring, or depressing, or too light it just feels serious. \u201d Naghmana Kayani, who runs the   program, said \u201cJihad\u201d was an important tool in potential prevention. \u201cEvery time there\u2019s an attack, it affects us,\u201d she said. Instead of trafficking in stereotypes, she added, \u201cJihad\u201d helps \u201cfight against obscurantism. \u201d More than 100, 000 people have seen \u201cJihad,\u201d and Mr. Saidi holds emotional public conversations with audiences afterward. He still performs in prisons, but not for those convicted of terrorism. \u201cThey hate it,\u201d he said, referring to his play. \u201cSo it\u2019s bad for them, and bad for me. \u201d Taking \u201cJihad\u201d on tour and discussing it with audiences has changed him in other ways, and made him question his faith. \u201cI am still the same, but the way I see things changed,\u201d he said. \u201cI love something that I hated before: I love doubt. \u201d That doubt comes through in \u201cG\u00e9henne,\u201d in which Mr. Saidi plays Isma\u00ebl, who has lost his legs after blowing himself up at the Jewish school. In prison, he imagines a conversation with a Roman Catholic priest who smokes hash with him and says he questions the existence of God, and with a woman he takes a shine to and who he eventually discovers is Jewish  \u2014   the first Jew he has ever met. At the end of the play, we discover the woman and her daughter were victims of his attack, and the conversations are visions of a world that might have been. \u201cHe killed her and her kid, and he understands at the end,\u201d Mr. Saidi said. \u201cThat\u2019s hell for him. \u201d He said that doing a benefit performance of \u201cJihad\u201d for members of 13 Onze 15, an association of survivors and family members of victims of the Nov. 13 terrorist attacks in Paris, had caused him to revise \u201cG\u00e9henne\u201d so that Isma\u00ebl seeks forgiveness after realizing what he\u2019s done. \u201cEveryone was really, really moved,\u201d said Aurelia Gilbert, who survived the attack at the Bataclan concert hall in Paris. \u201cIt gives a life, a name, a story behind those guys. They\u2019re not only the faces you see in the newspaper, and they are dead. \u201d After the recent performance of \u201cG\u00e9henne\u201d in Brussels, a Belgian woman who gave her name only as Antoinette said that she had come to see the play because her daughter had converted to Islam and had gone to Syria. She had traveled to Syria to bring her daughter back. The play \u201cshows how young people should reflect on what\u2019s going on, on what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Antoinette said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really complex problem, for those who go and those who return. \u201d Mr. Saidi said that his message in \u201cG\u00e9henne\u201d was \u201cthat everything begins with ignorance and hate. \u201d He added, \u201cIf somebody had taught Isma\u00ebl love for someone else, and not hatred for Jews, nothing would have happened. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563197.2970576}
