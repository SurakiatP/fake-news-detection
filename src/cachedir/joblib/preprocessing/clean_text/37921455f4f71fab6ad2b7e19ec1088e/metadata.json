Let\u2019s turn it over to Adam Nagourney, our Los Angeles bureau chief, for today\u2019s introduction. LOS ANGELES  \u2014   And on Thursday, it rained. Again. The arrival of another winter rain here, a wet end to a week that began with heavy snows in the Sierra Nevada, has begged a welcome question: Is the drought that punished California for six years over? No question California has turned a corner. There was more rain in Los Angeles in December than since the drought began for better and worse. The rain this week shut down Laurel Canyon Boulevard after the waterlogged porch of a house collapsed into the roadway, and flash flood warnings were issued in Los Angeles as storms swept back and forth across the area on Thursday evening. In Northern California, the storms produced extensive flooding in Sonoma County and around Sacramento  \u2014   among the   parts of the state. Ski resorts reported that 12 feet of snow fell in Tahoe. Mudslides closed Interstate 80 as the storm passed through Sierra Nevada. At least five people have died, officials said. Reservoirs that were parched last year are close to capacity. The snowpack  \u2014   which keeps the water flowing into the early summer as the snow melts  \u2014   is 161 percent of normal. The United States Drought Monitor for this week reported that 42 percent of the state was out of drought conditions, compared with 3 percent last year. \u201cIn terms of surface water, most of California is no longer in drought,\u201d wrote Jay Lund, the director of the Center for Watershed Sciences at the University of California in Davis. Still, winter is not even half over. Many years have started off wet and gone completely dry. Climate change has produced higher temperatures, which could melt away the snowpack before summer. And parts of the state remain dry. But after six years of mandatory conservation orders, there seems reason for celebration. \u201cThis series of storms has done more than make a dent in the drought, which is a huge relief,\u201d said Felicia Marcus, the head of the State Water Resources Control Board. \u201cBut it\u2019s a little early to have a drought\u2019s over party. \u201d (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.) \u2022 Congratulations, Los Angeles, on getting the Chargers.

[KPCC] \u201cHello, I\u2019m Johnny Cash. \u201d That opening line, as if the assembled audience needed any introduction, gave way to a giddy roar and then, one of country music\u2019s great performances. It was on this day in 1968 that Johnny Cash played his \u201cAt Folsom Prison\u201d concert. The event was meant to revive Mr. Cash\u2019s career, which had flagged since the 1950s thanks to an    amphetamine habit. Executives at Mr. Cash\u2019s record label, Columbia Records, saw him as so unreliable that they kept the planning of the Folsom show a secret from the press, said Robert Hilburn, author of \u201cJohnny Cash: The Life. \u201d They weren\u2019t certain he would show. Thankfully, he did. \u201cAnd he was incredible. It was like he sensed this was a moment,\u201d said Mr. Hilburn, who himself attended the concert after hearing about it from a disc jockey. Mr. Cash tailored his song choices along themes of longing, sin and misfortune, including, of course, his 1955 hit \u201cFolsom Prison Blues. \u201d Assembled in the heavily guarded Dining Room 2, the inmates couldn\u2019t get enough. \u201cYou could just sense their spirit rising,\u201d said Mr. Hilburn. \u201cIt was just electrifying. \u201d The band actually performed twice, in the morning and afternoon, to ensure a good recording. \u201cAt Folsom Prison\u201d drew largely from the first show and was released four months later. It was a huge success and kicked off a resurgence in Mr. Cash\u2019s popularity. A year later, he did another prison record, \u201cAt San Quentin,\u201d which was also successful. In the wake of the performances, he became a prominent voice for prisoner rights. California Today goes live at 6 a. m. Pacific time weekdays. Tell us what you want to see: CAtoday@nytimes. com.
