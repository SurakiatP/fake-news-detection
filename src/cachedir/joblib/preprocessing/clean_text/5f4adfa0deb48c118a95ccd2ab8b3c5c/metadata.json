Trump has prompted a loud national discussion about male power and women\u2019s rights, the first woman to be a major party\u2019s presidential nominee was barely heard from. Though Hillary Clinton has stood at the center of feminist debates for more than two decades, she has at times been an imperfect messenger for the cause. That has never been more apparent than now, as her old missteps and her husband\u2019s history have effectively paralyzed her during a moment of widespread outrage. The most impassioned speeches on the topic have come not from her, but from the first lady, Michelle Obama, who said Mr. Trump\u2019s words had \u201cshaken me to my core,\u201d and from President Obama and others. When Mrs. Clinton herself spoke, she quickly changed the subject to other groups of people Mr. Trump had insulted, and she tried to lighten the mood with a joke about  watching cat videos. \u201cIt makes you want to turn off the news. It makes you want to unplug the internet or just look at cat GIFs,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told donors in San Francisco on Thursday, making her first remarks on Mr. Trump\u2019s treatment of women since several came forward to accuse him. \u201cI\u2019ve watched a lot of cats do a lot of weird and interesting things,\u201d she said, drawing a few laughs. \u201cBut we have a job to do. And it\u2019ll be good for people and for cats. \u201d The virtual silence from Mrs. Clinton speaks volumes about the complicated place she has occupied as a 1960s Wellesley feminist who stayed as a devoted wife to her husband through infidelities and humiliation. Forcefully denouncing sexual assault would most certainly provoke ugly attacks on Bill Clinton and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s role in countering the women who accused him of sexual misconduct. That painful past haunted Mrs. Clinton last Sunday when Mr. Trump invited some of her husband\u2019s accusers to the second presidential debate. In the days since, Mrs. Clinton has had to once again navigate the messy crosscurrents of politics, symbolism and her ambition to shatter \u201cthat highest, hardest glass ceiling\u201d of being elected the first female president. Now, when the collective voice of American women and victims of sexual assault seems to be letting out a cathartic scream, Mrs. Clinton has deferred to another first lady to speak for her. At the San Francisco   on Thursday, she pointed to Mrs. Obama\u2019s speech earlier that afternoon when the first lady placed her hand on her heart and spoke out for the many who were outraged. Speaking to college students in New Hampshire, Mrs. Obama called Mr. Trump\u2019s lewd remarks about how he had forced himself on women \u201cdisgraceful\u201d and \u201cintolerable. \u201d \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying that a candidate for president of the United States has bragged about sexually assaulting women,\u201d Mrs. Obama said as a crowd of young women watched with silent and somber expressions. \u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking about this  \u2014   it has shaken me to my core. \u201d Mrs. Clinton has every political reason to avoid wading into the discussion of sexual assault that has riled a nation and thrown her Republican rival\u2019s candidacy into chaos. Not known as a naturally emotive public speaker, Mrs. Clinton risks stumbling if she embraces the issue at a time when polls show that she is in her strongest position yet to defeat Mr. Trump on Nov. 8. She has played it safe, all but disappearing from the campaign trail until the next debate in Las Vegas on Wednesday. But then again, two decades ago, it was Mrs. Clinton, who, as a    first lady in a powder pink suit, defied her husband\u2019s West Wing advisers and captured the attention of women worldwide by declaring, \u201cHuman rights are women\u2019s rights, and women\u2019s rights are human rights once and for all. \u201d Last summer, Mrs. Clinton began her campaign by declaring that she wanted to create \u201can America where a father can tell his daughter: \u2018Yes, you can be anything you want to be. Even president of the United States. \u2019\u201d Since then, allegations of sexual harassment have led to the ouster of Roger Ailes as chairman of Fox News college campuses have been shaken by the   jail sentence given to Brock Turner, a former Stanford University student found guilty of sexual assault and women continue to come forward with allegations against Mr. Trump. At the same time, Mrs. Clinton, so close to becoming the first woman to win the White House amid national outrage over reports of her rival\u2019s male lechery, has all but abandoned gender as an issue. On Thursday, Mrs. Clinton appeared to get choked up on the set of \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show\u201d when, during a taping, Ms. DeGeneres played a portion of Mrs. Obama\u2019s speech. But Mrs. Clinton quickly composed herself and, in a remarkable   punt, pivoted to a laundry list of other constituencies whom she said Mr. Trump had offended. \u201cIt\u2019s not just what Trump has said about women, as terrible as that has been,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told Ms. DeGeneres. It\u2019s \u201cwhat he has said about immigrants and   and Latinos and people with disabilities and P. O. W.s and our military and Muslims and everybody. \u201d On Friday, without mentioning the accusations against Mr. Trump, Mrs. Clinton told volunteers in Seattle: \u201cThis election is incredibly painful. I take absolutely no satisfaction in what is happening on the other side with my opponent. \u201d Asked if Mrs. Clinton would be speaking more directly about the issue, Jennifer Palmieri, the campaign\u2019s communications director, noted that Mrs. Clinton had confronted Mr. Trump at the last debate about the recently released 2005 video in which he bragged about groping women. \u201cYou should expect that she\u2019ll continue to do that,\u201d Ms. Palmieri said. Mrs. Clinton has battle wounds from wading into gender in the past. In 1992, she seemed an affront to    mothers when she defended her legal career, saying, \u201cI suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies. \u201d As a working mother in the White House, Mrs. Clinton redefined the role of first lady when she tried, and subsequently failed, to overhaul health care, but she also played the role of a traditional wife when she stayed with Mr. Clinton despite his affair with Monica Lewinsky. In hacked emails released by WikiLeaks this week, Mrs. Clinton was shown in an interview transcript pondering, at length, the many complexities of running to be the first female president. \u201cWhen I ran the last time, the research was pretty clear that there was a resistance to a woman president, not just among Republicans and independents, but among Democrats,\u201d she said in one of the thousands of emails obtained by hackers who illegally breached a top aide\u2019s account. \u201cThey didn\u2019t think a woman was qualified, could do the job, didn\u2019t see a woman as commander in chief,\u201d Mrs. Clinton continued. So, in 2008, she played up her fortitude and tried essentially to run as if she were a man. Eight years later, Mrs. Clinton talks regularly about being a mother and a grandmother, and she doesn\u2019t shy away from embracing her potential to make history. She has also promised that as president she would advance policies that would help women, including doubling the child care tax credit, increasing the minimum wage and pushing for 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave. And yet Mrs. Clinton has found in her second presidential campaign that young women aren\u2019t particularly moved by her promise to make history. Many of them voted instead for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s primary opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Thinking about her current campaign, Mrs. Clinton said in the transcript, \u201cYou know, I mean, I\u2019m damned if I do, I\u2019m damned if I don\u2019t. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563025.4858665}
