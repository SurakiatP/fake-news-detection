Beams will shoot out from each bridge, pierce the sky and then drop, connecting with a beam on a neighboring bridge to trace the path of the Thames. The bridges\u2019s underbellies will glow gently the banks will offer floating stages for performances waterfalls will create a screen for projections a weave of projected light planes will hover over the surface of the Thames, creating a ghostly river of light. These are some of the ideas put forward for what is being called the   permanent public art project that any city has yet undertaken. \u201cIlluminated River\u201d is a hugely ambitious, \u00a320 million ($24. 8 million) plan to light the span of the Thames River from the Albert Bridge in the west to Tower Bridge in the east. (The money will come from private and philanthropic sources, with $12. 6 million already contributed by the Rothschild and the Arcadia foundations.) It aims to transform this part of the Thames into a glowing river of light and spectacle, and is part of the city\u2019s ambition to match other international metropoles with a vibrant nighttime economy. The light project will also draw tourists to the bridges and banks of the Thames, which traces a loose S shape through central London, and has 17 bridges along its trajectory. The river is now \u201ca black snake\u201d through the city at night, Hannah Rothschild, the chairwoman of the Illuminated River Foundation, said at a preview on Monday of a   exhibition of the final proposals. With this project, she added, the transformation will be dramatic: \u201cLight, energy, beauty, commerce, at the flick of a switch,\u201d she said, adding that it was also a meeting point for art, design and technology. The six finalists were chosen from 105 entries, including   architects, designers, engineers and artists of all stripes from all over the world. The winning team will be announced on Dec. 8, and the organizers hope that the project will be started by 2018. Here is a flavor of what they propose for the Thames. The   architect David Adjaye, whose National Museum of African American History and Culture recently opened in Washington, has assembled a   list of international artists for the proposal: Doug Aitken, Jeremy Deller, Cai   Glenn Ligon, Chris Ofili and Philippe Parreno among them. Each was assigned a bridge, resulting in a cornucopia of spectacular light designs that treats each bridge as an individual artwork. The city\u2019s bridges \u201chave always been conceived of purely as infrastructure between north and south, but they actually encapsulate history and ideas about trade, labor, gender and race,\u201d Mr. Adjaye said. \u201cWe really tried to match the narrative of each bridge with each artist\u2019s practice. I decided not to try for a unified vision one of the great things about London is that it\u2019s a medieval mosaic city. These are different artistic and architectural languages that come together to create a whole. \u201d Amanda Levete\u2019s London architecture firm, AL_A, has collaborated with the filmmaker Asif Kapadia and the writer Simon Stephens as well as a team of engineers and sound designers to come up with a subtle project that ties the lighting of the bridges to the natural rhythms of the tides. \u201cThe idea that you can have an impact on the perception of the city without constructing anything was fascinating to me,\u201d Ms. Levete said. \u201cFor us, the essence of the project is to tell a story about the river and how central it is to people\u2019s lives. In the end, it\u2019s a very simple narrative: the tides are a physical manifestation of the shape of the earth and the landmass of the U. K. and we want to reveal this through light. \u201cThe tidal range of the Thames is around 9 meters, the height of a   building, which is very unusual for a river in a city,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe want to illuminate the shoreline as the tide goes out, inviting the public to appropriate that space at low tide. At high tide, the lighting shifts to illuminate the elevation of the bridges and show their structure. \u201cIn the space of two hours, you see the tidal change we want to remind people that their lives play out not in minutes and hours, but in the context of centuries, and the forces of nature,\u201d she said. Light beams play tag in the design by these New   architects, who count the city\u2019s elevated High Line and the Broad Museum in Los Angeles among their projects. Collaborating with the lighting designer Jennifer Tipton, they have created a proposal that includes curtains of falling water as screens for projections, and floating platforms along the riverbanks for performance. \u201cWe came up with the idea of concentrating on the performance of the lighting,\u201d said Elizabeth Diller, a founding partner. \u201cIt starts when the sun goes down as it sets, the bridges start to fill with light, from the embankments towards the center. The moment that a particular degree of darkness arrives, it triggers the \u2018night kiss,\u2019 a vertical light pointed at the sky. This happens in tiny increments because the rotation of the earth means the moment of darkness is about 20 seconds apart from bridge to bridge. There is a pause, then soft white light comes up on each bridge, like a blossom. \u201d \u201cWe\u2019re imagining the moment of the beams going up a bit like the chiming of Big Ben a moment of urban consciousness,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to pay attention to the transition between day and night, and to evoke a collectivity that is missing in our urban lifestyle. \u201d This   lighting firm, working with the artist Federico Pietrella, proposes subtle washes of light over the bridges and along their underbellies, with lights triggered by sunset and sunrise. Different styles of lampposts from around the world would be partly submerged in the water, symbolizing London as a place for international exchange. \u201cWhen you walk along the river, you can see that every borough has its own aesthetic, which is very different to a more homogeneously designed city like Paris,\u201d said Joseph Frey, one of the partners of the firm. \u201cOur first intention is to clean up the light pollution along the Thames path buildings are lit very differently depending on where you are, and we would try to persuade the stakeholders that it\u2019s a question of contrast there is no point spending a lot of energy and money to light the river if it\u2019s not visually readable. \u201cThere is approximately a minute of light difference, when the sun rises or sets, between the outermost bridges we wanted to show the natural rhythms of the day, which of course are totally different in winter or summer,\u201d he said. Sam Jacob, a   architect, and Simon Heijdens, a Dutch artist, have a poetic proposal that embodies the title of \u201cIlluminated River\u201d: a shimmering river of light hovering just above the surface of the Thames, created from light planes that are generated by data readings of the river\u2019s depth, flow and surface tension. \u201cIt was hard to think what you could possibly do on that scale that would respect the variety and detail of the London riverscape and withstand the scale of the city,\u201d Mr. Jacobs said. \u201cLondon is a strange city, it has never been planned and doesn\u2019t have an urban principle, but the river is the one unifying factor. \u201d Mr. Heijdens added: \u201cIt\u2019s such a narrative surface: where you are, what time it is, what the weather is like. But most of that is lost at night when the Thames becomes a black hole. So we created a dimensional weave of light from flows of data from the river that are measured by a small unit on each bridge, and powered by the tides. \u201d The New York light artist Leo Villareal, who created the \u201cBay Lights\u201d installation on San Francisco\u2019s Bay Bridge, has worked with a team of London architects on a straightforward proposal that transforms the river bridges into light sculptures, washed by soft colors that one writer described as turning the Thames into \u201ca giant linear lava lamp. \u201d \u201cWe wanted to create something cohesive to unify the bridges and create a ribbon of light,\u201d Mr. Villareal said. \u201cWe also wanted to create a better atmosphere around the Thames, where there is a lot of commercial lighting, so we have proposals for tuning that light. We would replace much of the current bridge lighting with LED light, which makes it more energy efficient and adds dynamism through light and color. \u201cI sometimes make monochromatic pieces, but here it felt appropriate to use color,\u201d he continued. \u201cAn important element of the project is that it references the light and atmosphere of paintings of the bridges by artists like Turner and Monet. \u201d He added: \u201cLighting the undersides of the bridges is also important working with structure and finding a way to augment what exists is at the heart of this. These kinds of public art gestures are a gift and can be transformative they have the power to bring people together. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563179.25601}
