The previous   were \u201cMatilda the Musical\u201d and \u201cThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the \u201d both hits in London before opening on Broadway. Those shows each won seven Oliviers, which are Britain\u2019s equivalent of the Tony Awards. Jamie Parker took best actor for his portrayal of Harry, while Noma Dumezweni won supporting actress honors as Hermione and Anthony Boyle supporting actor honors as Scorpius. \u201cHarry Potter\u201d also won for best director (the Tony winner John Tiffany) and for its lighting, sound, costumes and set design. The production had tied the record for the most nominations for any show in Oliviers history, with 11. Other winners on Sunday included \u201cGroundhog Day,\u201d which won best new musical and best actor, for Andy Karl \u201cJesus Christ Superstar,\u201d which won for best musical revival and \u201cYerma,\u201d which picked up the prize for best play revival and best actress, for Billie Piper\u2019s performance. \u201cHarry Potter,\u201d a   play that audiences can watch over two days or in a single, marathon day, takes place about two decades after Harry\u2019s years at Hogwarts, as a   Harry ships off his son Albus for his first year at the wizarding academy. J. K. Rowling wrote the story for the play with its playwright, Jack Thorne, and Mr. Tiffany. In going    the show missed only in the categories of theater choreographer, which Matthew Bourne won for his stage adaptation of \u201cThe Red Shoes,\u201d and outstanding achievement in music, which it lost to the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical \u201cSchool of Rock. \u201d In his acceptance speech, Mr. Bourne apologized to \u201cHarry Potter\u201d fans, apparently referring to the fact that he had broken the show\u2019s winning streak. \u201cHarry Potter and the Cursed Child\u201d is running in London and is expected to open at the Lyric Theater on Broadway in the spring of 2018. No casting has been announced. \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d is in preview performances on Broadway.'"}, "time": 1742563140.82984}
