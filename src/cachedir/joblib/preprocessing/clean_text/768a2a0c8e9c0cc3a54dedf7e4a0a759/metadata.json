Mr. Trump, speaking in a   interview in the Oval Office on Wednesday, described the infrastructure package as a   legislative sweetener that he could attach to a revived Affordable Care Act repeal bill or tax code overhaul to attract bipartisan support that thus far he had neither sought nor received. \u201cInfrastructure is so popular that I might want to use it for another bill,\u201d said Mr. Trump, who is in need of a legislative win after the humbling defeat of his health care bill last month. \u201cInfrastructure is so popular with the Democrats and pretty popular with the Republicans. A lot of Republicans want infrastructure, too. \u201d The president, who inherited and expanded a family fortune built on   and   real estate development, has proposed eliminating an   infrastructure program that would have funded   proposals to build a new train tunnel under the Hudson River between New York and New Jersey, and extend the Second Avenue subway in Manhattan north to East Harlem. State and city leaders say both projects are essential: The subway line is needed to alleviate congestion on Manhattan\u2019s East Side, and the tunnel is needed to improve deteriorating rail service in the heavily trafficked Eastern corridor and provide a new conduit for freight in the event of a natural disaster like Hurricane Sandy in 2012. As Mr. Trump discussed his plan, hundreds of thousands of commuters endured a third day of upheaval prompted by a minor derailment at Pennsylvania Station, another reminder of the decrepit, tenuous state of much of the region\u2019s infrastructure and transit systems. Mr. Trump said he planned to examine both New York projects and submit them to an   unformed \u201ccommission\u201d headed by Richard LeFrak, a fellow scion of a prominent Queens real estate family, and Steven Roth, the chairman of the New   Vornado Realty Trust. \u201cWell, I may support them,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI\u2019m going to look at them. \u201d \u201cI did great in real estate in New York,\u201d he added. \u201cI know all the developers. I know all of the folks. I know the good ones and the bad ones. And I\u2019m setting up a commission of very smart people that know how to spend money properly. That know how to build on time, on budget. And ideally, under time and under budget. \u201d New York leaders were not impressed. \u201cWelcome to the party,\u201d said Dani Lever, a spokeswoman for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. \u201cThe governor has been saying that we need to rebuild our airports for years, but unlike Washington, we aren\u2019t just talking about needed improvements we are already in the process of rebuilding them. This is exactly why the federal government needs to follow through on its promise to fund infrastructure projects. \u201d Mitchell Moss, the director of New York University\u2019s Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management, predicted that Mr. Trump, spurred on by his daughter Ivanka and    Jared Kushner, would eventually come through for the city. \u201c   is a nice place to golf, but New York is where Donald Trump grew up, and it\u2019s where he will return,\u201d Mr. Moss said, referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s Florida resort. \u201cAt the end of the day, Donald, Ivanka and Jared are going to come back here, and they know the city needs a   infrastructure. \u201d It is not that the president thinks the city is not in need. \u201cI think it\u2019s in poor shape,\u201d he said of New York\u2019s infrastructure. \u201cThe highways are in poor shape. \u201d \u201cI think the airports are a horror show,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ve traveled the world, I know the world. \u201d Mr. Trump, whose knowledge of complex policy issues can sometimes be lacking, then offered a scathing critique of the bent and battered metal median guards on the Van Wyck Expressway not far from his childhood home in Queens. \u201cWhoever the person is that owns that company is a genius salesman,\u201d he said, as his aides  \u2014   who wanted to talk about their bigger plans  \u2014   grew restless in their carved armchairs. \u201cThat is the worst garbage. I think it bends by the heat, because not that many cars could possibly hit it. It\u2019s the worst garbage. And I also think it\u2019s dangerous because it\u2019s a spear. And if you hit those things, they come flying apart. And if you\u2019re driving, you\u2019ve got yourself a problem. \u201d Mr. Trump confessed that he had not personally driven in a while, and that it had been years since he had ridden the subway. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time. It\u2019s been a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cI know the subway system very well. I used to take it to   School, in Forest Hills, when I lived in Queens. And I\u2019d take the subway to school. Seems a long time ago. I\u2019d take it from Jamaica, 179th Street. Jamaica, right? To Forest Hills. I understand the subway very well. I used to ride between the cars. \u201d Referring to his parents, he added, \u201cThey weren\u2019t thrilled when they heard that. \u201d Mr. Trump, at the advice of Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Vice President Mike Pence, had intended to tackle health care first  \u2014   gaining hundreds of billions of dollars in cost savings  \u2014   that would then be rolled into an ambitious tax cut package. Infrastructure, according to Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao and other top administration officials, was something the administration would handle when the other two bills were passed. But the health care debacle has scuttled the president\u2019s plans, and he is considering merging one or all of the proposals in the hopes of cobbling together a coalition. The idea of merging a big infrastructure plan with a tax proposal is not new: Shortly after taking office in 2009, President Barack Obama proposed a similar idea  \u2014   and his stimulus package included more than $300 billion in tax breaks intended to spur infrastructure and capital investments to stimulate growth. Mr. Trump is confident he will attract Democratic support  \u2014   even though he has not spoken with the minority leader, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, for weeks. He said Democrats were \u201cdesperate for infrastructure  \u2014   that\u2019s the thing that they want. \u201d Mr. Schumer said he was eager to start negotiations but not especially hopeful. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t put out anything specific yet,\u201d the senator said. The president, surrounded by staff members including Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, and Reed Cordish, an assistant to Mr. Trump  \u2014   refused to say how much direct public funding would be included in his proposal. A senior administration official directly involved in drafting the plan said that number would be in the $200 billion to $300 billion range over the next decade, with the balance of the package paid for by tax credits. Mr. Schumer and many congressional Democrats say they will never agree to such large tax breaks for developers and builders, despite the president\u2019s claim that they will fold. And even as Mr. Trump trumpeted the curative political tonic of the infrastructure bill, his aides were on hand to remind him that they had their own priorities, too. \u201cHe\u2019s spending an enormous amount of time on trade and taxes,\u201d Mr. Cohn said, interrupting the talk of trains, planes and automobiles. \u201cThose are two big areas. \u201d A few minutes later, Mr. Cohn  \u2014   who is ascendant in Mr. Trump\u2019s circle  \u2014   let out a colossal sneeze. Perhaps that is why the president paid such close attention to Mr. Cohn\u2019s physical  . \u201cGod bless you. You O. K. Gary?\u201d the president said. \u201cThat was a pretty tough one. I\u2019ve got to make sure my man is all right. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628601.0597034}
