Locals described substantial fighting. \\nThis has been a recurring feature in the battle over Aleppo since 2012, but particularly over the past several months, with each side getting a sizeable advantage only to lose it to a sudden counterattack from the other, leaving the civilian population trapped within. \\nOver the past few weeks, however, it had seemed like Aleppo was really going to be reunified by the military, with Nusra forces on their heels and Russia feeling confident enough to put their airstrikes on hold. Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered the ceasefire to continue, despite calls from the military to resume attacks. \\nExactly how far the latest offensive has gotten is a major of debate, with Nusra claiming they\u2019d captured a suburb that amounts to the whole southwestern corner of Aleppo, and government officials denying that they\u2019d lost anywhere near so much. As usual, it will take some time for this to shake out and become clear what territory changed hands. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz'"}, "time": 1742563347.4301207}
