What\u2019s going on? It\u2019s not clear.\u2019 \\nHe also claimed that the case highlighted \u2018the dissolution of traditional national values\u2019 adding: \u2018A society that cannot defend its children has no future.\u2019 \\nAnd Putin\u2019s words appeared to have struck a chord, as he is extremely popular with Serbs. \\nIn the rape case, the boy had arrived in Austria with his Serbian mother, who paid for him to go to the Theresienbad swimming pool, where he was violently attacked. \\nThe boy was so badly injured that he needed hospital treatment but he will be forced to go back to court for the Iraqi man\u2019s second trial, outraging the Austrian Serbian community. \\nAustrian media say the case has hardened the communities position against asylum seekers, who were previously divided about whether to vote for the left-leaning Green party candidate or the far right option Nobert Hofer in upcoming elections. \\nHowever, it is not the first time Russia has lashed out at the EU\u2019s handling of the migrant crisis. \\nIn March, Konstantin Romodanovsky, head of Russia\u2019s Federal Migration Service accused leaders of willfully ignoring cultural differences that have caused such widespread friction and chaos across the Continent. \\nHe also added that \u2018multiculturalism has failed\u2019 because Europe never formed a unified strategy to integrate refugees into Western society. \\nHe said: \u2018The European Commission left it up to individual nations to decide how they want to treat asylum seekers\u2013despite the fact the policies and capabilities of member states are very different. \\nRomodanovsky also accused EU countries of ignoring the \u2018differences in culture, religious traditions, and customs\u2019 with the refugees, the vast majority of whom are Islamic.'"}, "time": 1742562323.4871485}
