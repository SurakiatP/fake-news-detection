He was in so much pain, he committed suicide in the parking lot after they threw him out because he knew that the system had failed him. He sat in his car and ended his life. Now the hospital is denying that he even showed up\u2026 After serving in the Navy from 1958 to 1962, Peter A. Kaisen shot and killed himself in the parking lot outside the Northport Veterans Affairs Medical Center on August 21. His reason? The hospital had allegedly denied him care even though he was a recurring patient who always paid his bills on time. Now his family and friends are outraged that the VA failed their beloved Peter. They pray that his death could help make the system better. Scroll down to learn more about how the VA failed this man\u2026 \u201cHe went there for help with depression,\u201d Thomas Farley, a friend of Kaisen\u2019s for 40 years, told Fox News. \u201cThat was his last hope, and he didn\u2019t get any help.\u201d After Kaisen served in the Navy, he joined the police force as an officer in the Long Beach Police Department. But in the 1960s, he got involved in a car crash. Injuries from the accident left him permanently disabled. And for the rest of his life he required constant medication and care. Sources told The New York Times that Kaisen was upset with the VA hospital. They had not allowed him to see an emergency room physician for a mental health condition \u2013 so he ended his life. \u201cHe went to the E.R. and was denied service,\u201d one person who currently works at the hospital, told the paper. \u201cAnd then he went to his car and shot himself.\u201d \u201cSomeone dropped the ball,\u201d the source said. \u201cThey should not have turned him away.\u201d Kaisen\u2019s family prays that his death will make VA services better. \u201cMaybe he can be used as an example to make things better,\u201d Farley, speaking on behalf of the family, said. \u201cMaybe we can save someone else\u2019s life.\u201d \u201cThat way, he would not have died in vain,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, the VA hospital denies that Kaisen came to their hospital before killing himself. Over the last two years, reports about issues with VA hospitals have surfaced. These included rejected medical claims, delays in treatments, numerous deaths of veterans when treatment is delayed, and fraudulent bookkeeping to hide the VA\u2019s shortcomings so the executive can still qualify for their bonuses. A recent investigation by Republican Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma found that more than 1,000 veterans over the last decade have died while waiting for medical treatment. Farley, Kaisen\u2019s long-time friend, is heartbroken by the man\u2019s suicide. \u201cI\u2019m a Vietnam vet \u2014 disabled from Agent Orange \u2014 and he was always looking out for me. He was such a faithful guy,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was such a big advocate for veterans and that\u2019s what makes it\u2019s so sad.\u201d Do you think the VA needs to offer better services to veterans?
