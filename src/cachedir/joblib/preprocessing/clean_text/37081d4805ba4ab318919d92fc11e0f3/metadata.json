In the   essay, which was published online Thursday and will appear in the September print magazine, the president argued that \u201cwhen everybody is equal, we are all more free. \u201d He praised the progress of American women over the past century while pledging to work on securing equal pay and reproductive rights. The president also warned against \u201cdated assumptions about gender roles. \u201d The president said that it was important to his daughters that he be a feminist, \u201cbecause now that\u2019s what they expect of all men. \u201d \u201cWe need to keep changing the attitude that raises our girls to be demure and our boys to be assertive, that criticizes our daughters for speaking out and our sons for shedding a tear,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe need to keep changing the attitude that punishes women for their sexuality and rewards men for theirs. \u201cWe need to keep changing the attitude that permits the routine harassment of women, whether they\u2019re walking down the street or daring to go online. We need to keep changing the attitude that teaches men to feel threatened by the presence and success of women. \u201d Brenda Weber, the professor and the chairwoman of the gender studies department at Indiana University, said she was \u201cdelighted\u201d by the essay, which she said showed a nuanced sense of women\u2019s issues. It is unusual for a man to write such an essay, let alone a president, she said. To claim the identity of feminism and discuss why it is personally important to him and his daughters is a meaningful gesture coming from someone with the cultural authority of the president, she said. \u201cThose are all pretty radical statements in terms of a politician at that level of influence,\u201d she said. It is not the first time that the president has declared himself a feminist. In June, while speaking at a White House summit meeting on women, he declared: \u201cThis is what a feminist looks like. \u201d Cindi Leive, the editor of Glamour, said on \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d that she thought the essay went \u201cbeyond the kind of boilerplate \u2018I believe in strong women\u2019 that at this point anybody can mouth pretty effectively. \u201d \u201cIt did strike me as this very modern moment, something that we wouldn\u2019t have heard probably from any other president, but honestly we would not have heard before this year,\u201d she said. \u201cI do think the embrace of the term feminism by men as well as women has really been on the rise. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562242.742202}
