[In a press conference to announce the legislation, Hayden thanked Michael   Moms Demand Action for their \u201corganizing power. \u201d  The text of the bill says: This act may be cited as the \u201cTaylor Hayden Gun Violence Prevention Act. \u201d To reduce the number of injuries and deaths of innocent individuals in the community and to increase community safety, the commissioner of human services shall develop a competitive bidding process to award grants to nonprofit organizations with expertise in gun violence prevention. A nonprofit organization awarded a grant must use the money for gun violence prevention or public awareness and education campaigns on gun violence prevention. Hayden explained that his push to use Minnesotans\u2019 tax dollars for gun control is the result of the death of his sister, Taylor Hayden, who was killed in a suspected drug deal gone bad in Atlanta, Georgia. Hayden explained that Taylor was out with friends in July 2016 \u201cfor some dancing and fun. \u201d He said, \u201cAs they were leaving the place where they had eaten and were having fun, gunfire erupted between two parties that were apparently having a problem. \u201d During the exchange of gunfire, someone grabbed Hayden\u2019s sister and used her \u201cas a human shield. \u201d She was shot twice and killed. Hayden said his sister \u201crepresented everything that we want our children to represent\u201d and he wants to fund gun control in Minnesota to help with \u201cgun violence prevention and outreach. \u201d He said gun violence is \u201ca public health crisis\u201d and he believes it is fitting to designate tax payer dollars \u201cto get people to understand what happens when you use a gun. \u201d AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.
