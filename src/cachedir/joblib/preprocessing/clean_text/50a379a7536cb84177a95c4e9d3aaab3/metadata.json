He went on to describe the festivities as depraved, lewd and based on the \u201cblasphemous idea\u201d that Allah had an equal in Jesus.[ \u201cIsa (Jesus) may he rest in peace, is a prophet like all the others,\u201d Almeqdesi told Breitbart Jerusalem \u201cand in Islam we don\u2019t discriminate between prophets for they are all the messengers of Allah, but the claim that Jesus is a deity represents a heresy that ought to be stamped out in Islamic states. \u201d   \u201cThose Christians who pay the jizya  \u2014   the poll tax  \u2014   and refrain from practicing these blasphemous celebrations should be given the security they deserve. But if somewhere there are Christians who insist on celebrating Christmas with the support of the heretic authorities, one must unleash upon them all one\u2019s might and deploy all the available means. \u201d Asked what he means by that, Almeqdesi said that \u201call methods are admissible when it comes to preventing blasphemy against Allah and his commandments. Yes, including killing and blowing up. But, like I said, we believe that at first you should act politely and explain that living in Islamic countries is conditioned on accepting the Sharia and refrain from openly practicing  rituals other than Islam. \u201d  Asked whether Christians should be allowed to enjoy alcoholic drinks in the privacy of their homes during the holiday, Almeqdesi replied in the negative, \u201cas the alcohol was bought somewhere, whereas selling it and consuming it is forbidden, so you can\u2019t drink it. Whoever\u2019s caught breaking this law will be whipped and jailed. \u201d  Almeqdesi said the recent terror attacks in Jordan, Turkey and Germany \u201care part of the price these states must pay for positioning themselves as part of the Crusader Coalition of the infidel countries fighting against Islam. \u201d  Almeqdesi added that the Islamic State\u2019s claiming responsibility for the recent terrorist attacks in Jordan and Berlin \u201cwas only to be expected seeing as the organization\u2019s leadership pledged to punish all the states that form the coalition against it. While the attacks on Islamic states are ongoing, so will be the (terror) activity of our mujahideen brothers. \u201d     '"}, "time": 1742628390.7170947}
