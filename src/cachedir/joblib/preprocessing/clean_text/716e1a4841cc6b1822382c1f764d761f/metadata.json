[After the messages from a number of \u201cnotorious hate preachers\u201d became public on Friday, Mr. Wilders took to Twitter to slam their intervention in the Dutch election process. Retweeting a scan of an article in Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf, Mr Wilders wrote: \u201cCan those imams of hate, and Denk too, not bugger off for Allah\u2019s sake to some Muslim country? \u201d.  Kunnen die haatimams niet samen met Denk omwille van Allah optiefen naar een of ander islamitisch land? https:  .   \u2014   Geert Wilders (@geertwilderspvv) March 4, 2017,  Political party Denk, which presently two members of parliament  \u2014   Turkish origin Tunahan Kuzu and Sel\u00e7uk \u00d6zt\u00fcrk  \u2014   is the first by migrants, for migrants political party in Europe. The party\u2019s policies include the wholesale renaming of streets to erase the Netherland\u2019s colonial history, the establishment of a   strong \u2018  police\u2019 and the establishment of a hate criminal register, similar to a sex offender\u2019s register. Similar plans have been recently mooted in the United Kingdom. Although the party has been accused of being a mouthpiece in the Netherlands for the Turkish government, they hope to gather growing support from the estimated one million migrants living in the European country, out of a total population of just 17 million. The latest controversy surrounding the party comes after \u201cinfamous hate preachers\u201d including imams Fawaz Jneid and Suhayb Salam calling on their worshippers to vote for the party. De Telegraaf reports imam Salam, who has seen a number of his congregation travel to Syria to wage jihad, favours Denk because they campaign for Muslim rights. He is reported to have said: \u201cIt is important that we [come together] for this party, and to warn against the current ruling parties, who have made it very difficult for Muslims in recent years  \u2026     Take your parents and friends to the polls, for the sake of Allah\u201d. Hate preacher Fawaz Jneid who came into the public eye after the assassination of filmmaker Theo van Gogh  \u2014   a man he had preached against  \u2014   said of Denk that because there aren\u2019t enough Muslims in the Netherlands, it was important for them to come together and vote as a bloc for a single party, in a Facebook video for his followers. According to present projections and polls Mr Wilders\u2019 PVV is expected to achieve 25 seats in the Dutch parliament, and so become the largest party. Denk is on course to keep their two with no gains.  '"}, "time": 1742561932.0020404}
