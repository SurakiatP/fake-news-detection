The plaintiff, Capt. Nathan Michael Smith, an intelligence officer stationed in Kuwait, voiced strong support for fighting the Islamic State but, citing his \u201cconscience\u201d and his vow to uphold the Constitution, he said he believed that the mission lacked proper authorization from Congress. \u201cTo honor my oath, I am asking the court to tell the president that he must get proper authority from Congress, under the War Powers Resolution, to wage the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria,\u201d he wrote. The legal challenge comes after the death of the third American service member fighting the Islamic State and as Mr. Obama has decided to significantly expand the number of Special Operations ground troops he has deployed to Syria aid rebels there. Mr. Obama has argued that he already has the authority he needs to wage the conflict against the Islamic State under the authorization to fight the perpetrators of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, enacted by Congress shortly after the attacks. That argument is controversial because the Islamic State is at odds with the leadership of Al Qaeda and its affiliate in Syria, the Nusra Front. Critics contend that the administration is stretching the Sept. 11 authorization too far by applying it to an organization that did not exist in 2001 and that operates far from Afghanistan. The administration has countered that its position is legitimate because the Islamic State used to be a Qaeda affiliate in Iraq during the Iraq war. In an April 2015 speech, Stephen Preston, then the top Pentagon lawyer, argued that the fact that Al Qaeda splintered after the death of Osama bin Laden did not mean that the authority to keep fighting each successor faction came to an end. Administration officials have also said the fight against the Islamic State is covered separately by the 2002 authorization President George W. Bush obtained from Congress for the invasion of Iraq, although they are not relying on it. The administration has asked Congress to enact new authorization for using military force against the Islamic State, but lawmakers have not acted on that request. They have, however, passed military appropriations bills that earmark funds for the effort against the Islamic State, which could suggest that lawmakers have acquiesced to the executive branch\u2019s theory. Captain Smith\u2019s lawyers are David Remes, who has represented many Guant\u00e1namo detainees in habeas corpus lawsuits, and Bruce Ackerman, a Yale Law School professor who published a column in The Atlantic last year arguing that the war against ISIS was illegal and that a serviceman ordered to fight in it would have standing to challenge it in court. \u201cWe want to get this back on the agenda,\u201d said Mr. Ackerman, calling the precedent Mr. Obama is setting a \u201cturning point\u201d for whether constitutional checks and balances on a president\u2019s ability to initiate a new war at his own discretion will survive. Current and former administration officials have said that in 2014, when confronted by the Islamic State\u2019s rapid conquest of Iraqi territory, Mr. Obama\u2019s advisers presented him with a choice: he could say that bombing ISIS was part of the existing war, or he could say it was a new war. Each theory, they told him, was defensible, but each had its own downsides. Mr. Obama decided to go with the first one  \u2014   that the Islamic State campaign was part of the existing  . 11 war  \u2014   because he believed that immediate intervention was necessary to halt a disaster but that the   House of Representatives was too dysfunctional to vote on any war authorization within 60 days. That was important because the War Power Resolution, a   law, says presidents must withdraw deployments into \u201chostilities\u201d after 60 days if Congress has not authorized the operation to continue. In 2011, Mr. Obama\u2019s air war intervention in Libya, which lasted longer than 60 days without congressional authorization, prompted criticism  inside and outside the administration. Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard Law School professor who has criticized the administration\u2019s use of the 2001 war authorization to cover the Islamic State but is not involved in the suit, said the case was significant because it could overcome a major hurdle to getting a court to review that theory. But Mr. Goldsmith said Captain Smith faced many other hurdles, including precedents that suggest that when Congress appropriates money for a conflict it has implicitly authorized it. He also predicted that if a court did rule that the conflict was illegal, Congress would authorize the fight to continue  \u2014   perhaps giving it broader scope than Mr. Obama has wanted. \u201cWe\u2019re in a terrible equilibrium where Congress doesn\u2019t want to step up and play its part in this military campaign and so the president has basically gone forward and done what he thinks he needs to do,\u201d Mr. Goldsmith said. \u201cIt would be a lot better for everyone, including the president, if Congress got more involved. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562754.253621}
