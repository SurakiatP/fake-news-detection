John McCain ( ) added his voice to the chorus of alarm Tuesday in the wake of a New York Times report on an alleged memo from   Director James Comey. [\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this movie before,\u201d McCain told CBS News\u2019s Bob Schieffer. \u201cI think it\u2019s reaching the point where it\u2019s of Watergate size and scale  \u2026     it\u2019s a centipede that the shoe continues to drop. \u201d   \u201cEvery couple of days, there\u2019s a new aspect of this really unhappy situation  \u2026     None of us, no matter what our political leanings are, no matter how we feel about Trump, feel this is not good for America,\u201d McCain added. The comments are the harshest yet from the GOP side of the aisle and come as some Democrats are openly calling for President Donald Trump impeachment over the \u201cComey Memo. \u201d Rep. Al Green ( ) did so on the House floor Tuesday morning. McCain\u2019s comments add to rumblings among certain other Republicans on Capitol Hill who have signaled their willingness to abandon Trump over the allegations in Comey\u2019s memo and reports of discussion of classified information with Russian diplomats. The Hill reported Wednesday that the Comey Memo was causing more GOPers to try and detach their legislative agenda from the president. McCain has been a proponent of the Russian   narrative, and a central figure in Senate hearings on the issue. He expressed his dismay over President Trump\u2019s decision to dismiss Comey last week. The   senator and 2008 GOP nominee for president has been a pillar of   Republicans since shortly after Trump\u2019s announcement in 2015 when the two became embroiled in a controversy over Trump\u2019s comment on McCain\u2019s time as a Vietnam POW. \u201cNever Trump\u201d commentator Bill Kristol even called for McCain to intervene as an independent candidate on the eve of the 2016 Republican National Convention. McCain\u2019s opposition to Russia\u2019s foreign policy ambitions, dating back to the Cold War era, has played a central role in his political career. In his 2008 bid for the presidency, McCain famously wrote that \u201cwe are all Georgians\u201d in advocating a stronger American response to the contemporaneous Russian military intervention in the small Caucasian state. He similarly called for the United States to provide military aid to Ukraine in 2014. Although he stopped well short of calling for impeachment or resignation, the ultimate fate of President Richard Nixon in the 1970s scandal he referenced, McCain\u2019s appraisal of the situation fits neatly into an emerging mainstream media narrative that Trump\u2019s actions rise to an equivalent level.'"}, "time": 1742563839.9139812}
