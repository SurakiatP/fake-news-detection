This is huge damage to Russia. g] \\nIn a John Pilger Special, to be exclusively broadcast by RT on Saturday courtesy of Dartmouth Films, whistleblower Julian Assange categorically denied that the troves of US Democratic Party and Clinton work and staff emails released this year have come from the Russian government. \\n\u201cThe Clinton camp has been able to project a neo-McCarthyist hysteria that Russia is responsible for everything. Hillary Clinton has stated multiple times, falsely, that 17 US intelligence agencies had assessed that Russia was the source of our publications. That\u2019s false \u2013 we can say that the Russian government is not the source,\u201d Assange told the veteran Australian broadcaster as part of a 25-minute John Pilger Special, courtesy of Dartmouth Films. \\nAssange, who spoke with Pilger at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he has been for four years, also accused the US presidential candidate of being a pawn of behind-the-scenes interests, and voiced doubts about her physical fitness to take charge of the White House. Assange claims \u2018crazed\u2019 Clinton campaign tried to hack WikiLeaks \\n\u201cHillary Clinton is just one person. I actually feel quite sorry for Hillary Clinton as a person, because I see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions, tormented literally to the point where they become sick \u2013 for example faint \u2013 as a result of going on, and going with their ambitions. But she represents a whole network of people, and a whole network of relationships with particular states.\u201d \\nOver the past nine months, WikiLeaks uploaded over 30,000 emails from Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server, while she was Secretary of State. This was followed by nearly 20,000 emails sent to and by members of the US Democratic National Committee, exposing the party leadership\u2019s dismissive attitude to Bernie Sanders, and his outsider primaries campaign. \\nFinally, last month, WikiLeaks posted over 50,000 emails connected to John Podesta, Bill Clinton\u2019s chief of staff, and a close associate of the current presidential frontrunner. \\nThe Homeland Security Department and Office of the Director of National Intelligence posted a joint statement in October, claiming they were \u201cconfident\u201d that the Russian government \u201cdirected\u201d this year\u2019s leaks. \\nMoscow has rejected the accusation, with presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov calling the claims \u201cnonsense,\u201d while Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the \u201cpublic bickering with Russia\u201d before the US election is probably a \u201csmokescreen\u201d to draw the voters\u2019 attention away from serious domestic issues.
