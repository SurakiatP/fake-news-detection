The 44th President of the United States made the point that presidents require a larger degree of self-control than what Trump has shown throughout the election cycle. \\n\u201cIn the last two days, they had so little confidence in his self control, they said: \u2018We\u2019re just going to take away your Twitter.\u2019 Now, if somebody cant handle a Twitter account, they can\u2019t handle the nuclear code,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIf somebody starts tweeting at three in the morning \u2019cause SNL made fun of you, then you can\u2019t handle the nuclear code.\u201d \\nThe New York Times recently reported that Trump now has all of his tweets pre-screened by campaign staffers like Hope Hicks, who handles media relations for the Trump campaign. The billionaire real estate developer\u2019s days of tweeting tirades at former beauty pageant stars are over, for the time being, with his campaign aides working overtime to keep the candidate on message in the remaining 48 hours before Americans cast their ballots on Tuesday. \\nWatch video of Obama\u2019s mocking of Trump in Kissimmee, Florida below: \\nFlorida is a contentious, must-win state for both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. The latest polling average from RealClearPolitics shows Clinton with a paper-thin 0.9 percent advantage over Trump. \\n\\nZach Cartwright is an activist and author from Richmond, Virginia.
