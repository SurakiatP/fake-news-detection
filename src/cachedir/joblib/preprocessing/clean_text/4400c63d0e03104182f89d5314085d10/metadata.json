It was the first time an acting spy chief has given a newspaper interview in the agency\u2019s 107-year history, and the subject matter important enough to prompt such an atypical occurrence was hardly a surprising one \u2014 Russia.\\nOr, more accurately, Russia as the big bad enemy.\\n\u201cRussia increasingly seems to define itself by opposition to the west and seems to act accordingly,\u201d MI5 chief Andrew Parker told the Guardian . \u201cYou can see that on the ground with Russia\u2019s activities in Ukraine and Syria. But there is high-volume activity out of sight with the cyber-threat.\u201d \\n\u201cRussia has been a covert threat for decades,\u201d he continued. Then, evoking the U.S. election hacking hype, he added, \u201cWhat\u2019s different these days is that there are more and more methods available.\u201d \\nAnd according to Parker, Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia is utilizing these methods in \u201cincreasingly aggressive ways\u201d to project its global influence:\\n\u201cIt is using its wide range of state organs and powers to push its foreign policy abroad in increasingly aggressive ways \u2014 involving propaganda, espionage, subversion and cyber-attacks. Russia is at work across Europe and in the U.K. today.\u201d \\nThe Kremlin was quick to issue a response to the Parker interview, one the Guardian detailed in a follow-up piece .\\n\u201cThose words do not correspond to reality,\u201d spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said flatly. With regard to alleged U.S. election tampering, he added, \u201cUntil someone produces proof, we will consider those statements unfounded and groundless.\u201d \\nRussia\u2019s embassy in London, meanwhile, stated on Twitter it was \u201csaddened to see a professional trapped to [sic] his own propaganda-created world.\u201d Accompanying that tweet was the movie poster for the 1966 film The Russians are Coming, the Russians are Coming .\\nIn the buildup to the U.S. presidential election on November 8 \u2014 and as Russian submarines are spotted off the British coast \u2014 Western nations are again amping up the anti-Russian narrative .\\nOn October 7, for instance, the United States officially accused Russia of attempting to intervene in the U.S. political system. Then, just days ago, Western member countries of the G7 alliance agreed that continued sanctions against Russia for its role in Ukraine and Syria were \u201cvital.\u201d \\nFor his part, Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s response to such recriminations has been largely one of amusement, as demonstrated by comments he made last week.\\nWhile speaking to foreign policy experts in Sochi, Putin dismissed the \u201chysteria about Russia\u2019s influence on the U.S. presidential election,\u201d adding the \u201cmythical and fictitious\u201d issue has been used to distract the American voter from real problems facing the United States government.\\n\u201cDoes anyone seriously think Russia can somehow influence the American people\u2019s choice?\u201d Putin asked. \u201cIs America some kind of banana republic? America is a great power!\u201d \\nA great power, the Russian president made certain to note, with a top notch propaganda arm:\\n\u201cI would like to have such propaganda machine in Russia, but, regrettably, there is no such thing,\u201d Putin said, touching on the bought and paid for nature of Western corporate media. \u201cWe don\u2019t have such global media as CNN, BBC and others.\u201d Delivered by The Daily Sheeple \\nWe encourage you to share and republish our reports, analyses, breaking news and videos ( Click for details ). \\nContributed by The Anti-Media of theantimedia.org . \\nThe \u201cAnti\u201d in our name does not mean we are against the media, we are simply against the current mainstream paradigm. The current media, influenced by the industrial complex, is a top-down authoritarian system of distribution\u2014the opposite of what Anti-Media aims to be. At Anti-Media, we want to offer a new paradigm\u2014a bottom-up approach for real and diverse reporting. We seek to establish a space where the people are the journalists and a venue where independent journalism moves forward on a larger and more truthful scale. '"}, "time": 1742561835.873226}
