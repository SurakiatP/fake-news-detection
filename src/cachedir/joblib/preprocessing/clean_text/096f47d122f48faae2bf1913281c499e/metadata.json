Protesting students went on to march through the Berkeley Student Union, chanting and disrupting students who are studying.\\nOne student, who was not a part of the protest, tells the video-maker that the demonstrators are \u201cbeing quite childish.\u201d\\n\u201cI agree with the right to protest, but disrupting the peace of others is not OK,\u201d he says. \\nThe group later occupies the school store, chanting \u201cStudents Over Profits!\u201d They place an \u201ceviction notice\u201d on the store, which claims the university \u201cwrongly allocated this two-story facility to third-party corporations, keeping in line with its intensifying legacy of prioritizing financial profit over student needs.\u201d\\nDemonstrators finally made their way to an intersection in front of campus, where students blocked traffic and chanted, \u201cWhose university? Our university!\u201d \\nFollow WE ARE CHANGE on SOCIAL MEDIA SnapChat: LukeWeAreChange \\nfbook: https://facebook.com/LukeWeAreChange \\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Lukewearechange I nstagram: http://instagram.com/lukewearechange Sign up become a patron and Show your support for alternative news for Just 1$ a month you can help Grow We are change We use Bitcoin Too ! 12HdLgeeuA87t2JU8m4tbRo247Yj5u2TVP Join and Up Vote Our STEEMIT The post Students at the University of California, Berkeley held a protest on Friday to demand the creation of additional \u201csafe spaces\u201d appeared first on We Are Change .\\n'"}, "time": 1742563618.4962897}
