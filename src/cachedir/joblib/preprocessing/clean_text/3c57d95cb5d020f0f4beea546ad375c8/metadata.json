With clear derision for regulators and the public itself, he tweeted that lawmakers were \u201cimbeciles\u201d after he testified. \\nThen Mylan jacked the price of its EpiPen, an emergency allergy treatment that saves lives, to $600 up from $100 almost overnight this summer. After public uproar, Mylan offered EpiPen cost breaks to low-income people\u2014a common Pharma ruse that simply shifts costs to others while letting Pharma keep its prices. \\nAnd even as U.S. Pharma companies profiteer on older drugs like Daraprim (and newer drugs like the hepatitis C drug Sovaldi, which costs $84,000 for a course of treatment), they try to duck U.S. taxes with overseas partnerships and incorporations. The same taxes that fund their drugs in Medicare, TRICARE, the VA and other U.S. entitlement programs. \\nPharma may be becoming one of the public\u2019s most reviled sectors but the U.S. government is in the process of erasing the few regulatory firewalls that have existed and tolerating alarming conflicts of interest. \\nExhibit A is the nomination and confirmation earlier this year of Robert Califf as FDA commissioner despite financial links to 23 Pharma companies, including Johnson & Johnson, Lilly, Merck, Schering Plough and GSK, according to a statement on the website of Duke Clinical Research Institute which he directed. In disclosure information for an article in Circulation, Califf also lists financial links to Gambro, Regeneron, Gilead, AstraZeneca, Roche and other companies and equity positions in four medical companies. Califf \u201cserved as a director, officer, partner, employee, advisor, consultant or trustee for Genentech,\u201d said the Medscape website. This is an FDA commissioner? \\nIn the past, someone so heavily funded by industry would not be considered for a government position regulating that very industry. Yet on PBS, Califf saw no problem with doctors and researchers receiving Pharma money and actually thought it desirable. \u201cMany of us consult with the pharmaceutical industry, which I think is a very good thing,\u201d he told host Susan Dentzer. \u201cThey need ideas and then the decision about what they do is really up to the person who is funding the study,\u201d he said. \\nCaliff was an early cheerleader for the blood thinning drug Xarelto, which is now linked to at least 500 deaths and possible high level medical deception. \\nNIMH and NIDA also turn toward industry \\nOther branches of government are also tilting toward Pharma. In a recent editorial, John Markowitz, professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia, lamented that at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), under the leadership of recently departed director Thomas Insel, translational research (which tends to be Pharma focused) \u201chas become virtually required for funding\u201d with almost no clinical, non-drug research funded. \\nInsel, an early proponent of SSRI antidepressants (which he said \u201csoothed people\u2019s symptoms within weeks, much faster than standard psychotherapy\u201d), left government to work at a billion dollar, semi-secret private venture between Google and Pharma last year. The CEO of the new Google life sciences venture is former Genentech chairman Art Levinson. As NIMH director while national alarm about toddlers on stimulant drugs was growing, Insel protested \u201cunder treatment\u201d of children with ADHD drugs. \\nFinally, even as drug addiction, especially to opioids, becomes a leading cause of death in the U.S., Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), is looking to Pharma to find a \u201cvaccine\u201d for drug addiction. Shouldn\u2019t Volkow know, as head of the institute, there is no \u201ccure\u201d or vaccine for addiction\u2014that it is is widely viewed as a physical, psychological and spiritual disease? Has she ever talked to Michael Botticelli, director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, for example, who, as an addict himself, advocates non-drug, non-Pharma, peer treatment for addiction? (And shouldn\u2019t NIDA replace \u201cdrug abuse\u201d with the non-judgmental \u201caddiction\u201d?) \\nVolkow and Insel \u2018s love of industry has also caused them to conduct disturbing animal experiments reminiscent of the noir researcher Henry Harlow. The medical establishment is increasingly reconsidering such invasive and unnecessarily cruel research. \\nTo stay a Wall Street darling, Pharma is gouging on drug prices, fleeing overseas and forming semi-secret partnerships with cyber giants. The public is appalled\u2014and government is helping out. \\nMartha Rosenberg is a freelance journalist and the author of the highly acclaimed \u201cBorn With A Junk Food Deficiency: How Flaks, Quacks and Hacks Pimp The Public Health,\u201d published by Prometheus Books.
