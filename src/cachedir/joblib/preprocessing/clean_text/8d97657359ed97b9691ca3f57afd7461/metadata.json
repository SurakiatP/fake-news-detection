Huge civilian death tolls in recent Saudi attacks have added up to make the US a bit more gunshy than usual about supporting the Saudi war publicly. \\nAt the same time, the US \u201copposition\u201d to the air war is slim indeed, with the US Ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, insisting even in the announcement of their opposition to further strikes that the US supports Saudi Arabia\u2019s right to \u201cself-defense,\u201d which in this case included an outright invasion of a neighboring country. \\nThe US has insisted Saudi aid is \u201cunder review\u201d since a recent attack on a funeral. That said, there is no sign that any real changes in US policy were made, and the expectation is that, as always, US interest in growing arms exports will win out.  '"}, "time": 1742563085.833052}
