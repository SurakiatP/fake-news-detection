Trump\u2019s attack on his   years as a prisoner of war. Instead, he clenches his teeth and says he will support the Republican Party\u2019s presumptive nominee, who once said derisively about the senator\u2019s time in captivity, \u201cI like people that weren\u2019t captured. \u201d In the   swelter here in Arizona, his home state, Mr. McCain, who was the Republicans\u2019 presidential nominee and   in 2008, did not openly bemoan this moment from his long political life. He is focusing on what he considers his toughest   fight yet, and is betting that the only way to keep his seat is to support Mr. Trump. \u201cI\u2019m fair game. I\u2019m in the arena,\u201d said Mr. McCain, 79, whose thinning face reflects the decades he has spent traveling around his massive and increasingly diverse state. Still, the episode sits with traces of bitterness, like old coffee grounds at the bottom of his cup, even if he says otherwise. For a moment, the July attack on Mr. McCain seemed to be Mr. Trump\u2019s undoing. McCain said he recalled a recent chat with a World War II veteran who had been in a German prison camp. As he delivered the man a missing medal, \u201che said to me, \u2018Why would Trump say something like that about us?\u2019 \u201d the senator said. \u201cFrankly, I didn\u2019t have an answer for it. \u201d But Mr. Trump has since called for mass deportations of illegal immigrants and a wall at the Mexican border, and now the billionaire businessman could be the force that ultimately topples the indomitable Mr. McCain. An estimated 433, 000 Hispanics are expected to vote in Arizona this November, an 8 percent increase from 2012. And Mr. McCain has a credible Democratic challenger, Representative Ann Kirkpatrick, who grew up on an Indian reservation and has strong support from the state\u2019s sizable Native American population. \u201cI just came from a Latino round table, and they are really concerned about McCain\u2019s support for Trump,\u201d she said Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s very personal here. \u201d She is working with the state\u2019s Democrats to harness these forces against Mr. McCain and his old guard, which is largely behind Mr. Trump. Ms. Kirkpatrick said that being   \u201cis a strong message,\u201d but she acknowledged that \u201cit\u2019s not the only message. \u201d She recently opened a field office in Tempe, and has many Arizona State University volunteers working the phones. Working out of an old bank, aides sit in the former vault (the door has been removed) to go over Mr. McCain\u2019s statements, year by year, and look for inconsistencies that suggest too long a stay in Congress. \u201cThe race comes down to whether Arizonans take a step back and judge John McCain for being John McCain and his remarkable life of public service,\u201d said Grant Woods, a former state attorney general and the senator\u2019s friend for decades. \u201cAnd not as being a   incumbent, and not as a Republican in a year when the party has a controversial nominee. If they do that, he will win walking away. If they don\u2019t, then it could be tight. Could he lose? Yeah. \u201d Despite the personal attacks by Mr. Trump on the senator\u2019s integrity and war record, Mr. McCain cannot afford to reject Mr. Trump and alienate his many supporters in Arizona if he hopes to hold his seat, an agonizing  . Mr. McCain is the embodiment of much that voters in both parties, but especially fans of Mr. Trump, have said they would like to jettison this year. He is the ultimate establishment player, having served in Congress for nearly four decades  \u2014   five terms in the Senate alone. \u201cBack in the Middle Ages, I was known as the maverick,\u201d Mr. McCain said, smiling wanly. He is an unapologetic free trader, an interventionist abroad who continues to defend the deeply unpopular war in Iraq, a supporter of private industry and markets, and the original, if inconstant, champion of changes to the immigration system that would help some illegal immigrants become citizens. To succeed in what most people believe will be his last political campaign, Mr. McCain must canter around the state assuring Mr. Trump\u2019s detractors that he does not share the businessman\u2019s visions for mass deportation and the dissolution of NATO, while continuing to woo an angry Republican base that overwhelmingly voted for Mr. Trump in the state\u2019s March primary. \u201cI\u2019ve been feeling it out there for some time,\u201d Mr. McCain said. \u201cIn the southern part of the state here, they are not feeling the recovery at all. Then there is this whole issue with these young people and kids carrying around all this debt. \u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the Bernie effect,\u201d he said, referring to Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s youth appeal in the Democratic primaries. He added: \u201cThe turmoil in this race is more than I\u2019ve ever seen. Younger, newer voters are registering for only one reason, to vote against Trump. So my challenge is to convince that younger, newer voter that I am for them. \u201d His greater challenge may be with Latinos angry at Mr. Trump. According to an analysis of voter and census data by the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Educational Fund, Latinos are expected to account for 17 percent of Arizona\u2019s registered electorate this year, with a voter turnout rate at close to 70 percent. Nearly 45 percent of Latino registered voters are Democrats, the report found. \u201cI\u2019ve always spent a lot of time with the Hispanic community,\u201d Mr. McCain said, \u201cbut having said that, they are rising in numbers in the voting population. I\u2019m putting more emphasis there, particularly in light of Trump\u2019s comments. \u201d Hispanics in the Phoenix area will also be heavily motivated to vote in the sheriff\u2019s election Joe Arpaio, a Trump supporter who was recently found in contempt of court for willfully violating an order requiring his deputies to stop detaining Latinos, will be on the ballot, trying to keep his seat as Maricopa County sheriff. A day watching Mr. McCain campaign here this past week reflects his evolving challenges. He sat for the endorsement of a small group of Border Patrol agents, who have also endorsed Mr. Trump, and listened in silence as Art Del Cueto, the president of Tucson Local 2455 of the National Border Patrol Council, explained why Mr. Trump had gotten their approval. \u201cIt means so much to me this long relationship we\u2019ve had,\u201d Mr. McCain said about his endorsement, \u201cand the support we\u2019ve tried to provide. \u201d Mr. Del Cueto did say that \u201cwe did talk to Donald\u201d about his comments concerning Mr. McCain\u2019s war record. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was a comment that has been made again,\u201d he said. But a bit later, meeting with Hispanic business leaders, Mr. McCain opened with \u201cWe\u2019re going to make America great again and it\u2019s going to be huge, O. K.?\u201d It was a tiny swipe at Mr. Trump, taken in the manner of a toddler grabbing a cookie when he assumes no one is looking. Then it was on to other topics, like the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization. Mr. McCain remains most at home with other veterans, like the one he visited  \u2014   on Memorial Day, another man waiting on medals. \u201cHis wife said he was staying alive to get those medals,\u201d Mr. McCain said, smiling at the memory. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s a nice job. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563849.7430167}
