[\u201cWe\u2019re not the opposition party, and we\u2019re not in a popularity contest with this administration or any administration,\u201d Lack said at a panel discussion at New York\u2019s IESE Business School, according to The Hollywood Reporter.  That referred to remarks made by White House chief strategist Steve Bannon in an interview in February, in which he said, \u201cI want you to quote this. The media here is the opposition party. They don\u2019t understand this country. They still do not understand why Donald Trump is the president of the United States. \u201d This sentiment was later back by President Trump when he told an interviewer, \u201cI think the media\u2019s the opposition party in many ways. \u201d Lack said an adversarial relationship between the press and the president is \u201cfundamental to our democracy. We go through periods where we\u2019re in the crosshairs, we\u2019re targeted. \u201d \u201cHere we are again,\u201d he asserted. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be intimidated by that. I think it\u2019s a distraction from what we\u2019d like to focus on, which is policy. \u201d But NBC News has not always met that mark. According to the New York Post, the Wikileaks dump of Democratic National Committee emails included one from CNBC anchor John Harwood to Clinton campaign manager John Podesta saying, \u201cLet\u2019s be honest, is this a   version of a presidential campaign?\u201d Another email to Podesta said, \u201cI imagine   \u2026     that Obama feels some (sad) vindication at this demonstration of his   point about the opposition party veering off the rails. \u201d On election night, Rachel Maddow said on MSNBC, \u201cI mean, to have the first   president succeeded by a guy who was endorsed by the KKK   \u2026     it\u2019s a big deal. \u201d Earlier in the fall, Lawrence O\u2019Donnell, also of MSNBC, called Trump \u201can imbecile candidate. \u201d And before that, Maddow said, \u201cI\u2019ve been reading a lot about what it was like when Hitler first became chancellor. I think that\u2019s possibly where we are\u201d if Trump is elected.'"}, "time": 1742628471.476951}
