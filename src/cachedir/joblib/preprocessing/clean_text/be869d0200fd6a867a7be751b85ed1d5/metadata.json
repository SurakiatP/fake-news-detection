Waking in a panic in his bed at the Lowell hotel, the   Italian production designer and art director was certain his latest project would miss its deadline. \u201cI dreamed the windows were empty,\u201d Mr. Ferretti said on a recent morning, concern still creasing his brow. He was referring to the   Christmas window displays he\u2019d been commissioned to create for the Madison Avenue flagship of the Italian luxury shoemaker Tod\u2019s. \u201cAt 5 o\u2019clock in the morning, I was going to run over to the store in my bathrobe,\u201d Mr. Ferretti said. \u201cThen I thought to myself, \u2018Maybe is better if I make a phone call first.\u2019 \u201d Happily, an assistant on the other end of the line assured Mr. Ferretti that the period dummy boards he had designed in the shapes of aerialists, contortionists, lion tamers and other tanbark performers  \u2014   but no clowns: \u201cI hate clowns\u201d \u2014   were up and ready, well in advance of the V. I. P. opening and the expected holiday hordes. \u201cBut then, I said to myself, \u2018I hope is enough,\u2019 \u201d said Mr. Ferretti, a genial neurotic whose list of collaborators includes Federico Fellini, Franco Zeffirelli, Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola and Tim Burton. \u201cI hope is good. I hope people don\u2019t go to other stores to find the shoes. \u201d Data from a surprisingly robust Black Friday weekend suggests that shoppers did in fact go to Tod\u2019s to find the shoes. What is more, they did not do all of their shopping online. True, 44 percent of consumers surveyed across the country said they had taken to the internet for their early Christmas purchases, while 40 percent shopped in stores, according to the National Retail Federation. Yet while    retailers have come to play more of what Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst with the NPD Group, calls a \u201csupporting role\u201d in the landscape of peak holiday season, a longing appears to persist for social dimensions of consuming and for something more fulfilling than a series of solitary    transactions on a   device. In that urge to participate in something collective can be found a reassuring counterpoint to a nightmare many retailers have awakened to in recent holiday seasons, one portending their own demise. Despite low unemployment levels, buoyant consumer confidence and, by many measures, a robust economy, analysts increasingly suggest a future is not far off when people will do nearly all their shopping online, visiting    retailers mainly for comparison pricing and to partake of shopping spectacle. Even at that, a cold   calculus has diminished the efforts many retailers put into creating entertainment for holiday shoppers. Of the scores of seasonal window displays once gracing the city\u2019s great retailing corridors, only a few sturdy stalwarts remain. To walk Fifth Avenue north from 34th Street to Central Park this season is to discover a startling paucity of merchants making more than a token nod to the holidays in their window displays. Never mind elves or Santa or Rudolph the   Reindeer. Barely a snowflake is to be found at   retailers like Zara, the North Face, Urban Outfitters, Uniqlo, Fossil, Tommy Bahama, Oakley, Guess, Desigual, Sephora or HM. This stark absence underscores both a shift in consumer patterns and the precious anachronism of what few holiday windows remain. Extravagant, giddy, gaudy, mechanized,   politically pointed or merely kitsch, the windows staged each year by Lord  Taylor, Saks Fifth Avenue, Bergdorf Goodman, Barneys New York, Tiffany  Company and Bloomingdale\u2019s have long been among New York\u2019s treasures. \u201cThey\u2019re a great gift to the city,\u201d said Sheryll Bellman, the author of \u201cThrough the Shopping Glass: A Century of New York Christmas Windows. \u201d \u201c  is still one of the great free things you can do in New York and one of the few you can participate in without being judged,\u201d Ms. Bellman added of a tradition said to have been pioneered locally by Macy\u2019s as early as the 1870s. Whether an average consumer would actually be brave enough to cross the threshold of department stores selling stuff like a $3, 500 Sylvie bag from Gucci or $800 suede Alexander Wang Tia pumps, any pedestrian can press nose to windowpane. And on peak days, as many as half a million people have been counted making their way past the holiday windows at Saks Fifth Avenue. \u201cIt\u2019s theater without tickets,\u201d Ms. Bellman said. A similar point was made over a century ago by L. Frank Baum, who in 1900  \u2014   the same year \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d came out  \u2014   published a   volume titled \u201cThe Art of Decorating Dry Goods Windows and Interiors. \u201d It represented the accumulated   lore acquired across the years by the onetime proprietor of Baum\u2019s Bazaar in Aberdeen, S. D. And in some ways as startling as the   technological innovations Baum advocated in creating \u201cillusion windows\u201d  \u2014   incandescent globes, revolving stairs or a bust of a \u201cVanishing Lady\u201d that periodically dropped below a pedestal, only to reappear in 10 minutes wearing a new hat  \u2014   is how many similar effects are still in use. Consider the \u201cLand of 1000 Delights\u201d that Saks Fifth Avenue unveiled on Nov. 21 (and is   on its website). Framed by nearly 13, 000 feet of linear garland outlining the facade of the blockwide Fifth Avenue flagship is a series of six windows in which whimsical, and symbolically charged, characters from \u201cThe Nutcracker Suite\u201d disport themselves amid landscapes composed of whirling, spinning cookies and candies tinted in   hues. Bruno Bettelheim, the psychologist, might have had a field day with scenes of Clara battling and \u201cwhipping\u201d an army of marshmallow mice or of a pair of harlequin gingerbread \u201ccrumbs\u201d dancing out from beneath the folds of the parted skirt of Mother Ginger. \u201cLast year, the theme was icy white, and we decided to go in the completely opposite direction,\u201d said Mark Briggs, the creative force behind the windows and an executive vice president at Hudson\u2019s Bay Company, which owns Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord  Taylor, on a recent    tour of the Saks windows. Reached by way of doors concealed from view on the store\u2019s main sales floor, the windows were, at less than four feet, surprisingly shallow for all their weird allusive depths. It is perhaps not remarkable that psychology plays a role in the creation of holiday windows. As if by unspoken agreement, windows at almost every one of the major department stores this season featured themes of nature both innocent and imperiled. At Lord  Taylor, a sidewalk bower of illuminated greenery acts as an enchanted tunnel. Through it, pedestrians are conducted past five windows portraying bunnies seen from a bird\u2019  vantage as they   on a forest pond a mother owl nestling three newly hatched owlets with bobble heads a bear buried in a snowbank a gaggle of dancing geese and a brace of foxes slumbering in an underground den as aboveground raccoons attempt to awaken them. At Bloomingdale\u2019s, a group of visual artists commissioned to create individual chandeliers on the general theme of \u201clight\u201d came up with sculptural fixtures evoking the moon, the stars, a human face in neon and a sprightly octopus with light bulbs at the tips of its tentacles. \u201cThere used to be so much more holiday display around, but now it\u2019s down to the five or so big department stores,\u201d said Jack Hruska, executive vice president for creative services at Bloomingdale\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019ve been here 25 years, and in my experience, our desire is not to sell merchandise so much as to be part of the New York experience. \u201d New York being the frenetic city it is, communicating the \u201cNew York experience\u201d  \u2014   whatever that may be  \u2014   demands of most window designers that they put their holiday message across efficiently enough to be understood on the run. \u201cWe tried some complex things and realized we were asking people to stand too long in the cold,\u201d Mr. Hruska said. Given that sidewalks on Lexington Avenue, where Bloomingdale\u2019s stands, are narrower than those on Fifth, a retail consultant had to be called in to devise a solution for pileups caused when frenzied holiday shoppers barreled into those who paused at the windows to gawp. \u201cHe advised us to put up planters with trees\u201d in order for people to step out of the flow and avoid what the consultant termed \u201cbutt rush,\u201d Mr. Hruska said. \u201cAnd that worked. \u201d Butt rush, alas, is hardly the challenge confronting the artists responsible for the gemlike miniature dioramas installed in the windows at Tiffany  Company. Pedestrians attempting to pass through the maze of Jersey barriers (now slipcovered in Tiffany blue) outside the jeweler\u2019s neighbor, Trump Tower, are routinely stopped for bag searches at guarded checkpoints by officials charged with protecting the   home of the  . It is no worry, either, outside Barneys New York on Madison Avenue, where the Love Peace Joy Project brought together artists like Nick Cave, Ebony G. Patterson and Rob Pruitt, the design collective Studio Job, and Trey Parker and Matt Stone of Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cSouth Park. \u201d Barneys gave them individual windows in which to riff  \u2014   brilliantly in each case  \u2014   on qualities that in the current climate seem in short supply. And happily, there is nothing to impede the pedestrian throngs that stand transfixed outside the Fifth Avenue windows of Bergdorf Goodman, where, as it has for decades, the specialty retailer has again installed a series of window displays as creatively unhindered as they are opulent. David Hoey, the senior director for visual presentation  \u2014   aided by a roster of over 100 craftspeople drawn from the ranks of the city\u2019s freelancers  \u2014   has once again produced a suite of windows that would do L. Frank Baum proud. \u201cThey let the kite out with us creatively,\u201d Mr. Hoey recently said, without exaggeration, of the   Neiman Marcus Group, which owns the specialty retailer. No one who experienced them will soon forget the baroque marvels Mr. Hoey and his cohort have conjured over the last two decades, windows filled with such things as Victorian fainting couches, albino peacocks, hundreds of specially commissioned needlepoint portraits of literary figures, scores of ventriloquist dummies, transistor radios, Snoopy figures, vintage toasters and anything and everything material that might, as he said, \u201cspoil your senses. \u201d Like many of the other holiday windows in town, Bergdorf\u2019s this season have a Mother Nature theme, as observed perhaps on an   road trip titled \u201cDestination Extraordinary. \u201d Delirious remakes of natural history museum dioramas, Mr. Hoey\u2019s   windows recreate jungle, desert and lagoon, and pack them with more details than it is possible to take in at any one time. Even in a   culture, as Linda Fargo, the senior vice president of Bergdorf Goodman recently noted, there are still few delights that can compare with what she termed \u201c  eye candy six inches away from you behind a plate of glass. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564203.8759887}
