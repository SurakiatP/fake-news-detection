But she did offer some friendly advice to the bank\u2019s chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, when he asked what he would need to do to mount his own hypothetical bid. \u201cI think you would leave Goldman Sachs and start running a soup kitchen somewhere,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cThen you could be a legend in your own time, both when you were there and when you left. \u201d Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign declined to release transcripts of her speeches to Wall Street firms during the Democratic primary contests, when her rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, intensely criticized her for accepting roughly $225, 000 per speech. But on Saturday, transcripts of three appearances at Goldman Sachs events were released by WikiLeaks, part of a trove of thousands of emails obtained by hackers who illegally breached the email account of one of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s top aides. The genial relationship she appeared to have with Mr. Blankfein and other Wall Street executives at the events would not have served Mrs. Clinton well in the Democratic primary contests, when Mr. Sanders used the speeches to portray her as being too close to Wall Street. But for Mrs. Clinton, who is often criticized as overly scripted, her relaxed,    exchanges at these private events also revealed a side that she has struggled to show voters under the intense glare of a presidential race. While the emails released last week showed Mrs. Clinton\u2019s cadre of campaign aides agonizing over jokes she should tell in public and calculating political implications, the transcripts revealed Mrs. Clinton freely dispensing her own quick wit before a   audience. In one    session with Mr. Blankfein, Mrs. Clinton relayed an argument she had had as secretary of state, when she tried to persuade a Chinese diplomat that his country had no more right to claim the South China Sea than the United States had to the Pacific Ocean. \u201cHe says to me, \u2018We\u2019ll, you know, we\u2019ll claim Hawaii,\u2019\u201d Mrs. Clinton told Mr. Blankfein. \u201cAnd I said: \u2018Yeah, but we have proof we bought it. Do you have proof you bought any of these places you\u2019re claiming? \u2019\u201d Mr. Blankfein interjected: \u201cBut they have to take New Jersey. \u201d \u201cNo, no, no,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to give them a red state. \u201d At these events, which took place in June and October of 2013, Mrs. Clinton repeatedly demurred when asked about her future plans, but it was also clear she was contemplating the political landscape if she were to run again. Mrs. Clinton said that if she mounted a presidential campaign, she would need to begin raising money in 2014 or \u201cearly the following year. \u201d And she expressed concerns about how the news media covered campaigns. \u201cOur political press has just been captured by trivia,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said at a C. E. O. conference in South Carolina at which Mr. Blankfein moderated a discussion. \u201cAnd so you don\u2019t want to give them any more time to trivialize the importance of the issues than you have to give them. You want to be able to wait as long as possible. \u201d Excerpts from some of her speeches had previously been released by WikiLeaks, shortly after a recording surfaced in which her opponent, Donald J. Trump, made crude remarks about women. The Clinton campaign has refused to verify the authenticity of the transcripts, which came from the hacked email account of John D. Podesta, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman. The campaign has blamed the Russian government for the hack and WikiLeaks  \u2014   whose founder, Julian Assange, is a critic of Mrs. Clinton  \u2014   for releasing the emails in a coordinated effort to help Mr. Trump, a view echoed by the Obama administration. The emails released Saturday included a fuller version of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s previously leaked answer to a question posed by Timothy J. O\u2019Neill, a senior Goldman executive, at a symposium hosted by the firm. Asked how Wall Street banks should approach efforts by Washington to impose tougher regulation and oversight, Mrs. Clinton made a show of empathy and spoke gently. She detailed her time working with Wall Street as a senator from New York and confided that the \u201cconventional wisdom\u201d of blaming Wall Street banks for the financial crisis was an \u201coversimplification. \u201d Mrs. Clinton described how banks were holding back on lending because they were \u201cscared of regulations. \u201d She urged banks to allow greater transparency and help policy makers come up with solutions. \u201cWe\u2019re all in this together,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told the audience. Most strikingly, Mrs. Clinton did not defend the 2010   financial oversight legislation, a major achievement of President Obama and congressional Democrats in the wake of the crisis  \u2014   and a target of Wall Street lobbying ever since. Instead, Mrs. Clinton suggested that it had been passed for \u201cpolitical reasons\u201d by lawmakers panicked by their angry constituents. \u201cI think the jury is still out on that because it was very difficult to sort of sort through it all,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said of the overhaul. Mrs. Clinton took a far stronger line in public, particularly after she began her second bid for president. In a January 2016 speech in New York, amid her tough primary campaign with Mr. Sanders, Mrs. Clinton vowed to defend the   Act and expand financial regulation to new territory, such as hedge funds and   traders. But most of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s insights involved foreign policy and her experiences as the nation\u2019s top diplomat, including concerns about North Korea\u2019s nuclear arsenal, the rise of   sentiment in China and a strikingly prescient prediction about the spread of nationalism in Europe. Mrs. Clinton presented the Pentagon\u2019s argument against establishing a   zone in Syria, a policy that she has advocated in her 2016 campaign. Noting that American pilots would have to enforce the   zone, she said, \u201cWe\u2019re not putting our pilots at risk,\u201d and added, \u201cYou\u2019re going to kill a lot of Syrians. \u201d Other hacked emails suggest Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign had deep concerns about the Wall Street transcripts being made public. In November 2015, as Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign was refusing to release transcripts of her paid speeches, her speechwriter, Dan Schwerin, suggested anonymously leaking to a reporter excerpts from one particular speech he wrote for her: A 2014 address to Deutsche Bank. In that speech, he said in the email, \u201cI wrote her a long riff about economic fairness and how the financial industry has lost its way, precisely for the purpose of having something we could show people if ever asked what she was saying behind closed doors for two years to all those fat cats. \u201d He also acknowledged that it was \u201cdefinitely not as tough or pointed as we would write it now. \u201d Another adviser, Mandy Grunwald, disagreed with Mr. Schwerin about releasing the 2014 speech. Referring to Mrs. Clinton by her initials, Ms. Grunwald argued that the speech had not been hard enough on Wall Street. The remarks, Ms. Grunwald said, \u201cmake it sound like HRC DOESN\u2019T think the game is rigged  \u2014   only that she recognizes that the public thinks so. \u201d Ms. Grunwald added: \u201cThey are angry. She isn\u2019t. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562191.190788}
