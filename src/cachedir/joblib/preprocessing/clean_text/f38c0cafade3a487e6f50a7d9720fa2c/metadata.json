But did you know there\u2019s one particularly dangerous time of day to vote? It has nothing to do with voter intimidation  \u2014   but everything to do with how you get to the polls. Hear about the hazards of Election Day  \u2014   and other types of \u201cStrange Danger\u201d  \u2014   on the debut episode of Tell Me Something I Don\u2019t Know with its host, Stephen J. Dubner. In everything he\u2019s done, Mr. Dubner has made it his mission to tell people about things they thought they knew but didn\u2019t, and things they didn\u2019t think they wanted to know but do. This manifesto has informed his \u201cFreakonomics\u201d books (authored with Steven D. Levitt, an economist at the University of Chicago) and his Freakonomics Radio podcast. Now Mr. Dubner has a new way to carry on that mission: hosting a New York Times podcast, Tell Me Something I Don\u2019t Know. On each episode, contestants get up onstage, in front of a live audience, and present an \u201cIDK\u201d  \u2014   \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d  \u2014   which might be a strange fact, some groundbreaking research or a forgotten piece of history. Three celebrity panelists poke and prod the presenters, and ultimately choose a winner. It\u2019s still factual and still journalism, but disguised as a game show. For our debut show, the theme is \u201cStrange Danger,\u201d with these panelists: Debora Spar, president of Barnard College of Columbia University and author of \u201cWonder Women: Sex, Power, and the Quest for Perfection. \u201d She speaks faster backward than you do forward. Anthony Marx, president of the New York Public Library and former president of Amherst College, who, in his youth, crossed a border illegally. Andy Zaltzman, comedian, political satirist and host of The Bugle podcast, who moonlights as a midwife very occasionally. Our \u201c  Human Fact Checker\u201d is Jody Avirgan, who hosts FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Elections podcast. Election Day is just one of the strange dangers featured on this episode. We also have a sleep specialist from Atlanta with a theory on why we need our zzzzs. Also: An emergency room doctor describes the (shall we say) unusual actions of people about to freeze to death. And a Princeton professor tells us why supermarket shelves went empty in the early 1970s. (Hint: This was around the time Johnny Carson made a joke that led to   hoarding.)
