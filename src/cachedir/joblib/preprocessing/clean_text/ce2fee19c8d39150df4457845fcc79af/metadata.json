[During last Wednesday\u2019s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on FBI oversight, Comey stated Abedin appears to have engaged in a \u201cregular practice of forwarding  \u201d to Weiner\u2019s computer, possibly for him to print out.  The testimony, which came during an exchange with Sen. John Kennedy ( ) about classified emails found on Weiner\u2019s computer, went thusly: KENNEDY: OK. Was there classified information on  \u2014   on former Congressman Weiner\u2019s computer? COMEY: Yes. KENNEDY: Who sent it to him? COMEY: His then spouse, Huma Abedin, appears to have had a regular practice of forwarding   to him, for him I think to print out for her so she could then deliver them to the Secretary of State. Those details seem to contradict claims made by Abedin last November through her lawyer, Karen Dunn, immediately following reports that the FBI discovered possible Clinton emails on her estranged husband\u2019s computer. Dunn claimed that Abedin did not know how the emails could have reached Weiner\u2019s device and only learned about the possibility of emails being on Weiner\u2019s laptop via media reports. \u201cShe only learned for the first time on Friday, from press reports, of the possibility that a laptop belonging to Mr. Weiner could contain emails of hers. While the FBI has not contacted us about this, Ms. Abedin will continue to be, as she always has been, forthcoming and cooperative,\u201d Dunn said in the statement. Politico further quoted a \u201csource familiar with Abedin\u2019s account\u201d as stating that, according to Politico\u2019s portrayal, that Abedin \u201chas told colleagues she was taken aback when she learned that the FBI found her emails on a laptop belonging to her estranged husband, Anthony Weiner, and doesn\u2019t know how the messages got there. \u201d That\u2019s a far cry from Comey\u2019s testimony that Abedin appears to have regularly forwarded Clinton emails to Weiner. Weiner was seemingly trusted in Clinton\u2019s inner circle. As Breitbart News reported last November, one Clinton email released at the time had Clinton asking Abedin whether a trusted staff member working for Weiner could deliver a secure cell phone to Clinton. Meanwhile, Comey\u2019s revelation has some calling for a special prosecutor to probe Abedin. Last week, Sen. Richard Blumenthal ( ) was asked on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe whether he believes Abedin\u2019s actions were potentially criminal. \u201cIf there was classified information and it was improperly passed to a person unauthorized to receive it. Yes, it\u2019s a crime,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout knowing what the intentions were and so forth, there is potentially a prosecutable crime. \u201d \u201cShould it have been prosecuted?\u201d host Joe Scarborough asked. \u201cIt still may be potentially. It\u2019s not outside the statute of limitations. Who will decide it? That\u2019s why we need a special prosecutor to review all of this investigative material,\u201d Blumenthal replied.
