But before she makes her final play for the White House, Fox has a pressing question for the Democratic  . \\n\u201cWhere the fuck is Hillary Clinton right now?\u201d Fox asked during his guest appearance on \u201cLive at Truthdig\u201d at the site\u2019s Los Angeles headquarters. \\nThat was more of a pointed question than a literal one, since anyone with a television or smartphone can easily track down where Clinton is making her latest campaign stump speech. \\nMore specifically, Fox, who\u2019s a climate activist and playwright as well as the director of the Oscar-nominated documentary \u201cGasland,\u201d was wondering why Clinton wasn\u2019t anywhere near the contested grounds of North Dakota where the ongoing clash over the Dakota Access pipeline is reaching a volatile point. \\n  \\nRemarking that \u201cwe all want to think that we would be on the right side\u201d of history and that, for example, \u201cif we were in Selma, we all would have marched with King,\u201d Fox positioned Clinton squarely \u201con the wrong side of history right now\u201d for maintaining a conspicuous silence about the DAPL battle. \\n\u201cYou cannot stand by when a racist occupying force that is run by the government of a rogue state is operating as an arm of the oil and gas industry, is attacking natives, is attacking protesters, is attacking people and torturing them in the ways that we saw in the Iraq War,\u201d Fox said. \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable.\u201d \\nFox was equally unsparing about Clinton\u2019s environmental credentials. \u201cHillary Clinton is not an environmentalist,\u201d he said. \u201cHillary Clinton is not adequate on climate change. And right now, she\u2019s standing by while human rights abuses are unfolding in America where she\u2019s running for president.\u201d \\nThe director was making the media rounds to drum up support for the activists and members   allied protesters in North Dakota, some of whom faced off Thursday with police in riot gear as law enforcement and National Guard personnel forcibly removed protesters from their encampment near one of the pipeline\u2019s construction zones. He was also putting out the word about the plight of fellow filmmaker Deia Schlosberg, producer of his 2016 documentary \u201cHow to Let Go of the World (and Love All the Things Climate Can\u2019t Change),\u201d who was arrested and hit with conspiracy charges earlier this month while shooting footage of activists at a North Dakota tar sands pipeline. Schlosberg has been charged with three felonies and may face 45 years in prison. \\nWATCH: Amy Goodman Explains Decision to Turn Herself In to North Dakota Authorities (Video) \\n\u201cWe need to drop all the charges immediately, we need her footage back\u2014her footage was confiscated,\u201d Fox said of Schlosberg. \u201cWe definitely need an outcry and an outpouring of support for our journalists who are facing jail time for doing what is a constitutionally protected activity.\u201d Fox has posted a videotaped statement about his colleague\u2019s plight, as well as information about a petition, on this promotional site for his latest work. \\nDespite his robust criticism of Clinton, Fox told Truthdig\u2019s Sarah Wesley, Emma Niles and Donald Kaufman that he was more concerned about the possibility of GOP nominee Donald Trump winning this election. Fox, who had supported Democratic candidate and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and served on the Democratic platform committee at last summer\u2019s party convention, said he understood Sanders\u2019 reasons for backing the Democratic ticket: \u201cIf Bernie Sanders\u2019 legacy was to contribute to the election of Donald Trump, I think his whole life would have been a failure.\u201d \\nAs for Green Party   Jill Stein? \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s immoral what she\u2019s doing,\u201d Fox said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t care if I say this on air for the very first time\u2014I spent eight years building the environmental movement, I spent eight years coast-to-coast building the [anti-]fracking movement, I went to 250 cities. I did not see the Green Party having a significant hand in the building of that movement.\u201d \\nWatch the full interview below for more about Fox\u2019s take on the presidential candidates, the Dakota Access pipeline crisis and how to be an effective activist (hint: Don\u2019t try it at home):'"}, "time": 1742628417.2897532}
