{"duration": 1.9072089195251465, "input_args": {"text": "'On\u2019u2009the morning after Election Day, Chuck Schumer\u2019s phone rang. It was Donald Trump. Trump has repeatedly described Schumer as his friend  \u2014   which, the New York senator was at pains to clarify when we first spoke in   \u201cisn\u2019t quite true. \u201d There had been the occasional favor at Schumer\u2019s request, Trump hosted a   for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee at    in 2008, and Schumer made a cameo on \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d in 2006. Beyond that, Schumer told me: \u201cI bump into him at meetings here and there. We never went out to dinner once. We never played golf together. I sort of knew him. \u201d On election night, Schumer was at Hillary Clinton\u2019s party at the Javits Convention Center in Midtown Manhattan when, around 8 p. m. he saw some troubling exit polls coming out of Florida and North Carolina. They showed that   women in both states  \u2014   a demographic that everyone assumed would be a lock  \u2014   were underperforming for Clinton. Schumer called one of her top campaign advisers, who tried to reassure him. \u201cHe says, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, our firewalls in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and Michigan are strong,\u2019\u2019u2009\u201d Schumer recalls. \u201c\u2019u2009\u2018There\u2019s no way Trump can win. \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d Schumer kept up appearances. He tweeted a photo of himself in front of a catering table with Kate McKinnon, who plays Clinton on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d (\u201cI got to congratulate Hillary Clinton  \u2014   oops, wrong Hillary! \u201d) and then took the stage, leading the crowd in a chant of \u201cI believe that she will win!\u201d But by shortly after 11 p. m. Trump had taken Ohio and North Carolina. The probability dashboards on the   websites had lurched Trumpward, and an unthinkable future was lumbering into view. Schumer, who was in line to succeed Harry Reid as the   Democrat in the Senate after Reid\u2019s retirement in December, had spent roughly $8 million of his own campaign funds on Democratic senatorial campaigns in other states in hopes of retaking control of the upper chamber, which the Democrats lost in 2014, and of making himself the majority leader. On his bookshelf he kept a copy of \u201cMaster of the Senate,\u201d the historian Robert Caro\u2019s exhaustive chronicle of Lyndon Johnson\u2019s years as the Democratic majority leader, which Caro had inscribed to Schumer: \u201cWhose career I have been following for years with real admiration, so that I have no doubt that he will be a great leader of senators. \u201d But by the early hours of Wednesday it was clear that the Democrats would not take the Senate and that Schumer would not be Lyndon Johnson. \u201cWe\u2019ll work together,\u201d Trump said on the phone call. He said he wanted to repeal the Affordable Care Act  \u2014   \u201cthat A. C. A. is terrible,\u201d he told Schumer  \u2014   which was an obvious nonstarter for the incoming minority leader. He also said he wanted a   infrastructure plan. \u201cI said, \u2018Well, a trillion dollars sounds good to me,\u2019\u2019u2009\u201d Schumer told me. But to get Democrats on board, he warned, three conditions had to be met. \u201cYou can\u2019t do it with these tax breaks,\u201d he said. Second, he could not \u201ccut the programs we care about  \u2014   Medicare, education, scientific research  \u2014   to pay for this. It\u2019s got to be new spending. \u201d Finally, the bill had to preserve existing environmental and labor protections. \u201cI said, \u2018To do that, you\u2019re going to have to get half your party really mad at you. \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d Schumer, as he saw it, was calling Trump\u2019s bluff. \u201cDonald Trump ran as an   populist  \u2014   against both the Democratic and Republican establishments,\u201d he told me. Whether or not he had meant it, the Democrats could try to hold him to it. On the several occasions that Trump called Schumer in the weeks after the election, Schumer argued that he could try to govern as a   conservative, but \u201cAmerica is not a   country,\u201d and there would be electoral consequences. It might not have been the strongest card to play, but Schumer did not have a strong hand. The election in November left the Democrats stripped of power at every level of federal authority. Schumer would now possess the only means they had of exerting even limited influence over Trump\u2019s agenda: a Senate Democratic caucus that, while several seats shy of a majority, was large enough to make life complicated for Senate Republicans. But that could happen only if the Democrats formed a united front  \u2014   and it was unclear whether they could, or even wanted to. The 2016 election was not just an electoral crisis for the party but also an existential one, more severe than any that the Democrats had experienced in decades. The party had glided through the campaign with a sense of destiny: In July, Schumer breezily remarked that \u201cFor every   Democrat we will lose in western Pennsylvania, we will pick up two, three moderate Republicans in the suburbs in Philadelphia, and you can repeat that in Ohio and Illinois and Wisconsin. \u201d Then Hillary Clinton lost to a candidate who revived a strain of nativist, nationalist politics that had been dormant in the Republican Party for at least a generation, and who won in part on the ballots of Barack Obama voters in traditionally Democratic strongholds like Michigan and Wisconsin. \u201cI sleep like a baby,\u201d Chris Murphy, the Democratic senator from Connecticut, told me. \u201cAnd I can sleep anywhere  \u2014   on the road, on the floor, in my kid\u2019s bed jammed up against the wall. \u201d But on election night, he says: \u201cIt\u2019s so clich\u00e9, but I stayed up all night. I was, mentally, totally unprepared. At some level, you do have this  \u2014   \u201d he trailed off and was silent for a moment. \u201cYou do start to question whether you know the country as well as you thought. \u201d The Democratic primaries and caucuses, meanwhile, had left the party sharply divided. Clinton lost 22 states to Bernie Sanders, Vermont\u2019s independent and   socialist senator, whose    challenge had stirred a   excitement that Clinton\u2019s campaign conspicuously lacked and acrimoniously split the Democratic Party\u2019s centrist and   contingents  \u2014   the latter of which viewed the Obama years as a missed opportunity to fight economic inequality, reorient trade policy and rein in Wall Street. Clinton might have won the popular vote, but in a way, this only amplified the confusion: about whether the party needed to transform or simply tinker whether it needed to move to the right or to the left whether the voters who were willing to vote for a candidate who said the things Trump said could be won back at all. These were problems for anyone trying to chart a course for the Democrats, but in a particularly acute way they were problems for Schumer, a politician who was better known as a dealmaker, a student of consensus, than as a pathfinder. As majority leader, the next two years might have been the pinnacle of his career: bill signings, valedictory news conferences (and few politicians visibly delight in news conferences the way Schumer does) the sorts of   negotiations that historians like Caro write books about. Instead, Schumer found himself with a job that The Times Union, in Albany, observed two days after the election was \u201csomething of a booby prize. \u201d The Democrats, who spent Obama\u2019s presidency railing against Republican obstructionism, would soon be facing a president who, in his stated ambitions to unmake much of Obama\u2019s legacy, was all but inviting them to try the same. Whether this was in Schumer\u2019s\u2019u200b \u2019u200bDNA was one question. Whether it was in t\u2019u200bhe party\u2019s\u2019u200b \u2019u200bwas another. The Democrats have never been a natural opposition party, or a particularly effective one. Republicans from Reagan to the Tea Party broadly believed in reducing government, as the   activist Grover Norquist famously put it, \u201cto the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub. \u201d Cutting budgets and eliminating programs might require a Republican president and a congressional majority, but lacking this, a disciplined minority party could gum up the works, starving existing initiatives and blocking attempts to expand them. Democrats, by contrast, have generally been united by a belief in government that tries to do big things, in the manner of Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal or Johnson\u2019s Great Society or, later, Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act  \u2014   a belief that, practically speaking, requires either landslide majorities or a willingness to compromise. Several   polls in recent years have found that this difference is reflected in the party\u2019s electorates, which have increasingly come to view the political process in starkly different ways. In a 2014 Pew survey, 82 percent of people who identified as \u201cconsistently liberal\u201d said they liked politicians who were willing to make compromises just 32 percent of \u201cconsistently conservative\u201d respondents agreed. The week of Trump\u2019s inauguration, David Brock  \u2014   the onetime conservative journalist turned liberal gadfly  \u2014   hosted a private gathering of Democratic luminaries at Turnberry Isle, a golf resort outside Miami. One speaker Brock invited was Ronald Klain, the former chief of staff to Vice Presidents Al Gore and Joe Biden, who previously worked for Tom Daschle, the Senate minority leader, in the aftermath of the 1994 midterms, when the Republicans took control of both houses of Congress for the first time in 40 years. Addressing Brock\u2019s crowd, Klain called for Democrats to embrace what he dubbed the   Fight Club. As Klain learned from working with Daschle, \u201cYou have to take on a lot of fights to win any fights,\u201d he told me recently. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in the minority, you can\u2019t be too choosy. I advocated a strategy of more comprehensive opposition. \u201d But plenty of the Democrats present  \u2014   among them the Chicago mayor and former White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, who was sharing the stage with Klain  \u2014   disagreed. \u201cAt the time, there was more of a divide,\u201d Klain told me. \u201cThe \u2018we gotta pick our spots\u2019 philosophy: \u2018He\u2019s a new president  \u2014   we don\u2019t want to look like McConnell looked in 2009. \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d Mitch McConnell, the Republican senator from Kentucky who was then the minority leader and is now majority leader, reportedly mapped out a program of   resistance shortly before Obama took office  \u2014   a strategy that Democrats spent subsequent years attacking as cynical and irresponsible. \u201cWe\u2019re Democrats,\u201d Klain said. \u201cWe like to govern. \u201d Among the Democrats who appeared to share Klain\u2019s postelection view was Harry Reid, Schumer\u2019s predecessor as minority leader, who would be retiring in December. Reid and Schumer, then Reid\u2019s deputy, were an effective team for years in the Senate, partners in a       act. Schumer was known as a   partisan during his 18 years in the House of Representatives, but in the Senate he had become an avatar of the gabby   bonhomie that had historically characterized the upper chamber. \u201cYou know, I get along,\u201d Schumer told me. \u201cI\u2019m in the gym in the morning, I\u2019m talking with Thune, and Lamar, and Cornyn all the time,\u201d he said, referring to the Republican Senators John Thune, Lamar Alexander and John Cornyn. \u201cI\u2019m friends with them. They attack me, I attack them. We understand that. \u201d This was the old way of the Senate  \u2014   one that began to fade in the late 1970s as the ideological consolidation of the parties accelerated, reducing their need and taste for compromise. By the time Schumer arrived in 1999, four years after the Newt   Republican revolution, it was fast becoming an anachronism, with meals in the senators\u2019 bipartisan dining room giving way to   caucus lunches. By the time Reid became minority leader, amid the   polarization of George W. Bush\u2019s second term, it was all but gone. Reid, like his Republican counterpart, McConnell, was one of the rare politicians who seemed to genuinely not care if people liked him or not. He was known for his   floor speeches, sandbags of verbiage delivered with minimal theatrics and less ambiguity of purpose. It was in this mode that he took to the Senate floor, a week after the election, and drew a line. Senate Democrats had tried for years to pass the kind of infrastructure bill Trump had suggested, Reid reminded his colleagues, only to run up against Republican opposition. \u201cIf Trump wants to pursue policies that will help working people, Democrats will take a pragmatic approach,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we also have other responsibilities. \u201d He made clear that the price of Democratic cooperation should be Trump\u2019s dropping of Stephen K. Bannon, the former Breitbart News executive chairman who ran his campaign and whom Trump named as his chief White House strategist two days earlier. \u201cIn his first official act, Trump appointed a man who is seen as a champion of white supremacy as the No. 1 strategist in his White House,\u201d Reid said. \u201cAs long as a champion of racial division is a step away from the Oval Office,\u201d he added, \u201cit will be impossible to take Trump\u2019s efforts to heal the nation seriously. \u201d Reid and Schumer might have differed temperamentally, but they were both thinking about the 2018 midterm elections, in which 25 Democratic senators would be defending their seats. Lose eight seats, and the Republicans would have 60, enough to override a Democratic filibuster  \u2014   at which point the Democrats\u2019 debates about what they stood for or against would be academic. Five of the those senators  \u2014  \u201cthe Big Five,\u201d Schumer called them  \u2014   were moderate Democrats in states in the Midwest, the Mountain West and Appalachia that Trump had just won handily. The abiding question was what, exactly, the voters who cast ballots for both Trump and, say, North Dakota\u2019s Democratic senator, Heidi Heitkamp, were voting for in 2016 the party was still far from a clear answer. Schumer, who began holding weekly dinners with the Big Five after the election, believed it was best to allow these senators to cooperate with Trump as necessary. But according to members of Reid\u2019s staff at the time, Reid (who declined to comment) worried that, given Trump\u2019s lack of interest in policy detail and disregard for ethical conflicts, even   legislative compromises could prove to be politically costly  \u2014   that an eventual backlash against the president would also fall upon Democrats who gestured toward working with him. \u201cReid didn\u2019t want to validate the assumption that this incompetent blowhard could get a bill to the floor in the first place, which has proved to be a struggle for Trump so far,\u201d Adam Jentleson, at the time Reid\u2019s deputy chief of staff, told me. Democrats were also still deeply divided over whether it was even possible to navigate 2017 without resolving the ideological and policy differences that fractured the party in 2016. At a   meeting of the Democracy Alliance  \u2014   a network of   Democratic campaign donors  \u2014   at the Mandarin Oriental hotel in Washington the week after the election, Senator Elizabeth Warren delivered an emotional address, excoriating the party for losing its way. One attendee paraphrased her speech to me: \u201cPeople want someone to fight for them  \u2014   that\u2019s why they voted for Donald Trump. He might not actually do it, but he said he would fight for them. On trade, in American politics, we\u2019ve gotten where we either look like we\u2019re all about free trade without any empathy for people who have lost their jobs, or we\u2019re rabid  . We need to build a policy in between. In 2016, we did not come out clear. When we are clear about what we believe, when we fight for people, we\u2019ll win. \u201d To beat pugilistic   populism, maybe you needed pugilistic   populism. Reid brought Warren onto the Democratic Senate leadership team in 2014, and she was one of the people he most trusted to keep the Senate caucus on its bearings through the difficult weather ahead. Shortly before Thanksgiving, he summoned Warren to the minority leader\u2019s office. When she arrived, the room was littered with art supplies on an easel was a   portrait of Reid that would be unveiled at his retirement party the following month. Its subject was preoccupied with the future of the party to which he had dedicated decades of his life. Reid told Warren she needed to think seriously about running for president in 2020. \u201cHe was worried in November,\u201d Warren told me recently. \u201cFor me, it was so important to make clear: We will fight back  \u2014   we will fight back. We\u2019re not here to make this normal. \u201d Warren believed that the Democrats\u2019 first postelection battle should be over the   Cures Act, a $6. 3 billion   funding bill then before the Senate, which she argued gave away too much to the pharmaceutical industry and would weaken drug regulations. At a Nov. 28 meeting of the party\u2019s Senate leadership team, she argued that the Democrats should negotiate harder than they had on the bill. But the idea was dead on arrival Trump was not in office yet, and the Obama administration supported the legislation, which among other things would finance the Cancer Moonshot initiative that Joe Biden planned to make his life\u2019s work after leaving office. Warren crusaded against the bill on the Senate floor anyway, but only two Democrats joined her in voting against it. It was a minor fight, but an illuminating one. From one perspective, Warren\u2019s move looked quixotic at a time when the party had bigger problems. From another, it was an argument for survival: Whatever unity the Democrats could manage would be worthless without settling what, and who, the party stood for. On the evening of Dec. 14, as Democrats were still struggling to find their way, a Google Doc appeared online titled \u201cIndivisible: A Practical Guide for Resisting the Trump Agenda. \u201d Its main authors were three young former Democratic congressional staff members whose ambitions were at once modest and sweeping. \u201cWe\u2019re not starting an organization, and we\u2019re not selling anything,\u201d they wrote. What they were offering was a blueprint. \u201cThe guide is intended to be equally useful for stiffening Democratic spines and weakening   Republican resolve,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe believe that the next four years depend on citizens across the country standing indivisible against the Trump agenda. We believe that buying into false promises or accepting partial concessions will only further empower Trump to victimize our fellow citizens. \u201d The Twitter account that first circulated the blueprint belonged to Ezra Levin, then a    associate director for federal policy at an antipoverty nonprofit and one of the document\u2019s authors. Shortly after graduating from college, Levin was hired by Lloyd Doggett, a Democratic congressman representing Levin\u2019s hometown, Austin, Tex. and he was working at Doggett\u2019s office on Aug. 1, 2009, when the congressman went to meet his constituents at a Randalls grocery store in South Austin. At the time, Democrats were trying to maneuver the Affordable Care Act through the House of Representatives, and organizers of the nascent Tea Party movement decided to mount a show of force at the town halls that representatives typically held in their districts during the August recess. As Doggett spoke outside the Randalls, a large crowd of demonstrators gathered, armed with DON\u2019T TREAD ON ME flags, signs assailing \u201csocialized health care\u201d and, in one case, a large poster of Doggett\u2019s face augmented with devil horns. \u201cThey chased him out into the parking lot,\u201d Levin told me recently. When Doggett tried to leave, the crowd surrounded his car. For the congressional staff members who experienced the uprising that August, the lessons of the Tea Party were mostly tactical, and unambiguous. Representatives live in fear of the wrath of their constituents, but also at a remove from it the legislative process is complicated, blame is easily distributed and Washington is far away. There is an adage on Capitol Hill that five letters from the district about a bill is cause for alarm, and 10 is a   emergency. By those standards, a couple hundred Tea Partyers besieging their elected officials in person was a borderline apocalypse. Republicans had in recent decades outperformed Democrats at this kind of dispersed,   activism. This was in part because the party was more geographically distributed than the Democrats, who were increasingly concentrated in urban areas and interior suburbs. But Democrats had also historically relied heavily on unions and urban party machines to reach voters  \u2014   a support apparatus that receded sharply by the late 20th century. The Republicans, who never had such luxuries, assiduously cultivated their own grass roots  \u2014   an effort whose success has contributed to the deep erosion of the Democrats\u2019 presence in state legislatures (down 23 percent) and governor\u2019s mansions (down nearly 45 percent) since 2008. The most combustible Tea Party town halls were confrontations with Democrats, like Doggett, whose positions on the A. C. A. stood little chance of changing. But these representatives weren\u2019t really the intended audience Republicans were. The shaky,   videos posted to YouTube  \u2014   the first real recognition, in American politics, of the platform\u2019s potential as a stage for agitprop theater  \u2014   and looped endlessly on Fox News were a message to wavering Republicans that obstruction would be rewarded and compromise would be punished. \u201cThey were really smart on strategy,\u201d Levin told me: \u201cFocus on your local members, and be defensive in nature. \u201d Perhaps most important, \u201cThey understood that \u2018No\u2019 was a complete sentence. \u201d \u201cIndivisible\u201d was a   pr\u00e9cis of the tactics the document\u2019s authors had seen work against them  \u2014   a guide to getting to \u201cNo. \u201d \u201cWe\u2019re under no illusion that the resistance will defeat every piece of Trump\u2019s agenda,\u201d Levin told me. The Tea Party lost many battles, including its biggest: \u201cObamacare was passed.   did pass. Lloyd Doggett did vote for health care. But it did slow down and water down legislation. We didn\u2019t get card check for unions. We didn\u2019t get cap and trade. We didn\u2019t get a lot of things. \u201d If the Indivisible Guide was a blueprint for a movement, it was an unusual one, bearing little resemblance to liberal or   movements of the past. It called for no ideological remaking of the Democratic Party, no housecleaning of the establishment, no   of the bums  \u2014   or at least not the Democratic ones. Its authors weren\u2019t political outsiders they were members of Washington\u2019s mainstream Democratic professional class. The document presented not just a strategy for standing up to Trump but also an argument for sidestepping the party\u2019s most divisive internal conflicts. It offered a way of thinking about resisting the Trump administration that set aside the debate over what kind of party the Democrats should be. \u201cThis is not a panacea,\u201d the authors wrote, \u201cnor is it intended to stand alone. \u201d It was not a policy agenda, and that was the point. \u201cThe Tea Party took root in 2009, focused on fighting against every proposal coming out of the new Democratic administration and Congress. This focus on defense rather than policy development allowed the movement to avoid fracturing. Tea Party members may not have agreed on the policy reforms, but they could agree that Obama, Democrats and moderate Republicans had to be stopped. \u201d Within two days of Levin\u2019s initial tweet, the guide was enthusiastically circulated by Democratic old hands (like Robert Reich, Bill Clinton\u2019s first labor secretary) liberal journalists (New York magazine\u2019s Jonathan Chait) and celebrities (George Takei, Miranda July). When the authors set up a proper website, it was viewed more than five million times in its first month  \u2014   a testament to how closely the guide mirrored where Democratic voters already were. Demonstrators flocked to impromptu protests in the days immediately after the election, prompting Trump to fume on Twitter less than two days after his victory: \u201cJust had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair!\u201d Five days before Trump\u2019s inauguration, congressional Democrats  \u2014   aided by Bernie Sanders, who deployed the formidable email list he built during his presidential campaign  \u2014   held rallies in defense of the Affordable Care Act across the country, in some cases drawing thousands of demonstrators. What the crowds lacked for now, however, was any particular focal point besides the simple fact of Trump\u2019s presidency and what they anticipated it might try to do in its early days. They were a force in search of an object. The first significant chances for Democratic lawmakers to stand against Trump\u2019s presidency in some concrete form were the votes for his cabinet appointments. Five hours after he was sworn in, on Jan. 20, the Senate considered James Mattis, a retired   Marine Corps general, for defense secretary. Democrats broadly considered Mattis to be far from the worst pick for the Pentagon that Trump could have made. As Schumer told me, \u201cHe was against torture and got Trump to actually shift. \u201d The only member of either party to vote against him was Kirsten Gillibrand, New York\u2019s junior Democratic senator. Gillibrand\u2019s stated objection to Mattis was that his appointment would weaken civilian control over the military. She personally forced a   vote on his appointment  \u2014   an opportunity to literally stand up and be counted, as the lone opposition figure  \u2014   which seemed to indicate that she understood the significance of the moment. Gillibrand was initially a moderate Democrat representing an upstate district in the House of Representatives, then almost immediately established herself as one of the most liberal members in the Senate after arriving there in 2009. She was also one of the first senators to grasp the importance, and potential, of the Women\u2019s March, which would descend on Washington the day after the Mattis vote. March organizers say they invited some senators to speak, but Gillibrand came to them asking to be involved. In the days after the Women\u2019s March, the rest of the party began to figure out what Gillibrand had already grasped: Maybe the party\u2019s base wanted the Democrats to act like McConnell. A protest against one aspect of Trump quickly became a protest against all aspects of him. A demonstration in Washington also drew crowds in Louisville, Ky. Boise, Idaho Charleston, S. C. Des Moines. \u201cI lived very personally through the loss in 2000, the Supreme Court decision,\u201d Klain, who was general counsel for Al Gore during that year\u2019s presidential recount, told me. \u201cAnd the response this time has been nothing like that. There has been genuine   activism  \u2014   not just in the big cities but also everywhere else. \u201d The Democratic base, at least, had gotten to \u201cNo. \u201d And it expected the Senate Democrats to get there too. The first demonstrations outside Schumer\u2019s Brooklyn apartment building were slightly apologetic affairs. The crowd of about 100 protesters who gathered on Jan. 8 around the   prewar   across the street from Prospect Park carried unequivocal signs: MAKE US PROUD OR WE\u2019LL PRIMARY YOU DON\u2019T CUT DEALS WITH THE DEVIL! But Mark Dunlea of 350Brooklyn, a group that put together the rally, was quick to explain to a reporter from the website DNAInfo that \u201cwe see Schumer primarily as an ally. We\u2019re just trying to encourage him to be more aggressive on these issues. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re protesting Schumer  \u2014   we\u2019re urging him to be stronger. \u201d By the week after Inauguration Day, however, rallies were happening nationwide every Tuesday and had acquired an angrier edge. Trump was issuing a flurry of executive orders: reduced regulations on manufacturing, a pledge to disassemble the Affordable Care Act, advancements of the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines, the end of federal funding for \u201csanctuary cities\u201d  \u2014   municipalities that limit their cooperation with federal authorities in detaining people suspected of   violations  \u2014   and the   to build his   United   border wall. Then, on the afternoon of Friday, Jan. 27, the White House announced it was immediately blocking all travel to the United States by citizens of seven   countries. The next evening, thousands of demonstrators converged on international airports around the country as travelers who were caught up in the ban languished behind security cordons. Some Democratic lawmakers who were back in their districts for the weekend joined them. Warren was at Boston\u2019s Logan International Airport, red megaphone in hand. Cory Booker was at the Alfalfa Club dinner  \u2014   a cozy Washington institution that Trump skipped but several White House officials were, reportedly, attending  \u2014   when his chief of staff called him from Dulles International Airport. \u201cI basically bolted,\u201d Booker told me. \u201cI mean, just compare: Who do I want to be standing with?\u201d By 11:45 p. m. he was in the terminal, his tuxedo jacket exchanged for a sweater, addressing the protesters: \u201cThis is going to be a long, arduous and tough fight. And let me tell you right now: We have to be determined to continue the fight. \u201d The following afternoon, when a crowd of 10, 000 gathered to protest in Manhattan\u2019s Battery Park, the first person in line to address the demonstrators, after the rally organizers, was Chuck Schumer. Taking the microphone, Schumer led the crowd in an old standby of a chant  \u2014   \u201cA people united will never be divided!\u201d  \u2014   and, somewhat tentatively, raised his fist. A couple near where I was standing, next to the stage, started laughing. It was a strange thing to see: Schumer was at the barricades, but Schumer was not really a barricades kind of guy. \u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about here is life and death for so many people,\u201d he intoned, and waved his arm in the direction of the Statue of Liberty, glinting in the distance over his shoulder. \u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about here is that beautiful lady in the harbor  \u2014   and what America is all about. \u201d Schumer\u2019s presence at the rally suggested just how quickly, and definitively, the politics of the moment had been settled. In the week since the Women\u2019s March, Trump\u2019s executive orders had confirmed liberals\u2019 worst fears of his intentions and the helplessness of congressional Democrats to stand in his way. And by the end of that week all four cabinet appointees under consideration  \u2014   Mattis Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly Mike Pompeo, director of the Central Intelligence Agency and Nikki Haley, ambassador to the United Nations  \u2014   sailed through their confirmation votes with no serious opposition. Schumer, in particular, had become a target of outrage. He had not only declined to rally his caucus against the cabinet nominees, but he had also voted for all four of them himself. As he was speaking, I heard a burst of effusive applause and cries of \u201cSenator! Senator!\u201d coming from behind me. I turned and saw, gliding through the scrum in the direction of the stage, the bald dome of Cory Booker\u2019s head. He was beaming, obliging fans with   and back slaps. By some measures, Booker\u2019s voting record in the Senate placed him a couple of clicks to the right of Schumer. But Booker voted no on Kelly and Pompeo, and Schumer did not. Booker was at the airport protests the night before, and Schumer was not. \u201cMy middle name is Ellis  \u2014   Charles Ellis Schumer,\u201d Schumer was saying. \u201cI was named after Uncle Ellis, who was named after Ellis Island. I named my daughter\u2019s middle name Emma, after Emma Lazarus, and what she said 100 years ago that\u2019s emblazoned on that beautiful statue  \u2014   \u201d \u201cVote no on Sessions!\u201d a handful of people around me were chanting now. Jeff Sessions, Schumer\u2019s Senate colleague, would be up for a confirmation vote as attorney general the following week. \u201cGive me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to be free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore  \u2014   \u201d \u201cChuck loves Trump! Chuck loves Trump!\u201d the hecklers chanted. \u201cDon\u2019t vote for one of them!\u201d a woman next to me yelled. After Schumer yielded the stage to Gillibrand  \u2014   \u201cShe voted no!\u201d another woman near me shouted approvingly  \u2014   he started making his way through the crowd, right into what happened to be a particularly dense pocket of his detractors. \u201cPut \u2019em up, everybody!\u201d he said, grinning, offering his hands for  . \u201cPut \u2019em up for our immigrants!\u201d \u201cVote no, Senator,\u201d someone yelled. \u201cVote no!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m no on DeVos,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cNo on Tillerson. No on Mulvaney. No on Carson. No on Mnuchin. No on all of them!\u201d (He had, in fact, already announced he was voting against Betsy DeVos, Rex Tillerson and Mick Mulvaney  \u2014   the prospective secretaries of education and state and head of the Office of Management and Budget, respectively.) \u201cWhy did you confirm Haley and Mattis?\u201d someone demanded. \u201cGrow a spine, Chuck!\u201d a   trimly mustachioed man screamed, practically in Schumer\u2019s ear, his voice cracking: \u201cGrow a spiiiiiiiine!\u201d A scruffy young man, perched in the crook of a tree, began leading a chant: \u201cGrow a spine, Chuck! You must obstruct!\u201d Schumer is one of those politicians who seem to feed on the attention of a crowd, even a largely hostile one, and he pressed on gamely, smiling and shaking hands, pointing in the direction of the occasional familiar face: \u201cHey Dave, nice to see you!\u201d He was almost out to the street, the crowd around him thinning, when a   woman in a \u201cpussy hat\u201d called out, in a Brooklyn accent nearly as thick as Schumer\u2019s, \u201cWhat about the first four votes?\u201d Schumer stopped, a hint of a smile on his face, as if intrigued by the specificity of the harangue. \u201cWould you have voted against Mattis?\u201d he asked. \u201cEverything they do. \u201d \u201cHe\u2019s the only one who came out against torture. \u201d \u201cSo it\u2019s a defensive vote?\u201d \u201cYeah. \u201d \u201cSo we\u2019re going to keep figuring out who\u2019s a relief?\u201d \u201cNo, no, no  \u2014   all the other bad ones, we\u2019re going against. \u201d He swept off up the block with his aides, a man trying to figure out how to be reasonable in deeply unreasonable times. The next cabinet vote, as it happened, was for DeVos, a nominee whom Democrats considered as vulnerable as she was objectionable. In   Schumer wrote to McConnell demanding that certain conditions be met  \u2014   only two cabinet votes a week, and all background checks by the Office of Government Ethics completed before the confirmation hearings  \u2014   or else he would lead his caucus in opposing eight of the nominees, including DeVos. Two Republicans, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, had announced their opposition to DeVos. One more no vote would sink the nomination. The Democrats called for an   marathon debate of DeVos\u2019s nomination leading up to the vote on Feb. 7. It wasn\u2019t a filibuster  \u2014   Reid had done away with those for cabinet nominees in 2013  \u2014   but a kind of  : an effort to draw attention to the vote in hopes of further overloading the Senate office buildings\u2019 phone lines and nudging off the fence one of several Republican senators who had been identified, perhaps wishfully, as potentially persuadable. It was also an unsubtle challenge to Senate Democrats: the first moment since the airport protests for the party to stand up and stand together. As they held the floor Monday night and through the early hours of Tuesday, the senators stood in front of the   cameras and read off messages from constituents, urging them to send more to their Republican colleagues before the noon vote. By Monday evening the hashtag #HoldTheFloor was trending on Twitter, accompanied by emoji of praying hands, by inspirational quotes, by photos of Nelson Mandela or of Hodor from \u201cGame of Thrones. \u201d It was odd, amid the online clamor, to arrive at the Capitol shortly before 2 a. m. and find it   quiet, nearly empty. The Democratic senators filed in one at a time, spoke for an hour to the rotating crew of stenographers and left. Brian Schatz, a young senator from Hawaii, was waiting for his turn to speak and checking Twitter on his phone. He had voted for the first four nominees but then loudly declaimed against others. Shortly after the travel ban, he tweeted: \u201cI\u2019ve never been a     guy. But I do think it\u2019s time to march on the street. \u201d After an hour, the camera cut away, and a mildly   Tim Kaine ambled onto the floor to take his turn. \u201cTimmy!\u201d Schatz exclaimed. \u201cAre you going to speak for, like, an hour without notes?\u201d Kaine grinned. \u201cI\u2019ve got three pages,\u201d he said. The Senate chamber has the oxygenated,   atmosphere of a casino on a slow night, the same woozy contextlessness. Sitting in the   press gallery as the clock inched toward 4 a. m. I began to have the strange sensation of not knowing exactly what I was watching. The Democrats, it was clear by then, would lose this fight. But the point of the fight was to show that they would fight, to generate the affirming images and video clips that were cascading through   social media, demonstrations of the efficacy of a resistance whose   prospects rested largely on the impression that Democratic lawmakers were hearing, and responding to, its demands. \u201cFourteen Democrats voted for Mike Pompeo,\u201d Ezra Levin, the Indivisible Guide   told me. \u201cThis was a man who slandered Muslims, was open to torture, and 14 Democrats voted for him! That\u2019s why you saw people outside Dianne Feinstein\u2019s office, outside of Schumer\u2019s office, Amy Klobuchar\u2019s office. The base wants them to stand on principle. In the two weeks between Pompeo and DeVos, there were massive protests. And zero Democrats voted for DeVos. Pompeo was an awful pick DeVos was an awful pick. The thing that changed was not the degree of their awfulness, it was that people stood up. \u201d The next day, at a confirmation hearing for Jeff Sessions, Elizabeth Warren read from a letter that Coretta Scott King wrote in 1986 opposing his judicial appointment, prompting McConnell to censure her with an obscure procedural rule. McConnell\u2019s justification  \u2014   \u201cShe was warned she was given an explanation nevertheless, she persisted\u201d  \u2014   quickly evolved into a rallying cry, prompting nearly twice as many Google searches for Warren\u2019s name as her election to the Senate did in 2012. In the next 24 hours, members of the   organization MoveOn raised $300, 000 for her 2018   campaign, and Sessions was confirmed as the attorney general of the United States. Who could claim this as a victory? Trump? Warren? Both of them? By   spirits in Democratic Washington had palpably lifted. You wouldn\u2019t have described the mood as triumphal it was more as if everyone had emerged from the basement after a tornado to discover that, while the car was upside down somewhere, at least the house was still standing. The travel ban remained marooned, at least temporarily, in the courts. (A redrafted executive order was issued on March 6, but it was unclear if it had fully resolved the legal issues of the first.) Trump\u2019s nominee for labor secretary, the   C. E. O. Andrew Puzder, backed out of consideration for the job in   after the Republicans concluded that they did not have the votes to confirm him. The project of doing away with the Affordable Care Act was still tied up in committee amid disagreements among the Republicans themselves  \u2014   an inevitable consequence, perhaps, of their      opposition effort that the Democrats were now studying. And the infrastructure bill that had threatened to divide Democrats against themselves never materialized there was talk now of it being pushed back to 2018. On Feb. 28, a few hours before Trump was due to give his first speech to Congress, I went to see Schumer in the minority leader\u2019s chambers in the Capitol. The senator was sitting in a leather wingback chair in his shirt sleeves, and he seemed to be in a genuinely upbeat mood. \u201cThings look much better for us and much worse for him than I ever imagined based on the first month,\u201d he told me. The day before, three Republican senators  \u2014   Ted Cruz, Mike Lee and Rand Paul  \u2014   had held out for nothing less than full repeal of the Affordable Care Act. \u201cThat\u2019s the three votes they need, even with 52!\u201d Schumer crowed. (The following week, a replacement bill finally began to advance through committees in the House of Representatives, but Paul declared in a Fox News interview that it would be \u201cdead on arrival\u201d in the Senate.) He pointed to the crowds that Indivisible and other groups had turned out in the thousands at town halls across the country the previous week. \u201cTrump is the enemy, and his Republican acolytes  \u2014   not Democrats,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re already beginning to coalesce around that. It was very positive. They throw a few brickbats, fine. This energy is enormous. \u201d But even as a sort of guarded optimism set in among many Democrats, there was a gloom among the party\u2019s left flank that appeared nearly as thick as it was in November  \u2014   a sense that the party, buoyed by the easy gratification of opposition, was punting on resolving difficult questions, at its own peril. Just before visiting Schumer, I went to see Bernie Sanders in his Capitol Hill office. In a couple of hours, the Vermont senator\u2019s colleagues would be gathering in Senate dining room to share a meal  \u2014   a bipartisan tradition before presidential speeches to Congress. But Sanders did not intend to be among them. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to skip the dinner tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not in a very convivial mood. I don\u2019t want to pretend. These are very, to my mind, frightening times. \u201d Since ending his presidential campaign in July, Sanders, who caucuses with the Democrats in the Senate, had been managing the complicated task of redirecting the movement that materialized around his candidacy toward a Democratic Party with which he had a tetchy relationship. Schumer had created a post for him in the party\u2019s Senate leadership, and Sanders had helped mobilize his   network for two rounds of rallies in defense of the Affordable Care Act. But earlier in the week, he said in a CNN interview that \u201ca total transformation of the Democratic Party\u201d was still in order, and that he had also not yet given the D. N. C.  \u2014   which he called the \u201cestablishment\u2019s house\u201d  \u2014   access to his campaign email list. \u201cIt\u2019s not some magical system,\u201d Sanders told me, disdain dripping off the word \u201cmagical. \u201d \u201cHow do we bring in, how do you raise money from, those people? You know what? You\u2019ve got to stand for something. \u201d I asked him if he thought the Democratic Party knew what it stood for. \u201cYou\u2019re asking a good question, and I can\u2019t give you a definitive answer,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly there are some people in the Democratic Party who want to maintain the status quo. They would rather go down with the Titanic so long as they have   seats. \u201d In early February, Elizabeth Warren, in a speech to the Congressional Progressive Caucus, warned that while the Democrats were fashioning themselves into an opposition party, that was not enough to solve the problems that put them in the position of becoming an opposition party in the first place. \u201cMen like Donald Trump come to power when their countries are already in deep trouble,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are some in the Democratic Party who urge caution. They say this is a tactical problem: \u2018We need better data. We need better social media. We need better outreach. We need better talking points.\u2019 Better talking points? Are you kidding me? People were so desperate for economic change in this country that Donald Trump was just inaugurated as president, and people think we need better talking points? What alternative planet are they living on?\u201d When I met Warren a few weeks later, I asked her about the speech, and whether the postelection unity that Trump provided the Democratic Party made her ambitions to reform it easier or harder to realize. \u201cI think it has reminded Democrats we need to run on our values,\u201d she replied, parrying the question. \u201cBecause our values are more in line with most of America. \u201d If you squinted at the bodies packing the streets and the town halls, though, the picture looked an awful lot like the recent past: Here were people drawn together in defense of liberal immigration and refugee policies, reproductive rights, civil liberties and preserving Obama\u2019s policy legacy, and in opposition to a president who was moving against all those things. These were last year\u2019s arguments, only louder. If Trump, as president, seemed unable to let go of his 2016 campaign, the Democrats seemed like they were acting out an improved version of their own  \u2014   the crowds bigger and more unified, the stakes more clearly understood. \u201cThere\u2019s more enthusiasm, more energy, more passion now than there was at any point in the 2016 campaign  \u2014   which is both heartening and discouraging, all at the same time,\u201d Guy Cecil, the chairman of Priorities USA, the largest Democratic super PAC, told me. \u201c\u2019u200bI think that\u2019s what a lot of us are seeing and feeling. And we\u2019re trying to figure out the right way for us to respond to it. \u201d For now, the question was how far \u201cNo\u201d could carry the Democrats. The Indivisible Guide, in the three months since Levin first posted the Google Doc, had birthed the organization he and his colleagues had not intended to start, with Levin as the executive director. It had registered more than 5, 800 local affiliate groups, at least two in each of the country\u2019s 435 congressional districts. In February, Priorities USA, which raised $192 million to support Clinton in 2016, announced it was reorienting itself to support   organizing  \u2014   including an investment in online advertising driving people to the Indivisible Guide\u2019s website listing congressional members\u2019 town halls. Schumer, meanwhile, was planning to lead the Democrats against Neil Gorsuch\u2019s Supreme Court nomination, forcing the Republicans to find 60 votes or get rid of the filibuster. If Republicans tried to gut federal funding for Planned Parenthood in a forthcoming budget bill, he told me, he was perfectly willing to filibuster that too. \u201cI think McConnell and Ryan know they can\u2019t shut down the government,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause they\u2019re in charge now. \u201d And Schumer, precisely no one\u2019s idea of a revolutionary, was now, at least in a narrow constitutional sense, the leader of the resistance. On my way out of his new office, I noticed a green marble fireplace and asked him if he\u2019d used it yet. \u201cOh, man,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s my favorite perk. I live in Brooklyn  \u2014   I never had a fireplace. I\u2019m learning to start fires. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564105.399282}
