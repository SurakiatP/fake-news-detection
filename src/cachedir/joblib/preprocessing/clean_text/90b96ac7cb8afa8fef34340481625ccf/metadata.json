Through it all, through his ugly caricatures of Mexicans and Muslims, through her pretzel contortions to explain her emails, through the Russian hacking and the 3 a. m. Twitter rants and the rest, this was always going to be a \u201chold your nose and vote\u201d election. But at Tommy\u2019s Diner, a colorful Columbus institution in a   neighborhood once known as The Bottoms, \u201chold your nose and vote\u201d is giving way, for some people, to \u201chold your nose and don\u2019t vote. \u201d The distaste for the presidential election is obvious almost anywhere you look here in the capital of a swing state where in July 2015 Gov. John Kasich of Ohio (remember him?) became the 16th of 17 Republicans who hoped to succeed President Obama. Aaron Burnside, 23, a   law student at Ohio State University, was at the student union that day, listening with optimism as Mr. Kasich declared that \u201cthe sun is rising\u201d in America  \u2014   words that now seem so quaint. Never for a minute did Mr. Burnside, who described himself as a \u201c   fiscally conservative, socially liberal\u201d Republican, imagine himself not casting a ballot on Election Day. But on Thursday, with early voting underway here and Mr. Trump and President Obama in town, Mr. Burnside had no idea whether he would vote for president. \u201cIt depends on how I feel that morning,\u201d he said. He will go to the polls  \u2014   it\u2019s his civic duty  \u2014   to back his party in   races Senator Rob Portman, a Republican, is fending off a challenge from Ted Strickland, a Democrat and former governor. Mrs. Clinton seems too far to the left for him, he said never a Trump fan, he found the Republican nominee\u2019s vulgar boasts of grabbing women\u2019s genitals \u201cdisgusting. \u201d So he feels stuck, as do many voters. As early voting begins in Ohio and elsewhere, many Americans are approaching the election with a sense of dread. In a CBS News poll released earlier this month, just 46 percent of likely voters said they were very enthusiastic about going to the polls, down from 62 percent in late October 2012, according to a New York   News poll. What\u2019s uncertain this year is how many people will cast reluctant votes and how many won\u2019t vote at all. At the diner, Tommy is a gregarious Greek immigrant and American citizen named Tom Pappas, who loves politics but keeps his business nonpartisan. The walls are covered with photos of Democrats and Republicans in equal numbers, and of Elvis Presley, Marilyn Monroe, Tommy\u2019s grandchildren and Ohio State football stars. Mr. Pappas, 63, and his wife Kathy, 57, have owned the diner for 28 years. Kathy Pappas, who bakes the baklava and bread pudding, pays little heed to politics (she leaves that to Tommy) but this year finds it impossible to escape. \u201cI turn on the radio, looking for the traffic or the weather,\u201d she said, \u201cand what do they talk about?\u201d Mrs. Pappas said she has always voted. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to this year,\u201d she said. \u201cI just don\u2019t care for either one, and I don\u2019t trust either one. There\u2019s just not a good feeling either way you look, and that\u2019s sad. \u201d Every day 400 to 500 people pass through Tommy\u2019s customers run the gamut. Breakfast on Thursday brought a group of retirees,   white men in red   who had spent the morning building tables and chairs at a furniture bank for the needy two retired social studies teachers with their daughter, an acupuncturist (also an herbalist) and her boyfriend, a tattoo artist a group of bus drivers a retired firefighter, plus the usual smattering of lawyers and state workers. The acupuncturist, Keri Ondrus, 31, has given up on voting altogether she has taught English in Costa Rica, and was involved in the Occupy Wall Street movement, describing herself as a \u201ctotal idealist\u201d and \u2018\u2018anarchist\u2019\u2019 who feels there must be another way to repair the world. Her parents, Charlotte and Bill Ondrus, the retired teachers, will vote for Mrs. Clinton. \u201cYou guys are not enthusiastic about Hillary,\u201d their daughter said. \u201cI know,\u201d her mother replied, \u201cbut I\u2019m scared to death of Donald Trump. \u201d Lunchtime brought a    team of bail bondsmen an Air Force veteran and gun rights enthusiast wearing one of Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d ball caps and a   pistol in a sleek, black Velcro case on his belt and a   young     artists, preparing for a show at Wright State University in Dayton. \u201cWhy would I waste my time?\u201d Kyle Steed, 23, a composer with the group, said of voting, adding that he would rather spend his time helping the homeless as a volunteer. His friend Shamere Griffin, 21, another of the artists, shook her head wordlessly, seeming to fight back tears. She said she could never vote for Mr. Trump, given his characterizations of blacks, Muslims, Mexicans and women. She wants an America in which she doesn\u2019t have to remind \u201cmy little brother, when he walks down the street, to walk with his hood down,\u201d and has no confidence that Mrs. Clinton can deliver that. She will stay home. \u201cLet\u2019s just be real,\u201d Ms. Griffin said. \u201cWhat has she done for us? That\u2019s what I want to know. What has she done for my people?\u201d Ohio is politically engaged in 2012, when President Obama ran against Mitt Romney, 70. 5 percent of registered voters cast ballots, compared with 57. 5 percent nationwide, and one in three voted early. Some election offices reported long lines when early voting began here Wednesday David Pepper, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, called Mr. Trump a \u201cturnout machine\u201d for Democrats. But an   Street Journal poll released Thursday  \u2014   and conducted after the emergence of a videotape showing Mr. Trump saying he groped women  \u2014   found the Ohio race virtually tied. \u201cI\u2019m very motivated,\u201d declared Robert Tannous, a    lawyer in a dark blue suit, as he navigated his way around a waitress during the lunchtime rush. Motivated to vote for whom? \u201cHillary Clinton,\u201d Mr. Tannous said. \u201cAnd the sad thing is, I\u2019m a lifelong Republican. \u201d George Wolf, a 73, a retired firefighter who owns a small heating and air conditioning business here, comes to Tommy\u2019s every morning for the crispy corned beef and a dose of friendship. A longtime Republican, he says he \u201ccannot allow Hillary Clinton to get in,\u201d and proceeds to tick off the reasons. \u201cWhen you mention Benghazi, I get really upset,\u201d he said, referring to the 2012 attack on a United States diplomatic mission in Libya. \u201cFour people died she doesn\u2019t seem to care. \u201d Then there are her emails. And her paid speeches: \u201cI just don\u2019t like the fact that a politician is out to make money,\u201d Mr. Wolf said, adding that he would vote for Mr. Trump, which he views as better than not voting at all. He does not feel good about it. \u201cHe went bankrupt as a   man, that doesn\u2019t help me pay my bills,\u201d said Mr. Wolf, who added that he did not like Mr. Trump\u2019s nasty nicknames  \u2014   \u201cCrooked Hillary,\u201d for example. \u201cThat\u2019s a child talking,\u201d Mr. Wolf said. He backed Mr. Kasich in the primary, but came around to Mr. Trump after the Ohio governor dropped out of the race. Roughly a third of all Clinton and Trump backers say the main reason for their choice is that they oppose the other candidate, a recent Pew Research Center survey found. Millennial voters, ages 18 to 29, are especially discouraged and looking for a political outsider who can inspire them  \u2014   one reason they rallied around Mrs. Clinton\u2019s primary opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Picking at his chili and   sandwich, Mr. Burnside sounded absolutely deflated. His dining partner was his mentor, Steve Fitch, 68, a Clinton supporter. They were talking about Mr. Fitch\u2019s work as a commercial litigator Mr. Burnside was seeking guidance on how he could use a career in law to \u201cresolve conflicts. \u201d The 2016 campaign seemed antithetical to the younger man\u2019s dreams. Mr. Burnside was asked if he ever thought about that. \u201cOh,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the time. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562030.817722}
