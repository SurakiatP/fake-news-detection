Black drivers in Ferguson, Mo. searched much more frequently than whites. Cleveland residents punched and kicked by officers and subjected to stun guns, without posing any threat. In report after report in the Obama years, Justice Department lawyers found patterns of   rights violations and used them as leverage to force local departments to agree to major policing overhauls. But the Trump administration announced this week that it was backing away from that   approach, a move that prompted fierce debate on Tuesday in cities across the country. Many police unions welcomed the news, saying the Obama administration\u2019s approach had impeded law enforcement and unfairly painted many good officers as wrongdoers. The unions, a source of support for President Trump during last year\u2019s campaign, welcomed his administration\u2019s announcement as proof that Mr. Trump would swiftly meet his promises to restore \u201claw and order\u201d to the country. But their view contrasted sharply with those of many police chiefs and politicians who have been living under agreements struck with the Justice Department, who vowed to continue making changes to their police departments with or without the department\u2019s imprimatur. They say that the results of consent decrees, which are backed by a court order, and   memorandums of agreement, which are reached out of court, have been mostly positive, if mixed, and in some cases absolutely essential. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has said he doubts whether federal intervention in local departments is useful or appropriate, ordered a review of those agreements and has signaled his resistance to new ones. In a March 31 memo, he assigned the task to the new deputy attorney general and associate attorney general, who are awaiting confirmation. It is not clear whether Mr. Sessions will seek early termination of agreements in effect in places like Cleveland New Orleans Ferguson, Mo. Albuquerque and Maricopa County, Ariz. The agreements, which usually expire after five years, mandate changes in training and policies like supervision, reporting contacts with the public, conducting searches, using force,   conflict, handling people with mental illnesses, and race relations. \u201cWhat Attorney General Sessions did, I think that\u2019s just President Trump following through on his promise to help law enforcement,\u201d said Stephen Loomis, president of the Cleveland Police Patrolmen\u2019s Association. \u201cAnd   citizens are going to benefit from it. \u201d Police unions, individual officers and conservatives often interpret criticism of police practices  \u2014   whether from Black Lives Matter protesters, Justice Department lawyers or former President Barack Obama  \u2014   as hostility to the police. They argue that the kinds of changes demanded by the department actually hinder policing by hurting morale and making officers less aggressive, a claim that many criminologists dispute. During the campaign, Mr. Trump picked up that theme and repeatedly referred to a major surge in violent crime  \u2014   though, in fact, crime in recent years has been at some of the lowest levels ever recorded. He was endorsed by a number of law enforcement organizations, including the national Fraternal Order of Police. In Chicago, where violence has soared in recent years, the city has announced a set of policy changes to address both crime and tense relations between the police and minority communities. In January, the Justice Department released a scathing report on excessive force and racial discrimination, and under Mr. Obama, a consent decree would probably have followed. On Tuesday, Ian Prior, a Justice Department spokesman, said he could not address what the department might do next in Chicago. Dean Angelo Sr. president of the Fraternal Order of Police chapter that represents Chicago officers, said their problem was not police conduct, but that \u201cthey have been demonized by political leaders and others for three years straight. \u201d Meeting last week with Mr. Sessions, \u201cI said, \u2018Our girls and guys are worried about losing their jobs for doing their job,\u2019\u201d Mr. Angelo said. \u201cAnd he goes, \u2018That\u2019s not a good thing. \u2019\u201d Shaun Willoughby, president of the Albuquerque Police Officers Association, said that the changes the city had made had improved police training, but that the consent decree created far too much paperwork for officers, limiting their policing time. And he said its restrictions on the use of force were too vague, \u201cwhich leads to officers being uncertain  \u2014   they\u2019re hesitant. \u201d But Richard J. Berry, Albuquerque\u2019s mayor, said that while he had some reservations  \u2014   like the cost of paying   monitors  \u2014   he saw the consent decree as largely positive. It may have hurt officers\u2019 morale at first, he said, but \u201ctime and experience with it is making it less of an issue. \u201d The dispute illustrates the often stark divides between    officers and the police chiefs and mayors who oversee them. For   bosses, a harsh Justice Department report and several years of court supervision can provide the political cover and authority they need to shake things up. For community activists who complain of police abuses, and who suspect that mayors and chiefs are not sincere about making changes, federal intervention offers a way to hold local agencies to their promises. Baltimore, the subject of another blistering Justice Department assessment, reached a consent decree agreement with the Obama Justice Department, but it has not yet been finalized by a federal judge, and Mr. Sessions asked the court to hold off for 90 days. The city\u2019s police commissioner, Kevin Davis, pushed back hard on Tuesday, calling the requested delay \u201ca punch in the gut to the community  \u2014   certainly to me. \u201d He suggested that Mr. Sessions was out of step not only with people in Baltimore, but with law enforcement leaders across America. Lt. Gene Ryan, president of the Fraternal Order of Police in Baltimore, said he recognized the value of the agreement  \u2014   which, among other things, would require the city to spend more on needed equipment like laptop computers in police cruisers  \u2014   but agreed with the attorney general that consent decrees were overused. Officials in cities that are subject to Justice Department agreements, or were headed in that direction under Mr. Obama, said they would continue with reforms no matter what Mr. Sessions did. \u201cThe center of gravity on police reform just shifted from Washington to cities around the country,\u201d said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, which advises departments. \u201cBut    and policing reform is not going to go away. Cities like Baltimore and Chicago still have local constituencies that are going to expect change. \u201d Still, some critics of policing are less hopeful, arguing that federal oversight is crucial to hold local leaders to their promises. In Ferguson, more than two and a half years after the police shooting of a black teenager, Michael Brown, set off weeks of unrest, \u201clife does not feel different for people,\u201d said Emily Davis, a community organizer. Ferguson has been under a consent decree since last year, she said, but \u201cthey\u2019re not treating people better. \u201d Ronal W. Serpas recalled that when he was the   police officer in New Orleans, the Justice Department investigated his department and identified problems. City leaders made some changes and promised others, and no consent degree was imposed. But Mr. Serpas left the city for nine years, and when he returned in 2010 as police superintendent, he said, he found an agency that had moved sharply backward. \u201cWhile it\u2019s fair to say that the federal government is not in the business of managing local law enforcement, they certainly are in the business of enforcing the Constitution,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if not them, who?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742563968.6281486}
