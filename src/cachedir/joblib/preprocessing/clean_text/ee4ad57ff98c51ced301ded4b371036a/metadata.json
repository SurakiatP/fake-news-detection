In 2010, the   crooner met with Obama and his national security team to \u201cdiscuss the administration\u2019s development strategy heading into the upcoming   and   meetings in Canada and September\u2019s U. N. Summit on the Millenium Development Goals. \u201d And Friday\u2019s was not the first brunch the Obamas and Bono have shared together. In June 2013, Michelle Obama and her two daughters dined with Bono, his wife, and their two sons at Finnegan\u2019s Irish Pub in Dalkey, Co Dublin. Bono, of course, has been an outspoken opponent of President Donald Trump. Two months before the presidential election, Bono called Trump \u201cpotentially the worst idea that ever happened to America. \u201d Just last month, Bono condemned the idea of a \u201cnational border\u201d as the best way to protect one\u2019s country from Islamic terror. \u201cI don\u2019t see a body of water wide enough or a wall high enough to keep these problems from our doors,\u201d the Irish rocker said before world leaders at the Munich Security Conference in Germany.
