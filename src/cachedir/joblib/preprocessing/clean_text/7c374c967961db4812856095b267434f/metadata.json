[New measures to crack down at the border were of particular focus in light of Sessions\u2019s sweeping announcements in Nogales, Arizona Tuesday. Talk also turned to Sessions\u2019 efforts to rebuild a Justice Department still largely staffed with holdover   appointees and career civil service employees, most of whom worked under the previous administration. Sessions\u2019 continued crusade against   \u201csanctuary cities\u201d made up the final portion of their conversation.  \u201cI\u2019ve been excited about progress at the border   \u2026     March was the lowest level of illegal entrants to the country in 17 years. It was 72% below the last month of the Obama Administration,\u201d Sessions relayed to Carr. Building on his statements on Fox News\u2019s Hannity, he added: I thought if we had clear leadership by the President, by our officers, and tell people please don\u2019t come illegally, if you want to come to America wait your turn. If we do that we\u2019d see a decline, and so far it\u2019s exceeded my expectation. Carr expressed his disbelief at the controversy that has arisen over Sessions\u2019 directives. \u201cYou\u2019re enforcing the law! There\u2019s nothing new here. You\u2019re just taking the federal criminal code and enforcing it,\u201d he said. Sessions was equally incredulous: It is just beyond my comprehension how we drifted so far away from the common sense notion that sovereign nations have borders and those borders should be honored   \u2026     Any country that has common sense, and almost all do, has laws that if you commit a crime while you\u2019re in the country, lawfully or unlawfully, you are to be deported. Carr moved conversation to the pace of confirmations and appointments in the Sessions DOJ. Slowed by Democratic political maneuvering like the   protracted Senate battle over   Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, Sessions\u2019 efforts to assemble a team of his choosing around him has been painfully slow. Only his choices for the number two and three spots at DOJ, Deputy Attorney General and Associate Attorney General have been received a hearing and been passed for a vote of the full Senate by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Only one other DOJ nomination has been officially taken up by the Committee, Antitrust Assistant AG nominee Makan Delrahim. Sessions told Carr that he expects his Deputy pick, Rod Rosenstein of Maryland, and his nominee for Associate AG, Rachel Brand of Iowa, to be confirmed soon, but expressed dismay over the whole process: It does appear, however, that we are further behind than normal with appointments. It looks like it will be two weeks before I get the first of my fifteen or so Senate confirmed deputies approved. Can you imagine that? The first. And he may be the first one in the entire government that\u2019s been confirmed as a deputy  \u2026    it\u2019s not good. Carr pressed Sessions on \u201cObama holdovers\u201d throughout his department, especially those in the Civil Rights Division who implemented   Assistant Attorney General Vanity Gupta\u2019s response to the Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore riots that has drawn considerable criticism on the political right. \u201cAre you trying to weed out these   people?\u201d he asked. Sessions acknowledged that career employees have always and will continue to make up of the majority of the Justice Department, but had a stern message to those who might resist the new direction at DOJ. \u201cThe President, the Attorney General set the policy, and I expect those policies to be followed. If people can\u2019t comply with the policies of this administration, they should look elsewhere. \u201d The Attorney General was hopeful at the prospects for the career   he oversees. \u201cWe\u2019re getting pretty good cooperation,\u201d he said, citing the example of career prosecutor and acting U. S. Attorney for the District of Rhode Island Stephen Dambruch, who did not shy away from revealing the immigration status of those caught in a   heroin roundup Thursday. Carr finally turned attention to a cornerstone of Sessions\u2019 nascent tenure at DOJ:   \u201csanctuary\u201d jurisdictions that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities on immigration enforcement. \u201cWe going to, um, urge, these people involved in sanctuary cities,\u201d was Sessions\u2019s suggestive reply. \u201cThe law says if somebody commits a crime in Boston or New Hampshire, they\u2019re to be deported if they\u2019re here unlawfully   \u2026     why cities would block that and keep criminals in their cities is beyond me. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562394.4221117}
