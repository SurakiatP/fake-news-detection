That\u2019s put in jeopardy when abuse and harassment stifle and silence those voices. We won\u2019t tolerate it and we\u2019re launching new efforts to stop it. \u201d \u201cBuilding on the work we began in November, we\u2019re continuing to work on ways to give people more control over what they see on Twitter,\u201d they continued. \u201cLast week, we introduced an improvement to reporting abusive Tweets that gives people experiencing targeted harassment more ways to report it. Today, we\u2019re announcing three changes: stopping the creation of new abusive accounts, bringing forward safer search results, and collapsing potentially abusive or   Tweets. \u201d \u201cSafer search results\u201d will work by removing \u201csensitive\u201d tweets and tweets from blocked and muted users from your searches on the platform, while their new collapsing system will hide a large quantity of replies on your tweets. Twitter does not explain what qualifies a tweet for being deemed \u201csensitive,\u201d and while it says \u201cthis type of content will be discoverable if you want to find it,\u201d it doesn\u2019t say how since \u201cit won\u2019t clutter search results any longer. \u201d Twitter has also not yet explained how they will combat the creation of new accounts from suspended users. \u201cIn the days and weeks ahead, we will continue to roll out product changes  \u2014   some changes will be visible and some less so  \u2014   and will update you on progress every step of the way,\u201d concluded Twitter in their post. \u201cWith every change, we\u2019ll learn, iterate, and continue to move at this speed until we\u2019ve made a significant impact that people can feel. \u201d The platform has introduced numerous other attempts to combat \u201charassment\u201d and \u201chate speech\u201d over the past few years, including a word filtering tool inspired by the   Twitter alternative Gab. Twitter, who recently donated $1. 6 million to the ACLU, has repeatedly been accused of censoring conservative and libertarian accounts over the past few years, with numerous   users having been permanently suspended from the platform. Breitbart Senior Editor MILO, Pharmaceutical Entrepreneur Martin Shkreli, and rapper Azealia Banks have all been permanently suspended from the platform, while others have been temporarily suspended following political remarks. Despite the sanctioning of   accounts, numerous abusive users have been allowed to stay on Twitter. In July, Twitter refused to sanction an account that sexually harassed and sent violent threats to a female Breitbart News contributor, while rapper Talib Kweli was able to repeatedly call numerous black conservatives \u201ccoons,\u201d including Breitbart\u2019s Jerome Hudson, Sheriff David Clarke, and   activist Maajid Nawaz, without suspension. Threats against the president have also been repeatedly allowed on Twitter, with over 12, 000 tweets calling for the assassination of President Trump having been made since he took office on January 20.
