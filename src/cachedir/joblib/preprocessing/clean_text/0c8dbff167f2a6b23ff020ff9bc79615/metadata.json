Julian Cook lost contact with former housemate Martin Bishop for over eight years ago, during which time Bishop has become a money-obsessed macho twat who thinks he is the bollocks. Office worker Cook said: \u201cInstead of talking about old times he kept asking me what sort of car I have. \u201cThen he blathered on about \u2018taking home serious Ks\u2019 from \u2018folio development resales\u2019, assuming I knew what that meant because otherwise I would not be a proper man. \u201cThe worst bit was when he told me about some fringe political group he\u2019s into called Libertarian England. No, actually it was when he said \u2018pussy alert\u2019 when a woman walked past. \u201cHe probably just works and socialises with dipshits, but I wouldn\u2019t rule out one of those injuries that turns you into a psychopath. Maybe he fell off a raft at a team-building weekend and hit his head on the riverbed. \u201cWe parted on friendly terms but now he wants me to join his \u2018weights oriented gym\u2019 and go to a lapdancing club, which is odd because he used to be into Star Trek Generations .\u201d \\nShare:'"}, "time": 1742561751.7186658}
