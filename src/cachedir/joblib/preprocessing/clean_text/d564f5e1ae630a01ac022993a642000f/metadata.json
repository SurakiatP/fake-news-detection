Livid British officials adamantly denied the allegation and secured promises from senior White House officials never to repeat it. But a defiant Mr. Trump refused to back down, making clear that the White House had nothing to retract or apologize for because his spokesman had simply repeated an assertion made by a Fox News commentator. Fox itself later disavowed the report. The rupture with London was Mr. Trump\u2019s latest quarrel with an ally or foreign power since taking office. Mexico\u2019s president angrily canceled a White House visit in January over Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed border wall. A telephone call with Australia\u2019s prime minister ended abruptly amid a dispute over refugees. Sweden bristled over Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism of its refugee policy. And China refused for weeks to engage with Mr. Trump because of his postelection call with Taiwan\u2019s president. Mr. Trump\u2019s strained relations with Europe, which has viewed his ascension to power with trepidation, were fully on display on Friday, not just in the British spy flap but also in the venue in which it was addressed. The president was hosting for the first time Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who is seen by many Europeans as the most important champion of the liberal international order. Though polite, the two leaders seemed stiff and distant during their public appearances. European news outlets and social media made much of the fact that she suggested a handshake for photographers in the Oval Office and he did not respond, although it appeared that he did not hear her. Either way, the two were clearly on separate pages on issues like immigration and trade. The angry response from Britain stemmed from Mr. Trump\u2019s persistence in accusing Mr. Obama of tapping his phones last year despite the lack of evidence and    denials. At a briefing on Thursday, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, read from a sheaf of news clippings that he suggested bolstered the president\u2019s claim. Among them was an assertion by Andrew Napolitano, a Fox News commentator, that Mr. Obama had used Britain\u2019s Government Communications Headquarters, the agency known as the GCHQ, to spy on Mr. Trump. In response to Mr. Spicer, the agency quickly denied it as \u201cnonsense\u201d and \u201cutterly ridiculous,\u201d while British officials contacted American counterparts to complain. \u201cWe said nothing,\u201d Mr. Trump told a German reporter who asked about the matter at a news conference with Ms. Merkel. \u201cAll we did was quote a certain very talented legal mind who was the one responsible for saying that on television. I didn\u2019t make an opinion on it. \u201d He added: \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be talking to me. You should be talking to Fox. \u201d The president tried making a joke about it, turning to Ms. Merkel, who was angered during Mr. Obama\u2019s administration by reports that the National Security Agency had tapped her cellphone and those of other leaders. \u201cAt least we have something in common, perhaps,\u201d Mr. Trump said. She made a face that suggested she had no interest in getting involved. After the news conference, Mr. Spicer echoed Mr. Trump\u2019s unapologetic tone. \u201cI don\u2019t think we regret anything,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cAs the president said, I was just reading off media reports. \u201d Shortly afterward, Fox backed off Mr. Napolitano\u2019s claim. \u201cFox News cannot confirm Judge Napolitano\u2019s commentary,\u201d the anchor Shepard Smith said on air. \u201cFox News knows of no evidence of any kind that the now president of the United States was surveilled at any time, any way. Full stop. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s unremorseful tenor further stunned British officials, who thought they had managed to contain the matter. Kim Darroch, the British ambassador to the United States, had raised the matter on Thursday night with Mr. Spicer at a St. Patrick\u2019s Day reception in Washington. Mark Lyall Grant, the national security adviser to Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, had contacted his American counterpart, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster. On Friday morning, a spokesman for Mrs. May said the White House had backed off the allegation. \u201cWe\u2019ve made clear to the administration that these claims are ridiculous and should be ignored,\u201d the spokesman said, on the condition of anonymity in keeping with British protocol. \u201cWe\u2019ve received assurances these allegations won\u2019t be repeated. \u201d But White House officials, who also requested anonymity, said Mr. Spicer had offered no regret to the ambassador. \u201cHe didn\u2019t apologize, no way, no how,\u201d a senior West Wing official said. The officials said they did not know whether General McMaster had apologized. The furor underscored the continuing troubles for the White House since Mr. Trump first accused Mr. Obama of tapping his phones, an allegation refuted by intelligence agencies as well as Republican and Democratic officials. Even as Mr. Trump refused to back down, fellow Republicans appeared increasingly irritated by what they see as a distraction from their policy goals. Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma said on Friday that Mr. Trump had not proved his case and should apologize to Mr. Obama. \u201cFrankly, unless you can produce some pretty compelling truth, I think President Obama is owed an apology,\u201d Mr. Cole told reporters. \u201cIf he didn\u2019t do it, we shouldn\u2019t be reckless in accusations that he did. \u201d The conspiracy theorizing also tested what is often called the special relationship between the United States and Britain. American intelligence agencies enjoy a closer collaboration with their British counterparts than any other in the world. GCHQ was the first agency to warn the United States government that Russia was hacking Democratic Party emails during the presidential campaign. Foreign policy analysts expressed astonishment that Mr. Trump would so cavalierly endanger that partnership. \u201cIt illustrates the extent to which the White House really doesn\u2019t care what damage they do to crucial relationships in order to avoid admitting their dishonesty,\u201d said Kori Schake, a former national security aide to President George W. Bush now at Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution. \u201cAmerica\u2019s allies are having to protect themselves against being tarred with the White House\u2019s mendacity. \u201d Eric S. Edelman, an under secretary of defense under Mr. Bush, has written about the stresses between the United States and Britain in recent years. \u201cI hope that this latest episode doesn\u2019t drive a stake through the heart of the strongest remaining element of   partnership,\u201d he said. Julianne Smith, who was a deputy national security adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said Mr. Trump did not appear to realize how much American intelligence agencies depend on Britain in dealing with threats around the world. \u201cHe will probably live to see the day when he will regret firing off such an egregious insult to Britain and then failing to apologize for it,\u201d she said. The issue clearly touched a nerve at GCHQ, which usually refuses to comment on intelligence matters. Its vehement response surprised British officials and analysts. Dominic Grieve, the intelligence committee chairman in Parliament, pointed to elaborate safeguards that prevent spying on the United States and require \u201ca valid national security purpose\u201d for any monitoring. \u201cIt is inconceivable that those legal requirements could be met in the circumstances described,\u201d he said. Tim Farron, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, the junior partner in the last British coalition government, described Mr. Spicer\u2019s repetition of the claims as \u201cshameful\u201d and said Mr. Trump was \u201ccompromising the vital U. K. . S. security relationship to try to cover his own embarrassment. \u201d Downing Street evidently wanted to avoid adding to any embarrassment in Washington while making it clear that Britain had no part in any such wiretapping. But in rebuffing that effort, Mr. Trump showed that Mrs. May, who was the first foreign leader to visit the White House after his inauguration, may not have forged the bond she had hoped, analysts said. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to have a good meeting with Trump,\u201d said Jeremy Shapiro, a former State Department official who is the research director at the European Council on Foreign Relations in London. \u201cHe\u2019s very pleasant in person. He\u2019ll promise you the world. And 48 hours later, he\u2019ll betray you without a thought. He won\u2019t even know he\u2019ll be betraying you. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561959.308811}
