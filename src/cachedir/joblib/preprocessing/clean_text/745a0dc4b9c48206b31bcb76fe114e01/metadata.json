UKIP MEPs Steven Woolfe & Mike Hookem reported to French police over Strasbourg scuffle By 0 61 \\nMEPs Steven Woolfe and Mike Hookem have been reported to French police over an altercation at the EU\u2019s Strasbourg parliament, which saw Woolfe hospitalized and plunged crisis-hit UKIP into further turmoil. \\nEuropean Parliament President Martin Schulz said he had referred the \u201cregrettable\u201d incident to the French authorities \u201cgiven the seriousness of the reported facts and their possible criminal implications.\u201d \\nSchulz says he had been recommended to do so by the European Parliament\u2019s advisory committee on conduct, according to the Press Association. Following recommendation of EP Advisory Committee on Code of Conduct, I referred incident involving MEPs Hookem and Woolfe to FR authorities \\n\u2014 EP President (@EP_President) October 26, 2016 Based on the result of the investigations, I will then take a decision about sanctions to be imposed according to EP rules \\n\u2014 EP President (@EP_President) October 26, 2016 \\n\u201cThe committee concluded that the versions of the facts given by the two members involved diverged substantially and the facts seem to have happened in the absence of direct witnesses,\u201d he told the parliament. \\nRead more \\n\u201cIt also stressed that given the seriousness of the reported facts and their possible criminal implications, further evidence is needed to clarify this matter. \\n\u201cAs a result I have decided to follow the recommendation of the advisory committee and I have referred this matter to the competent French authorities. \\n\u201cBased on the result of the investigations, I will then take a decision about a sanction to be imposed.\u201d Hookem off the hook \\nAn internal investigation by UKIP published on Wednesday afternoon ruled Hookem should not be held responsible for the altercation. \\n\u201c In the absence of eye witnesses, the true facts of what took place in the ante room itself are impossible to determine and neither man has made an official complaint to the party over the incident. \u201d \\nDespite the ruling, party investigators went into a detailed hypothesis as to what took place in the ante room between Hookem and Woolfe. The only thing it determines with any certainty is that \u201c the door was open prior to Mr Woofle\u2019s fall. \u201d \\nThe investigation concludes Hookem was not close enough to the ante room door to open it himself, and so it is \u201c reasonable to assume that Mr Woolf opened the door whilst attempting to exit the ante room backwards. \u201d \\n\u201c The investigation does find it unlikely that Hookem was in a position to be able to push Woolfe through the door, given where he was standing in the ante room immediately afterwards, but in the absence of an eye witness, it cannot make a definite determination .\u201d \\nWhile the report lets Hookem off the hook, it actually finds a series of quotes given by Woolfe to the Daily Mail earlier this month to have brought the party into \u201c disrepute .\u201d \\n\u201c Had Mr Woolfe continued his membership of the party, a disciplinary panel would have been convened to investigate these quotes ,\u201d the report concludes. Crying Woolfe \\nWoolfe quit UKIP last week, abandoning his leadership bid, and branded the party \u201cungovernable\u201d without Nigel Farage as leader and the EU referendum to unite supporters. \\nHe will now sit as an independent in the European Parliament. \\nWoolfe stands by the claim he \u201creceived a blow\u201d from Hookem during an altercation at a private meeting of UKIP MEPs, where they were discussing Woolfe\u2019s rumored plan to defect to the Conservatives. \\nWoolfe says the incident caused him to suffer two seizures, partial paralysis and the loss of feeling in his face and body. He says he issued a police complaint. \\nHookem denies hitting Woolfe. \\nThe fallout from the incident has continued with claims Woolfe has been warned about \u201cinappropriate behavior\u201d by senior party figures. \\nHookem has also claimed Woolfe signed for \u00a3276 (US$300) in daily allowances at the European Parliament three times while recovering from his injuries earlier this month. \\nWoolfe had been seen as a frontrunner in the race to replace Diane James, whose term as UKIP leader lasted just 18 days. \\nAmong the other contenders are Suzanne Evans, Paul Nuttall and Raheem Kassam. \\nAlso running is John Rees-Evans, who apologized this week over a 2014 claim that a \u201c homosexual donkey \u201d tried to rape his horse. He described the comments as \u201c playful banter .\u201d \\nThe new UKIP leader will be announced on November 28. \\nVia RT .
