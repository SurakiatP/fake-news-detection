And while both are working hard on their respective rocket designs, Boeing was eager to demonstrate another vital element of the mission: The next generation of space suit. The \u201cBoeing Blue\u201d suit is leaner, lighter, more mobile, and sports quality of life improvements across the board. Crew and Mission Systems Director Chris Ferguson explained, \u201cAstronauts had formerly had these relatively bulky, heavy suits with thick neck rings. And we learned throughout the years that maybe we didn\u2019t need that. \u201d The new suit has been \u201csimplified,\u201d replacing the sealed   with a heavy   zipper, and adding breathable mesh beneath the surface to maximize comfort, mobility, and airflow. They are offering \u201cpressurized mobility, while still preserving unpressurized comfort. \u201d Its gloves have been enhanced with special material on the palms and two of the fingers to allow for \u201ccapacitative\u201d touch screen interaction. That means that astronauts can now interact with their capsule\u2019s advanced touch interfaces, without leaving the protection of the suit. It\u2019s also much lighter. While current space suits come in at a hefty 33 lbs, the Boeing design is barely 12. Ferguson claims that you can lie in the cockpit without any real need for external cooling, and it is comfortable enough to stand around in without developing an uncomfortable \u201cheat load. \u201d The boots are \u201cbreathable and slip resistant,\u201d and zippers on the torso have been designed to make it easier for a suited individual to \u201ccomfortably transition between sitting and standing. \u201d And, of course, the head provides     communications built right in, and significant improvements to peripheral vision. Despite the current  \u2014   and somewhat convoluted  \u2014   challenge of getting our intrepid men and women into space right now, we\u2019re finally getting on track for a return to the forefront of   tech. And we\u2019re doing it in style. Follow Nate Church @Get2Church on Twitter for the latest news in gaming and technology, and snarky opinions on both.'"}, "time": 1742561651.9933863}
