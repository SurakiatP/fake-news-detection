No matter how much Trump\u2019s people try to say he doesn\u2019t want the support of such folks, the candidate himself refuses to take the fact that there is anything about the campaign he has been running that attracts these people seriously. So, naturally, when Trump\u2019s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway sat down with an interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Sunday , that particular issue came up again. Of course, Conway was not happy. Tapper began: \\n\u201cThere are a lot of anti-Semites and racists and misogynists who support the Trump candidacy.\u201d \\nConway immediately went on defense, saying, \u201cwow.\u201d Tapper went on to reference a man who was shouting \u2018JEW-S-A\u2019 at the press pen at a recent Trump rally, and directly asked Conway if she would refer to such people as \u2018deplorable.\u2019 She responded: \\n\u201cYes, I would. Wow, I have to push back on some of the adjectives you just used to describe \u2014 I hope you\u2019ve been to Trump rallies and I hope that you\u2019ve seen the tens of thousands. I mean, he\u2019s had over half a million people easily, I think in excess of that. These are U.S.A.-loving Americans.\u201d \\nTapper went on to say that no, he isn\u2019t putting all Trump supporters into that camp, but went on to force Conway\u2019s hand on this one: \\n\u201cBut without question, people who are experts on hate groups say that there has been a comfort level that has been offered to people who are anti-Semitic that has been offered to people who are anti-Semitic and racists and on and on. And these people are comfortable coming out in the open and supporting Mr. Trump. \\nMr. Trump has refused to condemn in a very serious way his racist and anti-Semitic fans,\u201d Tapper continued. \u201cHe just has. He says things like, \u201cOh, sure, I disavow, I disavow.\u2019 But he has never serious said, \u2018I don\u2019t want the support of those people, they are reprehensible, they have nothing to do with me.\u2019 He has never seriously done it.\u201d \\nConway used the pushing to pivot back to the idea that the Trump campaign is winning, saying: \\n\u201cI think this exchange is frankly the best piece of evidence I have that we\u2019re actually going to win in nine days because the idea that we\u2019re going to shift away from the pattern of corruption the cloud of ethical stain that Hillary Clinton would bring to the Oval Office in such an important week.\u201d \\nNo, Kellyanne, it\u2019s not a sign that Trump is winning. It\u2019s pointing something out that has been true since this whole fiasco began: That Donald Trump is a raging bigot, and he has been so openly. Dog whistles have turned into fog horns this election cycle, and it\u2019s all because of Donald Trump. He embraces these bigots because he\u2019s one of them. The quicker you learn that, the better. \\nWatch the exchange below: \\nFeatured image via video screen capture Share this Article!
