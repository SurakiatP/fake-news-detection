Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \\nAs Twitchy reported, James O\u2019Keefe on Tuesday teased a new Project Veritas video that would ensure Americans United for Change director Brad Woodhouse a \u201cbusy busy day.\u201d \\nThat video premiered on Fox News\u2019\u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d Wednesday night. Remarkably, Scott Foval, fired from Americans United for Change after previous Project Veritas video releases, had even more secrets to offer up \u2014 and this one was big. . @oreillyfactor breaks new video showing @woodhouseb / Scott Foval was responsible for @DavidCornDC video, not \"bartender\" pic.twitter.com/IxpfHdqpB6 \\n\u2014 James O\\'Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) October 27, 2016 \\nIn Wednesday\u2019s video release, Foval explains that the bartender who caught Romney\u2019s devastating \u201c47 percent\u201d remarks on video during a fundraiser was part of a coordinated operation to sneak a video recording device into the event. That video eventually was passed along to David Corn of Mother Jones, who won a George Polk Award for his efforts.

Progressives hailed Prouty as a hero for coming forward with the video: It\\'s up to us to keep the wolves from tearing up Scott Prouty, who did the right thing without any desire to be in the limelight.'"}, "time": 1742564167.9241135}
