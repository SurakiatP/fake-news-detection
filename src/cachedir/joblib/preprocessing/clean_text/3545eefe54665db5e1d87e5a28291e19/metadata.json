The federal agency announced it is suspending the surveys ordered during the Obama Administration to justify the attempted takeover of 90, 000 acres of land. [The BLM admitted this week admitted in a letter issued on March 29 (attached below) that it used an \u201cincorrect methodology\u201d in its justification for the attempted taking of land that had been in the possession of many Texas landowners for generations. \u201cHaving reviewed this deposition testimony and other new information, the BLM believes the survey methodology was used in error and may have caused errors in identifying the location of the Gradient Boundary,\u201d Acting Cadastral Survey Chief Stephen Beyerlein wrote in the letter.  \u201cThe BLM\u2019s admission that it used incorrect methodology in these surveys and the decision to suspend the surveys is welcome news,\u201d U. S. Representative Mac Thornberry ( ) said in a statement obtained by Breitbart Texas. \u201cThe portions of the river that the agency has surveyed strayed widely from the accepted gradient boundary survey method established by the Supreme Court in Oklahoma v. Texas. It is encouraging that the BLM has admitted their error and that all administrative action will be suspended until the matter is resolved. I will continue working with the landowners, local and state officials, and Senator Cornyn ( ) until this issue is resolved once and for all. \u201d Thornberry is the author of the \u201cRed River Gradient Boundary Survey Act\u201d which passed earlier this year. Texas farmers applauded the action by the BLM. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased the Bureau of Land Management has done the right thing by admitting that the land surveys do not take the movement of the Red River into consideration,\u201d Texas Farm Bureau (TFB) President Russell Boening said in a written statement. \u201cTFB has been involved in this situation for years. We take it very seriously when government decides that private property no longer belongs to those who have purchased, paid taxes and hold titles to it. \u201d \u201cWhen this was brought to our attention by TFB member Tommy Henderson, we knew we had to act,\u201d Boening said. \u201cWe sent a video crew to Tommy\u2019s place to document his fight for family land along the river. That video went viral and brought   light to the situation. \u201d Following a tip from   Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller, Breitbart Texas initially brought national attention to the issue that the BLM\u2019s actions threatened landowners like Tommy Henderson whose family owned some of this land for generations. \u201cSeveral local news outlets had written about the issue,\u201d BLM Spokesman Paul McGuire told Breitbart Texas at the time. \u201cBut when Breitbart wrote about it, I called Washington and said, \u2018This thing is going to blow up now. \u2019\u201d And blow up it did. The following day, many national outlets picked up the story and ran with it.   Attorney General Greg Abbott said, in an exclusive interview with Breitbart Texas the next day, \u201c\u201cI am about ready to go to the Red River and raise a \u2018Come and Take It\u2019 flag to tell the feds to stay out of Texas. \u201d He fired off a letter to   Director Neil Kornze demanding answers on the issue. The BLM responded they weren\u2019t taking the land because \u201cIt is already ours. \u201d Texas\u2019 leadership including   General Greg Abbott,  . Governor David Dewhurst,   Land Office Commissioner Jerry Patterson, and State Senator Craig Estes (  Falls) joined with Texas\u2019 U. S. Senators, John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, and U. S. Rep. Mac Thornberry to try to get the BLM to release the land back to the Texans who had believed they owned the land, in some cases for many generations. Then Governor Rick Perry weighed in on the issue in May when he said the \u201cthe federal government already owns too much land. \u201d Following the BLM\u2019s announcement,   Abbott said, \u201cThe BLM\u2019s prior actions have been hostile to landowners and their property rights, and I\u2019m pleased an end has come to this unconscionable land grab. (This) decision by the Trump administration is a victory for Texas landowners along the Red River and for our constitutional rights. \u201d Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a lawsuit in federal court in November 2015 challenging the federal encroachment on Texas land. \u201cThe borders of any state are a fundamental expression of its sovereignty, and are established through extensive surveys and legal precedent,\u201d Paxton said at the time in a statement obtained by Breitbart Texas. \u201cWe will not allow the federal government to arbitrarily infringe upon Texas land and undermine the private property rights of our citizens. The federal government must follow the law and recognize our correct borders, consistent with decisions of the U. S. Supreme Court defining the boundary formed by the Red River. \u201d The following month, Texas General Land Office Commiccioner George P. Bush also joined in the lawsuit defending the Texas landowners. Paxton praised the decision made this week by the BLM to back down on the land grab issue. \u201cThis latest action by the Trump administration protects the property rights of Texans as defined by the U. S. Supreme Court and prevents the federal government from infringing upon Texas\u2019 sovereign borders,\u201d the Texas AG said in a written statement. \u201cIt was our contention all along that the BLM\u2019s surveys were conducted improperly and unlawfully. We will vigilantly defend Texas\u2019 border from federal overreach. \u201d The BLM has suspended all administrative actions regarding these 90, 000 acres of sovereign Texas land, the TFB stated. In August 2015, Tommy Henderson won his personal battle with the BLM over the acreage his family lost in a federal lawsuit. He regained full ownership and control over the land after being forced to pay a \u201cstatutorily required payment of $1. 25 per acre,\u201d for the land his family had owned since 1904. In response to this week\u2019s action by the BLM, Henderson told the TFB, \u201cThe fight\u2019s not over yet, but we\u2019ve made a pretty good step. We have to get this fixed, so BLM never comes back again and tries this. \u201d Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.
