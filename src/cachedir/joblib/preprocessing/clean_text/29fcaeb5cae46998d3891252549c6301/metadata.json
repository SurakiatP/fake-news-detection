A raw, emotional and searching conversation followed. In the latest episode of The   we brought together a young gay actor in California, who supported Hillary Clinton, and his father in Kentucky, who backed Donald J. Trump, to talk at length about how they feel about each other\u2019s votes on Election Day. Their conversation is the third and final installment in our series of dialogues between different pairs of voters who are struggling with feelings of betrayal, mystification and fury over the Election Day decision of a person very close to them. In Part 1, we spoke with Kyle and Aaron, once close high school classmates from Illinois. In Part 2, we talked to Amy and Dawn, dear friends and   from Wyoming. All of them had avoided talking about the election, knowing just how difficult the discussion would be. Until now. They were guided by a set of questions, prepared with the advice of social psychologists, that were designed to encourage honest and civil conversation.

The father lives in Louisville, Ky. where Craig grew up. Craig has since moved to California. Their relationship: They\u2019ve grown more distant since Craig left home. Why it feels personal: Craig came out to his parents about a year ago. He grew up in a family where his father was openly derogatory toward gay people and other minority groups. His father has been struggling to accept Craig\u2019s sexuality. The tension has heightened around the election, with Craig feeling betrayed by his father\u2019s vote for Trump, and Craig\u2019s father feeling pressured by his son to evolve in ways that are uncomfortable to him. \u201cWe\u2019re from two different sides of the wall,\u201d Craig\u2019s father says. \u201cThis gay lifestyle and everything  \u2014   I didn\u2019t grow up with it. \u201d He describes once, when he was younger, being followed by a man who was trying to pick him up. \u201cI just wanted to beat the hell out of him,\u201d he tells Craig. And then he and his friends caught the guy to do just that. \u201cI\u2019ve come a long way as far as acceptance and tolerance,\u201d he says, reflecting on that past. \u201cI get that you have acceptance and tolerance,\u201d Craig responds. \u201cYou accept me as your gay son. But to me that\u2019s you being a good parent. And what I need  \u2014   and what I\u2019ve told you  \u2014   is I need you to be more than accepting of me. I need you to be an ally. To support me is to just support me. I need you to support the \u2018us. \u2019\u201d When the conversation turns to the Confederate flag displayed in his garage, Craig\u2019s father asks what is probably the hardest of the 19 questions: \u201cDo you think I\u2019m a sexist or racist?\u201d After a pause, Craig answers. \u201cYeah. \u201d He brings up the derogatory language that his father used when he was a child, which his father acknowledges was a problem and says he\u2019s working to change. \u201cAt the time I was \u201d the father says. \u201cNow I\u2019m maybe  . \u201d \u201c  what?\u201d Craig asks. \u201cI guess 40 racist. And 60, you know, O. K. I feel like I\u2019m progressing with it. I feel like I\u2019m trying. \u201d Who they are: Amy, 43. Dawn, 42. Both live in Green River, Wyo. Their relationship:   and neighbors, the women and their families have grown extremely close. Why it feels personal: As the mother of a child with a disability, Amy was deeply offended by how Mr. Trump mocked a disabled reporter during the campaign. Dawn has her own personal stake in the election: Her husband works in the mining industry, a job she worried was threatened by Mrs. Clinton\u2019s policies. \u201cThis election was different for me,\u201d Amy tells Dawn. \u201cIf, say, John Kasich won, I would be like \u2018Well, you win some you lose some.\u2019 . .. I would not have been as upset as I have been, primarily because of some of the behavior that   Trump has exhibited throughout the campaign. \u201d She continues: \u201cTrump was not my first choice for the candidacy for the presidency,\u201d Dawn says, though she is a Republican and votes Republican. She says she was \u201cdisturbed\u201d by \u201cthe way he acts and the way he thinks he can do and say these things, and can get away with it and it\u2019s okay. \u201d But ultimately, she tells Amy, \u201cI had to refocus and reprioritize the reasons I wanted to vote for him. Not that I condone his behaviors, but the other issues were huge for me. \u201d She explains: Who they are: Aaron Lee Ponce Landaverde is 26. Kyle Hill is 25. Both live in Peoria, Ill. Their relationship: Attended high school together and were teammates on the wrestling and football teams. Why it feels personal: As an   who supported Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Hill took offense at what Mr. Ponce Landaverde, a Trump supporter, posted on Facebook during the election. \u201cI\u2019ve heard race more than anything throughout this whole election, throughout this whole year,\u201d Mr. Ponce Landaverde says. \u201cThis whole year is just race. I feel like there needs to be more unity in this country. \u201d He continues: Mr. Hill explained to his friend why, to him, race was a crucial factor in this election, and is a big part of why he is struggling to understand friends who voted for Mr. Trump. \u201cA lot of what he has said, it\u2019s disparaging for marginalized people in this country  \u2014     Latinos, gay people, women  \u2014   it\u2019s disparaging,\u201d Mr. Hill says. \u201cTo a certain extent, voting for Donald Trump after all he said, after all he\u2019s done  \u2014   you have to be somewhat comfortable with that in order to cast that vote for that man. \u201d He continues: From a desktop or laptop, you can listen by pressing play on the button above.
