[The House of Representatives voted to repeal the Social Security gun ban on February 2, and the Senate followed suit on February 15.  NYT reacted with an editorial titled \u201cCongress Says, Let the Mentally Ill Buy Guns. \u201d The NYDN ran an editorial titled \u201cGun Crazy: Making It Easier for the Mentally Troubled to Get Guns. \u201d HuffPo ran a column titled \u201cCongress Just Repealed Rules to Keep Guns from the Mentally Ill. \u201d The NYDN\u2019s story features a large photo of Sandy Hook Elementary School attacker Adam Lanza. This gives the impression that a Social Security ban would have stopped    like Lanza from buying a gun at retail. However, Lanza was not a Social Security recipient, and he did not buy his guns at retail. Rather, he stole them. The Social Security gun ban would have done nothing to stop Lanza\u2019s attack, but it would have denied Second Amendment rights to millions of elderly Social Security beneficiaries. This is why Jeffrey Swanson, Duke University\u2019s psychiatry professor, said former President Barack Obama\u2019s Social Security gun ban targets the \u201cvulnerable\u201d rather than the dangerous.
