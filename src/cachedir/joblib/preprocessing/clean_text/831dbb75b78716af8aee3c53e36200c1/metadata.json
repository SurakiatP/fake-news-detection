October 28, 2016 \\nTwice in six months I find myself reviewing works by my dear old friend Joe Sobran. This time around, the Fitzgerald Griffin Foundation has treated us to an anthology of Joe\u2019s essays on Bill Clinton during his two terms in the White House. What strikes the reader immediately is the incisive analysis: Joe cuts to the chase; while being spot-on, he never descends into boorishness or uncivilized prose, which he would have deemed unworthy of a Christian gentleman. Now, of course, in our present culture of hypersensitivity, some might feel \u201cthreatened\u201d by his honesty \u2013 but that just shows how far we have fallen in so short a time. The other point to keep in mind is that while many took exception to what Joe wrote about Bill (and Hillary) \u2013 or Billary since it was Bill himself who promised (or warned) us that we were getting two for the price of one \u2013 no one has ever been able to dispute the accuracy of the commentary. \\nI am writing these reflections with a bit more than two weeks before what is arguably the most unpleasant presidential election in history. Sobran\u2019s insights into the character (or lack thereof) of both Bill and Hillary are helpful as one tries to look into his crystal ball to determine what eight years of the former First Lady-turned-President might look like. We also can surmise what Joe would have thought of Donald Trump. \\nIn that light, we can read Sobran\u2019s final paragraph introducing the first edition of this book in 2000: \u201cClinton has finally defined himself. By surviving the attempt to remove him from the office he has so filthily disgraced, he also defines our age. It says more about us than about him that he stands condoned.\u201d Sobran grimly concluded a 1997 lecture thus: \u201cI\u2019m beginning to think democracy is the cruelest form of government, because it gives people exactly the kind of leaders they deserve. We finally have one who is so transparent that we can hardly complain we\u2019ve been betrayed.\u201d Or, as European friends of mine have been saying for months: \u201cWith over three hundred million people, are Trump and Clinton the best you could do?\u201d \\nWho could disagree with the assessment that \u201cliberalism is at war with Christian culture\u201d? Or what about \u201cRepublican stupidity\u201d causing our political meltdown for years? \\nAs a lifelong educator, I perked up upon reading: \u201c[This] used to be a country where high-school students learned Latin and Greek; today college students take \u2018remedial English\u2019 and can listen to Cliffs Notes on audiotape. And we\u2019re told our best days lie ahead of us!\u201d Indeed, having taught in a community college for the past couple of years and encountering for the first time the products of American \u201cpublic education,\u201d I can only wince at the thought of the majority of these students voting in any election. Indeed, in a political philosophy class, no one had ever heard of either Winston Churchill or the Magna Carta. Of course, Plato asserted that a republic could not survive without an educated populace \u2013 and thus republics tend to devolve into dictatorships \u2013 another theme underscored by Sobran. \\nThis gem tends to encapsulate the socio-political landscape perfectly: \u201cIt\u2019s all summed up in the word \u2018judgmental.\u2019 This idiotic word says it all: the final censure of a relativist age. It\u2019s wrong to say anything is wrong. You must be punished for advocating punishment.\u201d Which reminded me of Pope Benedict XVI\u2019s talk of the \u201cdictatorship of relativism\u201d and Philadelphia Archbishop Charles Chaput\u2019s recent appeal for more \u201cjudgmentalism\u201d! \\nGood Catholic that Joe was, his political positions don\u2019t fit neatly into American partisan camps. While \u201cconservative\u201d on issues like abortion, traditional marriage and school choice, he recoiled from unrestrained American interventionism. Like St. John Paul II, he saw what U.S. involvement in the Middle East would bring and considered Bill Clinton\u2019s eagerness for such to be a smokescreen to divert attention from his personal scandals. \\nOn Hillary\u2019s \u201cenabling\u201d behavior in regard to Bill\u2019s dalliances, Sobran is brutally frank: \u201cMrs. Clinton is playing a curious role. She is the senior wife in what amounts to a walk-in harem. As long as she retains her primacy, she appears not to be jealous of the other women.\u201d Further: \u201cStalin, for some reason, reminds me of Hillary Clinton. The general view is that she is \u2018standing by her man.\u2019 My view is a little different. I think she supports her husband for the same unromantic reason Stalin made his alliance with Hitler.\u201d \\nForgetfulness seems to be a Clinton family trait: \u201cTragically, our nation has now, for the second time in a few years, seen a president afflicted with Alzheimer\u2019s. Bill Clinton\u2019s fabled memory has broken down. During his August 17, 1998 grand jury testimony, it failed him dozens of times. It\u2019s a shame, because he really needs his memory now. He\u2019s been the victim of so many lying and designing women: Gennifer Flowers, Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey, Linda Tripp, and Monica Lewinsky. He has disputed their accounts of his behavior with as much vigor as a memory-impaired person can, but it\u2019s tough. On the other hand, one advantage of having Alzheimer\u2019s is that you keep meeting new women.\u201d At last count, amnesia struck Hillary 39 times during her FBI encounter. \\nReturning to the state of our national soul, Sobran hits the nail on the head: \u201cA lot of people support Clinton even though they don\u2019t doubt that he committed sexual offenses (not all of them \u2018consensual\u2019), perjured himself, solicited perjury from others, lied to the public, and generally broke laws to cover up his offenses. Our traditional morality, public and private, has seriously eroded. The \u2018idealism\u2019 of the Sixties has rotted into the nihilism that was always latent in it.\u201d As a priest, I was initially stunned by the willingness of people to overlook Clinton\u2019s immorality until I realized that behind it all was the notion that \u201ccompared to him, I look pretty good.\u201d \\nAnd how can we neglect to mention abortion \u2013 the eighth sacrament for the Clintons (or perhaps their first and only sacrament)? Eighteen years ago and sounding eerily like Trump in Debate #3, Joe wrote: \u201cClinton and his ilk are willing to kill children on the very verge of birth, and the phrase \u2018partial birth\u2019 abortion concedes too much: it isn\u2019t \u2018abortion\u2019 except in a \u2018legally accurate\u2019 sense. It\u2019s murder of an infant. The technique of extracting the brains and crushing the skull was developed precisely to stay within the law as the U.S. Supreme Court has warped it.\u201d \\nWith all the Clinton banter about women\u2019s rights, Joe zeroes in on their ultimate inconsistency and hypocrisy when abortion and choice are linked to Communist China: \u201cIf \u2018choice,\u2019 rather than abortion as such, is the point, you\u2019d think the Clintons and the feminists would be outraged by the Chinese policy of forcing women to have abortions after the first (or in some cases, the second) child. It\u2019s hard to imagine a more barbarous tyranny. . . . In her syndicated column the week of the trip, Hillary (\u2018It takes a village\u2019) Clinton wrote about the problems of Chinese women. She cited jobs, education, workplace discrimination \u2013 but not forced abortion. Apparently the government\u2019s power to control women\u2019s bodies with the most total and cruel rigor isn\u2019t an important concern among them. Neither did feminists at home make any noise about forced abortion.\u201d \\nSince sex comes up so often when Bill is on the horizon, Sobran\u2019s comments on that matter are worth pondering: \u201c[Clinton] finds it easy to trash women when he is through with them because, to him, women are trash in the first place. His preference for oral sex, the leitmotiv of his scandals, says volumes about his regard for the opposite sex. So does his inability to remember Monica Lewinsky\u2019s name after several sessions.\u201d Since Joe was always an equal-opportunity commentator, he might be just as put off by Trump\u2019s \u201clocker-room\u201d talk, even if the alleged actions didn\u2019t follow on the words. Joe would probably also note that the entire Clinton legacy has promoted both dirty talk and immoral action. \\nIn a homily last Sunday, I shared with the congregation my personal voting record. To wit: I have always voted for the Republican candidate (because the alternatives were so morally bankrupt I could not countenance them); after Reagan II, I voted for the Republican \u201cwith a clothespin on my nose\u201d and will be doing the same this time around. I suspect that if Joe were still among us, he might be looking for a clothespin, too. Tags:'"}, "time": 1742562156.1939054}
