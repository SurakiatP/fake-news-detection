When you hit Chicago, Chicago hits back.\u201d \\n{snip} \\nAs for the honorary street designation, one of the Trump Plaza signs already has been stolen. So only one more needs to be removed. That will be done post-haste, if the full City Council approves the punishment, thanks to a so-called \u201cpending passage\u201d letter that Beale promised to sign. \\nReilly said Trump no longer deserves the honor after making political hay at Chicago\u2019s expense in a way that has damaged the city\u2019s reputation on the global stage. \\nTrump\u2019s decision to portray Chicago as a \u201cwar zone\u201d that needs stop-and-frisk during the first presidential debate was the final straw. \\n\u201cHe was comparing us to a war-torn, third-world country. That was a set of comments that didn\u2019t just insult me. It insulted anyone who loves this great city,\u201d Reilly said. \\n{snip}'"}, "time": 1742562682.176624}
