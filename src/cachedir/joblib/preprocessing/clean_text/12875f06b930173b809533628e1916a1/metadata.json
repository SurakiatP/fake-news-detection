Trump\u2019s    Jared Kushner, is ceasing its print edition, just shy of its 30th year as a weekly paper. The issue printed this last Wednesday was the paper\u2019s last, Joseph Meyer, chairman and chief executive of Observer Media, the paper\u2019s parent company, said in an interview on Friday. The decision will eliminate the use of New York in the paper\u2019s title  \u2014   its website is Observer. com  \u2014   and signals an end of an era when The Observer served as a fixture of Manhattan reporting and a training ground for scores of journalists now in senior positions in the media world. It also comes as newspaper coverage of New York City is being trimmed. The Wall Street Journal will publish its final Greater New York section on Saturday, a result of widespread cuts at the paper. The Daily News, whose staff has already shrunk, announced a new round of layoffs this week. The New York Times is rethinking its own Metro coverage as the paper seeks to lure global audiences. Mr. Meyer, in the interview, said the decision to close The Observer\u2019s print edition was a natural outgrowth of the paper\u2019s shift toward a national audience and the decline in print advertising that has afflicted the industry. Mr. Meyer, who is Mr. Kushner\u2019s    said the decision had been two years in the making and was not related to Mr. Trump\u2019s election this week. Mr. Kushner, who is aiding Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential transition, was not available to comment. Now focused on real estate coverage and provocative opinion, The Observer\u2019s heyday came during the   tenure of its former editor, Peter W. Kaplan, whose tutelage in   reporting and arch prose became a rite of passage for a generation of prominent newspaper and magazine journalists. Mr. Kaplan died in 2013. The publication was founded in 1987 by the banker Arthur L. Carter. Its early editors included Graydon Carter, now the editor of Vanity Fair, and Susan Morrison, now the articles editor of The New Yorker. Under Mr. Kaplan, the newspaper originated the \u201cSex and the City\u201d column by Candace Bushnell that later became a hit television series. Mr. Meyer said the Observer\u2019s coverage of New York City politics and culture would continue, adding that the paper had open positions for new reporters and editors. Mr. Meyer said that no journalists would be laid off as part of the change to all digital. But several freelance writers at the newspaper were dismissed on Friday, along with one of the paper\u2019s   editors. Staff members said that several positions, vacated by layoffs or resignations, had remained unfilled. Observer. com received 5. 6 million unique visitors in September, nearly twice its audience from the year before, according to statistics from comScore. Mr. Meyer declined to disclose print circulation figures. Mr. Kushner\u2019s purchase of The Observer in 2006, when he was 25, created tension between him and the paper\u2019s journalists, some of whom later accused Mr. Kushner of interfering in coverage. But Ken Kurson, the Observer\u2019s current editor, wrote on his Facebook page on Friday that he welcomed the move to digital, citing a rise in online readership and advertising. \u201cThis has been a week of incredible tumult, for our country, and now for this small business,\u201d Mr. Kurson, who is close to Mr. Kushner, wrote in a post. \u201cWho knows what the future holds, for me or for the USA or for Observer. \u201d \u201cBut I can tell you this much for sure,\u201d Mr. Kurson added. \u201cObserver\u2019s future is brighter than it\u2019s ever been. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562754.3568041}
