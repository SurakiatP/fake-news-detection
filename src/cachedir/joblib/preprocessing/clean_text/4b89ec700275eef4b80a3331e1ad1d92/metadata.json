In an interview in 1998, Clifford Stone, a retired US Army sergeant who served in the army for 22 years and participated in covert operations, which should gain a crashed extraterrestrial ships and extraterrestrial biological entities (EBE) revealed that there are at 55 alien races, which they are known to the US government. \\nBy his knowledge of extraterrestrial races, a number are more active than others in interaction with people and can say that they have great significance for human evolution and sovereignty. A significant number of reports and testimonies involving different extraterrestrial races, from which it follows that the motives and actions of these races varies considerably, and on closer examination of these reports and statements can discern their intentions. \\nThe most compelling testimony concerning different extraterrestrial races comes from \"confidential sources\" as Sergeant Stone, who for a long time served in the military and / or corporations that participated in \\'black projects \"and the\" contactees \"who have had direct physical contact with extraterrestrials and communicated with them. This applies to both \\'contactees\\' in the classic sense who voluntarily engage in interaction with extraterrestrial races and \\'abductees\\' who have been involuntarily incorporated into extraterrestrial programs. First, I\\'ll report on those persons who are the main sources of information from various alien races and generally operating in the country, then I will try to specify the description of the motivations and activities of these races using available sources.
