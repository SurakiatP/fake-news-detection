According to a report by the Wall Street Journal , Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe sent more than half a million dollars in campaign funds and material support to the wife of an FBI official who was a part of the investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s personal email server. It was recently revealed that Clinton performed all of her business as Secretary of State from this server, including sharing classified information.\\nYou can read more about that here .\\nWhy Does This Matter? With all the information that has come out recently exposing the truth behind Western politics, it\u2019s shedding light on the fact we are being misled and that there are extreme amounts of corruption in politics. Politicians are being used by big corporations and banks to push elitist agendas.\\nThis is a time for reflection for us all as the external happenings of our world show us what is really going on. As things become more obvious it gives us a chance to see it VERY clearly -it\u2019s happening for a reason. Is it time to discuss taking a different approach to our world? I think so.\\nThis is a great quote that fits perfectly here:\\n\u201cThe conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society . Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of.\u201d \\n\u2013 Edward Bernays, The Father of Public Relations, Propaganda , 1928 \\nWhat Are We Focusing On? Every four years we turn our attention to the presidential race, while the fact remains, as Bernie Sanders told us earlier in the year, that \u201cno matter who is elected to be president, that person will not be able to address the enormous problems facing the working families of our country. They will not be able to succeed because of the power of corporate America, the power of Wall Street, and the power of campaign donors is so great that no president alone can stand up to them.\u201d ( source )\\nInstead of \u201cstanding up to them,\u201d they simply do what they are told. One example would be the transcripts of Hillary Clinton\u2019s paid speeches to Goldman Sachs .\\nPoliticians seem to now function as mere frontmen for these corporations, the ones to answer our questions, alleviate our fears, and ultimately, bear the brunt of our anger.\\nBut at the end of the day there is something we must not forget:\\n\u201c a power has risen up in the government greater than the people themselves, consisting of many, and various, and powerful interests, combined into one mass, and held together by the cohesive power of the vast surplus in the banks.\u201d John C. Calhoun ( source )\\nShadow Government It\u2019s no longer a secret that the global consolidation of power lies in the hands of very few \u2014 a small group of people and the corporations they run, all held together by the world of finance \u2014 or that this few controls every aspect of our lives.\\nBelow is a great clip from the Thrive documentary by Foster Gamble, heir to the Proctor Gamble corporation. He was groomed for the establishment, but chose a different path.\\nThese are the ones we need to shed more light on if we are going to turn things around. The power these corporations and banks have is unacceptable, and politics, at the end of the day, although a good tool that can be used to wake up the masses, is a distraction and waste of time.\\nIt takes the power out of our hands, and places it in the hands of others \u2014 while we watch what they do with it and hope it benefits us.\\nAwareness! This is about awareness. Awareness so we can begin having discussions about what to do next and pulling our consciousness away from the illusion that is before. It is becoming more and more obvious so we can let it go.\\nIt\u2019s fitting to leave you with this last quote from Theodore Roosevelt. Combined with all of the evidence, it\u2019s interesting to think about.\\n\u201cPolitical parties exist to secure responsible government and to execute the will of the people.\\nFrom these great tasks both of the old parties have turned aside. Instead of instruments to promote the general welfare, they have become the tools of corrupt interests which use them impartially to serve their selfish purposes. Behind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible government, owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the people.\\nTo destroy this invisible government, to dissolve the unholy alliance between corrupt business and corrupt politics is the first task of the statesmanship of the day.\u201d ( source )\\n'"}, "time": 1742562427.953065}
