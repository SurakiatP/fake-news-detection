Certainly, many of us grumble when an article about aliens invading New York City passes through our newsfeeds only to be taken seriously \u2014 but the so-called \u201cproblem\u201d of \u201cfake\u201d news Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg is referring to isn\u2019t targeting such vapid content. What Facebook will target, however, should concern all of us. After the absurdity that was the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton supporters and establishment Democrats excoriated Zuckerberg for dereliction of duty in failing to remove sham news articles and sites from his wildly popular platform \u2014 because, in their eyes, this putative \u201cfake\u201d news literally swung the election toward Donald Trump .But this seemingly hapless campaign of finger-pointing \u2014 the Clinton camp also railed against FBI Director James Comey, among many others, in their search to blame anyone but themselves \u2014 has nothing at all to do with inane articles of no worth. Rather, the new war on \u201cfake\u201d news is simply a poorly-disguised attempt to quash legitimate information unfavorable to the liberal establishment\u2019s agenda \u2014 for good. This perilous course of blanketing, State-sponsored censorship marks what might be the most overarching effort to kill dissenting opinion in decades \u2014 perhaps approaching or exceeding the height of the Red Scare and McCarthyism. Here\u2019s why: Mark Zuckerberg, a known proponent of establishment narrative and supporter of liberal goals, originally responded to this criticism somewhat rationally, saying the actual percentage of imposter news items is so miniscule, it could not possibly have affected the outcome of the election. He\u2019s right. Or at least, he was. \u201cOf all the content on Facebook, more than 99 percent of what people see is authentic. Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes,\u201d the Facebook head wrote in a post to his site on Saturday. \u201cThe hoaxes that do exist are not limited to one partisan view, or even to politics. Overall, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other.\u201d After the failed Clinton campaign turned and targeted Zuckerberg and Facebook with its bitter wrath of loss, he abruptly switched his tune \u2014 and a plan is now underway for how to \u201ccope\u201d with this \u201cfake\u201d news [non] \u201cproblem.\u201d It\u2019s imperative to consider several points concerning Facebook\u2019s burgeoning war \u2014 with over one billion users worldwide, no staff would be large enough to combat reports of fraudulent news that will undoubtedly be rolling in soon. So, the plan? Artificial intelligence \u2014 a self-teaching algorithm to identify and remove the supposedly counterfeit news items, and likely relegate the source as a Scarlet Letter verboten site. But an issue of grave concern has already arisen before the war on fake news even gets off the ground. Business Insider boasted in a headline \u201cIt took only 36 hours for these students to solve Facebook\u2019s fake-news problem\u201d\u2014 but there\u2019s a serious problem. Their algorithm failed. Miserably. In fact, one of the two items touted by Business Insider as proof of the success of the spurious news-slaying algorithm can be proven factually true \u2014 nearly verbatim \u2014 on the government\u2019s own website. According to Business Insider, the four students from various top universities participated in a recent hack-a-thon at Princeton University \u2014 which Facebook co-sponsored . In a mere 36 hours, they created an extension for the Chrome browser to ostensibly identify and parse out whether suspicious items constitute legitimate, truthful news, called \u201c FiB: Stop living a lie .\u201d \u201cIt classifies every post, be it pictures (Twitter snapshots), adult content pictures, fake links, malware links, fake news links as verified or non-verified using artificial intelligence,\u201d one of the students told the outlet. \u201cFor links, we take into account the website\u2019s reputation, also query it against malware and phishing websites database and also take the content, search it on Google/Bing, retrieve searches with high confidence and summarize that link and show to the user. \u201cFor pictures like Twitter snapshots, we convert the image to text, use the usernames mentioned in the tweet, to get all tweets of the user and check if current tweet was ever posted by the user.\u201d Appearing smug in the article\u2019s lead picture, Nabanita De, a second-year master\u2019s student in computer science student at UMass Amherst; Anant Goel a freshmen in Purdue University; Mark Craft, a sophomore at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; and Catherine Craft, a sophomore also at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, all believe they\u2019ve discovered the quick fix to Zuckerberg\u2019s [now] problem. As an example, the extension identified and marked an article \u201cnot verified\u201d; but the article, a report touting findings from the National Cancer Institute which appeared on the government\u2019s National Institute on Drug Abuse site \u2014\u201cMarijuana Kills Cancer Cells, Admits the U.S. National Cancer Institute\u201d\u2014 isn\u2019t fake at all. From the government\u2019s site , with emphasis added: \u201cNIH-funded and other researchers are continuing to explore the possible uses of THC, CBD, and other cannabinoids for medical treatment. \u201cFor instance, recent animal studies have shown that marijuana extracts may help kill certain cancer cells and reduce the size of others . \u201cEvidence from one cell culture study suggests that purified extracts from whole-plant marijuana can slow the growth of cancer cells from one of the most serious types of brain tumors. \u201cResearch in mice showed that treatment with purified extracts of THC and CBD , when used with radiation, increased the cancer-killing effects of the radiation.\u201d Beyond this one example, and much further to the point, the Democratic establishment is leading the call to abolish \u201cfake\u201d news \u2014 a blaring alarm bell for anyone paying attention this election cycle. A trove of published leaked emails and documents by Wikileaks concerning the Democratic National Committee, campaign chair John Podesta, and Hillary Clinton , proved a staggering degree of corruption and collusion undertaken for years by establishment insiders and corporate media, which, for all intents and purposes, amounted to an attempt to throw the election in their favor. As the campaign came under heavy fire from all sides, Clintonites were quick to shift blame and try to discredit the mountainous evidence of wrongdoing \u2014 first by blaming Wikileaks for trying to throw the election, then by claiming the information being published was fake. Except it wasn\u2019t. For nearly the entire duration of its existence, Wikileaks has offered a prize of several hundred thousand dollars for anyone who can prove even a single document it published isn\u2019t authentic . And that bounty, though challenged from time to time, remains unclaimed. And now the outgoing Democratic party wants to initiate a war on fake news? Nothing to see here, folks. \u201cEveryone has the right to say what they want, have access to sites that they want, share what they want,\u201d Obama and Democrat Party insider , Teddy Goff, told Politico \u2014 which, incidentally, starred in several damning emails for colluding with the Clinton campaign. \u201cBut a publisher with a record of making stuff up is not likely to rank that highly on Google, and the equivalent ought to be the case on Facebook. [\u2026] \u201cTwo, three weeks ago, many of us are beginning to talk about what a big problem this is, both from the campaign and from the administration, and just sort of broader Obama orbit, and are talking about, this is one of the things we would like to take on post-election. \u201cThis is something we were very aware of, saw zero percent chance Facebook was going to be compliant or work with us during the election, but wanted to take on post-election.\u201d Recall the aforementioned and justifiable doubt Zuckerberg originally expressed about the nonexistent \u201cproblem\u201d of \u201cfake\u201d news \u2014 and consider Goff told Politico these ostensibly false news items posted to Facebook painted \u2018Clinton as corrupt, criminal or otherwise beyond the political pale.\u2019 In fact, evidence of corruption, media collusion, and highly questionable, if not explicitly criminal, activity now mar Hillary Clinton\u2019s legacy as Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic nominee \u2014 not because of bogus reporting. There was no need for fake items, and \u2014 although a few websites certainly blew points out of proportion \u2014 the emails, themselves damned Clinton\u2019s campaign. Thus, the liberal establishment\u2019s war on fake news \u2014 for which the head of the largest social media platform has now been roped in \u2014 amounts to little more than a witch hunt to silence truthful, but damaging, information. Information vital to the American public, imperative for making informed choices, and indispensable if this nation is still to be characterized as maintaining even a shred of freedom. Employing failed algorithms \u2014 or even people \u2014 is a hopelessly flawed solution to a problem that simply doesn\u2019t exist. And what will result is a war on alternative, independent media and opposing thought \u2014 in all forms. Considering the insidious, wholly one-sided nature of this plan, it would be errant not to draw parallels to a new McCarthyism. Indeed, independent media websites likely did help turn the election away from Hillary Clinton \u2014 not by posting inane, false garbage, or slanted reporting \u2014 but by having the integrity to post the truth about her dealings behind the scenes. And, where corporate media failed in journalistic integrity and due diligence, alternative sources \u2014 led by Wikileaks \u2014 excelled. Had the same vault of information surfaced about Trump, alternative media would have had the same field day \u2014 and that\u2019s where the Clintonites have it all wrong. Fake news \u2014 dissenting opinion, opposing viewpoints, a free press \u2014 none of that tilted the election. Unless, of course, by fake news they are referring to corporate media\u2019s submitting articles to the Clinton campaign prior to editors, or Hillary insiders collaborating on articles so ensure the \u2018right\u2019 angle was employed \u2014 or any of the examples proven in leaked documents. Nominating Hillary when a veritable revolution erupted behind Bernie Sanders, however, did. It would behoove them to turn tail, learn the lesson, and walk away, instead of imposing a blanketing and unnecessary campaign of censorship against \u201cfake\u201d news when the truth is a bitter pill to swallow. Meanwhile, the Mainstream Media has been caught faking news countless times, which had serious consequences worldwide:'"}, "time": 1742563537.9064035}
