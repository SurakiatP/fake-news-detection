{"duration": 0.12939810752868652, "input_args": {"text": "'The other day, I bolted out of work eager to see a woman about a shark. And that woman hadn\u2019t carried a movie in a while. So I ran, saying, \u201cKate Hudson, here I come!\u201d Please don\u2019t ask me to explain. I just like Kate Hudson. At her best, she\u2019s got a hardened,   way of carrying her share of witless romantic comedies (\u201cSomething Borrowed\u201d)   bayou horror (\u201cThe Skeleton Key\u201d) and the worst movie I\u2019ve ever seen (\u201cBride Wars\u201d). She\u2019s not an   star that way. The movie stinks, regardless of what she\u2019s doing in it. And, to her credit, she\u2019s not there to make friends. Usually, she\u2019s come to win. And for every sucker like me who thinks that she, Matthew McConaughey and the rest of that dumb, yachty caper \u201cFool\u2019s Gold\u201d actually hold up eight years later, there are 10 people who think that title pretty much sums up the Hudson experience. I feel bad for those people. But, as it turns out, I can\u2019t tell you how much I enjoyed the movie about Kate Hudson and the shark because, less than four minutes into \u201cThe Shallows,\u201d I realized that Kate Hudson wasn\u2019t in it. Really, it\u2019s worse than that. It\u2019s a Kate Hudson movie that actually stars Blake Lively. Who knows how this happened? Out of the corner of my eye, I probably caught an ad, saw that it starred a blonde and just had a \u201cFool\u2019s Gold\u201d attack. But you know that moment when you realize that you\u2019ve made a horrible, nontrivial mistake  \u2014   like leaving your wallet in a cab, or showing up a week too soon for a destination wedding? I was that guy at \u201cThe Shallows\u201d: excited to see a movie that doesn\u2019t exist and seated too far in the middle of the row to do anything about it. So I stayed. The first scene introduces Ms. Lively\u2019s   a shark rampaging in Mexican waters. The second scene introduces Ms. Lively  \u2014   as a vacationing American surfer (Nancy Adams from Galveston!) getting a ride from a local stranger who either ignores her or changes the subject anytime she asks the name of the remote, obviously deadly spot they\u2019re headed toward. (To be honest, I don\u2019t think I could bring myself to say, \u201cJaws Beach,\u201d either.) Anyway, he drops her off she slips on her strategically    wet suit and heads into the water. Yada yada yada: The shark attacks, and she and her maimed thigh are stranded on a dead whale, then a buoy rusty enough to leave you itching for a tetanus shot. With the right star, this sort of \u201cstuck out here all alone\u201d thriller is a gift from movie studio heaven: Man, I hope Sandra Bullock figures out that Russian   manual so she can get back to Earth. But with the wrong star, it\u2019s like reading that manual. And Ms. Lively is a   sort of star. I, at least, struggle to understand her career. Her performance as a junkie in \u201cThe Town\u201d features the \u201cBride Wars\u201d of Boston accents. Her performance in \u201cThe Age of Adaline\u201d  \u2014   as a woman \u201ccursed\u201d to stay 30 forever  \u2014   was like watching a mermaid ride a bike. She tries. But her acting hasn\u2019t yet caught up to her   beauty. Alas, there may be no algorithmic solution for that. So I was less than psyched at the prospect of seeing her shiver on a buoy, stitch her own wounds, talk to animals or play a Nancy. And, as refreshing as it is watching her stand on a surfboard, it\u2019s refreshment that provides some perspective. While some actors make sense on movie screens, there are others who might make better sense on a can of something  \u2014   beer, beans, air. I can hear you, Hudson skeptics. And all I can say is that the heart wants what the heart wants. I\u2019d actually buy whatever Ms. Hudson was on the can of. There might be no appreciable industrial difference between what a Kate Hudson can do versus your Blake Livelys. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re interchangeable, but sometimes the movies beg to differ, and the market corrects itself. Don\u2019t fall in love with Mark Harmon, because here comes Kevin Costner. And sell your Brad Rowe stock, because he\u2019s just going to be replaced by Brad Pitt. (In the late 1990s, that pretty much happened.) But there are continuums, too. Channing Tatum, for instance, is a more elastic,    Brendan Fraser upgrade. Lots of parts that have gone to Ms. Lively feel as if Ms. Hudson could have played them. But something happened, and suddenly it was someone else\u2019s turn to be \u201cit. \u201d (It\u2019s always someone else\u2019s turn.) And part of what annoys me about the lack of Kate Hudson in my life and the surfeit of Ms. Lively is the same thing that makes me angry when a perfectly good piece of software gets a superfluous update, or a zealous waiter takes my plate at a restaurant: I wasn\u2019t done with that. Lots of people are fine with seeing Ms. Lively in something called \u201cThe Shallows. \u201d (They appreciate the wink.) At the end of June, it was America\u2019s    movie, continuing the year of good fortune for her and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, another actor who struggled to find his lane as a star, settling for \u201cdisfigured   hero\u201d in the surprise winter blockbuster \u201cDeadpool. \u201d And yet, I have to believe that some of those \u201cShallows\u201d tickets were sold to people who\u2019d never seen a movie like this and assumed the shark was going to win. I feel bad for those people, too. Laziness kept me in my seat. So did the possibility that the movie might make a \u201cPsycho\u201d  switch and have Nancy\u2019s useless friend  \u2014   who looks like a brunet Blake and is only seen on Nancy\u2019s phone  \u2014   take over the second half. But Todd Haynes didn\u2019t direct \u201cThe Shallows. \u201d Jaume   did, and he knows his way around decent junk. He made a couple of those \u201cstop taking my stuff\u201d movies that Liam Neeson does: \u201cRun All Night\u201d and the magnificently bonkers \u201c . \u201d So Ms. Lively also gets to explore her inner Neeson  \u2014   maybe even her inner Sigourney Weaver, Tom Hanks in \u201cCast Away\u201d and, with that   Rambo. Even if she can\u2019t act, she also can\u2019t lose. And that\u2019s the thing about the \u201cstuck out here all alone\u201d genre: Anybody can do it. Ms. Lively\u2019s   list here includes swimming, shooting flares, eating little crabs and speaking aloud her thoughts. (\u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d she asks the shark.) Physical fitness wins the day, and Ms. Lively is very physically fit. But a movie like this, if it\u2019s written even   can be rigged for triumph. Unlike Ms. Hudson, Ms. Lively seems to need to be liked. She\u2019s up against an enemy that refuses to settle for snacking on that whale carcass and has to keep coming after her. And you don\u2019t begrudge the will to survive, even if it\u2019s just to keep surfing. So when Ms. Lively makes thinking faces to devise a way back to the beach and delivers a   \u201c\u201d it feels almost inhuman not to at least grip your armrest, at least a little. I still wish Kate Hudson were in this movie. What can I say? I wanted \u201cFool\u2019s Gold. \u201d But I didn\u2019t mind getting plain old pyrite, either.'"}, "time": 1742562098.5704675}
