[Three days after the leftist filmmaker, and avowed Kaepernick supporter, took to Instagram to thank Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll for signing Colin Kaepernick, a report has emerged that the Seahawks in fact have no intention of signing Colin Kaepernick.  According to Pro Football Talk, \u201cPat Kirwan of SiriusXM NFL Radio said today that he doesn\u2019t expect the Seahawks to sign Kaepernick. That\u2019s particularly noteworthy because Kirwan has a long and close relationship with Seahawks coach Pete Carroll, dating to their time together when Carroll was defensive coordinator and then head coach of the Jets from 1990 to 1994. Kirwan didn\u2019t say Carroll was the source of his belief that Kaepernick won\u2019t be a Seahawk, but it seems unlikely that Kirwan would have bad information about the team his old friend coaches. \u201d Seattle, much like San Francisco, is one of the biggest liberal outposts on the left coast. Considering the activism of players like Doug Baldwin, and the fact that Pete Carroll himself is a   truther and an Iraq war critic to boot, if Seattle ever truly had interest in Kaepernick it\u2019s unlikely that interest would have evaporated over Kaepernick\u2019s politics or because of a perceived backlash over his politics. What\u2019s more likely is that Kaepernick and the Seahawks couldn\u2019t agree on financial terms. Seattle doesn\u2019t have a ton of cap space and Kaepernick probably doesn\u2019t want to play for the veteran minimum, especially considering that he could likely find himself in a much more powerful financial bargaining position later, should a team lose a starter and all of a sudden become desperate for a starting quarterback.
