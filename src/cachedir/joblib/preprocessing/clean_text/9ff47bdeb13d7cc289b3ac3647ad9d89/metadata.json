Five of the wooden behemoths, weighing more than 200 pounds each and sitting atop a quartet of gurney wheels, were made in the late 1970s at the request of Edwin H. Land, the company\u2019s founder, to demonstrate the quality of his   film. But the cameras found their true home in the art world, taken up by painters like Chuck Close and Robert Rauschenberg and photographers like William Wegman, David Levinthal and Mary Ellen Mark to make instant images that had the size and presence of sculpture. In 2008, Polaroid, in bankruptcy, stopped producing instant film. Mr. Reuter, who had worked at the company for decades, swooped in with the help of an investor, buying one of the original cameras and hundreds of cases of the remaining film. The dream was to make enough money to be able to recreate the manufacturing process for the film and its unwieldy chemicals and to make more of the big cameras. But in an interview last week, Mr. Reuter said he had finally decided to bow to the inevitable: There will never be a large enough demand for the cameras and he can no longer maintain his quixotic effort to keep them alive. The company he runs, the 20x24 Studio, based in central Massachusetts, plans to close by the end of next year, by which time he hopes that much of the remaining film stock will be used up. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for 40 years now, and I understand the importance of the history maybe better than anyone else,\u201d said Mr. Reuter, who is also a photographer and filmmaker. \u201cBut there is a time when things have to come to an end. These are not materials that were designed to last indefinitely, and the investment to keep making them would be huge, multimillions. \u201d News of the wind down has been spreading for several months through the art world, where it has been met more often with disbelief than disappointment. \u201cI haven\u2019t given up,\u201d said Mr. Close, one of the first artists to begin using the camera in the late 1970s to make photographs as both the basis for painted portraits and as works themselves. \u201cHere\u2019s yet another medium that will be lost to history, and it just shouldn\u2019t be allowed to happen. If it does, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do, to tell you the truth. It\u2019s so integrated into everything I do. I can always imagine what making a painting from one of those pictures will look like. \u201d Like other artists he knows who have used the camera, he said, its attraction is not just in its size and endearingly oddball personality, like a creature from an obsessive hobbyist\u2019s garage. The immediacy of making the picture, Mr. Close said, changes the relationship between the subject and the artist, who together witness the image come into being after the photograph is pulled from the camera and the chemicals perform their function. \u201cYou both work together to get something that you want out of it. Your subject knows what you\u2019re trying to do. \u201d (He described a 2012 session with President Obama in a hotel room so tiny that the camera and Mr. Close\u2019s wheelchair  \u2014   a   collapse more than two decades ago left him partially paralyzed  \u2014   crowded out the Secret Service.) The filmmaker Errol Morris, who is making a documentary about the photographer Elsa Dorfman  \u2014   besides Mr. Reuter, perhaps the camera\u2019s most devoted partisan  \u2014   said that the camera had become a character in its own right in his film. \u201cIt\u2019s an objet d\u2019art, with these wheels like bicycle wheels, this huge box,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen Elsa pulls the film down from the camera and cuts across it and then the photo is brought over to a table and the cover is peeled back and this image slowly appears, there\u2019s something quite magical about it. \u201d Mr. Reuter said maintaining that magic has exhausted him and the two people who work with him, Nafis Azad and Ted McLelland. Together, they help operate the cameras, store the photographic paper and assemble the chemical pods, a highly complicated process accomplished with a    machine. With no real publicity operation, the initial financial challenges of the Great Recession and prices he probably set too high, Mr. Reuter said, \u201cthe demand for the cameras really just never materialized at the levels that it did during the Polaroid years I think a lot of people had no idea the process was still in existence. \u201d (The camera costs $1, 750 a day to rent and each exposure costs $125, down from $200 at the company\u2019s beginning.) Though Mr. Close and a handful of other artists, like Peter Tunney and Joyce Tenneson, still use the camera, the death of Ms. Mark last year meant that a consistent financial mainstay  \u2014   and a widely respected ambassador for the camera  \u2014   was gone. \u201cMy goal is for people to use the rest of the material we have before all of it is really past its prime,\u201d Mr. Reuter said. \u201cIt would be a shame to end that way. \u201d As for the cameras themselves, he said with resignation, \u201cI hope that they go to some place like the Smithsonian or the George Eastman collection in Rochester. \u201d Mr. Morris, known for his own love of rapidly rarefying film stocks like 35 millimeter and Super 8, said he continued to believe that the cameras would not end up as museum pieces. \u201cMaybe there won\u2019t be many  \u2014   and maybe there will be a time when the process goes out of existence for a while  \u2014   but I think there will be people who won\u2019t let it go away forever. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563240.7478118}
