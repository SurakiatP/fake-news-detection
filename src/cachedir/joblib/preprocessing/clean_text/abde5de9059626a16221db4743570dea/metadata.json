Even by the normal, as in low, standards of New York Times defenses of Wall Street, the Roger Lowenstein piece that Black shellacks is particularly inept. \\nBy Bill Black, the author of The Best Way to Rob a Bank is to Own One and an associate professor of economics and law at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. Originally published at New Economic Perspectives \\nWhen last I wrote of Roger Lowenstein he was complaining that the Wall Street felons were being criticized \u2013 not jailed \u2013 criticized. Lowenstein is Wall Street\u2019s self-appointed apologist-in-chief. Naturally, he despises Senator Warren, the most effective elected official in exposing Wall Street\u2019s elite frauds. The New York Times granted him an op ed in which he sought to mansplain financial regulation to Senator Warren. \\nLowenstein does not like women that he considers too loud, gratuitously complaining that Senator Warren is \u201chigh-decibel\u201d supporter of regulation. Coming from someone who has spent his journalistic career shilling for Wall Street, this sexist trope is painfully embarrassing. Wall Street is infamous for raging males who believe that screaming at subordinates who can\u2019t fight back proves their virility. \\nLowenstein was piling on to the recent sexist attack of Congressman Blaine Luetkemeyer, an ultra-right wing Missouri Republican, on Senator Warren. Congressman Luetkemeyer , a senior member of House Financial Services, was speaking to the American Bankers Association when he labeled Senator Warren the \u201cDarth Vader of the financial services world\u201d and pleaded with the bankers to work with the Trump Republicans to \u201cneuter her.\u201d The Kansas City Star coverage of this Trumpian assault on women notes that Congressman Luetkemeyer \u201cled multiple congressional efforts to protect the payday loan industry, according to fortune.com.\u201d \\nSenator Warren, who is decidedly not a screamer, is the target of Lowenstein and Luetkemeyer\u2019s wrath because Wall Street\u2019s greatest fear is the return of effective regulators who would end the elite frauds and make the criminal referrals that would imprison thousands of Wall Street\u2019s elite criminals. Wall Street knows that Senators Warren, Sanders and Brown are working tirelessly to ensure that the next president appoints regulatory leaders that would restore the rule of law to Wall Street. Lowenstein and Congressman Luetkemeyer are desperate to defeat that effort. \\nLowenstein wrote that his article was prompted by Senator Warren\u2019s recommendation that President Obama fire Mary Jo White as the chair of the SEC. Because Senator Warren understands federal regulation, she made no such recommendation. Senator Warren requested President Obama to designate another SEC commissioner as the Chair. The President does have that power. \\nMs. White has been an exceptionally weak leader of the SEC. I witnessed Ms. White\u2019s presentation at the annual law professors meeting years ago giving her ode to \u201cgood earnings management.\u201d \u201cEarnings management\u201d is one of many euphemisms for a form of accounting securities fraud that reduces the value of corporation in order to \u201chit the number\u201d and maximize the officers\u2019 bonuses. The revolving door perverted someone who once was a moderately effective prosecutor into a very well paid apologist for elite frauds. President Obama is notorious for appointing weak law enforcement officials at the Department of Justice and the financial regulatory agencies. Senator Warren is correct to call on President Obama to transfer the chair to a more capable SEC commissioner. \\nSenator Warren knows that there is no chance that President Obama will request Ms. White\u2019s resignation or no longer designate her as the SEC Chair. Senator Warren is establishing her consistency and serving notice on the next president that the democratic-wing of the Democratic Party will push for appointees in the next administration that will be dedicated to restoring the rule of law to Wall Street. Lowenstein has no expertise in regulation. Senator Warren is one of the Nation\u2019s experts in financial regulation. As one would predict, his pretense of mansplaining financial regulation to Senator Warren went hilariously wrong. Lowenstein begins with a fundamental error that betrays the fact that he does not understand even the basics of federal regulation. \\nLast time I checked, the S.E.C. was a regulatory agency of the executive branch\u2026. \\nThe SEC is an independent regulatory agency, as was the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) when I worked for it \u2014 and unlike the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) when I worked for it. The OTS was \u201ca regulatory agency of the executive branch.\u201d The normal view under U.S. jurisprudence is that the independent regulatory agencies such as the SEC are \u201ccreatures of Congress.\u201d The problem is not that the SEC became an independent regulatory agency since the \u201clast time [Lowenstein] checked.\u201d The SEC was created as an independent regulatory agency in 1934 and has remained one for its entire existence. \\nLowenstein never understood the SEC\u2019s legal nature because he never \u201cchecked\u201d on the SEC\u2019s legal nature. Had he checked, he would have found statements such as this by the SEC : \\n[A]s an independent regulatory agency the SEC is not obligated to follow the guidelines for regulatory economic analysis by executive agencies\u2026. \\nBuilding on this initial error, Lowenstein imagines President Obama\u2019s response to Senator Warren\u2019s call for President Obama to ask Ms. White to resign as Chair of the SEC: \\n\u201cHey, firing agency heads is my job.\u201d \\nWell, no. The President cannot \u201cfire\u201d the heads of independent regulatory agencies such as the SEC, precisely because they are not \u201cexecutive branch\u201d agencies. The SEC Commissioners do not serve \u201cat the pleasure of the president.\u201d \\nI am delighted that progressives such as Senators Sanders and Warren blocked Larry Summers\u2019 appointment to chair the Federal Reserve, which led to the well-deserved appointment of Janet Yellen to Chair the Fed. Progressives were enthused that progressives such as Senators Sanders and Warren blocked Antonio Weiss \u2014 whose only ostensible qualification for the Treasury slot was that he was an investment banker who contributed to the crisis rather than warning about it and trying to prevent it. Contrary to Lowenstein\u2019s assertion, Weiss had to be pushed by Senators Sanders and Warren to even begin to respond to Puerto Rico\u2019s bankruptcy. \\nThe thing that the Street will never forgive Senator Warren for is the thing they claim they value as their preeminent virtue \u2014 she succeeds. Indeed, she succeeds despite their intense opposition and their rage against her. They try to go head-to-head with her and she hands them their heads. CEOs like Wells Fargo\u2019s John Stumpf are so used to being surrounded by sycophants that tell them how brilliant they are that they approach prepping for Senator Warren\u2019s questions with contempt and immense over-confidence. Then she tears into them and they look like a deer frozen in place by headlights while being eviscerated by a wolverine. The best that Lowenstein can muster in his attempted takedown of Senator Warren is that \u201cthere is no good evidence\u201d that Stumpf resigned because of Senator Warren\u2019s evisceration of him. Senator Warren has never claimed that Stumpf resigned due to her questioning. Prior to the Senate hearings the commentators were virtually unanimous that he would not resign. After the hearings, he was doomed. \\nWall Streeters\u2019 belief that they are far smarter than anyone else (because they pay themselves more than almost everyone) and should run the economy and the government by divine right is a form of arrogance so central to their self-definition that they are frequently clueless about the most basic facts of finance, e.g., a \u201cflight to quality\u201d will produce highly correlated changes in interest rates among a wide range of securities. Lowenstein propagated this Wall Street \u201cgenius\u201d myth in his best-known book ( When Genius Failed ). The \u201cgeniuses\u201d he profiles in the book were unable to understand that a \u201cflight to quality\u201d would render their investing strategy suicidal. \\nLowenstein\u2019s ode to the revolving door rests on his assertions about the supposed Wall Street giants of federal regulation. His assertions will strike most readers, correctly, as bizarre. He asserts that \u201cmany of the best\u201d financial regulators came from Wall Street, giving three supposed examples including Henry M. Paulson Jr., a Treasury Secretary under the second President Bush. Unsurprisingly, Robert Rubin, President Bill Clinton\u2019s Treasury Secretary wrote a glowing review in the NYT\u2019s of Lowenstein\u2019s most recent book. Rubin and Paulson share a number of characteristics. They both were the leaders of Goldman Sachs before being appointed as Treasury Secretary. They both presided over the three \u201cde\u2019s\u201d \u2013 deregulation, desupervision, and de facto decriminalization of finance. They both are immensely culpable for creating the criminogenic environment that produced the three most damaging epidemics of accounting control fraud in history. Those fraud epidemics hyper-inflated the bubble and drove the financial crisis. The fact that Lowenstein cites Paulson as one of the greatest financial regulators in history and the fact that Rubin wrote such an over-the-top review of the supposed brilliance of Lowenstein demolish Lowenstein\u2019s credibility and his claim that the revolving door that leads Wall Street. His modern hero was one of the important contributors to the catastrophe. \\nLowenstein\u2019s second proposed Wall Street hero is Arthur Levitt, who worked for a series of Wall Street firms before being appointed as Chairman of the SEC. After he left the SEC he worked for Goldman Sachs. Levitt did try to make some reforms as Chairman of the SEC. Mr. Levitt, however, was ultimately critically flawed \u2013 and those flaws came from the dogmas he absorbed from his many years on Wall Street. I discuss one of those flaws below. \\nLowenstein fails to even mention this Nation\u2019s most effective financial regulator, Edwin Gray, Chairman of the FHLBB. This is unsurprising because Gray was successful largely because he had no Wall Street ties. Gray\u2019s most virulent foe in the government was Donald Regan, the former head of Merrill Lynch, and the fiercest proponent of the deregulation that made the savings and loan industry so criminogenic that George Akerlof and Paul Romer concluded it was \u201cbound\u201d to produce widespread \u201c looting .\u201d Gray enraged Mr. Regan by seeking to regulate against deposit brokers. Merrill Lynch was the Nation\u2019s largest deposit broker. Gray\u2019s top supervisors who proved so brilliantly successful in countering the raging fraud epidemics in Texas and California that drove the savings and loan debacle, Joe Selby and Michael Patriarca, were long-time government employees who had never worked for Wall Street. None of regulatory leaders who distinguished themselves in containing the debacle came from Wall Street. \\nLowenstein fails to mention the sole federal regulatory leader of the last 20 years who sought to emulate Gray and serve as a vigorous financial reregulator \u2013 Brooksley Born \u2013 who attempted to regulate financial derivatives. Ms. Born\u2019s efforts were destroyed by a bipartisan coalition of Wall Street officials and alums holding key government positions that exemplify the dangers of the revolving door. That coalition included Bill Clinton (as President of the U.S., soon to be made wealthy by Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street firms for speeches with obscene payoffs), Treasury Secretary Rubin (former CEO of Goldman Sachs and soon-to-be be made even wealthier as a top officer of Citigroup where he had no real job duties), Mr. Greenspan (Chairman of the Fed; Wall Streeter before and after), Eugene Ludwig (Comptroller of the Currency; soon to leave to be made wealthy by Bankers Trust/Deutsche Bank, the giant serially criminal enterprise that is Germany\u2019s largest bank), Senator Gramm (Chairman of Senate Banking; later made wealthy by UBS, the giant, serially criminal enterprise that is one of Switzerland\u2019s largest banks) \u2013 as well as both of Lowenstein\u2019s purported modern financial regulatory heroes \u2013 Mr. Paulson (while he was running Goldman Sachs, before being named by the second President Bush as his Treasury Secretary) and Mr. Levitt (when he was SEC Chairman, before he would take the revolving door to Goldman Sachs). Note that Mr. Paulson was only one of the infamous \u201c13 Bankers\u201d (the CEOs of the largest banks) who met with Treasury Secretary Rubin to (successfully) demand that Ms. Born\u2019s be forbidden to regulate huge classes of financial derivatives, including credit default swaps(CDS). \\nYou can see why Lowenstein left out of his column any discussion of these Wall Streeters racing through the revolving door to enrich themselves and other Wall Street officers at the expense of our Nation and people all over the world by bringing together this assemblage of naked political and economic power to crush Ms. Born\u2019s efforts to fulfill her statutory duties as Chair of the CFTC. I agree that Mr. Levitt was the least bad regulator of this corrupt coalition. Mr. Levitt has conceded that his attacks on Ms. Born were disgraceful and erroneous. \\nAs best I can tell, Senator Warren takes a position about the revolving door that is very similar to mine. We do not oppose any appointment of people of Wall Street to government. We oppose the continued domination of the regulatory agencies and executive agencies by Wall Street personnel. That domination has produced a pathetic track record of intentional failure due not simply to conflicts of interest and self-interest, but even more to the anti-regulatory dogmas that are endemic on Wall Street. Neither our economy nor our democracy can afford the terrible cost of this continued, corrupt domination. The domination has perverted the U.S. into a system of crony capitalism. As one of my fellow co-founders of Bank Whistleblowers United (BWU), Gary Aguirre (formerly an SEC enforcement attorney before he blew the whistle of the SEC leadership) stresses, the SEC routinely waives for former senior SEC officials the existing revolving door restrictions. BWU has called on the SEC to end this indefensible practice. \\nLowenstein then makes another dishonest claim about the SEC. \\nWhen the S.E.C. has landed in trouble, it has usually been because it has wandered from its charter and ignored its bread-and-butter responsibility (see Madoff, Bernie). \\nThat statement is carefully crafted to mislead the reader. The SEC failed with regard to Bernie Madoff by refusing to act on clear evidence of fraud provided by multiple whistleblowers. Madoff was an example of a variant of the revolving door. Mr. Madoff was a Wall Streeter who became for years the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the NASD, a self-regulatory association that functions under aegis of the SEC. The SEC generally treats the NASD as a quasi-public ally. The SEC was reluctant to believe warnings about Mr. Madoff because of his former role as the NASD\u2019s leader. \\nThe SEC did not get in \u201ctrouble\u201d with Madoff because it \u201cignored\u201d its core responsibilities to divert large of resources in order to take on some exotic, tangential function. Lowenstein simply invented that fiction. The SEC got in trouble in large part because of the combination of the revolving door and Congressional Republicans\u2019 war on the SEC budget. The Republicans want the SEC to be ineffective as a regulator because the Wall Street\u2019s leaders who are criminals fear a vigorous SEC. \\nLowenstein knows that this Republican war is a critical threat to the Nation, but asserts a policy implication of this war that is nonsensical to anyone but Wall Street\u2019s apologist-in-chief. \\n[T]he S.E.C. faces continual pressure on its budget from a skeptical and unappreciative Congress. The last thing it needs is political grandstanding from Ms. Warren. \\nNote that Lowenstein dishonestly uses the term \u201cCongress\u201d instead of \u201cCongressional Republicans.\u201d The Congressional Republicans are not \u201cskeptical and unappreciative\u201d of the SEC \u2013 they are virulently hostile to effective securities (and financial derivatives) regulation. This exceptional hostility has been a constant feature preventing the SEC and CFTC from having adequate resources to fulfill their statutory duties since the early 1990s. Criminologists call this the deliberate creation of \u201csystems incapacity.\u201d Senators Sanders, Brown, and Warren are the strongest supporters of the SEC and the CFTC receiving the substantial increases in budget required for these agencies to perform their statutory missions. Logically, Lowenstein should be criticizing virtually every Republican member of Congress and praising Senator Warren and her progressive allies. Instead he refuses to identify the Republicans as the source of problem and attacks only Senator Warren \u2013 implying dishonestly that if she would stop pushing for the SEC to restore the rule of law to Wall Street the Republicans would cease their actions on behalf of criminal Wall Street elites designed to gut the SEC\u2019s ability to counter the elite Wall Street frauds. 0 0 0 0 0 0'"}, "time": 1742628572.4819534}
