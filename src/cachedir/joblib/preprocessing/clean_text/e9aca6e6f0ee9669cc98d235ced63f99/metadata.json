In an email dated June 28, 2015, Abramovic wrote, \u201cI am so looking forward to the Spirit Cooking dinner at my place. Do you think you will be able to let me know if your brother is joining? All my love, Marina.\u201d Tony Podesta then forwarded the email to his brother John Podesta (Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman), asking him, \u201cAre you in NYC Thursday July 9 Marina wants you to come to dinner.\u201d What is \u201cspirit cooking\u201d? Spirit cooking refers to \u201ca sacrament in the religion of Thelema which was founded by Aleister Crowley\u201d and involves an occult performance during which menstrual blood, breast milk, urine and sperm are used to create a \u201cpainting\u201d. The Podestas\u2019\u201cSpirit Cooking\u201d dinner? It\u2019s not what you think. It\u2019s blood, sperm and breastmilk. \\n\u2014 WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) November 4, 2016 According to Marina Abramovic , if the ritual is performed in an art gallery, it is merely art, but if the ritual is performed privately, then it represents an intimate spiritual ceremony. The video embedded above depicts the bizarre nature of the ceremony. Abramovic mixes together thickly congealed blood as the \u201crecipe\u201d for the \u201cpainting,\u201d which is comprised of the words, \u201cWith a sharp knife cut deeply into the middle finger of your left hand eat the pain.\u201d The ceremony is, \u201cmeant to symbolize the union between the microcosm, Man, and the macrocosm, the Divine, which is a representation of one of the prime maxims in Hermeticism \u201cAs Above, So Below.\u201d Marina Abramovic \u2018Spirit Cooking\u2019: \u201cAbramovic is known for her often-gory art that confronts pain and ritual. Her first performance involved repeatedly, stabbing herself in her hands. The next performance featured her throwing her nails, toenails, and hair into a flaming five-point star \u2014 which she eventually jumped inside of, causing her to lose consciousness,\u201d writes Cassandra Fairbanks. Another image shows Abramovic posing with a bloody goat\u2019s head \u2013 a representation of the occult symbol Baphomet. Spirit cooking is also an \u201coccult practice used during sex cult rituals, as explained in the book \u201cSpirit cooking with essential aphrodisiac recipes,\u201d notes Mike Cernovich. The revelation that John Podesta, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, is presumably interested in weird, gory occult ceremonies was too juicy for even Wikileaks to ignore. \u201cThe Podestas\u2019 \u201cSpirit Cooking\u201d dinner? It\u2019s not what you think. It\u2019s blood, sperm and breastmilk. But mostly blood,\u201d the organization tweeted. Some are even linking the spirit cooking revelation to claims that the Podesta emails contain \u201ccode for child sex trafficking\u201d that is hidden behind mentions of types of food. Others are connecting it to Laura Silsby , the missionary who was jailed for six months after her organization, New Life Children\u2019s Refuge, attempted to smuggle 33 children out of Haiti into the Dominican Republic after the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Significant, if partisan, find showing how the Clintons supported child stealer Laura Silsby https://t.co/7nULjOgmzr pic.twitter.com/NCgsVWTF2W \\n\u2014 WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) November 3, 2016 Wikileaks emails reveal that Hillary\u2019s top aide Huma Abedin forwarded numerous articles about New Life Children\u2019s Refuge to Clinton. \u201cJulian Assange claimed that the Wikileaks would send Hillary Clinton to prison,\u201d writes Cernovich. \u201cThe releases initially disappointed many people, this reporter included, as the evidence of corruption was slim. Assange was right. The real story was hidden in view.\u201d While the child trafficking and pedophile connections to Clinton remain unproven, the fact that her campaign chairman is apparently into spooky occult rituals involving menstrual blood and semen is easily one of the most disturbing Wikileaks revelations to date. source SHARE THIS ARTICLE Geoffrey Grider NTEB is run by end times author and editor-in-chief Geoffrey Grider.
