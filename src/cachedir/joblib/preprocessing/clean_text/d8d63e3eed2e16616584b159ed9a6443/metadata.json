[\u201cHate preachers must be expelled, the Islamist mosques closed,\u201d the Front National leader declared, lambasting the Socialist Party government as \u201cnotoriously feeble\u201d.  \u201cWe cannot afford to lose this war   \u2026     for the past ten years,   and   governments have done everything they can for us to lose it.

In another interview shortly after the shooting, Macron described radical Islamic terrorism as and \u201cimponderable problem\u201d which would be \u201cpart of our daily lives for the years to come\u201d.

The presidential hopes of former colleague and prime minister Manuel Valls were dashed after he made a similar statement following the Nice lorry attack, saying \u201cTimes have changed and we should learn to live with terrorism\u201d and earning a furious public backlash. A majority of France\u2019s paramilitary police force  \u2014   the Gendarmerie  \u2014   were already planning to vote for Ms Le Pen before the recent killing, well ahead of Macron.
