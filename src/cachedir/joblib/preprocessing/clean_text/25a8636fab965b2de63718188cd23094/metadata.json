Clearly, not much has changed in the Murray camp since his remarkable stretch run to the No. 1 ranking and a knighthood in 2016. He is still tough on himself on court and on the changeovers. Still Andy  \u2014   not Sir Andy  \u2014   to his peers and mentor in chief, Lendl. Still deadpan and droll with his voice that sounds as if it emanates from a mine shaft. Asked on Monday by the   interviewer John Fitzgerald how Murray\u2019s wife, Kim, was handling the transition to Lady Kim, Murray said, \u201cNo more swearing during my matches, for anyone who saw that a few years ago. \u201d He was referring to Kim\u2019s courtside language during his semifinal victory over Tomas Berdych at the 2015 Australian Open. Her tirade did not go unnoticed, and she returned for the final cheekily wearing a shirt that read, \u201cParental advisory explicit content. \u201d Presumably, Lady Kim won\u2019t be wearing that sort of thing in the players\u2019 box from here on, either (or at least she wasn\u2019t on Monday). \u201cI haven\u2019t found it distracting really,\u201d Murray said of the knighthood. \u201cI mean, I found out about it four or five weeks ago. Maybe if it happened a day or so, two days before the tournament. But I\u2019ve had enough time to get my head around it. \u201d Just as he has had plenty of time to prepare himself for the role of No. 1, however long it lasts. I asked him on Monday, after his stuttering     (5)     victory over Illya Marchenko, if there had been any downside to No. 1, thinking he might bring up extra demands or burdens. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been great. I think because it\u2019s taken me so long to get there, obviously I want to try to stay there. But also I feel like I\u2019m mature enough now to handle it. Maybe if it happens when you\u2019re very young, you might feel extra pressures. The responsibilities might feel a bit much, but I think because I\u2019m much older and more mature, it\u2019s been good. \u201d The conventional tennis wisdom is that it is harder to hang on at the top than to reach the top. \u201cI hope not,\u201d Murray said. But for anyone who believes that he now has nowhere to go but down, that is hardly true in Australia. He has reached five singles finals in Melbourne and lost all five. No man has done so well at any Grand Slam tournament without breaking through to win the title. Others have lost five finals in the same major event, including Lendl, who lost five at the United States Open. But he also won three. Bill Johnston lost six finals at the United States Championships, but won the event twice. John Bromwich lost five finals at the Australian Championships in the   era, but won the title twice, too. Murray, at 29, is in unfortunately uncharted territory, all the more so because Novak Djokovic ended his own long run of frustration at the French Open last year by finally taking the title after reaching four semifinals and three finals. \u201cLook, it\u2019s still a remarkable record, five Slam finals in Australia, and deep down I think it means an enormous amount to Andy to finally complete the puzzle,\u201d said Roger Rasheed, the Australian who once coached Lleyton Hewitt when Hewitt was chasing the title here without success. But Hewitt reached only one final in Melbourne. Murray is   here and has a better winning percentage at the Australian Open than at any other Grand Slam tournament except Wimbledon. \u201cAndy\u2019s been so close,\u201d Rasheed said. \u201cWhat more does he have to do? Well, it\u2019s not a matter of big changes. It\u2019s just been a matter of points and the moments. \u201d It\u2019s a matter of the opposition, too. The first of Murray\u2019s Australian Open defeats in the final came against Roger Federer in 2010. The last four came against Djokovic in 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2016. \u201cAndy played Roger in his prime and has been playing Novak in his prime,\u201d Rasheed said. \u201cIt\u2019s a handful of points changing the way the match falls. Andy\u2019s showing he\u2019s in his prime now. He just needs to get there and roll the dice again. \u201d Murray\u2019s timing may still not be quite right. He played a great deal of tennis down the stretch in 2016 and was beaten by Djokovic in a   final in Doha, Qatar, to start this season. Freshness just might be a factor down the stretch as well as Djokovic\u2019s eagerness to restore the pecking order. But it does not seem quite right in light of their abilities that Djokovic has six Australian Open titles and Murray has not even one. He broke down in tears after losing to Federer in 2010. He stared vacantly into space after losses to Djokovic and sportingly came up with the right words amid major disappointment. And yet he insisted on Monday that his emotions were not mixed when he thought about this tournament. \u201cHonestly, they\u2019re totally positive,\u201d said Murray, who plays    Andrey Rublev in the second round on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of tough losses here, for sure. But I love it here. Played some great matches as well, but just haven\u2019t managed to win the final. But, you know, I keep coming back to try. I\u2019ll keep doing that until I\u2019m done, but I still feel like I\u2019ve got a few years left to try and do it. \u201d He is, by any measure, due for a change of fortune in Melbourne. And if you like your sports with foreshadowing, the only other top tennis player to receive a knighthood was Sir Norman Brookes, the Australian star of the early 20th century. Guess whose name has been given to the trophy awarded to the men\u2019s champion at the Australian Open?'"}, "time": 1742564195.5628543}
