The Defense Department asked the soldiers to repay the bonuses, which amounted to $15,000 or more each, after audits revealed they were overpaid by the California National Guard. \\nBut the practice stands in contrast with that of the Obama administration\u2019s Department of Veterans Affairs, which has failed to take back hundreds of thousands of dollars paid to high-ranking bureaucrats who have been scrutinized for bad behavior or poor management. \\nFor instance, the VA said last year it would not collect over $400,000 in bonuses paid to two senior executives who manipulated the agency\u2019s hiring system to take new jobs with less responsibility and receive relocation benefits. The VA, which acknowledged that the employees abused the system, said it did not have the legal authority to recoup the money.'"}, "time": 1742564444.3074136}
