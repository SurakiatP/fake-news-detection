US intelligence officials have blamed Russia for hacking the DNC and releasing its internal communications online. \\nThe source, who would not speak on the record, said neither that inquiry nor its adjuncts were related to the new investigative developments related to Clinton. Nor is the recent criminal investigation into a National Security Agency contractor accused of hoarding highly classified intelligence data. \\nLater the Associated Press, citing an unnamed official, claimed the newly discovered emails \u201c did not come from her private server \u201d. \\nThe letter from Comey comes 11 days before the presidential election and nearly four months after the FBI director announced the bureau would not recommend criminal charges against Clinton for what it dubbed \u201cextremely careless\u201d use of a private email server while secretary of state. The FBI director said then: \u201cAlthough there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes \u2026 our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.\u201d \\nIt was not immediately clear if Clinton would address the matter publicly. She ignored shouted questions from reporters waiting on the tarmac about the FBI\u2019s announcement and did not raise the issue after taking the stage in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, sticking with her routine stump speech.'"}, "time": 1742628465.9200318}
