[Eighty people, including George Soros, Steven Rockefeller, and Abigail Disney, wrote to New York state lawmakers and Gov. Andrew Cuomo saying they and other millionaires should be taxed more to support infrastructure, schools, and programs to help the poor and homeless, the New York Daily News reported.  \u201cNow is the time to invest in the   economic viability of New York,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cWe need to invest in pathways out of poverty and up the economic ladder for all of our fellow citizens, including strong public education from   to college. And, we need to invest in the fragile bridges, tunnels, waterlines, public buildings, and roads that we all depend on. \u201d The letter endorses a plan called the \u201c1 Percent Tax Plan for Tax Fairness,\u201d which would create new, higher income tax brackets for the state\u2019s wealthiest individuals to raise a projected $2 billion. The   Fiscal Policy Institute, a think tank focused on economic policy, and the Responsible Wealth project, a group of America\u2019s wealthiest individuals who support \u201cfair taxes and corporate accountability,\u201d helped formulate the proposal, Ron Deutsch, executive director of the Fiscal Policy Institute, called it \u201crefreshing\u201d that the state\u2019s wealthiest were willing to pay more. The state legislature, however, is not as supportive of the proposal. While the Democratic majority in the Assembly has its own plan to raise taxes on the wealthy, the   Senate does not support the idea. \u201cWhether it\u2019s income taxes, property taxes, business taxes, user fees or tolls, we don\u2019t support raising taxes or asking   New Yorkers to dig deeper into their pockets to pay more,\u201d Senate leader John Flanagan ( ) said, according to the Guardian. Lawmakers are currently working out the details of the state\u2019s budget and hope to have a deal in place by April 1. Lawmakers largely ignored a similar letter sent to them last year.'"}, "time": 1742563893.379468}
