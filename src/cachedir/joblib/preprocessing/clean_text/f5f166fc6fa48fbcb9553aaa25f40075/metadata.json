Trump belittled the parents of a slain Muslim soldier who had strongly denounced Mr. Trump during the Democratic National Convention, saying that the soldier\u2019s father had delivered the entire speech because his mother was not \u201callowed\u201d to speak. Mr. Trump\u2019s comments, in an interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News that will air on Sunday, drew quick and widespread condemnation and amplified calls for Republican leaders to distance themselves from their presidential nominee. With his implication that the soldier\u2019s mother had not spoken because of female subservience expected in some traditional strains of Islam, his comments also inflamed his hostilities with American Muslims. Khizr Khan, the soldier\u2019s father, lashed out at Mr. Trump in an interview on Saturday, saying his wife had not spoken at the convention because it was too painful for her to talk about her son\u2019s death. Mr. Trump, he said, \u201cis devoid of feeling the pain of a mother who has sacrificed her son. \u201d Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, a rival of Mr. Trump\u2019s in the Republican primaries who has refused to endorse him, castigated him on Twitter. \u201cThere\u2019s only one way to talk about Gold Star parents: with honor and respect,\u201d he wrote, using the term for surviving family members of those who died in war. And Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump\u2019s Democratic opponent, said he \u201cwas not a normal presidential candidate. \u201d \u201cSomeone who attacks everybody has something missing,\u201d she told a crowd at a campaign stop in Youngstown, Ohio. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is. I\u2019m not going to get into that. \u201d Mr. Khan\u2019s speech at the convention in Philadelphia was one of the most powerful given there. It was effectively the Democratic response to comments Mr. Trump has made implying many American Muslims have terrorist sympathies or stay silent when they know ones who do. Mr. Trump has called to ban Muslim immigration as a way to combat terrorism. At the convention, Mr. Khan spoke about how his    son, Humayun Khan, an Army captain, died in a car bombing in 2004 in Iraq as he tried to save other troops. He criticized Mr. Trump, saying he \u201cconsistently smears the character of Muslims,\u201d and pointedly challenged what sacrifices Mr. Trump had made. Holding a   copy of the Constitution, he asked if Mr. Trump had read it. Mr. Khan\u2019s wife stood silently by his side. Mr. Trump told Mr. Stephanopoulos that Mr. Khan seemed like a \u201cnice guy\u201d and that he wished him \u201cthe best of luck. \u201d But, he added, \u201cIf you look at his wife, she was standing there, she had nothing to say, she probably  \u2014   maybe she wasn\u2019t allowed to have anything to say, you tell me. \u201d Mr. Trump also told Maureen Dowd of The New York Times on Friday night, \u201cI\u2019d like to hear his wife say something. \u201d In a statement late Saturday, Mr. Trump called Captain Khan a \u201chero,\u201d and reiterated his belief that the United States should bar Muslims from entering the country. \u201cWhile I feel deeply for the loss of his son,\u201d he added, \u201cMr. Khan, who has never met me, has no right to stand in front of millions of people and claim I have never read the Constitution, (which is false) and say many other inaccurate things. \u201d Even given Mr. Trump\u2019s reputation for retaliating when attacked, his remarks about the Khans were startling. They called to mind one of his earliest counterpunches of the campaign, when he responded to criticism from Senator John McCain of Arizona, once a prisoner of war in Vietnam, by saying at a forum in Iowa, \u201cI like people that weren\u2019t captured. \u201d But Mr. McCain has a long history in the public eye. The Khans, before their convention appearance, had none. \u201cTrump is totally void of any decency because he is unaware of how to talk to a Gold Star family and how to speak to a Gold Star mother,\u201d Mr. Khan said on Saturday. Ms. Khan did speak on Friday to MSNBC\u2019s Lawrence O\u2019Donnell, saying she \u201ccannot even come in the room where his pictures are. \u201d When she saw her son\u2019s photograph on the screen behind her on the stage in Philadelphia, she said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t take it. \u201d \u201cI controlled myself at that time,\u201d she said, while choking back tears. \u201cIt is very hard. \u201d In his interview with The Times, Mr. Khan said his wife had helped him craft his convention speech, and told him to remove certain attacks he had wanted to make against Mr. Trump. But on Saturday, he unmuzzled himself. \u201cUnlike Donald Trump\u2019s wife, I didn\u2019t plagiarize my speech,\u201d Mr. Khan said, referring to how several lines from a Michelle Obama speech found their way into Melania Trump\u2019s address at the Republican National Convention. \u201cI also wanted to talk about how he\u2019s had three wives, and yet he talks about others\u2019 ethics and their religion,\u201d Mr. Khan said. \u201cShe said, \u2018Don\u2019t go to his level. We are paying tribute to our son. \u2019\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s comments provoked another avalanche of criticism on social media, and again put Republican leaders in a difficult position, facing new demands that they repudiate their presidential nominee. Even before Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks to ABC News, Mr. Khan had asked that Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, and Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, denounce Mr. Trump. On Saturday, neither directly addressed Mr. Trump\u2019s new comments. Don Stewart, a spokesman for Mr. McConnell, referred to Mr. McConnell\u2019s response last year that a ban on Muslims entering the United States would be unacceptable. AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Mr. Ryan, delivered a similar response: \u201cThe speaker has made clear many times that he rejects this idea, and himself has talked about how Muslim Americans have made the ultimate sacrifice for this country. \u201d In the same ABC News interview, when Mr. Stephanopoulos said that Mr. Khan had pointed out that his family would not have been allowed into the United States under Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed ban, the candidate replied, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know that. \u201d And when asked what he would say to the grieving father, Mr. Trump replied, \u201cI\u2019d say, \u2018We\u2019ve had a lot of problems with radical Islamic terrorism. \u2019\u201d Mr. Stephanopoulos also noted that Mr. Khan said that Mr. Trump had \u201csacrificed nothing,\u201d and had lost no one. \u201cI think I\u2019ve made a lot of sacrifices,\u201d Mr. Trump replied. \u201cI\u2019ve worked very, very hard. I\u2019ve created thousands and thousands of jobs. \u201d Some of the fiercest condemnations on Saturday came from Republicans who have argued  \u2014   unsuccessfully to date  \u2014   that Mr. Trump is unfit to be president. Tim Miller, a former communications director for Jeb Bush\u2019s presidential campaign, called Mr. Trump\u2019s comments \u201cinhuman. \u201d \u201cMemo to Trump supporters,\u201d Peter Wehner, a speechwriter for President George W. Bush, wrote on Twitter. \u201cHe\u2019s a man of sadistic cruelty. With him there\u2019s no bottom. Now go ahead  defend him. \u201d Reihan Salam, a conservative writer for National Review and a frequent Trump critic, said that Mr. Trump had an opportunity to declare remorse for the Khans while still holding to his own views as a candidate. \u201cHe might have asked why Humayun Khan had died in the first place  \u2014   because of a war that many, if not most, Americans regard as a tragic blunder,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was really no benefit for Trump in suggesting that Ghazala Khan had been muzzled,\u201d he added, \u201cbecause she could easily come out and say that she had been too   to speak, which she did. \u201d Ibrahim Hooper, the spokesman for the Council on   Relations, said on Saturday, \u201cIt\u2019s really despicable that anyone, let alone a presidential candidate, would choose to dishonor the service of an American who gave his life for this nation. \u201d Ms. Khan, he said, \u201cwas obviously there to support her husband, who was offering what many people believe was the most impactful speech of the entire convention. \u201d As is often the case, Mr. Trump, who has had no campaign events this weekend, managed with a few words to overshadow Mrs. Clinton, who was making several stops in Ohio and Pennsylvania with her running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia. In the ABC News interview, Mr. Trump also hedged over whether he would participate in the three scheduled debates with Mrs. Clinton. He insinuated that she had worked to schedule two during football games so viewership would be lower, and said that the National Football League had sent him a letter complaining about the timing. The debates were scheduled in September of last year by the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates. And while Joe Lockhart, a spokesman for the National Football League, said the league was not thrilled about the scheduling, \u201cwe did not send a letter to Trump. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562301.175354}
