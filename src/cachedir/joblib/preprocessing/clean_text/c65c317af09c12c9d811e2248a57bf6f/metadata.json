Over the next two months, prosecutors appointed by Poland\u2019s   governing party plan to examine the remains of 83 of the 96 people who died in the crash, starting with the former president, Lech Kaczynski, and his wife, Maria. The couple\u2019s bodies were interred in a crypt in a cathedral in Krakow, near the tombs of Poland\u2019s kings and heroes like the military commander Thaddeus Kosciuszko and the poet Adam Mickiewicz. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the former president\u2019s twin brother and the leader of the ruling Law and Justice Party, was on hand for the ceremony, at the Wawel Cathedral. The party has long insisted that investigations by Poland\u2019s former government and the Russian authorities failed to unearth the true cause of the crash. Reopening the investigation was one of the first acts of the new government after assuming power a year ago. So far, the party has offered little more than speculation about what might have caused the crash, pointing to discrepancies in paperwork and supposed missing seconds on flight data recordings to hint that something nefarious must have occurred. Two previous investigations  \u2014   one by the Polish authorities under the previous government and one by the Russian authorities  \u2014   found that the crash was an accident. But supporters of the Law and Justice Party have offered other potential theories. Some believe that Russians caused the plane to crash in heavy fog at a disused military airfield near Smolensk as the Polish leaders were arriving to join a commemoration of a   massacre of thousands of members of Poland\u2019s military and political elite in the Katyn Forest in 1940. Others suspect that a bomb was hidden on the plane, and still others say the crash resulted from negligence by the former Polish government. So far, though, no credible evidence has been released to support those theories. A film called \u201cSmolensk,\u201d based on the bomb theory, was released this year in Poland and given a gala premiere at Warsaw\u2019s opera house, attended by President Andrzej Duda. And some Law and Justice officials have talked about putting the former Prime Minister Donald Tusk  \u2014   now the president of the European Council, which comprises the leaders of the 28 member states of the European Union  \u2014   on trial for what they say is his role in the crash. One of Mr. Tusk\u2019s top aides is already on trial over claims of negligence in preparations for the visit. The aide faces up to three years in prison. The Kaczynskis were exhumed in the presence of prosecutors, priests and family members. Marek Pasionek, the deputy prosecutor general of Poland, said the autopsies were crucial because of \u201cnumerous violations\u201d found in medical documents prepared by the Russian authorities six years ago. Despite initial claims made by Mr. Tusk\u2019s   government that Polish representatives had participated in the initial autopsies in Russia, Mr. Pasionek said that only Russian officials had conducted the examinations. He also said the coffins were sealed before the bodies were returned to Poland. Mr. Pasionek, who is responsible for the investigation, said that court medical experts had found mistakes in 90 percent of the medical records sent by Russia. Further, he said, when nine bodies were exhumed by prosecutors under the previous government, it turned out that six had been misidentified. The decision to exhume the bodies has been vigorously opposed by many of the victims\u2019 families. More than 200 relatives of 17 victims wrote an open letter last month to the Roman Catholic Church, which holds significant influence over Poland\u2019s   government, to join them in opposing the exhumations. \u201cSix years after those tragic days, we are standing alone and helpless against a ruthless and cruel act,\u201d they wrote. \u201cOur loved ones are to be taken out of their graves, in spite of a sacred taboo that forbids disturbing the peace of the dead. \u201d Pawel Deresz, a journalist whose wife, a leading   politician, died in the crash, was one of the signers of the letter. He said he had also complained to the Mr. Pasionek\u2019s boss, Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro. If that complaint is denied, he said, he plans to sue. \u201cI think it would be fair to exhume bodies of those victims whose relatives support this action, but the rest of us should be left alone,\u201d Mr. Deresz said. Mr. Pasionek said there would always be doubt in some minds until every stone is turned. \u201cIf we don\u2019t examine and gather all the evidence that is possible to retrieve at this stage, there will always be some doubts,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will look for possible traces of explosives, but if we don\u2019t find them, we will eliminate the possibility of an attack on the plane. \u201d Magdalena Merta  \u2014   whose husband, Tomasz Merta, a Culture Ministry official, died in the crash  \u2014   said that she wanted to know if \u201cit is my husband who lies in our family vault. \u201d \u201cSix years ago, the previous government blatantly lied to us when they claimed that they had witnessed the autopsies performed by Russians,\u201d Ms. Merta said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why they lied, but it is clear that they defended Russian interests. They acted as an ally of Russians, not Poles. \u201d In the years after the crash, a team of experts led by Antoni Macierewicz, who is now the defense minister, claimed that the plane had been brought down by explosives brought on board. Experts working with Mr. Macierewicz even suggested that Russia had pumped artificial fog over the runway. They tried to prove their theories, in one instance, by boiling sausages and noting that the split along the length of a cooked sausage matched a gash in the plane\u2019s fuselage, indicating that high heat was involved. Independent experts found this evidence dubious at best. And while Mr. Macierewicz claimed over the years to have \u201cirrefutable evidence\u201d of explosives, his experts have yet to produce it. Since 2010, Law and Justice supporters have gathered outside Poland\u2019s presidential palace every month to commemorate the crash and remember its victims. At the most recent gathering, last Thursday, Mr. Kaczynski told the crowd that \u201cPoland will not be truly free without learning the truth\u201d about the crash. \u201cWe want our fight for the truth to be revealed, for the victims of the Smolensk tragedy to be venerated, for monuments to be put up,\u201d he said. Critics of Mr. Kaczynski\u2019s inquiry into his brother\u2019s death say it has been used by the governing party to rally its base, divert the public\u2019s attention and discredit opposition politicians. Mr. Deresz said Mr. Kaczynski\u2019s party had won parliamentary elections by \u201cdividing the Polish people and promising to find the truth\u201d about the crash. \u201cThey claim that it was a terrorist attack\u201d orchestrated by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Mr. Tusk, he said. \u201cI mean this is madness. This is true Smolensk insanity. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562218.9129188}
