Partial transcript as follows (courtesy of RushLimbaugh. com): Let me tell you something, folks. There is an inescapable observation and conclusion, and it is this. You have to look very hard  \u2014   and you have to spend a long time looking  \u2014   to find a genuinely happy or content   political person. Whether they\u2019re an activist or not. If they\u2019re engaged in any way, shape, manner, or form of politics, they\u2019re not happy, no matter what. When they elected Obama, they got angrier. They got more enraged. After every success they have, nothing is ever enough. No amount much success ever makes them happy. Every success they have seems to tell them how little they\u2019ve actually done and how much more there is and how deeply resentful of that they are. The bottom line is: You just don\u2019t encounter happy, laughing liberals. Even their comedians are consumed by hatred. The Democrat Party\u2019s become the largest hate group in this country. Even their comedians are angry and enraged, and that suffices as comedy. I think it\u2019s one of the reasons why   comics have become primary sources of news for other   liberals. So there\u2019s never any happiness, there never is any contentment. You don\u2019t see any real laughter. You just see a constant level of rage  \u2014   and I\u2019m telling you, it isn\u2019t healthy. Talk about sustainable? That cannot be sustained. A healthy mind and heart cannot be sustained by the degree of rage and hatred that we see in the American left today. You have to ask: Why don\u2019t their successes make them happy? Look at what they\u2019ve done in the area of marriage. They\u2019ve totally upended it. They have succeeded in not just redefining a word that has stood for however many number of years  \u2014   tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of years  \u2014   that humans have been plodding and walking the earth. And even after they succeed with this, they get angry. They don\u2019t ever seem satisfied. It\u2019s the most amazing thing. And we\u2019re all paying the price for it, this constant rage, this constant anger. They lose elections, and it is taken as one of the most outrageous things that could happen.
