[\u201cI want to ask you about this case out of Maryland,\u201d ABC News reporter Cecilia Vega began, and went on to say:  As you probably know, the prosecutors have dropped the rape charges against the two, undocumented teens [sic] accused of attacking that    classmate. This White House has been \u2014  was vocal on that case from this podium. Sean Spicer said that \u2018a big of the reason this president has made illegal immigration and crackdown such a big deed \u2014  deal, is because of tragedies like this.\u2019 Vega then made a   expression and asked: \u201cDid this White House unfairly jump to conclusions in this case?\u201d On Mar. 16, Maryland police arrested two illegal alien suspects,    Guatemalan Henry E. Sanchez Milian and    El Salvadoran Jose Montano, after staff at Rockville High School in Maryland reported an alleged rape of a    freshman who claimed to a police detective she had been raped orally, anally, and vaginally simultaneously by the two suspects after being stripped naked and \u201cbent over a toilet\u201d in the boys\u2019 bathroom. A forensic specialist found blood and bodily fluids in the bathroom after the alleged victim said she was raped.  Prosecutors in the case, which sparked a national uproar, said on Friday they planned to drop the   rape and sex offense charges, citing the \u201cchallenges corroborating events the girl described,\u201d according to the Washington Post. The alleged victim had exchanged   text messages and images with at least one of the alleged assailants beforehand. Sanchez Milian will likely face child pornography charges, however. White House press secretary Sean Spicer had expressed indignation at the alleged   of the    freshman. Spicer said at the White House in late March: This is a tragic event, and it is horrendous, and horrible, and disgusting what this young woman in Rockville went through. I can\u2019t possibly imagine. Part of the reason the president has made illegal immigration and [a] crackdown such a big deal is because of tragedies like this. Part of the reason is the tragedy this young girl dealt with, had inflicted upon her, whatever the word is. This is why he\u2019s passionate about this. Because people are victims of these crimes. But since prosecutors dropped some of the charges against the   suspects \u2014  and have decided to pursue others \u2014  leftist reporters thought they had a \u201cgotcha\u201d moment against anyone concerned about illegal immigration. \u201cLook, I think we\u2019re always looking to protect the American people,\u201d Sanders replied. \u201cSean was speaking about what he knew at the time. And certainly, I haven\u2019t had a chance to dive into the latest on that, but we will, and we\u2019ll get back to you. \u201d \u201cYou wanna retract anything that \u2014  that the White House has said so far?\u201d Vega said. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna retract anything without further information in front of me,\u201d Sanders said. Bizarrely, another CBS reporter wanted to know if the White House regretted speaking about a national scandal that would never have happened had illegal immigration from Central America been stymied, not encouraged, during the Obama years. \u201cHave you talked to Sean and does he have any regrets about what he said?\u201d CBS News\u2019s Chip Reid asked. \u201cI have not talked to Sean,\u201d Sanders said, adding he was on Navy duty. Another reporter asked if \u201cthere is a general danger that the White House, through its rhetoric, is animating too many people to jump to conclusions against immigrants [sic] and in the process, diminishing the entire immigrant community [sic] whether they\u2019re   or not?\u201d \u201cNot at all,\u201d Sanders said, adding, \u201cThe president has been incredibly outspoken against crime in any form, fashion \u2014  certainly from his joint address, to his speech last week on Holocaust Remembrance Day. Look, this is a    president. He\u2019s focused on restoring law and order. We\u2019ve seen a spike in crime rates, starting in 2015, across the board, not just in any particular sector. I think that\u2019s why he campaigned and talked so much about needing to restore law and order in this country. It\u2019s why he\u2019s focused on securing our border \u2014  stopping drug trafficking, human trafficking. Those are things that have been a priority for him. And I think the reason is, is because he places such a high value on that. And I think to call into question his rhetoric, to be anything other than someone who has condemned hate and violence in all of its forms, is simply a complete misrepresentation. Not only of who the president is, but also what he\u2019s said. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563192.6974063}
