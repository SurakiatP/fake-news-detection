With Mr. Gray shackled but not belted in the back of the van, Officer Caesar R. Goodson Jr. ran through a stop sign and took a sharp right turn, driving so fast that he did not stay in his lane, a prosecutor, Michael Schatzow, said. Had Officer Goodson buckled Mr. Gray, or called promptly for medical attention, he said, the young man would be alive today. \u201cHe was injured because he got a rough ride,\u201d Mr. Schatzow told Judge Barry G. Williams of Baltimore City Circuit Court, adding: \u201cThere was no good reason for the officer to repeatedly fail to seatbelt Mr. Gray except to bounce him around. \u201d It was the first time that prosecutors have used the words \u201crough ride\u201d in connection with Mr. Gray  \u2014   a compelling opener to a   trial playing out more than a year after the violent unrest set off by Mr. Gray\u2019s death in April 2015. Experts said the rough ride argument would be difficult to prove, adding to the challenges faced by prosecutors, who have already tried two of the six officers facing charges in Mr. Gray\u2019s death, and so far failed to win any convictions. Officer Goodson, 47, a department veteran, faces the most serious charges of any of the six, and is the only one who did not give investigators a statement. Thursday was the first time his story has been told his defense lawyer, Andrew Graham, painted him as a \u201cdecent man\u201d who acted in \u201cgood faith. \u201d Mr. Graham told the judge that Mr. Gray caused his own death, by thrashing around in the van or trying to stand up as it was moving. \u201cAn accident can be just an accident,\u201d Mr. Graham said, \u201cand the cause of the accident can be the person himself who was injured. \u201d At Officer Goodson\u2019s request, the case will be decided by Judge Williams, not a jury. Even before it got underway Thursday, it took a dramatic turn, as a furious Judge Williams berated Mr. Schatzow and his team for withholding evidence critical to the officer\u2019s defense  \u2014   information about prosecutors\u2019 meeting in May 2015 with Donta Allen, a suspect who rode in the back of the van with Mr. Gray and is a potential witness in the case. Prosecutors said the meeting, their second with Mr. Allen, produced only \u201csilly\u201d information that was not relevant. The judge sharply disagreed, declaring the meeting \u201cextremely exculpatory. \u201d He ordered prosecutors to share any additional information that might be relevant by Monday morning, demanding: \u201cWhat else is out there that you haven\u2019t turned over?\u201d Officer Goodson faces seven charges in all, including manslaughter and reckless endangerment, in addition to \u201csecond degree depraved heart murder. \u201d Legal experts say it will be especially difficult for prosecutors to prove the murder charge, which will require them to show that the officer acted with willful indifference to Mr. Gray\u2019s life. \u201cThis is now about a rough ride,\u201d said Warren Alperstein, who frequently represents police officers, but is not involved in the Gray cases. He said much would depend on what evidence the state produces to prove its case: \u201cIs it going to be surveillance video? Is it going to be bystander witness testimony?\u201d Many details of the case are familiar by now. On April 12, 2015, Mr. Gray was walking with friends in the downtrodden Sandtown neighborhood of West Baltimore when he spotted a group of police officers and ran. They pursued, detained and arrested Mr. Gray, and Officer Goodson responded to the scene with a prisoner transport van. The officers eventually placed Mr. Gray, who was handcuffed and wore leg shackles, inside the van, but did not secure him with a seatbelt. One of those arresting officers, Edward M. Nero, was acquitted late last month of four misdemeanors in the case. The trial of another officer, William Porter, who arrived as backup, ended in a hung jury last year. With Officer Goodson at the wheel, the van made a total of six stops through West Baltimore. In court on Thursday, Mr. Schatzow said medical evidence would show that Mr. Gray was injured by hitting his head before the fourth stop, and that doctors could have saved him. But Mr. Graham said defense experts would testify that Mr. Gray\u2019s injury happened later, was catastrophic, and that medical care would not have made a difference. Officer Porter\u2019s testimony is expected to be crucial to the case against Officer Goodson, because he can tell the court what he and Officer Goodson discussed about Mr. Gray\u2019s condition, and when. Whether Officer Goodson will testify in his own defense is unclear defense lawyers have not said. But they did indicate on Thursday that they would call Mr. Allen, who rode in the van with Mr. Gray. He has said Mr. Gray was thrashing about in the back of the van  \u2014   a remark that would seem to bolster the defense  \u2014   but later recanted that statement in television interviews. The courtroom was packed for Thursday\u2019s opening arguments, with a crew of familiar faces who have been sitting through the trials. Among them was Tessa   the president of Baltimore\u2019s branch of the N. A. A. C. P. who said her organization often receives complaints of rough rides. She sounded pleased to hear the issue raised in court: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get some hits where someone is taking responsibility for Freddie Gray\u2019s death. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628496.6002913}
