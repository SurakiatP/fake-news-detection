[Last Thursday, the state\u2019s House Public Safety Committee passed a resolution demanding extra resources for any potential attack, which includes the redevelopment of shelters last used during the Cold War.  Amongst other things, the resolution asks for the \u201crestocking of fallout shelter provisions,\u201d as well as calling on authorities to \u201cconduct public awareness campaigns to ready the public for a nuclear disaster. \u201d \u201cAt a time when we have this kind of   and really blustering foreign policy, it does make people a little nervous,\u201d said House Public Safety Committee Vice Chairman Matt LePresti. \u201cThey haven\u2019t been updated since 1985. I was 11 years old when they were last updated. Many of the buildings that are on the fallout shelter list don\u2019t exist anymore. \u201d Many experts have warned that Hawaii may be the first point of any potential North Korean attack, with its location in the   ocean far more reachable than the American west coast. The remote island is located 4, 660 miles from North Korea, while Los Angeles remains approximately 5, 800 miles in distance. An analysis carried by the BBC suggests that North Korea possesses over 1, 000 missiles, all with ranging capabilities. Some of their weapons, including the   ballistic missile, have an intercontinental range, meaning they can travel up to 5000 miles, just short of the American coastline. The request comes amidst rising tensions between the U. S. and North Korea, with Donald Trump warning last week that he was sending \u201can armada\u201d into the region to fend off any potential threat. Meanwhile, on Sunday, North Korean forces held a military parade to celebrate the 105th birthday of former leader Kim   who remains the country\u2019s \u201ceternal leader. \u201d However, reports from South Korea also indicated that the country\u2019s planned missile launch, intended to be a show of strength, ended in failure. On Monday, Vice President Mike Pence visited the Korean demilitarized zone, also the border between South and North. In an interview with CNN, Pence said that \u201cthe people in North Korea should make no mistake that the United States of America and our allies will see to the security of this region and see to the security of the people of our country. \u201d You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart. com'"}, "time": 1742564169.7021942}
