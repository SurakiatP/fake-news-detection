On Saturday morning, anyone with a smartphone could see that Air Zimbabwe Flight 1, as the plane is known, was hugging Africa\u2019s eastern coast on its way home to Harare, the capital, after four days in Dubai. The flight designation, UM1, meant that President Robert Mugabe, the world\u2019s oldest head of state, was on board. Mr. Mugabe\u2019s trip to the Middle East had been made suddenly, with no explanation from the secretive Zimbabwean government, fueling rumors that the president was deathly ill and desperately seeking medical treatment overseas. The main political opposition helped feed those rumors, with one of its leaders posting online, in a tone of great authority, that Mr. Mugabe had suffered a stroke and that it was unlikely \u201che can come back from this. \u201d But ordinary Zimbabweans and journalists were left with hardly any verifiable facts, other than what flight tracking apps could tell them. And it was not the first time. In March, when Mr. Mugabe was traveling in Asia, he canceled a visit to India at the last minute, and the government refused to reveal his whereabouts. The apps showed that his plane was in Singapore, one of the places where he has received medical treatment in recent years. (The government said he had cataract surgery there and was otherwise healthy, but a 2008 American diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks said he had been treated in Singapore for prostate cancer.) The president\u2019s health has been an   topic this year for Zimbabweans of all classes, as the effects of age and possible illness have become harder for Mr. Mugabe to hide. Many Zimbabweans, who have known only one leader since gaining independence 36 years ago, are bracing for the future with the same trepidation that many Chinese felt near the end of Mao Zedong\u2019s long rule, or that the Congolese did with Mobutu Sese Seko. They speak about \u201cwhen the old man goes\u201d or \u201cwhen nature takes its course. \u201d The uncertainty of a   political order compounds the anxieties. The political class is engulfed in a ferocious fight over succession, and it is far from clear where the security forces, the traditional guarantors of Mr. Mugabe\u2019s power, will stand. In the capital, politicians and diplomats report that Mr. Mugabe has slowed down considerably in the past year. He works only a few hours a day and says little in meetings. Several times, he has been caught on video stumbling or falling asleep at public events. Like most wealthy Zimbabweans, Mr. Mugabe goes abroad for better medical care than he can get at home. That narrows the circle of Zimbabweans who are truly informed about his health  \u2014   and it means that every time he flies, especially on extended or unannounced trips outside Africa, the rumors fly as well, often claiming that he has died or is at death\u2019s door. \u201cThere will never be a thing called a vacuum, so if the officials are not giving information, rumors will fill the vacuum,\u201d said Tendai Biti, the president of an opposition party, the People\u2019s Democratic Party. \u201cThe feelings of uncertainty are a byproduct of a very unstable environment created by the president himself. \u201d \u201cBut this is not unique to Zimbabwe,\u201d added Mr. Biti, who served as finance minister in a coalition government from 2009 to 2013. \u201cMobutu used to die so many times. In Uganda, Idi Amin used to die so many times. In China, Chairman Mao used to die so many times. In Russia, how many times did Brezhnev used to die?\u201d This time, the speculation about Mr. Mugabe seemed to have more foundation than usual. He had been scheduled to go to Ghana in   to receive a lifetime achievement award from the Millennium Excellence Foundation for helping to liberate Zimbabwe, but canceled the trip at the last minute. When he resurfaced several days later at an agricultural show, his appearance merely fanned the flames. He seemed to stumble at one point and was apparently wearing slippers rather than shoes with his suit. Mr. Mugabe appeared to bounce back, flying to Kenya on Aug. 26 for a conference, followed by a meeting in Swaziland. After that, however, UM1\u2019s movements began raising alarms in some circles. The plane left Swaziland a day before the conference ended, spent three hours in Harare and then took off again for Dubai, arriving on the morning of Aug. 31. Days of silence ensued. The government said only that Mr. Mugabe was in the Middle East on official business. The Sept. 1 headline on the independent newspaper NewsDay read, \u201cMystery Over Mugabe Trip. \u201d \u201cEach time you people don\u2019t know the purpose of the president\u2019s visit, there is always a default explanation that he is ill,\u201d George Charamba, Mr. Mugabe\u2019s spokesman, was quoted in the article as saying. Eddie Cross, a lawmaker with the main opposition party, Movement for Democratic Change, wrote on his blog the next day, \u201cWe hear that the Old Man had a stroke. \u201d He added, \u201cIt would have been so much more dignified if he had recognized that his \u2018sell by\u2019 date had arrived and he had retired and handed over to a chosen successor. \u201d UM1 took off again after midnight on Saturday, and by 6 a. m. the tracking apps had it over the waters between Mozambique and Madagascar, headed southwest. Journalists and officials began to gather at Harare\u2019s airport, where the sun shone in a clear sky on a fine spring morning. When the plane landed at 7:58, reporters for the state news media were ushered onto the tarmac. \u201cYes, it\u2019s true,\u201d Mr. Mugabe told them cheerfully. \u201cI was dead, and I resurrected, as I always do. \u201d He said he had gone to Dubai to check up on his elder son, Robert Jr. an architecture student. Speculation immediately turned to whether Mr. Mugabe\u2019s allies had churned up false rumors of his death to discredit the independent news media and the political opposition. Zimbabwe\u2019s central intelligence organization has a history of spreading disinformation. Mr. Cross, the opposition lawmaker, said by phone that he had based his blog post on information from intelligence officials, members of the governing   party, South African intelligence officials and a minister. Conjuring a scene from the macabre comedy \u201cWeekend at Bernie\u2019s,\u201d Mr. Cross argued that Mr. Mugabe\u2019s allies were propping up a dying president to maintain their hold on power. At the airport, a reporter asked Mr. Mugabe whether he was a ghost. \u201cOnce I get back to my country,\u201d he replied, \u201cI am real. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563280.2316673}
