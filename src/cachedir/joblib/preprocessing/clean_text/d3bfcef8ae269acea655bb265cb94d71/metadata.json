Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump returned to the campaign trail, but their first debate on Monday night dominated headlines. The ratings alone were newsworthy: 84 million viewers, possibly the most for a debate ever. Mrs. Clinton reveled in largely positive reviews, while Mr. Trump\u2019s main strength was on trade issues. Mr. Trump has raised a host of complaints about the debate, including about his microphone and Lester Holt, the moderator. An unexpectedly powerful issue: his derision of a Latina beauty queen for gaining weight after winning the 1996 Miss Universe pageant. Above, Mrs. Clinton at a rally in North Carolina. _____ 2. Syrian government troops pushed into the ravaged city of Aleppo, backed by the fifth day of aerial bombardments by allied Syrian and Russian forces. Rebel forces disputed the government\u2019s claim of a major advance, but the city suffered possibly the most ferocious assaults in five years of civil war. \u201cEvery day is worse than the last,\u201d one desperate resident said. \u201cEvery day I leave my house, I keep in mind that I might not be back. \u201d _____ 3. Shimon Peres, one of the last pillars of Israel\u2019s founding generation, died two weeks after suffering a massive stroke. He was 93. In a statement, former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton said, \u201cHe was a genius with a big heart who used his gifts to imagine a future of reconciliation not conflict, economic and social empowerment not anger and frustration, and a nation, a region, and a world enhanced by caring and sharing, not torn asunder by the illusions of permanent dominance and perfect truth. \u201d 4. \u201cIt\u2019s just a   funding bill,\u201d the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, groused. He was exasperated after a mix of Democrats and Republicans blocked his effort to advance a temporary spending bill that would head off a government shutdown this weekend. The vote fell 15 votes short of the 60 needed for passage. The issue: Democrats refuse to pass a bill that includes flood relief for Louisiana unless it also includes help for the   crisis bedeviling Flint, Mich. _____ 5. The man who has admitted responsibility for the 2013 Bridgegate scandal in New Jersey directly tied Gov. Chris Christie to the events. David Wildstein, who worked at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said he told Mr. Christie during a Sept. 11 memorial service about organizing the closing of lanes leading to the George Washington Bridge. The point was to snarl traffic in Fort Lee, N. J. as a punishment for the town\u2019s mayor. Mr. Christie, he said, laughed. _____ 6. One of our   stories today is about Alton Brown\u2019s eighth cookbook, \u201cEveryDayCook: This Time It\u2019s Personal. \u201d Or rather, it\u2019s about a glimpse of the person behind the food TV showman: supersmart, politically conservative, divorced, in a midlife crisis. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018Who the heck am I?\u2019 time,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve spent years projecting and presenting this thing, but in the end, what am I? I thought it was important to put something on paper. \u201d _____ 7. Judges in the Hague sentenced this radical Islamist, Ahmad     to nine years in prison for his role in demolishing historic Muslim shrines in Timbuktu, Mali. It was the International Criminal Court\u2019s first prosecution for the destruction of cultural heritage as a war crime. _____ 8. The W. H. O. \u2019s most comprehensive analysis so far of outdoor air quality worldwide revealed that 92 percent of the world\u2019s people breathe unhealthy air. The report linked about three million deaths a year to outdoor air pollution, mostly from cardiovascular, pulmonary and other disease. The   areas are Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific region. _____ 9. The tech billionaire Elon Musk laid out the details of his plan to get people to Mars. In fact, to colonize Mars. His plans for his SpaceX company don\u2019t stop there  \u2014   he spoke of an Interplanetary Transit System capable of ferrying scores of passengers at a time to other planets. \u201cIt\u2019s something we can do in our lifetimes,\u201d he said, in a presentation to the International Astronautical Congress. More than 100, 000 people watched the  . _____ 10. A bill awaiting President Obama\u2019s signature gives most Olympic and Paralympic medalists a tax break. For those who earn less than $1 million a year, the measure designates the value of their medals and their bonuses  \u2014   $25, 000 for every gold, $15, 000 for every silver and $10, 000 for every bronze  \u2014    . The one representative who voted against the bill, Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut, said Congress should be dealing with more urgent matters. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a Zika crisis, an opium epidemic and gun violence in the news every day,\u201d he said. _____ 11. Finally, Leonard Nimoy died last year, but his Spock lives on and prospers in the minds of many fans. The actor\u2019s son, Adam Nimoy, pictured with him above, discovered one crucial reason in the course of making his documentary \u201cFor the Love of Spock. \u201d The character was not just an outsider and a principal in the   bromance he was also a rare multiracial role model on American television. A   Los Angeles artist said: \u201cEvery time McCoy would say, you\u2019re   and Spock would say, I\u2019m also   I was like, \u2018Yeah, I get that.\u2019 \u201d _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.
