Comey seemed pro-Clinton when he dropped the initial email case.\\n2. Comey seems anti-Clinton this week because he announced a new round of investigations right before the election.\\nSo, how can both behaviors be explained? \\nFirst some background from Adams on \u2018The Persuasion Filter\u2019 :\\nAs my regular readers know, the Persuasion Filter is related to the idea that the human brain never evolved to accurately comprehend reality . In order for us to be here today, our predecessors only needed to survive and procreate. They had no need to understand reality at any basic level. And we have no such need either. That\u2019s why you might believe you are reincarnated from a monk and I might believe my prophet flew to heaven on a winged horse but we can both get through the day just fine. Many different interpretations of reality are good enough for survival. I like to describe reality as each person living their own movie, which works well unless our script\u2019s conflict. When that happens, one of us goes into cognitive dissonance and rewrites our past to make the movies consistent. \\nThat\u2019s how I see the world.\\nLast year in this blog I suggested that the most productive and predictive way to view reality is through what I call the Persuasion Filter. That\u2019s what I have been using to make spooky-good predictions about the election so far. And that\u2019s what I\u2019ll use today to give you an alternate movie about James Comey. Compare it to the movie you are running in your head and see which one better predicts the future.\\nThe base assumption of the Persuasion Filter is that people are irrational 90% of the time and only rarely \u2013 when no emotions are involved \u2013 truly rational. This is the reverse of the common filter for reality, in which people are assumed to be rational 90% of the time and a bit crazy 10% of the time. That\u2019s some background for context.\\nRead more here\u2026 \\nSo, back to Comey, Adams asks \u2013 which movie does the best job of explaining our observations and also predicting the future? \\nSome say Comey is a political pawn in a rigged system. By that movie script we can explain why he dropped the initial email case. But we can\u2019t explain why he\u2019s acting against Clinton\u2019s interests now. What changed?\\nWell, some say Comey had to reopen the case against Clinton after discovering the Weiner laptop emails. If he failed to act, there might be a revolt at the FBI and maybe a whistleblower would come forward . But that leaves unexplained why Comey detailed to Congress how Clinton appeared to be guilty of crimes at the same time he said the FBI was dropping the case. If Comey had been protecting Clinton on the first round, he would have softened his description of her misdeeds, wouldn\u2019t he? But he didn\u2019t seem to hold back anything.\\nAnd none of those hypotheses explain why the people who know Comey have high regard for his integrity. Comey also has the security of a 10-year appointment as Director, so he has a low chance of getting fired or politically influenced. That\u2019s exactly why the job has a 10-year term. Given what we know of Comey before any of the Clinton emails, any movie that casts Comey as an ass-covering weasel is probably making a casting mistake.\\nSo allow me to offer an interpretation of events that casts Comey as more of a patriot and hero than an ass-covering weasel. Compare my interpretation with whatever movie you have in your head and see which one works best for explaining and predicting.\\nMy movie says Comey had good evidence against Clinton during the initial investigation but made a judgement call to leave the decision to the American public . For reasons of conscience, and acting as a patriot, Comey explained in clear language to the public exactly what evidence the FBI found against Clinton. The evidence looked damning because it was. Under this interpretation, Comey took a bullet to his reputation for the sake of the Republic. He didn\u2019t want the FBI to steal this important decision away from the people, but at the same time he couldn\u2019t let the people decide blind. So he divulged the evidence and stepped away, like the action hero who doesn\u2019t look back at the explosion. \\nIn the second act of this movie, Comey learns that the Weiner laptop had emails that were so damning it would be a crime against the public to allow them to vote without first seeing a big red flag. And a flag was the best he could do because it was too early in the investigation to leak out bits and pieces of the evidence. That would violate Clinton\u2019s rights.\\nBut Comey couldn\u2019t easily raise a red flag to warn the public because it was against FBI policy to announce a criminal investigation about a candidate so close to election day. So Comey had a choice of either taking another bullet for the Republic or screwing the very country that he has spent his career protecting. \\nIn this movie, Comey did the hero thing. He alerted the public to the fact that the FBI found DISQUALIFYING information on the Weiner laptop. And he took a second bullet to his reputation. \\nHow do I know the new emails are that bad? \\nI start by assuming Comey is the same man now as the one who was carefully vetted before being hired to protect the integrity of one of our most important institutions. And even Comey\u2019s critics concede he\u2019s smart. \\nSo\u2026\\nThe way you know the new emails are disqualifying for Clinton is because otherwise our hero would have privately informed Congress and honored the tradition of not influencing elections. Comey is smart enough to know his options. And unless he suddenly turned rotten at his current age, he\u2019s got the character to jump in front of a second bullet for the Republic.\\nAccording to this movie, no matter who gets elected, we\u2019ll eventually learn of something disqualifying in the Weiner emails.\\nAnd we can\u2019t say we weren\u2019t warned. Comey took two bullets to do it. \\nSo compare this movie to your own movie and see which one does the best job of explaining the observed facts. And when we find out what is in the Weiner laptop emails, compare that news to my prediction that the information is disqualifying.\\nThe Persuasion Filter says there is no preferred reality. We all see our own movies. In my movie, Comey\u2019s has a consistent personality from start to finish. He starts out his career as a smart, competent patriot and he later proves it by taking two bullets for the Republic. If your movie script has Comey suddenly changing his basic character for this election season, don\u2019t expect an Oscar. \\nRead more here\u2026 \\nOf course if you\u2019re a Democrat, this is all irrelevant and Comey is \u201cA Putin puppet\u201d (Howard Dean), \u201ca federal law-breaker who should never have been appointed\u201d (Harry Reid), and \u201ca partisan, prejudiced individual\u201d (Eric Holder)\u2026\\nNEW: Former Attorney General Holder, dozens of other former DOJ officials pen letter criticizing FBI director Comey. https://t.co/aXmWvAiFMg pic.twitter.com/FskFeDpoyE \\n\u2014 ABC News (@ABC) October 31, 2016 \\n\\nYou decide which makes more sense \u2013 Scott Adams\u2019 \u201cmovie\u201d or the real partisan hacks above?
