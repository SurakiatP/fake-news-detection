Mr Netanyahu has presented this as a rebuff to those who accuse him of jeopardising Israeli security interests with his government\\x92s repeated affronts to the White House.\\nIn the past weeks alone, defence minister Avigdor Lieberman has compared last year\\x92s nuclear deal between Washington and Iran with the 1938 Munich pact, which bolstered Hitler; and Mr Netanyahu has implied that US opposition to settlement expansion is the same as support for the \\x93ethnic cleansing\\x94 of Jews.\\nAmerican president Barack Obama, meanwhile, hopes to stifle his own critics who insinuate that he is anti-Israel. The deal should serve as a fillip too for Hillary Clinton, the Democratic party\\x92s candidate to succeed Mr Obama in November\\x92s election.\\nIn reality, however, the Obama administration has quietly punished Mr Netanyahu for his misbehaviour. Israeli expectations of a $4.5bn-a-year deal were whittled down after Mr Netanyahu stalled negotiations last year as he sought to recruit Congress to his battle against the Iran deal.\\nIn fact, Israel already receives roughly $3.8bn \\x96 if Congress\\x92s assistance on developing missile defence programmes is factored in. Notably, Israel has been forced to promise not to approach Congress for extra funds.\\nThe deal takes into account neither inflation nor the dollar\\x92s depreciation against the shekel.\\nA bigger blow still is the White House\\x92s demand to phase out a special exemption that allowed Israel to spend nearly 40 per cent of aid locally on weapon and fuel purchases. Israel will soon have to buy all its armaments from the US, ending what amounted to a subsidy to its own arms industry.\\nNonetheless, Washington\\x92s renewed military largesse \\x96 in the face of almost continual insults \\x96 inevitably fuels claims that the Israeli tail is wagging the US dog. Even The New York Times has described the aid package as \\x93too big\\x94.\\nSince the 1973 war, Israel has received at least $100bn in military aid, with more assistance hidden from view. Back in the 1970s, Washington paid half of Israel\\x92s military budget. Today it still foots a fifth of the bill, despite Israel\\x92s economic success.\\nBut the US expects a return on its massive investment. As the late Israeli politician-general Ariel Sharon once observed, \\xadIsrael has been a US \\x93aircraft carrier\\x94 in the Middle East, acting as the regional bully and carrying out operations that benefit Washington.\\nAlmost no one blames the US for Israeli attacks that wiped out Iraq\\x92s and Syria\\x92s nuclear programmes. A nuclear-armed Iraq or Syria would have deterred later US-backed moves at regime overthrow, as well as countering the strategic advantage Israel derives from its own nuclear arsenal.\\nIn addition, Israel\\x92s US-sponsored military prowess is a triple boon to the US weapons industry, the country\\x92s most powerful lobby. Public funds are siphoned off to let Israel buy goodies from American arms makers. That, in turn, serves as a shop window for other customers and spurs an endless and lucrative game of catch-up in the rest of the Middle East.\\nThe first F-35 fighter jets to arrive in Israel in December \\x96 their various components produced in 46 US states \\x96 will increase the clamour for the cutting-edge warplane.\\nIsrael is also a \\x93front-line laboratory\\x94, as former Israeli army negotiator Eival Gilady admitted at the weekend, that develops and field-tests new technology Washington can later use itself.\\nThe US is planning to buy back the missile interception system Iron Dome \\x96 which neutralises battlefield threats of retaliation \\x96 it largely paid for. Israel works closely too with the US in developing cyber\\xadwarfare, such as the Stuxnet worm that damaged Iran\\x92s civilian nuclear programme.\\nBut the clearest message from Israel\\x92s new aid package is one delivered to the Palestinians: Washington sees no pressing strategic interest in ending the occupation. It stood up to Mr Netanyahu over the Iran deal but will not risk a damaging clash over Palestinian statehood.\\nSome believe that Mr Obama signed the aid package to win the credibility necessary to overcome his domestic Israel lobby and pull a rabbit from the hat: an initiative, unveiled shortly before he leaves office, that corners Mr Netanyahu into making peace.\\nHopes have been raised by an expected meeting at the United Nations in New York on Wednesday. But their first talks in 10 months are planned only to demonstrate unity to confound critics of the aid deal.\\nIf Mr Obama really wanted to pressure Mr Netanyahu, he would have used the aid agreement as leverage. Now Mr Netanyahu need not fear US financial retaliation, even as he intensifies effective annexation of the West Bank.\\nMr Netanyahu has drawn the right lesson from the aid deal \\x96 he can act against the Palestinians with continuing US impunity.\\n- See more at: http://www.jonathan-cook.net/2016-09-19/palestinians-lose-in-us-military-aid-deal-with-israel/#sthash.fL4Eq28N.dpuf Can U.S. Elections Really Be Stolen? Yes By Mark Crispin Miller\\nIs election theft possible in the United States? And might the suspects live closer to home than the Kremlin?
