When asked for his opinion, Dennard, who is a regular contributor to CNN and former and served as an advisor to George. W. Bush, said that the \u201cthe president is not breaking any laws, and he\u2019s not doing anything. It\u2019s a fake news story. \u201d Visibly irritated, Lemon demanded that he \u201cplease stop it with that stupid talking point, that it is a fake news story. \u201d \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to participate in the news stories on this network, then don\u2019t come on and participate. But don\u2019t call them fake because you don\u2019t agree with them,\u201d he continued. However, Dennard refused to back down on the claim that it is a \u201cfake news\u201d story, at which point Lemon abruptly ended the segment. WATCH: A CNN later spokesperson later told Mediaite: \u201cDon said prior to getting to Paris Denard [sic] \u2018this is short and I want to get everyone in.\u2019 He was running up against time to end the show and the conversation went long. That is the reason the show ended as it did. \u201d  The incident is further evidence of rising concern at CNN over rising dissatisfaction with their biased, and sometimes unfactual reporting. Donald Trump has consistently lambasted the network, describing it as part of the \u201cfake news media\u201d who are the \u201cenemy of the American people. \u201d The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!  \u2014   Donald J.
