He was 53. A police statement said: \u201cThames Valley Police were called to a property in    shortly before 2 p. m. Christmas Day. Sadly, a    man was confirmed deceased at the scene. At this stage the death is being treated as unexplained but not suspicious. \u201d Mr. Michael\u2019s manager, Michael Lippman, told The Hollywood Reporter that Mr. Michael had died of heart failure \u201cin bed, lying peacefully. \u201d \u201cIt is with great sadness that we can confirm our beloved son, brother and friend George passed away peacefully at home over the Christmas period,\u201d his publicist Connie Filippello said in a statement. \u201cThe family would ask that their privacy be respected at this difficult and emotional time. There will be no further comment at this stage. \u201d Information on survivors was not immediately available. Mr. Michael was one of pop\u2019s reigning stars in the 1980s and \u201990s  \u2014   first as a handsome, smiling   idol making lighthearted singles like \u201cWake Me Up Before You  \u201d with Wham! then arriving as a   pop sex symbol with his 1987 album \u201cFaith. \u201d But Mr. Michael grew increasingly uncomfortable with the superficiality and relentless promotion of   pop stardom. He turned away from video clips and live shows he set out to make more mature statements in his songs, though he never completely abandoned singing about love and desire. [ Why George Michael mattered | Watch him perform live ] Mr. Michael wrote supple ballads, like \u201cCareless Whisper\u201d and \u201cFather Figure,\u201d as well as buoyant dance tracks like \u201cFreedom \u201990\u201d and \u201cI Want Your Sex. \u201d For much of his career, including his   albums \u201cFaith\u201d and \u201cListen Without Prejudice Vol. 1,\u201d he was also his own producer and studio backup band. Much of his music drew on RB, old and new, but his melodic gift extended across genres. He won a Grammy Award in 1988 for \u201cI Knew You Were Waiting (for Me),\u201d a duet with Aretha Franklin, and \u201cFaith\u201d won the Grammy for album of the year. In Britain, he was showered with awards, and in 2004, Britain\u2019s Radio Academy said he had been the   performer on British radio from 1984 to 2004. In 1998, Mr. Michael came out as gay after being arrested on charges of lewd conduct in a men\u2019s room in Beverly Hills, Calif. He had long lent his name and music to support AIDS prevention and gay rights. During interviews in later years, he described himself as bisexual, and said that hiding his sexuality had made him feel \u201cfraudulent. \u201d He also described long struggles with depression. During the 2000s, Mr. Michael\u2019s output slowed his last studio album of new songs was \u201cPatience\u201d in 2004. In later years he put out individual songs as free downloads, encouraging listeners to contribute to charity. But in 2006, 25 years into his career, he could still headline stadiums worldwide. George Michael was born Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou in East Finchley, London, on June 25, 1963, the son of a Greek Cypriot restaurateur and an English dancer. In 1979, he and a schoolmate, Andrew Ridgeley, played together for the first time in a ska band called the Executive. That didn\u2019t last, but they continued to make music together  \u2014   nearly all of it composed and sung by Mr. Michael  \u2014   and began releasing singles as Wham! cultivating the image of carefree teenage rebels in songs like \u201cYoung Guns (Go for It! ). \u201d Their 1983 debut album, \u201cFantastic,\u201d reached No. 1 in Britain in the United States, their 1984 single \u201cWake Me Up Before You  \u201d became ubiquitous on MTV and reached No. 1. In 1985, the duo became the first major Western pop group to perform in China as part of its world tour, and Mr. Michael appeared at the Live Aid charity concert, telecast worldwide, joining Elton John to sing Mr. John\u2019s song \u201cDon\u2019t Let the Sun Go Down on Me. \u201d The worldwide 1984 hit \u201cCareless Whisper,\u201d credited in Britain to George Michael solo and to Wham! featuring George Michael in the United States, signaled a turn away from perky teenage fare. Mr. Michael\u2019s status as a top British pop star was confirmed by his appearance on Band Aid\u2019s \u201cDo They Know It\u2019s Christmas? ,\u201d the 1984   benefit single for Ethiopian famine relief. In 1986, Wham! dissolved, with a farewell show at Wembley Stadium. Mr. Michael had a No. 1 hit with \u201cI Knew You Were Waiting (for Me)\u201d before releasing the album \u201cFaith\u201d in 1987. Its first single, \u201cI Want Your Sex,\u201d reached No. 2 in the United States, though it was seen as too risqu\u00e9 by some radio stations Mr. Michael made an introduction to its video clip stating, \u201cThis song is not about casual sex. \u201d \u201cFaith,\u201d which hinted at both gospel and rockabilly, reached No. 1, and the album included three more No. 1 hits: \u201cFather Figure,\u201d \u201cMonkey\u201d and \u201cOne More Try. \u201d It has sold more than 10 million copies in the United States. But for his next album, \u201cListen Without Prejudice Vol. 1,\u201d released in 1990, Mr. Michael set out to jettison his pop persona. \u201cI\u2019m not stupid enough to think I can deal with another 10 or 15 years of major exposure,\u201d he told an interviewer at the time. \u201cI think that\u2019s the ultimate tragedy of fame, people who are simply out of control, who are lost. I\u2019ve seen so many of them, and I don\u2019t want to be another clich\u00e9. \u201d The autobiographical \u201cFreedom \u201990\u201d declared his independence from the pop machine he wasn\u2019t in its video clip, which had supermodels   the lyrics. The album also included a No. 1 single, the ballad \u201cPraying for Time,\u201d and has sold two million copies in the United States, but after the blockbuster of \u201cFaith\u201d it was considered a commercial letdown. Mr. Michael entered a protracted legal battle with Sony Music over his contract, and was unable to release another album until 1996. Its title, \u201cOlder,\u201d was an unmistakable signal that he was no longer directly courting the youth market he was 32 years old. The album was an instant hit in England and Europe  \u2014   it had six hit singles in England  \u2014   though it was less popular in the United States. After his 1998 arrest, Mr. Michael released a   album with two new songs one, \u201cOutside,\u201d set its video clip in a men\u2019s restroom. He made a 1999 album of cover songs, \u201cSongs of the Last Century. \u201d In the early 2000s, Mr. Michael released songs protesting the invasion of Iraq, including the 2002 \u201cShoot the Dog. \u201d His last full studio album, \u201cPatience,\u201d was released in 2004, full of introspective ballads. Mr. Michael returned to performing he joined Paul McCartney onstage during the 2005 Live 8 benefit concert. In 2006, he performed a world tour, paired with another collection of hits, \u201cTwenty Five,\u201d which included new duets with Mr. McCartney and Mary J. Blige. He continued to release individual songs sporadically, and in 2014, he released \u201cSymphonica,\u201d a collection of standards and his own songs recorded with an orchestra on a   tour. During that tour, he collapsed with nearly fatal pneumonia and was hospitalized for five weeks he wrote a single, \u201cWhite Light,\u201d about the experience. Mr. Michael had been planning an expanded reissue, due in 2017, of \u201cListen Without Prejudice Vol. 1,\u201d paired with a documentary, \u201cFreedom,\u201d exploring his musical, personal and legal struggles. \u201cI never minded being thought of as a pop star,\u201d Mr. Michael told GQ in 2004. \u201cPeople have always thought I wanted to be seen as a serious musician, but I didn\u2019t, I just wanted people to know that I was absolutely serious about pop music. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563121.9250998}
