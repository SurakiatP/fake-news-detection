[\u201cThe Democratic Party needs to declare a National Emergency,\u201d Moore wrote in a post Wednesday, along with an image of the robot HAL 9000 from the film 2001: A Space Odyssey. \u201cFor the first time in our history, the President of the United States and his staff are under investigation for espionage. This announcement, by the head of the   FBI, is a shock to our democracy. \u201d   The Democratic Party  needs to declare a National Emergency. For the first time in our history, the President of the United States and his staff are under investigation for espionage. This announcement, by the head of the   FBI, is a shock to our democracy. The Democratic leadership in the House and Senate needs to bring a halt to all business being done in the name of this potential felony suspect, Donald J. Trump. No bill he supports, no Supreme Court nominee he has named, can be decided while he is under a criminal investigation. His presidency has no legitimacy until the FBI  \u2014   and an independent investigative committee  \u2014   discovers the truth. Fellow citizens, demand the Democrats cease all business. \u201dThe American people have a right to know if their President is a crook.\u201d  \u2014   Richard Nixon, A post shared by Michael Moore (@michaelfmoore) on Mar 21, 2017 at 11:46pm PDT,  FBI director James Comey said Money that the agency was \u201cinvestigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia\u2019s efforts,\u201d though he acknowledged that the agency had thus far found no evidence to support   \u201ccollusion\u201d between the two. In his Instagram post, the    Where to Invade Next director called on Democrats to impose a \u201chalt to all business\u201d being conducted by Trump, whom he called a \u201cpotential felony suspect. \u201d \u201cNo bill he supports, no Supreme Court nominee he has named, can be decided while he is under a criminal investigation,\u201d Moore wrote. \u201cHis presidency has no legitimacy until the FBI  \u2014   and an independent investigative committee  \u2014   discovers the truth. Fellow citizens, demand the Democrats cease all business. \u201d Moore has been one of Trump\u2019s most outspoken celebrity detractors since the start of his campaign. The filmmaker released a surprise documentary, Michael Moore in TrumpLand, with the aim of persuading voters to vote for Democrat Hillary Clinton with just weeks to go in the 2016 race. In January, Moore vowed to lead a campaign of \u201c100 days of resistance\u201d against Trump\u2019s presidency shortly before the inauguration, the filmmaker hosted a large protest rally outside Trump Tower in Manhattan, alongside other celebrity Trump critics Alec Baldwin, Robert de Niro and Mark Ruffalo. In February, Moore took to Twitter to lament that Trump\u2019s Supreme Court pick, Judge Neil Gorsuch, was \u201cObama\u2019s to make and it was stolen by Republicans. \u201d \u201cSenate Dems, let\u2019s be very clear,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou will filibuster  block this SC nom or we will find a true progressive and primary u in next election. \u201d   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum'"}, "time": 1742628436.0945907}
