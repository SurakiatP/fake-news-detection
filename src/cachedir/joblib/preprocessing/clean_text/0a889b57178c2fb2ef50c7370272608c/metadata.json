There was the women\u2019s march in Washington and around the world two weekends ago. And last weekend there was the March for Life, an annual protest against abortion. The Times called the people who marched in the latter march, \u201c  marchers\u201d in two headlines, to the ire of several readers. On the home page, the link to the briefing of the story read: \u201cPence Addresses March for Abortion Foes. \u201d We went to Phil Corbett, the associate managing editor for standards, for his reply. Last weekend there were also protests in response to President Trump\u2019s executive order to ban refugees. The headline for The Times\u2019s first story initially read: \u201cTrump Bars Syrian Refugees Indefinitely to Keep Terrorists Out. \u201d It was then changed, 30 minutes later, to: \u201cTrump Bars Refugees and Citizens of 7 Muslim Countries. \u201d We asked Peter Blair, a copy desk supervisor, for a reply. The public editor\u2019s take: A clear, straightforward reply from the copy desk. (More on how the machinery of editing works in my Sunday column.) In describing Trump adviser Steve Bannon\u2019s remarkable new role on the National Security Council, The Times used a word that a reader felt was gratuitous. We went back to Corbett on this point. The public editor\u2019s take: I think the standards editor describes well the challenges of finding the right phrases and avoiding the wrong ones. And I think for the most part editors and reporters work hard to do that. In the case of \u201chatch,\u201d though, I think it does carry a negative tone, not just of secrecy but something rather sinister too.  Last October, the public editor\u2019s column addressed The Times\u2019s purchase of a website called The Wirecutter and its sister site The Sweethome, which are in the business of recommending products to customers and making money when customers purchase those products through \u201caffiliate links\u201d like, say, Amazon. com. Through its purchase of these websites, The Times hopes to tap a new source of revenue as print advertising rapidly declines. The column argued that this model could be of value to The Times, but urged the paper to proceed carefully. \u201cI hope The Times will move cautiously, not merely assuming readers will view this as a useful new service but actually asking them whether they do,\u201d it said. \u201cThe Times has a lot to gain. And also to lose. \u201d This week, our office received our first email as the new arrangement began to make itself seen on The Times\u2019s site. We asked Sam Sifton, the food editor, for his response. The public editor\u2019s take: Hopefully, Sifton\u2019s answer helps explain the arrangement to readers and answers concerns about potential conflicts. My earlier post gives my thoughts, but as this is more fully implemented, I will be watching closely, and I welcome comments from readers. Since November, several dozen readers have asked us if there is any way they could contribute extra money to The New York Times, in addition to purchasing a subscription. Friday The Times announced a new program for doing just this: Subscribers, and others who are interested, can now sponsor subscriptions for students in public schools. Those interested can find more information here. Finally, some readers, understandably, are feeling overwhelmed by the amount of news the past few weeks. The Times\u2019s Christopher Mele tried to tackle this growing issue in a story this week. \u201cIf all else fails, and you still feel bouts of news fatigue,\u201d he concluded, \u201cyou can turn to Twitter for photos of cute animals. \u201d That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.'"}, "time": 1742628596.6971214}
