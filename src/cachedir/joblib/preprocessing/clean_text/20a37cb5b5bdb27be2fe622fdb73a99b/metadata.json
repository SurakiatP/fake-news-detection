Alien DNA? People from the Pacific Islands carry DNA from a third, unknown \u201chuman\u201d relative \\nBohlender and his team have been investigating the percentages of extincthominid DNA that modern humans still carry today, and say they\u2019ve found discrepancies in previous analyses that suggest our mingling with Neanderthals and Denisovans isn\u2019t the whole story. \\nIt\u2019s thought that between 100,000 and 60,000 years ago, our early ancestors migrated out of Africa, and first made contact with other hominid species living on the Eurasian landmass. \\nThis contact left a mark on our species that can still be found today, with Europeans and Asians carrying distinct genetic variants of Neanderthal DNA in their own genomes. \\nAnd that\u2019s not all they\u2019ve given us. \\nEarlier this year, researchers investigated certain genetic variants that people of European descent inherited from Neanderthals, and found that they\u2019re associated with several health problems, including a slightly increased risk of depression, heart attack, and a number of skin disorders. \\nAnd a separate study published earlier this month found evidence that modern genital warts \u2013 otherwise known as the human papillomavirus (HPV) \u2013 were sexually transmitted to Homo sapiens after our ancestors slept with Neanderthals and Denisovans once they left Africa. \\nWhile our relationship with Neanderthals has been widely researched, how we interacted with the Denisovans \u2013 the distant cousins of Neanderthals \u2013 is less clear. \\nThe problem is that Neanderthals are well represented in the fossil record, with many remains having been uncovered across Europe and Asia, but all we have of the Denisovans is a lone finger bone and a couple of teeth that were found in a Siberian cave in 2008. \\nUsing a new computer model to figure out the amount of Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA carried by modern humans, Bohlender and his colleague found that Europeans and Chinese people carry a similar amount of Neanderthal DNA: about 2.8 percent. \\nThat result is pretty similar to previous studies have estimated that Europeans and Asians carry, on average, between 1.5 and 4 percent Neanderthal DNA. \\nBut when they got to Denisovan DNA, things were a bit more complicated, particularly when it came to modern populations living in Melanesia \u2013 a region of the South Pacific that includes Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, New Caledonia, West Papua, and the Maluku Islands. \\nAs Hesman Saey explains for Science News : \u201cEuropeans have no hint of Denisovan ancestry, and people in China have a tiny amount \u2013 0.1 percent, according to Bohlender\u2019s calculations. But 2.74 percent of the DNA in people in Papua New Guinea comes from Neanderthals. And Bohlender estimates the amount of Denisovan DNA in Melanesians is about 1.11 percent, not the 3 to 6 percent estimated by other researchers. While investigating the Denisovan discrepancy, Bohlender and colleagues came to the conclusion that a third group of hominids may have bred with the ancestors of Melanesians.\u201d \\n\u201cHuman history is a lot more complicated than we thought it was,\u201d he told her .'"}, "time": 1742562238.7407677}
