[Kelly will headline her own afternoon news program at NBC News as well as a primetime \u201c \u201d Sunday night news show, according to the New York Times. The    anchor will also appear on NBC News panels during coverage of marquee political events.  \u201cWhile I will greatly miss my colleagues at Fox, I am delighted to be joining the NBC News family and taking on a new challenge,\u201d Kelly wrote Tuesday in a post on her Facebook page. \u201cI remain deeply grateful to Fox News, to Rupert, Lachlan and James Murdoch, and especially to all of the FNC viewers, who have taught me so much about what really matters. More to come soon. \u201d In leaving Fox, Kelly will turn down Lachlan and James Murdoch\u2019s reported $20 million per year contract offer, a figure that other networks have said they are unable to match. Kelly\u2019s new salary at NBC News was not disclosed, but she is likely to remain one of the   journalists in television news. In a recent interview with the Washington Post, Kelly hinted at dissatisfaction with her current role at Fox, where she has consistently ranked among TV news\u2019 highest ratings drivers, along with fellow anchor Bill O\u2019Reilly. Kelly told the Post that she wanted a job with more amenable hours to ensure she could spend more time with her children: \u201cMy next deal is all about greater balance,\u201d she told the paper\u2019s Erik Wemple. A source close to the negotiations told the New York Times that NBC News chairman Andrew Lack won what was reportedly a network bidding war for Kelly\u2019s services by asking her what she wanted from a new job instead of simply explaining what his network could offer her. The move to NBC caps a tumultuous year for Kelly at Fox News, the network she joined in 2005. During the first GOP presidential debate, the anchor \u201cbecame the story,\u201d as she put it to the Post, when she challenged    Donald Trump with a question about his past treatment of women, which led to months of headlines and an eventual reconciliation. In her   first memoir, Settle for More, Kelly accused former Fox News chief Roger Ailes of sexually harassing her shortly after she arrived at the network in 2005. In the book, Kelly accused Ailes  \u2014   who resigned from the network over the summer after multiple women, including former anchor Gretchen Carlson, made similar accusations  \u2014   of engaging in a \u201ccat and mouse\u201d game with her and making \u201csexually charged comments\u201d toward her. She also accused Ailes of at least one incident in which he allegedly grabbed her and tried to kiss her on the lips. Ailes has vehemently denied all of the allegations. The anchor has also increasingly butted heads with O\u2019Reilly, the other star at Fox News and host of the   O\u2019Reilly Factor. In November, O\u2019Reilly criticized the anchor for publicizing the sexual harassment allegations against Ailes. \u201cIf somebody is paying you a wage, you owe that person or company allegiance. You don\u2019t like what\u2019s happening in the workplace, go to human resources or leave,\u201d he told CBS This Morning, without mentioning Kelly by name. O\u2019Reilly later backtracked, calling Kelly a \u201cvery smart, talented woman. \u201d Kelly, for her part, said her relationship with O\u2019Reilly had grown more \u201ccompetitive\u201d over the years: \u201cWe are both Irish, we\u2019re both Catholic, and we\u2019re both very competitive. So the dynamic has changed. But I really will always be grateful to Bill,\u201d she told the Hollywood Reporter in November. In December, a source at Fox News told Breitbart News exclusively that staffers inside the network\u2019s headquarters were growing increasingly irate with the media focus on Kelly and her possible career moves. \u201cEverybody in the building is sick of it. We absolutely can\u2019t stand it anymore,\u201d the source said. It was not immediately clear when Kelly\u2019s new position at NBC News would commence. The anchor\u2019s contract with Fox News is set to expire this summer. A representative for Kelly did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
