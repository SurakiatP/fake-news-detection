Bill Clinton rescued?

Nine others who were arrested along with her were freed, thanks to the efforts of the Clintons .\\n\u201cAlong with the Haitian justice system, some observers excused the missionaries\u2019 actions, even though they rose to the level of child trafficking. They did so essentially because we place such little value on the integrity of poor families; the idea that the missionaries were acting to \u2018save\u2019 these children justified the damage they would have caused to the children and their families,\u201d Shani M. King wrote for the Harvard Human Rights Journal. \u201cIn this way, the Silsby case offers a window into international and domestic child placement schemes that disrupt poor families and disregard traditional forms of child placement.\u201d\\nJorge Puello Torres, Silsby\u2019s legal adviser, was later arrested for running an international sex trafficking ring. Torres was accused of luring girls from the Caribbean and Central America into prostitution by offering to make them \u201cmodels.\u201d\\nIn 2011, he was sentenced to three years and one month in federal prison for \u201calien smuggling.\u201d\\nWere 33 children for Bill Clinton and Jeffrey Epstein\\'s \"use\"? Forget corruption, these emails expose connections to child sex trafficking. https://t.co/9CvlndNTDs \\n\u2014 Mike Cernovich ?? (@Cernovich) November 3, 2016 \\n\\n\u201cHillary has a LONG history of interest in Ms. Silsby. Wikileak emails dating back till at least 2001 have been found in her archives discussing Laura\u2019s NGO (EmailID 3776). Laura had claimed she planned to build an orphanage in the Dominican Republic, but authorities in the country said she never submitted an application for this purpose. They instead located to Haiti,\u201d the Redditor wrote.\\nOn Friday, Wikileaks released their 28th installment of the Podesta Files and the speculation online grew even stranger.\\nSearch all Podesta emails for these keywords.

(@JaredWyand) November 3, 2016 \\n\\nTheories and screenshots began to swirl, claiming that bizarrely-worded emails about food were codes for child sex trafficking. It is important to note that this is originated on anonymous message boards, and the \u201ckeywords\u201d were not listed in any of the emails.\\nPlease read this Podesta email.

(@Cernovich) November 3, 2016 \\n\\n\u201cAs a lawyer who has handled many criminal cases, I have strong instincts for when \u2018code\u2019 is being used. Reading these emails gives me the sense that they are speaking code words, like criminals,\u201d Cernovich told We Are Change. \u201cHowever the reports I\u2019ve seen online do not seem credible and I myself have not fully cracked the code.\u201d\\n\"I think it has a map that seems pizza-related.\"\\nThis is code.

(@Cernovich) November 3, 2016 \\n\\nCernovich added that because of the facts that Clinton\u2019s top aide Huma Abedin\u2019s husband is currently under investigation for sexting a minor, and Bill Clinton flew on convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s private jet (which is called \u201cThe Lolita Express\u201d), the whole inner circle deserves scrutiny.\\n\u201cBill Clinton took six trips to Epstein\u2019s island without Secret Service. Weiner was sexting 15 year old girls. Whole inner circle is suspect,\u201d Cernovich said.\\nWhether this is a case of confirmation bias, or something more sinister \u2014 one thing is certain:\\nPeople really do not trust Hillary Clinton \u2014 to the point where thousands of people are actually having serious discussions about whether or not she is involved in a child sex ring. \\nPerhaps the Democrats should consider bringing Bernie Sanders back now.\\nThe post Internet Is On Fire With Speculation That Podesta Emails Contain Code for Child Sex appeared first on We Are Change .\\n'"}, "time": 1742562155.422563}
