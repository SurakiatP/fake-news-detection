A few states over in Oregon, a jury found that the violent militia group which led an armed occupation of a federal wildlife reserve was innocent of all charges and free to go . America is two countries with two different sets of rules, and Thursday evening highlighted that fact in stunning detail. \\nOn Twitter, user @theshrillest put the juxtaposition in all its glory in a single screengrab. His twitter feed was a mixture of stories about the violent suppression of a peaceful protest led by a Native American tribe directly affected by the environmental impact of the oil pipeline and news of the release of the Bundy militia \u2013 a group of out-of-state rabblerousers who believe the federal government should be disbanded. \\n\u2014 \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@theshrillest) October 27, 2016 \\nThis is the second time the Bundy family threatened to kill federal agents and expressed a desire to lead a revolution only to see zero charges stick to them. The group will now get to return to Nevada, just in time for an election in which many conservatives are openly stating that they plan on taking up arms if Trump loses. On November 8th, I'm voting for Trump. \\nOn November 9th, if Trump loses, I'm grabbing my musket. \\nYou in? \\n\u2014 Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 26, 2016 \\nIn short, it\u2019s a scary time to be a democracy. An Oregon jury just gave every white male in the country a not-so-subtle nod that violence against the government will be met with a look the other way when it comes time to a trial. \\nFeatured image via Multnomah County Sheriff\u2019s Office/Getty Images Share this Article!\""}, "time": 1742562806.8674626}
