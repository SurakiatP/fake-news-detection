[A park worker found a man\u2019s body estimated to be about 30 years old, \u201cwearing pants and shoes, but no shirt, floating in Swan Lake\u201d pond near East 59th Street and Fifth Avenue Wednesday morning, NBC New York reported.  CBS New York reports that the man\u2019s body appeared to be floating in the water for about a week or two, and police have identified the body from an ID in the man\u2019s pocket but are waiting to release the man\u2019s identity until it is confirmed. NYPD Chief of Detectives Bob Boyce said the body was submerged in the water for so long due to \u201cwildlife issues\u201d that kept his body from being found sooner and that it sustained \u201csome eye damage from some turtles or other wildlife. \u201d Otherwise, the body had not decomposed very much and did not look like it had sustained trauma. The discovery of the body comes less than 24 hours after another body was found in the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir Tuesday afternoon near Central Park West and 90th Street. The man\u2019s naked body was estimated to be in his 20s or 30s and did not appear to have undergone any trauma. The body was believed to have been in the water for at least a month because it was badly decomposed. Police say that they do not suspect the bodies were connected to any crime, and a medical examiner will perform autopsies to determine the causes of death. Boyce said a body had not been found in Central Park\u2019s waters since 2015.'"}, "time": 1742628510.5496144}
