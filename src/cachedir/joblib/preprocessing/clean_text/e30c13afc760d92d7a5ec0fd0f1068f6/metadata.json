A. drone strikes, has decided that the terror group\u2019s future lies in Syria and has secretly dispatched more than a dozen of its most seasoned veterans there, according to senior American and European intelligence and counterterrorism officials. The movement of the senior Qaeda jihadists reflects Syria\u2019s growing importance to the terrorist organization and most likely foreshadows an escalation of the group\u2019s bloody rivalry with the Islamic State, Western officials say. The operatives have been told to start the process of creating an alternate headquarters in Syria and lay the groundwork for possibly establishing an emirate through Al Qaeda\u2019s Syrian affiliate, the Nusra Front, to compete with the Islamic State, from which Nusra broke in 2013. This would be a significant shift for Al Qaeda and its affiliate, which have resisted creating an emirate, or formal sovereign state, until they deem conditions on the ground are ready. Such an entity could also pose a heightened terrorist threat to the United States and Europe. Qaeda operatives have moved in and out of Syria for years. Ayman   the group\u2019s supreme leader in Pakistan, dispatched senior jihadists to bolster the Nusra Front in 2013. A year later, Mr. Zawahri sent to Syria a shadowy Qaeda cell called Khorasan that American officials say has been plotting attacks against the West. But establishing a more enduring presence in Syria would present the group with an invaluable opportunity, Western analysts said. A   Qaeda state would not only be within closer striking distance of Europe but also benefit from the recruiting and logistical support of fighters from Iraq, Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon. Mr. Zawahri released his first audio statement in several months in early May, and it seemed to clear the way for the Qaeda figures to use the Nusra Front to form an emirate in Syria with his blessing. Some Nusra leaders, however, oppose the timing of such a move, so the affiliate has not yet taken that step. \u201cThe combination of an Al Qaeda emirate and a revitalized Al Qaeda central leadership in northern Syria would represent a confidence boost for the jihadi organization\u2019s global brand,\u201d Charles Lister, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, wrote this month in Foreign Policy. \u201cAl Qaeda would present itself as the smart, methodical and persistent jihadi movement that, in contrast to the Islamic State, had adopted a strategy more aligned with everyday Sunni Muslims,\u201d Mr. Lister wrote. Al Qaeda and the Islamic State have the same ultimate objective to create an Islamic state, but they have used different tactics, Mr. Lister and other scholars said. The Islamic State moved quickly to impose harsh, unilateral control over territory in Iraq and Syria and declare its independence. The Nusra Front has painstakingly sought to build influence over areas it wants to control and with other Syrian rebel groups opposed to the government of President Bashar  . American officials say the Islamic State has largely eclipsed Al Qaeda in the global jihadist hierarchy, with Al Qaeda hemorrhaging members to its more brutal and   rival. Many of the Khorasan operatives, including their leader, Muhsin   have been killed in eight American airstrikes in northwest Syria since September 2014. The Islamic State has between 19, 000 and 25, 000 fighters, roughly divided between Iraq and Syria, American intelligence analysts estimate. The Nusra Front has about 5, 000 to 10, 000 fighters, all in Syria. An emirate would differ from the Islamic State caliphate in the scale of its ambition, in that a Nusra emirate would not claim to be a government for all the world\u2019s Muslims. Some senior American and European intelligence and law enforcement officials say the small but steady movement of important Qaeda operatives and planners to Syria is a desperate dash to a haven situated perilously in the middle of the country\u2019s chaos. These officials say Qaeda operatives in Syria are determined but largely contained. \u201cThere\u2019s always been a steady trickle, and it remains,\u201d said Col. Steve Warren, a military spokesman in Baghdad for the   campaign in Iraq and Syria. Nonetheless, the presence of a senior cadre of experienced Qaeda leaders in Syria  \u2014   some with   American bounties on their heads  \u2014   has raised alarms in Washington as well as in the allied capitals of Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. \u201cWe have destroyed a large part of Al Qaeda,\u201d John O. Brennan, the director of the C. I. A. said this month on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press. \u201d \u201cIt is not completely eliminated, so we have to stay focused on what it can do. \u201d The evolving assessment about Al Qaeda and the Nusra Front in Syria comes from interviews with nearly a dozen American and European intelligence and counterterrorism officials and independent analysts, most of whom have been briefed on confidential information gleaned from spies and electronic eavesdropping. They also analyzed the public statements and social media commentary among Qaeda and Nusra Front members. One of the operatives Western intelligence officials are focused most intently on is Saif   a senior member of Al Qaeda\u2019s ruling body, known as the Shura Council, who oversaw the organization immediately after Osama bin Laden was killed by Navy SEALs in Pakistan in 2011. It is unclear whether Mr. Adl is in Syria, North Africa or somewhere else, American intelligence officials said. The government of Iran released Mr. Adl and four other senior members of Al Qaeda early last year as part of a secret prisoner swap with Al Qaeda\u2019s branch in Yemen, the group holding an Iranian diplomat, Nour Ahmad Nikbakht. Mr. Adl, a former colonel in the Egyptian military who is believed to be in his 50s, is listed on the F. B. I. \u2019s Most Wanted Terrorist list and was indicted in the 1998 United States Embassy bombings in East Africa. He is the subject of a $5 million American bounty. \u201cAs a senior adviser to Al Qaeda\u2019s networks in Syria and proximate environs,   could be especially useful in helping to define strategies that will help the group achieve   successes,\u201d said Michael S. Smith II of Kronos Advisory, a terrorism research and analysis firm. The other four men released by Iran are also suspected of being in Syria. They are Abdul Khayr   an Egyptian who formerly led Al Qaeda\u2019s foreign relations council Abul Qassam, a Jordanian who was a deputy to Abu Musab   the founder of the organization that later became the Islamic State Sari Shibab, a Jordanian operative and Abu Mohamed   an Egyptian who helped orchestrate Al Qaeda\u2019s major attacks before Sept. 11, 2001, according to American officials briefed on details of the transfer. They agreed to discuss the matter on condition of anonymity because of the issue\u2019s confidential nature. It is unclear how and when Al Qaeda might form an emirate in Syria that would hold territory and most likely harden its position toward more moderate Syrian opposition groups. The Nusra Front was created in 2012 as an offshoot of Al Qaeda\u2019s affiliate in Iraq  \u2014   which under the leadership of Abu Bakr   later declared itself the Islamic State  \u2014   to fight Mr. Assad\u2019s government. That same year, the United States designated the Nusra Front as a terrorist organization. But in 2013, the Nusra Front balked at joining Mr. Baghdadi when he announced the creation of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, and instead pledged allegiance to Mr. Zawahri in Pakistan. This ignited an often bloody rivalry between Nusra and Islamic State fighters in Syria. Now Al Qaeda\u2019s top leadership is looking to stanch its losses in Pakistan and score a propaganda coup in Syria by establishing a formal emirate. A portion of Nusra\u2019s leadership, however, supports continuing the group\u2019s more pragmatic strategy of cultivating local support. \u201cThe fundamental disagreement is over how far Al Qaeda\u2019s   strategy should be sustained before revealing more and more of Nusra\u2019s real face and solidifying territorial control through the formation of an emirate,\u201d Mr. Lister said in an interview. Many of the Syrian rebel groups that are fighting alongside Nusra against Mr. Assad\u2019s government reject the idea of forming an emirate, fearing it would further splinter the opposition to Mr. Assad. \u201cFrom Al Qaeda\u2019s religious perspective, the declaration of a state or of an emirate should only happen in a context where it is possible to govern effectively,\u201d said Firas Abi Ali, a senior principal analyst with IHS Country Risk in London. \u201cIt would be ironic for Al Qaeda to declare an emirate while there\u2019s a caliphate that it rejects. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564101.1919627}
