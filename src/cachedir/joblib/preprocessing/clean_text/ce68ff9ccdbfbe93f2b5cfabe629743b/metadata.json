Judge Tanya Walton Pratt, of Federal District Court for Southern Indiana, also held up a state ban on abortions motivated solely by a fetus\u2019s race or sex. In the preliminary injunction, Judge Pratt said limiting the reasons for an abortion was \u201cinconsistent with the notion of a right rooted in privacy concerns and a liberty right to make independent decisions. \u201d While Judge Pratt\u2019s injunction stops the law from taking immediate effect, and though she said the state would be unlikely to prevail at trial, the state can still defend the legislation. In a statement, the Indiana attorney general\u2019s office said state lawyers would consider how to proceed and whether to appeal the injunction. Indiana would have been the first state to have a blanket ban on abortions based solely on race, sex or suspected disabilities, including evidence of Down syndrome. A handful of states have bans on abortion based on sex, one state has a ban based on race, and two have bans based on genetic anomalies, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit abortion rights group that tracks state laws. Judge Pratt\u2019s decision, the first in a federal court to indicate that a ban on abortion because of genetic anomalies would likely be unconstitutional, is the latest setback for   groups. It comes days after a landmark Supreme Court ruling in a Texas case that two other kinds of restrictions  \u2014   requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at local hospitals and imposing stringent   standards on abortion clinics  \u2014   are unconstitutional. The Texas measures would have forced many clinics to shut down. In language that is expected to echo nationally, the Supreme Court held in its Monday ruling that the benefits of any such restrictions must be closely scrutinized and weighed against the burdens on women\u2019s access to abortion. Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a statement that \u201cmomentum from Monday\u2019s landmark decision\u201d was aiding in challenges to abortion restrictions in Indiana and elsewhere. \u201cThese unconstitutional laws punish women, and we will bring them down, law by law and state by state,\u201d Ms. Richards said. \u201cWe have been fighting these restrictions on all fronts for years, organizing in the field, building for this moment  \u2014   and now the wind is at our backs. \u201d Kara Brooks, a spokeswoman for Gov. Mike Pence, said in a statement on Thursday that the governor was \u201cdisappointed\u201d in the ruling and \u201cremains steadfast in his support for the unborn, especially those with disabilities. \u201d Judge Pratt\u2019s decision was also criticized in a statement by Indiana Right to Life, which noted that the jurist had been nominated by President Obama. That group\u2019s chief executive, Mike Fichter, said the ruling \u201cdenied the civil rights of unborn children\u201d and was \u201can appalling human rights injustice. \u201d Thursday\u2019s case in Indiana was argued long before the new Supreme Court decision, and Judge Pratt\u2019s opinion made no reference to it. Her ruling rested largely on the argument that the state, as established in a series of cases starting with Roe v. Wade in 1973, cannot impede a woman\u2019s right to decide to have an abortion until the fetus is viable outside the womb, usually at around 24 weeks. Judge Pratt said \u201cirreparable harm\u201d would have occurred had that part of the law taken effect as scheduled on Friday. \u201cDifficult moral and complicated health decisions are made by women whose pregnancies are affected by a prenatal fetal anomaly,\u201d Judge Pratt wrote in her ruling. \u201cGiven the relatively short time frame in which women may elect to terminate a pregnancy, even a short disruption of a woman\u2019s ability to do so could have significant consequences. \u201d Indiana\u2019s law, signed in March by Mr. Pence, was framed by abortion foes and legislative Republicans as a way to prevent discrimination in abortions, in particular the fetuses with Down syndrome. Mr. Pence, a Republican, said that he signed the law \u201cwith a prayer that God would continue to bless these precious children, mothers and families. \u201d But the local chapters of Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union challenged the measure, claiming the law posed an undue burden to women and restricted freedom of speech, and asking Judge Pratt for the preliminary injunction she issued on Thursday. That injunction also sets aside a portion of the law that imposed new restrictions for disposing of fetal remains. Indiana\u2019s law was exceptional for its breadth, but the restrictions it included were not unprecedented. Such legislation has become more common and has gained traction in many   statehouses. Dawn Johnsen, an Indiana University law professor who has pushed for abortion rights, said Thursday\u2019s injunction was an important step toward invalidating such legislation. \u201cIt\u2019s very strong reaffirmation of the constitutional right as the Supreme Court has interpreted it, but applied to new, creative, harmful restrictions,\u201d Ms. Johnsen said. The Indiana measure had been controversial from the start, and Mr. Pence waited until his deadline before signing it into law. In the weeks that followed, abortion rights supporters rallied outside the Capitol against the law and started an online \u201cPeriods for Pence\u201d campaign that encouraged women to tell the governor about their reproductive health.'"}, "time": 1742563350.7052834}
