The devices were discovered on Monday during a search of the Hellenic Post\u2019s main sorting office, north of Athens, according to a police spokesman, Theodoros Chronopoulos. \u201cThe packages were destined for European countries,\u201d he said, calling them \u201csimilar\u201d to the ones sent to the German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, and to the I. M. F. \u2019s offices. According to reports in the Greek news media, which Mr. Chronopoulos did not confirm, the packages intercepted at the Athens sorting office were addressed to European Union officials and to multinational companies. The targets reportedly included the leader of the eurozone group of finance ministers, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who coordinates meetings on Greek bailout talks, and an unidentified official of the European Central Bank, one of Greece\u2019s three main international creditors. European Union finance ministers meeting on Tuesday in Brussels to discuss issues including tax policy were made aware of the parcel bombs, but they did not interrupt their talks. \u201cCertainly, we are following these developments with concern,\u201d Valdis Dombrovskis, a vice president of the European Commission, said. According to the Greek news reports, the senders listed on the packages were two former Greek finance ministers, Gikas Hardouvelis and Yanis Varoufakis, who led bailout negotiations. It was unclear why their names were chosen, but the authorities say they do not believe either man had anything to do with the matter. The parcel bombs sent to Mr. Sch\u00e4uble and to the I. M. F. \u2019s offices in Paris bore the names of two Greek opposition lawmakers who are broadly perceived in Greece as backing the bold economic changes being pushed by the country\u2019s creditors. The letter bomb sent to the I. M. F. \u2019s offices in Paris exploded on Thursday, slightly injuring the worker who opened it. A day earlier, staff members at the German Finance Ministry in Berlin intercepted a parcel bomb sent to Mr. Sch\u00e4uble. Each device contained small quantities of gunpowder, according to the authorities. A Greek extremist group called Conspiracy of the Cells of Fire claimed responsibility for the parcel addressed to Mr. Sch\u00e4uble but made no reference to the Paris attack or to any other possible targets. In a statement on an anarchist website, the group said it would issue a \u201cproclamation\u201d with more details, fueling speculation about further attacks and a resurgence of domestic terrorism in Greece, where bailout talks have dragged on and political and economic instability are rising. Mr. Chronopoulos said the new parcel bombs \u201cappear\u201d to be the work of the same group. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet but it seems so,\u201d he said. The Conspiracy of the Cells of Fire claimed responsibility for parcel bombs sent in 2010. One was addressed to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and intercepted at her office. Another was sent to Silvio Berlusconi, Italy\u2019s prime minister at the time, and was intercepted at the Bologna airport. (It exploded, but caused no injuries.) A third, meant for France\u2019s president at the time, Nicolas Sarkozy, was stopped in Athens, along with a package addressed to Eurojust, the European Union\u2019s judicial cooperation agency, in the Netherlands. Several more were sent to embassies in Athens. One, addressed to the Mexican Embassy, exploded in the hands of a courier, causing minor injuries.'"}, "time": 1742563973.2429886}
