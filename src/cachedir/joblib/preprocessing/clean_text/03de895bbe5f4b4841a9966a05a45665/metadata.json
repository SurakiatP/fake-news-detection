The fire, which started in the island\u2019s main Moria camp, destroyed 50 prefabricated homes and dozens of tents, driving 4, 400 migrants into nearby fields, according to humanitarian aid workers. Footage aired on Greek television showed the bulk of the camp in flames. About 100 unaccompanied children were the first to be resettled to a hostel Monday night, and about half the families had returned to the Moria camp by midday on Tuesday. The Shipping Ministry said it would send a vessel to anchor at the island, providing temporary accommodation for about 1, 000 of the migrants. \u201cThings are very difficult,\u201d an Interior Ministry official, Nikos Toskas, told Greek radio. \u201cThe Europeans must send real, genuine aid,\u201d he said. He condemned European countries that \u201cbuild fences and then send blankets,\u201d an apparent reference to Balkan states that closed their borders to migrants this year, leaving thousands trapped in Greece. The cause of the blaze remained unclear. Local news media said clashes had broken out between different ethnic groups in the camp amid rumors that large numbers of migrants would be sent back to Turkey. The police detained nine camp residents. Earlier in the day, residents protested, calling for the migrants to leave the island. In the wake of the unrest, Mr. Toskas said, two riot police units would be sent to the island. A spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said frustrations had frequently bubbled over into clashes in camps, as many migrants have been living in poor conditions for months amid uncertainty about their future. \u201cThese people gave up everything to seek a better life months ago, and now they\u2019re stuck,\u201d said Roland Schoenbauer, the agency\u2019s representative in Greece. He said frustrations and tension were being fueled by the slow pace at which the Greek authorities were processing the migrants\u2019 asylum applications, and a sluggish European relocation program that has moved 3, 700 people to other countries from Greece over the past year, far short of the target of 66, 400. If the pace does not pick up, \u201cit will take several years to resolve the problem,\u201d Mr. Schoenbauer said. \u201cThis is not going to go away,\u201d he continued, adding that economic migrants who do not merit asylum should be repatriated \u201cin a humane and dignified way\u201d to free up space at the camps. More than 60, 000 refugees or asylum seekers are in Greece, the vast majority in camps across the country, most of them cramped and dirty. Over 5, 700 are on Lesbos, which has borne the brunt of the migrant influx into Greece. Arrivals from neighboring Turkey have dropped since the peak of the crisis this time last year, when thousands made the short, perilous journey across the Aegean Sea aboard rickety boats, many drowning in the attempt. An agreement in March between the European Union and Turkey to curb human smuggling across the Aegean reduced the arrivals to virtually zero. However, there has been a significant uptick since July, after the failed coup attempt in Turkey. Now scores, sometimes hundreds, are arriving daily. The increase in arrivals and rising tensions in the camps have fueled protests in some communities close to   camps where many residents are fed up with the growing migrant populations. Last week, residents on another Aegean island, Chios, protested. The upheaval has been exploited by members of   groups who have also protested, often clashing with more moderate demonstrators. Mayor Spyros Galinos of Lesbos said the protests were being \u201cguided by certain circles,   circles who are being supported by members of other parties that have found the opportunity to boost their following, and all this is a dangerous climate that can become explosive. \u201d Addressing a United Nations summit meeting in New York on Monday, the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, called on other European Union countries to take in more refugees from Greece and emphasized the risk of giving \u201cspace to nationalistic and xenophobic forces to show their faces. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561754.958903}
