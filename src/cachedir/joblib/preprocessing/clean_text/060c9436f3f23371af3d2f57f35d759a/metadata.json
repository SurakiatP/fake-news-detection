Teneo had raised millions for the Foundation while also working for Bill Clinton\u2019s personal interests when he was a paid adviser to the company. In 2012, Clinton\u2019s position changed to \u201cfriend and unpaid adviser\u201d to Teneo as well as being a client of the company. \\nPrevious Podesta emails have shown that at the time of the memo, Chelsea Clinton was concerned about Band\u2019s conflicts of interests between his work at the Foundation and Teneo. She accused Brand and Teneo co-founder Declan Kelly of profiting off her father and the foundation. \\nShortly after, Band penned the memo to show how Bill Clinton had his own conflicts of interest. \\nThe memo, addressed to lawyers that were working on a review of the foundation, refers to \u201cBill Clinton Inc.\u201d to describe \u201cmore than $50 million for-profit activity we have personally helped to secure for President Clinton to date or the $66 million in future contracts, should he choose to continue with those engagements.\u201d This includes $3 million paid to Bill Clinton for speeches given to clients of the company. \\nBand said his role as \u201cprimary fundraiser for the Foundation for the past 11 years\u201d and his work at Teneo allowed him and Kelly to encourage clients to contribute to the Foundation. \u201cThrough our efforts, we have brought new donors to the Foundation and garnered increased giving from existing donors,\u201d he said. \\nHe says he also obtained \u201cin-kind services for the President and his family \u2013 for personal travel, hospitality, vacation and the like.\u201d \\nThe memo had been discussed in an earlier release by WikiLeaks but no file was attached. In these emails, Band refers to a conflict of interest policy he signed as a board member of the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI). \\nREAD MORE: #Podesta emails: Bill Clinton & Obama worked to influence EU\u2019s Greece austerity deal \\n\u201cTeneo represents 4 cgi sponsors, 3 of which teneo brought to cgi.

Mr. Kelly asked Mr. Kent to give $5 million to the Foundation, which he pledged in early 2010.\u201d \\nCoca Cola has donated between $5-10 million to the Foundation. A set of emails released by DCLeaks this month show the Clinton campaign backed away from her comments on a soda tax in April following angry emails from the company. \\n\u201cReally??? After all we have done,\u201d Coke\u2019s Clyde Tuggle emailed on April 20 to Sarah Latham, Podesta\u2019s current chief of staff and Capr icia Marshall, who has consulted for the Clinton campaign. \u201cI hope this has been falsely reported.
