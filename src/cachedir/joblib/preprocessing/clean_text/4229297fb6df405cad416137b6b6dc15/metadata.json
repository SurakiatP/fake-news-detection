The coup attempt was followed hours later by an equally dramatic public appearance by the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose whereabouts had been unknown for hours after the plotters claimed to have taken control. Flying into Istanbul Ataturk Airport from an undisclosed location early Saturday, Mr. Erdogan signaled that the coup was failing. \u201cA minority within the armed forces has unfortunately been unable to stomach Turkey\u2019s unity,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said after the private television channel NTV showed him greeting supporters. Blaming political enemies, Mr. Erdogan said: \u201cWhat is being perpetrated is a rebellion and a treason. They will pay a heavy price for their treason to Turkey. \u201d Mr. Erdogan suggested that the plotters had tried to assassinate him, referring to a bombing in the Turkish Mediterranean resort town of Marmaris after he left on Friday. \u201cIt would appear that they thought I was there,\u201d he said. Supporters of Mr. Erdogan responded to his call to take to the streets in Istanbul, and by Saturday morning, the coup appeared to be unraveling. The   Anadolu Agency reported that about 200 unarmed soldiers had surrendered to the police in Ankara. CNN Turk showed video of soldiers abandoning tanks in Istanbul, and by morning, civilians were climbing onto the tanks and waving flags, according to images posted on social media. Anadolu said more than 1, 500 members of the armed forces linked to the plot had been detained across Turkey, including a brigadier general in the country\u2019s northeast. Nonetheless, the abrupt turn of events in Turkey left Mr. Erdogan\u2019s grip on power uncertain. The country has been reeling from a wave of deadly extremism by the Islamic State, struggling to accommodate hundreds of thousands of refugees from the war in neighboring Syria and fighting a resurgent Kurdish rebellion in the Turkish southeast. Mr. Erdogan, an Islamist who has dominated politics for more than a decade, has also alienated many Turks with his increasingly autocratic behavior. Turkey\u2019s acting chief of general staff, Gen. Umit Dundar, said on Saturday that 194 people had been killed, and he called 104 of them \u201ccoup plotters. \u201d Of the 90 others killed, 47 were civilians, the general said at a news conference in Ankara, the capital. Seventeen police officers were killed in a military helicopter attack by coup plotters on a police special forces headquarters outside Ankara, Anadolu Agency had reported earlier. CNN Turk reported that 12 civilians had died in an explosion at the Parliament building. Martial law was declared after the coup attempt in the country, which has been convulsed by military takeovers at least three times in the past  . Before he made his televised remarks from the airport, Mr. Erdogan was forced to use his iPhone\u2019s FaceTime app from a secret location to broadcast messages beseeching the public to resist the coup attempt. \u201cThere is no power higher than the power of the people,\u201d he said amid contradictory accounts of who was in control. \u201cLet them do what they will at public squares and airports. \u201d After Mr. Erdogan spoke, many followers obeyed his orders to go into the streets, and mosque loudspeakers urged his supporters to protest the coup attempt. The United States Embassy said in a statement that \u201cshots have been heard in Ankara\u201d and urged Americans to take shelter. Social media outlets worked intermittently or were blocked. The events began unfolding around 10 p. m. Friday as the military moved to stop traffic over two of Istanbul\u2019s bridges, which cross the Bosporus and connect the European and Asian sides of the city. There were reports of gunfire in Taksim Square, in central Istanbul, where   supporters had gathered, but there were no reports of injuries, and it appeared that security forces were acting with restraint. On the Bosporus Bridge, closed earlier in the evening by the military, there were reports of gunfire as protesters approached, and according to NTV, three people were hurt. Some military officials spoke out against a coup, including the commander of the First Army, Gen. Umit Guler, who issued a statement, carried by a   news channel, saying, \u201cThe armed forces do not support this movement comprised of a small group within our ranks. \u201d Leaders of opposition political parties, who have otherwise worked against Mr. Erdogan\u2019s government, also spoke out against a seizure of the government by the military. \u201cThis country has suffered a lot from coups,\u201d Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the leader of the main secular opposition party, the Republican People\u2019s Party, known by its Turkish initials, C. H. P. said in a statement quoted by The Hurriyet Daily News. \u201cIt should be known that the C. H. P. fully depends on the free will of the people as indispensable of our parliamentary democracy. \u201d By 2 a. m. a large group of protesters had gathered at Istanbul Ataturk Airport, and the military had begun withdrawing, according to CNN Turk. In the back streets of Istanbul\u2019s European districts, bars and restaurants were showing footage on television of scenes at the bridge, while partygoers were glued to their mobile phones trying to learn what was happening. \u201cSome people illegally undertook an illegal action outside of the chain of command,\u201d Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said in comments broadcast on NTV. \u201cThe government elected by the people remains in charge. This government will only go when the people say so. \u201d After Mr. Yildirim spoke, factions of the Turkish military issued a statement, according to the news agency DHA, claiming they had taken control of the country. \u201cTurkish armed forces seized the rule of the country completely with the aim of reinstalling the constitutional order, democracy, human rights and freedoms, to make rule of law pervade again, to   the ruined public order,\u201d the statement quoted by DHA said. \u201cAll the international agreements and promises are valid. We hope our good relations with all global countries goes on. \u201d Senior Pentagon officials in Washington said they were still trying to determine what was happening in Turkey. They said the United States had not adjusted its military posture in the region. The Defense Department has roughly 2, 200 uniformed military personnel and civilians in Turkey. About 1, 500 of them are based at Incirlik, an air base in southern Turkey near Syria. The United States has used the base to launch airstrikes against the Islamic State. Since March, Incirlik has been on an \u201celevated force protection level\u201d amid concerns that militants were targeting it. Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter in May ordered all family members of military personnel based at Incirlik to leave the country. Mr. Erdogan placed blame for the coup attempt on followers of Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim cleric who lives in exile in Pennsylvania and who was once an ally before the two had a bitter   in 2013 over a corruption inquiry that targeted Mr. Erdogan and his inner circle. Over many years, followers of Mr. Gulen built up a presence in Turkey\u2019s police and judiciary, and Mr. Erdogan blamed them for the corruption inquiry. Mr. Erdogan and his allies then purged the judiciary and the police of those linked to Mr. Gulen, going so far as to call him the leader of a terrorist organization and seeking, unsuccessfully, to have him extradited from the United States. Mr. Gulen denied any role in the attempted coup, saying he condemned it \u201cin the strongest terms. \u201d \u201cAs someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt,\u201d he said in an emailed statement. \u201cI categorically deny such accusations. \u201d Since the founding of modern Turkey in 1923, the military has staged coups in 1960, 1971 and 1980, and has intervened in 1997. The military had long seen itself as the guardian of the secular system, established by the country\u2019s founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. But in recent years, a series of sensational trials had pushed the military back to its barracks, which analysts said had secured civilian leadership over the military. Across Istanbul on Friday night, rumors swirled and evening plans were upended. In the Arnavutkoy neighborhood, people flooded out of bars and restaurants, hailing taxis and urging loved ones to get home to safety. \u201cThere\u2019s a coup,\u201d one man shouted in the street. \u201cThere\u2019s a coup, and blood will be shed. \u201d Mr. Erdogan attracted a   constituency in the early years of his tenure, including many liberals who supported his plans to overhaul the economy and remove the military from politics. But in recent years, he has alienated many Turks with his increasingly autocratic ways, cracking down on freedom of expression, imposing a significant role for religion in public life and renewing war with Kurdish militants in the southeast. \u201cThe people tried to stand up against President Erdogan, but they couldn\u2019t, they were crushed, so the military had no choice but to take over,\u201d said Cem Yildiz, a taxi driver. Mr. Yildiz said that recent terrorism in the country attributed to Islamic State militants, including an attack on Istanbul Ataturk Airport that killed dozens, was \u201cthe tipping point\u201d for him. He blamed Turkey\u2019s policy on Syria for the terrorist attacks. Early in the civil war there, Turkey supported rebel groups fighting the Syrian government. Many of the fighters who traveled through Turkey to Syria joined the Islamic State, and critics have blamed Mr. Erdogan for enabling its rise. \u201cHe has destroyed this country, and no one will stand up to him but the military,\u201d Mr. Yildiz said. \u201cThere was no choice but this. \u201d Seyda Yilmaz, a teacher who was out in Istanbul on Friday when the news broke, said: \u201cThe country is in chaos, and Erdogan needs to be put in his place, but I\u2019m afraid. I\u2019m very afraid because in the past a lot of innocent blood was shed in these coups. I\u2019m anxious. I don\u2019t know what to say at this point. We are all in shock. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563247.677929}
