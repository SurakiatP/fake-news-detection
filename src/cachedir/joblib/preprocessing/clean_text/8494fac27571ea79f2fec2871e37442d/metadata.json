He was looking into the crowd, his hand over his eyes to block the glare from the stage lights, when Secret Service agents grabbed him and escorted him off the stage. Trump ducked his head as he left the stage. The crowd panicked with frightened looks on their faces, as the Secret Service and police tactical units rushed in to quickly arrest the man. Video on twitter shows the moment that the Secret Service and law enforcement took down the man.

One witness said that they were in the crowd when an unknown guy creeped toward the stage staring at Trump. The witness then proceeded to get the attention of four bigger guys surrounding them and confronted the man. The man then freaked out and reached into his pocket to grab what looked like a gun.\u201d According to the witness the man was mumbling about \u201cthe delegates.\u201d \u201c I was in the crowd, me and my dad saw a guy creeping toward the stage staring at trump. i got the attention of 4 big guys around me and we confronted him and when we did he spurged out and reached into his pocket to grab what looked like a gun. when we tackled him to the ground and between punches he kept saying something about \u201cthe delegates\u201d? he must have the delegates. sorry i\u2019m pretty shaken up right now. \u201c With one person in the crowd shouting \u201che\u2019s got a gun.\u201d The man was then detained by police officers, Secret Service agents and SWAT armed with assault rifles and taken to a side room for questioning.
