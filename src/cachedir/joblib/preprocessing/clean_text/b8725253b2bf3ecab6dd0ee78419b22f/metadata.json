But \u2026 \\nShe does not support the $15 minimum wage. She shows no support for legalizing marijuana. She supports TPP. She has sold fracking and Monsanto. She supports offshore drilling. She has no position on the Dakota Access Pipeline. She opposes the labeling of GMOs. She opposes the breakup of big banks. She takes lobbyists\u2019 money for campaigning. She opposes a binding climate treaty. She supports unconditional military aid to Israel. I\u2019m therefore very happy to endorse Jill Stein for the presidency because she does stand for everything I believe in. \\nIt\u2019s clear a third party is necessary and viable at this time. And this is the first step in accomplishing this end. \\nFear of Donald Trump is not enough for me to support Clinton, with her record of corruption. \\nNow that Trump is self-destructing, I feel even those in swing states have the opportunity to vote their conscience. \\nSusan Sarandon \\nThe actress has been outspoken over her concerns about Clinton\u2019s track record since early on in the primary season. Six months ago, she even publicly asserted that Clinton is \u201cmore dangerous\u201d than the Republican nominee. \\n\u201cI believe in a way she is more dangerous,\u201d Sarandon told The Young Turks. \u201cThey\u2019re both talking to Henry Kissinger apparently late \u2026 She did not learn from Iraq, and she is an interventionist, and she has done horrible things and very callously, I don\u2019t know if she is overcompensating or what her trip is. But that scares me. I think we\u2019ll be in Iran in two seconds. It frightens me.\u201d \\nShe explained that while the media force feeds us fear of Trump to justify a Clinton vote, the former Secretary of State seems to get a pass on her disastrous policies. \\n\u201cThis is what we\u2019re fed,\u201d Sarandon continued. \u201c\u2018He\u2019s so dangerous, he\u2019s so dangerous,\u2019 but seriously I am not worried about a wall being built, he is not going to get rid of every Muslim in this country. Has he made it the norm to be racist and to vent these kind of un-American things? Yes. But seriously, I don\u2019t know what his policy is. I do know what her policies are. I do know who she is taking money from. And I do know that she is not transparent, and I do know that nobody calls her on it,\u201d she said. \\nThe post Susan Sarandon Formally Endorses Jill Stein, Slams Clinton Corruption appeared first on We Are Change .\\n'"}, "time": 1742561959.9126637}
