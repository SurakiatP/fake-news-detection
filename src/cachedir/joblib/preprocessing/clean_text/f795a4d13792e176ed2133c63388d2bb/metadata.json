The missile strikes on a Syrian airfield inflicted only minor damage and are unlikely to change the dynamics of a complex conflict that rages on local, regional and global levels. On the ground, it pits an array of rebel groups against the Syrian president, Bashar  . Supporting the rebels are nations like Saudi Arabia and Turkey, who oppose Mr. Assad and his ally, Iran. The war has also entangled Russia and the United States, and sent shock waves through Europe, which streams of Syrian refugees have fled to. But Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to launch quick strikes raised questions about whether it would give the involved powers pause as they pursue their objectives in a war that seems to have no end in sight. Russia and Iran, who back the Syrian government, have responded angrily to the strikes, while allies who criticized President Barack Obama\u2019s cautious approach have welcomed the change. Some allies renewed their calls for a leadership change in Damascus, although officials in the Trump administration did not portray the strikes as the start of a broader campaign. \u201cA lot of this is an emotional response, but nothing about this strike suggests that the fundamentals of the Syria conflict have shifted,\u201d said Noah Bonsey, a Syria analyst with the International Crisis Group. As president, Mr. Obama sought to differentiate himself from his predecessor, George W. Bush, by limiting direct American involvement in Middle Eastern wars. That angered some allies. Israel, Saudi Arabia and others accused him of overlooking aggressive moves by Iran in order to clinch a deal to limit its nuclear program. And Persian Gulf states and Turkey were irate when he did not enforce his own \u201cred line\u201d on the use of chemical weapons in Syria by using force against Mr. Assad after an attack in 2013 that killed more than 1, 000 people. Now, many who felt that Mr. Obama\u2019s caution gave a green light to Mr. Assad\u2019s brutality are lauding Mr. Trump for his forcible response to this week\u2019s chemical attack in Khan Sheikhoun, a town in northern Syria. \u201cEveryone here in Khan Sheikhoun is happy. It is revenge for the families of the victims,\u201d said Yasser Sarmini, a rebel fighter who was in the town at the time of the strike. \u201cTrump is more frank and earnest than Obama. He promised and fulfilled his promise. \u201d In Turkey, which has long backed Syrian rebels in their effort to topple Mr. Assad, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told a rally that he supported the attack but wanted further action. \u201cI want to say we found this positive as a step taken against the war crimes the Assad regime has committed with chemical and conventional weapons,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said. \u201cIs it enough? I don\u2019t reckon it is enough. \u201d He called for the establishment of \u201csafe zones\u201d inside Syria, an idea considered but ultimately rejected by the Obama administration. Turkey\u2019s foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, went further, calling in a televised speech for a leadership change in Syria. \u201cThis regime should be removed from Syria right away,\u201d he said. \u201cThe best way to do this is to establish the interim government, an interim government without Assad. \u201d In Israel, which has kept its distance from the war raging across its northern border, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the strikes sent a clear message against the spread of chemical weapons. \u201cIsrael fully supports President Trump\u2019s decision and hopes that this message of resolve in the face of the Assad regime\u2019s horrific actions will resonate not only in Damascus, but in Tehran, Pyongyang and elsewhere,\u201d he said. But Mr. Trump\u2019s actions could complicate the pursuit of other American priorities, including defeating the Islamic State. Russian officials, who have denied that the Syrian government has retained any chemical weapons, condemned the American attack and suspended their agreement with the United States over the use of Syrian airspace, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Friday. Russia has argued that the deaths in Khan Sheikhoun on Tuesday occurred when a bomb hit a chemical weapons facility belonging to the rebels. So far, Mr. Trump has not clarified whether Thursday\u2019s strikes were a   response to the chemical attack or the start of more direct American involvement. He had previously spoken of cooperating with Russia against the Islamic State, and his spokesman, Sean Spicer, said just last week that Mr. Assad\u2019s staying in power was \u201ca political reality that we have to accept. \u201d Maha Yahya, the director of the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut, Lebanon, said, \u201cIt\u2019s too early to call this a game changer, because we don\u2019t know what the next step will be  \u2014   or if there will be a next step. \u201d Ms. Yahya said she had learned of the strikes in the company of Syrian dissidents in Washington, where some applauded and others stayed silent. \u201cThere were a lot of mixed emotions,\u201d she added. \u201cThey were worried about what this means, yet at the same time incredibly relieved and happy that someone is finally standing up for them against Assad. \u201d Some analysts said that even if the strike did not represent a major blow to Mr. Assad\u2019s military abilities, it could be a deterrent by signaling new American assertiveness in the conflict. In Iran, the attack, and the swiftness with which it was executed, caught the establishment by surprise. Most in the crowds at Friday Prayer said they had heard of the attack only through social media. State television broadcast the reaction of the Foreign Ministry hours after the strike. Farshad Ghorbanpour, an analyst close to the government of President Hassan Rouhani of Iran, predicted that the country would take the news seriously. \u201cThey will choose not to be confrontational towards the U. S. and the West,\u201d Mr. Ghorbanpour said. \u201cIran will continue to support Bashar   but not at all costs. \u201d The strikes did not appear to have significantly degraded the ability of Mr. Assad and his allies to wage war. A correspondent in Syria for Rossiya 24, the main   Russian satellite news channel, filed video from Al Shayrat airfield. The barrages of Tomahawk cruise missiles destroyed nine airplanes and littered a runway with shrapnel, among other damage, the reporter said. He posted a photograph on Instagram of at least one warplane that he said had not been damaged. Talal Barazi, the governor of Homs Province, which includes the air base, said by telephone on Friday that five people in the military and two civilians had been killed in the strikes. \u201cWhat happened today is biggest evidence that the U. S. and its allies are the biggest supporters of the Daesh terrorist,\u201d he said, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State. While chemical attacks draw the world\u2019s attention, most of the more than 400, 000 people who have died in the Syrian civil war have been killed with conventional weapons whose use has not piqued Mr. Trump\u2019s ire, leaving some observers skeptical that the strikes would change the war\u2019s course. \u201cI feel the ecstasy of revenge now,\u201d said Malek   an antigovernment activist who recently fled to Turkey. \u201cI don\u2019t feel the strike will change anything. Unless Bashar goes, nothing will change. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561771.61194}
