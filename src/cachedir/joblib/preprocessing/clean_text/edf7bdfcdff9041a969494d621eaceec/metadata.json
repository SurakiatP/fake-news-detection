C. \u2014  On Wednesday, following the firing of FBI Director James Comey, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell rejected calls for a special prosecutor or independent commission to investigate the alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during last year\u2019s presidential election. [McConnell chastised Democrats for their hypocrisy and pointed out that they were critical of Comey\u2019s firing after repeatedly knocking his performance while they were trying to get their candidate, Hillary Clinton, elected.  \u201cToday, we\u2019ll no doubt hear calls for a new investigation, which could only serve to impede the current work being done,\u201d McConnell said on the Senate floor. \u201cPartisan calls should not delay the considerable work of Chairman Burr and vice Chairman Warner. Too much is at stake. \u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has been leading the Democratic Party\u2019s calls for a special prosecutor. Speaking of Comey\u2019s handling of the FBI investigation into former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s unauthorized use of a private email server and her mishandling of classified information, MConnell said: It is clear what our Democratic colleagues thought of it, both at that time and consistently thereafter. Last year, the current Democratic leader [Chuck Schumer] said it appeared an appalling act  \u2014   one that, he said, goes against the tradition of prosecutors at every level of government. And the prior Democratic leader, when asked if James Comey should resign given his conduct of the investigation, he replied, \u2018of course, yes.\u2019 McConnell went on to say, \u201cOur Democratic colleagues complaining about the removal of an FBI director whom they themselves repeatedly and sharply criticized. That removal  being done by a man, Rod Rosenstein, whom they repeatedly and effusively praised. \u201d Rosenstein is the acting Deputy Attorney General. McConnell said, \u201cMr. Rosenstein recommended Comey\u2019s removal for many of the very reasons that they consistently complained about. \u201d McConnell noted that Rosenstein was confirmed in a bipartsian vote of 94 to 6. Schumer took the floor after McConnell and repeated many of he same lines he used yesterday: The president fired the Director of the FBI Jim Comey, who was leading an active investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s possible collusion with Russia. The president offered no reasoning for the firing other than he had the recommendation of his attorney general who has already had to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. The question is, why did it happen last night? We know the director was leading an investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians. Serious offense. Were those investigations getting too close to home for the president? Schumer again called for a special prosecutor. \u201cIf there was ever a time when circumstances warranted a special prosecutor, it is right now. \u201d Also on Wednesday, Vice President Mike Pence said President Donald Trump \u201cmade the right decision at the right time\u201d with Tuesday\u2019s announcement that he fired Comey. \u201cThe administration is very confident that with the appointment of a new director of the FBI, [and] because of the president\u2019s strong leadership, we\u2019ll be able to give the nation\u2019s leading law enforcement agency a fresh start,\u201d Pence told a handful of reporters in the nation\u2019s Capitol. \u201cAnd because of the president\u2019s decisive action yesterday to restore confidence and trust of the American people, we have an opportunity for a new beginning at the FBI. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563888.0623682}
