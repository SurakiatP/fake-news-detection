She proposed solutions \u2014 especially the Green New Deal. Progressive ideas, the kind advanced by Bernie Sanders in his call for political revolution, are effectively censored in the debates. \\nMarginalization of alt-parties in the late 20th century is one of the unmentioned reasons for the triumph of the right wing in both major parties. It explains the disappearance of big progressive ideas like FDR\u2019s New Deal and LBJ\u2019s Great Society. \\nThe Green New Deal is a vision of how we can improve the lives of millions of people and rescue the planet from climate chaos. \\nToday\u2019s Democrats give us no such vision. All they\u2019ve offered is modest reforms, ideas that pretended to be progressive but aren\u2019t (e.g., Obamacare, originally Romneycare), and slogans like \u201cChange We Can Believe In.\u201d The vision Hillary Clinton evokes is \u201cI\u2019m not Trump.\u201d \\nThe two-party racket is incapable of dealing with the crises of the 21st century: climate change; creeping corporate oligarchy and economic inequality; the national-security/mass-incarceration state; endless war. \\nThese crises promise an era of deteriorating quality of life, increasing personal debt, eroded rights and freedoms, lawless militarism, and social breakdown. The danger they pose can be compared with the rise of totalitarian states and the Cold War\u2019s nuclear menace during the 20th century.'"}, "time": 1742564345.5480177}
