What are the country\u2019s greatest problems right now? \\nDoug Casey: Domestically, I\u2019d say the continual and accelerating loss of freedom, compounded by the prospect of what I suspect will be the biggest financial/economic crisis of modern times. What might that crisis be like? That\u2019s unpredictable, although the odds are it will be unlike any others that are still fresh in people\u2019s memories, simply because people tend to be most prepared for the things that have most recently scared them. The big problems usually come from an unexpected quarter, and/or at an unexpected time. Like the monetary crisis of 1998, that materialized in Thailand. \\nThat said, the question remains of where to look. It could come from outside American borders, in the form of war. War is perhaps the worst thing that can happen, not only for the destruction it will cause in itself, but because it will immensely exacerbate America\u2019s domestic problems. As Bourne famously said, \u201cWar is the health of the State.\u201d Certainly, the US government is actively provoking other governments in a score of places around the world. The next war could be serious, not just a sports war, like those in Iraq and Afghanistan. \\nNick Giambruno: In 2000, the federal government\u2019s debt was just over $5 trillion. Now, it\u2019s about $20 trillion. It doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s in power. The debt continues to grow exponentially. Unless the government makes radical cuts to welfare and the military\u2014which won\u2019t happen no matter who is elected\u2014it will grow indefinitely. \\nIf Americans are destined to be indebted serfs no matter who\u2019s in power, do the elections even matter? \\nDoug Casey: If the economy goes off of the deep end over the next year\u2014and I think it will\u2014the US government is going to be running much bigger deficits. Spending is going to go up for welfare. Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security\u2014that\u2019s already about two-thirds of the US government\u2019s budget. Military spending is also going up. All that is going to go up, regardless of who wins the election on November 8. \\nWe could easily see a trillion dollar deficit, perhaps much more. Now, where are they going to get all that money? The Chinese aren\u2019t going to lend it to the US anymore. They\u2019re basically going to finance the deficit by selling the debt to the Federal Reserve. And that means creating more currency units out of thin air. \\nBut, on the other hand, the average guy\u2014and for that matter, most businesses\u2014aren\u2019t borrowing money now. They\u2019re too afraid. They don\u2019t want to be in debt. The question is: As this comes to a real climax, are we going to have something resembling a runaway inflation in the dollar? Or are we going to have a massive credit collapse, which could be caused by defaults on bonds, house mortgages, student loans, or auto loans? I\u2019m not sure which is going to happen. I mean, you buy a car now in the US, it costs you what a house did a couple generations ago. It all floats on a sea of debt. I\u2019m just betting on financial chaos. That is the safe bet. \\nNo matter which way this election goes, it\u2019s going to be ugly. \\nBoth candidates, Trump and Clinton, are disastrous. To me, it\u2019s a sign of how degraded the US has become. About a year ago, they gave us a choice between Hillary, the wife of a previous president, pretty much playing the role of Argentina\u2019s Evita, Juan Peron\u2019s brassy wife. And Jeb Bush, the brother of one previous president and the son of another. The US has gone so far downhill that we can only choose which family dynasty we prefer to rule. If only a Kennedy, a Roosevelt, or a Rockefeller could be thrown into the mix as well\u2026 Maybe next time. Although I think we\u2019re due for a general or two. \\nElections are, quite frankly, meaningless. These two corrupt parties, the Republicrats, and the Demopublicans, run by political hacks and funded by interest groups, simply appoint the people that they want and then present the American people with the illusion of a choice. The people who run these parties have become increasingly bold and arrogant. They\u2019re absolutely horrible creatures, the same types that used to thrive in the Soviet Union. Americans should be ashamed of themselves for treating them with any respect at all. \\nHowever, if forced to choose between the two candidates, I would definitely go for Trump, simply because he\u2019s something of an outsider. The media, Hollywood, academia, and the Establishment hate him. And I believe he hates them. If elected, he will likely overturn a lot of apple carts in Washington and break a lot of rice bowls of people who live off the Deep State. That would be an excellent thing. It\u2019s also possible he would retract most of Obama\u2019s Executive Orders, and fire a bunch of supernumeraries. But he might replace them with a bunch of his own. \\nHowever, it\u2019s clear Trump has all kinds of dangerous authoritarian tendencies\u2014don\u2019t forget his endorsement of torture and the killing of families of accused terrorists as a policy. He also has all kinds of really silly and destructive economic notions\u2014he appears to think he can cut \u201cdeals\u201d with foreign governments. That has nothing to do with the concept of free trade. He\u2019s threatened punitive tariffs, something that would immensely aggravate The Greater Depression. Worse, since as a businessman he\u2019s associated with the free market\u2014unfortunately, and incorrectly\u2014capitalism will wind up being blamed for this depression as well as a result. \\nIncidentally, I believe\u2014as I have for over a year\u2014that Trump is going to win. Why? It\u2019s not just the immense enthusiasm of his supporters, as opposed to the lukewarm support that Hillary gets. It\u2019s that Bernie Sanders was the other \u201cprotest\u201d candidate in this election. His numerous and enthusiastic supporters believe\u2014correctly\u2014that Hillary and the Democratic machine stole the nomination from him. They\u2019re genuinely pissed off. I believe only the most oblivious ones will vote for Hillary. A few might be mad enough to want to burn the house down by voting for Trump. \\nI haven\u2019t heard anyone talking about the absence of the Bernie-istas. I don\u2019t keep my finger on the pulse of the hoi polloi . But, if I\u2019m right, it will result in a landslide for Trump. \\nUnfortunately, Trump is no libertarian\u2014but neither is the dim-bulb candidate of the Libertarian Party. That said Trump is a lot better than Hillary\u2014this is no time for a corrupt, hostile, elderly, debilitated, mildly demented Statist to become president. So, sure, I\u2019d prefer Trump. \\nAm I going to vote for him? I don\u2019t believe in being complicit in a criminal act, so I don\u2019t vote. \\nNick Giambruno: Please elaborate\u2026 \\nDoug Casey: There are at least five reasons not to vote: Voting in a political election is unethical. The political process is one of institutionalized coercion and force. If you disapprove of those things, then you shouldn\u2019t participate in them, even indirectly. Voting compromises your privacy. It gets your name in yet another government computer database. Voting, as well as registering, entails hanging around government offices and dealing with petty bureaucrats. Most people can find something more enjoyable or productive to do with their time. Voting encourages politicians. A vote against one candidate\u2014a major, and quite understandable, the reason why most people vote\u2014is always interpreted as a vote for his opponent. And even though you may be voting for the lesser of two evils, the lesser of two evils is still evil. It amounts to giving the candidate a tacit mandate to impose his will on society. Your vote doesn\u2019t count. Politicians like to say it counts because it is to their advantage to get everyone into a busybody mode. But, statistically, one vote in scores of millions makes no more difference than a single grain of sand on a beach. That\u2019s entirely apart from the fact that officials manifestly do what they want, not what you want, once they are in office. \\nNick Giambruno: What about voting for the Libertarian Party? \\nDoug Casey: The Libertarian Party once had a claim to being the party of principle, back in the days when people like John Hospers, Harry Browne, and Ron Paul were their candidates. Then they for some reason put forward the empty suit Bob Barr, an ex-Congressman. \\nIt appears that the Libertarian Party has been captured by the Republicans, which is surprisingly clever on the Republicans\u2019 part. Now they have two parties that are registered in all 50 states. It\u2019s kind of a backup system to the regular Republican Party. They\u2019ll need a backup since the old GOP is a dead duck. \\nRegarding Gary Johnson, I don\u2019t know what his philosophical beliefs, if any, are. I suspect neither, does he. The only thing we really know is that he wants to see pot legalized on a national scale. Well, bravo. I\u2019m all for that, even though I\u2019m not a toker. It\u2019s a step in the right direction toward dismantling the insane War on Some Drugs. But does he have any other libertarian tendencies? He doesn\u2019t seem to even have a grasp of the basic principles\u2026 although he seems better than the average politician. But that\u2019s not saying much. \\nI\u2019m especially concerned about his running mate, William Weld, who\u2019s an actual neocon. He\u2019s an overt statist, an active promoter of warfare, welfare, taxes and regulations. He has no libertarian tendencies at all that I\u2019m aware of. He\u2019s a pure Deep State guy. \\nOne thing you\u2019ve got to say about the Democratic Party is that, while their ideas are destructive and evil, at least they\u2019re honest about them. Democrats make no bones about being the party of socialism, and they naturally attract the envy-driven, the class warriors, the politically correct, the cultural Marxists, the race baiters, the gender Nazis, and the like. The Democratic Party is beyond redemption. It needs to be flushed. It has zero redeeming value. \\nThe Republicans attract a different group. Religious people. Cultural traditionalists. People who generally favor what they think is the free market. They tend to be much more nationalistic and pro-military than the Democrats. But, unlike the Dems, the Reps have no real philosophical foundation. They\u2019re basically just non-Democrats\u2026 \\nThe Democrats can be viewed as the evil party and the Republicans as the stupid party. But they\u2019re really just two sides of the same coin, at least when it comes to their leadership\u2014who are all Deep State members. \\nThe Libertarians must now be viewed, at best, as the smart wing of the stupid party. It\u2019s a sad testimony to the nature of politics\u2026 \\nThe situation has actually gotten out of control, and the government is so big and so powerful at this point that it can\u2019t be reversed. Even if Ron Paul were elected, it wouldn\u2019t do any good. \\nThe first thing that would happen is that he would be sat down with a bunch of generals and heads of Praetorian agencies, like the FBI, the NSA and the CIA, who would inform him\u2014politely, but firmly\u2014how things really work. If he didn\u2019t play by their rules, his life would be at risk. And if for some reason he dodged those bullets, he would be impeached by Congress before he had the chance to actually change anything. And if for some reason that didn\u2019t work, the average American would be out in the street rioting, because his doggy dish was going to be broken. Don\u2019t forget, almost 50% of Americans are net recipients of government benefits. \\nI\u2019m afraid that when the looming crisis blows up, the American people\u2014 Boobus Americanus as H. L. Mencken said\u2014is going to clamor for somebody to kiss it all and make it better. We could very well wind up with some type of a military dictatorship. \\nNick Giambruno: I agree, Doug. I also do not vote. And there are far more powerful ways to vote anyway. \\nYou can vote with your money by swapping fiat currency stored in a fractional reserve banking system (like the US dollar) for physical gold and silver. \\nYou can also vote with your feet by leaving the country. \\nInstead of voting for a politician, which only creates the illusion of making a difference, those two steps can actually make a positive change in your life. \\nWhat\u2019s your take? \\nDoug Casey: I agree. The thing is that all of our ancestors\u2014all of us who are Americans\u2014came from foreign countries. Everybody came to America because they wanted to get away from being turned into slaves in their home countries. The problem is that the US government is going in the same direction as those governments that our ancestors ran away from. Now we have to go someplace else ourselves. We have to find a new America. \\nI\u2019m very pleased that I can watch all this nonsense on a widescreen in a coffee shop in Argentina and not be very adversely affected by it. Argentina, incidentally, is now going the right way from many points of view. \\nIt\u2019s dangerous to stay rooted in one place when the natives get restless. Ask Russians in the 20\u2019s, Germans in the 30\u2019s, any European in the 40\u2019s, Chinese in the 50\u2019s, Cubans in the 60\u2019s, Vietnamese in the 70\u2019s, Rhodesians in the 80\u2019s\u2014or Venezuelans today. And that\u2019s just an incomplete list off the top of my head. It\u2019s especially risky if you have some assets during real economic upset, or ideas that aren\u2019t mainstream when there\u2019s real political turbulence. \\nNick Giambruno: Most Americans are effectively stuck in the US. So, looking at these disturbing socio-political trends, what else could happen? \\nDoug Casey: It\u2019s amazing, and disturbing, that most of the young people in the US support Bernie, an avowed socialist, whose ideas are, if anything, worse than Hillary\u2019s. But it just shows how unhappy young people are with the status quo. Justifiably unhappy. \\nBernie and Trump hit the same nerve\u2014they sensed that we\u2019re on the edge of a revolution in this country. We really are. The situation is not unlike that before the War Between the States, very unstable. \\nBoth sides are extremely antagonistic. People either hate Trump or they hate Hillary. It doesn\u2019t matter who wins; the other side is going to be very, very unhappy. And with tensions already running high in the country, and racial, cultural and social clashes in the background, it almost feels like a civil war is in the cards for the US. \\nOf course, it seemed like we could have had a civil war back in the late 60\u2019s and early 70\u2019s when there were not just a few, but thousands of bombings. Not just little riots, like in Ferguson and Baltimore, but conflagrations like in Watts, DC, and Detroit, where the National Guard was raking the ghetto with .50 cals. \\nBut the country\u2019s prosperity was still increasing in those days. Now we\u2019re on the cusp of The Greater Depression. Things could get ugly. \\nContrary to what most believe, the US hasn\u2019t had a real civil war yet. The unpleasantness of 1861\u201365 was actually a war of secession. A civil war is one where two or more groups are vying for the control of the same government, as in Spain during the 30\u2019s, between the fascists and the communists. \\nBut this time in the US it could turn into a real civil war. I don\u2019t know what form it would take, but a lot of things could be really tough going: economically, financially, politically, socially, militarily. Most important, there\u2019s a cultural divide that\u2019s arisen in the US. \\nI don\u2019t think most people are even aware of what is going on. When you walk outside, the sun is shining. Children are still playing. You can go down to the Wal-Mart and buy cheap goods. Everything looks pretty good on the surface, despite the fact everyone\u2019s credit card is maxed out. But I think it\u2019s all a hologram that\u2019s about to be exposed. So, hold on to your hat.'"}, "time": 1742564060.990363}
