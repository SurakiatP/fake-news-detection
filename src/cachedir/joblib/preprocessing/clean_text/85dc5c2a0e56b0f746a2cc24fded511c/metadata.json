Lee, the leader of Samsung, saying there was not enough evidence that Mr. Lee had bribed President Park   in a scandal that led to her impeachment. A justice on the Central District Court in Seoul, Cho   rejected the prosecutor\u2019s request to issue an arrest warrant, saying said it was \u201cdifficult to recognize the need\u201d to incarcerate Mr. Lee. Mr. Lee, a   scion and vice chairman of Samsung, one of the world\u2019s biggest conglomerates, was immediately released from a detention center outside Seoul, where he had been waiting for the court to decide whether he should be formally arrested. South Koreans have paid keen attention to the fate of Mr. Lee. Some analysts said his case was a test of whether the country\u2019s relatively youthful democracy and judicial system are ready to crack down on the   crimes of   conglomerates. No Samsung leader has ever been jailed, though the company has been investigated many times for corruption. The court\u2019s decision is likely to anger many South Koreans who have held weekend rallies calling for Ms. Park\u2019s ouster and the arrest of business tycoons on corruption charges. The special prosecutor called the court decision \u201cvery regrettable. \u201d But he has yet to announce whether he will offer more evidence in a renewed effort to have Mr. Lee arrested. He can also indict Mr. Lee on bribery or lesser charges without arresting him. \u201cWe will take necessary steps and persist in our investigation without wavering,\u201d said Lee   a spokesman for the special prosecutor, without elaborating. Samsung welcomed the court\u2019s decision. For now, the ruling allows Mr. Lee to continue to lead Samsung. It dealt a blow to the special prosecutor who had tried to build a bribery case against Mr. Lee and Ms. Park. Mr. Lee\u2019s father has twice been convicted of bribery and tax evasion but has never spent a day in prison. Each time, he received a presidential pardon and returned to management. Mr. Lee, 48, was accused of paying $36 million to Ms. Park\u2019s secretive confidante, Choi  . The special prosecutor and Mr. Lee\u2019s lawyers have been arguing over how to characterize the money. In November, state prosecutors indicted Ms. Choi on extortion charges, saying she leveraged her connections with Ms. Park to coerce Samsung and scores of other big businesses to contribute tens of millions of dollars to two foundations Ms. Choi controlled or to companies run by her or her associates. They identified Ms. Park as an accomplice, but they brought no charges against the businesses, which they saw as victims of extortion. But the special prosecutor, Park   who took over the investigation from state prosecutors last month, has called Samsung\u2019s contributions bribes that were exchanged for political favors from Ms. Park. That includes government support for a merger of two Samsung affiliates in 2015, which helped Mr. Lee inherit corporate control from his incapacitated father, the chairman, Lee   according to the prosecutor.   groups accused the prosecutor of overreaching in an attempt to find a   scapegoat to soothe a public infuriated over Ms. Park\u2019s corruption scandal and fed up with decades of collusive ties between the government and the chaebol. Mr. Lee was the most prominent businessman to be ensnared in the special prosecutor\u2019s broadening investigation into the corruption scandal that led to Ms. Park\u2019s impeachment by Parliament last month. Ms. Park\u2019s presidential powers remained suspended, while the Constitutional Court is expected to rule in coming weeks whether she should be reinstated or formally removed from office. \u201cWe have been too lenient toward chaebol corruption,\u201d said Moon   an opposition politician who leads in polls on contenders to replace Ms. Park if she is removed. Speaking to a group of foreign reporters hours before the court\u2019s decision, Mr. Moon said Samsung was typical of a chaebol whose top boss wielded \u201cimperial powers\u201d over his sprawling business group but was \u201dseldom held accountable\u201d for corruption or managerial failures. Ms. Park denies any wrongdoing. Mr. Lee and Samsung have also denied bribery they argued that the \u201cdonations\u201d Samsung paid out to Ms. Choi were coerced, not meant as a quid pro quo for political favors from Ms. Park.'"}, "time": 1742563280.0532615}
