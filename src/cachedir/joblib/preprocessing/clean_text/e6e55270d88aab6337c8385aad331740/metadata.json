[Bloomberg reports that Facebook staff have been given the green light by their employer to participate in protests on May 1st. The company also stated in their internal announcement that they will investigate any contractors on Facebook grounds, such as security workers or shuttle bus drivers, that illegally crack down on their employees\u2019 right to protest.  \u201cAt Facebook, we\u2019re committed to fostering an inclusive workplace where employees feel comfortable expressing their opinions and speaking up,\u201d a spokesman wrote in a statement. \u201cWe support our people in recognizing International Workers\u2019 Day and other efforts to raise awareness for safe and equitable employment conditions. \u201d Derecka Mehrens, the   of Silicon Valley Rising, a union initiative for tech workers, stated, \u201cIt\u2019s important not just to the engineers and   holders that are traditionally thought of as the immigrants in tech but also to folks who are subcontracted but work    on those campuses. Immigrants play a critical role in the tech sector  \u2014   both as engineers and coders but also in keeping tech campuses running smoothly. \u201d Many tech companies in Silicon Valley have been vocal opponents of President Trump since his election. Companies such as Google held protests across their campuses where they attacked President Trump\u2019s temporary immigration halt. CEO Sunar Pichai spoke to the crowd about the difficulties that the company faces attempting to deal with the visa complications many of their foreign employees encountered, thanking all those who appeared at the march. \u201cEvery step, I felt the support of 65, 000 people behind me,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are some values that you should never be compromising on, we need to stand together. The fight will continue. \u201d Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
