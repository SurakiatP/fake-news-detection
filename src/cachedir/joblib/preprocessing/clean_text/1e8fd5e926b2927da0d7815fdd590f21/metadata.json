[Excerpts from Lansing\u2019s forthcoming book, Leading Lady: Sherry Lansing and the Making of a Hollywood Groundbreaker, were revealed Wednesday by its author and The Hollywood Reporter editor Stephen Galloway.  Lansing, who at age 35 became the first female president of 20th Century Fox in 1980, details the   battle behind one of her most memorable productions: Fatal Attraction.  \u201cEveryone passed\u201d on the project, Lansing said. \u201cI begged John Carpenter [Halloween]. And it wasn\u2019t just him. I begged everyone. \u201d Finding a director for the film quickly became a laborious task. Lansing had lined up director Brian De Palma, but he soured on Michael Douglas playing the lead role. Given a choice between De Palma or Douglas, Lansing went with the budding   actor. \u201cIt was one of those    moments,\u201d Lansing said. \u201cDe Palma was the element that got us a green light, but Michael had been on the movie for two years, when everybody else rejected us. We said, \u2018We\u2019re sticking with Michael. \u2019\u201d Flashdance director Adrian Lyne fell in love with the script and signed on to helm the movie, and Anne Archer was tapped to play Douglas\u2019s wife, Beth Gallagher. The only missing piece to the puzzle was a leading lady. Susan Sarandon, Jessica Lange, Michelle Pfeiffer, Kirstie Alley, and Melanie Griffith, among others, had all been considered to play the role of Alex Forrest, the film\u2019s emotionally unstable antagonist. While questions lingered about her \u201csexiness,\u201d actress Glenn Close landed the role. One bombshell Lansing unleashes in her biography is the real reaction test audiences and producers had to the film initially namely, audiences   rejected the film\u2019s initial ending, which showed Close\u2019s character framing Douglas\u2019s character for her murder and being taking away by police. \u201cWe did about six screenings,\u201d Lansing said. \u201cAnd at every single screening, when Anne says, \u2018If you come near my family again, I\u2019ll kill you,\u2019 the audience bursts into applause. [  CEO] Frank Mancuso said, \u2018I think they want Anne Archer to kill Glenn Close.\u2019 And I looked at him speechless because I thought he was crazy. \u201d Late Paramount Pictures studio boss Ned Tanen rejected the original ending. He put it bluntly to the filmmakers: \u201cThey want us to terminate the bitch with extreme prejudice,\u201d he said of Close\u2019s character. \u201cAdrian [Lyne] went nuts,\u201d noted Lansing. \u201cHe felt that changing the ending was kowtowing to the lowest common denominator, and I agreed. Here was this wonderful film about how all your actions have consequences, and now they wanted to change the whole point. I felt it was morally wrong, and if I agreed to do it, I\u2019d be selling out. \u201d Tanen and Paramount even offered to pay the filmmaker an additional $1. 5 million to shoot a new ending. \u201cThat was brilliant,\u201d Lansing recalled. But Close reportedly refused to reshoot the ending scene to show her character being killed by Beth. \u201cShe came into Stanley\u2019s office, and we couldn\u2019t even get through the conversation with her,\u201d said Lansing. The film\u2019s creator and screenwriter James Dearden \u201chad to pretend it was a great idea. \u201d \u201cI had to sit there and tell her what the new ending would be, and tears were running down her cheeks. Glenn said, \u2018You can take me in a straitjacket, but you can\u2019t make me do it. \u2019\u201d \u201cI had a big talk to her about the theater, and how you play the show to    audiences, and then you adjust,\u201d Douglas reportedly told Close. \u201cThe argument was, \u2018It may not be the best for your character, but it\u2019s best for the movie. \u2019\u201d Close finally agreed to film the new ending, but never loved it. The reshoots were riddled with issues. \u201cWe went back to [the Gallaghers\u2019 house] and other people had bought it, so we had to reconstruct it just the way it was,\u201d said Lansing of the house the film was originally shot in. \u201cIt cost a fortune. Glenn had the worst of it, by far. She was dunked in the bath more than 50 times, and her eyes and nose became infected. \u201d The rest, as they say, was history. Fatal Attraction opened on Sept. 18, 1987, debuted at the number one spot at the box office, and went on to earn over $156 million on a $14 million budget.
