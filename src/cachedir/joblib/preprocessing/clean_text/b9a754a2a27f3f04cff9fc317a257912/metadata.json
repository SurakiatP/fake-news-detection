[The Post reported that according to five officials briefed on requests, those to be interviewed include: Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats, National Security Agency head Mike Rogers and Rogers\u2019 now former deputy Richard Ledgett. They said that these three have agreed to interviews with Mueller\u2019s team. Those interviews could happen within days.  The Post also reported that according to \u201cpeople familiar with the matter\u201d the investigation into Trump began shortly after the President fired   Director James Comey. Those \u201cpeople\u201d also told the outlet that investigators are looking for people both inside and outside of government that can attest to the President\u2019s comments on why he fired Comey, the Russia investigations, and others. Comey revealed last week, in a hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee, that he had informed President Trump three times that the president was not under FBI investigation. The now former FBI Director failed to reveal that information publicly while he was still in his position. During that testimony, Comey also revealed that he had leaked a memo containing his notes from a February 14 meeting with Trump. Mueller\u2019s probe is looking into any possible contact between Trump and Russian operatives and for any potentially suspicious financial dealings with those individuals according to the Post. The report adds that the officials say Mueller is interested in a March 22 conversation between Trump, Coats, and CIA Director Mike Pompeo. According to the officials that spoke with the Post, Coats told associates that the president asked about intervening with Comey in regards to the investigation into former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn. The report states \u201cCoats later told lawmakers that he never felt pressured to intervene. \u201d A phone request from the president to each Coats and Rogers a few days later asked for public statements denying coordination between Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and the Russians, the officials told the Post. They added that Coats and Rogers refused to comply. The anonymous officials said that Ledgett\u2019s contact with Trump was uncertain, but that he wrote a memo about the call between Rogers and Trump. This news comes just after news broke that brought Mueller\u2019s investigative team into question. CNN reported that three members of Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation team have donated to Democrats, including Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign for President. The report cites Federal Election Commission records. CNN reported, \u201cMore than half of the more than $56, 000 came from just one lawyer and more than half of it was donated before the 2016 election, but two of the lawyers gave the maximum $2, 700 donation to Hillary Clinton last year. \u201d Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana '"}, "time": 1742561793.5497727}
