[Academics Rebecca Steinfeld, 35, and Charles Keidan, 40, wanted to secure legal recognition of their   relationship by entering into a civil partnership, rejecting marriage as they claim it carries \u201cpatriarchal baggage\u201d. However, they have been prevented from doing so because the Civil Partnership Act 2004 stipulates that only   couples are eligible.  In November the couple, who have a    daughter, challenged a decision by High Court judge Mrs Justice Andrews to dismiss their judicial review action. But on Tuesday their challenge was in turn dismissed by the Court of Appeal, the Telegraph has reported. Addressing Lady Justice Arden, Lord Justice Beatson and Lord Justice Briggs, Karon Monaghan QC advanced the argument that barring the couple from entering into a civil partnership was incompatible with Article 14 of the European Convention, which relates to discrimination, taken with Article 8, which refers to respect for private and family life. \u201cThey wish very much  \u2014   and it is of very considerable importance to them  \u2014   to enter into a legally regulated relationship which does not carry with it patriarchal baggage, which many consider comes with the institution of marriage,\u201d she said. Dan Squires QC, acting on behalf of the Secretary of State for Education, who has responsibility for equalities within Government, told the court that a decision had been taken within Government to see how legislation extending marriage for   couples planned out before offering civil partnerships up to heterosexual couples. The judges agreed with the couple that a potential violation of Article 14, taken with Article 8, had been identified, but Lady Justice Arden dissented on the question of whether the Government\u2019s current \u201cwait and see\u201d policy was justified. Ms Steinfeld said: \u201cWe are pleased that today\u2019s ruling has shown that the Government must act very soon to end this unfair situation. \u201cAll three judges agreed that we\u2019re being treated differently because of our sexual orientation, and that this impacts our private and family life. \u201cAll three rejected the argument that we could \u2018just get married\u2019. All three emphasised that the Government cannot maintain the status quo for much longer  \u2014   they are on borrowed time. \u201d Lady Justice Arden had accepted their case on almost every point, she added, saying: \u201cWe lost on a technicality, that the Government should be allowed a little more time to make a decision. So there\u2019s everything to fight for, and much in the ruling that gives us reason to be positive and keep going. \u201d Mr Keidan said: \u201cThe Court of Appeal has made it clear the status quo cannot continue. The Government should now recognise the benefits of opening civil partnerships to   couples. \u201cThe measure is fair, popular, good for families and children, and long overdue. They have everything to gain. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628451.0089023}
