[In a Monday post on Facebook, Rep.   ( .) issued a statement clarifying the conditions of President Trump\u2019s executive order implementing a hold on allowing migrants from seven   countries to enter the United States. Noting that the \u201cban\u201d  \u2014   which has not stopped many from the seven nations who have cleared extra screening from entering the country  \u2014   was \u201conly temporary until the Trump administration can review and enact the necessary procedures to vet immigrants from these countries,\u201d he added that he was disturbed by the lack of concern for Cuban refugees who suffered similar delays thanks to an Obama administration policy.  \u201cI am struck by the double standard and hypocrisy of those who are offended by this executive order, but who failed to challenge President Obama when he took similar action against Cuban refugees,\u201d Rep.   wrote, noting, \u201cespecially since President Obama\u2019s action was meant to appease the Castro regime and not for national security reasons. \u201d Rep.   concludes by clarifying that the seven nations mentioned in President Trump\u2019s executive order  \u2014   Iran, Iraq, Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, and Libya  \u2014   were part of a list compiled during the Obama years, and not the product of   policy.  The Trump administration chose the nations singled out in the Terrorist Prevention Act of 2015, adding an extra section on Syria given the rapid deterioration of that nation\u2019s control of land in the face of a   Islamic State onslaught and civil war between the forces of dictator Bashar   and largely Sunni Muslim rebel groups. As Rep.   notes, the Obama administration policy toward Cuba did not have a national security rationale. In his last week in office, President Obama repealed a longstanding executive order policy known as \u201cWet   Foot,\u201d which allowed Cubans who reach U. S. territory to remain here legally. The intent of the executive order was to protect Cuban refugees fleeing the political and economic oppression of the Communist Party that has ruled the island nation for over half a century. The execution of the \u201cWet   Foot\u201d repeal occurred hastily, and confused Custom and Border Patrol (CBP) officers into detaining Cubans with legal visas to enter the United States for hours. Among these were many elderly Cubans who had procured legal tourist visas from the U. S. embassy in Havana in order to visit their relatives at home. Elderly Cubans with health problems later told media in Miami that they had been detained and interrogated for hours, often without food, for suspicious behavior like mentioning the 1966 Cuban Adjustment Act. In addition to those stranded at airports with legal visas thanks to Obama\u2019s   policy, thousands of Cubans attempting to reach the United States through Central America and Mexico now have no way to escape the dire conditions in detention centers in nations like Panama. This week, 18 Cuban refugees announced a hunger strike to be allowed to either move north or settle in Panama, neither of which they have been allowed to do. The Mexican government has also ramped up operations to deport Cuban refugees while publicly condemning the Trump administration for considering deportations of Mexicans illegal present in the United States. Rep.   appears to be alone among   members of the House of Representatives in highlighting the relative lack of support for Cuban refugees from the left compared to the outpouring of rage by small leftist groups in American airports this weekend. Rep. Carlos Curbelo ( .) for example, issued a \u201c  \u201d statement, expressing hope that the Trump administration will modify its policies once a more streamlined mechanism for vetting refugees is put in place: One Miami Republican lawmaker, @RepCurbelo, has commented on Trump refugee order https:  .  pic. twitter.   \u2014   Patricia Mazzei (@PatriciaMazzei) January 28, 2017,  Reps. Ileana   ( .) and Albio Sires ( . J.) meanwhile, have vocally opposed parts of the executive order. \u201cI object to the suspension of visas from the seven named countries and of the U. S. Refugee Admissions Program because we could have accomplished our objective of keeping our homeland safe by immediate implementation of more thorough screening procedures,\u201d the Congresswoman wrote in a statement on her website. Rep.   did add a statement similar to Rep. Curbelo\u2019s, noting that the executive order is meant to be temporary. Rep. Sires has taken his objections further, supporting a bill to undo the executive order entirely. I signed onto @RepZoeLofgren SOLVE Act to rescind Pres. Trump\u2019s executive order banning refugees  immigrants from certain Muslim countries,  \u2014   Albio Sires (@RepSires) January 30, 2017,  The fifth   in the House of Representatives, West Virginia Republican Congressman Alex Mooney, has at press time not issued any statements regarding either the repeal of \u201cWet   Foot\u201d or the Trump executive order.'"}, "time": 1742561913.6060078}
