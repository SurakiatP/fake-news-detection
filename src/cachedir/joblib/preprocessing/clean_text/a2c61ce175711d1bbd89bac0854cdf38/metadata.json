Britain would \u201ctake back control\u201d of immigration, reducing the number of arrivals. And it would be able to spend about 350 million pounds, or about $470 million, a week more on health care instead of sending the money to Brussels. Before Thursday\u2019s referendum on the country\u2019s membership in the   bloc, campaigners for British withdrawal, known as Brexit, tossed out promises of a better future while dismissing concerns raised by a host of scholars and experts as \u201cProject Fear. \u201d But that was before they won. With financial markets in turmoil, a big drop in the pound and the prospect of further chaos, some supporters of Brexit are backpedaling on bold pronouncements they made just a few days earlier. \u201cA lot of things were said in advance of this referendum that we might want to think about again,\u201d Liam Fox, a former cabinet minister, told the BBC, including when and how Article 50  \u2014   the formal process for leaving the European Union  \u2014   should be invoked. Perhaps no promise was more audacious  \u2014   and mendacious, critics say  \u2014   than the \u00a3    claim. Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London who was the frontman of the Brexit campaign, toured Britain in a bus emblazoned with the slogan: \u201cWe send the E. U. \u00a3350 million a week, let\u2019s fund our N. H. S. instead,\u201d a reference to the country\u2019s widely revered National Health Service. Hours after proclaiming \u201cindependence day\u201d for Britain, Nigel Farage, the leader of the fiercely   U. K. Independence Party, conceded that the \u00a3350 million figure was a \u201cmistake. \u201d Asked by the BBC on Sunday about the spending pledge, Iain Duncan Smith, a former Conservative Party leader who campaigned for Brexit, said the Leave side had merely promised \u201cto spend the lion\u2019s share of that money\u201d on the health service. The shift was perhaps unsurprising, since the \u00a3350 million \u201cindependence dividend\u201d never stood up to scrutiny. It excluded money returned to Britain through rebates and money that Britain spent to subsidize its farmers and poorer regions, according to the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies. The institute put the true figure at about \u00a3150 million. Supporters of the \u201cRemain\u201d side have angrily attributed the victory for \u201cLeave\u201d to a campaign of misinformation and even deception. In Cornwall, in the southwest corner of England, where a majority voted to leave, the leader of the county council, John Pollard, demanded that the government provide \u201cinvestment equal to that provided by the E. U. program. \u201d (The county has gotten about $1. 3 billion in European Union assistance over the past 15 years, and was counting on about $550 million more by 2020.) A Financial Times chart showing that the Leave vote was strongest in the parts of Britain that are the most economically dependent on the European Union was widely circulated online. Promises to quickly reduce immigration levels are also being played down. Migration was the cornerstone of the Leave campaign, which objected to the European Union\u2019s insistence on the free movement of labor, capital, goods and services. Since 2004, when 10 more countries joined the European Union, large numbers of eastern and southern Europeans have moved to Britain for work. Mr. Johnson argued that it was impossible for the government to reduce immigration while in the European Union. His ally Michael Gove, the justice secretary, said a leave vote would \u201cbring down the numbers\u201d by 2020. Experts have long said that would be very hard to pull off. The European Union has demanded from nonmember states  \u2014   Norway, for example  \u2014   free movement of workers in exchange for access to the bloc\u2019s single market. On Friday, the day after the referendum, Daniel Hannan, a member of the European Parliament and one of the most knowledgeable advocates of Brexit, stunned some viewers of the BBC by saying: \u201cFrankly, if people watching think that they have voted and there is now going to be zero immigration from the E. U. they are going to be disappointed. \u201d Mr. Hannan wrote on Twitter, \u201cI was for more control, not for minimal immigration. \u201d Facing a backlash, he observed that a lot of Remain voters \u201care now raging at me because I *don\u2019t* want to cut immigration sharply,\u201d adding, \u201cThere really is no pleasing some people. \u201d He then announced that he would \u201ctake a month off Twitter. \u201d Mr. Farage took the most   position on immigration, unveiling a poster depicting a long stream of refugees under the headline \u201cBreaking Point\u201d and raising the prospect of Turkey\u2019s joining the European Union (even though any of the 28 member states has veto power over accepting new members). Many Brexit campaigners expected to lose  \u2014   even Mr. Farage said on the night of the referendum that he did not think his side had won  \u2014   and for some the fight was as much about internal Conservative Party politics as the future of the country. Having now ousted Prime Minister David Cameron, they face a political vacuum, with their base demanding that promises be kept. Mr. Johnson, the   to replace Mr. Cameron, has not made any further pronouncements since a subdued statement on Friday that was restricted to generalities. If he does become prime minister, Mr. Johnson will face the task of carrying out a British withdrawal without provoking a backlash from those who believed campaign slogans or sentiments that he certainly appeared to endorse. \u201cIn voting to leave the E. U. it is vital to stress that there is now no need for haste,\u201d Mr. Johnson told reporters. Standing alongside him, Mr. Gove promised, \u201cWe can have democratic consent for an immigration policy that is fairer and more humane. \u201d He did not explain how.'"}, "time": 1742562302.2320588}
