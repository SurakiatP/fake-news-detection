President Donald Trump, and their hope that he will make good on promises to assist them and come down hard on the Islamic State. [Asked \u201cWhat do you think of Donald Trump?\u201d several members of the clergy as well as lay Christians answered that they sensed a positive change after the Obama years, and felt that they were finally being noticed.  Father Immanuel, a Syriac Catholic priest in Mosul, said simply: \u201cI love Trump because he understands this Christian matter in Iraq. \u201d Archbishop Bashar Warda, the Chaldean Catholic bishop of Erbil, said that he was \u201creally encouraged to see that someone at least is thinking of the Christians and giving, not a priority, but at least attracting attention. \u201d \u201cFor me,\u201d the Archbishop said, \u201cI would say this is probably the first time that an American politician like a president would say, \u2018No, there are some people who are dying or are suffering because of their faith and we have to think seriously about that. \u2019\u201d Though in different words, a common thread running through the responses was the belief that Trump actually cares about persecuted Christians in the Middle East and would do something about it. Yohanna Toways, a Christian refugee from Qaraqosh, said that Christian and Yezidi minorities had actually prayed to God for Donald Trump to win the election. \u201cWe have confidence in Trump,\u201d Toways said. \u201cBefore he was elected, all the Christians and the Yezidi are praying [for him] to win, all of them, and now that he is the president we have the hope he will be the savior of these minorities by his strong decisions. I think he can help us. \u201d People also said that Trump offered hope to local Christians, after eight years of a president who did nothing for them. \u201cPeople here were more than disappointed with Obama, because he did nothing. So the view of Obama was terrible,\u201d said John Neill, a volunteer aid worker for the Archdiocese of Erbil. \u201cI think people here are feeling excited about Trump, that he will do something,\u201d Neill continued. \u201cHe stated in his election speech that he would do something about Daesh. That is an indication that he will go further and help the minorities in Iraq to get back their lives. \u201d \u201cIf Trump cannot give them hope, then what hope is there?\u201d he added. Similar sentiments were expressed Father Benedict Kiely, the founder of www. nasarean. org, a Christian aid group that has promoted awareness of Christian persecution in   territory, especially through the spread of the Arabic \u0646 symbol used to mark the homes of Christians. \u201cMany people said in our interviews with them that they had hope because he is a strong man,\u201d he said. \u201cGod bless him. Let\u2019s be strong and help these people. He promised during the election I remember specifically to be the president for the Christians. \u201d \u201cSo let\u2019s put it into action,\u201d he said. Follow Thomas D.
