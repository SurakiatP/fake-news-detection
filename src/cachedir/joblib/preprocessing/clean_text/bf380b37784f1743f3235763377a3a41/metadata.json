I was talking to William D. Hamilton, who was famous for coming up with the theory of \u201ckin selection,\u201d which explains patterns of altruism among close relatives in various species, including ours. This and other seminal ideas had earned Hamilton a place in the pantheon of thinkers who ushered in the modern Darwinian understanding of social behavior. Richard Dawkins, in the preface to his landmark 1976 book,\u201cThe Selfish Gene,\u201d paid tribute to Hamilton and the three other \u201cdominant figures\u201d in social biology whose ideas formed the book\u2019s foundation. I was interviewing Hamilton at the University of Michigan, where he was on sabbatical from Oxford. A video camera was rolling. I had been researching a book about evolutionary psychology, and I was hoping to create a documentary on the subject. The documentary never materialized, and Hamilton died in early 2000. My interview with him sat unwatched until earlier this year, when I tracked down the tape containing it. During the interview, I was trying to steer Hamilton toward philosophical topics, and at one point he went further than I had expected. He said, \u201cI\u2019m also quite open to the view that there is some kind of ultimate good which is of a religious nature  \u2014   that we just have to look beyond what the evolutionary theory tells us and accept promptings of what ultimate good is, coming from some other source. \u201d That\u2019s an unusual thing for a great evolutionary biologist to say, but the most unusual part was still to come. Hamilton continued, in his British accent, \u201cI could enlarge on that in terms of the possible existence of extraterrestrial manipulators who interfere, and so on, but I think this would be getting too far from the general topic of discussion. \u201d Well, maybe, but this sounded at least as interesting as the general topic of discussion. I asked him if he meant that there was some kind of \u201ctranscendental purpose\u201d that we humans are generally oblivious to. He answered: \u201cYes, yes. There\u2019s one theory of the universe that I rather like  \u2014   I accept it in an almost joking spirit  \u2014   and that is that Planet Earth in our solar system is a kind of zoo for extraterrestrial beings who dwell out there somewhere. And this is the best, the most interesting experiment they could set up: to set up the evolution on Planet Earth going in such a way that it would produce these really interesting characters  \u2014   humans who go around doing things  \u2014   and they watch their experiment, interfering hardly at all so that almost everything we do comes out according to the laws of nature. But every now and then they see something which doesn\u2019t look quite right  \u2014   this zoo is going to kill itself off if they let you do this or that. \u201d So, he continued, these extraterrestrials \u201cinsert a finger and just change some little thing. And maybe those are the miracles which the religious people like to so emphasize. \u201d He reiterated: \u201cI put it forward in an almost joking spirit. But I think it\u2019s a kind of hypothesis that\u2019s very, very hard to dismiss. \u201d The headline almost writes itself: \u201c  Scientist Says Miracles Can Happen!\u201d The subhead would add: \u201cExtraterrestrials may play a role. \u201d But that\u2019s the headline you\u2019d write if you were just trying to maximize clicks. If you wanted to capture the philosophical significance of what Hamilton was saying, you\u2019d take another tack. Rather than focus on miracles, you\u2019d focus on the idea of \u201chigher purpose\u201d  \u2014   the idea that there\u2019s some point to life on earth that emanates from something that is in some sense beyond it. And  \u2014   in hopes of generating as many clicks as possible, notwithstanding the philosophical significance  \u2014   you\u2019d put this in listicle form, laying out several misconceptions that Hamilton had implicitly dispelled. You could call these the \u201cThree Great Myths About Evolution and Purpose. \u201d Myth number one: To say that there\u2019s in some sense a \u201chigher purpose\u201d means there are \u201cspooky forces\u201d at work. When I ask scientifically minded people if they think life on earth may have some larger purpose, they typically say no. If I ask them to explain their view, it often turns out that they think that answering yes would mean departing from a scientific worldview  \u2014   embracing the possibility of supernatural beings or, at the very least, of immaterial factors that lie beyond scientific measurement. But Hamilton\u2019s thought experiment shows that this isn\u2019t necessarily so. You may consider aliens spooky, but they\u2019re not a spooky force. And they\u2019re not supernatural beings. They\u2019re just physical beings, like us. Their technology is so advanced that their interventions might seem miraculous to us  \u2014   as various smartphone apps would seem to my      \u2014   but these interventions would in fact comply with the laws of science. More to the point: If you ask how Hamilton\u2019s aliens had initially imparted \u201cpurpose\u201d to life, the answer is that they did so in concrete fashion: by planting simple   material on earth a few billion years ago, confident that it would lead to something that would keep them entertained (keeping them entertained being, in this scenario, life\u2019s purpose). Which leads to: Myth number two: To say that evolution has a purpose is to say that it is driven by something other than natural selection.  The correction of this misconception is in some ways just a corollary of the correction of the first misconception, but it\u2019s worth spelling out: Evolution can have a purpose even if it is a wholly mechanical, material process  \u2014   that is, even if its sole engine is natural selection. After all, clocks have purposes  \u2014   to keep time, a purpose imparted by clockmakers  \u2014   and they\u2019re wholly mechanical. Of course, to suggest that evolution involves the unfolding of some purpose is to suggest that evolution has in some sense been heading somewhere  \u2014   namely, toward the realization of its purpose. Which leads to: Myth number three: Evolution couldn\u2019t have a purpose, because it doesn\u2019t have a direction. The idea that evolution is fundamentally directionless is widespread, in part because one great popularizer of evolution, Stephen Jay Gould, worked hard to leave that impression. As I and others have argued, Gould was at best misleading on this point. And, anyway, even Gould admitted that, yes, on balance evolution tends to create beings of greater and greater complexity. A number of evolutionary biologists would go further and say that evolution was likely, given long enough, to create animals as intelligent as us. In fact, that idea is implicit in Hamilton\u2019s saying the aliens could have \u201cset up\u201d evolution in such a way that \u201cit would produce these really interesting characters  \u2014   humans. \u201d This part of Hamilton\u2019s scenario requires no intervention on the part of the aliens, because he believed that evolution by natural selection has a kind of direction in the sense that it is likely, given long enough, to produce very intelligent forms of life. (When speaking more precisely, as he did in other parts of the interview, Hamilton would say that the human species per se wasn\u2019t in the cards  \u2014   that it wasn\u2019t inevitable that the first intelligent species would look like us.) With these three myths dispelled, you\u2019re left with this philosophically liberating upshot: You can entertain the possibility that evolution has a purpose, a kind of goal (a \u201ctelos,\u201d as philosophers say) without departing from a strictly Darwinian view of evolution  \u2014   without abandoning belief in natural selection as evolution\u2019s only engine, and without surrendering your credentials as a modern, scientifically minded kind of person. In case you\u2019re still feeling a little uneasy about becoming a purpose ponderer, I should emphasize that not all teleological scenarios that pass scientific muster involve space aliens. Indeed, some scientists have suggested that natural selection has a purpose that wasn\u2019t instilled by any kind of intelligent being. This scenario emerges from one version of physicist Lee Smolin\u2019s theory of \u201ccosmological natural selection. \u201d Smolin thinks our universe may itself be a product of a kind of evolution: maybe universes can replicate themselves via black holes, so over time  \u2014   over a lot of time  \u2014   you get universes whose physical laws are more and more conducive to replication. (So that\u2019s why our universe is so good at   making!) In some variants of Smolin\u2019s theory  \u2014   such as those developed by the late cosmologist Edward Harrison and the mathematician Louis Crane  \u2014   intelligent beings can play a role in this replication once their technology reaches a point where they can produce black holes. So through cosmological natural selection you\u2019d get universes whose physical properties were more and more conducive to the evolution of intelligent life. This might explain the   observation that the physical constants of this universe seem \u201c \u201d to permit the emergence of life. Crane, in a recent dialogue on my website meaningoflife. tv, told me that in this scenario \u201chuman life \u2014  and I don\u2019t mean on an individual scale, but as a whole \u2014  has a purpose in the same sense that a chicken\u2019s egg has a purpose. The purpose of a chicken\u2019s egg is to create a chicken. \u201d Crane isn\u2019t using language carelessly here. Some philosophers are comfortable talking about animals having a \u201cpurpose\u201d imbued by natural selection (to spread their genes). So if biological evolution is a product of cosmological natural selection, it has a purpose in a defensible sense of that term \u2014  and we\u2019re part of that purpose. So add another item to our listicle: Myth number four: If evolution has a purpose, the purpose must have been imbued by an intelligent being.  That said, one interesting feature of current discourse is a growing openness among some scientifically minded people to the possibility that our world has a purpose that was imparted by an intelligent being. I\u2019m referring to \u201csimulation\u201d scenarios, which hold that our seemingly tangible world is actually a kind of projection emanating from some sort of   powerful computer and the history of our universe, including evolution on this planet, is the unfolding of a computer algorithm whose author must be pretty bright. You may scoff, but in 2003 the philosopher Nick Bostrom of Oxford University published a paper laying out reasons to think that we are pretty likely to be living in a simulation. And the simulation hypothesis has gained influential supporters. Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of the Hayden Planetarium and America\u2019s de facto astronomer laureate, finds it plausible. The visionary tech entrepreneur Elon Musk says there\u2019s almost no chance that we\u2019re living in \u201cbase reality. \u201d The New Yorker reported earlier this year that \u201ctwo tech billionaires\u201d  \u2014   it didn\u2019t say whether Musk is one of them  \u2014   \u201chave gone so far as to secretly engage scientists to work on breaking us out of the simulation. \u201d I\u2019m guessing that will take awhile, and meanwhile I\u2019d like to note an irony. When an argument for higher purpose is put this way  \u2014   that is, when it doesn\u2019t involve the phrase \u201chigher purpose\u201d and, further, is cast more as a technological scenario than a metaphysical one  \u2014   it is considered intellectually respectable. I don\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t plenty of people who dismiss it. I\u2019m talking about how people dismiss it. The Bostrom paper drew flack, but a lot of it was from people who thought the chances that we\u2019re living in a simulation are way less than 50 percent, not from people who thought the idea was wholly crazy. If you walked up to the same people who gave Bostrom a respectful hearing and told them there is a transcendent God, many would dismiss the idea out of hand. Yet the simulation hypothesis is a God hypothesis: An intelligence of   power created our universe for reasons we can speculate about but can\u2019t entirely fathom. And, assuming this intelligence still exists, it is in some sense outside of our reality  \u2014   beyond the reach of our senses  \u2014   and yet, presumably, it has the power to intervene in our world. Theology has entered \u201csecular\u201d discourse under another name. Personally, I\u2019m fine with that. I think discussion of higher purpose should be respectable even in a scientific age. I don\u2019t mean I buy the simulation scenario in particular, or the space alien scenario, or the cosmological natural selection scenario. But I do think there\u2019s reason to suspect that there\u2019s some point to this exercise we Earthlings are engaged in, some purpose imbued by something  \u2014   and that, even if identifying that something is for now hopeless, there are grounds for speculating about what the point of the exercise is. I won\u2019t elaborate much on this, since I\u2019ve done that elsewhere, arguing that higher purpose can be framed as a hypothesis, and that evidence for or against the hypothesis can be marshaled. But I will say that the evidence I see for purpose includes not just the direction of biological evolution, but the direction of technological evolution and of the broader social and cultural evolution it drives  \u2014   the evolution that has carried us from   bands to the brink of a cohesive global community. And if the purpose involves sustaining this direction  \u2014   becoming a true global community  \u2014   then it would seem to include moral progress. In particular, our purpose would involve transcending the psychology of tribalism that can otherwise divide people along ethnic, national, religious and ideological lines. Which would mean  \u2014   in light of recent political and social developments in the United States and abroad  \u2014   that our work is cut out for us.'"}, "time": 1742628606.5620039}
