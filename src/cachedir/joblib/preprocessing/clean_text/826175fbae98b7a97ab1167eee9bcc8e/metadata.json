The only billboards are propaganda for the dictatorship, with the faces of Fidel or Ra\u00fal Castro, Che Guevara and Camilo Cienfuegos. \\nYou hear on the radio again and again \u201cin 1958,\u201d or \u201csince the Revolution,\u201d followed by news on Venezuela: \u201d \u2026the monopolization of private supermarkets of the right and their allies\u2026the international press\u2026thanks to public policies of the Venezuelan government\u2026famine has declined\u2026\u201d \\nMoney is the key factor determining how a person is treated. If you are a foreigner, things are great, given that apart from having money, the regime forces Cubans to try to \u201cmake a good impression\u201d \u2014 though it is difficult to pretend. The government behaves as if foreigners were royalty and Cubans were commoners. The same happens with Cuban-Americans who fled the island and return to visit, because they come back with purchasing power. \\nCubans work for practically nothing. The average salary for a Cuban is US $20. A nurse earns $40 per month. A teacher earns $20 per month and a doctor earns $60 per month. \\nThere are two markets in Cuba: the Cuban peso market and the dollar market. The dollar market has decent products, while poor quality products are valued in Cuban pesos. With the salary of a Cuban, the possibilities are limited to buying products in pesos, because only foreigners can buy products in dollars. \\nUsually, when one goes to the market looking for a food item, it is not available. Sellers say they might have it tomorrow, but they rarely do. Other times, sellers do not have any money for giving change to the customers, or no packaging like napkins, plates, cups, bags, etc. \\nEach family has its own \u201csales control for food items\u201d book, which indicates the amount of food that families can buy from the government. Often, they are the only things accessible and reasonably priced for a Cuban salary. \\nFruits, vegetables and meat are not part of the Cuban peso system, so not everyone gets to enjoy such things. The sales control book only includes rice, beans, sugar, coffee and pasta. Together, they still aren\u2019t enough to form a healthy diet. Post navigation'"}, "time": 1742628530.8926506}
