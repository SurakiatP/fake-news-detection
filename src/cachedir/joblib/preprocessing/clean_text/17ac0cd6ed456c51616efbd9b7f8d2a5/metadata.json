Fan fiction takes characters from an established book series, TV show, movie franchise or other cultural cornerstone and riffs on them. Some of it is highbrow stuff by highbrow authors  \u2014   what is Tom Stoppard\u2019s \u201cRosencranz and Guildenstern Are Dead\u201d but Shakespeare fanfic? Mostly, though, the authors are amateurs with an overwhelming affection for the characters and a yearning to feel a stronger connection to them. For some, it\u2019s a fun hobby for others, it\u2019s therapeutic  \u2014   they might write under pseudonyms and use their stories to explore issues and problems they are facing. Fan fiction existed before the internet in fanzines and other formats  \u2014   the original \u201cStar Trek\u201d spawned lots of it  \u2014   but giving practitioners the ability to communicate with one another via computer really changed the game. The \u201cBuffy\u201d universe was among the early adopters the show\u2019s stars and writers (and its creator, Joss Whedon) would sometimes visit and post on the online forums that sprang up. The result was a rich, sometimes loopy body of work that included subgenres devoted to specific characters, crossover stories (there are dozens mixing \u201cBuffy\u201d and \u201cBones,\u201d the Fox series that the \u201cBuffy\u201d actor David Boreanaz later starred in) and more. In commemoration of the 20th anniversary, we asked readers to share a piece of their fan fiction, and tell us why they write about \u201cBuffy. \u201d Here are some of their edited responses. BY PHOENIX, 17 Read the full work here. When did you start watching \u201cBuffy\u201d? I started watching \u201cBuffy\u201d last May, which sounds ridiculous, since I\u2019ve become such a big fan since. Why did you start writing fan fiction? My first ever was for \u201cHarry Potter\u201d it was sort of a Voldemort back story. Since I was 13, it was utterly terrible. Now I write fan fiction both out of a desire to expand on fictional worlds and out of a desire to correct fictional worlds, in a sense. For example, I didn\u2019t like some parts of Seasons 6 and 7 of \u201cBuffy,\u201d so I wrote a few pieces where Seasons 6 and 7 went the way I wanted. What prompted you to write this piece? In Season 4 of \u201cBuffy,\u201d Willow, a character who has previously only demonstrated interest in boys, falls in love with a girl. I love that arc, but I wanted to explore whether Willow had been attracted to girls before then. In my mind, the way that this would be demonstrated would be through a high school crush on Buffy. I wanted to write about a young Willow discovering who she was. One of the best things about fan fiction is that, since a lot of writers are LGBT+ it can have really good representation of what it is to be LGBT+ that is hard to find in other places. This is part of my contribution to that. BY DAVID FROOM, 32 Mr. Froom writes about   in Sunnydale, Calif. the fictional setting of \u201cBuffy. \u201d Read the blog here. When did you start watching \u201cBuffy\u201d? I started watching \u201cBuffy\u201d during its fifth season, after years of scoffing at it (I was 15) only to instantly become obsessed. In those Stone Age days, I had to buy   DVDs to catch up on the old seasons, and I gladly burned through entire paychecks from my   job to see everything I\u2019d missed. Why did you start writing fan fiction? The Sunnydale Press is the only fan fiction I\u2019ve ever written. I\u2019d always been intrigued by the idea that Sunnydale successfully covered up supernatural  \u2014   and deadly  \u2014   goings on for decades the idea for the blog was born out of this curiosity. I try to keep with the mood of the show and the late \u201990s, giving great weight to the fears of \u201cthe occult\u201d and \u201cgangs on PCP. \u201d It amuses me to no end that   events would get boiled down to blurbs, while common events might turn into     news. BY TERRI MEEKER, 56 Read the full work here. When did you start watching \u201cBuffy\u201d? I didn\u2019t watch \u201cBuffy\u201d until 2008. We were hit hard in the economic crash and got rid of all the nonessentials, including cable TV. We had to keep the internet on so that my husband could look for work in the   software industry, so we signed up for a free Hulu account. I\u2019d always heard about \u201cBuffy,\u201d but was busy raising my kids and didn\u2019t really watch TV. When I saw a clever YouTube spoof poking at the lack of feminism in \u201cTwilight,\u201d called \u201cBuffy vs Edward,\u201d I was intrigued. At first, I wasn\u2019t thrilled with \u201cBuffy,\u201d but I kept watching. By Season 3, I became obsessed. Why did you start writing fan fiction? I\u2019d finished all the episodes of the show, but I needed more. Fan fiction was a way to do that. As an   teacher, I wanted to see more of Spike\u2019s back story, so I began to write a story in which \u201cBuffy\u201d   to the 1880s. The Victorian era is a fascinating time period, and I knew some of their ideas about sexuality would make for some terrific situations. What prompted you to write this piece? I was very worried about the 2016 election. The \u201cBuffy\u201d community is all about empowering women, and I knew they were equally concerned. Since Buffy\u2019s creator, Joss Whedon, had invested a million dollars into a     effort, I wanted to write a little reminder for fans on Election Day. BY SARAH   47 Ms.   writes fiction that retells   episodes via haiku. She calls them Spaiku. Read the full work here. When did you start watching \u201cBuffy\u201d? In 2008. Having seen the regrettable theatrical version when it was first released, I steered clear of the show for as long as possible. When I read that Susanna Clarke counts the writing team of \u201cBuffy\u201d among her top five favorite writers (along with slackers like, y\u2019know, Dickens) I had to watch. And watch. And rewatch. Buffy\u2019s is a hero\u2019s journey for the ages, and it has been a wonderful show to watch again and again with my daughter as she navigates adolescence. What prompted you to write   narratives? My desire to interact with other people who love \u201cBuffy\u201d eventually led me to a very supportive online community at LiveJournal. I read (and commented on) tons of fan fiction, made fabulous new friends, and wished that I could contribute something as well. Alas, the plotting requirements of long fiction are completely beyond me. I thought, \u201cWell, maybe if I made something very small . .. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628585.5921922}
