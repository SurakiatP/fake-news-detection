[Mr. Livingstone has been giving evidence behind closed doors as he fights to stay a member of the party after his controversial claim that Adolf Hitler supported the creation of a Jewish state. The allegation was made in a radio interview last May when he said the Nazi leader had supported Zionism in the 1930s before he \u201cwent mad and ended up killing six million Jews. \u201d He was suspended immediately thereafter.  Mr. Livingstone also claimed there was a \u201c  campaign by the Israel lobby to smear anybody who criticises Israeli policy as  \u201d. His case is being heard by Labour\u2019s national constitution committee which will decide if he engaged in conduct which was \u201cgrossly detrimental\u201d to the party. Before entering the tribunal on Friday, the veteran   expressed his hope that he would be allowed to remain in the Labour fold. \u201cI\u2019m always hopeful. It\u2019s pretty fair. The injustice was actually suspending me for something I hadn\u2019t said,\u201d Mr. Livingstone said. \u201cHave I said anything that wasn\u2019t true? All the Jewish activists who spoke on my behalf yesterday, all actually confirmed what I said was true. \u201cThe big difference is that, though I said that Hitler supported Zionism, MPs like John Mann were immediately claiming that I said Hitler was a Zionist. \u201cThat was repeated on the Jewish Chronicle website with appalling other stories saying that I said Jews were like Nazis, none of this is true. \u201cSo, as long as the truth prevails, we will be OK. \u201d Afterwards Mr. Livingstone said he had been questioned for four hours. Asked if the case was \u201call about Palestine\u201d he said: \u201cNo it\u2019s about a smear against supporters of Jeremy Corbyn. If the charge is upheld, he could be expelled from the party.
