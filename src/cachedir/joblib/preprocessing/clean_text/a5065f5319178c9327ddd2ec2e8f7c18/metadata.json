Half of the participants were told the nearby neighborhood is mostly black, while the other half was told that the area is mostly white. \\nEven though all participants read the same proposal, they were less likely to report opposition to building the chemical plant when the nearby neighborhood was mostly black. \\n\u201cThey assumed it was an industrial area when it was black, which led them to devalue and subsequently pollute the land there,\u201d Bonam said. \u201cAdditionally, these findings held when participants were told that the neighborhood had middle-class property values; and when accounting both for participants\u2019 perceptions of the neighborhood\u2019s class level, and their negative attitudes toward black people in general.\u201d \\nIn another study, a national sample of more than 200 white U.S. citizens were given pictures of the same middle-class, suburban house. Half of the people were told the house was in a predominately black neighborhood, while the other segment was informed that it was in a mostly white neighborhood. \\nThose who thought the house was in a black neighborhood estimated its value at $20,000 less than the other group, and were less likely to say they would live in or buy the house. \\n{snip}'"}, "time": 1742561958.182816}
