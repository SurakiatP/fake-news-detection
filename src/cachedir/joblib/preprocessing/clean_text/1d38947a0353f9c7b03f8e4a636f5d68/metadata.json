Defending and protecting the Velayat [the Supreme Leader] has no border and limit.\u201d Salar Abnoush, deputy coordinator of Iran\u2019s Khatam-al-Anbia Garrison stated.\\nAbnoush\u2019s provocative comments come at a time where Iran is actively upgrading their military hardware and attempting to strengthen their presence throughout the Middle East with funds provided by the Obama Administration.\\nVia Washington Free Beacon \\n\u201cThe whole world should know that the IRGC will be in the U.S. and Europe very soon,\u201d Salar Abnoush, deputy coordinator of Iran\u2019s Khatam-al-Anbia Garrison, an IRGC command front, was quoted as saying in an Iranian state-controlled publication closely tied to the IRGC.\\nIranian military and government officials have continued to advocate violence against the U.S. and its allies, despite the nuclear deal and several secret side agreements that gave Iran $1.7 billion in cash.\\nIran accuses the U.S. of violating its end of the agreement by not helping the Islamic Republic gain further access to international banks and other markets.\\n\u201cOur enemies have several projects to destroy our Islamic revolution, and have waged three wars against us to execute their plans against our Islamic Republic,\u201d Abnoush said. \u201cThe IRGC has defeated enemies in several fronts. The enemy surrendered and accepted to negotiate with us.\u201d\\n\u201cAnd now all of our problems are being solved and our country is becoming stronger in all fronts. Some believe the holy defense ended,\u201d the military leader added. \u201cThey are wrong; the holy defense continues, and today, it is more complicated than before.\u201d\\nAnother source who advises congressional leaders on Iran sanctions issues told the Free Beacon that the Obama administration is blocking Congress from taking action to stop this type of infiltration by Iranian forces.\\n\u201cIran is ideologically, politically, and militarily committed to exporting the Islamic revolution through terrorism, which is why even the Obama administration says they\u2019re the world\u2019s foremost state sponsor of terrorism,\u201d the source said. \u201cCongress wants to act, but Obama officials keep saying that new laws are unnecessary because the U.S. has enough tools to block Iranian terror expansion. Instead of using those tools, though, they\u2019re sending Iran billions of dollars in cash while Iran plants terror cells in Europe and here at home.\u201d\\n'"}, "time": 1742561674.416972}
