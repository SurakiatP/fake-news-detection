However, as soon as they pulled up to his stop, the migrant thug attacked the elderly man, beating him to a bloody pulp and punching a hole in his eye after he made one simple request. \\nAn elderly Swede saw just how far tolerance and open-mindedness reaches with other cultures after giving a 27-year-old Colombian migrant a ride from Gnosj\u00f6 to Gislaved. Graciously obliging the Hispanic migrant, the old man and his wife took him 20 minutes away to the local train station. Unfortunately, the pensioner made a nearly fatal mistake when they arrived at their destination. \\nAccording to Fria Tider , the 87-year-old unnamed man pulled up to the station and politely told the migrant that they had arrived at his destination. Simply informing the foreigner that it was time to exit the vehicle apparently sent him into a rage, causing him to brutally beat the driver almost to death. \\nRepeatedly punching him in the torso and head at least a dozen times, the migrant beat the old man so badly that he broke his rib and punched a hole in his right eye, damage that was so extensive that doctors worried he would go completely blind even after 3 weeks in the hospital. \\n\u201cHe can no longer read newspapers or see on television,\u201d according to the court report. \u201cIt is unclear if he will ever see again. Before the beating, he was alert and active in the community. Now, he needs the help of four times a day.\u201d \\nWhen police arrested the migrant, whose identity is protected by the liberal Swedish government, he told authorities that his victim had sparked the beating by calling him \u201clittle\u201d and a \u201cnegro.\u201d It wasn\u2019t long before the thug admitted that he lied about the accusations and simply beat the sweet old man because he knew he\u2019d get away with it. \\nThe convict laughed during his interrogation, telling police that he was amused that a man just over 5 feet tall could take down a feeble, elderly man a foot taller. \u201cIt is what it is,\u201d the migrant heckled. \u201cA man of 6 feet getting knocked out \u2014 me leveling a man of 6-feet is really laughable. I cut him down like a tree,\u201d he added, telling police that it doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s convicted because \u201cI\u2019ll be on the loose. I will come out soon again. You can\u2019t lock me up for very long,\u201d according to Expressen . Left-leaning Swedish authorities protect the identity of the migrant thug, forcing the media to censor his face and the Colombian flag patch on his jacket. \\nSickeningly enough, the migrant thug was right. Thanks to the politically correct justice system, he received just over 2 years in prison for aggravated assault, a sentence that will likely either be appealed, overturned, or reduced with good behavior. In fact, his appeal is currently being heard by a higher court, which is considering reducing his sentence based because he was located on social media and forced to go into hiding because of his brutal crime. \\nUnfortunately, this type of racially-motivated violence is nothing new to Europe. Just over a week ago, Mad World News reported that a group of 5 white men, 3 U.S. citizens and 2 Danes, were approached by 8 to 10 Muslim migrants who asked if they were Americans. When the 3 admitted that they are, the asylum seekers attacked all 5 of them, brutally beating and threatening to kill them with a knife. \\nThe victims received no help from the Danish government and have been ignored by local authorities. Even the central investigating police headquarters refused to take the case. \\nAs the elderly Swedish man discovered, it doesn\u2019t matter if you extend tolerance and respect, many of these migrants see Westerners as inferior humans who must be forced to submit. This is exactly what a bleeding-heart liberal found out after volunteering at the Calais \u201cJungle\u201d camp. \\nLast week, Mad World News reported that a 38-year-old female interpreter was helping a male journalist make a documentary about the plight of migrants when a group of 3 Afghan asylum seekers attacked them at knifepoint. One of the migrants raped her while the others restrained the journalist and stole his equipment. \\nThose who despise our culture, values, and laws won\u2019t have a change of heart when we show them just how progressive and open-minded our society is. They know this, and it\u2019s the very reason they hate us. In fact, they see our kindness as an opportunity to impose their oppressive and violent values on us without fear of being opposed. After all, we wouldn\u2019t want to be considered racist, would we?'"}, "time": 1742564322.3370485}
