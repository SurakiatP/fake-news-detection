While most undoubtedly dismissed these reports as conspiracy theories, new official reports from Chambers County, Texas suggest that there might be some truth to the voting machine \"irregularities\". According to an NBC affiliate , polling stations in Chambers County had to enact emergency protocols yesterday and revert back to paper ballots after a \"glitch\" was discovered in the county\\'s voting machines. \\nThe issue was actually discovered on Monday morning when Chambers County Clerk Heather Hawthorne was casting her own ballot and the voter next to her noticed that one of her votes was not filled in when she reviewed her electronic ballot Hawthorne told 12News on Tuesday. \\n\\nAn error in the voting machine programming by Election Systems & Software (ES&S) caused votes for one statewide court of appeals race not to be entered when a voter tried to vote straight ticket in either party according to a release from Chambers County. \\n\\nES&S is the vendor that Chambers County contracts with to program their voting machines. \\n\\nThe Texas Secretary of State\\'s office informed Hawthorne to create emergency paper ballots to continue voting until the problem could be fixed according to the release. \\nBelow is the official press release from the Chambers County Clerk: \\n\\nOf course, these confirmed reports from Chambers County seem eerily similar to problems reported yesterday on social media from people who also experienced problems when voting a \"straight republican ticket.\" \\n\\nThe following report also surfaced in Arlington, Texas from a person who voted a straight republican ticket only to find just before submitting her ballot that her presidential choice had been switched to Clinton/Kaine . After reporting the error to polling officials, the voter was told that these errors \"had been happening.\" \\n\\nThis Reddit user also noted multiple reports of voting errors across the state of Texas. \\n\\nOf course, the real question is how many people submitted erroneous ballots before this \"glitch\" was caught and how many other \"software glitches\" exist in other counties around the country that will never be caught?'"}, "time": 1742628314.2597208}
