After dropping everything for \u201cher girl\u201d Hillary and running to North Carolina to speak on her behalf, Michelle ran her mouth about Donald Trump, but it immediately came back to bite her. \\nWhile Trump is capable of doing his own talking and campaigning, Hillary needs a lot of help to make it through this election season, and she\u2019s getting it from a number of Democrats, namely, the Obamas. Both Michelle and Barack Obama have campaigned for the ailing criminal candidate numerous times, including at her North Carlina stop on Thursday where Michelle acted as Hillary\u2019s sorority sister more than her campaign supporter, after completely bashing Trump. \\nAccording to the Daily Mail , the two \u201cFirst Ladies\u201d acted as if the campaign stop was a teenage popularity contest as they stood on stage like a couple of best friends, who are actually enemies. Only able to discuss what makes Hillary so great by trash-talking Hillary\u2019s opponent, Michelle said, \u201cWe want a president who takes this job seriously and has the temperament and maturity to do it well. Someone who is steady. Someone who we can trust with the nuclear codes.\u201d \\nApparently, Michelle wasn\u2019t paying attention to the presidential debates when her gal pal committed treason by spilling what America\u2019s nuclear response time is. Seemingly forgetting who she was talking about and all that this woman is accused of, sanctimonious Michelle rambled on about what an awesome example Hillary is for our children as if we\u2019re supposed to take parenting advice from a mother who raises her daughters around foul-mouthed rappers. \\n\u201cWe know the influence our president has on our children,\u201d she later added. \u201cThey turn on the TV and they see the most powerful role model in the world \u2013 someone who shows them how to treat others. How to deal with disappointment. Whether to tell the truth. They\u2019re taking it all in.\u201d In making this statement, she didn\u2019t realize she was actually speaking against Hillary, who is the opposite of the honest role model she described. The label is more fitting for Trump. \\nShe closed her speech with a declaration of desperation, pleading with the crowd that if nothing else, choose Hillary because as \u201cFirst ladies, we rock.\u201d Then, she begged anyone who would listen to keep \u201cworking your hearts out for my girl.\u201d This little cheerleading act is very convenient, but it backfired on Michelle when the past came back to haunt her. Hillary isn\u2019t \u201cher girl.\u201d In fact, they\u2019re \u201cfrenemies\u201d at best since she was previously recorded talking behind Hillary\u2019s back, saying, \u201cIf you can\u2019t run your own house, you can\u2019t run the White House,\u201d in reference to Bill Clinton\u2019s extra-marital affairs. \\nLike \u201cher girl,\u201d Michelle proved herself as a hypocrite in her statements and got a huge dose of karma the next day for supporting Hillary when the FBI announced they are re-opening the investigation into the Democratic candidate\u2019s e-mails. Neither one of these two women or their husbands are \u201cpowerful role models\u201d who \u201ctell the truth,\u201d and they certainly aren\u2019t people any child should be looking up to.'"}, "time": 1742563964.3924193}
