On the one hand Hillary Clinton seems ready to adopt a much more aggressive stance with Russia, which could well escalate into open military conflict between the two powers. While on the other hand Donald Trump has pledged to scrap the nuclear accord reached with Tehran and to stand up to Israel\u2019s enemies, \u201clike Iran\u201d. In other words Trump seems ready to adopt the same belligerent stance over Iran as the Bush administration. Such a policy could easily escalate into military conflict and given Tehran\u2019s growing ties to Moscow that could also lead to military conflict with Russia too. So the choice faced by American voters boils down to six of one, or half-a-dozen of the other. Both candidates have outlined foreign policies that could inevitably lead to war with Russia. It\u2019s just that Clinton has chosen a more direct path while Trump has opted for a more roundabout route. Either way American voters seem to have little REAL choice in the matter. Ed. Trump to Israelis: together we\u2019ll stand up to Iran The Jewish Press.com \u2014 Oct 27, 2016 \\nA taped one-minute address by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, screened at an election rally organized by Republicans Overseas Israel in Jerusalem Wednesday, left no room for doubt: should he be elected, Trump would be the biggest friend Israel has ever had \u2014 huge. \\n\u201cMy administration will stand side by side with the Jewish people and Israel\u2019s leaders to continue strengthening the bridges that connect not only Jewish Americans and Israelis but also all Americans and Israelis,\u201d Trump told the 200 or so in attendance at the event and the few dozens watching the rally live on Facebook. \u201cTogether, we will stand up to enemies like Iran bent on destroying Israel and her people. Together, we will make America and Israel safe again.\u201d \\nIt was a small crowd, admittedly, but the folks, many in Trump T-shirts and \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d baseball caps, made up for their number with enthusiasm, booing and crying \u201cLock her up\u201d each time the name Hillary Clinton was mentioned. \\n\u201cI love Israel and honor and respect the Jewish faith and tradition,\u201d Trump told his Israeli-American voters. \u201cFor me, respect and reverence for Judaism is personal. My daughter Ivanka and my son-in-law Jared are raising their children in the Jewish faith.\u201d \\nTrump\u2019s VP, Gov. Mike Pence, told the Jerusalem rally: \u201cIsrael\u2019s fight is our fight, Israel\u2019s cause is our cause,\u201d noting that Israel is \u201cnot just our strongest ally in the Middle East, it is our most cherished ally in the world.\u201d Also, Pence said, Israel is \u201chated by too many progressives, because she is successful and her people are free,\u201d and so, \u201cLet the word go forth that Donald Trump and I are proud to stand with Israel.\u201d \\nLocal speakers included Caroline Glick, Trump\u2019s adviser on Israel David Friedman, and David Peyman, Trump\u2019s head of Jewish outreach, who told the gathering that he had delivered a note from Trump to God at the Kotel. Friedman promised that \u201ca Trump administration will never pressure Israel into a two-state solution or any other solution that is against the will of the Israeli people.\u201d Friedman warned against the seductive messages Trump\u2019s opponent had given the AIPAC conference in March, saying \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s words are the cheapest currency on the political marker.\u201d \\nAccording to media reports over the summer, Friedman and Trump\u2019s other adviser on Israel, Jason Greenblatt, suggested the candidate stop elaborating on his vision of two states for two peoples living peacefully side by side. This after Trump had told Maggie Haberman and David E. Sanger of the NY Times in March: \u201cBasically I support a two-state solution on Israel. But the Palestinian Authority has to recognize Israel\u2019s right to exist as a Jewish state. Have to do that. And they have to stop the terror, stop the attacks, stop the teaching of hatred, you know? The children, I sort of talked about it pretty much in the speech, but the children are aspiring to grow up to be terrorists. They are taught to grow up to be terrorists. And they have to stop. They have to stop the terror. They have to stop the stabbings and all of the things going on. And they have to recognize that Israel\u2019s right to exist as a Jewish state. \u2026 And if they can\u2019t, you\u2019re never going to make a deal. One state, two states, it doesn\u2019t matter: you\u2019re never going to be able to make a deal.\u201d \\nTrump concluded: \u201cNow whether or not the Palestinians can live with that? You would think they could. It shouldn\u2019t be hard except that the ingrained hatred is tremendous.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742562516.4353113}
