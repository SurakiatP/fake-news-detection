His letter was also sent to the CEO of the American Water Works Association, David LaFrance. \\n\u201cWhat\u2019s clear to me is that we need a repeal of Georgia\u2019s water fluoridation law, and hearings to look into how fluoridation has continued all these years, long after there were plenty of reasons to end it,\u201d Ambassador Young wrote. \\n\u201cThis is a civil rights issue, and the people have the right to have the full story given to them, rather than highly edited, misleading talking points.\u201d \\nYoung also addressed the sketchy nature of the pro-fluoridation argument when he wrote, When someone\u2019s story keeps changing, there are quite often motivations behind their changed stance that may not be aligned with the best interests of the public. The story offered by water fluoridation promoters keeps changing\u2026and changing\u2026and changing. There are key groups such as seniors, kidney patients, diabetics, communities of color, thyroid patients and people who drink a lot of water due to their occupation that are especially effected by Fluoridegate. \\n\u201cI am calling for Fluoridegate hearings, here, in Georgia and I am calling for a repeal of Georgia\u2019s fluoridation law, immediately,\u201d Young added. \\nYou can read the full text of Young\u2019s letter here . We congratulate Ambassador Young on having the courage to speak out on this issue and we eagerly await the written response to it. Even more important, we are looking for an end to water fluoridation in Georgia.'"}, "time": 1742564601.2498758}
