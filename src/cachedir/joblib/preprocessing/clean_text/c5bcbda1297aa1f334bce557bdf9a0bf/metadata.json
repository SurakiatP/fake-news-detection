Obama figured he was untouchable, but Trump just pulled out the big guns and Obama is absolutely horrified!! \\nTrump told his rally in Florida today that\u2026 Obama was aware that Hillary Clinton and the Democrats were hiring people to beat up Trump supporters at his rallies! \\n\\nDonald Trump actually made a great point. The guy behind the violent attacks was a Democrat named Bob Creamer. Creamer, a convicted felon, admitted on tape to hiring the attackers for Hillary! \\nHowever, when more digging was done, it was discovered that Creamer visited the White House over 300 times since Obama became president. \\nTrump said, \u2018He visited the White House, I think it was 344 times, right? But he said, \u201cYeah, but I only saw that president 44 times.\u201d Oh, well that\u2019s okay. So I\u2019m sure the president didn\u2019t know anything about the violence, right?\u2019 Trump also reminded the crowd that Hillary Clinton actually paid one of the fighters $1500 and a new cell phone in return for causing a massive fight at his Chicago rally. Look, these are the exact same tactics that Hitler use. Hillary Clinton is exactly like Hitler. I call her Hitlery! If you wanna stop Hitlery, then the first step is to share this article out and make the world see Trump is way better. Step two is to get out and VOTE! '"}, "time": 1742564494.4015672}
