The TV belongs to Myra and Raymond Turner, the parents of Kevin Turner, a former Alabama fullback who played eight seasons in the N. F. L. This Sunday, that TV will be tuned to the N. F. L. playoffs, to the game that killed their son. \u201cI know a lot of people are going to say, \u2018How do you watch football knowing football had taken your son\u2019s own life? \u2019\u201d Raymond Turner said. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to explain, really. It\u2019s just all so hard to explain. \u201d I traveled to Alabama to hear an explanation and try to understand it  \u2014   and maybe even understand why they allow their two teenage grandsons to play football after Kevin, the boys\u2019 father, suffered for six long years with a brain disease that research has linked to head trauma in football. He died last March at 46. There was no clear answer to my question, only compartmentalized memories. In the house on the lake, which Kevin helped his parents buy, reminders of him appear at every turn. On the desk in his old bedroom is one of his Alabama playbooks in the rec room are seven of his jerseys, framed in the living room, there is his Philadelphia Eagles helmet and, of course, the giant   TV, which used to be his. Kevin, who played for the New England Patriots as well as the Eagles, died after being treated for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as A. L. S. and Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease. Kevin donated his brain to researchers in Boston who have examined the brains of more than 200 former football players after they died. The researchers said Kevin Turner\u2019s brain was \u201criddled\u201d with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C. T. E. which has been tied to repeated blows to the head. When watching Sunday\u2019s playoff games, you probably won\u2019t think about Turner. But you should. In a life that was shortened by football, he made a wide and lasting impact on the sport. After the diagnosis in 2010, Turner became one of the main plaintiffs in a   lawsuit former players brought against the N. F. L. claiming that the league hid the   cognitive dangers of the game. The league agreed to a settlement for potentially hundreds of millions of dollars, and the first payouts from that litigation are expected in the coming months. Turner didn\u2019t live to see a penny of that settlement money. The cash could have helped him when his body deteriorated and his family had to care for him. The Turners remember their son, who once weighed 235 pounds, dwindling to 100. At first, he lost strength in his left hand. And his left arm. Then his right arm and hand. Then his neck. His mother had to learn how to thicken water so he wouldn\u2019t choke while drinking it, and how to clean his breathing and feeding tubes. By the end, Kevin couldn\u2019t eat, drink, swallow or talk, as he fought for each breath. \u201cIt\u2019s all been really hard,\u201d Myra said, as she started to cry. \u201cIt\u2019s worse than you can imagine, having to be a nurse to your son and then losing your only son. \u201d With the family\u2019s cooperation, HBO\u2019s \u201cReal Sports with Bryant Gumbel\u201d has chronicled the six years of Kevin\u2019s decline for a segment that will be televised on Tuesday. His parents think it is important to tell their story, to raise awareness about C. T. E. They take no offense at questions about why they haven\u2019t turned their backs on football. They still watch. They just watch differently. They pay a lot more attention to college games than to the N. F. L. and they are always interested in seeing how officials treat a player who might have a concussion. They have tuned into the N. F. L. playoffs, and they plan to watch the Super Bowl. Neither is ignoring the risk of C. T. E. but Raymond said, \u201cIt\u2019s probably too late for those guys in the N. F. L. \u201d As Myra Turner watched the Dallas Cowboys play the Packers last weekend, she saw a TV camera stop on the former Cowboys running back Emmitt Smith, who was celebrating and grabbing his seatmate, Tony Dorsett, another Cowboys alumnus. Dorsett, who has said he has memory loss and other signs of C. T. E. didn\u2019t look right. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even crack a smile,\u201d Myra said. \u201cHe was just sitting there and I thought, \u2018Wow, how can he sit there with no emotion at all?\u2019 Then I realized, oh, yeah, I do know why. \u2019\u201d The Turners grew up in this state, where football is king, a rite passed from fathers to sons. Raymond played, then coached Kevin. \u201cI\u2019m a guy, so I love football  \u2014   the hitting, the running, the scoring, the girls,\u201d Raymond said, before Myra cut him off. \u201cAnd I was a cheerleader!\u201d she said. \u201cI was the only girl you\u2019re talking about, right?\u201d By their smiles and giggles, you could tell football once brought them unquestionable joy, long before anyone had heard of C. T. E.  \u2014   or even took concussions seriously. Today, their granddaughter, Natalie, 16, is a cheerleader dating a football player, just as her grandmother did. Myra won\u2019t watch her grandsons play. Raymond watches every game. Nolan was a redshirt freshman at Clemson last season. Cole plays in middle school. \u201cTheir dad told them to think long and hard before playing football because of what it could possibly do to their brains,\u201d Raymond said. \u201cBut the boys wanted to play. The game is much safer. What can you do? We make sure they are extra careful. \u201d He said: \u201cIf the boys said they didn\u2019t want to play football anymore, I\u2019d be pretty happy about that. But Nolan is 19 and can make his own decisions now. I can\u2019t convince him of anything. \u201d As the couple talked about their bittersweet relationship with football, Raymond twisted a napkin so many times and so tightly that it became a hard, tiny paper sculpture. Myra\u2019s eyes filled with tears. \u201cI can\u2019t believe my son is gone,\u201d she said. Kevin was buried last Easter in Prattville, Ala. about four miles from his high school football field, which is now named after him. On Thursday, his grave was marked with a small white metal cross and a vase of white artificial flowers, which had fallen onto its side. The squares of sod atop his plot had yet to grow together. His bronze grave marker  \u2014   which will be finished any day now  \u2014   will have his name, Paul Kevin Turner, and two etchings of him in a football uniform  \u2014   one from his days at Alabama, the other from when he was with the Eagles. Between his dates of birth and death, there will be a raised image of a golden football. \u201cI didn\u2019t think twice about putting football on there,\u201d Myra said. \u201cBecause that was his life, our life. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561939.7599418}
