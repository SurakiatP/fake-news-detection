JoAnna Klein, a science writer, brings us today\u2019s introduction. Earlier this month, the scientific journal Conservation Biology published a study that found that nearly half of the fish sampled at roughly 10 percent of Los Angeles sushi restaurants were not what they were purported to be on menus. In many cases fish were substituted with cheaper, more environmentally sustainable catches. But in some instances, replacement fish were actually endangered or threatened. Halibut and red snapper were found to be the most frequently misidentified. Between 2012 and 2014, researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles and Loyola Marymount University sent their students to 26 Los Angeles restaurants with various price points and high ratings on Yelp and Zagat. Their mission was simple: Order dishes containing each of nine targeted fish that are common on menus and often mislabeled confirm with the restaurant that the fish was what the menu said it was collect a piece of sushi about the size of a kernel of corn drop it in a labeled jar of ethanol and take it back to the lab for DNA analysis. Knowing rates of mislabeled fish is important, the authors say, because it threatens consumer health. It also threatens a marine ecosystem and the billion dollar fishing industry that depends on it. But studies in the past have been inconsistent in terms of seafood mislabeling rates. \u201cWe wanted to see why there is that huge level of variation,\u201d said Demian Willette, a biologist who helped lead the study. So they did the same thing at the same place each year for four years. The students collected more than 350 samples over all. In every restaurant, there was at least one case of mislabeled fish. But the researchers say you can\u2019t blame the restaurant in every case. Like their diners, and even their grocers, the restaurants were most likely victims of fish fraud. For consumers going forward, Mr. Willette suggested asking your waiter directly what you\u2019re ordering.

Caught on surveillance video, she draped bacon on a door handle and broke half a dozen window panes at the Islamic Center of Davis. Pork is forbidden under Islamic dietary laws. A hate crime inquiry was opened by the authorities in Davis, a college town known more for its   culture and farmers\u2019 markets. Throughout the day Monday,   dropped by the mosque with flowers and messages of support. An online campaign raised nearly $20, 000 for repairs. Lynsie Mason, 23, a nearby resident, walked over with a box of doughnuts and a card. Mosque leaders said hate incidents were rare. Ahmed Ali, a postdoc in civil engineering at U. C. Davis, said he was less rattled by the vandalism than perplexed. \u201cThe motivation is unknown. Why?\u201d he said. \u201cI mean if she wants to steal something, that\u2019s fine. She might be in need. \u201d He paused and then added, \u201cIt\u2019s just hate. \u201d Before he was a photographer, Michael Zagaris was a law school dropout in the 1960s. He started dropping acid and hanging out at the Fillmore music club in San Francisco with a notion that he would write a book. Armed with a tape recorder and a camera, he interviewed the musicians who performed there. It was Eric Clapton who suggested to Mr. Zagaris that he should try to sell his pictures. And that\u2019s the moment he found his calling  \u2014   photographing rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. As luck had it, San Francisco was assuming a central place in rock history at the time. Looking back, Mr. Zagaris said in an interview, \u201cI was in Europe for the Renaissance. \u201d Late last year, he put out a new photography book, \u201cTotal Excess,\u201d with images of the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, the Grateful Dead, Lou Reed, the Clash and others at the height of their fame in the 1970s.
