He wrote on Saturday that Trump \u2014 to whom he refers as El Caudillo del Mar-A-Lago \u2014 had \u201cmanaged to exceed even my admittedly expansive limits for political obscenity.\u201d \\nPierce was talking about Trump\u2019s reaction after President Obama responded to an elderly heckler wearing a military tunic at a Friday campaign rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina. \\nAs the crowd booed the man, Obama said, \u201cHey! Listen up! I told you to be focused, and you\u2019re not focused right now. Listen to what I\u2019m saying. Hold up. Hold up! \u2026 Everybody sit down, and be quiet for a second\u2026 First of all, we live in a country that respects free speech. Second of all, it looks like maybe he might\u2019ve served in our military and we got to respect that. Third of all, he was elderly and we got to respect our elders. And fourth of all, don\u2019t boo, vote.\u201d \\nIn other words, the President showed poise, grace and yes, class. But shortly after, here\u2019s how the moment was seen through Trump\u2019s eyes at a rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania: \u201cThere was a protester and a protester that likes us,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd what happened is they wouldn\u2019t put the cameras on him. They kept the cameras on Obama. \u2026 He was talking to a protester, screaming at him, really screaming at him. By the way, if I spoke the way Obama spoke to that protester, they would say he became unhinged.\u201d \\nUnhinged? Really? We all know that Trump seems to get his news from an implanted electrode picking up propaganda signals from the Planet Mongo. But there comes a point when the lies piled upon lies become too much for even the fairest and most equable of us. Hearing Trump\u2019s demonstrably false description of what happened at Obama\u2019s rally, Charlie Pierce finally had it. \\n\u201cMaybe it was because it was so ludicrously provable a lie,\u201d he wrote. \u201c[Trump] didn\u2019t care. He never has cared. His contempt for the democratic processes and for the norms of self-government is matched only by the deep contempt he has for all the suckers who mistake his contempt for the American experiment for their deep disappointment in it. He has measured their intelligence by his heavily leveraged net worth and found them hilariously lacking. \\n\u201cWe are all the subcontractors who build his indomitable ego for him and, as such, he can stiff us according to his customary business plan. His campaign long ago became a sickening charade performed by a grotesque charlatan.\u201d \\nThe Scene in Reno \\nAnd so it is. Look, too, at how Trump and his followers at a rally in Reno, Nevada, on Saturday responded to a man with a \u201cRepublicans against Trump\u201d sign. Before someone shouted \u201cGun!\u201d and the moment turned even uglier, Trump had looked down and said, \u201cOh we have one of those guys from the Hillary Clinton campaign. How much are you being paid, $1,500?\u201d As the crowd booed, Trump said, \u201cOkay. Take him out.\u201d The run-down PIX Theatre sign reads \u201cVote Trump\u201d on Main Street in Sleepy Eye, Minnesota. July 15, 2016.

He told The Guardian he was grateful to the police who removed him from the auditorium for interrogation \u2014 they kept him from being further kicked, choked and pummeled by the gang of Trump supporters who surrounded him. \\nStill, he said, \u201cThe people who attacked me \u2014 I\u2019m not blaming them. I\u2019m blaming Donald Trump\u2019s hate rhetoric, \u2026 The fact that I got beat up today, that\u2019s just showing what he\u2019s doing to his crowds.\u201d \\nThroughout the campaign, whenever Trump has egged on his followers, I\u2019ve thought of that line in Young Frankenstein, when the angry Transylvanian villagers are told by the local police inspector, \u201cA riot is an ugly thing, and I think that it is just about time we had one.\u201d \\nRemember what Trump said when a protester was dragged out of a February rally in Las Vegas: \u201cI love the old days \u2014 you know what they used to do to guys like that when they were in a place like this? They\u2019d be carried out on a stretcher, folks. \u2026 I\u2019d like to punch him in the face.\u201d \\nBy now, you\u2019ve heard it all before and the litany of lies, outrageous claims and insults has climbed so high that many of us have become numb and weary from the sheer repetition of Trump\u2019s buffoonery. You can only go to so many demolition derbies before the sight of flaming car wrecks becomes routine. \\nDog Whistles \\nWhat\u2019s more, you can argue that far more insidious and frightening are the dog whistle attacks appealing to the baser instincts of the bigoted and ignorant. The latest: the closing ad from the Trump campaign that, with anti-Semitic overtones, points fingers at \u201ca global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class.\u201d Former   speaking with supporters at a campaign rally in Phoenix, Arizona. March 21, 2016.

It is no accident.\u201d \\nHere is something Charlie Pierce wrote back in May . Trump, he said, \u201cis riding on a wave of pain that he never has felt.\u201d \\n\u201cHe is riding on a wave of anxiety he never has encountered. Beyond their love of him, there is no indication that he is as deeply aware of what has powered his rise as the people whose fear, and doubt, and, yes, hatred has powered his rise. Their job is still to wait in line, cheer on cue, and give him the devotion that he has earned because, after all, he is He, Trump, and they\u2019re not, and that will never change.\u201d \\nAdd it all up and to me, this is what it comes down to: Do you want to live in a United States where anger, prejudice and fear rule, and dissent is viewed as treason, or in a country where we try to meet every issue from terrorism to education with clear eyes and a rational mind? \\nThis year\u2019s choices are far from perfect, but nonetheless a choice must be made. To quote a founding father who believed in such things: liberty, once lost, is lost forever. This could be democracy\u2019s last stop. Vote. \\nMichael Winship is the Emmy Award-winning senior writer of Moyers & Company and BillMoyers.com, and a former senior writing fellow at the policy and advocacy group Demos.
