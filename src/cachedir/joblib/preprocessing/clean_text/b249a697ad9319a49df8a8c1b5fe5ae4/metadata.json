A government source said: \u2018The ex-Bake Off team were definitely our first choice to make a call on Article 50. They are far more likely to reach a decision that meets with public approval than those boring old farts in the Supreme Court. I mean, what have they got? OK, 265 years\u2019 worth of legal experience between them and significant expertise in relevant fields of constitutional precedent and interpreting centuries of law. But you know, Mary Berry! Mel and Sue! Soggy bottoms! Ha ha! What do you mean, \u201cis that really sufficient\u201d? You\u2019re obviously some kind of rabid anti-democratic elitist.\u2019 \\nBerry admitted to being \u2018surprised\u2019 but willing to rise to the challenge proposed by the government. \u2018Up to now my experience hasn\u2019t really included very much British constitutional law or international jurisprudence,\u2019 she said. \u2018But I do know when something is half-baked, impossible to prove, likely to crumble into a mess, or just leaves an absolutely disgusting taste in the mouth. So perhaps I will be able to understand the government\u2019s Brexit strategy after all.\u2019 \\n\u2018There are all sorts of reasons why this is an absolute blinder of an idea,\u2019 said prime minister Theresa May in a Commons statement. \u2018It\u2019s great for the employment figures as it keeps these three women in work when they\u2019d otherwise be on the scrap heap. They\u2019re significantly more popular with the public than those fusty old bastards who found against us last week. Although I understand Sue is openly gay, so we\u2019ll have to make sure nobody tells the Mail. She doesn\u2019t fence, does she? \\n\u2018Mind you, \u201cGiedroyc\u201d\u2026what\u2019s that, Polish? Somebody get Amber Rudd on the phone, quick.\u2019 Share this story... \\nPosted: Nov 4th, 2016 by NewsBiscuit Click for more article by NewsBiscuit ..
