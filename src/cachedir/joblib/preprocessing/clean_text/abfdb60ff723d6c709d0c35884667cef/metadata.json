As the bus approaches, Obama grabs Hillary and tosses her out on to the street, where she is then run over by the oncoming bus. \\nOf course, this would never happen \u2013 literally. Neither Obama nor Clinton would ever be caught dead on a bus. Under it, yes - but not in one. \\nNaturally, I\u2019m kidding about Barack tossing Hillary under the bus. He has not the strength to do so. Again \u2013 kidding. These are the jokes. I\u2019m here all night. \\nBut seriously \u2013 it does appear that Obama has figuratively thrown her highness under the bus, again, for her ever-growing email scandal. I say again, for this isn\u2019t the first time the president has done so. \\nIn 2015, when asked about Hillary\u2019s private server, Obama stated , \u201cThe policy of my administration is to encourage transparency, which is why my emails, the Blackberry I carry around, all those records are available and archived.\u201d Translation \u2013 I don\u2019t know what she has been doing, but I follow the law. \\nMy buddy Tim Brown at Freedom Outpost reported that both Obama and Biden, prior to the 2012 election, threw Hillary under the bus over the Benghazi scandal. Both men claimed they had no knowledge that those in Benghazi requested more security prior to the attack. Biden stated during a Vice Presidential debate that year that, \u201cWe [Biden and Obama] weren\u2019t told they wanted more security. We did not know they wanted more security there,\u201d effectively hanging it on Hillary. \\nIt\u2019s common knowledge of the disdain the Obamas have for the Clintons, and vice versa. As far out radical as Obama is, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a crook \u2013 or if he is, he is better at hiding it. Obama doesn\u2019t appear to have sold the White House to highest bidder the way Hillary did at State \u2013 or selling naked options on her potential to become president. \\nAt this point, it seems Barack is probably tiring of constantly having to defend a woman he really can\u2019t stand, which is why, in my estimation, he is once again hanging her out to dry. \\nJust yesterday, White House spokes-punk Josh Earnest said that the White House stood by FBI Director James Comey on Monday as a man of 'integrity' and 'principle' in the face of a Democrat-led assault on his character and intentions. This is a major blow to Clinton \u2013 one I\u2019m sure she is furious over. \\nThe Daily Mail reports Earnest stated at a daily briefing that, \u201cThe president\u2019s assessment of his [Comey] integrity and his character has not changed. The president doesn\u2019t believe he\u2019s secretly strategizing to benefit one candidate or one political party.\u201d This, despite attacks on Comey\u2019s character by Clinton, her surrogates, and now \u201cDirty\u201d Harry Reid. \\nIn a rather surprising turn, Earnest even defended President George W. Bush for his selection of Comey. This is highly unusual, as it is this White House\u2019s historic M.O. to blame Bush for literally everything. \\nI don\u2019t know why the White House seems to be separating itself from the Clinton camp. If I had to guess, beyond the hatred factor, I\u2019d say that Obama has calculated that, at this point, his legacy is far more important than a president Hillary, and he does not wish to be forever connected to the scandal-ridden candidate. It\u2019s probably a fair calculation. That, and maybe by favoring Comey in this war, he might himself purchase some good will to keep his involvement under wraps.
