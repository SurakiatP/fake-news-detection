Bush a personal note that alarmed some of Mr. Blair\u2019s top national security aides  \u2014   and was greeted with relief in Washington. \u201cI will be with you, whatever,\u201d Mr. Blair wrote, in what appeared to be a blanket promise of British support if the United States went to war to topple Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader. Getting rid of Mr. Hussein was \u201cthe right thing to do,\u201d Mr. Blair wrote, predicting that \u201chis departure would free up the region. \u201d Fourteen years later, Mr. Blair\u2019s pledge was revealed publicly on Wednesday as part of a voluminous,   official investigation into how and why Britain went to war in Iraq. The main conclusions in the report, by the independent Iraq Inquiry Committee, were familiar: that Britain, like the United States, used flawed intelligence to justify the invasion, that Iraq posed no immediate national security threat, that the allies acted militarily before all diplomatic options had been exhausted and that there was a lack of planning for what would happen once Mr. Hussein was removed. Yet the report still had enormous resonance in Britain, in part because it came at a moment when Britons are engaged in a debate over their country\u2019s place in the world after their vote last month to leave the European Union. The report also amounted to a moment of searing public accountability for Mr. Blair, whose legacy has been defined in Britain almost entirely, and almost entirely negatively, for his decision to go into Iraq alongside the United States. Mr. Blair\u2019s note to Mr. Bush was part of what the report showed to be a campaign to back the United States before the war and to steer the White House toward building diplomatic support for efforts to address the perceived threat from Iraq. The report\u2019s 2. 6 million words describe a prime minister who wanted stronger evidence of the need for military action and a more solid plan for occupying Iraq and reconstituting a government there. Beyond its pledge of fealty to Mr. Bush, the July 28, 2002, note warned broadly of the risks of \u201cunintended consequences\u2019\u2019 from an invasion and presciently forecast that other European nations would be reluctant to back the war. But by the time the invasion was launched, most of Mr. Blair\u2019s warnings and conditions had been swept aside, the report concluded. The chairman of the committee, John Chilcot, said on Wednesday morning that Mr. Blair had been advised by his diplomats and ministers of \u201cthe inadequacy of U. S. plans\u201d and their concern \u201cabout the inability to exert significant influence on U. S. planning. \u201d Mr. Blair chose to override their objections. Within hours of the report\u2019s release, Mr. Blair appeared at a nearly   news conference in which he acknowledged missteps and intelligence failures, but defended his decision to go to war. Now rejected by his own Labour Party, his place in British history defined by those crucial days in 2002 and 2003, he looked humbled, even haunted, saying that not a day went by when he did not think about decisions he made more than a decade ago. \u201cThere will not be a day of my life where I do not relive and rethink what happened,\u201d Mr. Blair said. \u201cPeople ask me why I spend so much time in the Middle East today. This is why. This is why I work on Middle East peace. \u201d A decisive moment seemed to come when Mr. Blair\u2019s draft of the 2002 note to Mr. Bush, classified \u201c\u201d circulated to two senior aides, David Manning and Jonathan Powell. The report disclosed that they urged Mr. Blair to soften or delete the \u201cI will be with you, whatever\u201d declaration, and not to tie his political fate too tightly to Mr. Bush\u2019s judgments. Mr. Manning, a former ambassador to Washington and Mr. Blair\u2019s chief foreign policy adviser, testified that he had told Mr. Blair the sentence was \u201ctoo sweeping,\u201d that it seemed to \u201cclose off options\u201d and that there was \u201ca risk it would be taken at face value. \u201d Mr. Blair later said he thought he had amended the sentence, but he had not. Mr. Blair insisted that he had provided no \u201cblank check\u201d to Washington, and the note quickly moved to an assessment of the many difficulties of such a war, including building a political coalition to back it and the \u201cneed to commit to Iraq for the long term. \u201d He warned of \u201cunintended consequences,\u201d like large numbers of Iraqi civilian casualties or an eruption \u201cof the Arab street. \u201d The report concluded that Mr. Blair and the British government both underestimated the difficulties and consequences of the war and significantly overestimated the influence he would have over Mr. Bush. The results have haunted Iraq, the United States and Britain ever since: more than 200 British dead, including 179 soldiers, at least 4, 500 American dead and more than 150, 000 Iraqi dead, most of them civilians, as sectarian warfare, terrorist groups and actors like Iran have filled the vacuum left by Mr. Hussein. Just this week, at least 250 Iraqi civilians died from a car bomb in Baghdad as they celebrated the final days of the holy month of Ramadan. As Mr. Chilcot\u2019s committee delved back into what seems to many young Britons like ancient history  \u2014   students entering college this year were 4 years old when the critical decisions were being made  \u2014   they found something of an echo chamber between London and Washington. An intelligence official, Tim Dowse, told the committee that British officials were nervous enough about United States suspicions that aluminum tubes acquired by Mr. Hussein could be used in centrifuges to enrich uranium that they had initially kept the subject out of a British summary of Iraq\u2019s weapons projects published in 2002. After Vice President Dick Cheney had talked about the tubes on American television, \u201cwe felt that it would look odd if we said nothing on the subject,\u201d Mr. Towse said. \u201cIt would open us up to questions. \u201d So the report mentioned the tubes but noted \u201cwe couldn\u2019t confirm that they were intended for a nuclear program. \u201d Such questions about the prewar intelligence were left unresolved, despite Mr. Blair\u2019s   desire for a \u201csmoking gun. \u201d Mr. Blair stressed on Wednesday that the report concluded that he had not invented or distorted intelligence. But he won little sympathy: The current leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, apologized for the party\u2019s having led Britain into the war, and the governing Conservatives were happy to let the Labour Party eat itself up over Mr. Blair and Iraq. The sense that Britain was led into carnage by a foolish devotion to the United States has had lasting consequences and made members of Parliament reluctant to authorize further military action alongside Washington. The legacy of Iraq kept Britain from joining the United States in bombing Syria over its use of chemical weapons. It was also a factor in President Obama\u2019s decision to back away from a military strike on Syria\u2019s chemical weapons facilities, and to delay military activity there against the Islamic State. But having been a forceful ally of President Bill Clinton in the Kosovo war and having intervened successfully in Sierra Leone in 2000, Mr. Blair was a believer in using force to impose a more rational world order, and after the attacks on the United States on Sept. 11, 2001, he was quick to align himself with Mr. Bush. The inquiry\u2019s verdict on the planning and conduct of British military involvement in Iraq was withering, rejecting Mr. Blair\u2019s contention that the difficulties encountered after the invasion could not have been foreseen. \u201cWe do not agree that hindsight is required,\u201d Mr. Chilcot said. \u201cThe risks of internal strife in Iraq, active Iranian pursuit of its interests, regional instability and Al Qaeda activity in Iraq were each explicitly identified before the invasion. \u201d Mr. Blair\u2019s concern before the invasion of Iraq, the report makes clear, was less about the need to overthrow Mr. Hussein than about how to justify doing so. The intelligence that Mr. Blair presented in public had a great deal more certainty than his officials presented in private, the report said. The report says: \u201cAt no stage was the hypothesis that Iraq might not have chemical, biological or nuclear weapons or programs identified and examined\u201d by Britain\u2019s Joint Intelligence Committee. \u201cThe U. K. chose to join the invasion of Iraq before the peaceful options for disarmament had been exhausted,\u201d the report said. \u201cMilitary action at that time was not a last resort. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628514.6817052}
