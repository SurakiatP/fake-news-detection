The United Nations is planning to have all humans imprinted with biometric identification cards . \\nVia AlternativeNews \\n\\nIf you\u2019re not sure what this means for you, it would basically be sci-fi meets 1984. The world government would know where you go, what you do, who you\u2019re with, and who you are at all times, anywhere, every day and every night. It means more restrictions and less freedom. The United Nations wants everyone to have a biometric identification tag by 2030, which is part of their Global Goals agenda .\\nThe United Nations is already working hard toward the implementation of this goal \u2013 particularly among refugee populations.

The United Nations has always been a force for world dominance, and this program will be enforced the world over. This is already being done through social media, but because services like Facebook are not obligatory for all citizens, the next logical step is to force citizens to participate in this very program.\\nAre they running behind schedule ?
