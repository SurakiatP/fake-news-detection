( Image via intoday.in ) \\nIn an audio message a written letter of appreciation to the Times Group, Dr. Singh wrote that he has never enjoyed a television debate this much. \u201cMay you be seized of the matter that I thoroughly enjoy the absolutely soothing, calming silence of the new Newshour. Until last week, when I wanted to sleep at night, I used to re-watch my own speeches earlier on the economy etc but for the past few days, every night at 9 pm, I turn the channel on and thanks to the pin-drop silence and sheer pointlessness of it all, I manage to doze off in not more than 10 minutes. Theek hai !!! ,\u201d the two-time former PM\u2019s letter read. \\nDr. Singh also found company in his praise, from the Art of Living founder Sri Sri Ravi Shankar. \u201cI have taught people pranayama and various kriyas for many years now, but I have to admit that the new Newshour is working like magic. Even the most angry, irascible people in our course cool down and sleep like smiling babies on watching the program. Not even Yogendra Yadav\u2019s honey-like, mellifluous voice has had such an impact in recent times. More power..err..actually, lesser & lesser power, to the new Newshour!\u201d Sri Sri told The UnReal Times . \\nBJP spokesperson Siddharth Nath Singh, who still appears on the debate, admitted to feeling very unsettled and uncomfortable. \u201cAll these days, I was on the edge of my seat, ever ready to out -shout -squeal the Congress guys. But yesterday, I almost snoozed, yet, people actually waited for me to answer. It was extremely awkward,\u201d Singh stated. \\nTimes Now, however, chose the former PM\u2019s praise as the topic of their next debate, with the hashtag #SilenceOfTheLambs. \u201cLook boss, Arnab might not be here any longer \u2013 that can explain the silence, but that doesn\u2019t mean our hashtags aren\u2019t kickass anymore. We\u2019re still killing it in that department,\u201d a Times Now hashtagger exclaimed, before tweeting Dr. Singh\u2019s praise with the \u201cTIMES NOW IMPACT\u201d prefix.
