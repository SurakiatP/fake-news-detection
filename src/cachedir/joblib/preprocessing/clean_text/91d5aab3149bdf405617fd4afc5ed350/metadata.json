The announcement was not unexpected, but it reflected the stark divisions in Britain as the government prepares to start the official process to exit the   bloc. Citing the fact that most Scottish voters had opposed a British exit in last year\u2019s referendum  \u2014   62 percent voted in favor of staying in the European Union, compared with 48 percent in Britain over all  \u2014   Ms. Sturgeon said that London had failed to address Scotland\u2019s desire to remain in the single market after Britain leaves. \u201cNot only is there no U. K.  agreement on the way ahead, but the U. K. government has not moved even an inch in pursuit of compromise and agreement,\u201d Ms. Sturgeon said in a speech in Edinburgh. \u201cOur efforts at compromise have instead been met with a brick wall of intransigence. \u201d Scotland rejected independence from Britain in a closely watched vote in September 2014, and public opinion on the issue remains deeply divided. For Scotland to hold another legally binding referendum, the British Parliament would have to give its approval, as would the Scottish Parliament. Ms. Sturgeon\u2019s comments came hours before the British Parliament was expected to clear the way for Prime Minister Theresa May to invoke Article 50, the formal procedure that sets off a   negotiation with the 27 other member states of the European Union. Ms. Sturgeon said her preferred time frame for a new vote would be in the autumn of 2018 or the spring of 2019, when the terms of a British exit from the bloc would be clearer. She said she would ask Scotland\u2019s devolved legislature in Edinburgh to request approval from the British Parliament for the new referendum, known as a Section 30 order, next week. Mrs. May has accused Ms. Sturgeon and her Scottish National Party, which dominates politics in Scotland, of having an \u201cobsession\u201d with independence. But officials say it would be politically difficult for Mrs. May to refuse a new referendum outright. The prime minister\u2019s office said in a statement on Monday that it had been \u201cworking closely\u201d with Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, \u201crecognizing the many areas of common ground\u201d on issues like fighting terrorism and protecting workers\u2019 rights. \u201cThe evidence clearly shows that a majority of people in Scotland do not want a second independence referendum,\u201d the statement said. \u201cAnother referendum would be divisive and cause huge economic uncertainty at the worst possible time. The Scottish government should focus on delivering good government and public services for the people in Scotland. \u201d Ms. Sturgeon\u2019s party won the 2015 election in Scotland on a manifesto that left open the door for another independence referendum should circumstances \u201cmaterially change,\u201d and she had cited a   Brexit  \u2014   then considered highly unlikely  \u2014   as an example of such a change. The real fight might be over timing: London, officials say, would prefer that Scotland put off another vote until after Britain has left the European Union, betting that voters will feel less confident about leaving once they have been pulled out of the bloc. Ms. Sturgeon emphasized that Scotland should not be withdrawn from Europe against the will of its people. She also pointed to the weakness of the opposition Labour Party, citing predictions of a Conservative Party government in London \u201cuntil 2030 or beyond. \u201d Since the June referendum on Britain\u2019s future in Europe, Ms. Sturgeon has argued that Scotland should be given a special status. So far, Mrs. May has ruled out any concessions. On Monday, Ms. Sturgeon said there could be room for compromise if the prime minister were to offer a deal for Scotland, but she noted that no options had yet been offered.'"}, "time": 1742628449.791873}
