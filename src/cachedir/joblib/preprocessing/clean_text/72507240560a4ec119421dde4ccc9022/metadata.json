Luckily, there are some who realized this move is straight out of the leftist playbook and called out the press for what they were up to \u2014 lying. No longer can they report Hillary being ahead by double digits. In what\u2019s been dubbed \u201cthe monster vote,\u201d here are the poll numbers they do not want you to see. \\nWhat\u2019s the monster vote? That\u2019s the silent majority in this country who are going to overwhelm all of the liberal talking heads\u2019 expectations. We started to see the monster vote for Donald Trump in the primaries, where he attracted voters to register as Republicans to vote in the primaries. \\nNow, we have early voting taking place in some states, and those numbers are proving, here comes the monster vote . Gateway Pundit reported: \\nDONALD TRUMP Senior Communications Advisor Jason Miller shared some very positive news on FOX News on Sunday morning. \\nJason Miller told Melissa Francis the Trump Campaign is up 100,000 votes in Florida and 35,000 votes in North Carolina compared to four years ago . Trump rally (left), \u201cWe\u2019re gonna need a bigger basket\u201d meme (right) \\nLet\u2019s break that down further to see what it means. Based on all the early voting in Florida, which is a must win for Trump, right now, it\u2019s Trump = 51.5%, HRC = 48.5%, which is incredible. Democrats typically rule early voting, and in 2012, at this point, Barack Obama was up by 5% in Florida. Now, for the monster vote news for Florida, as broken down by The Conservative Treehouse (CTH): \\nThis is YUGE because Obama won early voting in FL by 5 points in 2012 and after election night he won the state by less than 1 point. ( LINK ) Actual in person voting on the traditional election day, November 8th, will heavily favor Donald Trump. \\nFolks, based on what we have data wise so far and the fact that the 16 counties didn\u2019t start early voting until the 29th of October (which favors Trump based on data above), I can now soundly say that we will win FL by 8 to 10 points (54.5 \u2013 46.5). The monster vote is coming. \\nThe mainstream media will continue to slant the early voting numbers for Hillary, so don\u2019t listen to them. I guarantee you, they are taking a sample and then skewing it. Remember, Democrats almost always vote early, but Republicans don\u2019t usually vote until election day. Based on what these smart guys at CTH are saying, North Carolina, Ohio, and Nevada will go Trump and even Minnesota and Wisconsin are slanting towards Trump, which would be just icing on the cake since those states usually go Democrat. \\nTune out the mainstream media on the polls and get ready for the monster vote. It seems to be the best-kept secret in this election. The monster voters are the forgotten men and women across this country who haven\u2019t voted in years and are now sick and tired of Washington\u2019s corruption invading their life. \\nThey\u2019re back with a vengeance, and they have hope that we can turn this country around. We all agree it will be pure joy on election night as we watch Hillary and her minions break down in disbelief that We the People took our power back and we will never give it away again.'"}, "time": 1742563875.8921719}
