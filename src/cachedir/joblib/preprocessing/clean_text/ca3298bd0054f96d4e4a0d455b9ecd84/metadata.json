The C$ is 11.369 grains of gold ($42.22 per ounce)\u2026 Sponsored \\nPresident Nixon \u201ctemporarily\u201d \u2013 to use his word \u2013 suspended the conversion of F$s into C$s back in 1971. \\nTrump\u2019s only option to end the clear divisions in the country is to increase prosperity with a level playing field for everyone. And the way to do that is to take away the advantages the 1%ers enjoy as a result of an unconstitutional monetary system. \\nThe Need To Build A Sound Monetary System So President Trump has to build a sound monetary system. To do this he must end Nixon\u2019s temporary suspension of dollar redeemability into gold. Restoring a Constitutional dollar will provide a solid the foundation for building a new monetary system. The best way to do that is to follow the precepts of the Coinage Act of 1792, which is America\u2019s first and best time-tested law concerning money. \\nBack in June, when asked about the gold standard Trump replied: \u201cBringing back the gold standard would be very hard to do, but boy, would it be wonderful.\u201d \\nThe \u201chard\u201d task he is of course referring to is making the gold standard credible after decades of monetary debasement. Rebuilding credibility will indeed be a difficult task, but can be accomplished over time. Initially all that is needed is to make sure that gold flows into the Treasury \u2013 and not out from it \u2013 when redemption of the dollar into gold is restored. \\nWill Trump Revalue Gold To $10,000? To do that Trump will need to make the new monetary system credible by accounting for all the monetary debasement of the F$ since 1971. That means the Treasury will need to be ready to act as required under a gold standard to buy gold and redeem dollars for gold at a credible price, which I calculate to be $10,000 per ounce. \\nSome may find $10,000 to be eye-watering, but this amount is based on historical experience. It would simply be repeating what happened in 1934. When President Roosevelt devalued the dollar by 41% from 23.222 grains of gold ($20.67) to 13.714 grains ($35), gold flowed into the Treasury in exchange for dollars. The resulting increase of sound money flowing into the economy enabled it to begin the process of recovering from the depths of the Great Depression. \\nSo to make a new gold standard credible by getting gold to flow into the Treasury, we need to repeat what FDR did. It is easy to calculate. \\nAfter the 1934 devaluation, the weight of gold in the Treasury was 15% of the total quantity of dollars in M3. Today M3 is $17.6 trillion, and supposedly there are 261.5 million ounces of gold in Treasury vaults. Which equates to $67,304 per ounce. So 15% of that is $10,095. For simplicity, let\u2019s round it to $10,000, meaning that one C$ would be defined as 0.048 of one grain of gold. At that $10,000 rate of exchange, gold will flow into the Treasury from the far reaches of the planet, benefitting global economies as well as the US economy. \\nWe need to ask ourselves, won\u2019t this resulting increase in the money supply be inflationary? Answer: No more than it was during the Great Depression. In one year after FDR\u2019s devaluation, M3 increased by 10.2%, but there was little inflation. The bulk of the new money was not put into speculation, but rather, used in productive purposes that began rebuilding the US economy. \\nWhat\u2019s more, commodities and other goods that were being hoarded as an alternative to bank deposits flowed into circulation, helping keep inflation under control. The same thing will happen today. But let\u2019s not forget, what happens to the federal government\u2019s debt mountain? I suspect some government promises will be broken \u2013 like changing Social Security to reduce payouts \u2013 to enable the debt to be brought back under control, which brings up one last point. \\nA credible national currency and creditworthy government are different things. They do go hand-in-hand, but you need the former to achieve the latter. The reason of course is that governments cannot create gold out of thin air, like they do paper dollars. That is the wisdom the framers enshrined in the Constitution. Let\u2019s hope Mr Trump values their wisdom and re-establishes the monetary legacy they left for us. A sound dollar helped build a great country where everybody was given the opportunity for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. \\nAs president with a Republican controlled Congress, Trump can change everything. America\u2019s best hope is he rescinds Nixon\u2019s \u201ctemporary\u201d suspension of the dollar\u2019s redeemability into gold and puts the dollar back on a credible gold standard at $10,000 per ounce.\u201d For those who are interested in hearing more about the gold market and the Trump shocker, KWN has just released   gold,   more. and you can listen to this extraordinary interview   Legend Art Cashin On A Trump Presidency, The New World Order, Gold, Brexit, The Great Depression And Why We Will See Panic  '"}, "time": 1742564435.3735824}
