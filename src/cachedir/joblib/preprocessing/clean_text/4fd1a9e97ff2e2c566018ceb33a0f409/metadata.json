Hastert paid someone referred to as \u201cIndividual A\u201d $3.5 million in hush money . You can read Hasterts indictment here. \\nIn the emails Richard L. \u201cJake\u201d Siewert, Jr. the head of corporate communications for Goldman Sachs , forwards John Podesta with the subject line: \u201cTax Breaking News\u201d a politico story about Dennis Hastert. Siewert then says to John Podesta, \u201cMight be time for Denny to vanish to an undisclosed Japanese island.\u201d Podesta never replied or his reply hasn\u2019t been found yet.\\n\u201cThe Justice Department on Thursday announced an indictment against former House Speaker Dennis Hastert for allegedly structuring cash transactions to avoid financial reporting rules and lying to the FBI about his conduct. A grand jury in Illinois charged that Hastert agreed to pay an unnamed individual $3.5 million as part of an effort to conceal \u201chis prior misconduct.\u201d\\n\u201cMight be time for Denny to vanish to an undisclosed Japanese island.\u201d\\nFederal Judge Thomas Durkin the judge that sentenced Hastert is quoted calling Hastert, a \u201cserial child molester.\u201d\\nFBI translator whistle-blower Sibel Edmonds and James Corbett covered the real Dennis Hastert case back in October, 2015, that the mainstream media wouldn\u2019t dare touch pedophilia, blackmail, Graymail and drug money. \\nIn 2015, Sibel launched a social network campaign to expose Dennis Hastert\u2019s real crimes. \\nSibel is quoted calling the Hastert scandal \u201ctoo deep, too dark\u201d and said that it \u201ccovers too many people from both sides of the political aisle for it to ever proceed in public.\u201d\\nBefore that in 2009, Sibel Edmonds testified in a deposition after being gagged for years about her personal knowledge of treason, blackmail of Members of Congress, bribery, and other criminal activities, including pedophilia in the government while working as a translator. Specifically Sibel talked about Dennis Hastert years ago on June 1st, 2008. In which Sibel said that, \u201cHastert was caught on FBI wiretaps accepting bribes from Turkish criminal elements associated with the Turkish government, as documented in Vanity Fair in 2005 and elsewhere .\u201d Sibels history with Dennis Hastert didn\u2019t start there though, before that Edmond\u2019s published a gallery which included Hastert\u2019s picture in response to being gagged.\\nIn her deposition, \u201cSibel testified that it was well known that Hastert engaged in these activities in non-secure locations and was videotaped\u201d Cynthia McKinney, writes.\\nFormer U.S. representative Cynthia McKinney also knew about the pedophilia within the government in 2005. She grilled Rumsfeld on DynCorp\u2019s child trafficking business selling women and children. None of this is new see our previous article on elite pedophilia on the Franklin cover up, the finders etc. It\u2019s the elite\u2019s dirty little secret so it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if Podesta\u2019s emails really were child trafficking coded messages . Especially since internet sleuths at reddit and /pol/ have connected some shocking dots regarding Podesta and Clinton friends. Even if some of it is far fetched like the Podesta brothers kidnapping of Madeleine Beth McCann doesn\u2019t mean this research should be ignored.\\nWe are at war and to quote Sibel Edmonds one final time.\\n\u201cSure. They have all the mega print and TV outlets. But we have the power of numbers, resolve and persistence. And we have this website, the internet and all the social networks and forums that go with it.\u201d\\n~Sibel Edmonds, writes.\\nIv provided a link to Sibel Edmond\u2019s old website, BoilingFrogsPost and several YouTube videos of her and James Corbett\u2019s investigation into the Hastert child abuse scandal. To quote Sibel and James, \u201cP edophiles Run the Government AND No One Gives a Damn!\u201d Do you?\\n\\nSibel relentlessly covered the Hastert scandal and fought to tell us the truth now iv been informed that Sibel needs our help we always tell you to support real independent media and journalist. When we say that we don\u2019t only mean us. As alternative media we must stick together to conquer the mainstream media and put the MSM where it belongs in it\u2019s grave. Besides covering the Hastert case Sibel has done a lot over the years if you can please help out and donate to Sibel Edmonds\u2019s www.newsbud.com project kick-starter . We are the future, the mainstream media is in it\u2019s death throes We Are Change the peoples funded media.\\n \\n\u201c\\nThe post WIKILEAKS: Emails Discuss Disgraced House Speaker Pedophile Dennis Hastert appeared first on We Are Change .\\n'"}, "time": 1742563473.4626591}
