Liberals infuriated; people chanting \"lock her up, lock her up [...]\" By Shepard Ambellas - November 9, 2016 ( INTELLIHUB ) \u2014 Early Wednesday morning Donald J. Trump accepted the Presidency of the United States like a true gentlemen, even thanking Hillary Clinton for her long-winded service to the country. \\n\u201cNow it\u2019s time for America to bind the wounds of division. [\u2026] It is time for us to come together as one united people.,\u201d Trump said. \\nTrump also reached out to those who chose not to support him in the past for their \u201cguidance and help\u201d to make America great again. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds and beliefs who want and expect our government to serve the people, and serve the people it will.\u201d \\n[\u2026] \\n\u201cWorking together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. I\u2019ve spent my entire life and business looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world. That is now what I want to do for our country,\u201d Trump said. \\n\u201cWe must reclaim our country\u2019s destiny and dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. We\u2019re going to dream of things for our country and beautiful things and successful things once again.\u201d \\nAt a victory party Trump supporters could be heard chanting \u201clock her up, lock her up [\u2026],\u201d Tom Llamas told ABC News, pointing out that Hillary Clinton\u2019s problems may not be over just yet. Not to mention how such rhetoric infuriated liberals nationwide. Chants of \u201cLOCK HER UP!\u201d at Trump party raise the necessary Q: Will Trump appoint a special prosecutor to take on Clinton, as promised? \\n\u2014 McKay Coppins (@mckaycoppins) November 9, 2016 \\nAs the night went on most mainstream figureheads and pundits went into panic mode as the results started to flip, showing overwhelming favor of Trump. They just couldn\u2019t figure out how or why Mr. Trump won. It\u2019s as if they actually believed their masters fake polls that they were airing the entire race. \\nLet me also mention that in many documented cases, people who voted \u2018all Republican\u2019 across the board had issues at the polls with the machines actually switching their votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton. Interestingly enough, despite the fact that a number of Soros deployed voting machines were likely rigged, Trump still won with some lead. \\n\u2014 TheAngryOne (@The_AngryGuy) November 8, 2016 \\nIt makes you wonder what the actual numbers were. In fact they probably were consistent with many Intellihub polls which have shown Trump vs. Clinton at an 60/40 to and 80/20 split, like the following poll taken on Election Day which shows Trump at 62% over Hillary\u2019s 33. \\nWe are in the midnight hour #ElectionDay , who will win \\n\u2014 Shepard Ambellas (@ShepardAmbellas) November 8, 2016 \\nIt was also noted by an analyst friend of mine that the Hillary campaign likely was devastated by what they thought was going to be a guaranteed victory and that we will likely see some corrupt politicians flee Washington D.C., like \u2018rats in the streets.\u2019 \\nThen we have to contend with the fact that Trump does not take office until Jan. 20, 2017, which may give the rats in D.C. enough time to conduct a counter strike on the Trump campaign. Will Obama go quietly into the night? \\nThe short and simple answer is: no, he will not. At minimum we can expect more executive orders and the pardoning of connected individuals on his way out. Not to mention that Obama likely has a trick up his sleeve. \\nThere is always a \u2018Plan B,\u2019 which is essentially orchestrated chaos which would allow Obama to then suspend Trump\u2019s inauguration. In fact, all that Obama needs to make it happen, legally, through executive order, would be for a crisis of some type to occur in between now and the inauguration \u2014 it\u2019s that simple. \\nEven an \u2018act of God,\u2019 such as a \u2018 devastating space weather event \u2018 could trigger such action and may. \\nWe can also expect pockets of unrest, especially in major cities. \\nThe bottom line is: the elites do not want to loose their power and are not going to wait another four years to regain it. \\n#RemainVigilant \\n#MAGA Shepard Ambellas is an opinion journalist, filmmaker , radio talk show host and the founder and editor-in-chief of Intellihub News & Politics.
