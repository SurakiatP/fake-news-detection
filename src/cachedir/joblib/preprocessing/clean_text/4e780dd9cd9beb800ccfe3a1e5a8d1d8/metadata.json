[The   cast, including Matthew McConaughey, Hailee Steinfeld, Felicity Jones, and Taraji P. Henson, all trade verses on the disco hit, with some   their own lines.  While Donald Trump\u2019s name is never mentioned, the video is apparently intended to serve as a rallying cry for those still grieving Trump\u2019s election.  Directed by W magazine editor Lynn Hirschberg, the video also features vocals from Matthew McConaughey, Michael Shannon, Andrew Garfield, Chris Pine, and Naomi Harris. The   \u201cI Will Survive\u201d video is the latest of its kind. Last week, Jerry Seinfeld, Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Jordan, and Leonardo DiCaprio and many other celebrities starred in an emotional \u201cYes We Can\u201d farewell tribute video for President Barack Obama. And of course, during the 2016 presidential race, numerous celebrities contributed to political PSAs aimed at discouraging voters from voting for Donald Trump. Perhaps the most   of these was director Joss Whedon\u2019s \u201cImportant\u201d video, which featured Avengers stars Robert Downey Jr. Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo and Don Cheadle reminding Americans to vote on Election Day.
