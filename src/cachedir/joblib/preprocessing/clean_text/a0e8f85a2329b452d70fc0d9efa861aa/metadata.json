Partial transcript as follows: TODD: One of the in in the order is to include green card holders and that is something that there has been a report that the Department of Homeland Security recommended it not include green card holders. Why did the White House choose to overrule the Department of Homeland Security on that one. PRIEBUS: We didn\u2019t overrule the Department of Homeland Security. As far as green card holders moving forward, it didn\u2019t affect them. If you\u2019re coming in and out identified by the Obama administration as the seven most dangerous in the world in regard to harboring terror firsts and affirmed by congress multiple times then you\u2019re going to be subjected temporarily with more questioning until a better program is put in place over the next several months. this is something that 75% 80% of Americans out there agree with. We don\u2019t want people that are traveling back and forth to one of these seven countries that harbor terrorists to be traveling freely back and forth between the United States and those countries. TODD:  You did say something at the beginning of your answer and it seemed like an aside. This order does not impact any green card holders from these seven countries. PRIEBUS: Of course, it does. if you\u2019re traveling back and forth you\u2019ll be subjected to further screening. Of course. TODD: Are you going to do that to American citizens as well that travel in and out of these seven countries? PRIEBUS: I would suspect it if you\u2019re an American citizen traveling back and forth to Libya you\u2019re likely to be subjected to further questioning when you come to an airport. TODD: Why are you confident that\u2019s constitutional and I\u2019ll ask it this way because green card holders they go through extreme vetting to get the green card, and number two, when they get the green card they\u2019re entitled to all of the protections that citizens do. PRIEBUS: I\u2019m not suggesting that. TODD: I understand that. are you, by having to put an extra hurdle for a green card holder to get into the country how are you confident that doesn\u2019t violate their rights and doesn\u2019t end up making the order unconstitutional. PRIEBUS: First of all, it\u2019s not affecting green card holders. TODD: you keep saying  \u2014   you said it does  \u2014   PRIEBUS: If you would just slow down for a second and listen I could answer your question. &gt, TODD I understand that, but you\u2019ve twice confused me so I\u2019m trying to understand the clarity. PRIEBUS:  It\u2019s because you don\u2019t stop talking, Chuck. I love you, but let me answer the question. If you\u2019re a person  \u2014   this isn\u2019t in regard to the executive order, the executive order doesn\u2019t affect green card holders moving forward. I said that. What I\u2019m suggesting is customs and border patrol, I would suspect within their discretion hey have a person traveling back and forth to Libya or Somalia or Yemen I would suspect within their discretion they might ask a few more questions at JFK or some other airport when someone is coming back and forth within their discretionary authority as a customs and border patrol agent and what I\u2019m saying is that I would suspect that most would agree that that would be a good thing to do. What I\u2019m not suggesting to you that that is in the order moving forward. I\u2019m suggesting that within the discretion of the CBP that those questions would likely be asked.
