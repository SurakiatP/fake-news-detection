Paul set out his analysis in an extensive interview with host Peter Lavelle at RT. Paul started off the interview saying that he is keeping his \u201cfingers crossed\u201d regarding Trump\u2019s potential foreign policy actions. Paul says he views favorably Trump\u2019s comments in the presidential election about \u201cbeing less confrontational with Russia\u201d and criticizing some of the US wars in the Middle East. Paul, though, notes that Trump has presented \u201cvague\u201d foreign policy positions overall. Paul also comments that a good indication of how Trump will act on foreign policy issues will be provided by looking at who Trump appoints to positions in the executive branch and from whom Trump receives advice. Regarding Trump\u2019s foreign policy advisors and potential appointees, Paul expresses in the interview reason for concern. Paul states: \u201cUnfortunately, there have been several neoconservatives that are getting closer to Trump, and, if he gets his advice from them, then I don\u2019t think that is a good sign.\u201d Even if Trump wants to pursue a significantly more noninterventionist course than his recent predecessors in the presidency, Paul warns that the entrenched \u201cdeep state\u201d that favors foreign intervention and war, special interests that have \u201csinister motivation for these wars,\u201d and media propaganda that \u201cbuilds up the war fever\u201d can provide significant headwinds against Trump pursuing such an objective.
