[The last time the United States had a Catholic as First Lady was during the presidency of John F. Kennedy, whose wife Jackie Kennedy \u2014  like him \u2014  was a Roman Catholic. When Melania moves into the White House together with their son Barron this summer, she will become the first Catholic occupant of the White House since the Kennedy era.  On meeting the Pope Wednesday, Melania asked him to bless her rosary and later visited the Bambin Ges\u00f9 (Baby Jesus) pediatric hospital, where she met with young patients and their families, prayed in a chapel and laid flowers at the feet of a statue of the Virgin Mary.  Later that day, the First Lady\u2019s spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham confirmed to DailMail. com that Melania is a practicing Catholic. Having grown up in Slovenia, then part of the Communist and officially atheist Soviet bloc, it is unclear when Melania was baptized a Catholic. President Trump is a   Presbyterian, and he and Melania were married in a Palm Beach Florida Episcopal church. Melania\u2019s father was a nominal member of the Communist Party in order to be able to obtain employment. In February, Melania kicked off a presidential rally in Melbourne, Florida, by reciting the Lord\u2019s Prayer, beginning with the typical Catholic invocation \u201cLet us pray. \u201d The first lady later tweeted about the development with the hashtags \u201c#Blessings\u201d and \u201c#Faith. \u201d In another tweet, she sent \u201cblessings to all\u201d after her audience with the pontiff, which she described as an \u201chonor\u201d she will never forget. Today\u2019s visit with His Holiness Pope Francis @Pontifex is one I\u2019ll never forget. I was humbled by the honor. Blessings to all. pic. twitter.   \u2014   Melania Trump (@FLOTUS) May 24, 2017,  Mrs. Trump told Pope Francis at the Vatican that she was looking forward to going to the hospital \u201cfor the bambinos,\u201d a visit she later described as \u201cvery moving. \u201d \u201cTo spend time speaking to and coloring with children who have such a positive spirit despite illness was an amazing gift,\u201d she said. \u201cThe time I spent with the little ones in the Intensive Care Unit is something I will never forget, and I will pray for each of them daily,\u201d she said.
