Trump, of course, isn\u2019t alone in his degenerate thinking, but honestly, he\u2019s got the biggest stage to preach it from. \\nAnd he\u2019s only ramped that rhetoric up as the polls have shown his campaign going downhill. It\u2019s not enough to make me comfortable \u2014 I hope that American liberals get out and vote against him \u2014 but it\u2019s enough to make Trump feel the burn. His claims of voter fraud are little more than whining, but that doesn\u2019t stop people from believing claims like the one he made at a Colorado rally on Saturday, where he said election officials would throw away mail-in ballots if they don\u2019t \u201clike\u201d them. \u201cReal Problem\u201d \\nHowever, it\u2019s worth analyzing his previous claims all the same. Trump claimed that an International Cabal of Bankers is conspiring with Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim to \u201crig\u201d the American election and bring a permanent end to the United States . If this sounds completely insane to you, that\u2019s because it is. \\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting the things that the average American is going to miss in that statement. \\nFor instance, \u201cinternational cabal of bankers\u201d is pretty transparent talk for \u201cJews.\u201d One of the major conspiracy theories of these Antisemitic loons is the International Jewish banker conspiracy \u2014 it\u2019s so important that it has its own fiction novel devoted to it (it was one of Henry Ford\u2019s favorite books): Protocols of the Elders of Zion . In fact, when I typed \u201ccabal of international bankers\u201d in Google, it helpfully suggested \u201celders of zion\u201d as a related search. Given his voter base consists of white nationalists, the KKK, neo-Nazis, and racists in general, it shouldn\u2019t surprise you to learn he might as well be quoting from the seminal work of Antisemitism. \\nAnd if you think I\u2019m reading too much into this, let me remind you that his foreign policy advisor allegedly said that the Nazi ovens were \u201ctoo small\u201d to kill six million Jewish people . His alt-right supporters have savaged Jewish reporter simply for being Jewish . Antisemitism swirls around the man. \\nTrump\u2019s latest made up accusations aren\u2019t couched in the same extremely transparent and Antisemitic rhetoric that his usual accusations are. Instead, they\u2019re the sort of straightforward nonsense that we\u2019ve come to expect from Agent Orange when he attempts to speak a mind he doesn\u2019t have. \\nWhile speaking before a Colorado rally on Saturday, Trump told the audience that election officials are going to \u201cthrow out\u201d mail-in ballots they disagree with, saying: \\n\u201cI have real problems with ballots being sent. People say, oh, here\u2019s a ballot, bing. Here\u2019s another ballot, throw it away. Oh, here\u2019s one I like, we\u2019ll keep that one.\u201d Trump talks voter fraud in Colorado; says he has a \"real problem\" with mail in ballots.

These walking poster children for Dunning-Kruger have no idea what they\u2019re doing; they\u2019re armed, emotionally charged, racist, clueless, and out to protect \u201ctheir country\u201d\u2014 which doesn\u2019t include people like me. \\nPerhaps they should all wear brown shirts, too. That way, police know who to remove once they\u2019ve cast their vote. \\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to have some pretty good supervision out there,\u201d he warned. \\nSure you are. If by \u201csupervision\u201d you mean people carrying out voter intimidation. Because that\u2019s exactly what\u2019ll happen. \\nPhoto by Spencer Platt/Getty Images Share this Article!'"}, "time": 1742563498.9530125}
