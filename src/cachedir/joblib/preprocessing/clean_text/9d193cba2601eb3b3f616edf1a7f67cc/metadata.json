Loving toward his wife, or coldly dismissive? That the man left no surviving letters or autobiographical testimony has hardly helped, ensuring that accounts of his life have often relied on \u201cone halfpenny worth of fact to an intolerable deal of supposition,\u201d as the scholar C. W.   once lamented. Only a few scraps of new material relating to Shakespeare in his lifetime have surfaced over the past century. But now, a researcher has uncovered nearly a dozen previously unknown records that shed clearer light on another   side of the man: the social climber. The documents, discovered by Heather Wolfe, the curator of manuscripts at the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, relate to a coat of arms that was granted to Shakespeare\u2019s father in 1596, attesting to his and his son\u2019s status as gentlemen. Considered with previously known records, Ms. Wolfe argues, the documents suggest both how deeply invested Shakespeare was in gaining that recognition  \u2014   a rarity for a man from the theater  \u2014   and how directly he may have been drawn into colorful bureaucratic infighting that threatened to strip it away. The new evidence \u201creally helps us get a little bit closer to the man himself,\u201d Ms. Wolfe said. \u201cIt shows him shaping himself and building his reputation in a very intentional way. \u201d James Shapiro, a Shakespeare scholar at Columbia University who has seen Ms. Wolfe\u2019s research, said her discoveries help illuminate what mattered to Shakespeare. \u201cIt\u2019s all about trying to figure out, what was he like?\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. \u201cAnytime we can substitute something solid for speculation, that\u2019s significant. \u201d The new documents, Mr. Shapiro added, also come with a nice bonus: they clearly refute skeptics who continue to argue  \u2014   to the deep exasperation of most scholars  \u2014   that William Shakespeare of    was not actually the author of the works attributed to him. \u201cIt\u2019s always been clear that Shakespeare of Stratford and \u2018Shakespeare the player\u2019 were one and the same,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. \u201cBut if you hold the documents Heather has discovered together, that is the smoking gun. \u201d Ms. Wolfe\u2019s discoveries began in the archives of the College of Arms in London, home to 10 heralds who are still charged with researching and granting coats of arms  \u2014   arcane territory where many literary scholars might fear to tread. \u201cLooking through the minutiae of the College of Arms is, even for Shakespeare scholars, almost unbearable,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. \u201cWe really owe Heather a debt of gratitude for wading in. \u201d Ms. Wolfe said she began wondering if there wasn\u2019t fresh material to find there when she looked through a book edited by Nigel Ramsay, a historian at University College London, with whom she curated an exhibition on heraldry at the Folger in 2014. On one page, she was startled by something she had never seen before: a sketch of the arms with the words \u201cShakespeare the player,\u201d or actor, dated to around 1600. A similar image with the same text  \u2014   a copy dating from around 1700  \u2014   has long been known to Shakespeare scholars (as well as to authorship skeptics, who generally dismiss as unreliable any evidence dated after 1616, the year of Shakespeare\u2019s death). But this earlier one, from the College of Arms, seemed to have gone unremarked on. Ms. Wolfe started digging there and in other archives, and so far has gathered a dozen unknown or forgotten depictions of the arms in heraldic reference works called alphabets and ordinaries. \u201cI just started finding them everywhere,\u201d she said. Scholars have long known that Shakespeare\u2019s father, John, a businessman and justice of the peace in Stratford, had first made inquiries about a coat of arms around 1575. They have speculated that it was William who renewed the effort in 1596, on his father\u2019s behalf. The new depictions Ms. Wolfe has gathered are all from the 17th century. More than half associate the arms with \u201cShakespeare the player,\u201d or with William, not John. This material not only proves \u201cthat Shakespeare was Shakespeare,\u201d as Ms. Wolfe wryly put it. It also, she argues, underlines the degree to which contemporaries saw the coat of arms as, in effect, being for William. \u201cIt makes it abundantly clear that while Shakespeare was obtaining the arms on behalf of his father, it was really for his own status,\u201d she said. Mr. Shapiro said he agreed. \u201cAll evidence suggests this was not about the father,\u201d he said, \u201cbut about how Shakespeare wanted to be seen. \u201d Alan H. Nelson, a retired professor at University of California, Berkeley, who has contributed to Shakespeare Documented, an online project curated by Ms. Wolfe, said he also found her case persuasive. The new material, he added, \u201chelps to confirm everything we know about the arc of Shakespeare\u2019s career and the way he understood himself in the context of his society,\u201d he said. But not all of Shakespeare\u2019s contemporaries took his newly minted status at face value. Ben Jonson mocked his arms in his 1598 play \u201cEvery Man Out of His Humour,\u201d in which a country bumpkin is advised to purchase arms with the motto \u201cNot without mustard,\u201d a dig at Shakespeare\u2019s motto \u201cNot without right. \u201d (Shakespeare\u2019s arms were yellow.) A more threatening attack came in 1602 from Ralph Brooke, a herald in the College of Arms who had long been at war with his archrival, William Dethick, who held the title Garter King of Arms. (At one point, Brooke reportedly warned Dethick, himself a notoriously violent man, that the Star Chamber would punish him by cutting off his ears.) That year, Brooke, drew up for submission to the queen a list of 23 \u201cmean persons\u201d who had wrongfully been granted arms by Dethick, including \u201cShakespeare the player,\u201d as Brooke put it disparagingly. (Shakespeare was not the only one given a lowly job description: a man derided by Brooke as a mere \u201cbookbinder,\u201d Ms. Wolfe noted, was actually master of the Stationers\u2019 Company, the prestigious body that regulated the publishing industry.) Among Dethick\u2019s records, Ms. Wolfe found letters from outraged people whose arms had come under attack, as well as notes indicating that some had withdrawn their claims. While no record of Shakespeare\u2019s response survives, Ms. Wolfe argues that the others\u2019 intense reactions suggest that he must have known about the controversy, and likely took action to defend his status. Some whose letters survive lived outside London, she noted. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t just approach Dethick, as Shakespeare could have. \u201d Shakespeare may have held onto his arms, but the glory didn\u2019t last. His son, Hamnet, had died in 1596. His last direct descendant, a granddaughter named Elizabeth Barnard, died in 1670. Ms. Wolfe said that a colleague at the Folger recently pointed out something she has not seen any scholar discuss: the wax seal on Elizabeth\u2019s last will shows a fragment of the Shakespeare arms, just barely visible. \u201cShe\u2019s dying, she\u2019s the last in the direct line, and the arms have faded,\u201d Ms. Wolfe said. \u201cIt just seems touchingly symbolic. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563325.5075092}
