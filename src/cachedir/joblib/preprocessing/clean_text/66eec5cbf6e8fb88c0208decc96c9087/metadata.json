But it is precisely because of my familiarity with academia that I beseech the college bound and their enablers\u2014I mean their supporters\u2014to revisit their plans. \\nWhether one regards a post-secondary institution as a means to either a remunerative profession or a genuine education, the tragic fact of the matter is that the contemporary academic world is about as politicized a cultural institution as any. More specifically, it is a bastion of Political Correctness, a decidedly leftist ideology that tolerates no competition. \\nFor the last 11 years, Professor Duke Pesta, who is currently an associate professor of English at the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh, has taught literature at a range of colleges. At the outset of each semester, he would quiz his students on their knowledge of American and Western history. What he found is that the \u201coverwhelming\u201d number of them believed that slavery\u2014an institution, mind you, that is as old as humanity itself, was practiced in virtually every society the planet over, and that lasted only some 87 years in the United States\u2014 was an exclusively American phenomenon . \\n\u201cMost of my students could not tell me anything meaningful about slavery outside of America,\u201d Pesta told The College Fix. His students \u201care convinced that slavery was an American problem that more or less ended with the Civil War and they are very fuzzy about slavery prior to the Colonial era.\u201d \\n\u201cTheir entire education about slavery,\u201d he adds, \u201cwas confined to America.\u201d \\nYet it isn\u2019t just students who display an astonishing ignorance of slavery. Over at Boston University, Saida Grundy , an Assistant Professor of sociology and African-American Studies, tweeted that slavery is \u201ca white people\u2026thing.\u201d \\nGrundy didn\u2019t stop there. She asks: \u201cis white people\u2019s new deflection from dealing with slavery that \u2018all races have had slaves\u2019 thing? is this the new \u2018#AllLivesMatter\u2019?\u201d \\nProfessor Grundy added other enlightening tweets: \\n\u201cfor the record, NO race outside of Europeans had a system that made slavery a *personhood* instead of temporary condition; \\n\u201cthere is also no race except Europeans who kidnapped and transported human beings in order to enslave them and their offspring for life; \\n\u201cbefore Europeans invented it as such, slavery was not a condition that was de facto inherited from parent to child.\u201d \\nIn case white folks couldn\u2019t follow the thrust of her rant, Grundy offers a summation of her sophisticated position: \\n\u201cin other words, deal with your white sh*t, white people. slavery is a *YALL* thing.\u201d \\nIn addition to assigning blame for slavery solely to white Europeans, Grundy claimed that \u201cwhite masculinity\u201d is \u201cTHE problem for america\u2019s colleges.\u201d \\nOver at the University of Pittsburgh, students who were distributing pro-Donald Trump materials were harassed and attacked . The Trump supporters were accused of backing a \u201cracist\u201d candidate who espouses \u201chate speech.\u201d They were greeted by chants of \u201cf**k the white male patriarchy\u201d and, eventually, physical aggression. \\nOne of the victims said that \u201cmy campus shouldn\u2019t be a place where my friends and I are fearful for having opposing opinions.\u201d \\nThese students were accosted by other students. Students elsewhere, however, have had professors with which to contend. \\nAt the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), a political science professor, Michael Chwe, wrote in a blog post for Princeton University Press that \u201cthe danger to democracy itself\u201d is posed by \u201cTrump supporters[.]\u201d This \u201cdanger\u201d is \u201creal and must be confronted.\u201d Chwe maintains that Trump and his supporters are \u201cthe greatest danger to democracy since World War II, even perhaps since the Civil War[.]\u201d \\nChwe thinks that had \u201cwe\u201d done \u201ca better and earlier job with confronting, as opposed to accommodating, white and male privilege\u2026we might not have reached this situation [the Trump phenomenon].\u201d \u201cWe\u201d must set our sights on \u201ccombatting\u201d these forms of \u201cprivilege\u201d now, though, if we hope to divert \u201cdemocracy away from self-destruction.\u201d \\nAnd it isn\u2019t just faculty in the humanities and liberal arts that can\u2019t resist injecting their politics into the classroom. A math professor at Mount Holyoke College, an all-female school, was recently captured on video launching into an anti-Trump/pro-Clinton tirade in class. While he never referred to either candidate by name, Peter Rosnick\u2019s choice for president was plain. This election, Rosnick said, is the \u201cscariest\u201d that he\u2019s ever witnessed. He told his students that they should \u201cvote for someone who thinks women are full and capable and responsible and intelligent beings who should not be the object of, um, should not be objectified.\u201d \\nRosnick also prescribed his students to vote \u201cfor whoever you want, but vote for somebody who respects the fact that this is a country built on immigrants\u2014that this is a country that couldn\u2019t, that wouldn\u2019t be what it is if it wasn\u2019t for bringing immigrants into our nation and respecting them and respecting what they bring to our country.\u201d \\nAt least one of Rosnick\u2019s students was less than enthused over his proselytizing efforts. Speaking on condition of anonymity, this student told The College Fix that she found \u201cit highly inappropriate for a math teacher to use my class time to try to tell me who to vote for.\u201d \\nIndeed. \\nBut this, unfortunately, is hardly an anomaly in 2016. Thus, parents should think hard before divesting themselves of tens and tens of thousands of dollars so that their children can become targets of political indoctrination.
