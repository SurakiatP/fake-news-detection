We\u2019re providing unlimited access to all New York Times digital platforms through Wednesday.  Here\u2019s what you need to know: \u2022 It\u2019s Election Day! Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump made their closing arguments in states that both view as   to be victorious today. Now it\u2019s up to the voters. Despite the ugliness of the campaign, there are signs that Americans are expressing themselves at the ballot box in large numbers. Turnout in states that allow early voting was high, and many voters told The Times that they were eager for the election to end. Here\u2019s what time polls close across the country (and when we might know who won). The first big wave is at 8 p. m. Eastern. And last, our 360 video series takes a peek inside a voting booth. \u2022 What to watch for today and tonight. Hispanic turnout is set to vastly exceed the turnout from four years ago, and early voting data indicates that Mrs. Clinton will benefit from the increase. But it\u2019s too soon to know if it will be decisive for her, our writer observes. He says the surge could be enough to overcome Mr. Trump\u2019s strength among white,   voters in Florida and Nevada. \u201cIf it does, it will almost certainly win her the election. \u201d We\u2019ll be tracking the results live after the polls close. Here are two basic paths for what might happen. \u2022 Other   story lines. We look at how the F. B. I. in the span of a week, reviewed thousands of emails and again concluded that Mrs. Clinton should not face charges related to her handling of classified information. And how might the election affect stocks? Swings over the course of the campaign suggest that the markets prefer one candidate to the other, our analysis shows. The news media is under intense pressure to avoid any mistakes in projections tonight. \u201cIf you don\u2019t get a good grade, 300 million people are going to know,\u201d one executive said. \u2022 International roundup. Heavy smog continues to choke New Delhi, where emergency measures are in place to improve air quality. The damage from sustained exposure to high pollution is equivalent to smoking more than two packs of cigarettes a day, experts say. Hong Kong is bracing for more street protests and tough questions about the independence of its courts after China barred two   politicians from taking their seats in the territory\u2019s legislature. And Australia won\u2019t be legalizing   marriage anytime soon. Parliament rejected a bill calling for a nonbinding public vote on the issue, despite polls showing around 70 percent of Australians want marriage equality. \u2022 North Dakota oil pipeline. Environmental groups protesting the Dakota Access pipeline near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation are targeting a new group: banks that have helped finance the project. \u2022 Rolling Stone and one of its writers were ordered by a federal jury to pay $3 million in damages to a University of Virginia administrator over a discredited article about a supposed gang rape at the university. \u2022 China\u2019s new cybersecurity law will give the authorities far greater control over the internet beginning next summer, raising concerns about freedom of speech and barriers to foreign business. \u2022 The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The Guardian, Gannett publications and others have announced plans to reorganize, reduce staff, eliminate sections or all of the above. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be happening at a worse moment in American public life,\u201d our media columnist writes, citing the threat of fake news proliferating on social media. \u2022 U. S. stocks surged on Monday. Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets. \u2022 Interview with a chess superstar. Sergey Karjakin of Russia became the world\u2019s youngest chess grandmaster at age 12. Now 26, he is about to challenge the reigning world champion, who is 25, in New York. \u201cI don\u2019t play chess for fun, it\u2019s my job,\u201d Mr. Karjakin said. \u201cAnd I happen to love my job very much. \u201d \u2022 New to read. Zadie Smith\u2019s latest work, \u201cSwing Time,\u201d explores the effects of cultural heritage and politics on identity. Our critic described the book this way: \u201cA novel that showcases its author\u2019s formidable talents in only half its pages, while bogging down the rest of the time in formulaic and predictable storytelling. \u201d \u2022 Tick, tock. If you have a few moments, take our quiz on time. Do you know what the scientific definition of a second is? Hint: It isn\u2019t the time it takes to say \u201cone Mississippi. \u201d \u2022 Recipe of the day. If you\u2019re looking for comfort food this election night, try this   lasagna. And since we\u2019re on the subject of cheese, read about a New York City sandwich that has set off a discussion about the cultural appropriation of food. Britons have been saying a lot of goodbyes in the past few months. They voted to leave the European Union. The prime minister resigned. The leading figures of the   Brexit campaign left the government. And through all this, the news media outside Britain found one expression that worked in multiple languages: \u201cEnglish leave. \u201d It\u2019s a play on \u201ctaking French leave,\u201d which the British use to mean departing abruptly  \u2014   supposedly a reference to the French manner of leaving a social function without saying goodbye. Such nationalist expressions abounded around the 19th century, when rival nations in a disunited Europe settled scores in wars, revolutions and slights. But the Germans also pick on the Poles for evaporating from parties, which the British call an \u201cIrish goodbye. \u201d (The German weekly \u201cDie Zeit\u201d even graphed the zingers and  .) Of course, the slaps don\u2019t end with departures. Germans can mention, though rarely, \u201cEnglish shopping\u201d  \u2014   that is, theft, as in the colonial past. And references to historic battles get drawn into the mix, too. So the French could say, depending on how Brexit works out, \u201cc\u2019est un vrai coup de Trafalgar,\u201d a true Trafalgar blow, reminiscent of their decisive defeat by the English in 1805.
