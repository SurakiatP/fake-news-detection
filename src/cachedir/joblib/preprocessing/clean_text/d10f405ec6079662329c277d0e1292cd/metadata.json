Nikki Hollis was invited to dinner by friends concerned she might be lonely and sad due to being single, when she would rather have been at home with some wine and not having to put up with their tedious married bullshit. Hollis, 32, said: \u201cI only went along to humour them, as I know it makes them feel good to patronise me a bit about being single, especially as they are all clearly seething with resentment towards their partners. \u201cBut it was a wasted night really, as for me there is no greater pleasure than spending the night in, getting pissed and not having to talk about middle class wank. \u201cSometimes I drink a bottle of Prosecco from one of those massive Sports Direct mugs using a straw, just because there\u2019s no one around to get funny about me not using a \u2018proper\u2019 glass. \u201cThen I\u2019ll watch seven episodes of Ramsay\u2019s Kitchen Nightmares in a row before nearly setting the house on fire making toast. \u201cWould I swap it for being tutted at and asked if I\u2019m coming to bed soon? No fucking chance.\u201d \\nShare:'"}, "time": 1742561749.151529}
