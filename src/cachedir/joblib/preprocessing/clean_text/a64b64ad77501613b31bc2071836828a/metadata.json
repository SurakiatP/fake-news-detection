She expected that her husband, Husham   and her two other sons would soon join her from Amman, Jordan, finally bringing the family together after a tumultuous decade of surviving the Iraq war, fleeing to Jordan and then searching for a permanent home. But on Friday, the family was dealt another blow, after President Trump approved a sweeping executive order on immigration that, among other things, blocked entry into the United States for 90 days for citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries including Iraq, where members of the family are citizens. Her husband and two sons in Jordan are for now locked out of the United States, and Ms. Obaidi cannot travel away, or risk being denied  . \u201cNow our family in the U. S. can\u2019t even come to visit us, nor can we visit them,\u201d Mr. Qadhi said on Saturday in Amman. \u201cWe just sit and watch like the rest of the world what is happening, and our fate is being decided for us, in front of our eyes. \u201d The family lived in Baghdad as American tanks, troops and missiles tore into the Iraqi capital in 2003. It stayed for several years, despite gunfire and bomb blasts outside its house and the kidnapping of several family members. The family helped American soldiers even though other Iraqis targeted it for doing so. One of the sons in Amman, Thabit   said he and his father had run a snack bar on an American base in Baghdad, serving candy and soft drinks to troops, and operated a   internet cafe, which required them to be vetted and approved to begin work. After Thabit   was kidnapped in 2006 by Qaeda terrorists and eventually released, he said, he reported details about the episode to American officials in the hope that they would be caught. And on his way home from the Baghdad base one day, he came upon four American troops injured along the road, and he said he had loaded them into his car and driven them to the Green Zone. \u201cAmerica has abandoned its responsibility to protect those who protected and cooperated with the Americans,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a decision solely based on my religious faith. It\u2019s discrimination solely on religious grounds. \u201d He added: \u201cThis is the wrong decision. Is it even constitutional?\u201d The family\u2019s home was along one of Baghdad\u2019s major highways, an entry point for American troops during the invasion. The family huddled in a windowless section of the home for 10 days, as bullets shattered windows and rockets blazed through the sky, until the United States took control of Baghdad. In the years after the invasion, the family remained in Iraq, even as unrest spread, militants took up arms and   tensions between Sunnis and Shiites flared up. In addition to Thabit   Ms. Obaidi\u2019s husband was also kidnapped, on two separate occasions. The family members recalled the lengths to which they went to get them freed, how they stuffed $60, 000 in Iraqi dinars into garbage bags and were instructed by cellphone to travel to a series of locations before dropping off the ransom. \u201cIt was like in the movies,\u201d Ms. Obaidi said in an interview this month. Fearing more attacks, the family left Iraq for Jordan. It joined many other Iraqi refugees, including extended family members. Ms. Obaidi and her husband used their savings to buy a home in Amman. Employment opportunities were scarce for Iraqis, leading three of her sons, starting in 2010, to venture to the United States to find work. When Ms. Obaidi later followed them, she hoped that her entire family could apply for asylum and unite in America. She made the trip despite a number of concerns. \u201cAt first, I felt afraid,\u201d she said. \u201cHow can I live in this country? It is a foreign country. It is very far from my culture. How will I be compatible with the community?\u201d To her surprise, Ms. Obaidi found New York to be unlike its gruff stereotypes. People smiled as she walked down the street. Men helped her haul heavy bags up stairs. Others offered her seats on the subway. \u201cEverybody in America is very nice,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are very polite, helpful people, nice people, always with a smile on their face. That is my experience. \u201d She has found additional support from the International Rescue Committee, a global humanitarian aid, relief and development nongovernmental organization based in New York. Founded in 1933, the organization is the newest organization supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, and the only one of the eight groups whose work extends beyond the New York area. It operates in 29 cities in the United States and in more than 40 countries. The organization was instrumental in helping Ms. Obaidi adjust to her new life and connecting her with a number of social services, including health insurance and food stamps. It helped her obtain a Social Security card, navigate New York\u2019s streets and understand its transportation system. The group also helped her study for her driver\u2019s license permit exam, among other services. \u201cI feel I am not lonely,\u201d she said. \u201cI have somebody. I have somebody to support me. \u201d She shares a home in the Astoria neighborhood in Queens with two of her sons, Saif   and Qaed  . Her third son, Tameem   and his wife, Melissa Forstrom, also live in the neighborhood. \u201cI have a nice life,\u201d Ms. Obaidi said. \u201cEven though my apartment is small, I feel happy in it. I like it. \u201d But it is a home with some notable, painful absences. \u201cI\u2019ve divided myself,\u201d Ms. Obaidi said. \u201cSome part is there in Jordan, and some parts   \u2026    \u201d She trailed off, overcome with emotion. In Amman, Thabit   her oldest son, lives with his wife and    son across the street from Ms. Obaidi\u2019s husband, Husham, and their youngest son, Omar  . They have been denied asylum in the United States. In October 2015, Husham   was sent a conditional acceptance letter for asylum in the United States. About a year later, he received a second letter, denying him resettlement. Omar   who works at Unicef to help provide water, sanitation and hygiene to Syrian refugees in Jordan, was also denied resettlement. \u201cWe have lived here as if we were waiting for something, as if everything was temporary, but now we no longer know what we are waiting for,\u201d Omar   said in his apartment in Amman. Thabit   who has traveled to New York several times to visit his family, has not received the same denial letters for resettlement in the United States. His tourist visa was renewed, but a week later, an officer at the American Embassy in Amman told him that his visa had been canceled, and his case for resettlement was denied. Whether they will ever get approval to move to the United States is even more uncertain now. Thabit   said that Mr. Trump\u2019s order was particularly painful and that he felt America was turning its back on Iraqis who had risked their lives to help soldiers during the war. \u201cAt the end we realized we were no longer welcome, neither from the Iraqis because we worked with the Americans, nor from the Americans because we were Iraqi,\u201d he said. Like many Iraqis, Thabit   is living in Jordan on a conditional basis. He must renew his permission every year, and it is dependent on the family\u2019s financial means. \u201cNothing is guaranteed in business,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, my trade company here is successful, but if one day the business fails, then what will happen? Where do I go?\u201d In the United States, his siblings, even with employment and legal immigration status, live in a similar state of unsteadiness and concern. For three years, Tameem  \u2019s only proof of his legal status was an   record known as an   form, a document without a photo of him and only his name and identification numbers. It has hindered his attempts to travel even within the United States. Visas for Saif  \u2019s wife and children were approved recently after a wait of more than two years. They were booked on a plane expected to arrive Feb. 7, but Friday\u2019s executive order by Mr. Trump has dashed those plans. \u201cThe kids, they grow up far from their father,\u201d Saif   said. \u201cAll of a sudden, I told them \u2018I\u2019m sorry, something changed. I may not be able to see you soon. \u2019\u201d He and his wife are distraught by the development, which leaves them in a precarious position. In anticipation of the move, their children were taken out of their private school and the lease on their apartment in Amman is to expire on Feb. 1. \u201cI\u2019m watching the news every second,\u201d Mr. Qadhi said. Ms. Obaidi\u2019s children have been able to acclimate to their new surroundings and establish a rhythm in their lives. Tameem   owns a cellphone store in the East Village in Manhattan, Qaed   works as an information technology manager, and Saif   is an Uber driver. Ms. Obaidi stays busy by volunteering at the Masjid Dar   mosque. The family gathers as often as work schedules and other responsibilities allow, most often on Sundays, when Ms. Obaidi prepares a large meal. They all await the day when more chairs can be placed around the table. Halfway across the world, the other half of the family shares that sentiment. Omar   said he missed his brothers, but especially his mother. \u201cIt just feels weird that we are now split, and the future looks grim,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are travelers on a journey with no destination, and my family is so far away. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562124.860046}
