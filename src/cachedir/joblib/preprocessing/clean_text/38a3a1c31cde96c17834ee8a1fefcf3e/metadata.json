[CNN reports that cases of a parasitic   infection linked to pools in the United States have doubled between 2014 and 2016 according to the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report issued by the CDC. Michele Hlavsa, chief of the CDC\u2019s Healthy Swimming Program, stated in an email, \u201cCryptosporidium is a germ that can make people sick with diarrhea for up to three weeks. \u201d The parasite can be spread by the feces of an infected person.  The CDC received reports of as many as 32 outbreaks linked to swimming pools and water playgrounds in 2016. In comparison, there were only 16 reports in 2014. In Ohio, nearly 2000 people became sick due to being infected by cryptosporidium or \u201ccrypto. \u201d Symptoms of the infection include watery diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea, and vomiting. \u201cParents can encourage their children not to swallow the water when swimming,\u201d Hlavsa said, warning that swallowing a single mouthful of contaminated water can lead to illness. \u201cAlso, take kids on bathroom breaks every hour, and check diapers in a   area and not right next to the pool,\u201d Hlavsa explained. \u201cWe all share the water we swim in, but we don\u2019t want to share germs, pee or poop. \u201d The crypto infection is a major contributor to diarrheal illnesses in toddlers and infants in countries across Africa and Asia. It can also lead to poor nutrition which can be dangerous for young children. \u201cCrypto is extremely hard to kill with normal levels of chlorine, which is why it\u2019s important to keep Crypto out of pools in the first place,\u201d Hlavsa wrote. \u201cWe can all help do this by not swimming or letting our kids swim if sick with diarrhea. \u201d \u201cMost people who have healthy immune systems will recover from Crypto without treatment,\u201d Hlavsa stated, but she noted that individuals afflicted with diarrhea for more than three days should contact their doctor.
