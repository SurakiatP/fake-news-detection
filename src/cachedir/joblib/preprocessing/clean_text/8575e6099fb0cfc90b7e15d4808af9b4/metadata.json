If you have children, have them avert their eyes so they aren\u2019t forever scarred by the images of Clinton that decorate this person\u2019s yard. \\nThis house in Bellmore!!! \\nPosted by Brian Mc Kibbin on Thursday, October 20, 2016 \\nThe video of the house, posted on Facebook by Brian McKibbin, has gone viral, garnering over 2.5 million views in less than a week.

In any case, it really is an awesome display that works perfectly for both Halloween and the upcoming election. \\nWhile this house might be scary, the real nightmare would be Clinton actually being elected. That\u2019s why you need to get out and vote. If your state has early voting, go vote right away. \\nWe can laugh about this house\u2019s anti-Hillary display all we want, but if she wins on Nov. 8, we won\u2019t be laughing anymore.
