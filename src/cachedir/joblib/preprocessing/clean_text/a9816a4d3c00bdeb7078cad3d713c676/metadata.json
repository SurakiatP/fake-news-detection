He came to the US as a boy after President George H.W. Bush\u2019s call to the Shia to revolt against Saddam in the aftermath of Desert Storm, which was ruthlessly suppressed by Saddam as Bush and company did nothing.\\nAs an Iraqi-American in uniform, he served as an interpreter attached to the 101st Airborne in Iraq in 2004, if memory serves\u2013dangerous times indeed for US troops in Iraq.\\nHe wrote to me, rightly outraged, after Ben Carson made his anti-Muslim comments back in September of 2015 during the presidential primary season. It made him so sad, so angry, as a US Air Force veteran and as a Muslim-American to hear such ignorance, such bias, such Islamophobia. And it made me angry as well.\\n\\nSo many Muslim-Americans have served this country with distinction, troops like Navy veteran Nate Terani, who has written an eloquent article at TomDispatch.com on the prejudice he faced as an Iranian-American. Terani is doing his best to fight a new enemy, Islamophobia, the irrational fear of Islam fed by the unhinged rhetoric of candidates like Ben Carson and Donald Trump.\\nHere is how Terani puts it in his article :\\nIn Iran, theocratic fundamentalists sowed division and hatred of outsiders\u2013of Westerners, Christians, and other religious minorities. Here in America, the right wing seems to have stolen passages directly from their playbook as it spreads hatred of immigrants, particularly Muslim ones. This form of nationalistic bigotry\u2013Islamophobia\u2013threatens the heart of our nation. When I chose to serve in the military, I did so to protect what I viewed as our sacred foundational values of liberty, equality, and democracy. Now, 20 years later, I\u2019ve joined forces with fellow veterans to again fight for those sacred values, this time right here at home. \\nAs America builds walls and weapons and wages war all over the globe, as our leaders look outward for enemies, we\u2019re forgetting the enemy within America, the enemy that is a much more serious threat to our national security. That enemy, which exists right here in America\u2019s heartland, is ignorance, hatred, fear, aggression, compounded by a cowardly desire to \u201cget even\u201d and to \u201cmake America great again\u201d by ostracizing other Americans who are considered \u201cdifferent\u201d and \u201cuntrustworthy.\u201d\\nBut spreading fear and bigotry is not a way to national security; it\u2019s a way to national insanity. Islamophobia, like all other irrational fears, must be fought and defeated.\\nWilliam J. Astore is a retired lieutenant colonel (USAF).
