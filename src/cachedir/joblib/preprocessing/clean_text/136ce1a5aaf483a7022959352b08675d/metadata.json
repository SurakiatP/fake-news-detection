In June 2011, the Bureau and the Russian Ministry of Defense signed a state contract for the Sarmat\u2019s development. The prospective strategic missile system is being developed in order to assuredly and effectively fulfil objectives of nuclear deterrent by Russia\u2019s strategic forces.\u201d \\nAnd now today, Putin explains: *PUTIN: INTERMEDIATE NUCLEAR FORCES TREATY SHOULD BE OBSERVED *PUTIN: RUSSIA, U.S. MUST BREAK VICIOUS CIRCLE OF CONFRONTATION *PUTIN: RUSSIA HAS TO DEVELOP ITS NUCLEAR ATTACK SYSTEMS *PUTIN: U.S. PUSHED RUSSIA TO ARMS RACE IN NUCLEAR SPHERE \\nPerhaps even more worrying are the comments from Obama administration officials declaration that war with Russia was all but inevitable (via AntiWar\u2019s Jason Ditz) , \\n\u201cWith some Obama Administration officials openly advocating starting a war with Russia over Syria, it is noteworthy that a lot of top Pentagon officials are treating the conflict as all but inevitable. Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Milley hyped Russian modernization efforts, but declared that they \u2018 will lose to the American Army. \u2018 \\n\u201cRussian officials have been cognizant of the possibility, insisting that Russia \u2018can now fight a conventional war in Europe,\u2019 comments which Gen. Milley dismissed as \u2018bluster, hubris, bravado.\u2019 and insisting that war with other nation-states \u2018is almost guaranteed.\u2019 \\n\u201cJoint Chiefs chairman Gen. Joe Dunford also complained about recent modernization efforts within the Russian military, claiming that they are threatening American interests with their capabilities, while Deputy Defense Secretary Bob Work referred to them as America\u2019s \u2018competitor.\u2019 \\n\u201cOf course, the United States spends many, many times what Russia does on its military, but the fact that Russia has a proper military capable of defending the nation at all puts it in a total different category from most of America\u2019s recent wars, and Russia\u2019s massive nuclear arsenal makes it clear this is one war which, if the US launches it, they won\u2019t be able to win outright.\u201d \\nAs ZeroHedge noted previously, by contrast the US strategic deterrent still relies on missile systems such as the ground-based Minuteman III and the sea launched Trident II, which have their origins in the 1960s and early 1970s. With the Sarmat missile, which is supposed to enter service in 2018, the Russians will add another powerful modern advanced system to their strategic armory.  '"}, "time": 1742562640.229637}
