NEWS November 8, 2016 Vol 52 Issue 44 \u00b7 News \u00b7 Politics \u00b7 Election 2016 \\nNEW YORK\u2014Marking the joyous occasion with singing, dancing, and a chorus of ecstatic cheers, an estimated 2 million citizens gathered beneath the Times Square countdown clock Tuesday night to celebrate the end of the 2016 election season, sources reported. \\nThe crowd of revelers\u2014many of whom had arrived in the early morning to stake out prime viewing locations\u2014reportedly swelled in volume throughout the night, spilling over into nearby streets as many popped bottles of champagne, embraced loved ones, and finally joined together in a boisterous countdown seconds before the polls were scheduled to close. \\n\u201cGod, this is so amazing,\u201d said local man Mark Edwards, gazing up at a fireworks display signaling the conclusion of the incessant media coverage, debates, stump speeches, and campaign advertisements of the election cycle. \u201cI can\u2019t even begin to describe how excited everyone is here. It\u2019s really unbelievable.\u201d \\n\u201cW !\u201d he shouted, his voice nearly drowned out by the sound of Kool & The Gang\u2019s \u201cCelebration\u201d emanating from loudspeakers situated on buildings around the square. \\nAccording to witnesses, the scene was one of unbridled merriment, with roars of delight sweeping through the crowd every time the enormous LED screens in Times Square showed that voting had ended in another state. As vote totals began to come in, thousands in attendance reportedly raised their arms in jubilation, unfurled homemade banners, or placed calls to family members, often yelling to be heard over the sound of whistles, noisemakers, and the exuberant din of the crowd. \\nThroughout the night\u2019s revelry, celebrants were also seen craning their necks and hoisting children onto their shoulders to view the One Times Square Astrovision screen displaying live feeds of equally raucous celebrations in downtown Los Angeles, Chicago\u2019s Loop, Miami Beach, Market Square Park in Houston, and other locations throughout the country \\n\u201cWe stood out in the cold all day to get a good spot, but what\u2019s a few extra hours of discomfort when you\u2019ve been looking forward to this for so long?\u201d said Alice Castillo, who told reporters she had driven there from Baltimore with her two daughters to be part of the excitement. \u201cCould we have stayed home and watched it all on TV? Of course. But nothing compares to the thrill of sharing this incredible moment with so many other people.\u201d \\n\u201cWhen the clock struck zero and everyone erupted into cheers, it was pretty magical,\u201d Castillo added. \\nWhile the crowd was said to have thinned after the polls closed along the East Coast, a reported 250,000 remained well into the night to take in the joyful atmosphere and pack the area\u2019s overflowing bars. One of the Times Square celebrants, 36-year-old Brett Cleaver, said the night\u2019s festivities had caused him to reflect on the past year and consider how tonight represented a fresh start. \\n\u201cBeginning tomorrow, I\u2019m going to try to cherish every second I have where I don\u2019t hear the phrase \u2018swing state\u2019 or see footage from a campaign rally,\u201d Cleaver told reporters, beaming at the prospect of never again looking at an article that speculated on how undecided voters would react to Donald Trump\u2019s or Hillary Clinton\u2019s latest statements. \u201cFor tonight, though, I\u2019m just soaking up as much of this moment as I can.\u201d \\nAdded Cleaver, \u201cI\u2019m already excited to come back and do this again in 2020.\u201d Share This Story: WATCH VIDEO FROM THE ONION Sign up For The Onion's Newsletter \\nGive your spam filter something to do.
