Alexis on November 1, 2016 The good thing about morality or practical reason is that it doesn\u2019t have a particular political affiliation. It transcends political ideologies and that\u2019s what make things very interesting. \u2026by Jonas E. Alexis \\n\\nYou\u2019ve probably seen Megyn Kelly in action. You\u2019ve probably watched her babbling weird things, crazy things, and incoherent things. You\u2019ve also seen how she has prostrated before the Powers That Be for money, power, and fame. [1] In fact, she has been seeking for a salary of $20 million with Fox News. [2] \\nIn other words, Kelly is selling herself for the almighty dollar. If you haven\u2019t noticed some of those phenomena, here is Kelly on the Howard Stern show talking about her husband\u2019s genital, frolicking and other delicate things: YouTube - Veterans Today - \\nFor Kelly, it is perfectly fine for Howard Stern to talk about those issues on his show. It is also fine for Stern to sexually degrade Kelly. For Kelly, Stern is obviously doing a great job. \\nBut for people like Donald Trump to mention almost the same things on a private bus is an unpardonable sin. Sure, Trump\u2019s remarks are disgusting and nasty. And there is no way to justify his immoral statement. It could even be conceived that Trump is just a nasty person who has been grabbing women, well, \u201cby the pussy.\u201d \\nBut do we honestly think that Trump is the only nasty and disgusting guy in town? Can Kelly really explain to us what was she doing on the Howard Stern Show about six years ago? And how again can the same sex culture itself slam Trump\u2019s \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d phraseology and at the same time praise people like Wilhelm Reich or even Alfred Kinsey? \\nYou see, the good thing about morality or practical reason is that it doesn\u2019t have a particular political affiliation. It transcends political ideologies and that\u2019s what make things very interesting. If you are looking at things from a moral point of view, then those who are condemning Trump ought to condemn the same sex culture which articulates Trump\u2019s \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d in a much subtle and interesting way. \\nKeep in mind that Wilhelm Reich, the man who coined the term \u201cthe sexual revolution,\u201d was praised by the New York Times and other media outlets. Reich explicitly promoted and encouraged the sexualization of children and the clergy in his widely read text The Mass Psychology of Fascism . [3] \\nReich taught that \u201cSexual inhibition prevents the average adolescent from thinking and feeling in a rational way.\u201d [4] Reich didn\u2019t stop there. He\u2019s got more insights: \u201cIf one succeeds in getting rid of the childhood fear of masturbation and as a result thereof genitality demands gratification, then intellectual insight and sexual gratification are wont to prevail.\u201d [5] \\nThen, Reich dropped the ideological bomb: \u201cThe mechanism that makes masses of people incapable of freedom is the social suppression of genital sexuality in small children, adolescents, and adults.\u201d [6] \\nNow we\u2019re talking. Now things get really delicious. And it is here that our story gets very interesting because again Reich, like his contemporary Alfred Kinsey, was never condemned for his immoral posturing. The sex culture gave both men great accolades for spreading their own version of \u201cdemocracy\u201d and \u201cfreedom\u201d and for polluting the social order. \\nKinsey, for his part, published \u201cacademic\u201d books such as Sexual Behavior in the Human Male and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female , in which he forged data, pulled things out of thin air, [7] and deliberately selected samples of his \u201cresearch\u201d from male and female prostitutes to advance his wicked ideology. \\nKinsey\u2019s other methods were so bias and fraudulent that statistician John Tukey of the American Statistical Association declared then that \u201cA random selection of three people would have been better than a group of 300 chosen by Mr. Kinsey.\u201d [8] \\nAcademic institutions such as Indiana University continue to protect Kinsey\u2019s pedophilia. [9] Paul Gebhard, Kinsey\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and former director of the Kinsey Institute for Sex Research, deliberately removed anything from the Institute that would even remotely implicate Kinsey as a pedophile and not a scientist. \\nSo, isn\u2019t there a logical breakdown here? The sex industry complicated things when its advocates fired people for exposing Kinsey and documenting his immoral behavior. Are thing living in contradiction? \\nIndeed. \\nNow were are learning that the children of the same sex industry are implicitly sneaking in or even adopting moral themes by saying that \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d is universally wrong. The sex industry shows that G. K. Chesterton was right all along when he said: \u201cA man must be something of a moralist if he is to preach, even if he is to preach unmorality.\u201d [10] \\nPerhaps this was one reason Kinsey died \u201ca broken man\u201d [11] in 1956. A sodomite and sadomasochist of the highest rank, Kinsey is indirectly the father of what is now \u201csex education.\u201d \\nKinsey\u2019s Sexual Behavior in the Human Male and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female contain chapter after chapter about pedophilia, group sex, orgies, etc. Kinsey was trained as a biologist, and it was no accident that he used his training to promote social engineering. [12] \\nObviously the ideology upon which the sex industry is based is irrational, incoherent, and ultimately worthless. And if had had to give the sex industry a different name from a book, it would be Smeagol, who later changed to Gollum, from J. R. R. Tolkien\u2019s The Lord of the Rings . Gollum is the actual character who loves and hates the ring of power at the same time, \u201cas he loves and hates himself.\u201d \\nIn a similar way, the sex industry hates morality and fights against it in the cultural landscape, but the same industry always appeals to an implicitly moral code when someone else pursuits an immoral life. Hillary for example supported the Trotskyite group the Pussy Riot , a subversive band whose members deliberately performed orgies at a museum. \\nBut the same Hillary finds Trump\u2019s \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d disgusting. Trump is nasty for calling people overweight, but Hillary herself called people out for their weight and even went so far as to say that they are \u201cshit-kickers.\u201d [13] \\nSometimes, a \u201cgood morning, Mrs. Clinton\u201d could drive her to say: \u201cFuck off! It\u2019s enough that I have to see you shit-kickers every day\u2026Do your goddamn job and keep your mouth shut.\u201d [14] Judith Reisman \\nThere is more here than meets the eye and ear . Judith Reisman was inevitably fired at the American University for meticulously and methodically documenting that Kinsey was a pedophile masquerading as a researcher. \\nReisman, who has graciously sent me a copy of the fourth edition of her book, Stolen Honor Stolen Innocence: How America was Betrayed by the Lies and Sexual Crimes of a Mad \u201cScientist,\u201d writes that Kinsey was \u201cfamiliar with the work of Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld. Kinsey\u2019s friend, Dr. Harry Benjamin, had brought Hirschfeld to America to speak against the social reform accomplishments of the Purity Movement.\u201c [15] \\nMagnus Hirschfeld (1868-1935), a German-Jewish physician and sexologist, used his medical training as a pretext to promote perversion and, in 1897, built his own system of \u201cthe Scientific-Humanitarian Committee, the first organization anywhere devoted to the protection of homosexual rights.\u201d \\nHirschfeld was also \u201cthe primary inventor of marriage counseling, Gay Liberation, artificial insemination, surgical gender \u2018reassignment,\u2019 and modern sex therapy\u2026His goofy persona and conscientiousness transformed Sexology from an anthropological curiosity into a popular German science. The Berlin monthlies, starting in the mid-twenties, referred to Hirschfeld solicitously as \u2018the Einstein of Sex.\u201d [16] \\nHirschfeld was the Einstein of sex because he \u201cembraced a doctrine known as \u2018sexual relativity.\u201d [17] While the moral order dictates that there are only two sexes\u2014male and female\u2014Hirscheld postulated another doctrine, one more congruent with his subversive ideology. Hirschfeld \u201cwrote that it was \u2018unscientific\u2019 to speak of two sexes. Between \u2018full man\u2019 and \u2018full woman\u2019 was an infinite string of sexual/gender possibilities.\u201d [18] \\nThe only force that could hinder Hirschfeld was the moral order and a will to act on it, but he attacked it before proceeding with his sexual revolution. [19] Hirschfeld spent a large part of his 1200-page book The Homosexuality of Men and Women deconstructing moral principles about sex. [20] \\nThis began to take place in 1919 when Hirschfeld opened the Institute of Sexology in Berlin. Jewish scholar Mel Gordon of the University of California tells us that the institution \\n\u201cquickly became one of the city\u2019s most curious attractions. The Institute\u2019s buildings, including a former mansion, were divided into areas for lectures, consulting offices, study rooms, laboratories, medical clinics, and a museum space devoted to sexual pathology.\u201d [21] \\nPaul Johnson commented, \\n\u201cThe Foxtrot and short skirts, the addiction of pleasure in \u2018the imperial sewers of Berlin,\u2019 the \u2018dirty pictures\u2019 of sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld or the typical man of the times took on in the minds of the average citizen a repugnance that is difficult to recall in hindsight without some historical effort. \\n\u201cIn a number of highly celebrated provocations, the stage of the \u201820s dealt with topics like patricide, incest and other crimes and the deepest inclination of the times tended to self-mockery.\u201d [22] \\nA number of Jewish icons such as George Gershwin, Ben Hecht, Douglas Fairbanks, and Sergei Eisenstein visited the school. [23] Eisenstein \u201cenjoyed the Institute\u2019s collection of sailor-dolls\u2014homemade paper toys that German homosexuals fashioned during the Great War.\u201d [24] \\nThe library of the school, \u201cwhich contained the largest sex and pornographic book collection in Europe, remained accessible to all readers\u2026Politically, the Institute provided a forum for progressive lawyers and government officials who sought to eradicate the laws against homosexuality and defend Germany\u2019s legal abortion rights from the growing onslaught of fascist and religious parties.\u201d [25] \\nThe building contained all sort of sexual devices in order to advance the sexual revolution in Berlin. Mel Gordon again writes: \\n\u201cGlass cases of fetishistic objects and sex aids from preliterate, Asian, and European cultures filled two other rooms. In the open counters and boxes were collections of Mandigo dildos that squirted a milky solution, Moche water bottles with penis-shaped spouts, Sanskrit sex manuals, miniature shoes worn by bound-foot Chinese courtesans, medieval chastity belts, torture instruments from a German brothel, sadistic drawings and assemblages created by Lustmord convicts, an entire picture window of ankle boots donated by a local fetishist, antique steam-driven vibrators, fake rubber breasts and vaginas taken from transvestite prostitutes, lacy panties found on the corpses of von Hindenburg\u2019s heroic officers, and other such incontrovertible evidence of Hirschfeld\u2019s new calculus of desire.\u201d [26] \\nMagus Hirschfeld left Germany during the rise of the Nazi Party, never to return. But he obviously had a tremendously powerful influence on Alfred Kinsey , who went on to open his own \u201csex research\u201d at Indiana University, which was partly based on Hirschefeld\u2019s questionnaires. [27] According to Kinsey, things such as child pornography, bestiality and even sex among children are natural and should be encouraged and promoted. Kinsey wrote: \u201cIt is difficult to understand why a child, except for its cultural conditioning, should be disturbed at having its genitalia touched, or disturbed at seeing the genitalia of other persons, or disturbed at even more specific sexual contacts.\u201d [28] \\nHow did Kinsey bring this repulsive idea to the public, and who was he following? Reisman points out that Kinsey was an admirer and part-time disciple of the late Satanist Aleister Crowley, commonly known as \u201cThe Beast.\u201d In fact, Kinsey made every effort \u201cto acquire Aleister Crowley\u2019s diaries for the Institute\u201d at Indiana University. [29] He actually failed. \\nBut failure was obviously not an option for Kinsey, as he went on to perform the same sex and Satanic orgies that Crowley himself performed. Kinsey \u201cmade a pilgrimage to Thelema Abbey, the temple where Crowley had ministered. Crowley\u2019s first book, the pornographic White Stains, advocated sexual magic and was much favored by Kinsey. In fact, Kinsey was photographed in Crowley\u2019s \u201cChamber of Horrors,\u201d while he and Clara appear together in a photo following Kinsey\u2019s return from the Abbey.\u201d [30] \\nKenneth Anger, a Crowley devotee, later admitted that Kinsey\u2019s obsession with perversion was \u201chighly reminiscent\u201d of Crowley\u2019s sex magic. [31] When Kinsey visited what one ought to call Crowley\u2019s lab experiment in Italy at the Abbey, he saw depictions of children in \u201csado-sexual ceremonies,\u201d and Kinsey never condemned the act. Kinsey \u201cfound Crowley\u2019s savage child pornography, his homosexual magic, and his human sacrifice records to be \u2018most open.\u2019\u201d [32] \\nWe are now facing an inevitable conclusion. No one with an ounce of moral sense should applaud Donald Trump for uttering disgusting words about women. But will the same mass media devote the same amount of time to dethrone people like Hugh Hefner, who incidentally articulated the same thing that Trump was saying? Hefner declared: \u201cCensorship is the tool of totalitarianism and repression. If it is used today to prohibit sexually explicit words and images, it might be used tomorrow to prohibit other forms of expression. \u201cIt might be used to justify the oppression of women in such areas as abortion rights, and to foil other efforts to bring about equality between the sexes. Censorship is insatiable. \u201cIt can erode the freedom of expression until there is only one acceptable point of view left. If that were to happen in our society, whose point of view would survive? \u201cPlayboy celebrates sex because sex is one of the good things in life. The freedom to express oneself without fear of censorship is another.\u201d [33] \\nHere\u2019s the kicker: Hefner wrote his piece in the L.A. Times , the same organ that is now condemning Trump for following Hefner\u2019s advice! \\nWhat the sex culture is basically saying here is that it is sexually permissible to \u201cgrab them by the pussy.\u201d After all, \u201cCensorship is the tool of totalitarianism and repression.\u201d But when Trump actually grabs them \u201cby the pussy,\u201d what was sexually permissible has magically become morally impermissible. \\nIf these people cannot see the lunacy of their ideology, then I\u2019ve got some hamsters to sell them in South Korea. \\n[1] See for example Erica Tempesta, \u201c\u2019She looks like she\u2019s working for an escort agency!\u2019 Megyn Kelly slammed online over risque low-cut dress she wore at the RNC, with critics claiming it looked like \u2018lingerie,\u2019\u201d Daily Mail , July 22, 2016. \\n[2] Joe Flint, \u201cMegyn Kelly Seeks Salary North of $20 Million in Contract Talks With Fox News,\u201d Wall Street Journal , October 27, 2016. \\n[3] See E.
