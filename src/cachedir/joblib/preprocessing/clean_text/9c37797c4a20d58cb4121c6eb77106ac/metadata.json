N. ambassador John Bolton told SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam that he would \u201cabsolutely\u201d have fired FBI Director James Comey if the decision was his to make. [\u201cMy only criticism of the Trump administration decision was that they should have fired him on January the 20th,\u201d Bolton added.   \u201cI speak as an alumnus of the Department of Justice in the Reagan and early Bush 41 administrations. I was assistant attorney general first for the head of the Office of Legislative Affairs, and then head of the Civil Division, the department\u2019s largest litigating division. I\u2019ve dealt with the FBI when I was at Justice. I\u2019ve dealt with them continuously in my days at the State Department on counterintelligence and other issues. I\u2019ve dealt with them in their background investigation of judicial nominees. It was one of my principal responsibilities in legislative affairs at the Justice Department,\u201d he recalled.  \u201cI know the FBI well, and I have enormous respect for it. James Comey disgraced the FBI by his conduct of the Hillary Clinton email investigation and many, many other things that have never become public, but that agents talk about in private conversations,\u201d Bolton declared.  \u201cThis was always about the greater glory of Jim Comey,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s perfectly clear that the way he handled the Clinton email investigation, both in terms of his erroneous legal interpretation of the applicable statutes, but also most critically his July 5 news conference and his subsequent letters to Congress in October and November, reopening and then closing the investigation, were a gross violation of unambiguous Department of Justice policies about not commenting on ongoing investigations. \u201d  \u201cIt applies to investigators as well as prosecutors, and there\u2019s a reason for this,\u201d Bolton explained. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a policy that you don\u2019t talk about investigations and prosecutions. The rule is, you either indict someone or you close the file. \u201d  \u201cWhy is that important?\u201d he asked. \u201cI think it has constitutional foundations: the presumption of innocence for the average citizen, the requirement that guilt be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, that an accused defendant have the right to confront witnesses against him. There\u2019s nothing in that series of constitutional projections that allows prosecutors or investigators to comment on the behavior of an individual citizen, other than in a court to prove up an indictment. \u201d  \u201cI have nothing good to say about Hillary Clinton\u2019s conduct on the email scene, but it was not James Comey\u2019s business to give a review of her behavior,\u201d Bolton declared. \u201cThat\u2019s the real interference in the election. Subsequent the letters and things that flowed from that really all come from that initial mistake. That\u2019s why honestly it\u2019s the case that if Hillary had been elected, she would have been justified in firing Comey on the 20th of January. \u201d  \u201cAll of this business about the firing being an effort to somehow undercut the Russia investigation is utter nonsense. Jeff Sessions, who was a campaign surrogate for the Trump campaign, is recused from the Russia investigation. The Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein, who is a career Justice Department prosecutor, is acting Attorney General for that purpose. The FBI investigation has not been impeded at all. There is absolutely no evidence of that. This is all media speculation and hype,\u201d he said.  \u201cI just hope that the Department of Justice and the White House stand firm on this, because there is an important principle at stake. Substantively, it was right to fire Comey for the protection of 300 million presumed innocent until proven guilty Americans, that investigators and prosecutors don\u2019t get to dish on you in public if they feel they can\u2019t indict,\u201d he maintained. Bolton said there was no question Hillary Clinton, or perhaps outgoing President Barack Obama, would have fired Comey if she had won the election. \u201cWhat Comey did, as outlined in Rosenstein\u2019s memo that accompanied the Sessions recommendation to the president that Comey be fired, is unanswerable,\u201d Bolton contended. \u201cAnd you can bet that the media and the Democratic politicians who are condemning Trump today would have leapt to her defense and said it was entirely justified. \u201d  \u201cI hope that my own principles would have sustained me to the point where I would agree because it would have been justified,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s Comey\u2019s conduct here that\u2019s the center of the issue. It\u2019s not whether Trump had an effective media strategy on Tuesday night. It\u2019s not whether they should have gotten Comey on the phone first. It\u2019s not because he was meeting with the Russian foreign minister the next day. \u201d  \u201cLook, timing is never good on these things,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cThe best timing was January the 20th. Every day that goes on after that is a little bit worse. The idea that Trump should have waited 90 or 180 days before firing Comey  \u2026    \u201d  He laughed as Kassam interjected and said Trump\u2019s critics might as well insist he give the FBI director four years\u2019 notice. \u201cLet\u2019s not leave him in there, precisely,\u201d Bolton concurred. Bolton said the Comey firing is \u201cnot even close to\u201d a   scandal, as some critics have claimed. \u201cI know those people at the FBI. They are tough, they are patriotic. They tend to skew conservative in their voting patterns,\u201d said Bolton. \u201cBut when it comes to law enforcement, nothing gets between them and the truth. The idea that the Trump administration or anybody else from a political background could affect them, could intimidate them, is just ludicrous. It\u2019s just ludicrous. \u201d  \u201cThis whole notion that you have to have an independent counsel and an independent set of investigators is just a way to politicize prosecutions,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact is, this investigation of Russia  \u2014   the Trump campaign connection, whatever it is  \u2014   will go on utterly unimpeded, and if anything with even more determination on the part of the career prosecutors and FBI investigators that they\u2019re not going to be interfered with. They\u2019re going to get to the truth, whatever the truth is. This will strengthen their resolve. \u201d \u201cWhy not appoint Eric Holder the independent counsel? I mean, let\u2019s get right to it. How about Loretta Lynch? They\u2019re both unemployed now,\u201d Bolton suggested sarcastically. Kassam turned to international news, asking Bolton about Turkey\u2019s strenuous objections to the Trump administration\u2019s stated plan to arm and support Syrian Kurdish forces in the upcoming battle to recapture the Islamic State capital of Raqqa. Turkey maintains the Syrian YPG militia is linked to the violent PKK separatists in Turkey, and could pass American weapons to them. \u201cI would not arm them,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cI understand what the logic is, that we have armed Kurds in Iraq against the Islamic State. But the fact is, not all Kurds are equally favorable toward a Western view of responsible government. The PKK is a terrorist and communist organization. \u201d  \u201cI think this is simply carrying on unfortunately from the Obama policy of how to destroy ISIS, and I think it\u2019s the wrong way to go,\u201d he advised.  \u201cI don\u2019t have much sympathy, if any, for Erdogan,\u201d he said of Turkey\u2019s president. \u201cI do have sympathy for Turkey, and I\u2019m very worried these same weapons we\u2019re giving them now are going to be turned against Turkish civilians down the road. We\u2019ve got a very difficult alliance management problem here with Erodgan. I do think he has authoritarian tendencies. I worry that he\u2019s being seduced by Putin. But I think we\u2019ve got to grit our teeth and think of Turkey rather than Erdogan, and see if we can see it through here. \u201d  \u201cI think we need a completely new strategy to defeat ISIS,\u201d Bolton recommended. \u201cI don\u2019t think we want to do it in any kind of way that strengthens other terrorist groups, including those among the Syrian opposition. I don\u2019t think we want to do it in a way that strengthens the Iranian axis of power  \u2014   including the Baghdad government sadly, the Assad regime, and Hezbollah, which is pretty much the direction that the Obama strategy was going in. \u201d  \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to correct here. I certainly share the view that we want to destroy the caliphate at the earliest possible opportunity, but arming this particular group I think is a mistake,\u201d he said. Kassam asked Bolton what he thought of Henry Kissinger\u2019s presence in the Oval Office on Wednesday when President Trump met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to him before. In the interests of full disclosure, I try and speak to him fairly frequently myself,\u201d Bolton said of Kissinger. \u201cI think hearing his insights is a plus for any president. That doesn\u2019t mean that I agree with him on everything, and I rather doubt that President Trump agrees with him on everything. But few people have been through what Kissinger went through and have the insight. Anybody who\u2019s got some spare time should read all three volumes of his memoir of his days in the White House and the State Department. \u201d  \u201cWhat got me most about that meeting was the instant pivot by Democrats and the press to say, \u2018There it is! Henry Kissinger, tainted by his association with Richard Nixon!\u2019 They just can\u2019t restrain themselves,\u201d Bolton marveled.
