As Mr. Trump\u2019s dramatic firing of his acting attorney general threw the capital into tumult, Democrats on Tuesday also seized on the contentiousness to try to block Senator Jeff Sessions\u2019s nomination as attorney general because they said he was too close to Mr. Trump. In describing their tactic of boycotting the votes on nominees to Treasury and to health and human services, Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon said that recent news reports suggested Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Price had given false statements in their nomination hearings. He said more information was needed before making judgments about the nominees. \u201cWe have made clear that we need additional information,\u201d Mr. Wyden said. Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, assailed the nominees for failing to be honest with the committee. \u201cThe truth matters,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what has been happening here. \u201d Republicans expressed dismay at the delay. \u201cI think this is a completely unprecedented level of obstruction,\u201d said Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican from Pennsylvania. But with a Supreme Court vacancy nearing its   point after a long blockade by Republicans, Democrats were not exactly feeling the heat, at least not yet. During a   hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democrats painted Mr. Sessions as an extremist legal savant for Mr. Trump in support of   ideologies, while Republicans portrayed him as a   lawyer and    prosecutor who would enforce the law as written. \u201cHow could we possibly conclude that this nominee will be independent?\u201d asked Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee. She said that Sally Q. Yates, the former acting attorney general fired late Monday, showed \u201cguts\u201d and independence in refusing to defend Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order banning immigrants from seven largely Muslim countries. \u201cI have no confidence that Senator Sessions will do that,\u201d Ms. Feinstein said. Democrats hope to turn the tumult into a referendum on Mr. Sessions, an Alabama Republican, and whether he would have the independence to serve as the nation\u2019s chief law enforcement official after emerging as one of Mr. Trump\u2019s closest advisers in the presidential campaign. Democrats are already calling it \u201cthe Monday night massacre\u201d after Mr. Trump fired Ms. Yates, the acting attorney general, for refusing to defend his immigration order in court. Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said in opening the hearing that there was still \u201cno mystery\u201d whether Mr. Sessions would be confirmed, since the Republicans hold a majority. He urged approval of Mr. Sessions as quickly as possible to restore leadership at the Justice Department. At Mr. Sessions\u2019s nomination hearing this month, Democrats challenged him repeatedly about whether he would have the independence to stand up to Mr. Trump if the president veered into legally questionable terrain. Mr. Sessions assured the lawmakers that he would be able to \u201csay no\u201d to the president and would not be a \u201cmere rubber stamp for the president. \u201d Mr. Sessions said he was not involved in drafting the contentious executive order on immigration. Republicans showed no sign of breaking rank as they defended Mr. Sessions, a friend of many senators who served alongside a number of them on the committee. The hearing evolved into dueling portraits of what Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, called \u201ctwo different people. \u201d Senator John Cornyn, the Texas Republican, scoffed at the \u201cfaux outrage\u201d from Democrats who cast Ms. Yates\u2019s stance as a \u201ca   act of political courage. \u201d Democrats, he said, were unfairly making Mr. Sessions the target of their anger because they \u201cstill seem to be upset about the results of the election. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562015.422239}
