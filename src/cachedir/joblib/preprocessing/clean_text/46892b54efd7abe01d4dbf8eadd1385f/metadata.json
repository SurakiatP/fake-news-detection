If fewer than six are false, the party in power gets four more years,\u201d he said. \\nThese \u201ckeys\u201d include questions about who holds the most seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, the lack of a significant third party campaign, the economy, the extent of a real policy change should a challenger win, the level of social unrest, foreign, and military policies. \\n\u201cThe keys have nothing to do with presidential approval polls or horse-race polls,\u201d Professor Lichtman said, going on to make it evident that he personally dislikes Trump a great deal. However, on his system the Democratic party has definitely \u201clost\u201d five of the \u201ckeys,\u201d and is well on course to lose a sixth, which, he said, would give the election to Trump by default. \\nThe New Observer has long predicted that Trump can only win if at least 70 percent of whites turn out to vote, and that he takes at least two-thirds of the white vote. Anything less than that will see a liberal minority white vote team up with the block nonwhite vote to grant Clinton victory\u2014which was exactly how Obama was twice elected. \\nTrump\u2019s only hope therefore, lies in previous non-voters turning out, a fact to which he alluded in a recent speech, where he mentioned that reports coming in from the early voting figures revealed a massive surge in people who had never voted before.'"}, "time": 1742564436.1480772}
