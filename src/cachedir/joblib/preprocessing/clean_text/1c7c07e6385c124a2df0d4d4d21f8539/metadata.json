[A document posted by the Washington Free Beacon outlines Media Matters\u2019 plans to battle the \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201cpropaganda\u201d that they believe led to the election of Donald Trump. Describing their relationship with Facebook, the documents states, \u201cMedia Matters will serve as their partner,\u201d and that Media Matters\u2019 goal is to help Facebook \u201cadjust its model to stem the flow of damaging fake news on its platform\u2019s pages. \u201d   \u201cWe\u2019ve been engaging with Facebook leadership behind the scenes to share our expertise and offer input on developing meaningful solutions,\u201d it continues. Media Matters pressured Facebook during the 2016 election to focus on the \u201cfake news\u201d they believed to be spreading across social media.  The document also claims, \u201cAfter Facebook responded to our campaign by acknowledging the problem of fake news and agreeing to do something about it, we began a dialogue. It became clear from these conversations that Facebook needed our help in fully understanding the problem and identifying concrete solutions. \u201d The document also claims that Media Matters has been working with Google to identify sources of \u201cfake news\u201d: Similarly, after Google revised their terms of service in order to prohibit   fake news sites from using their advertising network, it was Media Matters that had the information necessary to identify 40 of the worst fake news sites to which this policy applied.  The document further claims that \u201cGoogle will cut off these pages\u2019 accompanying sites\u2019 access to revenue by pulling their access to Google\u2019s ad platform. \u201d Google has recently updated their AdSense policies leading to the banning of as many as 200 websites. David Brock stated in a speech at the retreat that \u201cfake news\u201d was one of the key issues that Media Matters must fight against, calling the organization \u201cthe top watchdog against fake news and propaganda. \u201d  Brock claimed that with the financial support of donors, Media Matters would ensure that \u201cInternet and social media platforms, like Google and Facebook  \u2026     no longer uncritically and without consequence host and enrich fake news sites and propagandists. \u201d Facebook has been accused in the past of censoring conservative news sites. In response, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg held a meeting with conservatives to assure them of his dedication to free speech. Recently there have been rumors that the young tech billionaire is considering a movement into politics, a rumor backed up by close friends that say Zuckerberg \u201cwants to be emperor. \u201d When asked for comment, a Facebook spokesperson told Breitbart, \u201cWe think it\u2019s important to understand how people use and experience our platform, which is why we talk openly with groups, organizations and media outlets that span the political spectrum. \u201d Google declined to provide comment to the Washington Free Beacon.
