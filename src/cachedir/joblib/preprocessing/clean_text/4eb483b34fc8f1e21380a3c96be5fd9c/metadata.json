Trump, was not qualified to be president. Asked by CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo whether Mr. Trump was qualified to hold the office they both seek, Mrs. Clinton declared emphatically, \u201cNo. \u201d She called the crash of an EgyptAir flight early Thursday an act of terrorism and went on to portray Mr. Trump as dangerously out of step with what a commander in chief would need to do to combat such attacks. She cited his proposal to temporarily bar Muslims from entering American borders, his comments about diminishing the United States\u2019 involvement in NATO and his remarks that he would negotiate directly with the North Korean dictator, Kim   as evidence of how \u201cunmoored\u201d Mr. Trump is on foreign policy. This month, when MSNBC asked a similar question, Mrs. Clinton said that Mr. Trump had \u201cgiven no indication that he understood the gravity of the responsibilities that go with being commander in chief. \u201d But she stopped short of emphatically declaring that he was unqualified. She did not mince words on Thursday, saying, \u201cI have concluded he is not qualified to be president of the United States. \u201d In a statement on Thursday, Mr. Trump said that Mrs. Clinton was the candidate unqualified to president. \u201cShe has bad judgment,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the statement, \u201cand is unfit to serve as president at this delicate and difficult time in our country\u2019s history. \u201d Mrs. Clinton\u2019s statements come as she encounters a lingering threat for the Democratic nomination from Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose supporters have become increasingly antagonistic toward her candidacy. Despite recent primary wins by Mr. Sanders, his path to the party\u2019s nomination appears mathematically impossible, a fact Mrs. Clinton sought to make abundantly clear. \u201cI will be the nominee of our party, Chris,\u201d she told Mr. Cuomo. \u201cThere is no way I won\u2019t be. \u201d On Thursday afternoon, Michael Briggs, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders, said in a statement that his candidate\u2019s recent victories in Indiana, West Virginia and Oregon showed that voters there \u201crespectfully disagreed with Secretary Clinton. \u201d He added, \u201cWe expect voters in the remaining eight contests also will disagree,\u201d and said that some polls showing Mr. Sanders faring better than Mrs. Clinton against Mr. Trump made it \u201cclear that millions of Americans have growing doubts about the Clinton campaign. \u201d Throughout the interview, Mrs. Clinton appeared ready to put the primaries behind her and move on to Mr. Trump. Asked if she would consider naming Mr. Sanders her   nominee, in an effort to unify the party and bring in his liberal and young supporters, she demurred. \u201cI think the thing that brings us together is Donald Trump,\u201d she said. She declined to respond to Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on her husband, Bill Clinton, including an interview with Fox News on Wednesday night in which Mr. Trump brought up a   rape allegation against the former president. \u201cI think people can judge his campaign for what it is,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cI\u2019m going to run my campaign. \u201d Asked if she had the urge to defend her family\u2019s honor against the onslaught of attacks that will grow louder, Mrs. Clinton said: \u201cNo, not at all. I know that is exactly what he is fishing for, and I\u2019m not going to be responding. \u201d The interview took place in Park Ridge, Ill. the Chicago suburb where Mrs. Clinton spent her childhood. Mr. Cuomo asked what advice her mother, Dorothy Rodham, would have given her in dealing with the likely battle that awaits her against an opponent unlike any she has confronted. \u201cI think it would be the same advice that my mother always gave me,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cWhich is everybody gets knocked down and knocked around in life. The real test is whether you get up and keep going. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561906.7804308}
