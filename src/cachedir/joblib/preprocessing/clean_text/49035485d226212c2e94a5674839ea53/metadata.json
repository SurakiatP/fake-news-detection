There would be no way the state could step in and force decisions. Especially decisions that would be life altering and permanently damaging. \\nNone of us would think that a social work would threaten to take our children if we did not let them have sex with their love interests. They would not make us allow our children to disfigure themselves. \u201cIf little Johnny wants to cut off his nose, you must consent.\u201d This notion would be absurd. \\nNot in Britain. \\nThe Christian Post reports : \\nChristian parents in the U.K. are taking legal action against their local council authority after it undermined their parental rights and sided with their 14-year-old daughter who says she wants to transition to become a boy. \\nThe Daily Mail reports that the girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told local council officials that she wants to start transitioning to look like a boy. The parents have said that she is too young to be making such decisions, however, and will be meeting with teachers and social workers next month to discuss how the girl should be addressed and treated at school. \\nThe Christian Legal Centre, which will be funding the legal costs for the parents, blamed the \u201ctransgender cultural movement\u201d for creating what it called a new \u201cconflict of rights\u201d within the family. \\nSociety is growing more and more antagonistic to parents. This antagonism is especially true if that parent is Christian. As I reported , in North Carolina, the Gender Unicorn teaches teens that their parents have no place in such decisions. \\nThis proves that this is not something that is soon to be coming to America; it is already here. \\nArticle posted with permission from Constitution.com   shares'"}, "time": 1742562721.0060546}
