She referenced the legacy of President Theodore Roosevelt in calling for moderate economic reforms: \\n\u201cRemember what Teddy Roosevelt did. Yes, he took on what he saw as the excesses in the economy, but he also stood against the excesses in politics. He didn\u2019t want to unleash a lot of nationalist, populistic reaction. He wanted to try to figure out how to get back into that balance that has served America so well over our entire nationhood.\u201d \\nRoosevelt was known as a \u201ctrust buster\u201d who was responsible for breaking up massive corporations, and he was outspoken about his wariness of big banks and wealthy business executives. \\nClinton also acknowledged \u201cthat many Americans feel frustrated, some even angry,\u201d about the economic downturn, adding: \u201cAnd a lot of that anger has been directed at the financial industry.\u201d \\nWhile recognizing the need for reforms, Clinton also seemed to suggest that the financial sector might be allowed to police itself: \\n\u201cToday, there\u2019s more that can and should be done that really has to come from the industry itself, and how we can strengthen our economy, create more jobs at a time where that\u2019s increasingly challenging, to get back to Teddy Roosevelt\u2019s square deal. And I really believe that our country and all of you are up to that job.\u201d \\nAccording to one analysis of the speech and related emails, this attempt to acknowledge critics of the banking industry could have been intended as a way to placate Clinton\u2019s critics in the event of the eventual release of the speeches. \\n\u201cIn an email on November 20, 2015 Clinton speechwriter Dan Schwerin explicitly noted how he left an \u2018easter egg\u2019 in the DB speech precisely in case the world came knocking and asking for Hillary\u2019s speeches,\u201d wrote an anonymous contributor at Zero Hedge using the name \u201cTyler Durden,\u201d a shared pseudonym adopted by many writers at the site, in an analysis of the speech published on Wednesday. \\nIn the 2015 email , Schwerin wrote: \\n\u201cI wrote her a long riff about economic fairness and how the financial industry has lost its way, precisely for the purpose of having something we could show people if ever asked what she was saying behind closed doors for two years to all those fat cats. It\u2019s definitely not as tough or pointed as we would write it now, but it\u2019s much more than most people would assume she was saying in paid speeches. \u2026 Perhaps at some point there will be value in sharing this with a reporter and getting a story written.\u201d \\nUltimately, \u201cTyler Durden\u201d noted, the Clinton campaign opted not to release the speeches . \\nElsewhere in the Deutsche Bank speech, Clinton acknowledged the crucial role big banks will play in Washington\u2019s strategic pivot to Asia. She said: \\n\u201cWill we have the discipline and dexterity to follow through on our pivot to Asia where so much of the history of the 21st century will be written, while managing new and old crises in the Middle East and Europe? \\nCan we get our relationship with China right, navigating between the twin shoals of excessive accommodation and the potential for dangerous conflict? \\nWill our traditional allies in Europe and East Asia step up and share the responsibilities of upholding a global order under pressure from so many fronts?\u201d \\nThe focus on Asia, started under the Obama administration and likely to continue under Clinton, if her speech is any indication, involves encircling China with economic and military allies as a way to undercut China\u2019s growing global influence. However, some historic allies like the Philippines have begun to push back against U.S. influence in the region. \\nMany analysts see the Trans-Pacific Partnership , a controversial trade deal, as a key element to the U.S. pivot to Asia. While initially supportive of the deal, Clinton now promises to oppose the TPP as president after facing intense pressure from Sanders and activists opposed to the deal .'"}, "time": 1742564102.5432773}
