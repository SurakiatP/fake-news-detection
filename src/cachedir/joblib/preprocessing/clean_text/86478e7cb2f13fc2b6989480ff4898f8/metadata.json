At least four people, including the assailant, were killed and at least 40 others injured in the confusing swirl of violence, which the police said they assumed had been \u201cinspired by international terrorism. \u201d It appeared to be the most serious such assault in London since the deadly subway bombings more than a decade ago. Throughout a turbulent afternoon, ambulances, emergency vehicles and heavily armed security officers thronged the area outside Parliament, as one of the busiest sections of London was cordoned off and evacuated. Prime Minister Theresa May was rushed into a vehicle and spirited back to her office. She held a meeting of the government\u2019s emergency committee and issued a statement on Wednesday night from her 10 Downing Street residence denouncing \u201cthe sick and depraved terrorist attack on the streets of our Capital this afternoon. \u201d Mrs. May also said that \u201cthe full details of exactly what happened are still emerging,\u201d but she confirmed that the attack had been carried out by a lone male assailant. As of late Wednesday, his identity had not been released, but Scotland Yard officials said they believed they knew who he was. The attack unfolded around 2:40 p. m. Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said at a news conference. Driving a sport utility vehicle, the assailant slammed into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge near Parliament, killing two people and injuring many others, before crashing into a railing. After the crash, the driver left the vehicle and approached Parliament, where he stabbed an unarmed police officer to death and was fatally shot by the police. The dead officer was identified as Keith Palmer, 48, a member of the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command with 15 years of experience. \u201cThis is the day we have planned for but we hoped would never happen,\u201d Mr. Rowley said. \u201cSadly, it\u2019s now a reality. \u201d The attack came on the anniversary of suicide bombings in Brussels that killed 32 people, along with three bombers. It confirmed fears among counterterrorism officials that London, which had largely escaped recent terrorist attacks in Europe, would join cities like Paris, Brussels and Berlin as targets of mass violence. \u201cTerrorism affects us all, and France knows the pain the British people are enduring today,\u201d President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France said at a news conference in Villepinte, near Paris. Mrs. May, who spoke with Mr. Hollande and President Trump, said in her statement that Parliament would meet as normal on Thursday. She vowed to never permit \u201cthe voices of hate and evil to drive us apart. \u201d Cmdr. B. J. Harrington of the Metropolitan Police said at a brief news conference earlier Wednesday that a \u201cfull counterterrorism investigation is underway. \u201d He asked members of the public to report any suspicious activity and to share any images or video of the violence. Commander Harrington said that the acting police commissioner, Craig Mackey, had been at the scene of the attack and was not injured, but was \u201cbeing treated as a significant witness. \u201d At least three police officers were among those injured on the bridge. Also among the injured were three   boys from a group of visiting  students from the Brittany region of France, and a woman who fell or plunged into the River Thames. Mr. Hollande\u2019s government said it had chartered a plane to London with families of the French victims. Tobias Ellwood, a minister in the Foreign Office, tried to save the life of the fatally stabbed police officer by giving    resuscitation. The number of injured apparently included five South Korean tourists who were overwhelmed by a crowd fleeing the scene, South Korea\u2019s Foreign Ministry said Thursday morning. Three men suffered fractures, and a woman had surgery for a head injury, the ministry said. For more than two hours, astonished lawmakers inside the House of Commons, some of whom had ducked for cover, were told to stay in place as officers searched the premises office by office. \u201cAt the moment, the very clear advice from the police and the director of security in the house is that we should remain under suspension, and that the chamber should remain in lockdown until we\u2019ve received advice that it is safe to go back to normal procedures,\u201d David Lidington, the leader of the House of Commons, or lower house of Parliament, told lawmakers in remarks broadcast live on the BBC. Olly Grender, a member of the House of Lords, said that lawmakers were staying put. \u201cWe were in a meeting, I heard shouting through the window,\u201d she said, adding that a colleague came in to tell them that a serious episode had taken place. Jayne Wilkinson, 59, from Birmingham, was near the statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square with her partner, David Turner, 56, when they saw people suddenly running from Parliament. The couple said they had seen a   man holding a knife. He ignored warnings from the police, running though the gates into the Parliament compound, she said. \u201cThey were shouting to warn him,\u201d Ms. Wilkinson said. Soon after, she and her partner heard three gunshots and saw the man on the ground. Three construction workers inside the grounds of Westminster Palace said they had heard shots fired in rapid succession before they were escorted off the premises. \u201cIt was  \u201d one said. Reuben Saunders, an American student at Cambridge University who was visiting Parliament, said he had been leaving the building when he saw a police officer accosted by an assailant armed with two knives or similar weapons. \u201cHe was at the gate, I heard screaming,\u201d Mr. Saunders said. \u201cI saw the man on the ground being repeatedly stabbed, or pummeled. \u201d Mr. Saunders said two or three other police officers arrived, and \u201cthere were two or three gunshots. \u201d Corinne Desray, a teacher who was outside Parliament with 39 teenage students on a   school trip from northern France, said they had heard three shots. \u201cMy colleague saw bodies lying on the floor and someone said a policeman has been knived,\u201d she said. \u201cI told the kids to leave quickly, we\u2019re heading back to the bus. \u201d Kirsten Hurrell, 70, who owns a newsstand opposite Big Ben, said she had seen a car swerve across a bicycle lane and into a fence around Parliament. She saw a body lying on the ground and called emergency services. \u201cAt first I thought it was an accident, but then I was told the car had already mowed down quite a number of people on Westminster Bridge,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cNow that it is a terrorist incident, it is a bit more daunting. \u201d Robert Vaudry, 52, a fund manager from    said he had emerged from the Westminster subway station around 2:40 p. m. for a meeting with a lawmaker when he realized that something was amiss. \u201cI came out of the Tube and there were two armed policemen,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cOne grabbed my arm, pushed me to the left and said, \u2018Get out of here,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThey were shouting at everyone to get away. \u201d As he spoke, police officers were cordoning off the area. One officer shouted, \u201cWe need everyone to move back past Downing Street. \u201d Radoslaw Sikorski, a former foreign minister of Poland who was in the area, was in a taxi on Westminster Bridge when the pedestrians were hit by the other vehicle. \u201cI didn\u2019t see the impact, I heard it  \u2014   it sounded like a car hitting a sheet of metal,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw these people lying on the tarmac, on the pavement. I saw five people down, one unconscious and one bleeding heavily from his head. He was not moving. The taxi driver rang the emergency services, and people rushed to help. \u201d Andrew Bone, the executive director of the Responsible Jewellery Council, an industry standards group, was on a bus heading toward Victoria Station when it was stopped at the edge of Parliament Square. Seeing the commotion, he initially thought an action movie was being shot, but quickly discerned the gravity of the situation as the bus was evacuated and he saw the vehicle that had crashed into a railing. \u201cWe had a   seat as the first responders arrived,\u201d Mr. Bone said. \u201cI am of the generation who remembers I. R. A. bombs in London during the Troubles,\u201d he said, referring to the sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland. \u201cWe are not indifferent, but police have reacted with calm. I saw no panic. \u201d Britain has not suffered a   terrorist attack since July 7, 2005, when bomb attacks on subway trains and on a bus killed more than 50 people. Political violence is relatively rare in Britain, where gun ownership is stringently restricted. Jo Cox, a Labour member of Parliament, was assassinated in her constituency in northern England on June 16, a week before the contentious referendum on whether Britain should leave the European Union. In 1979, a lawmaker was assassinated near the Parliament building. Airey Neave, a Conservative Party member, was killed when his car was blown up. Jeremy Shapiro, a former State Department official now at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said that the London attack was consistent with the recent pattern of attacks in which a vehicle was used to kill people, citing assaults in France, Germany and Israel. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a gradual movement away from terrorist attacks on the West to attacks on softer and softer targets with more improvised weapons,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a way, it\u2019s a sign of desperation and a demonstration of the effectiveness of counterterrorism in the West. It\u2019s spectacularly easy to kill a bunch of people with a car or a truck if you don\u2019t care who they are. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563529.8786042}
