That would be Judy Garland, whose television show Ms. Streisand visited in 1963 in what feels like a watershed moment in the history of fabled American vocalists. In the course of my recent   visit with Ms. Streisand at her cloistered estate here, she says several times that she doesn\u2019t like revisiting her past. But since she\u2019s been researching a memoir, she\u2019s in a more retrospective state of mind than usual. And before the afternoon is over, she will take me on a circuitous tour of her long life in the spotlight, with frequent side trips into the persistent problems of being Barbra. Ms. Streisand, you see, has always been in charge  \u2014   of her image, of her career and, whenever possible, of her immediate environment  \u2014   ever since she started singing in Greenwich Village nightclubs as a gawky teenager in   clothes in the early 1960s. It is a determination that has made her one of the most enduring  \u2014   and adored and disliked  \u2014   of all American stars. It is also why she seems unlikely to retreat entirely behind the iron gates of the estate she says is the one place she is entirely comfortable. She needs to make sure that the version of Barbra that the world knows  \u2014   onscreen, in recordings, in biographies  \u2014   is the version she sees, as exactly as possible. Unlike many female stars of her generation and stature, she has rarely ceded control to any manager, or mate, or Svengali. Which brings us back to the subject of Garland, a singer with whom Ms. Streisand has been tellingly compared and contrasted over the years. Ms. Streisand was barely into her 20s when they met, but already on the cusp of astronomical stardom Garland, 41, would be dead six years later, one of Hollywood\u2019s most notorious casualties of devouring fame. Yet when they sang two American standards in counterpoint  \u2014   \u201cHappy Days Are Here Again\u201d (Ms. Streisand) and \u201cGet Happy\u201d (Garland)  \u2014   they seemed like a matched set. Each interpreted an upbeat song with a big, trumpeting voice that nonetheless hinted at a small, solitary figure within. Happiness, as hymned in these renditions, would never be won easily. You can find that video on YouTube, and it is impossible to watch it without shivering. \u201cAfterward, she used to visit me and give me advice,\u201d Ms. Streisand says. \u201cShe came to my apartment in New York, and she said to me, \u2018Don\u2019t let them do to you what they did to me.\u2019 I didn\u2019t know what she meant then. I was just getting started. \u201d Whoever \u201cthey\u201d were  \u2014   studio moguls, a voyeuristic press, parasitic   cannibalistic fans  \u2014   it was never likely that they could do to Ms. Streisand what they did to Garland. From the earliest days of her career, Ms. Streisand exuded a Garlandesque fragility and emotional openness. But her long nails and   eyes, both quizzical and confrontational, spoke of the toughness of someone singularly capable of protecting herself. Both sides of that dichotomy are still very much in evidence when I visit Ms. Streisand at her estate here, a compound of three main buildings that evoke a fantasy New England, incongruously situated above the glittering expanse of the Pacific Ocean. To step behind its gates after experiencing the brown and smoke shades of the adjoining highway on a hazy summer\u2019s day is to feel like Garland\u2019s Dorothy stepping from   Kansas into the Technicolor of Oz. Ms. Streisand  \u2014   who is promoting both her album, due Aug. 26, and her   concert tour this month (called \u201cThe Music   \u2026     the Mem\u2019ries   \u2026     the Magic! \u201d)  \u2014   is waiting at the open door of the house she lives in. That\u2019s as opposed to the one she works in  \u2014   called \u201cGrandma\u2019s House\u201d  \u2014   or \u201cthe Barn,\u201d which she describes as \u201can art project. \u201d That\u2019s the one with a subterranean mall of   shops, a   marvel of themed d\u00e9cor and room after room of impeccably arranged artifacts. At 74, she looks like, well, Barbra Streisand, albeit a softer, more subdued version than the one you know from six decades of movies, from her Oscar   in the musical \u201cFunny Girl\u201d (1968) in which she recreated her Broadway performance as the Ziegfeld entertainer Fanny Brice, to the comedy \u201cThe Guilt Trip\u201d (2012) with Seth Rogen. Though the rooms behind her beckon in carefully coordinated shades of pale, Ms. Streisand is wearing the uniform black of an East Coast urban dweller. \u201cI am a New Yorker!\u201d she exclaims, when I point out the discrepancy. \u201cA Brooklynite. That means it\u2019s an earthy place to come from. It\u2019s reality, as compared to reality TV. \u201d In conversation, she is a paradoxical mix of   spontaneity and preoccupied vigilance. She may shoot from the hip when she talks about herself, but she also backtracks a lot, as if to retrace the bullet\u2019s trajectory and make sure it hit its target. It\u2019s when she\u2019s guiding me through her homes  \u2014   gleefully annotating their contents (while noshing from the plates of   snacks that keep materializing, courtesy of her longtime housekeeper)  \u2014   that she seems most at ease. Ms. Streisand has created her own sui generis alternative reality here, one she shares with her husband, the actor James Brolin. (On this afternoon, the day before their 18th wedding anniversary, he is filming a movie in Canada, but he has sent her \u201cfour beautiful arrangements of flowers. \u201d) This world is arranged and maintained according to her highly exacting standards, though even here there are annoying signs of imperfection. \u201cVicky, whose truck is that?\u201d she calls out to an assistant, as she\u2019s showing me her   gardens. \u201cIt\u2019s in the shot. Whenever I show my house, I never want a car in it. Also, tell somebody there\u2019s a mop in the lavender room in Grandma\u2019s House. \u201d Ms. Streisand has written a book about the creation of this private Xanadu, \u201cMy Passion for Design,\u201d which became the unlikely basis for a play about her, Jonathan Tolins\u2019s \u201cBuyer  Cellar. \u201d No, she hasn\u2019t seen it. One of the first things she says to me, chummily, is \u201cI understand you\u2019ve seen \u2018Buyer  Cellar\u2019 well, now you can see the real thing. \u201d Ms. Streisand says she hates to leave her Malibu property, the place where she can be in control. Almost as soon as she set foot onstage, during rehearsals for her first Broadway show, \u201cI Can Get It for You Wholesale,\u201d she has known, she says, that she was born to be a director, in all senses of that word. She has become one behind the camera, as the pioneering female director, star and producer of \u201cYentl,\u201d \u201cThe Prince of Tides\u201d and \u201cThe Mirror Has Two Faces. \u201d Being that kind of director, though, means waiting  \u2014   and waiting  \u2014   for   and money and rights to material. Though it had been announced a few weeks earlier that she would be making her   version of the musical \u201cGypsy\u201d  \u2014   in which she would portray the ultimate stage mother, Mama Rose  \u2014   that project is again in limbo. \u201cI\u2019m at their mercy,\u201d she says. \u201cOne day you\u2019re going to do \u2018Gypsy,\u2019 the next day it\u2019s off. And then this is the only place  \u2014   writing a book, making a record or doing a tour  \u2014   where I can do what I have to do, my work. \u201d The record is \u201cEncore,\u201d the 35th of Ms. Streisand\u2019s studio albums. (To date, her records have sold about 245 million copies worldwide and with \u201cPartners,\u201d her 2014 compilation of duets, she became the only singer to land a No. 1 album in six successive decades.) She says that working on the numbers with the other singers  \u2014   performers known principally for film work, and including Antonio Banderas, Alec Baldwin, Anne Hathaway and Seth MacFarlane  \u2014   was rather like producing a series of  . She added dialogue and, in some cases, altered lyrics from Broadway classics. For her interpretation of Irving Berlin\u2019s \u201cAnything You Can Do,\u201d from \u201cAnnie Get Your Gun,\u201d she devised a prologue in which she and Ms. McCarthy sparred after learning they were up for the same film role. This allowed Ms. Streisand to interject a joke about how to say her name: It\u2019s Streisand, as in \u201csand on the beach,\u201d not \u201c\u201d a mispronunciation that has plagued her at least since she first appeared on \u201cThe Ed Sullivan Show\u201d in the early 1960s. Recently, she heard John Mayer (with whom she sang on \u201cPartners\u201d) being interviewed by the producer and TV host Andy Cohen, and to her dismay, \u201cthey both called me Barbra  . \u201d She says she can\u2019t wait for them to hear the duet with Ms. McCarthy. \u201cMaybe they\u2019ll get it now,\u201d she says, managing to sound both amused and annoyed. The world is riddled with such exasperating errors, and Ms. Streisand sees herself as burdened with the Sisyphean task of uprooting them. Working on her memoir  \u2014   scheduled for publication in 2017 (although she says, \u201cDon\u2019t hold your breath\u201d)  \u2014   she has become more agonizingly aware than ever of misrepresentations in the many, many accounts of her life that already exist. Writing about herself is not a process she enjoys. She says if she can speak fluently these days about   events, it is \u201conly because I\u2019ve had to look it up. \u201d She is grateful to have discovered the existence of the superfan Matt Howe\u2019s online archive of all things Streisand. Not that she looks at it herself. \u201cBecause, again, it\u2019s like the play [\u201cBuyer  Cellar\u201d],\u201d she says. \u201cHow do I look at myself? I can\u2019t do it. But my researcher tells me what\u2019s on that thing, like Marvin Hamlisch singing \u2018The Way We Were\u2019 [the theme song of her 1973 hit movie with Robert Redford] before I changed the melody and some of the lyrics. \u201d For someone like me, who came of age watching and listening to Ms. Streisand in the early years of her career, her forced focus on the way she was is a godsend. It means that I get to see, in the screening room in the Barn, Ms. Streisand\u2019s uncut sequence of herself as Fanny Brice performing \u201cSwan Lake\u201d in \u201cFunny Girl. \u201d (She supplies a running annotation as we watch, which includes speaking, in character, the unrecorded dialogue that Fanny was saying onscreen.) I also get to hear about the Rialto of yore, where, as a young woman just a few years out of Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn, Ms. Streisand became a star in two musicals, \u201cI Can Get It for You Wholesale\u201d (1962) and \u201cFunny Girl\u201d (1964) the first and last Broadway shows in which she has appeared. When Ms. Streisand showed up at the Tony Awards in June (to present the award for best musical to \u201cHamilton\u201d) it was her first appearance at the ceremony in 46 years. She never intended to make her career in live theater, she says. For one thing, she hated making the rounds of casting offices (\u201cI\u2019ve never wanted the humiliation of having to ask people for jobs\u201d). There\u2019s something, she says, about being judged  \u2014   live and on the spot  \u2014   that unnerves her, especially since her appearance in Central Park in 1967, when 150, 000 people showed up and she forgot lyrics onstage. Since then, \u201cI always got frightened when I had to perform live. \u201d She was absent from commercial concert stages for the following 27 years. \u201cI\u2019m killing myself for this tour, because there\u2019s a painting I want,\u201d she says. She is a   \u201cauction freak,\u201d and the covetable paintings in her house include works by Munch and Modigliani, as well as a portrait of George Washington by Gilbert Stuart. (She performs at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn on Aug. 11 and 13.) She says she never sings a song the same way twice, which presented problems when she worked on Broadway. Her habit of continually tweaking her role as Miss Marmelstein, the overworked secretary in \u201cWholesale,\u201d provoked its director, Arthur Laurents, into criticism that stings her to this day. \u201cHe said: \u2018You\u2019re never gonna make it in showbiz. You\u2019re too undisciplined. You never do it exactly the same way. \u2019\u201d Ms. Streisand says she visited Laurents  \u2014   who also wrote the screenplay for \u201cThe Way We Were\u201d  \u2014   not long before he died in 2011. \u201cAnd I said: \u2018Arthur, what do you feel now about the way I work? Do you understand why I change things, or had a hard time freezing the same thing?\u2019 He said, \u2018I absolutely do understand.\u2019 That was very rewarding for me. \u201d Though she had no previous Broadway experience at the time of \u201cWholesale,\u201d Ms. Streisand had her own specific notions about the staging of it. And for the record, she says, the idea of performing her character\u2019s big solo in an office chair on wheels was hers, not the choreographer Herbert Ross\u2019s. She seems to look back on her younger self with a certain wonder. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I would have the chutzpah now,\u201d she says. But where did that original immense confidence  \u2014   and hunger  \u2014   come from? Much has been written about Ms. Streisand\u2019s Brooklyn childhood: the gap left by the death of her father, a scholar and schoolteacher, when she was a toddler the mother who never complimented her and thought she should become a secretary. (For the record, that\u2019s how the signature nails came about, since they kept Ms. Streisand from being able to type.) \u201cShe had talent,\u201d she says of her mother, who worked as a secretary but who Ms. Streisand describes as also having had \u201ca beautiful voice. \u201d \u201cShe didn\u2019t have the drive. I said, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you do this, why didn\u2019t you go after your dream?\u2019 You know what I\u2019m saying? You can have a dream, but how do you manifest it, how do you make it happen? Hard work, heart, taking chances  \u2014   that was always my philosophy. \u201d It\u2019s all the more surprising, then, when Ms. Streisand says: \u201cThe thing is, I was always kind of lazy. On the one hand, I am  \u2014   or I was  \u2014   ambitious. On the other hand, if I was having a great love affair or something, I\u2019d say, I don\u2019t want to do anything else. I mean, searching for personal happiness was more important. \u201d That is why, she says, she turned down a number of plum roles in her first decade in Hollywood, including the starring roles in \u201cThey Shoot Horses, Don\u2019t They? ,\u201d \u201cKlute\u201d and \u201cJulia. \u201d Those all went, memorably, to another actress. As Ms. Streisand says, in a deadpan aside, \u201cI made Jane Fonda\u2019s career. \u201d So will we ever get to see her as Mama Rose in \u201cGypsy\u201d? Ms. Streisand is now several decades older than that character, modeled after the mother of the celebrated stripper Gypsy Rose Lee. But when you hear her talk about \u201cGypsy\u201d  \u2014   and to see the   \u201csizzle tape\u201d she made, which ends with a concert performance of her defiantly singing the climactic number \u201cRose\u2019s Turn\u201d  \u2014   the mouth still waters. Ms. Streisand has given much thought to Rose. She has talked to her friend Stephen Sondheim, the show\u2019s lyricist, about potential revisions to the songs. She has an ace idea for the delivery of the broken words \u201cmama, mama\u201d in \u201cRose\u2019s Turn,\u201d based on her belief that the key to Rose\u2019s blind ambition to make a star of her daughter can be found in the mother who walked out on her. Another description Ms. Streisand offers of Rose seems closer to  : \u201cI think she\u2019s tough as nails, but a tough person who\u2019s vulnerable inside, you know? It\u2019s like a crab, something that\u2019s jelly inside. What makes for anger is also hurt, and that gives you the depth of playing somebody like that. \u201d The Malibu residence, as tailored to her tastes and needs as a couture dress might be, would seem to offer a place where a person might shed her shell. I ask her if she feels serene here. She doesn\u2019t answer immediately. So I ask: \u201cDo you ever feel serene?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a good question,\u201d she says. So I ask it again. Her muttered response: \u201cNo, not really, sad to say. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562081.4852092}
