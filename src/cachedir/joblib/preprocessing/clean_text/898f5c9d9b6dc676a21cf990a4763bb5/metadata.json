[\u201cYou promised to use the Internet to expose and bring down all the corrupt bastards ruining our world, and boy did you almost follow through,\u201d Lorre wrote in one of his infamous vanity cards, which are his trademark messages that appear   at the end of nearly every episode of his various productions.  \u201cThe job\u2019s only   done! You need to show us you\u2019re not just another gun for hire and hose down the other mosh pit. You know what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d read Lorre\u2019s message to Assange, which appeared at the end of Thursday\u2019s episode of the CBS comedy drama Mom. \u201cThe tax returns, the   maybe even some     beauty pageant video action. Time to step up,  . \u201d Assange\u2019s WikiLeaks published thousands of Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta\u2019s emails during the campaign. Lorre\u2019s missive came on the heels of a news reports on a memo alleging that there was communication between Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and Russian officials. Numerous allegation in the report, dubbed \u201cfake news\u201d by   Trump earlier this week, have since been found false. The Big Bang Theory creator, who attended a   fundraising dinner for Hillary Clinton in Los Angeles in July, also used a vanity card to react to Trump\u2019s victory of Clinton. \u201c\u201d read the vanity card that appeared on both Big Bang Theory and Mom just two days after the election. In his latest salvo, Lorre asks Assange to become a \u201chero\u201d and hack Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s time to go all Talking Heads on this situation,\u201d Lorre wrote. \u201cBurning down the house, bubelah! You\u2019re one   away from being a hero. Or maybe a martyr. Ecuadorean potato soup, Ecuadorean puhtahto soup, they\u2019re usually the same thing. \u201d   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson'"}, "time": 1742562209.2281444}
