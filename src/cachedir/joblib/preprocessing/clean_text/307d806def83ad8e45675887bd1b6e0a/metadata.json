Here\u2019s how you can listen to and delete everything your device has recorded. [\u201cIs Amazon Echo always listening? The short answer is yes,\u201d declared Fox News Tech. \u201cI\u2019m guessing most people don\u2019t know this, but  \u2014   surprise!  \u2014   you can listen to every command you\u2019ve ever given your Echo with the Alexa app on your smartphone or tablet. \u201d  \u201cWhen I did, I was surprised to learn that some of my recordings had nothing to do with commands,\u201d Fox News\u2019 Kim Komando reported, explaining that \u201cThere I was talking on my phone about the old studios I was selling. Alexa also recorded portions of a presidential debate. I am not sure why my real estate call was recorded, but one of the candidates almost said the word \u2018Alexa. \u2019\u201d So how do you find and delete Amazon Echo\u2019s recordings? If you\u2019d like to review your old recordings, open the Alexa app, tap on the Settings menu and then tap on History. Given the hundreds or thousands of commands most Echo users accumulate, you\u2019ll find a huge catalog of your requests. Select the recording you\u2019d like to review and tap the Play icon to listen to it. If it creeps you out that your requests and other things you may have said have been stored in a database, you can delete them. Here\u2019s how: * Open the Alexa app and go into Settings. * Select History and you\u2019ll see a list of all the entries. * Select an entry and tap the Delete button. But what if you want to delete all your recordings? Do you have to remove each one manually? That could take days! Amazon lets you remove everything with one click. Just visit the \u201cManage Your Content and Devices\u201d at www. amazon. . But keep in mind Amazon\u2019s warning that \u201cdeleting voice recordings may degrade your Alexa experience. \u201d Fox News Tech also explain in their article how you can stop Amazon Echo from listening to you altogether. Last month, a video of Amazon Echo turning off upon being asked about its ties to the C. I. A. went viral, prompting Breitbart Tech\u2019s Lucas Nolan to test it himself. \u201cWe asked the same questions that the woman in the original video asked, using a similar Echo Dot device to test the original video\u2019s validity,\u201d reported Nolan in March, however it appeared the device had been updated, if the video was ever valid at all. \u201cUpon being asked, \u2018Alexa, are you connected to the CIA?\u2019 the device did not shut down as seen in the original video. Instead, it responded, \u2018No, I work for Amazon.\u2019 Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
