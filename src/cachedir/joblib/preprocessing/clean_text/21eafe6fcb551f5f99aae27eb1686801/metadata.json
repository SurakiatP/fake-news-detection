Southwest said in a statement that passengers and airline employees were taken off Flight 994, which was scheduled to leave for Baltimore, after a customer reported \u201csmoke emitting from a Samsung electronic device. \u201d The Verge identified the passenger as Brian Green and his phone as \u201ca replacement Galaxy Note 7. \u201d A Samsung spokeswoman said in a statement on Wednesday that the company was unable to immediately confirm which device was involved in the episode. \u201cWe are working with the authorities and Southwest now to recover the device and confirm the cause,\u201d the statement said. \u201cOnce we have examined the device, we will have more information to share. \u201d The company, which is the world\u2019s largest smartphone maker, announced last month that it would replace 2. 5 million of the smartphone model because of a flaw in the battery\u2019s cell that could result in the devices bursting into flames or exploding. Mr. Green told The Verge that he had picked up the new phone on Sept. 21, after the recall. The episode could be damaging for the company, because the replacement devices were thought to be safe. The new models had been approved by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission, which on Wednesday said it was investigating the episode. In a statement, the commission chairman, Elliot F. Kaye, encouraged owners of the smartphone to turn it off and immediately participate in the recall. He also said staff members had reached out to the Federal Aviation Administration, Samsung and Mr. Green, noting that the agency is \u201cmoving expeditiously to investigate this incident. \u201d Christine Sundman, 65, a retired teacher who was planning to return home to New Hampshire after visiting her daughter\u2019s family in Louisville, was one of the passengers evacuated from the flight. She said that a woman sitting near the phone\u2019s owner had told her that the device had just been powered down when it caught fire. The owner quickly dropped the device on the floor, Mrs. Sundman said in a phone interview. Mrs. Sundman said she had been sitting in the seventh row of the plane and did not notice any commotion until a flight attendant rushed to the front to consult with her colleague. As they exchanged urgent whispers, Mrs. Sundman said, \u201cI did hear the word \u2018smoke.\u2019 \u201d The two flight attendants went into the cockpit, Mrs. Sundman said, and within seconds the captain came out and calmly told passengers that the plane had to be evacuated. She said he did not need to use the loudspeaker to make his voice heard. As the passengers disembarked, the smell of smoke began to permeate the plane. \u201cI did not see any of the passengers lose control,\u201d Mrs. Sundman said. \u201cOne woman was kind of buzzing around a lot, but nobody lost control. The airline was working as hard as it could. \u201d Mrs. Sundman said the passengers were eventually told that a hole had burned through the floor. After about two hours, she said, the flight was canceled and passengers were allowed back on the plane to recover their baggage. \u201cThis could have happened moments after we took off, or in the air,\u201d she said. \u201cIt could have been catastrophic. \u201d Earlier this year, Qantas  banned Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones from its flights because of instances in which they caught fire when   passengers dropped their devices into the electronically activated seats, crushing the phone and damaging the battery. Air France also said it had several   smoke or fire events that were set off in the same way. The Federal Aviation Administration strongly urged owners not to use the phones on planes, before the recall was ordered.'"}, "time": 1742562125.1147153}
