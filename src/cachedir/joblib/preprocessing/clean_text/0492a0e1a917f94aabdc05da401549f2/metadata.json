We\u2019re having record turnouts, the first day, the second day of voting. And it\u2019s not Bernie Sanders supporters coming out to support Hillary. It\u2019s not Barack Obama supporters coming out to support Hillary. It\u2019s a new surge of Trump voters, many who have never registered to vote. Many who have not voted in eight or ten elections so they\u2019re not reported in the polls\u2026 \u2026I know for a fact that the polls are off because they oversample Democrats by eight sometimes up to sixteen percent oversampling Democrats. They\u2019re oversampling women by five to eight percent. So the Republican vote is underreported. Plus there is no way to sample this extra twenty to twenty-five percent of new voters that are Trump voters. They\u2019re not Republican, they\u2019re not Democrats, they\u2019re pragmatists. They\u2019re tired of the status quo and they want change. YUGE RECORD BREAKING VOTES in TEXAS!!! & Its Not Bernie Fans or Obama Voters for Hillary Clinton!! ALLL Donald Trump Folks\ud83d\ude03 #wednesdaywisdom pic.twitter.com/Sn79fMhwXG'"}, "time": 1742628310.7228215}
