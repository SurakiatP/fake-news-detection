[According to The Jersey Journal, the messages sent from Davis include \u201cpleas from the mayor to have the woman meet him at an Atlantic City hotel and multiple references to oral sex. \u201d  \u201cI didn\u2019t tarnish Jimmy\u2019s reputation. He did that himself,\u201d said former city worker Stacie Percella, who was fired in December. \u201cMr. Mayor, again, resign from your position because my truth never changes. And I can say it inside out, backwards, forwards, every which way  \u2014   how many lies did Jimmy come up with so far?\u201d Davis, who is married, has recruited public relations firm Vision Media Marketing to oversee his public response to the incident. Vision Media Marketing\u2019s Amit Jani claims that the scandal is \u201cpart of an orchestrated campaign to make millions of dollars off of Bayonne taxpayers and destroy Mayor Davis\u2019 reputation. \u201d \u201cBefore her recent turn to this kind of unstable conduct, Mrs. Percella and Mayor Davis were longtime friends since childhood, and these text messages reflect that relationship,\u201d continued Jani in a statement. \u201cThey are nothing but harmless, playful banter between two adults. \u201d Despite Vision Media Marketing\u2019s claims that the messages were \u201cplayful banter between two adults,\u201d Davis allegedly made \u201cmultiple references to Percella\u2019s body parts,\u201d and asked her \u201cto meet him at a bar late at night. \u201d The Jersey Journal refused to print the exact contents of the messages \u201cbecause they are too explicit for a family newspaper. \u201d Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
