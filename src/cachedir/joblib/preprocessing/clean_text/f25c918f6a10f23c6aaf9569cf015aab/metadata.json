But the presence is largely symbolic, since Russia is still militarily superior in the region. \\nProtecting Lithuania from Russia is to be Germany\u2019s responsibility, according to the new NATO defense plans that emerged at this week\u2019s summit in Brussels. The German Defense Ministry showed on Wednesday evening just how seriously it is taking this task, confirming to the DPA news agency that next year it will be sending Leopard 2 tanks to the Baltic country\u2019s Russian border in addition to the 650 soldiers it had already promised \u2013 though it would not clarify how many. \\nThe move is part of NATO\u2019s wider plan to protect its Baltic members, who have all shown concern about Russian ambitions following the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the subsequent war in eastern Ukraine. \\nA NATO battalion of around 1,000 soldiers will be stationed in Lithuania as of June next year, and will then be rotated every six months. Around 450 to 650 of these troops are to be supplied by the Bundeswehr, while the others will come from France, Belgium and Croatia. German media reported that the combat-trained unit will also be equipped with tanks, armored vehicles, snipers, and engineers. \\nDefending the defensive measures \\nEach of the alliance\u2019s major powers is sending troops to bolster the defenses of the countries bordering Russia, so while Germany is helping Lithuania, Poland will be protected by the US, Latvia to be manned by the Canadians, and Britain is to help reinforce Estonia. \\nThe plans are likely to further antagonize Russia, whose government has criticized NATO\u2019s military plans in the region before. \u201cThe alliance is concentrating its forces on limiting a non-existent threat from the East,\u201d the Russian Foreign Ministry said in the summer. \\nGerman Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen defended the measures, calling the deployment \u201cexactly appropriate\u201d and \u201cdefensive.\u201d\u201cThis is a clear signal that an attack on one NATO country will be considered an attack on all 28 NATO countries,\u201d she said.NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg also indicated that the mission was a response to Russian aggression. \u201cRussia is prepared to use its military power,\u201d he said in Brussels. \u201cIt is necessary for NATO to answer that.\u201d \\nGustav Gressel, Russia specialist at the European Council on Foreign Relations, believes that NATO\u2019s new plans are actually fairly measured, given the circumstances. \u201cRussia still enjoys military superiority in that area of about five-to-one,\u201d he told DW. \u201cIt\u2019s not at all an offensive threat against the Russians \u2013 but rather a cautious, small-scale reaction to the build-up and military mobilization Russia has been undergoing. It doesn\u2019t change the military balance in the Baltics.\u201d \\nStoltenberg said NATO had no choice but to respond \\nIn fact, the Baltic states would have liked NATO to commit more troops to their border areas, Gressel argued. \u201cSince 2009, Russia has trained its forces in scenarios of invading the Baltic countries,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the Baltic countries, this is a real thing, this is not something that might at some point happen.\u201d \\nEven though it is economically isolated and can ill afford to take new territory, Russia\u2019s political system requires shows of military power for its own population, Gressel argued. \u201cIt is increasingly difficult to predict what Russia will do, or when Russia will perceive military provocation. So you\u2019d rather be on the safe side and signal to Russia that there is no free ride in the Baltics.\u201d \\nBut at the same time, NATO is trying to strike a balance. \u201cYou have to hedge against the risk that Russia gets adventurous,\u201d he said. \u201cBut on the other hand, you don\u2019t want to maneuver Russia into its self-fulfilling prophecies of a threat. In my view, Russia\u2019s saber-rattling is for domestic consumption and their military knows that NATO is not going to invade.\u201d \\nGermany has contributed to NATO\u2019s biggest rearmament drive since the end of the Cold War, last year ordering an extra 100 Leopard 2 tanks \u2013 mostly by modifying previously decommissioned vehicles. At the same time, the upper limit of 225 tanks that had been agreed as part of the military reform of 2011 was increased to 328.'"}, "time": 1742564452.2402945}
