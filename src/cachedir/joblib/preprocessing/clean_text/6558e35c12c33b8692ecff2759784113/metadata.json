John Kasich ( ) called on those on the extreme ends and of the political spectrum to be marginalized.  Kasich said, \u201cWell, there\u2019s a way to improve all of this and to safe money and transform the system. look, if you\u2019re on the extreme, whether you\u2019re on the right or whether you\u2019re on the left, you ought to be marginalized. That\u2019s what happens when you bring reasonable Republicans with reasonable Democrats together and then you begin to see the extremes start to move a little bit to be more constructive. Right now when you start with a deck that\u2019s only limited number of cards, then you don\u2019t have a big hand to play. \u201d \u201cFrankly, if Republicans quietly over time will reach out to Democrats, find the constructive ones, you will begin to marginalize the extremes,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou know what, when people say in my state, we should drop 700, 000 people, a third of whom are mentally ill or drug addicted and a quarter of whom are chronically ill, we should turn our back on them? That\u2019s not America. That\u2019s not a country that loves all of its citizens. That\u2019s really extreme. Frankly, it borders on mean. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742561827.5254912}
