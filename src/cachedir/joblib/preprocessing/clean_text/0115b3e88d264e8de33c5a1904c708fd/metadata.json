He died in the carnage Thursday night. So did Brodie Copeland, 11, who was visiting from the United States. Haroun El Kamel, 12, survived but might never look at fireworks the same way. Then there was Laura Borla, 14, who came to see the fireworks with her twin sister and their mother but was separated from them in the chaos. After days of searching frantically for her, Laura\u2019s family learned on Sunday morning that she was dead. \u201cWe miss you already we will love you always,\u201d her    sister, Lucie, said in a Facebook post. The driver who plowed his truck into crowds at the conclusion of the Bastille Day fireworks in Nice killed at least 84 people and injured hundreds more. The trauma was exacerbated by the presence of a large number of children, whose deaths, injuries and psychological scars gave this attack  \u2014   like the one in March that killed many children at a park in Pakistan, or the recent slaughter of families celebrating the end of Ramadan in Baghdad  \u2014   an especially brutal feel and underscored its indiscriminate cruelty. At least 10 children were killed Thursday night, and at least 35 were treated for injuries at hospitals in Nice. Others were separated from their parents in the chaos, and some no doubt saw and heard things they might carry with them for a long time. No one who was visiting the waterfront that night could have imagined such a horrific ending. Going to the fireworks on July 14 is an annual family ritual in Nice, a time for picnics on the beach  \u2014   and, when the beach is too full, for spreading tablecloths on the meridian of the waterfront road known for more than 150 years as the Promenade des Anglais. From there, people have a fine view of the sea and the extravagant fireworks display. \u201cYou have to bring your children because if you don\u2019t, you will pay for it all year  \u2014   all their friends are there,\u201d said Raja El Kamel, 43, Haroun\u2019s mother, who was with him and a close friend from Sweden and her two children to watch the festivities. In a city that enjoys a party, the July 14 fireworks are especially beloved because the entire community joins in: Christian and Muslim, religious and secular, but French above all. The presence of large numbers of tourists gives the evening even more of a festive feel. For    Yanis and his parents, Mickael and Samira Coviaux, the evening was a first. The parents, both truck drivers, live in Grenoble, and this was their first time seeing the July 14 fireworks on the Mediterranean as a family, said Yanis\u2019s aunt Ana\u00efs Coviaux, a law student in Paris, who came to support her brother and    after Yanis was killed. \u201cThe children were playing among themselves, and they had their back to the road,\u201d she said. \u201cThey did not hear the truck until just one second before it hit. It went up on the sidewalk it struck Yanis and the mother of one of the other children with them. \u201d The mother also died. There was no first aid nearby. Finally, Mr. Coviaux picked up his little boy and began walking with him until they found a person with a car who agreed to take them to the hospital. When they passed some firefighters, they stopped and asked them to try to revive him. But the child was dead. \u201cHe was my parents\u2019 only grandson, the only grandson in the family,\u201d Ana\u00efs Coviaux said softly. She explained that her brother and his wife were too distraught to speak. \u201cYanis loved people,\u201d she said. \u201cHe especially liked Sundays when all the family was gathered, and he would say, \u2018Mamie and Papi, we are going to have a party. \u2019\u201d Later, Mr. Coviaux said in an email that \u201cevery single person that Yanis met in his short life fell in love with him. \u201d The entire family gathered on the promenade Saturday to view the last sights he had seen. \u201cIt was important for us to come to the place he died to pay him a tribute,\u201d Ana\u00efs Coviaux said, \u201cbecause we could not bear to say goodbye to him. We left a picture of him and flowers. \u201d Identifying children and examining them has been difficult because of the level of trauma and because some were brought to the hospital without relatives, said Sylvie Serret, a child psychiatrist at the Lenval Foundation hospital, which treated at least 30 injured children on Thursday night. \u201cA lot of the children coming in were in a state of shock they were not speaking, for instance,\u201d she said. An emergency room nurse at Pasteur Hospital, Mejdi Chemakhi, cared for several children, including a boy and a girl who had been brought in without their parents. The boy was 4, Mr. Chemakhi said, and the girl was 6. The boy, Mr. Chemakhi recounted, spoke in a flat tone, apparently in shock. \u201cMy mummy is dead, but my daddy is still alive,\u201d he recalled the boy saying over and over. The boy, expressionless, finally said, \u201cI am tired, I need to sleep, I have no clothes,\u201d Mr. Chemakhi recalled. \u201cSo I took him in my arms and tried to console him,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t really know what else to do in those situations. It is really important to make them feel safe. \u201d Later that night, a wounded man was brought to the hospital and told Mr. Chemakhi that he had lost his wife and could not find his children, a boy and a girl. Mr. Chemakhi realized the three belonged together and helped reunite them. On the Promenade des Anglais on Saturday, there were memorials of flowers and notes, sometimes every few feet, to mark where people had lost their lives. Nathalie Russo, 30, a Muslim who wears a hijab, came with her mother to retrace the steps she and her children,    Mayssa and    Emine, took on Thursday night. \u201cMy daughter is telling me that she does not want to see fireworks again,\u201d Ms. Russo said, adding, \u201cShe kept asking me, \u2018How did the bad people get from Paris to Nice? \u2019\u201d \u201cShe thought the man who did this was one of those who attacked the Bataclan,\u201d she said, \u201cand he had come here to do the same thing. \u201d The Bataclan is the Paris concert hall where 90 people were shot dead by three Islamic State operatives on Nov. 13, when a total of 130 people were killed in and around Paris by terrorists. Some mothers and fathers who had not been near the fireworks brought their children to see the memorials on Saturday as a way of expressing unity with the community and defiance toward the terrorists. Nour Hamila, a Nice native who has converted to Islam, made a point of bringing her three children, who are 8, 5 and 3. \u201cI told them not to be afraid because that\u2019s what the terrorists want we have to support each other,\u201d she said as her    son, Mohamed, placed flowers on one of the memorials. It is harder for those children who witnessed the killings. For Ms. Kamel\u2019s    son, Haroun, the moment is etched in his mind. \u201cWe saw it from far away, a white truck in this black night,\u201d she said. She recalled thinking that the truck did not belong there because the street was closed to traffic. Her son and her friend\u2019s    son and    daughter were playing and laughing. Then the driver accelerated and began to veer from one side of the road to the other, \u201cplowing into people,\u201d she said. Somehow she pushed herself and her son onto the sidewalk as the truck neared. Then it passed, and all she remembers was her son saying, \u201cMama, Mama, you must come to help the people. \u201d She looked at the road and recognized a neighbor who was kneeling next to her husband, wailing his name. Ms. Kamel told her son to go with her friend and the other children. Everything was silent. \u201cThere was just this terrible wind,\u201d she said. \u201cTo the left you saw bodies you looked right and saw bodies there were strollers, and people trying to save other people. \u201d After trying to comfort her neighbor, she looked for her son, but by then the crowds were running, and it was chaos. Hours later, when she found him and her friend, her son said, \u201cMama, did you manage to save the man?\u201d Ms. Kamel responded that the emergency services had come for him. \u201cYou know, children don\u2019t have a global vision,\u201d she said. \u201cHe saw all those corpses, but for him, the one at his feet was supposed to be saved. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562120.1238484}
