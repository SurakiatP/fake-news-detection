What does that say about the legitimacy of the upcoming election if one candidate on the ballot cheated to get there and is thus not legitimately entitled to stand for election in the general at all? \\nWhat if the evidence shows how people \u201cdivested\u201d and transferred financial interest in foreign firms so as to evade federal reporting requirements that would have otherwise triggered scrutiny on some of the Foundation\u2019s deals?\\nWhat if Friday afternoon comes and goes, Saturday, Sunday and Monday come and go, all or a sufficiently-damning group of the above turn out to be true and as a result the person who was at the center of all of these things stands to be able to pardon herself and everyone else associated with what would be, quite-arguably, the most outrageous series of acts of public corruption in our nation\u2019s history? \\nThat we are here, just a few days before an election, that we have a DOJ that has actively obstructed the investigation for at least months if not longer and has a history of doing this during Obama\u2019s Presidency, including I remind you with \u201cFast-n-Furious\u201d where a whole bunch of people got killed as a result of our government\u2019s illegal gun-running is an outrage.\\nThe only thing more-outrageous than what has already happened would be if we were to get to Monday night, on the eve of voting, and all of those \u201cWhat Ifs\u201d up above remained unanswered.\\nOh wait, I tricked you and I admit it \u2014 some of those \u201cwhat ifs\u201d \u2014 including some truly damning ones \u2014 have already been answered in the affirmative. \\nIf you know the answers to any of the remaining questions \u2014 not a belief of what the answers might be but you are in possession of hard facts that prove any of the above, either in the positive or negative, you have a duty to this Republic and the people in it to make those answers known. \\nIf you do not then you stand as equally responsible for every \u201cYes\u201d answer that is ultimately proved, and the harm that comes to this Republic as a consequence. \\nOriginally posted at Market Ticker .\\n'"}, "time": 1742563155.4408925}
