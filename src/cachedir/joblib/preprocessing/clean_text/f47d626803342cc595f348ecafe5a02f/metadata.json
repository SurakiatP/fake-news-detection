Mrs. May said in a television interview with the BBC that she had \u201cabsolute faith in our Trident missiles. \u201d But she would not say whether she had known about the failure or whether, as The Sunday Times of London reported, it had been covered up by Downing Street under her predecessor, David Cameron, shortly before the referendum on Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union. Mrs. May did not mention any missile failure in her first major speech to Parliament on July 18, when she persuaded Parliament to spend up to 40 billion pounds, or about $53 billion then, on four new submarines to keep Britain\u2019s nuclear deterrent up to date. \u201cThere are tests that take place all the time, regularly, for our nuclear deterrence,\u201d she said on Sunday. \u201cWhat we were talking about in that debate that took place was about the future. \u201d The Sunday Times reported that the Trident II D5 missile, which was designed to carry a nuclear warhead but was unarmed for the test, had veered off course after being fired from HMS Vengeance, one of Britain\u2019s four aging   submarines. The British Navy had not performed such a test for four years because of the expense of the missile, but had carried out tests in 2000, 2005, 2009 and 2012, all of which had been successful and publicized by the Ministry of Defense. The current test took place after the submarine had been refitted with new missile launch equipment and upgraded computer systems. Replacing Trident has been controversial because of the cost and because the current leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, long an antinuclear campaigner, is opposed to retaining Britain\u2019s nuclear deterrent, while his party\u2019s official position has been to retain and renew it. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty catastrophic error when a missile goes in the wrong direction, and while it wasn\u2019t armed, goodness knows what the consequences of that could have been,\u201d Mr. Corbyn said on Sunday. Speaking to Sky News, he said, \u201cWe understand the prime minister chose not to inform Parliament, and instead it came out through the media. \u201d He repeated his belief that Britain should commit to nuclear disarmament. Kevan Jones, a Labour member of Parliament and a former defense minister, called for an inquiry into the failed missile test. \u201cThe U. K.\u2019s independent nuclear deterrent is a vital cornerstone for the nation\u2019s defense,\u201d he said. Parliament is likely to ask Defense Secretary Michael Fallon to answer questions about the report. Separately, Mrs. May confirmed that she would meet with President Trump in Washington on Friday in the first visit of a foreign leader to the new president, a traditional prize that Britain has been seeking avidly. She said she would emphasize to Mr. Trump the importance of the NATO military alliance, calling it a \u201cbulwark\u201d of the West, and would say that Britain favors the progress and cohesion of the European Union, even though the country plans to leave the bloc. Trade will be an important topic, she said, with Britain wanting new   agreements with key countries, including the United States, after it leaves the European Union. Mr. Trump, a supporter of \u201cBrexit,\u201d as Britain\u2019s departure from the bloc is known, has said that he is open to early talks on such a deal with Britain. Legally, no new deal can be made until Britain formally leaves the European Union, which is unlikely for at least two years. Mr. Trump\u2019s slogan of \u201cAmerica First\u201d and his protectionist comments may mean that a trade deal will be difficult to negotiate despite the good will expressed by both sides. Mrs. May was asked about Mr. Trump\u2019s attitudes toward women. \u201cI\u2019ve already said that some of the comments that Donald Trump has made in relation to women are unacceptable, some of those he himself has apologized for,\u201d she said. When she meets Mr. Trump, she said, \u201cI think the biggest statement that will be made about the role of women is the fact that I will be there as a female prime minister. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564270.349045}
