[The Chronicle notes:  Their biggest fear is a repeat of what happened to Occupy earlier this decade, when black bloc violence chased away nonviolent, mainstream protesters  \u2014   and helped lead to Occupy\u2019s collapse about five years ago. \u201cThat stuff that happened at UC Berkeley with the black bloc was just nuts, doesn\u2019t help,\u201d said longtime protester Buck Bagot, who helped organize the Occupy movement in San Francisco and has been mobilizing demonstrations against Trump. \u201cPeople need to make sure this incredibly negative, destructive element isn\u2019t there in what we do this time. \u201d Its adherents saw Occupy as a   call against income inequality. But many of them say Occupy fell short of being more than that, partly because violent anarchists came to be the   face of the movement to the broader public. The Occupy Wall Street and Occupy protests took over public spaces for several weeks, throughout the country and abroad. Activists  \u2014   and not just \u201cBlack bloc\u201d members  \u2014   often sought confrontations with police. Some did so as a deliberate tactic to gain public attention and sympathy through police overreaction. The encampments, which excluded law enforcement, soon became rife with lawlessness, including a pattern of sexual assaults. While most protesters were peaceful, others were not, and the violent contingent went far beyond the \u201cBlack bloc. \u201d President Barack Obama and his party supported the Occupy movement, and the media was broadly sympathetic. Violence and lawlessness turned public opinion decisively against the protests, which also proved unsustainable as the onset of winter made camping outside intolerable in most cities. Joel B.
