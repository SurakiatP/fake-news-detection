Then, in 2011, her sister, Laura Webb Elody, was killed along with seven other people  as she worked at a hair salon in nearby Seal Beach. For weeks, Ms. Webb wanted revenge. And the local district attorney promised she would get it in the form of the death penalty. But five years later, the man who killed her sister and wounded her mother is still alive, and Ms. Webb is now helping to lead the campaign to abolish the death penalty here. Tami Alexander has waited even longer. The man who killed her    and    has been on death row for more than two decades. The death penalty has long been one of the most contentious issues in the state. Though California has executed only 13 people since the 1970s, it has sentenced hundreds to death and has more prisoners on death row than any other state. California has repeatedly been criticized for keeping those people in a suspended state for years, costing Californians billions of dollars. There have been attempts before to reform the system  \u2014   just four years ago a ballot proposition failed in its effort to abolish the death penalty entirely. Now voters are being presented with their latest choice in the matter: Should the state get out of the business of capital punishment completely or enact a plan to make executions happen more quickly? Both proposals accept that the state\u2019s death penalty system  \u2014   which costs an estimated $150 million a year for trials, appeals and death row facilities  \u2014   is broken. The state\u2019s process is so prolonged, \u201cwith only the remote possibility of death,\u201d that it is tantamount to cruel and unusual punishment, a federal judge wrote in a 2014 ruling, calling the system dysfunctional and arbitrary. The 747 inmates on death row remain in a legal limbo: There has not been an execution in the state since 2006, as the state\u2019s lethal injection protocol remains tied up in the courts. This year, voters will decide between two competing ballot measures: Proposition 62, which would end the death penalty and replace it with life without parole, and Proposition 66, which would speed up the executions by accelerating appeals for inmates on death row. A victory for either side will transform the state\u2019s system for capital punishment. When the death penalty was last on the state ballot, the focus remained primarily on money  \u2014   with opponents arguing that the state was spending billions without executing anyone. In California, most inmates spend at least two decades on death row. Far more have died from natural causes or suicide than have been executed. After the measure to repeal it lost by four percentage points in 2012, supporters of the death penalty quickly pulled together to find a way to get their proposal to voters as quickly as possible. \u201cWe knew we needed to say to California voters as quickly as possible that we have to get this fixed,\u201d said Mike Ramos, the San Bernardino district attorney and one of the leading proponents of Proposition 66. \u201cCitizens are getting rightly frustrated that we are holding the worst of the worst, people who are evil, on hold indefinitely. The families would like justice, the people want justice, and what we have does not work. \u201d This time, the arguments are as much about moral and philosophical issues as financial, with Ms. Webb and Ms. Alexander each seen as key advocates for the opposing measures. \u201cThere is no way to know how much hatred you have in your heart until someone you know is murdered,\u201d Ms. Webb said in a recent interview. \u201cThat\u2019s what the people who want this understand  \u2014   the frustration of somebody doing this to you and you not being able to do anything is overwhelming. \u201d Though national polls show that a majority of voters favor the death penalty, there have been notable victories in attempts to repeal it. In the past decade, legislatures in New Jersey, New Mexico and Illinois have all voted to end it, and other governors have declared moratoriums on executions. And two other states  \u2014   Oklahoma and Nebraska  \u2014   will also vote on ballot propositions this year. \u201cThere are a few counties that are overproducing death penalties, and it is coming at an enormous cost to everyone in the state,\u201d said Robert Dunham, the executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center. \u201cYou no longer have to be against the death penalty in theory to be against the way the death penalty is practiced in the United States. We used to look at it dogmatically, and now we are looking at it pragmatically. \u201d While opponents of the death penalty argue that eliminating death row would save $150 million, supporters similarly argue that speeding up the process would save the state more money in the long run. Proposition 66 would force courts to process death penalty cases more quickly, but opponents of the measure say there are not enough lawyers with the ability to handle the cases to move cases off the docket. \u201cOur family doesn\u2019t care if it takes 100 years if it\u2019s a case where the innocence is in question, but that\u2019s not what happens,\u201d Ms. Alexander said. \u201cWhat happens is that we wait an eternity for someone who is already found guilty and that a jury found deserves to die. They can appeal over and over again on things that have nothing to do with the crime itself. \u201d And the delays in execution, once an exception, are now routine for myriad reasons. In addition to the guilt phase of a criminal trial, the penalty phase can go on for years as lawyers compile thick histories of the suspect\u2019s criminal and mental health record, and few defense lawyers are interested in taking on such cases, said Ellen S. Kreitzberg, a law professor at Santa Clara University who has studied how the death penalty is carried out in California. \u201cIn the counties where you have a lot of death penalty cases, you\u2019ve got 35 percent of a court\u2019s staff time spent on those,\u201d she said. \u201cThat means the system is not working. It\u2019s not equipped to deal with this. \u201d Ms. Webb said it was not until her sister\u2019s case began to drag on that she began to rethink her views on the death penalty. \u201cThe offer that the death penalty is somehow going to relieve your pain is on so many levels unfair,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause what they are saying is that if you hold on to that anger long enough we are going to release it for you when we murder this person. But I cannot live with the idea that somebody else\u2019s death is going to set me free. It would validate the very thing that he did. \u201d Ron Briggs, who helped draft a ballot measure expanding application of the death penalty in 1978 and was one of the leading proponents of the attempt to repeal it in 2012, said that despite the narrow loss, he thought a quick return to the ballot was the best way to persuade voters to end capital punishment in the state. \u201cThat gives all the closure the family needs and ends these endless appeals,\u201d Mr. Briggs said. \u201cI think Republicans and fiscal conservatives are really beginning to get the message that this is costing a lot of money and not doing a lot of good. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628597.186859}
