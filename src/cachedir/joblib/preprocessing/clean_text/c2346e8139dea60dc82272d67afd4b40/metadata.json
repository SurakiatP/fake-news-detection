[This year\u2019s   dinner, which is set to take place April 29th, will feature members of Donald Trump\u2019s administration and large swathes of media members. But the president, as he announced in February, won\u2019t be attending the event.  Minhaj, however, a relatively unknown figure, has made a habit of hitting Donald Trump with personal insults. The Daily Show star called Trump \u201cWhite ISIS\u201d during last year\u2019s primaries and was featured in a recent Daily Show segment that highlighted the president\u2019s greatest tweet of all time. . @roywoodjr and @hasanminhaj announce the greatest Trump tweet of all time. pic. twitter.   \u2014   The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) April 6, 2017,  Minhaj also mocked President Trump in a statement thanking the WHCA for selecting him to host. \u201cIt is a tremendous honor to be a part of such a historic event even though the president has chosen not to attend this year. SAD!\u201d Minhaj said. \u201cNow more than ever, it is vital that we honor the First Amendment and the freedom of the press. \u201d While the WHCA dinner tends to feature a comedian who mocks the president and the press, the WHCA chief says picking an   host was not the message his organization wanted to send. \u201cI was not looking for somebody who was going to roast the president in absentia. That\u2019s not fair, and that\u2019s not the message that we want to get across,\u201d WHCA president Jeff Mason said Tuesday on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe. \u201cI was looking for somebody who is funny and who is entertaining, because I want the dinner to be entertaining, but who can also speak to the message that the whole dinner is going to speak to   \u2026     the importance of a free press. \u201d Nevertheless, Minhaj\u2019s being selected to headline the WHCA dinner will likely parallel the event\u2019s past jeering of Trump. At 2011\u2019s dinner, Trump was skewered by both Barack Obama and that night\u2019s comedic relief Seth Myers. And if Minhaj goes full   while hosting, the WHCA dinner will likely intensify the hostility between the president and the media.
