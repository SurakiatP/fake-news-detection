The box office was weak and the big Hollywood releases were weaker. Critics were grumpy. Audiences seemed indifferent. There was so much good television. And so the band struck up the funeral march, as it does every year, and the obituaries circulated on social media. Cinema is dead. (Again.) The donning of sackcloth and ashes for this   art form is an annual ritual. But so is the Telluride Film Festival, which functions partly as a standing rebuke to such fatalism and gloom. The beauty of the mountain setting and this elegant former mining town\u2019s distance from the stresses of New York, Los Angeles and Toronto have a way of dispelling pessimism. More consequentially, the festival here is a gathering of the faithful, consecrated to the   cinephile religion. The local school gym and a hockey rink on the edge of town are temporarily converted into what screening M. C.\u2019s unironically refer to as cathedrals of cinema. Everyone is a believer. Telluride began in the   largely as a place to show old, rare and restored films, a commitment that survives in a robust program of classics and curiosities presented by prominent guest directors. And it seduces audiences with the promise that the future of film  \u2014   the art if not the photochemical medium  \u2014   will be as glorious as the past. Maybe this is mythmaking or wishful thinking, but having spent a few days here in the dark I prefer to regard it as hardheaded realism. Whatever the state of the industry or the prevailing winds in the culture and the digital economy, the integrity and specificity of cinema is a fact. And its vital signs are strong. Damien Chazelle\u2019s \u201cLa La Land\u201d is both an example of and an argument for the uniqueness of movies. A lavish and lovely musical romance, it is set in a Los Angeles populated by   creative strivers. Two of these, a jazz pianist named Seb (Ryan Gosling) and a thesp (as the trades would say) named Mia (Emma Stone) meet cute in a gigantic traffic jam that doubles as a    extravaganza. The next two hours follow the entwined, contrapuntal progress of their relationship and their careers, punctuated by more songs and ending in a swirl of piercing and complex emotion. \u201cLa La Land\u201d is simultaneously a   throwback and a   gamble. Mr. Chazelle, whose previous features were \u201cWhiplash\u201d and \u201cGuy and Madeline on a Park Bench,\u201d affectionately nods at the tradition of movie musicals, invoking the MGM Technicolor gems of the \u201950s and Jacques Demy\u2019s \u201cThe Umbrellas of Cherbourg. \u201d But even though his Los Angeles has a decidedly retro vibe, there is something more than nostalgia at work here. At 31, Mr. Chazelle doesn\u2019t just want to summon the old magic. He also wants to modernize it. The tantalizing question is whether, after the hosannas from critics here and at the Venice Film Festival, modern, millennial audiences will allow themselves to fall under the spell. My hunch is they will: The mixture of antiquarian precision and entrepreneurial   that drives \u201cLa La Land\u201d will be embraced by a generation for whom preservation and invention often go together. It will, in any case, reward literal moviegoers, those hardy souls willing to switch off the flat screen, silence the cellphone and sit quietly in a roomful of strangers. Cinema is an art form, but it is also a destination, a reason to get out of the house. From the viewer\u2019s perspective, a movie is a nondomestic, nonserial experience, enclosed in time and space and, ideally, lingering in the mind after the lights go on and you stumble out into the world. Your perception is at least momentarily altered. A film festival is a collection of such experiences, an archipelago of   worlds. You could drift from \u201cLa La Land\u201d to Denis Villeneuve\u2019s \u201cArrival,\u201d an eerie and emotional   movie that similarly evokes and updates the grandeur and mystery of past   masterpieces. It shares some DNA with \u201c2001\u201d and \u201cSolaris,\u201d and stars Amy Adams as a linguist wrestling with grief and an imposing research assignment. Twelve   black spaceships are hovering over Earth, and she must use her professional skills to figure out what their   inhabitants want. \u201cArrival\u201d is an elegant puzzle, an engrossing exercise in    \u2014   for the protagonist, the filmmaker and the viewer alike. Mr. Villeneuve, assisted by Bradford Young\u2019s haunting cinematography and Johann Johannsson\u2019s menacing, melancholy score, creates a heady, sensual atmosphere in which the boundaries between thinking and feeling are artfully blurred. Which may just be another way of repeating that it\u2019s a movie, rather than a franchise installment or a piece of   digital entertainment. Maybe that sounds overly defensive. It\u2019s hard, watching four or five films a day amid crowds of fellow pilgrims, to believe that you\u2019re participating in something marginal, obsolescent or beleaguered. There are too many revelations, large and small. There is the exquisite lyricism and deep feeling of \u201cMoonlight,\u201d Barry Jenkins\u2019s astonishing second feature, about a young black man\u2019s coming of age in three piercing chapters. The film cracks open stereotypes and wears its empathy and its artistry on its sleeve. There is the prickly wit and delicious complication of \u201cNorman: The Moderate Rise and Tragic Fall of a New York Fixer,\u201d Joseph Cedar\u2019s ebullient   comedy, with Richard Gere in the title role. There is the philosophical mischief of \u201cInto the Inferno,\u201d the latest documentary adventure from Werner Herzog, which follows him to the edges of volcanoes in search of cosmic meaning and human peculiarity. And then there are treasures in transit from Sundance, Berlin and Cannes, arriving on vapor trails of enthusiasm. Among these are Cristian Mungiu\u2019s \u201cGraduation,\u201d Kenneth Lonergan\u2019s \u201cManchester by the Sea,\u201d Mia  \u2019s \u201cThings to Come\u201d and, above all, Maren Ade\u2019s \u201cToni Erdmann. \u201d Each one in its own way constitutes proof of life for movies. All of them, curiously, dwell at least partly on the complexities of parenthood. \u201cManchester\u201d is a lacerating, but also frequently funny, study of the long aftermath of grief, with Casey Affleck as a man damaged by past trauma trying to help his nephew (Lucas Hedges). \u201cGraduation\u201d is about a Romanian doctor\u2019s ethical struggles as he tries to help his daughter find a better future by studying abroad. \u201cThings to Come\u201d is a quiet midlife drama in which a philosophy professor (Isabelle Huppert) navigates disruptions in her family and her inner life. \u201cToni Erdmann,\u201d though. If a single movie were enough to silence reports of the death of cinema, it would be this one, an    German comedy set mostly in Bucharest. It you think that sounds preposterous, you\u2019re not wrong. I hesitate to offer further description, since any attempt to characterize this film in conventional terms  \u2014   as a   story, a feminist satire of corporate behavior, a fable of global capitalism, an extended practical joke  \u2014   would be woefully insufficient. It\u2019s something new under the sun, a thrilling and discomfiting document of the present moment and also, like every movie that matters, a bulletin from the future.'"}, "time": 1742562119.2666838}
