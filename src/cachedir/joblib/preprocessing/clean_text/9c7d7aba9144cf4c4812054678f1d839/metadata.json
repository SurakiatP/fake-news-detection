[\u201cSoftware engineers from the city lag much behind those from other Indian cities when it comes to programming skills, a recent Aspiring Minds study of over 36, 000 engineering students in India showed,\u201d reported Quartz. \u201cThe employability assessment company tested students from   streams at over 500 colleges across India on Automata, a machine   assessment of software development skills. \u201d  The results showed that those in New Delhi were the best programmers, followed by Mumbai. At number three came Bengaluru, with half of the points as those in Mumbai, followed by Chennai and Kolkata. In very last place, with a total of 4. 7 points in programming ability and 4. 76 points in programming practices, came Hyderabad. The best city, New Delhi, received 26. 63 points for programming ability and 27. 16 points for programming practices in comparison. \u201cHyderabad, India, sent the largest number of STEM students (20, 800) to the United States and ranked fourth for the percentage of its students pursuing a STEM degree (80%) during the   period,\u201d declared the report. \u201cNotably, 91% of students from Hyderabad are studying for a master\u2019s degree, versus only 4% for a bachelor\u2019s degree. \u201d \u201cLack of programming skills is adversely impacting the IT and data science ecosystems in India,\u201d said Varun Aggarwal,   of Aspiring Minds, which oversaw the study. \u201cThe world is moving towards introducing programming to   . India needs to catch up. \u201d Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech. You can follow him on Twitter @MrNashington or like his page at Facebook.'"}, "time": 1742562010.7635927}
