That might be between China and some other countries in this region. \u201d  Lu\u2019s remarks on bilateral relations with the United States were significantly sharper in tone than those of his boss, Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who said in recent remarks that Beijing\u2019s Communist Party would like to \u201cincrease mutual trust, focus cooperation, manage and control disputes and promote the healthy development of   relations, to bring even greater benefits to both peoples. \u201d Spicer had said during his regular press briefing on Monday that the United States would play a role in protecting the territorial integrity of the South China Sea. \u201cIf those islands are, in fact, in international waters and not part of China proper, yeah, we\u2019ll make sure we defend international interests from being taken over by one country. \u201d Spicer\u2019s comments appeared to irritate Chinese officials still objecting to remarks by incoming Secretary of State Rex Tillerson about the region. In a Senate hearing otherwise largely devoid of definitive answers on major international disputes, Tillerson vowed to play a role in protecting the interests of nations whose land and sea China claimed as its own in the region. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to send China a clear signal that, first, the   stops and, second, your access to those islands also is not going to be allowed,\u201d he told a Senate committee, comparing China\u2019s usurpation of South China Sea territory to Russia\u2019s invasion and colonization of Crimea. China claims the territory within a border Beijing refers to as the \u201c  line. \u201d Within that line is territory belonging to the Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan, Brunei, and Malaysia, as well as some waters close to Natuna Island, Indonesia. China has constructed numerous artificial islands in the Spratly and Paracel Islands and the Scarborough Shoal, challenging the sovereignty of the Philippines and Vietnam. China has filled some of those islands with military assets, which the United States has repeatedly protested as threat to the international community. China\u2019s official party line on the region appears to be that only the United States continues to protest their presence in waters not belonging to sovereign China. \u201cCountries have already come back to the original agreement that maybe for the time being we could set aside those sovereign disputes, and focus on some joint developments, and working together to maintain the peace and stability in this region,\u201d Lu told NBC. Lu appeared to mostly be referring to the Philippines, which won a case at the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague over China\u2019s illegal construction, but has since backed down of its objection to China\u2019s territorial pursuits under President Rodrigo Duterte. His predecessor, Benigno Aquino, was the one to bring the case to the Hague. While the Trump administration appears to be making the liberation of the colonized South China Sea a priority, President Barack Obama had also engaged China on the matter. Former Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter attended military exercises in the region and often repeated the U. S. policy of having the American military \u201cfly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows. \u201d The Defense Department also staged numerous \u201cfreedom of navigation\u201d exercises in the region, much to China\u2019s chagrin. Critics argue, however, that the Obama administration\u2019s guest passages through the South China Sea did not actively challenge China\u2019s adverse possession claims on the artificial islands and, as such, were more of a \u201cPR stunt\u201d than effective deterrence.'"}, "time": 1742563411.3055563}
