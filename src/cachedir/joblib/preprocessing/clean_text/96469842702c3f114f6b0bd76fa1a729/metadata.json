Lisa Bloom just said her client was \u201cliving in fear\u201d and did not want to show her face and ended the press conference. \\n\u2014 Christopher Hayes (@chrislhayes) November 2, 2016 \\nThe pressures that face the female accusers of powerful white men couldn\u2019t be more clear right now. One of Trump\u2019s sexual assault accusers has already fled the country due to threats from his rabid supporters.\u201c We feel the backlash of the Trump supporters. It scares us. It intimidates us. We are in fear of our lives,\u201d said Mindy McGillivray, who said Trump groped her at a party. \u201cI look out the window and there are cars just driving around the house and looking, slowing down right at the house. I don\u2019t live in a gated community. This is dangerous. There could be people out there who want to hurt us.\u2019\u2019 \\nThe pressure to stay silent comes just as strong from the Trump camp itself \u2013 just look at how Michael Cohen, special counsel for the Trump Organization, responded to Daily Beast when they called asking for comment on a story about how Trump raped then-wife Ivana Trump in a painful and brutal fashion: \\nI will make sure that you and I meet one day while we\u2019re in the courthouse. And I will take you for every penny you still don\u2019t have. And I will come after your Daily Beast and everybody else that you possibly know. So I\u2019m warning you, tread very fucking lightly, because what I\u2019m going to do to you is going to be fucking disgusting. You understand me?\u201d \\n\u201cYou write a story that has Mr. Trump\u2019s name in it, with the word \u2018rape,\u2019 and I\u2019m going to mess your life up\u2026 for as long as you\u2019re on this frickin\u2019 planet\u2026 you\u2019re going to have judgments against you, so much money, you\u2019ll never know how to get out from underneath it.\u2019 \\nWhich begs the question, why so defensive if there is nothing to hide, Mr. Trump? \\nDonald Trump\u2019s followers are some of the lowest, most hateful scum to ever tarnish American soil. Klansmen, neo-Nazis, white supremacists. They send death threats to anyone who dares to speak out against him \u2013 if you\u2019re lucky. You could receive horrifying, personalized attacks like a Jewish writer for the National Review did: \\nGiven the ease with which Trump supporters will bring violence on the innocent , it is no wonder that these women are reluctant to come forward. This is the culture of fear that Donald Trump has created \u2013 and one which will consume our whole nation if we somehow let him become President. \\nWatch attorney Lisa Bloom give her remarks here: Statement on Trump accuser becoming too afraid to show her face. \u201cShe is living in fear,\u201d lawyer Lisa Bloom said. pic.twitter.com/demwISRtAX'"}, "time": 1742564600.242771}
