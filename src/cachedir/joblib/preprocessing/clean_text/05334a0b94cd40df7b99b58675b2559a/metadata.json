They had not been injured on the field, but were among the many players bruised by the disciplinary practices of the N. F. L. and Roger Goodell, the commissioner of the most powerful sports league in America. In one corner sat linebacker James Harrison, whom Goodell had threatened to suspend indefinitely if he did not speak to investigators about allegations that he had used steroids. No stranger to controversy, Harrison called Goodell a \u201ccrook. \u201d Running back Le\u2019Veon Bell, who walked past Harrison\u2019s locker, will sit out the first three games of the regular season because he failed to report for a drug test, his second   suspension in two seasons. Nearby was quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, who received a   suspension after he was accused of sexual assault in 2010. (The penalty was ultimately reduced to four games.) Then there was guard Ramon Foster. He may incur Goodell\u2019s ire in a different way, as the team\u2019s union representative and one of several players across the league who are now preparing their brethren for a yearslong fight to rein in Goodell\u2019s power. Goodell\u2019s application of disciplinary policy, and his unwillingness to appoint an independent arbitrator to hear appeals, has corroded the fragile trust between him and the players, who see him as judge and jury, Foster and other union representatives said. To push their point, they have already told players to start setting aside money in case the players ultimately end up on a picket line without a paycheck. \u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with a guy like Roger Goodell, he can do whatever he wants because no one is in charge of him, especially with discipline,\u201d Foster said. \u201cFor us to actually battle this out, we need to save money. We have a chance to fight for this. \u201d Foster\u2019s call to action is unusual because the N. F. L. \u2019s current labor deal does not expire until 2021. But players said they were so alarmed by a string of suspensions they considered unreasonable, and the legal victories the league had won to uphold those decisions, that they needed to muster for action now. Their focus is the N. F. L. \u2019s personal conduct policy, which Goodell has used to penalize players for transgressions as varied as aggressive hits on quarterbacks, bullying teammates, domestic abuse and scheming to deflate footballs. Goodell, with an approach far more aggressive than that of his predecessor, Paul Tagliabue, has gotten as much attention in his first decade as commissioner for these punishments as for turning the league, which oversees America\u2019s most popular sport, into a $13 billion behemoth. Few players would dispute that someone who commits domestic violence should be penalized. But Goodell\u2019s suspension of players for more ambiguous infractions like deflating footballs or taunting teammates has led many fans, and some players, to complain that he is meddlesome and affecting the quality of play by sidelining some of the game\u2019s top stars. Players also want a neutral arbitrator, not Goodell, to hear their appeals. \u201cWe don\u2019t want it to just be that you say this is what it is and we don\u2019t get a chance to negotiate anything,\u201d said Mark Herzlich, a linebacker for the Giants and a member of the union\u2019s executive committee. \u201cWhat we want is fairness. \u201d The season begins in Denver on Thursday night, with a rematch of last season\u2019s Super Bowl between the Broncos and the Carolina Panthers. But on Sunday, when most games will be played, Tom Brady, the New England Patriots quarterback and one of the league\u2019s best players, will be conspicuously absent. He will sit out the first four games of the season after a federal appeals court this summer upheld the league\u2019s right to suspend him over his role in an alleged plot to deflate balls used in the A. F. C. championship game in 2015. Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson will take the field, though a federal court this summer agreed that the N. F. L. had been within its rights to suspend Peterson after he was arrested following an episode in which he disciplined his young son with a stick. Under an agreement with the league, Peterson paid a fine equal to three games\u2019 salary. Goodell has his defenders, including team owners, but even they express dismay that his disciplinary decisions have become a lightning rod and sometimes distracted from the game. \u201cI think it\u2019s largely due to the   age and the fact that he had some   cases and admittedly made some mistakes,\u201d John Mara, an owner of the Giants, said of the attention Goodell receives. \u201cAnd he\u2019s become an easy target because of the money he makes. It\u2019s almost gotten to the point where no matter what he does, he faces an avalanche of a criticism. \u201d Still, Mara and many other owners said that they supported Goodell\u2019s approach and, contrary to what some of the commissioner\u2019s critics have said, insisted that he had not acted impulsively, but rather in the best interests of the league. \u201cOnce he makes up his mind, he certainly has a strong opinion on things,\u201d said Art Rooney II, an owner of the Steelers. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he\u2019s someone who isn\u2019t seeking input. \u201d Goodell and his deputies are unapologetic. \u201cThe whole reason you have a commissioner in any sport, the most fundamental reason for that office, is to protect the integrity of the game,\u201d said Jeff Pash, the N. F. L. \u2019s top lawyer. The job of the commissioner, he added, is to make sure that fans \u201care rooting and supporting financially and emotionally for a game that is clean, that is honest, cares about fans and cares about the people who play the game. \u201d   tension has long been a feature of the N. F. L. though. In the 1970s and 1980s, players walked off the job several times to win concessions like free agency. By the 1990s, Tagliabue and the union chief at the time, Gene Upshaw, found common ground more often than not. In 2006, the players won what was widely perceived as the upper hand when the two sides renewed their collective bargaining agreement. Five years later, with the economy teetering, the owners clawed back those gains and then some, but only after a protracted fight with DeMaurice Smith, Upshaw\u2019s replacement. \u201cMy observation was when DeMaurice took over, it became combative,\u201d said Amy Trask, who was the chief executive of the Oakland Raiders until 2013. \u201cWith the union, everything was an argument. We could go into a meeting and say, Wow, my pencil broke, can someone give a pencil? and there would be an argument about No. 2 pencils. \u201d After the owners locked them out for more than four months, the players agreed to accept just 47 percent of the league\u2019s revenue, down from 50 percent. Amid the fight over money, the players focused less on the personal conduct policy, which has now become such a point of contention. Only the Steelers players  \u2014   who had watched Goodell suspend Roethlisberger and fine Harrison for making illegal hits  \u2014   voted against the deal. In a league that practically prints money, threatening to walk off the job would seem  . Most careers in the N. F. L. are brutally short  \u2014   the average length is less than four years  \u2014   so players might be excused for opting to collect paychecks over trying to clip a commissioner\u2019s wings. The larger question, then, is whether the current fixation on Goodell\u2019s power will continue and how far the players are willing to go to try to check his authority. Pash said that the league was willing to negotiate with the union to amend the personal conduct policy, but that the union would have to understand the owners\u2019 position and stop trying to overturn the commissioner\u2019s rulings by going to court. For their part, many players have said they recognize that they, like employees at any company, must be accountable for their actions on and off the job. They insist that they have only gone to court because the commissioner overstepped his authority in applying the personal conduct policy. They also reject the notion that they must give the owners something  \u2014   like agreeing to play an   season  \u2014   in return for overhauling the policy. \u201cThey\u2019ve created this Dumpster fire they have to put it out,\u201d said Eric Winston, an offensive lineman with the Cincinnati Bengals and the president of the N. F. L. Players Association. \u201cThey can\u2019t come to the union and say, \u2018We\u2019ve abused this policy for 30 years you need to give us something so that we can change it. \u2019\u201d'"}, "time": 1742628435.5679386}
