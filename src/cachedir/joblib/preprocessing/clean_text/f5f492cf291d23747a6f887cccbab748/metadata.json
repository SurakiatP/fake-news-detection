[Senator Lindsey Graham and Senator John McCain, two of the biggest critics of President Barack Obama\u2019s failure to act in Syria, issued a joint statement in favor of Trump\u2019s decision.  \u201cUnlike the previous administration, President Trump confronted a pivotal moment in Syria and took action,\u201d they said. \u201cFor that, he deserves the support of the American people. \u201d McCain and Graham urged Trump to consider further action, calling for a strategy to take out Assad\u2019s Air Force, the establishment of safe zones, and supporting Syrian rebels. \u201cBuilding on tonight\u2019s credible first step, we must finally learn the lessons of history and ensure that tactical success leads to strategic progress,\u201d he said. Senator Marco Rubio also supported the action. \u201cBy acting decisively against the very facility from which Assad launched his murderous chemical weapons attack, President Trump has made it clear to Assad and those who empower him that the days of committing war crimes with impunity are over,\u201d he said in a statement. Rubio wrote on Twitter that Trump was \u201cdeeply moved\u201d by the images of children suffering the effects of the chemical weapon attack. \u201cBe sure of this: The wicked will not go unpunished,\u201d he wrote, quoting Proverbs 11:21. Senator Tom Cotton issued a statement of support as well. \u201cI commend President Trump for taking swift, decisive action against Bashar  \u2019s outlaw regime,\u201d he said. \u201cAny country that violates   agreements with the U. S. develops illicit   or   programs, or supports those countries that do ought to take note. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563663.6203475}
