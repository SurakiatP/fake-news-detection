AP Photo\\nThe FBI will reopen its investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server after learning of \u201cthe existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation,\u201d FBI Director James Comey wrote in a letter to congressional leaders on Friday.\\nComey said the team in charge of looking into Clinton\u2019s server briefed him on Thursday on new emails it found \u201cin connection with an unrelated case.\u201d\\n\u201cThe FBI cannot assess whether or not this material may be significant,\u201d Comey wrote, adding, \u201cI cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work.\u201d\\nHere\u2019s the full letter: \\nThe emails were reportedly uncovered after the FBI seized devices belong to Huma Abedin and her husband, Anthony Weiner, the New York Times reported , citing law enforcement officials. Prosecutors issued a subpoena for Weiner\u2019s cell phone and other records in late September amid allegations that he had been sexting with a 15-year-old girl.\\nPrevious reports indicated that only three relevant emails were found, but a federal official told the Times on Friday afternoon that the number of emails uncovered through Abedin\u2019s and Weiner\u2019s devices numbered in the thousands.\\nClinton gave a rally on Friday after the news broke, but did not mention the FBI\u2019s announcement.\\nStocks fell sharply after the FBI\u2019s announcement. \\nDonald Trump responded to the news at a rally Friday, saying, \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s corruption is not on a scale we have ever seen \u2026 The FBI and the Justice Department now have the chance to right the horrible mistake that they made\u201d in not previously recommending that Clinton be charged with criminal wrongdoing.\\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan released a statement renewing his call for the Director of National Intelligence to suspend classified intelligence briefings for Clinton, who, he said, \u201cwas entrusted with some of our nation\u2019s most important secrets, and betrayed that trust by carelessly mishandling highly classified information.\u201d\\nMany on Twitter have condemned the FBI\u2019s handling of the announcement that it would reopen the investigation.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s bad enough having the media do the \u2018raises questions,\u2019 substance-free innuendo thing. Worse when the FBI director does it. Disgraceful,\u201d economist Paul Krugman tweeted on Friday . \u201cComey needs to provide full info immediately. Otherwise he has clearly made a partisan intervention, betraying his office.\u201d \\n\u201cI have zero faith that anyone will handle this responsibly,\u201d former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau wrote . \u201cIt\u2019s insane. He [Comey] at least owes the country a press briefing \u2014 anything more than a vague letter.\u201d\\n\u201cDirector Comey should give a more complete explanation. Is this reviewing newly found emails? Is this reopening? Too much at stake,\u201d wrote John Weaver , the former campaign strategist for Gov. John Kasich of Ohio.\\nClinton\u2019s email scandal has dogged the Democratic presidential nominee for more than a year. In March 2015, she first admitted to exclusively using a private email account to send and receive work-related emails while she served as secretary of state. The controversy compelled her to hand over roughly 30,000 work-related emails to the State Department, which have been released in batches since last year.\\nBut she deleted about 30,000 additional emails from her server that she said were \u201cpersonal\u201d in nature before handing it over to the FBI in August, five months after she gave individual emails to the State Department.\\nNBC\u2019s Pete Williams reported Friday that the newly discovered emails were not among those originally withheld by Clinton or her campaign and were found on a \u201cdevice\u201d in a separate investigation. The decision to reopen the investigation was not related to emails released by WikiLeaks or to Russian hacking, Williams said.\\nA US official also told the Associated Press that the newly discovered emails relating to the FBI\u2019s Clinton investigation did not come from her private server.\\nDemocratic nominee Hillary Clinton looks at her mobile phone as she leaves her house to attend Congressional Black Caucus Foundation\u2019s Phoenix Awards Dinner at the Washington convention center in Washington Thomson Reuters\\nAfter examining her emails for more than a year, the State Department issued a scathing report in May concluding that she \u201cdid not comply\u201d with its policies when she chose to use a personal email account to conduct government business.\\nThe State Department faulted Clinton and previous secretaries of state for poorly managing email and other computer information and for slowly responding to new cyber-security risks.\\nTwo months later, the FBI decided not to recommend that the Justice Department bring charges against Clinton, saying Clinton\u2019s conduct did not meet the threshold used to prosecute past violators who shared classified information over unclassified channels.\\n\u201cIn looking back at our investigations into mishandling or removal of classified information, we cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts,\u201d Comey said in July, after the FBI interviewed Clinton for three hours about her use of the server while at the State Department.\\nTrump has called the FBI\u2019s determination \u201cvery unfair\u201d and has said that if he were elected president, he would \u201clock her up\u201d over her email scandal.\\nClinton\u2019s unusual email system was originally set up by a staffer during Clinton\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign. It replaced another private server used by her husband, Bill Clinton.\\nThe new server was run by Bryan Pagliano, who had worked as the IT director on Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign before she joined the State Department in May 2009. In 2013 \u2014 the same year she left the State Department \u2014 Clinton hired a small Denver-based IT firm named Platte River Networks to oversee the system.\\nClinton has since apologized for using the email server while insisting she never sent or received information marked \u201cclassified\u201d using her private email account.\\nThe news tops off a particularly bad week for the Clinton campaign, which included both the release of a hacked memo published by WikiLeaks titled \u201cBill Clinton, Inc.\u201d that raised questions about the blurring of lines between the Clinton Foundation charity and the Clintons\u2019 personal finances and news that health-insurance premiums on the exchanges set up by the Affordable Care Act were set to increase significantly in 2017. \\nFollow WE ARE CHANGE on SOCIAL MEDIA SnapChat: LukeWeAreChange \\nfbook: https://facebook.com/LukeWeAreChange \\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Lukewearechange I nstagram: http://instagram.com/lukewearechange Sign up become a patron and Show your support for alternative news for Just 1$ a month you can help Grow We are change We use Bitcoin Too ! 12HdLgeeuA87t2JU8m4tbRo247Yj5u2TVP Join and Up Vote Our STEEMIT  \\nThe post The FBI will reopen its investigation into Hillary Clinton appeared first on We Are Change .\\n'"}, "time": 1742563662.17776}
