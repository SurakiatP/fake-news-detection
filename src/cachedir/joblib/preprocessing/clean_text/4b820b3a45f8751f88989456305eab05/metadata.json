If anything, they hate Republicans more. [But the   can\u2019t learn. The bureaucracy, the judiciary and congressional Republicans are all openly working for the \u201cResistance. \u201d It\u2019s President Trump against the world.  In Congress, the hate for Trump is personal. Not only did he throw a grenade into politicians\u2019 little   club, but his very existence destroys their   as people with a set of skills. While Trump was making billions of dollars building skyscrapers, developing golf courses and starring on a hit reality TV show, members of Congress were slowly working their way up the political ladder  \u2014   interning at think tanks and congressional offices, taking some small government job, then running for the House or Senate, and, hopefully, marrying a woman with a large inheritance. A stunning number of senators and congressmen are supported by rich wives  \u2014   Sens. John McCain, Mitch McConnell, Richard Blumenthal, John Kerry and Ron Wyden, and Reps. Michael McCaul, Scott Peters and Paul Ryan, to name a few. Is there any other profession with as high a percentage of men sponging off their wives\u2019 inheritances? Then a   billionaire came along, violated all the rules they had lived by, and swept aside more than a dozen experienced politicians just like themselves! Not only did Trump make his own money, but he beat them at the one thing they thought they knew how to do. How else to explain Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s sneering dismissal of Trump\u2019s request for an investigation into voter fraud, followed  \u2014   one week later!  \u2014   by McConnell\u2019s assurance that the Senate would investigate former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn\u2019s phone call to the Russian ambassador? These useless Republicans allowed a Senate seat to be stolen from under their noses in Minnesota in 2008, giving Obama the vote he needed to pass Obamacare and destroy our health care. No, don\u2019t investigate that! Why bother with the very foundation of democracy? How will these nitwit politicians win praise from The Washington Post without devoting all their energy to some current leftist fetish, like Russia? At least when liberals fixate on Russia, they have a clear subversive mission. Congressional Republicans are just nincompoops. The only thing they know is: Imitate Reagan  \u2014   from 30 years ago. It would make more sense for Republicans to demand that all air traffic controllers be fired for no reason than it is for them to keep treating Putin like it\u2019s 1950 and he\u2019s Stalin. (We know Putin isn\u2019t Stalin because Democrats aren\u2019t affectionately calling him \u201cUncle Joe\u201d and spying for him.) If senators have time for hearings on Flynn\u2019s discussions with the Russian ambassador, could they possibly squeeze in an afternoon to repeal Obamacare? How about the campaign pledge that rocketed Trump to the White House? According to The Washington Post, at the GOP retreat last month, when Trump talked about using tax policy to help pay for the wall, Republicans expressed \u201cconfusion about what exactly he meant. \u201d Are they retarded? (By \u201cthey,\u201d I mean all Republicans in Congress, except Sen. Tom Cotton and about a   others.) If Republicans had an ounce of   right after repealing Obamacare and writing a bill taxing remittances to make Mexico pay for the wall, they\u2019d be impeaching the ridiculous Judge James Robart. Even lawyers who oppose Trump\u2019s travel ban agree that Judge Robart made a complete ass of himself when he blocked the executive order. The \u201cResistance\u201d claims to be terrified that Trump will not be constrained by our Constitution, but they\u2019re the ones who are perfectly willing to disregard the Constitution simply to stop Trump. At least since the Chinese exclusion case of 1889, the Supreme Court has made blindingly clear that \u201cthe power of exclusion of foreigners\u201d belongs to the political branches of government: Congress and the president  \u2014   not to the judiciary. The president\u2019s authority to exclude aliens in the public interest has been reaffirmed in dozens of cases since then. Among them:  \u2014   Harisiades v. Shaughnessy (1952): \u201cAny policy toward aliens is vitally and intricately interwoven with   \u2026     the conduct of foreign relations, the war power, and the maintenance of a republican form of government. Such matters are so exclusively entrusted to the political branches of government as to be largely immune from judicial inquiry or interference. \u201d  \u2014   Shaughnessy v. Mezei (1953): \u201cCongress expressly authorized the President to impose additional restrictions on aliens entering or leaving the United States during periods of international tension and strife.   \u2026     (The President) may shut out aliens whose \u2018entry would be prejudicial to the interests of the United States. \u2019\u201d  \u2014   Mathews v. Diaz (1976): \u201c(T) he responsibility for regulating the relationship between the United States and our alien visitors has been committed to the political branches of the Federal Government.   \u2026     (Therefore, there is) a narrow standard of review of decisions made by the Congress or the President in the area of immigration and naturalization. \u201d  \u2014   United States v.   (1982): \u201cThe power to regulate immigration  \u2014   an attribute of sovereignty essential to the preservation of any nation  \u2014   has been entrusted by the Constitution to the political branches of the Federal Government. \u201d  \u2014   INS. v.   (1999): \u201c(J) udicial deference to the Executive Branch is especially appropriate in the immigration context where officials \u2018exercise especially sensitive political functions that implicate questions of foreign relations. \u2019\u201d And on and on and on. There are lots of constitutional questions that reasonable people can disagree about. Whether the president can exclude foreigners from seven   countries is not one of them. But congressional Republicans are happy to ignore the Constitution, ignore the balance of powers, ignore written law, even to relinquish their own constitutional authority and let the courts run our foreign policy, just to be a part of the establishment\u2019s STOP TRUMP movement. Instead of neurotically fixating on Russia in some fantasy camp imitation of Reagan, circa 1982, what we\u2019d like these worthless Republicans to do is: Imitate Trump  \u2014   circa now.'"}, "time": 1742561933.2256408}
