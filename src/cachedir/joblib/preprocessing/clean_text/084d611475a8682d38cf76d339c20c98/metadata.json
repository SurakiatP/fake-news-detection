[1] \\nIn a statement released today, the NRPA said: \\n\u201cThe radioactive leak was due to a technical failure during treatment of the fuel in the reactor hall. Emissions are low.\u201d \\nExperts say contamination levels around the Institute for Energy Technology, in the southern town of Halden, were well within legal limits and posed no risk to the public. \\nSaid Per Strand, deputy director-general at the NRPA, a government regulator: \\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s an unfortunate situation but there is a low environmental risk. This is not the sort of leak we want.\u201d [2] \\nThe radioactive iodine was a byproduct of the uranium which powers the facility. \\nStaff were evacuated from the institute, but later returned, donning protective gear, to assess the cause and extent of the leak, and halt it. \\nA senior NRPA official said the incident would \u201cmaybe\u201d be rated a 1 on the International Nuclear Event Scale, which rates nuclear incidents from 1 to 7. By comparison, the incidents at Fukishima and Chernobyl were ranked 7.

Atle Valseth, a research director at the Institute for Energy Technology, agreed. He said: \\n\u201cI don\u2019t sit so close to those decisions but I think we should have informed the authority yesterday. We will have to go through why it wasn\u2019t reported \u2014 it wasn\u2019t good enough that we didn\u2019t report it yesterday.\u201d [2] \\nStrand, the head of safety, preparedness and environment at the NRPA, expressed the regulator\u2019s frustration. \\n\u201cWe need to gather more information \u2026 But we are not happy with the situation, that we were not warned immediately. We will investigate further.\u201d [3] \\nThe Swiss Radiation Safety Authority (SRSA) said i t has not detected any radiation emanating from the facility, which sits close to the Swiss border. \\nMark Foreman, a nuclear expert at the Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden, stressed that the vast majority of the radioactive iodine is trapped inside the fuel, which is contained within a ceramic material. The ceramic-wrapped material is stored inside a metal tube that is welded shut. The tube is inside the reactor. \\nThe iodine would have to leak out of the reactor to enter the reactor hall. \\nSources:'"}, "time": 1742628303.8447134}
