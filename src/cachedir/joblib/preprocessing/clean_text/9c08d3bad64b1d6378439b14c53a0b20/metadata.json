I\u2019m not as nasty as using little girls like Pokemon before their bodies have even developed. I am not as nasty as your own daughter being your favorite sex symbol, like your wet dreams infused with your own genes. But, yeah, I\u2019m a nasty woman, a loud, vulgar proud woman. I\u2019m not nasty, like the combo of Trump and Pence being served up to me in my voting booth. I\u2019m nasty like the battles my grandmothers fought to get me into that voting booth. I\u2019m nasty, like the fight for wage equality. Scarlett Johansson, why were the female actors paid less than half of what the male actors earned last year?
