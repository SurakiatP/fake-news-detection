Then came the horrific live television coverage of police officers being gunned down by a sniper at a march protesting the police shootings. And suddenly, the panoply of fears and resentments that have made this a foreboding summer had been brought into sharp relief. Police accountability and racial bias have been at the center of the civic debate since August 2014, when a black teenager was killed by a white officer in Ferguson, Mo. a suburb of St. Louis. Mass murders in Newtown, Conn. Charleston, S. C. Orlando, Fla. and too many other locales have revived gun violence as a social issue and national shame. Both black anger at police killings and the boiling frustrations of some whites who feel they are ceding their   place in society have been constant undercurrents in politics since January and the Iowa presidential caucuses. Now, in the space of three days, the killings of two black men by Louisiana and Minnesota police officers and the retaliatory murders of five Dallas officers, this time by a black Army veteran, have coalesced all those concerns into a single expression of national angst. In the midst of one of the most consequential presidential campaigns in memory, those convulsive events raised the prospect of still deeper divides in a country already torn by racial and ideological animus. Since the Thursday night sniper attack the national conversation has swung between bitterness and despair over seemingly unbridgeable gulfs in society. The New York Post\u2019s front page blared \u201cCIVIL WAR. \u201d The Drudge Report warned in a headline that \u201cBlack Lives Kill. \u201d Some Minnesota protesters on Thursday night chanted, \u201cKill the police. \u201d Police officers and sociologists alike say that racial tension is approaching a point last seen during the street riots that swept urban American in the late 1960s when disturbances erupted in places like the Los Angeles neighborhood of Watts and Detroit and Newark, during summers of deep discontent. \u201cEven in the 1960s and 1970s, when there was a lot of tension around policing and civil rights and the antiwar movement, we\u2019d never seen anything like what happened in Dallas,\u201d said Darrel W. Stephens, the executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association and an instructor at the Public Safety Leadership Program in the School of Education at Johns Hopkins University. Mr. Stephens and other police officials said that departments were increasingly schooling officers in ways to avoid and defuse violent encounters with minorities. But other experts said the parade of cellphone videos depicting shootings of black men have only reinforced  \u2019 conviction that little has changed in six decades. \u201cThere is a constant bombardment of images of brutality against   and not just brutality, but   brutality,\u201d said Paul Butler, a former federal prosecutor and a law professor at Georgetown University Law Center. This week\u2019s videos, he said, were particularly devastating. \u201cIt\u2019s visceral,\u201d he said. \u201cIt hits you in the gut. It\u2019s emotional and graphic, so it makes you feel worse. \u201d There are some parallels today to the 1960s. Those riots were largely touched off by violent encounters between blacks and the police. Scholars say and statistics show that attacks on police officers became an increasingly frequent   response to decades of inequality and mistreatment at that time. The Kerner Commission, established by President Lyndon B. Johnson, reported in 1968 that \u201cOur nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white  \u2014   separate but unequal. \u201d And a white backlash became a driving force in the presidential campaign that year that saw a   Republican, Richard M. Nixon, end eight years of Democratic rule. Whether this week\u2019s violence presages a repeat of that history is, of course, an unknown, as the nation\u2019s first black president nears the end of two terms in office and the two political parties move toward their national conventions this month. But racial tensions are clearly rising. A June survey by the Pew Research Center found that only 46 percent of whites surveyed thought that race relations were generally good, a sharp drop from the 66 percent who held that opinion in June 2009, shortly after Mr. Obama took office. For blacks, the corresponding decline  \u2014   to 34 percent last month from 59 percent in 2009  \u2014   was even steeper. The same Pew survey found that about   of   thought that blacks in their communities were treated less fairly by the police than were whites a bare 35 percent of whites felt the same. In the hours after the Dallas ambush, stunned officials and civic leaders pleaded for citizens to repair the rips in the nation\u2019s social fabric. \u201cOur profession is hurting,\u201d said the Dallas police chief, David O. Brown, who is  . \u201cDallas officers are hurting. We are heartbroken. There are no words to describe the atrocity that occurred to our city. All I know is that this must stop, this divisiveness between our police and our citizens. \u201d The Rev. Bryan Carter echoed him at a Friday memorial service for the fallen officers, saying: \u201cWe refuse to hate each other. We commit to pray together. \u201d President Obama, speaking on Friday from Warsaw, where he was attending a   NATO summit meeting, said of the police, \u201cToday is a wrenching reminder of the sacrifices they make for us. \u201d He called the attack a \u201cvicious, calculated and despicable attack on law enforcement. \u201d In a presidential race in which racial and ethnic divisions have become an issue, both Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump canceled political events on Friday. Mr. Trump called the events in Texas \u201can attack on our country. \u201d \u201cIt is a coordinated, premeditated assault on the men and women who keep us safe,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a statement. \u201cWe must restore law and order. \u201d Mrs. Clinton wrote on Twitter on Friday, \u201cI mourn for the officers shot while doing their sacred duty to protect peaceful protesters, for their families and all who serve with them. \u201d But on social media, there were salutes to the sniper, blame of the news media for dividing the nation, charges that black protesters had spread hysteria, calls for love, fear of civil war and laments that the country is headed toward an unbridgeable divide. Some activists said their movement would press on, demanding that the police be accountable. Aislinn Sol, a Black Lives Matter organizer in Chicago, said, \u201cThe disproportionate   violence against   has not changed,\u201d adding, \u201cWhat we have seen is a change in the response. \u201d In interviews, a number of police officials said that they believed the only lasting solution to the violence and division was to end the glaring inequalities that fuel them, but that they saw little hope for that. \u201cWe\u2019re the most heavily armed violent society in the history of Western civilization and we dump this duty on   \u201d in police departments, Ed Flynn, the police chief in Milwaukee, said in an interview before Thursday\u2019s killings. \u201cThe problem for American policing is we\u2019re learning the hard way that our political establishment finds it far easier to develop a constituency at the expense of our police than to solve these social problems. \u201d Perhaps it was Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch who captured the day\u2019s mood. \u201cThis has been a week of profound grief and heartbreaking loss,\u201d she said on Friday. \u201cAfter the events of this week, Americans across our country are feeling a sense of helplessness, of uncertainty and of fear. \u201d \u201cWe must reject the easy impulses of bitterness and rancor,\u201d she added, \u201cand embrace the difficult work  \u2014   but the important work, the vital work  \u2014   of finding a path forward together. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628587.2209356}
