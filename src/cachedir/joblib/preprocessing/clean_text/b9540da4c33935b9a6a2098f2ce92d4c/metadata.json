[1) The bill\u2019s provisions increase healthcare costs for Trump voters in critical states. As an analysis conducted by the Washington Post shows, voters in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin will see their tax credits decrease under Obamacare 2. 0. \u201cIf you\u2019re a    making $75, 000 a year, you\u2019re going to get a 75 percent or higher increase to your tax credits \u2014  a beneficial situation for you,\u201d the Post explains. \u201cIf, however, you\u2019re a    making $30, 000 a year, you\u2019re going to see a reduction in those tax credits (unless you live in Upstate New York or Massachusetts or parts of central Texas). \u201d  In other words, senior citizens \u2014  who vote regularly in   elections \u2014  will see their healthcare costs increase under the Republicans\u2019 bill. Plus, Obamacare 2. 0 phases out credits for people who start earning more than $75, 000. Why? Because screw the voters and they\u2019re on their own? What a great message to send to the middle class! Not only are Republicans hurting people struggling to make ends meet, they also punish you if you make too much money. Everyone loses, except perhaps insurance companies. 2) Meanwhile, the bill is \u201ca gift to illegal aliens,\u201d as conservative author Daniel Horowitz writes. Illegals can get health care through identity theft and fraud, because Obamacare 2. 0 makes it impossible to check enrollees\u2019 immigration status. The bill incentivizes further illegal immigration by encouraging illegals to come to the U. S. to cut into   programs meant for citizens. Poll after poll shows Trump\u2019s immigration policies prioritizing Americans and their problems over foreigners and their wants are hugely popular with voters. Giving away health care to illegals, while ramping up the price for Trump\u2019s core voters, is a slap in the face. 3) Obamacare 2. 0 will be labeled as \u201cTrumpcare,\u201d and Democrats and their media allies will highlight every hard case to attack Republicans for hurting the poor and elderly. Remember when a progressive group put out an ad showing Paul Ryan pushing a grandma in a wheelchair off a cliff? Obamacare 2. 0 gives the media and the Democrats a golden opportunity to walk away from their healthcare mess and blame Republicans, and amplify that message endlessly. 4) Republicans kicked things off with horrific messaging. In a condescending statement, Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz told Americans they\u2019ll have to \u201cinvest\u201d in their health care instead of getting a new iPhone. \u201cAmericans have choices,\u201d he said on CNN. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve got to make a choice. And so, maybe rather than getting that new iPhone that they just love and they want to go spend hundreds of dollars on, maybe they should invest it in their own health care. They\u2019ve got to make those decisions for themselves. \u201d Being forced to buy a product that doesn\u2019t deliver adequate care and keeps increasing in price year after year isn\u2019t an \u201cinvestment,\u201d for one.   pointed out that Chaffetz was mocking poor people who get blindsided by a health crisis: \u201cIf   families make the wrong series of choices, forcing them to choose between their health and their finances, that\u2019s on them. How\u2019s that for a winning message?\u201d The Huffington Post immediately splashed a photo of Chaffetz pointing his finger at the viewer: Chaffetz later walked back his comments, but the damage was done. They sound especially bad in light of Obamacare 2. 0\u2019s \u201ccontinuous coverage\u201d provision. 5) The arbitrary and crushing penalty for not enrolling during the   period will hurt financially struggling voters already fighting to stay afloat. As Avik Roy writes in Forbes, the \u201ccontinuous coverage\u201d part inflicts a massive cost increase on those who go without paying for a plan for more than 63 days. \u201cWorse still, the bill contains an arbitrary \u2018continuous coverage\u2019 provision, in which those who sign up for coverage outside of the normal open enrollment period would pay a 30 percent surcharge to the normal insurance premium,\u201d Roy writes. And you have to pay this for an entire year \u2014  which will not go over well with people struggling to pay for rent, for childcare, for student loans. In other words, it\u2019s not enough to pay a   penalty if you forget to sign up for your Obamacare 2. 0 in time or choose to forgo insurance altogether. No, you have to pay 30 percent more, on top of rising costs, for a whole year. How is this supposed to help, say, parents with three kids paying a large monthly premium (not counting eye and dental, of course) with a high deductible? 6) This bill is going to unleash the kind of political fury on Republicans that will elect Elizabeth Warren in 2020. Part of what killed Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign was voters getting their massive Obamacare premium increases in the mail in October. Republicans seem eager to inflict that kind of fatal damage on themselves. The explosive reaction to Obamacare launched the Tea Party in 2010 and swept Republicans into Congress during the   elections of 2014. The Left is furious and energetic under Trump. The 2018 midterm elections are right around the corner, and Democrats are going to launch a holy war against Trump during the 2020 election. The Left will rally around Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren and other progressives and portray the Democrats as the party of the forgotten man. The white, working class gave Trump a chance in 2016. They could easily begin voting Democratic again or drop out of the political process altogether after a healthcare betrayal. 7) It destroys political capital desperately needed for the rest of Trump\u2019s first term, particularly   immigration reform. Trump\u2019s election victory wasn\u2019t a     election. It was     or   . Republicans have one, brief chance to correct the course the U. S. is heading down and bind up all of the wounds inflicted on Americans over the decades. There is a small window to end the era of cheap labor, low wages, mass immigration,   communities, family disintegration, drug addiction, and suicide. Will Republicans take it and secure their party\u2019s dominance for the next 50 years? Or will they throw it away? Sixty percent of adults are \u201chopeful and optimistic\u201d about America\u2019s future. That\u2019s a precious opportunity, one that shouldn\u2019t be wasted. \u201cThe issue now is about Americans looking to not get f \u2014  ed over. If we deliver, we\u2019ll get 60 percent of the white vote, and 40 percent of the black and Hispanic vote and we\u2019ll govern for 50 years,\u201d White House Chief strategist Steve Bannon said during a November interview. \u201cThat\u2019s what the Democrats missed  \u2026     They lost sight of what the world is about. \u201d Will Trump continue to support Obamacare 2. 0 despite conservative and populist dissent?
