The urine\u2019s acid and salts has contributed to the erosion of its sandstone base, according to the S\u00fcdwest Presse .

Hilbert said he does not want to be known as the \u201cpee police\u201d but that the issue \u201cis about preserving law and order.\" \\nFines for public urination have doubled to \u20ac100 but this has done little to stem the practice. \\nLocated at the popular M\u00fcnsterplatz, the church will probably see an increase in those needing to relieve themselves next month as a wine festival and Christmas markets land on its doorstep. Hilbert said free toilets are needed in the area to help prevent further deterioration of the church\\'s base because of the urination on the church. \\nDuring the town\u2019s holiday of Schw\u00f6rmontag this year, the southern part of the church was closed off to the public in an effort to prevent the offence, but this failed to make much of an impact according to one city spokeswoman. \\n\u201cAs long as there are people\u201d the problem will persist, she told the Presse, admitting that public urinators had proved elusive,with virtually none of the perpetrators caught in the act. \\nThe Lutheran church is the tallest church in the world and the fourth tallest structure built prior to the 20th century, making it one very large tree to pee on.'"}, "time": 1742628553.4834266}
