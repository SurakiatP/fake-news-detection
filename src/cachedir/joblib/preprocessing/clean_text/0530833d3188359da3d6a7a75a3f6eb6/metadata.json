Antonin Scalia, for a generation the court\u2019s irrepressible conservative id, earned 98 votes in the Senate. Ruth Bader Ginsburg, now the patron saint of liberal jurisprudence, got 96. But with the Senate careering toward a   showdown over President Trump\u2019s nominee, Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, the body\u2019s long history of relative collaboration on Supreme Court matters has come to this: Next week, the last bastion of comity is expected to fall over a plainly qualified,   nominee who had no major stumbles in his hearings. And each party\u2019s justification can often be summarized with a schoolyard classic: They started it. \u201cI worry for the institution,\u201d said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who broke with her colleagues last year in calling for a hearing and a vote on Judge Merrick B. Garland, President Barack Obama\u2019s own plainly qualified,   nominee. \u201cI think, at the risk of alienating everyone I have to work with here, that there\u2019s real shortsightedness on both parts. \u201d Leaders of both parties seem largely resigned to the next act. With Republicans eager to vote on Judge Gorsuch\u2019s nomination next week, he is seen as unlikely to attract the support of at least eight Democrats, which he needs to reach the 60 votes necessary to overcome a filibuster. And the Republican majority, led by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, has hinted strongly that it intends to change longstanding rules to elevate Judge Gorsuch with a simple majority vote if necessary. Mr. Trump has encouraged such a move. The specter of Judge Garland, whom Republicans refused to even consider in a presidential election year, has hovered over Judge Gorsuch\u2019s nomination from the beginning, leaving Democrats and the party\u2019s progressive base to stew over what they view as a stolen seat. But veteran lawmakers and scholars of the court have absorbed the present tumult in a deeper context: a prospective Senate nadir achievable only after years of creeping institutional shifts, a mutual recognition of the judiciary\u2019s capacity to accelerate a party\u2019s agenda, and a bipartisan embrace of hypocritical arguments and counterarguments, adopted and abandoned with the political winds. \u201cThis is more the coup de gr\u00e2ce than a new beginning,\u201d said Jeffrey Rosen, president of the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia and an author on Supreme Court matters. \u201cIt may indeed make it impossible for presidents to confirm any nominee at any point in their terms unless they also have control of the Senate. \u201d Some past flash points are familiar  \u2014   charged enough to enshrine \u201cBork\u201d as a verb and forever alter the connotations of Coke cans  \u2014   rendered already in history as signposts of the electrified politics surrounding the court\u2019s nominees. Other episodes, like the escalating partisan tensions over federal judgeships, served to erode Senate cooperation on judicial matters in less immediately perceptible ways. A surge in spending from outside groups, particularly on the right, has also increasingly lent the proceedings a   feel. Then there was the precursor in 2013, when Democrats controlled the Senate under Mr. Obama. Facing a blockade of the president\u2019s appeals court and executive branch nominees, the party changed the rules to bar filibusters for such positions, but left the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations untouched. Republicans have not forgotten. \u201cI say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, you\u2019ll regret this,\u201d Mr. McConnell predicted at the time. \u201cAnd you may regret it a lot sooner than you think. \u201d The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, has indeed said he regrets his party\u2019s choice then, when Senator Harry Reid of Nevada was the Democrats\u2019 leader. But the Supreme Court was meant to be different. Under current rules, the minority party can still prevent a vote on a nominee if more than 40 members band together in the filibuster. If 60 senators invoke \u201ccloture,\u201d the filibuster is broken and a full vote can proceed, with only majority support required. In an interview on Thursday at his office in the Capitol, Mr. Schumer said his party\u2019s efforts were about more than protesting the treatment of Judge Garland. He cited concerns over Judge Gorsuch\u2019s record on workers\u2019 rights and his degree of independence from Mr. Trump and conservative groups like the Federalist Society, which pushed for Judge Gorsuch\u2019s nomination. \u201cIt\u2019s not vengeance for us,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not payback. \u201d There has never been a successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee. In 1968, senators from both parties joined forces to block Justice Abe Fortas, whom President Lyndon B. Johnson sought to elevate to chief justice. Their obstruction  \u2014   \u201cironically, in the middle of a presidential election year,\u201d Mr. McConnell noted this week  \u2014   centered on Mr. Johnson\u2019s   status and ethical questions surrounding Justice Fortas, among other issues. The Senate\u2019s rejection in 1987 of Judge Robert H. Bork signaled a newfound focus on judicial philosophy and temperament, not merely a nominee\u2019s qualifications, as grounds for credible opposition. Four years later, Justice Thomas\u2019s explosive hearings and narrow confirmation, by a vote of 52 to 48, cemented the process as inescapably political, even as the next   of Supreme Court confirmations often proceeded with a bipartisanship that has summarily vanished. And for all the outcry over Justice Thomas, no senator chose to filibuster him. \u201cIt was a function of norms of the Senate, not rules of the Senate,\u201d said Martin B. Gold, a former senior Senate staff member who is considered an authority on the body\u2019s procedures and protocols. \u201cThe rules would have permitted what the norms did not. \u201d Justice Thomas is one of two sitting justices, along with Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. to have fallen short of 60 votes, complicating Democrats\u2019 recent claims that Judge Gorsuch must be held to a   \u201cstandard\u201d for confirmation. There is likewise, with respect to Judge Garland, no rule prohibiting the consideration of Supreme Court nominees eight months before an election. Sanford V. Levinson, a Supreme Court expert at the University of Texas School of Law, said the present enmity stemmed as much from bitter quarrels over   judgeships as from past clashes over Supreme Court picks. He noted the series of filibusters against judicial nominees under President George W. Bush. \u201cThe Democrats did escalate,\u201d Mr. Levinson said. \u201cAnd the Republicans in turn escalated further with regard to doing what they could to delay Obama\u2019s appointments  \u2014   and then the kind of ultimate escalation with regard to Merrick Garland. \u201d In the interview, Mr. Schumer argued that the treatment of Judge Garland was \u201cworse than a filibuster. \u201d And no one, he added, is forcing the Republicans\u2019 hand. \u201cIf they change the rules, it\u2019s their volition,\u201d he said. It has been a trying moment for the   institutionalists of the Senate, members with a particular attachment to the body\u2019s rituals and norms. At the same time, Republicans have generally declined to assign themselves any blame for the rancor. This week, Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the   Republican in the chamber, said the Democrats\u2019 pursuit of a filibuster had become \u201cdemeaning to the Senate and to this country. \u201d Last year, both Senator John McCain of Arizona and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas suggested that they might seek to keep Mr. Scalia\u2019s seat vacant indefinitely if Hillary Clinton won the election. But there is perhaps no surer signal of the Senate\u2019s lurch toward confrontation than Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and the body\u2019s   member. On Monday, Mr. Leahy was quoted as saying he was \u201cnot inclined to filibuster,\u201d even as he expressed his opposition to Judge Gorsuch\u2019s nomination. Hours later, as liberal activists scolded him, the septuagenarian senator issued a clarification on Twitter. \u201cI am never inclined to filibuster a SCOTUS nom,\u201d he wrote, leaving the requisite wiggle room. \u201cBut I need to see how Judge Gorsuch answers my written Qs, under oath, before deciding. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628580.0412395}
