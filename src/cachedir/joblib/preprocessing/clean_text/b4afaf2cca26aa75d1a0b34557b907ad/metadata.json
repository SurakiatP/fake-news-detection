He called it \u201cthe 9/11 of their time\u201d\u2013 a point of reference in their timeline of social consciousness beyond which no innocence can be returned. \\nOne of the guys was passed out in police custody, because he\u2019s a pot-smoking CRIMINAL, but the other one was cool because he didn\u2019t have weed on him, so he told Internet Chronicle how his world view changed: \\nI thought we\u2019d come farther than this, man. I actually really thought we had come so far, we could get a career criminal elected into office over Archie Bunker. Turns out, I was wrong about a lot of things. Next time, I\u2019m voting with my heart: I\u2019m going Gary Johnson. Now he has a plan ! \\n\u201cThey\u2019ll never forget how they remembered America\u2019s paranoid, racist history extending as far back as the 1970s, when white nerds killed disco, for which we have already apologized profusely .\u201d federal agent Smith said. \u201cNor will they forget how flimsy a candidate can be, who deletes subpoenaed emails on command for her corporate power-lords.\u201d \\nInternet Chronicle linguistics analyst and hate philosopher Dr. Angstrom H. Troubadour believes in front loading attribution, and that blatant misuse of language itself led to the seemingly eternal crisis of political misunderstanding between the so-called Left and so-called Right. \\n\u201cThe words \u2018liberal\u2019 and \u2018conservative\u2019 don\u2019t even have denotations anymore. They mean what people want them to mean,\u201d Troubadour said. \u201cThese words are to be avoided at all cost.\u201d \\nmakin money, makin money, makin money, makin money, makin money, makin money\u2019s for the words. \\n[Editor\u2019s note: Remember Trump\u2019s CRAZY response when the 60 Minutes lady asked him how many more tax dollars would be spent drone striking weddings?] Share this article'"}, "time": 1742563122.428302}
