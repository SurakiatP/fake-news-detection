President Trump last week called the news media \u201cthe enemy of the American people. \u201d But in interviews around the country this week, Americans of varying political affiliations, even those with serious misgivings about the media, largely allowed that the president\u2019s characterization had gone too far. \u201cI think that was a bit much,\u201d said Mark Huizingh, 67, a Trump supporter and furniture store owner in Grand Rapids, Mich. \u201cThat was a little too strong. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency has exacerbated already deep ideological divisions in the country, and Americans on one end of the political spectrum increasingly find themselves unable even to look their counterparts in the eye. But if there has been one instance in the last month when the rift has not seemed quite as large, perhaps it has been the response to Mr. Trump\u2019s harsh rebuke of the media. Still, the feeling toward the news media among those interviewed was far from warm and fuzzy. Many said they believed the media was flawed in general, and certainly when it came to the coverage of Mr. Trump and his administration. \u201cTrump may be exaggerating,\u201d said Jodi Littell, 55, an English teacher from Miami, who was strolling around a shopping center with her husband. But, she added, \u201cto some degree he\u2019s right that the media is out to get him. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s attempts to demonize the mainstream media are nothing new. He has referred to the news media as the \u201copposition party\u201d and repeatedly called legitimate news organizations \u201cfake news. \u201d He and his aides have also consistently attacked the media\u2019s credibility, calling out factual mistakes made by organizations sometimes even after corrections were made. But if the tactics were meant to convince the public that the media was a deceitful adversary, they did not appear to be having quite the desired effect. According to a Quinnipiac University poll released on Wednesday, 61 percent of respondents said they disapproved of the way Mr. Trump talked about the media.   percent said they trusted the media more to tell the truth about important issues, while 37 percent said they trusted Mr. Trump more to do so. The political divide, however, is stark: Among Democrats, 86 percent said they trusted the media more to tell the truth, while 78 percent of Republicans said they trusted Mr. Trump more. A Fox News poll released last week showed respondents about evenly divided on whom they trusted more to tell the truth. \u201cNobody is perfect,\u201d said Nick Lortie, 24, a plumber from Merrimack, N. H. who voted for the Libertarian candidate, Gary Johnson, in the presidential election. \u201cIt\u2019s like if the weatherman says it\u2019s going to rain and it doesn\u2019t  \u2014   if someone tells them something and it turns out to be wrong, it\u2019s not their fault,\u201d he said, referring to the media. Charles Mellison Jr. 77, a retired   truck driver and registered Democrat in Miami, said he thought Mr. Trump\u2019s comments were intended to \u201cthrow people off. \u201d \u201cHe should be more respectful,\u201d he added, as he sipped a cup of coffee. \u201cThe media are not liars. \u201d Rick Rutter, 56, a pastor and executive director of a local rescue mission from Nashua, N. H. chuckled at the idea that the media was the enemy of the American people. But he, like many others interviewed, said he did see a litany of problems with the press. \u201cIt\u2019s like that quote,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018If you don\u2019t read the paper, you\u2019re uninformed. If you do, you\u2019re misinformed. \u2019\u201d The news media, however, was acting like an enemy in at least one respect: It was exhausting him. During the   to the election, Mr. Rutter said, he had cut the cord in part because keeping up with different interpretations of current events on television had become fruitless. Not everyone was so quick to dismiss Mr. Trump\u2019s comments as outlandish, however. (Half of the respondents to the Quinnipiac poll said they disapproved of the media\u2019s coverage of Mr. Trump.) \u201cI think it\u2019s right and wrong,\u201d Ted Friedman, 59, a   furniture upholsterer in Grand Rapids, said about likening the media to the enemy. \u201cI think the media definitely is out there to stir the pot up and see what comes out of it. \u201d But he added that his complaints were directed at national news outlets, not his local media. \u201cI think what we\u2019re seeing in the mainstream  \u2014   we\u2019re talking CNN, Fox and so forth  \u2014   I think we\u2019re seeing the kids are on the playground,\u201d he said. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s on the playground, the media\u2019s on the playground, and they\u2019re all fighting for that one little swing. \u201d Gary Abernathy, 61, the editor and publisher of The   in Hillsboro, Ohio, which endorsed Mr. Trump for president, said part of the problem with the mainstream media\u2019s coverage of Mr. Trump was that reporters at major newspapers \u201ddon\u2019t really get other parts of the country. \u201d \u201cI do think it\u2019s a failure to understand, and also a failure to respect the opinions of Trump voters,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just a big believer in good journalism, and that\u2019s what I hate seeing fall by the wayside in the coverage of Trump,\u201d he added. \u201cI think Trump should be critically covered, but he should be covered with fairness  \u2014   not with animosity, not with a point of view. You want the press to simply be fair. \u201d Often, a negative perception of the media reflected a deeper frustration with coverage unrelated to coverage of Mr. Trump. \u201cHoly moly  \u2014   in my opinion, I believe they\u2019re pretty biased,\u201d Amber McDowell, 37, who owns a flower shop in Broadus, Mont. said about the news media. Still, Ms. McDowell, a registered Republican who said she had never voted for a Democrat in a presidential election, said she \u201cwouldn\u2019t go as far as \u2018the enemy\u2019 \u201d in describing the news media. \u201cIt\u2019s just a lot of the bad events. You don\u2019t ever see any of the good stuff with the soldiers and the good stuff with the police,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cIn small town U. S. A. I believe that\u2019s probably how a lot of us feel. \u201d Charles Funderburk, 46, a contractor in Little Rock, Ark. and a conservative Republican, said he felt he was \u201conly getting  \u201d from the news media. \u201cThe media has its own agenda, just like the Democrats and Republicans do,\u201d he said, as he loaded supplies into his pickup truck at Home Depot. \u201cThey want to tell us what they want to tell us when they want to tell us, if they want to tell us. \u201d Cindy Lyons, 40, who helps her husband run a tent rental business in Grand Rapids, also stopped short of siding with Mr. Trump\u2019s characterization of the media but allowed that he might not be that far afield. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I agree with it, but I see where it\u2019s coming from,\u201d she said. Ms. Lyons, a mother of five boys who described herself as \u201ckind of in the middle\u201d in terms of her political leanings, said that while she did not think the media was untruthful, she, too, was put off by the frequent negative coverage. \u201cYou turn on the news, and you very rarely hear the good,\u201d she said. \u201cI know that\u2019s the norm, because people aren\u2019t really out reporting on things that are going great. \u201d But even those critical of the news media and its coverage of Mr. Trump appeared ready to give it all a rest. \u201cPeople already voted him in,\u201d said Richard Bryant, 48, a construction project manager in Little Rock. \u201cLet\u2019s move on and make America great again. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628555.8235114}
