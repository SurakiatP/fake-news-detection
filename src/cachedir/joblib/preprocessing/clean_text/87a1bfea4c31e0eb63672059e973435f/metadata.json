Neither has Nigel Farage, the British politician who led the Brexit campaign. The World Economic Forum  \u2014   an annual gathering of global policy and business leaders, who come to debate the world\u2019s great challenges  \u2014   gets underway here Monday night as the shifting political trends toward nationalism and against a sense of globalism are raising renewed questions about the relevance of the elites known as the \u201cDavos class. \u201d It is this group of   plutocrats that largely failed to anticipate  \u2014   and may have even unconsciously generated  \u2014   the seeping   movement across the globe. Every January, a glittering array of the cognoscenti descend on the Alps: the     Bill Gates, the   of Microsoft the billionaire investor George Soros Jack Ma, the founder of China\u2019s   giant, Alibaba and  \u2014   until recently  \u2014   Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany. An assortment of Hollywood actors including Angelina Jolie, Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon have made the pilgrimage over the years to promote their nonprofit work. And the conversations tend to be dominated by issues like inequality, climate change and the economic challenges facing developed and emerging countries. This year, the guest list includes names like President Xi Jinping of China Vice President Joseph Biden JPMorgan Chase\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon the head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde and former Vice President Al Gore. And yet missing from these   conversations have been meaningful challengers or critics of the underlying theme that was seemingly stipulated from the birth of this event 46 years ago: Globalization has the potential to benefit everyone. \u201cTrump\u2019s election victory is a clear indication that the majority of people are not interested in a world government, but want to return to a classical, local democracy,\u201d John Mauldin, an economic researcher and author, recently wrote. \u201cStrange as it may seem to the Davos men, most people tend to love their \u2018patria,\u2019 the land of their fathers. \u201d Dissenting voices like those of Mr. Trump and Mr. Farage have rarely been part of the discussion  \u2014   though perhaps that will change. Theresa May, Britain\u2019s new prime minister, will attend this year, as will some of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers. But the victories of Mr. Trump and the Brexit campaign can be viewed as a rebuke of \u201cDavos Man,\u201d a name that Samuel Huntington, the Harvard political scientist, gave attendees in 2004, describing them as \u201ctransnationalists\u201d who \u201chave little need for national loyalty, view national boundaries as obstacles that thankfully are vanishing, and see national governments as residues from the past whose only useful function is to facilitate the elite\u2019s global operations. \u201d The middle class in the United States and Britain  \u2014   and perhaps in France if Marine Le Pen, the   presidential candidate who has also never been invited to Davos, wins this spring  \u2014   clearly haven\u2019t felt the benefits of the   world encouraged by multinational corporations that allows both immigration and commerce to take place without friction. \u201cThey have witnessed the rise of the Davos class, a   network of banking and tech billionaires, elected leaders who are awfully cozy with those interests, and Hollywood celebrities who make the whole thing seem unbearably glamorous,\u201d Naomi Klein, a columnist for The Guardian, wrote in a searing analysis of the American election in November. She described the failure of \u201celite neoliberalism\u201d to address the economic challenges of the masses. \u201cSuccess,\u201d she wrote, continuing to describe the middle class, \u201cis a party to which they were not invited, and they know in their hearts that this rising wealth and power is somehow directly connected to their growing debts and powerlessness. \u201d The Davos Man has either failed to properly articulate the benefits of open trade  \u2014   or the reality of open trade is more complicated than previously imagined. In a nod to this new reality, the World Economic Forum has put together an index of what it calls inclusive growth and development, which measures 109 countries according to their progress on economic growth and reducing income inequality and breaks out subsets of those countries to compare with different data sets. According to the index, median income actually declined by 2. 4 percent between 2008 and 2013 across the 26 advanced economies where data is available, which may help explain the shifting political winds. \u201cIt\u2019s our response to how capitalism has failed us  \u2014   and how we need to fix it,\u201d said Adrian Monck, a member of the forum\u2019s executive committee. The United States ranked 23rd out of 30 advanced economies. In terms of wage and nonwage compensation, it ranked last in social protection, it came in 25th. It also came in 25th on \u201cintermediation of business investment\u201d  \u2014   in other words, the amount of money that goes into productive investments, such as research and development and infrastructure as opposed to share buybacks. (Norway ranked No. 1. Living standards there rose by 10. 6 percent from 2008 to 2013 while the economy grew only 0. 5 percent.) Mr. Monck defended the idea of a globalist approach. \u201cThe benefits of globalization are there to see, in jobs in China, India and many emerging markets,\u201d he said. \u201cBillions of people owe better lives to it. \u201d He invoked Klaus Schwab, the founder of the World Economic Forum. \u201cWhat hasn\u2019t been listened to in Davos is persistent warnings from people like Klaus that the benefits need to be shared, and that you can\u2019t have    capitalism,\u201d Mr. Monck said. Still, he acknowledged that the invitation list of insiders is by design. \u201cWe always want the most comprehensive political attendance in Davos, to help support   cooperation, which is what we do,\u201d he said. \u201cThat inevitably means current, serving political figures. There are politicians in office now  \u2014   and coming to Davos  \u2014   who reflect this emergent agenda that you\u2019ve seen in the U. S. \u201d For example, he said, leaders from Poland, Finland, Portugal and even Switzerland  \u2014   where the Swiss People\u2019s Party was an early example of the shift in the political landscape  \u2014   will be on hand this week. A bevy of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers and members of his business council are expected to attend, including Anthony Scaramucci, who joined the  \u2019s White House staff as an adviser and public liaison to government agencies and businesses. He will be joined by Stephen Schwarzman, chairman of the Blackstone Group and also of Mr. Trump\u2019s President\u2019s Strategic and Policy Forum. Four Trump cabinet nominees have been to Davos in years past: Rick Perry (energy) once Rex Tillerson (state) three times Robert Lighthizer (trade) 15 times and Elaine Chao (transportation) four times. A few people who were once   crusaders  \u2014   like Ms. May of Britain  \u2014   are now insiders. And, depending how the political winds shift, more people of her ideological ilk may join the Davos class in 2018. This is not the first time that the World Economic Forum has come under fire from critics about its globalist,   message. In 2000, a group of more than 1, 000 demonstrators carrying signs that said \u201cAgainst the New World Order\u201d smashed the windows of a McDonald\u2019s franchise here in Davos just down the road from the conference, protesting open trade policies espoused by   Bill Clinton, who was speaking at the event. Many of today\u2019s policy makers and executives gathering here are expected to speak about the rise of populism and the need to adjust economic incentives. Hamdi Ulukaya, the chief executive of Chobani, the yogurt company, is expected to encourage business leaders to do more to address wealth building among employees he provided shares in his company to every   employee, making many of them millionaires. The question, of course, is whether those discussions can ever get beyond the theoretical for a group that is seen by many   voters as out of touch with the real economic challenges that people face. Conversations about income inequality, for example, have long had a tinge of class envy as opposed to a real appreciation for the basic jobs and wages that people are seeking. Still, with the word \u201cDavos\u201d being tossed around as an epithet, some politicians are staying away from the Alps this year. Ms. Merkel, for example, has passed on attending now for two years in a row, in the face of continued criticism among German voters that she is too much of a globalist. So why do so many policy makers and executives still covet an invitation? Because Davos remains the world\u2019s   shop to meet leaders from all corners of the globe. And despite the critiques of the gathering, a remarkable amount of business  \u2014   both political and corporate  \u2014   takes place behind the scenes. One thing is sure: The predictions made here  \u2014   known as the Davos consensus  \u2014   have a tendency to be wrong. Mr. Trump, with very few exceptions, was largely written off last year as a bad joke. \u201cIf you bother to read some of the serious analysis of Trump\u2019s support, you realize that it\u2019s a very fragile thing and highly unlikely to deliver what he needs in the crucial first phase of the primaries,\u201d Niall Ferguson, the historian, predicted at Davos in 2016, according to Bloomberg News. \u201cBy the time we get to   it\u2019s all over. I think there\u2019s going to be a wonderful catharsis, I\u2019m really looking forward to it: Trump\u2019s humiliation. Bring it on. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562181.074457}
