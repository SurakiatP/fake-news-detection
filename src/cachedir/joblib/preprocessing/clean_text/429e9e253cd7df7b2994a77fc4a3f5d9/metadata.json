[Valls\u2019 endorsement of Macron seals the rift between what the former premier has described as \u201ctwo irreconcilable lefts\u201d  \u2014   one still wedded to the class struggle, represented by presidential nominee Benoit Hamon, and another reformist camp led by Valls.  Successive Socialist leaders managed to hold the party together but under President Francois Hollande the tacit   pact between the two factions broke down, leaving the party in disarray. Le Parisien newspaper said Valls\u2019 repudiation of Hamon  \u2014   a leftist rebel who quit the government in 2014 over its   policies  \u2014   was the \u201cnail in the coffin\u201d of the party. The party of Francois Mitterrand that had acted as a broad church of the left since the 1970s \u201cdied yesterday, without panache, corroded by ideological and personal rivalries,\u201d the paper wrote. Valls\u2019 nod comes less than a month before the first round of the election on April 23, with polls showing Macron and   leader Marine Le Pen running   . Hamon is trailing in fifth place, behind conservative candidate Francois Fillon and   radical   Melenchon. The Socialist candidate had always been expected to struggle after five years of lacklustre rule under the unpopular Hollande. Valls said his decision to back Macron, who quit the Socialist government last year to form his own movement, En Marche (On the Move)  \u2014   styled as neither of the left nor right  \u2014   was \u201cnot a matter of the heart but of reason\u201d. \u201cI think you should not take any risks for the Republic\u201d Valls said, saying he did the \u201cresponsible\u201d thing in opting for the candidate tipped to easily beat Le Pen in May\u2019s election  . But for many on the left the endorsement smacked of treachery after Valls pledged to back the winner of the Socialist primary in January, in which he was the  . A furious Hamon on Wednesday urged voters to reject those who \u201cstabbed (me) in the back\u201d. A Socialist activist in Marseille lodged a criminal complaint against Valls for \u201cbreach of trust\u201d saying his disavowal of Hamon was \u201cthe straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. \u201d \u201cHe (Valls) lost\u201d in the primary,\u201d Sylvie   told AFP, calling on Valls to quit the party. \u201cIt was up to him to bridge the gap\u201d with Hamon.  \u2014   Bedfellows no more  \u2014   For Henry Rey, a political scientist at Sciences Po university in Paris, there are not two but three lefts in France: a liberal camp represented by Valls and Macron, a   camp led by Hamon and a radical camp led by Melenchon  \u2014   who is now the leading presidential contender on the left. On Wednesday, a bullish Melenchon rebuffed a desperate appeal by Hamon for the two to join forces. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that trying to make the various lefts cohabit no longer works, as demonstrated by the disastrous end to Hollande\u2019s presidency,\u201d Rey said. \u201cThe lines are being redrawn, which is a precondition for the recomposition of the left,\u201d he said. The lines are also shifting on the right, with Macron and the nationalist Le Pen draining support from the   Fillon. \u201cIt feels as if all the old political forces are dying before our very eyes,\u201d political analyst Pascal Perrineau said. Thibaut Rioufreyt, a researcher at Sciences Po university in Lyon, warned however against writing the obituary for the Socialist Party (PS). \u201cThe PS has become a federation of local politicians,\u201d he wrote in La Croix newspaper. \u201cIt will still exist but its positioning will change. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628324.274252}
