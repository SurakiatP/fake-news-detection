In a video posted on YouTube, spectators could be heard saying, \u201cOh my God, he just crashed it,\u201d as the nose of the aircraft made contact with the ground after an agonizingly slow descent at Cardington Airfield, about 40 miles north of London, before coming to rest. Hybrid Air Vehicles  \u2014   the British developer of the       aircraft, which has a top cruising speed of about 90 miles an hour  \u2014   said on Twitter that the crew members were \u201csafe and well. \u201d \u201cAirlander sustained damage on landing during today\u2019s flight,\u201d the company added, though \u201cno damage was sustained midair. \u201d The first test flight of the Airlander 10 was postponed on Aug. 14 after Stephen McGlennan, the chief executive of Hybrid Air Vehicles, said the airship had \u201ca slight technical issue. \u201d It completed its initial test flight three days later. On Wednesday morning, however, spectators watched as the ship slowly   and made an unplanned landing on its cockpit. The company did not provide an explanation as to why the aircraft had come down. \u201cIt was going so well,\u201d said Angela Hatwell, who posted several photographs of the aircraft on Facebook and described the airship\u2019s flight as an \u201cabsolutely amazing sight. \u201d \u201cIt was awful to watch,\u201d she wrote of the crash. One of Ms. Hartwell\u2019s photographs showed the pilots in what appeared to be a damaged cockpit. \u201cIt just appeared to crumple up,\u201d she wrote. \u201cLuckily they appeared to walk away uninjured. \u201d The Airlander 10 was initially a project developed for the United States military, and Hybrid Air Vehicles has said the airship could stay airborne for up to five days at a time with someone on board and for two weeks when flown remotely.'"}, "time": 1742561893.9067914}
