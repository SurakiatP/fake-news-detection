For Hillary Clinton. \\nThe Huffington Post pretends it\u2019s doing objective journalism. Nice try. No one has believed in HuffPo\u2019s objectivity for a long time. But now we have an email that seals the deal. \\nZero Hedge reports : \u201c\u2026the latest Podesta dump from WikiLeaks fully exposes the blatant collusion in black and white. In the following email chain, when asked whether she would like to join the board of a pro-democrat media consortium, PMUSA, Ariana graciously declines saying that she could be more useful to the Clinton campaign by pushing its agenda through the Huffington Post \u201cwithout any perceived conflicts\u201d. \u201cShe [Arianna] is enthusiastic abt the project but asks if she\u2019s more useful to us not being on the Board and, instead, using Huffpo to echo our [pro-Hillary] message without any perceived conflicts. She has a point.\u201d \u201cThe sender of the email is none other than Susan McCue, the former chief of staff to [Democrat Senator] Harry Reid while the recipients include John Podesta [Hillary\u2019s campaign chairman] and the ever controversial David Brock whose Super PAC, Correct the Record, has been sued for illegally coordinating with the Clinton campaign.\u201d \\nWell, isn\u2019t that wonderful. \\nArianna used to be married to Republican Congressman Michael Huffington. Then, she was a political conservative. After her divorce, from which she reportedly netted $25 million, she began to morph into a Progressive. With the financial ability to launch HuffPo, she kept on turning to the political Left. In the HuffPo merger with AOL, she came away with another $21 million. \\nHer opponents have pinned several labels on her: \u201cthe most upwardly mobile Greek since Icarus,\u201d and \u201cthe Sir Edmund Hillary of social climbing.\u201d \\nSo now she\u2019s an echo chamber for the Democratic Party. \\nThe Online Etymology Dictionary traces the root of \u201cecho\u201d: \u201c\u2026personified in classical [Greek] mythology as a mountain nymph who pined away for love of Narcissus until nothing was left of her but her voice\u2026\u201d \\nAnd now we\u2019ve confirmed for whom that Arianna-voice speaks. A great American narcissist, Hillary Clinton. \\nJon Rappoport is the author of three explosive collections, THE MATRIX REVEALED , EXIT FROM THE MATRIX , and POWER OUTSIDE THE MATRIX , Jon was a candidate for a US Congressional seat in the 29 th District of California.
