[Francis devoted his annual foreign policy speech to promoting peace at a time of mass migrations, economic stagnation and violent extremism across the globe.  He praised several European nations for taking in refugees and urged others to provide them with a \u201cdignified welcome\u201d while also fighting poverty and other social ills that can fuel religious fundamentalism. Speaking to ambassadors accredited to the Holy See, Francis urged Europe to rediscover its founding ideals as it marks the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, one of the key agreements leading to the creation of the European Union. \u201cEurope as a whole is experiencing a decisive moment in its history, one which it is called to rediscover its proper identity,\u201d Francis said. \u201cThis requires recovering its roots in order to shape its future. \u201d He called for the creation of a new European humanism to update the very concept of Europe as a unified community of shared common values that was born from the ashes of World War II. \u201cIn response to currents of divisiveness, it is all the more urgent to update \u2018the idea of Europe\u2019 so as to give birth to a new humanism based on the capacity to integrate, dialogue and generate that which made the Old Continent great,\u201d he said. Overall, he once again denounced violence committed in God\u2019s name as \u201chomicidal madness\u201d and the fruit of a \u201cspiritual poverty\u201d often borne of material poverty. He urged religious leaders to preach God\u2019s message of love and peace, and political leaders to ensure economic opportunities for young people. Governments, he said, must not only protect their own citizens but \u201censure that conditions do not exist that can serve as fertile terrain for the spread of forms of fundamentalism. \u201d On specific global flashpoints, Francis,  \u2014  appealed for serious negotiations to end the conflict in Syria,  \u2014  warned that North Korea\u2019s nuclear tests were destabilizing the entire region while raising questions about \u201cthe risk of a new nuclear arms race\u201d  \u2014  and called for trust, dialogue and \u201ccourageous gestures\u201d in Venezuela\u2019s political negotiations.'"}, "time": 1742563619.4513319}
