Several months later, after a process marred by procedural errors, five different panelists convened to rule on the matter again. The case involved a woman, a sophomore, who had met a player on Stanford\u2019s powerhouse football team at a fraternity party one Saturday night. They went back to her room where, she said, he raped her. He said they had consensual sex. Seeking to avoid the trauma of a police investigation, the accuser turned to the university\u2019s   disciplinary board, one of many on college campuses that adjudicate sexual assault cases, and it would decide whom to believe. If the panel had found that sexual assault had taken place, the man could have been expelled. Both times, three of the five panelists  \u2014   drawn from a pool of administrators, faculty members and students  \u2014   concluded that the man, who remained on the football team throughout the case and is on the roster for a bowl game Friday, committed sexual assault. At many schools, this simple majority vote would have been enough to find the accused responsible. But Stanford had set an uncommonly high bar, requiring at least a   decision. This year, amid growing dissent over how it handles these kinds of cases, Stanford changed its procedure in a way that victims rights advocates say favors the accused. It now requires a unanimous verdict from a   board, making it an outlier among prestigious universities. Only one other school (Duke) in U. S. News  World Report\u2019s list of the country\u2019s top 20 colleges that use such panels has such a stringent requirement. As awareness of sexual assault on college and university campuses has surged, institutions have struggled to balance the desire and legal obligation to cultivate a safe campus, where victims feel comfortable coming forward, with maintaining due process for the accused. At Stanford, however, that effort has set off a particularly vigorous debate, as a school that is an innovator across fields and has a sterling image to protect faces a community in which many believe it has fallen short of leading on one of the thorniest issues of the day. In the case with the football player, the woman, who had gotten a second hearing after presenting evidence of errors in the first proceeding, remains angry and has temporarily left the school to avoid the player. \u201cI realized that I got into this school and deserved to get an education here,\u201d the woman said in an interview. \u201cHe was a valued football player, but I had earned my right to be here, too. \u201d The man, who did not reply to repeated requests for comment, remains enrolled at Stanford and is expected to be a member of the team for its game against North Carolina in the Sun Bowl on Friday. Stanford officials said they could not talk about details of the case because of confidentiality rules and federal law. But they defended the system they have put in place to resolve sexual assault allegations. Stanford\u2019s decision to require a unanimous panel of three, in place since February 2016, stemmed from recommendations made by a task force last year. \u201cIn deciding we wanted     panelists, it made sense to go to a   panel,\u201d said Pamela S. Karlan, a Stanford Law professor who is now chairwoman of a sexual assault advisory committee, \u201cand having three people decide something by a preponderance of the evidence seemed to us the appropriate way of deciding whether a   sanction should be imposed on somebody for his or her behavior. \u201d Reports of sexual assaults on and around Stanford\u2019s campus increased to 39 in 2015, from 21 in 2010, according to data Stanford compiles under federal law, though it is possible victims were coming forward more often, rather than there being more attacks. Still, very few sexual assault cases that have gone through the university\u2019s internal process in recent years have led to any significant punishment for the accused, a fact that Stanford attributes to a rigorous but fair standard to guard against wrongful judgments. Advocates for sexual assault survivors consider it a sign of a system stacked against victims. A New York Times examination of the Stanford case concerning the football player, based in part on a review of more than 100 pages of documents from Stanford\u2019s proceedings, illuminates the school\u2019s struggles and pitfalls in adjudicating these kinds of cases. \u201cEveryone knows sexual assault on campus is a serious problem, and one that is very difficult to tackle,\u201d said David   a professor of comparative literature at Stanford and one of dozens of faculty members who have criticized the school\u2019s sexual assault policies. \u201cMany of my colleagues are deeply concerned about it,\u201d he said, \u201cand want Stanford to be a leader in addressing this issue assertively. \u201d The woman who made the accusation against the football player said that she decided to speak about it so the public might have a better understanding of the lapses that can occur when such cases are handled internally. The Times is not identifying her or the man she accuses of assault. Last season, as his case was proceeding, the football player was a regular for the Cardinal, which went   and won the   Conference title and the Rose Bowl. The football coach, David Shaw, a member of the N. C. A. A. Commission to Combat Campus Sexual Violence, said in an interview that he was aware that a \u201cproceeding was happening\u201d involving the player, but that he did not know the charge. He said he saw no reason to suspend him from the team without more information. The woman, now 22, frightened she might encounter the man on campus, left the university to study elsewhere last quarter and has not decided whether to return. After the case ended, she sought a temporary restraining order in state court against the man, but was denied, court records show, because the judge found that she did not demonstrate that there was an imminent threat. Stanford was empowered to handle the case internally by Title IX, a federal law dating to 1972 mandating equal access to higher education regardless of gender, and the United States Education Department\u2019s interpretation of that law as requiring universities to carry out investigations of alleged sex crimes on campus. Most campuses now operate under guidelines that the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights explained to university administrators in a 2011 letter aimed at making students feel safe to report allegations. It urged a legal threshold based on a preponderance of the evidence, the legal standard in civil cases, rather than the higher threshold of beyond a reasonable doubt, used in criminal cases. Many universities had used the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard, but the vast majority now have adopted the lower standard, including Stanford. At Stanford, the cases rely heavily on written statements from all parties produced by university staff members, rather than on interviews by detectives or forensic evidence, as in a police investigation, which some legal experts assert makes for a less proficient investigation. The accused and accuser appear separately before the panel. Each can submit   questions, for the panel to ask the other, but it does not have to use them. This procedure reflects the broad latitude universities have been given to set up their own methods of examining and adjudicating cases. Many cases never end up before law enforcement because the accusers refuse to cooperate, trusting their universities to take action. Often, the accusers simply want the accused expelled or kept at a safe distance. \u201cAll I really wanted was a   order,\u201d the woman said in an interview. \u201cI wanted little things to make being on campus more bearable. I knew he was never going to get suspended or expelled. That\u2019s what kept me moving forward. \u201d Several independent experts said universities\u2019 obligations to follow the law while supporting both the accused and the accuser as members of the campus community  \u2014   and looking out for their own institutional interests  \u2014   make flaws like those the woman found in her case all but inevitable. \u201cUnder Title IX, educational institutions are responsible for being all things to all people: the caregiver, the impartial investigator, adjudicator, sanctioner, trainer and preventer,\u201d Gina Maisto Smith, a former prosecutor whose practice at the   law firm Pepper Hamilton includes advising colleges on Title IX compliance, wrote in an email. \u201cAs much as schools are doing it better  \u2014   and they are  \u2014   and as much as they try to separate the   process from the provision of resources and support, many, if not most, institutions lack the resources and dedicated personnel to separate and fulfill each of these roles effectively,\u201d she added. \u201cEven if schools have the resources to do so, exercising oversight of the entire process often leads to a perception of institutional bias and a lack of faith in the reliability of outcomes. \u201d Advocates for sexual assault victims say that Stanford\u2019s process has made it more difficult for accusers to receive rulings in their favor. Critics say the university has done this to protect its public image Stanford maintains it wants to ensure fairness to the accused in a proceeding with standards lower than a criminal case. \u201cImagine a senior, who has paid four years of Stanford tuition,\u201d said John W. Etchemendy, the outgoing provost, explaining why Stanford\u2019s system includes significant protections against adverse findings for accused students. \u201cBeing expelled is really a   punishment,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we as an institution have a duty to take that very seriously. \u201d This high bar for accusers has left the university open to criticism from victims\u2019 rights advocates. \u201cThey are very keen on protecting the brand over supporting survivors,\u201d said Stephanie Pham, a   of the Stanford Association of Students for Sexual Assault Prevention. \u201cIf you ask, \u2018Do I feel safe on campus?\u2019 I do. When something happens, though, will Stanford protect me? The feeling is, no, they won\u2019t. To have prevention, you need to hold people accountable. They haven\u2019t. \u201d Earlier this month, Stanford was sued by a student who accused the university of failing to protect her from a student who she says sexually assaulted her after Stanford had heard at least one sexual assault complaint about him. He was sanctioned only belatedly, barred from campus for 10 years  \u2014   after he graduated. The university called the suit \u201cunfounded. \u201d Michele Dauber, a Stanford law professor and vocal critic of the university\u2019s policies on sexual assaults, declined to comment on the case involving the football player because she did not know the specifics of it. But she said she doubted that the university\u2019s proceedings complied with Title IX  \u2014   particularly its requirement to have unanimous rulings, the standard in criminal cases, though Stanford\u2019s proceedings are administrative actions. \u201cYou have to look at the process holistically, and when you see a series of hurdles and roadblocks, this becomes a very unfriendly place, if not one of the most unfriendly in the nation,\u201d said Ms. Dauber, one of five Stanford professors (including Mr.  ) who wrote an open letter in December 2015 to the provost complaining about the new policy. \u201cThe victim should not need to garner three votes to win while the respondent needs to garner only one. That is basic inequality. \u201d While defending current protocols, Stanford officials acknowledged that the school had relied on a flawed process for investigating campus sexual assault in years past. Before 2010, such cases were handled through the same disciplinary process as less egregious offenses like cheating. Rarely did claims result in students being expelled. That system, Mr. Etchemendy acknowledged, \u201cwas not  . \u201d Stanford then set up what it called the Alternative Review Process, which included the panels that the woman who accused the football player went through. Of the 22 cases adjudicated by its panels, 13 resulted in a finding that the accused had acted improperly. Yet only one student has been expelled for sexual assault since 2014, Stanford officials said, with a few others voluntarily withdrawing, which Stanford counts as an expulsion. (Among them was Brock Turner, the Stanford swimmer whose criminal sentence of six months in jail for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman on campus in 2015 received notoriety for its perceived leniency.) When the new policy was rolled out in February, the aim was to make expulsion the \u201cexpected\u201d punishment for sexual assault, though after a panel determines that sexual assault has occurred, it must also decide unanimously to expel a student. Under the new system, one case has produced an expulsion. That outcome came through a \u201c  resolution\u201d process  \u2014   also in the new system  \u2014   allowing the Title IX coordinator to propose a resolution of the case acceptable to both students, forgoing a hearing. It is a process that some other universities have decided is inappropriate to apply to sexual assault cases  \u2014   it potentially creates pressure for an accuser to negotiate with an assailant  \u2014   and that the Department of Education has discouraged. Stanford officials said 10 of 16 cases so far under the current system had been decided in this way. But some faculty members, as well as lawyers who have represented accusers in the process, have objected to this option, calling it a form of plea bargaining. \u201cIt is frustrating because universities should be getting this right, and they are not, and the idea that they can keep pushing this under the rug doesn\u2019t make the campus any safer, as we keep seeing as these incidents come to light,\u201d said Crystal Riggins, a lawyer who has represented accusers at Stanford. \u201cThe process is complex and takes a long time. It is very difficult to get a   decision from a panel, and these young women are terrified and traumatized and just want it to be done. \u201d The woman who agreed to talk about her case described an arduous process that took nearly nine months and, she said, was plagued by several lapses. On the afternoon of June 25, 2015, the woman, along with her lawyer, took their places at a crowded table inside the Tresidder Memorial Union at Stanford. Her lawyer was there only for support and was prohibited, under the rules of the proceeding, from guiding her testimony. In the middle of the table was a telephone for the young man to listen to the proceeding. She had about 30 minutes to give her account of what had happened four months earlier. Afterward, the football player was allowed to email   questions to the panel that they could decide to ask or not. She began the hearing feeling that the deck was stacked against her. She said that only the night before did she see the accused\u2019s statement for the first time, and that it included new statements from two of his football teammates. She said she had exchanged emails with an administrator in May and June 2015 and \u201cnot once\u201d did that administrator \u201cindicate that any other files had been added to the investigation file, nor did she respond to my previous questions regarding the investigation file,\u201d according to her appeal, which included the email exchange with an assistant dean coordinating the process. When she asked to postpone the hearing so she could ask for redactions of statements that she deemed prejudicial as well as suggest   questions for an investigator to ask the witnesses, she said she was denied without an explanation. \u201cI was told to stick to the facts on my statement, and I did,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was allowed to speculate on why I \u2018targeted\u2019 him. His teammates, who were not even involved in that night, basically said he was a great guy and was being punished for consensual sex. \u201d After listening to his version, she said that she offered   questions to the panel. She said that they did not ask them. The next day she was notified that a majority of the panel agreed with her that a sexual assault had occurred, but the football player would not be given a finding of responsibility. By then, she said, she had already missed one quarter of school and would eventually miss two. She was, and remains, in therapy and on anxiety medications. Within days, with the help of a lawyer, she appealed the decision on the grounds that the \u201cinvestigation process was so inequitable and unfair\u201d that it violated her rights as a victim of sexual assault under Title IX. Along with numerous procedural errors, she said, she was bothered that the man\u2019s status as a football player was injected into the proceedings by him and his teammates. Mr. Etchemendy, the provost, insisted there was no special treatment for athletes or anyone else. Despite two   rulings that the football player had committed sexual assault, Mr. Etchemendy said, the coach of the football team would not have been notified because the player had not been found responsible. The player apparently received no punishment. \u201cUnless there is reason  \u2014   for safety  \u2014   we do not inform the individuals\u2019 teachers, their conductor in the choir if they\u2019re in the choir, the football coach if they\u2019re on the football team, or any other head of an activity that they participate in,\u201d Mr. Etchemendy said. Before the second hearing, the panel saw statements from the accused that said he had been \u201creassured\u201d by Stanford\u2019s Title IX investigator that \u201csituations like these more times than not result in nothing,\u201d and that a lawyer for the Associated Students of Stanford University had reviewed his response and advised some changes, \u201cbut mostly began to sympathize with me,\u201d and said that \u201cwhat I was going through was unfair. \u201d The administrator organizing the hearing acknowledged that those statements should have been redacted because they were not testimony germane to whether a sexual assault had occurred. (Under the new system, an outside lawyer decides what will be allowed as evidence.) After the second   panel came back   the accuser appealed again. She asked that Stanford\u2019s Office of Community Standards \u201cissue a   order to protect me\u201d from the accused. One had been in place throughout the months of proceedings. On at least two occasions, the football player had to be asked to leave parties by a resident dean  \u2014   and on another, by campus security  \u2014   because of his apparently violating that order, both the accuser and the accused acknowledged in statements. \u201cThe past nine months of my life have been the worst of my life,\u201d she wrote to Greg Boardman, Stanford\u2019s vice provost for student affairs, on Oct. 20, 2015, as part of her appeal. \u201cI\u2019ve experienced fear, anxiety, depression,   and hatred in ways I never imagined during the first 20 years of my life. An introduction to someone new in early February turned into my worst nightmare  \u2014   every woman\u2019s worst nightmare. \u201d Her appeal for a third hearing and a   order was denied, without explanation. Stanford said that it accommodates accusers even after their cases come up short. They can secure special housing arrangements or even escorts to certain parts of campus. But officials said that they could not impose anything that looked like penalties, even for safety reasons, on those who are found not responsible  \u2014   even if the vote found by   or, now,   that sexual assault had occurred. \u201cI think you would face legal liability to that person if after that process he was told, \u2018You can\u2019t be in this part of the campus,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Karlan, the law professor who is chairwoman of the sexual assault advisory committee. The woman is trying to decide whether to return to campus or pursue her degree elsewhere. She said that she loved the school and that she was never happier than in her time there. She is worried about encountering the football player if she returns to campus. \u201cBut do I have to leave Stanford to feel safe?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m certain that this isn\u2019t the way the Title IX process was meant to work. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563093.219152}
