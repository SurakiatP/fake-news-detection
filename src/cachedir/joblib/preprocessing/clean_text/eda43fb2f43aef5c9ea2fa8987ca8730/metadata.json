Senators voted 52 to 46 to confirm Mr. Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general who has built a career out of suing to block the E. P. A. \u2019s major environmental rules and has called for the dissolution of much of the agency\u2019s authority. One Republican, Susan Collins of Maine, crossed party lines to vote against Mr. Pruitt, while two Democrats, Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, both from   states where voters generally oppose environmental rules, voted for him. Democrats railed all night on the Senate floor against Mr. Pruitt and urged Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, to delay the confirmation vote until after next Tuesday, when the Oklahoma attorney general\u2019s office is under order to release about 3, 000 of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s emails related to his communications with the fossil fuel industry. But the effort did little but deprive Democrats of sleep. Democrats, environmental groups and even current E. P. A. employees have harshly criticized Mr. Pruitt\u2019s record of fighting the mission of the agency he will now lead, as well as his close ties with the fossil fuel industry he will now regulate. Both opponents and supporters of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s say he is well positioned to carry out Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign trail promises to dismantle the agency and slash its ranks of employees. Mr. Trump vowed to \u201cget rid\u201d of the agency \u201cin almost every form. \u201d A 2014 investigation by The Times found that energy lobbyists drafted letters for Mr. Pruitt to send, on state stationery, to the E. P. A. outlining the economic hardship of the environmental rules. Many of the coal, oil and gas companies represented by those lobbyists were also some his largest campaign contributors. Mr. Pruitt also worked jointly with those companies in filing multiple lawsuits against major E. P. A. regulations. Democrats say the emails to be released on Tuesday could reveal more, and possibly disqualifying, information about those relationships. \u201cI reminded my colleagues that the release of these documents could be imminent and that we would be wise wait to vote on Mr. Pruitt\u2019s nomination until we had the opportunity to review them  \u2014   and shame on us if we didn\u2019t,\u201d said Senator Thomas R. Carper of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee. \u201cMr. Pruitt has been nominated by a man who, as a nominee, as a   and now as president, has made clear his goals to degrade and destroy the E. P. A. ,\u201d Mr. Carper said. \u201cLike many things President Trump says, we ask ourselves, \u2018Did he mean it?\u2019 With the nomination of Mr. Pruitt, it\u2019s clear he did. \u201d For many Republicans, that appears to be part of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s appeal. During the Obama administration, Mr. McConnell became a leading opponent of the president\u2019s climate change agenda, particularly its centerpiece, a set of E. P. A. regulations intended to shut down heavily polluting   power plants and replace them with wind and solar power. Those rules, if enacted, could disproportionately hurt the economy of Mr. McConnell\u2019s   state. Mr. Pruitt, who has expressed skepticism about   global warming, has been a key architect of the legal battle to overturn the rules. \u201cPruitt is just the candidate we need at the helm of the E. P. A. ,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cHe\u2019s exceptionally qualified. He\u2019s dedicated to environmental protection. And, as someone with state government experience, he understands the   consequences of E. P. A. actions and knows that balance is the key to making policies that are sustainable over the  . \u201d Mr. McConnell added: \u201cWe should confirm him. Doing so will represent another positive change in Washington that can give hope to families in Kentucky and across the nation who are still recovering from the last eight years. \u201d Within days of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s   Mr. Trump is expected to sign one or more executive orders aimed at undoing Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change policies, people familiar with the White House\u2019s plans said. While it will be impossible to undo the rules immediately, the presidential signatures would give Mr. Pruitt his marching orders to commence the   to   legal process of withdrawing the   climate rules and replacing them with looser, more   rules. It is also possible that under Mr. Pruitt, the Trump administration could pursue the bold legal strategy of challenging the underlying legal requirement that the federal government regulate   greenhouse gases in the first place. Already, Mr. Pruitt has begun work to reshape the environmental agency. Among the candidates he has interviewed for top positions are several former senior staff members in the office of his fellow Oklahoma Republican, Senator James M. Inhofe, who has become known as Congress\u2019s most prominent denier of the science of global warming.'"}, "time": 1742561710.2223926}
