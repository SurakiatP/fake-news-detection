{"duration": 0.9799342155456543, "input_args": {"text": "'Until Nov. 8, 2016, historians of American politics shared a rough consensus about the rise of modern American conservatism. It told a respectable tale. By the end of World War II, the story goes, conservatives had become a scattered and obscure remnant, vanquished by the New Deal and the apparent reality that, as the critic Lionel Trilling wrote in 1950, liberalism was \u201cnot only the dominant but even the sole intellectual tradition. \u201d Year Zero was 1955, when William F. Buckley Jr. started National Review, the   magazine whose aim, Buckley explained, was to \u201carticulate a position on world affairs which a conservative candidate can adhere to without fear of intellectual embarrassment or political surrealism. \u201d Buckley excommunicated the John Birch Society,   and supporters of the hyperindividualist Ayn Rand, and his cohort fused the diverse schools of conservative thinking  \u2014   traditionalist philosophers, militant   libertarian economists  \u2014   into a coherent ideology, one that eventually came to dominate American politics. I was one of the historians who helped forge this narrative. My first book, \u201cBefore the Storm,\u201d was about the rise of Senator Barry Goldwater, the uncompromising National Review favorite whose refusal to exploit the violent backlash against civil rights, and whose bracingly idealistic devotion to the Constitution as he understood it  \u2014   he called for Social Security to be made \u201cvoluntary\u201d  \u2014   led to his crushing defeat in the 1964 presidential election. Goldwater\u2019s loss, far from dooming the American right, inspired a new generation of conservative activists to redouble their efforts, paving the way for the Reagan revolution. Educated whites in the prosperous metropolises of the New South sublimated the frenetic, violent anxieties that once marked race relations in their region into more palatable policy concerns about \u201cstable housing values\u201d and \u201cquality local education,\u201d backfooting liberals and transforming conservatives into mainstream champions of a set of positions with enormous appeal to the white American middle class. These were the factors, many historians concluded, that made America a \u201ccenter right\u201d nation. For better or for worse, politicians seeking to lead either party faced a new reality. Democrats had to honor the public\u2019s distrust of activist government (as Bill Clinton did with his call for the \u201cend of welfare as we know it\u201d). Republicans, for their part, had to play the Buckley role of denouncing the political surrealism of the paranoid fringe (Mitt Romney\u2019s furious backpedaling after joking, \u201cNo one\u2019s ever asked to see my birth certificate\u201d). Then the nation\u2019s   birther ran for president. Trump\u2019s campaign was surreal and an intellectual embarrassment, and political experts of all stripes told us he could never become president. That wasn\u2019t how the story was supposed to end. National Review devoted an issue to writing Trump out of the conservative movement an editor there, Jonah Goldberg, even became a leader of the \u201cNever Trump\u201d crusade. But Trump won  \u2014   and some conservative intellectuals embraced a man who exploited the same brutish energies that Buckley had supposedly banished. The professional guardians of America\u2019s past, in short, had made a mistake. We advanced a narrative of the American right that was far too constricted to anticipate the rise of a man like Trump. Historians, of course, are not called upon to be seers. Our professional canons warn us against presentism  \u2014   we are supposed to weigh the evidence of the past on its own terms  \u2014   but at the same time, the questions we ask are conditioned by the present. That is, ultimately, what we are called upon to explain. Which poses a question: If Donald Trump is the latest chapter of conservatism\u2019s story, might historians have been telling that story wrong? American historians\u2019 relationship to conservatism itself has a troubled history. Even after Ronald Reagan\u2019s   landslide in 1980, we paid little attention to the right: The central narrative of America\u2019s political development was still believed to be the rise of the liberal state. But as Newt Gingrich\u2019s   revolutionaries prepared to take over the House of Representatives in 1994, the scholar Alan Brinkley published an essay called \u201cThe Problem of American Conservatism\u201d in The American Historical Review. American conservatism, Brinkley argued, \u201chad been something of an orphan in historical scholarship,\u201d and that was \u201ccoming to seem an    omission. \u201d The article inaugurated the boom in scholarship that brought us the story, now widely accepted, of conservatism\u2019s triumphant rise. That story was in part a rejection of an older story. Until the 1990s, the most influential writer on the subject of the American right was Richard Hofstadter, a colleague of Trilling\u2019s at Columbia University in the postwar years. Hofstadter was the leader of the \u201cconsensus\u201d school of historians the \u201cconsensus\u201d being Americans\u2019 supposed agreement upon moderate liberalism as the nation\u2019s natural governing philosophy. He didn\u2019t take the   conservatives of his own time at all seriously. He called them \u201cpseudoconservatives\u201d and described, for instance, followers of the   Republican senator Joseph McCarthy as cranks who salved their \u201cstatus anxiety\u201d with conspiracy theories and bizarre panaceas. He named this attitude \u201cthe paranoid style in American politics\u201d and, in an article published a month before Barry Goldwater\u2019s presidential defeat, asked, \u201cWhen, in all our history, has anyone with ideas so bizarre, so archaic, so   so remote from the basic American consensus, ever gone so far?\u201d It was a strangely ahistoric question many of Goldwater\u2019s ideas hewed closely to a   American distrust of statism that goes back all the way to the nation\u2019s founding. It betokened too a certain willful blindness toward the evidence that was already emerging of a popular backlash against liberalism. Reagan\u2019s gubernatorial victory in California two years later, followed by his two landslide presidential wins, made a mockery of Hofstadter. Historians seeking to grasp conservatism\u2019s newly revealed mass appeal would have to take the movement on its own terms. That was my aim when I took up the subject in the late 1990s  \u2014   and, even more explicitly, the aim of Lisa McGirr, now of Harvard University, whose 2001 book, \u201cSuburban Warriors: The Origins of the New American Right,\u201d became a cornerstone of the new literature. Instead of pronouncing upon conservatism from on high, as Hofstadter had, McGirr, a social historian, studied it from the ground up, attending respectfully to what activists understood themselves to be doing. What she found was \u201ca highly educated and thoroughly modern group of men and women,\u201d normal participants in the \u201cbureaucratized world of   War II America. \u201d They built a \u201cvibrant and remarkable political mobilization,\u201d she wrote, in an effort to address political concerns that would soon be resonating nationwide  \u2014   for instance, their anguish at \u201cliberal permissiveness\u201d about matters like rising crime rates and the teaching of sex education in public schools. But if Hofstadter was overly dismissive of how conservatives understood themselves, the new breed of historians at times proved too credulous. McGirr diligently played down the sheer bloodcurdling hysteria of conservatives during the period she was studying  \u2014   for example, one California senator\u2019s report in 1962 that he had received thousands of letters from constituents concerned about a rumor that Communist Chinese commandos were training in Mexico for an imminent invasion of San Diego. I sometimes made the same mistake. Writing about the movement that led to Goldwater\u2019s 1964 Republican nomination, for instance, it never occurred to me to pay much attention to McCarthyism, even though McCarthy helped Goldwater win his Senate seat in 1952, and Goldwater supported McCarthy to the end. (As did William F. Buckley.) I was writing about the modern conservative movement, the one that led to Reagan, not about the brutish relics of a more gothic,   and supposedly incoherent reactionary era that preceded it. A few historians have provocatively followed a different intellectual path, avoiding both the bloodlessness of the new social historians and the psychologizing condescension of the old Hofstadter school. Foremost among them is Leo Ribuffo, a professor at George Washington University. Ribuffo\u2019s surname announces his identity in the Dickensian style: Irascible, brilliant and deeply learned, he is one of the profession\u2019s great rebuffers. He made his reputation with an   1983 study, \u201cThe Old Christian Right: The Protestant Far Right From the Great Depression to the Cold War,\u201d and hasn\u2019t published a proper book since  \u2014   just a series of coruscating essays that frequently focus on what everyone else is getting wrong. In the 1994 issue of The American Historical Review that featured Alan Brinkley\u2019s \u201cThe Problem of American Conservatism,\u201d Ribuffo wrote a response contesting Brinkley\u2019s contention, now commonplace, that Trilling was right about American conservatism\u2019s shallow roots. Ribuffo argued that America\u2019s   traditions were far more deeply rooted in the past, and far angrier, than most historians would acknowledge, citing a long list of examples from \u201cregional suspicions of various metropolitan centers and the snobs who lived there\u201d to \u201cwhite racism institutionalized in slavery and segregation. \u201d After the election, Ribuffo told me that if he were to write a similar response today, he would call it, \u201cWhy Is There So Much Scholarship on \u2018Conservatism,\u2019 and Why Has It Left the Historical Profession So Obtuse About Trumpism?\u201d One reason, as Ribuffo argues, is the conceptual error of identifying a discrete \u201cmodern conservative movement\u201d in the first place. Another reason, though, is that historians of conservatism, like historians in general, tend to be liberal, and are prone to liberalism\u2019s traditions of politesse. It\u2019s no surprise that we are attracted to polite subjects like \u201ccolorblind conservatism\u201d or William F. Buckley. Our work might have been less obtuse had we shared the instincts of a New York University professor named Kim  . \u201cHistorians who write about the right should find ways to do so with a sense of the dignity of their subjects,\u201d she observed in a 2011 review, \u201cbut they should not hesitate to keep an eye out for the bizarre, the unusual, or the unsettling. \u201d Looking back from that perspective, we can now see a history that is indeed unsettling  \u2014   but also unsettlingly familiar. Consider, for example, an essay published in 1926 by Hiram Evans, the imperial wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, in the exceedingly mainstream North American Review. His subject was the decline of \u201cAmericanism. \u201d Evans claimed to speak for an abused white majority, \u201cthe   Nordic race,\u201d which, \u201cwith all its faults, has given the world almost the whole of modern civilization. \u201d Evans, a former dentist, proposed that his was \u201ca movement of plain people,\u201d and acknowledged that this \u201clays us open to the charge of being hicks and \u2018rubes\u2019 and \u2018drivers of secondhand Fords. \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d But over the course of the last generation, he wrote, these good people \u201chave found themselves increasingly uncomfortable, and finally deeply distressed,\u201d watching a \u201cmoral breakdown\u201d that was destroying a   nation. First, there was \u201cconfusion in thought and opinion, a groping and hesitancy about national affairs and private life alike, in sharp contrast to the clear, straightforward purposes of our earlier years. \u201d Next, they found \u201cthe control of much of our industry and commerce taken over by strangers, who stacked the cards of success and prosperity against us,\u201d and ultimately these strangers \u201ccame to dominate our government. \u201d The only thing that would make America great again, as it were, was \u201ca return of power into the hands of everyday, not highly cultured, not overly intellectualized, but entirely unspoiled and not   average citizens of old stock. \u201d This \u201cSecond Klan\u201d (the first was formed during Reconstruction) scrambles our   sense of what   ideology does and does not comprise. (Its doctrines, for example, included support for public education, to weaken Catholic parochial schools.) The Klan also put the predations of the international banking class at the center of its rhetoric. Its worldview resembles, in fact, the   politics of contemporary Europe  \u2014   a tradition, heretofore judged foreign to American politics, called \u201cherrenvolk republicanism,\u201d that reserved social democracy solely for the white majority. By reaching back to the reactionary traditions of the 1920s, we might better understand the alliance between the \u201c \u201d figures that emerged as fervent Trump supporters during last year\u2019s election and the ascendant   nativist political parties in Europe. None of this history is hidden. Indeed, in the 1990s, a rich scholarly literature emerged on the 1920s Klan and its extraordinary, and decidedly national, influence. (One hotbed of Klan activity, for example, was Anaheim, Calif. McGirr\u2019s \u201cSuburban Warriors\u201d mentions this but doesn\u2019t discuss it neither did I in my own account of Orange County conservatism in \u201cBefore the Storm. \u201d Again, it just didn\u2019t seem relevant to the subject of the modern conservative movement.) The general belief among historians, however, was that the Klan\u2019s national influence faded in the years after 1925, when Indiana\u2019s grand dragon, D. C. Stephenson, who served as the de facto political boss for the entire state, was convicted of murdering a young woman. But the Klan remained relevant far beyond the South. In 1936 a group called the Black Legion, active in the industrial Midwest, burst into public consciousness after members assassinated a Works Progress Administration official in Detroit. The group, which considered itself a Klan enforcement arm, dominated the news that year. The F. B. I. estimated its membership at 135, 000, including a large number of public officials, possibly including Detroit\u2019s police chief. The Associated Press reported in 1936 that the group was suspected of assassinating as many as 50 people. In 1937, Humphrey Bogart starred in a film about it. In an informal survey, however, I found that many leading historians of the right  \u2014   including one who wrote an important book covering the 1930s  \u2014   hadn\u2019t heard of the Black Legion. Stephen H. Norwood, one of the few historians who did study the Black Legion, also mined another rich seam of neglected history in which   vigilantism and outright fascism routinely infiltrated the mainstream of American life. The story begins with Father Charles Coughlin, the   \u201cradio priest\u201d who at his peak reached as many as 30 million weekly listeners. In 1938, Coughlin\u2019s magazine, Social Justice, began reprinting \u201cProtocols of the Learned Elders of Zion,\u201d a forged tract about a global Jewish conspiracy first popularized in the United States by Henry Ford. After presenting this fictitious threat, Coughlin\u2019s paper called for action, in the form of a \u201ccrusade against the   forces of the red revolution\u201d  \u2014   a call that was answered, in New York and Boston, by a new organization, the Christian Front. Its members were among the most enthusiastic participants in a 1939   rally that packed Madison Square Garden, where the leader of the   Bund spoke in front of an enormous portrait of George Washington flanked by swastikas. The Bund took a mortal hit that same year  \u2014   its leader was caught embezzling  \u2014   but the Christian Front soldiered on. In 1940, a New York chapter was raided by the F. B. I. for plotting to overthrow the government. The organization survived, and throughout World War II carried out what the New York Yiddish paper The Day called \u201csmall pogroms\u201d in Boston and New York that left Jews in \u201cmortal fear\u201d of \u201calmost daily\u201d beatings. Victims who complained to authorities, according to news reports, were \u201cinsulted and beaten again. \u201d Young   men inspired by the Christian Front desecrated nearly every synagogue in Washington Heights. The New York Catholic hierarchy, the mayor of Boston and the governor of Massachusetts largely looked the other way. Why hasn\u2019t the presence of organized mobs with backing in powerful places disturbed historians\u2019 conclusion that the American right was dormant during this period? In fact, the \u201cfar right\u201d was never that far from the American mainstream. The historian Richard   writing in the journal Social History, points out that \u201cscholars of American history are by and large in agreement that, in spite of a welter of fringe radical groups on the right in the United States between the wars, fascism never \u2018took\u2019 here. \u201d And, unlike in Europe, fascists did not achieve governmental power. Nevertheless,   continues, \u201cfascism had a very real presence in the U. S. A. comparable to that on continental Europe. \u201d He cites no less mainstream an organization than the American Legion, whose \u201cNational Commander\u201d Alvin Owsley proclaimed in 1922, \u201cthe Fascisti are to Italy what the American Legion is to the United States. \u201d A decade later, Chicago named a thoroughfare after the Fascist military leader Italo Balbo. In 2011,   groups in Chicago protested a movement to rename it.   in America declined after World War II. But as Leo Ribuffo points out, the underlying narrative  \u2014   of a diabolical transnational cabal of aliens plotting to undermine the very foundations of Christian civilization  \u2014   survived in the   diatribes of Joseph McCarthy. The alien narrative continues today in the work of National Review writers like Andrew McCarthy (\u201cHow Obama Embraces Islam\u2019s Sharia Agenda\u201d) and Lisa Schiffren (who argued that Obama\u2019s parents could be secret Communists because \u201cfor a white woman to marry a black man in 1958, or \u201960, there was almost inevitably a connection to explicit Communist politics\u201d). And it found its most potent expression in Donald Trump\u2019s stubborn insistence that Barack Obama was not born in the United States. Trump\u2019s connection to this alternate   genealogy is not just rhetorical. In 1927, 1, 000 hooded Klansmen fought police in Queens in what The Times reported as a \u201cfree for all. \u201d One of those arrested at the scene was the president\u2019s father, Fred Trump. (Trump\u2019s role in the melee is unclear the charge  \u2014   \u201crefusing to disperse\u201d  \u2014   was later dropped.) In the 1950s, Woody Guthrie, at the time a resident of the Beach Haven housing complex the elder Trump built near Coney Island, wrote a song about \u201cOld Man Trump\u201d and the \u201cRacial   stirred   the bloodpot of human   he   color line\u201d in one of his housing developments. In 1973, when Donald Trump was working at Fred\u2019s side, both father and son were named in a federal   suit. The family settled with the Justice Department in the face of evidence that black applicants were told units were not available even as whites were welcomed with open arms. The 1960s and \u201970s New York in which Donald Trump came of age, as much as   Indiana in the 1920s or Barry Goldwater\u2019s Arizona in the 1950s, was at conservatism\u2019s cutting edge, setting the emotional tone for a politics of rage. In 1966, when Trump was 20, Mayor John Lindsay placed civilians on a board to more effectively monitor police abuse. The president of the Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Association  \u2014   responding, \u201cI am sick and tired of giving in to minority groups and their gripes and their shouting\u201d  \u2014   led a referendum effort to dissolve the board that won 63 percent of the vote. Two years later, fights between supporters and protesters of George Wallace at a Madison Square Garden rally grew so violent that, The New Republic observed, \u201cnever again will you read about Berlin in the \u201930s without remembering this wild confrontation here of two irrational forces. \u201d The rest of the country followed New York\u2019s lead. In 1970, after the shooting deaths of four students during antiwar protests at Kent State University in Ohio, a Gallup poll found that 58 percent of Americans blamed the students for their own deaths. (\u201cIf they didn\u2019t do what the Guards told them, they should have been mowed down,\u201d one parent of Kent State students told an interviewer.) Days later, hundreds of construction workers from the World Trade Center site beat antiwar protesters at City Hall with their hard hats. (\u201cIt was just like Iwo Jima,\u201d an impressed witness remarked.) That year, reports the historian Katherine Scott, 76 percent of Americans \u201csaid they did not support the First Amendment right to assemble and dissent from government policies. \u201d In 1973, the reporter Gail Sheehy joined a group of   workers watching the Watergate hearings in a bar in Astoria, Queens. \u201cIf I was Nixon,\u201d one of them said, \u201cI\u2019d shoot every one of them. \u201d (Who \u201cthey\u201d were went unspecified.) This was around the time when New Yorkers were leaping to their feet and cheering during screenings of \u201cDeath Wish,\u201d a hit movie about a liberal architect, played by Charles Bronson, who shoots muggers at   range. At an October 2015 rally near Nashville, Donald Trump told his supporters: \u201cI have a license to carry in New York, can you believe that? Nobody knows that. Somebody attacks me, oh, they\u2019re gonna be shocked. \u201d He imitated a   quick draw, and an appreciative crowd shouted out the name of Bronson\u2019s     film: \u201c\u2019u2009\u2018Death Wish\u2019!\u201d In 1989, a young white woman was raped in Central Park. Five teenagers, four black and one Latino, confessed to participating in the crime. At the height of the controversy, Donald Trump took out   ads in all the major New York daily papers calling for the return of the death penalty. It was later proved the police had essentially tortured the five into their confessions, and they were eventually cleared by DNA evidence. Trump, however, continues to insist upon their guilt. That confidence resonates deeply with what the sociologist Lawrence Rosenthal calls New York\u2019s \u201c  populism\u201d  \u2014   an attitude, Rosenthal hypothesizes, that Trump learned working alongside the tradesmen in his father\u2019s real estate empire. But the case itself also resonates deeply with narratives dating back to the first Ku Klux Klan of white womanhood defiled by dark savages. Trump\u2019s public call for the supposed perpetrators\u2019 hides, no matter the proof of guilt or innocence, mimics the rituals of Southern lynchings. When Trump vowed on the campaign trail to Make America Great Again, he was generally unclear about when exactly it stopped being great. The Vanderbilt University historian Jefferson Cowie tells a story that points to a possible answer. In his book \u201cThe Great Exception,\u201d he suggests that what historians considered the main event in 20th century American political development  \u2014   the rise and consolidation of the \u201cNew Deal order\u201d  \u2014   was in fact an anomaly, made politically possible by a convergence of political factors. One of those was immigration. At the beginning of the 20th century, millions of impoverished immigrants, mostly Catholic and Jewish, entered an overwhelmingly Protestant country. It was only when that demographic transformation was suspended by the 1924 Immigration Act that majorities of Americans proved willing to vote for many liberal policies. In 1965, Congress once more allowed   immigration to the United States  \u2014   and it is no accident that this date coincides with the increasing conservative backlash against liberalism itself, now that its spoils would be more widely distributed among nonwhites. The liberalization of immigration law is an obsession of the  . Trump has echoed their rage. \u201cWe\u2019ve admitted 59 million immigrants to the United States between 1965 and 2015,\u201d he noted last summer, with rare specificity. \u201c\u2019u2009\u2018Come on in, anybody. Just come on in.\u2019 Not anymore. \u201d This was a stark contrast to Reagan, who venerated immigrants, proudly signing a 1986 bill, sponsored by the conservative Republican senator Alan Simpson, that granted many undocumented immigrants citizenship. Shortly before announcing his 1980 presidential run, Reagan even boasted of his wish \u201cto create, literally, a common market situation here in the Americas with an open border between ourselves and Mexico. \u201d But on immigration, at least, it is Trump, not Reagan, who is the apotheosis of the brand of conservatism that now prevails. A\u2019u2009puzzle remains. If Donald Trump was elected as a Marine Le    \u2014   or Hiram    \u2014   herrenvolk republican, what are we to make of the fact that he placed so many bankers and billionaires in his cabinet, and has relentlessly pursued so many    policies? More to the point, what are we to the make of the fact that his supporters don\u2019t seem to mind? Here, however, Trump is far from unique. The history of    between conservative electioneering and conservative governance is another rich seam that calls out for fresh scholarly excavation: not of how conservative voters see their leaders, but of the neglected history of how conservative leaders see their voters. In their 1987 book, \u201cRight Turn,\u201d the political scientists Joel Rogers and Thomas Ferguson presented   data demonstrating that Reagan\u2019s crusade against activist government, which was widely understood to be the source of his popularity, was not, in fact, particularly popular. For example, when Reagan was   in 1984, only 35 percent of voters favored significant cuts in social programs to reduce the deficit. Much excellent scholarship, well worth revisiting in the age of Trump, suggests an explanation for Reagan\u2019s subsequent success at cutting back social programs in the face of hostile public opinion: It was business leaders, not the general public, who moved to the right, and they became increasingly aggressive and skilled in manipulating the political process behind the scenes. But another answer hides in plain sight. The   negotiation between populist electioneering and plutocratic governance on the right has long been not so much a matter of policy as it has been a matter of show business. The media scholar Tim Raphael, in his 2009 book, \u201cThe President Electric: Ronald Reagan and the Politics of Performance,\u201d calls the   commercials that interrupted episodes of The General Electric Theater  \u2014   starring Reagan and his family in their     Pacific Palisades home, outfitted for them by G. E.  \u2014   television\u2019s first \u201creality show. \u201d For the California voters who soon made him governor, the ads created a sense of Reagan as a certain kind of character: the kindly paterfamilias, a trustworthy and nonthreatening guardian of the white   suburban enclave. Years later, the producers of \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d carefully crafted a Trump character who was the quintessence of steely resolve and   mastery. American voters noticed. Linda Lucchese, a Trump convention delegate from Illinois who had never previously been involved in politics, told me that she watched \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d and decided that Trump would make a perfect president. \u201cAll those celebrities,\u201d she told me: \u201cThey showed him respect. \u201d It is a short leap from advertising and reality TV to darker forms of manipulation. Consider the parallels since the 1970s between conservative activism and the traditional techniques of con men.   pioneers like Richard Viguerie created       letters about civilization on the verge of collapse. One 1979 pitch warned that \u201cfederal and state legislatures are literally flooded with proposed laws that are aimed at total confiscation of firearms from   citizens. \u201d Another, from the 1990s, warned that \u201cbabies are being harvested and sold on the black market by Planned Parenthood clinics. \u201d Recipients of these alarming missives sent checks to battle phony crises, and what they got in return was very real tax cuts for the rich. Note also the more recent connection between Republican politics and \u201cmultilevel marketing\u201d operations like Amway (Trump\u2019s education secretary, Betsy DeVos, is the wife of Amway\u2019s former president and the    of its  ) and how easily some of these marketing schemes shade into the promotion of dubious miracle cures (Ben Carson, secretary of housing and urban development, with \u201cglyconutrients\u201d Mike Huckabee shilling for a \u201csolution kit\u201d to \u201creverse\u201d diabetes Trump himself taking on a     multilevel marketing scheme in 2009). The dubious grifting of Donald Trump, in short, is a part of the structure of conservative history. Future historians won\u2019t find all that much of a foundation for Trumpism in the grim essays of William F. Buckley, the scrupulous constitutionalist principles of Barry Goldwater or the   optimism of Ronald Reagan. They\u2019ll need instead to study conservative history\u2019s political surrealists and intellectual embarrassments, its con artists and tribunes of white rage. It will not be a pleasant story. But if those historians are to construct new arguments to make sense of Trump, the first step may be to risk being impolite.'"}, "time": 1742562633.492033}
