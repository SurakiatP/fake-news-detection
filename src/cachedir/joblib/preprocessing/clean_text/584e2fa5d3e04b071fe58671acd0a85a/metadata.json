Things were safer then, and the economy was strong\u2014it was just a better time. But it\u2019s all gone downhill ever since. We just don\u2019t have the same values anymore.\u201d Moulton then reportedly shook his head and said that while he would love for the country to get back to the good old days of November 8 and earlier, realistically he knew that would never happen.
