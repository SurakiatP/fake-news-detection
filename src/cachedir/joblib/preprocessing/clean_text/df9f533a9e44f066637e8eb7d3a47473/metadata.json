However, the media misjudged the electorate before November 8 and they are misjudging it again. It\u2019s the Democratic Party that faces an uncertain future. \\nIn an MSNBC broadcast before Election Day, MTV\u2019s Ana Marie Cox said the results might just mean that the GOP would \u201ccease to be a national party\u201d because the demographic trends were in favor of Democrats, and the Democrats had \u201creclaimed the mantle of patriotism\u201d and \u201creclaimed the mantle of faith.\u201d \\nHost Lawrence O\u2019Donnell agreed, asking, \u201cAre you looking for in tomorrow night\u2019s results \u2026the beginning of the discussion within the Republican Party about how to rebuild itself into something resembling a coherent party?\u201d Former Jeb Bush communications director and \u201cpolitical strategist\u201d Tim Miller said, \u201cI have a lot of pessimism about where the party goes.\u201d \\nAfter the results came in, left-wing journalist John Nichols became despondent, writing in his most recent column that \u201cThe Democratic Party had not lost a presidential race in Wisconsin since 1984. But it did in 2016. The Democratic Party had not lost a Wisconsin U.S. Senate race in a presidential election year since 1980. But it did in 2016.\u201d \\nBut it gets worse. \u201cThe Democratic Party has been decimated in the state Legislature,\u201d he writes from Wisconsin, \u201cwith a Senate caucus that looks likely to have 13 seats (the smallest total since Richard Nixon was president) and an Assembly caucus with 35 members (the smallest total since Dwight Eisenhower was president).\u201d \\nIn Wisconsin, as noted by Wisconsin Public Radio, Republican Governor Scott Walker will have his biggest GOP majorities yet when lawmakers return to Madison next year. \\nNichols, who writes for The Capital Times, says the Democratic Party of Wisconsin \u201cis going to need to rethink and remake itself,\u201d but that \u201cthis is not just a Wisconsin problem. This is a national crisis.\u201d His solution is to elect a radical Muslim, Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN), as chairman of the Democratic National Committee. \\nFrank Gaffney of the Center for Security Policy rightly notes , \u201cOne would think that the last thing Democrats want to publicize after their wholesale repudiation by American voters is their party\u2019s ties to radical leftists and Islamic supremacists.\u201d Yet, he goes on, that will be the \u201cpredictable effect\u201d of Ellison leading the Democratic National Committee. \\nNichols is not alone in recommending Ellison as DNC chair. Ellison is backed by Senators Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Charles Schumer (D-NY) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). \\nGoing further left, in this case embracing a \u201cfiery critic of Israel,\u201d is starting to attract some media scrutiny. The embrace of Ellison could be interpreted as a death wish by the Democratic Party. \\nThe political situation has changed dramatically. Five years ago Nichols was telling the Democratic Socialists of America that the progressive movement was on the move, and that this process of revolutionary change would continue. So what happened? Simply put, the Democratic Party abandoned the working class, once considered the cornerstone of the Marxist revolution. \\nScott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing , calls it \u201cThe Blue Collar Election.\u201d He says, \u201cA week has passed since election night, and if it wasn\u2019t clear then, it is now: Economic pain in the industrial states is real and has shocked our politics.\u201d \\nIn order for the Republican Party to take advantage of this dramatic shift, President-elect Donald Trump has to get tough with foreign countries. Kevin L. Kearns, president of the U.S. Business & Industry Council, says that Trump will face a lot of opposition as he pursues a \u201cbalanced trade\u201d agenda. His antagonists include \u201cWall Street institutions, multinational corporations, major business organizations, academic economists, editorial boards, business journalists, opinion writers, bloggers, and the generally knowledge-free mainstream media,\u201d Kearns writes . \\nHis remark about a \u201cknowledge-free mainstream media\u201d is right on target. But as we have seen in coverage of the campaign and their predictions about the results, a lack of knowledge hasn\u2019t stopped the media from claiming to be knowledgeable. \\nThe media may sound stupid, but they must realize that if the Republicans are able to accommodate the interests of their new Blue Collar constituency and bring forth a balanced trade and pro-growth agenda, the Democrats will be left with a constituency consisting of a few Muslims, some gays and transgenders, student debt-laden young people, and the radical pro-abortion feminist lobby. It\u2019s difficult to see how the Democrats can assemble a majority out of that.
