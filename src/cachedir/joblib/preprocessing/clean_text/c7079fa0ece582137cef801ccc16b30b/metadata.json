[\u201cAs I come here to the floor: I chaired the committee, the Environment and Public Works Committee, on Scott Pruitt\u2019s nomination,\u201d said Sen. John Barrasso (R. .) in the minutes before the bipartisan vote that saw two Democrats joining the Republican majority, West Virginia\u2019s Sen. Joseph Manchin and North Dakota\u2019s Sen. Heidi Heitkamp. One Republican voted against the nomination, Maine\u2019s Sen. Susan Collins.  \u201cI listened to six and a half hours of testimony,\u201d Barrasso said. \u201cI listened and read through responses that he gave to 1, 200 questions being asked of him. He gave thorough answers. Perhaps not the answer the Democrats wanted to hear but answers that I felt were responsive. \u201d Barrasso took the nomination out of his committee by invoking a special rule approved by the Senate parliamentarian office, because Democrats boycotted the committee\u2019s vote on Pruitt, which robbed the committee of a quorum. The chairman said despite the opposition from Senate Democrats, Pruitt was an excellent choice to run the EPA. \u201cHe is a nominee who, as Attorney General in Oklahoma, protected the environment, worked to strengthen the economy, and stood up for state\u2019s rights, which continues to be most crucial. \u201d Outsider businessman Sen. David Perdue (R. .) said 0n the Senate floor Pruitt is the key man for lifting the regulatory burden off the private enonomy. \u201cScott Pruitt will return some sanity to the EPA, which over the past eight years has overzealously issued thousands of regulations with little environmental benefit, all while ignoring the high economic cost,\u201d he said. \u201cI look forward to working with Mr. Pruitt and President Trump to scale back the EPA and provide farmers, businesses, and the American people with some relief after eight years of blatant overreach,\u201d he said. Senate Democrats did not have the votes to defeat Pruitt\u2019s nomination, but they exercised the option to use all 30 hours of debate allotted to each confirmation, as they have with most of the other nominees. To eat up the clock, Senate Republicans have extended the chamber\u2019s sessions and scheduled votes in the early morning hours, if that was when the debate time was running out. When senators came to Capitol Hill Friday morning, they were armed with news that a judge ordered Pruitt to turn over thousands of emails as part of an Open Records Request by an Oklahoma television station. Minority Leader Sen. Charles Schumer (D. . Y.) held a press less than four hours before the vote, where he and other Senate Democrats demanded that the Pruitt confirmation vote be delayed until Feb. 27. Rhode Island Democrat Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said the delay was necessary to fully understand Pruitt\u2019s relationship with the industry figures in his home state. \u201cTime will tell and facts will come out, but I believe our Republican friends will rue the day that they had this nomination rammed through the Senate on the very day that the emails were being litigated in Oklahoma, in order to get ahead of any  . \u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R. .)  \u2014   at his own press conference after Schumer\u2019s  \u2014   dismissed any calls for delay as more of the same. \u201dMy overarching goal will be to lead in a way that our future generations inherit a better and healthier environment.\u201d  \u2014   Scott Pruitt, @EPA pic. twitter.   \u2014   Senate Republicans (@SenateGOP) February 17, 2017,  The Pruitt vote was scheduled for 1 p. m. but at 12:30 p. m. Sen. Al Franken (D. .) took to the floor to challenge the language used by Barrasso earlier in the day. Barrasso was making the point that Democratic tactics were not sincere. \u201cThese delays are all about obstruction,\u201d the Wyoming senator said. \u201cThey\u2019re all about denying President Trump his cabinet  \u2014   that\u2019s what this all about. It\u2019s about pretending that their candidate, Hillary Clinton, didn\u2019t lose the election in November. \u201d Franken said this characterization was a violation of Senate Rule XIX, which forbids senators from questioning the motives or impugning the character of another senator. This was the same rule Republicans used to call out and silence Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D. .) during the floor debate for Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 confirmation. Unlike Warren, Franken did not force a vote after the presiding officer denied his point of order. But Fraken did walk from his own desk in the back rows to the well of the chamber to hash it out with Barrasso and McConnell. Americans believe that a great country deserves safe drinking water, clean air, and a hospitable environment. That\u2019s where @EPA comes in. pic. twitter.   \u2014   Sen. Al Franken (@SenFranken) February 17, 2017,  Barrasso was clearly ticked off, and Franken gestured with his index finger at Barrasso, saying that it was not right to say that the Democrats were acting as if Clinton won the election. Before the exchange between the two senators got more serious, McConnell told Franken that he had lost his sense of humor. This brought Franken to a  . Then, smiling broadly, he told McConnell: \u201cDon\u2019t tell me Mr. Majority Leader that I have lost my sense of humor. That is not impugning my motives \u2014  that is impugning my career!\u201d With the point of order resolved, Franken then made a motion requesting the debate on the Pruitt confirmation extend another 248 hours \u2014  through the recess. That vote went down on party lines,  . Sen. John McCain (R. .) and Sen. Joseph Donnelly (D. .) were not at the Capitol. When senators return Feb. 27, they are scheduled to vote on the nomination of businessman Wilbur Ross for Commerce Secretary.'"}, "time": 1742562115.7032754}
