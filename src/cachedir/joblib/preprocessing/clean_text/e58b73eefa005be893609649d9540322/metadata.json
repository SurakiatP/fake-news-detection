The existence of racial terror is not a singular phenomenon in our country\u2019s national archive. Consider 2015, a feverish June night in South Carolina, when Dylann Roof, feeding off racist conspiracy theories, walked into Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church and murdered nine black parishioners. Then reach back almost 20 years before that, to 1998, when James Byrd Jr. a black man, was abducted by three white men and fatally dragged from the back of a pickup truck along unforgiving Texas asphalt. Then there is perhaps the most monstrous application of racial terror in our historical register: Aug. 28, 1955, when    Emmett Till was lynched. The events of that bitter morning, their motivations and ramifications, have found a meticulous, if not their most exhaustive, retelling in Timothy B. Tyson\u2019s \u201cThe Blood of Emmett Till,\u201d an account of absorbing and sometimes horrific detail. Comprehensive in scope, its final 60 pages alone are a catalog of notes and sources. Tyson is a senior research scholar at Duke University and the author of \u201cBlood Done Sign My Name,\u201d about the 1970 lynching of Henry Marrow in Tyson\u2019s hometown, and he tracks Till\u2019s life from Argo, Ill. to Chicago, to his last moments in Money, Miss. where  \u2014   despite the hesitation of his mother, Mamie  \u2014   Till had sojourned with relatives. On a Wednesday evening in August, Till allegedly flirted with and grabbed the hand of Carolyn Bryant, a white woman who worked as the cashier at a local market. According to recovered court transcripts released by the F. B. I. in 2007, he let out a \u201cwolf whistle\u201d as she exited the store to get a gun from her car. Bryant later informed her husband and his half brother, who proceeded to uphold a grim tradition: Till was abducted, beaten, shot in the head and thrown into the Tallahatchie River. A   gin fan was tied to his neck with barbed wire, with the hope that he would never be found. Black life in America has endured as little more than a fragile truth in the hands of white aggressors. And Tyson does well to remind us just how   racial terror can be when wielded with brute force: \u201cAffronted white supremacy drove every blow. \u201d There are a number of facts to parse in this book  \u2014   such as Till\u2019s affinity for straw hats on churchgoing Sundays, and the sheriff\u2019s belief that the body recovered from the river was part of an \u201cN. A. A. C. P.  scheme\u201d to disgrace Mississippi  \u2014   but none perhaps more profoundly consequential than Bryant\u2019s own admission to Tyson that the events that led to Till\u2019s death didn\u2019t happen as she had previously attested. Outside private correspondence with her attorney, trial testimony and her unpublished memoir, Bryant remained   about her interaction with Till. In 2008, in her only interview since that fateful season of death, Bryant admitted to Tyson that a crucial piece of her testimony in court was fabricated. Till never \u201cgrabbed her around the waist and uttered obscenities,\u201d as she had avowed on the witness stand. \u201cYou tell these stories for so long that they seem true,\u201d she confesses early in the book, \u201cbut that part is not true. \u201d And so we are left with a sobering certainty, one that even Bryant herself is forced to concede to Tyson, more than 50 years later: \u201cNothing that boy did could ever justify what happened to him. \u201d The sum of history is made up of recurring patterns. Each new decade has brought past sins to the fore. From Emmett Till and Henry Marrow to Amadou Diallo, Rekia Boyd and Alton Sterling. These deaths,   lynchings that have taken new shapes, are simply the mores and modes of a   American custom: white supremacy. \u201cThe real horror comes when your dead brain must face the fact that we as a nation don\u2019t want it to stop,\u201d the novelist Chester Himes wrote to The New York Post upon hearing that Till\u2019s murderers were acquitted. \u201cIf we wanted to, we would. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564154.2521617}
