But as Republicans sifted through the detritus of their failed effort to replace the Affordable Care Act, they were finding fault almost everywhere they looked. President Trump, posting on Twitter on Sunday, saw multiple culprits, including the renegade group of   conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus and outside groups like the Club for Growth. Those groups, which do not always work placidly together, had aligned against the president and Speaker Paul D. Ryan, the ultimate symbol of their dismay with the entrenched ways of the capital. At the same time, some saw the president as pointing a finger at Mr. Ryan when Mr. Trump urged his Twitter followers on Saturday to tune in to a Fox News host, Jeanine Pirro, who went on to call for Mr. Ryan\u2019s resignation. For eight years, those divisions were often masked by Republicans\u2019 shared antipathy toward President Barack Obama. Now, as the party struggles to adjust to the   political order, it is facing a nagging question: How do you hold together when the man who unified you in opposition is no longer around? Mr. Obama provided conservatives with not just a health law to loathe and a veto pen to blame, but also a visage that allowed their opposition to be more palpable. \u201cWith Obama no longer being there, the emotional element of the opposition is drained away,\u201d said Rich Lowry, the editor of the conservative National Review. Republicans also have to contend with an outsider president who never had much of an affinity or loyalty for their party, and who, as a novice politician, has not built the relationships in Washington that are usually needed to get big deals done. \u201cThere\u2019s this disjunction,\u201d Mr. Lowry added. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a congressional party. He doesn\u2019t even really have a wing of a congressional party. \u201d In the health care fight, it was not just the far right, egged on by   outside groups, that split from the Republican leadership. There were dissenters among the more     conservative lawmakers, those representing suburban communities outside Philadelphia and Washington and rural states like Louisiana. Even party leaders like Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen of New Jersey, the powerful chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, opposed the bill. Interest groups on the right were also divided, with natural allies like Americans for Tax Reform, the   outfit, and Americans for Prosperity, a   group backed by the Koch brothers, on opposing sides. While Republicans often said they would deliver freedom and good fortune if given their turn at the wheel, they are now jolted by the realization that their struggles to reach a consensus have thrown into doubt whether they can reach deals on other priorities like a tax overhaul, infrastructure, trade and immigration. \u201cIt is a challenge for the modern Republican Party and the Trump administration to figure out how to get to 218 on a regular basis,\u201d said Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform, who supported the Republican health care bill that failed last week. Generally, 218 is the number of votes needed to pass legislation in the House. Mr. Norquist said the desire for sweeping change had distorted some conservatives\u2019 perceptions about what could be achieved and how quickly. \u201cThey want to change the rules,\u201d he added. \u201cBut until you actually change the rules, they\u2019re there, and you have to live by them. \u201d In a sign of just how deeply this episode has shaken the conservative faction of the party, one of the Freedom Caucus\u2019s members resigned in protest on Sunday, saying he no longer believed the group was effective. \u201cSaying no is easy, leading is hard, but that is what we were elected to do,\u201d said the lawmaker, Representative Ted Poe of Texas. What makes progress on any issue so complicated is the fundamental clash between the belief systems of Mr. Trump, whose instincts are more populist than conservative, and Republican leaders in Congress, who are more oriented toward a     policy vision. \u201cTrump, whatever else he is, was able to see that what was being offered to Republicans was not really what they wanted,\u201d said David Frum, the conservative writer and a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush. \u201cThey wanted more health care for themselves, less immigration and no more Bushes. And what they were offered was no more health care, more immigration and a third Bush. \u201d The Trump administration wants to focus next on a tax overhaul. And on that Mr. Trump will probably find agreement with the Republicans in Congress. But crafting a plan that pleases most conservatives will not be simple. They remain split on some crucial details, like taxing imports. Some in the party, like Mr. Ryan, have favored such a plan, while others, like the   political advocacy groups, argue that it could set off trade wars and drive up manufacturing costs. Speaking to the dismay among many on the right after the health care fight, Ann Coulter, the writer and pundit, attacked Mr. Ryan for pursuing \u201cstandard G. O. P. corporatist stuff. \u201d \u201cWhat made Donald Trump stand apart from the crowd, and apart from the crowd from every presidential candidate for 20 years,\u201d she said on Fox\u2019s \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight,\u201d \u201cwas immigration, trade, infrastructure, building a wall. Obviously, that was very, very popular. \u201d As for Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter post on Saturday, a White House official said that it and Ms. Pirro\u2019s attack on Mr. Ryan were a coincidence, but the president has been pressed by some advisers to consider Mr. Ryan\u2019s role in the health care defeat. How Republicans resolve issues of debt and deficit spending also loom as tripwires to the kind of legislative progress Mr. Trump craves  \u2014   especially after a rocky start to his presidency. These issues, which Mr. Ryan and many other Republicans have been waiting eagerly to tackle since they took power, are not especially important to Mr. Trump, who is more focused on the kinds of projects that are natural to him as a developer, like infrastructure. And esoteric debates over deficit spending will not matter nearly as much to voters as how their personal finances look. \u201cWhen he goes back to Rochester in a   campaign, he can\u2019t talk about what\u2019s changed in the deficit  \u2014   no one will care,\u201d said Frank Cannon, a longtime conservative activist. \u201cBut if he can talk about labor rate participation, jobs, jobs that are paying more, that\u2019s what he\u2019ll be judged on. And that\u2019s what Republicans are going to live and die by in the next election cycles as long as he\u2019s president of the United States. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563725.5557451}
