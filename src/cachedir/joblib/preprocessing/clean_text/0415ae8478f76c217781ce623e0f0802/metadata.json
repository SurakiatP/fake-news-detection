I\u2019ve never been much a fan of the whole cliche of changing because of the new year, but why not embrace it as a time where we can make change?\\nDo a quick reflection right now. Do you feel like you have followed your dreams and passions this past year? Do you feel you got caught up in the stresses of life quite often? Did you feel judgement, negative self talk and anger were a big part of your days? Reflecting on how you\u2019ve felt over your year and being honest with yourself about it gives you the chance to know how to adjust and move forward from this moment forward whether it be the new year or not.\\nI\u2019ve found in my own life that if I don\u2019t pay attention to how I feel, what I create, what\u2019s playing out in my life and take responsibility for it, it doesn\u2019t change. It stays the same, I experience the same emotions or stagnant feelings, and I don\u2019t move forward. But the moment I decide to take it into my own hands, I see how much I\u2019m not a victim to what happens.\\n11 Things To Let Go of Before the New year 1. Stop all the negative self talk \u2013 It\u2019s first because it\u2019s probably one of the most important. The more we talk poorly about ourselves to ourselves or others, the more we disempower ourselves and empower all the things we wish to adjust about ourselves. Observe it, take note of it, and kick it. It\u2019s not helping you.\\n2. Choose one bad eating habit and kick it! \u2013 Taking care of and fuelling your vessel is one of the most important things we can do in life to stay mentally, emotionally and spiritually healthy. Pick one of your worst eating habits and aim to cut it out completely in 3 months. Whatever it might be, be honest with yourself and make it happen. Then take on the next bad eating habit in 3 months.\\n3. Let go of chasing \u2018success\u2019 \u2013 So often we put up goals or plans for ourselves yet have this tiny limited scope of what success is. Next thing you know we bring stress, worry and fear into the equation throughout the whole journey because we may not be totally in line to hit this pin prick point of what success looks like to us. Instead, do your best to take the steps needed to get to where you want to go, but let go of the lure of success and what it looks like and means. There\u2019s no such thing as failure. (more) \\n4. Kick the idea that you cannot achieve or follow your dreams \u2013 So often we have our ideas of what we are excited or passionate about, but let it go because we think we can\u2019t do it or because it\u2019s unrealistic. Instead of believing every word of that, take ONE step. One step towards making your passion or your dreams happen. The one step will lead to the next and the next, but you have to take the first one. Plan out that first step and take it!\\n5. Let go of the idea that you should run from your problems \u2013 We often get into this mentality that we just need to \u201cget over it.\u201d In theory this sounds sorta good, you move on from things that happen in the past or something to that effect. But by just forgetting about it, did we really move on? No, it gets triggered again later or lies dormant as a resented event etc. Instead, let\u2019s face our problems and truly move past them. Journal about it, talk to someone else about it. Put the cards on the table to someone who cares about you and who can help you move past it. Pick someone who will see the bigger picture and be honest with you. You have all it takes to move past what challenges you.\\n6. Stop comparing yourself to others \u2013 This is a big one. So often we are looking at others and using what they have, do or are to compare it against us and make up a story. This whole game can make us sad or feel down about ourselves or it can feed our ego in a big way. Let it go, respect everyone\u2019s journey, including your own and stop the need to compare yourself to others.\\n7. Stop judging others \u2013 Judging other people can become a habit and an addiction. It\u2019s like something we can\u2019t stop doing sometimes! Take a moment the next time you judge someone and observe it. Ask yourself why you did it, how did it make you feel? Etc. Make a conscious effort to stop. (more) \\n8. Stop the blame game \u2013 Blaming and pointing fingers when it comes to our challenges or what happens to us doesn\u2019t allow us to look at and observe how we might have created or aligned with an experience to help make it happen. I\u2019m not saying there\u2019s no such things others can do to hurt you, I\u2019m simply saying take responsibility for how you feel and don\u2019t even point blame, it doesn\u2019t help us.\\n9. Stop worrying and trying so hard to fit in and be accepted \u2013 This is something far too many of us do just to save face and not be \u201cthe weird one.\u201d The reality is, it\u2019s more \u2018weird\u2019 to be a version of yourself that isn\u2019t genuine or real simply because you want to be accepted by others. It\u2019s a choice you can\u2019t maintain forever and the longer it goes the more uncomfortable you will feel. Be you, accept yourself, be genuine and don\u2019t try to make others do the same when. Let it happen. Trust.\\n10. Let go of the need to control everything \u2013 Sometimes we can\u2019t take a step forward in anything because we don\u2019t know all the answers or all the variables. This is our obsession with control sometimes. Yes, observe a situation and make the best choices available to you, but don\u2019t worry so much about needing to control or know every detail about it. Learn to leave things up to trust and knowing that things will work out as they need to. This doesn\u2019t mean be reckless, just that you don\u2019t need to control every thing, person and detail.\\n11. Stop procrastinating \u2013 This one goes with everything on the list. Stop putting it all off. Whatever it may be. The changes listed above, the hobby you want to, the career you want to explore, or the thing you want to tell to someone important to you. Stop putting it off and just do it!\\n'"}, "time": 1742562970.720724}
