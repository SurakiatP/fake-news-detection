I\u2019m referring, of course, to Stephen Colbert. When \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert\u201d began on CBS in September 2015, it came with enormous expectations and risks. Mr. Colbert was following in David Letterman\u2019s footsteps as well as his own, having created a satirical performance piece for the ages on Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cThe Colbert Report. \u201d His move to a   late night show might have been a reinvention of the form it might have been a bust. Instead, for most of the year, it just   \u2026     was. There was the occasional newsworthy interview, like his emotional September talk with Vice President Joe Biden, grieving the recent loss of his son. There were a few experiments, like letting the director Spike Jonze shoot a   video in which Mr. Colbert shared an existential moment with Grover from \u201cSesame Street. \u201d Night by night, \u201cLate Show\u201d was fine but inessential. Even as a flabbergasting election unfolded, you were less likely to think, \u201cWhat is Stephen Colbert going to say about this?\u201d than \u201cI wonder what Stephen Colbert would have said about this. \u201d Then, for the two weeks of the conventions, \u201cLate Show\u201d aired live, and it came back to life. Mr. Colbert brought his old buffoonish conservative commentator character back, bearing a Captain America shield, with guest appearances by his old compadre Jon Stewart. He brought out Laura Benanti to spoof Melania Trump\u2019s plagiarism scandal. He ambushed the stages of both conventions in character as the \u201cHunger Games\u201d host Caesar Flickerman. The combination of live TV and   politics was like a comedy speedball that \u201cLate Show\u201d injected straight into its heart. Where had CBS been keeping this guy? And how can we keep him on the air? Obviously, only so much of this   special is reproducible  . Mr. Colbert isn\u2019t likely to start doing a live show every night, nor to band together with Mr. Stewart to   the old Comedy Central   lineup on CBS. But the convention weeks showed off strengths that \u201cLate Show\u201d can and should keep playing to. The most important: Don\u2019t waste Mr. Colbert\u2019s time and ours on topics and guests he\u2019s not engaged in. When he\u2019s had to host stars plugging movies or read off questions to the 2016 Super Bowl\u2019s most valuable player, Von Miller (in his live special after the big game) it felt like the job was defining Mr. Colbert instead of him defining the job. For the last two weeks, Mr. Colbert was focused almost entirely on the most important thing going on in the country and the culture, and his interest and energy showed. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean doing nothing but politics. Mr. Colbert is not that boring. His interview with Mr. Biden had political overtones  \u2014   the vice president was still considering a presidential run. But what made it great was how Mr. Colbert drew on his humanity and Catholic faith to dive deep to the stuff that mattered. He can pull off celebrity interviews, too, when there\u2019s a real shared interest, as when he and   Key recently geeked out on their love of improv. Speaking of which: Mr. Colbert\u2019s revival of his Comedy Central character and his zany turn as Flickerman reminded us that he\u2019s TV\u2019s best performance artist not currently running for president. \u201cLate Show\u201d might want to let him try on more characters. It could also cultivate a stable of other performers  \u2014   Mr. Colbert also worked well as ringmaster and hype man for Mr. Stewart and Ms. Benanti. But letting Mr. Colbert be Mr. Colbert will definitely mean politics, and these days, that\u2019s inevitably going to mean alienating viewers. After the Orlando, Fla. terrorist shooting in June, Mr. Colbert took apart Donald J. Trump\u2019s response by diagraming a word cloud of the candidate\u2019s insinuations  \u2014   \u201cObama,\u201d \u201csomething going on,\u201d \u201cradical Islam\u201d  \u2014   and the connecting lines formed a swastika. It was savage and hilarious and guaranteed to turn off a sizable chunk of the electorate. Mr. Colbert has tried to spread his fire around. When the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, decried big money in politics at the Democratic convention, he snarked that her outcry \u201cresounded throughout every corner of the Wells Fargo Arena, from the CNN Grill to the Comcast Xfinity Live complex!\u201d But clearly nothing fires his satirical synapses right now like Mr. Trump. That\u2019s the guy CBS hired, though. He couldn\u2019t be a Johnny Carson or Jay Leno, amiably poking at the nonpartisan foibles of both sides for a   audience, even if that were still possible today. And it isn\u2019t. That sort of comedy was a product of a less polarized political era, one with less niche programming and more swing voters, with liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats, with some consensus on the basic functions of government.     comedy doesn\u2019t work when the road no longer has a middle wide enough to ride a bicycle down. That\u2019s why, where past \u201cTonight\u201d hosts made light fun of politics, today Jimmy Fallon is most effective when he avoids politics altogether. He\u2019s good at it, and the ratings are great. It\u2019s a familiar coping mechanism for people burned out by apocalyptic news and vitriolic social media feeds: Please, let\u2019s just not talk about it for an hour. But the cerebral Mr. Colbert is not a    kind of guy that is his bug and his feature. I don\u2019t pretend to know whether his show\u2019s   drift was driven by CBS, Mr. Colbert\u2019s artistic desire to grow and move on, or both. His convention shows suggested, though, a way to change without renouncing his past works  \u2014   just as Mr. Letterman eventually found a distinctive voice on his \u201cLate Show\u201d while hanging on to signature features like the   list. On Wednesday night of the second week, Mr. Colbert announced some bad news: Because of an   complaint, he could never use the original \u201cStephen Colbert\u201d character, or his commentary segment \u201cThe W\u00f8rd,\u201d again. Instead, he was bringing on \u201cStephen Colbert,\u201d the original character\u2019s \u201cidentical twin cousin,\u201d and introducing a new commentary feature, \u201cThe Werd. \u201d \u201cI cannot reasonably argue,\u201d Mr. Colbert deadpanned, \u201cthat I own my face or my name. \u201d But in so doing, he very much did own it: He is who he is. And there\u2019s no reason for his show to fight it.'"}, "time": 1742628340.0749424}
