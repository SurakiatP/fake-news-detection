Kyle, now 68, says she had a decades-long affair with   before and during his marriage and had a front-row seat to Bill\u2019s salacious double-life in the 1970s and \u201980s. Their on-again, off-again relationship ended abruptly in the 1990s, after Bill Clinton allegedly threatened to \u2018destroy\u2019 Kyle if she spoke to the media about their relationship. Kyle\u2019s decades of observations, shared in an interview with the DailyMail.com as well as in her 2016 book The Other Woman, provide a unique perspective on the Clintons\u2019 marriage and the couple\u2019s treatment of the women who have accused   of infidelity or sexual assault over the years. Kyle, an Arkansas native who has since befriended several of Bill Clinton\u2019s sexual assault accusers, said she was determined to come forward with her story after hearing Hillary Clinton say on the campaign trail that women who have been sexually assaulted have the \u2018right to be believed\u2019.  35  '"}, "time": 1742561691.8546555}
