Rays strike the optic nerve, which signals the pituitary gland, triggering the release of hormones and neurotransmitters that regulate our bodily functions. \\nThe mitochondria of each cell in the human body produce almost one\u2019s entire bodyweight in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) per day (!) and the human body can only live for 15 seconds without it, as compared to 4-10 minutes without air, 3-4 days without water. Another shocking thing we learn is that we only receive 1/3rd of what is converted into ATP from the food we eat. The overwhelming percentage of our ATP production comes from the light we receive through our eyes and skin. \\nWith many of us staring at screen devices or spending most of our time indoors with energy-saving LED lighting, few of us are aware of the adverse effects that LEDs have on retinal health, hormonal health and mental health, because these do not emit the correct frequency of light, in order for us to produce ATP. \\nDr. Mercola calls his conversation with Dr. Wunsch \u201cOne he most important interviews you will ever see.\u201d SF Source Forbidden Knowledge TV Nov. 2016 Share this:'"}, "time": 1742563139.5296502}
