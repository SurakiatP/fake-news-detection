Xiao, Harvard Crimson, October 27, 2016 \\nA group of Asian American students is planning to protest the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert and Sullivan Players\u2019 upcoming production of \u201cThe Mikado\u201d for how it handles the racial stereotypes that characterize traditional performances of the opera. \\nOrganized by George S. Qiao \u201918, the group of students had publicized their protest over various email lists, describing what they consider inadequate attempts to remove the Japanese stereotypes and appropriation of Japanese culture that remained latent in the adapted production\u2019s storyline. But later Qiao said that he thought the tone of his initial concerns was unfair to the Players. \\n\u201cI fully believe that members of the Gilbert and Sullivan Players put their blood, sweat, and tears into trying to improve this staging of the production,\u201d Qiao said. \u201cHowever, I believe that there is still insufficient critical engagement [with] this play\u2019s history of Japanese cultural misrepresentation.\u201d \\nPenned in 1884, \u201cThe Mikado\u201d is a comical opera, set in the fictional Japanese town of Titipu and meant to satirically mask criticism of British political culture and bureaucracy with grossly exaggerated \u201cAsian\u201d names and stereotypical cultural caricatures. \\n{snip} Hoping to avoid these issues in their own production, the board of the Gilbert and Sullivan Players made some changes to the setting and script of the opera, characterizing their rendition as a \u201creimagining\u201d of the original production. \\n\u201cThe board of the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert & Sullivan Players, whose mission is to produce the full canon of Gilbert and Sullivan\u2019s shows, faced a dilemma this past January,\u201d Kathleen C. Zhou \u201917, the president of the Players, wrote in an op-ed for The Crimson Tuesday. \u201cStrike \u2018The Mikado\u2019 from our season, and ignore one of the most problematic but well-known G&S; shows, or try to confront it by reimagining it and subverting authorial intent.\u201d \\nThe setting of their show is no longer the 19th century town of Titipu, and instead is now 20th century \u201cLas Vegas themed Oriental hotel.\u201d And, the opening number \u201cGentlemen of Japan\u201d has been rewritten as \u201cGentlemen of the Strip.\u201d \\n{snip} \\nZhou said in an interview that in rethinking the comical opera\u2019s script, the complete omission of all of the original production\u2019s issues was \u201can erasure in itself in that it does not acknowledge how problematic the show has been to [Asians].\u201d \\n{snip}'"}, "time": 1742564373.4239628}
