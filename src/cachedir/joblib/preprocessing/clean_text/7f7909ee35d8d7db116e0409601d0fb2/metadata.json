[\u201cThere can\u2019t be a good economy without good businessmen, without their capacity to create and to produce,\u201d he said, shattering his reputation as an enemy of the free market economy.  The Pope met with \u201crepresentatives of the world of work,\u201d including businessmen, workers and unemployed persons at the Ilva steel plant in Genoa Saturday, fielding their questions and reflecting with them on a Christian view of the economy. The Pope recognized that the essential value of work and employment is only possible when companies are sound and successful. Moreover, only an economically healthy society can keep a democracy afloat, he suggested. \u201cThe world of work is a human priority,\u201d Francis said, \u201cand it\u2019s also a priority for the pope. There\u2019s always been a friendship between the church and work, starting with Jesus, who was a worker. \u201d \u201cWhen work is weakened, it\u2019s democracy that enters into crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a social compact. \u201d Without denouncing unemployment benefits, Francis insisted that state intervention wasn\u2019t a real solution. \u201cA monthly check from the state that allows you to keep the family afloat doesn\u2019t solve the problem. It has to be resolved with work for everyone,\u201d he said. The Pope went on to underscore differences between healthy entrepreneurship and financial \u201cspeculation,\u201d the latter of which he called both dangerous and unethical. \u201cA sickness of the economy is the progressive transformation of business people into speculators,\u201d Francis said. \u201cA speculator is a figure similar to what Jesus in the gospels called \u2018 \u2019 as opposed to good shepherds. \u201d Like a hired hand, Francis mused, a speculator \u201cdoesn\u2019t love his company or his workers, since they are merely a means for making profits. He has no problem firing people, closing a factory or relocating the company,\u201d because he doesn\u2019t care about his workers but uses them simply as a means for increasing his profits. Francis also said that when competition goes too far and affects the internal life of a company, it becomes  . \u201cThe accent on competition, beyond being an anthropological and Christian error, is an economic error because it forgets that a company is above all about cooperation,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s a system of individual incentives that puts workers into competition among themselves, you can obtain some advantages, but it ends up ruining the trust that\u2019s the soul of any organization,\u201d the Pope argued. \u201cWhen a crisis comes, the company falls apart. It implodes, because there\u2019s no longer any harmony. \u201d This isn\u2019t the first time that Pope Francis has shocked pundits by pointing out the important values of a free market economy. In his historic address to the joint session of the U. S. Congress in September, 2015, the Pope took advantage of the occasion to instruct politicians on the importance of wealth creation for lifting the poor out of poverty. The Pope chose to hold up   members of the middle class as an example to all and praising the U. S. free market system. Dashing the predictions of the pundits who prophesied that the Pope would \u201cprobably discuss American capitalism\u2019s flaws\u201d in his words to Congress, he actually did the opposite. Comparing the men and women of Congress to the biblical figure of Moses, he reminded them of the importance of the simple, industrious people who make America great. The Pope said that it is \u201cthe many thousands of men and women who strive each day to do an honest day\u2019s work, to bring home their daily bread, to save money and  \u2014   one step at a time  \u2014   to build a better life for their families\u201d who \u201csustain the life of society. \u201d These men and women \u201cgenerate solidarity by their actions, and they create organizations which offer a helping hand to those most in need,\u201d he said. The Pope\u2019s most remarkable words came when speaking about the ability of the free market to lift people out of poverty. In the fight against poverty, Francis said, it \u201cgoes without saying that part of this great effort is the creation and distribution of wealth. The right use of natural resources, the proper application of technology and the harnessing of the spirit of enterprise are essential elements of an economy which seeks to be modern, inclusive and sustainable. \u201d \u201cBusiness is a noble vocation,\u201d the Pope continued, \u201cdirected to producing wealth and improving the world. It can be a fruitful source of prosperity for the area in which it operates, especially if it sees the creation of jobs as an essential part of its service to the common good. \u201d Time and time again Pope Francis has shown that he is more complex and unpredictable than both his critics and his boosters suppose. While focusing his attention on helping the poor, he has also suggested that the free market system may be the best instrument to do just that. Follow Thomas D.
