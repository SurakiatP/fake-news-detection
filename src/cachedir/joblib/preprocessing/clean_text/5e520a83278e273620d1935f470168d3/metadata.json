[Asked how he\u2019s raising his daughter, Luna, in the era of Trump, Legend said: \u201cHopefully \u2018Trump\u2019s America\u2019 won\u2019t last very long and we get him out of here within the next four years. \u201d  \u201cBy the time Luna is old enough to be aware of what is happening, America would have elected a far better president,\u201d the     said. Legend was a fierce supporter of Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy he performed last summer at an   concert fundraiser for the former Democratic nominee. The \u201cDarkness and Light\u201d singer has also repeatedly attacked Trump on Twitter, calling him a \u201cracist\u201d and an \u201cawful person. \u201d He\u2019s married to supermodel Chrissy Teigen, who previously called Trump a \u201cmonumental asshole. \u201d Legend also told the Hollywood Reporter last November that Trump\u2019s \u201c \u201d rhetoric could turn the United States into Nazi Germany. Now, nearly two months after Trump was sworn into office, Legend says he\u2019s \u201cjust hoping for the best\u201d to come out of the new administration. \u201cTrump promised to do things which are really bad for the country and some which are good and the hope is he\u2019ll just do the good parts but I don\u2019t have a lot of faith in him,\u201d he said. \u201d I\u2019m just hoping for the best and when we need to resist and speak out, we need to hit the streets and do it. \u201d Legend continued: \u201cFor now, I\u2019m more worried about the people less fortunate than my daughter, people who might lose their healthcare or get excluded because of the colour of their skin, their religion and country of origin. \u201d Read the full QA with Legend here.
