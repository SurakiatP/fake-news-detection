She was 71 and still hosting her daily   radio program. Her death was confirmed by her brother David Oppenheim, who did not give a cause. Beginning in 1978  \u2014   when she was suddenly thrust onto the air because a hockey game had been canceled  \u2014   Dr. Browne reached millions of radio listeners, many of whom revealed their concerns to her in cathartic   segments or emailed her their problems, which she read and responded to over the air. \u201cShe was the   psychologist on   radio at the time of her death,\u201d Michael Harrison, the publisher of Talkers magazine, said in an email on Wednesday. \u201cMore importantly,\u201d he added, \u201cshe kept the presence of the radio   show alive on terrestrial   radio at a time when the genre had all but dried up in favor of mostly conservative, political programming. \u201d On television, versions of her program appeared on CBS, with a studio audience, and on the Discovery Health cable channel. In contrast to other   psychologists, some of whom could come across as scolds, Dr. Browne was unflaggingly buoyant as she delivered   advice and gentle goading. \u201cI\u2019m in the business of helping make lives better,\u201d she once said, \u201cnot by bashing but by teaching people how to take responsibility for their behavior. \u201d On a recent program she asked: \u201cIf we can figure out a way to get to the moon, wipe out disease, double life expectancy, don\u2019t you think we can be a little nicer to each other? Maybe. I know, I believe in the Easter bunny and the Tooth Fairy as well. \u201d With her advice came rules to live by, like these for couples: \u00b6If you\u2019re married, go on dates together (to keep the romance alive). \u00b6If you\u2019ve gone through a divorce or a breakup, no dating for a year (to let you experience life on your own). \u00b6If you\u2019re both in love and either of you has children, get married (an unmarried state can be disruptive for younger children, who tend to become attached, and for teenagers, who are dealing with their own sexuality). The psychologist Dr. Joyce Brothers, who became a fixture in American homes, made her television debut in the 1950s, but the roots of radio therapy are usually traced to Toni Grant, who started broadcasting on   in Los Angeles in 1975. (Dr. Grant died this year.) Dr. Browne was among those who followed in her footsteps, in her case on   (now WMEX) in Boston. \u201cWhen I first started, the A. P. A. tried to take my license away,\u201d Dr. Browne told The New York Times in 1996, referring to the American Psychological Association. In 1998, the group gave her an award under the rubric \u201coutstanding contribution by a psychologist in the media. \u201d Dr. Browne found her niche in the 1970s, at a time when seeking professional help was still stigmatized and family and community support networks had weakened. Radio gave people wrestling with emotional issues the safety of anonymity. She said she was as much concerned with moral and ethical issues as she was with mental health. \u201cIt\u2019s Problem Solving 101,\u201d she said in 1996 (while acknowledging that some listeners might consider it \u201cVoyeurism 102\u201d). Indeed, Dr. Frank Farley, a former president of the psychological association and a professor at Temple University, said in a phone interview on Wednesday that   programs like Dr. Browne\u2019s were more successful at offering practical advice on ethical issues than at providing actual therapy in public. \u201cYou can\u2019t give therapy to people you haven\u2019t seen,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cJoy Browne was certainly among the best of the media psychologists. She was very solid,   in psychology, and wasn\u2019t going to be shooting from the lip. \u201d She was born Joy Oppenheim on Oct. 24, 1944, in New Orleans, the daughter of Nelson Oppenheim, a life insurance salesman, and the former Ruth Strauss, a teacher. She was raised in Pennsylvania and Denver and graduated from Rice University in Houston with a degree in behavioral science. After earning a master\u2019s degree and a doctorate from Northeastern University in Boston, she began practicing psychology and attending Tufts University School of Medicine. That was when she was recruited by WITS. \u201cI found something in my life I was good at and could help more people in one hour than I could in one year,\u201d Dr. Browne told Talkers magazine last year. (She took her husband\u2019s name when she married Carter Browne.) WITS had scheduled her to begin broadcasting in October 1978, but weeks earlier she was summoned one night without warning to fill in when a scheduled broadcast of a Bruins hockey game was abruptly canceled the ice had melted at Boston Garden. Her mission, she said, was to persuade depressed listeners that they could change only their   not those of the people who might be causing them stress. \u201cThey want to know how to kill the person who is making them feel that way and not be held responsible,\u201d she told Talkers. \u201cThe only behavior I can help change is yours, but that isn\u2019t what a caller wants to hear. They want me to tell them that the other person is to blame. \u201d She also learned, she said, that \u201cone secret to doing a great interview is listening,\u201d a skill she had already developed as a therapist. Certain topics were taboo, she said, including abortion, \u201cbecause you will never change anyone\u2019s mind,\u201d and horoscopes, \u201cbecause it will get phone calls  \u2014   but no listeners. \u201d Partisan politics was also off limits. After another radio stint in California, Dr. Browne joined the WOR Radio Network in New York, which in the early 1990s sent her program into national syndication. She remained at WOR until it was sold in 2012. She then shifted to Radio America and finally to Genesis Communications Network, where her midday program was still being broadcast on more than 100 stations at her death. Dr. Browne was also an author. Among her titles are \u201cThe Nine Fantasies That Will Ruin Your Life\u201d (1998) \u201cIt\u2019s a Jungle Out There, Jane\u201d (1999) \u201cGetting Unstuck\u201d (2002) \u201cDating Disasters\u201d (2005) and \u201cDating for Dummies\u201d (2006) which includes this   tip: \u201cIf you have fingernail marks on the palms of your hands, you\u2019re a little too tense. \u201d Her marriage to Mr. Browne ended in divorce. In addition to her brother David, she is survived by a daughter, Patience three sisters, Jane Russo, Judy Hawkins and Alannah Sinclaire and another brother, Daniel Oppenheim. Embracing the    philosophy, Dr. Browne imposed one rule on herself: No chocolate during Lent. \u201cThat keeps me humble,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m always telling people to do things to change. This is my yearly reminder to myself that change is really hard. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564218.7697947}
