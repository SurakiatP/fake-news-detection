[\u201cUber used the software tool to hide cars from regulators who were attempting to conduct sting operations on drivers in areas the company was not yet licensed to operate, such as Portland, Oregon,\u201d reported The Verge. \u201cThe company claims it was developed as a way to cut down on fraud and protect drivers from violent taxi union protestors, and it claimed at the time that it still uses Greyball primarily for this purpose. \u201d  \u201cThe program worked by identifying suspicious users either based on credit card information, location, or the type of device being used to access the Uber app,\u201d they explained. \u201cThe company went so far as to check credit card data against popular credit unions used by law enforcement and mining public social media data to determine the suspected person\u2019s employment. Once a user was \u2018Greyballed,\u2019 so to speak, Uber would show a different version of the its app with fake cars that would not respond to call requests. \u201d The software was first revealed by The New York Times in March, prompting the investigation. In April, The New York Times also reported that Uber was nearly kicked off of the Apple App Store after they were caught breaking privacy rules. \u201cFor months, [Uber CEO Travis] Kalanick had pulled a fast one on Apple by directing his employees to help camouflage the   app from Apple\u2019s engineers,\u201d reported The Times. \u201cThe reason? So Apple would not find out that Uber had been secretly identifying and tagging iPhones even after its app had been deleted and the devices erased  \u2014   a fraud detection maneuver that violated Apple\u2019s privacy guidelines. \u201d The article painted Kalanick as a serial   who would frequently push the lines in an effort to advance his company. \u201cIn a quest to build Uber into the world\u2019s dominant   entity, Mr. Kalanick has openly disregarded many rules and norms, backing down only when caught or cornered,\u201d The New York Times claimed. \u201cHe has flouted transportation and safety regulations, bucked against entrenched competitors and capitalized on legal loopholes and gray areas to gain a business advantage. In the process, Mr. Kalanick has helped create a new transportation industry, with Uber spreading to more than 70 countries and gaining a valuation of nearly $70 billion, and its business continues to grow. \u201d Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
