After two months of stellar job creation that convinced administration officials that President Trump\u2019s policies were paying off immediately, employers pulled back sharply on hiring in March. The economy added 98, 000 jobs, the Labor Department reported Friday, fewer than half the monthly number for January and February. The report contained some notable good news: The unemployment rate fell to 4. 5 percent, the lowest level in almost a decade and a milestone in the long road back from the Great Recession. The rate was 4. 7 percent in February. Wages also continued to rise. But the disappointing number of new jobs was jarring for the administration, and well below what economists had expected. It comes as the stock market surge, which followed the November election, subsides and amid signs that economic growth in the year\u2019s first quarter proves weak. Economic perceptions, as well, may not be playing out in reality. Sentiment among consumers and businesses rose after Mr. Trump\u2019s election, but so far, it has not been matched by a comparable increase in spending by either group. \u201cWe\u2019ve given up on waiting for hard data to improve,\u201d said Rob Martin, an economist at Barclays. \u201cIt\u2019s been five months since confidence increased. If consumption were going to improve, it would have already. \u201d Industries that Mr. Trump emphasized in his campaign  \u2014   particularly manufacturing  \u2014   continued to add jobs last month, but at a slower pace. Payrolls in the retail sector, meanwhile, declined further, shedding tens of thousands of jobs. The response from the White House, which crowed last month after more than 200, 000 jobs were produced in Mr. Trump\u2019s first full month in office, was muted Friday. Gary D. Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs executive who is director of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council, emphasized the decline in the unemployment rate. \u201cWhen you look at the jobs report as a whole, I think there\u2019s an awful lot of good news in here,\u201d he told Fox Business Network. Congressional Democrats took a dimmer view. Also watching closely are the policy makers of the Federal Reserve, which has begun to reel in its   stimulus. It raised interest rates last month and said it planned to do so twice more this year. But signs of a sluggish economy could affect how quickly the central bank moves. \u201cThis raises the stakes for the April report,\u201d said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR, a research firm. \u201cYou need to see things pick up in April, or else March won\u2019t look like aberration. \u201d The market reaction, in any case, was sanguine, with stocks essentially flat for the day. Barclays has said it expects the economy to actually slow in the first half of 2017, before rebounding modestly in the second half. \u201cGiven this data today, we see downside risk in our already soft expectations for the first half,\u201d Mr. Martin said. The consensus view on Wall Street is that the economy expanded at an annual rate of 1 percent last quarter, with the pace of growth in the current second quarter rising to 3. 5 percent. The March report represents a snapshot of the economy, not an oil painting. And snow and cold weather in many parts of the country clearly took a toll on the construction sector, which barely grew after gaining a total of more than 90, 000 jobs in January and February. \u201cJanuary and February were abnormally warm, so they were pumped up, and you had some payback in March exacerbated by the harsh weather,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. On Capitol Hill, Republicans acknowledged a    view of the report. \u201cThe economy clearly should be generating higher job growth,\u201d said Representative Pat Tiberi, an Ohio Republican who is chairman of the Joint Economic Committee. \u201cHowever, the unemployment rate fell to the lowest rate since before the recession. \u201d The top Democrat on the committee, Senator Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, ignored the new jobless rate and focused instead on the disappointing payroll gain. \u201cToday\u2019s jobs numbers show there are still challenges ahead that this administration must address,\u201d Mr. Heinrich said. \u201cPresident Trump promised that he would be \u2018the greatest jobs producer that God ever created.\u2019 Democrats on the Joint Economic Committee will hold him to this promise. \u201d Last month, when February\u2019s payroll gain turned out to be much better than expected, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, claimed credit for Mr. Trump. Mr. Spicer called the job creation a result of \u201cthe surge in economic confidence and optimism that has been inspired since his election. \u201d Part of the problem for the administration is that its legislative accomplishments in the first hundred days are falling far short of the expectations  \u2014   notably, for tax cuts and infrastructure spending  \u2014   since the election. Whether or not they support Mr. Trump, mainstream economists say it will take many months for policy shifts in Washington to move a   economy with 153 million workers. What is more, the tepid numbers for March mask pockets of strength. For example, a few   sectors like professional and business services are holding up well, adding 56, 000 jobs last month. Hyland, a business software designer in Westlake, Ohio, plans to hire at least 300 people this year, Bill Priemer, its chief executive, said. That is a 15 percent increase in head count at the company, and it is a sign of just how quickly demand is growing for new technologies like content management, one of Hyland\u2019s specialties. \u201cWe are growing faster than the economy and the enterprise software sector overall,\u201d Mr. Priemer said. \u201cDigital transformation is a big buzzword, but it\u2019s just fancy terminology to describe how business can use technology to streamline their operations. \u201d On the other hand, new technologies are upending venerable industries like retailing, as consumers shift to shopping online and department stores close. The retail sector lost almost 30, 000 jobs last month, after a decline of about 31, 000 in February. The headline numbers for hiring and the unemployment rate are derived from separate surveys by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, one of establishments, the other of households. Although the two tends to converge over time, they can vary widely from month to month, and March was one of those times. So while businesses showed an anemic gain of 98, 000 jobs in terms of payrolls, households reported a 472, 000 increase in employment, without any fall in labor participation. That explains why the unemployment rate could fall by 0. 2 of a percentage point, even as the number for job creation was far short of expectations. \u201cI think the headline number was clearly impacted by the weather,\u201d said Michelle Meyer, head of United States economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. But at some point she said, rosy economic expectations are likely to catch up with a more sober reality. \u201cSentiment surveys moved sharply higher after the election on expectations of   policies and tax reform,\u201d she added. \u201cSo far, that hasn\u2019t happened, and the big question is whether confidence can remain as strong. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564110.2618444}
