Weiner\u2019s estranged wife, Huma Abedin, is a Clinton confidante.\u201d \\nAccording to two law enforcement sources, there is a group of investigators within the FBI\u2019s New York Field Office \u2013 the office that discovered the recent Anthony Weiner emails \u2013 that are hostile toward Clinton \u2013 and it is believed that this faction is behind the recent media leaks about the ongoing Clinton Foundation investigation. \\nOne thing is for sure \u2013 if Clinton wins the election on Tuesday, the Democratic Party will undoubtedly be launching an investigation into the FBI, and it would be more than ironic if the most memorable scandal of the 2016 election ends up being about the FBI, instead of Clinton\u2019s emails. \\nApparently, Trump supporter Rudy Giuliani \u2013 the former mayor of New York City \u2013 might have some involvement in it as well: \\nIt is a clear violation of the law by these FBI agents in an attempt to influence a presidential election. If any Democrats were thinking about staying home on election day, this should really inspire them to do the opposite. \\nClinton needs every vote now, as people are going to ridiculous lengths to make this election work for Trump, who is currently losing in the polls. Clinton is facing more opposition and obstacles than any presidential candidate has ever dealt with, and even those in power are abusing their authority to get her insane opponent into the White House.
