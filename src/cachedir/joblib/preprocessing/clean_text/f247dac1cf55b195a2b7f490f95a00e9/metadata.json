Still, that\u2019s the talking point the campaign continues to go with.\\nAnd indeed Clinton aide Jennifer Palmieri today warned against believing any new things released by WikiLeaks that are embarrassing to the Clinton campaign, even though the other releases were spot on, insisting that anything else they release is \u201c probably fake .\u201d\\nFriends, please remember that if you see a whopper of a Wikileaks in next two days \u2013 it's probably a fake.\\n\u2014 Jennifer Palmieri (@jmpalmieri) November 6, 2016\\nThis isn\u2019t a brand new claim, either, with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D \u2013 CA) making claims as far back as August that any future mass leaks would probably include \u201c Russian lies \u201d designed to embarrass Clinton and the Democrats.\\nThese preemptive warnings appear to recognize the reality that more embarrassing information is likely to come out, and aiming to get out in front of the next batch by preemptively declaring them \u201cprobably\u201d not true, whatever it turns out to be.\""}, "time": 1742563596.5876992}
