[How Trump Won tells the thrilling story of Donald Trump\u2019s improbable victory in the 2016 presidential election from two different perspectives.  Pollak relates the drama of the closing weeks of the campaign firsthand, as a reporter in the traveling press corps following Trump on his grueling   sprint to the finish. Schweikart narrates the broader history of the campaign, using unique data that a secret research group  \u2014   the \u201cRenegade Deplorables\u201d  \u2014   were feeding into the Trump campaign.  The book interlaces the two perspectives throughout, switching from the historian to the journalist and back again. There is also a tension between the outlook of the two authors: Schweikart expected Trump to win, while Pollak  \u2014   until the last few days  \u2014   did not, although both had predicted in 2015 that Trump would win the Republican Party\u2019s presidential primary. How Trump Won will be published on Jan. 17  \u2014   three days before Trump\u2019s inauguration  \u2014   as an   and will be released in print on Feb. 27.

Pollak\u2019s See No Evil: 19 Hard Truths the Left Can\u2019t Handle was released last year, while Schweikart\u2019s Politically Incorrect Guide to the Presidents, Part 1 will be released next week. Pollak also serves as editor of Breitbart California and   counsel at Breitbart News. Schweiker\u2019s A Patriot\u2019s History of the United States: From Columbus\u2019s Great Discovery to the War on Terror,   with Michael Allen, was a #1 New York Times bestseller, and captured the interest of the nascent Tea Party movement, which would soon come to fruition at the end of George W. Bush\u2019s presidency and the beginning of Barack Obama\u2019s. How Trump Won similarly captures the mood of the populist insurgency that propelled Trump to power in one of the most unlikely, and most exciting, elections in the history of the United States.
