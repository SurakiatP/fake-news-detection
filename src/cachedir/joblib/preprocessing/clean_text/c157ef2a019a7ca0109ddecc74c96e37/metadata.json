While only an estimated ten percent of the city\u2019s populace live in terrorist-held Eastern Aleppo, Moscow is doing everything possible to secure the evacuation of civilians. \\nThose civilians who want to leave jihadist-held areas may use six humanitarian corridors. Fighters can also leave the city with their weapons by using two other corridors established by the Russians and the Syrians. However, terrorists have refused to leave and instead resorted to shelling the civilian escape routes. \\nRussian and Syrian planes have stayed out of the city for eight consecutive days. In that time, only a few dozen civilians managed to escape the terrorist-held areas. Meanwhile, the Russian reconciliation centers continued to pour aid into Aleppo.

However, objections by two non-State armed opposition groups, namely Ahrar as-Sham and Nureddin Zenki, scuppered these plans. The United Nations made every effort to get assurances from all parties, only for the parties to then fail to agree on each other\u2019s conditions about how evacuations should proceed,\u201d said Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Stepen O\u2019Brien. \\nIn the meantime, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Red Crescent teams working in Aleppo have complained that delivering the humanitarian aid and treating the wounded has been a challenge, as the ICRC failed to \u201csecure the security guarantees of some armed groups.\u201d \u0645\u062d\u0627\u0648\u0644\u0627\u062a \u0625\u062c\u0644\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0631\u062d\u0649 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0636\u0649 \u0645\u0646 #\u062d\u0644\u0628 \u0644\u0645 \u062a\u0646\u062c\u062d. \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0645\u0627 \u062a\u062d\u062a\u0627\u062c \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0647 \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631: pic.twitter.com/hsdfmqLVRK \u2014 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u062c\u0646\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0644\u064a\u0629 (@ICRC_ar) October 26, 2016 \\nBack at the UNSC, O'Brien painted a clear picture for the members of the UN Security Council of human suffering in Eastern Aleppo where terrorists use civilians as human shields. \\nIn a graphic yet poetic account, O\u2019Brien said that civilians \u2013 mostly children and elderly \u2013 are stuck in basements where \u201cthe stench of urine and the vomit caused by unrelieved fear never leaving your nostrils\u201d is omnipresent.

Since my last report to this Council less than a month ago, 400 more people have been killed and nearly 2,000 injured in eastern Aleppo. So many of them \u2013 too many of them \u2013 were children,\u201d O'Brien said. \\n\u201cNever has the phrase by poet Robert Burns, of \u2018Man\u2019s inhumanity to man\u2019 been as apt. It can be stopped but you the Security Council have to choose to make it stop,\u201d the envoy added. \\nTaking the mic at the UNSC meeting, Churkin criticized O'Brien\u2019s report, which he said lacked factual information and failed to stress the cessation of Syrian and Russian air raids on the city. He asked O\u2019Brian not to recite poetry but base his reports on concrete facts. \\n\u201cIf we wanted to hear a sermon, we would go to church. If we wanted to hear poetry, we would go to a theater,\u201d Churkin said. \\nREAD MORE: 60 civilians killed, 200 injured as US-led coalition strikes Mosul residential areas \u2013 Russian MoD \\nSecurity Council members wanted to hear \u201cobjective analysis\u201d of the situation on the ground from O\u2019Brien, the Russian ambassador stressed. \\n\u201cYou clearly did not achieve this,\u201d Churkin said, reminding O'Brien that no strikes have been conducted over Aleppo since October 18. Calling O'Brian's statement \u201cprovocative and unacceptable,\u201d Churkin pointed that in the past eight days Syrian and Russian planes had not flown over Aleppo, staying at least 10 km away from the city. \\n\u201cThis moratorium on the flight lasted eight days [now]. Mr. O 'Brian, you did not mention a single word about it. You have built your speech so to paint a picture that aerial bombardment did not stop for one day and that it is happening now, as we speak,\u201d said Churkin.\""}, "time": 1742561825.659615}
