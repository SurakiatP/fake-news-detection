He was 63. His death was announced on social media by Mr. Lee. His wife, Donna, told The Associated Press that Mr. Nunn had cancer. The first major acting role for Mr. Nunn, the son of a   professional football scout, was in the 1988 film \u201cSchool Daze,\u201d also written and directed by Mr. Lee. The next year brought the critically acclaimed \u201cDo the Right Thing,\u201d in which he played Radio Raheem, who carries a boombox blaring Public Enemy\u2019s \u201cFight the Power\u201d through the streets of the   area of Brooklyn on the hottest day of summer. Radio Raheem sits at the moral heart of the film, delivering a soliloquy directly to the camera on the ceaseless contest between love and hate, symbolized by the   rings he wears on each hand. The character\u2019s choking death at the hands of police officers in front of a crowd of his neighbors incites the film\u2019s wrenching final scenes. Mr. Nunn became a popular character actor after \u201cDo the Right Thing\u201d and appeared in a variety of films, including \u201cNew Jack City,\u201d \u201cSister Act\u201d and the \u201c \u201d trilogy by the director Sam Raimi. In 2004 he appeared in a Broadway revival of \u201cRaisin in the Sun\u201d as Bobo, alongside Audra McDonald, Phylicia Rashad and Sean Combs. But it was his performance as Radio Raheem that allowed him to make his greatest mark, Mr. Nunn said in an interview with ABC News to mark the 25th anniversary of the film\u2019s release. He was a frequent collaborator of Mr. Lee and also appeared in his films \u201cMo\u2019 Better Blues\u201d and \u201cHe Got Game. \u201d Mr. Lee referred to him on Saturday as \u201dmy dear friend, my dear Morehouse brother. \u201d They both attended Morehouse College in Atlanta. William Goldwyn Nunn III was born on Oct. 20, 1952, in Pittsburgh. His father was Bill Nunn, a scout for the Pittsburgh Steelers who helped build a football powerhouse in the 1970s by recruiting from the   football programs at historically black colleges and universities. He died in 2014. Mr. Lee memorialized Mr. Nunn in a series of social media posts on Saturday, sharing the text of his \u201cDo the Right Thing\u201d soliloquy as well as pictures of him as Radio Raheem. On social media, Mr. Lee cited the death of Eric Garner, who died after an officer placed him in a chokehold on Staten Island in 2014, as evidence of the continuing resonance of Radio Raheem\u2019s violent death. In an interview with ABC News in 2014, Mr. Nunn reflected on the death of Mr. Garner, which was captured on video and helped propel a nationwide debate on the treatment of black men by the police. Much like the character that brought him to fame, Mr. Nunn focused on the need for love. \u201cYou know you\u2019re watching a guy lose his life,\u201d Mr. Nunn said in the interview. \u201cFor me, I\u2019m just getting a little tired of watching these mothers on television, these poor mothers grieving their sons and children. It makes me wonder sometimes about where the compassion is. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562057.1037025}
