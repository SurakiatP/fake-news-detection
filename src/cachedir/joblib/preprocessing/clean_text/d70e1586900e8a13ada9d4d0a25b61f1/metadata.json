ISIS militants said that Siam was killed due to the fact he was \u201ca partner in a declared war against religion and against Muslims, working for the heretical government in Gaza\u201d. Americans.org report: The attack was conducted by ISIS-affiliated Salafist rebels who have also warned local residents to stay away from Hamas offices and buildings as it plans to carry out more attacks. The conflict between Hamas and ISIS in Gaza started when Palestinian forces demolished a makeshift mosque used by Ansar al-Bayt al-Maqdis in early May. Ansar al-Bayt al-Maqdis is an Egyptian Islamist group that has pledged allegiance to ISIS and has been recruiting Palestinians for the Islamic State. After demolishing the Almtahabin mosque, Hamas then arrested seven men, including a local Salafist Sheikh Yasser Abu Houli. ISIS claims it will kill Palestinians \u201cone by one\u201d and that it knows the names and addresses of all the officers working for the Palestinian Intelligence agency.'"}, "time": 1742562199.8524492}
