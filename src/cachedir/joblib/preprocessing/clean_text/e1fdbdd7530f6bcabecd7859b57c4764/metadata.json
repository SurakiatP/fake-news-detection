It is failure to diversify that leads to endangering any species. To diversify is survival. Corporations that rely on a fixed market die out - high button shoes, spats, buggy whips, oil lanterns etc. Maybe they need a warning, Caution! Peace is about to break out! Time to do something else!\\nFailure to diversify results in high irony. The Peruvian potato fed millions but caused economic ruin and starvation for the Irish. In Peru, they have 5000 varieties and nobody starves when one goes bad. Ireland had only one genetic species, and that's the point. Had the lazy Spanish stolen a few more varieties from the Incas, there'd have been far and away fewer Irish firemen to put out the Chicago fire. (One's opinion of Chicago notwithstanding.)\\nWhile I agree with you, I think the point is the economic model is lazy, it's comfortable profiting with war tools and not paying attention to humanity's real needs or goals. Is war popular with anyone not in office or engaged in the business of making war toys? No. That laziness is the real trouble. They're engaging in pressure and lobbyist campaign contribution bribery for their own benefit, certainly not the innocent public everywhere.\\nThat's why we need to federally fund democracy, end corporate campaign contributions and for profit revolving door politics all together. Our system needs diversity, the kind all people can live with. And no, I'm not talking new world order, just the common sense of peace.\""}, "time": 1742628452.0289743}
