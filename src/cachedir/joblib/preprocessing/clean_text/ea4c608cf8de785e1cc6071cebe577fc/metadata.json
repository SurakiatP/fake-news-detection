Warren Campbell inside his army surplus store Redoubt Surplus and Tactical near Coeur d\u2019Alene, Idaho (Erin Collins/CBC) \\nA redoubt is a little-used military term that refers to a temporary fortification. The American Redoubt is both a movement and an unofficial geographic zone that includes Idaho, Wyoming, Montana and the eastern parts of Washington and Oregon. \\nThe term was coined in 2011 by survivalist James Wesley Rawles, who identified the region as the best place to wait out a disaster in the U.S., be it natural, economic or political. \\nRawles sees the Redoubt as a place where mostly conservative, Christian Americans who are worried about the future should move and prepare for the worst. The goal is to create a safe haven where like-minded Americans, many of whom refer to themselves as \u201cpreppers,\u201d can live off the land, be more self-sufficient and wait out the calamities to come. \u2018The holy cause of liberty\u2019 \\nPast the tactical gear and through a hallway at the back of Redoubt Surplus and Tactical , you\u2019ll find Pastor Warren Campbell\u2019s other venture, The Lordship Church . \\nAdorned in military garb and sporting an Abe Lincoln-style beard, Campbell sets out folding metal chairs to get ready for his weekend service, where about three dozen people usually come to hear him preach. \\n\u201cWe love to preach on liberty, the holy cause of liberty \u2014 George Washington called liberty a sacred fire and our liberties are very, very dear to us, especially the liberties we have in Jesus Christ.\u201d Pastor Warren Campbell inside his makeshift church connected to his army surplus store in northern Idaho. (Erin Collins/CBC) \\nCampbell says he\u2019s met dozens of people who have recently moved to the area, mostly from California and Colorado, because they\u2019re frustrated with what they feel is government overreach, including rising taxes, stiffer gun regulations and the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. \\nHe says he\u2019ll likely vote for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Nov. 8, primarily because he believes a Hillary Clinton administration would erode religious freedoms and the right to bear arms. \\nAnd despite the polls, Campbell believes Trump will win. If he doesn\u2019t, he expects the Redoubt will get a lot more crowded. \\n\u201cI think we will see a great influx of people, more than we are seeing right now, multiplying by thousands, coming here for safety and refuge.\u201d \\nWith all the mudslinging and scandal that has defined this U.S. presidential campaign, perhaps it shouldn\u2019t be surprising there\u2019s talk of political migration. \\nOnce again this election cycle, some Democrats, including several celebrities , have threatened to move to Canada should their candidate lose. \\nFolks in the Redoubt suspect plenty of Trump supporters will consider a move of their own if their candidate loses, although not quite as far north. \u2018People want to feel safe\u2019 \\nA short drive away, customers peruse the display cases at Ed Santos\u2019s busy Post Falls gun shop and shooting range. They\u2019re served by staff wearing side arms who show off everything from handguns to automatic weapons. \\n\u2018The American Redoubt is a stronghold, it\u2019s the last bastion for God, country, liberty, constitution, Second Amendment and home schooling.\u2019 \u2013 Warren Campbell, owner of Redoubt Surplus and Tactical \\nSantos says many of the people coming through his shop these days are new arrivals looking for a fresh start and a quieter, more peaceful life. \\n\u201cMany of the things that attracted my wife and I to this area are the same things that are attracting people today \u2014 people want to live in a place that feels like a community, people want to feel safe when they go out at night.\u201d \\nSantos, a former army officer, cop and minor pro hockey referee, says the facility is signing up new members every day, and \u201cmany of them, the vast majority of them in fact, are from out of this area.\u201d Ed Santos fires a pistol inside the gun range attached to his Port Falls Idaho gun shop. \\nMore than 300 kilometres east, that search for safety and community drew Chuck Leveque and his wife to a wooded property in the isolated foothills of Flathead County, Mont. \\nThe former Las Vegas vice cop says his biggest worry is that terrorists could knock out America\u2019s electrical grid. \\nLeveque opens the creaky doors of a large shipping container in his yard to show how he\u2019s prepared for the threat. \\n\u201cThis is our fuel storage container and we have a tank with 275 gallons of diesel and a tank with 275 gallons of non-ethanol regular gasoline.\u201d \\nThe fuel will run Leveque\u2019s generator in the event of a prolonged power outage. He says he\u2019s stored enough food and water for him and his wife to survive for up to four years. \\nBut Leveque believes he will also need to protect what he\u2019s stored from those who are less prepared, so, like many people here in the Redoubt, he has stockpiled weapons and ammunition, too. Chuck Leveque opens up the sea lift container that holds two tanks of fuel to run his generator in case the power grid goes down. (Erin Collins/CBC) \\n\u201cThe U.S., and Montana in particular, is a gun culture, and in the event of a large catastrophe, we would need the guns to defend ourselves against people who would want to take our property and our preparedness stores.\u201d \\nIn the meantime, he worries the country\u2019s political and economic power is waning, saddled with too much debt and a political system that has ground to a halt. \\nIt\u2019s a problem he expects will get worse after the presidential campaign. \\n\u201cNo matter which way the election turns out, there is going to be a lot of angst by either side.\u201d Canning bullion and bullets \\nInside a nondescript industrial mall near Kalispell, Mont., DJ Lebaron puts the finishing touches on a can of dehydrated eggs inside his store, Big Sky Preppers . \\nLebaron, who is originally from southern Alberta, provides survival products and training, including how to can everything from gold bullion to bullets. \\n\u201cYou want to pack them tight so that they don\u2019t sound like bullets if somebody shakes it,\u201d he said. \\nFor Lebaron, life in the Redoubt is about hoping for the best and preparing for the worst. It\u2019s a mantra he adopted while working with FEMA, America\u2019s disaster management agency, during the earthquake that rocked the San Francisco Bay Area in 1989. \\n\u201cWhen bad things happen, people that you have called your friends for years are no longer your friends,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen people are cold, tired and hungry, they forget all about friendships.\u201d \\nHis biggest worry is that a natural disaster like an earthquake or flood will disrupt normal life in America. But he says the growing uncertainty about America\u2019s political and economic future is a close second. \\nHe says Trump presents conservatives in the Redoubt with a difficult choice this election. \\n\u201cPeople, if they are voting, are going to be voting for Trump, but people don\u2019t want Trump because nobody can control him and they are worried about what he will do, so I guess I will call that a man-made disaster.\u201d \\nHe expects the divisions this presidential campaign has reinforced across the country will remain long after the election and will feed some Americans\u2019 desire to retreat to the Redoubt. \\n\u201cThere is very much a division or a schism in the United States today, where people are literally, \u2018Which side of the fence are you on?'\u201d\""}, "time": 1742628439.0690718}
