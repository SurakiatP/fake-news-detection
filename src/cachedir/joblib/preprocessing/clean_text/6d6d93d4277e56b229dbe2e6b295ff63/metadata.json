That can be hard to remember after his years of public,   eminence: touring arenas while he was in his 70s and playing leisurely    shows that seemed to slow down time itself. He intoned his songs with serene gravity, revealing once again how carefully chiseled every one of his quatrains is. And with every line he shared, implicitly and in his lyrics, there was a humbling knowledge of mortality: one that grows even more significant on Mr. Cohen\u2019s final studio album, \u201cYou Want It Darker,\u201d which was released less than a month ago. In \u201cWho By Fire,\u201d from 1974, one of his many songs that is both a list and an incantation, he itemized causes and sites of death, getting morbid while keeping a hint of puckishness: Mr. Cohen was aware, always, of every option. In his concerts, Mr. Cohen played the venerable sage, dapper in his suits and precisely angled hats. He was also sly and avuncular, making droll, deadpan comments in his sepulchral voice. He had aged to match the perspective he had brought to his lyrics since the late 1960s: a long view that stretched back to biblical and psychological archetypes and envisioned myth and history  \u2014   and the   economy of Zen koans  \u2014   far more often than the everyday. Perhaps because he was already in his 30s when he set aside novels and poetry for songwriting, he was a   from the start. Mr. Cohen was a monumentally painstaking songwriter who described, in interviews, a process of endless writing and rewriting for his lyrics. By his accounts, he tinkered with some of his songs for years on end. That meticulousness was obvious in the songs he did release, which he did in no great hurry: 14 studio albums in 49 years. Bob Dylan\u2019s   associations were sometimes a   influence, particularly on Mr. Cohen\u2019s   albums, but the Cohen trademark was the   paradox, the finely balanced lyrics that can be deliberately heard (and read) in contradictory ways: reverence or blasphemy, affection or animosity, reportage or mockery, tragedy or comedy. \u201cEverybody Knows,\u201d a dark masterpiece of bitter cynicism from 1988 that Mr. Cohen wrote with the singer Sharon Robinson, opens with politics that still ring unfortunately true: Then, because political battles are not always physically felt, the song\u2019s catalog of betrayals veers toward the personal: \u201cEverybody knows that you\u2019ve been   give or take a night or two. \u201d As serious as he was, Mr. Cohen was always frisky too. His first albums, especially, are suffused with appreciative eroticism and sensuality: describing a lover with \u201cyour hair upon the pillow like a sleepy golden storm\u201d in \u201cHey, That\u2019s No Way to Say Goodbye,\u201d or recalling, with explicit details, a tryst with Janis Joplin in \u201cChelsea Hotel #2,\u201d which has her declaring, \u201cWe are ugly but we have the music. \u201d The Cohen song that became an unlikely pop perennial, \u201cHallelujah,\u201d veers between biblical allusions and ecstatic sex. In its melody and chord progression, \u201cHallelujah,\u201d which has been subjected to renditions both humble and bombastic, points to something Mr. Cohen\u2019s countless literary admirers don\u2019t mention: He understood tunes, and he knew they were more than just backdrops to his words. It\u2019s one thing  \u2014   a complicated, prodigious thing  \u2014   to write such fastidious lyrics, and then to mock that fastidiousness by rhyming \u201cHallelujah\u201d with \u201cwhat\u2019s it to ya. \u201d It\u2019s another to carry them in a melody that, once created, seems to sing itself. \u201cHallelujah\u201d is a   succession of tensions and releases, which stay no less magical despite the way Mr. Cohen analyzes them in the first verse of his lyrics: \u201cthe fourth, the fifth, the minor fall, the major lift. \u201d Mr. Cohen had to cope with the limitations of his vocal cords. That\u2019s why his first exposure, with songs like the    conundrums of \u201cFamous Blue Raincoat,\u201d came via the prettier voices of singers like Judy Collins. In Mr. Cohen\u2019s early years he was a low tenor, decent enough technically and smart enough as a melody writer to keep his songs where he could sing them. On his debut album, \u201cSongs of Leonard Cohen,\u201d the producer John Simon gave Mr. Cohen exactly as much counterpoint as he needed, although Mr. Cohen complained, in a 1967 interview with The Village Voice, \u201cThey tried to make my songs into music. \u201d Later, as his voice plummeted down to a   bass register, he used the voices of women  \u2014   as angels, consorts, muses, ghosts  \u2014   to provide melodies around him. Mr. Cohen was clearly aware of how many of his album titles insisted that his work was music above all: \u201cSongs from a Room,\u201d \u201cSongs of Love and Hate,\u201d \u201cRecent Songs,\u201d \u201cTen New Songs. \u201d Sometimes, he tried to be palatable to pop radio. He delved widely across idioms, writing not just   folk and pop but tunes that hinted at rock, blues, country, klezmer, Viennese waltzes and Greek rebetika  \u2014   even disco on the   trenchant \u201cI\u2019m Your Man\u201d in 1988. And in one of the most improbable (and mismatched) collaborations in pop history, Mr. Cohen made his 1977 album \u201cDeath of a Ladies\u2019 Man\u201d with Phil Spector. Mr. Cohen could frustrate his listeners by treating some albums, like the 2004 record \u201cDear Heather,\u201d merely as skeletal demos. One of the benefits of his   touring was that he rescued some songs from misbegotten studio arrangements. On his final studio albums  \u2014   in 2012, 2014 and 2016  \u2014   he collaborated with an unexpected and adept fan: the producer Patrick Leonard, who wrote and produced \u201cLike a Prayer,\u201d among many other songs, with Madonna. Yet it\u2019s inevitable that Mr. Cohen will be remembered above all for his lyrics. They are terse and acrobatic, scriptural and bawdy, vividly descriptive and enduringly ambiguous, never far from either a riddle or a punch line. \u201cThere is a crack in  \u2019s how the light gets in,\u201d he advised in \u201cAnthem. \u201d His final ruminations on his last album, \u201cYou Want It Darker,\u201d were on mortality, love and a divinity that he faced and questioned to the very end. \u201cSteer your way through the pain that is far more real than  \u2019s smashed the cosmic model, that blinded every   please don\u2019t make me go there, though there be a God or not,\u201d he intoned in \u201cSteer Your Way. \u201d In his last songs, as always, he sought stark truth before comfort.'"}, "time": 1742563011.3031173}
