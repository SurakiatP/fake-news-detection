Iraqi forces fought ISIS on the eastern side of Mosul and \u201cartillery and air strikes pounded the city, still home to 1.5 million people.\u201d Civilians from eastern Mosul , and residents of the eastern neighborhood of al-Quds said the \u201cultra-hardline Sunni militants had resorted to street fighting to try to hold the army back,\u201d according to Reuters .\\n_ Iraqi special forces Gen. Shaghati held a press conference, saying: \u201c This is a good sign for the people of Mosul because the battle to liberate Mosul has effectively begun .\u201d His troops captured a state TV building in Mosul. But reportedly there were also complications . Some of Shaghati\u2019s men raised a Shi\u2019ite flag.

Christians waiting at the checkpoint for hours, scattered.\\n_ Mosul Eye reported that residents are in their homes, the Iraqi forces are advancing rapidly, and ISIS is disappearing from the Al-Karama section.

This makes 2 reports of Turkish forces massing on a border (see below reports of Turkish troops in Gazientep on the Syrian border).\\n_ Patrick Cockburn recalls , first hand, what happened in Mosul during the 2003 US invasion and the fall of Saddam Hussein. The Kurdish Peshmerga and others (but mainly the Kurds) took advantage of the power vacuum and looted the city while US soldiers manned checkpoints. They also took Kirkuk and other Arab territory, expanding the Kurdish territory by 40% after promising that they wouldn\u2019t.\\n\u201cAs we drove into the city, we passed lines of pick-up trucks piled high with loot returning to the Kurdish-controlled enclave in northern Iraq.\u201d\\n_ Cockburn gives a masterful summary of the different factions involved in the current anti-ISIS coalition advancing on Mosul and urges the Iraqi government to take and maintain control of Mosul so that it doesn\u2019t get ripped apart and looted like before.\\n\u201cThe different segments of the anti-Isis forces potentially involved in seizing Mosul \u2013 the Iraqi army, Kurds, Shia and Sunni paramilitaries, Turks \u2013 may be temporary allies, but they are also rivals. They all have their own very different and conflicting agendas.\u201d\\nRaqqa Campaign Will Coincide With Mosul Campaign and Will Happen \u201cSoon\u201d _ In a press briefing on Oct. 26 ( video , transcript ) Lt. Gen. Townsend, Operation Inherent Resolve commander, said that the campaign to take Raqqa in Syria will be done simultaneously with the Mosul campaign. They are working on the plans for the \u201cisolation and eventual liberation of Raqqah.\u201d It will be done in stages \u2014 first isolation and then \u201cseizure and liberation.\u201d\\n_ The Raqqah operation will be done with \u201ca lot lighter coalition footprint\u201d and with \u201cour local partners in northern Syria.\u201d Townsend said there are sufficient local forces but they plan to \u201crecruit and equip and train more local forces for that operation.\u201d The current Syrian Democratic Forces are 30,000 in number, mostly Kurdish. Townsend plans to recruit more local forces from the Raqqah area, similar to the way it was done in Manbij. The training will be done in northern Syria.\\n_ When asked if the Kurdish YPG element of the Syrian Democratic Forces will participate in the Raqqah campaign, given that Turkey has demanded no involvement of Kurds in Raqqah, Townsend said that is a \u201ctough one.\u201d Townsend said \u201cit\u2019s very important to get isolation in place around Raqqah to start controlling that environment on a pretty short timeline\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019re gonna take the force that we have.\u201d\\n_ As for Turkey, Townsend said: \u201cThe Turks have expressed an interest to be involved in that. And we\u2019ll \u2014 we\u2019ll work through that later [\u2026] And I think that we\u2019ll go with the forces that can go on the timeline that we need.\u201d He stressed that they want to move on Raqqah \u201csoon.\u201d\\n_ Lt. Gen. Townsend said they\u2019ll take \u201cany partner that\u2019s willing to join the coalition.\u201d Would that include ex-ISIS fighters? \u201cWe\u2019re gonna go with who can go, who\u2019s willing to go soon. And then we\u2019ll \u2014 once we get initial isolation in position, we\u2019ll \u2014 we\u2019ll look at how we prosecute the operation further.\u201d\\n_ When asked about the urgency of the Raqqah campaign, Townsend said that ISIS is \u201cup to something\u201d and there is \u201cand external plot\u201d \u201cemanating from Raqqah.\u201d\\n_ A Military Times journalist asked if more US troops would be deployed to Syria, and Townsend would not answer directly but inferred that there would.\\nThe Race for Raqqah _ Townsend, several times, avoided questions about Russia and Syria with respect to the Raqqah campaign, during the Oct. 26 briefing ( video , transcript ), until the end of the briefing when Paul Sonne asked directly about Syria and Russia\u2019s response to Turkey participating in the Raqqa campaign and moving even further into Syria. Townsend\u2019s answer was cryptic and hard to summarize, but important to read in full, as he signaled the official justification for US moving on Raqqah and acknowledged that the Syrian government would oppose it:\\nTownsend : \u201cI just know that right now Syria seems to have their hands full. And so it\u2019s necessary for our coalition to move about inside Syria to defeat Daesh-ISIL because it poses a threat to Syria, Iraq, the region, and our own nations.\u201d\\n\u201cSo like I said, we\u2019ll welcome any contributing nation that wants to make themselves part of the coalition to go fight Daesh in Syria. But that \u2014 join the coalition has to come with not \u2014 can\u2019t just come with a whole bunch of strings. They got to be willing to go do what the coalition needs done. We try to employ coalition contributions whether they be troops or capabilities, we try to always, we employ them within the bounds of the wishes of their government. \u201d\\n\u201cOnce we set out what that arrangement is, then the coalition employs those capabilities. So we\u2019ll use whoever wants to go do that, fight Daesh in Raqqa, that\u2019s a tough place, probably won\u2019t be a very long list. And I would imagine Syria probably isn\u2019t thrilled with any of us there doing that. But it\u2019s necessary to do.\u201d\\n_ So the official justification for taking Raqqah, is that the Syrian army has its hands full and somebody has to take down ISIS in their capital.\\n_ Townsend says, multiple times, that any country, any force can join their coalition to isolate and liberate Raqqah. And each time he says it during the briefing, he does not exclude the Syrian coalition forces. When asked about Syria and Russia\u2019s expected reaction to the Raqqah campaign, he brings it up again, that anyone can join the coalition, either with forces or \u201ccapabilities.\u201d But they must accept that the US will be leading this coalition, even though they have no legal authority to fight or bomb inside Syria and the Syrian government repeatedly reminds the world of that.\\n_ Townsend then acknowledges that the Syrian government probably won\u2019t be \u201cthrilled\u201d about the US coalition taking Raqqah or \u201cwith any of us\u201d meaning Turkey. But he largely blows it off. which is interesting, and completely avoids addressing Russia specifically, again, though several journalists were anxious for him to address it. Very dicey, vague and unlike other parts of his briefing, this part sounded disingenuous.\\n_ Turkey is urging that the battle for Raqqa wait until after the Mosul operation is over. Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus : \u201cIt would be better both militarily and strategically to conduct this operation after the Mosul operation and Turkey\u2019s Euphrates Shield operation are completed.\u201d\\nAleppo _ Southfront reports that the Jaish al-Fatah rebel group, led by al Nusra, \u201chas not been able to deliver a devastating blow to the Syrian government forces and to break the siege of eastern Aleppo.\u201d\\n_ The rebels had launched a recent offensive with \u201cover 2,000 so-called moderate opposition members carried out attacks on residential areas, schools and hospitals with the support of 22 tanks, 15 IFVs, multiple launch rocket systems and eight vehicles with suicide bombers.\u201d They killed 80 civilians and injured 300 from Oct. 29 to Oct. 31 alone, and launched shells with chlorine gas on the Al-Hamdaniya neighborhood in West Aleppo.\\n_ Russia has not used warplanes in Aleppo for 16 days now. Rebel groups in East Aleppo continue to attack West Aleppo. Russian defense minister Shoigu said that \u201cmilitants shoot dozens of civilians every day for trying to approach the humanitarian corridors.\u201d The Russian military asked for permission to do airstrikes on Oct. 28 but Russian president Putin refused , continuing to extend the halt on airstrikes as part of a \u201chumanitarian pause.\u201d The Kremlin spokesman said the \u201chumanitarian pause\u201d will be impossible to continue if the opposition groups \u201cresume offensive operations \u201d (which they have done). The Kremlin spokesman also indicated that \u201cmeasures are being taken to ensure the evacuation of civilians and injured from eastern Aleppo.\u201d\\n_ Ruptly published video today of the Syrian army firing \u201crocket salvos and heavy automatic weapons as they attempted to wrest control of the contested southwestern area.\u201d\\n_ As the Russians wait for the UN and US to convince the \u201cmoderate opposition\u201d to separate from designated terrorist groups, and the UN envoy Steffan de Mistura, in Geneva, \u201ccalled on the fighters to leave the city to help enable aid to reach\u201d East Aleppo\u2019s civilians, the top negotiator, Khaled Khoja, in the Saudi-backed opposition umbrella group, the High Negotiations Committee (HNC), also in Geneva, said it\u2019s impossible for the rebels in East Aleppo to separate from al Nusra (al Qaeda) , and blamed it on the international community. He also denied shelling civilians in West Aleppo, which has been confirmed by numerous officials and media, as have reports of East Aleppo rebels refusing to allow civilians to leave.\\n_ As Russia keeps extending their halt on airstrikes, continue to keep humanitarian corridors that opposition rebels refuse to allow civilians to use to escape, and rebels launch offensives and refuse to separate from al Qaeda, the foggy, propaganda-mired situation in Aleppo becomes more clear to everyone. The US continues to refuse to provide intelligence on the location of al Qaeda or to convince the rebels they are backing to separate from them.\\n_ Khoja is hoping that the election next week will bring Hillary Clinton as a savior for the opposition groups and al Qaeda in East Aleppo:\\nHNC negotiator Khoja : \u201cWe heard (Democratic presidential candidate Hillary) Clinton talking about civilian protection, no-fly-zones, which is something we welcome and that we demand.\u201d\\nFlow of ISIS fighters Between Iraq and Syria _ In the Oct. 26 briefing ( video , transcript ), Lt. Gen. Townsend said they don\u2019t have a complete encirclement of Mosul and it\u2019s not necessary, and there is movement out of Mosul but \u201cwhen we can identify ISIL fighters, we strike them.\u201d He said ISIS has gotten \u201csavvy since Fallujah\u201d and they mix fighters with families in their convoys so it\u2019s hard to strike them.\\nReshaping Syria? _ Turkish government officials are leaking some pretty explosive claims to Turkish pro-government media. Pro-Erdogan Turkish media, Yeni Safak, is reporting that Russia and Turkey made a deal to cede an extensive amount of territory in northern Syria to the control of \u201clocal elements and local assemblies after being liberated from the terror groups.\u201d Syrian president Assad\u2019s government\u201d will consolidate its power in Latakia and Tartus.\u201d The Turkish military is reportedly massing on the border in Gaziantep and will advance south to Aleppo, while Assad\u2019s forces will vacate the city. Al Nusra and Ahrar al-Sham will be required to leave.\\n_ Yeni Safak reports that \u201ca new map will be drawn including the Aleppo, Idlib, Latakia, Raqqa, Al-Hasakah and Dery ez-Zor provinces of the country.\u201d Syrian Kurds, allied with the US-led coaliiton, plan to create an \u201cautonomous region\u201d to include \u201cal-Hasakah, Tal Abyad, Ayn al Arab, Jarabulus, Al Rai, Azez, Marea and Afrin.\u201d Turkey and Russia will not accept that plan and the Turkish government sources claimed that Russia and Turkey would fight together under Operation Euphrates Shield.\\n\u2013 On Tuesday,. Yeni Safak reported that the Turkish military chief of staff, Gen. Hulusi Akar, traveled to Moscow to meet with his counterpart, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, a deputy defense minister and head of the Russian military, to discuss\u201cmilitary cooperation and regional issues\u201d.\\nOpen-Ended Conflict With Russia _ Spencer Ackerman at the Guardian spoke to people in the US \u201cnational security circles,\u201d including \u201cretired senior US military pilots\u201d and the director of national intelligence, who are \u201d increasingly alarmed that Hillary Clinton\u2019s proposal for \u201cno-fly zones\u201d in Syria could lead to a military confrontation with Russia that could escalate to levels that were previously unthinkable in the post-cold war world.\u201d Clinton\u2019s opponent, Trump. has recently said that her \u201csafe zones\u201d plan could lead to World War III . Many considered the risk of aerial confrontation with Russian planes to be \u201csevere.\u201d DNI Clapper said he wouldn\u2019t put it past the Russians to shoot down American aircraft. Others worry that she\u2019ll commit the air force to an indefinite air occupation.\\n_ A retired Navy pilot who has flown no-fly zone missions went on the record saying no-fly zones are \u201cthe cocktail party military application of power of choice\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s going to be a disaster. I hope it\u2019s political posturing.\u201d He also said: \u201cI see almost nothing positive that can come from implementing [a no-fly zone] at the current time over Syria. Conversely, the potential to make a bad situation worse is very, very high.\u201d\\n_ Guardian war correspondent Jonathan Steele calls Hillary Clinton\u2019s no-fly zone plan for Syria \u201cmadness\u201d that would not deescalate the war and \u201cthreatens to engulf us all.\u201d He then provides a Syrian war rarity \u2014 some US/UK media truth-telling about the so called rebels:\\nSteele : \u201cSyria is also mired in a propaganda war, and in the heart-rending images that the rebels put out on social media about life and death in Aleppo, the seamier side of the armed groups\u2019 control is suppressed.\u201d\\n_ Paul Mulshine from the NJ Star Ledger notes that top generals on both sides believe that a no-fly zone in Syria would lead to war with Russia.\\n_ Mnar Muhawesh of Mint Press News interviewed FBI whistleblower Coleen Rowley on the risks of Hillary Clinton starting a world war.\\nPlan B for Syria: Anti-aircraft and Anti-Artillery Weapons to CIA-Backed FSA _ On Sunday, the Washington Post reported that Pres. Obama had neither agreed nor disagreed with a Plan B for Syria, to rush ship heavy weapons to \u201ctens of thousands of\u201d CIA-backed \u201crebels\u201d in Syria, the Free Syrian Army (FSA), which could be used against Russian aircraft and artillery. Plan B is supported by CIA director John Brennan and Sec. Defense Ash Carter. Some White House officials are skeptical about the CIA\u2019s assessments. Overall, the CIA has backed \u201c50,000 or more\u201d fighters in a \u201cconstellation\u201d of groups in Syria. The article had some interesting quotes:\\nAnonymous US official : [CIA-backed fighters are] \u201cnot doing any better on the battlefield, they\u2019re up against a more formidable adversary, and they\u2019re increasingly dominated by extremists [\u2026] What has this program become, and how will history record this effort?\u201d\\n2nd Anonymous US official : \u201cThe FSA remains the only vehicle to pursue those goals [\u2026] You can\u2019t defeat ISIL without removing Assad [\u2026] As long as there is a failed state in Syria, ISIL will have a homeland.\u201d\\nFormer senior administration official (involved in 2012 White House discussions of CIA program): \u201cIt\u2019s a fine mess we\u2019ve gotten ourselves into[\u2026] \u201cThere\u2019s a huge risk here since the Russians entered. .\\u2002.\\u2002. The lesson out of this is that if you don\u2019t take action early on, you should almost expect the options to get worse and worse and worse.\u201d\\n2nd administration official involved in Syria discussions : \u201cThe Russians have seized the initiative [\u2026] You can\u2019t pretend you can go to war against Assad and not go to war against Russia.\u201d\\nSenior Turkish official : \u201cThey [US] promised to give more support [\u2026 But it now seems like nothing is going to happen. This coalition hasn\u2019t delivered. It\u2019s obsolete now. So we\u2019re going to look at our options. If Aleppo falls, Assad wins.\u201d\\nRussian Ministries Accuse US Anti-ISIS Coalition of War Crimes _ An airstrike on a mourning procession at a Shia shrine in the town of Daquq (near Kirkuk) on Oct. 21 resulted in civilian casualties leaving 17 people (15 women) dead and 50 injured, mainly women and children. Iran and Russia claimed that it was a US coalition airstrike. An official from the Kirkuk provisional council claimed it was an Iraqi plane , misinformed about ISIS positions. Iraq is investigating .\\n_ The Pentagon denied involvement in any airstrikes in Daquq that resulted in civilian casualties. Jason Ditz at antiwar.com notes that the \u201cdenial\u2019s very specific caveats, that they didn\u2019t deny attacking Daquq, or indeed the mosque, doesn\u2019t help with credibility.\u201d The US track record on admitting to civilian casualties during anti-ISIS missions hasn\u2019t been very good . Locals identified the attacker as a warplane but could not tell whose plane it was.\\n_ Iran\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman, Bahram Ghasemi, said :\\nGhasemi : \u201cAttacking innocent and mourning people cannot be justified by any excuse. The suffering people of Iraq should not be under terrorist attacks on the one hand, and on the other, bombardment by foreign military forces that prance around in Iraq under the pretext of fighting terrorism.\u201d\\n_ The Russian Ministry of Defense said the US-led coalition was responsible for the strikes and inferred that they commit war crimes almost daily:\\nRussian MoD : \u201cRussian reconnaissance pinpointed two jets conducting airstrikes on Daquq, located 30 kilometers to the south of Kirkuk, where, according to our data, there are no ISIS fighters. [\u2026] \u201cThese deadly attacks on civilian areas, which have all the marks of war crimes, are becoming almost a daily routine for the international coalition.\u201d\\nAmnesty International: US Coalition Severely Underestimates Civilian Casualties in Syria _ Lynn Maalouf, deputy director for research at Amnesty International\u2019s Beirut regional office said :\\nMaalouf : \u201cIt\u2019s high time the U.S. authorities came clean about the full extent of the civilian damage caused by coalition attacks in Syria [\u2026] \u201cWe fear the U.S.-led coalition is significantly underestimating the harm caused to civilians in its operations in Syria [\u2026] \u201cAnalysis of available evidence suggests that in each of these cases, coalition forces failed to take adequate precautions to minimize harm to civilians and damage to civilian objects [\u2026] Some of these attacks may constitute disproportionate or otherwise indiscriminate attacks.\u201d [Emphasis added]\\n_ Based on Amnesty\u2019s analysis of 11 US coalition attacks, the evidence suggests \u201cas many as 300 civilians were killed.\u201d The Pentagon has only acknowledged 1 death in these attacks. Research by other monitoring organizations indicates that the total number of civilians killed in US coalition airstrikes has been as high as 600 or more than 1000 . The strikes hit villages, homes, public markets, and shelters. In one case, a double-tap strike was reported in the village of Ayn al-Khan, Hasakah, where a helicopter gunship returned and killed first responders, even though the Kurdish fighters claimed to have warned the coalition of civilians in the area. [Emphasis added]\\nSurvivor : \u201c\u2018At this point I had a two-month-old baby boy in my arms whom I had rescued. The hit caused me to fall and drop him\u2026 I fell into the hole made by the air strike. That was what saved me\u2026 My mother, aunt, wife and children \u2013 a daughter who was four years old and a son who was two and a half were all killed. The woman and her son who I\u2019d rescued were killed. Everyone but me was killed,\u2019 he said.\u201d\\nUN and Rights Groups Condemn Russia and Syria for Airstrikes on Idlib School _ UNICEF and monitoring groups accused Russia or Syria of airstrikes on a school compound in the rebel-held village of Haas in Idlib province. 35 people were killed, including 22 children. A graphic photo of a child with a partially severed arm was circulated on social media. UNICEF\u2019s director called it an outrage and a war crime, if deliberate. The UN humanitarian chief said he was \u201cincandescent with rage\u201d and held the UN Security Council for not stopping the suffering.\\n_ At the UN Security Council meeting, the Russian ambassador Churkin was attacked by several parties including US ambassador to the UN Samantha Power. Churkin said Russia and Syria had halted airstrikes for the past week and there had been no recognition . US Power, after accusing Russia of not cooperating with the UN and mocking the humanitarian pause, said: Power : \u201cYou don\u2019t get congratulations and credit for not committing war crimes for a day or a week.\u201d She walked out again when the Syrian ambassador spoke.\\nRussia Lost Seat on UN Human Rights Council _ Russia was stripped of its seat on the UN Human Rights Council during a UN general assembly secret vote for re-election for membership. The US and UK won seats on the council. Rights groups had lobbied for this outcome. Hungary and Croatia gained seats in their region. Saudi Arabia kept their seat on the Human Rights Council.\\nOperation Euphrates Shield: Syria Threatens to Down Turkish Planes _ As Turkish-backed forces (CIA and Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA) and the Turkish military) invaded Syria in Jarablus late August, in an offensive called Operation Euphrates Shield, under the pretense of clearing ISIS from the Syrian-Turkish border areas but with the real aim of preventing Kurdish forces from securing a contiguous area in northern Syria. As they advanced westward to northern Aleppo, in the vicinity of al-Bab, they began fighting with Kurdish forces and on Oct. 20 hit the majority Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) with airstrikes. Hurriyet reported , via an anonymous official, that the Syrian government then activated their air defense and threatened to shoot down any Turkish planes in Syrian airspace.\\n_ RT reported on Oct. 29 that the Turkish air force has not been used in Operation Euphrates shield for the past week and that \u201ccoalition forces have also decreased the number of flights in northern Syria.\u201d The lack of air support has slowed their advance toward al-Bab.\\n_ Until the past few days, the Turkish forces have fought with ISIS and the Kurds in northern Syria, but not Syrian coalition forces. But Turkey claims that the Syrian forces attacked them this week near Marea. On Wednesday the Turkish foreign minister said Operation Euphrates Shield would not be deterred by the government forces \u201c until retaking the city of al-Bab .\u201d\\nEast Aleppo \u201cRebels\u201d Firing Chemical Weapons Rockets at Civilian Areas in West Aleppo _ On Sunday, Syrian media reported \u201cshells containing poison gases\u201d fired at residential areas in West Aleppo from opposition fighters in East Aleppo. An RT crew on the ground reported \u201c36 cases of suffocation\u201d and Al-Mayadeen media reported that all victims were civilians. The Russian ambassador to the UN reported via the Russian foreign ministry that 16,000 people were killed by US-backed opposition groups between February and September.\\n_ The head of Aleppo University Hospital said 36 people (both fighters and civilians) were injured by the chlorine gas fired into West Aleppo by the opposition in East Aleppo, who have launched a recent offensive on the government-held areas after more than a week of Russia and Syria halting airstrikes. The London-based and pro-rebel Syrian Observatory for Human Rights confirmed that chemical weapon attacks happened.\\nAir Base in Hasakah _ The air base that US military engineers renovated months ago for use by US special forces and Kurdish forces:\\nFor the first time, mystical Abu Hajar Airport near the town of Rmelan in the al-Hasakah Governorate #Syria #USAF pic.twitter.com/vlj78ew5if \\n\u2014 Aldin Abazovi\u0107 (@Ald_Aba) October 30, 2016 \\n\\nUkraine _ Fighting has broken out in \u201cthe northern suburbs of Donetsk, the airport district, the Yasinovataya checkpoint, and Spartak village\u201d in Ukraine, where there had been a ceasefire, according to Fort Russ .\\n_ The Ukraine military has reportedly been massing on the frontlines of Lugansk .

Lawrence Wilkerson and Gordon Adams on the National Interest: \u201c No, Hillary Clinton\u2019s Foreign Policy Judgement Isn\u2019t As Good As Everyone Says .\u201d Wilkerson also discussed the article on The Real News this week. Wilkerson, who served under the George W. Bush administration, says he\u2019s very concerned because of her past history and the fact that a lot of the people who are advising her look like the people who were advising Pres. George W. Bush. Trump has been all over the place, Wilkerson said, but he has also indicated that he wouldn\u2019t get us into the wars \u201con the edge of empire\u201d that cost us so much and don\u2019t produce good result. Wilkerson said from what he has heard, the military and the Joint Chiefs are reluctant to intervene in Syria against Assad.
