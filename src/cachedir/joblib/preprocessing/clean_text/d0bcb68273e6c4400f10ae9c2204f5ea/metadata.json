Students, refusing to wait until the event\u2019s QA, shouted at Moore during the lecture portion of the event. \u201cI am black, I am disabled, I\u2019m a woman,\u201d one attendee shouted, before storming out of the room and pounding her fists on the windows. After mocking\u201dGirl, there\u2019s still time, we can punch you too,\u201d another student shouted after Moore mocked the disrupters\u2019 low energy. \u201cSorry, not a threat,\u201d the student added after several attendees gasped at the suggestion that Moore would be punched. \u201cCan you not wait until the QA and be polite?\u201d Moore responded. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you shut up and have respect for your fellow students?\u201d Despite the interruptions, the event featured some positive moments.
