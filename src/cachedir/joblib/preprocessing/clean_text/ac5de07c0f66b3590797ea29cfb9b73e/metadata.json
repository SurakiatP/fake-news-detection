S. when an Islamic terrorist is said to be, \u201cknown to law enforcement,\u201d the translation is: \u201cHe is being actively ignored by law enforcement. \u201d[After the latest terrorist attack in Britain  \u2014   at least as of this writing  \u2014   Prime Minister Theresa May bravely announced, \u201cEnough is enough!\u201d  What is the point of these macho proclamations after every terrorist attack? Nothing will be done to stop the next attack. Political correctness prohibits us from doing anything that might stop it. Poland doesn\u2019t admit Muslims: It has no terrorism. Japan doesn\u2019t admit Muslims: It has no terrorism. The United Kingdom and the United States used to have very few Muslims: They used to have almost no terrorism. (One notable exception was chosen as the National Freedom Hero in this year\u2019s Puerto Rican parade in New York!) Notwithstanding the lovely Muslim shopkeeper who wouldn\u2019t hurt a fly, everyone knows that with every tranche of   Muslims we bring in, we\u2019re also getting some number of   killers. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair dumped millions of Third World Muslims on Britain to force \u201cmulticulturalism\u201d on the country. Now Britons are living with the result. Since the   attack, every U. S. president has done the same. President Bush admitted Muslim immigrants at a faster pace after   than we had been doing before  . Whatever the   attackers intended to accomplish, I bet they didn\u2019t expect that. Now we can\u2019t get rid of them. Under the rules of political correctness, Western countries are prohibited from even pausing our breakneck importation of Muslims, much less sending the recent arrivals home. In defense of the poor saps responding to every terrorist attack with flowers, candles and hashtags, these are people who have no ability to do anything else. Western leaders are in full possession of the tools to end Islamic terrorism in their own countries, just as their forebears once ended Nazi Stormtroopers. Unable to summon the backbone to defeat the current enemy, the West is stuck constantly reliving that glorious time when they whipped the Nazis. In almost every Western country  \u2014   except the one with an increasingly beleaguered First Amendment  \u2014   it\u2019s against the law to deny the Holocaust. Are we really worried about a resurgence of Nazism? Isn\u2019t Islamic terrorism a little higher on our \u201cimmediate problems\u201d list? How about making it illegal to make statements in support of ISIS,   female genital mutilation, Sharia law or any act of terrorism? The country with a First Amendment can\u2019t do that  \u2014   the most that amendment allows us to do is ban conservative speakers from every college campus in the nation. But if our elected representatives really cared about stopping the next terrorist attack, instead of merely \u201cwatching\u201d those on the \u201cwatch\u201d list, they\u2019d deport them. To this day, we have a whole office at the Department of Justice dedicated to finding and deporting Nazis even without proof they personally committed crimes against Jews. But we can\u2019t manage to deport hearty young Muslims who post love notes to ISIS on their Facebook pages. If the Clinton administration had merely enforced laws on the books against an Afghani immigrant, Mir Seddique Mateen, and excluded him based on his   list of terrorist affiliations, his son Omar wouldn\u2019t have been around to slaughter 49 people at an Orlando nightclub last year. If Secretary of State John Kerry, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson or anyone else in our vaunted immigration vetting system had done his job, Pakistani Tashfeen Malik never would have been admitted to this country to commit mass murder in San Bernardino a year after she arrived. Before being warmly welcomed by the U. S. Malik\u2019s social media posts were bristling with hatred of America and enthusiasm for jihad. We\u2019re already paying a battery of FBI agents to follow every Muslim refugee around the country. When they find out that one of them lists his hobby as \u201cjihad,\u201d we need them to stop watching and start deporting. Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, the rest of the useless GOP  \u2014   and obviously every Democrat  \u2014   have the blood of the next terrorist attack on their hands if they don\u2019t make crystal clear that admiring remarks about Islamic terrorism is a deportable act. But they won\u2019t do it. That\u2019s \u201cnot who we are,\u201d as Ryan famously said. True, most Muslims are peaceful. Guess what? Most Nazis were peaceful! We didn\u2019t knock ourselves out to admit as many of them as we could, screening out only the Nazis convicted of mass murder. Before we were even formally involved in World War II, the FBI was all over the German American Bund. No one worried about upsetting our German neighbors. (Perhaps because they knew these were Germans and wouldn\u2019t start bombing things and shooting people.) But today, our official position is: Let\u2019s choose love so as not to scare our Muslim neighbors. Isn\u2019t that precisely what we want to do? Facing an immobile government, two British men  \u2014   by which I mean British men  \u2014   were sentenced to PRISON for putting bacon on a mosque in Bristol last year. One died in prison just after Christmas, an ancient religious holiday recently replaced by Ramadan. If we can\u2019t look askance at Muslims without committing a hate crime, can\u2019t we at least stop admitting ever more \u201crefugees,\u201d some percentage of whom are going to be terrorists and 100 percent of whom will consume massive amounts of government resources? No, that\u2019s \u201cnot who we are. \u201d Until any Western leader is willing to reduce the number of Muslims in our midst, could they spare us the big talk? \u201cWe surrender\u201d would at least have the virtue of honesty.'"}, "time": 1742561882.7747378}
