Trump\u2019s campaign appeared to be crumbling as he entered the second presidential debate against Hillary Clinton, with Republicans withdrawing support for his candidacy after the disclosure of a vulgar recording that showed him bragging about sexual assault. Facing a barrage of tough questions, the Republican nominee managed to scrape through, evading questions, fabricating answers and attacking his opponent in deeply personal terms. While expectations for Mr. Trump were low, many commentators and critics thought that he exceeded them and allayed concerns among supporters that his candidacy was finished. Here is a sampling of the   reaction: \u201cHe improved, exceeded expectations, decisively won several exchanges. She could have landed a death blow tonight and did not. \u201d Guy Benson, political editor at the conservative website Townhall _______ \u201cI may not care for Trump, but he beat Hillary tonight fair and square even with Martha Raddatz trying to defeat him. \u201d Erick Erickson, writer for the conservative blog The Resurgent _______ \u201cDonald Trump knows he won\u2019t be president. He\u2019s now in full       mode  \u2014   a scowling, pouting menace who threatened during a nationally televised debate to throw Hillary Clinton in jail and called her husband the most sexually abusive man in political history. \u201d Ron Fournier, writer for The Atlantic _______ \u201cIn keeping her cool and indicting Trump\u2019s bad behavior and finally provoking him to threaten to put her in jail, she made certain no one not already in Trump\u2019s corner would sign on with him. \u201d Jennifer Rubin, writer for The Washington Post\u2019s Right Turn blog _______ \u201cAll the Republicans who backed away from @realDonaldTrump look really really stupid right now. \u201d Laura Ingraham, conservative commentator and editor of LifeZette ________ \u201cTrump looks and sounds defeated. Almost incoherent. .. \u201d Marc Lamont Hill, Morehouse College professor ________ \u201cShe had a chance to throw a knockout punch at Donald Trump and instead looked more at times like Glass Joe from Nintendo\u2019s  . I lost count how many times she said to go to her website or whine about the lack of \u201cfact checking\u201d as the debate went on. Trump had her on the ropes several times. \u201d Jay Caruso, blogger for the conservative website Red State ________ \u201cTrump picked Putin over Pence, explicitly abandoned Aleppo, lied about Iraq again  again,  showed his appalling temperament. \u201d Ken Gude, senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a liberal group ________ \u201cWith references to Lewinsky scandal,   Benghazi, attacking media, Trump likely shored up his base. Hard to see him leaving ticket. \u201d Perry Bacon Jr. political reporter for NBC News ________ \u201cI\u2019m a Muslim, and I would like to report a crazy man threatening a woman on a stage in Missouri. \u201d Moustafa Bayoumi, author of \u201cThis Muslim American Life\u201d and professor at Brooklyn College, CUNY ________ \u201cRepublicans who took heart at his antic,   performance are grasping at a thin, crazy reed that the coming news cycles will snap. \u201d Rick Wilson, Republican strategist'"}, "time": 1742564445.5185227}
