Police officials said the man was not considered a suspect, or even a person of interest, in the Aug. 2 killing of the jogger, Karina Vetrano, 30. Investigators said they were hoping to question him in the hopes that he could help them find the killer. \u201cWe want to speak with this person because we feel he was there,\u201d Robert K. Boyce, the New York Police Department\u2019s chief of detectives, told reporters. \u201cI\u2019d never want to tell you he\u2019s wanted for this crime, because he\u2019s not. We have no evidence to say that. \u201d The police said the man had been spotted by a utility worker on a path running by the Belt Parkway, which is on the northern end of Spring Creek Park. Ms. Vetrano was found face down in the park, about 15 feet from a trail, by her father and police investigators, hours after she had left her home in the Howard Beach neighborhood to run. The man is believed to be between 35 and 45 and about 5 feet 10 inches tall. He was seen with a beard and wearing a red shirt, dark pants and a wool cap. Investigators have been in possession of the sketch for just over a week, Chief Boyce said, but officials decided to release it after investigators scoured the video evidence collected from the area and found no trace of the man. He said it was unclear if the man depicted had gone from the walkway into East New York, Brooklyn, or Queens. Based on video evidence, investigators do not believe the actual assailant fled the scene into Howard Beach. Instead they think he either went north into Queens or crossed over into Brooklyn. In the weeks since Ms. Vetrano\u2019s killing, investigators have received more than 80 tips all but about nine of them have been vetted, Chief Boyce said. Investigators had also collected DNA evidence from Ms. Vetrano\u2019s phone, which had been discarded in the park, as well as from her neck and under her fingernails all of it had come from the same person, he said. But the DNA evidence did not match with that of offenders whose profiles were in police databases. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe this has anything to do with Karina\u2019s background at all,\u201d Chief Boyce said in a separate news conference held on Tuesday. \u201cWe still maintain it\u2019s a random attack. There\u2019s nothing to suggest than anyone in her past would do this to her. \u201d The authorities have put up a $35, 000 reward for information leading to Ms. Vetrano\u2019s killer, and a separate, private effort online has raised more than $267, 000.'"}, "time": 1742564444.02803}
