[\u2018Critical\u2019 which means the government and security services believes an attack is imminent, was put in place this week and saw the deployment of 1, 000 troops of the British army to assist police in their duties, with an option to expand the deployment to 5, 000. After a number of arrests across the country including locations in Manchester and Nuneaton, Warwickshire, the terror threat has fallen to the second highest level, where it was before the Manchester attack.  Returned to critical, the government now assess the likelihood of a terror attack to be \u201chighly likely\u201d as opposed to imminent. The reduction is likely to have stemmed from the flurry of arrests in recent days, with 11 individuals now in police custody. British   boss Mark Rowley said a \u201clarge part\u201d of the terror network that had been connected to bomber Salman Abedi had been dismantled by the arrests, But he said there were still \u201cgaps in our understanding\u201d of the plot, as investigators probed Abedi\u2019s potential links to jihadis in Britain, Europe, Libya and the Middle East. Despite that there were still \u201cgaps in our understanding\u201d of the conspiracy to kill, he said.

While the presence of 1, 000 armed soldiers would continue over the bank holiday weekend to assist police and provide   from the public, Operation Temperer is to be wound down at the start of next week.
