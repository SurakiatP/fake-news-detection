Even as crowds poured into shows on Hellenistic kingdoms and   fashion, the Met\u2019s deficit was approaching $40 million and had forced the buyout or layoff of some 90 employees. An expansion into a satellite building cost millions of dollars more than expected. A new Met logo and marketing plan were rolled out at great expense  \u2014   and greeted with ridicule. Then, last month, a new $600 million wing was postponed by several years, frustrating the Met\u2019s efforts to become a serious player in the competitive field of Modern and contemporary art. Tension inside the Met, the country\u2019s largest art museum, is running so high that when curators and conservators recently wrote a letter protesting compensation cuts, the museum\u2019s leaders chose not to show it to trustees for fear of leaks and bad publicity. Those who wanted to see the document had to go to the office of the Met\u2019s general counsel and read it under observation. After enjoying boom years, one of the most   cultural institutions in the world is now struggling with missteps and the perils of overreaching at a time of uncertain resources. While many museums face financial and competitive pressures, the Met\u2019s troubles are magnified, given its stature on the world stage. How can a behemoth like the Met, the thinking goes, possibly stumble? Some curators and trustees have zeroed in on Thomas P. Campbell, the Met\u2019s director and chief executive since 2008, as well as the board that has backed him. The anguish can be intense, given the love that all involved have for the Met. \u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy to see a great institution in decline,\u201d said George R. Goldner, who in 2014 retired after 21 years as the chairman of the Met\u2019s drawings and prints department and has since served as a consultant to the museum. \u201cTo have inherited a museum as strong as the Met was 10 years ago  \u2014   with a great curatorial staff  \u2014   and to have it be what it is today is unimaginable. \u201d Several people inside the museum, most of whom spoke anonymously for fear of losing their positions, said the Met under Mr. Campbell had tried to do too much too fast: overhiring in the digital department overspending on an additional building, the Met Breuer, and on rebranding overdrawing from unrestricted endowment funds to cover costs emphasizing Modern and contemporary art at the expense of core departments and pursuing the new wing before the financing was in place. Instead, the Met should have been contracting, given falling revenue from its retail stores and admission fees and rising expenses. At the same time, some hope that by reckoning with its troubles, the Met is poised to turn a corner. \u201cWe\u2019re getting to the same page,\u201d said Keith Christiansen, the chairman of the Met\u2019s European paintings department. \u201cOne benefit from all this: It\u2019s brought the departments together with the administration to sit down at a common table, and that\u2019s something. Now what do we do to move forward and make sure the mission of the museum is not compromised?\u201d Efforts to right the ship have been difficult and painful. In addition to staff cuts, curators were asked to curtail spending for shows and acquisitions. The Met stages nearly 60 exhibitions a year, far more than most museums, but now expects to reduce its exhibitions to about 40 a year. Instead of moving forward with the architect David Chipperfield on a wing intended to help attract art and money from contemporary collectors, the Met has been forced to prioritize the replacement of its aging skylights and roof above the European paintings galleries. In an interview, Mr. Campbell acknowledged that the museum had \u201cbeen through a trying year. \u201d \u201cMy colleagues have every right to feel upset,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, one has to step back and look at the success of the institution. \u201d To be sure, most agree that the museum\u2019s expansive collections and ambitious exhibitions remain strong. The recent Kerry James Marshall survey at the Met Breuer was widely judged a success, though some critics say the museum\u2019s first retrospective of a living black artist would have been even more momentous in the hallowed main building. In addition, the museum\u2019s attendance has increased to about seven million visitors a year, including the Cloisters. The Breuer, which opened in March, has drawn 557, 000 visitors, exceeding projections. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a whole Modern art collection in the Breuer we didn\u2019t have before,\u201d said Hamilton E. James, a Met trustee. \u201cAttendance is at   records critical acclaim has never been as good. An awful lot of wonderful things have gone on. \u201d Moreover, Met officials say, many cultural institutions have been grappling with a structural deficit  \u2014   when costs exceed revenues, despite a strong economy. The Museum of Modern Art and the Brooklyn Museum, for example, also recently offered buyouts  \u2014   though they did not then move to layoffs. The New York Philharmonic has delayed the tentative date for opening its $600 million rebuilt hall to get a better sense of its cost. And the Los Angeles County Museum of Art is struggling to raise nearly half the $600 million needed for its expansion. While the Met charged Mr. Campbell with strengthening the museum\u2019s Modern and contemporary art activities, his focus on the Met Breuer and new wing has been controversial. Why try to compete with the new Whitney Museum of American Art and the Museum of Modern Art, some ask, instead of sticking to what the Met already does best? Mr. Campbell said he had aimed \u201cto sustain an environment in which scholarship could flourish and be the engine of our program, as well as to expand our audiences, to digitize the institution and to revisit what it is to be an encyclopedic museum. \u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve made remarkable progress, but these things are flexible, and they need modulation,\u201d he added. \u201cIn the same period, we have had to balance our expenditures and our income. In light of that, we\u2019re certainly doing some recalibration on the goals we\u2019ve set ourselves. \u201d Some critics say Mr. Campbell has been out of his depth  \u2014   a tapestry curator thrust into the large shoes of the legendary Philippe de Montebello, with no experience running a major institution. (Mr. de Montebello did not have chief executive in his title until 22 years into his   tenure as director.) Moreover, Mr. Campbell, by many accounts, has handled the economic crisis by hunkering down in a defensive crouch rather than reaching out to unite the staff  \u2014   and the full board  \u2014   behind his efforts. Internal critics say he failed to appreciate the upheaval caused by the turnover of   of the curatorial leadership through departures and retirements. They describe the pervasive sense that institutional memory is going out the door and the fear that the Met\u2019s mission to educate through scholarship has been overshadowed by its desire to attract millennials through social media. Mr. Campbell said internal relations was often a challenge at the Met, with its more than   work force, and acknowledged that he could do better. \u201cI\u2019ve tried very hard to open up communications  \u2014   bringing people into briefings, in town hall meetings,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve got it right yet, but we\u2019re heading in the right direction. \u201d \u201cI myself need to evolve my thinking and my interactions,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019ve identified those issues and taken steps to move forward in a very collective manner. \u201d The Boston Consulting Group, hired a year ago pro bono to help with the Met\u2019s restructuring, was asked this month to interview staff members and trustees about their concerns because the museum recognized \u201cthat morale was challenged,\u201d said Daniel H. Weiss, the Met\u2019s president and chief operating officer. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that people feel empowered to say what they think. \u201d When Mr. Weiss, formerly the president of Haverford College, came to the Met last year, he set out to cut $31 million from a $332 million annual budget. He said Mr. Campbell had been open to making the changes required. \u201cWe have gone through a significant and difficult time,\u201d Mr. Weiss said. \u201cTom has been very supportive. \u201d Daniel Brodsky, the museum\u2019s chairman, said that Mr. Campbell and Mr. Weiss had taken appropriate steps toward financial stability and that he and his fellow trustees had not lost confidence in Mr. Campbell\u2019s capacity to lead. \u201cTom is a very bright person, and the board supports him,\u201d he said. Mr. James, the trustee, said many of the Met\u2019s struggles \u201cwere beyond the control\u201d of a chief executive. \u201cYou get bumps in the road, and you have to deal with them. \u201cThe leadership team of Tom and Dan  \u2014   I view it very much as a partnership,\u201d he added. \u201cDan brings a discipline and a businesslike approach. \u201d Still, the Met\u2019s current retrenchment inevitably looks like a repudiation of much of Mr. Campbell\u2019s original agenda. He has been forced to let go many of his key hires, and his timetable for the new wing has been disrupted. The Breuer  \u2014   the Whitney\u2019s former Madison Avenue home, where the Met has an   lease  \u2014   was to be a temporary hub for the museum\u2019s Modern and contemporary activities during construction, so the new wing could be unveiled in 2020, on the Met\u2019s 150th birthday. The wing is also a linchpin of Leonard A. Lauder\u2019s transformative gift of Cubist artworks, valued at more than $1 billion, which needs a worthy exhibition space. But Mr. Campbell said he had not given up on his main goals to bolster contemporary art at the Met and broaden the audience in a technological age. \u201cI love the Met, I love the work I\u2019m doing here,\u201d he said, \u201cAnd I\u2019m very committed to seeing all of these many projects through. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628576.4491448}
