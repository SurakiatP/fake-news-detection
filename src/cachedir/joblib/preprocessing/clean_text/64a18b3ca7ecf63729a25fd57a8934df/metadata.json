Like peanut butter and jelly or shampoo and conditioner in one, they\\'ve been merged into one horrible stinking landfill for your entertainment and the downfall of the republic. \\nThe FBI has reopened its investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private server while secretary of state after discovering new emails \u2013 apparently during the probe of former Rep. Anthony Weiner\u2019s sexting \u2013 in a stunning turn of events just days before the presidential election. \\nFBI Director James Comey wrote in a letter to top members of Congress Friday that the bureau has \u201clearned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.\u201d \\nComey did not detail those emails, saying only that they surfaced \u201cin connection with an unrelated case.\u201d \\nAn FBI source, though, confirmed to Fox News that the new emails were discovered after the bureau seized devices belonging to disgraced Rep. Weiner and his wife Huma Abedin, a top Clinton aide who recently announced she was separating from the former congressman. The New York Times first reported on the Weiner investigation connection, noting the FBI had been probing texts Weiner sent to a 15-year-old girl. \\nAs Donald Trump and congressional Republicans seized on the FBI\u2019s decision, interim Democratic Party leader Donna Brazile simply tweeted, \u201cGood grief,\u201d after the news of the Anthony Weiner connection broke. \\nCan\\'t argue with her there. \\nIt would be hilarious if Anthony Weiner and thereby Huma Abedin led to the downfall of Hillary\\'s lifelong ambition. You just know someone is going to \"commit suicide\" in a D.C. park. \\nBut does anyone in the Democratic Party really look forward to 4 to 8 years of this? This is how big of a mess Hillary is now. We\\'ve reached the point where her ongoing email scandal is now intertwined with a sexting investigation of a 15-year-old girl. And that\\'s just during the election.'"}, "time": 1742564153.2424233}
