If you guessed Hillary Clinton, you\u2019re right. But if you guessed Kellyanne Conway, you\u2019re right, too. Misogyny, it seems, remains a bipartisan exercise. Whatever legitimate criticisms can be leveled at each woman, it\u2019s striking how often that anger is expressed using the same sexist themes, from women as well as men. Mrs. Clinton \u201crepeats her tacky outfits,\u201d one Twitter critic sniped. The Inauguration Day outfit of Ms. Conway, a counselor to President Trump, looked like \u201ca night terror of an android majorette. \u201d Mrs. Clinton\u2019s hair has drawn relentless derision one Twitter user recently asked: \u201cWhy does Kellyanne Conway always look like she\u2019s still drunk  wearing make up from last night\u2019s bender?\u201d And both women have been repeatedly compared to witches from \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d most recently in pictures shared on Twitter tying Ms. Conway to the witch killed under Dorothy\u2019s house. The two women are at opposite ideological poles, but they stir up the same lingering cultural discomfort with ambitious, assertive women. \u201cThese sexist memes are not the purview of one party,\u201d said Karen Finney, a senior adviser to the Clinton campaign. \u201cWe fear strong women and women with power. These attacks are meant to delegitimize that power. \u201d Ms. Conway has drawn scorn, and been disinvited from some news programs, for her references to a \u201cBowling Green massacre\u201d that never took place and her defense of claims about the size of the crowd at Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration as \u201calternative facts. \u201d Yet some of the criticisms have taken on a distinctly sexualized tone. Witness the furor over her sitting on her knees on a couch in the Oval Office during a reception for presidents of historically black colleges. While she drew fire for disrespect, some of the criticisms included digs about her spreading her legs and raunchy allusions to oral sex, Monica Lewinsky and Bill Clinton. Representative Cedric L. Richmond, Democrat of Louisiana, told a   joke that hers was a \u201cfamiliar\u201d position in the Oval Office of the 1990s, drawing a rebuke from none other than Chelsea Clinton. (Mr. Richmond apologized Sunday evening.) A \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d skit riffed on Ms. Conway as a \u201cFatal Attraction\u201d stalker, breaking into the CNN correspondent Jake Tapper\u2019s house to seduce him into having her on his show. \u201cThere seems to be great resentment of both as power hungry and wanting to control men,\u201d said Marjorie J. Spruill, the author of \u201cDivided We Stand: The Battle Over Women\u2019s Rights and Family Values That Polarized American Politics. \u201d \u201cWhereas Hillary is called castrating or shrewish, Conway is often called a slut. The implication is that she is using femininity to control men. \u201d Ms. Spruill noted that Ms. Conway had leaned back to take pictures as a favor to the participants, but that some critics had cast the pose as a sexual  . Ironies abound. Ms. Conway is loathed by many Clinton aides as the architect of a presidential campaign that they felt used overtly and implicitly sexist messages. Mr. Trump repeatedly denigrated women for their appearance and, after taking office, directed his female staff members to \u201cdress like women. \u201d Many conservative women, from Sarah Palin to Ann Coulter, have emphasized their femininity to distance themselves from feminists, whom they accuse of hating men. In a recent interview at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Ms. Conway said she supported many feminist principles but said she would not call herself one because feminism is     and identified with the left. \u201cI think some of the reticence that might be coming across in not a huge chorus of defense of Kellyanne Conway in the face of these sexist comments is the feeling that she doesn\u2019t have our back,\u201d said Gillian Thomas, a senior staff lawyer of the Women\u2019s Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame,\u201d Ms. Thomas continued. \u201cIf women were more united and speaking up at this behavior, including when it\u2019s perpetrated by the left, we\u2019d all be a lot better off. \u201d Ms. Conway suggested in an interview with The Daily Caller that there would have been more outrage at the comments if she had been a liberal woman, adding, \u201cAnd it is not just if I were a liberal woman, but if I were a   one. \u201d Ms. Conway did not respond to a message left with her assistant requesting comment for this article. Still, Ms. Conway has spirited defenders on the right on social media who say she should be championed as an example of a groundbreaking woman in politics instead of mocked in sexist terms, and some liberal women in Facebook comments chided others for sexism. \u201cLadies  Gents, I disagree with her as much as anyone,\u201d wrote someone identified as Melissa Mae. \u201cIt would be nice to see comments sticking to valid points instead of ALWAYS going after women on the basis of \u2018looks. \u2019\u201d Mirya R. Holman, an assistant professor of political science at Tulane University who studies gender and politics, said, \u201cThis does mimic what conservative women have said in the past: \u2018You liberals think you\u2019re so enlightened, but we still get people saying vile things about us. \u2019\u201d Jennifer Palmieri, the director of communications for the Clinton campaign, who memorably clashed with Ms. Conway at a postelection forum at Harvard, also sees echoes of the sexism that dogged her candidate in the attacks on Ms. Conway. She said she believed Ms. Conway should be held accountable for her actions. But she noted that while Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist, is portrayed as an \u201cevil genius\u201d who cannily promotes images of an America at risk from immigrants and foreign competitors, Ms. Conway is depicted as \u201ccrazy\u201d for devising and promoting similar messages. \u201cWhat I find really disturbing is because he\u2019s a man, that\u2019s really smart and strategic,\u201d Ms. Palmieri said. \u201cWhy is there not a theory behind what Kellyanne does?\u201d Whether the attacks come from the right or the left, they show a persistent anger toward women who step outside conventional roles. Social media has long enabled a thriving subculture of the violent disparagement of women, such as the GamerGate threats toward those who challenged the male bastion of video games. Much as latent racism surfaced during the presidency of Barack Obama, this election exposed a vitriol toward powerful women that continues to erupt, beyond the confines of Twitter or Reddit. \u201cTo me, the 2016 election was hopefully an opportunity to be reminded that we\u2019re not in some kind of postgender society,\u201d Professor Holman said. \u201cThere\u2019s a smaller set of acceptable behaviors for women. \u201d Ms. Finney, a longtime Clinton aide, has watched those issues play out for more than 20 years in public life as Mrs. Clinton served as a   for debates about women\u2019s roles. She said she and conservative women would sit in green rooms awaiting television appearances and trade stories about how they were attacked. \u201cThere is this sense: \u2018Are you kidding me? \u2019\u201d she said. \u201c\u2018Are we going back to this?\u2019 Maybe we have to go back to go forward. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562980.3177347}
