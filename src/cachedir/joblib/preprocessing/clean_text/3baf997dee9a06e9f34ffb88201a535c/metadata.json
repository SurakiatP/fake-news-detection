Of course, these clever propagandists have since accomplished their goal of establishing the outrageous myth of the Jewish Holocaust\u2122 in the public consciousness following the end of WW2. In large part due to fictional Hollywood movies like \u201cShindler\u2019s List\u201d from that lying venomous worm, Steven Spielberg. Read The First Holocaust online here . \\nWhy the number \u201cSix Million\u201d? \\nAs documented in the book The First Holocaust , the Zionists have continuously and hysterically attempted to claim that six million Jews were dead, dying or in grave danger in Europe and Russia since the late 1800\u2019s. Any time there was turmoil in Europe, albeit turmoil often instigated by Jews in the first place, prominent Zionist figures and Jewish-controlled media organizations world wide continuously whipped up a frenzy with phony sob stories to get people to feel sorry for Europe\u2019s Jews and donate money to Jewish charities. It turns out that this mythical six million figure, long since discredited even by mainstream Holohoax historians, comes from a Jewish-Talmudic religious myth that says \u201cye shall return minus six million\u201d or \u201cyou shall return to the land of Israel with six million less\u201d, and of course WW2 birthed the modern state of Israel which was established in 1948. Israeli Jews often excuse their systematic genocide of Palestinians and theft of Palestinian lands by bringing up the so-called Holocaust\u2122 of WW2, which any serious researcher and critical thinker knows by now is a fraud of collosal proportions. The Zionists have so much influence that they turned a delusional Jewish religious prophecy into \u201chistorical fact\u201d. \\nFrom History & Scriptural Origins of the Six Million Number ; \\n[Quote 1] Jewish prophecies in the Torah require that 6 million Jews must \u201cvanish\u201d before the state of Israel can be formed. \u201cYou shall return minus 6 million.\u201d That\u2019s why Tom Segev, an Israeli historian, declared that the \u201c6 million\u201d is an attempt to transform the Holocaust story into state religion. Those six million, according to prophecy, had to disappear in \u201cburning ovens\u201d, which the judicial version of the Holocaust now authenticates. As a matter of fact, Robert B. Goldmann writes: \u201c. . . without the Holocaust, there would be no Jewish State.\u201d A simple consequence: Given six million Jews gassed at Auschwitz who ended up in the \u201cburning ovens\u201d (the Greek word holocaust means burned offerings), therefore, the prophecies have now been \u201cfulfilled\u201d and Israel can become a \u201clegitimate state\u201d. \u2013Unknown [ Quote 2] Regarding the \u2018six million\u2019 number you should know the following: In the Hebrew text of the Torah prophesies, one can read \u201cyou shall return\u201d. In the text the letter \u201cV\u201d or \u201cVAU\u201d is absent, as Hebrew does not have any numbers; the letter V stands for the number 6. Ben Weintraub, a religious scientist, learned from rabbis that the meaning of the missing letter means the number is \u20186 million\u2019. The prophesy then reads: You will return, but with 6 million less. See Ben Weintraub: \u201cThe Holocaust Dogma of Judaism\u201d, Cosmo Publishing, Washington 1995, page 3. The missing 6 million must be so before the Jews can return to the Promised Land. Jahweh sees this as a cleaning of the souls of the sinful people. The Jews must, on the return to the Promised Land, be clean \u2014 the cleaning shall be done in burning stokes. \u2013A Correspondent \\nA few examples for your consideration; \\n1900- Jewish leader lets slip the Zionist Holohoax scheme \\nJUNE 11, 1900 \u2013 NEW YORK TIMES \u2013 page 7 \u2013 Rabbi Wise\u2019s Address\u201cThere are 6,000,000 living, bleeding, suffering arguments in favor of Zionism.\u201d 1906- \\n1911- \\nMax Nordau , co-founder of the World Zionist Organization together with Theodore Herzl, warns of the \u201cannihilation of six million people\u201d at the Zionist congress in Basle, Switzerland.
