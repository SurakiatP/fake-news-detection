[\u201cKeep in mind if you are a conservative who has been fighting for repeal and replace, this is your chance,\u201d he said at the White House briefing.  He also warned that Republicans who promised health care reform but did not back the bill would \u201cprobably pay a price at home. \u201d \u201cI think there\u2019s going to be a price to be paid. But it\u2019s going to be with their own voters, and they\u2019re going to have to go back and explain to them why they made a commitment to them, and then didn\u2019t follow through,\u201d he said. The bill is scheduled for a vote in the House on Thursday, but House Freedom Caucus members say the new changes to the bill don\u2019t go far enough, and they remain opposed to the bill. \u201cAt this time, the bill does not have the votes to pass,\u201d Freedom Caucus Communications director Alyssa Farah told Breitbart News on Monday evening, after the new changes were announced. House Speaker Paul Ryan ( ) needs 216 votes for the bill. If 22 Republicans defect, the bill fails. The new changes included a   for those receiving Medicaid, struck out abortion tax credits, and set rules that would make it more difficult for New York State to shift New York City\u2019s Medicaid\u2019s costs onto the rest of the state. The House Freedom Caucus rejected the changes as too little, too late. They want complete repeal of Obamacare. President Trump went to the Capitol Tuesday morning to convince skeptical members to support the bill, and plans on talking to more members on Wednesday. He was reported to have threatened members voting against the bill with primary challenges, but Spicer did not confirm those reports. \u201cLet\u2019s get through the vote,\u201d he said. \u201cI think one of the things that he made clear this morning was that he was going to make sure that the people who did support this, he would be out there supporting them. And so I\u2019m not going to focus on the negative as much as the positive today. \u201d Spicer characterized the bill as keeping a promise to voters. \u201cAnd this bill, while probably not everybody got everything they wanted, does exactly what we said. It\u2019s repealing it and replacing it with all of the principles and the aspects that we discussed throughout not only last cycle, but in a lot of these cases back to 2010,\u201d Spicer said.'"}, "time": 1742562532.7830646}
