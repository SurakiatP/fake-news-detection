Supreme Court, claiming that Trump \u201cstole\u201d the seat from President Barack Obama. [In a fundraising email, the Democratic National Committee said (original emphasis):  Judge Neil Gorsuch, Donald Trump\u2019s   Supreme Court nominee, has a legal history that shows a deep sympathy for corporate interests and an apparent disdain for workers. Donald wants to put Judge Gorsuch in the Supreme Court seat the GOP stole from President Obama. Add your name to tell the Senate to reject his nomination. As an attorney, Judge Gorsuch routinely represented big businesses in class action lawsuits. As a judge on the Tenth Circuit, he wrote a concurring opinion in Hobby Lobby v. Sebelius  \u2014   the case that allowed employers to deny basic health care coverage to women by ruling the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraceptive mandate was unconstitutional. He upheld a decision that denied   insurance benefits to a worker who sustained a   injury that required spinal surgery. He even dissented from a ruling in favor of a truck driver whose employer illegally fired him for abandoning a trailer with locked brakes  \u2014   so he wouldn\u2019t freeze to death. And as a member of the   \u201cFederalist Society,\u201d Gorsuch believes in severely restricting the power that federal agencies like the EPA have to regulate businesses. It\u2019s not hard to see why Trump loves him so much  \u2014   but from where we\u2019re sitting, Joel, Judge Gorsuch has no business on the Supreme Court bench. Republicans declined to move Obama\u2019s nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, through the Senate, based on the principle  \u2014   articulated by  . Joe Biden ( ) decades before  \u2014   that a Supreme Court Justice should not be confirmed in the last year of a lame duck administration. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.
