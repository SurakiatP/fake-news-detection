On this weekend\u2019s broadcast of \u201cSunday Morning Futures\u201d on the Fox News Channel, President Donald Trump\u2019s deputy assistant Dr. Sebastian Gorka said Trump was \u201cnot an interventionist   . \u201d  Gorka said, \u201cI would like to make one thing very clear because there\u2019s been a lot of missed reporting on this. The president is not an interventionist   . nothing has changed from November 7th 2 today. He\u2019s been explicit. We are not invading other people\u2019s countries. This isn\u2019t some neoconservative   administration. Nevertheless, we have obligations to our friends in the region and on top of that, things like weapons of mass distraction, nuclear weapons in the hands of rogue regimes, chemical weapons, those will not be countenanced because they are a threat to Americans as well and that is why you see the leadership out of the White House you are seen. \u201d Follow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742561699.1127458}
