Now, Pyotr Pavlensky, Russia\u2019s     performance artist, has fled to France, where he intends to seek political asylum. Russian authorities questioned Mr. Pavlensky and his partner, Oksana Shalygina, last month after an actress at an   Moscow theater filed a complaint accusing them of sexual assault. The couple deny the allegations, saying that the encounter was a consensual threesome and that the case is politically motivated. Amid the ambiguities  \u2014   and at a time when violence against women is a topic of intense debate in the country  \u2014   Russia\u2019s cultural opposition is now divided over a figure once seen as a symbol of the resistance to President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s Russia. Mr. Pavlensky and Ms. Shalygina have not been formally charged, but were questioned by the police in Moscow on Dec. 15 and informed that they could face up to 10 years in prison. Told not to leave Moscow while the case was pending, they said they saw what was likely to happen and took their daughters, ages 6 and 8, to France over the weekend after spending a month in Ukraine. \u201cWe\u2019ve become victims of this investigation,\u201d Mr. Pavlensky said in an interview on Monday in a Paris cafe, speaking Russian through an interpreter, and with Ms. Shalygina at his side. \u201cIt\u2019s like a horrible dream that you can\u2019t even imagine. \u201d The situation  \u2014   with its charges of a honey trap and \u201ckompromat\u201d (compromising material gathered by the authorities)  \u2014   reflects the climate of suspicion and growing authoritarianism in Russia, where artists like the female punk band Pussy Riot have faced jail, but, for the most part, outright   censorship has given way to artistic   in the face of changing laws and cuts to culture funding. The accusations, however, have prompted even some supporters of Mr. Pavlensky to question his behavior. The theater where the actress works, Teatr. doc, is known for   plays that have criticized and angered the Russian government, and it has supported Mr. Pavlensky in the past. But its leadership has seconded the assault accusations and defended the actress against the couple\u2019s assertions that she was working for the state. This is not the first time Mr. Pavlensky has found himself in the cross hairs of the Russian authorities. Over the years, they have ordered him to undergo a dozen psychiatric evaluations, a technique long used to quash political dissent. In 2014 he chopped off his right earlobe for a piece called \u201cSegregation,\u201d inspired by van Gogh and intended, he said, to show that \u201cpsychiatry is a collection of subjective opinions. \u201d After setting fire to the doors of Lubyanka, the Moscow headquarters of Russia\u2019s infamous security service, in 2015, he served seven months in pretrial detention on charges of vandalism. (He called that action \u201cThreat\u201d and said it was intended to illuminate \u201cwhat people prefer to forget,\u201d that the security apparatus hadn\u2019t changed since Soviet times.) He was released last June with a fine, a move human rights activists said was intended to avoid an international incident of the kind that ensued after members of Pussy Riot were jailed in 2012 on charges of hooliganism for performing an   song in a Moscow church. Soon after, Mr. Pavlensky said, he gave some lectures at Teatr. doc. It was at one of them last September that he met the actress who later filed the assault complaint. Mr. Pavlensky said that on Dec. 4, the actress texted Ms. Shalygina. The couple  \u2014   who say they have an open relationship  \u2014   invited her to their Moscow apartment that evening. \u201cWe talked about art,\u201d he said. \u201cWe sat and drank coffee. We drank Cognac, but not a lot. \u201d \u201cThere was some form of intimacy,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd then she said she wants to leave. We said, \u2018Fine, no problem.\u2019 We parted as friends. \u201d Both Mr. Pavlensky, 32, and Ms. Shalygina, 37, said it was the first time the three had had sex together. Yuri A. Lysenko, a lawyer for the actress, said that Mr. Pavlensky had committed a \u201ccrime,\u201d a rape, and that he wanted to portray the police investigation as politically motivated to avoid punishment. Adding to the confusion over the allegations, this week Teatr. doc posted on its Facebook page a video dated Oct. 31 that it said showed Mr. Pavlensky and others beating up a man they said was the actress\u2019s boyfriend, in the theater\u2019s parking lot. Mr. Pavlensky said that the video was \u201cmurky\u201d and that he didn\u2019t recognize himself in it. But he said he had been involved in a physical altercation with the actress\u2019s boyfriend in October, when he and others confronted the man over allegations that he had beaten her. The Interfax News Agency reported that the police told him that a criminal case had been opened about the fight. Mr. Pavlensky said that was not the case. Mr. Lysenko said the fight with the boyfriend and the sexual assault allegations were \u201cnot related. \u201d He then added: \u201cYou have to ask Mr. Pavlensky if he has seen a psychiatrist recently. What he did is part of his carefully crafted plan to paint his crime in political colors. \u201d In a Facebook post that she said would be her last word on the matter, Yelena Gremina, the director of Teatr. doc, called the couple\u2019s claims that the actress worked for the security services \u201cslander. \u201d On Russia\u2019s vibrant social media, artists are divided over the case. \u201cThe hysteria with Pavlensky is an alarming sign that anyone who becomes a significant \u2018fighter against the regime\u2019 is immediately put on a pedestal and declared a saint,\u201d the artist Lena Hades wrote on Facebook. Others came out against Mr. Pavlensky. \u201cAlas, yesterday a national hero and a great performance artist, today  \u2014   it\u2019s true  \u2014   a criminal, a psychopath and a rapist,\u201d Olga Papernaya, a former art director at a Moscow film club, wrote on Facebook, suggesting that she was friends with the actress. \u201cFor now, the authorities are winning,\u201d Mr. Pavlensky said. The press is weak, he added, and \u201cthe   opposition\u201d divided, even over Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea. \u201cBut each move is not the last,\u201d he said of the country\u2019s situation. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear who will have the last word in this conflict. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564052.0807223}
