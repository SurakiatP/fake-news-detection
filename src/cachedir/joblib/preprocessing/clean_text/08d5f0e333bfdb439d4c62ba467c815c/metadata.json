Now   Donald J. Trump has picked Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon with no housing experience, as his nominee for secretary of Housing and Urban Development  \u2014   and high anxiety has set in. As The Times\u2019s   bureau chief, I have spent a lot of time in Baltimore, Cleveland and Philadelphia, which are all run by Democrats. In those cities, and many others across the country, housing concerns are deeply intertwined with other   issues, including racial tensions with the police. To explore how a   housing agenda might play out, I reached out to two Philadelphia mayors  \u2014   Jim Kenney, the incumbent, and Michael Nutter, his predecessor  \u2014   and two housing experts, one in Philadelphia and one here in Washington. Here are some of their thoughts: Broadly speaking, HUD devotes itself to ensuring that families of   and modest means have access to safe homes and neighborhoods. It runs the Federal Housing Administration, which helps people get home loans. It distributes money through the Community Development Block Grant program, a flexible source of funding used by cities for redevelopment and for rebuilding communities after natural disasters like floods and hurricanes. HUD runs the Section 8 housing choice voucher program, which cities rely on to help house the poor. And it enforces the Fair Housing Act, part of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, which makes housing discrimination illegal. Even in a time of economic expansion, dealing with poverty will be the biggest challenge the next HUD secretary faces, conservative and liberal housing experts agree. The American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research organization, cited housing assistance programs as among those \u201cripe for reform\u2019\u2019 under Mr. Trump. Since 2000, the number of   neighborhoods in America has doubled, rising faster in the suburbs, like Ferguson, Mo. than in cities, said Amy Liu, the director of the Metropolitan Policy Program at the   Brookings Institution in Washington. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of anxiety now, because this election was about the heartland versus the coastal elites we\u2019re going to need a HUD secretary who governs both,\u201d Ms. Liu said. \u201cWhen I think about what HUD is going to have to deal with next, it\u2019s going to be the future of   neighborhoods, and how to deal with that not only in Baltimore but also Ferguson. \u201d Mr. Carson grew up poor in Detroit and became a celebrated neurosurgeon by the time he was in his 30s  \u2014   a path that he attributes to his     philosophy. His admirers praise his    success story. But his critics say a career in medicine is not the right training for someone running a vast federal housing bureaucracy. \u201cHe has a powerful personal story that could connect him to a lot of families that rely on HUD assistance,\u201d Ms. Liu said. \u201cHe just needs to use that personal story to listen and empathize  \u2014   and really learn about the latest innovations in the field. \u2019\u2019 Most HUD secretaries have had government experience. George Romney, who served under Richard M. Nixon, was a governor. Jack Kemp, who served under George Bush, was a congressman. Henry Cisneros, who served under Bill Clinton, was a mayor so was Julian Castro, the current secretary. Ira Goldstein, who worked at HUD under the first President Bush and Mr. Clinton, admired Mr. Kemp. \u201cHe had a way of relating to people at every economic level he could walk into housing developments and be perceived as an ally,\u201d said Mr. Goldstein, who now supervises research at Reinvestment Fund, a nonprofit devoted to redevelopment in Philadelphia and Baltimore. But Mr. Kemp, a conservative, also had the \u201cbusiness discipline,\u201d Mr. Goldstein said, to run HUD programs \u201cwith a businesslike tenor. \u201d Mr. Nutter, who now teaches urban affairs at Columbia University and is a commentator for CNN, says he does not know if Mr. Carson has what it takes. \u201cAs brilliant as folks have said that Dr. Carson is from a neurosurgery standpoint, creating fair housing, promoting economic development and having people living in prospering communities is a little different than operating on somebody\u2019s brain,\u201d Mr. Nutter said. \u201cI do not know how that translates into being HUD secretary. \u2019\u2019 Mr. Trump got rich building luxury properties most mayors are concerned with housing the poor. In the 1970s, before Mr. Trump got into the luxury business, the federal government sued his family\u2019s company, accusing it of routinely refusing to rent to    \u2014   the very discrimination that HUD, through the Fair Housing Act, seeks to prevent. (Mr. Trump\u2019s firm settled without admitting wrongdoing.) Under President Obama, HUD expanded its civil rights reach with the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing Rule, which says that cities must not only respond to bias, but also take steps to prevent it. Philadelphia \u201cwas proud to become the first city\u201d to adopt the rule, said Mayor Kenney, whose administration has just submitted an extensive plan to put the rule into effect. Some conservatives see that rule as federal intrusion into local sovereignty  \u2014   the mayor of Castle Rock, Colo. population 55, 000, has refused to accept HUD funding to avoid having to comply  \u2014   and Mr. Trump is likely to roll it back. Mr. Kenney, in a carefully worded statement, make clear that he would push back against any changes. \u201cWe will continue with our efforts to overcome patterns of segregation, promote fair housing choice and foster inclusive communities,\u201d the statement said. Mr. Goldstein, who was the   director of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity when he was at HUD, worries about something else: If Congress complied, Mr. Trump could use federal budget policy to deprive the agency of funds to enforce   laws. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to say that, given the tenor of the rhetoric, that would be a part of HUD that would not be favored in the new administration,\u201d Mr. Goldstein said. Words matter in politics and policy, and both Mr. Trump and Mr. Carson have made comments that make mayors and housing experts uneasy. Mr. Carson once told a television interviewer that he had risen above his circumstances by realizing that \u201cpoverty is really more of a choice than anything else,\u201d by which he apparently meant that people escape poverty through hard work. That comment, spotlighted in a video   on the Salon website, has dogged the neurosurgeon. So has an opinion piece he wrote in which he described fair housing policy as \u201csocial engineering. \u201d This plays into Mr. Trump\u2019s sweeping declarations about black people living in \u201cinner cities\u201d rife with crime. \u201cI give Trump credit for talking explicitly about the importance of the inner city,\u201d Ms. Liu said, \u201cbut we need to make sure that the policies really do address what is needed there. What we don\u2019t need is just    tactics. \u201d Mr. Nutter, who is   is far more pointed he calls Mr. Trump\u2019s characterizations of cities \u201ca general insult. \u201d Philadelphia built hundreds of affordable housing units using flexible Community Development Block Grant funds while Mr. Nutter was mayor. Most of the money, he said, was spent in   communities. \u201cI\u2019m proud that I had seven years with President Barack Obama, who actually knew about community development because he was a community organizer,\u201d Mr. Nutter said. \u201cTo the Philadelphia city government: Good luck dealing with the Trump administration. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562102.534391}
