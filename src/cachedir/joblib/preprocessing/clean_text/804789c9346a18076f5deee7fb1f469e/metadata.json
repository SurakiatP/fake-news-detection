Here\u2019s what you need to know: \u2022  Russia\u2019s ambassador to Turkey was fatally shot while giving a speech in Ankara, an attack a Russian official characterized as a terror attack. The gunman, described by Turkish officials as a      police officer, shouted \u201cdon\u2019t forget Aleppo, don\u2019t forget Syria! ,\u201d as captured in this video (warning, graphic images). Russia has long backed Syria\u2019s government in that country\u2019s brutal civil war. _____ \u2022 Hours earlier, the United Nations passed a resolution to monitor the evacuation of tens of thousands of civilians from the fallen city of Aleppo. Russia signed on only after a compromise that could allow Syrian soldiers and allied Shiite militias to block the monitors\u2019 access. One of the civilians saved is a    girl whose tweets describing life in wartime have drawn comparisons to Anne Frank. In Iraq, where the urban war against the Islamic State is grinding on, up to one million people are trapped in the city of Mosul, running low on food and water. _____ \u2022 The International Monetary Fund endorsed its leader, Christine Lagarde, despite her conviction in a French court on charges of misusing public funds. The judge declined to impose a fine or jail time. Ms. Lagarde said she would not appeal. Here are the basics of the case, which involved the misuse of public funds when she served as France\u2019s finance minister. _____ \u2022 \u201cI could not think of two more different protagonists in the great drama of U. S.  relations. \u201d The analyst quoted was referring to China\u2019s steely, calculated and scripted president, Xi Jinping, and the brash,   Donald J. Trump, whose election was formally validated amid protests today. The dispute over China\u2019s seizure of U. S. underwater drone this week offers hints at the possibly combustible mix of their different styles in the case of bigger tensions _____ \u2022 Indonesia\u2019s daunting shortage of skilled workers  \u2014   in fields ranging from medical services to agriculture  \u2014   could thwart President Joko Widodo\u2019s ambitious plans to upgrade the country\u2019s outdated infrastructure. \u2022 The founder of Blued, China\u2019s most popular gay dating app, is a former police officer who secretly ran a website for gay people for 16 years. \u2022 Wall Street forecasters are delivering their market predictions for the coming year  \u2014   which our columnist reminds to take with more than a grain of salt. Remember 2008? Stocks were supposed to be great that year.  \u2022 Malaysia\u2019s ringgit hit its lowest level since the Asian financial crisis in 1998. \u2022 The yen recovered against the U. S. dollar as the Bank of Japan upgraded its economic outlook. \u2022 Wall Street was up. Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets. \u2022 Twelve people were killed in Berlin after a truck driver plowed into a Christmas market. [The New York Times] \u2022 Gunmen involved in a terrorist attack in Jordan on Sunday had a stash of weapons, explosives and suicide vests, suggesting plans for more attacks. [The New York Times] \u2022 Australians reported the highest levels of  life satisfaction yet in the 16 years of an annual survey. [Australian Associated Press] \u2022 Thailand is slowly showing signs of moving on after the death of the   king, Bhumibol Adulyadej, and the succession of his son. [The New York Times] \u2022 Norway and China normalized diplomatic and political ties, frozen since 2010 when Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. [The New York Times] \u2022   Chinese tourists are becoming an   force in New York. [The New York Times] \u2022 New legislation in the U. S. is expected to worsen the water wars among farmers, fishing industries and environmentalists. [The Associated Press] \u2022 Cities across eastern China imposed emergency measures over hazardous air pollution. Exposure levels to the most dangerous particles, called PM 2. 5, reached 40 times the recommended threshold in Hebei Province. [South China Morning Post] \u2022 In the Siberian city of Irkutsk, Russia, at least 48 people died after drinking scented bath lotion as a cheap substitute for alcohol. [The New York Times] \u2022 Tokyo estimates that it will cost $3. 2 billion over 30 years to decommission a prototype fast breeder reactor that has been plagued with problems. [Asahi Shimbun] \u2022 The Year in News. The U. S. presidential election and the candidates were popular subjects for Times readers this year, but our   article, like last year, was about love. Here\u2019s the full list  \u2014   with a \u201cno politics\u201d option. \u2022 Pregnancy alters the size and structure of  a woman\u2019s brain in ways that may make it easier to recognize an infant\u2019s needs, researchers say. \u2022 China Machado, the first nonwhite supermodel and an   pioneer who forced the world to rethink what is considered beautiful, died at 86. \u2022 Our Daily 360 video offers a glimpse of reproductions of the prehistoric art in the Lascaux caves in France, circa 15, 000 B. C. The actual caves were closed to the public more than 50 years ago. When is a phone call like a diplomatic life preserver? When you\u2019re Taiwan, and on the other end of the line is   Donald J. Trump, the first American leader to speak to you in 37 years. Above, President Tsai   during the call. \u201cWhen you are small and fighting a much bigger adversary,\u201d a Taiwanese diplomat told The Times a few months ago, \u201cyou had better use your wisdom. \u201d China considers the island, ruled by Nationalists who fled the Communist takeover in 1949, a renegade province. So when the U. S. and China opened diplomatic relations in 1979, the U. S. had to cut off Taiwan. As China\u2019s might and markets grew, most other countries followed suit. Taiwan is now recognized by just 22 countries, mostly tiny island nations in the Caribbean and Pacific swayed by Taipei\u2019s aid packages. Two years ago, a former Guatemalan leader admitted to accepting Taiwanese bribes for diplomatic recognition. Taiwan\u2019s last ally in Europe is the Vatican. But there, too, officials have made overtures toward China, which has a vigorous, if partly underground, Catholic community. For now, Nicaragua remains with Taiwan. But it may sway: A mainland Chinese company has pledged to create a transoceanic shipping route through it, to rival the Panama Canal.
