[House Minority Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( ) Sen. Kamala Harris ( ) DNC Deputy Chairman Keith Ellison, and Gold Star father Khizr Khan were among major Democrat players present who devoted their time on stage to attacking President Trump and showing no signs or efforts to work with the other side.  The event evoked a stirring response from the Republican National Committee. RNC spokesman Michael Ahrens responded to the Democratic lawmakers\u2019 rhetoric and said they were out of touch with millions of everyday Americans who are tired of seeing and hearing divisive politics. \u201cAs they plot their strategy of resistance, Democrats continue to ostracize the millions of Americans who want their representatives to work together, not sit around and come up with ways to say no,\u201d Ahrens said. \u201cTheir allegiance to CAP\u2019s extreme,   policies shows how out of touch Democrats are with   Americans all across the country. \u201d \u201cIt is time to resist. It is time to fight back,\u201d Sen. Warren said from her pulpit at the Four Seasons, where she called for greater campaign finance reform. Rep. Maxine Waters ( ) called, once again, for Trump to be impeached. \u201cMaxine Water was right. You\u2019ve got to impeach him. \u201d Booker, who is seen as a rising star in the Democratic Party, gave a rousing and passionate speech about the struggle Americans in disadvantaged parts of the nation face. He delivered the conference\u2019s closing remarks. However, he also made a push for bigger government and welfare, citing people in his own community in New Jersey who live at or beneath the poverty line and who rely on handouts to afford their next meal. Of the Democrats who spoke, Booker seemed to be the most willing to work with Republicans. He asked the Democrats to focus their attention on their constituents and back away from their incessant attacks on President Trump. \u201cI want to dedicate myself, but we cannot just be a party of resistance. We\u2019ve go to be a party that\u2019s reaffirming the American Dream,\u201d Booker said. \u201cWe can\u2019t just be a party that\u2019s focused on the person in the White House. We\u2019ve got to be focused on those folks in inner cities, in factory towns, in the grassroots of our country. \u201d Khizr Khan told the crowd that had gathered, \u201cMy offer to Donald Trump to read the Constitution remains standing,\u201d referring back to the time he held up a   version of the Constitution at the DNC in July 2016. \u201cOne more time he has proven that he is unfamiliar with the basic tenants of our democracy,\u201d he claimed. After apologizing in advance for possibly raising his voice, Khan said, \u201cMaybe this voice will reach 1600 Pennsylvania even now. \u201d He added, \u201cl am from Charlottesville, Virginia. Charlottesville, Virginia, was declared several months ago by my courageous mayor, Mike Signer, to be the capital of resistance of the United States. \u201d DNC Vice Chair Keith Ellison said, \u201cIf there is one blood bath that we have been suffering in elections, it is secretaries of state. \u201d Ellison then questionably suggested, \u201cDemocratic secretaries of state don\u2019t actually try to favor a party. They just try to make sure there\u2019s a fair election. Republican secretaries of state   \u2026     they absolutely tilt the tables in terms of their side. \u201d Meanwhile, outside of Tuesday\u2019s conference, the divided Democratic Party splintered further as rhetoric from within its own ranks exposed how truly out of touch its leaders are. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel slammed the Democrats in a Politico article, saying they come off as a \u201cparty disdainful of [the middle class].   \u2026     We don\u2019t talk about and fight for the middle class like we are. We believe we\u2019re for them, but they don\u2019t \u2014  if they don\u2019t hear we\u2019re for them, then we got a problem,\u201d Emanuel reportedly said. He added that the Democrats are so   on the narrative surrounding President Donald Trump that they are blinded to what\u2019s actually going on inside their own party. \u201cTalking to ourselves and persuading ourselves,\u201d Emanuel said, \u201cis not going to be the way you get to a majority. \u201d Democrats lashed out at Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) saying he \u201cmade a mockery\u201d of the unity process and blamed him for dividing the party more than before. \u201cThe fact that Tom Perez has given Sanders a platform without Sanders genuinely agreeing to work toward \u2018unity\u2019 has made a mockery of the whole process and literally divided the party more than it was before the tour began,\u201d Markos Moulitsas, the founder of the liberal Daily Kos site, told Politico. \u201cIt has been a disaster. \u201d He added, \u201cYes, Perez and company are clearly afraid of Sanders and his followers, but letting Sanders make a mockery of the party doesn\u2019t exactly help it build in the long haul. \u201d Follow Adelle Nazarian on Facebook and Twitter.'"}, "time": 1742562018.7430418}
