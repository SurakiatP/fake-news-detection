For example, Liptior (atorvastatin), which is used to regulate cholesterol, generates a sales profit of $131 billion with the prescription only costing patients around $2 per day. \\nBut with rare diseases, prices must be kept high in order to keep Big Pharma in business. This means that while those with uncommon illnesses may benefit healthwise from the new measures, their pocketbooks are in for a hit. \\nFor example, the cystic fibrosis drug Kalydeco by Vertex costs individual patients $311,000. \\nGilead\u2019s Sovaldi, used to treat Hepatitis C, cashes in at $84,000 for a paltry 12-week course of medication. \\nAnd Soliris, used to treat rare blood conditions, costs the patient a whopping $400,000 per year. \\nThe list of the 10 most expensive drugs that are currently manufactured are all created to treat \u201corphan\u201d or uncommon illnesses. \\nThanks to these laws that allow Big Pharma to charge these insane amounts of money, they can use those who suffer from rare diseases as their cash cows. \\nDrugs for rare diseases will account for 19% of pharmaceutical branded drug profits by the year 2020.
