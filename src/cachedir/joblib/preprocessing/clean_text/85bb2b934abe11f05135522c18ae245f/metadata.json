A   Christian, who found God in midlife and frequently talked about it. Mitt Romney? A Mormon, the first to clinch his party\u2019s nomination. Now try Donald J. Trump. Or Hillary Clinton. Not so obvious. In this election, the country has paid scant attention to the spiritual life of Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton, a fact reflected in polls that show how little voters know about their faiths. But as we found in the latest episode of The   religion is central to both of their identities  \u2014   though in profoundly different ways. Mr. Trump\u2019s bravado can be traced to what he learned inside Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan, according to Gwenda Blair, the author of \u201cThe Trumps,\u201d a multigenerational portrait of the family, and one of our guests on the show. At the church, a charismatic minister named Norman Vincent Peale preached a theology of positive thinking, the rejection of negative thoughts and relentless  . Sound familiar? \u201cHe was known as God\u2019s salesman, but it was really selling the idea of success,\u201d Ms. Blair says of Dr. Peale. That message seemed to resonate for a young Mr. Trump. \u201cEverything he does is about winning. It\u2019s only about winning and losing  \u2014   those are the only two principles that are involved,\u201d Ms. Blair says. \u201cThat\u2019s a very Norman Vincent Peale notion  \u2014   that notion of success above all. \u201d That\u2019s not the only parallel between the two men. As I told Ms. Blair, I was struck by a word in Dr. Peale\u2019s writings that kept popping up: \u201ctremendous. \u201d We also hear from a man who is intimately familiar with the role of religion in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s life: Burns Strider, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s religious adviser during her first presidential campaign and a friend with whom she has prayed for years. Her family\u2019s devotion to Methodism put her on a path toward public service, Mr. Strider says  \u2014   and instilled a view of religion that elevated action over words and left an already reserved figure disinclined to loudly proclaim her faith. But it has come at a cost: Today, 43 percent of voters don\u2019t think she\u2019s religious. The reality: Mrs. Clinton is far more religious than many understand, and always has been, carrying a Bible in her purse, joining a prayer group in the Senate and making time every day to digest scripture. I asked Mr. Strider about the inherent tension in the Democratic party between the faithful and the secular. \u201cIf you\u2019re honest and if you\u2019re passionate, most folks aren\u2019t going to freak over the fact that your center comes from a relationship with God,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re going to respect you for being honest and passionate about it. I think Hillary herself has more than enough leeway to talk about faith if she wants to. \u201d So why does it feel as if religion has receded into the background in 2016? Jonathan Martin, a national political correspondent at The Times, offers his theory, based on two years of talking to the candidates, religious leaders and voters around the country.
