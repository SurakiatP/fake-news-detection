[The plan is to be implemented in the fall with the start of the new school year.  CAIR has been declared a terrorist organization by the United Arab Emirates, and was named by federal prosecutors as an unindicted   in a Hamas   operation. The school district\u2019s board voted recently to approve the Islamophobia plan it set in motion last summer after a November 2015 recognition of CAIR\u2019s educational work. The April 4 vote was   with one member missing from the meeting, according to the San Diego  . More details are expected to be released before the end of the school year. Staff members and parents will receive letters directing them to resources to learn about Islam and fight discrimination. District executive director of Family and Community Engagement Stan Anjan stated that social studies lessons may feature more on prominent Muslims in history, and how to promote a positive image of Islam according to the Tribune. Discipline for perceived bullying of Muslims is also set to be amended. Executive Director of the San Diego chapter of CAIR, Hanif Mohebi, said upon the recent vote, \u201cIf we do this right, San Diego Unified School District would be the leading school district in the nation to come up with a robust and beautiful   and   program\u201d according to the Tribune report. Last July, San Diego Unified approved creation of an   and   plan with urging from CAIR San Diego. More than 200 members and supporters of the Muslim community were present and cheered upon board members\u2019 passage of the initiative, according to KPBS. Executive director Mohebi used a CAIR study that said it asked students and 55 percent claimed to have been bullied. San Diego Unified School District posted in an online QA on the forthcoming plan: Regarding all students, we work hard to protect students from bullying and discrimination. That is why we recently implemented an online bullying reporting mechanism to allow students to make their voices heard without fear. The closest model for our Islamophobia work is the work we have done within the LGBTQIA community in recent years. That program has assigned staff and serves students and other departments through trainings, curriculum review and other activities. In addition, they help students organize and maintain   Alliance Clubs in many of our schools. Again, our LGBTQIA work is simply a model for the Islamophobia work, and there will obviously be unique situations to address in each community. \u201cCAIR has been very generous with their time, providing advice and guidance to the district on ways to prevent bullying against Muslim students. They have not been paid, nor are they under contract with the district,\u201d the school district website states. The district specifically addressed whether it is implementing Sharia Law, claiming that they are not. The district goes on to state that it is not violating separation of church and state and is not endorsing Islam. In regards to creating safe spaces for Muslim students, the district states: \u201cSchools with large Muslim communities may choose to make areas available for prayer, if that is requested by their parents and students. \u201d In 2007, the   reported on allegations that a school aide at Carver Elementary led Muslim students in prayer, according to an online post on Michelle Malkin\u2019s website. (A link to the original Tribune article went to the paper\u2019s website, but the article appears to no longer be at that web address.) The school had recently added Arabic to its curriculum to accommodate in influx of Somali Muslim students. In March 2016, San Diego Unified highlighted the creation of halal meals at Crawford High School, \u201caccording to Islamic law and traditions,\u201d and with the input of students. The school is located in an area of San Diego heavily populated with Muslim refugees. CAIR has previously promoted plans for the halal meals. In an interview with PRI, the San Diego school district\u2019s head of food services cited the success of halal options in Dearborn, Michigan schools, home to one of the largest Muslim populations in the U. S. The report noted that almost all of the students at the City Heights school, at least a decade ago, were recipients of free school lunch. The report added that five local elementary schools had also recently adopted similar halal meal programs. CAIR San Diego lauded SDUSD\u2019s initiative to \u201ccombat Islamophobia\u201d in an announcement that noted, \u201cSome 150 members of San Diego\u2019s Muslim community were present\u201d during the early April passage of the initiative. The group also stated that SDUSD collaborated with   Diego, in line with California\u2019s AB 2845, the Safe Place to Learn Act.   Diego Executive Director Hanif Mohebi said, \u201cOther school districts should follow this lead, and we will be happy to work with them to provide resources and trainings. \u201d Photo: File, Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana '"}, "time": 1742563538.015293}
