The only problem with this argument is that, as with all photographs up to the second decade of 1900\u2019s, there are rarely any Muslims or mosques to be found on any photographs. The only mosque \u2013 and a confiscated synagogue converted after Muslim invasion is the Temple Mount\u2019s Dome of the Rock \u2013 and it stands empty of Muslims in ALL pictures through the 1800\u2019s and early 1900\u2019s, demonstrating the falsity in the Palestinian argument. There are more evidence and remains of the massacres Muslims caused on Christians, than any living signs of Muslims themselves. In comparison, other towns with a living Muslim population documented in photographs during the mid and late 1800\u2019s always feature a lot of mosques. \\n.
