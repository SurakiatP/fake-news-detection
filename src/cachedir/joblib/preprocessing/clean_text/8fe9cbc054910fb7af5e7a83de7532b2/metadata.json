Except, this time, the hysteria has reached such a fever pitch, and the conspiracy theories are so unhinged, that the political discourse in this country will be poisoned for years to come. \\nIt started with Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), who told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer: \\n\u201cSo the question is: Where did these [emails] come from? How did they get to the FBI? Is Russia involved in this? We don\u2019t have a clue where this stuff is coming from.\u201d \\nWe don\u2019t know if Ryan was drunk ( again ) when he said this, but his nickname of \u201c Congressman Moonbeam \u201d seems well-earned, and the implication of his remarks \u2013 that the FBI is in league with the Russians \u2013 underscores his marginality. However, it wasn\u2019t long before the marginal started merging with the mainstream. In tandem with Rya, Howard Dean, former presidential candidate and once head of the Democratic party, tweeted : \\n\u201cIronically, Comey put himself on the same side as Putin.\u201d \\nNow Dean may be a bit more credible than Ryan, but who can forget the \u201c Dean scream \u201d that dramatized his loonier side, and effectively knocked him out of contention for the Democratic presidential nomination? And then there were those payments from the Mujahideen-e-Khalq , a nutty Marxist-Islamist cult, in return for serving as their front man. And so while Dean may be better known, what he\u2019s know for isn\u2019t exactly adding to his credibility, and so we can safely relegate this kind of conspiracy theorizing to the fringes of the Democratic party spectrum. Right? \\nWrong. Here is longtime Clintonite strategist James Carville opining that \u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented \u2026 the House Republicans and the KGB are trying to influence our democracy.\u201d Well, okay, who listens to Carville, anyway? He\u2019s so yester day! Well, then, get a load of Harry Reid, who leads the Senate\u2019s Democrats, repeating a different version of the same nonsense in a letter to Comey : \\n\"In my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government \u2013 a foreign interest hostile to the united states, which Trump praises at every opportunity. The public has a right to know this information. I wrote to you months ago calling for this information to be released to the public. There is no danger to American interests from releasing it. And yet, you continue to resist calls to inform the public of this critical information.\" \\nIt\u2019s so \u201cexplosive\u201d that it exploded into utter nothingness, according to the New York Times this [Tuesday] morning: \\n\u201cFor much of the summer, the F.B.I. pursued a widening investigation into a Russian role in the American presidential campaign. Agents scrutinized advisers close to Donald J. Trump, looked for financial connections with Russian financial figures, searched for those involved in hacking the computers of Democrats, and even chased a lead \u2013 which they ultimately came to doubt \u2013 about a possible secret channel of email communication from the Trump Organization to a Russian bank. \\n\u201cLaw enforcement officials say that none of the investigations so far have found any conclusive or direct link between Mr. Trump and the Russian government. And even the hacking into Democratic emails, FBI and intelligence officials now believe, was aimed at disrupting the presidential election rather than electing Mr. Trump.\u201d \\nAs Gertrude Stein once put it, \u201cThere\u2019s no there there.\u201d She was talking about Oakland, California, but might just as well have been describing the inside of Harry\u2019s brain. \\nAnd, yes, you read the above cited Times story right: instead of going after terrorists, or ordinary criminals, for months the FBI has been chasing down rabbit holes looking for Trump\u2019s alleged links to the nonexistent International Kremlin/Alt-Right/Putinist Conspiracy. We have returned to the halcyon days of J. Edgar Hoover, when people were investigated and harassed for their political views at the instigation of their ideological opponents. \\nOh, but the FBI was too \u201c overburdened and undermanned \u201d to keep Omar Mateen on their radar. \\nIn this election, the tragic and the comic mix and merge, but surely the former is dominant in the latest of Franklin Foer\u2019s Russophobic effusions. Formerly the editor of The New Republic , who was unceremoniously dumped by its new owner, Foer has teamed up with the Clinton campaign as its unofficial conspiracy theorist, spinning tales of Trump\u2019s \u201clinks\u201d to the Russians. He\u2019s the Alex Jones of the Clinton crowd, except that not even Jones would be caught dead promoting the kind of incoherent nonsense in Foer\u2019s latest screed . \\nAccording to Foer, Trump has a \u201csecret server\u201d set up specifically to communicate with his Kremlin Masters. We know this because a \u201ccomputer scientist\u201d who wants to be known only as \u201cTea Leaves,\u201d and other \u201cexperts\u201d \u2013 who also don\u2019t want to tell us their names \u2013 have supposedly \u201cdiscovered\u201d this Secret Link. The server connects to the Alfa Bank, which is located in \u2013 cue in scary music \u2013 Russia! And guess what!? This closed communication link was especially active during politically sensitive times! This, according to Foer and his anonymous band of \u201cexperts,\u201d is conclusive proof that The Donald is a secret agent of the KGB, intent on polluting our precious bodily fluids with icky Russian cooties. \\nThe only problem with this wacky conspiracy theory is that there\u2019s a prosaic explanation for the existence of this \u201csuspicious\u201d online traffic: the Trump Organization had hired a company to send out ads for their hotels. The online traffic to Alfa Bank meant only that several employees of that bank had stayed in Trump\u2019s hotels and were being solicited to do so again. And in spite of the \u201cscientific\u201d-looking chart displayed in the Foer piece, in fact the online traffic to and from Alfa didn\u2019t \u201cpeak\u201d when the US political scene got hot: \u201cThat\u2019s wrong,\u201d writes Timothy B. Lee in the anti-Trump pro-Hillary Vox.com. \u201cIf anything, the chart shows the opposite of that.\u201d \\nAs Lee puts it: \\n\u201c Foer claims that the pattern of traffic between the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank servers is highly unusual \u2013 so unusual that it can best be explained as a secretive communication link between Donald Trump and the Kremlin. \\n\u201cBut in this case, there seems to be a plausible and perfectly innocent explanation for the traffic pattern suggested by an IT consultant named Naadir Jeewa and endorsed by security expert Robert Graham : The Trump organization is sending out promotional emails about Trump hotels, and one or more Alfa Bank employees is on the recipient list. \\n\u201cThis is actually the explanation that\u2019s suggested by Occam\u2019s razor because \u2013 as Foer himself acknowledges in his story \u2013 the server was originally registered by an email marketing firm called Cendyn. The Trump organization seems to have hired Cendyn to send out emails promoting Trump\u2019s hotels, a service Cendyn has been providing since the Trump server was registered in 2009. So the most obvious explanation for the traffic is that Cendyn is using its server for its intended purpose.\u201d \\nWhen Hillary Clinton\u2019s Twitter account tweeted Foer\u2019s farrago and declared \u201cIt\u2019s time for Trump to answer serious questions about his ties to Russia,\u201d cyber-security expert Robert Graham replied on his blog : \\n\u201cThis is nonsense. The evidence available on the Internet is that Trump neither (directly) controls the domain \"trump-email.com,\" nor has access to the server. Instead, the domain was setup and controlled by Cendyn, a company that does marketing/promotions for hotels, including many of Trump\u2019s hotels. Cendyn outsources the email portions of its campaigns to a company called Listrak, which actually owns/operates the physical server in a data center in Philadelphia.\u201d \\nSo the server wasn\u2019t even owned by the Trump Organization . And yet it took the FBI months, and \u201cjournalists,\u201d including even The Intercept , \u201cweeks\u201d to conclude that this story is completely bogus. The US taxpayers should demand their money back \u2013 not to mention Pierre Omidyar . \\nEven after this sloppy McCarthyite smear was debunked, the Clinton campaign breathlessly repeated the charges: \u201cThis secret hotline may be the key to unlocking the mystery of Trump\u2019s ties to Russia\u201d! What this perfervid fantasy is the actually key to is the hysterical desperation of the Clinton campaign as it is engulfed in daily scandals that threaten to sink it beneath the electoral waves. \\nAre you laughing \u2013 or crying \u2013 yet? Oh, but I\u2019m not done! If you think this grade-B conspiracy theory is the lowest form of electoral entertainment, then you obviously haven\u2019t read David Corn\u2019s latest entry into the Smear Trump Sweepstakes. Glenn Greenwald \u2013 no friend of Trump\u2019s \u2013 describes it as \u201can unnamed person, from an unknown country, who used to work in an unnamed agency, claims Trump is a Russian agent.\u201d How did the real estate mogul become a tool of the Kremlin? Well, you see, Trump once traveled to Russia, where he was suborned by one of those slinky-looking Russian ladies and \u201cRussian intelligence had \u2018compromised\u2019 Trump during his visits to Moscow and could \u2018blackmail him.\u2019\u201d \\nYes, they\u2019re blackmailing Trump over a sexual indiscretion \u2013 because that would destroy him for sure ! And it\u2019s all in a \u201csecret memo\u201d that only Corn, the editors of Mother Jones , and their Mysterious Veteran Spook have seen. \\nOn one level, this is hysterically funny; it\u2019s grade-C thriller material that is likely to be found at the bottom of some publisher\u2019s slush pile. On another level \u2013 the political level \u2013 it is immensely depressingly significant \u2013 because these people are \u201cliberals,\u201d even \u201cleftists.\u201d They aren\u2019t stupid: they know the ignominious history of witch-hunting in this country. I\u2019d call this McCarthyism \u2013 but even Joe McCarthy had some actual evidence to back up his claims of \u201cforeign agents\u201d lurking in the corridors of power. Corn, Foer, and the Clinton campaign are simply retailing lies. \\nWhat\u2019s depressing about this is the fact that, if Hillary wins, it isn\u2019t going to stop. Far from it: the new \u201cred scare\u201d will accelerate, as her political enemies are tarred with the \u201cKGB agent\u201d brush. And when the notoriously vindictive Democratic candidate takes revenge not only on her domestic political enemies, but on the Russians, an ugly \u2013 and dangerous \u2013 confrontation is in the cards. She\u2019ll sic the FBI on Trump\u2019s supporters, and Trump himself, and she\u2019ll unleash the US military and our allies on Putin \u2013 and then, watch out. \\nThat American liberalism has degenerated into a Russophobic, warmongering, witch-hunting ideology so quickly is one of the most astonishing ideological transformations in our political history. And all in the name of garnering partisan political advantage. As Donald Trump would put it: Sad! \\nNOTES IN THE MARGIN \\nYou can check out my Twitter feed by going here .
