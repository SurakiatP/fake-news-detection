Norman Steele, who won \u00a3500 after splitting his prize with workmate Tom Booker, will even keep his current job as a postman. He said: \u201cI could have earned a million pounds on some fancy ITV game show, but doing it on the BBC means so much more. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m going to spend, spend, spend, mainly on a return train journey to Manchester. \u201cIt\u2019ll be cab there and cab home, which will set me back another \u00a375, and, of course, a slap up, three-course meal for two at Pizza Express with several glasses of house white. \u201cOn the way home, I\u2019ll visit our local and buy a pint for all the regulars. No crisps, mind, I don\u2019t want them to get ideas. \u201cThen I\u2019ll go home, have a bath and think about how I\u2019m going to spend my remaining \u00a33.73.\u201d \\nShare:'"}, "time": 1742562579.0698216}
