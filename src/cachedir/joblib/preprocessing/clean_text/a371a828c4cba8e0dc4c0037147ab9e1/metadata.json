[\u201cI\u2019m disappointed that this man is representing me and my country,\u201d Letterman said in an interview with GQ magazine this week. \u201cIt makes me sick. \u201d  The former late night mainstay, who retired from CBS\u2019 Late Show in 2015 after 33 years of hosting, said there is \u201cno reason to regret\u201d having Trump on his show as often as he did. \u201cHe was just a big, wealthy dope who\u2019d come on and we would make fun of his hair. I would refer to him as a slumlord,\u201d he said. One month before Election Day, Letterman called Trump a \u201cdamaged human being\u201d who should be \u201cshunned. \u201d In March, Letterman said the president is \u201cinsulting to America. \u201d Doubling down on personal insults, Letterman now says Trump is a soulless \u201cgoon. \u201d \u201cBut now, this goon  \u2026     I don\u2019t know,\u201d the    comedian told GQ. \u201cHe\u2019s demonstrated himself to be a man without a core, a man without a soul. Is there a guy in there?\u201d Acknowledging that he would like to interview Trump once more, Letterman said he just wants to ask the president a single question. \u201cI would love to have 90 minutes with him in a TV studio, just to talk to the guy,\u201d he said. \u201cI would just like to say, \u2018All right, Don: What the f*ck happened? \u2019\u201d   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson'"}, "time": 1742561772.0538728}
