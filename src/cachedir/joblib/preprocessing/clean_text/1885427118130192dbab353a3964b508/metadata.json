Trump, according to an interview released Monday with David Axelrod, his friend and former adviser. \u201cI\u2019m confident that if I  \u2014   if I had run again and articulated it, I think I could\u2019ve mobilized a majority of the American people to rally behind it,\u201d Mr. Obama said on Mr. Axelrod\u2019s podcast, \u201cThe Axe Files,\u201d referring to his message of inclusion and helping   Americans. \u201cI know that in conversations that I\u2019ve had with people around the country, even some people who disagreed with me, they would say the vision, the direction that you point towards is the right one,\u201d he said. Several hours after the interview was posted, Mr. Trump responded on Twitter. \u201cPresident Obama said that he thinks he would have won against me,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cHe should say that but I say NO WAY!  \u2014   jobs leaving, ISIS, OCare, etc. \u201d The discussion in the interview was pure political conjecture, because the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution limits a president to two terms. Mr. Obama praised the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, saying that she performed well under difficult circumstances and that there \u201cwas a double standard with her. \u201d \u201cFor whatever reason, there\u2019s been a longstanding difficulty in her relationship with the press that meant her flaws were wildly amplified,\u201d he said. But Mr. Obama also said she campaigned too cautiously. \u201cIf you think you\u2019re winning, then you have a tendency, just like in sports, maybe to play it safer,\u201d Mr. Obama said. He added: \u201cAnd the economy has been improving. There is a sense, obviously, that some communities have been left behind from the recovery and people feeling anxious about that. \u201d It was \u201cnonsense,\u201d Mr. Obama said, that Democrats had abandoned white   Americans, who rallied to Mr. Trump. \u201cLook, the Affordable Care Act benefits a huge number of Trump voters,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThere are a lot of folks in places like West Virginia or Kentucky who didn\u2019t vote for Hillary, didn\u2019t vote for me, but are being helped by this. \u201d The problem, Mr. Obama said, was that Democratic politicians were not communicating to these people \u201cthat we understand why they\u2019re frustrated. \u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not there on the ground communicating not only the dry policy aspects of this, but that we care about these communities, that we\u2019re bleeding for these communities,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThere\u2019s an emotional connection, and part of what we have to do to rebuild is to be there,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that means organizing, that means caring about state parties, it means caring about local races, state boards or school boards and city councils and state legislative races, and not thinking that somehow, just a great set of progressive policies that we present to the New York Times editorial board will win the day. \u201d In a telephone interview on Monday, Mr. Axelrod, now a commentator on CNN, said it was his sense that Mr. Obama was \u201cfrustrated\u201d that his presidency is ending when his party has sustained such a dramatic loss. \u201cHe believes the momentum is still on his side in the long term,\u201d Mr. Axelrod said. \u201cHe\u2019s always been a guy who thinks long term and has an amazing ability to do that. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564506.8607488}
