It\u2019s the reality show version of your family. When you return from your holiday visit, you may be exhausted for days afterward, finding it hard to focus and return to your regular routine. It feels as if you took the   from Phoenix, but in reality it was a quick   flight from Cleveland. This is family jet lag. As with traditional jet lag, the problem is the result of a disruption of your normal routine. Family jet lag works both ways, affecting both travelers and those who receive    relatives. It\u2019s not that you don\u2019t want to see your family, but the fact that you see them in person only once or twice a year means that you have a limited opportunity to discuss difficult issues best dealt with   . It\u2019s more than just the tryptophan, two kinds of potatoes and three kinds of pie that wear you out during family celebrations. According to Dr. Adam Fried, a clinical psychologist in Scottsdale, Ariz. the connection between emotional stress and physical exhaustion is not in your head. \u201cMany times we may not even realize the level of our anxiety  \u2014   or the resulting consequences, like extreme fatigue  \u2014   until well after the event has passed,\u201d he explained. Only adding tension is the fact that for people who have to travel to spend time with their family, this typically means using precious, limited vacation days. Again, it\u2019s not that we don\u2019t want to use our time off to see our family, but given the fact that the trip can be tiring, doing so in lieu of a vacation hits hard. Dr. Fried said many clients describe their family jet lag and holiday stress as \u201can overwhelming,     sense of dread and avoidance,\u201d and the first step is to identify what, specifically, about the holidays is stressful. \u201cFor some, it\u2019s the pressure  \u2014   whether consciously or not  \u2014   felt by many to create what they believe to be the \u2018perfect\u2019 holiday experience,\u201d he explained. Some believe that they have to make every aspect of their family celebrations conform to their preconceived notion of what the \u201cperfect\u201d holiday experience entails, Dr. Fried said. And the divisive presidential election didn\u2019t help, adding an extra sprinkle of tension to families that include both Trump and Clinton voters. So how is it possible to not only survive the holidays this year with your family, but enjoy them? Dr. Fried emphasized that different strategies like daily mindfulness and meditation techniques may provide relief for some, while for others,   strategies, exercise or pharmacological interventions may be most effective. Specifically, he suggested thoughtful planning well before the family gathering, including establishing rules  \u2014   that you may or may not communicate to your family  \u2014   of how you will handle potentially   interactions. It may also help to inform your family that certain topics are absolutely \u201c \u201d for discussion throughout the trip (see: picks for the incoming cabinet positions, your lack of a spouse and children, whether or not there should be sour cream in mashed potatoes). Of course, all the thoughtful planning in the world will not always cut it. \u201cOften it\u2019s easiest just to fall into the same patterns of interacting with family, even if these are emotionally destructive,\u201d Dr. Fried said. \u201cIndeed, the hardest part can be establishing  \u2014   and sticking to  \u2014   new responses and behaviors. \u201d And like traditional jet lag, family jet lag can also have a big impact on your sleep, said Dr. Dion Metzger, a psychiatrist and sleep expert based in Atlanta. \u201cDuring holiday travel, it is so easy to start sacrificing hours of sleep to get that   packing in, rise before the sun for that 6 a. m. flight or even just to have a late night catching up with loved ones,\u201d Dr. Metzger explained. \u201cThose lost hours of sleep will have our bodies (and minds) running on fumes before dinnertime. \u201d Disrupted sleep patterns also make us prone to reduce normal activity levels and gain weight, according to Dr. Richard Rose, chief executive of Sommetrics, a company focused on sleep quality. \u201cOur sense of   is diminished,\u201d he said. The decreased sleep time and quality results in irritability, problems concentrating, anxiety and even sad feelings for some, Dr. Metzger noted. \u201cHolidays are already hectic and can be particularly emotional for some  \u2014   especially those dealing with loss. \u201d Despite the festive chaos, there are steps you can take to improve your sleep  \u2014   and ideally, your overall experience  \u2014   while you\u2019re traveling to visit family. The first is not to be afraid to ask for help. \u201cYou have made it to your family\u2019s house for the holiday and they\u2019re so excited to see your kids. Now use that support, hand those kids over and get some more rest,\u201d Dr. Metzger suggested. Dr. Fried suggested establishing firm departure dates and not being afraid to stay in a hotel if it provides the respite you need. Dr. Metzger\u2019s final tip is probably the hardest: Learning to say no. \u201cOnly say yes to things that fit into your schedule with the rest you need,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t do everything. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562072.5844321}
