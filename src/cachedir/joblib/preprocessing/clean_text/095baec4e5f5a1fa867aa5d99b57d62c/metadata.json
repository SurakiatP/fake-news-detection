[From The Hill:  The Breitbartization of the White House comes as no surprise to people at the conservative news site. \u201cI\u2019m surprised it took this long,\u201d one Breitbart reporter told The Hill  \u2026     \u201cThese two are ideologically in line with Bannon. They\u2019re people he can trust. It makes sense. \u201d   \u2026     Hahn, 25, is said to be a favorite of both Bannon and Trump\u2019s senior adviser for policy, Stephen Miller, a veteran of the campaign and attorney general nominee Sen. Jeff Sessions\u2019s ( .) office.   \u2026     Gorka\u2019s primary focus at Breitbart has been the threat of radical Islam. He has been a fierce critic of what he describes as the Obama administration\u2019s weak response to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and other international terror groups.   \u2026     Now, Hahn and Gorka will add to Bannon\u2019s stable of trusted allies in the West Wing, although one source familiar with Bannon\u2019s thinking dismissed the notion that he is staffing up for a fight.   \u2026     Breitbart News Editor Alexander Marlow also commented on the recent acquisitions of John Carney from the Wall Street Journal, Sam Chi from RealClear Politics, and Kristina Wong from The Hill: \u201cThere will always be this \u2018Fight Club\u2019 element where we look to punch the establishment when they deserve it,\u201d Marlow said. \u201cBut we have a lot of reporting to do and will recruit and hire the most   and sophisticated and sharpest minds in Washington to build the best team, period. We\u2019re not going to follow any prescription that the media wants. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563710.3288512}
