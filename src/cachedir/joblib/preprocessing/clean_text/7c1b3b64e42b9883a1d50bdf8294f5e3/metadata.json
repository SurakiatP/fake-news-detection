A. men\u2019s basketball tournament as an   analyst, she said, \u201cYes, of course. \u201d How could she not be? After 29 years as a sideline reporter and analyst at hundreds of games, after thousands of miles traveling and thousands of hours studying teams and plays and players, Antonelli, 52, was being asked  \u2014   finally  \u2014   to be a leading voice at what she considers basketball\u2019s Super Bowl. Her husband, Frank, congratulated her. Her three sons were excited, too. \u201cMy sons said a few \u2018wows\u2019 and \u2018Ooh, I hope you get this team and that team,\u2019\u201d Antonelli said Wednesday in a phone call from the   line at her youngest sons\u2019 high school. \u201cBut my coolness factor lasted about three minutes. \u201d I like the way her sons think. In 2017, why must it be news that a woman like Antonelli, who has worked men\u2019s games since the   was chosen as a broadcaster for two rounds of men\u2019s N. C. A. A. tournament games? Women have broadcast   men\u2019s games for years. Doris Burke, who calls N. B. A. games for ESPN and ABC, has been a staple of broadcast coverage for two decades, and Jessica Mendoza, the Olympic softball player, has had a leading role in ESPN\u2019s baseball coverage since 2015. In 2015, Beth Mowins, who had called college football games for years, became the second woman to work as a    announcer for an N. F. L. game. What makes Antonelli\u2019s recent hiring remarkable, though, is just how long it has been since the last woman, Ann Meyers Drysdale, worked on an N. C. A. A. men\u2019s tournament broadcast. Meyers Drysdale helped call two rounds  \u2014   in 1995. I asked Antonelli about that yawning gap, and she couldn\u2019t explain it, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t have the answer for that. \u201d I asked Meyers Drysdale about it, too, and she was just as perplexed. \u201cTo me, gender is not that big a deal,\u201d she said. \u201cA    is a   . There are plenty of people qualified to call the game, and plenty of them are women. \u201cYou might want to ask who\u2019s in charge of the hiring. \u201d So I called Sean McManus, the chairman of CBS Sports, and did just that. \u201cI don\u2019t really know the answer to that question,\u201d he admitted, \u201cexcept probably it was easy to keep assigning the cast of regulars to the tournament. It just wasn\u2019t on our radar screen. \u201d The thing is, McManus said he had watched and admired Antonelli, who is under contract with ESPN, for so many years that he couldn\u2019t pinpoint the date when he had first noticed her. And when, he said, someone at CBS brought up her name this year  \u2014   along with the idea to use her broad expertise in an analyst\u2019s role, rather than for infrequent hits as a sideline reporter  \u2014   the group decided, \u201cBoy, that\u2019s a \u201d But if it was a   why did two decades go by without someone thinking of hiring her? It could be, McManus said, that Antonelli works for ESPN, and CBS Sports didn\u2019t think it could hire her away for the tournament, which the network ended up doing quite easily this year. Or, he said, it was \u201cprobably just an oversight and a little bit of a lack of creativity, perhaps. \u201d McManus was clear that Antonelli had finally been hired because of her expertise, because of her reputation for preparation and good work  \u2014   and not because she is a woman. Antonelli knows that her big chance will come with   pressure to succeed, in terms of her getting another shot, and for all women who want to be treated equally in roles that remain, to many, male domains. \u201cThere\u2019s no margin for error if you hear a woman\u2019s voice during a broadcast,\u201d Antonelli acknowledged. \u201cIf you make a mistake, they\u2019ll say, \u2018It figures.\u2019 And they will blame it on me being a woman. \u201d Antonelli tries not to think about that. Instead, she thinks about basketball. A North Carolina native and   starter on N. C. State\u2019s team, she began her broadcasting career calling Ohio State women\u2019s games. And from there, she never stopped. Dayton\u2019s men. Missouri Valley Conference contests. Her Twitter bio reads like a bowl of alphabet soup: The W. N. B. A. CBS. ESPN. Raycom. She has called the Women\u2019s Final Four on radio and worked the A. C. C. men\u2019s tourney on television. One thing she has not done, though, is dwell on being a woman in sports. \u201cI know this is a big issue for women, for me to work these games, and I think it\u2019s a sad state of affairs that this is the case,\u201d she said. \u201cJust look at the generations of girls who have played this game and how far they have come. But this is still an issue? I don\u2019t even think about the woman part of it. I think about being an athlete. \u201d Also on her mind: doing the job well. When CBS Sports announced that Antonelli would join its broadcasting team, she was in her car, trying to focus on the two games she would be working that night at the A. C. C. women\u2019s tournament in Conway, S. C. Texts, phone calls and emails poured in, all offering congratulations. Antonelli marked the moment in a familiar way: She drove straight to a Waffle House and ordered her usual: a bacon, egg and cheese sandwich, with a cup of coffee. She will get her assignments after the bracket is filled on Sunday. Until then, Antonelli has no time to waste, no time to debate critics on Twitter, no time to pat herself on the back for breaking into a man\u2019s realm. No time, because she has work to do.'"}, "time": 1742562067.3632677}
