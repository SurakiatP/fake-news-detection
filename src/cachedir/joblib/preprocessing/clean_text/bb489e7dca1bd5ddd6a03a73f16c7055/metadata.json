Many wedding guests this summer may glimpse sneakers under traditional gowns. And not just plain white tennis shoes. Some are brightly colored, others are embroidered with names and dates, or decorated with beading or lace to match the dress. Ronnie Rothstein, an owner of Kleinfeld Bridal in New York, thinks the bridal sneaker is not so much a fashion statement as a lifestyle statement, with fashion in general being more casual these days. And pairing sneakers with wedding dresses fits with the overall easing of dress codes, at work and at leisure. Millennial women in particular are about comfort. \u201cIf a girl wears jeans to work, she\u2019s wearing sneakers to the wedding,\u201d Mr. Rothstein said. The fashion industry is helping by making sneakers as glamorous as possible. At a Karl Lagerfeld 2014 haute couture collection, a model wore white running shoes with a bridal gown. Now brides have an expanding choice of comfortable yet stylish sneakers from sources like Etsy, Bill Blass online, Keds and Converse. Tory Burch is also showing   sneakers, and there are   Chuck Taylors, if the bride is looking for height, said Cathy Schroeckenstein, the editor in chief of weddingbee. com. \u201cYou have to assume you\u2019ll be on your feet for 12 to 15 hours on your wedding day,\u201d Ms. Schroeckenstein said, and \u201cmost women are not comfortable in high heels. \u201d Mr. Rothstein said that in his workrooms, 17 people bead dresses and now also embellish many pairs of sneakers each week with beads or lace to match the gowns. \u201cIf the dress is heavily embellished, the sneakers get the same embellishment,\u201d he said. In 2012, when Cassandra Arellano was married in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif. \u201cI really thought I would wear gorgeous heels, and since I was engaged for two years I had plenty of time to search for them,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t find the right ones, and then I thought anyway they would kill my feet. So I said, forget it. How cute would it be if I wore purple Converse sneakers?\u201d Mrs. Arellano ordered her shoes online from Converse. She said that the 100 guests couldn\u2019t see them under her long dress until she got onto the dance floor and showed off her footwear. Jennifer Contreras was wearing customized Converse sneakers when she was married in June 2014 in San Diego. \u201cI wanted to be comfortable,\u201d she said, something her mother was all for. The shoes were hidden under her dress at first. \u201cNo one sees your shoes until you show them off,\u201d she said. \u201dThe back of my shoes was embroidered with \u2018Mrs. Contreras. \u2019\u201d All of her bridesmaids wore gray Converses. And the groom wore sneakers from Vans. \u201cMy husband isn\u2019t super tall, and in heels I am taller than he is,\u201d she said. But for Randy Fenoli, a host on the TLC show \u201cSay Yes to The Dress,\u201d a pair of sneakers with a wedding dress is appalling. \u201cThey depreciate your look and the look of the gown,\u201d he said. \u201cWedding gowns are not for comfort. PJs are for comfort, sweatsuits are for comfort. Sneakers are a  . \u201d \u201cWalking in heels is so much sexier,\u201d he said. \u201cSneakers make you walk flat. Call me  . I\u2019m a traditionalist. At some point you just have to say no. \u201d Marshall Cohen, the chief retail market research analyst with the NPD Group, disagreed. \u201cIt\u2019s about, \u2018This is my day,\u2019\u201d Mr. Cohen said, speaking for the brides. Lisa Blanck wore heels down the aisle when she was married two years ago in Detroit, just to feel like a lady, she said. But right after the ceremony, she changed into blue Nike sneakers that her husband, Peter Ehrlich, had bought for her. The invitation called for black tie, but she wasn\u2019t the only one dancing in comfortable shoes. Her mother, her father, his groomsmen and even their cantor all wore sneakers at the insistence of the bridal couple. Before the wedding, Mr. Ehrlich, who collects Nike sneakers as a hobby, had sent an email to their friends that read, \u201cNikes welcome. \u201d Converse, Keds or Nikes are reasonably priced, but there are few limits on what a bride can choose to spend on personalized sneakers. At Kleinfeld Bridal,   customized sneakers that coordinate with a Mark Zunino gown can cost up to $800. But, Mr. Rothstein said, if the dress costs thousands of dollars, spending hundreds on the shoes is just part of the package. Mr. Zunino, who has a line of dresses at Kleinfeld, said, \u201cGirls are used to wearing sneakers all the time now. \u201d Keds offers two lines of bridal sneakers. \u201cWe launched the lines because of customer interest,\u201d said Emily Culp, the chief marketing officer at Keds. \u201cOur custom line can be personalized with initials and dates. \u201d Some women are ordering complete sets of custom shoes for themselves and their bridesmaids, Ms. Culp said. And sometimes the sneakers are coordinated with the color of the flowers. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those moments when people want to show their individuality and moxie,\u201d Ms. Culp said. \u201cIt gives them a feeling of empowerment. It\u2019s about expressing who you are. \u201d Mothers of some brides are not on board with this look. When Chantalle Crolly, a kindergarten teacher and graphic designer in Ontario, Canada, was married in a backyard there in July 2015, she said, her own mother had a hard time with the nontraditional elements of the wedding  \u2014   like her shoes. \u201cI wore a big custom ball gown with sneakers,\u201d she said. She had her married name embroidered on the back of her fluorescent pink Converses. \u201cThey were bright and happy and comfortable,\u201d Ms. Crolly said. She admitted to being influenced by a lot of what she sees on Pinterest and other websites, and agreed that there is a generational shift at work here. \u201cI rely 100 percent on social media,\u201d she said, referring to her personal style. Sandra Corona has an Etsy shop called NewBrideCo, where she sells embellished sneakers. \u201cIt\u2019s usually the     and they want to enjoy every moment,\u201d Ms. Corona said, pointing out that brides don\u2019t want their day ruined by sore feet. Darcy Miller, an editor at large of Martha Stewart Weddings, said: \u201cSome brides don\u2019t necessarily want to be wearing stilettos on the beach or on soft grass. They want to be comfortable for all that running around  \u2014   and dancing, of course. Brides are always wanting to put their personal stamp on their wedding and showing their personal style, so here\u2019s an opportunity to do that. \u201d Ms. Miller said that sometimes brides use the sneakers to tie a theme together by having the rest of the wedding party wear pairs in a certain color while hers are white or a bright color to flash under her dress. And,   scenario, if the bride is of the runaway variety, at least she\u2019ll have the aprropriate footwear.'"}, "time": 1742561961.4075472}
