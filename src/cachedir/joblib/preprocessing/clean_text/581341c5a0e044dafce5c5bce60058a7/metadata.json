[The   advert sees cast members from FOX\u2019s primetime lineup, including Empire, New Girl, and Gotham, among others, celebrating the millions of people \u201cof every race, every color, every religion\u201d coming together and watching the biggest sporting event of the year.   Actors including Taraji P. Henson, Queen Latifah, Terrence Howard and Damon Wayans take turns reciting the same message spliced together around one inspiring theme of unity. \u201cVery soon, over 100 million people around the world will be watching the Super Bowl,\u201d the celebrity ensemble says in the commercial. \u201cFrom the smallest towns to the biggest cities, people of every race, every color, every religion, are sharing this moment together, which proves once again that the things that divide us are small compared to the great many things that unite us. From all of us at FOX, thanks for watching. \u201d The subtle political tone of FOX\u2019s new ad follows comments made by Super Bowl halftime performer Lady Gaga, who hinted earlier this week that her   performance may include some political statement. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I will succeed in unifying America. You\u2019ll have to ask America when it\u2019s over,\u201d the pop star said earlier this week during a press QA. \u201cBut the only statements that I\u2019ll be making during the halftime show are the ones that I\u2019ve been consistently making throughout my career. \u201d Super Bowl LI airs on February 5 on FOX.
