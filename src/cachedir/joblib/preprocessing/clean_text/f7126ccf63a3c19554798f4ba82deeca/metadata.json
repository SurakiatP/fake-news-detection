The next, with ice in your veins and a malicious flourish, you put a curse into action. On Thursday, Sara Mearns, the glamorous New York City Ballet principal, made an unlikely debut: the evil Fairy Carabosse in \u201cThe Sleeping Beauty. \u201d Her usual role, which she performed Wednesday, is the Lilac Fairy, Princess Aurora\u2019s shimmering protector who counteracts Carabosse\u2019s curse of death. Ms. Mearns, 31, is no polite ballerina, but an    dancer who reacts on the spot through her deep connection with music. Speaking twice in her dressing room on Thursday  \u2014   once during intermission and later after her brief, ferocious appearance in the second act  \u2014   Ms. Mearns reflected on the two roles. \u201cCarabosse is like spitfire  \u2014   short and sweet,\u201d she said. \u201cWith the Lilac Fairy, I feel very empowered. You\u2019re sort of in charge of the whole extravaganza. You\u2019re always there. \u201d After a parting hug so she could take her bow  \u2014   \u201cDon\u2019t get caught in the wing,\u201d she said, referring not to the stage but to the appendage on her glittering black dress  \u2014   she headed back out. For the record, the crowd roared. Ms. Mearns grinned with delight. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. Who did you model Carabosse on?  I wanted her to be the Maleficent Disney [animated] version where she just stands there. She\u2019s actually somewhat nice and doesn\u2019t scream in the beginning. Peter [Martins, the ballet master in chief] told me: \u201cCarabosse is just as beautiful as the Lilac Fairy. You should be above it all. But what\u2019s different is that your soul is evil. \u201d Your rage seemed to bubble up inside of you. Is that what it felt like?  Yes. I actually didn\u2019t think that was going to happen! When I\u2019ve seen people do that, I\u2019ve been like, there\u2019s no way that I could get myself to do that. I would feel so stupid. And then when I got onstage, there was no one standing in front of me. I was just like, oh my God, this feels right. What did you not want Carabosse to be? I didn\u2019t want to come out screaming like a crazy person. I feel like I have a really different approach. The music makes you want to go there because it\u2019s so powerful  \u2014   it makes you want to scream. The costume does it. You just standing there already does it. You just have to rein it in. It was hard, but once I really committed to the way I was going to do it, I felt comfortable. Was the experience what you thought it would be like?  Yes and no. I was waiting for this thrill of being evil onstage. I was more nervous than I thought I would be. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve actually done a character role that doesn\u2019t require dancing. There was such a different nervousness, such a different placement of your feet and your stance. Lilac Fairy is so much a part of me that I can grab it at a moment\u2019s notice, but Carabosse is so much deeper and harder to find that it took everything out of me. I actually get more tired doing this because my whole body is so tense. You can\u2019t hide behind your dancing, which is your comfort zone. Were you dancing with your hands?  Yes. The first time I had used the nails was in the stage rehearsal, and I saw how much you can do because your fingers are much longer than they normally are. I came up with this thing that I was doing on my chest. [She drummed her fingers slowly.] That part made me laugh.  I came up with it in the shower this morning. I felt like my hands were dancing instead of my feet. Your nails are scary. What are they? They\u2019re plastic fingers, and we have to tape them on. In the dress rehearsal, I lost two nails when I pulled off [the master of ceremonies] Catalabutte\u2019s wig because I didn\u2019t tape them right. I can\u2019t really feel my fingertips right now because they\u2019re so tight, but it\u2019s good. They won\u2019t fall off. Does Carabosse produce a different kind of adrenaline than the Lilac Fairy?  Yes. Dancing adrenaline is excitement  \u2014   it\u2019s like, I can\u2019t wait to do those steps, I can\u2019t wait to have that feeling. This is deeper. It\u2019s a   thing happening. You transform your soul to a dark place. You\u2019re not really happy when you come offstage. I couldn\u2019t tell if you were annoyed because you had to do an interview, or if you were still in character.  [Laughs.] No. I\u2019m still so mad! When you come off, you\u2019re not like, I did such a great job. You\u2019re simmering. With Carabosse, you can really go for it. You can scare people, throw people, just do whatever. I want to shock them.'"}, "time": 1742562552.6894703}
