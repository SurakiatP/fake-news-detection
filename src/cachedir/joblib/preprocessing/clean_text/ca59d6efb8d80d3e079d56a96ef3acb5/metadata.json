At the center of the tension stood the U.S. attorney for Brooklyn, Robert Capers, who some at the FBI came to view as exacerbating the problems by telling each side what it wanted to hear, these people said. Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Capers declined to comment. \\nThe roots of the dispute lie in a disagreement over the strength of the case, these people said, which broadly centered on whether Clinton Foundation contributors received favorable treatment from the State Department under Hillary Clinton. \\nSenior officials in the Justice Department and the FBI didn\u2019t think much of the evidence, while investigators believed they had promising leads their bosses wouldn\u2019t let them pursue, they said. \\nThese details on the probe are emerging amid the continuing furor surrounding FBI Director James Comey\u2019s disclosure to Congress that new emails had emerged that could be relevant to a separate, previously closed FBI investigation of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email arrangement while she was secretary of state. \\nOn Wednesday, President Barack Obama took the unusual step of criticizing the FBI when asked about Mr. Comey\u2019s disclosure of the emails. \\nAmid the internal finger-pointing on the Clinton Foundation matter, some have blamed the FBI\u2019s No. 2 official, deputy director Andrew McCabe, claiming he sought to stop agents from pursuing the case this summer. His defenders deny that, and say it was the Justice Department that kept pushing back on the investigation. \\nAt times, people on both sides of the dispute thought Mr. Capers agreed with them. Defenders of Mr. Capers said he was straightforward and always told people he thought the case wasn\u2019t strong.
