Jesus Christ. \u201d According to the San Jose Mercury News, he previously told a larger group of protesters, \u201cThere\u2019s some people who have been fighting for that issue before you guys were born. You ought to get on with it. \u201d Also on Saturday, longtime Democratic leader Eric Bauman was elected as chairman of the California Democratic Party Saturday, by just over 60 votes. But his rival, Kimberly Ellis, refused to concede, and has reportedly stated that she is in touch with attorneys over the matter. \u201cThis race is not done,\u201d Ellis told hundreds of her supporters, who were calling for a recount at the California Democratic Convention, according to the Los Angeles Times. She reportedly added, \u201cWe will see you all in the morning. \u201d Ellis just spoke to supporters outside ballot counting room: \u201dI want you to know that we have some serious concerns about the vote.\u201d pic. twitter.   \u2014   Christine   (@cmaiduc) May 21, 2017,  Bauman, on the other hand, issued a victory message to his supporters: There is no denying that there is a problem when so many of our hardworking activists feel that they are not welcome within our Party and that they have been slighted and shut out of the process. We cannot win the vital elections in 2018 and beyond without the energy, commitment and participation of every part of our Democratic family. Bauman has headed the Los Angeles County Democratic since 2000 and has served as the Golden State\u2019s Democratic party vice chairman since 2009. His victory in the race placed a spotlight on the nationwide battle between the party\u2019s establishment and more progressive wing. According to the Times, \u201cBauman was a favorite of the party establishment, while Ellis drew the backing of liberals who supported Sen. Bernie Sanders in last year\u2019s presidential primary. \u201d He recently endorsed Rep. Keith Ellison ( ) to chair the Democratic National Committee. Former Secretary of labor Tom Perez won the chairmanship, but appointed Ellison as his deputy chair. Saturday\u2019s convention also saw some drama when a convention staff employee interrupted Rep. Maxine Waters ( ) as she spoke at the African American Caucus meeting, to ask her to shorten her speech. As soon as the man approached Waters\u2019s podium, one of the women sitting on stage to her left shouted, \u201cHey, hey, hey, hey. \u201d Another woman in the audience could be heard saying, \u201cleave her alone. \u201d Soon after that, one of the men seated on stage stood up and starting pushing the man away from the congresswoman\u2019s podium. Audience members were outraged that a convention staff employee attempted to cut US Rep. @MaxineWaters\u2019 speech short. #cadem17 pic. twitter.   \u2014   Jazmine Ulloa (@jazmineulloa) May 21, 2017,  Waters continued, \u201cThat\u2019s alright. That\u2019s okay. They try to shut me up all the time. \u201d Some audience members stood up, and the room broke into applause. Waters, who has been calling for President Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment, was talking about Trump\u2019s decision to fire former FBI Director James Comey and his meetings with the Russian ambassador and foreign minister. In the back of the room, the man who had asked Waters to wrap up her speech was surrounded by what appeared to be several members of Waters team. Some chanted to Waters, \u201cKeep going! Keep going!\u201d At one point during her talk, the microphone was cut off, but Waters kept talking. US Rep. @MaxineWaters continues speaking after convention staff cut off the sound at the African American Caucus meeting. #cadem17 pic. twitter.   \u2014   Jazmine Ulloa (@jazmineulloa) May 21, 2017,  African American Caucus Chair Darren Parker said, \u201cOur caucus pays for this room  \u2026     And it has been tradition if we were going to run over that we pay additional fees. \u201d He added, \u201cI have never, ever seen anyone from staff walk up to a speaker, interrupt the speaker and then cut off the sound. \u201d He said, \u201cDamn it, we will not tolerate this!\u201d and thumped his fist on the table before the audience broke into applause. Sound back on after abrupt Caucus adjournment, confusion and anger. Chair Darren Parker assures it will be dealt with tomorrow. #cadem17 pic. twitter.   \u2014   Jazmine Ulloa (@jazmineulloa) May 21, 2017,  According to the Sacramento Bee, the   convention also had a raucous start Friday, as liberal activists booed and heckled DNC Chair Tom Perez after they marched from the state Capitol to the convention center to promote a universal heath care program.
