I lingered for a moment, slightly verklempt. I knew him, or, at least, I felt as if I did, and I couldn\u2019t believe he was already going to prom. The teenager was an    from New Jersey known as Jay Versace, who has appeared in my life in   increments for the last two years on Vine, the video app. I\u2019ve seen him confess that he\u2019s wet himself, channel Drake and Beyonc\u00e9 and balance an impressive number of items on his head. Most of Versace\u2019s Vines are shot in his bedroom, and watching his videos is as intimate as finding your younger brother\u2019s notebook of secret doodles or poems  \u2014   you\u2019re stumbling into his ( ) secret world. The kinship I felt reminded me of the bond I imagine my mother has when she talks about \u201cTracee\u201d (Ellis Ross) or \u201cChris\u201d (Rock) as if they could walk through our door at any moment and fix themselves something to eat. Jay Versace\u2019s work gives me the same feeling that, say, \u201cEverybody Hates Chris\u201d gave my mom  \u2014   comfort, stability, familiarity and warmth, a sense of identity and belonging. Versace\u2019s Vines are a particular product of black culture  \u2014   on the surface, they\u2019re funny to anyone lucky enough to bear witness, but there\u2019s a secondary layer that\u2019s meant for black people, predicated on our shared culture, experiences and understandings. If Facebook has become a destination for moms who are increasingly technologically literate, and Twitter has grown into a place for journalists who spread information (and snark) in   missives, Vine, the mobile video app that Twitter announced late last week will be discontinued in the coming months, has become a home for young black people, who dominated the service and established its visual language early  \u2014   quick cuts, referential jokes, deep allusions. (Jay Versace, for example, has three million followers.) Quickly consumed visuals have the potential to go viral online in ways that words do not, and Vines spread far and fast while also allowing its users to arbitrate their outcomes. While Facebook supplies recognition  \u2014   first and last name, hometown, face  \u2014   and Twitter can provide anonymity, Vine offered something in between: a place for people to see you, even people who didn\u2019t necessarily know who you were. Visual platforms like Snapchat are similar canvases for creativity, but make it difficult to attract an audience outside of one\u2019s social circles. Vine didn\u2019t privilege traditional celebrities  \u2014   its stars grew organically without the benefit of expensive equipment or   connections  \u2014   though after its official release in 2013, it seemed like everybody wanted to be there. Drake premiered the first clip of his album \u201cViews,\u201d on it dance crazes like \u201cThe Running Man Challenge\u201d were born there   slang like \u201con fleek,\u201d \u201cWHAT ARE THOOOSE\u201d and \u201cWhy you always lyin\u2019?\u201d debuted and spread on Vine. Like much of pop culture, these bits of virality were rooted in the black community, then sucked into the mainstream where businesses benefit from them financially. Vine incubated black ingenuity and creativity, allowing makers to play with structure, form, insertion, pacing and interpolation, and letting users employ the videos as punch lines, shorthand and punctuation. The service became its own ecosystem of black culture, both by relying on familiar figures, experiences and jokes, and by creating the next batch of them. Jay Versace mirrors black experience in a Vine about a relationship breakup, set to the 3LW song \u201cNo More (Baby I\u2019ma Do Right). \u201d He plays two characters: a befuddled male and his clearly angry girlfriend. It\u2019s funny because of the large, exaggerated emotions spreading across his baby face, the way he overemphasizes the singer Kiely Williams\u2019s lisp as he   the word \u201cpromises. \u201d Everyone can see that. But what\u2019s funnier is that he\u2019s making fun of the way we  \u2014   black people, the main audience who bought the 3LW records, and memorized their songs and dances  \u2014   all made fun of the song when we first heard it. Versace is sharing an inside joke. As the writer Kasai Richardson posted on Twitter, \u201cblack youth did more with six seconds than Hollywood has done with six decades. \u201d Most popular Vines were truly entertaining, even cinematic. But they also began conversations  \u2014   however small  \u2014   about the dynamics of comedy and culture created by black people. Chiefly, Vine was an exercise in how many black people talk among ourselves  \u2014   in code and allusion  \u2014   and how we telegraph blackness to white people, who may not know any black people besides the ones who live in their phone. Blackness is inherently political, but a number of black comedic Vines weren\u2019t, perhaps making it easier for white kids to latch onto  \u2014   there weren\u2019t murky politics to consider. Many black Vine stars relied on familiar tropes to appeal to black people but, in turn, may have reinforced stereotypes for white people, who received the content without the tacit understanding that everyone else is in on the joke. Still, that didn\u2019t stop Vine from functioning as a de facto FUBU  \u2014   for us, by us  \u2014   space for black people, where we could reinsert ourselves into a mainstream that excluded us, skewer our own culture (however safely) and create something new, a phenomenon that is relatively rare. There are few spaces to provide the public with black ingenuity Vine, in its own small way, was a digital exposition of black achievement. It was fitting, then, that Twitter announced the discontinuation of Vine the same day the \u201c \u201d scandal hit the internet. In an article about the film \u201cMoonlight,\u201d the film critic for The Toronto Star misheard the term \u201c\u201d a practice of alternating language or behavior based on the environment and atmosphere, and giddily included the eggcorn in promoting the article. It was a perfect example of how the experiences of minorities are often misconstrued. Vine was a place where you were either on the joke or you weren\u2019t, and so help you if you weren\u2019t. Vines were six rapid seconds of fun, a flash of candy down a throat. My favorite Vine wasn\u2019t a lifesaver or a masterwork it just cheered me up more quickly than any other emotional fix in my arsenal. It\u2019s called \u201cBlack people only need 3 claps to turnnn up!\u201d  \u2014   the premise is uncomplicated, and it manages to be cheeky, tender, nostalgic, surprising, hilarious, painfully true and      all in the span of six seconds. Vine was never that deep: it wasn\u2019t designed to spark a national conversation on race, culture, appropriation, ownership and identity. Its effect and utility, though, as a venue for black art to be created disseminated and understood, will be its legacy. Nobody ever tried to change the world with a Vine. But it served as the best place to get away from the world for a while.'"}, "time": 1742564136.6526976}
