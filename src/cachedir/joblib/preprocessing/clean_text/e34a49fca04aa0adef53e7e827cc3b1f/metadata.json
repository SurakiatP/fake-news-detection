By the time he boarded his return flight to Berlin, he had a new plan: to copy it. Mr. Gentz, a    German who is a   of Zalando  \u2014   a European clone of Zappos, the online American shoes and fashion retailer owned by Amazon  \u2014   held meetings in the fall of 2013 with Chinese and international fashion labels, online stores and other parts of the local   industry. He wanted to expand his company into the world\u2019s largest digital market. But after the meetings, Mr. Gentz decided China\u2019s approach to online fashion was far ahead of anything available elsewhere. He marveled at how Chinese consumers freely chatted with  \u2014   and bought from  \u2014   brands and stylists on WeChat, a local internet messenger, while online retailers, independent delivery companies and fashion houses routinely joined forces. \u201cWe wanted to take that experience back to Europe,\u201d Mr. Gentz said. This holiday season, Zalando, which is Europe\u2019s biggest digital fashion player, is using a    approach to take on Amazon, just as the American giant is looking to cement its place as the world\u2019s dominant   company by expanding aggressively into the Continent\u2019s   world of digital fashion. Few companies have been able to keep Amazon  \u2014   the largest online fashion seller in the United States  \u2014   at bay after it enters a new market. The notable exception is in China, where rivals like Alibaba, the world\u2019s   online seller by market value, have been able to hold their ground. For decades, tech companies have taken their cues from Silicon Valley. But Zalando\u2019s approach of borrowing from its Chinese counterparts represents a new strategy of looking East, not West, for inspiration. In overhauling its successful European online fashion store into a digital platform, Zalando differs from others trying to match Amazon and its logistics and technological prowess. The German company previously focused on handling all sales and inventory itself. But in addition to selling directly to consumers, it now wants to remake itself into a digital shopping mall, allowing fashion houses and retailers to make sales as well, often with limited input from Zalando. These efforts, roughly a year in the making, may foster a rare European tech player able to give Silicon Valley   a run for their money across the region, still one of the world\u2019s largest  \u2014   and most profitable  \u2014   markets. \u201cIf you want to be the dominant player in a geographical area, you need to go beyond being just a traditional   player,\u201d said Erik Mitteregger, a board member at Kinnevik, a Swedish investment firm that was an early Zalando investor and still owns a 32 percent stake. \u201cIt\u2019s a necessary move. \u201d Zalando\u2019s inspiration from China, though, comes with challenges. Despite domestic dominance, Chinese players like Alibaba have yet to successfully replicate their business model overseas. Online shopping habits in Europe also are somewhat different from those in China. And Amazon and European competitors, including ASOS and Yoox    may yet outmuscle Zalando with their traditional takes on  . For most Americans  \u2014   and even some Europeans outside its core   markets  \u2014   Zalando is not a household name. It began in 2008 as a Berlin   founded by Mr. Gentz and David Schneider, two business school graduates who once tried  \u2014   and failed  \u2014   to build a Latin American rival to Facebook. By 2014, Zalando had become the largest public offering in the European tech sector since 2000. It counts Rocket Internet, a Berlin incubator known for copying successful online business ideas, and DST Global, a backer of Facebook, Twitter and Alibaba, among its early investors. To meet the needs of Europe\u2019s national markets, Zalando has tweaked its offerings. In Germany, where few people use credit cards, consumers can pay with an online service linked to their bank accounts after receiving clothes in the mail. In Italy, it worked with a local delivery company so people wary of goods not arriving could pay in cash upon receipt of their orders. While European competitors have also earned loyal followings, Zalando remains the largest, both by market valuation and total online sales, according to Euromonitor, a data provider. It is expected to double its yearly pretax earnings this year, to $220 million, and revenue is likely to jump more than 20 percent, to $4 billion, according to an average of equity analysts\u2019 estimates. \u201cZalando is well placed to be a leading fashion platform in Europe,\u201d said Andrea Ferraz, a Morgan Stanley analyst in London. Still, the company remains a relative minnow  \u2014   its $9. 5 billion valuation is   that of Amazon. And Europe\u2019s   online fashion market, estimated to be worth $75 billion, has not gone unnoticed by   giants. Alibaba has hired local country managers and brought its payment service to Europe, mostly to serve Chinese visitors. Amazon has opened a fashion studio in London and joined the British Fashion Council to bolster its local credibility. To compete with Amazon and others, Zalando has spent heavily on a network of logistics hubs that dot the European landscape. On the outskirts of Erfurt, a sleepy German town, orange boxes filled with designer dresses and shoes scuttled along miles of conveyor belts, while workers on   sped through Zalando\u2019s first   logistics warehouse, now the size of 18 football fields. Four more  \u2014   from Italy to Germany  \u2014   are up and running, and new sites are planned outside Paris and, potentially, near London. And just like Amazon, the company has been accused of mistreating some of its workers, complaints Zalando executives acknowledge they could have handled better. As part of its overhaul, Mr. Gentz gathered his management team soon after Zalando\u2019s I. P. O. in 2014, outlining the steps needed to become a digital hub for all things fashion. For one, it is combining its logistical expertise with that of big brands and mom and pop stores all over Europe. The goal, executives say, is to use Zalando\u2019s website and smartphone application as a platform to sell goods either from its warehouses or directly from fashion houses themselves, giving customers greater choice and flexibility. Adidas, for instance, allows people to buy its items through Zalando\u2019s platform, even though the final sale may come directly from the German sports brand\u2019s stock (Zalando takes a commission). The relationship now includes   deliveries  \u2014   the fastest, in Berlin, took just 24 minutes  \u2014   from some of Adidas\u2019s German stores. \u201cNo one else offers this level of partnership,\u201d said Roland Auschel, Adidas\u2019s head of global sales, who first discussed stronger ties with Zalando during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. The   company has also offered up its   advertising team. That includes testing an online marketplace where Zalando connects fashion houses with \u201conline influencers,\u201d or personalities with large social media followings. For Nicolas Borg, a Zalando strategy executive who previously worked at eBay, the next stage will most likely be chatbots, or humanlike interactions powered by artificial intelligence, to offer fashion advice to consumers on the likes of Facebook Messenger. \u201cIn the future, what will matter is not where the purchase happens, but how you can influence it,\u201d Mr. Borg said. \u201cThat is our biggest challenge,\u201d he added. \u201cHow do we change the online experience?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742628572.0444295}
