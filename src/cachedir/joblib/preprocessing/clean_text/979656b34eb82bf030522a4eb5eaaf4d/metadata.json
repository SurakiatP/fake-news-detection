[A study by political scientist Jesse Richman from Old Dominion University in Virginia found that 6. 4 percent of the 20 million noncitizens who reside in the United States voted in November\u2019s presidential election.  He then extrapolated these results into support for each presidential candidate, estimating that Clinton would have received 81 percent support from noncitizens, therefore receiving an extra 834, 000 votes. The number of 834, 000 is significant enough to have tipped some of the closest races in Clinton\u2019s favor, including New Hampshire, Nevada, and Maine, all of which Clinton won by margins of under 3 percent. It would also have reduced Clinton\u2019s margin of victory in the popular vote, which she won by 2. 8 million by dominating cosmopolitan centers such as New York and California. On Wednesday, President Donald Trump said he would be opening up a \u201cmajor investigation into voter fraud,\u201d promising to \u201cstrengthen up voting procedures. \u201d I will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and  \u2026    .  \u2014   Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016,  However, Richman rejects Trump\u2019s theory, stating in his paper that it was \u201cnot at all plausible that   votes account for the entire   popular vote margin held by Clinton. \u201d In the run up to the election, a number of   cities were found to be pushing plans to increase the voting rights of   in order to further strengthen Democrat incumbents. The Democratic Party has long been in favor of increasing voting rights for noncitizens, as well as felons, in the knowledge that these groups are more likely to vote Democrat rather than Republican.
