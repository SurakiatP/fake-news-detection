But one has to assume they are apoplectic over their failure in Syria. Billions of dollars and years wasted all because people have direct access to information unfiltered out of Syria. \\nIt should have a completely unremarkable US regime change operation: \\n* Send in the NGOs to agitate locals * Make promises of support for attacks on the government by the sole world superpower * Get selectively edited footage of your collaborators on the ground being attacked by the government(after they attacked the government) * Pump out mass amounts of propaganda based off that footage: \"Simple farmers rising up to overthrow a brutal regime!\" * Wield the tremendous economic power of the US to ensure the vast majority of smaller countries are on board with military action sanctioned by the UN * Flood the country with arms for anyone no matter how crazy to attack the government * Fake chemical attacks, US intelligence agency compromised UN reports and inspectors, etc. \\nAll of that derailed by nothing more than people having direct access to information uncensored out of Syria. \\nI think it is safe to assume the US intelligence agencies are actively working on ways to make it illegal or impossible for anyone to publish, share, or consume \\'unauthorized\\' information from countries that are targets of regime change. \\nThe easiest way would be to designate any source of information not actively working with or approved by the US intelligence agencies will be increasingly labeled as \\'terror propaganda\\' and US social media and Internet providers will be required to censor or shutdown any such sources. Posted by: Stevens | Nov 18, 2016 2:16:40 PM | 2 \\nStevens @ 2: Great post, thanks. \\nThis \"regime change\" U$A foreign policy, has been implemented around the globe for many many years now, all in the interests of big corporate profits, and global hegemony. The sad truth seems to be, there are no signs its about to change. Posted by: ben | Nov 18, 2016 2:34:13 PM | 3 \\nI was watching a travelogue program on PBS. The trip was to Cuba. The narrator traveled by train across the country. A train line that was originally built in the 1870s by Spain to divide the country for defensive and control purposes. The locomotives pulling the passenger cars were 1950s USA manufactured vintage and date to a time when our Federal Government had good economic relations with the Batista Regiem. \\nWhen I think of the cruel and unusual economic punishment dished out to Cuba by our Federal Government all I can see is a bunch of financially poor peasants who bear the brunt of U.S. economic warfare. Just as in the Middle East and now Europe economic sanction wars hurt the farmer, the small business operator, the basic family unit, etc., while rich people get richer. Isn\\'t it about time to back off on the economic war against Cuba and the rest of the Planet? Our collective cruelty seems to know no bounds? \\nJust my opinion Posted by: ALberto | Nov 18, 2016 3:00:02 PM | 4 \\nBernhard, I should think most of us reading and commenting here have pretty much accepted the result of the US presidential elections and are glad that Killer Klinton\\'s ambitions have crashed and her future seems to be in a white house with steel bar columns and uniformed prison guards. \\nThe focus is now on President-elect Donald Trump\\'s likely cabinet appointments, who are the most likely choices for critical positions like Defense Secretary and State Secretary, what the process is and how that is being carried out (or not carried out), and what that says about Trump\\'s leadership and decision-making style, how he plans on being President and whether his choices are the right choices for his agenda (if it is genuine) of reforming the political culture on Capitol Hill, or \"draining the swamp\". \\nIf indeed Trump is intent on bringing changes to Capitol Hill, then there\\'s a strong likelihood that the Soros-funded \"Color Revolution\" rioting around the US East and West Coasts will come to Washington and we\\'ll be seeing a re-enactment of the Kiev Maidan events there. Posted by: Jen | Nov 18, 2016 3:01:27 PM | 5 \\nDoes the Constitution of the United States require the president to have a specific number of executive departments? The answer is no. George Washington only had four departments in his administration as first President of the United States. \\nPerhaps if Mr. Trump can\\'t find suitable candidates for his cabinet when he \"drains the swamp\", he could assume the role as interim department head until such time as qualified non-militarists emerge from the private sector to serve in his administration.

Now Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and many others are suffering from terrorism and separatist terrorism.\u201dWhat\u2019s your comment on that?

Middle America white (and not only) working class men are extremely well armed and are really angry still. So, if this rioting will come to Washington, who says that good ole\\' Ford Truck can not run over mountain bike of Tesla? Once the shooting starts (hopefully not) it will be a totally different game than Kiev \"Maidan\". There is also a trend, call it a hunch--most of US combat veterans from US endless wars tend to lean towards people like Trump.

I suspect that this is the venue that the neolibcons will use to try to steal the election from Trump. The \"demonstrators\" paid and organized by Soros et al help set the background and provide the rationale for the \"need\" to \"accept the will of the people\". \\nIf this should transpire, then you will see civil unrest. The red states will not go along with the theft of the election for Clinton.

I have friends, middle class professionals, who\\'ve been participating in California and all they know about Soros is he made a ton of $$ on Brit Currency bets 2 decades ago. \\nThe elector\\'s \"switch\" is not going to happen, just more hysteria. Posted by: jdmckay | Nov 18, 2016 4:40:06 PM | 13 If this should transpire, then you will see civil unrest. The red states will not go along with the theft of the election for Clinton. \\nEven the \"blue\" states have very large and populous \"red\" areas--mostly beyond large urban centers which long ago became a cloaca of depravity. My point is, that this possible (how probable--that is totally another discussion) civil unrest, once \"red\" states America gets involved seriously, will not last too long for a number of purely tactical, operational and logistical reasons. This is if to discount the possibility of law enforcement actually enforcing the law and order which may, under certain conditions, turn very violent against those who will try to undermine constitutional process. Blue states can not win for mostly cultural reasons since, as I already stated, \"Red\" states\\' America is simply armed on several orders of magnitude better and is really angry. It is also tougher. Social and cultural composition of HRC\\'s electorate speaks volumes--it is, in Steve Sailer\\'s words (I think it was him), a \"coalition of the fringes\" and not very capable to start with.

He is the man behind such viral headlines as \u201cThe Amish in America Commit their Vote to Donald Trump\u201d and \u201cPresident Obama Signs Executive Order Banning the National Anthem at all Sporting Events Nationwide\u201d \u2014 neither of which were true. \\n\u201cMy sites were picked up by Trump supporters all the time. I think Trump is in the White House because of me. His followers don\u2019t fact-check anything \u2014 they\u2019ll post everything, believe anything. His campaign manager posted my story about a protester getting paid $3,500 as fact. Like, I made that up. I posted a fake ad on Craigslist,\u201d he told The Washington Post.

Rule by monopolistic global corporations, at best, supports 20% of the population in the short term. It enriches the ruling elite and their servants and improvises everyone else. In the long term, climate change or a nuclear war, brought on by the blind needs of greed, will end the world as we know it. Brexit and the Trump Presidency proved that globalism and democracy are incompatible. For globalism to proceed in the middle term, it will require a surveillance police state, total propaganda, reeducation camps and the shutdown of this bar.

I think at least Western Syria will be cleansed of jihadis as a result. \\nBut Trump might be a little more hard nosed in the future. After the tensions are dialed down and having the score at basically Russia 1, US 0, he\\'s not going to be so pliable. He sure as fuck isn\\'t going to throw Israel under a bus. He\\'s not going to roll over on all American commitments in the region. \\nTrump\\'s been getting a complete rundown on the big picture. It\\'s no secret that until recently he couldn\\'t have found Damascus on a map. Now he knows about the Shiite Crescent and how the arms can flow from Iran to Syria to Hezbollah in Lebanon in volumes like never before and how upsetting that is for Israel. \\nNow there\\'s action towards taking Raqqa by the Kurds and who knows who else. The US and its posse will provide the air cover and logistics plus lots of special ops once it kicks in. I\\'m surprised the Kurds bit again after taking it up the arse from the US a couple of months ago They\\'re not going all in right now as things are ongoing in Mosul and will be for a while. But you don\\'t hear Assad and the Russians squawking much about it. It\\'s like they both know that parts of Eastern Syria are bye-bye. \\nTrump\\'s good will towards Russia certainly doesn\\'t extend to Iran. And no American will ever call Hezbollah anything bur a terrorist organization after the Marine barracks truck bombing in Beirut all those years ago. If Putin and Trump are going to come to a general understanding in the ME there\\'s going to have to be some give and take. \\nPutin\\'s done quite a turnaround in taking Russia from a pariah state a couple of years ago to the player on the world sage that it is now. It\\'s looking good for him to keep his man in power in Syria and to establish a permanent presence in the ME with Khmeimim and Tartus. Once Trump is fully up to speed on the totality of American interests in the region he is bound by his office not to walk away from them. There will have to be some serious deal-making. Posted by: peter | Nov 18, 2016 5:16:47 PM | 21 Putin\\'s done quite a turnaround in taking Russia from a pariah state a couple of years ago to the player on the world sage that it is now. \\nYour timeline is a bit off. The coming of Putin was a direct result of NATO\\'s 1999 aggression against Yugoslavia, while War of 08-08-08 was the start of Russia\\'s return into big league. So, it is not a \"couple of years\". Results of War of 080808 actually stunned DC\\'s neocon interventionist cabal. Posted by: SmoothieX12 | Nov 18, 2016 5:28:28 PM | 22 Who decides which news is fake? \\nBuzzfeed did some analysis on Social media generated fake news during the election. An awful lot of it was simply false. You can look at some of those headlines and judge for yourself. \\nIronically, Paul Horner (guy behind \"fake news empire\" I linked in prior post) said: He said he didn\u2019t do it for ideological reasons. \u201cI hate Trump,\u201d he told The Post. \u201cI thought I was messing with the campaign, maybe I wasn\u2019t messing them up as much as I wanted \u2014 but I never thought he\u2019d actually get elected.\u201d \\nJust happens 70% + of fake news this election cycle (according to Buzzfeed) was anti-Clinton.
