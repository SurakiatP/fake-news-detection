The enthusiastic reaction of Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, was understandable on Friday when the Labor Department reported a gain of 235, 000 jobs. \u201cGreat news for American workers,\u201d he proclaimed on Twitter 22 minutes after the Labor Department release, \u201cin first report for @POTUS Trump. \u201d Mr. Spicer was probably just following President Trump\u2019s lead. At 8:41 a. m. 11 minutes after the report\u2019s 8:30 release, Mr. Trump reposted a Twitter message sent by the conservative website Drudge Report that linked to a news report with the comment \u201cGREAT AGAIN: +235, 000. \u201d But those messages on Twitter apparently violate a federal rule barring executive branch employees from publicly commenting on principal economic indicators for at least one hour after the official release time. Announced in the Federal Register on Sept. 25, 1985, when Ronald Reagan was president, the rule was adopted \u201cto preserve the distinction between the   release of data by statistical agencies and their interpretation by policy officials,\u201d and to avoid affecting \u201cfinancial and commodity markets,\u201d according to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, part of the Office of Management and Budget. The rule as published in the Federal Register does not include a penalty for violation. The White House receives the jobs data through the Council of Economic Advisers on Thursday afternoon, before its Friday release. Jason Furman, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in President Barack Obama\u2019s second term, said by email on Friday: \u201cThe interpretation of our administration (like Clinton and Bush) was that this applied to POTUS. There were times they wanted Obama to comment, his flight or whatever was taking off at 9:20 and they would hold off until 9:30 so he could comment then. \u201d Of course the Trump administration\u2019s delight was no surprise. And at a White House briefing on Friday afternoon, Mr. Spicer addressed the issue with  . \u201cDon\u2019t make me make the podium move,\u201d he told a questioner, alluding to a parody of his briefing style on \u201cSaturday Night Live. \u201d He said that while \u201cI understand the rule,\u201d he felt his post had caused no market disruption because the news was already out. \u201cI apologize if we were a little excited, and we\u2019re so excited to see so many Americans back to work,\u201d he added.'"}, "time": 1742563583.2715266}
