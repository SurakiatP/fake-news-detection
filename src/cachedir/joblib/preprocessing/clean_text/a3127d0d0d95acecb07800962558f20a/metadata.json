Users shared the post nearly 32, 000 times, and 8, 400 people commented on the horse adventure. Following the short tour through the store, Fields exits the store through the front door and joins a fellow rider waiting outside. A short time later, a second mounted Walmart shopper can be seen exiting the same door. It is not known if the rider waiting outside had also ventured through the store with his horse. Several small children could be seen in proximity to Fields and his horse as they rode through the store. No groceries or other items were purchased, despite his claim of \u201cgrocery shopping. \u201d Fields made a second post that appeared to mock the store\u2019s greeter as he entered the building. \u201cWe were just riding, and a buddy of mines was, like, \u2018Let\u2019s go to Walmart,\u2019 and I was, like, \u2018Man, I\u2019m not going to Walmart,\u2019 Fields told Click2Houston. \u201cHe was, like, \u2018Come on, let\u2019s go! \u2019\u201d \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to hurt nobody, or do anything destructive. It was just, like, you only live once, you know? That\u2019s all,\u201d Fields said. KTRK ABC13 reported one of the horses relieve itself inside the store. They did not say if Fields and his companion offered to clean up the mess. Walmart officials did not appear pleased as they responded, \u201cWe in no way condone yesterday\u2019s reckless stunt inside our store and are thankful no one was hurt by these actions. \u201d The Houston Humane Society also appeared to not approve of the behavior. The group posted this statement: At minimum, riding a horse inside a store is incredibly irresponsible. This would be extremely stressful on any horse. Horses can easily become spooked, endangering not only themselves, but also any shoppers they might encounter. The Houston Humane Society urges all pet owners to think and act responsibly when it comes to the lives of animals in their care. Houston is currently in the middle of the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo. It is not known if Fields and his companion were riding in connection to this or if they were simply out having fun during the   conditions on the last official day of winter. He posted a group of photos showing his horse buddies riding in other areas of Houston, including the Galleria area. It appears everyone was having a good time and many children were able to experience the horses first hand.
