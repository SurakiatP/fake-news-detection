And, \u201cDoes this come in a  ?\u201d Instead, I\u2019m propped in bed on a dozen pillows with my laptop, perusing online furniture stores: West Elm, Joybird, Crate  Barrel and something called Chairish. I am an internet   fiend. I take breaks only when the oxy overwhelms me and my head starts to loll. I cannot rest until I have considered every        sofa the worldwide web has to offer. I pore over design sites like Apartment Therapy, Design Sponge and Domino: searching, searching. Since John and I married 16 years ago, we have never had a real   couch. We\u2019ve had plenty of   misfits: \u201cas is\u201d Ikea specials, parental handoffs, Craigslist   roadside rescues. First we were broke, and then we had babies. It never seemed like the right time to splurge on anything nice. And the misfits have been fine. We\u2019re not fancy, and our taste is eclectic. Our house is full of objects that are stronger on personality than looks: the wood box my father and uncles sat on as children to lace their boots for sledding, a lumpy chaise by the front window in the world\u2019s coziest reading nook. Anyway, whenever we have needed to get down to the serious business of life, we have always preferred to retreat to our bed: our war room, cocoon, escape hatch and, at times, dining room. But in the weeks after I learned that the breast cancer I have been in treatment for over the past year had spread to my bones  \u2014   breaking my spine and becoming incurable and most likely fatal  \u2014   finding the perfect   couch has begun to feel like the most important thing I\u2019ve ever done. Except, just when I find one I love, it turns out I can\u2019t click \u201cbuy now. \u201d And commitment issues have not generally been my problem. Houses, cars,            mastectomy: Bring it. Usually I just pick a   option and don\u2019t look back. Within 10 minutes of meeting John at a summer job at 21, I had already mentally signed on for life  \u2014   although I waited at least a week to tell him that. But the couch. I can\u2019t do it. Maybe I\u2019m holding off until after my next big oncology appointment, as though something my doctor may say will help determine whether I am willing to spend the extra money for Dacron batting and   cushions. She promised some new thoughts about treatment options: immunotherapy, clinical trials,   drugs, acupuncture, the dreaded \u201cwatchful waiting. \u201d It\u2019s a complicated calculus. On the one hand, a basic   analysis: How much money do I want to spend on something I may not be around to really enjoy? On the other: Isn\u2019t buying an expensive couch a kind of lovely expression of hopefulness? And after I\u2019m gone, don\u2019t I still want guests in my home to feel comfortable and stylish? None of this was supposed to happen. At 38, I wasn\u2019t supposed to lie on my back in the E. R. on a late December morning and be told by a teary radiation oncology resident that the pain I\u2019d been having for two months  \u2014   that I\u2019d been assured was from having a weak core after months of chemo  \u2014   was actually from a tumor that had devoured my L2 vertebra. John wasn\u2019t supposed to have to hold me up on the toilet. Put my pants on for me. Do Christmas Eve for the children without me. I\u2019m not supposed to be thinking about where he will sit and hold my hand as I take my last breath. Despite all the pamphlets the social workers gave us when I was in the hospital, we don\u2019t really know how to talk to our boys yet. They are 6 and 9. They know about the cancer and the back break, but they don\u2019t really know what it all means. Instead I ask the    \u201cWhat do you think of leather upholstery?\u201d \u201cDepends if it\u2019s slippery or nuzzly,\u201d he says. Excellent point. I think I need to take any bonded leather options  \u2014   no matter how cute or economical they seem  \u2014   off my favorites lists and go with  . The day after the emergency surgery, when my doctor was sitting on the end of my bed in the oncology ward, I saw her glance toward those pamphlets that had been left on the bedside table: \u201cWhat to Tell Your Children About Your Progressive Disease. \u201d She\u2019s a mother, too. Her children are only a couple of years older than mine. \u201cIs it time to despair?\u201d she said during a pause in our discussion about pain management and radiation, maybe reading one of the pamphlet headings. \u201cNo!\u201d she proclaimed, staring straight at me. \u201cNo, it is not. \u201d I trust her completely, even after the chemo failed twice and the cancer spread when she said it wouldn\u2019t. Whatever it is in oncologists that makes them want to be oncologists  \u2014   that crazy mix of fierceness, optimism, arrogance and compassion  \u2014   I get a contact high from it. It\u2019s like love at first sight, or touching something on fire. It\u2019s like making a choice and refusing to look back. John is mildly   averse, but he\u2019s treading carefully. He knows me well enough to understand that when I\u2019m dissertating on the merits of tufted cushions, I\u2019m chewing on something else. \u201cCustom upholstery, really? With two boys?\u201d he asks, flipping through insurance statements on the counter. \u201cO. K. well, I think you should get whatever you\u2019re into. \u201d One big upside of being told I have incurable cancer is that after all these years, my husband has finally stopped smugly saying, \u201cIt\u2019s your funeral,\u201d when I make a decision he doesn\u2019t agree with. \u201cDid you spend thousands of dollars on the internet today?\u201d he asks when he gets home from work and finds me with my pillows and   bottles on the   couch where he left me in the morning, a   rattan situation my parents bought as patio furniture in the early \u201990s. \u201cNot today,\u201d I say. \u201cNice,\u201d he says. \u201cDo you want to go get in bed together and stare at the ceiling?\u201d I do. We do. In January, the afternoon already looks like evening. \u201cCan you believe we found out you have incurable cancer on, literally, the darkest day of the year?\u201d John asks as we hold hands and stare up toward the same blank spot above our bed. \u201cYeah, I totally can,\u201d I say. We both laugh. I have always loved the sound of him laughing: soft and comfortable, understated, offbeat, with unmistakably sleek midcentury lines. He takes me gingerly in his arms as if we are awkward teenagers. My back spasms, but I wiggle closer to him until I can put my head on his chest and hear his heart beating. Downstairs, the boys gaze at a screen on the old futon in the playroom. We will figure out what to do about them soon enough. They probably already know what\u2019s up and are waiting for us to figure out how to say it. Despite not being much of a Christmas person myself, I hated not being able to watch them open presents and can\u2019t bear the thought of never doing it again. Their very existence is the one dark piece I cannot get right with in all this. I can let go of a lot of things: plans, friends, career goals, places in the world I want to see, maybe even the love of my life. But I cannot figure out how to let go of mothering them. So maybe I don\u2019t try to figure it out. Maybe I just aim to get the couch right: strong bones,   leather, something earthy and animal and real. A surface that knows something of what it was to be alive, that warms to our touch and cools in our absence. Also: an expansive bench that fits all of us. Something that will hold us through everything that lies ahead  \u2014   the loving, collapsing and nuzzling. The dying, the grieving. I know my thoughts have probably diverged from whatever John is thinking about in the near dark of our bedroom. He is silent. Maybe he is dozing. Buying a sofa online, like many of life\u2019s biggest decisions, takes research and trust, but mostly trust. As I lie here, with John\u2019s chest rising and falling under my cheek, I realize that my careful calculations (How long do I have left? Who am I really buying this couch for? Am I getting a good deal?) are irrelevant. As in all things, I have to believe I\u2019ll know what\u2019s right when I see it.'"}, "time": 1742562440.894587}
