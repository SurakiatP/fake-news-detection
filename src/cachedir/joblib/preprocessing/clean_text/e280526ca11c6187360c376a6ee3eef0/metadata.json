Reyes was not on the Mets\u2019 roster when the season began. Neither was James Loney, nor Jay Bruce nor T. J. Rivera nor Seth Lugo nor Robert Gsellman. Saturday\u2019s starter, Bartolo Colon, was supposed to have been in the bullpen by now. Up and down that battered and patchwork roster, the Mets looked distinctly different from the team that won the National League East and reached the World Series last season. Yet there they were on Saturday afternoon after a   win over the Philadelphia Phillies, celebrating a return to the postseason that seemed improbable six weeks ago. \u201cThis year was harder for us to get in, even if it is to play only one game,\u201d Colon said, his shirt wet with beer and Champagne. With the victory, the Mets secured the top N. L.   spot they will host a     game on Wednesday at Citi Field against either the St. Louis Cardinals or the San Francisco Giants. It is only the second time in the Mets\u2019   history that they have reached the playoffs for a second consecutive season. To secure their berth, the Mets required 46 players, 87 wins, eight months and countless visits to the training room. By winning on the penultimate day of the regular season, the Mets can save their best starter, Noah Syndergaard, who was originally scheduled to start on Sunday, for their biggest game of the year. \u201cIt\u2019s like every little kid\u2019s dream come true to pitch in a   game,\u201d Syndergaard said. \u201cI\u2019ll embrace it, and I look forward to it. \u201d Colon allowed two runs but provided five solid innings on Saturday. The bullpen, as it has often done during the   surge, completed the win. Loney smashed a     homer in the sixth and then dropped his bat and pointed to the Mets\u2019 dugout in glee. \u201cYou don\u2019t script that,\u201d said Loney, whom the Mets plucked from the San Diego Padres\u2019 AAA affiliate in late May to fill the void left by an injury to first baseman Lucas Duda. \u201cYour body just takes over. Those are the moments you dream of. \u201d Having to play a    game after a World Series appearance may seem disappointing, but not to a team that sustained so many significant injuries. \u201cA huge accomplishment,\u201d said catcher Travis d\u2019Arnaud, one of seven players from the Mets\u2019 opening day lineup who spent time on the disabled list. The starting rotation, the backbone of the Mets last season, was hit the hardest. Zack Wheeler, who was supposed to have replaced Colon in the rotation, never joined the Mets in the season\u2019s second half, as planned, because of setbacks in his rehabilitation from Tommy John surgery. Matt Harvey has not pitched since July 4. Jacob deGrom has not pitched since Sept. 1, and Steven Matz, who will have surgery next week, has not pitched since Aug. 14. \u201cSurprisingly, our greatest strength was deeper than we even expected that strength to have been,\u201d Mets General Manager Sandy Alderson said. In the far corner of the clubhouse, Gsellman and Lugo, the unheralded prospects who saved the rotation, posed together for a photo amid the revelry. Gsellman started the season at Class AA Binghamton. Lugo posted unimpressive numbers in Class AAA, and some scouts doubted that he would ever reach the majors. Yet as deGrom and Matz succumbed to   injuries, Lugo and Gsellman impressed everyone with their poise and their pitching. The Mets went   in games they started. \u201cThere are no words to describe this feeling,\u201d Gsellman said. \u201cThis is the first step to the playoffs. Hopefully, this is not our last time. \u201d The Mets were also missing second baseman Neil Walker, who has been out since Aug. 27, and the team\u2019s captain, third baseman David Wright, who has not played since May 27. He was replaced by Reyes, who was released by the Colorado Rockies after serving a domestic violence suspension and was given a second chance by the Mets. Many players pointed to Reyes\u2019s energy as a catalyst. But so were the returns of Asdrubal Cabrera and Yoenis Cespedes from injuries on Aug. 19. That day, the Mets lost to the Giants in San Francisco and fell to  . They sat five and a half games out of the second   spot. A feeling grew within the clubhouse that this was a doomed season. But behind Cabrera, Cespedes and Reyes, the Mets started a hot streak. The   offense improved. Cabrera persevered despite a balky left knee. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy,\u201d Cabrera said. \u201cI gave my 100 percent  \u2014   actually my 200 percent  \u2014   to help the team win. \u201d Since the season\u2019s low point in San Francisco, the Mets have been the best team in the majors, going   thanks in part to a soft September schedule. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see the team this year accomplish as much as it did with as many obstacles placed in its path,\u201d Alderson said. Roster moves throughout the season paid off. Although Bruce struggled for more than a month after the Mets acquired him in a trade on Aug. 1, he caught fire at the plate in late September. The already dominant relievers Addison Reed and Jeurys Familia received help from Fernando Salas, also acquired by trade. \u201cSandy deserves so much credit,\u201d Collins said. \u201cHe took a chance on Jose Reyes when nobody else would. He brought kids up from the minor leagues and stuck them in the rotation. He\u2019s not afraid. \u201d As the celebration in the clubhouse died down, Alderson and the assistant general manager John Ricco sat in Collins\u2019s office to talk. The preparation for Wednesday\u2019s game had begun.'"}, "time": 1742564316.2517805}
