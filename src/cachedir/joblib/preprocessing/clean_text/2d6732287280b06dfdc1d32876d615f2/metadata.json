In June 2011, the Bureau and the Russian Ministry of Defense signed a state contract for the Sarmat\u2019s development. The prospective strategic missile system is being developed in order to assuredly and effectively fulfil objectives of nuclear deterrent by Russia\u2019s strategic forces.\u201d \\nAs Zero Hedge noted, the Sarmat has a specific goal of evading U.S. anti-ballistic missile systems that have been deployed in Eastern Europe. \\nThis is yet another reason why we need a president who understands the importance of modernizing and beefing up our military in these uncertain times. \\nWhile the U.S. stays stuck in the 1960\u2019s and 1970\u2019s with our strategic deterrents, Russia is working to upgrade their armory. The new Sarmat missile is set to be ready to go in 2018. \\nAntiWar\u2019s Jason Ditz had this to say about the situation between the U.S. and Russia in regard to our respective military capabilities: \\nOf course, the United States spends many, many times what Russia does on its military, but the fact that Russia has a proper military capable of defending the nation at all puts it in a total different category from most of America\u2019s recent wars, and Russia\u2019s massive nuclear arsenal makes it clear this is one war which, if the US launches it, they won\u2019t be able to win outright. \\nDemocrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has called for a no-fly zone over Syria. Here\u2019s what Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph Dunford, had to say about that. \\n\u201cRight now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria it would require us to go to war, against Syria and Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty fundamental decision that certainly I\u2019m not going to make.\u201d \\nClinton\u2019s track record \u2014 both in action and in words \u2014 proves that she does not have the judgment necessary to be president.'"}, "time": 1742562135.808313}
