Ryan of Wisconsin, and Senator John McCain of Arizona  \u2014   in their primary election campaigns. Mr. Ryan and Mr. McCain have both endorsed Mr. Trump for president, but they have criticized his denouncement of Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the parents of Capt. Humayun Khan, who was killed in Iraq in 2004. \u201cI like Paul, but these are horrible times for our country,\u201d Mr. Trump told The Washington Post. \u201cWe need very strong leadership. We need very, very strong leadership. And I\u2019m just not quite there yet. I\u2019m not quite there yet. \u201d Mr. Trump had signaled support for Mr. Ryan\u2019s   primary opponent, Paul Nehlen,  in a Twitter message on Monday night, thanking him for his \u201ckind words. \u201d The nominee\u2019s \u201cnot quite there yet\u201d wording echoed language that Mr. Ryan used in May when he was still wavering on whether to get behind Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump also singled out Mr. McCain, telling The Post: \u201cI\u2019ve never been there with John McCain because I\u2019ve always felt that he should have done a much better job for the vets. \u201d The comments are a significant break in the steps toward party unity that Republican officials have been stressing since their convention last month. The remarks are also an indication that the party is still struggling to heal some of the wounds from Mr. Trump\u2019s primary campaign. After Khizr Khan rebuked Mr. Trump at the Democratic National Convention, Mr. Trump traded in religious stereotypes by suggesting that Mr. Khan might have prevented his wife from speaking at the event. Mr. Ryan said in a statement on Sunday that he rejected Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed Muslim immigration ban as \u201cnot reflective of America\u2019s fundamental values. \u201d He added: \u201cMany Muslim Americans have served valiantly in our military and made the ultimate sacrifice. Captain Khan was one such brave example. His sacrifice  \u2014   and that of Khizr and Ghazala Khan  \u2014   should always be honored. Period. \u201d Mr. McCain followed with a lengthy statement on Monday, saying: \u201cI cannot emphasize enough how deeply I disagree with Mr. Trump\u2019s statement. I hope Americans understand that the remarks do not represent the views of our Republican Party, its officers or candidates. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562147.8292298}
