[Safran told The Hollywood Reporter this week that the remaining episodes of Season 2 see the show becoming \u201ca little bit of a West Wing junior,\u201d and will soon tackle fake news.  THR reports: \u201cIn coming weeks, the show\u2019s version of Trump, which Safran describes as a parallel   but not a mirror image, will make his entrance, bringing with him more    versions of Steve Bannon, Paul Ryan and other members of Trump\u2019s inner circle. And Hunter Parrish (Weeds, Good Girls Revolt) has joined the series as first son Clayton Haas, a political strategist whom Safran likens to former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau. \u201d Quantico, which previously took a swipe at Trump in its first season, has seen a steep drop in ratings  \u2014   nearly 50 percent  \u2014   since its Season 2 opener on September 25. Ratings improved, but only slightly, after ABC moved the series from Sunday to Monday. The most recent episode drew a paltry 0.  in the ratings and 3. 31 million total viewers, well behind NBC\u2019s Taken and CBS\u2019s Scorpion in the same  . But Safran insists that he\u2019s not preoccupied by ratings or if Quantico will be renewed for a third season. Instead, Safran is working to make the show as good as possible. Upcoming episodes will reportedly include storylines about fake news and a debate over a Muslim registry. \u201cRegardless, the show will either come back or it won\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cI highly doubt we\u2019re going to double in the ratings and I also highly doubt we\u2019re going to lose half of our audience. I\u2019m blissfully ignorant and just keeping my head down trying to make the show as strong as possible. \u201d Safran also told THR he thinks it is \u201cprobably unlikely\u201d that Trump supporters are watching the show. \u201cIt\u2019s a show about inclusion and where the women have what would have been typically male roles. It\u2019s all about people of color working together to do what\u2019s right,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe believe in women in power and everyone\u2019s equal and freedom for all. We don\u2019t exactly stand for Trumpian instincts by our very nature. \u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll probably find that 24: Legacy and partially Designated Survivor, which takes more of a bipartisan look at things, have more of a viewership that voted for Trump or who are   than us,\u201d he added.
