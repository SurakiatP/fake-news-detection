Where is the humour in humiliating slaughtered animals? @ChrisGPackham pic. twitter.   \u2014   Anneka Svenska (@AnnekaSvenska) May 5, 2017,  At first, internet users suspected McElwain as the man in the photo because his toothy smile looked a lot like the man in the photo. \u201cI don\u2019t know who it is, but it isn\u2019t me,\u201d McElwain said at a press conference Tuesday with his wife by his side. Then, internet users turned their attention to Liautaud, the Jimmy John\u2019s founder, because he has a toothy grin and a penchant for hunting game. According to a 2015 Chicago Tribune article, Liautaud talked about his love of hunting animals from rhinoceroses to elephants and posing with them in photos. \u201cI choose to hunt and I choose to fish,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything I\u2019ve done has been totally legal. And the meat has been eaten, if not by me than by someone I\u2019m with. I don\u2019t hunt big African game anymore. \u201d A spokesperson for Jimmy John\u2019s however, denied these accusations, saying the man is not Liautaud and is not affiliated with Jimmy John\u2019s. As curiosity about the photo continues to circulate social media, the mystery about the mysterious man\u2019s identity is growing.'"}, "time": 1742563035.7736013}
