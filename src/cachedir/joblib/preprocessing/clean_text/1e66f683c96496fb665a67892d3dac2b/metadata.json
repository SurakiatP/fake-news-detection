But you can completely dismiss anything she has said in public. Wikileaks also revealed that Clinton admitted to the National Multi-housing Council in a private speech that \u201c you need both a public and a private position. \u201d \\nHillary Clinton\u2019s private position has been exposed. She is the Wall Street candidate promising them the ability to set their own rules. Now, unsurprisingly, they have endorsed her. \\nOn October 24, 2013, Clinton told Goldman Sachs that Dodd-Frank had to be done mostly for \u201c political reasons \u201d because Congress needed to \u201c look like \u201d it was doing something about the crisis. \\nBehind closed doors, she assured the bankers she was on their side, saying,\u201c There\u2019s nothing magic about regulations, too much is bad, too little is bad. How do you get to the golden key, how do we figure out what works? And the people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry. \u201d \\nMusic to Wall Street\u2019s ears \\n\u201c I mean, right now, there are so many places in our country where the banks are not doing what they need to do because they\u2019re scared of regulations, they\u2019re scared of the other shoe dropping, they\u2019re just plain scared, so credit is not flowing the way it needs to to restart economic growth, \u201d Clinton said. \u201c So people are, you know, a little \u2014 they\u2019re still uncertain, and they\u2019re uncertain both because they don\u2019t know what might come next in terms of regulations, but they\u2019re also uncertain because of changes in a global economy that we\u2019re only beginning to take hold of. \u201d \\nFor Goldman Sachs and the other big banks, was there really any other choice this cycle? After all, they did pay Hillary Clinton $675,000 for those three speeches, and have generously supported her political career. \\nConsidering the pay-for-play environment in the Clinton world, the real question is: what do Blankfein and Goldman Sachs want in return and what is Clinton\u2019s private position on giving it to them?'"}, "time": 1742628568.5469265}
