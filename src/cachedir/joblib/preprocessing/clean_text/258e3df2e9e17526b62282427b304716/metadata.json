Trump\u2019s book, announcing a   euro border fence to \u201censure credible control of [the] eastern border of the European Union\u201d. [EurActiv reports that the \u20ac30 million project will be funded largely from the European Union (EU) budget, to which the UK contributes a net \u00a3200 million every week.  Skvernelis claims the fence, which will be erected against the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, will \u201cfirst of all, ensure our economic security\u201d while \u201calso solving issues when it comes to illegal migration\u201d. Far from being disappointed by the project, Russian state media reports Kaliningrad\u2019s governor as being eager to secure contracts for the building materials which the   project will require. The Baltic republic is not a popular destination for migrants, with asylum seekers resettled there from camps in Greece and Turkey complaining that state benefits are not so generous as in Germany or Sweden and attempting to escape to wealthier EU members. Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskait\u0117 has predicted an increase in the number of migrants taking alternative routes into western Europe now that the EU signed a controversial six billion euro deal to stem the flow from Turkey. The Turkey deal has been a partial success in terms of reducing overall numbers, but the transfer arrangements it included have seen more than three times as many migrants forwarded to the EU as have been returned to Turkey, and the Turkish president looks set to terminate it if his own EU membership bid is not accelerated. \u201cOne should not be afraid to say that Europe has to be closed, at least temporarily, especially for economic migrants,\u201d Grybauskait\u0117 told broadcaster LRT. \u201cThe protection of the EU\u2019s external borders should be the European solution. \u201d Lithuania\u2019s announcement on the fence comes as the United States\u2019s incoming president denounced the migrant crisis as a \u201ccatastrophic mistake\u201d on the part of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, congratulating the British public on their decision to leave an EU which he sums up as \u201cbasically a vehicle for Germany\u201d. Prior to Trump\u2019s election victory, Merkel\u2019s foreign minister commented that \u201cbuilding walls is a very bad idea  \u2014   no matter who pays for them\u201d.'"}, "time": 1742561771.9374495}
