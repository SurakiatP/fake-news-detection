After slamming into the veteran\\'s car, the men told an off-duty police officer, \"I did it on purpose. It was in the name of Allah.\" \\nScott Alcala was going to play a round of golf with his father when the attack occurred. \\nAlcala had to act quickly and swerve into oncoming traffic in an attempt to avoid a Chevy Suburban that was headed straight for him. \\n\"I saw the suburban coming right at me about to T-bone right into the driver door and I thought that was it,\" he said. \"A second later I turned my head and just smashed into the barrier.\" \\nBoth men survived and no one else was involved. However, Acala says an off-duty police officer went to check on the other man. \\n\"The off-duty police officer went to talk to the other driver in his vehicle and he said, \\'Are you alright? That was way too fast,\\' and (the driver) said \\'I did it on purpose,\" Acala recalled. \"It was in the name of Allah.\\'\" \\nFox 26 reports : \\nThe police report says driver Ameer Abbaf Fakhraldin told police the collision was caused by Donald Trump\\'s improper treatment of minorities, and by Allah and other people\\'s lack of faith in him. Fakhraldin estimated his speed was 100 miles per hour. He also told police he caused the crash by using psychic / telekinetic powers to control the steering. The officer at the scene said the driver showed apathy and neglected interest. \\nPolice haven\\'t specified if this was an act of terrorism but Alcala thinks it was. \\n\"There was no remorse,\" Acala said. \"He just went back to his car nonchalant, pulled out a water bottle and just posted up.\" \\n\"He was just trying to target as many people as he could,\" he added. \"He was just trying to cause a pile up. It wasn\\'t me personally. It was as if someone were to throw a bomb in the middle of downtown, it\\'s no different, it\\'s the same thinking.\" \\nMr. Acala then added that as a veteran, having fought over seas, this makes him feel like he is encountering a war zone in his homeland. \\n\"Coming back from Afghanistan, thinking I\\'m on home soil I\\'m safe now\u2026 just shouldn\\'t have to worry about something like that you know,\" he said. \\nDid you hear this in the mainstream media? I\\'m guessing you didn\\'t. After all, they are too busy cover for Islamic jihadists , right? shares'"}, "time": 1742561936.9837716}
