Mr. Trump\u2019s speech  \u2014   and the balloons that follow his acceptance of the Republican nomination  \u2014   kicked off the final phase in his quest for the presidency. Some of the highlights of the night:  \u2022 A taste from our main story on Mr. Trump\u2019s speech (and check out what we   in it): \u2022 Ivanka Trump offered a softer, less harsh portrait of her father in a speech introducing him. She said that as a daughter and an employee of the Trump Organization, she \u201cwitnessed his empathy and generosity. \u201d She said Mr. Trump is \u201c  and gender neutral. He hires the best person for the job, period. \u201d And she pledged that Mr. Trump will fight for \u201cequal pay for equal work,\u201d noting that at Mr. Trump\u2019s company, there are \u201cmore female than male executives\u201d and that \u201cwhen a woman becomes a mother, she is supported, not shut out. \u201d Her father, she promised, will be \u201cyour greatest, your truest and your most loyal champion. \u201d _____ \u2022 \u201cI am proud to be gay. I am proud to be a Republican. \u201d Peter Thiel, the billionaire Silicon Valley venture capitalist and entrepreneur, took the Republican Party to task over what he called \u201cfake culture wars. \u201d He recalled that when he was a kid, the great debate was defeating the Soviet Union, but \u201cnow we are told that the great debate is about who gets to use which bathroom. \u201d Focusing on these debates, he said, \u201cdistract us from our economic decline, and nobody in this race is being honest about it except Donald Trump. \u201d Fact Check: Among Mr. Thiel\u2019s claims was that \u201cour government is broken. Our nuclear bases still use floppy disks. \u201d That, in fact, is true, according to a report by the General Accounting Office this year. According to the report: \u201cDepartment of Defense uses   floppy disks in a legacy system that coordinates the operational functions of the nation\u2019s nuclear forces. \u201d _____ \u2022 Jerry Falwell Jr. the evangelical leader of the top Christian university, made both a   and populist case for Mr. Trump, calling him a \u201c  billionaire\u201d who he has known for over 20 years. His evangelical argument for Mr. Trump centered on a plank in the platform to repeal a tax law banning churches from political organizing, as well as a pledge to appoint \u201cconservative,   justices\u201d to the Supreme Court. And he included perhaps a thinly veiled message to Senator Ted Cruz, who spoke last night and declined to endorse Mr. Trump: \u201cIf you are a conservative, a decision not to vote or to vote for a third candidate is a de facto vote for Hillary Clinton. \u201d _____ \u2022 With the playful tone of a wedding toast, Tom Barrack, a billionaire businessman and longtime friend of Mr. Trump, used most of his speech to share stories and memories. He told the crowd that he had \u201cnothing negative to say about Hillary\u201d and \u201conly amazing things to tell you about Donald. \u201d His personal anecdotes revealed a    unseen side of the Mr. Trump that few other speakers touched on during the convention. _____ \u2022 Joe Arpaio\u2019s support for Mr. Trump might be boiled down to this: You had me at illegal immigrant. Mr. Arpaio is the Arizona sheriff who became famous for his aggressive,   tactics in that state. And Mr. Trump started his campaign more than a year ago by focusing on the danger that illegal immigrants pose to Americans. On Thursday, Mr. Arpaio said his experience at the border convinced him that \u201cwe have terrorists coming over our borders, infiltrating our communities and causing massive destruction and mayhem. \u201d He said Mr. Trump was the only candidate willing to confront that issue. _____ \u2022 Representative Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee struck a mostly optimistic note amid remarks that focused on problems. She proclaimed that electing Mr. Trump would return the country to greatness and spoke broadly about Mr. Trump\u2019s leadership qualities and record as a businessman who \u201chas seen challenges\u201d and \u201clearned his lessons. \u201d And with a turn of phrase, linked his real estate successes to the potential of a Trump presidency: \u201cNot only can they change a skyline, they can change the world. \u201d _____ \u2022 Mary Fallin, the governor of Oklahoma,   the pattern of pessimism, but she said that Mr. Trump is the one to provide optimism  \u2014   even if some Republicans might not agree with everything he says. \u201cAs Ronald Reagan said, \u2018the person who agrees with you 80 percent of the time is a friend and ally,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u2022 Reince Preibus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, hammered Mrs. Clinton for a lack of personal and professional ethics. She \u201clied over and over and over and over\u201d about her email server, he said. \u201cPerhaps worst of all, Hillary Clinton has perfected the art of politics for personal gain. She reads ethics rules as carefully as Americans read their junk mail. \u201d He accused Mrs. Clinton of using her position as secretary of state to \u201cgrease the wheels for Democrat lobbyists, special interests and political insiders connected to the corrupt Clinton machine. \u201d With Mr. Trump, he said, \u201chelp is coming. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564375.1668916}
