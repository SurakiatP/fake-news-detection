CNN has terminated our agreement with Kathy Griffin to appear on our New Year\u2019s Eve program.  \u2014   CNN Communications (@CNNPR) May 31, 2017,  Griffin had   CNN\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve Live broadcast each January since 2007 alongside the network\u2019s lead anchor, Anderson Cooper. Cooper took to Twitter late Tuesday night to say he was \u201cappalled\u201d by his  \u2019s photo. \u201cFor the record, I am appalled by the photo shoot Kathy Griffin took part in,\u201d the Anderson Cooper 360 host wrote. \u201cIt is clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate. \u201d The shocking photograph, first published by TMZ Tuesday morning, was taken during a photo shoot conducted by the    My Life on the   comedian and Los   artist and photographer Tyler Shields, who is reportedly known for his provocative work. The photo caused a firestorm online, where it quickly circulated and led to calls for a boycott of Griffin\u2019s work, including her current   comedy tour. The comedian apologized in a brief video posted to her Twitter account Tuesday, saying she had \u201ccrossed the line\u201d and that the image had gone \u201ctoo far. \u201d CNN\u2019s termination of its relationship with Griffin is the latest in the continuing fallout over the image. On Wednesday, ADT  \u2014   the largest home security company in North America  \u2014   announced it would pull its advertising from CNN over the photo, while the Route 66 Casino in Albuquerque, New Mexico announced it had cancelled Griffin\u2019s upcoming performance, which had been scheduled for June 16. The U. S. Secret Service is also reportedly investigating the circumstances surrounding the photo shoot. President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump responded to the image Wednesday, with the president saying in a message on his Twitter account that the photograph and its resultant coverage has been particularly hard on his    son, Barron. The First Lady called the photograph \u201cvery disturbing\u201d and \u201csimply wrong\u201d in a separate statement.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum'"}, "time": 1742628568.7378051}
