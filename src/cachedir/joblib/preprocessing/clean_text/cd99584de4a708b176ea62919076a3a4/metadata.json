Trump was unqualified, temperamentally unfit and a threat to the republic who should never be president. For years, Mr. Trump questioned Mr. Obama\u2019s birthplace and legitimacy, branded the nation\u2019s first black president weak and called his tenure a disaster. On Thursday at the White House, the   happened: The two men met face to face for the first time for a   discussion in the Oval Office and shook hands, making a public show of putting their bitter differences aside. \u201cI want to emphasize to you, Mr.   that we now are going to want to do everything we can to help you succeed because if you succeed, then the country succeeds,\u201d Mr. Obama told Mr. Trump after the meeting as the two sat side by side two days after Mr. Trump\u2019s stunning election upset imperiled Mr. Obama\u2019s legacy. The president called the conversation \u201cexcellent\u201d and said he had been \u201cencouraged\u201d by Mr. Trump\u2019s interest in working with him and his team. Mr. Trump, who appeared nervous and uncharacteristically subdued beside Mr. Obama, called the president \u201ca good man. \u201d He said that the meeting was \u201ca great honor\u201d and that their conversation had lasted far longer than he would have expected. \u201cI have great respect,\u201d Mr. Trump said, turning to face Mr. Obama. \u201cWe discussed a lot of different situations, some wonderful, and some difficulties. I very much look forward to dealing with the president in the future, including counsel. \u201d Given that Mr. Trump has never held elective office or served in government, some administration aides suggest that Mr. Obama could play a    role in acquainting Mr. Trump with the demands of the office. \u201cThe meeting might\u2019ve been at least a little less awkward than some might have expected,\u201d Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said. Aides said that the two men discussed foreign and domestic policy issues that Mr. Trump would need to deal with on Day 1 in the Oval Office. As early as Friday, the   will get a version of the President\u2019s Daily Brief, a classified compilation of all threats facing the United States and other highly significant intelligence information. Mr. Trump\u2019s trip was surreal for many Republicans and Democrats in Washington, who never expected to see the real estate executive and reality television star in an Oval Office meeting to begin preparations to lead the most powerful nation in the world. Mr. Trump, whose campaign drew support from white supremacist groups, sat just in front of a bust of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in the Oval Office. Outside in the Rose Garden, reporters could see Denis R. McDonough, the White House chief of staff, emerge from the West Wing talking in hushed tones with Jared Kushner, the  \u2019s    and adviser. The two then headed off for a stroll around the South Lawn. Nearby, aides to Mr. Trump snapped photographs of one another in the White House colonnade, standing in the spot where a crowd of shocked White House aides, some openly crying, had watched the day before as Mr. Obama called for national unity after Mr. Trump\u2019s victory. The Oval Office meeting was the centerpiece of a marathon day in the capital for Mr. Trump, his first since winning the presidency. His wife, Melania, had tea with Michelle Obama in the White House residence and took in the view of the Washington Monument from the Truman Balcony. White House aides said the two women talked about raising children in the White House. \u201cWe want to make sure that they feel welcome as they prepare to make this transition,\u201d Mr. Obama said of the Trumps. Later on Capitol Hill, after meeting with Republican congressional leaders who will hold sway over enacting his agenda, Mr. Trump strode with Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the House speaker, to a balcony overlooking the platform on the west side of the Capitol where he will be sworn in on Jan. 20, 2017, peering out to the National Mall below. \u201cReally, really beautiful,\u201d he said of the view. The   arrived in the late morning from New York at Reagan National Airport in his trademark jet with the name Trump emblazoned on its side, and then rode with his wife in a black, armored sport utility vehicle in a motorcade that moved swiftly through Washington. By midafternoon, crowds had gathered on a crisp autumn day on both sides of Pennsylvania Avenue next to the Trump International Hotel, where barricades were set up. Police officers were lined up on motorcycles, officers on horses patrolled the area, and tourists taking photographs mingled with camera crews. Mr. Trump and his wife had lunch with Mr. Ryan at the Capitol Hill Club, a peace summit meeting after Mr. Ryan had offered tepid support for the Republican nominee during the campaign and Mr. Trump had branded him a \u201cweak and ineffective leader,\u201d threatening retribution. Later, after a meeting in Mr. Ryan\u2019s office in the Capitol, Mr. Trump said that he was excited to begin carrying out an agenda to address immigration, health care and tax cuts. Investors, apparently buoyed by the prospect of those tax cuts as well as increased infrastructure spending, sent the Dow Jones industrial average to a record high on Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do some absolutely spectacular things for the American people,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to lower taxes, as you know, we\u2019re going to fix health care and make it more affordable and better. We\u2019re going to do a real job for the public. \u201d Mr. Trump also met for about an hour with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader. \u201cWe are looking at jobs,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters as he left. \u201c  jobs. \u201d The meetings unfolded as members of Mr. Obama\u2019s staff were starting the business of handing over the vast bureaucracy of the federal government to Mr. Trump\u2019s staff. Speculation swirled over possible appointments in the Trump administration, with Stephen K. Bannon, the conservative provocateur and Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign chief, and Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, being mentioned as possible picks for chief of staff. Top advisers to Mr. Obama have spent months preparing for the transition, a complex venture condensed into the 72   before the inauguration. It is up to them and the Trump team to set it in motion, pairing Obama administration staff members with representatives of the   for crash courses in the workings of the White House and federal agencies. Mr. Obama said Wednesday that he had instructed his staff to follow the example set by President George W. Bush in 2008 and provide a professional and smooth transition for Mr. Trump\u2019s team, despite the policy differences that separate the president and his successor. For all the public drama and division of the presidential campaign, Mr. Obama\u2019s aides have since July been quietly working with advisers to Hillary Clinton and Mr. Trump to plan for the passing of power. But the crush of information may be onerous, particularly when it comes to Mr. Trump\u2019s task of hiring 4, 000 political appointees over a matter of weeks. Saddled with an antiquated personnel system when Mr. Obama was elected in 2008, his aides moved this year to build a new one designed to make it easier to track the positions, as well as the applicants and their personal and professional information. In December, Mr. Obama\u2019s team plans to hold the first of two   exercises to prepare Mr. Trump and his staff for a potential national security crisis. The second simulation for Mr. Trump is set for January, days before he officially gains access to the nuclear codes.'"}, "time": 1742564030.1038575}
