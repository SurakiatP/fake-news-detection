Moira Smith said Justice Clarence Thomas groped her at her boss\\' dinner party when she was 23. \\n\"That willingness by men in power to take advantage of vulnerable women relies on an unspoken pact that the women will not speak up about it,\" Smith, now 41, told the journal. \\n\"Why? Because they are vulnerable. Because they are star-struck. Because they don\\'t want to be whiners. Because they worry about their career if they do speak out. But silence no longer feels defensible; it feels complicit,\u201d she stated. \\n\"As the mother of a young daughter and son, I am coming forward to show that it is important to stand up for yourself and tell the truth,\" Smith said. \\nThomas was nominated to the top court in 1991 by Republican President George H.W. Bush. Loading ...'"}, "time": 1742561694.063803}
