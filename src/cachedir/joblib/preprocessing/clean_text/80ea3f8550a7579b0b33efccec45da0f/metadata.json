{"duration": 0.12715530395507812, "input_args": {"text": "'There are more than 160 swear words in Andy Weir\u2019s   thriller, \u201cThe Martian,\u201d including two memorably deployed   in the novel\u2019s first three sentences. The profanity did not strike Mr. Weir as excessive when he wrote the book nearly a decade ago. After all, the story\u2019s narrator, an astronaut named Mark Watney, is stranded alone on Mars with a dwindling supply of food and a rescue mission that is four years away  \u2014   circumstances that warrant constant cursing. But shortly after the book came out, Mr. Weir started hearing from a subset of readers who objected to the obscenities. \u201cI got a lot of emails from science teachers who said, \u2018Man I\u2019d love to use your book as a teaching aid, but there\u2019s so much profanity in it that we can\u2019t really do that,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Weir, 44, who is cheerful,   and casually profane, much like his protagonist. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get that by a school board. \u201d Apart from the   words, \u201cThe Martian\u201d is a science teacher\u2019s dream text. It\u2019s a gripping survival story that hinges on the hero\u2019s ability to solve a series of complex problems, using his knowledge of physics, chemistry, astronomy and math, in order to stay alive on a hostile planet. (The Washington Post called the novel \u201can advertisement for the importance of STEM education. \u201d) After getting dozens of inquiries from teachers, Mr. Weir, who describes himself as \u201ca lifelong space nerd,\u201d asked his publisher, Crown, if they could release a   edition of the book. The novel was pretty easy to amend, by simply replacing the foul language with tamer words like \u201cscrewed,\u201d \u201cjerk\u201d and \u201ccrap\u201d (Mr. Weir said there were \u201coccasional squabbles\u201d when he tried to lobby the censors to keep some of the less offensive swear words in.) A   version came out last year, and it is now being used to help teach science in classrooms around the country. At Synergy Quantum Academy, a public charter high school in South Los Angeles, students are conducting experiments based on the novel. In physics class, students will build miniature   cars, and during astronomy next month, they will try to grow potatoes as Watney did, using a chamber modeled on NASA\u2019s Lunar Plant Growth Chamber. Eighth graders at Oak Middle School in Los Alamitos, Calif. are following a yearlong curriculum based on \u201cThe Martian,\u201d with lesson plans that use dramatic moments in the narrative to illustrate concepts like Newton\u2019s laws of motion, chemical reactions and spacecraft engineering. In a science class at Northwestern High School in Mellette, S. D. sophomores are using the novel as a   point for some   experiments, like splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen. \u201cIt\u2019s really exciting for them to see the connection between the novel and the science they\u2019re learning,\u201d said Denise Clemens, a science teacher at Northwestern. \u201cHopefully we\u2019re not going to blow anything up. \u201d Her students seem happy to have an alternative to dry science textbooks. \u201cIt\u2019s been a really good way to understand ionic compounds and bonds and all the things you can do with chemistry,\u201d Jarret Haven, 16, said of studying \u201cThe Martian. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s really opened up my mind. \u201d For Mr. Weir and his publisher, getting the book into schools opens up a lucrative new market that could turn \u201cThe Martian,\u201d which was already a blockbuster that sold several million copies, into a perennial best seller that guarantees a   audience every year. Mr. Weir did not set out to write a science textbook. A college dropout and former software engineer who is fascinated by space exploration, Mr. Weir started writing \u201cThe Martian\u201d in 2009, mainly to entertain himself. The story grew out of a thought experiment, when Mr. Weir began imagining what a scientifically feasible manned mission to Mars would look like. The story took shape as Mr. Weir tried to work out what it would take to get to Mars, and how to keep a stranded astronaut alive on the planet (the creative use of duct tape is key). \u201cOftentimes, when I was   the math, I would discover problems that I hadn\u2019t thought of that Watney would run into,\u201d he said. He wrote computer software to work out what the constant thrust trajectories would be for the spaceship\u2019s ion engine, and studied NASA satellite images to map out Watney\u2019s treacherous   kilometer course across Mars in a rover. He also calculated how many calories Watney would need to stay alive, how much water he would need to grow potatoes, and how he could manufacture water out of oxygen and hydrazine, a compound used for rocket fuel. Mr. Weir had failed to sell an earlier attempt at a novel, so rather than trying to get \u201cThe Martian\u201d published, he serialized it for free on his website. Some of his fans urged him to list it on Amazon, and he began selling it for 99 cents. He quickly sold 35, 000 copies, and started getting inquiries from publishers and agents. Crown bought the novel and published it in 2014. A feature film adaptation, directed by Ridley Scott and starring Matt Damon as Watney, came out the next year and grossed more than $630 million worldwide. The novel sold more than three million copies, and has racked up more than 29, 500 reviews on Amazon. Crown has printed nearly 30, 000 copies of the classroom edition, which comes with a teacher\u2019s guide that lists discussion questions and activities and includes an interview with Mr. Weir about the science behind the story. Next month, Mr. Weir will address science teachers at the National Science Teachers Association\u2019s conference in Los Angeles, and his publisher will give away around 500 copies of the classroom edition of the \u201cThe Martian. \u201d David Beck, a science teacher at Oak Middle School, was one of the teachers who lobbied Mr. Weir for a sanitized version of the story. After he first read \u201cThe Martian\u201d two years ago, Mr. Beck immediately wanted to create a curriculum based on the novel. \u201cI thought, I could teach all of my   physical science out of this book,\u201d he said. He proposed using the novel in his class to the school\u2019s principal, who loved the idea but thought the foul language could be a problem. They approached the district school board to see if they could assign the novel to students, and were turned down. (They even considered buying copies of the novel and redacting the swear words by hand with markers, but decided against it.) Mr. Beck then emailed Mr. Weir and later, his publisher, and asked if they had considered releasing a PG edition for students. At that point, similar requests were piling up. Crown wanted to wait until after the movie adaptation came out, to avoid confusing retailers and readers. When Broadway Books, a Crown imprint, published the school edition in 2016, Mr. Beck created a yearlong curriculum for the school\u2019s 380 eighth graders, who each got a copy of the book. So far, the students have been enthusiastic, and many have finished the novel ahead of schedule. Some teachers are skeptical that students need to be shielded from the profanity in \u201cThe Martian. \u201d Marc Montalbano, an English teacher at Tottenville High School in Staten Island, said he was using the original version of \u201cThe Martian\u201d with his seniors, who are also drawing on the text for science research projects. Watney\u2019s swearing makes him seem more relatable as a character and helps offset the heavy science, Mr. Montalbano said in an email. Nora Groft, a high school English teacher at Northwestern, said she taught the classroom edition of \u201cThe Martian,\u201d but told her students that a version with more adult language was available, too, and that the curse words might be appropriate, given the context. \u201cImagine if you were stranded on Mars,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you think you\u2019d say, \u2018Goshdarnit\u2019?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742562053.4737678}
