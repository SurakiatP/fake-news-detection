It is the second act of domestic terrorism to take place in the United States in the past day, coming just two hours after Trump supporters in Mississippi set a historically African-American church on fire and spray-painted \u201cVOTE TRUMP\u201d on it. \\nDonald Trump has begun a movement, indeed \u2013 a movement of hatred and violence that has now lead to multiple deaths, thousands of dollars in property damage, and unquantifiable emotional trauma across the nation as Latinos, blacks, Muslims, and sexual assault survivors are forced to bear the brunt of the gaslit firestorm that Trump ignites with his bullying and his dog-whistles. \\nAs we draw closer to election day, these kinds of incidents are going to increase in frequency \u2013 and god only knows what will happen when he loses.'"}, "time": 1742628556.8689368}
