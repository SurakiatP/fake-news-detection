Putin, Russia\u2019s president, hardly misses a chance to talk tough on terrorism, once famously saying he would find Chechen terrorists sitting in the \u201couthouse\u201d and \u201crub them out. \u201d He and President Trump, notably dismissive of political correctness, would seem to have found common language on fighting terrorism  \u2014   except on one point of, well, language. During his campaign, Mr. Trump associated Islam with terrorism and criticized President Obama for declining to use the phrase \u201cradical Islamic terrorism. \u201d However, Mr. Putin, whom Mr. Trump so openly admires for his toughness, has, for more than a decade, done exactly what President Obama did. He has never described terrorists as \u201cIslamic\u201d and has repeatedly gone out of his way to denounce such language. \u201cI would prefer Islam not be mentioned in vain alongside terrorism,\u201d he said at a news conference in December, answering a question about the Islamic State, a group he often refers to as \u201cthe   Islamic State,\u201d to emphasize a distinction with the Islamic religion. At the opening of a mosque in Moscow in 2015, Mr. Putin spoke of terrorists who \u201ccynically exploit religious feelings for political aims. \u201d In the Middle East, Mr. Putin said at the mosque opening, \u201cterrorists from the   Islamic State are compromising a great world religion, compromising Islam, sowing hatred, killing people, including clergy,\u201d and added that \u201ctheir ideology is built on lies and blatant distortions of Islam. \u201d He was careful to add, \u201cMuslim leaders are bravely and fearlessly using their own influence to resist this extremist propaganda. \u201d And, this being Russia, the failure to adhere to this   interpretation is a prosecutable offense: The Russian news media are required by law to note in any mention of the Islamic State that the reference is to a banned terrorist organization of that name, lest it be misconstrued as denigrating religion. Mr. Putin does not take this stance to soothe the feelings of Western liberals, a group he dismisses as hypocritical in any case. \u201cPutin prides himself on Russia\u2019s intelligence capabilities,\u201d the Brookings Institution wrote in a study of the early formation of his counterterrorism policies. \u201cRussian leaders think they know their enemy,\u201d and it is not the governments of majority Muslim countries such as Iraq and Iran, or the majority of Muslims living in Russia. Instead, Russian counterterrorism strategy focused on financing and militarily backing moderate Muslim leaders, with the breakthrough in the Chechen war coming when the region\u2019s imam, Akhmad Kadyrov, allied with the Russian military. His son, Ramzan Kadyrov, leads the region today. While embracing Islamic leaders as a centerpiece of its counterterrorism strategy, however, the Kremlin did not avoid drawing distinctions along religious lines. The Russian government backed the Kadyrov family\u2019s campaign to revive traditional Sufi Islam in Chechnya as a counterweight to the more austere Wahhabi denomination professed by many separatists. The Wahhabi strain was outlawed in another restive, predominantly Muslim province, Dagestan, and its adherents are persecuted in Russia, rights groups say. Still, the alliance with moderate Islamic religious leaders became important in pacifying Chechnya and other North Caucasus regions, which have ceased to pose a serious security threat to Russia. \u201cPutin rules a multiconfessional country,\u201d Orkhan Dzhemal, a commentator on Islamic affairs, said in a telephone interview, noting that in the United States, in contrast, Muslims are not a powerful political force. \u201cHe cannot say \u2018Islamic terrorism\u2019 for a simple reason. He doesn\u2019t want to alienate millions of Russians. \u201d The term preferred in Russian political parlance is \u201cinternational terrorism. \u201d In a phone call on Friday, President Trump and Mr. Putin discussed \u201creal cooperation\u201d in fighting terrorist groups in Syria. They could agree on an enemy. But the Kremlin statement described a \u201cpriority placed on uniting forces in the fight against the main threat  \u2014   international terrorism. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564088.9386156}
