Here are five of his finest albums, released at   moments in his career, that show the artist, who was found dead, at 57, on Thursday, in his fullness: a cunning vocalist, a fiery musician, and a peerless songwriter and producer. This was Prince\u2019s third album, but the first on which his lusty   experimentalism was operating at full sweat levels. Playing and producing almost the whole album himself, he created a universe of unbridled id, from the hunger of \u201cWhen You Were Mine\u201d to the   incestual drive of \u201cSister,\u201d while also creating a   hybrid of new wave, flashy rock and   soul. Here is Prince at his orchestral best: \u201cPurple Rain\u201d is the first album he released with his backing band, the Revolution, and the one that cemented him as one of pop music\u2019s essential stars. \u201cPurple Rain\u201d is glorious, ecstatic, piercing, with anthems of quiet desperation (\u201cWhen Doves Cry\u201d) boundless energy (\u201cLet\u2019s Go Crazy\u201d) or both (\u201cI Would Die 4 U\u201d). Though the album was designed as a soundtrack for the film of the same name, it stands as one of the most important records in pop history. Here is Prince collecting material recorded over several years, showing off how his flamboyant, daring skill could tackle almost any sound or attitude of the day. The title track addressed a litany of societal ills, and \u201cIf I Was Your Girlfriend\u201d represented Prince at his carnal best. But those were only two extremes on an album full of them, one that showed the full scale of his ambition. By this stage of his career, Prince wasn\u2019t as loose as he\u2019d been in his early days, but he found ways of   his erotic impulses, which weren\u2019t weakened at all. On this album  \u2014   his first billed with the New Power Generation, then his backing band  \u2014   he made   pop \u201cCream,\u201d sly   on \u201cWilling and Able\u201d and clangorous   on \u201cGett Off. \u201d   Prince could be a hodgepodge  \u2014   after he split with his record label Warner Bros. in the   he pinballed among styles, releasing music at an idiosyncratic clip. \u201cMusicology,\u201d an album that is jubilant and grounded in Prince\u2019s   sonics, marked his return to the major label system, and also to controlled form. He also gave away copies of the album to people who bought tickets to his tour, showing that his skepticism of typical   practices remained high.'"}, "time": 1742628434.1834562}
