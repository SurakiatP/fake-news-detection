No Obama accomplishment will remain. They even have a name for the plan: The First Day Project. \\nOrganized by the Heritage Foundation, the goal is to deprive Obama of any lasting effect to his time in office. It\u2019s a perverse sort of vengeance from a group of clowns who have spent the last decade smearing the president at every possible step of the way. \\nTrump aides are organizing what one Republican close to the campaign calls the First Day Project. \u201cTrump spends several hours signing papers\u2014and erases the Obama Presidency,\u201d he said. Stephen Moore, an official campaign adviser who is a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, explained, \u201cWe want to identify maybe twenty-five executive orders that Trump could sign literally the first day in office.\u201d \\nThinking back over Obama\u2019s list of wins \u2013 from gay rights to healthcare to the economy \u2013 the idea that these achievements can be erased by a collective of spiteful, bitter men in a matter of hours is almost too much to bear. The suffering to the people whose rights will surely be rolled back will be immense. \\nAnd on a separate, but equally terrifying front, Trump\u2019s campaign surrogate Omarosa told reporters that Trump has been compiling an \u201cenemies list\u201d\u2013 an assortment of people on the right and left who openly stood against him \u2013 and he plans on punishing those on the list when he gets to office. \\n\u201cI would never judge anybody for exercising their right to and the freedom to choose who they want. But let me just tell you, Mr. Trump has a long memory and we\u2019re keeping a list.\u201d \\nErase his predecessor, punish his enemies. In this way, with pen and sword, Trump plans to dismantle a democracy. The oldest, greatest one in the world \u2013 up until the point when it wasn\u2019t. \\nFeatured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Share this Article!'"}, "time": 1742563392.7958195}
