[\u201cIt was one of the most powerful things I have ever seen,\u201d said Rep. Scott Taylor (R. .) who, with the   of former congressman Ryan Zinke as the Interior Secretary, becomes the only Navy SEAL veteran serving in Congress.  \u201cI was just blown away,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was obviously very strong, and obviously, my community is very proud of her. \u201d In his first address to a joint session of Congress, Trump singled out Owens as she sat next to the president\u2019s older daughter Ivanka Trump. \u201cRyan died as he lived,\u201d the president said as the standing ovation from the House floor and the packed galleries crescendoed for two minutes and the widow dressed in black alternated between looking to the president and the crowd and then up to Heaven. \u201cRyan\u2019s legacy is etched into eternity. \u201d Taylor said what Americans witnessed in the House of Representatives Tuesday evening was just a sample of the cost paid by less than one percent of the population. \u201cThat\u2019s a family that was committed, and they believed in what they were doing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a horrible thing, but it is also good for the nation to see that, because most of the nation has not joined into the sacrifice,\u201d he said. The congressman said he was with the president at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware, for the Feb. 1 ceremonial receiving of the remains of the fallen SEAL. \u201cEverybody was quiet,\u201d he said. \u201cThe president was right behind me, and I heard him say to himself: \u2018Man, this is really tough.\u2019 That\u2019s so important. Not just that he was there, but that he understands the costs as well, because of his decisions to send people into harm\u2019s way. \u201d Political opponents of the president have called the Yemen raid a \u201cbotched raid\u201d and used it as an example of Trump\u2019s failure as the   . \u201cOur community would prefer for it not to be a political football,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a shame \u2014  honestly \u2014  that some folks are trying to use it politically,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is bad for the legacy of Ryan and his family. \u201d Taylor said he traveled in and out of Yemen after his Navy career ended, and it is a troubled and complicated part of the world. Because of the terrorists, such as Al Qaeda and the Islamic State, as well as criminal elements in Yemen, it is worthy of select missions, but he would oppose a       invasion. The congressman said he has no issues with negative statements made in the press by the fallen SEAL\u2019s father, Bill Owens. Gold Star parents and Gold Star family members have the right to say whatever they want to say, given the price they paid, he said. Taylor spoke to Breitbart News moments after the president finished. It was the best speech he has heard the president give, he said. \u201cHe discussed unity, not only within the nation but within the parties,\u201d he added. It was excellent the way Trump called people to come together to do big things, he said. \u201cThat is why I am here, and that\u2019s what my Democratic peers in my freshman class want to do, too. I just hope the Democratic leadership wants the same thing. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562049.5756276}
