Not downtown. What does it mean? That for many, political activism means vandalizing private property and suppressing freedom of speech. (yours not theirs) \\nAn acquaintance who is in Chicago says his wife is voting for Hillary because it is time for a woman POTUS. He says he cannot speak about Trump at home or a riot starts, but says he is voting Trump because all Hillary\u2019s campaign does is attack Trump, no policy. AT LEAST Trump has a plan. When I mention Benghazi, he says he is sorry about military casualties but those who enlist know the risks. I guess that it was diplomats running guns for Obama, doesn\u2019t matter, \\nSo these are mature people who run a business (3 rd generation), and this what filters through to them. This is the level of comprehension. So he volunteered the info that he was voting for Trump, and I do not abuse him or speak excessively about politics with him, and I forget what we were chatting about when it came up. He says he goes to church regularly and considers himself \u2018religious\u2019, but when speaking to him, he is pretty fuzzy about what the Bible says about forgiveness. If Trump loses and then buys an island and starts a country, I\u2019d be interested in the costs involved. If Trump loses this country will not offer much of a future for my kids or grandchildren.'"}, "time": 1742564168.8958323}
