When asked about press \u201csmugness,\u201d Woodward said, \u201cYes. I think that is a giant problem. On television particularly, you will see a White House correspondent deliver a report and then say \u2018the Trump White House said  \u2026    \u2019 and then there\u2019s a kind of smug smile, which is the correspondent undermining what the White House says. And there may be grounds for that, but it should be reported. It should be straight. \u201d He added, \u201cI think there are so many people that are treating the Trump presidency as if it\u2019s a tryout \u2014  as if it\u2019s provisional. I was reading a column this morning that said Trump half won the presidency because he did not get the popular vote. He is president. Odds are he is probably going to be president for a full term, four years and maybe even more. There is hyperventilation. There is this kind of sense of too many people writing things like \u2014  when is the impeachment coming, how long will it last, will he make it through the summer, and so forth. No, there may be stuff that comes out, but it has to be hard evidence. I worry for the business and I worry for the perception of the business by people, not to just Trump supporters, but people that see that kind of smugness that they are talking about. You know, he was elected, the Constitution says he gets a full term. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742628600.3075182}
