Volunteers have ripped out moldy wallboard. Two small chandeliers hung over the bones of the living and dining rooms, the furniture and the carpeting long gone. On the kitchen counter lay a patchwork of family photographs, their vibrant colors washed away, and a book  \u2014   \u201cHurricane Floyd and the Flood of the Century\u201d  \u2014   saved from the water. Hurricane Floyd, which roared through here in 1999, was supposed to be just that: a     event that caused flooding the likes of which this town\u2019s residents would never see again. But that perception was shattered in early October when Hurricane Matthew barreled inland and sent water pouring around a levee built along the Tar River and into the town, inundating hundreds of homes, including Ms. Cobb\u2019s. Seventeen years ago, Ms. Cobb decided to rebuild, here in a town that has a special place in American history. Princeville, population 2, 100, is believed to be the oldest town chartered by freed slaves, who founded a community that has survived numerous floods and the Jim Crow era. It remains 96 percent black. Ms. Cobb, 69, is now considering a question looming over many homeowners: After two devastating floods, does she want the option to sell her home to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, something that the town\u2019s leaders voted down in 1999, fearing it would lead to the end of their community? \u201cThis is home, this is what I know,\u201d said Ms. Cobb, who was leaning toward staying but worried about taking out a loan to rebuild. \u201cI really don\u2019t know. \u201d A number of residents have expressed an interest in selling to FEMA, which would prevent anyone from building again on their   land and lead to a reduction in the town\u2019s tax base. The town\u2019s four commissioners will vote at some point on whether to make that available to residents (the mayor votes in case of a tie). They can also consider elevation of homes and reconstruction of damaged ones. Residents on the nation\u2019s coasts and along inland waterways have assessed storm damage and wondered if they should relocate  \u2014   a painful and fairly uncommon form of hazard mitigation known as retreat. Here, the consideration has a wrenching historical dimension. This is where a freed slave, Turner Prince, established Freedom Hill in 1865, which became Princeville 20 years later, a town where extended families have proudly lived for generations. And many of them are determined to rebuild. This stretch along the Tar River is no stranger to flooding, and some say that it is probably the reason that   were able to settle the land in the first place. White landowners in the 19th century did not want it. \u201cTheir existence in this space was not a matter of chance or choice, but instead the discarded and unwanted space was what former slaveholders allowed them to occupy,\u201d Richard M. Mizelle, Jr. an associate professor of history at the University of Houston, wrote earlier this year, tying Princeville\u2019s location to environmental racism  \u2014   the relegation of black people to   land and hazardous areas that expose them to greater levels of pollution. But many people are proud of what they have built here, and how it has endured. \u201cThe freed slaves made it what it is,\u201d said Mayor Bobbie Jones, 55, who wants the levee improved and opposes the buyouts and hopes residents who want to leave will first seek private buyers, perhaps like himself. \u201cIf we decide to allow individuals to participate in the buyout, it will have a devastating effect,\u201d Mr. Jones said, standing in front of more than 100 residents at a recent meeting. Other   towns like Eatonville, Fla. which was incorporated in 1887, still exist today. Many others have faded, like Nicodemus, Kan. which has about 25 residents, or Blackdom, N. M. which was abandoned after a drought. \u201cI\u2019m fighting so hard to make sure that Princeville is not one of the casualties,\u201d Mr. Jones said. \u201cIt would be a devastating tragedy, not only for me, but for the world. \u201d Still, residents like Angela   46, want at least the option to move beyond this   land. \u201cThat history will never be lost,\u201d said Ms.   whose small white house filled with floodwater after Matthew. The town\u2019s founders, she said, would have settled safer land if they had the chance. \u201cI really believe that they would want better for us,\u201d Ms.   said. In 1967, the Army Corps of Engineers completed a levee that held off floods until Hurricane Floyd\u2019s sent water over its top, forcing harrowing rooftop rescues  \u2014   including Mr. Jones\u2019s  \u2014   and damaging or ruining nearly every home here. The town leadership rejected taking buyouts at that time and instead chose to rebuild the town and fix the levee. Last year, the Corps of Engineers completed another proposal to extend the levee, which officials with the corps say would have at least reduced the latest destruction, but it has not been funded. The flood inundated community pillars like the school and the fire station  \u2014   which is currently operating out of a tent  \u2014   and left residents displaced and streets still piled with debris. \u201cSo many people have lost so much, and we\u2019ll have to start all over again,\u201d Linda Worsley, 66, a retired telephone company analyst, said as she picked up the mail at her uninhabitable home even as it was being demolished. Ms. Worsley is determined to rebuild on land that has been in her family since her grandfather, a sharecropper, and his brother bought it in the 1920s. Ms. Worsley, who as a commissioner voted against buyouts in 1999, said residents should have the option this time, although she hopes few people will take them. \u201cI have always been proud to say that I was from Princeville,\u201d Ms. Worsley said, adding, \u201cTo just lose all of that, it would be like Princeville is another lost colony. \u201d It was her job to organize the town\u2019s Christmas parade, which was scheduled for last Saturday but had to be canceled. Instead, Ms. Worsley and her neighbors gathered at the Quality Inn in Tarboro, which is across the Tar River from Princeville, for a lunch of pulled pork, chicken and green beans. So many displaced residents are staying at the hotel while they await FEMA trailers that it has become a stop for the school bus, its lobby a town square for Princeville residents. Mary Alston, a volunteer from Cary, N. C. put the question to Ms. Worsley and two of her friends, \u201cAre y\u2019all going to stay or   \u2026    \u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to stay,\u201d Annette Waller, 60, said. \u201cOh yes,\u201d Brenda Hunter said, \u201cI\u2019m going to stay in Princeville,\u201d and talk at the table turned to demolition, duct work and how long it would take to return home. Others in the hotel have decided to leave. David Birth, 70, a retired machine operator, whose home on Main Street was destroyed, said he had already bought land in Tarboro and would live there, in a trailer. \u201cWhen the first flood came, it took the first house,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cThe second flood took this one. I\u2019m not going to let my grandchildren be in the same situation. \u201d For now, many families are waiting: waiting to see how far flood insurance goes, what FEMA will offer, and what the town decides. Back at Ms. Cobb\u2019s house, as volunteers carted away wheelbarrows filled with wallboard, Ms. Cobb\u2019s daughter, Regina, 48, looked across the street where trees hide the Tar River. If it were up to her, she said, she would leave, although she said she would support her mother\u2019s decision. \u201cWe were supposed to be on a   flood plain, and we only made it through 17 years,\u201d Regina Cobb said. \u201cThat river isn\u2019t going anywhere. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563335.9306}
