Trump and his family\u2019s business ventures emerged again Thursday evening, when a photograph was distributed that showed his daughter Ivanka at a meeting between Mr. Trump and the prime minister of Japan. News reporters were not allowed to attend the session, Mr. Trump\u2019s first with a foreign head of government, and no summary was provided about what was discussed. A separate photograph was distributed  \u2014   press photographers were not allowed to cover the event  \u2014   showing that Jared Kushner, Ms. Trump\u2019s husband, was present for at least part of the gathering. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan said after the meeting that he had a \u201cvery candid discussion\u201d with Mr. Trump. He did not discuss who else attended the gathering or elaborate on the topics discussed. Ms. Trump will be among the members of the  \u2019s family who will be placed in charge of Mr. Trump\u2019s business enterprises, which include an international chain of hotels with operations in Latin America, Europe and North America. She serves as vice president for development and acquisitions at the Trump Organization, and the company\u2019s website says one of her \u201cprimary focuses has been to bring the Trump Hotel brand to global markets. \u201d She also owns a jewelry business, Ivanka Trump Fine Jewelry, with the Trump Organization describing her as \u201cone of the most recognized and influential young businesswomen today. \u201d After Mr. Trump\u2019s transition office was asked by The New York Times about allowing Ms. Trump to attend the meeting with the Japanese prime minister, an individual close to the family, who said she did not have authorization to provide her name, hinted that Ms. Trump would not be attending meetings like this in the future. \u201cMr. Trump has always encouraged Ivanka and his children to attend meetings with him,\u201d the person close to the family said. \u201cThis meeting in question was very informal. However, they obviously need to adjust to the new realities at hand, which they will. \u201d This week, Ms. Trump\u2019s jewelry company sent out a notice to reporters with a photograph of her wearing a $10, 800 gold bangle bracelet that she had worn during an interview her family did with \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d trying to use the appearance as an opportunity to sell more items. \u201cPlease find attached a style alert of Ivanka wearing her favorite bangle from the Metropolis Collection over the weekend on 60 Minutes,\u201d Monica Marder, the vice president for sales at Ivanka Trump Fine Jewelry, said in the email. Abigail Klem, the president of Ivanka Trump Fine Jewelry, apologized for the promotion of Ms. Trump\u2019s bracelet after the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview, attributing it to \u201ca   marketing employee. \u201d Ms. Klem added, \u201cWe are proactively discussing new policies and procedures with all of our partners going forward. \u201d Ms. Trump\u2019s presence also disturbed some current and former State Department officials, including Moira Whelan, who left the department in July after serving as a deputy assistant secretary of state for public affairs. Anyone present for such a conversation between two heads of state should, at a minimum, have security clearance, Ms. Whelan said, and should also be an expert in Japanese affairs. \u201cMeeting of two heads of state is never an informal occurrence,\u201d Ms. Whelan said. \u201cEven a casual mention or a nod of agreement or an assertion left unchallenged can be interpreted in different ways. \u201d Danielle Brian of the Project on Government Oversight said that regardless of what was discussed at the meeting, it was inappropriate for Ms. Trump to be present at a private meeting among such a small group of people given that she is an executive at a corporation involved in international business development. These early episodes demonstrate, Ms. Brian said, why Mr. Trump must put his assets into a blind trust, in which an independent party manages them, instead of turning them over to his children to manage, as Mr. Trump has proposed. \u201cYou can\u2019t have people with financial conflicts of interest mixing with White House business,\u201d Ms. Brian said. The Wall Street Journal, in an editorial on Friday, went so far as to urge Mr. Trump to sell off all his hotels, golf courses and other assets, and then take that cash and turn it over to a blind trust, as that would be the only way to avoid all possible conflicts.'"}, "time": 1742563084.7532198}
