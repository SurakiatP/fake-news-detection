At 70  \u2014   about 16 months older than Hillary Clinton  \u2014   he would be the oldest person ever to step into the presidency, a fact he\u2019s determined to talk his way around. \u201cHere\u2019s a woman  \u2014   she\u2019s supposed to fight all of these different things, and she can\u2019t make it 15 feet to her car,\u201d he told supporters at a recent rally in Pennsylvania. \u201cShe\u2019s home resting right now. \u201d He slackened his jaw and feigned stumbling across the stage, a dramatic   of the video that showed Clinton nearly collapsing from pneumonia in September. \u201cFolks,\u201d Trump announced, \u201cwe need stamina. \u201d Vim and vigor have always featured prominently in Trump\u2019s  . In his 2009 book \u201cThink Like a Champion,\u201d he called \u201cpositive stamina\u201d a \u201cnecessary ingredient for success. \u201d His Twitter feed is, accordingly, a constant   zone: He has rated the vitality not only of Clinton (\u201czero imagination and even less stamina\u201d) but also of Joan Rivers (\u201ctruly amazing stamina\u201d) the world\u2019s \u201cmany losers and haters\u201d (\u201cnever have the brains or stamina to become truly successful\u201d) and, of course, himself (\u201cone of my greatest assets\u201d). During the first presidential debate, he attacked Clinton\u2019s stamina in four consecutive sentences: \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have the stamina. I said she doesn\u2019t have the stamina. And I don\u2019t believe she does have the stamina. To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina. \u201d Over the course of his career, Trump has amassed a vast verbal arsenal to wield against women  \u2014   pig, dog, slob, bimbo, disgusting, neurotic, ugly  \u2014   but when it comes to Clinton, it\u2019s all stamina, stamina, stamina. The word implies everything Trump has been told he\u2019s no longer allowed to say outright. It strikes a glancing blow at Clinton\u2019s sex without his ever having to call her an old lady. Growing older, Susan Sontag wrote, in a 1972 essay called \u201cThe Double Standard of Aging,\u201d is \u201cmuch more a social judgment than a biological eventuality\u201d  \u2014   an \u201cordeal of the imagination\u201d that \u201cafflicts women much more than men. \u201d This is precisely what \u201cstamina\u201d pokes at: an American subconscious that stereotypes older women as sick, weak, unattractive and useless. It\u2019s a nominally civil version of the sexist internet memes that cast Clinton as \u201cAmerica\u2019s nasty  \u201d and a   nod to   conspiracy theories that place her on the precipice of death. For his own part, Trump presents himself as ageless  \u2014   a bit older than Clinton, but only in man years, which don\u2019t really count. He told the TV doctor Mehmet Oz that he looks in the mirror and sees \u201ca person who is 35 years old,\u201d like a   villain with a charmed looking glass. He gets his exercise, he said, by gesticulating at rallies. The bizarre doctor\u2019s note he released concluded that he\u2019d be the \u201chealthiest individual ever elected to the presidency,\u201d then added, \u201cHis physical strength and stamina are extraordinary. \u201d His wives get younger with every marriage  \u2014   the third, Melania, is 24 years his junior  \u2014   and their youth, Trump says, only makes him more powerful. \u201cYou know,\u201d he told Esquire in 1991, \u201cit doesn\u2019t really matter what they write as long as you\u2019ve got a young and beautiful piece of ass. \u201d Stamina is a guy thing, and guys know it. In September, when   polled likely voters on which candidate \u201chas the stamina to be president,\u201d it was responses from men that put Trump on top. Stamina is a sex thing too. (Just ask the adult film actor Simon Stamina.) The word shares a Latin root with \u201cstamen,\u201d the long,   organ that protrudes from a flower. On some deep, etymological level, Trump seems to be accusing Hillary of not having a penis. \u201cStamina\u201d may have a masculine sheen, but its underlying claim  \u2014   superior mental and physical endurance  \u2014   has long been associated with women. As the   poet Giovanni Boccaccio wrote: \u201cRight so can women suffer   And all wrongs womanly endure. \u201d In Christian theology, women aren\u2019t typically seen as leaders, but they appear frequently as martyrs. In sports, they\u2019re dismissed as physically inferior  \u2014   except in extreme endurance contests, where they\u2019re catching up to and sometimes beating men. (Think of Diana Nyad, who became the first person to swim from Cuba to Florida, at 64.) Childbirth is a saga. And in the ultimate endurance contest  \u2014   life  \u2014   women survive longer than men. Despite all the stigmas applied to aging women, the transition of menopause imparts its own strange cultural power. In 2006, Sharon Stone shared a theory about presidential politics: \u201cA woman should be past her sexuality when she runs,\u201d she said. \u201cHillary still has sexual power, and I don\u2019t think people will accept that. \u201d Last year, in Time magazine, Dr. Julie Holland, the author of a guide to emotional wellness called \u201cMoody Bitches,\u201d argued that Clinton\u2019s body was newly primed to reach its full political potential. During perimenopause, she wrote, estrogen levels go through spikes and crashes, \u201cbut afterward, there is a hormonal ebbing that creates a moment of great possibility,\u201d meaning that \u201cpostmenopausal women are ideal candidates for leadership. \u201d If the double standard of aging is, as Sontag had it, a work of cultural \u201cimagination,\u201d then this   approach to menopause offers an alternative fantasy, one in which women gain strength with age. Clinton stoked all of these associations when she swiped back at Trump during the first presidential debate: \u201cAs soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a   a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina,\u201d she said. To many observers, it was Trump who couldn\u2019t seem to get through a   debate without losing steam  \u2014   and it\u2019s no coincidence that he has intensified his attack on Clinton\u2019s stamina as his own has come into question. Men have always had complicated feelings about women\u2019s capacity for suffering, a mix of admiration at the fulfillment of the feminine role and anxiousness at the special power it affords. Men have made women suffer, then envied how well they\u2019ve managed it. So even as women have been valorized for their endurance, structures have emerged to rein it in. In 1852, Ohio passed a law limiting the work day to 10 hours  \u2014   but only for women and children. By 1917, all but nine states passed similar laws. \u201cWomen are fundamentally weaker than men in all that makes for endurance: in muscular strength, in nervous energy, in the powers of persistent attention and application,\u201d Louis Brandeis argued in front of the Supreme Court in 1908. He framed women as not only physically but somehow metaphysically incapable of working like men: Their \u201cspecial physical organization,\u201d he claimed, meant excessive work could engender a \u201claxity of moral fibre. \u201d All this paternalistic concern helped alleviate a deeper fear: If women were barred from working long hours like men, they couldn\u2019t take men\u2019s jobs. The laws, predictably, did not apply to domestic service. Women who compete in male territory have always had to prove themselves to be twice as good. In the face of these hypercompetent, superqualified women, who have surmounted every barrier set before them, the sexist backlash has been forced to retreat, regroup and adapt. Sure, women can perform like men, this critique says now. But maybe they can keep up the act for only so long. Maybe they can rise to a certain level, and no further. The House? Sure. The Senate? O. K. Secretary of State? I guess. But the presidency?'"}, "time": 1742628408.8504455}
