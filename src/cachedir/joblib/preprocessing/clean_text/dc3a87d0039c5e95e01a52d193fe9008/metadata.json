The Russian narrative praises the pro-Russian people of Crimea for organizing their own annexation and the endangered East Ukrainians as the people\u2019s republics organized armed volunteers to fight off the extremist rapists and crucifiers sent by the illegal Kiev junta. Russia, of course, could not prevent patriotic Russian fighters from volunteering for duty on the Ukrainian field of battle, some during their vacation leaves. Russian soldiers killed or captured in Ukraine had, after all, signed papers separating themselves from the Russian army. As an innocent bystander, Russia has earned a place as a peacemaker in the Minsk negotiations, but claims it has limited influence over the separatist forces. The Russian narrative claims that innocent bystander Russia wants a prosperous and peaceful Ukraine on its borders but with the peoples\u2019 republics having a veto over Ukraine\u2019s foreign policy. The narrative does not state that such an arrangement would spell the end of an independent Ukraine. '"}, "time": 1742563839.9984424}
