[\u201cI think the way we have come together is so inspiring,\u201d the    Chelsea host said at the Young Literati Toast in Los Angeles, according to the Hollywood Reporter.  \u201cI would have hoped that would have happened before the election, but I\u2019ll f*cking take it because it\u2019s so much better to be friends with people you would never talk to before just because we all know that Donald Trump is a f*cking loser,\u201d she added. The Saturday night event, held by the Library Foundation of Los Angeles to benefit the L. A. Public Library, saw a number of celebrities  \u2014   including Silicon Valley star Kumail Nanjiani, Veep\u2018s Timothy Simons and Fresh Off the Boat actress Constance Wu  \u2014   read excerpts from books that have inspired them. \u201cI was browsing through the books in the library and came across a book that would change the course of my life forever,\u201d Handler reportedly said about The Art of the Deal, Trump\u2019s 1987 bestseller. \u201cThe story of this man\u2019s struggles, successes and setbacks were exactly what I needed because of the impact it has made in my life. \u201d According to THR, the money raised at Saturday\u2019s event will go to pay for the establishment of   Student Zones at the library, where children can have access to computers, school supplies, and tutoring. Handler has been a fierce critic of the president, and has extended her criticism to members of Trump\u2019s family. At the Sundance Film Festival in January  \u2014   where the talk show host led a Women\u2019s March protest against Trump  \u2014   Handler said she would never interview First Lady Melania Trump because she can \u201cbarely speak English. \u201d The First Lady reportedly speaks five languages. In March, Handler attacked Trump\u2019s unborn grandchild in a tweet but misspelled the word \u201cgenes,\u201d leading Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump to respond to her with the correct spelling.
