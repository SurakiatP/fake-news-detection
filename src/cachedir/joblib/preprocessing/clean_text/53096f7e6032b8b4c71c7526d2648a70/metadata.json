Thad Cochran ( ) in the 2014 midterm primaries, told Breitbart News exclusively on Wednesday evening he is considering launching another bid for the U. S. Senate in 2018. [This new bid would come against Sen. Roger Wicker ( ) a different but similar U. S. Senator from the Magnolia State, amid concerns over House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s Obamacare 2. 0 plan, the \u201cAmerican Health Care Act. \u201d  McDaniel told Breitbart News: I am definitely considering another run for U. S. Senate, for precisely the reason that now is the time when Mississippi\u2019s conservatives should be leading the nation in the fight against Obamacare. Rather than championing conservative reform in D. C. Mississippi\u2019s federal delegation  \u2014   and Roger Wicker in particular  \u2014   has been silent. Mississippians are among the most conservative people in the republic. We shouldn\u2019t have to beg our Senators to fight for us. Wicker has until now remained publicly silent on the bill from Ryan and House GOP leaders, even though Ryan\u2019s legislation does not repeal Obamacare, keeps in place the individual mandate but shifts the recipient of the penalty payment from a tax collected by the government to a fee collected by insurance companies, keeps the Obamacare Cadillac Tax in place indefinitely \u2014  among many other serious concerns. Republicans   are rising up against it, from the House Freedom Caucus to Sens. Rand Paul ( ) and Mike Lee ( ). Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) who does not support the concept, says it does not have enough support to pass the Senate \u2014  and Sen. Susan Collins ( ) a moderate, says it will not pass the Senate either and that it is dead on arrival should it even reach that chamber. But it is unlikely to get there. The House Freedom Caucus, aides say, is united against the bill, and that is more than enough members to crush it. But many House Republicans outside the House Freedom Caucus are also against the legislation, their offices tell Breitbart News, with as many as \u201c70 or more\u201d Republicans against Ryan\u2019s bill, according to one aide. Paul told Breitbart News in a recent interview that Ryan appears to be misleading the president when it comes to this bill\u2019s realistic chances in the House \u2014  and that it really does appear this bill will fail. An aide in Wicker\u2019s Senate office, Ryan Taylor, told Breitbart News that Wicker suports Ryan\u2019s Obamacare 2. 0 legislation even though it does not repeal Obamacare. He claimed inaccurately in his statement to Breitbart News that the bill does repeal Obamacare. Taylor also attempted to blame President Trump for the proposal, stating inaccurately that it was \u201cthe President\u2019s proposal,\u201d not Ryan\u2019s bill. \u201cSen. Wicker is working with President Trump, Vice President Pence, and most Republicans to pass the President\u2019s proposal to repeal and replace Obamacare,\u201d Taylor said, providing \u2014  when Breitbart News offered him an opportunity to amend that part of his statement and his claim the bill repeals Obamacare \u2014  a screenshot of President Trump\u2019s Tweet announcing that Ryan rolled out the bill and that it is up \u201cfor review and negotiation. \u201d \u201cSen. Wicker is running for   and has a campaign manager,\u201d Taylor added, connecting Breitbart News with that campaign manager, Justin Brasell. \u201cSenator Wicker is taking nothing for granted in his   campaign,\u201d Brasell said in a statement. \u201cHe has hired a campaign manager, is actively working to raise money and is organizing grassroots support in all 82 counties. He will be ready to once again earn the support of Mississippi voters in 2018, regardless of who runs. \u201d McDaniel has proven he can win a statewide U. S. Senate race in Mississippi. Back in 2014, McDaniel won more votes than Cochran in the primary, but since both finished under 50 percent plus one vote, it was kicked to a runoff election. In the runoff, McDaniel won more Republican votes than Cochran. And Cochran only won because of a   effort to get Democrats to cross over to vote in an underhanded way in the GOP primary. McDaniel was endorsed, too, by   Donald Trump. Of McDaniel, Trump said, he \u201cis strong, he is smart  he wants things to change in Washington. \u201d I hope voters in Mississippi cast their ballot for @senatormcdaniel. He is strong, he is smart  he wants things to change in Washington.  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 24, 2014,  In response to President Trump\u2019s endorsement of McDaniel for U. S. Senate back in 2014, Brasell told Breitbart News that \u201cthis is a different race\u201d and \u201cSenator Wicker works well with President Trump. \u201d When Brasell was pressed on why, then, Wicker is not supporting efforts to repeal Obamacare, he told Breitbart News: \u201cHe is working with President Trump to repeal and replace Obamacare. \u201d But since the only bill that Wicker\u2019s team is publicly supporting right now on this matter is a bill that does not repeal Obamacare, the American Health Care Act \u2014  or Obamacare 2. 0 from Paul Ryan \u2014  Breitbart News asked Brasell in a   question what specific legislation other than that bill he is backing that repeals Obamacare. He has not answered. The more important implication than this McDaniel news out of Mississippi, however, is that Ryan\u2019s failure here to deliver a healthcare bill that actually does repeal Obamacare may unleash a wave of primary challenges against incumbent Republicans nationwide in both the House and Senate in 2018. With Republicans in the majority in both the House and Senate, and with a Republican president, a primary challenge wave is the last thing anyone in the Republican Party wants. But Ryan may have just triggered it.'"}, "time": 1742561709.7348955}
