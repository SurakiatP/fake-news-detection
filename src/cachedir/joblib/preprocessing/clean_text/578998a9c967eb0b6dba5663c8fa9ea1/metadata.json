The former recognize truth only once card-carrying members arrive at it independently, grasp and broadcast it, sometimes years too late. Not so America\u2019s marginalized writers. Not in 2012, but in 2002 did we pinpoint the wrongness of the Iraq War. And not in 2016, but in July of 2015 did some of us, not fortuitously, finger Trump as \u201ca candidate to \u2018kick the crap out of all the politicians\u2019\u201d and \u201csend the system\u2019s sycophants scattering\u201d (August 14, 2015). His appeal, as this writer has contended since late in 2015, transcended left and right. \\nConversely, vaunted statistician Nate Silver \u201ccalculated, last November, that Trump\u2019s support was \u2018about the same share of people who think the Apollo moon landings were faked.\u2019\u201d (Professor Tyler Cowen of George Mason University properly downgraded wonder boy Silver\u2019s intellectual prowess. His prose, wrote the good teacher, was a sprawl that \u201cevinces a greater affiliation to rigor with data analysis than to rigor with philosophy of science or, for that matter, rigor with rhetoric.\u201d) \\nGiven the disparate groups that rooted for Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy, it would appear that he did in fact awaken a historic majority. You could say Mr. Trump was an \u201comnibus candidate,\u201d a concept floated by historian David Hackett Fischer. An omnibus campaign is one that appeals in all cultural regions. Back in the 1840 and 1848 elections, William Henry Harrison and Zachary Taylor, respectively, proved to be \u201comnibus candidates,\u201d popular across cultural regions. In his ability to run strongly in almost every cultural region, Trump is the closest the country has come in a long time to an \u201comnibus candidate.\u201d \\nPresident-elect Trump answered the many prayers of very many people. \\nThe establishment\u2019s reaction to the Trump revolution comports with \u201cthe conduct of elites,\u201d also traced by Hackett Fischer in his towering text, \u201cAlbion\u2019s Seed: Four British Folkways in America\u201d: \u201cThere is a cultural equivalent of the iron law of oligarchy. Small groups dominate every cultural system. They tend to do so by controlling institutions and processes, so that they become the \u2018governors\u2019 of a culture in both a political and mechanical sense.\u201d \\n\u201cThe iron law of cultural elites is an historical constant,\u201d posited Hackett Fischer in his magisterial account of American cultural and social origins. \u201cBut the relation between elites and other cultural groups is highly variable. Every culture might be seen as a system of bargaining, in which elites maintain their hegemony by concessions to other groups.\u201d \\nThese old bargaining processes may have worked in New England\u2019s town system, where each community enjoyed a \u201chigh degree of autonomy and also a common interest in supporting the system itself.\u201d But \u201creciprocal liberty\u201d in early America\u2019s \u201cback settlements\u201d has long since given way to elite solidarity, hegemony, log-rolling and collusion with favored interests. \\nIn virtue, the American oligarchy currently in control of the intellectual means of production bears no resemblance to the natural aristocracy, the object of Thomas Jefferson\u2019s lauding reflections. Likewise, Sir William Berkeley\u2019s concept of a society governed by \u201cgentlemen of honor, courage and breeding\u201d is nowhere seen in the fragmented, faction-based politics of America. This is not to say that Mr. Trump exemplifies these lost qualities, but, as \u201cThe Trump Revolution\u201d contends, there is a distinct element of gruff, made-in-America noblesse oblige to Trump\u2019s political crusade. \\nPut it this way, President-elect Trump is unlikely to be caught off-guard mouthing his contempt for small-town America, as Barack Obama did in depicting potential voters as clinging to their guns, god and other \u201cbigotries.\u201d It\u2019s hard to imagine President-elect Trump ever demonstrating the cruelty and hypocrisy of a Gordon Brown, Great Britain\u2019s former prime minister. In May of 2010, after hearing Mrs. Gillian Duffy\u2019s worries over deficits and immigration, the pompous, two-faced boor of a prime minister retreated to his limousine, and, microphone on, proceeded to berate this perfectly decent lady, calling her \u201chorrible,\u201d \u201cold woman,\u201d and \u201cbigoted.\u201d \\nThe Trump presidency is the last heave-ho of America\u2019s Mrs. Duffys; of America\u2019s historic, founding majority. \\nAlmost 200 years on, Albion\u2019s seed is scattered, diluted and demoralized. More so than cultural identities, issues have come to dominate elections. The Trump revolution boiled down to fundamental things like Islam (\u201cno thanks\u201d), immigration (\u201cmuch less\u201d), and a government that refused to heed. \\nIn the short term, the success of this majority awakened and its candidate will depend on President-elect Trump\u2019s ability to beat back the sprawling political machine that makes up the D.C. Comitatus, now writhing like a fire breathing mythical monster in the throes of death. Or, so we hope.'"}, "time": 1742628408.38582}
