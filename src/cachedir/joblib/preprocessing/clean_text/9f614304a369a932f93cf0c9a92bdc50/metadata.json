Expect Occupy 2.0, and #BlackLivesMatter to rage.\u201d \\nOn Friday, Henningsen talked to RT International about the post-elections protests that were coordinated in part by Democratic Party \u2018community organizing\u2019 online platform MoveOn.org . Watch: \\n. Not surprisingly, MoveOn.org have also launched a national \u2018activist\u2019 campaign to \u201c Abolish the Electoral College \u201d after Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton came up short with 232 (including New Hampshire) to Donald Trump\u2019s 306 (including Arizona and Michigan). Final totals are not yet in, but thus far 2016 would be the fifth time in U.S. history that a presidential candidate has won the White House while losing the total popular vote. \\nSEE ALSO: (VIDEO) Female College Students Protesting Because \u2018Trump is a Rapist\u2019 \\n21WIRE Associate Editor Shawn Helton recently revealed more details about how the near exact same methods used in CIA and Soros-funded \u2018color revolutions\u2019 overseas \u2013 are now being deployed on US domestic shores by similar NGO front organizations: has been the driving force behind nationwide protests against the election of Donald Trump. \\n\u201cOverseas, Washington tends to use the same cast of NGO fronts to build-up pro-US political opposition groups, as well as plan and generate civil unrest. They include the Albert Einstein Institute (AEI), National Endowment for Democracy (NED), International Republican Institute (IRI), National Democratic Institute (NDI), Freedom House and later the International Center for Non-Violent Conflict (ICNC), and the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the financial and contractor arm of the Department of State. Inside the US, deep state actors in Washington generally work through Democratic Party affiliated organizations like MoveOn.org, as well as through labor union organizations like AFL-CIO , and UNITE HERE . These, along with many other similar organizations have been involved in organizing this week\u2019s protests,\u201d says Helton. \\nHelton also raised the question as to why President Obama has stayed silent in the face of street protests, opting instead to \u201clead from behind.\u201d He explains: \\n\u201cCertainly, judging by President Obama and Hillary Clinton\u2019s total silence over their own party\u2019s role in fomenting this week\u2019s unrest \u2013 one can only conclude that both party leaders approve of the protests and riots. The political motivation is undeniable \u2013 to help delegitimize a new Trump presidency.\u201d \\nStay tuned for more updates here at 21WIRE. \\nREAD MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files \\nSUPPORT 21WIRE \u2013 SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV'"}, "time": 1742628303.5970542}
