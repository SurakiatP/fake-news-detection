[According to Bloomberg, the first varsity eSports team will compete in Riot\u2019s League of Legends collegiate league. As one of the five wealthiest organizations in college sports, their endorsement of the explosive eSports scene is a decisive statement about its future.  But the University of Utah won\u2019t foot the bill for the scholarships from its massive $70 million sports budget. Instead, the scholarships will be funded by the university\u2019s acclaimed Entertainment Arts  Engineering department. Program head A. J. Dimick didn\u2019t specify how much they would initially invest. Still, his enthusiasm for the program  \u2014   and eSports as a whole  \u2014   is readily apparent. He asks other schools to \u201cjoin us,\u201d encouraging them to help \u201cmove this along together. \u201d Utah may be the first of the \u201cPower Five,\u201d but the University of California was the first on the map overall, investing $250, 000 in a dedicated arena. At the time, UCI\u2019s Acting Director of Esports Mark Deppe said: Esports is the future of competition. Period. It transcends language, geography, race, age, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, physical ability and many other identities. In five years many more schools will official programs and more structure will be in place to regulate and provide guidance to schools. Esports also has a huge opportunity to learn from the successes and shortcomings of traditional sports and provide a model for collegiate competition in the 21st century. There is a steady flow of signs that suggest he\u2019s right. ESPN believed that the industry was already \u201cprimed for growth\u201d in early 2016, and that growth has reliably exceeded expectations. Initially, UOU\u2019s program will offer partial scholarships to its participants. Their eventual goal, however, is to broker sponsorship deals to expand into more games. If possible, they would eventually provide full scholarships for up to 35 talented students.
