[Another judge in Wisconsin says a Syrian who recently was given asylum  \u2014   and who is not even a citizen  \u2014   has the right to ask a fellow judge for visas to fly his relatives into the United States, regardless of opposition from the U. S. government\u2019s border, police and intelligence, and immigration agencies.   Three California judges and a judge in Washington State say the President\u2019s sole right and solemn duty to guard the borders ends when a state suffers financial harm because its universities can\u2019t import more   customers from restricted countries. These   judges are competing with each other to throw invented legalistic roadblocks in front of Trump\u2019s legal and proper defense of the nation\u2019s borders, said Hans Von Spakovsky, a former lawyer at the Department of Justice who is now working for the Heritage Foundation.  \u201cI don\u2019t think the [various judges] have any professional shame about it  \u2014   in fact, they\u2019re being applauded by newspaper editors for actually ignoring the [Congress\u2019] law and [Supreme Court] rulings based on their own personal policy preferences,\u201d he told Breitbart.  The judges\u2019 grab for power, despite the plain text of the Congress\u2019 law and despite prior Supreme Court decisions, \u201cis destructive of the rule of law, which is the entire basis of our Republic,\u201d he said.  \u201cIt is a very bad development that threatens our democracy   \u2026     [and] it looks like it is going to get worse [because] we\u2019re going to have more and more litigation, and it is very clear that the progressive left wants to use the courts to fight way our democracy works,\u201d he said, adding \u201cI think what they doing is very  . \u201d The only fix, he said, is for Trump to aggressively push the Senate to confirm good judges for the 110 empty judicial seats around the nation. Trump will be aided in this push because the Senate\u2019s former Majority Leader, Democratic Sen. Harry Reid, changed the Senate rules to lower the   thresholds to end filibusters of judicial confirmation debates. \u201cThe Trump administration has to remember that Harry Reid ended the [ ] filibuster for judges except for the Supreme Court [so] all they need are 51 votes to get any judge confirmed   \u2026     They were given a gift by Harry Reid and they need to take it,\u201d he said.  Trump must also disregard the Senate\u2019s traditional \u201cblue slip\u201d process, which gives Senators a quiet veto over nominees to judicial seats in their states. Democrats used that process to push President George W. Bush to nominate progressive judges to   states during his eight years in the White House. One of Bush\u2019s \u201cblue slip\u201d progressives judges blocked Trump\u2019s Executive Order in Washington State by declaring that universities and companies can ask judges to override Presidents\u2019 curbs on immigration. Trump and the GOP Senators \u201chave to override that\u201d   veto, Spakovsky said. The judge in Washington State, James Robart, declared Feb. 3 that \u201cthe [president\u2019s] executive order adversely effects the State\u2019s residents in areas of employment, education, business, family relations, and freedom to travel. These harms extend to the States by virtue of their roles as parens patriae of the residents living within their borders. \u201d That judge was backed up by three judges in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, who   court decisions from domestic cases to declare that the danger of jihadism is less urgent than universities\u2019 foreign revenues: the University of Washington was in the process of sponsoring three prospective employees from countries covered by the Executive Order for visas it had made plans for their arrival beginning in February 2017, but they have been unable to enter the United States. The University of Washington also sponsored two medicine and science interns who have been prevented by the Executive Order from coming to the University of Washington   \u2026     Under the \u201cthird party standing\u201d doctrine, these injuries to the state universities give the States standing to assert the rights of the [foreign] students, scholars, and faculty affected by the Executive Order.   \u2026     the public has a powerful interest in national security and in the ability of an elected president to enact policies. And on the other, the public also has an interest in free flow of travel, in avoiding separation of families, and in freedom from discrimination. We need not characterize the public interest more definitely than this when considered alongside the hardships discussed above, these competing public interests do not justify a stay [upholding Trump\u2019s policy] The Wisconsin decision was announced March 10 by Judge William Conley of the U. S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin, who went several steps further by saying an individual, who is not even a citizen, has the right to overrule the president if he or she can get a judge to agree. According to the Wisconsin judge\u2019s order:  Plaintiff is a Sunni Muslim who, after being fully vetted by U. S. immigration authorities, was granted asylum status because of the torture and religious persecution he had suffered in Syria. he thereafter filed derivative asylum petitions to reunite with his wife and his only surviving child  \u2026    .. President Trump\u2019s efforts to impose an immigration ban by executive order are threatening to stop Plaintiff\u2019s derivative asylum petitions in their tracks. From 2o13 to 2015, government data shows that 25, 565 foreigners got asylum status  \u2014   and according to Judge Conley  \u2014   the right to bring their families into the United States regardless of Congres\u2019 laws and the policy that an elected president promised to implement if he was democratically voted into the White House.  In Hawaii, Judge Derrick Watson decided that the elected President\u2019s policy of defending Americans from Muslim jihadis who emerged from Muslim culture in Muslim countries might hurt Hawaii\u2019s tourism industry, saying in his order that: The State points to preliminary data from the Hawaii Tourism Authority, which suggests that during the interval of time that the first Executive Order was in place, the number of visitors to Hawai\u2018i from the Middle East dropped (data including visitors from Iran, Iraq, Syria and Yemen)   \u2026     Because there is preliminary evidence that losses of current and future revenue are traceable to the Executive Order, this injury to the State\u2019s proprietary interest also appears sufficient to confer standing.  The judge also opposed the President\u2019s national defense against Islam\u2019s violent doctrines by quoting the Muslim cleric\u2019s testimony about\u201dethnicity\u201d and children\u2019s worries, saying:  [\u201cMy children] are deeply affected by the knowledge that the United States \u2014  their own country \u2014  would discriminate against individuals who are of the same ethnicity as them, including members of their own family, and who hold the same religious beliefs. They do not fully understand why this is happening, but they feel hurt, confused, and sad. \u201d Alongside the judges\u2019 escalating and expanding claims of their judicial power over elected presidents, the written law is entirely clear that the written Constitution and the elected Congress give only the elected president and his   deputies the legal power to accept or deny entry of alien foreigners into the United States. Here\u2019s the relevant statute, 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1182 (f): (f) Suspension of Entry or Imposition of Restrictions by President, Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate. The Supreme Court has accepted and validated this \u201cplenary power\u201d of the elected president. For example, the court declared in its 1950 judgment lawsuit, titled Knauff v. Shaughnessy, that \u201cIt is not within the province of any court, unless expressly authorized by [congressional] law, to review the determination of the political branch of Government to exclude a given alien. \u201d In 2015, the Court reasserted that judgment in Kerry v. Din, saying: The state action of which Din complains is the denial of [spouse] Berashk\u2019s visa application. Naturally, one would expect him \u2014  not Din \u2014  to bring this suit. But because Berashk is an unadmitted and nonresident alien, he has no right of entry into the United States, and no cause of action to press in furtherance of his claim for admission   \u2026     So, Din attempts to bring suit on his behalf, alleging that the Government\u2019s denial of her husband\u2019s visa application violated her constitutional rights  \u2026     In particular, she claims that the Government denied her due process of law when, without adequate explanation of the reason for the visa denial, it deprived her of her constitutional right to live in the United States with her spouse. There is no such constitutional right. And, Here, a long practice of regulating spousal immigration precludes Din\u2019s claim that the denial of Berashk\u2019s visa application has deprived her of a fundamental liberty interest. Although immigration was effectively unregulated prior to 1875, as soon as Congress began legislating in this area it enacted a complicated web of regulations that erected serious impediments to a person\u2019s ability to bring a spouse into the United States  \u2026     This Court has consistently recognized that these various distinctions are \u201cpolicy questions entrusted exclusively to the political branches of our Government, and we have no judicial authority to substitute our political judgment for that of the Congress. \u201d But that case was decided by 5 to 4, with former Justice Antonin Scalia providing the critical fifth vote against the block of four progressives who would have granted foreigners a conditional right to immigrate into the United States, regardless of government or voter preferences. Scalia is dead, and the Senate has yet to vote on his nominated successor, Judge Neil Gorsuch.'"}, "time": 1742628316.3922653}
