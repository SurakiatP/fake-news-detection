[The    icon performed her smash hits \u201cBelieve\u201d and \u201cIf I Could Turn Back Time\u201d Sunday night before accepting the ceremony\u2019s Icon Award for her   career in the music industry.  The   and   danced on stage wearing a silver diamante dress, with her chest covered up by   nipple pasties. The sparkling dress, which consisted of multiple hanging diamond strips, barely covered the singers chest and groin area. She later returned to the stage in a black catsuit and a large   wig, a throwback to her early 80s look.  \u201cSo, I wanted to do what I do since I was 4 years old, and I\u2019ve been doing it for 53 years,\u201d Cher said in accepting the Icon Award. \u201cThat is not an applause thing, I\u2019m 71 yesterday! And I can do a   plank, okay?
