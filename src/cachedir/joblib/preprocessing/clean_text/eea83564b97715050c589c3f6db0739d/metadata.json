Contact us: smarterliving@nytimes. com. Friendships are important throughout life, but especially so in the stage between school and marriage, when our friends often stand in for family. What do you do when you need to end a friendship that\u2019s turned sour? First, give it some serious thought. Once you initiate a breakup, there may be no turning back. Depending on the type of friendship, a formal ending may not be necessary. \u201cThere are typically four types of friendships: friends you have because of shared history friends you\u2019ve made due to forced togetherness your surface social friends and growth friends, meaning the people you want by your side as you go through life wherever you are,\u201d said Melissa S. Cohen, a psychotherapist and relationship coach in Westfield, N. J. \u201cUnless there has been a serious betrayal of trust, you can usually let all but your most important friendships fade away simply by spending less time with each other. \u201d If, however, your friend asks why you are not texting her or never available to get together, offer an explanation. \u201cThink about what you say and how you say it very carefully. It\u2019s likely that your   will never forget those words,\u201d said Irene S. Levine, a psychologist and producer of TheFriendshipBlog. com. Then, talk to your friend in private. \u201cDon\u2019t involve mutual friends. Remember that although you have been giving a lot of thought to the breakup, it might hit your friend without warning,\u201d Dr. Levine said. If you no longer have much in common or simply don\u2019t enjoy your time together anymore, take responsibility for ending the friendship rather than blaming the other person.

K. to say, \u2018I truly care about you and the relationship we\u2019ve had, but I don\u2019t have the bandwidth or time to devote to our friendship anymore,\u2019 or \u2018I can\u2019t be the friend that you want me to be right now,\u2019\u201d Ms. Cohen said. \u201cEven if you feel it\u2019s your friend who is sucking you dry, or stuck in college partying mode, or not being considerate, you can compassionately and authentically say, \u2018We don\u2019t seem to share the same goals and perspectives. \u2019\u201d That allows you both to be cordial if you see each other again, and leaves the door open to a reconciliation if circumstances change. \u201cNo matter what, it\u2019s always important to be careful with other people\u2019s feelings. That just makes you a good person,\u201d Ms. Cohen added. When a friend betrays you by, say, blabbing your secrets or being consistently cruel, you can and should stand up for yourself. And if this is not one of your closest friends, a breakup is most likely in order. The goal in these instances is to be honest and plainly explain why you can\u2019t be friends with someone you don\u2019t trust. And have the conversation live  \u2014   either in person or over the phone  \u2014   because anything you write online could be shared or used against you in a way you may regret. But when you have a major conflict with a best friend, these scenarios don\u2019t apply. It\u2019s ideal to have an open discussion about your feelings. \u201cFor those friends, it\u2019s worth it to try harder and give the person the benefit of the doubt because those relationships are rare,\u201d Ms. Cohen said. \u201cBe really honest about what\u2019s going on. \u201d If after that, the relationship still feels unsustainable to you, let your friend go as gently as you can. \u201cThese relationships need to be mutually satisfying to both people,\u201d Dr. Levine said. Be clear that you wish your friend well but resist the urge to explain every detail of your thought process. \u201cIt isn\u2019t necessarily kind and won\u2019t necessarily provide the other person with closure. Your friend will still need to achieve that on her own,\u201d Dr. Levine added. And remember that friendship breakups can hurt just as much as romantic breakups, especially if you\u2019ve been close with a friend for a long time. And sadly, noted Dr. Levine, \u201cwhen you break up with a boyfriend, you can turn to your best friends for support. When you break up with a best friend, you\u2019ve lost the person who might be able to help you get over the loss. \u201d Want to read more?
