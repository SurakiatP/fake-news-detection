Scott Armstrong. [Professor Armstrong, who   the   Journal of Forecasting in 1982 and the International Journal of Forecasting in 1985, made the claim in a presentation about what he considers to be \u201calarmism\u201d from forecasters over   climate change.  \u201cWe also go through journals and rate how well they conform to the scientific method. I used to think that maybe 10 percent of papers in my field   \u2026     were maybe useful. Now it looks like maybe, one tenth of one percent follow the scientific method\u201d said Armstrong in his presentation, which can be watched in full below. \u201cPeople just don\u2019t do it. \u201d Armstrong defined eight criteria for compliance with the scientific method, including full disclosure of methods, data, and other reliable information, conclusions that are consistent with the evidence, valid and simple methods, and valid and reliable data.  According to Armstrong, very little of the forecasting in climate change debate adheres to these criteria. \u201cFor example, for disclosure, we were working on polar bear [population] forecasts, and we were asked to review the government\u2019s polar bear forecast. We asked, \u2018could you send us the data\u2019 and they said \u2018No\u2019  \u2026     So we had to do it without knowing what the data were. \u201d According to Armstrong, forecasts from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) violate all eight criteria. \u201cWhy is this all happening? Nobody asks them!\u201d said Armstrong, who says that people who submit papers to journals are not required to follow the scientific method. \u201cYou send something to a journal and they don\u2019t tell you what you have to do. They don\u2019t say \u2018here\u2019s what science is, here\u2019s how to do it. \u2019\u201d Digging deeper into their motivations, Armstrong pointed to the wealth of incentives for publishing papers with politically convenient rather than scientific conclusions. \u201cThey\u2019re rewarded for doing   research. One of my favourite examples is testing statistical significance  \u2014   that\u2019s invalid. It\u2019s been over 100 years we\u2019ve been fighting the fight against that. Even its inventor thought it wasn\u2019t going to amount to anything. You can be rewarded then, for following an invalid [method]. \u201d \u201cThey cheat. If you don\u2019t get statistically significant results, then you throw out variables, add variables, [and] eventually you get what you want. \u201d \u201cMy big thing is advocacy. People are asked to come up with certain answers, and in our whole field that\u2019s been a general movement ever since I\u2019ve been here, and it just gets worse every year. And the reason is funded research. \u201d \u201cI\u2019ve [gone through] my whole career, with lots of publications, and I\u2019ve never gotten a research grant. And I\u2019m proud of that now. \u201d Armstrong concluded his talk by arguing that scientific evidence should be required for all climate regulations.
