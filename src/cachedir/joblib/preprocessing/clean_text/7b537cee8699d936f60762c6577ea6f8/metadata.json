Residents in the city of Homs, near Al Shayrat airfield, which was hit with dozens of   Tomahawk missiles in the predawn hours on Friday local time, praised the strike. So did residents of the northern   town of Khan Sheikhoun, the site of a deadly attack on Tuesday that used what was probably the nerve agent sarin  \u2014   an attack the United States said had been carried out by Syrian warplanes from the airfield. \u201cWe will not kneel! We will not kneel!\u201d dozens of marchers in Khan Sheikhoun shouted in a video that activists posted on Facebook. Small children later joined the protesters, and the group was filmed standing silently in a circle, carrying pictures of the victims of the attack. The smell from the chemical assault lingered in the air in parts of Khan Sheikhoun on Friday, residents there said via telephone, Skype and internet messaging. Some praised President Trump, contrasting him favorably with President Barack Obama, who studiously avoided using military force against Mr. Assad in Syria despite his famous \u201cred line,\u201d which was crossed by the first big chemical weapons assault there nearly four years ago. \u201cThe people here were suffocated by sarin, Trump came and vented the anger,\u201d Abdul Wahab   a member of the Khan Sheikhoun local council, said in a message posted via WhatsApp. \u201cIt\u2019s the best news I\u2019ve heard in the past few days, it\u2019s a revenge for the martyrs\u2019 blood,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe\u2019re feeling some relief now. In the past, Obama used to say only words Trump said and acted. \u201d At the same time, he said, many residents were still hiding in shelters, fearful that Mr. Assad\u2019s forces would send their own message of defiance with another attack on the town. Othman   an   activist from Khan Sheikhoun, said Mr. Trump \u201cfinally broke the longstanding silence of the Obama administration\u201d on American entanglement in the Syrian conflict. \u201cThis response is good in a way, but we can\u2019t say that it is enough,\u201d he said. Some in Khan Sheikhoun were cynical, saying Mr. Assad\u2019s behavior would not change. \u201cWe were all happy until they said that America gave Russia notice. That means that they probably emptied the airport of all the working planes,\u201d said Refaat Youssef, who lost 26 relatives in the chemical attack. \u201cThis is a tranquilizer shot. If you really want to put an end to the suffering, hit all the airports. \u201d The official Syrian news agency\u2019s account of the missile strike called it a \u201cblatant act of aggression\u201d by the United States that killed nine civilians, including four children, and caused \u201chuge material damage. \u201d Russian news footage of the aftermath, posted on YouTube, showed damage to some reinforced hangars at Al Shayrat, but the runways appeared intact. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group, reported later on Friday that two Sukhoi warplanes had been seen taking off from the base. The extent of damage could not be independently verified, but   activists felt some vindication regardless. \u201cHoms is more beautiful without the airport of death,\u201d Osama Mohammed Ali, a resident of a besieged area near Homs, said in a posted message. He urged the United States to launch \u201cTomahawks on all the airports of death, the airports of killing and extermination and displacement in Syria. \u201d Mohamed Khaldiyeh, an   activist who lives near the airfield, said residents had often awakened to audio alerts about impending takeoffs of warplanes on bombing missions. \u201cThis base was the main reason of the huge destruction in Homs and the displacements of our families,\u201d he said, and on Friday, people \u201cwoke up to the news of its destruction. \u201d \u201cPraise God,\u201d he added. Syrians in other besieged parts of the country, learning about the American airstrike, reacted with a mix of gratification and worry. \u201cThe hit on Bashar   should have happened three years ago, from the beginning, when Bashar   used chemical weapons,\u201d said Hala Abdulwahab, a teacher in Madaya, a besieged city. \u201cChildren are choking and dying. Entire families are dying. \u201d Wissam Zarqa, an English teacher from the northern city of Aleppo who now lives in Idlib Province, called the missile strike a positive step. But like others in Syria and elsewhere, he questioned whether it signaled the beginning of a stronger American military strategy in Syria. \u201cOne killing tool was targeted, which is good,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope more steps would follow to punish Assad for all attacks against civilians, whether chemical or not. \u201d Malek Al Shimali, an   activist displaced from his home in Aleppo a few months ago and now staying in Turkey, expressed mixed feelings about the missile strike. \u201cI feel the ecstasy of revenge now,\u201d he said in a Facebook message. But he added, \u201cI don\u2019t feel the strike will change anything  \u2014   unless Bashar left, nothing will change. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564559.017601}
