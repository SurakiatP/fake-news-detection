[Stockholmers appeared to be following police advice to stay indoors and avoid crowded areas, with a number of   city streets deserted.  The attack occurred just before 3:00 pm (1300 GMT) when a beer truck slammed into the corner of the bustling Ahlens store and the popular pedestrian street Drottninggatan, above ground from Stockholm\u2019s central subway station. The initial scene was chaotic. After emergency responders rushed to the scene, several bodies could be seen lying on the ground covered with orange blankets. Shattered glass was scattered on the ground near a large blood stain on the asphalt. Shaken passersby described their horror at witnessing what police and Prime Minister Stefan Lofven described as a \u201cterror attack\u201d. \u201cA massive truck starts driving   \u2026     and mangles everything and just drives over exactly everything,\u201d eyewitness Rikard Gauffin told AFP. \u201cIt was so terrible and there were bodies lying everywhere  \u2026     it was really terrifying,\u201d he added.  \u2014   Trapped  \u2014   Police cars and ambulances rapidly flooded the scene, as central streets and squares were blocked off amid fears that another attack could be imminent. Helicopters hovered overhead across the city, sirens wailed, and police vans   the streets using loudspeakers to urge people to head straight home and avoid crowded places. But with the metro system and commuter trains shut down for several hours after the attack, other streets heading out of the city were packed with thousands of pedestrians trying to find a way home. Central Stockholm would on any other Friday be abuzz with locals queueing up outside glitzy bars and restaurants and upscale nightclubs. Haval, a    sales clerk who didn\u2019t want to reveal his last name, was in the metro at the time of the attack. His train stopped immediately and he had to get out, along with all the other passengers. They walked along the street before being ushered inside a nearby hotel for safety. \u201cWe were suddenly trapped inside a hotel and there was the worst kind of horror in there,\u201d he told AFP. \u201cWe were scared, we were scared something else would happen, he added.  \u2014   \u2018Suddenly it happens\u2019  \u2014   The attack was the latest in a string of similar assaults with vehicles in Europe that include the southern French city of Nice, Berlin and London. \u201cI never thought that something would happen in Sweden, but then suddenly it happens,\u201d Haval said. One witness identified only as Dimitris told the Aftonbladet daily the truck came \u201cout of nowhere. \u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t see if anyone was driving but it was out of control. I saw at least two people get run down. I ran as fast as I could away from there,\u201d he said.  \u2014   \u2018You won\u2019t break us\u2019  \u2014   Marko was in coffee shop near the scene with his girlfriend when he saw the truck ram into the store. \u201cHe hit a woman first, then he drove over a bunch of other people   \u2026     We took care of everyone lying on the ground,\u201d he told Swedish daily newspaper Aftonbladet. Hasan Sidi, another passerby, told Aftonbladet he saw two elderly women lying on the ground. He said people at the scene urged him to help one of the women who was \u201cbleeding to death\u201d. \u201cOne of them died  \u2026    I don\u2019t know if the other one made it,\u201d Sidi said. \u201cThe police were shocked. Everyone was shocked. \u201d Despite that shock, Sweden was determined to not let the attackers create fear. \u201cTerrorists want us to be afraid, want us to change our behaviour, want us to not live our lives normally, but that is what we\u2019re going to do. So terrorists can never defeat Sweden, never,\u201d Prime Minister Lofven said. Shortly afterwards, he placed a bouquet of flowers near the scene, visibly shaken and wiping away a tear. In an editorial, Sweden\u2019s biggest broadsheet Dagens Nyheter wrote: \u201cWhat we feared for a long time finally happened. \u201d \u201cThe fear and panic right after the incident was inevitable. The images from the attack were terrible,\u201d the paper said. But Stockholm managed to stay \u201c \u201d even though the attacker struck \u201cSweden and Stockholm\u2019s heart\u201d it added. \u201cStockholm stands strong. You won\u2019t break Stockholm. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562259.5584617}
