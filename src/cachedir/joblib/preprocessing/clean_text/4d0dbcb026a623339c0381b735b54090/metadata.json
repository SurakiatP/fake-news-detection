Wright described the photo as \u201cincredible.\u201d This photo from Standing Rock is incredible pic.twitter.com/aWeHSFh1VP \\n\u2014 Larry Wright (@refocusedmedia) November 5, 2016 \\nAfter inquiries from Twitter users about the origin of the viral photo, Wright pointed them to a GoFundMe page for \u201cStanding Rock Rising,\u201d which hosts not only the viral photo, but several other high-quality shots showcasing the nobility of the Standing Rock protesters at the Dakota Access Pipeline construction site, particularly in the face of countless state resources aimed at ousting them from treaty-protected land. The original source of the viral photo on Standing Rock Rising\u2019s Facebook page has over 16,000 shares as of this writing. \\nDEFEND THE SACRED \\nPosted by Standing Rock Rising on Wednesday, November 2, 2016 \\n\u201cWhat an incredibly powerful photo,\u201d wrote Chris Ashby-Zwozdiak in the comments. \u201cThe civilised vs the uncivilised, predatory, and despicable mob. I stand with you Standing Rock, all indigenous peoples, and with all those who continue to fight for environmental and social justice for all.\u201d \\n\u201cThis reminds me so much of the Tiananmen Square massacre that saw China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army gun down hundreds of civilians in a brutal crackdown on protests against government corruption, lack of transparency and freedom of speech,\u201d wrote Catherine Davies van Zoen. \u201cThis photo here will become just as much an icon of shame to the USA police as the other one is to the Chinese military.\u201d \\nRyan Redhawk, a photojournalist from Atlanta, is revealed as the photographer behind Standing Rock Rising. Redhawk is aiming to crowdfund $15,000 , of which over $11,000 has already been raised, saying the goal of his work is to \u201chelp spread awareness for activism and social change across the United States.\u201d Redhawk is planning to stay at Standing Rock throughout the cold winter months, documenting the indigenous resistance to the Dakota Access Pipeline, even walking away from his two current jobs to devote 100 percent of his time to the project. \\n\u201cThis project means so much to me, because I deeply feel the Native Americans are being forgotten in general American culture, and something as rich as their roots should live on forever,\u201d Redhawk wrote. \u201cI want to see them be brought back to light as the original Americans. After all, this was their land, before it was our[s].\u201d \\n\\nTom Cahill is a writer for US Uncut based in the Pacific Northwest.
