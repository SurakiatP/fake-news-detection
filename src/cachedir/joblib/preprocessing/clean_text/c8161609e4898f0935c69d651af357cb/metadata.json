The Orlando Sentinel ran a   editorial with the headline, \u201cOur Community Will Heal. \u201d And on Sunday, three days after a sniper killed five police officers during a protest in downtown Dallas, The Dallas Morning News responded with its own   editorial, featuring an image of an eye shedding a tear. \u201cThis city, our city, has been tested before,\u201d the editorial said. \u201cNow we face a new test. \u201d As spasms of violence continue to tear apart cities across the country, newspapers have been using   editorials as a salve for healing   communities. But more than that, the front page has come to reflect the rising frustration of a fractured country reeling from bloodshed. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that   editorials have come more into some prominence in the last year or so,\u201d said Al Tompkins, a senior faculty member at the Poynter Institute. \u201cI think it\u2019s a way of trying to tap into the public consciousness. \u201d In the last several months, The Boston Globe and The New York Times have both printed   editorials calling for stricter regulation of guns in the aftermath of mass shootings. It was the first time since 1920 that The Times had run an editorial on Page 1. The   which had its own mass shooting to cover when a student at Virginia Tech shot and killed 32 people and wounded 17 others on campus in 2007, ran a   editorial on Saturday that pleaded for a d\u00e9tente of sorts. \u201cLet\u2019s just stop and mourn and wonder how in the world America became this unspeakably, relentlessly terrorized place,\u201d it said. The Daily News of New York has used its front page in recent months as an editorial vehicle to inveigh against violence and congressional inaction in the face of it, including one last month with the image of the dome of the Capitol soaked in blood. While many   editorials are intended to soothe and promote resolve, other bold decisions by news organizations have been criticized as sowing divisiveness. The New York Post, for instance, was excoriated on Friday for deciding to use the headline \u201cCivil War\u201d on its front page on the Dallas shooting. A headline on the conservative Drudge Report, \u201cBlack Lives Kill,\u201d also drew harsh rebukes. Like other editorials, the one in The Dallas Morning News addressed the violence gripping the country. \u201cWe are surely not alone in asking, as our hearts break, what kind of country are we creating where such violence has become so frequent?\u201d the editorial said. But it also acknowledged the city\u2019s deep divisions and urged more compassion. \u201cWe live together, but we do not often understand one another. This is because of class, sometimes geography and often race,\u201d it said. \u201cThere will be time later for anger and for justice  \u2014   anger whose purpose is served in justice,\u201d the editorial added. \u201cBut for now we need to learn to understand each other, to really hear one another, to learn from each other. \u201d Mike Wilson, the newspaper\u2019s editor, said in a statement that the editorial was intended to provide a \u201cquiet place\u201d for reflection. \u201cAfter two days of covering violence and heartbreak, we felt the need to pause for a moment and speak directly to the community,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had two simple questions: What kind of city are we? What kind of city do we want to be? \u201cIn the midst of so much noise and pain, we needed a quiet place for that conversation,\u201d he added. \u201cSunday\u2019s front page is that quiet place. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564511.6507294}
