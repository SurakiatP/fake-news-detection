[In this week\u2019s exclusive clip for Breitbart News, Jackie discusses the looming threat of North Korea, and explains how President Donald Trump could win the support of the Hollywood left if the U. S. needs to strike first.  \u201cIf he decides to bomb them, the whole country will be behind him, because everybody will realize he had no choice and that was the only thing to do,\u201d Jackie says. \u201cExcept the Hollywood left. They\u2019ll get nauseous. \u201d \u201c[Trump] could win the left over, they\u2019ll fall in love with him in a minute. If he bombed them for a better reason,\u201d Jackie explains. \u201cLike if they have no transgender toilets. \u201d Jackie also says it\u2019s no surprise that Hollywood celebrities didn\u2019t support Trump\u2019s strike on a Syrian airfield this month. \u201cThey were infuriated,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause it might only save lives. That doesn\u2019t mean anything to them. If it only saved the environment, or climate change! They\u2019d be the happiest people in the world. \u201d Still, Jackie says he\u2019s got nothing against Hollywood celebs. They\u2019ve got a tough life in this country.
