That set off waves of anger on social media, with users criticizing what they called an intrusive, sexist policy, but the airline maintained its support for the gate agent\u2019s decision. The girls, who were about to board a flight to Minneapolis, were turned away at the gate at Denver International Airport, the company said on Sunday. United doubled down on that decision, defending it in a series of tweets on Sunday. The incident was first reported on Twitter by Shannon Watts, a passenger at the airport who was waiting to board a flight to Mexico. In a telephone interview from Mexico on Sunday afternoon, Ms. Watts said she noticed two visibly upset teenage girls leaving the gate next to hers. Both were wearing leggings. Ms. Watts went over to the neighboring gate and saw a \u201cfrantic\u201d family with two young girls, one of whom was also wearing leggings, engaged in a tense exchange with a gate agent who told them, \u201cI don\u2019t make the rules, I just enforce them. \u201d Ms. Watts said the girl\u2019s mother told her the two teenagers had just been turned away because the gate agent said their pants were not appropriate travel attire. The woman had a dress in her   bag that the child was able to pull on over her pants, and the family boarded the flight. \u201cThe girl pulled a dress on,\u201d Ms. Watts said. \u201cBut please keep in mind that the dad had on shorts that did not hit his knee  \u2014   they stopped maybe two or three inches above his knee  \u2014   and there was no issue with that. \u201d Ms. Watts judged that the two girls who were barred from boarding were in their \u201cyoung teens\u201d and the girl who changed into a dress was 10 or 11. Ms. Watts described the situation in a series of tweets before her flight to Mexico took off. By the time she landed her tweets had been shared widely, often accompanied by sharp criticism directed at the airline. Jonathan Guerin, a spokesman for United, confirmed that two teenage girls were told they could not board a flight from Denver to Minneapolis because their leggings violated the company\u2019s dress code policy for \u201cpass travelers,\u201d a company benefit that allows United employees and their dependents to travel for free on a standby basis. Mr. Guerin said pass travelers are \u201crepresenting\u201d the company and as such are not allowed to wear Lycra and spandex leggings, tattered or ripped jeans, midriff shirts,   or any article of clothing that shows their undergarments. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we want our standby travelers to come in wearing a suit and tie or that sort of thing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want people to be comfortable when they travel as long as it\u2019s neat and in good taste for that environment. \u201d He said both teenage girls stayed behind in Denver, \u201cmade an adjustment\u201d to their outfits and waited for the next flight to Minneapolis. Mr. Guerin did not know if they had successfully boarded or not, and also had no information about the girl Ms. Watts said she saw change into a dress at the gate. The company largely confirmed Ms. Watts\u2019s account earlier in the day in a response to her on Twitter that did little to mollify the concerns of its critics. In a series of dozens of tweets, the company said the incident was not simply the result of an overzealous gate agent. Instead, it said United Airlines reserved the right to deny service to anyone its employees deemed to be inappropriately dressed. It also referred to the dress code applied to pass travelers. \u201cIn our Contract of Carriage, Rule 21, we do have the right to refuse transport for passengers who are barefoot or not properly clothed,\u201d the company tweeted. It added, \u201cThere is a dress code for pass travelers as they are representing UA when they fly. \u201d Few critics appeared to be satisfied by that explanation, which also did little to   a perilous public relations situation for the company. United was the target of scores of angry and mocking tweets on Sunday, including from social   celebrities like the model Chrissy Teigen and the actor LeVar Burton. By Sunday afternoon, the company\u2019s Twitter account was engaged in a tense back and forth with the Academy   actress Patricia Arquette, who posted dozens of angry tweets about the situation. Employees running United\u2019s Twitter account spent the day walking a public relations tightrope: explaining to angry social media users why the company was not wrong to bar the young women from boarding, while reassuring potential customers that they would not also be barred if they showed up in leggings. People like to be comfortable when they fly, Ms. Watts said, and leggings and yoga pants have become standard casual attire for women. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure yoga pants are a thing,\u201d Ms. Watts said. \u201cThey\u2019re part of modern America. They\u2019re a staple, a   clothing item. \u201d Mr. Guerin said the company was aware of the criticism leveled at its social media team, but said they were \u201cworking as hard as they can. \u201d \u201cWe could have stopped to immediately ask the right questions,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are always engaging with our customers as quickly as possible. Now we are going back. All day we\u2019ve been going back since that earlier tweet. Now we\u2019re going back and telling people what is actually going on. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563121.4169974}
