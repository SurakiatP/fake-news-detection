The usual reason given is that the increased mass is simply a \u201cdead weight\u201d, while those with a little bit more knowledge will explain that lifting will develop \u201cslow twitch\u201d muscles over the \u201cFast twitch\u201d muscles needed for sprinting, jumping, punching, and kicking.\\nI am here to tell you that the \u201ccommon wisdom\u201d is completely wrong-when done properly, weightlifting will not impede your speed, and will in fact enhance your speed and explosiveness!\\nAnecdotes Perhaps you\u2019ve heard of this man?\\n\\nThat is of course Jamaica\u2019s Usain Bolt, the fastest man in the world, and holder of multiple Olympic records. Also worth noting is that in an interview, Mr. Bolt revealed that he squats 400 pounds, and at least partially attributes his nigh inhuman speed to his training regimen. And he\u2019s not the only speed athlete who this can be said of-look at any Olympic class sprinter, they are all quite muscular fellows.\\n\\nSimilarly, other athletic disciplines (that\u2019s \u201cathletics\u201d in the specific rather than general sense, I\u2019m using the European term for what my countrymen call \u201ctrack and field\u201d) have claimed to utilize weightlifting in their training, such as the long jump and the hurdles. Or, you can take my word for it: at my best I had a one rep max squat of 320 pounds, and had a 38 inch vertical leap (I am judging this by my ability to perform a standing jump over 2nd-highest position hurdles, which are measured at 38 inches ).\\nIn fact, many world-level athletes of all disciplines are utilizing Olympic style weightlifting to develop speed and powe r.\\nAnyway you slice it, compound weight training is a fantastic supplement to all athletes, even those who seemingly don\u2019t need that raw brute strength.\\nThe Science As I elaborated in this article , as well as in the free PDF I offer to subscribers to my website (the subscription sign-up is on the front page) there\u2019s more than one type of way to be athletic. More accurately, there are three, speaking purely in terms of muscular and/or nervous system function, so this does not include hand-to-eye coordination or other skills related to team sports. These three things can, loosely, correlate to the three types of muscle fibers-Red\u2014or slow\u2014Oxidative, Fast Glycolytic-or White-, and Fast Oxidative. Rather than rehash an article that I\u2019ve already written, we will focus on the white muscle, the fast glycolytic. This is the type of muscle you want to be training for if you want to develop sprinting speed or a high vertical leap.\\nOr, to put this into terms of Newton\u2019s second law of motion, Acceleration=Force/Mass, ie: the amount of muscular force you can exert, divided by your body weight=how fast you can accelerate. And yes, I am aware that there\u2019s probably a more mathematically accurate way of putting this.\\nWhich Exercises To Do? It is at this point that you\u2019re probably asking which exercises you should train to develop those physical skills you desire. If you read my articles regularly, you will know what I am likely to say-compound free weight lifting!\\nIn fact, I\u2019ll go out on a limb and say if you don\u2019t know which exercise you should do to develop a certain physical trait, you should always default to a compound lift unless you receive some further information that says otherwise. Training for speed or vertical leap is no exception to this rule.\\nIf you are looking for sheer running speed and leaping ability, the power lifts that hit the lower body are most effective: deep \u201cAss to grass\u201d squats, deadlifts, and the clean and jerk are used by professional athletes to great effect.\\n\\nSimilarly, if you want the ability to throw a ball or punch harder, upper body compound lifts are the key: bench presses, overhead presses and, yes, the clean and jerk, will see you through.\\n\\nSo for those of you who are afraid that your athletic performance will be somehow impeded by heavy weightlifting, nothing could be further from the truth.\\nRead More: Improve Your Weightlifting With A Video Camera \\n'"}, "time": 1742562243.5291483}
