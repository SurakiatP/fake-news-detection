At Christie\u2019s over the last few weeks, two experts in old master paintings and drawings quietly left the auction house. Their departures followed a year of spotty sales, in which the values of works by old masters  \u2014   a pantheon of European painters working before around 1800  \u2014   fell by 33 percent, according to the 2016 Tefaf Art Market Report. At a time when contemporary art is all the rage among collectors, viewers and donors, many experts are questioning whether old master artwork  \u2014   once the most coveted  \u2014   can stay relevant at auction houses, galleries and museums. Having struggled with shrinking inventory and elusive profits, auction houses appear to be devoting most of their attention and resources to contemporary art, the most popular area of their business. \u201cThey want to be associated with the new and the now,\u201d said Edward Dolman, chairman and chief executive of Phillips auction house, who spent much of his career at Christie\u2019s chasing works by old masters but now focuses on contemporary art. \u201cWe have no intention of selling old masters pictures or     pictures, because these markets are now so small and dwindling,\u201d he added. \u201cThe new client base at the auction houses  \u2014   and the collecting tastes of those clients  \u2014   have moved away from this veneration of the past. \u201d A shortage of old master treasures, fewer    old master specialists and public attention on the   pictures (which are in the contemporary market) are partly responsible for the shift in emphasis. The London dealer Guy Sainty, who has long specialized in old masters, said that he is mystified and frustrated. \u201cI\u2019ve been an art dealer for nearly 40 years, and I just don\u2019t get it  \u2014   I don\u2019t understand where the collectors have gone, the people with knowledge,\u201d he said. \u201dThere\u2019s a sense somewhere that the American collector has simply lost interest in European culture. \u201d The old masters category generally denotes the period after the Renaissance and mostly describes European artists  \u2014   including Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Goya and El Greco  \u2014   who were known for their highly detailed, realistic paintings and drawings, along with the floral still lifes of Flemishmasters like Jan Brueghel the Elder. To be sure, there is still a public appetite for viewing old masters. The Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s show \u201cVig\u00e9e Le Brun: Woman Artist in Revolutionary France,\u201d for example, drew more than 165, 000 visitors. The Getty and the Frick Collection, which focus on historic works, say attendance remains strong. When prime masterworks do come up for auction, they perform well, as evidenced by the $58 million paid in July for Peter Paul Rubens\u2019s \u201cLot and His Daughters\u201d at Christie\u2019s London\u2019s old masters sale, the   expensive work ever sold at auction by the artist. But masterpieces surface only rarely private owners tend to hold onto them, as do museums. \u201cIt\u2019s a real supply problem,\u201d Mr. Dolman said. An appreciation for old masters, experts say, also requires a deeper history of collecting and an educated eye. Christie\u2019s, for example, trains its old master specialists for six to seven years, whereas its contemporary experts get three to four years. And new collectors tend to find contemporary art more accessible. \u201cPeople who buy into the old master field have more connoisseurship  \u2014   maybe more passion,\u201d said Christophe Van de Weghe, a Madison Avenue dealer specializing in   work by modern masters from Matisse to Basquiat. Some attribute the increasing interest in contemporary art to the rising popularity of contemporary architecture. \u201cPeople who come into the contemporary field like colors that go well with their couches,\u201d Mr. Van de Weghe said. \u201cAll these new buildings  \u2014   with high ceilings, big windows,\u201d he added, \u201cthey scream for contemporary art. \u201d Old master curators are also increasingly hard to come by. In university art history programs in the United States, contemporary art is \u201cby far, the most popular,\u201d reports Richard Meyer, an art history professor at Stanford University, in his book \u201cWhat Was Contemporary Art?\u201d (MIT Press, 2013). \u201cWe\u2019re losing a sense of the value of the past, including the value of past art,\u201d Mr. Meyer said in an interview, \u201cnot just the aesthetic value, but the ways in which it can teach us about the cultures and the people who came before us. \u201d To fill curatorial positions, museums are having to look to Europe. The Getty, for example, recently hired Davide Gasparotto  \u2014   the former director of the Galleria Estense in Modena, Italy  \u2014   as its senior curator of paintings. \u201cYou can\u2019t find curators with the right training and knowledge of European art in American art graduate programs anymore,\u201d Mr. Sainty said. \u201cThey want to do contemporary art. \u201d While acknowledging that the old masters market can be \u201cvery spiky,\u201d Alexander Bell, the worldwide   of Sotheby\u2019s old master paintings department, said: \u201cWe still very much believe in old masters,\u201d adding that \u201cwe\u2019ve all got to evolve in the way we present our material and engage with our clients. \u201d The art world is making adjustments, juxtaposing old masters alongside contemporary artists in exhibitions, galleries, art fairs and auction sales. The Metropolitan Museum of Art is planning a $600 million wing for contemporary and modern art in March, it filled its temporary satellite, the Met Breuer, with unfinished works from the 15th century to the present, presenting Renaissance masters like Titian and Rembrandt alongside contemporary artists like Brice Marden and Kerry James Marshall. Last year, the museum started an online series called \u201cThe Artist Project,\u201d in which contemporary artists talk about historical works at the Met that inspired them  \u2014   like John Currin on Ludovico Carracci\u2019s 1582 oil on canvas, \u201cThe Lamentation. \u201d \u201cWhen you hear contemporary artists talking with passion about the genius of old masters  \u2014   that, we assume, will help open up the historical fields to new audiences,\u201d Thomas P. Campbell, the director and chief executive of the Met, said, \u201cto understand that all art was once contemporary. \u201d Similarly, the Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s recent show of old master portrait prints explored how artists like van Dyck influenced contemporary artists like Chuck Close. \u201cWe brought printmaking into the present,\u201d said James Rondeau, the museum\u2019s president and director. This mixing of genres has been prominently tested at Christie\u2019s themed sales, which include works from many different time periods. \u201cPerhaps they would rather put their resources into other, potentially more profitable departments,\u201d said Nicholas Hall, the former   of old master paintings at Christie\u2019s, who left in July, along with Benjamin Peronnet, Christie\u2019s head of old master and   drawings. While the Frick is eager to reach today\u2019s audience, the museum is also wary of straying from its mission of showing classic European art and sculpture. \u201cA lot of museums are focused on a false dichotomy  \u2014   if they get young people in through contemporary exhibitions they\u2019ll stay and get interested in old masters,\u201d said Ian Wardropper, the Frick\u2019s director. \u201cI just don\u2019t believe it. The point is to try to reach them in an intelligent way on their own terms and make it interesting  \u2014   and that\u2019s not easy we\u2019re all struggling with that. \u201d In light of these developments, old masters have become a collecting opportunity. Printings and engravings can go for $4, 000 to $5, 000. While Orazio Gentileschi\u2019s   \u201cDanae\u201d sold at Sotheby\u2019s in January for $30. 5 million, \u201cthat is less than a Christopher Wool and half the price of a Warhol,\u201d Mr. Sainty said. \u201cYou can buy a really good Rembrandt for $40 to $50 million. That\u2019s not a lot of money when you think about how many Rembrandts there are  \u2014   and how many Jeff Koons. \u201d Even as the collecting world continues to obsess over contemporary art, there are bargains to be had in the category of old masters, both at auction and in galleries, particularly if you\u2019d be happy with a print or engraving. A few examples follow of old master works, currently  \u2014   or coming up  \u2014   for sale.
