Markets shook, the pound and euro dropped, and European leaders called emergency meetings after Britons unnerved the Continent by voting to leave the European Union. Exactly how the \u201cBrexit\u201d will unfold is unclear, but Prime Minister David Cameron said he was not the man to lead the country through it and will step down. Here\u2019s a short rundown of the basics. _____ 2. Young people had made up one of the strongest blocs against leaving. \u201cTruly gutted that our grandparents have effectively decided that they hate foreigners more than they love us and our futures,\u201d one tweeted. Some Britons appeared confused about what they had done. Google reported a spike in searches for \u201cWhat happens if we leave the E. U.?\u201d as well as \u201cWhat is the E. U.?\u201d  Thousands of readers posted comments. One wrote: \u201cI\u2019m British, but I\u2019m not sure what that means anymore. \u201d _____ 3. President Obama said Britain\u2019s \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with the U. S. would endure. Donald Trump, whose political base voices the same kind of populist anger heard in Britain, forecast benefits to British business. He included his own Scottish golf resort, which he happened to be visiting. \u201cWhen the pound goes down, more people are coming to Turnberry, frankly,\u201d he said. _____ 4. Bernie Sanders commands a fearsome digital army, adept in social media, that captured more than $200 million in donations. Now he appears to be ready to drop his candidacy and shift his focus. \u201cI\u2019m going to do everything I can do to defeat Donald Trump,\u201d he told MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d  \u2014   including vote for Hillary Clinton. _____ 5. Our movie reviewers have this to say about the this weekend\u2019s big openings: \u201cIndependence Day: Resurgence\u201d is a good bet only for those with an overwhelming love of    . \u201cSwiss Army Man,\u201d with Daniel Radcliffe as a corpse who makes Paul Dano\u2019s life worth living, is \u201cweird and wonderful, disgusting and demented. \u201d And \u201cFree State of Jones\u201d reconstructs a fascinating bit of Civil War history, with Matthew McConaughey leading a guerrilla army of white deserters and escaped slaves against the Confederacy. _____ 6. Mementos of Whitey Bulger\u2019s gruesome career as a Boston mobster went up for auction, five years after he was convicted of 11 murder charges. There was his prized replica of a 1986 Stanley Cup championship ring and a   cup that he used as a pencil holder. The ring marked \u201c1103\u201d above is a sterling silver \u201cPsycho Killer Skull\u201d that he left in a London safe deposit box, along with $50, 000 cash, during his early years as a fugitive. _____ 7. More distress for the deeply troubled Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. The Brazilian laboratory set to handle drug testing was suspended for \u201cnonconformity\u201d with international standards. The lab can appeal, but for the moment, the World   Agency said it would send samples outside Brazil for testing. _____ 8. The swimmer Michael Phelps, now 30 and the most decorated athlete in Olympic history, is aiming for five Olympic berths in trials that begin Sunday. One of our   stories today traces his fall and his resurrection, starting at a treatment center in Arizona. His coach said: \u201cHe hid everything that makes him human for 12 years. The rehab is what opened him up. \u201d _____ 9. West Virginia deployed hundreds of National Guard members and struggled to restore power to thousands of people after storms pounded the state with as much as nine inches of rain over eight hours. At least 14 people were killed in what the National Weather Service called a \u201c     event. \u201d _____ 10. Finally, as schools start their summer breaks, classroom animals are heading out too. Our reporter followed an exodus of gerbils, mice, corn snakes, turtles, rabbits, guinea pigs, geckos, and frogs  \u2014   not to mention Lucy the chinchilla, above  \u2014   in New York City alone. \u201cYou learn new things here,\u201d one girl said of her teacher\u2019s vanishing menagerie. \u201cLike, you have to put vitamins on the mouse before you feed it to the snake. \u201d Have a great weekend! _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.
