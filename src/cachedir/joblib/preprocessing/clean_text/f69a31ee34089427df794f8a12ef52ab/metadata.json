This will mark the first time that a live-action television series debuts in this way. The series will be shown in a two-week window, with its first two episodes slated to air in the late summer of 2017.\\nMarvel Comics is producing their first two episodes in conjunction with ABC studios. \u201cThe Inhumans\u201d was filmed entirely with IMAX digital cameras. Following the premiere on the big screen, ABC will release the weekly series in the fall.\\nWho are The Inhumans? The Inhumans were first introduced into the Marvel Comics, in 1965, by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. During the Kree-Skrull War, which occurred millions of years ago in Earth time, the Kree alien species set up a station on Uranus. As they worked on the station they noticed life on Earth had genetic potential. The Kree started experimenting with humans by splicing Eternals DNA into Cro-Magnons.\\nThe Krees\u2019 goal was two-fold; they wanted to stop their own evolutionary stagnation, as well as create a powerful mutant race of soldiers, to help them fight the Skrulls. Though they were successful in their experiments, the Kree abandoned it.\\nHowever, their test subjects, the Inhumans, survived and formed their own society. They thrived in seclusion and developed advanced technology. After experimenting with the mutagenic Terrigen Mist, they found that although they acquired various powers, the mist also caused genetic damage and deformities.\\nThe Unspoken was once the leader of the Inhumans but was dethroned by the current king, Black Bolt. Bolt\u2019s royal family consists of Maximus the Mad, Triton, Medusa, Karnak, Gorgon, Crystal, and their dog Lockjaw. Moreover, Medusa and Crystal were members of Marvel Comics, Fantastic Four and Crystal also teamed with the Avengers. \u201cThe Inhumans\u201d will surround the never been told story and epic adventures of Black Bolt.\\nABC\u2019s Other Marvel Comic Series \u201cThe Inhumans\u201d marks the latest series to join the ABC network lineup. Unfortunately, last season, the network canceled \u201cAgent Carter,\u201d after two seasons. They also passed on a spin-off of \u201cAgents of SHIELD.\u201d\\nHowever, Marvel Comics is teaming up with Hulu on one of their other comic book-based series, which is in development. Other projects include the upcoming \u201cX-Men\u201d spin-off of \u201cLegion,\u201d on FX.\\nIMAX Marks Its First Debut With \u2018Marvel\u2019s The Inhumans\u2019 Marvel Comic\u2019s presentation of \u201cThe Inhumans\u201d was originally slated for release in 2018, as a movie, rather than a series. However, it was pushed back to 2019, to make room for the Marvel Comic movie, \u201cSpider-Man: Homecoming,\u201d before it was pulled from the schedule, in April 2016.\\nIMAX is setting an unprecedented first, by hosting the premiere of the Marvel Comics television series. The reason being, IMAX is financing the pilot.
