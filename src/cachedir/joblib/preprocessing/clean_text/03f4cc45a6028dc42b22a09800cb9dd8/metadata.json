But lately some of China\u2019s Maoists are finding inspiration in an unlikely insurgent in the West: Donald J. Trump. Mr. Trump \u201chas torn up the old rules of the ruling elites, not just of the capitalist West,\u201d said Zhang Hongliang, a polemicist who is the loudest proponent of what could be loosely called \u201cMaoists for Trump. \u201d In a recent essay, Mr. Zhang lauded the American president as being alone among national leaders daring \u201cto openly promote the political ideas of Chairman Mao. \u201d President Xi Jinping of China will be sizing up Mr. Trump during a visit to his    estate in Florida this week, in the leaders\u2019 first summit meeting. Meanwhile, many ordinary Chinese people have also been taking the measure of the new American president and have been bewildered, incensed and yet, sometimes, inspired. The global wave of nationalist,   sentiment that Mr. Trump rode to power has washed ashore in China, encouraging a   fringe that is hostile to capitalism and Western influence, and that the Communist Party has long sought to cultivate  \u2014   and contain. China\u2019s Maoists are a small minority most Chinese have no desire to revive the ruthless, convulsive politics of the Mao era. But the Maoists\u2019 growing assertiveness, echoed in their embrace of aspects of Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda, could help push the country in a more authoritarian direction. They also complicate the efforts of  Mr. Xi to play both sides of an ideological divide: as a robust defender of Mao\u2019s legacy, but also a proponent of market liberalization and even a champion of globalization in the Trump age. It is a paradox that these admirers of Mao Zedong, a Marxist revolutionary who railed against Western imperialism, have found things to like about this American president, a property tycoon with a cabinet crowded with millionaires. But they want Mr. Xi to take a page from Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d script and protect Chinese workers from layoffs, privatization and foreign competition. \u201cTrump opposes globalization, and so should China,\u201d said one article on Utopia, a popular Maoist website. \u201cTrump\u2019s ideology has oriented toward China, and he is learning from China,\u201d said another   Chinese site. China\u2019s   as they are sometimes called, are loosely united by demands for stringent economic equality, zealous nationalism and a loathing of the capitalist West and liberal democracy. \u201cMany of the same ideas now animating the global populist movement have been the hallmarks of the   movement for over a decade,\u201d said Jude Blanchette, a researcher in Beijing who is writing a book about the movement. \u201cThe   have also clearly benefited from the rise of Xi Jinping, as he has blasted a pretty large dog whistle in their direction,\u201d Mr. Blanchette added. Many on China\u2019s far left see Mr. Trump as a dangerous foe who has questioned established American policy on Taiwan, vowed to confront China\u2019s hold on the disputed South China Sea and threatened to cut Chinese exports to America. But some Maoists say Mr. Trump also offers a model. They think he led a populist revolt that humbled a corrupt political establishment not unlike what they see in China. They cheer his incendiary tactics, sometimes likening them to Mao\u2019s methods. And they hear in his remarks an echo of their own disgust with Western democracy, American interventionism and liberal political values. Maoist meetings and websites dwell on a clutch of enemies, including the C. I. A. and America in general, genetically modified crops and advocates of privatizing state companies. But they reserve a particular venom for liberal Chinese intellectuals and celebrities who have condemned Mao. In the West, Mr. Zhang argued, the nationalists are on the right while the left generally supports internationalism. \u201cBut China is the opposite,\u201d he said. \u201cChinese rightists are the traitors, while Chinese leftists are the patriots. \u201d The Communist Party never repudiated Mao\u2019s legacy after his death in 1976, but it condemned his excesses, including the violent Cultural Revolution, and for years he was ignored or discredited while Deng Xiaoping pursued economic liberalization. In the 1990s, though, the party refurbished Mao\u2019s image and fostered a popular revival to bolster its authority and blunt calls for political liberalization. Officials started using Maoists to intimidate liberal academics, dissidents and other critics. Before Mr. Xi came to power in 2012, a political rival, Bo Xilai, openly encouraged \u201cred\u201d nostalgia for the Mao era as part of an effort to build a populist power base. Mr. Bo was purged in a scandal, but the Maoists regrouped as Mr. Xi associated himself more closely with Mao\u2019s legacy than his predecessors and called for a return to Marxist purity. Under Mr. Xi, Maoists have become bolder in taking to the streets and organizing online campaigns. A court ruling last year and legislation adopted last month protecting Communist heroes buoyed them further. Nobody expects Maoists to seize power in Beijing. They are disdained by the middle class and kept on a tether by the party authorities. Across China, there are maybe a few thousand active supporters of Maoist groups and causes, and their petitions against liberal intellectuals have gathered tens of thousands of signatures online, according to Mr. Blanchette, the researcher. But the Chinese left\u2019s broader message of muscular nationalism and its criticism of widening inequality have reverberated, especially among retirees,   workers and former party officials dismayed by extravagant wealth and corruption. Mr. Trump and the global surge of nationalism and populism have added to the political tinder. Dai Jianzhong, a sociologist in Beijing, said Maoists could gain a bigger following if an economic slowdown caused mass layoffs, or if tensions with the United States escalated into confrontation. \u201cIt was a big shock for China to see American   society overwhelmed by this tide of populism,\u201d Mr. Dai said. \u201cChina is a different society, but if the economy stagnates and workers feel badly let down, populism will gain influence. The influence of Maoists and ultraleftists would spread. \u201d In January, about a hundred protesters gathered in Jinan, a provincial capital in eastern China, to condemn a professor of communications and advertising, Deng Xiangchao, who had dared criticize Mao online. They chanted and held banners near Mr. Deng\u2019s home, reviling him as a \u201ctraitor\u201d and \u201cenemy of the people,\u201d and roughed up a few people who came to show their support for him. \u201cWe love Chairman Mao because we\u2019re poor, and the poor all love Chairman Mao,\u201d Yang Jianguo, a retired worker who was among the protesters, said by telephone after the protest. The university swiftly dismissed Mr. Deng rather than engage in a prolonged battle with the Maoists. Later,   activists also successfully demanded the dismissal of a television station worker who had voiced support for Mr. Deng. It would be unthinkable for the party to be so obliging of protesters for free speech or other causes the party considers anathema. But while Mr. Xi has silenced the party\u2019s liberal critics, the party has tolerated, even abetted, its   opponents, giving the Maoist populists room to grow stronger. \u201cTheir influence has clearly grown with the leftist turn in ideology, especially since 2015,\u201d said Deng Yuwen, a current affairs writer in Beijing who has criticized the Maoists. \u201cIt\u2019s not that the top level of the party directly controls them, but the Maoists are politically astute, and they have a good sense of what they can get away with,\u201d he added. \u201cThey know the officials use them, but they also use the officials. \u201d While party leaders may find them useful for intimidating critics, the Maoists want to take China in a different direction and reverse market policies that have fueled decades of growth, by seizing the assets of the rich and strengthening state ownership of industry, for example. Most phrase their criticism of the party carefully, but some openly accuse it of betraying Mao. \u201cChina is a capitalist state under socialist guise,\u201d said Mr. Yang, the retired worker. \u201cCapitalists dominate the country. \u201d Asked about the American president, Mr. Yang was more generous: \u201cTrump has socialist tendencies, because the way he won power in a way reflected the workers\u2019 demands. \u201d Many Maoists see Mr. Xi as a fellow traveler who is taking China in the right direction by restoring respect for Mao and Marx. But others say privately that even Mr. Xi may not be a dependable ally. They point out that he has promoted himself abroad as a proponent of expanding global trade and a friend of multinational corporations, drawing an implicit contrast with Mr. Trump. He Weifang, a law professor at Peking University who is often reviled by China\u2019s far left, said Mr. Xi was playing a dangerous game by allowing Maoist populists to silence liberal voices and risked igniting political fires that he cannot easily control. \u201cIf political currents in China increasingly converge with populism,\u201d Mr. He added, \u201cthat would have a powerful effect on China\u2019s future. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563101.4683907}
