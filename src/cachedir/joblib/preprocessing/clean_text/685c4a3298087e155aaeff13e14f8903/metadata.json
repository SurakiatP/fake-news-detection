At this point in the election, hasn\u2019t anyone learned that NOTHING is what it seems when first reported by the media? Anyone at all? \u201cBut\u2026 but\u2026 but\u2026 the media says that Comey\u2019s announcement took everyone by surprise\u2026 even the President\u2026\u201d \\nRight\u2026 and I\\'ve got some oceanfront property in Arizona I\\'d like to sell you. Are you interested? Correct me if I\\'m wrong, but are we talking about the same media that less than 10% of Americans thinks is honest and trustworthy? Exactly! My fellow countrymen, especially my fellow Trump supporters, beware! Beware that we don\\'t all get lured into a perfect example of \"rope a dope,\" by the very same people and institutions we already know haven\\'t given us the honest truth about much of anything since long before this election season began. \\nIn the video below, I review the facts that cannot be denied, and ask the question, \u201cWhy isn\u2019t the media telling you this?\u201d \\nThe RT Reports: \\nThe FBI has learned of more emails involving Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server while she headed the State Department, FBI Director James Comey told several members of Congress, telling them he is reopening the investigation. \\n\u201cIn connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of email that appear to be pertinent\u201d to Clinton\u2019s investigation, Comey wrote to the chairs of several relevant congressional committees, adding that he was briefed about the messages on Thursday. \u201cI agree that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.\u201d \\nThe FBI director cautioned, however, that the bureau has yet to assess the importance of the material, and that he doesn\u2019t know how long that will take. \\nThe Clinton campaign has yet to comment, but an aide told CNN: \u201cWe\u2019re learning about this just like you all are.\u201d \\nDemocratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine was asked about Comey\u2019s letter while campaigning at an early voting site in Tallahassee, Florida. \u201cGotta read a little more, gotta read a little more,\u201d he told reporters. \\nRepresentative Bob Goodlatte (R-Virginia), chair of the House Judiciary Committee, praised the decision to reopen the case. \\n\u201cNow that the FBI has reopened the matter, it must conduct the investigation with impartiality and thoroughness,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe American people deserve no less and no one should be above the law.\u201d \\nAlmost 15,000 new Clinton emails were discovered in September, but it\\'s unclear if the announced investigation relates to them or other correspondence. The newly discovered emails are not related to Wikileaks or the Clinton Foundation, law enforcement sources told CNN\u2019s Evan Perez. \\nThe messages were not found on the private email server in the Clintons\u2019 New York residence, a government source told Reuters. \\nThe emails were apparently discovered as part of the sexting probe into former Representative Anthony Weiner (D-New York), the New York Times reported. His electronic devices, as well as those belonging to his wife, senior Clinton aide Huma Abedin, were seized during that investigation. \\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin) renewed his call for Director of National Intelligence James Clapper to \u201csuspend all classified briefings for Secretary Clinton until this matter is fully resolved.\u201d \\n\u201cYet again, Hillary Clinton has nobody but herself to blame,\u201d Ryan said in a statement. \u201cThis decision, long overdue, is the result of her reckless use of a private email server, and her refusal to be forthcoming with federal investigators.\u201d \\nKellyanne Conway, Republican nominee Donald Trump \u2019s campaign manager, applauded the decision. \\n\u201cThat is superb. That is extraordinary news for the American people,\u201d she told Yahoo News. \"A great day in our campaign just got even better,\" she tweeted. \\n\u201cThey are reopening the case into her criminal and illegal conduct that threatens the security of the United States,\u201d Trump said in Manchester, New Hampshire, 10 minutes after learning about the reopening of the case. \u201cWe must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office.\u201d \\n\u201cI have great respect for the fact that the FBI and the Department of Justice have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was a grave miscarriage of justice that the American people fully understand, and it is everybody\u2019s hope that it is about to be corrected.\u201d \\n\u201cWith that being said, the rest of my speech is going to be so boring. Should I even make the speech?\u201d he joked before turning to his prepared remarks. \\nThe \u201cFBI reopening investigation isn\u2019t an October surprise, it\u2019s an October nuclear explosion,\u201d conservative political commentator Ben Shapiro wrote as part of a tweetstorm, adding that \u201cComey [is] trying to cover his a** 11 days before [the] election\u201d and wondering if a \u201cpre-emptive impeachment of a president elect\u201d is possible because \u201cthe odds on President Tim Kaine just rose substantially.\u201d \\nAn \u2018October Surprise\u2018 is a major event that happens in the month before the election that affects the outcome of the vote. \\nIn response to the announcement, the Democratic Coalition Against Trump filed a complaint with the Department of Justice against Comey. \\n\u201cIt is absolutely absurd that FBI Director Comey would support Donald Trump like this with only 11 days to go before the election,\u201d Scott Dworkin, senior advisor to the Democratic Coalition Against Trump , said in a statement . \u201cIt is an obvious attack from a lifelong Republican who used to serve in the Bush White House, just to undermine her campaign. Comey needs to focus on stopping terrorists and protecting America, not investigating our soon to be President-Elect Hillary Clinton.\u201d \\nStocks fell after Comey\u2019s announcement, CNBC reported. \\nArticle posted with permission from The Last Great Stand .
