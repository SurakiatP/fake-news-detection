A true Outsider. \\nThe New York Times captured it perfectly if unintentionally in an article today: Journalists, it said \u201cportrayed Trump supporters as out of touch with reality. In the end, it was the other way around.\u201d \\nThe Establishment is out of touch with reality. No one told them being an Outsider was in. \\nAs well, no one told them that, despite their Fed-induced papered-over recovery in which 95% of the wealth gained in the U.S. since 2009 went to the top 1%, most of the country is utterly pissed off. \\nThat\u2019s what you saw last night: high turnout of the pissed off vote. \\nPissed off at all the things we\u2019ve covered in these pages for years: \u2013 Political payola \u2013 Continued bank scandals with no prosecution \u2013 Incessant war \u2013 No wage growth (over half of full-time workers make $30k or less) \u2013 Complete civilian surveillance \u2013 General \u2018above the law\u2019 attitude of elites \\nHillary Clinton was a true poster girl of the Establishment, and the election easily became a referendum on it and her rather than anything else. \\nDonald Trump didn\u2019t win. The Establishment lost. \\nI say this not as a Trump supporter. Indeed, I voted for Gary Johnson. \\nRather, I\u2019m simply pointing out that, as they have been for years, Outsiders are now rising up. They, and their ideas. \\nThere\u2019s still much further to go, of course, for America to get back on track. But I truly view the election of an Outsider as one small step in the right direction. \\nAt least the general electorate is finally repudiating the status quo. \\nThe years ahead are going to be interesting \u2014 politically, economically, and financially.
