The main question that polling firms typically ask respondents in any contest is how they intend to vote. In the case of the referendum on \u201cBrexit,\u201d as a possible British exit from the E. U. is known, the polls straightforwardly ask people if they want to remain in the union or leave. After a string of polls showing a sizable lead for \u201cleave,\u201d polls released in the last few days effectively show a tie, or a small lead for remaining. This shift away from \u201cleave\u201d prompted a rally in global markets on Monday. But one of those polls, conducted by Survation, also asked voters which side they expected to win. Asking people to predict a result of an election has, over time, provided more accurate forecasts than asking people their voting intentions, according to a study by Justin Wolfers, a University of Michigan economist and an Upshot contributor, and David Rothschild, of the Microsoft Research and Statistics Center. When Survation asked, \u201cRegardless of how you plan to vote, what do you think the result will be?\u201d just shy of 40 percent of people said the \u201cremain\u201d camp would win. Only 26 percent said that \u201cleave\u201d would prevail. The remaining 34 percent said they did not know what the result would be. Mr. Rothschild said the \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d figure is high for this sort of question. But he noted that undecided voters tend to support the status quo, in part because they are more   and may be less informed. Also notable: Supporters of the leave camp don\u2019t seem to have a high level of confidence that their side will prevail. Some 35 percent of \u201cleave\u201d supporters said they thought \u201cremain\u201d would win. By contrast, only 14 percent of \u201cremain\u201d supporters predicted that \u201cleave\u201d would win. Of course, this is not a guaranteed indicator the Brexit referendum may be a vote that reveals its limitations. All things considered, though, \u201cremain\u201d seems to be in a strong position in these last days before the vote. The surge in the polls for \u201cleave\u201d appears to have been stalled, or even reversed. The betting markets suggest a roughly 75 percent chance of a victory for \u201cremain. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563338.9081893}
