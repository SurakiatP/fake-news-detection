Cross posted fom Wolf Street \\nOn October 30, the French government announced, as quietly as possible, the creation of a massive new database that will collect and store personal information and biometric data on nearly everyone living in the country. As tends to happen whenever a government seeks to enact this type of \u201creforms,\u201d the law wasn\u2019t passed by parliament but by decree on the eve of a national holiday. \\nAs France 24 reports , the new decree will affect 60 million people and \u201cmarks the first time the country has collected population data on such a scale since the start of the Nazi Occupation in 1940.\u201d \\n\u201cUnacceptable Excesses\u201d \\nThe move has sparked outrage from civil rights groups as well as French media, with weekly magazine L\u2019Observateur describing it as \u201c terrifying ,\u201d and daily newspaper Lib\u00e9ration dubbing it a \u201c mega database that will do no good \u201d. The National Digital Council (CNNum) \u201claments\u201d the government\u2019s lack of prior consultation and highlights the \u201cmany concerns\u201d the new decree raises. \u201cIn a digital world where code is law, the existence of such a database leaves the door wide open to likely and unacceptable excesses,\u201d it said. \\nThe new database, known rather optimistically as Secure Electronic Documents ( Titres \u00e9lectroniques s\u00e9curis\u00e9s or TES) will store an individual\u2019s name, date and place of birth, gender, eye color, height, address, photograph, digitized fingerprints, facial features, e-mail address, and the names, nationalities, dates and places of birth of parents. The aim \u2014 according to the government \u2014 is to make it easier to obtain and renew identity documents, and to aid in the fight against identity fraud. \\nUnlike a similar law proposed by Nicholas Sarkozy\u2019s conservative government in 2012, which was shot down, the new database will only be used to authenticate individuals, not to identify them. In other words, it will be used to confirm that someone is who he or she claims to be, not to discover, say, the identity of someone whose biometrics have been found at the scene of a crime. \\nHowever, the potential for mission creep cannot be discounted. As an article in NextInpact points out , once the database exists, it is highly likely that there will be calls for it to be used for identification purposes, simply \u201cbecause it is there.\u201d There\u2019s also good reason to suspect that a future government \u201cwill modify the aims,\u201d as warns Ga\u00ebtan Gorce, a French senator and member of the National Commission for Information Technology and Civil Liberties (Cnil) who likened the TES to a \u201csort of monster.\u201d \\nAccording to today\u2019s government, the biometric data stored on the database could be used to identify criminal suspects only if \u201cviolations of the fundamental interests of the Nation and acts of terrorism\u201d are involved. But who gets to decide what constitutes a \u201cfundamental interest of the Nation\u201d or, for that matter, \u201can act of terrorism\u201d? [That was a rhetorical question, of course]. \\nA Hacker\u2019s Paradise \\nAnother major problem with centralizing biometric data to this extent is that you make it a lot easier for it to be compromised. What\u2019s to stop an insider from copying this data onto a drive and walking out with it, as Snowden and others have, including those who took Swiss banking data to the French and German authorities for money laundering investigations? This data would then most likely be sold online, on the so-called darknet. \\n\u201cNo computer system is impenetrable. All databases can be hacked. It\u2019s always just a matter of time,\u201d thundered French left-wing politician Jean-Jacques Urvoas in a 2012 blog post against Sarkozy\u2019s proposed biometrics super database. Urvoas is now justice minister in Hollande\u2019s government and hence is directly involved in drawing up the new decree, which bears a striking resemblance to Sarkozy\u2019s earlier initiative. \\nIf biometric data is compromised, it is a far more serious issue than a compromised password or an account. You can create a new password many times. But you can create your biometrics only once. If they\u2019re compromised, they remain compromised forever. \\nThere\u2019s still a possibility that France\u2019s constitutional council will throw the new law out, as it did with Sarkozy\u2019s. If it doesn\u2019t, TES risks establishing a very dangerous precedent . \\nUntil now the most extensive biometric data retention schemes have been rolled out (perfected?) in war zones like Iraq and Afghanistan . Israel is also on the verge of creating its own centralized biometric database. But if TES were allowed to stand, France would become the first G7 nation to attempt to build a completely centralized, all-inclusive biometric database. And that would send a very clear signal \u2014 i.e. green for go \u2014 to other ostensibly democratic nations. \\nThere\u2019s also the fact that after Germany, France is the country with the most influence over the future direction of EU policy. The EU already has a biometrics super database called the Visa Information System (VIS), which is the largest shared database on maintaining public security, supporting police and judicial cooperation, and managing external border control in Europe. \\nIf the elected representatives of the 66 million people of France can pass into law a completely centralized system of biometric data storage with absolutely no public consultation whatsoever, what\u2019s to stop the European Commission\u2019s ranks of faceless, unelected, power-hungry appointees from doing the same? Nothing. \\nBesides aspiring to becoming a pioneer in the collection and use of personal data of all its citizens, France\u2019s government is also one of the most ruthless combatants in the global war on cash, which is progressing on schedule.
