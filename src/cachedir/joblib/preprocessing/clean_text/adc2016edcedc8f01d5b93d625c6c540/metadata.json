OK?\u201d the 58-year-old Rebel Heart singer told an audience at New York\u2019s Madison Square Garden Tuesday night. \u201cI\u2019m really good. I\u2019m not a douche, and I\u2019m not a tool. I take my time, I have a lot of eye contact, and I do swallow.\u201d \\nThe comments came as Madonna warmed up the crowd with a very brief standup set ahead of the Trainwreck star\u2019s performance at the Garden Tuesday night, according to the New York Daily News . \\nSchumer took the stage afterward for her first stand-up gig since hundreds of supporters of Republican candidate Donald Trump stood up and walked out of her performance in Tampa, Florida earlier this week after the comedian called him an \u201corange monster.\u201d As Breitbart previously reported, Shumer was widely booed during the performance at Tampa\u2019s Amalie Arena, where she instructed security to remove hecklers. \\nDuring her performance Tuesday night, Schumer read aloud a letter she composed in response to the Trump fans who walked out on her show in Tampa. \\n\u201cDearest Tampa, I\u2019m sorry you didn\u2019t want me, a comedian who talks about what she believes in, to mention the biggest thing going on in our country right now,\u201d Schumer said, adding: \u201cHow could I think it was OK to spend five minutes having a peaceful conversation with someone with different views? After the show, I want you to know that I will go straight to a rehab facility.\u201d \\nThe comedian added that she looks forward to \u201cputting this all behind us\u201d in November, when \u201c Hillary Clinton is our motherf*cking president.\u201d \\nMadonna has previously used sex appeal to drum up support for the Democratic presidential candidate; in September, the singer joined fellow pop star Katy Perry in stripping off her clothes to encourage Clinton voters to head to the polls in November.
