Two years ago, the young preschooler moved to a neighboring town, leaving behind his best friend, Erling Kindem, a World War II veteran who lived next door. \\nLast week, the time arrived for a final goodbye. \\nErling, 91, died last Saturday, just three days after 6-year-old Emmett paid a visit to the nursing home where he was receiving hospice care. \\n\u201cAfter we told Emmett that Erling had passed away, he was very quiet for a while,\u201d his mother Anika Rychner told TODAY. \u201cThe first thing he said was, \u2018So we\u2019ll just have to wait a really long time. I know we\u2019ll see him again in heaven.\u2019\u201d \\nFor more than a decade, the two families lived next to each other in a Minneapolis suburb, but didn\u2019t have much of a relationship beyond saying hello. That changed after Emmett came along. \\n\u201cHe was about 2 when this all started. He would start venturing over to Erling\u2019s backyard when he was out in his garden with his tomatoes,\u201d Rychner recalled. \\nOne day, when Emmett saw Erling pouring dirt around his new sidewalk, he grabbed his toy shovel and wheelbarrow and walked over. \\nErling was tickled by his new companion and they instantly bonded. \\nFrom then, Emmett went outside anytime he spotted his buddy. \u201cHe would also go knock on Erling\u2019s door and ask if Erling could play,\u201d his mother recalled with a laugh. \\nThe two had lawn mower races (Emmett rode his electric toy mower). They played croquet and rode bicycles. And they cared for Erling\u2019s garden, which grew one of the boy\u2019s favorite foods, tomatoes. \\n\u201cHe especially liked the cherry ones that he could pick right there and eat in the garden. So he\u2019d help Dad weed the garden,\u201d Erling\u2019s son, Charlie Kindem, told TODAY. \\nTwo years ago, Emmett\u2019s growing family moved away to the countryside. A month later, Erling and his wife moved to a senior apartment. But the two friends continued to visit each other regularly. Photo courtesy Anika Rychner \\n\u201cErling was still driving when we moved away, so we would sometimes come home and find tomatoes from his garden on our front porch, or a note for Emmett with some other treasure he brought him,\u201d Rychner said. \\n\u201cIf we hadn\u2019t visited in a while, Erling would call, and we would go visit,\u201d she said. \u201cOr sometimes the kids we\u2019d say, \u2018We should go see Erling,\u2019 and we would stop on our way home from school.\u201d \\nEmmett often drew pictures of B-24 bomber planes for his friend, who served as a radio operator and gunner during World War II. \\n\u201cA lot of kids are not comfortable around elderly people because they look different. Emmett always was,\u201d Rychner said. \u201cHe was never was shy about hugging Erling and holding his hand.\u201d \\nWhen Erling\u2019s wife, Joyce, with whom he had five children, died last fall, Emmett and his family attended her funeral. \\n\u201cIt was a natural thing,\u201d Kindem said of his father\u2019s relationship with Emmett. \u201cHe didn\u2019t talk down to him at all. He talked to him like he was a regular person and not a little kid.\u201d \\nBut Erling was always like that, his son said. \\n\u201cDad was always friendly with kids. Growing up, he would play with us, whether it was baseball or football,\u201d he said. He recalled how Erling flooded the vacant lot next door to their home every winter to turn it into an ice rink. \\nThis past spring, Erling moved into an assisted living home. But his heart condition began to worsen and last month, he moved into a nursing home, where he received hospice care. \\nEmmett saw his friend the day after he moved in, and again last week. That was when Emmett read his friend the Lord\u2019s prayer, and Erling encouraged his buddy to listen to his parents. Their final goodbye\u2026 \\n\u201cIt felt like a goodbye,\u201d Rychner said. Erling passed away three days later. \\nEmmett has been more quiet than usual, but appears to have absorbed the news, in part because his parents had been preparing him. Rychner said she considers it \u201ca wonderful gift\u201d that Emmett had the chance to experience the decline of a friend\u2019s health in such a positive, natural way. \\nShe felt proud her son didn\u2019t shy away from Erling, even in his illness. \\n\u201cWe all have to experience death at some point in our life of a loved one. That\u2019s an important part of growing up. You can\u2019t avoid it,\u201d she said. \\nBoth Rychner and Kindem said they have been moved by the outpouring of support since NBC-affiliate KARE first reported their story two years ago. The station continued to chronicle the friendship and reported the news of Erling\u2019s death. \\n\u201cHe has strong faith that he will see him again,\u201d Rychner said. \\nDCG'"}, "time": 1742628311.5629716}
