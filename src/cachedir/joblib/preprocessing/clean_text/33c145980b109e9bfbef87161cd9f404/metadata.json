Going through high school and college it was no different. In fact, my dietary change did not come until I was in my 30\u2019s. \\nJust to put things in perspective, after I graduated from Weequahic High School and before going to Seton Hall University, I had a part-time job working for a butcher. I was the delivery guy and occasionally had to go to the slaughterhouse to pick up products for the store. Needless to say, I had no consciousness nor awareness, as change never came then, despite the horrors I witnessed on an almost daily basis. \\nAfter graduating with a degree in accounting from Seton Hall, I eventually got married and moved to a town called Livingston. Livingston was basically a yuppie community where everyone was judged by the neighborhood they lived in and their income. To say it was a \u201cplastic\u201d community would be an understatement. \\nLivingston and the shallowness finally got to me. I told my wife I was fed up and wanted to move. She made it clear she had to be near her friends and New York City. I finally got my act together and split for Colorado. \\nI was living with a lady in Aspen at the end of 1974, when one day she said, \u201d let\u2019s become vegetarians\u201d. I have no idea what possessed me to say it, but I said, \u201cokay\u201d! \\nAt that point I went to the freezer and took out about $100 worth of frozen, dead body parts and gave them to a welfare mother who lived behind us. \\nWell, everything was great for about a week or so, and then the chick split with another guy. \\nSo here I was, a vegetarian for a couple weeks, not really knowing what to do, how to cook, or basically how to prepare anything. For about a month, I was getting by on carrot sticks, celery sticks, and yogurt. Fortunately, when I went vegan in 1990, it was a simple and natural progression. Anyway, as I walked around Aspen town, I noticed a little vegetarian restaurant called, \u201cThe Little Kitchen\u201d. \\nLet me back up just a little bit. It was April of 1975, the snow was melting and the runoff of Ajax Mountain filled the streets full of knee-deep mud. Now, Aspen was great to ski in, but was a bummer to walk in when the snow was melting. \\nI was ready to call it quits and I needed a warmer place. I\u2019ll elaborate on that in a minute. \\nBut right now, back to \u201cThe Little Kitchen\u201d. Knowing that I was going to leave Aspen and basically a new vegetarian, I needed help. So, I cruised into the restaurant and told them my plight and asked them if they would teach me how to cook. I told them in return I would wash dishes and empty their trash. They then asked me what I did for a living and I told them I was an accountant. \\nThe owner said to me, \u201cLet\u2019s make a deal. You do our tax return and we\u2019ll feed you as well\u201d. So for the next couple of weeks I was doing their tax return, washing their dishes, emptying the trash, eating three squares a day and learning as much as I could. \\nBut, like I said, the mud was getting to me. So I picked up a travel book written by a guy named Foder. The name of the book was, \u201cHawaii\u201d. Looking through the book I noticed that in Lahaina, on Maui, there was a little vegetarian restaurant called,\u201d Mr. Natural\u2019s\u201d. I decided right then and there that I would go to Lahaina and work at \u201cMr. Natural\u2019s.\u201d To make a long story short, that\u2019s exactly what happened. \\nSo, I\u2019m working at \u201cMr. Natural\u2019s\u201d and learning everything I can about my new dietary lifestyle \u2013 it was great. Every afternoon we would close for lunch at about 1 PM and go to the Sheraton Hotel in Ka\u2019anapali and play volleyball, while somebody stayed behind to prepare dinner. \\nSince I was the new guy, and didn\u2019t really know how to cook, I never thought that I would be asked to stay behind to cook dinner. Well, one afternoon, that\u2019s exactly what happened; it was my turn. That posed a problem for me because I was at the point where I finally knew how to boil water. \\nI was desperate, clueless and basically up the creek without a paddle. Fortunately, there was a friend of mine sitting in the gazebo at the restaurant and I asked him if he knew how to cook. He said the only thing he knew how to cook was enchiladas. He said that his enchiladas were bean-less and dairy-less. I told him that I had no idea what an enchilada was or what he was talking about, but I needed him to show me because it was my turn to do the evening meal. \\nWell, the guys came back from playing volleyball and I\u2019m asked what was for dinner. I told them enchiladas; the owner wasn\u2019t thrilled. I told him that mine were bean-less and dairy-less. When he tried the enchilada he said it was incredible. Being the humble guy that I was, I smiled and said, \u201cYou expected anything less\u201d? It apparently was so good that it was the only item on the menu that we served twice a week. In fact, after about a week, we were selling five dozen every night we had them on the menu and people would walk around Lahaina broadcasting, \u2018enchilada\u2019s at \u201cNatural\u2019s\u201d tonight\u2019. I never had to cook anything else. \\nA year later the restaurant closed, and somehow I gravitated to a little health food store in Wailuku. I never told anyone I was an accountant and basically relegated myself to being the truck driver. \\nThe guys who were running the health food store had friends in similar businesses and farms on many of the islands. I told them that if they could organize and form one company they could probably lock in the State. That\u2019s when they found out I was an accountant and \u201cDown to Earth\u201d was born. \u201cDown to Earth\u201d became the largest natural food store chain in the islands, and I was their Chief Financial Officer and co-manager of their biggest store for 13 years. \\nIn 1981, I started to do a weekly radio show to try and expose people to a vegetarian diet and get them away from killing innocent creatures. I still do that show today. I pay for my own airtime and have no sponsors to not compromise my honesty. One bit of a hassle was the fact that I was forced to get a Masters Degree in Nutrition to shut up all the MD\u2019s that would call in asking for my credentials. \\nMy doing this radio show enabled me, through endless research, to see the corruption that existed within the big food industries, the big pharmaceutical companies, the biotech industries and the government agencies. \\nThis information, unconscionable as it is, enabled me to realize how broken our health system is. \\nI left Down to Earth in 1989, got nationally certified as a sports injury massage therapist and started traveling the world with a bunch of guys that were making a martial arts movie. After doing that for about four years I finally made it back to Honolulu and got a job as a massage therapist at the Honolulu Club, one of Hawaii\u2019s premier fitness clubs. \\nIt was there I met the love of my life who I have been with since 1998. She made me an offer I couldn\u2019t refuse. She said,\u201d If you want to be with me you\u2019ve got to stop working on naked women\u201d. So, I went back into accounting and was the Chief Financial Officer of a large construction company for many years. \\nGoing back to my Newark days when I was an infant, I had no idea what a \u201cchicken\u201d or \u201cegg\u201d or \u201cfish\u201d or \u201cpig\u201d or \u201ccow\u201d was. My dietary blueprint was thrust upon me by my parents as theirs was thrust upon them by their parents. It was by the grace of God that I was able to put things in their proper perspective and improve my health and elevate my consciousness. \\nThe road that I started walking down in 1975 has finally led me to the point of writing my book, A Sane Diet For An Insane World. Hopefully, the information contained therein will be enlightening, motivating, and inspiring to encourage you to make different choices. \\nDoing what we do out of conditioning is not always the best course to follow. I am hoping that by the grace of the many friends and personalities I have encountered along my path, you will have a better perspective of what road is the best road for you to travel on, not only for your health but your consciousness as well. \\nAloha! \\nTo learn more about Hesh, listen to and read hundreds of health related radio shows and articles, and learn about how to stay healthy and reverse degenerative diseases through the use of organic sulfur crystals and the most incredible bee pollen ever, please visit www.healthtalkhawaii.com, or email me at heshgoldstein@gmail.com or call me at (808) 258-1177.

In Hawaii, the TV stations interview local authors about the books they write and the newspapers all do book reviews. Not one would touch \u201cA Sane Diet For An Insane World\u201d. Why? Because it goes against their advertising dollars. You might also like\u2026'"}, "time": 1742563151.8101878}
