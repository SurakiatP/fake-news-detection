Ilhan is a former refugee from Somalia, is Muslim and is a mother of three. Ilhan Omar has made history in the U.S. \\nIlhan won House District 60B in southeast Minneapolis with 80% of the vote. \\nIlhan, who is 34 and a Minnesota resident said: \u201cThis really was a victory for that 8-year-old in that refugee camp. This was a victory for the young woman being forced into child marriage. This was a victory for every person that\u2019s been told they have limits on their dreams.\u201d \\n\u201cI think I bring the voice of young people. I think I bring the voice of women in the East African community. I bring the voice of Muslims. I bring the voice of young mothers looking for opportunities.\u201d \\nShe is the youngest of seven children who fled from the Somali civil war and spent four years in a Kenyan refugee camp. In 1995 she and her family arrived in the U.S. and Ilhan spoke only Somali. Shortly after, her English improved and she began translating for her grandfather at local political events. Ilhan Omar gives hope to her supporters. \\nOmar\u2019s husband also spoke and began to describe his wife as a strong, Muslim woman: \\n\u201cFor those men \u2014 wooo! \u2014 let me tell you something. When you see a strong, African, Muslim woman, don\u2019t be afraid, no, you know what, appreciate that. That\u2019s the model, that\u2019s the new 2016, going into 2017.\u201d \\nIlhan\u2019s focus will be on renewable energy, sustainability, justice and the common good for all people. \\nAlso making history on Election Day was Stockton, CA Michael Tubbs, who is 26 and is Stockton\u2019s first black mayor. Michael Tubbs became Stockton, CA\u2019s first black mayor. \\n\u201cWe have a great opportunity to show the nation, \u2018How do you reinvent yourself?\u2019 I\u2019m tired of talking about where we\u2019ve been. I\u2019m more interested in talking about where we\u2019re going. We have to mature as a community and start demanding solutions.\u201d \\nWhile the Presidential Election has many outraged, perhaps we can look at the positive that has come from this election as well as intend for more positive results to come from all elected leaders. What we need now more than ever is unity and focus towards building a better world. This must begin now and it must include us all.
