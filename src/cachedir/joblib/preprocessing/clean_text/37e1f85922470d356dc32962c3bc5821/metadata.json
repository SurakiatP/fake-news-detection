A. operative, got her break as a Playboy Bunny, married Christian Bale\u2019s father and now produces a show for the cable television channel Viceland, the home of \u201cBalls Deep\u201d and \u201cAction Bronson Watches Ancient Aliens. \u201d Beyond that, there are some gaps in her r\u00e9sum\u00e9. On a recent afternoon in her Upper East Side apartment, she addressed one of those gaps. She was wearing a Toledo Mud Hens   and moving gingerly because of back pain. The gap concerned Stephen Sondheim, and the time Ms. Steinem asked him to create crossword puzzles for New York magazine. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d she asked. \u201cNobody knows that. \u201d It was 1968, as the magazine was just starting. Ms. Steinem knew Mr. Sondheim was a fiend for   crossword puzzles. Mr. Sondheim, who is now 86, did end up writing puzzles for the magazine in its first year, until quitting to write the musical \u201cCompany. \u201d Ms. Steinem, now 82, went on to other pursuits as well. At an age when many are happy to slow down, Ms. Steinem still keeps a rock star\u2019s schedule, promoting her most recent book, \u201cMy Life on the Road,\u201d stumping for Hillary Clinton, and raising money for causes like Planned Parenthood and a proposed \u201cWomen\u2019s Building\u201d in New York City. Rolling into breakfast recently, after a weekend in North Carolina promoting her book and the candidacy of Deborah Ross, a Democrat, for the United States Senate, Ms. Steinem said she had been up until 5 a. m. revising a piece for The Boston Globe about her opposition to a proposed oil pipeline on tribal lands in North Dakota. Next up, she has \u201ctwo or three\u201d books she wants to write, and another season of \u201cWoman,\u201d the documentary series she produced for Viceland, which was nominated for an Emmy. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine not working,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not even working well, it\u2019s an addiction, really, but I can\u2019t imagine not doing it. \u201d She added, \u201cIt\u2019s possible that more people are requesting me to speak because they think I\u2019m going to die, given that I\u2019m 82. \u201d Ms. Steinem has a disarming laugh that seems to say, \u201cCan you believe the silly thing Gloria Steinem just said?\u201d After she has spent so much time in the public eye, I asked how she would write her job description. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I have to put down something on a form I say writer, because that came first. \u201d She hunted around for another word. \u201cAnd organizer. I don\u2019t know how else to say it. \u201d Ms. Steinem would also call herself a New Yorker, a fact that sometimes gets lost amid her   biography. She has lived in the same apartment for nearly 50 years, since she and a friend rented the parlor floor of what is now a duplex for $300 a month. In 1969, when she was writing for New York magazine, she considered running for city comptroller on a ticket with Norman Mailer and Jimmy Breslin, whose platform included building a monorail around Manhattan. It was, she said, a literary lark. \u201cNobody ever imagined being in office,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was out of love of New York and imagining what it could be. I think somebody asked Jimmy what he would do if he won, and he said, \u2018Demand a recount. \u2019\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t live anywhere else,\u201d she said. Like a true New Yorker, she has never learned to drive. In the living room where she held the first meetings for what would become Ms. magazine in 1971, she recalled the day she fell in love with the city, on a visit from Smith College in the  . \u201cI was walking in the theater district, and I stopped by a delicatessen,\u201d she said, \u201cand there were three or four showgirls from some Broadway show, and they were in full regalia and headdresses and makeup, and they were standing there and ordering pastrami sandwiches, and nobody gave it a second thought. And I thought, Oh, I want to live here. \u201d Later, when she moved here, she made a list of things New Yorkers did that scared her. \u201cOne was that they said things three times that we in the Midwest wouldn\u2019t say even once,\u201d she said. \u201cOne was that they told you terrible things that were wrong with them, but then didn\u2019t do anything about it. In the Midwest if you say it, you have to do something about it. One was they didn\u2019t eat standing up out of the refrigerator. One was they ate red meat. I had seen pot roast, but not red meat. \u201d She has outlived or outlasted or   many of her critics, including the newscaster Harry Reasoner, who famously said of Ms. magazine, \u201cI\u2019ll give it six months before they run out of things to say,\u201d or feminist contemporaries who accused her of hijacking the movement away from its more radical founders. \u201cI don\u2019t know how she does it,\u201d said Susan Brownmiller, author of the landmark feminist work \u201cAgainst Our Will,\u201d who has traded barbs with Ms. Steinem for four decades. \u201cAnd she is still so totally beautiful. When women went to see her, they were just relieved, because she was so calm, and she could be funny. She made a lot of women feel, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s what the women\u2019s movement looks like. I can be part of that. \u2019\u201d Still, Ms. Brownmiller said, there were matters of feminist history to set straight. \u201cGuys in the media chose Gloria as our leader,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of us, our hope is that eventually history will straighten this all out and say, no, Gloria came in a little later, and her very loyal supporters have backtracked that history. \u201d In \u201cMy Life on the Road,\u201d newly out in paperback, Ms. Steinem describes a rootlessness at odds with her steadfast devotion to New York. In one   span, she never went a week without being on an airplane. In her childhood, her father used to shuttle the family around the country in a trailer, buying and selling antiques along the way to support them. The closest they had to a home base was Clarklake, Mich. where her father ran a summer dance pavilion, until the fall weather chased them south toward Florida or California. \u201cLiving in trailer parks is sobering, let\u2019s put it that way,\u201d Ms. Steinem said. She came to ground only after her parents split up when she was 10, and she became caretaker for her mentally ill mother in East Toledo, Ohio. She did not attend school regularly until about seventh grade. Her travels took her to Smith and then a   fellowship in India. When she arrived in New York for good in 1960, it was to be a journalist, as her mother once was. For women, New York in the early 1960s was \u201cvery much the way it\u2019s depicted in \u2018Mad Men,\u2019\u201d said Valerie Paley, director of the Center for Women\u2019s History at the   Historical Society. \u201cEven educated women were relegated to roles as wives and mothers. But there was also a groundswell for change, radical change. \u201d Ms. Steinem rode that groundswell, writing about the culture of the   birth control pill for Esquire, and going undercover as a Bunny at the   Playboy club for Show magazine. \u201cTo this day when people don\u2019t like me they introduce me as a former Bunny, as a \u201d she said. \u201cOn the other hand, I did improve the working conditions for those women. \u201d She also became a notable   . Time magazine, in 1969, called her \u201cone of the best dates to take to a New York party these days  \u2014   or, failing such luck, one of the most arresting names to drop,\u201d adding that she had \u201clegs worthy of her miniskirts, and a brain that keeps conversation lively without getting tricky. \u201d Ms. Steinem recalled those years in a less glamorous light. \u201cIf we spent $10 on a night out, we\u2019d say, \u2018Where are we going to get $10? \u2019\u201d she said. At parties, if things got too   she would say she was feeling the effects of her malaria and excuse herself. There were years of   plays, then staying up with the actors because they were all full of adrenaline, and having breakfast at the Automat. \u201cI remember that we once stole groceries from a store in the Village, because we were all broke,\u201d she said. \u201cLater on I went back to pay the old guy who was running the grocery, and that was my mistake, because it meant that he was admitting that someone could steal from him. I didn\u2019t understand that. Dignity is sometimes more important than money. \u201d As a young freelance writer, she said, \u201cwe didn\u2019t even have a word then for sexual harassment. It was just called life. It was just your job to avoid attention without alienating the editor. So there was an editor who always gave me a choice as I was leaving. I could either do something like mail his letters or I could go to a hotel room with him in the afternoon. Needless to say I mailed his letters. \u201d Her introduction to the women\u2019s liberation movement came secondhand, through a public television special and a 1969 speakout on abortion organized by Redstockings, a radical feminist group. The movement itself was split into factions like New York Radical Women, New York Radical Feminists and the Feminists, along with Betty Friedan\u2019s more mainstream National Organization for Women. Ms. Steinem brought a journalist\u2019s ability to navigate different worlds. \u201cSteinem was brilliant and younger than Friedan, and used her charisma in a different approach, where she was able to work with men,\u201d Ms. Paley said. When Ms. Steinem gathered some of the movement\u2019s best writers for Ms. magazine, she was accused by Ms. Friedan of \u201cripping off the movement for private profit\u201d and by radical feminists of creating a shadow movement to undermine their own. \u201cI really feel that she\u2019s not a lion of feminism, but a lamb of feminism,\u201d said Kathie Sarachild, a member of Redstockings who is often associated with coining the phrase \u201cSisterhood is powerful. \u201d In the   as Ms. took off, Redstockings criticized Ms. Steinem for having once worked for a C. I. A.  organization that recruited Americans to attend   youth festivals in Vienna and Helsinki in 1959 and 1962. The group\u2019s backing was first exposed in 1967 in Ramparts magazine, then in The Washington Post and The New York Times. Ms. Steinem paints the chapter as an innocent one, saying that no one in the C. I. A. ever asked her to do or say anything, and that she did not report back to the agency. \u201cIt\u2019s so interesting now, because the initials C. I. A. will make people believe anything,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t like that. It just was so uncontrolled. As I remember saying at the time, if this was our grandmother\u2019s money we\u2019d be doing the same thing. \u201d The criticism by other feminists was especially wounding. \u201cThey never called to ask me what I did,\u201d she said. \u201cThat hurt more than anything. \u201d She added, \u201cIf anybody still cares about what happened so long ago, I\u2019m happy to answer any questions. \u201d These are lively times to be Gloria Steinem, with the possibility of the first woman elected president and the word \u201cfeminist\u201d  \u2014   seen in   letters on the Beyonc\u00e9 concert stage  \u2014   again finding currency among young women. Her recent friends include some, like Lena Dunham and the playwright and performer Sarah Jones, who were not yet born when she started Ms. In speeches, Ms. Steinem quotes the three women who started the Black Lives Matter movement. \u201cThey are so far ahead of where we were, it\u2019s staggering,\u201d she said of the younger women she meets. \u201cThe only way I\u2019ve managed to express this is, I just had to wait for some of my friends to be born. \u201d Her age has made her more strategic and also freer, she said: \u201cFifty was hardest for me, because it\u2019s the end of the center of life, especially a gendered center of life. But by the time I got to be 60, it was like a new world. Society has given up because it\u2019s all about having or raising children, really, and by 60 society doesn\u2019t care that much, so you\u2019re free. Seventy was certainly about mortality. And 80 even more so. \u201d She cited a Native American observation that old age is like childhood, a time of wonder, because both are near to the unknown. She is especially excited about a plan to turn the former Bayview Correctional Facility in Chelsea into a hub for organizations serving women and girls, a dream since the 1970s of the Ms. Foundation and other groups. \u201cThere is nothing I\u2019m prouder of in this city,\u201d Ms. Steinem said. The building is being redesigned by female architects, for a female real estate developer, and is expected to open around 2020, said Pamela Shifman, executive director of the NoVo Foundation, a partner in the project. \u201cGloria has been an advocate and visionary of this for decades,\u201d Ms. Shifman said. \u201cOne thing about Gloria, quintessential Gloria, is that she sees herself in community with diverse groups of women, including formerly incarcerated women. Her purpose is to ask questions and listen. \u201d On a beautiful fall morning, Ms. Steinem seemed to lose interest in sitting still and answering questions. \u201cWant to see my bench?\u201d she said. For her 80th birthday, friends had presented her with a log bench in Central Park, near the Metropolitan Museum of Art. On the short walk over, a young woman stopped Ms. Steinem to thank her for being an inspiration. A man in a taxi yelled, \u201cLove you, Gloria,\u201d and flashed a \u201cV\u201d sign. Ms. Steinem gave him a thumbs up and strode purposefully across Park Avenue. As Ms. Steinem climbed the hill toward her bench, the man sitting there appeared to know who she was. \u201cGo away, crackers,\u201d he said. Ms. Steinem continued to smile, assuring him she did not want him to move. He cursed at her and said, \u201cThat Steinem died a long time ago. \u201d Down the hill, she seemed visibly shaken, but unwilling to criticize the man, who was black. \u201cWhen you\u2019re treated as a group, you treat others as a group,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I\u2019m \u2018cracker. \u2019\u201d She had things to do. There was a Yazidi woman, Nadia Murad Basee Taha, who was trafficked by the Islamic State, to interview for Viceland, and a promo for a Ms. Foundation   to tape. She had to prepare for a talk at the United Jewish Appeal and a local news segment about the Women\u2019s Media Center. She continued on her way. A few days later, she emailed to say that the encounter with the man on the bench was \u201cpart of the reason I\u2019m not about to leave New York. At least we see each other and have a chance to talk and absorb what someone else is experiencing. We\u2019re not isolated in a tin can of a car or behind highways and gates. \u201d There was also the novelty of being called a cracker a first, she wrote. In a lifetime of activism, that may be her signature. Any encounter, even hostile, could be an opportunity. It was a philosophy to live by, and perhaps, eventually, to die by. Why dwell on conflict or loss? \u201cMy funeral,\u201d she said, \u201cwill be a  . \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562322.829969}
