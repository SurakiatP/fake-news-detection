[The Chinook Middle School language arts teacher, after pulling the student aside, compared the shirt\u2019s message to wearing a swastika, the   Herald reported.  \u201cShe asked, \u2018How would you feel if someone wore a   with a swastika on it?\u2019 \u201d the student\u2019s mother, Michelle Fischer, told the   Herald. \u201cHe said, \u2018You can\u2019t compare my shirt to wearing a swastika. They aren\u2019t the same thing.\u2019 \u201d Fischer said the teacher asked her son Jack to stay in her class during lunch to talk about the shirt and told him that it wasn\u2019t appropriate to wear clothing with a political message. Jack responded to the teacher that he saw a math teacher wearing a shirt with Barack Obama on it. Fischer posted her outrage over the teacher\u2019s handling of the situation on Facebook and it went viral, especially after conservative talk show host Sean Hannity shared it to his 2. 8 million followers. Fischer is hoping that her son\u2019s experience makes it easier for other children to speak up about political bullying. \u201cIt does happen,\u201d said Michelle Fischer. \u201cI think (politics) should be taught in our schools, but only in a   positive way. \u201d Jack told her that the teacher had appeared opposed to Donald Trump since the beginning of the school year because of how she handled class discussions of the presidential election and the candidates. Fischer spoke with Chinook\u2019s principal, Kevin Pierce, who said there was nothing wrong with the shirt. School district officials said appropriate action was taken against the teacher, but could not release details on personnel matters. The district said students are allowed to express their opinions so long as it doesn\u2019t disrupt the education of others. \u201cI think most parents would agree with me,\u201d Fischer said. \u201cIf this was the other way around, I guarantee there would be some parents that were pretty upset. \u201d Students at other high schools around the country have also been harassed by school officials for wearing clothing in support of Trump. A student at a high school in South Portland, Oregon was harassed by school officials because he wore a hat with Trump\u2019s campaign slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d in April 2016.'"}, "time": 1742563176.726777}
