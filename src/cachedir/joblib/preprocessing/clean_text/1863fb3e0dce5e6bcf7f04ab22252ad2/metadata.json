Zeder, a senior research scientist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. \\nBut in recent years, Dr. Zeder and other archaeologists have overturned that consensus. Their research suggests that people were inventing farming at several sites in the Fertile Crescent at roughly the same time. In the Zagros Mountains of Iran, for example, Dr. Zeder and her colleagues have found evidence of the gradual domestication of wild goats over many centuries around 10,000 years ago. \\nPeople may have been cultivating plants earlier than believed, too. \\nIn the 1980s, Dani Nadel, then at Hebrew University, and his colleagues excavated a 23,000-year-old site on the shores of the Sea of Galilee known as Ohalo II. It consisted of half a dozen brush huts. Last year, Dr. Nadel co-authored a study showing that one of the huts contained 150,000 charred seeds and fruits, including many types, such as almonds, grapes and olives, that would later become crops. . A stone blade found at Ohalo II seemed to have been used as a sickle to harvest cereals. A stone slab was used to grind the seeds. It seems clear the inhabitants were cultivating wild plants long before farming was thought to have begun. \\n\u201cWe got fixated on the very few things we just happened to see preserved in the archaeological record, and we got this false impression that this was an abrupt change,\u201d Dr. Zeder said. \u201cNow we really understand there was this long period where they\u2019re playing around with resources.\u201d \\nre '"}, "time": 1742562938.7660122}
