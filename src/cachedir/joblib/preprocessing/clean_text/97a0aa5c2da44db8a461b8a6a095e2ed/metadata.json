And Trump has called for them to intimidate voters at polling places. \\nIn Texas last week, a Trump supporter was arrested for electioneering at a polling place because he was wearing one of Trump\u2019s stupid hats and a \u201cDeplorables\u201d T-shirt to vote. \\nElection code prohibits any person from electioneering within 100 feet of a polling place. \\nOf course, Trump supporters threw a temper tantrum because they think the rules don\u2019t apply to them. \\nWell, now it looks like they have retaliated by setting up a booby trapped Trump sign at a polling place knowing that an official or volunteer would have to take the sign down. \\nAt Collin College in Plano, Texas a Trump sign was discovered zip-tied to an official polling location sign in direct violation of the election code that forbids electioneering at polling places. \\nBut when a volunteer went out to remove the sign they got a nasty surprise in the form of box cutter blades that were strategically hidden inside. The blades sliced into the volunteer\u2019s hands and drew blood, requiring medical attention and prompting officials to order that signs be checked thoroughly before removal. \\n\u201cIt just shows how far we have come in politics where people want to be so mean and so hateful to try and injure somebody who\u2019s probably not got any political party persuasion one way or the other,\u201d local Democratic Party campaign chair Steve Spainhouer said in response . \u201cI think most people have already made their minds up at this point how they\u2019re going to vote and so there\u2019s nothing to gain by being mean spirited or hateful.\u201d \\nHere\u2019s the video via KTVT . \\nFrankly, this should be considered an act of domestic terrorism. Trump\u2019s supporters have gone too far and it could get worse as Election Day approaches. And if Trump loses, his supporters have already threatened to try to overthrow the federal government in a bloody coup. \\nClearly, these people are deranged and the safety of voters and election officials are in danger. But you won\u2019t hear Donald Trump condemning this act of violence. After all, he is the one inciting it. \\nFeatured Image: Darren McCollester/Getty Images Share this Article!
