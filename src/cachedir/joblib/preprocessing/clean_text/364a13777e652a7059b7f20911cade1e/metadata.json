Retail worker Tom Logan has caused concern by having a cheap-looking plastic front door instead of a sleek, sturdy modern one. Neighbour Donna Sheridan said: \u201cMost people in the street have got a proper light brown oak panelling door, ideally with a vertical silver handle, but Logan thinks he\u2019s different with his shitty white plastic door that looks like it came out of a skip. \u201cI don\u2019t know what he gets up to in there, probably druggie sex parties where they all wear masks to make it extra-perverted. At least the door will be easy to bash in when the police arrive. \u201cI just wish a nice family with a normal door would move in, although it\u2019ll be hard to sell the property if there are male prostitutes under all the floorboards.\u201d Logan said: \u201cMost evenings I just watch telly or use my vast occult library to open portals to evil dimensions.\u201d \\nShare:'"}, "time": 1742563939.7108283}
