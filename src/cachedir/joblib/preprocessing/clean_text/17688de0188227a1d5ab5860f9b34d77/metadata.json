Cory Booker ( ) reacted to President Donald Trump\u2019s firing of FBI Director James Comey by criticizing Trump for having a \u201cwholly unsatisfactory\u201d response to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.  Booker said what should be a \u201cPaul Revere moment\u201d in which we should be talking about \u201cthe Russians are coming,\u201d it has not been. \u201cI think it\u2019s very problematic when you have a president and an attorney general involving themselves at a time in the firing of an individual that was investigating, asking for more resources to investigate, not only to Russia\u2019s attacks, cyberattacks but also people that were part of the campaign  \u2014   as Jeff Sessions was and, obviously, as candidate Trump was,\u201d Booker said. \u201cAnd so, this really have to get back to the focus of what\u2019s going on right now, which is really a moment in American history where we\u2019ve had an unprecedented attack on our elections and how are we as a nation going to respond,\u201d he continued. \u201cDonald Trump clearly has not taken this seriously, and what should be a Paul Revere moment for our country, where people are talking about the Russians are coming, they\u2019re not intending not only to attack this last election but intending to continue this behavior, what will our response be?  And right now, it\u2019s been wholly unsatisfactory from this administration. (  RCP Video) Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor'"}, "time": 1742561726.2559643}
