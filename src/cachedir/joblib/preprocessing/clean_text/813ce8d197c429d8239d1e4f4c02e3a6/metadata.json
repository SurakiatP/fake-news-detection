On Wednesday, lawyers from the International Refugee Assistance Project at the Urban Justice Center who were concerned that the action would affect the project\u2019s clients sent out an email calling for lawyers who could volunteer immediately to go to airports where refugees were scheduled to enter the United States. \u201cIt occurred to us that there were going to be people who were traveling who would land and have their status affected while in midair,\u201d said Betsy Fisher, the group\u2019s policy director. And that is exactly what happened. Across the country, people were detained on Sunday after being caught up in the aftermath of Mr. Trump\u2019s order, even though a petition filed on Saturday in federal court in Brooklyn led a judge to block part of the order. Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, the plaintiffs named in the petition, were originally clients of Ms. Fisher\u2019s organization. The email received a tremendous response, Ms. Fisher said, with \u201cwell over a thousand people\u201d expressing interest and availability. By Saturday morning, the lawyers who heeded the call were at about a dozen airports around the country. Others who heard about the effort through colleagues or the news media went to airports on their own to pitch in. By early Sunday morning, Ms. Fisher said, lawyers offering services and advice were at \u201cmost international airports in the United States. \u201d Andre Segura, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, arrived at Kennedy International Airport in New York at 1:30 p. m. on Saturday. He said that the outside section of Central Diner, a restaurant in Terminal 4, was \u201centirely taken over by attorneys,\u201d all working to file petitions for individual clients with the help of the clients\u2019 families. \u201cThere were attorneys from numerous major law firms, nonprofits, all working together,\u201d Mr. Segura said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen that immediate coming together of teams to start filing actions to try to protect people. \u201d He added, \u201cThe dynamic between what was happening inside the terminal with all the attorneys, and outside with massive protests and people holding signs  \u2014   I\u2019ve never experienced anything like that. \u201d Mr. Segura said he arrived home around 2 a. m. on Sunday. He woke up at 5:30 and began answering emails from lawyers who had stayed overnight at the airport. While lawyers gathered at airports on Saturday, others were working furiously on litigation. Cecillia Wang, the A. C. L. U.\u2019s deputy legal director, described the scene at her office as \u201ccomplete chaos. \u201d \u201cI was sitting at my desk working on a template habeas petition that could be used by lawyers at airports all around the country,\u201d she said. Omar Jadwat, the director of the A. C. L. U.\u2019s Immigrant Rights Project, which worked on the petition that led to the judge\u2019s stay, said the litigation had not been prepared ahead of time. \u201cThat was not something we had on the shelf ready to go, waiting for the right plaintiffs to come along,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a case of: There\u2019s this emergency, and people have to work together to figure out a response as quickly as we can so that these people and other people around the country didn\u2019t get deported. \u201d Even after word of the federal court\u2019s order reached the airport in New York, confusion reigned. Alina Das, a professor of clinical law at New York University School of Law, said she had arrived at the airport at 7 p. m. on Saturday and stayed overnight, working to get a client released. Ms. Das, who said she could not comment on her client\u2019s situation, described the scene on Sunday morning, saying that it was \u201cincredibly difficult to get an answer on whether our clients were going to be sent back or whether they were being processed for release\u201d and that people remained detained even after the court order blocked part of the president\u2019s actions. Avi Gesser, a partner at the law firm Davis Polk  Wardwell, described the process in Terminal 4 on Saturday, saying that a group of people had been deployed to search for those whose family members were detained. \u201cIf they found people, they referred them over to us and we onboarded people as clients if we could, and then filed habeas petitions,\u201d he said. Mr. Gesser, who is originally from Canada, did not leave the airport until 4:30 a. m. on Sunday, he said. \u201cOur firm has a lot of people who were not born in the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cWe felt that people who were being detained needed legal representation. And that\u2019s something that we do very well. \u201d Rebecca Heller, who was coordinating lawyers\u2019 efforts on the ground for the International Refugee Assistance Project on Saturday, said that by Sunday afternoon, her services were far less in demand. \u201cThey\u2019re   now!\u201d she said excitedly in a brief phone call. \u201cThat\u2019s how a movement starts. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562332.7095704}
