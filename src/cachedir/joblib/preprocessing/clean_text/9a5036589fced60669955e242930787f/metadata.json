His own recorded words confirm as much, as do the dozen or so women who have come forward to accuse him of sexual misconduct. His campaign is desperately fighting to put a lid on the growing awareness that Trump will be testifying under oath during a trial in federal court under the accusation of raping a thirteen-year-old girl and a previously undisclosed second girl, who was even younger . \\nThe case was thrown out in May due to a clerical error, but re-filed in June with two new witnesses \u2013\u201cJoan Doe\u201d and \u201cTiffany Doe\u201d who both say they worked as \u201cparty planners\u201d for convicted child rapist and billionaire Jeffery Epstein. Part of that \u201cplanning\u201d appears to have been procuring girls for the party, as \u201cJoan Doe\u201d revealed in her deposition that she convinced victim \u201cJane Doe\u201d to attend four different parties with promises of money and \u201cmeeting contacts\u201d in the modelling industry \u2013 a story that matches the account of another person who would arrange for underage women to attend Trump\u2019s parties. \\nAt one of these parties, \u201cJane Doe\u201d was forced to perform oral sex on Trump with a twelve-year old named \u201cMaria.\u201d At the fourth and final encounter, Tiffany Doe says \u201c I personally witnessed Defendant Trump telling the Plaintiff that she shouldn\u2019t ever say anything if she didn\u2019t want to disappear like the 12-year-old female Maria, and that he was capable of having her whole family killed.\u201d \\n\u201cMaria\u201d hadn\u2019t been seen since the previous encounter. Trump then forcibly raped \u201cJane Doe,\u201d who was then raped and sodomized again by Jeffery Epstein, who was apparently furious tha t Trump had ta ken her virginity and not him, beating her in his fury . \\nDonald Trump told New York magazine in 2002 that \u201cI\u2019ve known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy. He\u2019s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it \u2014 Jeffrey enjoys his social life.\u201d \\nEpstein\u2019s brother, Mark, also testified that \u201cTrump flew on Jeffrey\u2019s private jet at least once and records indicate that Trump called Epstein twice in November of 2004.\u201d \\nEpstein eventually recieved a slap on the wrist \u2013 13 months in prison and registration as a sex offender \u2013 for decades of abuse : \\n\u201caccording to law-enforcement officials and alleged victims, between the years 1998 and 2007\u2014and possibly even earlier\u2014he ran a particularly vile pyramid scheme that involved paying minors around $200 at a time to perform sexual massages nearly every day and then recruit even younger girls to do the same. (\u201cThe more you do, the more you are paid,\u201d one said.) During these massages, girls as young as 13 told police they were instructed to get undressed. Epstein would masturbate or penetrate them, they said\u2014with his finger, or a vibrator, or his allegedly egg-shaped penis.\u201d \\nThe details keep coming, and the picture they paint grows darker and more horrifying by they day. How much more evidence does America need? How many more stories need to be told before the word of one rich man is outweighed by literally dozens of contrasting accounts? Donald Trump is a sexual predator and a possible pedophile; he deserves a jail cell on Riker\u2019s Island, not the White House.'"}, "time": 1742563577.4835563}
