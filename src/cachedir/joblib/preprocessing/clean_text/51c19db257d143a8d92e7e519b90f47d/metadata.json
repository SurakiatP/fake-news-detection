Obama said,\u201dThe strategy of repeal first and replace later is just a huge disservice to the American people. \u201d He continued, \u201cAnd if they are so convinced that can do it better, they shouldn\u2019t be afraid to make that presentation. It is really interesting to try to figure out why is it that they are trying to rush the repeal so quick. What is it that they are afraid of? Why wouldn\u2019t they want to say, here\u2019s our plan? And show side by side here is why our plan is better than what Obamacare has produced. Because they have said absolutely adamantly that they can do it better. I\u2019m saying to every Republican right now, if you in fact can put a plan together that is demonstrably better than what Obamacare is doing, I will publicly support repealing Obamacare and replacing it with your plan. But I want to see it first. I want to see it first. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742562337.652277}
