He said, \u201cThe current division in the country only makes politicians stronger. When people are divided, the politicians can do whatever. When people are united, that\u2019s a dangerous thing. \u201d  According to LifeZette, Fabio recalled arriving in America for the first time, saying, \u201cIt was like a beautiful dream. It was like paradise. I fell in love with this country. \u201d But he has watched sweeping change occur under Democrats like Governor Jerry Brown, and he indicates that the change favors criminals while leaving police \u201cdemoralized. \u201d He said, \u201cIt\u2019s a disaster. It\u2019s an epidemic. I\u2019ve been around the world. I\u2019ve been to Africa. Everywhere. Downtown Los Angeles now looks like a   country. \u201d Fabio said LA is is full of \u201c  streets and sidewalks\u201d and also has \u201c  \u201d crime and homeless problems. And he warned that things are going to get worse because of Proposition 57. Fabio said that proposition was ubiquitously promoted to save money by releasing \u201cnonviolent\u201d criminals from prison, but he says Prop. 57 has actually resulted in a reduction in sentences for \u201chuman trafficking involving sex with minors, assault with a deadly weapon, attempting to explode a bomb in a school or hospital, discharging a firearm on school guards, failing to register as a sex offender   \u2026     the list goes on and on and on. \u201d Fabio said, \u201cJust look at Europe and go the opposite way. It\u2019s as simple as that. Europe already jumped off the cliff. They are doomed. \u201d He added: Don\u2019t you ever give up your guns. If people lose that right, forget about it. Politicians  \u2014   they will take everything away from you. And then what are you going to do, protest with a rock? Because that\u2019s what they do in Europe.
