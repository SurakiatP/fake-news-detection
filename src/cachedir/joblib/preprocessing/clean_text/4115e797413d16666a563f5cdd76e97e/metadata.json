[ABC News cites law enforcement authorities confirming that Santiago bought a ticket to New York City for New Year\u2019s Eve. They do not have a clear reason why he decided to change his   trip, though they suspect that \u201cthe highly visible presence of NYPD officers throughout the city on New Year\u2019s Eve could have been an effective deterrent. \u201d There is no evidence that Santiago went beyond buying the plane ticket, such as arranging for lodging. He did not appear to book lodging in Florida, either, though he has family in the area.  Older brother Bryan Santiago told the Orlando   that Esteban Santiago has a   in Naples, Florida, due west of Fort Lauderdale, and that the two had spoken shortly before the attack. \u201cHe called my older brother, and my brother told him \u2018Come to Naples anytime you want. There is always a place for you to stay with me,\u2019\u201d Bryan Santiago said. The FBI has yet to confirm a motive for Santiago\u2019s attack. On Saturday, the FBI special agent in charge of the investigation, George Piro, told reporters that they had not found any evidence that Santiago had been consuming jihadist content on social media. \u201cWe\u2019re looking over all of his social media, things like that. It\u2019s giving us a picture of the individual, but it\u2019s way too early for us to rule out anything,\u201d Piro said. Santiago had mentioned the Islamic State to authorities before the attack, however. In November, Santiago visited the FBI offices in Anchorage, Alaska, where he had been living, to declare that the U. S. government was forcing him to watch Islamic State videos and fight for the Islamic State. The FBI confiscated his registered firearm and, after a psychological evaluation, eventually returned it. Police have not confirmed whether this weapon was the one used in the attack. Aside from the Islamic State references to the FBI, few leads appear to indicate that Santiago was a radicalized terrorist. Alaska\u2019s only mosque, the Islamic Community Center of Alaska, told the Miami Herald it has \u201cno connection with this guy whatsoever,\u201d and no witnesses have claimed Santiago ever attended the mosque or spoke of Islam to them. Bryan Santiago told the   Santiago has \u201cnever been a Muslim. He\u2019s always been a Christian,\u201d and that the keffiyeh scarf he is seen wearing in a photo circulating online was a \u201csouvenir he bought in Iraq when he was serving in the military. \u201d Bryan Santiago did confirm that his brother had confided in him about his concerns regarding the CIA. \u201cHe started talking to me, you know, that he\u2019s seeing   \u2026     weird things, that he\u2019s hearing voices, that the government is using him   \u2026     that the CIA is sending him secret codes to his laptop, and that he don\u2019t want to do that. \u201d Bryan Santiago said he told his brother to \u201cgo to the church or to psychologist or something. \u201d Santiago served nearly a decade in the U. S. armed forces, first in the Puerto Rico National Guard and then the Alaska National Guard. He was deployed to Iraq in 2010, reportedly diffusing improvised explosive devices, and two of his company were killed in that deployment. Multiple relatives have told various news outlets that his deployment to Iraq appeared to change him.   Michelle Qui\u00f1ones told ABC News that Santiago sought help from the Department of Veterans Affairs following his return from Iraq in 2011. \u201cWe had let veterans know that he was having some mental problems, that he wasn\u2019t feeling alright and they did nothing,\u201d she asserted. Santiago is facing the death penalty for the mass murder he allegedly committed on Friday, and is currently being held on suicide watch. With no more than $10 in his bank accounts, Santiago cannot afford a lawyer, and the government has provided public legal counsel. His family hopes to save him from capital punishment given years of apparent mental illness. \u201cWe are struggling to prove that he had mental problems, that he communicated them and asked authorities for help, and due to that these criminal charges are not viable,\u201d Brian Santiago told the   Primera Hora. The mayor of the Santiago family hometown of Pe\u00f1uelas, Puerto Rico, Walter Torres Maldonado, has offered financial aid to the family should they seek to travel to Florida, as well as psychological counseling should they need it.'"}, "time": 1742563557.3917556}
