The affair lasted some 12 years, according to Flowers, who refers to her former boss as \u201cthe love of her life.\u201d \\nWhen she first went public with allegations of the affair, she provided the press with a series of tape-recorded phone calls as evidence. But there was something else in that alleged audio, something that was all but overlooked until Flowers gave a new interview this past week to Breitbart\\'s Aaron Klein. \\nIn the midst of several conversations regarding a lawsuit alleging that Clinton had engaged in numerous affairs, Flowers also recorded a brief exchange referencing her job. \\nThe job wasn\\'t anything special on the surface \u2014 a clerical position working for the state of Arkansas, making around $17,000 per year. Flowers secured the job just over a year prior to Clinton\\'s run for the presidency. \\nBut prior to getting the job, Flowers sent a letter in which she told Clinton about her financial troubles. The National Memo reported on the contents of that letter: \\n\"Gennifer wrote Clinton again on February 25. \\'Since we were unable to connect by phone,\\' the letter began, \\'I thought I should drop you a note.\\' Flowers complained that Gaddy hadn\u2019t been very successful in helping her and that her financial situation was dire. She enclosed a copy of her lawyer\u2019s letter threatening to sue the radio station, and closed by asking Clinton to \\'Please, be in touch.\\' \\nThree months later, Gaddy sent Flowers to the Arkansas Merit System to be tested for an administrative assistant position that paid $17,524.\" \\nAs Clinton prepared his campaign for the presidency, he and Flowers spoke again on the phone \u2014 after a woman in her office had complained that she was more qualified for the job \u2014 and Flowers again allegedly recorded their conversations : \\nGF \u2013 But anyway, then Wednesday, there was a grievance filed in my office when I got the job by a girl who felt like she should have gotten it, a black girl named (deleted). And they called me as a witness. So I go in and uh, nothing big came of it. It\u2019s just that they were questioning me about how I found out about the job. And I said, \u201cWell, that personnel said it that it was a possibility there would be a position,\u201d and then uh, \u201cthey told me that it would be advertised in the newspaper. And it was and I pursued it from there.\" \\nBC \u2013 Good for you. \\nGF \u2013 Well the only thing that concerns me, where I\u2019m, where I\u2019m concerned at this point is the state job. \\nBC \u2013 Yeah. I never thought about that, but as long as you say you\u2019ve just been looking for one, you\u2019d uh, check on it. If they ever asked if you\u2019d talked to me about it, you can say no. \\nGF \u2013 Well and I would. But I\u2019m\u2026 here is the thing I\u2019ve got to consider, too, is I\u2019ve gotta go in there to work every day. You know what I mean? \\nBC \u2013 Yep. \\nGF \u2013 And if, and if these people start talking or someone in the press\u2026 \\nBC \u2013 Well, have they been nice to you there? \\nGF \u2013 Yeah they have been. But I don\u2019t, you know, I mean, I just want you to know what\u2019s going on. And I\u2019ll be glad to hang in there. \\nBC \u2013 Has the, has the\u2026 \\nGF \u2013 But if it gets real\u2026 \\nClinton did eventually admit to having sexual relations with Flowers, though he insisted there had only been a single encounter. \\nFlowers, who has never been a fan of Hillary Clinton\\'s, has come out in recent months in support of Donald Trump. She was one of the women Trump invited to sit in the front row during the debates in an effort to make the Clintons uncomfortable. \\nYou can listen to Klein\\'s interview with Flowers below: '"}, "time": 1742562654.8446}
