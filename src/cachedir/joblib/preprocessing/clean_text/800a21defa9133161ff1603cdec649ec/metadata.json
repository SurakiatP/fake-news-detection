Of the 650,000 emails, thousands are labeled \u201cclassified\u201d National Security material forwarded from another email server. According to sources, the emails were discovered in a folder labeled, \u201cLife Insurance\u201d. Is it possible the folder was mislabeled by Abedin to deliberately conceal its contents? This also begs the question: How did Huma Abedin get National Security clearance? \\nThe NY Post explains where FBI originally dropped the ball when they first investigated Abedin: Skeptical agents showed Abedin three separate email exchanges she had with an IT staffer regarding the operation of the private Clinton server during Clinton\u2019s tenure at State. Abedin claimed she \u201cdid not recall\u201d the email exchanges. So if you believe Abedin, she didn\u2019t know the private clintonemail.com server that hosted her [email protected] account even existed until she heard about it in the news. Comey was a believer; he didn\u2019t even bother to call her back for further questioning. Case closed. But Abedin\u2019s role in this caper begs for fresh scrutiny. Making false statements to a federal agent is a felony. So is mishandling classified information. By forwarding classified emails to her personal email account and printing them out at home, Abedin appears to have violated a Classified Information NonDisclosure Agreement she signed at the State Department on Jan. 30, 2009, in which she agreed to keep all classified material under the control of the US government. An infographic puts it in a simpler form, stating how government emails were forwarded to her Yahoo account \u2014 for what? No one knows. There was allegedly a counter-espionage case going on around the time. With 500,000,000 email accounts hacked earlier last year, Abedin has put our National Security in danger.
