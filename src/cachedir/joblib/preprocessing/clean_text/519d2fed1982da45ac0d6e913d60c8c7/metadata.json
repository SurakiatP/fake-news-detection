When the Republican candidate caught it mid-interview on live television, he had a priceless response that the CNN crank won\u2019t soon forget. \\nLiberal news host Dana Bash is evidently no fan of Donald Trump, which she\u2019s not afraid to show in her biased reporting. Her arrogance backfired when she was in front of him at the grand opening of his hotel, thinking she could get away with a public attempt to insult him, but she got rightfully put in her place by the blunt candidate. \\nTrump\u2019s schedule is jam packed with as many campaign stops as he can cram into these final weeks of the election, taking advantage of every waking moment to earn Americans\u2019 votes. Somehow in the middle of his traveling to every corner of the country, he managed to squeeze in a stop at his hotel\u2019s grand opening where he created countless jobs and a structure he should be proud of. However, Bash didn\u2019t see it this way in her attempt to slam him for this 90-minute \u201ctime off\u201d he was taking from campaigning. \\nDuring her live interview at the opening, the nasty CNN reporter had the audacity to sneak in this question: \u201cFor people who say you\u00e2\\x80\\x99re taking time out of swing states to go do this, you say?\u201d She painted this pit stop as an irresponsible thing to do while Hillary Clinton is working hard. Trump shuts down Dana Bash after questioning him for \"taking time off\" to attend his hotel\\'s grand opening. \u0111\\x9f\\x98\\x81 pic.twitter.com/LtLAu1jkbQ \\n\u2014 Deplorable AJ (@asamjulian) October 26, 2016 \\nTrump wasn\u2019t going to allow her to get away with asking such a disgusting thing, given the vast difference in effort between him and his opponent and didn\u2019t mince a single word in his priceless answer. \\n\u201cI say the following. You have been covering me for the last, long time. I did yesterday 8 stops and 3 major speeches. And I\u00e2\\x80\\x99ve been doing this for weeks straight. I left for here for an hour-and-a-half. I\u00e2\\x80\\x99m leaving here and going to North Carolina, then I\u00e2\\x80\\x99m going to Florida, then I\u00e2\\x80\\x99m going up to New Hampshire. For you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because Hillary Clinton does one stop and then goes home and sleeps. And yet you ask me that question. I think it\u00e2\\x80\\x99s a very rude question .\u201d \\nBash didn\u2019t see that coming, and Trump proved once again why America needs an unapologetic leader like him. He tells it how it is and backs up what he says with real action, unlike his competition who puts in a couple of days of campaigning and calls it good since it\u2019s all for show anyway. \\nTrump is putting in ten times the effort with genuine work ethic on his own dime to honestly earn the votes, and if he wants to take a couple of minutes to make an appearance at an opening, he\u2019s more than entitled to do it. It pales in comparison to the weeks Hillary has had off relaxing and recovering. Trump\u2019s creating jobs as he\u2019s campaigning, but Hillary\u2019s just napping.'"}, "time": 1742561634.216675}
