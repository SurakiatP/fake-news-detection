For some 20 seconds the two \"rescuers\" and the \"victim\" are motionless waiting for the command to start a hectic \"rescue operation\" and, when that starts, adds on the usual background sound of screaming people. \\nThe embed is a copy I made from the original and posted on my account to make sure that it is preserved. \\nI do not know why the RFS Media Office would upload this. To show that the White Helmets and their videos are fake? Did they not pay their dues? Or was the channel hacked and the upload done by someone else? \\nThe original title \"Edge of death | #MannequinChallenge\" points to some social media nonsense which The Telegraph describes as: A viral video craze, it involves people imitating mannequins and freezing for the camera while music plays in the background. \\nSo is this a fake? Or a fake of the fakes the original White Helmets videos are ( this one for example)? \\nAnyway - have fun with it while I keep nursing my not so fake influenza (no video).   21, 2016 at 01:40 PM | Permalink'"}, "time": 1742562165.760687}
