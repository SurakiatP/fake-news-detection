Sessions III (R. .) to the Senate Judiciary Committee Tuesday told Breitbart News he was thrilled to stand by his friend. The senator watched as   Donald J. Trump\u2019s attorney general nominee handled himself with poise and intelligence during the day\u2019s confirmation hearing. [\u201cIt was a great honor,\u201d said Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R. .) who was joined by Sen. Susan Collins (R. ) for the ceremonial introduction to a committee of which Sessions is actually a sitting member.  \u201cI believe Senator Sessions\u2019 nomination by   Trump was very wise,\u201d he said. \u201cSessions brings integrity and purpose to this job. He has been on the committee for 20 years, he\u2019s been the attorney general for the state of Alabama, he\u2019s been a U. S. Attorney \u2014  he\u2019s a conservative with a lot of purpose and that\u2019s important. \u201d Shelby said it was difficult to watch Senate Democrats breach the comity that governs personal relationships in the Senate by attacking Sessions as a racist, a liar and someone who would not enforce laws he disagrees with. \u201cI believe he\u2019s going to be confirmed, but some Democrats were grilling him too much \u2014  being not real nice to him,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, they are playing raw liberal politics,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand what they\u2019re doing. They\u2019ve got all these people they\u2019re bringing   are Democratic constituents to work the hard left against a good nominee. \u201d \u201cBut, they didn\u2019t lay a glove on him,\u201d Shelby said. \u201cThey know down deep \u2014  most of them \u2014  that he is qualified for the job and he will do a good job,\u201d the senator said. \u201cHe\u2019s got character above everything and they need that above everything at the Justice Department. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628496.4836073}
