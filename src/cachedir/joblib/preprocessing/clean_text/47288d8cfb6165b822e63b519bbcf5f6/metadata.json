Bush\u2019s daughter, Barbara Pierce Bush, will deliver the keynote address at a Planned Parenthood fundraiser in North Texas. [Bush, the CEO and   of Global Health Corps (GHC) is headlining Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas\u2019s 2017 Fort Worth luncheon, reports the Texas Tribune:  High schoolers! Earn community service hours, learn about sexual health, and inspire change Register now: https:  . ! pic. twitter.   \u2014   Planned Parenthood (@PPGreaterTX) February 4, 2017,  \u201cWe believe that every person has the right to live a healthy, dignified life,\u201d GHC says in its mission statement. \u201cWe also believe that everyone has a role to play in advancing social justice through the health equity movement. \u201d Bush, 34, joined with her twin sister, Jenna Bush Hager, and others to found GHC in 2009. The organization says its main concern is that \u201caccess to healthcare that exists today between the world\u2019s rich and the world\u2019s poor is unjust and unsustainable. \u201d Speaker sponsors for the fundraiser for the abortion chain\u2019s Greater Texas affiliate will pay $20, 000, while Platinum and Gold Sponsors will pay $10, 000 and $5, 000, respectively. As Breitbart News reported in June of 2016, the New York Times interviewed Bush and Planned Parenthood\u2019s president, Cecile Richards, as they lunched at the Gotham Bar and Grill. \u201cCan I say how impressive Barbara is?\u201d Richards complimented Bush. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to work at a    organization like Planned Parenthood, trying to shift the boat into the 21st century. But it\u2019s another to say: \u2018I see a problem, and I\u2019m going to start an organization to fix it. \u2019\u201d Bush explained her motivation to form her organization. \u201cSince I was born, in 1981, we\u2019ve had the drugs to save the millions of kids around the world who die every year,\u201d she said. \u201cYet the number of deaths hasn\u2019t dropped at all. We have the tools to keep people healthy, but the systems are broken. \u201d Richards commiserated with her: \u201cIt\u2019s the same in reproductive health. We have the technology. But it\u2019s not enough unless there\u2019s public policy that supports getting women access to care. \u201d Richards is the daughter of the late Gov. Ann Richards (D) of Texas, who eventually lost to Bush\u2019s father, Republican President George W. Bush, when he ran for governor of Texas in 1994. One of the main connections Richards and Bush have is Hillary Clinton. Planned Parenthood and the abortion industry endorsed Clinton in her bid for the White House in 2016. Clinton said unborn babies have no constitutional rights and that, if elected president, she would work to have the Hyde Amendment repealed so that taxpayer funds could be used for abortions  \u2014   an outcome that would have been an obvious boost for the abortion business. GHC provides opportunities for young people to \u201cwork on the frontlines of the fight for global health equity\u201d and offers paid fellowships for them with various \u201cplacement\u201d organizations, among them Planned Parenthood Global. Additionally, GHC has provided \u201cplacements\u201d at the Clinton Development Initiative, the Clinton Health Access Initiative, and the Clinton Health Matters Initiative  \u2014   all of which are part of the Clinton Foundation. Peter Schweizer\u2019s book Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich details the vast amounts of money that have flowed to both Bill and Hillary Clinton through their foundation from corporations and nations seeking favorable treatment from them. In August of 2013, Bush said she hoped Clinton would run for president because she is \u201cunbelievably accomplished. \u201d Bush told Richards during their lunch interview, \u201cIt\u2019s crazy and sad to think that health care is a polarizing issue. \u201d She went on to say that the young people in her organization are able to \u201cwork on social change\u201d at \u201cPlanned Parenthood and other exceptional organizations. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628424.715609}
