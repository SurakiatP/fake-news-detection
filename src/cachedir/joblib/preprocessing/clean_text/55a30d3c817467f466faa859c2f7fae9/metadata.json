Recommended \\nThe US have announced a strategic partnership with al-Qaeda in order to overthrow the Syrian government and oust President Assad. (2 hours ago) \\nSouthfront.org reports: \\nThe secret CIA program of training and arming \u2018moderate terrorists\u2019 has been the core of American strategy, aiming to overthrow Assad and set a puppet government in Syria, since the start of the war. Nonetheless, the Obama administration is likely set to postponed the resumption and expansion of this program and to pass the need to make a decision to next president. T \\nhe US leadership is not ready to make the decision now because the recent military developments have shown that despite all money spending, supplies and CIA efforts, Washington still cannot rely on the moderate terrorists as a clearly pro-US force on the ground. Every US attempt to separate secular militant groups from jihadi factions, at least for PR needs, have failed. \\nAnd the recently created New Syrian Army (NSyA) has shown an impotence in clashes with ISIS. The US propaganda campaign to discredit Russian-Syrian-Iranian operations to liberate Aleppo faced a significant problem \u2013 massive civilian casualties during the Mosul offensive, supported by the US-led coalition. \\nIn this case, open and massive supplies of arms and munitions to the terrorist groups in Syria could lead to significant loses for Washington in political and PR terms and will hardly lead to strengthening of the US influence on the Syrian conflict. Recommended Pentagon Announce They Are Arming Al Qaeda To Oust Assad \\nThe Pentagon has announced that it is protecting and arming Al Qaeda/Al Nusra jihadists in Syria, in a last gasp effort to overthrow Assad. You read that correctly - the U.S. is now in coalition with Al Qaeda in a foreign war. (2 hours ago) \\nIf the US administration avoids to do this, Moscow, Damascus and Tehran will fully take the initiative in the war that would also lead to negative effects to the US influence in the Middle East. \\nSo, most likely, Washington will make a compromise decision to allow its regional allies \u2013 Saudi Arabia or Qatar \u2013 to supply limited numbers of man-portable air-defense systems to the so-called \u2018opposition\u2019, even if this opposition is al-Nusra Front. \\nAt the same time, the US-controlled media and diplomats will continue to put pressure on Syria, Russia and Iran over alleged civilian casualties in Aleppo city and ignore the humanitarian situation in Iraq. \\nIt will not allow the terrorists to re-take the initiative in the war but will buy time until the new US president comes into the office and start to impellent own strategy in the region.'"}, "time": 1742628558.3051605}
