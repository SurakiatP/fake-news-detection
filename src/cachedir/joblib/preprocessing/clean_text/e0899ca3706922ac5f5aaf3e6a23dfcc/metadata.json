However, these hopes are likely misplaced. Recent US designs for the destruction of Syria began unfolding, not during the administration of US President Barack Obama, but in fact during the presidency of George Bush, and were merely continued, and clearly expanded upon under President Obama. Pundits and policymakers on both the \u201cleft\u201d and \u201cright\u201d of the Western political spectrum have made arguments for continued, even expanded US war with Syria, simply behind the smokescreen of varying partisan narratives. In the end, however, the Middle Eastern nation\u2019s overthrow \u2013 and failing that \u2013 its incremental and systematic division and destruction, remains Washington\u2019s ultimate endgame. President-Elect Trump\u2019s Surrounded by Eager Warmongers President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s campaign for the past 2 years or so has been openly guided by elements of Washington\u2019s political establishment often referred to as Neo-Conservatives. This includes former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director during the Bill Clinton administration, James Woolsey, an avid supporter of US war with Iran who served as Trump\u2019s adviser on national security, defense and intelligence, Politico would report . Together with Woolsey, Trump has either invited in or courted other members of the so-called Neo-Conservative establishment including former US ambassador to the UN, John Bolton, former New York City mayor, Rudy Giuliani, and former Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Newt Gingrich. Joining them is media personality Steven Bannon of Breitbart News, the establishment\u2019s \u201cright cover\u201d retrenched within what is otherwise the independent and increasingly influential alternative media. Woolsey, Bolton, Giuliani, and Gingrich have all lobbied for years as advocates for war with Iran, including lobbying directly for US State Department-listed foreign terrorist organization, Mujahedeen-e-Khalq (MEK) as a means of propping up a capable, armed, and fanatical proxy with which to indirectly wage war on Iran, much as the US is currently using Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey, and proxy groups like Jabhat Al Nusra and the self-proclaimed \u201cIslamic State\u201d (ISIS) to wage proxy war on Syria. Syria\u2019s Destruction Plotted Under Bush, Carried Out Under Obama, a Prerequisite for War with Iran\u2026 In fact, war with Syria has been long determined by US policymakers as an essential prerequisite before waging war on Iran. Syria\u2019s inclusion within the Bush-era \u201cAxis of Evil\u201d was in fact announced by Trump-ally John Bolton under the Bush administration in 2002. The BBC in a 2002 article titled, \u201c US Expands \u2018Axis of Evil,\u2019 \u201d would report that: The United States has added Cuba, Libya and Syria to the nations it claims are deliberately seeking to obtain chemical or biological weapons. In a speech entitled \u201cBeyond the Axis of Evil\u201d, US Under Secretary of State, John Bolton said that the three nations could be grouped with other so-called \u201crogue states\u201d\u2013 Iraq, Iran and North Korea \u2013 in actively attempting to develop weapons of mass destruction. He also warned that the US would take action. And the US would indeed take action, utterly destroying Libya and setting itself upon Syria, only not during Bush\u2019s eight-year term in office, but under his successor\u2019s administration, beginning in 2011. And while the US proxy war with Syria began in 2011 under Obama, the stage was already being set as early as 2007 under Bush. In Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Seymour Hersh\u2019s 2007 article, \u201c The Redirection: Is the Administration\u2019s new policy benefitting our enemies in the war on terrorism? ,\u201d it would be explicitly stated that (emphasis added): To undermine Iran, which is predominantly Shiite, the Bush Administration has decided, in effect, to reconfigure its priorities in the Middle East. In Lebanon, the Administration has co\u00f6perated with Saudi Arabia\u2019s government, which is Sunni, in clandestine operations that are intended to weaken Hezbollah, the Shiite organization that is backed by Iran. The U.S. has also taken part in clandestine operations aimed at Iran and its ally Syria. A by-product of these activities has been the bolstering of Sunni extremist groups that espouse a militant vision of Islam and are hostile to America and sympathetic to Al Qaeda. Hersh, in his 9-page report, would enumerate how financial, political, and material support was already benefiting extremist organizations associated with this expanding conspiracy, organizations that would soon be directly involved in the 2011 Syrian conflict including the Muslim Brotherhood and armed militant groups aligned with Al Qaeda. US corporate-financier funded policy think tanks including the Brookings Institution as early as 2009 would also reveal that either the coercion or overthrow of the Syrian government, as well as the neutralization of Hezbollah would be essential prerequisites to the eventual attack on and overthrow of the Iranian government, as stated in their extensively detailed report, \u201c Which Path to Persia?: Options for a New American Strategy Toward Iran .\u201d Trump\u2019s Transition Includes Reboot of Syrian-Iranian \u201cAxis of Evil\u201d Narrative It should be noted that Trump\u2019s political allies among Washington\u2019s Neo-Conservative clique, have been lobbying for MEK terrorists as recently as July of this year. In Paris, France, Bolton, Gingrich, and Giuliani were shoulder-to-shoulder with the Saudi Royal Family calling for \u201cregime change\u201d in Tehran. Noting that the elimination of Syria and Hezbollah are essential prerequisites for this \u201cregime change,\u201d should pique concern regarding the incoming administration of President-elect Trump. With Russia\u2019s steadfast intervention in Syria upon Damascus\u2019 request, and with the positive outcome of the Syrian conflict for Moscow key to Russian national security, it is unlikely that genuine rapprochement between the US and Russia can actually be made. The hope of Trump allying the United States with Russia should be interpreted as a political ploy not unlike the now obviously disingenuous \u201creset\u201d Hillary Clinton herself presided over as US Secretary of State in 2009. As Secretary Clinton posed for pictures with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov holding an emergency stop button with \u201creset\u201d written on it, US policymakers were already deeply involved in the planning of not only political unrest within Russia itself through the use of US-funded opposition groups, but planning fully on the liquidation of Russia\u2019s traditional allies throughout the Middle East and North Africa region (MENA), Eastern Europe, and Central Asia via the upcoming \u201cArab Spring\u201d conflagration. With Trump now incoming as US president, the Western media is attempting to capitalize on campaign promises made by Trump himself regarding \u201csafe zones\u201d in Syria and the exploitation of the refugee crisis triggered by US interventions across the MENA region. A CNN article written by conservative media personality Sarah \u201cSE\u201d Cupp titled, \u201c Syria: The issue we can\u2019t ignore anymore ,\u201d repackages Obama-era talking points to dovetail with Trump\u2019s campaign promises. Tellingly, the op-ed states (emphasis added): Trump has made clear during the course of the election that he would not take in any Syrian refugees. While that\u2019s not the position I wish he would take, I can live with this, because keeping refugees out matters to him, and presumably his many supporters. And ultimately, the humane and practical solution is to secure a safe zone within Syria so that other countries, including ours, do not have a refugee crisis in the first place. Indeed, one of the most straightforward things we can do \u2014 and the most significant \u2014 is to give Syrians a safe way to return home. It\u2019s also something Trump and a Republican-led Congress could agree on. However, \u201csafe zones\u201d are not a new idea. They also have nothing to do with addressing the humanitarian disaster unfolding in Syria. They were introduced by the very engineers of the Syrian conflict among US foreign policy circles, and were designed not to help end the war or protect refugees, but to \u201cbleed Syria\u201d to death as a functioning nation state by intentionally protracting fighting for as long as possible. As early as 2012, the Brookings Institution in a document titled, \u201cMiddle East Memo #21: Saving Syria: Assessing Options for Regime Change,\u201d US policymakers would openly declare their intentions to create such \u201csafe zones\u201d stating: An alternative is for diplomatic efforts to focus first on how to end the violence and how to gain humanitarian access, as is being done under Annan\u2019s leadership. This may lead to the creation of safe-havens and humanitarian corridors, which would have to be backed by limited military power. This would, of course, fall short of U.S. goals for Syria and could preserve Asad in power. From that starting point, however, it is possible that a broad coalition with the appropriate international mandate could add further coercive action to its efforts. The document would then openly admit that \u2013 failing to overthrow the Syrian government \u2013 bleeding the nation would be an acceptable alternative, claiming (emphasis added): \\nThe United States might still arm the opposition even knowing they will probably never have sufficient power, on their own, to dislodge the Asad network. Washington might choose to do so simply in the belief that at least providing an oppressed people with some ability to resist their oppressors is better than doing nothing at all, even if the support provided has little chance of turning defeat into victory. Alternatively, the United States might calculate that it is still worthwhile to pin down the Asad regime and bleed it, keeping a regional adversary weak, while avoiding the costs of direct intervention. If it seems that Trump\u2019s campaign speeches, his campaign and transition team, as well as his prospective presidential administration seem fully arrayed to preserve a continuity of agenda that has so far, clearly transcended both the 8 year term of Bush and Obama\u2019s subsequent 8 years in office, that\u2019s because it is. Russian \u201coptimism\u201d regarding America\u2019s incoming president is likely nothing more than a diplomatic gesture of goodwill. And just as Foreign Minister Lavrov humored Secretary Clinton\u2019s \u201creset\u201d charade, fully anticipating treachery, Russia and its Syrian allies must prepare fully for American treachery once again \u2013 from an administration carrying the distinct DNA of the very policy circles that added Syria to the \u201cAxis of Evil\u201d in the first place, and has since then worked ceaselessly to undermine it and its allies for well over a decade.
