The February 9, 2010 email in question was sent to longtime Clinton confidantes Huma Abedin and Cheryl D. Mills, and to Philippe I. Reines, who served as Clinton\u2019s Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Strategic Communications. It was an exchange started by Sullivan, who asked why New York Times columnist David Brooks \u201ctook a shot at me in his column today. \u201d \u201cAny ideas what prompted it?\u201d asked Sullivan. Brooks column that day, titled, \u201cThe House of Tranquillity\u201d did not specifically mention Sullivan. It stated of Clinton and Iraq that, \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s influence on this and all issues is exceptionally hard to figure out. \u201d Brooks may have been referring to Sullivan and other top Clinton aides when he wrote: Finally, Biden was asked to come up with a   agenda. This is a surprisingly difficult job because many of these programs  \u2014   credits for college affordability and child care  \u2014   fairly reek of Clintonism. This is an administration that is staffed by Clintonites but does not want to appear Clintonian in any way. In response to Sullivan\u2019s email asking what may have prompted Brooks\u2019 alleged criticism, Reines replied, \u201cNot sure  \u2014   but this is a good excuse to bring him in for an OTR with you. Lona mentioned you wanted to see Tom Friedman  \u2014   with your ok, we could schedule both (separately) over the next month or so. \u201d OTR is an acronym for an    conversation, something fairly common in government circles.  Reines was referring to Times\u2019 columnist Thomas Friedman. Sullivan responded with his comment about helping media personalities \u201c\u2019figure out\u2019 how things work\u201d: Philippe and I had an offline conversation about this and I agree entirely. I think it makes sense for you to meet with influencers on a regular  \u2014   though not intrusive  \u2014   basis. An OTR conversation with you is the best way to help guys like Brooks \u201cfigure out\u201d how things work. The email was part of a batch of 1, 184 pages released yesterday by Judicial Watch following a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit. The correspondence included 29 previously undisclosed emails.  The Sullivan email about Brooks was also previously released by WiliLeaks, but it received no news media attention. Previous   emails discussed methods of utilizing the news media for messaging. Breitbart News previously reported a memo requested by Clinton recommended that the State Department utilize \u201cSpecialty Media\u201d to get its foreign policy message across, a newly released State Department email reveals. The 2009 memo urged Clinton to use her star power and singled out shows including Oprah, Ellen, The View, and others to be used to \u201camplify and deliver messages that advance policymaking. \u201d The section on The View stated that while the program lacks \u201cinternational distribution, it makes up for it by creating a media echo chamber based on the intense discussions that take place every weekday during the Hot Topics segments. \u201d The reference to The View as \u201ccreating a media echo chamber\u201d may be telling. Last May, a New York Times article quoted a senior Obama administration official who used similar phraseology in describing the alleged use of the news media to sell the Iran nuclear deal to the American public. That plot was referenced in a New York Times Magazine profile of President Obama\u2019s deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes entitled, \u201cThe Aspiring Novelist Who Became Obama\u2019s   Guru. \u201d Robert Malley, senior director at the National Security Council, was quoted saying \u201cexperts\u201d were utilized to create an \u201cecho chamber\u201d that disseminated administration claims about Iran to \u201chundreds of   reporters\u201d in the news media.
