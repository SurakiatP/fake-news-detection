Most people, even those on the right, didn\u2019t believe the billionaire and real estate mogul at the time, but now that his prediction has been proven correct, many are changing their tune about Trump and actually listening to what he has to say. Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump \\nDonald Trump doesn\u2019t always say things in the most eloquent of ways. He often speaks what\u2019s on his mind with no filter and doesn\u2019t seem to care much about who he offends. His politically incorrect way of speaking causes too many to disregard what he has to say, but that\u2019s all about to change after what just happened. Trump called this one over a year ago, and now, thanks to Hillary\u2019s email scandal, he\u2019s been proven accurate. \\nThe FBI announced Friday that it had uncovered new emails relating to its investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s handling of classified information. This was discovered while conducting a separate investigation into the perverted and disgusting sexting habits of former Democratic Congressman Anthony Weiner, who is the estranged husband of Hillary\u2019s closest aide, Huma Abedin, who is also front and center in Hillary Clinton\u2019s email scandals. \\nDonald Trump saw this coming from a mile away, pointing fingers at Weiner as a potential national security threat all the way back in August of 2015. \u201cIt came out that Huma Abedin knows all about Hillary\u2019s private illegal emails,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201c Huma\u2019s PR husband, Anthony Weiner, will tell the world. \u201d Trump has been now been proven right. It came out that Huma Abedin knows all about Hillary\u2019s private illegal emails. Huma\u2019s PR husband, Anthony Weiner, will tell the world. \\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 3, 2015 \\nIt looks like the Donald does know a thing or two about politics and corrupt Democrats. In July, Trump said he didn\u2019t like the thought of \u201cHuma going home at night and telling Anthony Weiner all of these secrets.\u201d Trump also sounded the alarm about Weiner as early September 2013, when he wrote that Huma should \u201cdump the sicko Weiner\u201d because he was \u201ca calamity who is bringing her down with him.\u201d Trump in July: \u201cI don\u2019t like Huma going home at night and telling Anthony Weiner all of these secrets\u201d pic.twitter.com/ksqWCQ4iAd \\n\u2014 Colin Jones (@colinjones) October 28, 2016 \\nDonald Trump\u2019s accurate prediction is sure to make waves in the political scene. It turns out that Weiner may bring down himself, his wife, and Hillary Clinton all at once. It never pays to be a perverted and corrupt Democrat. \\nHillary Clinton cannot seem to surround herself with anyone who is not neck deep in scandals and disturbing behavior. It\u2019s kind of funny that it\u2019s now been revealed that she should have listened to Donald Trump long ago. I bet that doesn\u2019t make her very happy at all.'"}, "time": 1742564438.664742}
