Even while the rest of the Clinton clique is screeching against the FBI for investigating Hillary like bats from the nether regions of left-wing hell, Mitchell is sticking to the old spin. There is no FBI investigation of Hillary . Close your eyes and say it three times. The FBI is not investigating Hillary. It's not. It's not. \\nIn a complete state of denial on Thursday, MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell interrupted live coverage of Donald Trump speaking at a Florida campaign rally to supposedly \u201cfact-check\u201d the candidate for citing a bombshell report that the FBI was conducting an extensive investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s e-mail and charitable foundation scandals. \\nMitchell refused to accept reality: \u201cJust a lot of fact-checking to do. She's not under criminal investigation. In fact, it's not an investigation. It's just a review of the e-mails. She did not lie to the FBI, according to James Comey. There was no grounds to prosecute her. So there are no lies, there\u2019s no criminality.\u201d She fretted: \u201cI don't know even where to start....but I mean, we have to put it in some context.\u201d \\nThe context is that defending Hillary Clinton has become a mental illness. \\nBut as I wrote earlier this week, fact checking has become a media term for insisting on the primacy of its alternate reality even when it flies in the face of actual reality. There is no FBI investigation of Hillary. Anyone who believes that is probably some sort of right-winger who listens to what the FBI actually says, rather than what NBC says that the FBI says. \""}, "time": 1742628580.6313674}
