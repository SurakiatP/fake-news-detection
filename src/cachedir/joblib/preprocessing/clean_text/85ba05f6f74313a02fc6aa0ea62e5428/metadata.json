The House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, was preparing to tell the public that the health care bill was being withdrawn  \u2014   a byproduct, Mr. Trump said, of Democratic partisanship. The president predicted that Democrats would return to him to make a deal in roughly a year. \u201cLook, we got no Democratic votes. We got none, zero,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a telephone interview he initiated with The New York Times. \u201cThe good news is they now own health care. They now own Obamacare. \u201d Mr. Trump insisted that the Affordable Care Act would collapse in the next year, which would then force Democrats to come to the bargaining table for a new bill. \u201cThe best thing that can happen is that we let the Democrats, that we let Obamacare continue, they\u2019ll have increases from 50 to 100 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when it explodes, they\u2019ll come to me to make a deal. And I\u2019m open to that. \u201d Although enrollment in the Affordable Care Act declined slightly in the past year, there is no sign that it is collapsing. Its expansion of Medicaid continues to grow. In a later phone interview with The Times, the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, ridiculed Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks about Democrats being at fault. \u201cWhenever the president gets in trouble, he points fingers of blame,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. \u201cIt\u2019s about time he stopped doing that and started to lead. The Republicans were totally committed to repeal from the   never talked to us once. But now that they realize that repeal can\u2019t work, if they back off repeal, of course we\u2019ll work with them to make it even better. \u201d Mr. Trump said that \u201cwhen they come to make a deal,\u201d he would be open and receptive. He singled out the Tuesday Group moderates for praise, calling them \u201cterrific,\u201d an implicit jab at the House Freedom Caucus, which his aides had expressed frustration with during negotiations. Even so, he tried to minimize the deep divisions within his own party that prevented Mr. Ryan from securing passage of the bill, and maintained that they were six to 12 votes away from getting it across the finish line. As Mr. Trump spoke, his voice was flatly calm and slightly hoarse, his manner subdued. He talked on a speaker phone from his desk in the Oval Office, with a coterie of aides drifting by. At one point, he welcomed his daughter Ivanka back from a ski trip. Mr. Trump said that in states he had visited in the last two weeks, Tennessee and Kentucky, the problems with President Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislation were evident. The president said he was now moving on to taxes and trade as priorities. Mr. Trump described his first major legislative experience as not terribly different than what his previous negotiations as a   developer had been like. He emphatically did not fault Mr. Ryan. \u201cI don\u2019t blame him for a thing, I really don\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Trump said. He added: \u201cEven during the midst of negotiations I said the best thing that could happen was just to back off. I said, I\u2019ll do it now because I\u2019m a team player. \u201d He said that Mr. Ryan did not apologize to him, adding: \u201cLook, he tried. He tried very hard. \u201d \u201cI\u2019m not disappointed,\u201d he insisted. \u201cIf I were, I wouldn\u2019t be calling you. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562537.9310267}
