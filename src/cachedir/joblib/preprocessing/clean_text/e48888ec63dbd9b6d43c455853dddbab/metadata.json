The Gateway Pundit reported that Malik posted a video of himself wearing a Trump hat on Twitter to prove that his account is real. Watch as Malik tells his followers to \u201cvote Trump,\u201d something we never thought we\u2019d hear an Obama say! \\n\u2014 MicroSpookyLeaks\u2122 (@WDFx2EU7) October 27, 2016 Trump made headlines a few weeks ago when he invited Malik to the second presidential debate as his guest. Western Journalism reported that Malik has been an outspoken Trump supporter throughout this election. \u201cI like Donald Trump because he speaks from the heart,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 is a great slogan. I would like to meet him.\u201d As for Trump, he\u2019s very excited to meet Malik as well. \u201cI look very much forward to meeting and being with Malik,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe gets it far better than his brother.\u201d Malik was once a Democrat, but he\u2019s said that foreign policy missteps and social concerns have caused him to move to the Republican side. He has also said he distrusts Hillary Clinton, citing her scandals and dishonesty, which he says have only gotten worse since he originally voiced his support for Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t like [Hillary] Clinton,\u201d Malik said in September, in spite of his half-brother\u2019s proud endorsement. \u201cShe is dishonest and a liar.
