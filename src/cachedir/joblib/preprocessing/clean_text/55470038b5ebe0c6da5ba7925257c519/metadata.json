[\u201cCNN has decided to not move forward with production on the acquired series \u2018Believer with Reza Aslan,\u2019\u201d the network said in a statement reported by Variety. \u201cWe wish Reza and his production team all the best. \u201d  Had CNN picked up the show, it would have entered into its second season. Aslan released a statement accusing CNN of trying to \u201cprotect its brand. \u201d He insisted his show stands for \u201ctolerance,\u201d but his personal statements reflect his role as \u201ca social commentator and scholar\u201d rather than a journalist. My statement about the cancellation of #Believer pic. twitter.   \u2014   Reza Aslan (@rezaaslan) June 9, 2017,  The parting of ways comes as Aslan stirred controversy with a June 3 Twitter attack on President Trump, calling the president a \u201cpiece of shit. \u201d \u201cThis piece of shit is not just an embarrassment to America and a stain on the presidency. He\u2019s an embarrassment to humankind,\u201d Aslan, a man who claims to be a student of religion, wrote in a tweet he later deleted. It turns out the June 3 tweet was not the only time Aslan used Twitter to attack the president in vulgar terms. After Aslan\u2019s   of Trump had gone viral, Twitter users began combing through his feed and found many other examples of the CNN host\u2019s   comments. Twitter users quickly found that Aslan had called the president and his eldest son the   in a past tweet, and in another case, Aslan tweeted that he hoped someone would rape GOP congressional candidate Todd Akin. Twitter users next discovered that Aslan began deleting his problematic tweets after they were uncovered. Aslan also stirred controversy on his CNN show. The host was heavily criticized for eating part of a human brain during a segment about a Hindu sect in India on his CNN series, Believer. The U. S. India Political Action Committee slammed Aslan\u2019s actions, saying, \u201cWith multiple reports of   attacks against people of Indian origin from across the US, the show characterizes Hinduism as cannibalistic, which is a bizarre way of looking at the third largest religion in the world. \u201d In another case, Aslan upset Christians when he excoriated the Christian Bible as \u201creplete with historical errors. \u201d It is interesting that CNN completely ignored Aslan\u2019s many off color and vulgar tweets until now. He has a long history of such tweets liberally dropping   and using the   time and again. For a man who claims to be a student of religion he certainly uses an awful lot of foul language. In one tweet Aslan accused House Speaker Paul Ryan of saying \u201cf*ck\u201d Syrian moms, in another he told conservative commentator Dinesh D\u2019Souza to \u201cgo f*ck\u201d himself,\u201d then he guffawed that Trump didn\u2019t \u201csh*t himself in public,\u201d and those are just a few examples. Except of course Syrian moms fleeing war, famine, and genocide with their starving children. Fuck those moms. https:  .   \u2014   Reza Aslan (@rezaaslan) May 14, 2017,  Hey Dinesh. I\u2019ll say this as politely as I can: Go fuck yourself, you adulterous piece of shit felon. https:  .   \u2014   Reza Aslan (@rezaaslan) October 21, 2016,  But on the plus side he didn\u2019t shit himself in public. https:  .   \u2014   Reza Aslan (@rezaaslan) May 29, 2017,  In fact, on May 9, Aslan arguably said something far worse about Trump than he did in the Tweet that got him fired by CNN: \u201cOh the joy when this lying conniving scumbag narcissistic sociopath piece of shit fake president finally gets what\u2019s coming to him. \u201d Oh the joy when this lying conniving scumbag narcissistic sociopath piece of shit fake president finally gets what\u2019s coming to him. https:  .   \u2014   Reza Aslan (@rezaaslan) May 10, 2017,  Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com.'"}, "time": 1742628550.4646287}
