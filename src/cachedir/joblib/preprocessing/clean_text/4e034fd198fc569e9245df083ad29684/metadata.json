Oh yeah? Well, Amber is going to vote for Hillary! I talked to her the other day.\" \\nFortunately, deputies located the baby, who was with his parents, and the alert was canceled. \\nPerez had reportedly joined local officials earlier that day at Winston-Salem State University, speaking out against the National Rifle Association and calling for stricter gun-safety laws. \\nHis name was also on the VP shortlist prior to Clinton selecting Virginia Senator Tim Kaine, and has been tossed around the ring as Hillary Clinton\\'s potential pick for Attorney General, should she win the election.
