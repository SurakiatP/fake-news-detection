Paul Gosar ( ) and   legal counsel to former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, discussed with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam the recent effort to overhaul the House ethics system. [Flein said the problem with the reform package presented, and then withdrawn, this week was that \u201cit lacked transparency, so it was sort of dropped on the American public without any hearings, without any discussion, and that ultimately led to its failure. \u201d  \u201cIt was a failure of process and the lack of transparency,\u201d he emphasized. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t because it did not have merit, however. And it was not, as the New York Times falsely stated in their Fake News, that it was \u2018gutting\u2019 the OCE [Office of Congressional Ethics] at all. It was modifying that agency to install some basic due process rights. \u201d \u201cAs it\u2019s been going now, members of Congress have been subjected to secretive proceedings, abusive proceedings,\u201d he explained. \u201cThere is a presumption of guilt. There\u2019s a failure to disclose charges so people are not even aware of what the details are of the charges against them. They\u2019ve been punished for simply hiring an attorney to represent them. And it\u2019s being used for partisan purposes to get bad headlines and make people look bad. So the reforms were needed. \u201d  \u201cI\u2019m very familiar with that, by the way, having represented Governor Palin,\u201d he added. \u201cI think I handled 23 or 24 ethics complaints, of which we got all of them dismissed, but they all caused headlines, negative headlines. And then when the matter gets dismissed, after tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees and six months of proceedings, you don\u2019t get any news update on that. It\u2019s certainly not on the front page, which is where the complaint goes. \u201d Van Flein estimated that the ethics reform plan would resurface in Congress in \u201csix months to a year. \u201d \u201cWhen   Trump sent out his tweet that said, \u2018Hey, we need to focus on some other issues first,\u2019 I think the members of Congress heard that loud and clear and said, \u2018You know what? He\u2019s right. Before we clean up our own house here, let\u2019s get our economic package going. Let\u2019s get our tax reform going. Let\u2019s get the things that matter to the new President and to the new Congress. Let\u2019s get the important issues going in the next six months. And then we can clean up messes like this at some point later,\u201d he said. Kassam asked if it was wrong for Congress to have different priorities than the White House. \u201cNot at all,\u201d Van Flein replied. \u201cIt\u2019s a separate branch of government, and they have their own priorities and their own problems to deal with. But I do think it\u2019s been a great sign of respect to the   what they did. \u201d He said it was hard to tell if concern about bad press, a conflict with the White House, or conflict with \u201cvindictive\u201d Democrats were motivating factors in withdrawing the ethics reform proposals, as Kassam suggested. \u201cI think what was motivating is, now that there is a clear majority in the House and Senate, and a President that might sign it, that they took the opportunity to say this is long overdue. And by the way, it was bipartisan, prior to earlier this week. You would think that only the Republicans wanted to reform this. There were many Democrats previously calling for the same reforms that were presented in this package. It did not gut this agency, by the way. It just made it more transparent,\u201d Van Flein argued. \u201cThey\u2019re going to pursue it. It\u2019s going to come up again,\u201d he predicted. \u201cBecause it affects every member of Congress, and it\u2019s extremely unfair, and they at least have the power in their lives to change the law  \u2014   unlike, you know, the rest of us, when an administrative agency or a bureaucracy is unfair to the average person it takes a lot sometimes to get these changes made. \u201d Kassam asked if Van Flein thought the existing ethics system was abused more frequently to damage Republicans than Democrats. \u201cIn general, that appears to be the case,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t the Republicans do it back?\u201d asked Kassam. \u201cI would like to believe that the conservatives, at least, believe that there has to be merit before signing your name on a complaint, saying that somebody did something wrong, that there\u2019s some factual basis for this,\u201d Van Flein suggested. \u201cAnd I would like to believe that at least the conservatives are dealing with the world of facts, rather than a world of delusion. That may not be the case, but I think it is, or at least I think the majority is that way. \u201d He said using spurious ethics complaints and lawsuits to preoccupy opponents and drain their financial resources implements \u201cat least two of Alinsky\u2019s tactics,\u201d referring to Rules for Radicals author Saul Alinsky. \u201cYou can isolate the person and personalize it, even though what we\u2019re really talking about are policy issues that they disagree with. They want to isolate a target and make it personal,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd then they want to use the state\u2019s own rules  \u2014   in part that have been written by members of Congress  \u2014   against themselves  \u2014   hold other people accountable to the very rules that they later destroy or abandon or don\u2019t comply with, with impunity, it seems. \u201d Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.
