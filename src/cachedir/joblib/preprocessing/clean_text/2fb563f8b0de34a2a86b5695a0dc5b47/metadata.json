At least, that\u2019s what the West and the mainstream media want you to believe . However, the truth is the United States and its allies are using the \u201cwar crimes\u201d and \u201ccrimes of historic proportions\u201d in Syria to prolong the proxy war, overthrow Assad, and annex an independent country. Sadly, the United Nations, Amnesty International, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, and other \u201cconcerned parties\u201d (including the mainstream media), support the West in its malicious intent.\\nThe Western Claim \u201cRussia and the Syrian regime owe the world more than an explanation about why they keep hitting hospitals and medical facilities and children and women,\u201d US Secretary of State John Kerry recently commented. Kerry begged for an investigation of the Russian and Syrian military strikes against civilians and medical facilities in Aleppo, as war crimes.\\n\u201cThere is clear and abundant evidence the Assad regime and the Russian government are committing crimes that include, but are not limited to, deliberate attacks on civilians, collective punishment, starvation as a tool of war, torture, murder, inhumane treatment of prisoners and the use of chemical weapons on the battlefield,\u201d asserted The Washington Post .\\n\u201cThe ancient city of Aleppo, a place of millennial civility and beauty, is today a slaughterhouse \u2014 a gruesome locus of pain and fear, where the lifeless bodies of small children are trapped under streets of rubble and pregnant women deliberately bombed,\u201d observed the UN human rights\u2019 chief, seeking a war crimes inquiry.\\nThe Western Evidence 1. A commission for International Justice and Accountability \u2014 a non-profit organization funded by western states including the UK, US, the EU, Germany, Switzerland, Norway, Canada and Denmark \u2014 smuggled over 600,000 top-secret Syrian government documents brought to Western Europe .\\nAn analysis of some 400 documents \u201clinked the systematic torture and murder of tens of thousands of Syrians to a written policy approved by President Bashar al-Assad, coordinated among his security-intelligence agencies, and implemented by regime operatives.\u201d Current status: Neither the documents nor the evidence has been made public.\\n2. A decorated American journalist and a former CIA officer, Adam Ciralsky wrote about the 53,275 photos that \u201cCaesar\u201d (a Syrian military photographer turned war crimes whistleblower, who fled the country in August 2013) took as grisly evidence of Assad\u2019s brutality.\\n\u201cThe pictures, most of them taken in Syrian military hospitals, show corpses photographed at close range \u2014 one at a time as well as in small groupings. Virtually all of the bodies \u2014 thousands of them \u2014 betray signs of torture: gouged eyes; mangled genitals ; bruises and dried blood from beatings; acid and electric burns; emaciation; and marks from strangulation,\u201d Ciralsky explained. Current Status: The treasure trove, as well as the photographer \u201cCaesar,\u201d is hidden from the public eye.\\n3. In 2015, Amnesty International documented the systematic and widespread \u201cunthinkable atrocities\u201d war crimes, and crimes against humanity committed by Assad\u2019s regime, in a 74-page report (including indiscriminate use of explosive weapons, arbitrary arrests, torture, and enforced disappearances). The \u2018heartbreaking\u2019 research involved merely 78 residents (mostly former) and 29 professionals working in Aleppo .\\n4. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights \u2014 the London-based monitoring group, often Quote: d as the most authoritative source of information about human rights abuse in Syria \u2014 is a tool of Western propaganda run by one man who last visited Syria in 2000 (11 years before the armed conflict began). He relies on \u201cintelligence\u201d allegedly gathered by around 200 \u201cactivists\u201d who he has never met. Current Status: Whatever the SOHR claims, the mainstream media reports as truth without verifying its nature \u2013 because the SOHR does not reference any sources.\\nThe Western Lies Why is the angry and (nowadays) concerned world not asking the United States and the mainstream media a few pertinent questions? What is the West doing in Syria? Why is the peace-loving West prolonging the war? Why is the West backing the rebels in a foreign country? Why is the West funding and arming ISIS?\\nWhy are the Western forces not being held accountable for war crimes like bombing a hospital? Why is the mainstream media, the NGOs and the UN not holding the West accountable for crimes committed on their own land, or in Israel, Africa or Yemen?\\nOne reason may be because of the abundance of natural gas under Syrian soil, and that this may very well be another \u2018petrodollar\u2019 war . The US had long had its gaze set on Syria \u2013 years before the civil war and the 2011 \u201crevolution.\u201d Leaked WikiLeaks cables show the US ambassador to Syria (2004-2007) William Roebuck discussing a plan to remove Assad from power, in December 2006 .\\nWhile the Russian and Iranian forces entered Syria on Assad\u2019s request to fight against ISIS and armed rebels, the Western military invaded Syria \u2014 a sovereign country and United Nations member state \u2014 to violently overthrow the Syrian government.\\nWhy didn\u2019t the West invade Saudi Arabia to initiate \u201chumanitarian intervention\u201d and save innocent citizens from its brutal dictator? Saudi Arabia remains a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council and a U.S. ally, despite its poor human rights record \u2014 if attacking an independent harmless country is justified, why did the US act against Osama bin Laden?\\nThe Western effort to annex Syria has relied on a series of crudely-spun lies and media-generated talking points. In September, RT dared to expose the top 10 Western lies about Syrian conflict that the mainstream media are trading in, to fool the Western public into backing yet another failed \u2018nation-building\u2019 project (after Yugoslavia, Iraq and Libya). Obviously, the fear mongering media didn\u2019t find it profitable to give the lies much, if any, coverage in the West.\\nFrom calling the conflict a fault of wicked Assad, and Assad a brutal dictator who enjoyed no popular support, to portraying him as an uncompromising President interested only in \u2018killing his own people\u2019 \u2013 and not in peace and reconciliation, the list is endless. From accusing the Syrian government and Russia for helping ISIS and terming the Western interventions in Syria as humanitarian, to claiming Russia was acting out of self-interest and that the West was on the side of the \u2018good guys\u2019 in Syria, can you be certain of the \u2018truth\u2019? Realistically, the West hasn\u2019t been fighting \u2018terror\u2019 in Syria, it has aided it.\\nRemember the American journalist Serena Shim, who was killed in October 2014, after she revealed the ISIS-Turkey-US link that proved the West was assisting ISIS in Syria?\\nThe Syrian Reality Henry Lowendorf, a member of the Executive Board of the U.S. Peace Council\u2019s Peace and Fact-Finding Delegation to Syria \u2013 who returned from Syria in August \u2013 noted: \u201cWhat we saw in Syria goes against everything we read in the United States.\u201d\\nBefore 2011, illiteracy in Syria had been wiped out; the life expectancy was 75.9 years and the government spent massive amounts of money on improving the nation. Developing irrigation, electricity, water and road building projects, and expanding the health services and education to rural areas, all occurred; and China invested hundreds of millions of dollars to modernize Syria\u2019s aging oil and gas infrastructure.'"}, "time": 1742562038.8868341}
