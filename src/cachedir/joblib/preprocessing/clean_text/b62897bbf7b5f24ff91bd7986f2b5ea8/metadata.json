The group, the Today\u2019s Game Era Committee, is made up of eight Hall of Fame inductees, five M. L. B. executives and three writers and historians. Inductees needed a minimum of 12 votes at baseball\u2019s winter meetings outside of Washington. Selig and Schuerholz will be inducted into the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N. Y. in July. George Steinbrenner, the owner of the Yankees from 1973 until his death in 2010, was also on the ballot but received fewer than five votes, failing to be elected for the third time. Also on the ballot were the former players Mark McGwire, Albert Belle, Harold Baines, Orel Hershiser and Will Clark. Davey Johnson and Lou Piniella were also considered for their careers as managers. McGwire, who hit 583 home runs but admitted to using steroids during his playing career, also received fewer than five votes. Selig, the original owner of the Milwaukee Brewers, led baseball from 1992 through 2014, one of the most dynamic and controversial periods in its history, in which the sport grew into a $10    industry. He governed, in part, through his ability to build consensus among the owners, perhaps his greatest skill. \u201cWe were a sport resistant to change,\u201d Selig said. \u201cI believe in those years that is the most change in baseball history. \u201d Selig, 82, was the acting commissioner during the worst strike in baseball history, a work stoppage that wiped out the 1994 World Series, and the   steroid era that so badly tarnished the image of the game. But baseball has now gone 22 years without a work stoppage, and, after great upheaval and acrimony, it has instituted a stringent drug policy. \u201cYes, it was terribly painful, broke my heart,\u201d he said of the 1994 strike. \u201cBut it served as a great lesson and we took it. The same thing with the steroid thing. Yes it was painful, yes it had its ups and downs. But we solved that problem. We now have the toughest testing program in American sports. \u201d Selig is credited with introducing popular innovations including the   playoff system, realignment, interleague play and television replay of umpires\u2019 decisions, as well as with the creation of baseball\u2019s lucrative internet presence, M. L. B. Advanced Media. More than anything, Selig was a tireless supporter of   and midmarket teams, pushing through   policies that redistributed millions of dollars from the larger market teams to the smaller ones. That, combined with the increased number of playoff spots, gave clubs from cities like Detroit, Houston, Kansas City and Tampa Bay entr\u00e9e into the World Series in recent years. \u201cWhat I inherited in \u201992 was a system that was archaic and hadn\u2019t been changed since what I call the Ebetts Field and Polo Grounds days,\u201d he said. \u201cI am proudest of that. It was painful and took a lot of time, but it saved a lot of   clubs who would tell you they wouldn\u2019t be in business. \u201d Another of Selig\u2019s legacies  \u2014   tethering the result of the   Game to   advantage in the World Series  \u2014   was rescinded in the latest version of baseball\u2019s collective bargaining agreement with its players\u2019 union. Selig was also an advocate for recognizing baseball\u2019s role as a social institution. In 1997, he was instrumental in honoring Jackie Robinson, who broke baseball\u2019s color barrier in 1947, by having all teams retire Robinson\u2019s No. 42. Once a minority owner of the Milwaukee Braves, Selig brought baseball back to Wisconsin in 1970 when he bought the Seattle Pilots, renamed them the Brewers and moved them into Milwaukee\u2019s County Stadium. He succeeded Fay Vincent, of whom he had been critical as an owner, as the acting commissioner of baseball in 1992, then assumed the role permanently in 1998. Schuerholz, 76, was the general manager of the Royals from 1981 until 1990 and presided over their 1985 World Series championship. He moved to Atlanta in 1990 to rebuild the   Braves, and within a year he had constructed a team that would go on to win 14 consecutive National League East titles (not including the strike year of 1994) five National League pennants and the 1995 World Series. Results of the regular annual election, the baseball writers\u2019 vote on recently retired candidates, will be announced on Jan. 18.'"}, "time": 1742561998.5878656}
