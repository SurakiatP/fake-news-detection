[Coulter poked fun at Griffin, who has based much of her public image on being an irreverent   \u201cgay icon,\u201d described as such by the likes of Gawker and TMZ. Coulter found the gory video an odd choice for Griffin, given its similarity to images popularized by violent Islamists like ISIS, who not only post pictures of themselves with the severed heads of allegedly gay men, but have been known to throw gay men from buildings to their deaths in the name of Sharia Law.
