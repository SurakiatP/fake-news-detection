Howe  \u2014   Mr. Hockey to the sports world  \u2014   was 88. The Red Wings said he died at the home of his son Murray in the Toledo area. Howe, who received a diagnosis of dementia in 2012, had a stroke in 2014 that impaired his speech and movement. Wayne Gretzky was celebrated as the Great One for his scoring prowess. Bobby Orr was recognized as hockey\u2019s incomparable defenseman. But Howe, who learned the game on the frozen ponds of Saskatchewan, could do it all, and he kept at it after his hair had turned silver and he had become a grandfather. \u201cIf you were ever going to make a mold for a hockey player with five strengths  \u2014   offense, defense, durability, toughness and versatility  \u2014   you wouldn\u2019t look past Gordie Howe,\u201d Scotty Bowman, the N. H. L. \u2019s leader in coaching victories and a   Stanley Cup winner, once said. \u201cIn my estimation, he was the best ever. \u201d Gretzky idolized Howe as a young player, wearing his No. 9 in amateur leagues and donning red and white socks to copy Howe\u2019s Red Wings attire. \u201cThere\u2019s one Gordie Howe, and it\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d Gretzky said when he closed in on Howe\u2019s career points record in 1989. \u201cI\u2019m not ever trying to replace him. \u201d Howe played professional hockey for 32 seasons, most of them with the Red Wings. Playing at right wing, he scored with subtle maneuvers at a time when the slap shot had yet to become a favorite offensive weapon and defensive play was strong. He handled the puck magnificently, setting up teammates with precise passes. He inflicted crushing body checks and   elbows or   on opponents who had incurred his ire. There was hockey\u2019s traditional hat trick  \u2014   three goals by a player in a single game  \u2014   and what became known as the Howe hat trick: a goal, an assist and a fight. At 6 feet and 205 pounds, Howe was relatively big for his era and had a body   for hockey, with long arms, a strong torso and outstanding balance. Playing before helmets were required, he endured numerous injuries and some 500 stitches in his face. He almost died during the 1950 playoffs when he crashed into the boards trying to check Ted Kennedy, a star forward with the Maple Leafs Howe sustained a fractured skull and had emergency surgery to relieve pressure on his brain. Howe teamed with his fellow Hall of Famers Sid Abel at center and Ted Lindsay at left wing on a unit known as the Production Line when the Red Wings dominated the league in the early 1950s. \u201cPinpoint passing,\u201d Abel once said. \u201cThey used to say that if you blindfolded us, we\u2019d still be able to find one another. All of us knew where everyone else was at any given moment. \u201d\u2019 \u201dBy the time Howe retired for the second and final time in 1980 as the oldest player in N. H. L. history, he had set records for most seasons (26) games played (1, 767) goals (801) assists (1, 049) and points (1, 850). He won both the Hart Trophy as the N. H. L. \u2019s most valuable player and the Art Ross Trophy as the league\u2019s top points scorer six times.\u201d \u2019Orr, who starred with the Boston Bruins, marveled at Howe\u2019s blend of supreme talent and combativeness. \u201cHe has the reputation of being a tough player and using his elbows and so on,\u201d Orr told USA Today in 1999. \u201cBut Gordie Howe can play any way you want him to play. You want to play tough, you play tough. You want to just play, you play. He didn\u2019t shy away from anything. He was the total package. \u201d Howe was named a   or   N. H. L.   21 times. The four Stanley Cups he helped the Red Wings win came in 1950, \u201952, \u201954 and \u201955, when the N. H. L. was a fiercely competitive   league. After playing for Detroit from 1946 to 1971, he had seemingly retired. But after two seasons off the ice, he teamed with his sons Mark, a future Hall of Fame defenseman, and Marty, a left wing, for six seasons in the World Hockey Association and in a final year with the N. H. L. \u2019s Hartford Whalers. In his 25 seasons with the Red Wings, Howe was among the N. H. L. \u2019s top five scorers for 20 consecutive years. At 50, he led his team, the New England Whalers of the W. H. A. in scoring with 96 points. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1972 during his first retirement, the normal   waiting period having been waived. Hailed throughout the hockey world, Howe was especially revered in Detroit, much like the Tigers\u2019 Ty Cobb and boxing\u2019s Joe Louis. Montreal Canadiens right wing Maurice Richard, the only challenger to Howe\u2019s   in their era, may have had greater flair as a shotmaker, but Howe was the more complete player. Eddie Shore, the Bruins\u2019 Hall of Fame defenseman of the 1920s and \u201930s, was the original Mr. Hockey. Howe once recalled: \u201cHe saw me play a game and I hadn\u2019t scored a goal, but defensively I came in handy a few times. He came over and he just congratulated me and said, \u2018You\u2019re playing the game the way it should be played. \u2019\u201d Gordon Howe was born on March 31, 1928, in Floral, Saskatchewan his family moved to nearby Saskatoon when he was a few days old. He grew up there as the fifth of nine children, playing hockey outdoors with makeshift equipment, the prairie winds raging and temperatures far below zero. \u201cWe had to play with a tennis ball instead of a puck,\u201d he once recalled. \u201cThe ball would get so hard we\u2019d have to get new ones all the time. A woman next door used to warm them up in an oven for us. \u201d He honed his physique by doing construction work with his father. At age 14, Gordie lifted five   bags of cement at a time while building sidewalks. Howe signed with the Red Wings organization at 16, spent two years in the juniors and minors, then made his N. H. L. debut at Olympia Stadium in Detroit on Oct. 16, 1946, scoring against the Toronto Maple Leafs goalie and future Hall of Famer Turk Broda. Howe never equaled what had been the   goal record of 50, set by the Canadiens\u2019 Richard in   falling one goal short eight seasons later. But he broke Richard\u2019s career goal mark of 544 in 1963. Howe retired in 1971 to take a   post with the Red Wings, presumably intending to remain off the ice. But he was given little to do, and he returned to the game in 1973 when the W. H. A. was created, gaining an opportunity to play with his teenage sons under a $2 million, multiyear deal with the Houston Aeros. Howe scored 174 goals in the W. H. A. playing with his sons through four seasons with Houston and two with the New England Whalers. In   the three Howes played together in the N. H. L. when the New England team, having been renamed the Hartford Whalers, joined the league after the dissolution of the W. H. A. Howe scored 15 goals and had 26 assists in his final N. H. L. season. At the age of 69, he took a   turn on Oct. 3, 1997, for the International Hockey League\u2019s Detroit Vipers to become hockey\u2019s only   professional. As skilled as he was, Howe could be a brutal player adept at retaliating for a slight when the referee was not looking. \u201cIt\u2019s a man\u2019s game,\u201d he once said. \u201cYou have to be tough to survive. I learned right off that throwing the first spear was the best way. \u201d Stan Mikita, the Chicago Blackhawks\u2019 Hall of Fame center, once told The Detroit Free Press what happened after he cut Howe under the eye early in his career. \u201cA couple of minutes later at the Olympia, we were both turning in the Wings\u2019 end. The next thing I remember I was at the Chicago bench, my head is killing me. Our backup goalie, Denis DeJordy, said he was the only one in the building who saw what happened. Gordie had skated by me, slipped his right hand up under his armpit, pulled out his fist, popped me in the jaw and put his glove back on. \u201cA few shifts later, he ambled by and asked if I learned anything. I said, \u2018Are we even?\u2019 Gordie says, \u2018I\u2019ll think about it. \u2019\u201d Howe and his wife, Colleen, were a savvy couple off the ice. Colleen, his agent in his last years in hockey, formally registered the name Mr. Hockey and developed extensive family business enterprises along with his endorsements. They promoted the Howe Foundation for charitable work. She was found to have Pick\u2019s disease, a rare form of dementia, in 2002 and died seven years later at 76. In addition to his sons Mark, the director of pro scouting for the Red Wings Marty and Murray, a physician, Howe is survived by his daughter, Cathy Purnell a sister, Helen Cummine nine grandchildren and four  . His brother Vic, who played briefly for the Rangers in the 1950s, died last year. When he neared his 75th birthday, Howe spoke of the key to his long career. \u201cThere is no doubt in my mind that it was my love for the game,\u201d he told The Free Press. \u201cTo succeed, you\u2019ve got to love what you\u2019re doing. I tell kids, if you don\u2019t love it, get out of the way for someone who does. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564580.5987535}
