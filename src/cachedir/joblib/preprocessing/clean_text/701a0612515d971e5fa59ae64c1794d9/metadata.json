Ramone yelled to a tightly packed crowd at the Rebellion Festival here earlier this month, and a little roar rippled through a sea of   mohawks,   spikes  \u2014   and more than a few balding heads. It was 40 years ago this summer that the Ramones flew to London and played a July 4 concert at the Roundhouse in Camden, an event that many cite as the moment that punk rock first took flight in Britain. A month earlier, a   London group called the Sex Pistols had played a gig at Lesser Free Trade Hall in Manchester. It has been said that there were only a few dozen people in attendance, but every one went out and started a band. \u201cI\u2019ve said this quote before, but I\u2019ll say it again,\u201d Steve Diggle of the Buzzcocks said in a recent interview over a pint of Guinness in London. \u201cIf Jesus was born in Bethlehem, British punk was born in Manchester at that gig. \u201d The anniversary of that summer is being celebrated in Punk London, a citywide, yearlong series of exhibitions, talks and concerts supported by the mayor\u2019s office and the National Lottery. Proving, perhaps, that punk\u2019s rebellious spirit hasn\u2019t yet receded into rock\u2019s history books, this institutional endorsement of an   movement has drawn skepticism, a little bit of ridicule and even some mild acts of resistance. \u201cWe heard our song on BBC News,\u201d as part of the anniversary celebrations, Noel Martin, 61, of the band Menace, which formed in the   said outside the Blackpool festival grounds. The song, \u201cG. L. C. ,\u201d which stood for Greater London Council, took aim at the city government, whose conservative members had called for a ban on punk concerts. \u201cBBC banned that song 40 years ago, how come they\u2019re playing it now?\u201d In March, Joe Corr\u00e9, the son of the fashion designer Vivienne Westwood and the Sex Pistols manager, Malcolm McLaren, vowed to burn 5 million pounds, or about $6. 46 million, worth of punk memorabilia to protest what he saw as the   of the movement. (The event, which is planned for this fall, was promptly added by a City Hall staff member to the Punk London website). In July, the singer Viv Albertine of the band the Slits visited the British Library for a talk connected to Punk London. While there, she stopped by the institution\u2019s punk history exhibition to scrawl over the names of prominent female punk artists in permanent marker onto to the show\u2019s signage. \u201cWhat about the women! !\u201d she wrote on a sign, crossing out the names of male punk groups and replacing them with   acts like Siouxsie and the Banshees and   Spex. The concerts of the summer of \u201976 proved a crucible: In the months that followed, punk broke into public consciousness across Britain. The Clash, the Buzzcocks and the Damned gained nationwide attention. And the Sex Pistols became tabloid sensations, both for their wild behavior and their   lyrics, particularly for \u201cGod Save the Queen,\u201d an   screed that suggested the queen was the head of a \u201cfascist regime. \u201d The reaction from the news media was swift: Sex Pistols tracks, including \u201cQueen\u201d and \u201cAnarchy in the U. K.,\u201d were banned from the BBC, and, after reports that band members had spit on and yelled at staff at Heathrow Airport, the Pistols were dropped from their record label, EMI. The Sex Pistols dissolved in spectacular fashion months later, but the Ramones soldiered on for another 20 years (C. J. Ramone joined the band in the late \u201980s). Fans and musicians at the Rebellion Festival in Blackpool, a resort town on the Irish Sea, noted the incongruity of the establishment\u2019s embracing of punk rock, but they said the British punk scene was vibrant and even growing. \u201cWe go to gigs every week here, Manchester, Birmingham,\u201d Graham Norris, 51, a fan of punk, said over a hot dog on the first day of the festival. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of good bands coming through, a lot of them,\u201d said Mr. Norris, who carried a cane and had a single synthetic green dreadlock threaded onto his last wisp of natural hair. \u201cMaybe their dads were punks, maybe their mothers were punks and they\u2019ve picked up on it. \u201d This festival\u2019s lineup reflected that intergenerational spirit: Early bands like Agnostic Front and the Buzzcocks split the bill with newer acts like Youth Man and Angry Itch. Outside the main venue, a group of young punk fans gathered on a stoop, smoking and swigging from liquor bottles. One young musician, Connor MacPherson, 18, whose band the Antiseptics played at Punk Weekender, a   concert series held at the Roundhouse in July to commemorate the anniversary of the Ramones concert, said that the punk spirit was particularly relevant now that conservatives control Britain\u2019s government. Describing himself as a \u201csocialist with anarchist tendencies,\u201d Mr. MacPherson got a rousing response from the others when he lobbed a shot at David Cameron, the former prime minister. \u201cWe have got a government that doesn\u2019t care about the youth, that doesn\u2019t care about the   people,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need punk more than ever  \u2014   we need punk more than they needed it in 1977. \u201d Nella Bellinzoni, 62, was selling bags and   sweaters in the halls of the festival. With blue hair sprayed vertical and reaching about a foot above her head (she said it took her around one and a half cans of hair spray and three hours to achieve the look) Ms. Bellinzoni, who described herself as an \u201cold punk, from the beginning,\u201d expressed a sunny vision of punk\u2019s future. \u201cIt\u2019s getting more and more stronger,\u201d Ms. Bellinzoni, a native of Italy who lives near Blackpool, said. \u201cAll the kids, when their father or mother was punk, then they\u2019re punk as well. \u201d One   duo was Simon Reynolds, 50, who took a train from London to Blackpool and his    son, Oscar. Mr. Reynolds, who started listening to punk in the early \u201980s, said he thought that the movement had cleaned up its act somewhat since the early years and grown a \u201cconscience. \u201d Oscar, with spiky green hair and a   advertising the punk band Gnarwolves, said he became interested in punk about eight years ago, through skateboarding and through his father. He said that he appreciated the sympathy for the working classes, and also that he liked that the music was different from what his friends listened to. Asked whether he ever felt strange dabbling in the same music scene as his father, he looked briefly incredulous. \u201cNo, no,\u201d he said with a chuckle, before his face got serious and he added, \u201cMy dad\u2019s rad. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561702.880293}
