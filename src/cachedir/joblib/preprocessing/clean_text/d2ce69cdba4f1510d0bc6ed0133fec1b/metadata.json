For years, Barack Obama has weathered a barrage of race-based hatred, with people who would become Trump\u2019s Basket of Deplorables calling him \u201cmonkey\u201d and \u201cape\u201d and \u201cn*gger\u201d\u2014 and, yes, complaining that President Obama (who was born in Hawaii) needs to go \u201cback to Africa.\u201d In this case, Deplorable Fox News contributor Sean Hannity told the President to get on a plane to Kenya after the election and never return. \\n\u201cI have an offer for the President. I will charter a plane for you and your family,\u201d Hannity said on his radio show. \u201cI will charter it to the country of your choice. You want to go to Canada? I\u2019ll pay for you to go to Canada. You want to go to Kenya? I\u2019ll pay for you to go to Kenya. Jakarta, where you went to school back in the day, you can go back there.\u201d \\n\u201cI will charter Donald Trump\u2019s plane if he\u2019ll let me,\u201d Hannity added, noting that there is \u201cone stipulation\u201d\u2014\u201cYou can\u2019t come back!\u201d \\nNaturally, this message of \u201cgo back to Africa and stay there\u201d resonated with conservatives, with many chiming in to offer their own suggestions on right-wing lie-factory Western Journalism\u2019s comment section . Some suggested he be flown to Guantanamo Bay to be tortured for 50 years. Others suggested outright assassination. One man even made a creepy remark about stalking Malia Obama in the bathroom: \\nAll of these people will be voting for Mr. Deplorable on November 28. Make sure you\u2019re out there on November 8, when it\u2019s actually Election Day.
