A book is \u201cchallenged\u201d when someone, like a parent or other community member, complains and tries to get the book removed from a library or a school curriculum. It\u2019s the first time the Cosby series has attracted a complaint, the organization said. The \u201cLittle Bill\u201d books, first published in 1997, tell the adventures of Bill Jr. a    Philadelphia boy, and were the basis for an animated TV series. The series\u2019 appearance on the list is unusual because it\u2019s the first time since the office started to compile data in 1990 that a book made the list because of its author, rather than its contents. The complaints arose because of the recent sexual allegations made against Mr. Cosby, according to the association. Over the last few years, Mr. Cosby has faced accusations of sexual assault made by numerous women, which he denies. In June, he is to stand trial in Pennsylvania on sexual assault charges. The office reported 323 challenges to books last year, a slightly higher number than in 2015, many arising because of sexually explicit themes. The book that received the most complaints, \u201cThis One Summer,\u201d by Mariko Tamaki, is a young adult graphic novel that was challenged because it \u201cincludes L. G. B. T. characters, drug use, and profanity, and it was considered sexually explicit with mature themes. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628606.3240135}
