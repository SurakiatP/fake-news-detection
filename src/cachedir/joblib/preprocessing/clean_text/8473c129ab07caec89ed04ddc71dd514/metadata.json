Donald Trump likes to boast about the endorsement he\u2019s received from military personnel, but he\u2019ll have to work a lot harder to win over those who serve if he is elected as the next Commander-in-Chief. As was recently reported, 55 generals denounced the Republican Presidential candidate in a historic rebuke last week. And now, a group of female veterans with the Common Defense PAC have released a compelling new ad called \u201cBlue Falcon\u201d. \\nThe Common Defense PAC defines itself as \u201ca diverse group of male and female veterans\u201d who represent the United States Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Army Reserves, and Air National Guard. In the ad below, women from various branches of the military explain their aspirations for serving, as well as their disgust with the business tycoon who is running for President. Said veteran Wendy Barranco: \u201cAs a migrant, I wanted to give something back to this country that had given me and my family so much. So I became an Army combat medic. When you\u2019re fighting to save a fellow soldier\u2019s life, things get real very quickly. You have to trust your team.\u201d \\nIt\u2019s made clear, however, that Donald Trump is not the guy you\u2019d want on your team. Barranco continued: \u201cGuys like Donald Trump? We call them Blue Falcons.\u201d \\nIn case you\u2019re not familiar with the term, it\u2019s a derogatory euphemism for \u201cbuddy-fucker.\u201d The women also explain that a Blue Falcon is the type of person who will step on their teammate to get ahead . \\nFrom his declaration that it should be \u201cexpected\u201d for rape to take place in the military to his inappropriate and abrasive comments toward women, minorities, and disabled individuals, he is not the best candidate for President, the veterans assert.
