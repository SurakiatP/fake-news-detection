Sputnik News interviewed former UK ambassador to Uzbekistan Craig Murray. He explained \u201c(t)he source of these emails and leaks has nothing to do with Russia at all.\u201d \\n\u201cI discovered what the source was when I attended the Sam Adam\u2019s whistleblower award in Washington,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe source of these emails comes from within official circles in Washington DC. You should look to Washington not to Moscow\u2026 WikiLeaks has never published any material received from the Russian government or from any proxy of the Russian government. It\u2019s simply a completely untrue claim designed to divert attention from the content of the material.\u201d \\nThe pieces are in place to assure a Hillary victory on Tuesday. But the system is now so broken due to rifts inside the ruling class, that surprises might be inevitable. Photo by IoSonoUnaFotoCamera \\nHillary, campaign aides, DNC officials and media scoundrel press agents irresponsibly blame Russia working collaboratively with Trump. The Big Lie repeated enough gets most people to believe it. Given Hillary\u2019s unpopularity, maybe the tactic is less effective in her case. Whistleblower insiders uncover important information everyone has a right to know. They leak it to sources like WikiLeaks. Julian Assange and others working with him then publish it \u2013 including a treasure trove of damning Hillary and Podesta emails. \u2026 Will it make a difference next Tuesday? Not if things are rigged for her as Trump claims. If he loses and challenges the outcome, things could get pretty dicey ahead.
