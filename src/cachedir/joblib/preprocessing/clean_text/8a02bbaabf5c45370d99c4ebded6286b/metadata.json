[The Ottawa, Ontario, university calls the decision \u201cin keeping with current fitness and social trends,\u201d Fox News reported.  The school\u2019s manager of health and wellness, Bruce Marshall, claims that the move helps improve the mental   and health of the school\u2019s students. Indeed, Marshall went on to insist that scales only remind people they are fat and can have a \u201cnegative impact\u201d on health. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe being fixated on weight has any positive effect on your health and \u201d Marshall said to Canada\u2019s The Charlatan newspaper. \u201cThe body is an amazing machine and even when we are dieting and training it will often find a homeostasis at a certain weight. \u201d Marshall excused his position saying that body changes can take months, so \u201cwhy obsess\u201d about weight indicators? Some students agreed with the move. One even labeled scales as \u201ctriggering. \u201d \u201cScales are very triggering,\u201d student Samar El Faki said. \u201cI think people are being insensitive because they simply don\u2019t understand. They think eating disorders are a choice when they are actually a serious illness. \u201d Not every student agrees with the school\u2019s move. Marko Miljusevic, a   computer science student, said people should take responsibility for themselves. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t remove something because some people abuse it,\u201d he said in a post on the school\u2019s Facebook page. \u201cIf they can\u2019t handle the number that shows up on the scale then don\u2019t step on it. \u201d Doctors say that a person\u2019s true weight is best measured in the morning after waking up and before eating breakfast. But, they also warn that fluctuations of several pounds from day to day is nothing to be concerned over. Many doctors also suggest that people trying to improve their health with diet and exercise should weigh themselves only a few times a week.
