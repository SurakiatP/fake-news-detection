Tom Ridge says Congress must pass a pending bill to close the shipping loophole allowing Chinese companies to sell lethal opioids to distributors in U. S. neighborhoods. [\u201cWe worry about weapons of mass destruction,\u201d he told Breitbart News. \u201cBut I think 30 pounds of fentanyl in the wrong hands is a weapon of mass destruction. \u201d  In 2014, roughly 47, 000 in the U. S. died from drug overdoses, especially from heroin and other opiates. Heroin overdose deaths more than tripled between 2010 and 2015. The bill, titled the Synthetics Trafficking and Overdose Prevention, or the \u201cSTOP Act,\u201d is being championed by Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman. Ridge, a senior advisor with the   group \u201cAmericans for Securing All Packages\u201d (ASAP) is working to halt the spread of the deadly opioid epidemic ravaging American families. Fentanyl is usually 50 to 100 times stronger than heroin \u2014  dousing the body\u2019s opioid receptors in the brain stem, spine, and gut all at once, obliterating pain and potentially triggering an overdose. One quarter of a milligram of fentanyl can kill a person. As Breitbart News reported,   deaths rose a staggering 72 percent from 2014 to 2015, with 9, 580 dying from overdoses in 2015 compared to 5, 544 in 2014. The U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grimly noted in a January report that half a million people died from drug overdoses between 2000 and 2014. \u201cIt\u2019s been an issue that\u2019s growing in severity for the past two or three years,\u201d said Ridge. \u201cSometimes these problems have to rise to an extreme level before people start paying attention to it, although I think you started paying attention to it some time ago,\u201d Ridge, who also served as the first Secretary of Homeland Security, told Breitbart News. \u201cClearly, President Trump started paying attention to it during the primary. \u201d \u201cI think he\u2019s one of a couple candidates in New Hampshire who spoke specifically about the postal loophole, which has turned out to be a   front door to illicit drug trafficking, primarily from China,\u201d Ridge continued. During a New Hampshire campaign stop in early October 2016, Trump promised he would protect Americans from a massive influx of deadly, illicit narcotics \u201cpoisoning our youth. \u201d The Granite State \u201cwas really the first glimpse I got at how serious a problem we have,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019re poisoning our youth. They\u2019re poisoning more than our youth \u2014  they\u2019re poisoning everybody. But they\u2019re poisoning our youth. It\u2019s tough enough out there. Our youth doesn\u2019t have a chance with what\u2019s happening, and we\u2019re not going to let it happen anymore,\u201d Trump had said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to help the people that are so badly addicted. We\u2019re going to help them  \u2026     I\u2019m going to stop the drugs from coming in. \u201d Ridge wants to continue the battle against the opioid influx. \u201cI am hopeful that, one, we continue to raise awareness \u2014  that\u2019s what we do at ASAP \u2014  and that, two, in a town looking for some bipartisan work to do together, that they follow the president\u2019s lead, close the loophole, and support the STOP Act which has bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate,\u201d Ridge said. Asked what the U. S. could do to halt Chinese businesses from openly advertising that they are \u201chappy to sell\u201d opioids so powerful that they are considered chemical weapons to U. S. buyers, Ridge said the STOP Act would at least allow officials to inspect such packages. \u201cThe STOP Act does not pretend \u2014  does not suggest that it will eliminate, completely, the flow of illicit fentanyl from China or elsewhere,\u201d Ridge said. \u201cBut China, according to the DEA and multiple sources, is the primary source. So we\u2019ve got pretty much the crosshairs on that as the   source. And the fact is that, if we can just get them to provide the electronic data as to who the sender is, who\u2019s to receive it, what\u2019s contained, what\u2019s the way \u2014  you know, we\u2019ve built some pretty sophisticated algorithms over the years that would at least give Customs and Border Protection enough information to question the contents to pull it aside and open it up for inspection. \u201d From the Associated Press: \u201cIn this Aug. 9, 2016, file photo, a bag of   isobutyryl fentanyl which was seized in a drug raid is displayed at the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Special Testing and Research Laboratory in Sterling, Va. Acting United States DEA administrator Chuck Rosenberg will visit China next week amid efforts to cut off the Chinese supply of deadly synthetic drugs, like fentanyl. China disputes U. S. claims that it\u2019s the top source of opioids. Still, Beijing has already banned fentanyl, an opioid some 50 times stronger than heroin, and 18 related compounds. \u201d (AP   Owen, File) \u201cThat\u2019s what the STOP Act does,\u201d Ridge explained. \u201cIt\u2019s not designed to end the flow. I think one of the issues that the State Department\u2019s got to deal with, the ambassador\u2019s got to deal with, is much stronger diplomatic position in time. And frankly, I\u2019d think it would be helpful to the diplomatic work that we have to do with China and other countries if [we] had bipartisan legislation that was passed and signed into law by the president. \u201d The   epidemic has caught attention from Democratic politicians as well. Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill recently opened an investigation into pharmaceutical companies\u2019 records inquiring about the drugs\u2019 addictive qualities and the relation to marketing campaigns. It should be noted that it may only take seven days to become addicted to opioids, according to the Utah Department of Health. One week of taking narcotic painkillers can suddenly deliver someone into a lifetime of addiction, or what\u2019s left of it \u2014  before too many of   morphine molecules bind with opioid receptors in the brain stem and shut down the user\u2019s ability to draw their next breath. Of course, heroin addiction can slowly consume one before one realizes it has, as one user explained: I have literally never met anyone who was introduced to heroin with a needle. That\u2019s roughly the equivalent of taking your first drink of alcohol by   moonshine out of a gas can. The reality is a lot less abrupt, and a lot scarier: Most people start by popping and smoking pills. In that stage, it never seems like a problem, because you can use daily for weeks with no withdrawal effects whatsoever. \u201cOnce you\u2019re at the stage where you\u2019re even considering the needle, you long ago forgot about \u2018squeamishness\u2019 right along with \u2018work\u2019 and \u2018everything else you ever wanted to accomplish in your life,\u2019\u201d the former user added. Breitbart News also asked Ridge what he would say to American families ravaged by opioid addiction. \u201cWell, I\u2019m glad you said \u2014  you phrased it the right way,\u201d Ridge sighed. \u201cBecause you may have someone in your family that\u2019s addicted. You may have an individual that\u2019s addicted, but it affects the family, friends of the family, and the broader community. \u201d From the Associated Press: \u201cIn this Wednesday, Sept. 2, 2015, photo, Dorothy McIntosh Shuemake, mother of Alison Shuemake, cries as she clutches her daughter\u2019s toy stuffed rabbit during an interview at her home, in Middletown, Ohio. Alison Shuemake, 18, died Aug. 26, after a suspected heroin overdose when she and her partner were found unresponsive at their home and needles were present nearby. \u201d (AP   Minchillo) \u201cAnd so, I think what we need to say to the families of those who are addicted to this \u2014  and remember, we\u2019ve got \u2014  alcohol addiction is a huge problem,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd more often than not, unless there\u2019s family intervention, it\u2019s a   trip to oblivion. And I think it\u2019s also like mental health problems. The stigma of addiction, and the stigma associated with mental health problems \u2014  we should be more tolerant in a society to accept the reality that as humans, we\u2019re flawed, but these things do happen from time to time. \u201d Federal data shows that \u201cdeaths of despair,\u201d particularly among   white Americans, have risen starkly in less than two decades, as researchers Angus Deaton and Anne Case told NPR earlier in March. Whites are steadily poisoning themselves with opioids and lethal amounts of alcohol, and are committing suicide in disturbing numbers.   whites account for   of all U. S. suicides. The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention found that seven out of every 10 suicides were committed by white men in 2015.   Ridge said that communities must come together and help families hurt by addiction. \u201cAnd so, as a broader community, we need to appreciate the horror that the family deals with, if they have a family member who\u2019s addicted right now,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, frankly, to look for ways to provide as much support and treatment as possible. \u201d \u201cBut I know it might be somewhat simplistic, but I know families  \u2026     where there\u2019s been addiction to drugs and alcohol,\u201d Ridge said. \u201cSometimes, that intersession \u2014  and [getting] them to remediation \u2014  and get them to care, works. And sometimes it doesn\u2019t. \u201d From Getty: \u201cWASHINGTON, DC  \u2014   SEPTEMBER 18: Activists and family members of loved ones who died in the   epidemic take part in a \u2018Fed Up!\u2019 rally at Capitol Hill on September 18, 2016 in Washington, DC. Protesters called on legislators to provide funding for the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, which Congress passed in July without funding. Some 30, 000 Americans die each year due to heroin and painkiller pill addiction in the United States. \u201d (Getty Images) \u201cAnd what do you say to the families?\u201d Ridge asked again. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to live with that in your family. And I think I understand that as an observer. I\u2019m sure it breaks your heart, and for many people, it may break the bank as they\u2019re trying to deal with it. But I would just encourage them to do everything they can to get the loved one that\u2019s addicted, get them as much help as soon as possible. There has to be intervention. \u201d Breitbart News also asked Ridge whether the Trump administration\u2019s   strategy of cracking down on drug traffickers while expanding treatment options for those addicted to deadly drugs is effective. Ridge said it was: \u201cI think it\u2019s the right strategy. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s supply and demand,\u201d he explained. \u201cSupply: you go after those who push out the subscription \u2014  the docs that  . You go after the labs. You go after the foreign sources. You go after the supply. \u201d \u201cOn the demand side? You have to intervene,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou have to try to help. You have to try to rehabilitate. And some of these efforts are going to be successful \u2014  some are not. But simply talking about supply isn\u2019t enough. And so, any effort that the government, both the state and the federal government, can do to support families and to support the kind of medical, necessary intervention \u2014  I think it\u2019s critically important. You have to have to have it. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a supply and demand problem. You have to attack both,\u201d he added. Ridge also added that a suspect in New Jersey had been arrested with 30 pounds of fentanyl. \u201cWe worry about weapons of mass destruction,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think 30 pounds of fentanyl in the wrong hands is a weapon of mass destruction. \u201d Ridge pointed to a Breitbart News story explaining that more Americans had died from opioid overdoses in 2015 than they did of gun violence: \u201cIt\u2019s about time we got serious. So, yes, the question of supply, yeah, let\u2019s cut it off and demand \u2014  let\u2019s try to get some intervention and reduce the demand. \u201d According to the CDC, \u201cprescription opioids in the U. S. nearly quadrupled from 1999 to 2014,\u201d although a former federal prosecutor claimed painkiller and heroin addictions should be classified as \u201cdistinct\u201d from one another. An Associated Press report revealed that drug wholesalers shipped roughly 780 million prescription painkiller pills to West Virginia alone in only six years, or 433 pills for every man, woman, and child in that state. The report also stated 1, 728 West Virginians fatally overdosed on painkilling pills in those six years. \u201cDistributors have fed their greed on human frailties and to criminal effect. There is no excuse and should be no forgiveness,\u201d a former pharmacist said about the painkillers\u2019 death toll. President Trump\u2019s budget blueprint pledged to commit some $675 million to combat drug trafficking, help lift opioid abusers out of addiction, and prevent more Americans from succumbing to the the narcotics epidemic.'"}, "time": 1742563502.5626364}
