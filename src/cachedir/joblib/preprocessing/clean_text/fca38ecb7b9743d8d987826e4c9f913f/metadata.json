[Pollak told SiriusXM host Alex Marlow he chose the title for the book after the election was settled because he originally thought Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign \u201cwas going to be a spectacular defeat  \u2014   not necessarily a big defeat, but definitely one worth writing about. \u201d  \u201cI think the frame of mind that I was in was concern about what was going to happen to conservatism after Trump lost,\u201d he revealed,\u201cthat there was so much infighting, that there had been a kind of civil war in the GOP, that all the knives were out  \u2014   for you and me in particular, but for other people, as well, once this election was over. And so I started working on this, I pitched it to various people who I knew had an interest in publishing something, and started writing it with a view to trying to frame the debate after the election. \u201d \u201cI knew Trump could win. I was one of the few people on that traveling press corps plane who thought he could still win. But I didn\u2019t think it was likely, and so I wanted to make sure that the whole conservative movement didn\u2019t collapse into infighting, and I wanted to try to frame what his defeat would mean so that going forward, there would be something productive and positive to do,\u201d he said. \u201cLarry Schweikart, my   was quite the opposite. He had predicted in August 2015 that Trump would not only win the nomination, but would win the election,\u201d Pollak recalled. \u201cSo there\u2019s a healthy tension there in the book. \u201d \u201cLarry had data that few other people had, and he talks about that data in the book,\u201d he said. \u201cHe had people, for example, in various counties that were crucial to the outcome of the election tracking voter registration numbers. He knew that a large number of people in Ohio, for example, had switched their voter registration from Democratic to Republican, and he knew that coming out of certain parts of Ohio, coming out of Cleveland, for example, Democrats needed to have a certain advantage to balance out the Republican advantage in the rest of the state. And he began to see, very early on, they weren\u2019t going to have that advantage, if people simply voted on partisan lines. \u201d  \u201cSo he got the signal that if Trump managed to dominate the primary, which he did and was doing, he was going to win the election. There were enough people who were disgusted with the Democratic Party, there were enough Democrats willing to make the switch, that if a candidate came along who pitched a message to them, that was going to happen. So he talks about that in the book,\u201d Pollak said. \u201cI had the sense Trump was going to win the nomination only in about December 2015, when I went to my first Trump campaign event and saw with my own eyes this wasn\u2019t a vanity candidacy this wasn\u2019t a kind of joke,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThis was a very real campaign and a real connection with the voters, who clearly felt tied in to what he was saying and doing. \u201d  \u201cThat same visit also told me that the mainstream media had no idea what was going on because I went to a perfectly exciting, warm, fun Trump rally with about 3, 000 people in Nevada, and the next day, I saw it reported as a kind of Nazi   rally by NBC. And that clued me in as to what was going on. I\u2019d never been to an event where the description the day after was more different than the reality on the night of. That just was a cold bucket of water to the face, that this was going to be a campaign unlike any other, and Trump was going to have to go around the media to win,\u201d he said. Pollak testified there were some \u201creally interesting people\u201d in the traveling press corps, \u201csome great people, some professional   people. \u201d \u201cBut generally, the consensus was that Trump didn\u2019t have a chance,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was almost a feeling like, we don\u2019t know why we\u2019re doing this anymore. You\u2019d think the media would have an interest in playing up the contest, that the horse race would be interesting to people, that the drama of an election campaign would motivate people, but I think people were just exhausted. Trump was keeping a really tough pace, and they couldn\u2019t really see the point of it all. \u201d  He summed up the Trump press corps mindset as, \u201cWhy is he spending all this time on the road? Why are we doing seven states in one day? What\u2019s the point? He\u2019s not going to win, this is pointless, and the only way it\u2019s interesting to us is to pick out little things he does that are weird, zany, unusual, and likely damaging. \u201d  \u201cThey just couldn\u2019t see the    between Trump and the Clinton campaign. I think they just didn\u2019t have a sense that it was going to be fun. That changed a little bit with the Comey announcement, which I saw in New Hampshire  . It was more of a horse race. The media perked up a little bit,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what was really interesting to me was that even though you might think commercially it was in their interest to play up the chance that Trump might win, they really seemed to have no interest in it, and no belief that he could,\u201d Pollak said. \u201cAnd so it was kind of almost a death march through all these different campaign rallies and stops in different states. I just don\u2019t think they thought it possible, and some certainly were completely dismissive and mocking of him. \u201d He said one of the most surprising things he discovered on the Trump campaign trail was \u201cjust how determined the audiences were to vote for this man, to crawl over broken glass to vote for him, as our colleague John Nolte likes to say. \u201d He cited a rally in Virginia that had been scheduled to start at 9:30 p. m. on the Sunday before Election Day: \u201cTrump had scheduled a lot of different events, and there was a large amount of traffic in one city because the police couldn\u2019t clear the entire highway and so forth. In any event, the rally didn\u2019t happen at 9:30 p. m. It happened at 12:30 a. m. in Virginia, the next morning. This is on a Sunday night into a Monday morning. It\u2019s a school night. There are families there. We get there, thousands of people not only inside the hall, but outside, in the cold, young children with their parents, sleeping almost on their parents\u2019 shoulders, waiting to see Donald Trump. Nobody had gone home! People had stayed there, and they were determined to be there. And when I asked people why they were there, they said, \u2018We\u2019re here to be a part of history. \u2019\u201d \u201cTo the people in those audiences, there was no doubt that Trump was going to win,\u201d Pollak observed. \u201cThey sensed a connection with this candidate that they hadn\u2019t sensed with any other Republican candidate in decades. That felt new enough to them that they were convinced he was going to win. And that was really the first moment where I thought Trump might win, even though I thought the odds were still stacked against him and even though Election Day looked pretty rough until late in the evening. \u201d \u201cThe surprise to me was seeing the determination of the audiences,\u201d he related. \u201cAt another rally in Michigan, I asked two young women why they were there, and they said something which I would hear repeated by others, which is: \u2018He doesn\u2019t have to be doing this for us, and we\u2019re here because he loves us\u2019  \u2014   which is odd, and it\u2019s always strange as a journalist to hear that from people because you have something of a critical distance. \u201d  \u201cEven though we\u2019re a conservative website, and we were more on the side of Trump, obviously, than the side of Clinton, you feel some kind of connection to what\u2019s going on,\u201d Pollak explained. \u201cYou never really get to that level of emotional investment. But people felt that because he had given up his Hollywood career, because he had suffered personal damage, because he had taken a hit in his businesses, he was sacrificing for them. That moved them to come out for him. And that was something I don\u2019t think people really picked up on. That was surprising and I think part of the secret of why Trump actually won. \u201d Marlow asked Pollak for his list of the major storylines heading into Trump\u2019s inauguration on Friday. \u201cI think there are three main storylines,\u201d Pollak replied. \u201cThe first is the outgoing administration, the Obama administration, casting doubt on Trump\u2019s legitimacy. You\u2019ll notice on Sunday, Meet the Press, Obama\u2019s chief of staff would not say that Trump was legitimate. They said \u2018freely elected,\u2019 but they didn\u2019t say \u2018legitimate\u2019 because they\u2019re riding this Russian hacking conspiracy theory. They\u2019re saying what John Lewis is saying. It makes me think that John Lewis is, in some ways, a surrogate for the administration. \u201d  \u201cThey\u2019re talking about what a great job they\u2019re doing in the transition, while they\u2019re totally undermining the premise of the transition. So I think the Obama administration is going out on a really sour note. That\u2019s one storyline,\u201d he said. \u201cAnother storyline is the inauguration itself and the protests that are going to be there,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe day after, there\u2019s going to be quite a bit of protests. The security services, the officials are preparing for that. But there\u2019s a certain amount of unknown. We just don\u2019t know how many people. We don\u2019t know exactly what they\u2019re going to do. James O\u2019Keefe has been releasing videos about the inside planning that\u2019s going on at some of these events, so we\u2019re starting to lift the veil on that a little bit. That\u2019s another uncertain element. And we know that MoveOn. org and other   groups are planning nationwide protests on Inauguration Day and thereafter, so that\u2019s another storyline, how the Left is trying to regroup. \u201d \u201cAnd then the third storyline is the storyline about the Trump administration itself and how it\u2019s going to start,\u201d Pollak concluded. \u201cThis is now real. This is happening. He\u2019s going to be President Trump on Friday. And he is beginning to unroll his agenda. We\u2019re seeing some policies beginning to take shape. We\u2019re seeing some very interesting clashes with Congress. \u201d \u201cI think one of the more interesting elements of the Trump presidency is that the leading opposition force right now, at least, is going to be the conservatives in Congress, not Democrats,\u201d he contended. \u201cDemocrats are busy whining about Russian hacking, and about John Lewis, and about deplorables and the   or whatever. They\u2019re still reliving the election and trying to undermine it. They haven\u2019t yet connected with the fact that they lost for a reason. It wasn\u2019t just that Trump won. It\u2019s also that they completely lost touch with their voters, with their issues, and they haven\u2019t pulled that together yet. \u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s the conservatives in Congress who are putting forward policies that Trump is agreeing with in many cases, disagreeing with in some cases  \u2014   the fight right now with Paul Ryan over taxation. It\u2019s going to be interesting to see the two sides hammer that out,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re a conservative, this is the kind of debate you want to see. You want to see a debate between alternate versions of conservatism. You don\u2019t want to see a debate where conservatives always have to compromise with the far Left. So it\u2019s an encouraging, positive sign if you\u2019re a conservative, watching the administration in its first few days. \u201d Marlow noted that the media praised Obama for putting together a    cabinet that didn\u2019t agree on everything, while Trump\u2019s transition has been portrayed as disastrous because he did the same thing with    nominees. Pollak noted the media believe it has \u201ca civic duty to oppose the Trump administration,\u201d which is very different from the supportive role it saw for itself with Obama. \u201cThey believed the same thing during the campaign. It was their job to protect America from this Republican nominee,\u201d he argued. \u201cThey failed at that job. Now they\u2019re trying to set themselves up as the political opposition. There\u2019s an element of that in the media\u2019s role that is appropriate. I think where it starts to blend into inappropriate is where they\u2019re starting to make very biased assessments against Trump that they didn\u2019t make against Obama. \u201d He added to Marlow\u2019s point about the transition that Obama was actually compared to Abraham Lincoln for assembling his \u201cteam of rivals,\u201d even though he was   to remember when \u201ca member of Obama\u2019s cabinet actually dissented about anything. \u201d As he recalled, the few officials who might have disagreed with President Obama about anything of importance left early in his first term, under somewhat cloudy circumstances. If anything, Obama\u2019s cabinet was even less concerned with vibrant diversity of opinion than Bill Clinton\u2019s, which saw the occasional public spat, and even resignations, over policy differences. Pollak suggested this lack of actual intellectual diversity in the Obama administration planted the seed of Hillary Clinton\u2019s downfall, since she had great difficulty running as anything other than Barack Obama\u2019s third term  \u2014   something Americans clearly did not want. \u201cTrump really has appointed people with very different views, compared to what his views are presumed to be,\u201d he said. \u201cWe saw that with some of the questions in the confirmation hearings about waterboarding. We saw it about Russia policy. I\u2019m not so sure Russia policy is an area where Trump has a completely defined view, by the way, so I don\u2019t think that clash is particularly set. \u201d  \u201cBut nevertheless, he has said openly he welcomes this exchange of views. He welcomes people with different views. That\u2019s the sign of a person who has led organizations before, who is confident in having people with different opinions around the table, who\u2019s also confident in his own ability to make the choice between those opinions, between different courses of action,\u201d Pollak proposed. \u201cIt says something about his nominees, as well, that they are prepared to come into an administration knowing they may disagree on one or two points, but knowing that they have something to contribute nonetheless, and their job is to advocate for their point of view and to work together as a team if they decide to take, collectively, a different course,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I think it\u2019s a very encouraging sign. The media say it\u2019s some kind of sign of incompetence  \u2014   did Trump not know these people had these views? Or maybe Trump just doesn\u2019t care. It\u2019s always given a negative spin,\u201d he observed, regretfully noting the media seemed to have learned nothing from its experiences on the 2016 campaign trail. Marlow argued that Trump has already done \u201ca tremendous amount of good in putting the global elite on notice,\u201d even though he has not been sworn in yet, citing the collapse of the planned   policy summit in Paris this week as an example. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d Pollak agreed. \u201cBut I also think it\u2019s the inevitable result of the rest of the world coming to grips with the reality of what\u2019s happening on Friday, to an extent that Democrats haven\u2019t yet done. \u201d He suggested the political fallout from \u201cthat U. N. Security Council resolution that Obama pushed, where all of the other countries on the Security Council also supported this resolution, and the reaction from the Trump administration was quite stern\u201d might have   the Left\u2019s   realization that the Obama era is over. \u201cIt was clear that this was not acceptable to the incoming administration. This approach to Israel was done, it was over, and there was going to be a radical shift towards a   stance, towards a strong U. S.  relationship, and away from the confrontation that Obama had sought, when he wanted to put distance between the U. S. and Israel,\u201d Pollak noted.  \u201cThat\u2019s why I think you already saw the U. K. walking back some of its statements. You saw Australia criticizing the U. N. Security Council. When John Kerry gave that speech at the State Department attacking the Israeli government, saying it was the most   government and everything, Prime Minister Teresa May of the United Kingdom said we don\u2019t do that we don\u2019t criticize the composition of other democratic countries. And she rebuked John Kerry. And so I think people understood there was a new sheriff coming to town,\u201d he said.  \u201cI think the original plan for the Paris conference, by the French and by Obama, had been to use that as a springboard for some kind of declaration of Palestinian statehood in the days before Obama leaves office,\u201d he speculated. \u201cWho knows? He\u2019s got 72 hours or so left we\u2019ll see what damage he can do. But I think that the reaction of the Trump transition team, and the   to what happened at the U. N. put the rest of the world on notice that we are not going to continue Obama\u2019s foreign policy. Not just with regard to the great powers, China and Russia and so forth, but we\u2019re also going to make a break with the way he handled the   conflict. Trump talks about negotiation and that sort of thing, but he wants to make clear that the U. S. is a strong ally of Israel  \u2014   and not, as Obama did, make clear the opposite. \u201d Marlow turned back to the earlier discussion of how Democrats are challenging Trump\u2019s legitimacy by playing a clip of Senator Marco Rubio ( ) essentially endorsing Rep. John Lewis\u2019 moral authority. He asked why so many Republicans are still willing to fight under the Democrats\u2019 rules of engagement. Pollak responded by quoting another of Trump\u2019s rivals from the Republican primary, Senator Rand Paul ( ) who declared that he was capable of disagreeing with Rep. Lewis today without opposing the civil rights movement. \u201cThis is a conflation even the media don\u2019t believe, but they\u2019ve set it up this way,\u201d he argued. \u201cJohn Lewis has a track record, unfortunately, over the last ten years or so, of making these kinds of accusations, false accusations of racism against Republicans. He did it to John McCain. He did it in a more subtle way when Mitt Romney was running for president. Now, he\u2019s doing it to Donald Trump. Eventually, you have to be called out on what you\u2019re doing, and that\u2019s legitimate to do. John Lewis is exploiting the civil rights struggle in a negative way. You could even say he\u2019s demeaning it, by bringing it into this very partisan debate, the idea that the election was illegitimate. \u201d  \u201cWhat John Lewis is basically doing is disenfranchising the millions of voters who voted for Donald Trump, by saying that their vote didn\u2019t count, that they were part of some Russian conspiracy,\u201d Pollak charged. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s the irony, that the civil rights movement is about marching for the right to vote, and here you are telling people that their votes don\u2019t matter, that they\u2019re part of some nefarious foreign plot. To me, that\u2019s an irony for which John Lewis has to answer. \u201d He denounced Lewis\u2019 tactics as an example of \u201cpolitics distorting history,\u201d given the implication that Trump is somehow worse than the racists who physically assaulted Lewis during the civil rights era and whom he forgave. As Pollak put it, Lewis is effectively stating he\u2019s \u201cnot even willing to reconcile with the guy who had nothing to do with Jim Crow  \u2014   and, in fact, for most of his life, Donald Trump was a Democrat, often seen in the company of Jesse Jackson and other people in the civil rights tableaux in New York City and urban America. \u201d \u201cNow, I think John Lewis has made positive contributions,\u201d he added. \u201cI actually remember writing John Lewis a letter about a year ago because he spoke at my wife\u2019s graduation. I expected him to give a very partisan address, and he didn\u2019t. He gave a very nonpartisan,     speech, and I wrote to him to say how impressed I was with the speech. I think you\u2019ve got to reward these politicians when they do the right thing. But he is clearly not doing the right thing. \u201d As for Senator Rubio, Pollak suggested he is \u201ctrying to find his way\u201d and \u201cjockeying for a position among the leading voices in opposition, sort of conservative opposition, in Congress to Donald Trump. \u201d \u201cThere are some positive things in that. What\u2019s missing, weirdly, from Rubio\u2019s statement there and other issues is the sort of peppy joyfulness, the kind of optimism you associated once with Marco Rubio\u2019s speaking style,\u201d he lamented. \u201cHe seems very stern, very severe, sort of talking over the national anthem in the background. I mean, it\u2019s just sort of weird. I don\u2019t know where Rubio\u2019s head is. \u201d Pollak ventured that it was unwise for a Republican with White House aspirations, such as Rubio, to give any degree of support to tactics that will be turned against him, should he realize his ambition to succeed President Trump. He also wondered if those tactics were going to pay off for Democrats, as they have done in the past, since they\u2019ve made a habit of attacking voters, not just opposition political figures.  \u201cThey\u2019re not reaching out to those Obama voters in Pennsylvania and Michigan who switched their vote to Trump,\u201d Pollak observed. \u201cThey\u2019re not reaching out to them and saying, \u2018Hey, we need to get back in touch with you. We need to understand your issues. You used to vote for us, you voted the other way this time. We need to figure that out and   a relationship with you.\u2019 No, what they\u2019re telling those people is, \u2018You\u2019re part of a Russian conspiracy. \u2019\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s almost like back to the fifties and the McCarthy era, basically saying this is a Communist plot against the United States. Donald Trump is a Manchurian candidate who\u2019s sent by the Kremlin to take over America,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s so ridiculously outlandish. It\u2019s like birtherism elevated to a national political platform. Donald Trump pulled some shenanigans when he was going up against Barack Obama in 2011, 2012, we all know that, but a lot of that washed out by the time the presidential campaign happened, and he\u2019s not doing that any more. Republicans as a whole never did that. Democrats are going down this really weird road, and it\u2019s going to isolate them further from their own voters in the end,\u201d he predicted. Pollak contended that the strength of the civil rights movement came from its unifying nature, as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. \u201csucceeded by reaching out to what Americans held in common and refocusing it in a direction that he wanted to take the country. \u201d He noted that modern problems, such as persistent poverty, could only be solved through inclusive efforts, not by framing it as \u201ca struggle by one group of Americans against another,\u201d as today\u2019s Left prefers. \u201cOne thing we forget about the civil rights struggle was how much faith was a part of it, how much religion, how much the Christian tradition was really brought to bear, and Americans were challenged to live up to it,\u201d he added. \u201cYou don\u2019t hear that when John Lewis is challenging Donald Trump and saying he wouldn\u2019t invite him to Selma. I mean, that\u2019s just silly. \u201d  \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s statement that Lewis was \u2018all talk and no action,\u2019 I think, in a way, hit the nail on the head because he\u2019s not talking about the civil rights movement. He\u2019s talking about what Lewis is doing in politics today,\u201d Pollak argued.  He ran through the list of questions that flowed naturally from Trump\u2019s response to Lewis: \u201cWhat is John Lewis doing for his district? What is John Lewis doing for these problems of poverty in America? What are the Democrats doing? They\u2019ve been in the minority now for six years, in the House. Have they achieved anything? What are they doing other than politics? What are they doing other than trying to take control again? Are they actually making any progress on those issues that they talk about every two years, around election time?\u201d  \u201cI think that\u2019s the challenge that John Lewis has to face, and I think every congressman has to face, but especially John Lewis. People who are elected to where they are partly because of who they are, partly because of their history, have a special burden to live up to that. Trump is saying, \u2018Okay, well, where is it? What are you doing? Is this just about setting yourself up as a partisan every time somebody wants to attack the Republican Party, and you use the civil rights history  \u2014   which, by the way, Republicans were much more on the side of civil rights than Democrats. The civil rights movement was largely a struggle against southern Democrats,\u201d he noted. \u201cIs that what you\u2019re going to do  \u2014   you\u2019re going to just use this as a partisan hatchet every time? Or are you actually going to do something? I think that was a very appropriate challenge,\u201d Pollak declared.
