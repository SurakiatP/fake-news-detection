Luis Gutierrez (  ) made the rounds on MSBNC and CNN, dismissing President Donald Trump\u2019s offer to help Chicago end gun violence, and blaming the NRA for the death and mayhem currently marring the Windy City. [Gutierrez was reacting to Trump\u2019s description of the \u201ccarnage\u201d in Chicago and his pledge to intervene federally if city leaders fail to stop the violence. On January 24 Trump tweeted:  If Chicago doesn\u2019t fix the horrible \u201dcarnage\u201d going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016) I will send in the Feds!  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017,  The following day, Gutierrez appeared on All In With Chris Hayes and said, \u201c[President Trump] tweets about the \u201ccarnage\u201d and that he\u2019s going to send the feds in. Did he send any extra money for police officers? We could use that, for training. \u201d He noted that Trump is increasing the number of Border Patrol agents on the southern border and said Chicago would like to have more federal agents \u2014  ATF and FBI \u2014  in the city as well. Then Gutierrez said: But  \u2026    [President Trump is] with the NRA. The NRA that endorsed him, [that is]  \u2026    so part of his relationship. You know that NRA did? It crippled the laws of the city of Chicago and the courts, so that we cannot keep guns off our streets. The next day Gutierrez appeared on CNN, where he was again asked about Trump\u2019s \u201ccarnage\u201d assessment and his pledge to send in the feds if Chicago city leaders fail to end the violence. Gutierrez said: Here\u2019s the hypocrisy of it all. The fact is, Donald Trump loves the NRA. And during his campaign he embraced them and they embraced him. The city of Chicago had some of the most stringent gun control laws, how were they eviscerated? Because the NRA funded lawsuits against our gun control measures. Gutierrez ignores the fact that Chicago had some its highest annual murder rates while all the city\u2019s gun controls were place. For example, the Chicago Police Department reports 921 murders during 1991, 940 during 1992. 850 during 2993, and 930 during 1994. These excessively high murder numbers all occurred while Chicago\u2019s ban on handgun ownership was in place. Viewed in this light, the 762 murders CNN reported for 2016 were a far cry from some of the murder numbers witnessed while Chicago\u2019s most \u201cstringent gun controls\u201d were in effect.
