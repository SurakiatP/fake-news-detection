He was appearing at Techonomy\u2019s annual retreat, a meeting of thought leaders in the worlds of technology, government, academia and business, and he was responding to a common criticism  \u2014   the notion that Trump\u2019s unconventional path to victory had benefited from a detour through Facebook, where a \u201cfilter bubble\u201d distorts the flow of information and fake news stories loom large. \u201cThere is a certain profound lack of empathy,\u201d he said, \u201cin asserting that the only reason why someone could have voted the way they did is because they saw some fake news. If you believe that, then I don\u2019t think you have internalized the message that Trump supporters are trying to send in this election. \u201d When asked to articulate that message, he dodged the question. \u201cEmpathy\u201d is one of Facebook\u2019s   favorite buzzwords. For years, Zuckerberg has hopped from conference to conference in a selection of muted hoodies and   delivering variations on the same pitch. \u201cMore people are using Facebook to share more stuff,\u201d he said in 2010. \u201cThat means that if we want, there\u2019s more out there that we can go look at and research and understand what\u2019s going on with the people around us. And I just think that leads to broader empathy, understanding  \u2014   just a lot of good, core, human things that make society function better. \u201d If you think Facebook may have had a hand in tipping popular opinion toward Trump, Zuckerberg seemed to suggest at the Ritz, then something was wrong with you  \u2014   something that could be fixed by spending more time on Facebook. He is not the only one shopping empathy as a cure for what ails us. In recent months, the Inspired Life blog of The Washington Post suggested \u201cempathy for Trump voters. \u201d In a Times   article, Glenn Beck wrote, \u201cWouldn\u2019t we all benefit from trying to empathize with people we disagree with?\u201d It all feels like a bit of a throwback: Just as many of our modern, scientific mechanisms for gauging the national mood  \u2014   things like   polling and data journalism  \u2014   failed to predict Trump\u2019s victory, there has been a call for Americans to reach out and touch one another more directly. But there is a curiously strategic underpinning to these calls for empathy, too. Empathy, after all, is not sympathy. Sympathy encourages a close affinity with other people: You feel their pain. Empathy suggests something more technical  \u2014   a dispassionate approach to understanding the emotions of others. And these days, it often seems to mean understanding their pain just enough to get something out of it  \u2014   to manipulate political, technological and consumerist outcomes in our own favor. \u201cEmpathy\u201d first arose to explain our relationship to objects, not to other human beings. The word comes from the German einf\u00fchlung (ein for \u201cin\u201d and f\u00fchlung for \u201cfeeling\u201d) a concept in   aesthetics. Einf\u00fchlung described the act of \u201cfeeling into\u201d art and nature, or projecting yourself into an aesthetic object. Soon \u201cempathy\u201d came to describe how human beings related to one another as objects: Like modern neuroscience, it looked for the roots of human emotions in \u201cthe material body and the interworking of its parts,\u201d in the study of \u201cmuscles and nerves. \u201d This turn toward \u201cempathy\u201d let people cast off the cultural baggage of \u201csympathy,\u201d a word suddenly seen as soaked in sentimentality, tied up with ideas of Christian virtue, moral obligation and pity. The Indiana University professor Rae Greiner, author of a book about sympathy in   fiction, has written that by the dawn of the 20th century, \u201csympathy seemed to belong to the Victorians, empathy to us. \u201d A century later, the rise of social networking means our interactions are once again mediated through our relationship with objects. The theorist Marshall McLuhan once assumed this computerization of culture would lead to a rise in empathetic connection. \u201cThe aspiration of our time for wholeness, empathy and depth of awareness is a natural adjunct of electric technology,\u201d he wrote in \u201cUnderstanding Media,\u201d published in 1964 the computer promised a \u201cPentecostal condition of universal understanding and unity. \u201d But it wound up offering something else too: a convenient alternative to costly, messy interactions with human beings. What social networks like Facebook really offer is empathy in the aggregate  \u2014   an illusion of having captured the mood of entire families and friend networks from a safe, neutral distance. Then they turn around and offer advertisers a read on more than a billion users at once. Buzz Andersen  \u2014   a tech veteran who has worked for Apple, Tumblr and Square  \u2014   told me that in Silicon Valley, \u201cempathy is basically a more   way of saying \u2018market research. \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d And in a marketplace, you\u2019re not trying to understand other people out of altruism or moral responsibility you\u2019re doing it out of  . In the days after the election, many commenters chafed at the idea that they ought to perform the work of empathizing with Trump\u2019s supporters. Shouldn\u2019t they  \u2014   the people who elected him  \u2014   try a little empathy for the lives that stand to be crushed by his policies? The market\u2019s answer to this question is \u201cno. \u201d There is no movement for   Americans to be more empathetic because they won. The nation has already bought what they were selling. The call for   to cultivate empathy isn\u2019t about finding instructive truths in others\u2019 worldviews it\u2019s about understanding their motivations well enough to persuade them to vote differently. Empathy is naturally irrational, cautions the Yale psychology professor Paul Bloom, author of a new book titled \u201cAgainst Empathy: The Case for Rational Compassion. \u201d It\u2019s more likely to activate in the face of one sad story than on the scale of widespread human tragedy. It\u2019s manipulative too: Directing a crowd\u2019s empathy toward one victim can cultivate anger and aggression toward other targets, even if they\u2019re not responsible for the victim\u2019s suffering. In a case like Zuckerberg\u2019s, empathy can be a strategy for avoiding responsibility. On a recent rainy day, I left my office to see empathy leveraged in yet another way. Upworthy, a purveyor of   viral content, had constructed a   \u201cempathy lab\u201d in a nearby park. A black curtain was pulled around a chair and a computer outfitted with software that could map the face at 500 points and analyze its emotional expressions. Participants watched a video  \u2014   in my case, a short clip about a young boy with Down syndrome. Outside, a crowd watched a Jumbotron, on which squiggly lines tracked the participant\u2019s empathetic expressions against the average reaction. At the video\u2019s conclusion, an \u201cempathy score\u201d flashed on the screen. Upworthy is invested in empathy because it has found that emotionally engaging content shares well on Facebook  \u2014   but also, its reps say, because it can prompt   action. Upworthy\u2019s business model relies mainly on the former. Shortly after I arrived, a woman emerged from behind the curtain to spontaneous applause. She had received an empathy rating of 98  \u2014   the day\u2019s high score. It was an odd image, like Facebook projected into real life: A woman lauded for sitting alone, watching a video. In the Victorian era, some critics worried that moralistic novels would channel people\u2019s sympathy into books instead of out into the world. Facebook takes it a step further, rerouting our attempts at empathetic connection back at us. When we reach out to one another, we\u2019re often just feeling ourselves.'"}, "time": 1742562499.564516}
