The dramatic 9-1-1 recordings were just published, detailing this insane incident that happened back in June. The nightmare began after Andrea Ellis had cut her arm on some glass and her sister dialed 9-1-1 for medical help. \u201cShe\u2019s bleeding all over the place!\u201d her sister said in the call. \u201cI need a paramedic!\u201d As she was on the call, her sister saw a police officer nearby and called him over for help. \u201cSir, can you get me a paramedic?! I need a paramedic here!\u201d she said. According to the report by Inside Edition: But as the cop approached the house , events took a horrific turn. Cops said the family pet \u2013 a boxer terrier mix named Patches, charged at the officer. The cop fired his gun, and the bullet hit Andrea\u2019s four-year-old daughter, Ava, in the leg, shattering the bone. \u201cShe asked me several times, \u2018Mommy, am I gonna die?\u2019\u201d Andrea Ellis told INSIDE EDITION.

Luckily, the bullet didn\u2019t hit Ava a few inches higher in the stomach, which could\u2019ve proved fatal . The shot did, however, shatter her bone. The officer involved has not been disciplined , but the Columbus police department assures the public that the incident is under investigation. Source:'"}, "time": 1742562255.271409}
