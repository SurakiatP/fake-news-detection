Trump unveiled his new online travel booking venture, GoTrump. com, he said in a promotional video in 2006 that customers would \u201clove everything I put on this site. \u201d \u201cThere\u2019s nobody better,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody even close!\u201d A few months later, ground was broken for Trump Tower Tampa, a project he said would \u201credefine both Tampa\u2019s skyline and the market\u2019s expectations of luxurious condominium living. \u201d And when he signed a   deal with the fledgling U. S. Pro Golf Tour that summer to become a partner on a new championship series, he proclaimed that \u201cthere is no doubt the talent level is among the highest in the world. \u201d The travel venture never took off. The tower in Tampa, Fla. was not built. And the golf championships? Mr. Trump withdrew as the tour fell apart. Moving past a disastrous period that led to a loss on paper of more than $900 million  \u2014   possibly freeing him from federal income taxes for years  \u2014   Mr. Trump became a   factory of big ideas, churning out a continual stream of projects and promises. Together, they fed the image of Mr. Trump as an American Midas, the foundation of his argument for why he would make a great president. To see whether the results of these ventures came close to their   billing, The New York Times analyzed scores of Trump business announcements starting a decade ago, including those posted on the Trump Organization\u2019s website and those that have been deleted but live on in web archives. The Times also combed through news reports, his personal financial disclosures and court records interviewed partners and interviewed Mr. Trump himself. Of the roughly 60 endeavors started or promoted by Mr. Trump during the period analyzed, The Times found few that went off without a hitch.   of them never got off the ground or soon petered out. Another third delivered a measure of what was promised  \u2014   buildings were built, courses taught, a product introduced  \u2014   but they also encountered substantial problems, like lawsuits, government investigations, partnership woes or market downturns. The remaining third, while sometimes encountering strife, generally met expectations  \u2014   notably the television show \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d and the purchases of numerous golf courses, including properties near Philadelphia and in the Hudson Valley. In interviews, Mr. Trump disputed some of the characterizations, saying that, among other things, some projects that might appear to be failures were successes, for him at least, because he often made his money upfront, through fees for the use of the Trump name. The bottom line of all the hits and misses, however, is impossible to determine because Mr. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, has not released any tax returns. Regardless of how much money a deal made  \u2014   or did not make  \u2014   one constant through the years is that these ventures were almost always introduced with a certain Trumpian flair: Each would set a \u201cnew standard\u201d or be the \u201cvery, very best. \u201d Jim Dowd, who advised Mr. Trump on public relations and marketing from 2004 to 2010, recalled that Mr. Trump typically took a personal interest in each news release, marking up drafts with a red pen he kept on his desk. \u201cWe would draft a quote for him, but he would always rewrite it, making it much larger than life,\u201d Mr. Dowd said in an interview earlier this year. (Mr. Dowd died last month.) There were some common terms: \u201cHuge, billions  \u2014   those words would have to be in there,\u201d Mr. Dowd said. \u201cDefinitely \u2018unprecedented.\u2019 Definitely \u2018the best of the best. \u2019\u201d For free publicity, Mr. Trump would also schedule news conferences to announce his deals, and he seemed to feast on the attention. \u201cHe was so caught up in the glamour of the press conference and getting the lobby of Trump Tower filled with media,\u201d Mr. Dowd said. \u201cHe would plop down the elevator, do his thing for 35 minutes, and he was pretty much in every media outlet the next day. \u201d Eventually, Mr. Dowd said, the throngs of journalists who attended Mr. Trump\u2019s news conferences waned, as they asked Mr. Dowd, \u201cReally, another one?\u201d Mr. Dowd thought Mr. Trump was putting himself out too often. \u201cHe was doing these all over the world,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was flying to Panama to announce that project. He was flying to Puerto Rico the golf course in Scotland. \u201d Mr. Trump said he recalled those visits fondly, though he demurred when asked if he had been overexposed in his business ventures. \u201cIt\u2019s a big world,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can do a lot of things. \u201d But the reality was that the success of \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d which averaged 21 million viewers weekly when it made its debut in 2004, had given Mr. Trump access to what seemed like an endless flow of business opportunities. There were unrealized real estate developments in Atlanta on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico and in Cap Cana in the Dominican Republic, an \u201celite destination that will be known worldwide in the years to come. \u201d The hotel and golf club in Cap Cana bearing the Trump name, announced almost a decade ago, have not been built, and Mr. Trump ended up suing his partners over licensing fees. There were entertainment endeavors: a concept for a Trump animation series akin to \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d a speaking tour in Australia that was canceled, though Mr. Trump did eventually go there for a round of lucrative speeches and \u201cTrump Tycoon,\u201d a smartphone app that sold for \u201c$2. 99 but the advice is priceless,\u201d as he wrote at the time on Twitter. He said recently that he did not recall the app, which is no longer available. There were scores of   products, with mixed success: vodka magazines suits ties chairs bath towels crystal and perhaps the most famous one, Trump Steaks, sold by Sharper Image and \u201cby far the best tasting, most flavorful beef that you\u2019ll ever eat. \u201d Some live on, but in general, they typically failed to match the initial hype before quietly disappearing. And there was Trump University, a series of real estate seminars that, like many of Mr. Trump\u2019s endeavors, wound up in the courts. Mr. Trump\u2019s name seemed to be just about everywhere. But a close look reveals patterns, particularly before and after the financial crisis of 2008. (The Times did not analyze any projects begun after 2012, because a number of them were too new to evaluate.) Until the crisis, Mr. Trump focused mainly on real estate developments, often mixed   projects. The market downturn thwarted some of those plans, and he began shifting more aggressively to smaller licensing agreements with makers of home products and goods. The Trump Organization accelerated its focus on golf, buying clubs near Philadelphia in Westchester County, N. Y. in Doral, Fla. and elsewhere. Despite occasional bumps, as when neighbors in Doral complained about noise and the course\u2019s new   trees, the purchases have generally gone according to plan. Where others might see disappointment, Mr. Trump is unfailingly upbeat when reflecting on his business ventures. In the interviews, he maintained that his deals, for the most part, \u201care all tremendously successful. \u201d And a number of them were, at least for him, because they were licensing arrangements that paid him millions of dollars in fees upfront regardless of how well the engagement turned out. Other times, he said, he showed his business acumen by canceling or delaying deals to avoid hitting a difficult market. \u201cAll of my jobs work in some form or another,\u201d Mr. Trump said, noting several times that he had more than 100 deals in progress or in negotiation. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t understand. \u201d He harbored no regrets about how he had trumpeted his past engagements, explaining how his promotions were no different from what one might find in newspaper ads for a new car or home. \u201cPeople use language that\u2019s very much up there,\u201d he said. He acknowledged that he sometimes announced deals before they were fully baked. It was part of the plan, he said, to gauge the public\u2019s response, like a trial balloon, to see whether a deal was worth doing. \u201cIt is an awfully good way of testing things, I\u2019ll be honest with you,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no investment, as opposed to doing the deal and letting it be a failure. \u201d As president, Mr. Trump said, he might use the same approach to policy making. \u201cI guess you could say there will be a time where I may want to test something by talking about it publicly and seeing what the response is,\u201d he said. But he said that some of his campaign pledges were positively bankable. \u201cFor instance,\u201d he said, \u201cwe are going to build a wall. I\u2019m going to build the wall. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563298.8340652}
