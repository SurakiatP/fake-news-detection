[When asked, \u201cWhen you think about the future of the country, would you say that you are mainly hopeful and optimistic or mainly worried and pessimistic,\u201d sixty percent of 1, 000 adults surveyed from Feb. 18 t0 Feb. 22 said they were hopeful, not pessimistic. That\u2019s a steady upward drift from 53 percent in August, and 56 percent in December. Pollsters note the margin of error is plus or minus 3. 1 percentage points.  Meanwhile, Trump himself fares slightly less well: 44 percent approve of the job he\u2019s doing as president, while 48 percent disapprove.  The surge in optimism is driven in part by Trump voters\u2019 enthusiasm, according to what pollster Bill McInturff told the Washington Examiner: \u201cThis is a strong number being driven by very high numbers among Trump voters who express optimism across a number of measures on the poll, including higher economic confidence. \u201d But other groups are feeling hopeful, too. Over half, or 52 percent, of Hispanics are hopeful about the future of America, not worried. So are 65 percent of whites. (Among blacks, only 36 percent feel optimistic.) Nearly all Republicans, or 87 percent, are hopeful about the future, as well as 56 percent of independents. And so are 37 percent of Democrats. So, Trump has broad appeal with whites and Hispanics, along with a significant minority of Democrats \u2014  and a majority of independent voters. That\u2019s solid enough of a coalition to sustain power and encourage a younger generation of Republican leaders, such as Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton, to champion a populist, nationalist agenda. Trump\u2019s approval ratings may be low at the moment, but his administration is still brand new and voters outside centers of concentrated, Democratic power are still cautiously warming to him. The losers of the globalization game were stigmatized as bigoted or hateful for protesting policies enabling cheap labor, low wages, mass immigration,   communities, family disintegration, drug addiction, suicide. The years leading up to the election were marked by an incredible expansion of the labor pool and a $  wealth transfer to Wall Street. Every job created from 2000 to 2014 went to the large,   population residing in the U. S. which stands at roughly 42. 4 million people. Coincidentally, morality rates \u201cfrom drug poisoning, alcohol poisoning, and suicide increased by 52 percent between 2000 and 2014,\u201d according to one university study. \u201cNearly half of all young white male deaths are caused by drugs, alcohol, or suicide,\u201d wrote the author, compared to roughly a quarter of young Hispanic male deaths and 13 percent of young black deaths. The Economist found that 41 percent of white, working class men have given up looking for work. Over 47, 000 people died from   deaths in 2014 alone, and heroin overdose deaths have more than tripled between 2010 and 2015. The wave of death washing over American communities elicited little notice, let alone outrage, from the political establishment and mega media outlets. Immigration also fueled this surge of   : Nearly all of the heroin used in the U. S. is brought across the border by   Mexican traffickers. But the globalist class plowed ahead with its agenda anyway, deepening the sense of alienation many felt, particularly those drawn to Trump. \u201cThe sacredness of mass immigration is the mystic chord that unites America\u2019s ruling and intellectual classes,\u201d as  one pseudonymous essayist wrote in the in the Claremont Review of Books. Many sensed they were being denied a say in the way their lives were being shaped, and in many cases, destroyed by the globalists\u2019 preferred policies: Before Trump assumed office, 84 percent of white,   voters told pollsters that U. S. government did not represent their views. \u201cThe archipelago of constituencies loyal to Democrats is small geographically. But it has lately set close to 100 percent of the agenda, and did so even in the 2016 election,\u201d writes the Weekly Standard\u2018s Christopher Caldwell. \u201cThe important cultural innovations of the Obama Administration can fairly be said to have been introduced without debate, or at least in disregard of what debate had been going on,\u201d Caldwell writes. \u201cGay marriage was this way, as was the complex of issues surrounding transgender bathrooms. Where did the   movement Black Lives Matter come from, with its mix of street violence and campus political correctness?   \u2026     Why was no one in authority talking about the heroin and opioid epidemic, even as it was killing more Americans than any drug wave in American history, more even than car accidents?\u201d \u201cPerhaps the main thing voters were trying to do in 2016 was to restore democratic scrutiny to actors who had long managed to evade it. We will never know, because for many years Americans have felt unable to talk about such things in public at all,\u201d he said. And now, Trump has an opportunity to build a lasting governing coalition out of   voters ignored or mocked by the globalist class. \u201cThe globalists gutted the American working class and created a middle class in Asia,\u201d White House Chief strategist Steve Bannon said during a November interview. \u201cThe issue now is about Americans looking to not get f \u2014  ed over. \u201d \u201cIf we deliver, we\u2019ll get 60 percent of the white vote, and 40 percent of the black and Hispanic vote and we\u2019ll govern for 50 years,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what the Democrats missed  \u2026     They lost sight of what the world is about. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563229.0414507}
