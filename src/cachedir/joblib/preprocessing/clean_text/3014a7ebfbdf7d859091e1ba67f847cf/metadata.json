Mr. Kalanick issued a   statement on Tuesday saying, \u201cWe\u2019re actively looking for a Chief Operating Officer: a peer who can partner with me to write the next chapter in our journey. \u201d An Uber spokesman declined to comment beyond the statement. Mr. Kalanick\u2019s search for a chief operating officer follows several blows to Uber this year that have raised questions about the   company\u2019s workplace culture and business tactics. Some of the concerns have extended to Mr. Kalanick\u2019s character, and Tuesday\u2019s announcement shows how he intends to restructure the executive suite to get more help, while continuing to lead the company. Mr. Kalanick said last week that he needed to change as a leader \u201cand grow up,\u201d adding that \u201cI need leadership help, and I intend to get it. \u201d He spoke as part of an apology for berating an Uber driver in February, an incident that was captured on video and made public. Beyond the video, Uber has been reeling from allegations from former employees about a discriminatory and brutal culture a lawsuit from Waymo, a   vehicle rival, that claims an Uber executive stole intellectual property from it and a social   campaign to delete the Uber app. On Friday, The New York Times reported that Uber has for years used a secret tool called Greyball to identify and circumvent authorities who were trying to clamp down on the   service. Mr. Kalanick, a founder of Uber, has long set its tone. He has taken a pugilistic style toward pushing Uber\u2019s services into cities and towns around the world, often flouting laws and regulations, and has spoken publicly about how his company helped him attract women. Filling an executive position at this level will not be easy. \u201cGenerally speaking, talent is very tight, and the pool of available executives within the technology industry is small,\u201d said Richard Marshall, a partner with the executive search firm Korn Ferry. \u201cAnd for     companies, it\u2019s hard to find someone with the skills needed who is a cultural fit. \u201d Many Silicon Valley companies have placed experienced executives alongside young founders to help them steer    . Eric Schmidt, now chairman of Alphabet, was once known as the adult supervision for Google\u2019s young founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. At Facebook, the social network, Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive, brought in Sheryl Sandberg, a respected tech executive who is now the company\u2019s chief operating officer.'"}, "time": 1742564304.0756428}
