[The statue was commissioned on behalf of asset manager State Street and advertising agency McCann New York as a way of encouraging firms to hire more female executives.  \u201cIts simplicity in the use of symbolism transcends geography, it transcends language, it transcends culture,\u201d Wendy Clark, CEO of DDB North America, told Adweek. \u201cFor us, while it is a girl, it elegantly captures women\u2019s journeys and our path to empowerment. And it also encapsulates our hopes and our ambitions for every little girl in the world. \u201d Clark also serves as the jury president of the Cannes Lions awards week, which was inspired by the Cannes Film Festival and takes place at the same conference center in Cannes, France. The \u201cFearless Girl\u201d statue took home the Grand Prix in the Glass, PR and Outdoor Lions categories on the festival\u2019s first day. The statue was sculpted by artist Kristen Visbal in an effort to encourage gender diversity amongst corporate executives. \u201cThe girl is standing there like this in front the bull, saying, \u2018Now, what are you going to do?\u2019  Arturo Di Modica said, who sculpted the Charging Bull statue. Di Modica argues that the \u201cFearless Girl\u201d statue violates his artistic rights as it changes the meaning of the bull statue. \u201cRemove her and place her somewhere else in the city,\u201d Di Modica\u2019s attorney said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got lots of ideas. And damages must be awarded to Arturo for violation of his legal, statutory rights. \u201d Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about economics and higher education for Breitbart News.
