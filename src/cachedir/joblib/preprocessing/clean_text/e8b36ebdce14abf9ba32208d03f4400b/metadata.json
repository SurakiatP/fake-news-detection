[Judge Mahmoud Habbash said he based his ruling on \u201cthe experience of previous years\u201d when he found that the    fast and ban on cigarettes, which began on Saturday, tended to lead to frayed tempers and sharp tongues.  \u201cSome, because they have not eaten and not smoked, create problems\u201d in their marriages, he said in a statement, and they can make \u201cquick and   decisions. \u201d According to the Palestinian Authority, 50, 000 weddings were celebrated in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in 2015, but more than 8, 000 divorces were also registered. Endemic unemployment and poverty are said to be major contributing factors. There is no civil marriage or divorce in the Palestinian territories, where only religious courts have those powers.'"}, "time": 1742564451.1651645}
