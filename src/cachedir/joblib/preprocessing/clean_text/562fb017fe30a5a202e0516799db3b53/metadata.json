Do a \u201cDeep Search\u201d Instead, but brace yourself for the results The Free Thought Project October 26, 2016 Comments Off on Ever Google Yourself? Do a \u201cDeep Search\u201d Instead, but brace yourself for the results \\n12 \u2013 sponsored content by \\nEver try Googling someone only to come up with basic information and maybe a link or two to an outdated social media profile? There\u2019s a new website going around that promises to reveal much more than just a simple google search can show you. \\nBeen issued a speeding ticket? Failed to stop at a stop sign? What about your family members? And friends? If you are like most of us, the answer to at least one of those questions is \u201cyes\u201d\u2014the vast majority of us have slipped up at least once or twice. \\nAn innovative new website \u2014 Instant Checkmate is now revealing the full \u201cscoop\u201d on millions of Americans. \\nInstant Checkmate aggregates hundreds of millions of publicly available criminal, traffic, and arrest records and posts them online so they can easily be searched by anyone. Members of the site can literally begin searching within seconds, and are able to check as many records as they like (think: friends, family, neighbors, etc. etc.). \\nPreviously, if you wanted to research someone\u2019s arrest records, you might have had to actually go into a county court office\u2014in the appropriate county\u2014and formally request information on an individual. This process may have taken days or weeks, or the information might not have been available at all. With websites like Instant Checkmate , however, a background check takes just a few clicks of the mouse, and no more than a minute or two. \\nWhile preparing this article, I decided to run a quick search on myself to give the service a real-world test. To my dismay, the search revealed several items I\u2019d long forgotten\u2014one of them being for the possession of a fake ID I was (embarrassingly) issued back in college when I was just 18 years old. \u201cpossession of a fake ID I was (embarrassingly) issued back in college when I was just 18 years old\u201d \\nAfter searching myself and finding those records, my curiosity was piqued, and I began researching family members\u2014apparently my aunt Susanne isn\u2019t a very good driver, judging by the numerous traffic citations that showed on her record. \\nOne of the most interesting aspects of Instant Checkmate is that it shows not only criminal records, but also more general background information like court records, various types of licenses (FAA, DEA), previous addresses, phone numbers, birthdates, estimated income levels and even satellite imagery of known addresses\u2014it\u2019s really pretty scary just how much information is in these reports. \\nIn addition to giving information on the specific person you search for, the report also includes a scrolling list of \u201clocal sex offenders\u201d for whatever region you\u2019ve searched\u2014along with a map plotting out the locations of those offenders. I started perusing the ones that showed up in my report, and I was absolutely blown away when I stumbled upon my junior high school wrestling coach\u2019s mug shot. \\n\u201cI was absolutely blown away when I stumbled upon my junior high school wrestling coach\u2019s mug shot.\u201d \\nHis crime was listed as \u201cOut of state offense,\u201d\u201d so I wasn\u2019t able to get the specifics (you usually can\u2014this was an unusual case), but he was definitely a registered sex offender. Scary stuff. \\nI would definitely recommend this tool to friends and family. Anyone can start running background checks on Instant Checkmate within a few seconds\u2014just click this link to get started. If you would like to search someone you know, click here . Note from the Author \\nI have to warn you before you start your search, the information you find may be overwhelming and has the potential of changing your view of the search subject forever.
