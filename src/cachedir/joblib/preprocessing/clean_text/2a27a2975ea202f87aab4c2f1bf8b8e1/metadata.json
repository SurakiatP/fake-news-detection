From Egan\u2019s New York Times column: Bannon is a voracious reader  \u2014   of philosophy, theory and the hinge moments in history. Cromwell, who altered the course of the Western world in ways still being felt today, was Steve Bannon in feathered Tudor finery.   \u2026     Readers of Hilary Mantel\u2019s revisionist novels, and viewers of the BBC series based on her work, know Thomas Cromwell as a brooding, brilliant master of the court of King Henry VIII, from 1532 to 1540. The real Cromwell was a cunning conspirator who tore up the old order in service of a     king who forced a breakaway religion on his subjects. Or was he serving his own needs, an overarching plan? That\u2019s the question we should ask about Bannon. Like Cromwell, the   in the West Wing is brilliant and cunning, and full of contradictions. He appears to be a   baby boomer, a   member of the Harvard Business   Sachs elite, a   Hollywood director and a   journalist. From his films on Sarah Palin to his time running Breitbart, he learned how to be a very good propagandist. It\u2019s a role that has served him well in the White House.   \u2026     As chief strategist, he recently vowed a daily fight for \u201cdeconstruction of the administrative state. \u201d This is a Cromwellian task aimed at overturning not just the traditional work of the federal government, but also the existing international order of treaties, trade pacts and alliances that has kept the world relatively safe since World War II. Trump\u2019s cabinet is stocked with people whose goal is to neuter the agencies they head. Read the rest here. '"}, "time": 1742562863.7409546}
