The site, Professor Watchlist, which first appeared Nov. 21, says it names those instructors who \u201cadvance a radical agenda in lecture halls. \u201d \u201cWe aim to post professors who have records of targeting students for their viewpoints, forcing students to adopt a certain perspective,   abuse or harm students in any way for standing up for their beliefs,\u201d wrote Matt Lamb, an organizer of the site. The Professor Watchlist is a project of Turning Point USA, a nonprofit organization that says its mission is to educate students about \u201ctrue free market values. \u201d Charlie Kirk, its founder and executive director, wrote in a blog post that \u201cit\u2019s no secret that some of America\u2019s college professors are totally out of line\u201d and that it was time to expose them. But Julio C. Pino, an associate professor of history at Kent State University in Ohio who is among those named on the site, said in an interview, \u201cWhat we are seeing with this site is a kind of normalizing of prosecuting professors, shaming professors, defaming professors. \u201d \u201cThe broader issue it raises is: What kind of country is America going to become in the next four years?\u201d he added. Professor Pino said professors should not fight the creators of the list directly but instead seek allies on and off campus to address what gave rise to the atmosphere that allowed the website to flourish in the first place. The professor is listed on the site because, it says, he faced investigation by the F. B. I. \u201cfor connections to ISIS. \u201d He declined to address the allegations, but has denied any ties to the terrorist organization and has spoken out against violence, according to The Plain Dealer in Cleveland. Mr. Lamb, a director of constitutional enforcement and transparency at Turning Point USA, said in an email that the website was \u201csimply aggregating\u201d professors whose actions have been the subject of news reports. \u201cThis site is a beautiful example of freedom of speech,\u201d Mr. Lamb said. \u201cProfessors can say whatever they want, other people can report it and we can compile the reports on whatever they say. \u201d The website has thin information in its entries and a    search function. That could be a reflection of how rapidly it was created to capitalize on the political climate, particularly after the election of Donald J. Trump as president, Professor Pino said. Among those featured is Melissa Click, a former University of Missouri professor who was caught on video calling for \u201csome muscle\u201d to remove a journalist from a student demonstration in 2015. The university later fired Ms. Click. One of the instructors listed, Joan Neuberger, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin who teaches Russian history, was described on the site as leading a petition to bar students who carry concealed weapons from entering classrooms \u201cin violation of Texas law. \u201d But Professor Neuberger said in an email that the characterization was inaccurate. \u201cThe law had not been finalized yet when we were petitioning,\u201d she said, adding that the website showed no commitment to posting factual information. Professor Pino said Professor Watchlist was a \u201creboot\u201d of similar past efforts, such as Discover the Networks by the conservative activist David Horowitz.   Tiede, the associate secretary for the department of academic freedom, tenure and governance at the American Association of University Professors, said in an interview: \u201cThere is a continuing cycle of these sorts of things. They serve the same purpose: to intimidate individuals from speaking plainly in their classrooms or in their publications. \u201d He noted in a blog post that the monitoring of organizations and people deemed \u201cradical\u201d dated to 1934, when the conservative political activist Elizabeth Dilling published \u201cThe Red Network: A \u2018Who\u2019s Who\u2019 and Handbook of Radicalism for Patriots. \u201d Among the organizations listed in her work were the American Federation of Teachers and the American Civil Liberties Union. Ms. Dilling wrote that the federation supported \u201cfull \u2018academic freedom\u2019 to teach anything, including socialism, communism or atheism,\u201d according to the blog post. Mr. Tiede said the site could be used to harass professors or sabotage them from gaining jobs or promotions. And some professors were submitting their own names to the website as a way to emphasize the absurdity of the list, he added. Others took to Twitter to highlight parody submissions, such as Albus Dumbledore from \u201cHarry Potter\u201d and the Professor from the television series \u201cGilligan\u2019s Island. \u201d The submission for the latter character read in part: \u201cSpent almost 30 minutes building a working radio out of coconuts but failed to maintain a working signal in the end. \u201d Some in academic circles said professors should not overreact to the site, but should not ignore it either. \u201cIn the past, I have taken the position that we ignore such challenges to free speech and the hate mail that usually accompanies it, but no longer,\u201d Professor Neuberger said. \u201cNow I say we fight as hard as we can against people who don\u2019t care about accuracy, who can\u2019t recognize fake news and who seek to monitor what we do as educators. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562730.3816013}
