[Those (of us) who could not believe in Christianity as a religion nonetheless believed that its tenets  ideals were noble, profound.  But,  \u2014   Joyce Carol Oates (@JoyceCarolOates) January 13, 2017,   @JoyceCarolOates what has happened to Christians in recent years! Virtually synonymous   white nationalism in many parts of country.  \u2014   Joyce Carol Oates (@JoyceCarolOates) January 13, 2017,  Of course, many of the    author\u2019s 160, 000 social media followers (and presumably some Christians) took umbrage at the suggestion that their faith automatically makes them a white nationalist. @JoyceCarolOates so all those Yazidis massacred in Syria. White Nationalists?  \u2014   ZendoDeb (@ZendoDeb) January 13, 2017,  . @JoyceCarolOates Country is full of black churches  packed every Sunday, they\u2019re Christians. Or are you not aware Baptists are Christians?  \u2014   Michelle (@1MonthLeft) January 13, 2017,  @JoyceCarolOates It\u2019s only \u201dvirtually synonymous\u201d in your own head. And that\u2019s about YOU, not Christianity. But don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re forgiven,  \u2014   The Department of No (@SantasTavern) January 13, 2017,  @JoyceCarolOates I\u2019m not even Christian and still find this a disgusting, bigoted generalization.  \u2014   Cate (@ArmyofBlonde) January 13, 2017,  Then again, Oates has a long history of issuing questionable tweets in June of 2015, the National Book   expressed her outrage that director Steven Spielberg had posed for a photograph with what appeared to be a dead animal. So barbaric that this should still be allowed  \u2026      No conservation laws in effect wherever this is? https:  .   \u2014   Joyce Carol Oates (@JoyceCarolOates) June 9, 2015,    viewers, or anyone that has seen the 1993 film Jurassic Park, knew that Spielberg was posing with an animatronic dinosaur prop from the film. This guy thinks it\u2019s cool to kill defenceless animals then take a selfie. Jerk. pic. twitter.   \u2014   Chris Tilly (@TillyTweets) June 9, 2015,  In November, Oates was roundly mocked for issuing a tweet about ISIS. The author wanted to know whether there were any \u201ccelebratory or joyous\u201d aspects of the murderous terrorist group, rather than the \u201cpuritanical and \u201cpunitive\u201d aspects she had heard so much about.
