He tried to go to an urgent care center and called several local doctors. No one could see him. So he headed to the nearest emergency room. On the way, he called his insurance company to make sure the visit would be covered. Once he got to the Palms of Pasadena Hospital emergency room, a doctor gave him some medication and tests, and let him go. A month later, feeling better and back at home in Baton Rouge, La. Mr. Moore, 34, received an    bill from the doctor who treated him  \u2014   for $1, 620. \u201cThat really makes me mad, and kind of breaks my heart,\u201d he said. When people go to the emergency room, they are often stunned to discover that doctors who treated them are not employed by the hospital and bill their insurance company separately. These doctors negotiate separate deals with insurance companies for payment. If the doctor and the insurance company never strike a deal, the visit is billed at much higher    rates. While the insurance company sometimes pays the higher amount, unlucky patients like Mr. Moore can be caught in the crossfire. They receive care and have no idea what it will end up costing them. New research published in The New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday found that more than one in five patients visiting the emergency room may face the same financial shock. The study looked at billing data from one large national insurer and found that 22 percent of the time, patients who went to a hospital covered by their plan still received a bill from a doctor who was not in the insurance company\u2019s network. The average such bill cost more than $900, though there was a wide range the highest was for more than $19, 000. This is not the first time researchers have examined  surprise medical bills, but it\u2019s the broadest analysis to date of the problem nationwide. The study found wide variation across the country over the likelihood that someone would get a surprise medical bill. In McAllen, Tex. for example, the rates of surprise billing were 89 percent, compared with Boulder, Colo. where it was near zero. Once patients get to the emergency room, they have little choice over who treats them. \u201cTo put it in very, very blunt terms: This is the health equivalent of a carjacking,\u201d said Zack Cooper, an assistant professor of health policy and economics at Yale University, and a   of the paper. Mr. Cooper argues that the problem could be solved by Congress, which could make the visit a package that includes both the doctor and hospital. Consumer advocates, and scholars like Mr. Cooper, see the surprise bill as unfair. It\u2019s nearly impossible for patients to uncover the contract arrangements of individual physicians once they walk into an emergency room  \u2014   or are brought by ambulance. \u201cPeople are, by and large, not aware that they\u2019re playing that type of financial roulette,\u201d said Chuck Bell, the programs director at Consumers Union, an advocacy group that has been urging states and Congress to help solve the problem. \u201cThey follow the rules, and they go to the   hospital, and then it\u2019s just like a   . \u201d Several states have passed legislation aimed at tackling the problem, including New York, Florida and California, where a law recently went into effect. But the state laws affect only a fraction of insurance customers. Insurance offered by large companies, like Mr. Moore\u2019s employer, is regulated under federal law. And most of the laws work by setting up a dispute resolution system for patients, which means they need to know they can go to state authorities to fight a big bill. Congressman Lloyd Doggett, a Democrat from Texas, introduced legislation last year to tackle the practice nationwide, but he said he experienced \u201ca healthy dose of indifference\u201d from his colleagues on the Ways and Means committee. Mr. Doggett had heard complaints of surprise bills from constituents, and it turns out that the new study found that Texas is a hot spot for the practice. Mr. Doggett said he would introduce the legislation again next year. \u201cI think that there\u2019s got to be a way to get consumers out of this trap,\u201d he said. President Obama included proposals to limit    emergency room bills in his budget proposal, and recent regulations have made it more difficult for doctors to collect certain bills, though those rules are being fought in court by physicians. The acting administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has said that surprise bills are a policy priority for him. The data in the study come from one large commercial insurer, but the researchers agreed not to name it in exchange for access. Mr. Cooper said there was only a little difference in the share of surprise bills in places where the insurance company had a lot of customers, compared with those where it did less business. Emergency room doctors criticized the study\u2019s findings and were quick to blame the insurers. The American College of Emergency Physicians, the medical society that represents the doctors, said patients are much less likely to face large unexpected bills than the study suggested, citing an analysis the group did in Florida of patients who were \u201cbalance billed,\u201d or asked to make up the difference between what the insurer pays and what the doctor bills. \u201cOur balance bills are less than a couple of hundred dollars, on average,\u201d said Dr. Rebecca Parker, the group\u2019s president. She said that most doctors want to be included in networks but that they are not being offered reasonable fees. \u201cThis is insurance company bad behavior,\u201d said Dr. Parker, whose group this week put out a parody video that accuses the insurers of paying too little for their work. Insurance companies like to blame the physicians, arguing that while they can reach a deal with the hospitals, there are many doctors who refuse to be part of the network they offer under a plan. And the insurers argue hospitals have a responsibility to make sure the outside doctors they use to staff their emergency rooms sign contracts with the same health plans they do. \u201cThis would go a long way to reduce and prevent consumers from receiving a big surprise balance bill,\u201d Kristine Grow, a spokeswoman for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group, said in an email. The new paper\u2019s authors agree. When Mr. Moore received his doctor\u2019s bill, he tried appealing the charge to his insurance company. \u201cWe understand that you went to a preferred provider facility and did not have a choice of the emergency room physician who treated you,\u201d his insurer wrote back  \u2014   but denied the claim. Then he went to the private practice that had sent him the bill. It was willing to negotiate. \u201cThey knocked off half the bill,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich is great. It\u2019s like, would you rather get punched four times or two times? I guess two times is better. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562959.9554925}
