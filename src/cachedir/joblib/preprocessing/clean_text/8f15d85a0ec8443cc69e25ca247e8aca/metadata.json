[Patagonia CEO Rose Marcario recently attacked President Trump for his statements about rolling back President Obama\u2019s unusually aggressive campaign of confiscating millions of acres of state lands and claiming them as \u201cnational monuments. \u201d  \u201cWe have to fight like hell to keep every inch of public land,\u201d Marcario said in a May article at Huffpost. \u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of faith in politics and politicians right now. \u201d In an effort to prevent citizens from retaking possession of their state lands, one of her immediate actions will be to sue the Trump administration for its efforts to scale back Obama\u2019s unprecedented land grab. \u201cA president does not have the authority to rescind a national monument,\u201d Marcario said in an April 26 statement after Trump announced his national monuments order. \u201cAn attempt to change the boundaries ignores the review process of cultural and historical characteristics and the public input. \u201d In particular, the Trump administration is preparing to revisit Obama\u2019s order to create the Bears Ears National Monument. In April, Trump issued an executive order requiring the Department of the Interior to review Obama\u2019s actions on national monuments. Ordering Interior Secretary Ray Zinke to review Obama\u2019s policies in April, President Trump called Obama\u2019s move an \u201cegregious abuse of federal power. \u201d Many state governments fully agree with Trump\u2019s assessment and were furious when Obama swooped in from Washington and stole away millions of acres of land from state control to create new national monuments and parks. A poll of residents of Utah, for instance, showed that 60 percent opposed Obama\u2019s land grab, while only 33 percent supported it. Along with the possible lawsuit, Marcario said Patagonia would use its profits to back   candidates in states throughout the West. This is far from the first time the sportswear company pledged its profits to political matters. Last year, the   company spent over $1 million for a     campaign to defeat Donald Trump and Republicans. But, despite its acclaimed   activism, Patagonia has a troubled history of its own, having been tied to human trafficking and child labor in its supply chain.
