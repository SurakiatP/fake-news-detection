[U. S. Magistrate Joseph Spero said Steinle\u2019s parents can sue but stressed that the suit may be dismissed if there is no evidence that the illegal alien \u2014  Juan Francisco   \u2014  stole the gun from a federal agent.  The gun in question came from the car of a federal agent \u2014  a car from which the gun was stolen. On August 28, 2015, Breitbart News previously reported that the . 40 caliber round that killed Steinle was fired from a Sig Sauer handgun that had been stolen from a Bureau of Land Management agent. However, it appears the case will turn on whether   stole the gun himself. On July 7, 2015,   told   he shot Steinle, but he said it was an accident. He said he found the gun \u201clying on the ground wrapped in a \u201d and that it \u201cwent off by accident when he picked it up. \u201d But the San Francisco Chronicle reports that Spero said the Steinle family \u201ccan sue the federal government for negligence because a ranger allegedly left the gun used in the shooting in his unlocked car. \u201d He added, \u201cLeaving a gun loaded makes (its) capability for harm readily accessible in the same way as leaving the key in the ignition of a vehicle. \u201d Spero dismissed Steinle\u2019s parent\u2019s suit against the City of San Francisco, even as he gave the   for the suit against the federal government. He \u201crejected [her parent\u2019s] claims that the city was legally responsible for releasing   without contacting the federal government and that federal immigration officials, who had known the city was holding him, had a duty to pick him up and deport him. \u201d AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of \u201cBullets with AWR Hawkins,\u201d a Breitbart News podcast.
