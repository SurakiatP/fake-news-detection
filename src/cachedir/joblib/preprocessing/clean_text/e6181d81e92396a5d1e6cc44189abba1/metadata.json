There have been more guns sold since I\u2019ve been president than just about any time in U.S. history. There are enough guns for every man, woman and child in this country. And at no point have I ever proposed confiscating guns from responsible gun owners. So it is just not true.\u201d \\nResponding to Obama\u2019s statement, the article acknowledged, \u201cNow, [the gun store owner]could have interrupted the president to mention that Obama really hasn\u2019t had the opportunity to do that. Congress writes the laws, not the president\u201d: \\nRhude didn\u2019t sit down after asking his question. Rather, he stood silently as President Obama didn\u2019t even try to answer his question, but instead went off on a defensive tirade: \u201cFirst of all, the notion that I or Hillary or Democrats or whoever you want to choose are hell-bent on taking away folks\u2019 guns is just not true. And I don\u2019t care how many times the NRA says it.\u201d \\nObama then said, \u201cI\u2019m about to leave office. There have been more guns sold since I\u2019ve been president than just about any time in U.S. history. There are enough guns for every man, woman and child in this country. And at no point have I ever proposed confiscating guns from responsible gun owners. So it is just not true.\u201d \\nNow, Rhude could have interrupted the president to mention that Obama really hasn\u2019t had the opportunity to do that. Congress writes the laws, not the president. He could then have listed the many attacks on the right to bear arms \u2014 from Operation Fast and Furious to Operation Choke Point to Obama\u2019s attempted ban on common ammunition for AR-15-type rifles to his using a \u201cpen and phone\u201d to push anti-gun executive actions. But Rhude respectfully stayed silent. \\nClaims about gun confiscation and Obama have been the NRA\u2019s bread and butter for the past eight years . More recently, the NRA has suggested that the election of Clinton could lead to gun confiscation for law-abiding Americans. \\nRead in full on Media Matters for America: NRA Admits It: \u201cObama Really Hasn\u2019t Had The Opportunity To\u201d Confiscate Guns \\n'"}, "time": 1742563347.793099}
