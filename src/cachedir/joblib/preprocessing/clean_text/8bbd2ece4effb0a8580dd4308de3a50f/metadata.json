[Haaretz reports, \u201cThe latest   wave, following the June 2016 mass shooting at a gay bar in Orlando, Florida, has brought a new kind of person to the gun culture  \u2014   young and liberal gay people, many of them  . They\u2019re now standing side by side with straight white conservative men at shooting ranges. \u201d  The Orlando Pulse nightclub was a   zone and the attack on it was carried out by an Islamist with two guns a rifle and a handgun. He passed background checks for both guns and a   waiting period for the handgun, proving once more that gun control is no hindrance to determined attackers. Many in the LGBT community came away from the attack awakened to this fact and to the reality that they were going to have to take   into their own hands \u2014  literally. Enter the Pink Pistols. Prior to the Orlando Pulse attack \u201cthe Pink Pistols Facebook group numbered about 1, 500 people. \u201d But following the attack \u201csixteen Pink Pistols branches opened  \u2026     and the Facebook group grew to 9, 000 members. \u201d Pink Pistols spokesperson Gwendolyn Patton said: We teach queers to shoot so they can be safer from those who would harm them for who and what they are. Then we tell the world we\u2019ve done it, so those who think queer people are helpless targets who can\u2019t fight back and are easy pickings for violence will know that it isn\u2019t necessarily true   \u2026    . We don\u2019t want to have to shoot anyone. We\u2019d much rather they decided it wasn\u2019t worth the risk and went to play pool or something. On June 12, 2016, just hours after the Orlando Pulse occurred, Breitbart News quoted Patton saying, \u201cLet us not reach for the   fruit of blaming the killer\u2019s guns. Let us stay focused on the fact that someone hated gay people so much they were ready to kill or injure so many. A human being did this. The human being\u2019s tools are unimportant when compared to the bleakness of that person\u2019s soul. \u201d Patton admitted that it is difficult to carry guns in the bars of some states because of   prohibitions. But she suggested this can often be remedied by a selecting designated driver who agrees to forgo any alcohol for the night so that that he can carry a gun with which to protect his companions. Patton said, \u201cIt\u2019s sad that we must consider such things, but when there are persons out there who mean us harm, we must find ways to protect ourselves within the law. \u201d Erin Palette is transgender who lives 60 miles from Orlando and has concealed carry permit. Palette recalled how the LGBT community\u2019s view of owning guns for   appeared to change overnight \u2014  following Orlando Pulse \u2014  and how gun ranges and firearms training facilities across the country were eager to help: I started seeing this wonderful outpouring of support from gun owners who were posting all across social media that if you were LGTBQ and wanted to learn how to defend yourself, these gun owners would teach you shooting for absolutely free. And the sentiment was: \u2018I don\u2019t care what your politics are, I don\u2019t care what your sexuality is, I don\u2019t care what you have between your legs  \u2014   you are a human being, you have the inherent right to defend yourself, and if you don\u2019t know how, I will be happy to teach you.\u2019'"}, "time": 1742563193.8112278}
