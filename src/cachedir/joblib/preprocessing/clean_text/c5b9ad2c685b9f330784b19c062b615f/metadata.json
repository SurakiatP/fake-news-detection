Chris Christie of New Jersey and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York had agreed to falsely explain the closings as part of a traffic study to try to \u201cput an end\u201d to a growing scandal surrounding them. The confessed culprit, David Wildstein, testified that he had heard from two top Christie appointees at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the bridge, that the governors had hoped to stop the catastrophic traffic jams caused by the lane closings from hurting Mr. Christie\u2019s   campaign. Mr. Wildstein, who is cooperating with federal prosecutors in the trial of two former Christie aides accused of approving and directing the   scheme, agreed that Mr. Cuomo had told the Port Authority\u2019s executive director to \u201cstand down\u201d from trying to publicly blame Mr. Christie and his aides for the closings, at least until Mr. Christie had won   in November 2013. A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo issued a statement sternly denying that the governor and Mr. Christie had discussed a false story and denouncing Mr. Wildstein\u2019s motivations. Mr. Christie, a Republican, and Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, have previously denied that such a conversation occurred. Both have said they had no role in covering up the cause of the lane closings. The testimony by Mr. Wildstein, a former Christie administration official at the Port Authority, left open the possibility that Mr. Cuomo did not know the true reason for the closings. Mr. Wildstein has said they were meant to punish a mayor who did not endorse Mr. Christie\u2019s  . But Mr. Wildstein testified previously that Mr. Christie knew about the closings and their punitive intent as they happened, and that the governor laughed when he heard about the traffic jam and that the mayor\u2019s calls about public safety risks were being ignored. On Tuesday, his seventh day on the witness stand, Mr. Wildstein was   by a lawyer for Bridget Anne Kelly, a former deputy chief of staff to Mr. Christie who is on trial with Bill Baroni, Mr. Christie\u2019s former top staff appointee at the Port Authority. Mr. Wildstein testified that top officials in the governor\u2019s office and David Samson, Mr. Christie\u2019s appointee as Port Authority chairman, had decided that New Jersey officials at the agency would write a report trying to legitimize the traffic study story. The report, Mr. Wildstein said, would seek to dismiss the mayor\u2019s complaints by saying there had been a \u201cfailure of communication. \u201d Mr. Christie\u2019s office would review the report, he said, and the authority\u2019s executive director, Patrick J. Foye, appointed by Mr. Cuomo, would approve it. Mr. Foye had ordered the lanes reopened when he learned about the shutdown four days after it began and had never been a fan of Mr. Wildstein. Mr. Foye knew the lane closings were not related to a traffic study, and at least one of his staff members had called reporters to say so, generating intense coverage of the closings and why they happened. But Mr. Foye agreed to sign off on the report, Mr. Wildstein said in court on Tuesday, as long as New Jersey took responsibility. \u201cMy understanding at the time was that this would put an end to this issue,\u201d Mr. Wildstein testified, referring to the report by the two governors. \u201cPat Foye would sign off on a false report?\u201d Ms. Kelly\u2019s lawyer, Michael Critchley, asked him. \u201cYes, sir, that was my understanding,\u201d Mr. Wildstein said. \u201cAnd that was a result of conversations with Cuomo and Christie?\u201d Mr. Critchley said. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d Mr. Wildstein said. Mr. Cuomo\u2019s office, Mr. Wildstein said, had told Mr. Foye to \u201clay off Christie. \u201d Mr. Wildstein, who has pleaded guilty to his role in the lane closings, acknowledged that his account was secondhand. He said he had heard about the conversations from Mr. Samson and Mr. Baroni. Mr. Cuomo\u2019s office on Tuesday denied that any such conversation had taken place. \u201cWhatever the admitted Bridgegate architect thought or dreamt about New York\u2019s involvement has no basis in fact,\u201d John P. L. Kelly, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, said in a statement. \u201cAnyone can say anything, especially a convicted felon spinning a tale, but it\u2019s just false and delusional. \u201d No report was ever issued. Federal prosecutors and Mr. Wildstein have said that was because Mr. Baroni was asked to give testimony to a New Jersey legislative committee, and he read a version of the report there. Mr. Wildstein also testified that Mr. Baroni told him that Kevin O\u2019Dowd, Mr. Christie\u2019s chief of staff, had had a conversation with his counterpart in Mr. Cuomo\u2019s office, Lawrence S. Schwartz, in which they agreed that Mr. Foye, who had also been invited to testify at that hearing, would not. Mr. Wildstein said he was also told by Mr. Christie\u2019s spokesman, Michael Drewniak, that he had briefed Mr. O\u2019Dowd on what New Jersey officials took to be Mr. Foye\u2019s meddling in their business. Ms. Kelly\u2019s lawyer asked what that meant. \u201cThat Governor Christie was in the middle of an election, that Mr. Foye was becoming involved and could potentially hurt Governor Christie, and that Mr. O\u2019Dowd now understood and had reached out to Albany to get Foye to back off,\u201d Mr. Wildstein replied. Mr. Foye did not testify at the legislative hearing, but later accepted another invitation to speak to the Legislature. Eric Corngold, a lawyer for Mr. Foye, said on Tuesday that \u201cMr. Wildstein\u2019s testimony on this topic is not accurate. \u201d \u201cMr. Foye never had any such conversations or was given any such direction by the governor or any of his staff,\u201d Mr. Corngold continued. The day after Mr. Christie won   The Wall Street Journal reported that Mr. Wildstein had been behind the order to close the lanes. Mr. Wildstein testified that he believed Mr. Cuomo\u2019s direction to \u201cstand down,\u201d as Mr. Critchley said, did not extend past Election Day. \u201cI did not believe it was a coincidence that I had been told that Governor Cuomo had spoken to Mr. Foye during the election campaign and then suddenly comments from Mr. Foye went away,\u201d Mr. Wildstein said, \u201cand the day after the election a reporter called the Port Authority, called me, to talk about my involvement. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563953.6531777}
