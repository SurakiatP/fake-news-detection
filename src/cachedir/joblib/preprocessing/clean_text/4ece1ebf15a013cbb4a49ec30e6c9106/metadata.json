[While disputing the CBO numbers, Sims said, \u201cThis bill is still a work in progress. This bill is not finalized. The president has met with conservative allies over the last week or so, from the Heritage Foundation to Freedom Works and many other groups that have come in and met with him. \u201d Sims also cited members of congress and the Freedom Caucus as having met with Trump recently to share their concerns and ideas regarding any final bill.  \u201cI\u2019ve been in the room,\u201d added Sims, \u201cwhere someone will bring up an idea or change that they\u2019re suggesting to the bill, and the president will turn to the HHS secretary, the OMB director, or, if it\u2019s Paul Ryan or Mitch McConnell in the room, and say, \u2018Will you guys think about this? Let\u2019s kick this around. Let\u2019s see if this is something that we should add. \u2019\u201d Sims also paraphrased Trump\u2019s recently expressed sentiments that \u201cthings are still under negotiation. We\u2019re still trying to strengthen this bill. There\u2019s a long way to go. \u201d Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern.
