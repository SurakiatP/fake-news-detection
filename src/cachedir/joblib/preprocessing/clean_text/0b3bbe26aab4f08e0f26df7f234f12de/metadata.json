[So while he admires Tom Brady, he will not commit to the New England Patriots winning Super Bowl LI.  Phelps commented on the big game, his trademark Phelps face, and hosting the Big Game Big Give poker tournament Saturday night in Houston. \u201cAs an athlete you root to watch athletes do great and remarkable and impressive things that have never been done before. So you look at Tom (Brady) having a chance to win his fifth (Super Bowl) you gotta root for him,\u201d Phelps said. But then he added: \u201cI\u2019m keeping it more political and rooting for both sides. I\u2019m rooting for the Under Armour family. We have an Under Armour guy on each side,\u201d Phelps said. \u201cHopefully it\u2019s a good game. \u201d Phelps is the most decorated Olympian in history, with 28 medals. One the most notable moments at last year\u2019s Rio Olympics was an angry expression before the   Butterfly   race, known affectionately as the \u201cPhelps face. \u201d But according to Phelps, it\u2019s not something you want to see. \u201cYou gotta really piss me off. If you want the Phelps face, you gotta really make me mad. I was in a mood that day. \u201d He called that victory the greatest Olympic race of his life. As for the event in Houston, Phelps expressed how important it is for him to do charity events. \u201cA passion of mine is working with kids and being able to help and give back. To be able to get an event like this where you have a bunch of us here for a great cause at a great time of the year, down here for the Super Bowl, you can\u2019t beat it. \u201d Phelps hosted the   celebrity poker tournament with renowned poker player Jamie Gold. Josh Brolin hosted the evening\u2019s earlier event, with David Schwimmer emceeing and a performance by Common.'"}, "time": 1742628445.6643171}
