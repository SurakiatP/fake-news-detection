A few of my readers had criticized me for suggesting that Trump might lose, but I don\u2019t know who is going to win the election, and so all I had to go on was the cold, hard numbers. And a couple of weeks ago the cold, hard numbers were telling me   was going to win. Of course it is entirely possible that the national polls might have been seriously wrong, but even the state polls in the most important battleground states consistently had bad news for Trump. So things didn\u2019t look good for Trump at the time, but now   their   emails the poll numbers have shifted dramatically in Trump\u2019s favor . \\nAs I write this article, the national polls have really tightened up. In fact, the latest ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll puts Trump 1 point ahead of Clinton. Trump has all of the momentum at the moment, but that does not mean that he is going to win. As we have seen already in this race, one day can literally change everything. \\nAnd as I noted yesterday , more than 23 million Americans have already voted, and most of that voting was done during a period of time when Hillary Clinton was doing very well in the polls. \\nSo we shall see what happens. But if Trump does win on November 8th, there is a fact about his birthday which will start to get a lot of attention. \\nDonald Trump was born on June 14th, 1946. If you move ahead 70 years from that date, that brings you to June 14th, 2016. Moving forward another 7 months brings you to January 14th, 2017, and moving forward another 7 days brings you to January 21st, 2017. \\nAnd if Donald Trump wins the election, January 21st will be his first full day in office. \\nOf course Trump would be inaugurated on January 20th, but he would only be president for part of that day. \\nSo that means that Donald Trump would be 70 years, 7 months and 7 days old on his first full day as president of the United States. \\nAnd this would happen during year 5777 on the Hebrew calendar. \\nThese amazing \u201ccoincidences\u201d were first pointed out on Facebook by a user named Alyson Kelly. Some may take these numbers as a sign that Donald Trump is supposed to become the next president, but I want to make it exceedingly clear that I do not know what is going to happen, nor am I making any sort of prediction about what is going to happen. \\nI just thought that this information was \u201cinteresting\u201d and so I thought that I would share it. \\nSomeone that does believe that Trump is going to win is Glenn Beck. He was been virulently anti-Trump throughout this campaign, but now he is convinced that Clinton will be unable to overcome this new email scandal, and he is calling this renewed investigation by the FBI \u201cthe greatest gift given to any candidate of all time in the history of America.\u201d \\nBeck also says that if Clinton wins now it will be evidence that \u201cmagic exists\u201d, and he is currently projecting that Trump should win the national vote by 5 points \u2026 \\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say he was 8 points, that was fair to say, 8 points behind last week,\u201d Beck said, according to a transcript posted on his website . \u201cHe should win by 5 points.\u201d \\nBeck later added: \u201cHow can the next president face a possible collapsing economy, possible war with Russia, and a current war with ISIS? Oh, and also, be under FBI investigation and indictment? Can\u2019t. Can\u2019t.\u201d \\nThe conservative personality called the latest FBI revelation \u201cthe greatest gift given to any candidate of all time in the history of America\u201d and added that if Clinton still managed to win, it would be akin to proof \u201cmagic exists.\u201d \\nHopefully Glenn Beck is right, because none of us should want to see Hillary Clinton in the White House. \\nShe is the most evil, corrupt and scandal-ridden politician of this generation, and I can\u2019t understand how any American in their right mind could possibly vote for her. \\nAnd the hits just keep on coming. Wikileaks has just released an email in which John Podesta told Clinton \u201cfixer\u201d Cheryl Mills that they were \u201cgoing to have to dump all those emails so better to do so sooner than later\u201d \u2026 \\nIt was not entirely clear what Podesta meant by that phrase, but it could potentially be smoking gun   . \\nBack in 2008, Barack Obama was new, intriguing and mysterious. We didn\u2019t know a lot about him, and so one can almost understand how the American people could have been fooled by him. \\nBut in 2016, Americans know more about Hillary Clinton than they have ever known about any candidate in modern American history. \\nThe Clintons have a history of crimes and scandals that goes all the way back to the 1980s, but about half the country is choosing to ignore all of that history and vote for her anyway. \\nI believe that this election is America\u2019s final exam. Originally there were 17 Republicans and 5 Democrats running for the presidency. When you throw in the major third party candidates, that brings us to a total of approximately 25 people that the American public could have chosen from. \\nIf the American people willingly choose the most wicked candidate out of all of them after everything that has been revealed, I don\u2019t think that anyone will be able to say that we don\u2019t deserve the bitter consequences that follow that decision. \\nThe time for talking is almost over, and shortly we shall find out which path the American people have chosen. \\nIf that choice turns out to be Hillary Clinton after everything that we have seen during this election cycle, I truly believe that we will have reached the point of no return as a nation. \\n  shares'"}, "time": 1742564218.4556499}
