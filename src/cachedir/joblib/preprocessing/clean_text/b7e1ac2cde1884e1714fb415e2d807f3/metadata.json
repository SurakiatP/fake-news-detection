Limbaugh argued that although there were some good questions from Republicans members during the hearing, it was meant to be a warning shot at Trump  \u2014   allow Washington Republicans to run the town or face possible impeachment. Partial transcript as follows (courtesy of RushLimbaugh. com): These hearings today, what happened last week and the week before that, what happened during the transition period  \u2026     What all of this is can be explained simply by saying, \u201cLook at how terrified they are in the   York establishment, of Donald Trump and draining the swamp. \u201d The Never Trumpers on both sides of the aisle. There are conservative Never Trumpers today celebrating over the fact that Comey made it official that there\u2019s an investigation of Trump and colluding with the Russians. These people know that there isn\u2019t any evidence of this, but that doesn\u2019t matter. What everybody in Washington supports is the smearing, the slander, and the libel of Donald Trump. And these hearings today? The FBI director, James Comey, is trying to save the jobs of a lot of people. He\u2019s trying to save the careers of a whole lot of people  \u2014   his included  \u2014   in, I think, an inappropriate way. And the Republicans in this committee? Look folks, I\u2019ve been waiting. I\u2019ve been patiently waiting. I\u2019ve been trying to hold it, keep the powder dry. But the Republicans on this committee  \u2026     I know it\u2019s early, and they\u2019re gonna go on all day. But so far, outside of Trey Gowdy and a question from Peter King and Devin Nunes the chairman, there just hasn\u2019t been much. For example, \u201cAre you still investigating the Clinton Foundation, Director Comey?\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t say. \u201d By the way, Comey said he got special permission to reveal this investigation. Who gave him that special permission? He said he went to the Department of Justice. Who\u2019s over there? Who runs that? That it would be Jeff Sessions. The Trump administration itself granted permission for Comey to announce this today. (interruption) Well, no. My point there is that there\u2019s no attempted   of anything going on there. The Trump administration could very well have said, Jeff Sessions could have said, \u201cComey, look, it\u2019s just like you said last summer about Hillary: We don\u2019t detail ongoing investigations. \u201d But he today was given permission to do just that, and he\u2019s running with it. And the whole point of this today  \u2014   and, by the way, it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not gonna go through this and give you what the real news of these hearings is today and what the backdrop of all this is. Because there\u2019s a really salient factor that\u2019s driving this from the Democrat side that is never going to be reported or commented on, which I\u2019m going to touch on myself today. But, as I say, the purpose of this is to further the narrative that Trump is illegitimate, that he should not be president, that his election was the result of tampering by the Russians. So the objective is that Trump either stops this reform business he\u2019s got, stops this    stuff, and starts letting the Washington Republicans run the town again, or they\u2019re gonna impeach him. That\u2019s the message being sent today: \u201cYou either straighten up and fly right or you\u2019re gone. \u201d \u201cWe\u2019re coming for you,\u201d is the message of these hearings today.
