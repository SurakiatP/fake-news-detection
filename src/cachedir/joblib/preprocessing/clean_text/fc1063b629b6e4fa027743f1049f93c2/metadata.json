[\u201cNow the question is: Are we really going to get it done?\u201d said Matt Schlapp, who leads the ACU, one of the leading conservative group\u2019s in the country and the keeper of the ACU Ratings scorecard.  Schlapp told Boyle that after the political victories of 2016, conservatives gather at CPAC, which opens Wednesday and runs through Saturday morning, to make sure the politicians fulfill the promises made to conservative activists. \u201cHow do we repeal and replace Obamacare? What is the right tax package to get passed into law?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat can we do to stop these regulations? What can we do to keep Americans safe from Islamic terrorists? It is going to be a   of the actual ways that policies getting impacted. \u201d This is not the time for theories, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s real. It\u2019s: What do we have to do now?\u201d Schlapp said. \u201cAs happens every time at CPAC, there\u2019s going to be times when the movement and grassroots activists have to push those in government  \u2014  even those we respect. \u201d The Conservative Political Action Conference began in 1973 as a partnership between the ACU and Young Americans for Freedom. It was part of the same movement by conservatives that supported Rep. John Ashbrook to oppose President Richard Nixon in the 1972 Republican primaries and led to the founding of the Heritage Foundation and the Republican Study Committee. Unlike any other annual political gathering, CPAC has always been full of college and high school students mixing with the activists and the dynamic is about the politicians coming to see the conservatives and make their case \u2014  not the other way around. In addition to Republican office holders, administration officials and conservative thought leaders, Breitbart Technology Editor Milo Yiannopoulos is scheduled to deliver CPAC\u2019s keynote address. Schlapp said with Republicans in control of Congress and the White House, the expectations are very high. Another highlight of the 2017 CPAC is the joint conversation with White House Chief of Staff Reince Preibus and White House Chief Strategist Stephen K. Bannon facilitated by Schlapp. He said: \u201cI think there are a lot of questions that people in the audience probably want me to ask \u2014  like: Hey, how\u2019s it all working up there?\u201d Boyle told Schlapp that he remembered when President Donald Trump spoke at the 2013 CPAC. \u201cHe really lit the room on fire. \u201d Is Trump coming to CPAC this year? he asked Schlapp. \u201cWell, I\u2019m hopeful he\u2019ll be there,\u201d Schlapp said. Trump\u2019s 2016 appearance was canceled at the last minute in favor of a campaign stop. \u201cHe has been to CPAC, I think, for five years or so,\u201d he said. \u201cYou never know what he is going to do, which is why he is a political genius in a lot of ways. I\u2019m hoping he doesn\u2019t just read a script. I hope, if he comes, he speaks from the heart and thanks these activists. \u201cTrump knows these are the activists who helped put him in the White House. \u201d In the   to Wednesday\u2019s CPAC opening Schlapp and his wife Mercedes have their show on SiriusXM\u2019s Patriot Channel 125 \u201cThe Road to CPAC 2017,\u201d where they talk about the conference and what people can expect.
