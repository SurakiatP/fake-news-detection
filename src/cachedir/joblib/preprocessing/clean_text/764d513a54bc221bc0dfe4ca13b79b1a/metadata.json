Arnoldski -  \\n\\n\\nHardly a day goes by without foreign media circulating the false accusations that the leadership of the Syrian Arab Republic is guilty of the deaths of hundreds of thousands and even millions of Syrians. Even authoritative international organizations are cited as the sources of the dissemination of such information. \\nIn July 2013, according to UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon, the death toll in Syria exceeded 100 thousand.  \\nIn October 2014, the Jordanian prince and UN high commissioner for human rights, Zeid Raad al-Hussein, determined the number of people killed in Syria to be 200,000.  \\nBy October 2015, according to UN figures, the number of killed in Syria was more than 240,000. \\nIn September 2016, the UN officially presented the figure of 300,000 Syrians killed and more than half of the Syrian population as refugees. \\nAccording to the Dubai news channel \u201cAl-Arabiya,\u201d in October 2015, the number of killed had already surpassed 250,000. The New York Times produced similar figures. \\nAfter the beginning of the Russian air force\u2019s operation in Syria, the figures of casualties presented by Western sources did not change for the better. Of course, the countries participating in the conflict \u201ccorrect\u201d the data in favor of their interests and many media outlets operate with unverified information from the Supervisory Board on Human Rights of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights created by the opposition. \\nHow objective are these disseminated figures?  \\nThe Russian Institute of Oriental Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences has conducted its own study using data from the Central Statistical Bureau of Syria. This was reported at a press conference entitled \u201cSyria: The Thorny Path to Reconciliation\u201d at the Russia Today media agency by the UN\u2019s senior advisor and representative on Syria, Russian Academy of Science correspondent Vitaliy Naumkin.  \\nIn 2011, the population of Syria amounted to 22.51 million people. According to the figures of the Syrian Central Statistical Bureau, the Syrian Arab Republic\u2019s population has declined to 17.87 million.  \\nGiven the average growth rate of the population excluding refugees, the total number for today was supposed to be 24.64 million people. As of October 20th, 2016, the number of Syrian citizens (including emigrants) is 24.54 million.  \\nGiven correct calculations, the number of Syrians killed over five years of war has been determined, taking into consideration that around 7 million people have left Syria as refugees. \\nAccording to the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the total number of Syrians killed is 105,000. The losses of the government army and militia amount to 45,000. 24,000 militants of terrorist organizations from among the local population have been killed, and 35,000 civilians have been killed. The largest number of civilians have been killed at the hands of jihadists and the so-called \u201cmoderate opposition.\u201d Around 18,000 in Syria have been killed by foreign mercenaries of terrorist groups including citizens from 80 countries.  \\nEarlier, the ex-head of the Israeli secret services Nativ, Yaakov Kedmi, presented almost identical figures of Syrian losses (around 40,000 civilians). \\nAmerican assessments, as a rule, range from several hundred thousand to millions killed, which is beyond the boundaries of reality. \\nBut the point is not even in the statistics. The death of people in principle should not become an object of political speculation or an instrument of information war. American lies on the number of people killed in Syria is doubly disgusting because it is the US that developed and attempted to realize regime-change projects against unfavorable leaders in a number of Middle Eastern and African \u201crouge states\u201d by means of terrorists from \u201cmoderate oppositions\u201d and fomenting civil wars... \\nThe American coalition does not want to publicize the civilian losses resultant of their air strikes on ISIS in Iraq. And yet the coalition has repeatedly hurled accusations against others for losses among the civilian population. During the Iraq War (2003-2011), 460,000 Iraqis were killed. The assault on Mosul is also resulting in many victims among the civilian population. \\nPalestinian political analyst Azzam Abu Saud remarked in the Norwegian newspaper Dagsavisen:  \u201cThe US has made a mass of mistakes in Syria. The war in Syria never would have been so bloody if the US had not supplied weapons to rebels. The US, in addition, created the Islamic State, which has now spun out of their control.\u201d \\nAnother Norwegian publication, ABC Nyheter , adds: \u201cThe US claims that only 55 civilians and 45,000 militants from ISIS and other militant Islamists have been killed as a result of more than 11,000 coalition airstrikes on ISIS targets in Iraq and Syria since 2014\u2026Even when the American leadership is presented with the lists of civilians killed in Syria and Iraq and their photographs, they refuse to acknowledge their deaths.\u201d  \\n\\nThe Russian approach to resolving the Syrian and other Middle Eastern conflicts remains the same: there is no military solution. Success is possible only through dialogue and national reconciliation.  \\n\\n\\n     Follow us on Facebook!                                                   \\n                                                   \\n\\n       Follow us on Twitter! \\n                               \\n\\n             Donate! \\n'"}, "time": 1742561654.991783}
