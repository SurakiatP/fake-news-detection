Mr. Hannity is often very upset, at things like the past friendships of President Barack Obama the suspected political leanings of his former colleague Megyn Kelly the resignation of Michael T. Flynn, President Trump\u2019s former national security adviser and the tweets of media reporters from rival news organizations. But the primary target of his anger in recent days has been Ted Koppel, a veteran news anchor and contributor to \u201cCBS Sunday Morning,\u201d which last weekend broadcast a clip from an interview with Mr. Hannity that the Fox star did not like at all. The interview was conducted by Mr. Koppel roughly three weeks ago, Mr. Hannity said on his show Monday night, and had been presented to him as an opportunity to discuss the political polarization in American life. But only a minute or so of the full interview was used. And it looks as though it may have been the part that Mr. Hannity found the most insulting. The night before the segment aired, CBS News posted online a part of the interview in which Mr. Hannity described his upbringing, which he said shaped his views. But in the televised footage, he was shown complaining about socialism, liberalism and \u201cangry snowflakes,\u201d   slang for liberals that conservatives see as easily upset. Then he led with his chin: Mr. Hannity asked if Mr. Koppel, an elder statesman of broadcast news who hosted the ABC show \u201cNightline\u201d for 25 years, thought he and his show were \u201cbad for America. \u201d Mr. Koppel responded, \u201cYeah. \u201d \u201cReally?\u201d Mr. Hannity responded, his voice rising an octave or two. \u201cThat\u2019s sad, Ted. That\u2019s sad. \u201d Why did Mr. Koppel think Mr. Hannity\u2019s show was bad for America? \u201cYou have attracted people who have determined that ideology is more important than facts,\u201d Mr. Koppel said. He also told Mr. Hannity, an enthusiastic   supporter of President Trump, \u201cYou are very good at what you do. \u201d What Mr. Hannity has done for the last two nights is use his show to put his anger on full display. He has directly addressed Mr. Koppel (\u201cTed, you show in this clip, you are not a journalist,\u201d he said on Monday\u2019s show.) He has denounced the segment as \u201cedited fake news. \u201d He has compared Mr. Koppel to Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton  \u2014   perhaps the worst insult a Fox News host can throw at you. He has also demanded that CBS release the full tape of his interview, which he called \u201da very good, substantive   . \u201d Bill O\u2019Reilly, another Fox host, and Brit Hume, a political analyst at the network, repeated that call on Monday night. So did the conservative commentator Michelle Malkin, who called the    Mr. Koppel \u201cancient\u201d and a \u201cwalking dead decrepit media elitist. \u201d On Tuesday\u2019s broadcast, the conservative radio host Laura Ingraham told Mr. Hannity that he was Mr. Koppel\u2019s \u201cvictim\u201d and said CBS treated him unfairly as a way to protect \u201cthe worldview of the left. \u201d \u201cThey want to delegitimize you,\u201d she said. Mr. Koppel has not responded to Mr. Hannity. A spokesman for CBS News said the network would not respond, either, and also would not release the unedited footage of the interview, which was part of a   segment that was not a profile devoted to Mr. Hannity. Mr. Hannity has turned the slight into a dispute over the intelligence of \u201cthe American people,\u201d which he accused Mr. Koppel of underestimating. He said people were smart enough to know the difference between what he does and a news broadcast. So what does he do? On Monday, Mr. Hannity described himself as \u201ca   host\u201d and \u201can advocacy journalist\u201d who covers stories  \u2014   like President Obama\u2019s ties to \u201cblack liberation theology,\u201d he said in one example  \u2014   that CBS would not touch. But he also used the word \u201cnews\u201d to describe the service he provides his viewers, asking Mr. Koppel, \u201cHow can I be bad for America when I am offering the American people news and information nightly that your own network will not touch because they have an agenda?\u201d Mr. Hannity has never hidden his own conservative beliefs. Immediately before Mr. Koppel\u2019s rebuke, he was describing a   political vision so expansive that he went out of his way to be clear that he did not mean to foment revolution. \u201cHonestly, I think liberalism has to be defeated. Socialism must be defeated  \u2014   in a political sense,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not a  \u2014   we don\u2019t want a revolution in this country. \u201d One of the prime engines of   disloyalty was the media, he said, which he accused of being \u201cout to destroy the president. \u201d He now says Mr. Koppel is doing the same thing to him. \u201cThat\u2019s the difference, Ted, between me and you,\u201d he said on Monday night. \u201cI\u2019m honest with my audience. I don\u2019t pretend that I\u2019m fair and balanced and objective. You do. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562713.1121287}
