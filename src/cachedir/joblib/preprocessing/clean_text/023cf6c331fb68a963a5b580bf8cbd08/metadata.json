Trump as president. In Portland, Ore. the police arrested 29 people while contending with what they described as an \u201caggressive\u201d crowd of about 4, 000 protesters and widespread reports of vandalism, fires and broken windows. \u201cDue to extensive criminal and dangerous behavior, protest is now considered a riot,\u201d the Portland Police Department said on Twitter. Sgt. Pete Simpson, a police spokesman, said Thursday that there were accounts of protesters with bats and drivers being attacked, but there were no reports of injuries. Photos and videos posted to social media showed vandals   buildings and cars, and the police later said on Twitter that they had deployed \u201cless lethal munitions,\u201d including pepper spray and \u201crubber ball distraction devices. \u201d Sergeant Simpson said that the overwhelming number of participants were   citizens but that \u201ca smaller segment are  \u201d who were hiding in the crowd. \u201cWe\u2019re constantly assessing what\u2019s happening and trying to figure out where they\u2019re going next,\u201d he said. Protests took place in other cities, including Baltimore, Denver, Milwaukee, Oakland and Philadelphia. Some demonstrations started early Wednesday after election returns showed the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, losing to Mr. Trump, a Republican. On Twitter on Thursday night, Mr. Trump expressed his dissatisfaction at the protests, which he said were \u201cincited by the media. \u201d On Friday morning, however, Mr. Trump reversed course with a   post on Twitter that praised the demonstrators and echoed the themes of unity he expressed in his victory speech. \u201cLove the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe will all come together and be proud!\u201d Remigio Mateo, 31, a social worker in Los Angeles, said he was stunned by the results and wondered how a candidate who had used such   language during the presidential campaign could win election to the White House. He wanted to be with people who would understand. When a friend mentioned a protest on Wednesday night at City Hall, Mr. Mateo said he knew he needed to be there. \u201cThis election was a real   call that things aren\u2019t anywhere near as progressive as we thought they were,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel confused, disheartened, shocked and afraid of what comes next. I felt I needed to be around others who felt the same way, not only to protest, but to think of how to move forward. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562207.2237673}
