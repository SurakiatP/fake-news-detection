[Sessions will appear on Tuesday before the Committee on Appropriations to testify about the Department of Justice budget.  The ACLU says that it is \u201casking its over 2 million supporters to contact their representatives and urge them to ask Sessions tough questions. \u201d Asked by Breitbart News what the relevance of the Russia investigation was for civil liberties in the United States, Christopher Anders, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s legislative office, said: \u201cIt\u2019s very fundamental to civil liberties, in that it goes right to the heart of our democracy, in our ability to vote, and that our votes are counted and are meaningful. \u201d Russia\u2019s hacking  \u2014   or its attempt to hack  \u2014   political parties and local voter databases \u201craises concerns about integrity of voting and integrity of our elections,\u201d Anders said. Asked whether the ACLU had defended former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, whose telephone calls were under surveillance, and whose name was leaked illegally to the media, Anders acknowledged that the organization had not defended him specifically, adding: \u201cWe haven\u2019t accused Michael Flynn of anything, either. \u201d The ACLU had, Anders pointed out, raised the general issue of surveillance, and was concerned about the   of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which is thought to be the provision under which Flynn\u2019s communications were intercepted. \u201cWe have said there is a good reason to be concerned,\u201d Anders told Breitbart News. \u201cPresident Trump is raising a legitimate issue of concern about Americans\u2019 communications being surveilled, and they shouldn\u2019t be, absent a specific warrant. \u201d In recent months, the ACLU has adopted an aggressive stance against the Trump administration, one very close to the partisan positions of the Democratic Party. It has also organized \u201cResistance training\u201d workshops for activists opposed to the Trump administration\u2019s policies. Noted civil libertarian Alan Dershowitz wrote last month in the Wall Street Journal: The ACLU was once a nonpartisan organization focused on liberty and equality before the law. In recent years it has chosen its battles with an increasingly   sensibility. In doing so, it has become considerably more equivocal and sometimes even hostile toward core civil liberties concerns of free speech and due process. But Anders defended the group\u2019s record, noting that it had supported Republicans like Sen. Rand Paul ( ) on civil liberties issues, and opposed certain policies of Democratic administrations in the past. He stressed the ACLU\u2019s commitment to defending the Constitution. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re here to do, regardless of who\u2019s in power. \u201d Joel B.
