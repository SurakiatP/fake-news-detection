She left four months ago to find work and made it to Miami, where she was legally welcomed. He stayed in Havana, knowing the United States\u2019 special treatment of Cubans gave him the freedom to rejoin her and marry when the moment was right. Those dreams were dashed on Thursday, when President Obama announced the immediate end of the longstanding policy under which any Cuban who made it to American soil was admitted and placed on a glide path to citizenship. \u201cOur relationship has been built on two things: love, and the idea that we will create a life together in the U. S.  \u2014   whether that\u2019s in one year or five,\u201d Mr. Iv\u00e1n said here on Friday. \u201cNow I have to realign my entire life plan. \u201d He is among an untold numbers of Cubans doing so, including what could be thousands stranded midjourney, whether by boat or by land, often through Mexico. Those who arrived at border stations in Arizona, California and Texas on Thursday were let in. Those still on the Mexican side were left to consider whether to try to sneak across or hire smugglers to take them into a country that as of Friday would treat them as illegal entrants, just like those from other countries. Alexander Iglesias Rodr\u00edguez, 41, a veterinarian who reared cows in Cienfuegos on Cuba\u2019s southern coast, left the country on Wednesday, six weeks after his wife and his son, Gabriel, 16. They flew to Mexico and then crossed the border in Matamoros. He delayed his departure so as not to draw attention from immigration authorities in Cuba and Mexico. He sold his 1956 Pontiac, his   head of cattle and his   house, pulling together about $12, 000. He was in Mexico about to cross into the United States when the order came down. \u201cSo many years dreaming about this,\u201d Mr. Iglesias said. Now he is in limbo, unsure if he should wait or make a stab at seeking asylum in the United States, a request the government does not always grant. \u201cWhat do I have in Cuba? Nothing. My wife is in the United States. My son is in the United States. I sold everything I had. I can\u2019t go back. \u201d Also eliminated on Thursday was a program that allowed Cuban doctors posted to other countries to more easily migrate to America, leaving Ayme Monges, 25, stuck in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, on Friday with all her paperwork in order but nowhere to go. \u201cI got to the embassy this morning and they said, \u2018You are Cuban? You can\u2019t pass. That program is frozen,\u2019\u201d Dr. Monges, who had been working in Venezuela, said in a phone interview. \u201cI am stranded here in this country. \u201d The number of Cubans leaving for America has surged since the two governments resumed relations in late 2014, in expectation that the policy  \u2014   known as \u201cwet foot, dry foot\u201d because those caught at sea were sent back but those who made it to dry land were allowed to stay  \u2014   might end. A senior official with the Department of Homeland Security, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in keeping with agency policy, said the administration decided to end the program immediately to prevent a mass exodus that would risk lives at land and sea. In Cuba, the abrupt change seemed to further divide people along generational lines. Many older Cubans said the decision was a just one that would halt the steady drain of the nation\u2019s citizens  \u2014   especially educated ones like doctors  \u2014   to America. One man, selling copies of the   newspaper Granma on the street, said the measure was necessary to stop \u201cundermining the Cuban government\u201d by enticing people to \u201cthrow their fates to the sea. \u201d But younger Cubans, for whom the prospect of a life in America offers a glimmer of hope amid economic hardship, were crushed, forced to envision a future with fewer options. Cuban identity, and pride, is in no small part forged by its relationship with the United States, both in the tiny country\u2019s defiance of its bigger neighbor and then in the unique privileges afforded to those who fled and made it to America. To be suddenly placed on equal footing with the millions of others around the world hoping to do the same was an especially hard fall. In Havana, where until recently the internet has been out of reach for most ordinary Cubans, the city\u2019s relatively new   parks have become stations of despair following the announcement. For a nation robbed of connectivity for more than a decade, the sudden surge of digital news  \u2014   through email, messaging and social media  \u2014   seemed like a particularly cruel way to find out their special treatment had ended. A few blocks from the American Embassy, in the neighborhood of Vedado, the casual atmosphere changed suddenly as the news began to spread. Visitors checking their phones shared the news with those within shouting distance. One youth yelled to the gathered crowds: \u201cHave you heard? This screws up all your lives. \u201d Miguel Alberto Escalona, 24, sat with his wife in a park in Vedado, bewildered. He sent a text to his family in Miami decrying the change. The news also brought to the surface frustrations for young Cubans, especially concerning the new dynamic that an increase in tourism is bringing to the nation. Food prices have surged to meet the demand, while what scant resources the country are redirected to the   outsiders now flooding Cuba, especially Americans. \u201cI\u2019m totally against the change in the law,\u201d Mr. Escalona wrote to his family. \u201cHere in Cuba, we have nothing to live for. Our country is for foreigners, not for our people, no wonder people want to leave. \u201d For years, most Cubans have been willing to overlook that the policy was unfair to other nationalities, especially to Central Americans, many of whom were fleeing violence at home. But for many on Friday, having had the policy and suddenly losing it was somehow worse, especially if you were in the midst of planning an escape. One young man, who was building his own boat to take to America, sat in the Vedado park, stunned. He said he was nearly finished with the boat, and his departure had been imminent. Those plans now dashed, he began browsing the web for a prospective bride, suggesting he would pay up to $3, 000 to any woman willing to marry him and bring him to the United States. \u201cMy plan A was to leave in a boat,\u201d he said with a rueful smile. \u201cSo I guess my plan B is to marry an American woman. \u201d While Mr. Obama\u2019s announcement was met with chagrin among some groups in Cuba, the government applauded the change in American policy, which they have long complained about, especially the program allowing Cuban doctors to immigrate to the United States. Since the program began 10 years ago, nearly 10, 000 Cuban medical professionals have been approved for residency in the United States. Many of them were Cuban doctors sent on medical missions to friendly countries like Venezuela, a program that critics of the Cuban government likened to human trafficking, since the government took in billions of dollars a year in fees from the doctors\u2019 host countries. For those without a career path, the loss of an American escape hatch left them with even fewer employment options. It struck especially hard on those, like Mr. Iv\u00e1n, with deep ties to family and loved ones in the United States. (He declined to be identified by his full name for fear of reprisal by the Cuban government.) His brother made the trek four years ago, through Mexico, and is now living the American dream: a mortgage, a car and a job that pays him a living wage. Now, Mr. Iv\u00e1n is left with a   remorse for having not acted sooner. And he wonders if he will ever be reunited with his girlfriend. On Friday morning, he was even having trouble reaching her, given the   communication in Cuba. He checked his phone incessantly, hoping for a text from her. \u201cWith each blow like this, I feel farther and farther away from you,\u201d he typed to her, frustrated about the shaky   connection. Accepting the reality of the new situation, and without a plan, he sent another message: \u201cI want you to know that no matter what happens, I will always love you. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628601.5597954}
