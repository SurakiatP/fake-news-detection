In July, we circulated the letter as widely as possible. Doris and I volunteered to cosponsor a fundraiser for Ellison in our home on 24 July with our neighbors Dave Holets and his wife Nancy Arneson. Dave, already retired, had been in charge of managing the finances of the School of Physics and Astronomy. Together, we leafleted the immediate neighborhood with invitations to the fundraiser. \\nOn 21 and 22 July, I went into St. Louis Park, a suburb just west of the city line, a block and a half from our home, to do door knocking. When someone appeared at the door, I would begin by introducing myself by name. I was not surprised when one of the first responses I got was, \u201cOh, you\u2019re the Communist at the University of Minnesota.\u201d Two or three others recognized me in a similar manner. The fact that I was campaigning for Ellison did not seem to bother any of them. \u201d (emphasis added) \\nWatch this clip on Keith Ellison from Trevor Loudon\u2019s film, The Enemies Within: 0'"}, "time": 1742628569.1807225}
