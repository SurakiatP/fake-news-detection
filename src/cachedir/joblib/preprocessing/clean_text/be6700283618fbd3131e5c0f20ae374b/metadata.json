Hope you can join us for some post-Halloween fun at our meetup on Wednesday, November 2. \\nSteve in Dallas has graciously arranged for us to convene at \\nCantina Laredo 4546 Belt Line Rd Dallas, TX 75244 \\nWe\u2019ll start at 5:00 PM. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be there until at least 8 PM. \\nLooking forward to another engaging and enjoyable event. I am flying into Dallas that AM, so the only caveat is that if the Dallas or NY airports are reported to be having serious problems in the morning, you might double check the site for updates (although I think you should plan on meeting regardless even if I wind up being delayed). See you soon! 0 0 0 0 0 0 This entry was posted in Notices on'"}, "time": 1742562743.7320957}
