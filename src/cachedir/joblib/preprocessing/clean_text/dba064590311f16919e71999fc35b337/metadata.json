In spite of the efforts by the Zio media to divert voter attention to Donald Trump\u00e2\\x80\\x99s alleged problems with women, Hillary\u00e2\\x80\\x99s treasonous crimes are increasingly difficult to hide. \\nThe fact is that Hillary should be prosecuted, not inaugurated. She has supported ISIS in its war against Syria its terrorism against America. She has sent paid thugs to disrupt Trump\u00e2\\x80\\x99s political events. She has used her government positions to peddal influence. She really should be in prison. \\nThis is an extremely educating and enlightening show. Please share it widely.'"}, "time": 1742562210.0472372}
