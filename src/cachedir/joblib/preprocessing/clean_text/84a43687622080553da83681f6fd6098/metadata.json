Michael Werz, an expert on Turkey who used to work for Podesta\u2019s Center for American Progress, told Podesta that the \u201cErdogan faction\u201d was making investments in Democratic candidates such as Clinton. \\n\u201cAm told that the Erdogan crew also tries to make inroads via donations to Democratic candidates, including yours,\u201d Werz told Podesta. \u201cTwo names that you should be aware of are Mehmet Celebi and Ali Cinar.\u201d \\nWerz, who did not respond to a request for comment, wrote that the \u201cErdogan faction is making substantial investments in U.S. to counter opposition (CHP, Kurds, G\u00fclenists etc.) outreach to policymakers and USG.\u201d \\nPodesta forwarded the email to Dennis Cheng , who runs the campaign\u2019s fundraising operation. \\nThe email was posted online by Wikileaks. The U.S. director of national intelligence and the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security have accused \u201cRussia\u2019s senior-most officials\u201d of hacking and leaking the emails to influence the 2016 election. \\nAli Cinar, one of the men Werz warned about, had already given Clinton $2,700 three months earlier in May. This year, Cinar gave an additional $2,000 to Clinton this August and $500 more in September. \\nCinar has also given $1,080 to the Democratic National Committee this cycle. \\nThe Clinton campaign would not answer questions on the donations from Cinar. \\nCinar is currently president of the Turkish Heritage Organization, a recognized non-profit based in the United States that was recently probed by the FBI after hacked emails from the Erdogan administration revealed that the group was lobbying on behalf of the Turkish presidency in the United States.
