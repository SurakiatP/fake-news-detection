Now we have a snapshot of how that same bias worked with jobs. \\nAccording to an email chain from 2008, John Podesta received lists of exclusively Muslims and Asians to be considered for jobs in the Obama administration. The email chain revealed that in this process, Middle Eastern Christians were purposefully excluded, or set aside in a separate list, with an aide writing, \\nIn the candidates for top jobs, I excluded those with some Arab American background but who are not Muslim (e.g., George Mitchell). Many Lebanese Americans, for example, are Christian. In the last list (of outside boards/commissions), most who are listed appear to be Muslim American, except that a handful (where noted) may be Arab American but of uncertain religion (esp. Christian). \\nRemember all that outrage over how un-American religious tests are? Religious tests that preference Muslims are how Obama Inc. does business. \\nNote especially the \"uncertain religion\" part. This is how religious tests work.'"}, "time": 1742561731.2529435}
