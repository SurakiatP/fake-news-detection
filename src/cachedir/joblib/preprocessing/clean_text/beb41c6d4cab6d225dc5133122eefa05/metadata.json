John Kasich ( ) a former candidate for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination, said it was \u201cnot acceptable\u201d for Republicans in Washington, DC to completely \u201cget rid\u201d of the Affordable Care Act.  Kasich said, \u201cI mean there\u2019s going to be a problem in the House of getting anything out of there that still provides coverage to people. That\u2019s why the Republicans have to reach out to some of the Democrats.
