[Williams hijacked Maddow\u2019s show to break the news of the U. S. missile strike on Syria earlier this month when he told her at the end of the broadcast while on air, \u201cThanks for visiting tonight. Glad you were a part of our coverage. \u201d  MSNBC president Phil Griffin was reportedly furious at Williams for how he treated Maddow, the New York Post\u2019s \u201cPage Six\u201d reported. \u201cPhil gave Brian a very stern rebuke, telling him, \u2018Don\u2019t you ever do that again.\u2019 But Rachel didn\u2019t seem bothered by it and just laughed it off,\u201d a source told \u201cPage Six. \u201d The former NBC Nightly News anchor was in charge of MSNBC\u2019s coverage of the U. S. Navy\u2019s Tomahawk missile strike on Syria, which cut into Maddow\u2019s nightly program \u201cThe Rachel Maddow Show. \u201d Viewers objected to Williams\u2019 perceived intrusion into Maddow\u2019s turf and his observation that the video footage of the missiles being launched was \u201cbeautiful\u201d on the April 6 broadcast. \u201cNot only did Brian go way over the top with his coverage of the missile strike, he then totally patronized Rachel by thanking her for \u2018visiting\u2019 her own show and being \u2018a part\u2019 of his \u2018beautiful\u2019 coverage! Has he not learned anything from \u2018 \u2019?\u201d a source from MSNBC said. Williams was suspended from NBC Nightly News and later fired in 2015 after he \u201cmisremembered\u201d details of his experiences covering the Iraq War in 2003, the Daily Mail reported. He returned to the air as a breaking news anchor in September 2015 and host of an 11 p. m.   hour.    '"}, "time": 1742563324.7926202}
