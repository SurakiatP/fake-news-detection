[The veteran actor and Breitbart News contributor began his speech by asking how many CPAC attendees were Trump supporters from the very first day he announced  \u2014   a few raised their hands. When he asked how many were Trump supporters now, the room exploded in cheers.  \u201cI\u2019m thrilled to be here with all of you, and I have to say how moved I am to see how many young people are engaged,\u201d Davi began. \u201cYou are the future of this country. And you\u2019ve gotta be engaged, and you have to understand how important this moment of your history is, because this nation belongs to you. \u201d The   \u201cBond    host\u201d continued by referring to a Breitbart News article he had written on June 16, 2015, the day that Trump announced his bid for the presidency. Davi said that former President George H. W. Bush\u2019s 1988 campaign marked the beginning of a \u201cshift\u201d toward what became a   era of globalist policies that ultimately weakened the country. Davi argued that Bush\u2019s campaign slogan, \u201cA kinder, gentler nation,\u201d was not the kind of message the United States needed after eight years of President Ronald Reagan\u2019s bold reforms. \u201cGeorge Bush is a good man. But that was the globalist flag [being] put in the ground. That was the beginning of it all,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter Reagan we\u2019ve had Bush, Clinton, Bush Two, Obama. We needed a force of nature to take the ship back. \u201d Later in his speech, Davi criticized the news media, which he said he had seen been manipulated for years. \u201cThere are good people. I respect everyone\u2019s living, everyone\u2019s point of view, that\u2019s what America is about,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I understand when I see the vitriol, and the continued misrepresentation of certain things, or the exaggeration of certain things, carried to a point that they shouldn\u2019t be  \u2014   and that\u2019s what we see happening now. \u201d \u201cEvery media outlet is saying, \u2018The first hundred days  \u2026   \u2019\u201d he added. \u201cWell, he\u2019s only been in office   days. It\u2019s not a hundred days! And look what\u2019s been accomplished! Look what the future is going to be. \u201d Davi concluded his speech by quoting the late Red Skelton\u2019s commentary on the Pledge of Allegiance, suggesting that young people and unassimilated immigrants today lack the patriotism that was so vital in building the country. \u201c\u2018Indivisible\u2019  \u2014   incapable of being divided. \u2018With liberty,\u2019 which is freedom, the right to live one\u2019s own life without threats, fear or some form of retaliation,\u201d Davi said. \u201c\u2018Justice\u2019  \u2014   the principle equality of dealing fairly with others. \u2018For all,\u2019 which means boys and girls it\u2019s as much your country as it is mine. \u201d He then led the audience in the Pledge of Allegiance.
