Scheduled to be released Oct. 7, the film is now attracting unwanted attention because of renewed interest in a    case in which the film\u2019s director, writer and star, Nate Parker, was accused  \u2014   and later acquitted  \u2014   of rape when he was a student at Penn State. His college roommate, Jean McGianni Celestin, who received a credit on the movie, was also charged. Last week Deadline. com and Variety asked Mr. Parker about the case, and on Tuesday, Variety reported that his accuser committed suicide in 2012 at age 30. In a statement to The New York Times, the woman\u2019s family said: \u201cWe appreciate that after all this time, these men are being held accountable for their actions. However, we are dubious of the underlying motivations that bring this to present light after 17 years, and we will not take part in stoking its coals. While we cannot protect the victim from this media storm, we can do our best to protect her son. For that reason, we ask for privacy for our family and do not wish to comment further. \u201d But the woman\u2019s sister, Sharon Loeffler, said that statement did not represent the sentiments of other family members or the woman herself. \u201cI know what she would\u2019ve said,\u201d Ms. Loeffler said, \u201cand that would be, \u2018I fought long and hard, it overcame me. All I can ask is any other victims to come forward, and not let this kind of tolerance to go on anymore. \u2019\u201d Ms. Loeffler said her sister had believed there were other victims and had been broken by the 1999 case and its aftermath. \u201cThese guys sucked the soul and life out of her. \u201d Mr. Parker took to Facebook on Tuesday evening to say he had just learned of the death and was filled with sorrow. \u201cI can\u2019t help but think of all the implications this has for her family. I cannot  \u2014   nor do I want to ignore the pain she endured during and following our trial. \u201d He maintained his innocence, but added that he wished he had been more empathetic at the time, writing: \u201cThere are things more important than the law. There is morality,\u201d and adding, \u201cI look back on that time as a teenager and can say without hesitation that I should have used more wisdom. \u201d Here\u2019s a look at the case. WHAT WE KNOW Mr. Parker was accused in 1999 of raping a fellow student at Penn State. The victim, whose name is not public, said that Mr. Parker and his roommate, Mr. Celestin, raped her while she was intoxicated and unconscious, according to court documents, and that they later harassed, intimidated and stalked her after she pressed charges. Both men said that the sex was consensual. Mr. Parker, who, according to court transcripts, had had consensual oral sex with the woman previously, was acquitted of the charges. Mr. Celestin, who received a \u201cstory by\u201d credit on \u201cThe Birth of a Nation,\u201d was convicted of sexual assault, but his case was appealed. There are conflicting accounts about the outcome. The woman, under the name Jane Doe, then sued Penn State for failing to protect her from harassment the case was settled for $17, 500. According to court records, the victim had twice attempted suicide after the alleged rape. According to a court document, as a result of the harassment, the accuser \u201csuffered severe depression, sleeplessness, and anxiety attacks. \u201d She also said that her apartment had been broken into and that her files on the case had been \u201cdisturbed. \u201d On Tuesday, it emerged that the woman killed herself in 2012, overdosing on sleeping pills, according to Variety\u2019s interview with her brother. WHAT MR. PARKER HAS SAID ABOUT THE CASE In an interview with The Times last weekend on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Mass. where he was appearing with Spike Lee at a film festival, Mr. Parker said that he had never wanted to hide his past, and that he had made a conscious decision not to change his Wikipedia page, which included references to the 1999 case. \u201cI talked about it publicly and I never sought to hide it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was the most painful thing I have ever had to experience. I can imagine it was painful for a lot of people. \u201d He also said that he \u201cwelcomed the conversation. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a serious issue. I get it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reality is there is a problem on campuses in America, and violence against women is not taken seriously enough. And the dialogue and the discourse isn\u2019t loud enough. I think there\u2019s even more that can be done to educate university students, men and women. Being a father of daughters\u201d  \u2014   he has five daughters, three with his wife  \u2014   \u201cit\u2019s important to say if something happened, to lift your voice. \u201d He later said: \u201cThey say the oppressor is anyone who\u2019s not on the side of the oppressed. I stand firmly on the side of the oppressed. \u201d Asked if justice had been served in the case, he replied: \u201cI was cleared of all charges. We\u2019re talking 17 years later. We\u2019re discussing a case which was thoroughly litigated. I was cleared of everything. At some point I have to ask myself, \u2018How often am I willing to relive it? \u2019\u201d WHY THIS IS A STORY NOW Backed by Fox Searchlight, Mr. Parker has just embarked on an extensive campaign to promote the film, and media scrutiny is heightened. While the case was written about in 1999 in local newspapers and in a 2007 profile of Mr. Parker in The   it only garnered widespread attention after Deadline published details from the court transcripts. \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d tells the story of Nat Turner, who led a slave rebellion in Virginia in 1831. The film was first screened at the Sundance Film Festival this year, shortly after the   slate of Oscar acting nominees set off an outcry as well as a larger conversation about the lack of diversity in Hollywood. Almost everything about the film seemed a remedy to all that, including its name, a sharply pointed reappropriation (not a remake) of D. W. Griffith\u2019s landmark and racist 1915 film of the same title. Born into poverty, Mr. Parker, whose previous films include \u201cThe Secret Life of Bees,\u201d \u201cRed Tails\u201d and \u201cBeyond the Lights,\u201d had made telling Turner\u2019s story a passion project, even turning down other work. He wanted Americans to face the legacy of slavery head on, and said the country\u2019s aversion to doing so led to countless   problems, including tensions between the police and black Americans. Support for the film surged. Last weekend, at the film festival on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Mr. Parker and his   Aja Naomi King, appeared on a panel with Mr. Lee, who urged audience members to pack the theaters when it opens. At Sundance in January, Mr. Parker received a standing ovation from a packed audience before the film began. Afterward, there was a bidding war, with Fox Searchlight emerging the victor and paying a festival record for the right to distribute the drama. This week Variety reported that in light of new attention around Mr. Parker over the rape case, Fox Searchlight would be changing its release plans and possibly refusing to grant more interviews with Mr. Parker for a few weeks, but a studio spokesman said Tuesday that those suggestions were untrue and that the release and marketing of the film would go ahead as planned.'"}, "time": 1742628341.6210167}
