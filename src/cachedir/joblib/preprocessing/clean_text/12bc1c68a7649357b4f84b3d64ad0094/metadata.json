The Stalin period is surely one of the most complex in modern history, as Stalin ruled the Soviet Union under conditions of extreme Western hostility and outright warfare against the young socialist federation for most of his tenure. Yet, there is little doubt that Josef Stalin was\u2014for all his flaws, real and mostly invented and augmented\u2014a firm and colossal enemy of capitalism, a formidable obstacle to the victory of the \u201cWall Street way of life\u201d around the globe and that he did succeed in shaping the USSR into a superpower capable of surviving and rendering help to weaker nations shedding brutal Western colonialism. That, and not the \u201ccrimes of Stalin\u201d is the real source for the undying hatred and nonstop shabby malicious slandering we observe to this day against his legacy (the demonization of Putin, a much milder irritant to the Washington elites should give us some insight into the depths of this imposture) both in the corporate media and political class, but unworthy of repetition among people who should know better or who like to think of themselves as leftist. What use is the anti-communist left in a world on the brink of extinction because of a semi-deranged, hegemonic-at-all-costs runaway imperialism?\u2014P. Greanville Dateline: October 27, 2016 In his latest Sputnik Radio International interview Srdja Trifkovic discusses the Czech Republic government\u2019s establishment of an information unit to counter what it says is pro-Russian, anti-Western and anti-NATO propaganda. \u201cWe want to get into every smartphone,\u201d said Milan Chovanec, the Czech interior minister. Audio (unedited verbatim transcript) Klaus: Speaking truth to the annoyance of the NATO-bought political prostitutes running the Czech state these days. ST: It is strangely reminiscent of the old Soviet times, when any criticism of Soviet policies was termed \u201canti-Soviet propaganda,\u201d and was ascribed to some mysterious imperialist forces in the West that were out to subvert the Soviet Union and its \u201cFraternal Community of Socialist Nations.\u201d It is rather funny that\u2014more than a quarter of a century after the end of the Cold War\u2014we see the exact replica of the mindset, and a state-financed reaction, on the side of the so-called liberal-democratic, free-market-oriented, \u201cWestern\u201d members of NATO. It is also significant that one of the foremost critics of the Western policies in general, and in Ukraine in particular, is Vaclav Klaus, one of the most respected Czech politicians. My immediate thought is whether they regard Mr. Klaus\u2014the elder statesman of the Czech Republic\u2014as one of the exponents of the Russian propaganda who needs to be monitored and countered. My second thought is that, ultimately, it comes to the quality of information and analysis. If the makers of this new unit, fighting what they regard as Russian disinformation, are up against certain perfectly justified, rational, and well-reasoned criticism of Western policies, and those of NATO in particular, then they have a big problem. In this time and age, of the mainstream media being confronted by the social media, the Internet, they will have a problem, because the unspoken assumption is that the quality of information and analysis they can offer is better than what they regard as the Russian propaganda. As it happens, we have this counter-propaganda all the time, in the pages of the New York Times and the Washington Post , on the BBC, the CNN, and every flickering screen and every printed page all over the Western world. And yet . . . they are not doing a very good job. Ultimately, if we are looking at an informed and rational consumer of information, he or she will be able to make an astute judgment of who is in the right and who is actually a propagandist. Q: Srdja, if they consider this to be so important at this particular moment, why is this unit made up of only twenty people? ST: It could made up of only two people if they are well informed, capable of top-class analysis, and if they have strong arguments which can be used to counter what they regard as Russian disinformation. It boils down to what I mentioned earlier: the quality of information, and the quality of analysis. Q: Is it going to have any influence on anything at all? ST: Ultimately not. Obviously, the same job is being done by much better paid columnists of the Washington Post , the Guardian , Le Monde , the Frankfurter Rundschau \u2014they are all up to the same thing: to discredit arguments against the global empire of the United States and its fellow travelers in Western Europe. If that job is not done much better by people who are paid hundreds of thousands of dollars or euros every year to do it in a systematic and coherent way, I don\u2019t see any way for a bunch of twenty Czech bureaucrats to do it. Q: Let\u2019s get back to the accusations that some Czech politicians have been throwing at Moscow, that they are forming the networks of pro-Russian groups that can be used to destabilize the country. How grounded are these accusations? ST: It reminds one of McCarthyism in the United States in the early 1950\u2019s. If you are a \u201cdeviant\u201d in your mindset, if you dare criticize the official line, if you say things that are outside the permitted parameters of rightspeak, then you must be an agent for a foreign power. It is a paranoid mindset, it is deeply antidemocratic, and it smacks of Stalinism. This is, of course, Stalinism in a postmodern-liberal guise, but it is not qualitatively different from the original model.
