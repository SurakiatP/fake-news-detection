Now he is moving on. Instead of polishing his carefully created New England sensibility and hovering over the obsessive   platform on which he built Cook\u2019s Illustrated magazine and its offspring, Mr. Kimball is loosening his bow tie and shifting his culinary worldview. His new project is called Milk Street Kitchen. With $6 million from investors and more at the ready, Mr. Kimball is remodeling the ground floor of the Flour  Grain Exchange building on Milk Street in the financial district here in Boston. In the fall, he plans to publish a new magazine, shoot a public television series and begin writing books. He\u2019ll start a cooking school, and promote the whole enterprise at a dozen live road shows. He is even designing a chef\u2019s knife to sell. The big idea is to bring techniques from the world\u2019s kitchens to America\u2019s Wednesday night dinner table. It\u2019s a bold pivot for a man whose magazines rarely showcased ethnic recipes. \u201cIt\u2019s not looking around the world and doing a tagine or a couscous dish,\u201d he said of the concept. \u201cIt\u2019s looking around the world and seeing how people are thinking about food. \u201d Instead of using Eurocentric techniques that rely on concentrating flavors through long applications of heat, Mr. Kimball is exploring ways to build dishes that rely on texture, spice and freshness. Instead of making chicken stock like a frugal French cook who simmers bones and scraps for hours, why not boil a whole chicken for just an hour like a Chinese cook, using ginger, scallions and herbs to elicit a more delicate flavor? Mr. Kimball, who lives in Boston and Vermont, has been cooking this way at home for the last few years. He has become a student of spice and of authors like Yotam Ottolenghi. He has taken inspiration from his travels, too. Sliced oranges coated in cold caramel sauce flavored with star anise  \u2014   a dessert inspired by a trip to Rome with his four children  \u2014   is much more interesting to him these days than apple pie. \u201cI don\u2019t think I have anything left to add about how to make an oatmeal cookie,\u201d he said. If it works, Mr. Kimball will cement his reputation as an intellectual and business powerhouse of American recipes. But if it fails? \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst that can happen?\u201d he asked over dinner in Cambridge one evening. \u201cPublic humiliation?\u201d The move is certainly a gamble. Mr. Kimball, who is worth tens of millions of dollars, turns 65 this month. Although he can be tender in person, his public demeanor is stern and sometimes awkward. He is the guy in the room who always knows more than you, a fan of rabbit hunting and classic literature who is more closely associated with roast turkey and root vegetables than with Mexican street food and Israeli hummus. Even he worries how that persona will translate into a new brand focused on global flavors. He doesn\u2019t want to come off as a latecomer in a nation that has already moved past its   perspective. It doesn\u2019t help that cooks like Rick Bayless, the white chef who has become an authority on Mexican cooking, are being swept up in a battle over cultural appropriation. \u201cWe\u2019re not translating the ethnic soul of a community,\u201d Mr. Kimball said. \u201cWe\u2019re just saying this is a good idea. You need someone who knows a fair amount about cooking to do this, who has the thoughtfulness and testing to translate Thai cooking to our kitchens. \u201d Corby Kummer, the   food writer, has never been a big fan. \u201cHe has a tendency to flatten things out, and that can be dull,\u201d Mr. Kummer said. But, he added, Mr. Kimball has great value as someone who offers authority and reassurance. \u201cIf he can do that with newer flavors and make the cooks who look to him for that reassurance understand a new way to cook, more power to him,\u201d he said. Mr. Kimball is building his venture with a small crew who followed him out of America\u2019s Test Kitchen, chief among them Melissa Baldino, a former executive producer who was once his assistant. She married Mr. Kimball a year after he divorced his second wife in 2012. It\u2019s a loyal team, and   veterans are betting that Milk Street Kitchen will succeed. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge mistake to write off Chris Kimball,\u201d said Rux Martin, the cookbook editor who has her own imprint at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. \u201cHe\u2019s always been really good at following where the money is coming from, based on what people want. \u201d Mr. Kimball\u2019s first venture publishing reliable recipes with a wonky specificity came in 1980, when he used $100, 000 from investors to start Cook\u2019s Magazine. He went on to sell it for a big profit to Cond\u00e9 Nast Publications, which later shut it down. He bought back the title for $175 and reintroduced it as Cook\u2019s Illustrated in 1993. It was a    antithesis of Gourmet magazine and took no ads. It still doesn\u2019t. If you wanted to know how to make perfect Bolognese in a slow cooker or a foolproof pie crust (pro tip: use vodka) here it was. His approach ushered in an era of intellectual cookbook authors who preferred analysis to romance. Among the magazine\u2019s alumni are Mark Bittman, a former New York Times columnist, and J. Kenji   the author of \u201cThe Food Lab,\u201d who developed the vodka pie crust during his time at Cook\u2019s Illustrated. America\u2019s Test Kitchen, which includes the magazine Cook\u2019s Country as well as radio and television programs, is built on a culture of testing so rigorous that it can border on fetish. And when other food websites were offering free content, Mr. Kimball insisted on paid subscriptions. \u201cIt all comes from Chris\u2019s idea that you can\u2019t give anything away,\u201d said John Willoughby, the first executive editor of Cook\u2019s Illustrated and now its executive editor for magazines. The schism, by all accounts, was painful. Mr. Kimball said he saw it coming during a board meeting last July. The company had grown to 180 people, and the board of Boston Common Press, which owns America\u2019s Test Kitchen, thought a new management style was in order. Although America\u2019s Test Kitchen was doing very well financially, the initial investors wanted more profit. They added new board members who were aligned with that goal. David Nussbaum, a former media and   executive, was hired as the company\u2019s chief executive, outranking Mr. Kimball. \u201cQuite frankly, the owners realized Chris is about 65, and they had to think of a   succession plan,\u201d Mr. Nussbaum said in an interview. \u201cThese owners were very clear they wanted someone to come and run the business for their heirs. \u201d They asked Mr. Kimball to continue hosting the television and radio shows, and suggested that he write a memoir, Mr. Kimball said. As an owner, he would reap the financial rewards of the company\u2019s expansion. Mr. Kimball balked. \u201cYou end up as the guy in the white suit standing in front of the bucket of chicken,\u201d he said. Things got worse fast. One day last August, Mr. Kimball walked into Mr. Willoughby\u2019s office. \u201cI got fired,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you could,\u201d Mr. Willoughby said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I could, either,\u201d Mr. Kimball replied. The new leadership put some of its   product reviews outside the subscription pay wall. Editors began creating a free digital magazine and a traveling road show based on the success of the 2012 book \u201cThe Science of Good Cooking. \u201d The hunt is on to find a bigger space and hire more digitally savvy employees. Mr. Nussbaum said America\u2019s Test Kitchen, with its 50 recipe testers, would stay close to what he called a Consumer Reports point of view, but \u201chaving said that, the world in which we eat has continued to change, and America\u2019s Test Kitchen wants to participate in that change. \u201d He and Mr. Kimball continue to speak well of each other, at least to a reporter. They had lunch recently. Mr. Kimball may do work for America\u2019s Test Kitchen, which still provides much of his income. He seems happy to be starting something new. \u201cI like to get up in the morning and go to work,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think there is still a substantial audience for that work. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564503.7872818}
