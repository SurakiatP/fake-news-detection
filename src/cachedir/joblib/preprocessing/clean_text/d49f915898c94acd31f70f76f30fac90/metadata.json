It seems that Europe\u2019s technocrats have truly surrendered to their own program of \u2018Euro Red Scare\u2019 brainwashing. \\nThe new EU Resolution compares Russian media organizations to terrorist groups like ISIS (see full report below). The report also claims that Russian \u201c social media and internet trolls \u201d are somehow \u201c challenging democratic values .\u201d The new anti-Russia legislation will now require many millions in funding to implement all of the \u2018anti-Russia\u2019 programs that bureaucrats believe are needed to counter this \u2018grave threat to democracy.\u2019 A touch oxymoronic, isn\u2019t it? \\nEU Parliamentarians appear to have lost the plot. Claiming that Europe is currently \u2018at war with Russia\u2019 is one thing, but the hysterical notion that \u201cRussian propaganda\u201d is somehow damaging the minds of Europeans is a whole new level of crazy. \\nNo wonder millions of Britons voted to leave the EU this past summer. \\nThe cold reality is that most of the \u2018dangerous views and information\u2019 aired on RT are by presenters, contributors and pundits \u2014 westerners , not Russians. The reason RT\u2019s audience ratings are growing is because the version of news and analysis being presented is resonating with international audiences who see RT\u2019s reports as more accurate, and truthful than media monoliths like the BBC, CNN and other establishment outlets. By spending most of their time, effort and budgets crafting propaganda pieces to cover for the plethora of lies and clandestine operations globally, the western media are killing off their own relationship with domestic audiences. The age of talking down to the public and assuming them as fools is over. RT understood this in 2005 when their news network took shape. 11 years later, western media moguls are playing catch-up, albeit in vain.Sunset for Goebbels. Hamstrung with layers of management and editorial committees infested with intelligence agency operatives and journalists on the payroll of a Deep State star chamber that is so tangled in its own web of subterfuge \u2013 obsessed with controlling real information, rather than disseminating it \u2013 that their media environment has become too dysfunctional for its own good. They are simply unable to do authentic journalism, or speak truth to power . Incredibly, instead of working to help western media to phase out its own propaganda regime, ideologues in Brussels want to attack RT. \\nThe faceless force behind this latest xenophobic EU resolution are those in Washington, Paris and London who are still hell-bent on keeping anti-Russian economic sanctions in place \u2013 much to the disservice of many European businesses and their workers who are losing out on trade with Russia. When Donald Trump is sworn in this January, the US-UK-EU anti-Russian axis could disintegrate within a year \u2013 so this latest move by Brussels could be a last-ditch effort to do some damage as Europe\u2019s NeoMcCarthyites plot their escape out the back door. From their disastrous coup d\u2019etat in the Ukraine , to NATO\u2019s hubris in the Baltic and beyond, and the EU\u2019s \u2018migrant crisis\u2019 debacle, and the tens of millions of Euros being laundered by EU member states through a pseudo NGO called the \u2018 White Helmets\u2019 in Syria \u2013 these last 3 years will certainly go down as one of the worst chapters in modern diplomatic history \u2013 an abject failure of incompetent foreign policy, underpinned by a backward and confused ideology. \\nWe tried to find a coherent western reporting on this subject, but it seems even the western mainstream are too embarrassed to cover this bizarre Brussels adventure. See the following video and written report by RT International\u2026 \\n. RT MEPs in Strasbourg have voted on a non-legislative resolution which calls for the EU to \u201crespond to information warfare by Russia.\u201d RT and Sputnik news agency are alleged to be among the most dangerous \u201ctools\u201d of \u201chostile propaganda.\u201d \\nThe EU Parliament\u2019s resolution demonstrates \u201c political degradation \u201d in regard to the \u201c idea of democracy \u201d in the West, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday, commenting on the vote. \\nPutin pointed out that while \u201c everyone tries to lecture \u201d Russia on democracy, European lawmakers themselves resort to a policy of restrictions, \u201c which is not the best way \u201d to deal with any issues. \\n\u201c The best approach is an open discussion, in which bright and solid arguments to support one\u2019s point of view should be presented ,\u201d Putin said. \\nAdding that he hopes the Western move to \u201c counter Russian propaganda \u201d won\u2019t lead to serious restrictions, the president congratulated RT and Sputnik journalists on their work. \\nIn the Wednesday vote, 304 MEPs supported the resolution based on the report \u2018 EU strategic communication to counteract propaganda against it by third parties \u2019, with 179 voting against it and 208 abstaining. \\nWritten by a Polish member of the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group, Anna Fotyga, the report alleged that Moscow aims to \u201c distort the truth, provoke doubt, divide the EU and its North American partners, paralyze the decision-making process, discredit the EU institutions and incite fear and uncertainty among EU citizens .\u201d \\nThe report suggests that Moscow provides financial support to opposition parties and organizations in EU member states, causing disintegration within the bloc. \\nAt the same time, Russia is accused of \u201c information warfare ,\u201d with such entities as RT TV channel, Sputnik news agency, Rossotrudnichestvo federal agency and the Russkiy Mir (Russian World) fund alleged to be among its most threatening propaganda \u201ctools. \u201d \\nThe document places Russian media organizations alongside terrorist groups such as Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL). \\nThe report also mentions some \u201c social media and internet trolls \u201d from Russia who are thought to \u201c challenge democratic values .\u201d \\nIt called for the establishment of measures to tackle the perceived Russian propaganda threat, by means of \u201c investing in awareness raising, education, online and local media .\u201d It also suggests stronger cooperation between the EU and NATO \u201c on strategic communication .\u201d \\nSputnik has already appealed to the UN, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and a number of international journalists\u2019 organizations and NGOs, including Reporters Without Borders, to take measures to stop what it considers to be interference into freedom of speech in the EU. \\n\u201c The resolution hits straight at a number of respected media, including Sputnik agency, and has an aim to stop their activity in the EU. Moreover, the resolution bluntly contradicts the EU\u2019s own human rights and freedom of press norms,\u201d reads the letter signed by Sputnik Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan. \\nDuring the parliamentary debate that preceded the vote, MEPs campaigning for the resolution said the EU was \u201c at war with Russia, on a collision course with each other traveling faster than a jet fighter ,\u201d and that with an alleged \u201c aim to split Europe, the Kremlin forces its information into our countries .\u201d '"}, "time": 1742564196.0093625}
