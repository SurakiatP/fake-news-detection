You delight in the spectacle of sunlight glinting off its slivered facade. Suddenly, you realize, the new 1 World Trade Center  \u2014   the Freedom Tower  \u2014   has become familiar. And 15 years after the twin towers disappeared abruptly from the skyline, they have begun to fade from popular consciousness. They once nearly rivaled the Statue of Liberty and the Empire State Building as simple, graphic representations of the complex idea of New York. In movies and logotypes, on knickknacks and letterheads, two parallel strokes meant only one thing. Now, a shaft of slender, alternating isosceles triangles  \u2014   so simple a child could draw it  \u2014   is coming to mean the same thing. Campagna  Sons of Brooklyn, which makes boxes for pizzerias around Lower Manhattan and nearby New Jersey cities like Hoboken and Weehawken, carries a Freedom Tower design, in         and   sizes. Instagram currently counts nearly 200, 000 posts tagged #oneworldtradecenter. Fishs Eddy, an imaginative housewares store in the Flatiron neighborhood of Manhattan, has introduced the new 1 World Trade Center to its popular \u201c212\u201d line. But dinner plates and other \u201c212\u201d merchandise designed before Sept. 11, 2001, will still have the twin towers in the silhouetted skyline, Julie Gaines, an owner, said. The twin towers have not vanished from the insignia of the New York Fire Department. But last year, on the department\u2019s 150th anniversary, they gave way temporarily to a commemorative patch designed by Firefighter Richard Miranda, of Rescue Company 1, showing the new 1 World Trade Center. The pizza box was designed by Joseph Campagna, who runs the business begun by his grandfather and carried on by his father and uncle. He was inspired to draw up a patriotic tableau with an oversize American flag flying over the new tower. The Campagnas can see the building from their headquarters on the waterfront in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. \u201cIt got bad for a while,\u201d Mr. Campagna said. \u201cBut seeing the new tower being built was like seeing a light at the end of the tunnel. \u201d The design is so popular, he said, that some pizzerias refuse anything else. \u201cIf I run out of boxes and send them my stock design  \u2014   Italian village  \u2014   they\u2019ll say, \u2018I don\u2019t want it,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a smash hit. \u201d And not just at pizzerias. Using Times Square tchotchke shops as a barometer, the    tower is already nearing the apotheosis of kitsch. Though the Statue of Liberty and Empire State Building have nothing to fear yet, the Chrysler Building and Brooklyn Bridge may want to look to their laurels. The Freedom Tower is gaining fast. You can now buy snow globes with the tower. Or paperweights. Spoon rests. Key chains. Flasks. Compacts. Shot glasses. Or sheer, provocatively cut panties known as cheekies. \u201cI\u2019ve got this big smile on my face as you talk about souvenir shops,\u201d said T. J. Gottesdiener, managing partner of Skidmore, Owings  Merrill, which designed 1 World Trade Center. (David M. Childs was the lead architect.) \u201c\u2018Icon\u2019 is the right word, but some of the reproductions are so grotesquely misproportioned that it\u2019s very funny. \u201d Who controls such depictions? From a legal standpoint, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which developed the building in partnership with the Durst Organization. The authority has applied for trademark No. 86931748 on \u201cthe depiction of a building with a spire on top,\u201d including its elongated triangular facets. In theory, the authority\u2019s permission would have to be obtained to use this mark on hundreds of items that are listed on the trademark application, including, but not limited to, basting brushes, dust ruffles, mud flaps, fanny packs, mouse pads, rompers,   ornaments and golf divot repair tools. But there is no practical way to police such depictions. Two years ago, the agency tried to crack down on Fishs Eddy, saying the use of the twin tower silhouettes on its ceramic ware \u201cinterferes with the Port Authority\u2019s control of its own reputation. \u201d John Oliver responded wickedly on the show \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d by introducing a Port Authority Bus Terminal dinner plate, with silhouettes of a woman vomiting in a garbage can, a man urinating in a water fountain, a condom and a rat orgy. The authority dropped the matter. Ms. Gaines said, \u201cThey would have to sue every souvenir shop in the city, not just us. \u201d \u201cOur position is consistent,\u201d she added, \u201cthat we don\u2019t believe anyone owns the silhouette of the New York City skyline. \u201d Put another way, everyone owns it. \u201cOne World Trade Center and every other structure on the site hold our impossible wish: to have back everyone who was lost on Sept. 11,\u201d Judith Dupr\u00e9 wrote in \u201cOne World Trade Center: Biography of the Building. \u201d \u201cOf all the challenges that the World Trade Center has had to face, perhaps the biggest one is exorcising the ghosts of the structures that it replaced. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563973.7537055}
