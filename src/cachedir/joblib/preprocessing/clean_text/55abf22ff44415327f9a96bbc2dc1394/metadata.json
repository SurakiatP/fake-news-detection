Until he utters them, imploringly in a fictional branch of a Newcastle jobcentre office, he is simply another scrounger. To earn acknowledgment, let alone respect, he must first confirm his status as a consumer of the services on offer. \\nIt doesn\u2019t matter. He is a carpenter by trade, shown knowledgeably inspecting the components of his labour in the film\u2019s early scenes. He lives alone, he had a heart attack, his doctors say he cannot work. He must sign on for benefits, but is found capable of work under the benefits regime which assesses a man with a history of cardiac arrest as being suitable for production, on the basis that he can reach for his top pocket and walk fifty metres unaided. \\nDescribing the benefits system in the UK as Kafkaesque would be to miss the point. Bureaucracy was a byword for existential trauma in Kafka, not something designed by people to be deployed, en masse but in the shadows, against whole swathes of people in their jurisdiction. The benefits system as we know it in the UK assumes its beneficiaries to be immoral scroungers, perniciously ripping off the hardworking people who deign to pay tax in marginal constituencies prayed on by political image consultants who attended the ancient universities. More crucially, when the response to this film focuses on the efficiency of the system and not the devastation it wreaks on people, it affirms the distance which makes misery so profitable in today\u2019s United Kingdom. \\nSo when Daniel Blake is denied the benefits package which should cater to people who cannot work because of ill health, he must sign up to Jobseekers allowance, a necessary condition for which is the admission that a person is liable for their productivity. Consequently he must spend as much time looking for work as he is deemed able to work \u2013 in this case thirty five hours a week. He attends a CV building workshop, run by a man as reputable and cogent as any of the political consultants who ministered Tony Blair\u2019s ascendancy to the Northern masses, but with an accent which lets you know he\u2019s provincial. The whole film begs us to ask who is its intended audience. \\nThe vagaries of Blake\u2019s experience beyond this are unexceptional, to any of the audiences which might be viewing this film. Those who have to directly interact with the system are likely to face hurdles in attending a screening in enough numbers to generate the kind of social upheaval people might want to see \u2013 the cinema being a costly, far-away form of entertainment for many in the UK. As for those who, like the author, work with people affected by the system; assisting in claims, trying to maintain mental health throughout the months of assessments, writing letters and making calls to dispute the lies peddled by private companies tasked with diminishing the number of claimants? They have likely seen worse cases than that of Daniel Blake \u2013 people driven past the boundaries of mental anguish they thought possible, and left there while an appeal or a \u2018mandatory reconsideration\u2019 hangs in the balance. \\nInstead this film seems to have hit its mark when the Times , Rupert Murdoch\u2019s broadsheet flagship in the UK, announced that it \u201cmight change things.\u201d Any portrayal of the benefits system which could be of use to the libertarian right, or even mainstream media, must now be so skewed as to be unrecognisable to those who have seen it. \\nIncreasingly the benefits system, and the people whose lives it lays waste to as politicians demand, at the behest of their constituents, operates behind a glass wall whose opacity just clouds the identities of the damned. As Daniel Blake is plucked from the obscurity of fiction to represent an entire system, proudly taking his singular place on behalf of the many, the others are ignored. \\nWomen like Katie \u2013 the university student and mother who spent two years trying to raise a family in a homeless hostel before moving the length of the country to an unfamiliar city in search of difference when it became obvious there was nothing but repetition where she knew. Women like Sheila, the jobcentre assistant who interprets Katie\u2019s desperation the only way anyone can anymore: as aggression, and earns the ultimate mark of British social disdain: silent disapproval. Was this the life she envisaged as a child? What does she think when she goes home? Does she suppose she might be the crux of an evil system? Women like Ann, the kindly woman at the jobcentre who faces disciplinary action from bosses for the crime of helping a man fill in a benefits claim, even if it means transgressing silly rules. What does she think about having to stay at the jobcentre? Does she see any hope for the future? What would she think about the film\u2019s implication that Sheila, her colleague, is all that is wrong with the world? \\nNone of these stories are explored. Katie\u2019s moments of angst are some of the film\u2019s most affecting \u2013 including her admirable restraint in not maiming Daniel Blake when he insists \u201cshe doesn\u2019t have to do this,\u201d when he walks into the brothel she works at because there is manifestly no other option. In this, Daniel\u2019s apotheosis to everything the Right needs him to be. A man, who built things with his hands, and still has more good, old-fashioned morals than sense. Without these things he would be just another scumbag, pilfering the system of their hard-earned pennies. He even goes to the trouble of containing his grief at the death of his partner \u2013 a woman whose mental illness he tolerated for years until her apparent suicide. She is at peace now, and so are the Tories \u2013 safe in the knowledge that the UK\u2019s premier leftist filmmaker has gifted them the fictional icon they always wanted but did not know they could have: Daniel Blake is the facsimile of masculinity, working class nostalgia and British reserve that they might see in themselves, if they needed to bother to look. \\nFortunately for them, they don\u2019t \u2013 unfortunately for the rest of us, there\u2019s only the Labour Party between now and an eternity of their rule.'"}, "time": 1742628403.779141}
