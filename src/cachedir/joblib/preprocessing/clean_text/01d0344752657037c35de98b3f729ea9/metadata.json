If the seller\u2019s answer is something like, \u201cIt\u2019s a 1953 Fender Telecaster with an Esquire neck,\u201d then it is probably legitimate. But if the answer is \u201ca guitar,\u201d that\u2019s something altogether different. A new seller who entered Sam Ash on Sept. 28 had a plausible explanation for not knowing much about the contents of the guitar case he carried that day and, later, other cases. \u201cHis father moved to North Carolina and left him the guitars,\u201d said Jeremy Kolmin, another manager. The store bought his Gibson that day, and $4, 300 worth of other instruments, mostly guitars, in the weeks that followed. \u201cHe\u2019s a nice guy,\u201d Mr. Kolmin recalled. The staff at Sam Ash knows a lot about guitars. So when that same seller entered in late November with an electric guitar, Mr. Kolmin did a double take. He was sure he had seen it before. Like many guitar enthusiasts, Mr. Kolmin visits the \u201cgear pages\u201d of musicians  \u2014   links that display an artist\u2019s favorite guitars. The seller was carrying a Heritage guitar  \u2014   specifically, a Heritage Signature Skolnick, part of a limited series designed by a specific artist, Alex Skolnick. It was a unique instrument, and it made Mr. Kolmin suspicious because he followed Mr. Skolnick and recognized it from his gear page. Then he flipped it over and saw the serial number, Z20001, and his suspicions were all but confirmed. He asked something like, \u201cWhere did you get this again?\u201d and the seller gave the same answer about his father, he recalled. The end digits, 001, indicated the guitar was a series prototype, not one sold by the company. It would have belonged to the artist, Mr. Skolnick. Mr. Skolnick, 48, leads a jazz outfit, the Alex Skolnick Trio and, at this time of year, has played holiday shows with the   Orchestra. But to a large and loud segment of his audience, Mr. Skolnick, with his long black hair and its telltale streak of white, is best known as lead guitarist of the thrash metal band Testament. The band gained fame in the late 1980s and was known in part for the melodic style Mr. Skolnick brought to his solos within a genre that favored raw intensity. He left in the 1990s, but the band has reunited over the years and continues to perform, as they will, with more than 60 other bands on a heavy metal cruise from Florida to Haiti in February, \u201c70, 000 Tons of Metal. \u201d The store emailed Mr. Skolnick about the Heritage guitar. He lived in Brooklyn, but was in Berlin, wrapping up a tour with Testament. Months earlier, in May, he had placed a lot of equipment that was piling up at home  \u2014   he estimates he owns 40 guitars, along with amplifiers and other gear  \u2014   in a new CubeSmart storage facility near his apartment in Park Slope. The Heritage was among the stored guitars, and he had no idea it was not in the locker. \u201cIndeed,\u201d he wrote to Sam Ash in an email, \u201cI might not have noticed for another year or so, as I\u2019m on tour often and there are long gaps between my going through all the instruments I\u2019m not using. \u201d He promised to visit his locker upon his return that week. Before that happened, on Dec. 1, the seller returned to Sam Ash with another Skolnick   guitar, this one from the ESP Guitar Company. \u201cWe called the cops and said, \u2018What are we supposed to do? \u2019\u201d said another manager, Bobby Colonna. Officers arrived and questioned the man briefly, but without a complaint from a victim, they could not arrest him, and he left. Still, Mr. Colonna urged the man to come back in a day, pretending he needed the time to research the guitar\u2019s worth. At the same time, Mr. Skolnick visited his locker. It did not appear to have been tampered with, and the contents of the unit looked untouched, but some guitars were indeed absent. He swore out a complaint. The managers at Sam Ash were sure that after the previous day\u2019s police scrutiny, the man would not return. But return he did. Officers returned, too, and in front of the store staff, they were able to handcuff the seller, John Olds, 51, of Harlem. \u201cMy father passed away two years ago and left me the guitars,\u201d he told officers, according to court documents. He added, \u201cI can\u2019t incriminate myself. \u201d He is in jail awaiting trial on several counts of possession of stolen property. Mr. Skolnick got his guitars back, including the Heritage No. 1, which is again being kept where it was before the move in May: in his crowded living room, in plain sight.'"}, "time": 1742563308.5805428}
