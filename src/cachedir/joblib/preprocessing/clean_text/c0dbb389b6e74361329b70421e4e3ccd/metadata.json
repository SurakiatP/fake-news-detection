[\u201cSome 33, 000 violent street gangs, motorcycle gangs, and prison gangs with about 1. 4 million members are criminally active in the U. S. and Puerto Rico today,\u201d the FBI reports. \u201cMany are sophisticated and well organized all use violence to control neighborhoods and boost their illegal   activities, which include robbery, drug and gun trafficking, prostitution and human trafficking, and fraud. \u201d  \u201cMany gang members continue to commit crimes even after being sent to jail,\u201d the FBI reports. The 1. 4 million figure for the number of gang members is as big or bigger than four of the Top 10 largest cities in the U. S.  \u2014   San Antonio, Texas, 1. 3 million San Diego, California, 1. 3 million Dallas, Texas, 1. 1 million and San Jose, California, 945, 942. The FBI has numerous entities working to combat the gang problem, including the Safe Streets Task Forces, the National Gang Intelligence Center, and Transnational   Task Forces. The NGIC, established by Congress in 2005, \u201cintegrates gang intelligence from across federal, state, and local law enforcement on the growth, migration, criminal activity, and association of gangs that pose a significant threat to the U. S. \u201d That intelligence reveals that the \u201cMara Salvatrucha ( ) and 18th Street gangs continue to expand their influence in the United States, while transnational (operating across national borders) gangs are present in almost every state and continue to grow their memberships, now targeting younger recruits more than ever before. \u201d The FBI\u2019s transnational   task forces operate in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, according to the FBI website. President Donald Trump said in April that his administration is cracking down on violent gangs operating in the U. S. \u201cThey are getting the hell out or they are going to prison,\u201d Trump said in an interview with Fox and Friends. Trump praised Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly for enforcing the laws. \u201cI will tell you we have gotten tremendous criminals out of this country,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo many towns and cities are thanking me because we have gotten rid of a burden that you would not believe,\u201d he said. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced in April the expansion of the Texas   Task Force (TAG) and the creation of a technical operations center in response to a sharp increase in rape and murder in the Houston area by violent gangs. Abbott and Texas Department of Public Safety Director Steve McCraw singled out   and its connection to human smuggling, drug trafficking, murder, and rape during the announcement. \u201cThis recent wave of senseless violence cannot continue,\u201d Abbott told reporters at a press conference attended by Breitbart Texas. \u201cGovernment\u2019s foremost responsibility is to keep our citizens safe and secure,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cTexas will take action and use all lawful means to put an end to this lawlessness. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628522.8644571}
