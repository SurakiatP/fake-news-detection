[According to the figures, obtained by the Evening Standard, some of the children involved in the abuse were younger than   .  Since 2012, honour crimes reported to the Metropolitan Police rose to 1, 081 and those relating to forced marriages shot up to 367. Women and girls were the victims in the vast majority of reported incidents, with over half coming from \u201cAsian\u201d backgrounds, the paper reports. Knives and guns were involved in more than 70 incidents, and dozens of rapes and other sexual crimes were reported. Detective Chief Inspector Sam Faulkner, of the Met\u2019s Community Safety Unit, said the crimes stem from communities using \u201ccultural   religious justifications for male violence against women and girls and other people\u201d. They were often based on traditions whereby \u201can individual, family and community\u2019s honour is weighted on women and girls\u201d he said, including refusing to go along with a marriage. \u201cWe see an increase in these types of offences as a positive step, an indication that victims have more confidence to report offences to police and seek the support they need\u201d he added. Politicians today called the findings \u201ctroubling\u201d \u201cshocking\u201d and \u201cabhorrent\u201d. Labour MP Yvette Cooper, chair of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, told the Evening Standard: \u201cToo many of these awful crimes are still hidden. There is no \u2018honour\u2019 in violence against women, rape, torture or abuse of a family member. \u201cThese are deadly crimes and there is still too little protection, too few prosecutions and too much stigma which prevents people coming forward. \u201cIt\u2019s vital that when victims do speak out they get proper help from support groups and from the police to keep them safe. \u201d The figures, obtained using Freedom of Information requests, show that \u201cviolence against the person\u201d was the most common \u201chonour\u201d attack, accounting for 85 per cent of incidents. Sexual violence was the second largest category, with 56 rapes and 11 \u201cother sexual\u201d crimes. 84 per cent were perpetrated against women, with \u201cAsian\u201d women accounting for more than half.'"}, "time": 1742563811.5044637}
