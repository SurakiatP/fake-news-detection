Smartmatic style Diebold type machines and software will count the votes and the corporate controlled media will announce the results. No mention of Election Fraud or the problems of the past. Long live Mike Connell, Clint Curtis, Bev Harris, Brad Friedman, RFK Jr. and other whistleblowers who have tried to fight for our democracy. Will only get worse from here it seems. Always hopeful though. David S \\nGovernment will win as always. Freedom will lose as always. The ruling elite control most elected officials and hundreds of thousands of government bureaucrats legislate unconstitutionally from their offices. We sit upon $20 Trillion in real debt and another $250+Trillion in unfunded liabilities. Trump wishes to increase military spending and Hillary never met a war she didn\u2019t support (on behalf of her puppetmasters of course). Our medical system is nearly completely destroyed by over a century of government micromanagement and collusion with the AMA. We have more people incarcerated than nearly every other country on earth \u2013 mostly for non-violent drug offenses \u2013 and neither candidate looks to have the courage or the desire to truly allow freedom in this area (though Trump shows the greatest hope). Our government/CIA/other black ops groups, etc. are working tirelessly to undermine governments around the world, incite violence, and provoke armed conflict \u2013 maybe even nuclear \u2013 all for the benefit of the arms cartel and banksters who profit from every war. The people of America clearly have NO interest in restoring freedom, liberty, private property rights, business rights, sound money, etc. anymore. This \u201crebellion\u201d that has gotten behind Trump still needs to bear fruit with regards to demanding REAL change at the federal and state levels. What will come of the following months is to be seen, but I suspect, as with so many previous \u201crebellions,\u201d these folks will go back to their televisions, iPads, and Playstations and will forget about the fundamental corruption and crony capitalism that is destroying this country so long as they get a few bones thrown their way to pacify them. Let us hope something far more profound comes of it all. Time for a drink. kimyo \\nfwiw: a screencap of \u2018final\u2019 results displayed on 11/2 (apparently by accident) by nbc station wrcb-tv shows: popular vote: clinton 41,765,317 / trump 40,124,438, electoral college: clinton 343 / trump 195. \\nalthough the early reporting showing trump with a commanding lead matches my take on american sentiment, my cynical side suspects that it is the msm\u2019s way of getting out the later-voting clinton supporters \\nif anonymous were a real thing, today\u2019s show would be have been completely different. real hackers don\u2019t waste their precious time defacing websites. \\nps: if trump does win, i picture zuesse as the dog, who, after years of chasing, has finally caught that darn UPS truck. growling, jowls full of brown bumper, but with a dawning comprehension on his brow, realizing \u2018well, exactly what do i do now?\u2019 Orangutan. \\nContinuity of Gov\u2019t plans have been implemented and in place. Dept of Homeland Security is now running our elections. The results will not be publicly available for review anymore according to Bev Harris. Similar to the results in California where the primary was announced for Hillary but Bernie may have actually ended up winning there. Welcome to the 1984 style Continuity of Government plan and Department of Homeland Security run elections thanks to the public\u2019s refusal to emotionally or intellectually acknowledge the truth about 9/11 or the false flag anthrax attacks that followed. TruthTime \\nEspecially agree with the comment about the Anthrax attack. The criminals are still at large for that blatantly, obvious state-sponsored crime. I laughed when Obama\u2019s Administration decided to shut down any investigation into it. \\nAmerica is a Nation of subjects who are continually subjected to the lies and falsehoods of their elected leaders. We have state crimes going far back to the era of JFK. People that still think Corruption isn\u2019t really that bad in Washington, that it\u2019s all a \u201cconspiracy theory.\u201d Carl_Herman \\nThank you for asking, GW. It\u2019s not an \u201celection\u201d when it fails to meet that definition due to multiple methods for election fraud. It\u2019s not for a \u201cUS president\u201d therefore, but an appointed \u201cleader.\u201d And, it\u2019s not reported by media, but the appointers\u2019 propaganda minions. \\nOf course, if we continue this argument with ~100 other points centered in lie-started Wars of Aggression, bankster-looting, and lying about near everything important, we can\u2019t even call it the US as defined by our Constitution. \\nSo, where do we go from here? \\nStart with truth. Then see what develops. Charlie Primero \\nCarl, this vote shows that all the people you have been trying to \u201cwake up\u201d to the corruption and graft are waking up. \\nThis is just the beginning. Be happy. MyWikiDisQus \\nIt does not matter what we think or do or say anymore. The republic has been overthrown by the plutocrats who remain in power as long as the citizenry believe in the concocted and fraudulent electoral system they fabricated that selects the candidate who serves them, not the people. Participation of the masses is necessary to grant them the mandate to ensure the continuity of their reign that has continually impoverished the majority of the nation. \\nIn the beginning representative government in America was a wonderful experiment that has since devolved, brick by brick, decade by decade into a shell of its former creation to become a bastion of despotism. The poor are still slaves, indentured to the government by onerous debt as Negros were to their 19 century plantations masters; only the title of ownership has changed. The middle class, once a foundation of prosperity has now become an economic ghost, relegated to the status of freemen of the peasant class. \\nThe wealthy are richer in material possession, millionaires become billionaires and the government siphons off from the upper class to enrich itself by political favor, by statute and regulation, by ignoring the rule of equal justice under the law. \\nHow long will the people tolerate this abomination of corrupt authority? What will be the future event that triggers the entire country to say, \u201cEnough!\u201d? Will it be a complete economic breakdown of society or the devastation of nuclear war on our soil? \\n\u201cWe the People\u201d have the power, we have always possessed it. The time of reconciliation is upon us, we must balance the ledger of liberty back in our favor. The only way to peacefully do it is reject the system that oppresses us. Do not engage with them, do not obey them, tell them their lies carry no truth, we see through the veil of falsity and reject it and demand a new path to opportunity and happiness for all who are willing to work towards it. TruthTime \\nThe U.S. is fucked. \\nBut it needs to collapse now or within 100 years for people to totally realize they were duped. It is the only way to start anew. kimyo \\naccording to zh, trump has ohio, florida and north carolina. \\nmy top 3 questions: 1) will there be a thorough investigation of the clinton foundation? 2) what will he do if the next 9/11 happens on his watch? 3) will he kill cop21 and defund global warming research? diogenes \\nOne thing is utterly clear: if Trump wins, the wholly Wall Street owned Democratic Party gave it to him by rigging primaries to put the Clinton criminal gang on the ballot. \\nBecause Bernie would have won \u2014 won with the votes not only of millions of nominally \u201cDemocratic\u201d voters who rightly can\u2019t stomach Clinton and didn\u2019t vote for her (whether we voted Green, or Libertarian or Trump or stayed home) \u2014 but also with the votes of millions who are voting Trump because he appears to at least not be part of the Wall Street criminal gang of hereditary oligarchs. Tim Chambers \\nLooks like Trump will be President and free to do as he pleases. The Repug\u2019s bet on Scalia\u2019s seat has been made good. The Democrats will now have to rethink identity politics and third way neoliberalism. I wonder if Obama will try to ram through the trade agreements and a few other monstrosities now during the lame duck session. \\nBye, Bye, Hillary, bye bye. It\u2019s the one silver lining to the overhanging clouds. What a disaster of a candidate! Such arrogant over-confidence. And what a comeuppance for the party and its big money backers! It is going to cost them a lot of money to into Trumps good graces. \\nAll we need now is for Trump to sell out his working class supporters for the Democrats to return to a sincere class-based politics that brings back the independent voters. They should have given Bernie his rightful chance. \\nUnfortunately, what we are likely to see is another attempt by the Clintons 4 years from now against Warren. Two losses isn\u2019t likely to dissuade that bitch in the least. \\nI told you back in April and again 2 weeks ago that Trump would win!! http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2016/10/donald-j-trump-will-win.html Tim Chambers \\nfuggetaboutit Evil Genius \\nWho knows the Clintons and Waltons better than Arkansas? My favorite part was Arkansas voted 2-1 against Clinton. Ha ha ha! \\n(BTW GW: There\u2019s an error in Robert Parry\u2019s bio\u2026the word \u201cbroke\u201d is missing (i.e., \u201cbroke stories\u201d).) kimyo \\nimagine if tomorrow trump says \u2018yes, absolutely, we\u2019re going to build that wall, but while we\u2019re waiting for the check from mexico why don\u2019t we find 500 out-of-work engineers and architects and 5,000 out-of-work construction folk and send them to flint to fix the water system.
