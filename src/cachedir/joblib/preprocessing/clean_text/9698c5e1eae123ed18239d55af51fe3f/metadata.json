She does not publicly admit her putrid roots but her name gives her up. Oligarch Roman Abramovich who managed to escape justice in Russia and fled to the UK is also Jewish but he is public about it.\\nAbramovic is a common name among Jewish people living in Slavic countries, because they like to brag that they are the descendants of Abraham. Abramovic is a derivation of Abraham. In the Holy Bible, John 8:39-44 there is actually a very revealing conversation about this specific issue:\\n\u201c Abraham is our father ,\u201d they (Jews) answered. \u201c If you were Abraham\u2019s children ,\u201d said Jesus, \u201c then you would do what Abraham did. \\nAs it is, you are looking for a way to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do such things.\\nYou are doing the works of your own father.\u201d \u201cWe are not illegitimate children,\u201d they protested. \u201cThe only Father we have is God himself.\u201d\\nJesus said to them, \u201cIf God were your Father, you would love me, for I have come here from God. I have not come on my own; God sent me.\\nWhy is my language not clear to you? Because you are unable to hear what I say.\\nYou belong to your father, the devil , and you want to carry out your father\u2019s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.\\nThis email comes shortly after we previously had another email where Jennifer Palmieri, Campaign Chairman John Podesta and John Halpin discuss about how much they HATE Christians, especially Catholics and Evangelicals .\\nInfowars reporter Paul Joseph Watson breaks down the \u201cspirit cooking\u201d ritual:\\n\\nThe Clinton Satanic network has now been exposed on a national level thanks to WikiLeaks.\\n\\nAbramovic in particular invited Podesta to a \u201cspirit cooking\u201d dinner, an occult ritual started by infamous Satanist Aleister Crowley, which involves eating semen, blood and breast milk.\\n\\nHere are some examples of what a \u201cspirit cooking\u201d dinner with Marina Abramovic looks like:\\nCan't wait to go #SpiritCooking with @HillaryClinton and @JohnPodesta again!\\nWhere do you get so much blood? #PodestaLeaks #WikiLeaks pic.twitter.com/GckBmIfHjL \\n\u2014 Viva Europa (@realVivaEuropa) November 4, 2016 \\n\\nAnother email from WikiLeaks even shows Abramovic being invited to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign launch party.\\nThe Drudge Report linked this article at the top of the site propelling the hashtag #SpiritCooking to the top of Twitter\u2019s trending hashtag section.\\nThe internet exploded this morning after the news broke.\\nWhen you click on the top trending hashtag #SpiritCooking on Twitter, Hillary Clinton\u2019s page comes up.\\nHere\u2019s Abramovic pictured hanging out with top musicians Jay-Z and Lady Gaga.\\nThe Elites are Satanists.
