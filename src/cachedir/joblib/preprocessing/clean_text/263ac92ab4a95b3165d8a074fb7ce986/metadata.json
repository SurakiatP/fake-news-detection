It describes how Band helped run what he called \u201cBill Clinton Inc.,\u201d obtaining \u201cin-kind services for the President and his family \u2014 for personal travel, hospitality, vacation and the like.\u201d \\nBand grew close to Clinton during the \u201990s as his personal aide in the White House and became \u201cthe architect of his post-presidential activities,\u201d the Post reports. In the memo, Band argues that his work and the work of his firm benefited the former president and his family\u2019s foundation: \\n\u201cWe have dedicated ourselves to helping the President secure and engage in for-profit activities,\u201d Band wrote. He added that he had \u201csought to leverage my activities, including my partner role at Teneo, to support and to raise funds for the foundation.\u201d \\nThe Post continues: \\nBand\u2019s memo provided data showing how much money each of Teneo\u2019s 20 clients at the time had given to the Clinton Foundation, how much they had paid Bill Clinton and, in some cases, how he or Kelly had personally forged the relationships that resulted in the payments. \\nBand wrote that Teneo partners had raised in excess of $8 million for the foundation and $3 million in paid speaking fees for Bill Clinton. He said he had secured contracts for the former president that would pay out $66 million over the subsequent nine years if the deals remained in place. \\nFor instance, Band wrote that Kelly arranged for the former president to meet the chief executive of Coca-Cola in January 2009 at the Clintons\u2019 home in Washington. In all, according to Band\u2019s memo, Coke had contributed $4.33 million to the foundation between 2004 and 2010. \u2026 \\nBand also described how Kelly helped expand a fruitful relationship with UBS Global Wealth Management, introducing Bill Clinton to a top executive at a 2009 charity dinner. In the ensuing years, UBS upped its giving to the foundation, signed on as a Teneo client and agreed to pay Bill Clinton for speeches, Band wrote. \\nRecords show UBS paid Clinton about $2 million in speaking fees between 2011 and 2015 for a series of appearances, generally alongside former president George W. Bush. The company also paid Hillary Clinton $225,000 for a 2013 speech. \u2026 \\nAnother achievement cited by Band: Laureate International Universities, a chain of for-profit international colleges, which donated to the foundation and agreed to pay Bill Clinton $3.5 million a year to serve as honorary chancellor. \\nCompanies aligned with the Clinton Foundation paid several million dollars to Teneo for consulting services. The Post reports that a spike in payments from Dow \u201craised red flags for an internal company fraud investigator, who expressed alarm that it may be linked to Bill Clinton\u2019s work with a charity founded by Liveris\u2014a charge the company denied.\u201d The investigator wrote: \u201cIt appears Dow is paying Teneo for connections with Clinton.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742564524.0093303}
