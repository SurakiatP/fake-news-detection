To receive it in your inbox, register here. Good morning. I have a column in The Times Magazine today about a recipe for roasted potato hash that I\u2019ve been messing around with for years now. It makes a superlative bed for eggs and an excellent side dish for steak. You could eat it with a mess of saut\u00e9ed greens and be happy without the animal protein. You should make it entirely your own. Perhaps you could make it for lunch? And then for dinner tonight, you could try the recipe for braised chicken legs that I learned from the teachings of the California chef Cal Peternell, and sop up the sauce with Julia Moskin\u2019s recipe for grilled garlic bread. On Monday night, you might go meatless and Balkan, mixing up David Tanis\u2019s recipe for a Greek tomato salad and adding some crumbled feta if you like to make it really sing. Or you could go Brazilian in honor of the Olympic Games, with 10 recipes from that nation\u2019s larder. For sure on Tuesday you could give Martha Rose Shulman\u2019s recipe for   shrimp with spicy greens a try. Serve it with Kim Severson\u2019s can\u2019  rice and then settle in to see what the Olympics have to offer. (You\u2019re not, like, in Rio, are you? If you are, or just want to imagine that you are, Florence Fabricant has a fine guide to the city\u2019s best restaurant options.) Wednesday night could be good for a steak seared in a   pan and served with a platter of saut\u00e9ed summer squash with red pepper and onion, along with leftover rice or a baguette and butter. Then on Thursday night just order a pizza and make Melissa\u2019s recipe for eggplant with lamb, tomato and pine nuts while or after you eat it, in advance of serving a really incredible dish  \u2014   one that benefits from overnight resting  \u2014   on Friday night, as we head into the weekend. Thus fortified, you can wake up on Saturday morning, head to the market and return home to make jam. Go look around on Cooking to discover other things to cook this week. (This recipe for pork chops puttanesca, for instance.) And, if you like, tell us about what you make. We\u2019re on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest, where we use and applaud the hashtag #NYTCooking. If you run into problems along the way, don\u2019t hesitate to ask for help: cookingcare@nytimes. com. Or if you have a particular question about food or cooking, kitchens or life in and around them, submit it to foodeditor@nytimes. com. I\u2019ll be collecting the best of them to answer in a forthcoming \u201cHey, Mr. Food Editor\u201d column for Men\u2019s Style. Now, see if you can\u2019t find an actual print copy of The Times today. In it we have a beautiful special section devoted to an excerpt from Colson Whitehead\u2019s new novel, \u201cThe Underground Railroad. \u201d Or, if you want to stay online only, try this fascinating account of life as a paramedic in the border town of Laredo, Tex. in California Sunday. Watch the trailer for \u201cLittle Men. \u201d Read Tessa Hadley\u2019s new short story, \u201cDido\u2019s Lament,\u201d in The New Yorker. And watch Melissa cook the   \u201cimpossible meat\u201d that you may have been hearing about, on Facebook. See you tomorrow.'"}, "time": 1742562903.0575268}
