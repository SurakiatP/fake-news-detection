[On Monday, Archbishop Angelo Becciu, the number two of the Vatican Secretariat of State, confirmed that the Pope would still be traveling as planned to Egypt April   just as Egypt\u2019s Cabinet announced a   state of emergency.  \u201cThere is no doubt that the Holy Father will stick to his plan,\u201d Becciu told the Italian daily, Corriere della Sera. \u201cWhat happened causes distress and great suffering, but it cannot prevent the Pope from carrying out his mission of peace. \u201d On Sunday morning, jihadists set off two separate explosions in the Christian churches of Mar Girgis (Saint George) in Tanta, and Saint Mark\u2019s Church in Alexandria, killing at least 45 people and injuring scores more. The Islamic State terror group immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks in a statement from the organization\u2019s Amaq news agency. \u201cIslamic State squads carried out the attacks on two churches in Tanta and Alexandria,\u201d the statement declared. The Pope was informed of the attacks during the celebration of Palm Sunday Mass in the Vatican, Becciu said, after which the pontiff publicly denounced the bombings in his weekly Angelus address at noon. Speaking before tens of thousands in Saint Peter\u2019s Square, Francis prayed that the Lord \u201cconvert the hearts of the people who are sowing terror, violence and death, and also the hearts of those who make and traffic weapons. \u201d In his interview, Archbishop Becciu said that ever since the Islamic State appeared on the scene, the Pope \u201cwanted to distinguish between terrorist acts carried out by zealous fanatics and the religion itself. \u201d \u201cHe has always refused to associate Islam with terrorism,\u201d Becciu said. \u201cCertain deviant Islamists might be terrorists, but not the religion. And this has earned him the gratitude of the Muslims, for the honesty of his positions. Many Islamic authorities have met with the pontiff to thank him and many others have written to him with admiration for his moral authority. \u201d Last summer, Islamic State representatives expressed deep offense at Pope Francis\u2019 claims that their war was not being waged for religious motives, hastening to assure the pontiff that their sole motivation is religious and sanctioned by Allah in the Qur\u2019an. ISIS censured the Pope for his na\u00efvet\u00e9 in clinging to the conviction that Muslims want peace and that acts of Islamic terror are economically, rather than religiously, motivated. \u201cThis is a   war between the Muslim nation and the nations of disbelief,\u201d the authors state in an article titled \u201cBy the Sword\u201d found in their propaganda magazine, Dabiq. The article attacked Francis for claiming that \u201cauthentic Islam and the proper reading of the Qur\u2019an are opposed to every form of violence,\u201d saying that by doing this, \u201cFrancis continues to hide behind a deceptive veil of \u2018good will,\u2019 covering his actual intentions of pacifying the Muslim nation. \u201d Pope Francis \u201chas struggled against reality\u201d in his efforts to portray Islam as a religion of peace, the article insisted, before going on to urge all Muslims to take up the sword of jihad, the \u201cgreatest obligation\u201d of a true Muslim. During his upcoming visit, Francis will meet the grand imam of Al Azhar University, Ahmed   the highest authority of Sunni Islam, as well as Egyptian government officials and prelates of the Coptic Church.
