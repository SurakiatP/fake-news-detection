It was chronicled in lavish photo spreads in   fashion magazines and in paparazzi shots that appeared in the tabloids and on the gossip sites, as if to undercut the couple\u2019s mythic status. Now, with a lawyer\u2019s blandly worded press statement on Tuesday morning, the love story of Angelina Jolie Pitt and Brad Pitt, who were married in 2014, has come to an unhappy end. \u201cThis decision was made for the health of the family,\u201d Robert Offer, a lawyer for Ms. Jolie Pitt, said in the statement. \u201cShe will not be commenting, and asks that the family be given its privacy at this time. \u201d The announcement came a little over two years after the couple married in a ceremony before roughly 20 friends and family members in a Romanesque chapel on the grounds of Ch\u00e2teau Miraval, their estate in the south of France. The couple\u2019s six children, three of them adopted, attended the bride and groom. The master tailor Luigi Massi of Atelier Versace made Ms. Jolie Pitt\u2019s wedding dress, incorporating designs from her children\u2019s drawings. In keeping with the public nature of their relationship, Mr. Pitt and Ms. Jolie Pitt sold the photographs of their wedding day to People and Hello! magazines for a reported $5 million. In keeping with their habit of giving to charity, the couple contributed the payment to the   Foundation. When their romance became public, the tabloids were quick to dub them \u201cBrangelina. \u201d At the time, she was a divorced mother of an adopted son, Maddox, having ended her marriage to the actor Billy Bob Thornton in 2003. Mr. Pitt was still married to the \u201cFriends\u201d star Jennifer Aniston. Ms. Aniston filed for divorce from the actor in March 2005. That summer a spread appeared in the   glossy magazine W. Shot by Steven Klein and headlined \u201cDomestic Bliss: Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt at Home,\u201d it comprised 60 pages of photographs of Mr. Pitt, Ms. Jolie and five boys (all of them models) who somewhat resembled Mr. Pitt, in a chic, early 1960s setting. Their most recent project as a couple, the 2015 film \u201cBy the Sea,\u201d directed by Ms. Jolie Pitt, told a different story. \u201cMeta with a vengeance, \u2018By the Sea\u2019 stars Angelina Jolie Pitt and Brad Pitt as itinerant married artists who are suffering, beautifully, through a rough patch,\u201d Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. Asked about the process of directing her husband, Ms. Jolie Pitt told Vanity Fair, \u201cA few friends asked if we were crazy. \u201d The moody film was a   flop, grossing $3. 3 million. During the course of their relationship, the Jolie Pitt clan expanded. In addition to Maddox, 15, whom she adopted in Cambodia in 2002, the couple are parents to Zahara, 11, from Ethiopia Shiloh, to whom she gave birth in Namibia in 2006 Pax, 12, adopted in Vietnam and the twins Vivienne and Knox, 8, to whom Ms. Jolie Pitt gave birth in 2008. Ms. Jolie Pitt and Mr. Pitt have separately discussed struggling with   behavior in their younger years. Both seemed to have overcome the dark periods, with a slew of high grossing, critically acclaimed films to their names and a   commitment to philanthropy. She began working for the United Nations in 2000 as a   ambassador, and became the special envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in 2012. She has gone on dozens of missions to countries around the world, including Iraq, Jordan and Myanmar. Last year she addressed the United Nations Security Council, arguing that the United Nations was failing the people of Syria. Earlier this month, Ms. Jolie Pitt spent three days at the Azraq camp in Jordan, which is home to more than 37, 000 Syrian refugees, according to the United Nations. During her years with Mr. Pitt, she had box office hits with the action movie \u201cWanted\u201d and the Disney fantasy \u201cMaleficent\u201d while also making a name for herself as a director of serious fare like \u201cIn the Land of Blood and Honey,\u201d a love story set against the backdrop of the Bosnian War, and \u201cUnbroken. \u201d He has won an Oscar for producing the critically acclaimed \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d and has been nominated for several other Oscars, including for best actor for \u201cThe Curious Case of Benjamin Button\u201d and for \u201cMoneyball. \u201d He was also nominated for a best supporting actor Golden Globe for his role in \u201cBabel. \u201d In 2013, Ms. Jolie Pitt wrote a candid and widely praised   page essay for The New York Times  about choosing to have a preventive double mastectomy. She followed it up in 2015 with an essay on her next preventive surgery, during which her ovaries and fallopian tubes were removed. While he wears his political commitments more lightly than Ms. Jolie Pitt, Mr. Pitt is a founder of Not on Our Watch, a nongovernmental organization devoted to preventing genocide, and the founder of Make It Right, which builds homes and other structures for people in need. Over the course of their time together, the couple demonstrated an unusual ability to negotiate with the media. After Shiloh was born in 2006, the couple sold photos of the mother and newborn to People magazine for an estimated $4. 1 million, all of which they donated to charity. That same year they negotiated with People on another deal, giving the magazine exclusive photos of Ms. Jolie and Maddox for an estimated $750, 000 and the promise to cover Ms. Jolie Pitt\u2019s charity work. Later, they received an estimated $14 million from People and Hello! magazines  \u2014   for shots of their twins  \u2014   and again donated the funds to charity. On Tuesday, with the announcement of the split, the hashtag #Brangelina quickly became the top trending item on Twitter, with fans reacting to the news with a range of emotions, including laments over the death of love complaints that the news was superseding President Obama\u2019s speech at the United Nations and theories that the news was a welcome distraction from the presidential campaign. Ms. Jolie Pitt was silent on the matter, but Mr. Pitt gave a statement to People magazine: \u201cI am very saddened by this, but what matters most now is the   of our kids. I kindly ask the press to give them the space they deserve during this challenging time. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563996.4231699}
