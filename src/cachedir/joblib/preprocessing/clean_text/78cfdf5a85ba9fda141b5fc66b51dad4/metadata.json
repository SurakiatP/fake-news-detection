Trump, the first president to go directly from the executive suite to the Oval Office. \u201cChaos\u201d seems to be the word most often invoked, closely followed by \u201cturmoil. \u201d (One exception: the White House spokesman, Sean Spicer, who said he preferred \u201c . \u201d) In less than two weeks, Mr. Trump created upheaval at the nation\u2019s borders, alienated longtime allies, roiled markets with talk of a trade war and prompted some of the largest protests any president has faced. The conservative editorial page of The Wall Street Journal bemoaned a refugee policy \u201cso poorly explained and prepared for, that it has produced confusion and fear at airports, an immediate legal defeat, and political fury at home and abroad. \u201d Even the top House Republican, Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who had released a statement praising the immigration order, later distanced himself, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s regrettable that there was some confusion with the rollout. \u201d All new presidents undergo a learning curve. But Mr. Trump promised a seamless transition and, with a real chief executive in charge as opposed to a career politician, an administration that would function as a   machine. So it doesn\u2019t seem premature to ask some leading management experts for an assessment of Mr. Trump\u2019s first weeks, purely from the viewpoint of organizational behavior and management effectiveness, as I did this week. The unanimous verdict: Thus far, the Trump administration is a textbook case of how not to run a complex organization like the executive branch. \u201cThis is so basic, it\u2019s covered in the introduction to the M. B. A. program that all our students take,\u201d said Lindred Greer, an assistant professor of organizational behavior at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. By all outward indications, Mr. Trump \u201cdesperately needs to take the course,\u201d she said. Jeffrey Pfeffer, professor of organizational behavior at Stanford and the author of \u201cPower: Why Some People Have It and Others Don\u2019t,\u201d said Mr. Trump\u2019s executive actions as president \u201care so far from any responsible management approach\u201d that they all but defy analysis. \u201cOf course, this isn\u2019t new,\u201d he told me. \u201cHis campaign also violated every prudent management principle. Everyone including our friends on Wall Street somehow believed that once he was president he\u2019d change. I don\u2019t understand that logic. \u201d Wall Street did take notice. After months of cheering the prospect of tax reform and infrastructure spending, investors sold stocks after a weekend of chaos at the nation\u2019s airports connected to the president\u2019s executive order on immigration. On Monday, the Dow industrials experienced the biggest   decline since the election, fueled by worries that a dysfunctional White House wouldn\u2019t be able to execute Mr. Trump\u2019s policies. \u201cIf you thought immigration was bad, just wait for health care,\u201d Mr. Pfeffer warned. The White House did not respond to requests for comment. There is an enormous amount of literature and data exploring what constitutes effective management of complicated organizations. \u201cThe core principles have served many leaders really well,\u201d said Jeffrey T. Polzer, professor of human resource management at Harvard Business School. \u201cIt\u2019s really common sense: You want to surround yourself with talented people who have the most expertise, who bring different perspectives to the issue at hand. Then you foster debate and invite different points of view in order to reach a   solution. \u201d This is often easier said than done. It \u201crequires an openness to being challenged, and some   and even humility to acknowledge that there are areas where other people know more than you do,\u201d Mr. Polzer continued. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean decisions are made by consensus. The person at the top makes the decisions, but based on the facts and expertise necessary to make a good decision. \u201d Mr. Trump has already violated several of these core principles. The secretary of Homeland Security, John F. Kelly, was still discussing a proposed executive order restricting immigration when Mr. Trump went ahead and signed it. Nor was Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, consulted he saw the final order only hours before it went into effect. Not to consult thoroughly with top cabinet officers before deciding on the order \u201cis insane,\u201d since they \u201chave the expertise and should be on top of the data,\u201d Ms. Greer said. \u201cIgnoring them leads to bad decisions and is also incredibly demoralizing. \u201d And there\u2019s another reason to consult, Mr. Polzer said: \u201cWhen people are genuinely involved in a decision and their input is heard and valued and respected, they are more likely to support and buy into the decision and be motivated to execute to the best of their abilities, even if the decision doesn\u2019t go their way. \u201d Conversely, people who aren\u2019t consulted feel they have no stake in a successful outcome. Far from encouraging and weighing differing views as part of the   process, Mr. Trump appears to view dissension as disloyalty. After career State Department officers circulated a draft cable questioning the effectiveness of the immigration ban, Mr. Spicer responded, \u201cThey should either get with the program or they can go. \u201d \u201cDebate and dissent are essential to reaching any thoughtful outcome,\u201d Ms. Greer said. Comments like Mr. Spicer\u2019s \u201cwill discourage anyone from speaking up. You end up with group think, an echo chamber where people only say what they think the president wants to hear. \u201d And while it\u2019s understandable that the president was eager to act swiftly to follow through on his campaign promises  \u2014   he had made a long list of actions to be carried out on \u201cDay 1\u201d  \u2014   his directives came across as needlessly hasty and poorly thought through. Some had to be reframed (talk of a Mexican border surcharge) or significantly modified and clarified after the fact (immigration policy). I asked the management experts to ignore their views about the merits of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, but all said that execution and substance are inextricably linked. \u201cWhen you\u2019re on the receiving end of a policy decision, the merits of the decision and the execution go hand in hand,\u201d Mr. Polzer said. \u201cIf either one is done poorly, the outcomes will be bad. Even good plans that are poorly rolled out aren\u2019t going to work well. \u201d For many people, the Affordable Care Act was indelibly tainted by the computer malfunctions that plagued its start. Similarly, for many Americans, the enduring image of Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policy will be that of a tearful Iraqi immigrant who was detained at Kennedy International Airport after risking his life working as a translator for the American military over a   period. (He was released after lawyers intervened on his behalf.) That prompted even Mr. Ryan to say, \u201cNo one wanted to see people with green cards or special immigrant visas, like translators, get caught up in all of this. \u201d Some Trump defenders have said that the president thrives on chaos, and it has proved to be an effective management approach for him in the past. But every expert I consulted said there is no empirical data or research that supports the notion that chaos is a productive management tool. \u201cI\u2019m not aware of anyone who advocates that,\u201d Mr. Polzer said. \u201cI don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on in the White House, so I don\u2019t feel comfortable commenting on that specifically. But I can say in general that in organizational settings, less chaos is a good thing. \u201d Everyone agreed that there was still time for Mr. Trump to right the ship. Other administrations have had course corrections and personnel  . But having to reorganize only weeks into a first term is not promising. If this were the private sector, \u201csomeone would be fired,\u201d Ms. Greer said. That seems highly unlikely, since Mr. Trump has not even acknowledged a problem, instead blaming the media for an impression of upheaval in the White House. That is a fundamental problem, Mr. Pfeffer said. \u201cNo good business makes decisions that are based on falsehoods,\u201d he said. \u201cMy sense is that Trump takes no one\u2019s counsel but his own. That\u2019s bad management, period. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563378.4165292}
