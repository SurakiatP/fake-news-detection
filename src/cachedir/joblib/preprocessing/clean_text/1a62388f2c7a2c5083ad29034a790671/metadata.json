If you\u2019re having trouble naming the show, it\u2019s because there isn\u2019t just one that commences this way. The   awkward sex scene has become a staple of the modern television series opener. And while it can seem like merely a (now hackneyed) storytelling device, its prevalence may also reflect recent tectonic shifts in heterosexual politics. First, a rundown of some examples (with a tip of the hat to Benjamin R. Cohen, a professor in engineering at Lafayette College, who alerted me to the trend): In \u201cLove,\u201d we are treated to no fewer than three sex scenes within the first six minutes, the most dramatically significant one being the male protagonist having stiff, monotonous sex with his aloof girlfriend, both of them still wearing tops, as he asks her to move in with him. (She says yes a month later, in their next scene together, she breaks up with him.) In \u201cTogetherness\u201d (canceled by HBO after its second season) the male lead attempts to initiate   sex with his wife. When rebuffed, he begins masturbating, hoping she won\u2019t notice. She does, and kicks him out of bed, but not before asking him to take the baby monitor with him. \u201cMaster of None\u201d opens with a   accident during a   stand. The two characters end up doing an online search for the risk of impregnation from   fluid (and, in learning about it, he admits that he masturbated before going out that night). The two leads of \u201cBroad City\u201d are having a   conversation on their laptops it is later revealed that Ilana has been having sex with a guy during their talk while Abby has been engaged in a \u201cscheduled\u201d masturbation session. Some of this litany has to do with the medium. As an   narrative strategy, depicting sex (erotically or not, \u00e0 deux or solo) invariably succeeds. Comedy, for which all of the shows in question aim, doesn\u2019t play well with dim lighting, sultry music and simultaneous orgasms. Furthermore, TV writers, especially those in mostly   premium cable and streaming TV, are undoubtedly eager to push the envelope of frank realism in a less puritanical era. Yet, perhaps, a bigger engine for the proliferation of awkward sex scenes is the change occurring in the contemporary bedroom. Compare the aforementioned shows to how \u201cSex and the City\u201d began in 1998, with Carrie\u2019s   relating the tale of a seemingly storybook romance (replete with \u201cwonderful\u201d sex, filmed in moonlight with silhouetted figures) that, inevitably, crumbles because of yet another noncommittal \u201ctoxic bachelor. \u201d In Carrie\u2019s first sex scene, she is gratified by cunnilingus before turning down a request for fellatio and skedaddling off to work. The mood is not one of unease or embarrassment, but empowerment through role reversal. \u201cI\u2019d done it,\u201d she proudly tells the viewer. \u201cI\u2019d just had sex like a man. \u201d The   show \u201cmade big headway\u201d when it came to women \u201ctalking about their sex lives in a public forum,\u201d said Sarah Heyward, a   on \u201cGirls. \u201d \u201cIf the public is forced to get more O. K. with women talking graphically about their sex lives, inevitably on TV we\u2019ll see women being more aggressive and being the initiator. \u201d \u201cSex and the City\u201d not only paved the way for onscreen representation of women with more sexual agency, but also underscored a sea change in how both genders approach love and lust behind closed doors. After the \u201cBroad City\u201d scene ends, the guy in bed (Hannibal Buress) asks: \u201cWhat are we? Are we just having sex, hooking up, dating? What is this?\u201d \u201cThis is   \u2026     purely physical,\u201d Ilana says. \u201cWhy does this always happen to me?\u201d he wonders aloud. Two decades ago, it\u2019s doubtful a male character would have uttered such a lament on television unless it was played for straight laughs. On \u201cBroad City,\u201d though, it reads as a sign of the times: A woman can have sex \u201clike a man,\u201d as per Carrie\u2019s declaration, and a man can express emotions as vulnerably as women have historically done. While this progressive movement toward equality ideally results in more satisfying romantic lives for all parties, television has mined the oftentimes vexed and perplexing renegotiations of status for humorous material. Consider an example from the pilot episode of \u201cGirls\u201d (which doesn\u2019t open the show but takes place a demure 15 minutes in). The elusive and carnally adventurous Adam instructs Hannah to hold a physically uncomfortable sexual position. What follows is a superb comic scene pitting Hannah\u2019s verbally open vulnerability and desire to please  \u2014   up to a point  \u2014   in conflict with Adam\u2019s inarticulate desire that is unconcerned with her needs. The end result is a dampening of arousal for both parties. To a degree, theirs is a   pairing: the laconic, detached Adam, one of Carrie\u2019s \u201ctoxic bachelors,\u201d with the garrulous, needy Hannah. (In subsequent episodes, Hannah plays the role of the initiator more frequently, often to amusing results.) And, obviously, moments just like this took place in real life before the sexual revolution they just couldn\u2019t have been shown on TV. Yet they were likely far less commonplace than now, and the particulars of their arrangement would have been very different (for starters, back then,   Adam and Hannah would have more realistically been married, not having exploratory casual sex). Gus, the nerdy male protagonist of \u201cLove,\u201d is closer to Mr. Buress\u2019s character on \u201cBroad City\u201d than he is to Adam, and he struggles with the problems presented by his own inclination to   romance. \u201cThe show is trying to explore the limits of being sensitive,\u201d said Paul Rust, who plays Gus (and is the   of the series with his wife, Lesley Arfin). \u201cMaybe during sex is not the best time to ask if you want to move in together. That might not necessarily be a   in bed. It\u2019s pragmatic dirty talk. \u201d \u201cLove\u201d seems to posit that behind the genial, meek facade of the domesticated millennial guy lurks the atavistic anger and repressed hostility of the male animal. \u201cWhat am I?\u201d Gus demands of his girlfriend as they fight during their breakup. \u201cAm I too nice? Am I too mean?\u201d She yells back: \u201cYou\u2019re not nice! You\u2019re   which is worse than being mean. \u201d Gus\u2019s erratic navigation between the Scylla and Charybdis of domineering   and emasculated   behavior  \u2014   the former no longer as socially acceptable as it used to be, the latter still not doing one many favors even on Tinder, let alone at a bar  \u2014   constitutes much of the show\u2019s subtext (and comedy). \u201cYou can do this, Gus,\u201d he tells himself in a bathroom mirror, trying to psych himself up before approaching a girl at a party. \u201cYou\u2019re the man. You\u2019re   \u2026     like a man. You\u2019re close to being a man. \u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s confusing for men: \u2018Be like Don Draper, but also be this nice guy,\u2019\u201d said Daley Haggar, who has written for sitcoms like \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d and \u201cAnger Management. \u201d Jon Hamm\u2019s character on \u201cMad Men\u201d may have been one of the more attractive leading men on TV to female viewers in recent memory, but Ms. Haggar pointed out that much of his conduct would be considered   or inappropriate in the 21st century. \u201cWomen fantasize about Don, but they don\u2019t want an actual Don,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s cold and mildly sociopathic and he cheats. What they want is Jon Hamm dressed up in a suit doing a sort of cosplay of a \u201950s stoic guy and being dominant. What he does, you\u2019d be arrested for now. \u201d Moreover, she added,   intercourse with a figure like Don probably wasn\u2019t all it\u2019s cracked up to be on the show. \u201cI don\u2019t know that there were great orgasms with Don Draper,\u201d she said. Mr. Rust looked to a different decade, the 1970s, as a bridge between the eras portrayed by \u201cMad Men\u201d and the current crop of shows, and noted a possible subconscious influence in opening \u201cLove\u201d with an anticlimactic sex scene. His favorite film, 1975\u2019s \u201cShampoo,\u201d begins with Warren Beatty\u2019s Lothario hairdresser having sex as another woman interrupts with a phone call. Watching it for the first time was a revelation. \u201cThere was a relief for me: \u2018Oh, man, even Warren Beatty can have awkward sex,\u2019\u201d he recalled. His acting turn may have similar repercussions for today\u2019s young men exploring their own sensitive sides, including those who may appear at first glance not to have any. \u201cI was at an A. T. M. a couple weeks ago, and a    dude walked up to me,\u201d Mr. Rust said. \u201cHe   me and said, \u2018Dude, thanks for the vulnerability. \u2019\u201d'"}, "time": 1742628610.208536}
