It hasn\u2019t even been 2 months since she dropped like a rock on 9/11 and had to be hurled into the back of the van by Secret Service, and she clearly isn\u2019t any better\u2026 \\nThe video shows Hillary confronted with ONE \u201912 INCH STEP that she would have to step up onto in order to speak, AND SHE WASN\u2019T ABLE TO DO IT! Her campaign staffer RUSHED to her aid to grasp her hand and arm to push her up onto the riser to keep her from falling again! (Scroll down for video) \\nOkay, it wasn\u2019t technically a \u201cmedical emergency\u201d but it would\u2019ve been if her staffer wasn\u2019t there to grab her! Watch how he rushed to grab her so he could help her CONQUER this 12 inch step she had to take. \\nCAN REALLY ELECT SOMEONE AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WHO CANNOT CLIMB UP ONE 12 INCH STEP???? \\nIS THAT \u2018SEXIST\u2019 TO WANT A PRESIDENT WHO WILL BE ABLE TO WALK AROUND THE WHITE HOUSE WITHOUT A WALKER?? \\nWATCH for yourself: Hillary heads over to the overflow area to say hello to the crowd in Lake Worth, Florida. But ya know, no enthusiasm there. \ud83d\ude44 pic.twitter.com/3cUDK245XK \\n\u2014 (\u2310\u25a0_\u25a0)\u30ceHillBro (@HillBroYo) October 26, 2016 \\nTHIS WOULDN\u2019T BE THAT TROUBLING ON IT\u2019S OWN, BUT CONSIDER WHAT WE ALREADY KONW ABOUT HILLARY\u2019S HEALTH! \\nShe passed out cold on a sidewalk and was drug and then flung into a van like a slab of meat (then blamed pneumonia) \\nShe\u2019s been coughing non-stop since 2008: \\nShe reportedly now has an ambulance in her motorcade. \\nA \u201cstroke score\u201d finger-squeeze test was administered the day she collapsed on 9/11. \\nOh yea, like we learned today she can\u2019t walk up stairs\u2026 \\nSHARE on Facebook because we know the mainstream media won\u2019t cover it!
