But what they did not know was that the film\u2019s striking appearance had been created by a Chinese immigrant artist, who took as his inspiration the landscape paintings of the Song dynasty. The extent of his contribution to \u201cBambi,\u201d which remains a   mark for film animation, would not be widely known for decades. Like the film\u2019s title character, the artist, Tyrus Wong, weathered irrevocable separation from his mother  \u2014   and, in the hope of making a life in America, incarceration, isolation and rigorous interrogation  \u2014   all when he was still a child. In the years that followed, he endured poverty, discrimination and chronic lack of recognition, not only for his work at Disney but also for his fine art, before finding acclaim in his 90s. Mr. Wong died on Friday at 106. A Hollywood studio artist, painter, printmaker, calligrapher,   illustrator and, in later years, maker of fantastical kites, he was one of the most celebrated   artists of the 20th century. But because of the marginalization to which   were long subject, he passed much of his career unknown to the general public. Artistic recognition, when Mr. Wong did find it, was all the more noteworthy for the fact that among Chinese immigrant men of his generation, professional prospects were largely limited to menial jobs like houseboy and laundryman. Trained as a painter, Mr. Wong was a leading figure in the Modernist movement that flourished in California between the first and second World Wars. In 1932 and again in 1934, his work was included in group shows at the Art Institute of Chicago that also featured Picasso, Matisse and Paul Klee. As a staff artist for Hollywood studios from the 1930s to the 1960s, he drew storyboards and made vibrant paintings, as detailed as any architectural illustrations, that helped the director envision each scene before it was shot. Over the years his work informed the look of animated pictures for Disney and   films for Warner Brothers and other studios, among them \u201cThe Sands of Iwo Jima\u201d (1949) \u201cRebel Without a Cause\u201d (1955) and \u201cThe Wild Bunch\u201d (1969). But of the dozens of films on which he worked, it was for \u201cBambi\u201d that Mr. Wong was  \u2014   belatedly  \u2014   most renowned. \u201cHe was truly involved with every phase of production,\u201d John Canemaker, an   animator and a historian of animation at New York University, said in an interview for this obituary in March. \u201cHe created an art direction that had really never been seen before in animation. \u201d In 2013 and 2014, Mr. Wong was the subject of \u201cWater to Paper, Paint to Sky,\u201d a major retrospective at the Disney Family Museum in San Francisco. From the museum\u2019s windows, which overlook San Francisco Bay, he could contemplate Angel Island, where more than nine decades earlier, as a lone    he had sought to gain admission to a country that adamantly did not want him. Wong Gen Yeo (the name is sometimes Romanized Wong Gaing Yoo) was born on Oct. 25, 1910, in a farming village in Guangdong Province. As a young child, he already exhibited a love of drawing and was encouraged by his father. In 1920, seeking better economic prospects, Gen Yeo and his father embarked for the United States, leaving his mother and sister behind. Gen Yeo would never see his mother again. They were obliged to travel under false identities  \u2014   a state of affairs known among Chinese immigrants as being a \u201cpaper son\u201d  \u2014   in the hope of circumventing the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. Signed into law by President Chester A. Arthur, the act, which drastically curtailed the number of Chinese people allowed to enter the country, was among the earliest United States laws to impose severe restrictions on immigration. But in 1906, an unforeseen loophole opened in the form of the San Francisco earthquake and fire. Because a huge number of municipal documents, including birth and immigration records, were destroyed, many newly arrived Chinese capitalized on the loss, maintaining that they had been born in San Francisco before the fire. As United States citizens, they were entitled to bring over their relatives  \u2014   or, in the case of Gen Yeo and his father, \u201cpaper sons\u201d posing as relatives. Attuned to the deception, United States immigration officials put Chinese arrivals through a formidable inquisition to ensure they were who they claimed to be. The questions came like gunfire: In which direction does your village face? How many windows are in your house? Where in the house is the rice bin? How wide is your well? How deep? Are there trees in your village? Are there lakes? What shops can you name? The sponsoring relative was interrogated separately, and the answers had to match. For the new arrival, a major mistake, or a series of smaller ones, could mean deportation. To stand a chance of passing, aspirants memorized rigorous dossiers known as coaching papers. The ensuing interrogation was hard enough for adults.    Gen Yeo would undergo it alone. On Dec. 30, 1920, after a month at sea, the Wongs landed at Angel Island Immigration Station. The elder Mr. Wong was traveling as a merchant named Look Get his son as Look Tai Yow. \u201cAngel Island is considered to be the Ellis Island of the West Coast,\u201d Lisa See, the author of \u201cOn Gold Mountain\u201d (1995) a nonfiction chronicle of her   family, said in an interview in 2016. However, she continued: \u201cThe goal was really very different than Ellis Island, which was supposed to be so welcoming. Angel Island opened very specifically to keep the Chinese out. \u201d Because Mr. Wong\u2019s father had previously lived in the United States as Look Get, he was able to clear Immigration quickly. But as a new arrival, Gen Yeo was detained on the island for nearly a month, the only child among the immigrants being held there. \u201cI was scared half to death I just cried,\u201d Mr. Wong recalled in \u201cTyrus,\u201d an   documentary directed by Pamela Tom, which premiered in 2015. \u201cEvery day is just miserable  \u2014   miserable. I hated that place. \u201d On Jan. 27, 1921, in the presence of an interpreter and a stenographer, young Gen Yeo, posing as Look Tai Yow, was interrogated by three inspectors. His father had already been questioned. Gen Yeo was well prepared and answered without error. In Sacramento, where he joined his father, a schoolteacher Americanized \u201cTai Yow\u201d to \u201cTyrus,\u201d and he was known as Tyrus Wong ever after. Soon afterward, father and son were separated once more, when the elder Mr. Wong moved to Los Angeles to seek work. For reasons that have been lost to time, he could not take his son. Tyrus lived on his own in a Sacramento boardinghouse while attending elementary school. Two years later  \u2014   possibly more  \u2014   Tyrus traveled to Los Angeles to join his father, who had found work in a gambling den. They lived in a   boardinghouse sandwiched between a butcher shop and a brothel. After school, Tyrus worked as a houseboy for two Pasadena families, earning 50 cents a day. His first art teacher was his father, who trained him nightly in calligraphy by having him dip a brush in water and trace ghostly characters on newspaper: They could not afford ink or drawing paper. When Tyrus was in junior high, a teacher, noting his drawing talent, arranged a summer scholarship to the Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles. By his own account an indifferent student in public school, Tyrus found his calling at the institute, now the Otis College of Art and Design. When his scholarship ended he declined to return to junior high. His father scraped together the $90 tuition  \u2014   a small fortune  \u2014   to let him stay on as Otis\u2019s youngest student. He studied there for at least five years, simultaneously working as the school janitor, before graduating in the 1930s. Not long afterward his father died, leaving young Mr. Wong entirely on his own. From 1936 to 1938, Mr. Wong was an artist for the Works Progress Administration, creating paintings for libraries and other public spaces. With friends, including the   artist Benji Okubo, he founded the Oriental Artists\u2019 Group of Los Angeles, which organized exhibitions of members\u2019 work  \u2014   an   level of exposure for Asian artists at the time. Mr. Wong, newly married and needing steady work, joined Disney in 1938 as an \u201c\u201d creating the thousands of intermediate drawings that bring animated sequences to life. Asians were then a novelty at Hollywood studios, and Mr. Wong was made keenly aware of the fact, first at Disney and later at Warner Brothers. One   flung a racial epithet at him. Another assumed on sight that he worked in the company cafeteria. Then there was the affront of the  \u2019s job itself: Painstaking, repetitive and for Mr. Wong quickly   it is the   work of animation  \u2014   \u201ca terrible use of his talents as a landscape artist and a painter,\u201d Mr. Canemaker said. A reprieve came in the late 1930s, when Mr. Wong learned that Disney was adapting \u201cBambi, a Life in the Woods,\u201d the 1923 novel by the Austrian writer Felix Salten about a fawn whose mother is killed by a hunter. In trying to animate the book, Disney had reached an impasse. The studio had enjoyed great success in 1937 with its animated film \u201cSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs,\u201d a baroque production in which every detail of the backgrounds  \u2014   every petal on every flower, every leaf on every tree  \u2014   was meticulously represented. In an attempt to use a similar style for \u201cBambi,\u201d it found that the ornate backgrounds camouflaged the deer and other forest creatures on which the narrative centered. Mr. Wong spied his chance. \u201cI said, \u2018Gee, this is all outdoor scenery,\u2019\u201d he recalled in a video interview years afterward, adding: \u201cI said, \u2018Gee, I\u2019m a landscape painter! \u2019\u201d Invoking the exquisite landscape paintings of the Song dynasty (A. D. 960 \u2014  1279) he rendered in watercolors and pastels a series of nature scenes that were moody, lyrical and atmospheric  \u2014   at once lush and spare  \u2014   with backgrounds subtly suggested by a stroke or two of the brush. \u201cWalt Disney went crazy over them,\u201d said Mr. Canemaker, who wrote about Mr. Wong in his book \u201cBefore the Animation Begins: The Art and Lives of Disney Inspirational Sketch Artists\u201d (1996). \u201cHe said, \u2018I love this indefinite quality, the mysterious quality of the forest. \u2019\u201d Mr. Wong was unofficially promoted to the rank of inspirational sketch artist. \u201cBut he was more than that,\u201d Mr. Canemaker explained. \u201cHe was the designer he was the person they went to when they had questions about the color, about how to lay something out. He even influenced the music and the special effects: Just by the look of the drawings, he inspired people. \u201d Mr. Wong spent two years painting the illustrations that would inform every aspect of \u201cBambi. \u201d Throughout the finished film  \u2014   lent a brooding quality by its stark landscapes misty, desaturated palette and figures often seen in silhouette  \u2014   his influence is unmistakable. But in 1941, in the wake of a bitter employees\u2019 strike that year, Disney fired Mr. Wong. Though he had chosen not to strike  \u2014   he felt the studio had been good to him, Mr. Canemaker said  \u2014   he was let go amid the lingering climate of   resentments. On \u201cBambi,\u201d Mr. Wong\u2019s name appears, quite far down in the credits, as a mere \u201cbackground\u201d artist. Mr. Wong joined Warner Brothers in 1942, working there  \u2014   and lent out on occasion to other studios  \u2014   until his retirement in 1968. The indignities he endured were not confined to the studios. Trying to buy a house, he and his wife, the former Ruth Kim, were told that each property they inquired about had just been sold. \u201cThen in a month you\u2019d go back there and the sign was still there,\u201d Mr. Wong recalled in \u201cTyrus. \u201d After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Mr. Wong, like many   took to wearing a lapel button proclaiming his heritage, lest an angry American beat him up on the street. The war permanently dispersed the fledgling Oriental Artists\u2019 Group. Mr. Wong\u2019s friend Mr. Okubo was sent, with tens of thousands of other   to an internment camp. \u201cIf World War II hadn\u2019t happened when it did, I think these artists, even the   artists, would have more of a name than they do today,\u201d Ms. See said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s because this little movement that had just barely started was split apart by the war. \u201d Mr. Wong, who became a United States citizen in 1946, also designed Christmas cards for Hallmark and painted elegant   designs on dinnerware, now sought after by collectors. A longtime resident of Sunland, Calif. he became, in retirement, a renowned kitemaker, designing, building and hand coloring astonishing, airworthy creations  \u2014   butterflies, swallows, whole flocks of owls, centipedes more than 100 feet long  \u2014   that streaked the Southern California sky like paint on blue canvas. During the last 15 years of Ruth Wong\u2019s life, when she was ill with dementia, Mr. Wong forsook his work to care for her. After her death in 1995, he slowly began making art again. In 2001, in formal recognition of his influence on \u201cBambi,\u201d Mr. Wong was named a Disney Legend. The honor  \u2014   whose previous recipients include Fred MacMurray, Julie Andrews and Annette Funicello  \u2014   is bestowed by the Walt Disney Company for outstanding contributions. In 2003, a retrospective of his work, curated in part by Ms. See, was the inaugural exhibition at the Chinese American Museum in Los Angeles. The Disney Family Museum\u2019s retrospective, \u201cWater to Paper, Paint to Sky,\u201d traveled in 2015 to the Museum of Chinese in America, in Lower Manhattan. Mr. Wong\u2019s death, at his home in Sunland, was confirmed by the filmmaker Ms. Tom. His survivors include three daughters, Kay Fong,   Wong and Kim Wong and two grandchildren. When his daughters were small, Mr. Wong encouraged them to make art, as his father had encouraged him. Yet he would not let them have coloring books. The reason was simple: He did not want his children constrained, he said, by lines laid down by others.'"}, "time": 1742563367.3699574}
