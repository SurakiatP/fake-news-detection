It may look as if the athletes are simply gesticulating emphatically, flinging themselves around in improbable aquatic configurations, and executing shockingly complex leg movements while upside down and not breathing. But that\u2019s not the half of it. Each synchro routine also has an elaborate theme, and each theme must be conveyed with grace, precision and dramatically relevant facial gestures, as well as moves like the catalina rotation (rotate your body while holding your leg,   in the air) and the vertical descent (descend, straight upside down, until your toes are submerged). The athletes also have to do each move at the same time and make it seem fun and not hard at all, even when they are heaving, hypoxic and about to pass out. Judged for their artistic as well as athletic skills, synchro swimmers put considerable effort into their themes and choreography. The stories can celebrate a nation\u2019s history and culture evoke classic tales, ballets, songs and myths mimic natural phenomena or abstract principles and, in the case of \u201cFury,\u201d the American duo\u2019s free routine theme in Rio, convey a mood itself. Sometimes the themes are obvious and careworn: Every competition seems to include at least one \u201cSwan Lake\u201d (hello, Austria). They can also be hideously ill conceived. In 1996, for instance, the French synchro team picked an unusual subject for the Olympics: the Holocaust. The routine began with the athletes   on the deck like Nazis and ended with them being rounded up and sent to the (figurative) gas chamber in the pool. After an international outcry, the team switched to a different topic, although its trainer, Odile Petit, tried to argue that the routine was no more offensive than the one \u201cdepicting torture in Chile\u201d performed by the national   team. One strange feature of the sport is that despite all the attention lavished on the themes, even the judges cannot always work out what they are. \u201cNot all the judges get the story,\u201d said Irene Hawes, a longtime synchro judge. Take the \u201cFirebird\u201d suite by Stravinsky, she said. \u201cThere\u2019s the phoenix rising and the battle and all that. A lot of people don\u2019t know that. \u201d She continued, \u201cI remember one routine was meant to be a tumbleweed, and the athletes were rolling along the deck, and people were wondering what they were doing. \u201d She figured it out, she said, only when the competition ended and \u201cthe country handed out a flier. \u201d Still, synchro athletes said, the narratives help both them and the spectators. \u201cIt\u2019s much more interesting to watch a routine that has a specific theme in it,\u201d said Bianca Hammett, captain of the Australian synchro team. She said the team\u2019s free routine was \u201ca journey through the unique flora and fauna of Australia. \u201d It features both the obvious (crocodiles: athletes\u2019 legs snapping open and shut) and the not. \u201cWe have a lizards\u2019 dance party,\u201d Hammett said. \u201cWe put our hands near our heads, like we\u2019re mimicking lizards. \u201d Many synchro teams pick themes celebrating their countries. The Spanish duo in Rio is doing a Flamenco routine while the Brazilians are depicting natural life in the Amazon. Britain is representing snakes (always popular, because of their watery sinuousness) the Kazakhs, ravens. The Swiss theme is \u201cOrient bazaar,\u201d whatever that means, while the French, with renewed Gallic ambition, have selected \u201cAfrica. \u201d The Russians, who almost always win, are modestly pretending to be mermaids. Another challenge: The choreography has to fit the music. \u201cIf you used a ballet but did, like,   movements, we would see it as strange,\u201d Hawes said. \u201cSame thing if it has a crescendo and you\u2019re doing absolutely nothing but laying on your back. If it has a winding type of sound, which wants spinning, and you\u2019re doing marches  \u2014   these are factors. \u201d Every judge has pet peeves. Many people at the 2012 London Games did not care for Canada\u2019s team program, which looked more like an Esther Williams extravaganza than a sports routine and which Hawes denounced as \u201cgross. \u201d \u201cIt had to do with their headgear  \u2014   large swimming caps covered with plastic flowers  \u2014   their extreme facial moves, and the spitting of water,\u201d Hawes said. As for Linda Loehndorf, another judge  \u2014   spare her the circus programs. \u201cIt\u2019s like, ugh,\u201d she said. \u201cI get it. You\u2019re a clown. You don\u2019t need to stick your tongue out at me. \u201d And then there are particularly memorable performances. Last year, for instance, China unveiled an electrifying routine that at first seemed destined for clich\u00e9 corner. \u201cI thought, Oh, jeez, not that again  \u2014   \u2018The Phantom of the Opera,\u2019\u201d Loehndorf said. \u201cIt\u2019s something you hear over and over again. But they managed to tell the whole story in four and a half minutes, and I got it completely. It was a     sort of thing. \u201d And people still speak with awe about Spain\u2019s daring 2009 performance to \u201cStairway to Heaven,\u201d the cryptic song that launched a thousand sweaty slow dances. For those who have long been made to wonder, the team\u2019s interpretation of the always challenging \u201cbustle in your hedgerow\u201d lyric offered as plausible an explanation as any. There was a line of athletes lying    in the water, arms and legs stretched out, possibly like a hedge wearing a selection of bathing suits there were two athletes off to the side, performing what was surely a bustle. \u201cIt was gorgeous,\u201d Loehndorf said.'"}, "time": 1742563676.898011}
