[A panel of school administrators are in charge of selecting the professor for the award, which gives the chosen faculty member a chance to speak at Orange Coast College\u2019s commencement ceremony.  The professor in question, Olga Perez   declined the award for an unspecified reason, according to Doug Bennet, executive director of college advancement at OCC. Even though Cox turned down the award, some people at the school think the faculty\u2019s decision to nominate her was wrong in the first place, given what she said last semester. \u201cThe fact that the faculty chose professor Cox for the faculty member of the year award speaks volumes to how blind they are about what she did last semester,\u201d said Joshua     of OCC\u2019s College Republicans group. On Saturday, campus police discovered graffiti targeting the OCC College Republicans and  . \u201cDoxx Joshua Martinez OCC Young Republicans = Fascists,\u201d one graffiti message read, according to the Los Angeles Times.   says that Cox probably did not accept the nomination because of these recent events. \u201cShe understood the impact that accepting the nomination could have on the campus climate, and that is why she refused,\u201d   said.  \u2019s group is the same group responsible for posting the video of Cox\u2019s comments on Facebook. In her comments, Cox blamed the Electoral College for Trump\u2019s win and and said that the \u201cact of terrorism\u201d was committed by someone \u201camong us. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s an act of terrorism. One of the most frightening things for me, and most people in my life, is that the people committing the assault are among us,\u201d Cox said. The college recently rescinded the suspension of the student who recorded Cox in class.'"}, "time": 1742561894.5642352}
