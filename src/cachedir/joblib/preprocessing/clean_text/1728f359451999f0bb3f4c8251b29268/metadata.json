[Kim Howells, who oversaw the work of MI5 and MI6 during the Blair and Brown years, said Islamist violence is distinct from other forms of terror and Western values such as democracy must be defended.  \u201cI was part of a Government that said: \u2018Well, we don\u2019t do God.\u2019 But you can\u2019t afford not to do God on this one, I think,\u201d he told Wales Online. \u201cThese people aren\u2019t motivated  \u2014   not on the most part, anyway  \u2014   by money or some kind of nationalism. It\u2019s different from the IRA. These people are prepared to kill themselves and they do it because they think it\u2019s a shortcut to paradise  \u2026     \u201cUnless people have enough courage to take that on and try and convince young people that the Caliphate is not a better way of running society than a democracy they are going to be lured to these organisations. \u201d Whilst some say Islamic terror is largely driven by grievances such as \u201cIslamophobia\u201d \u201calienation\u201d and Western foreign policy, Mr. Howells argues it is necessary to appreciate the importance of theological turmoil going on within Islam. \u201cThese guys are not just trying to kill unbelievers and Christians and so on. Their main enemy is another form of Islam,\u201d he said, referring to the violent schism between Sunni and Shia Islam. Many other nations and ethnic groups have been affected by foreign interventions and discrimination, yet the vast majority of recent terror attacks have occurred in countries afflicted by Islamist insurgencies. According to the Global Terrorism Database, in 2015, \u201c69% of all deaths due to terrorist attacks took place in five countries (Iraq, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Syria, and Yemen)\u201d. Terrorists returning from these conflict zones present a real challenge to the UK. Between 700 and 1, 500 Brits have travelled to join Islamic State terrorists, and Mr. Howell said former jihadists should be a \u201creal worry\u201d for the security of the nation. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a significant proportion of those people who are determined to carry on the fight here. They\u2019ve been trained in how to use guns and how to construct bombs,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are going to have to be watched very carefully. But just to watch one person takes a large number of people and a lot of money. \u201cHow on earth you keep tabs on 400 or 500 people at any given time as well as those who never went to Syria but you judge are posing a threat is not easy. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628583.8449407}
