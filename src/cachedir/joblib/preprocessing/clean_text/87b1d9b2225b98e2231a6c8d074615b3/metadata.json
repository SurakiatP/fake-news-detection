The goal would be to accelerate what United States officials said on Saturday was momentum behind Iraqi security forces and   rebels in Syria fighting the terrorist organization. Inside Syria, the administration is prepared to add dozens of Special Operations forces to the 50 who now advise and assist Syrian rebels fighting the Islamic State, say three Defense Department and military officials. The additional trainers, who could total as many as 200, would be able to expand their instruction to Syrian Arab fighters, who are likely to play a pivotal role in capturing Raqqa, the Islamic State\u2019s de facto capital in Syria, the officials said. The administration\u2019s plans for Iraq are more complicated. Pentagon officials would like to increase efforts to advise and train Iraqi security forces for the anticipated assault on Mosul, Iraq\u2019s second largest city and the Islamic State\u2019s main stronghold in the country. The plan calls for shifting trainers who are already in the country to positions closer to Mosul, the officials said. They would also like to deploy Apache helicopter gunships  \u2014   which are already in Iraq, but used only to protect American personnel  \u2014   and order them to participate in the battle for Mosul. But the government of Iraq\u2019s prime minister, Haider   has been battling internal political turmoil. His challenges include political opponents, rampant corruption and an economy weakened by low oil prices. The military options under consideration  \u2014   which could be announced in the next several days  \u2014   were described by five Defense Department and military officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because final decisions are pending in Washington and Baghdad. Administration officials said on Saturday that announcing or even proposing increased American assistance is a delicate diplomatic task that could further imperil Mr. Abadi\u2019s position. Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter made clear on Saturday that the administration will increase its military efforts to defeat the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, but he did not discuss specifics. \u201cYou should expect us, to see us, doing more,\u201d he said at a news conference at the Al Dhafra air base as he opened travels in the Middle East. \u201cIt will be consistent with the same approach, but it\u2019ll be across all the domains, right up to cyber. \u201d Mr. Carter described the administration\u2019s approach as one that will use members of the American armed services to help accelerate the military campaign against the Islamic State, but will not replace Iraqi security forces or Syrian rebels. There are roughly 5, 000 American service members in Iraq, according to current Pentagon estimates, but the number often varies, sometimes daily, by hundreds. Mr. Carter\u2019s comments come at a time when Iraqi militias and military forces have been making notable progress on the battlefield against the Islamic State, including seizing parts of Hit, a city in Anbar Province, this month. Last Wednesday, Col. Steven H. Warren, the military spokesman in Iraq, said that the initial phase of the   campaign against the Islamic State, with the intent of degrading or weakening the fighters, was complete, and that allied forces were in the second phase of the operation. \u201cDuring this phase, we will enable our partners to dismantle the enemy, fragment his forces, isolate his centers of gravity and liberate the terrain he holds,\u201d he said. But even as the campaign against the Islamic State is showing gains in Iraq and Syria, the group\u2019s franchises in places like Libya, as well as its external operations in Europe, are increasingly lethal. On Saturday, Mr. Carter met with American service members, including pilots, who are stationed at the Al Dhafra air base and are part of the air campaign over Iraq and Syria. He said that in the coming days he would be meeting with American commanders leading the efforts to defeat the Islamic State. \u201cWe continue to look for, and identify ways of accelerating that, and as we find those we will do them,\u201d Mr. Carter said, adding that the administration would seek the approval of Iraqi government there. Mr. Carter said that gaining the support of President Obama to do more in Iraq has not been an obstacle. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten approval from the White House every time the chairman and I have gone to ask for something that we\u2019ve needed to accelerate going way back to last year,\u201d Mr. Carter said, referring to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford, Jr. who will also be traveling in the region in the coming days. \u201cSo that isn\u2019t really the issue for us, the issue for us is yet identifying more ways to accelerate the campaign. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561859.8326902}
