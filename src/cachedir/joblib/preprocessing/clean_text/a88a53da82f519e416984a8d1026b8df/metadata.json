Twice the sound of their voices and the sudden glow of their bedroom Iights interrupted him and frightened him off. Each time he returned, sought her out and stabbed her again. Not one person telephoned \u2010 the po lice during the assault one wit ness called after the woman was dead.\u2019 \u201dThat was two weeks ago to day. But Assistant Chief In spector Frederick M. Lussen, in charge of the borough\u2019s detec tives and a veteran of 25 years of homicide investigations, is still shocked.\u201d \u2019He can give a matter\u2010of\u2010fact recitation of many murders. But the Kew Gardens slaying baffles him\u2010not because it is a murder, but because the \u201cgood people\u201d failed to call the police. \u201cAs we have reconstructed the crime,\u201d he said, \u201cthe assail ant had three chances to kill this woman during a 35\u2010minute period. He returned twice to complete the job. If we had been called when he first at tacked, the woman might not be dead now. \u201d This is what the police say happened beginnang at 3:20 A. M. in the staid, middle\u2010cIass, tree\u2010lined Austin Street area: Twenty\u2010eight\u2010year\u2010o1d Cath erine Genovese, who was called Kitty by almost everyone in the neighborhood, was returning She turned off the lights of her car, locked the door and started to walk the 100 feet to the entrance of her apartment at 82\u201070 Austin Street, which is in a Tudor building, with stores on the first floor and apartments on the second. The entrance to the apart ment is in the rear of the   ing because the front is rented to retail stores. At night the quiet neighborhood is shrouded in the slumbering darkness that marks most residential areas. Miss Genovese noticed a man at the far end of the lot, near a seven\u2010story apartment house at 82\u201040 Austin Street. She halted. Then, nervously, she headed up Austin Street to ward Lefferts Boulevard, where there is a call box to the 102d police Precinct in nearby Rich mond Hill. \u2018He Stabbed Me!\u2019 She got as far as a street light in front of a bookstore before the man grabbed her. she screamed. Lights went on in the 10\u2010story apartment house at 82\u201067. Austin Street, which faces the bookstore. Windows slid open and voices punctured the early\u2010morning stillness. Miss Genovese screamed: oh, my God, he stabbed me! Please help me! Please help me !\u201d From one of the upper win down in the apartment house, a man called down: \u201cLet that girl alone !\u201d The assailant looked up at him, shrugged and walked down Austin Street toward a white sedan parked a short distance away. Miss Genovese struggled to her feet. Lights went out. The killer returned to Miss Genovese, now trying to make her way around the side of the building by the parking lot to get to her apart ment. The assailant stabbed her again.\u2019 \u201d\u201cI\u2019m dying!\u201d she shrieked. \u201cI\u2019m dying!\u201d She shrieked. \u201cI\u2019m dying! \u201d\u201d \u2019A City Bus Passed Windows were opened again, and lights went on in many apartments. The assailant got into his car and drove away. Miss Genovese staggered to her feet. A city bus, Q\u201010, the Lef ferts Boulevard line to Ken nedy International Airport, passed. It was 3:35 A. M.\u2019 \u201dThe assailant returned. By then, Miss Genovese had crawled to the back of the building, where the freshly painted brown doors to the apartment house held out hope of safety. The killer tried the first door she wasn\u2019t there. At the second \u2010 door, 82\u201062 Austin Street, he saw her slumped on the floor at the foot of the stairs. He stabbed her a third time \u2014  fatally.\u201d \u2019It was 3:50 by the time the police received their first call, from a man who was a neighbor of Miss Genovese. In two min utes they were at the scene. The neighbor, a 70\u2010year\u2010old woman and another woman were the only persons on the street. No bady else came forward. The man explained that he had called the police after much celiberation. He had phoned a friend in Nassau County for advice and then he had crossed the roof of the building to the apartment of the elderly wo man to get her to make the call.\u2019 \u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t want to get in volved,\u201d he sheepishly told the police.\u201d \u2019Suspect Is Arrested Six days later, the police ar rested Winston Moseley, a 29 year\u2010old   op erator, and charged him with the homicide. Moseley had no previous record. He is married, has two children and owns a home at 133\u201019 Sutter Avenue, south ozone Park, Queens. On wednesday, a court committed him to Kings County Hospital for psychiatric observation. When questioned by the po lice, Moseley also said that he had slain Mrs. Annie May John son, 24, of 146\u201012 133d Avenue, Jamaica, on Feb. 29 and Bar bara Kralik, 15, of 174\u201017 140th Avenue, Springfield Gardens, last July. In the Kralik case, the police are holding Alvin L. Mitchel1, who is said to have confessed that slaying. The police stressed how sim\u2010 ple it would have been to have gotten in touch with them. \u201cA phone call,\u201d said one of the de tectives, \u201cwould have done it. \u201d The police may be reached by dialing . \u201cO\u201d for operator or SPring  .\u2019 \u201dThe question of whether the witnesses can be held legally responsible in any way for fail ure to report the crime was put to the Police Department\u2019s legai bureau. There, a spokesman said :\u201d \u2019\u201cThere is no legal responsibil\u2010ity with few exceptions, for any citizen to report a crime. \u201d Statutes Explained Under the statutes of the city, he said, a witness to a suspicibus or violent death must report it to the medical examiner. Under state law, a witness cannot withhold infor mation in a kidnapping.\u2019 \u201dToday witnesses from the neighborhood, which is made up   homes in the $35, 000 to $60, 000 range with the exception of the two apartment. houses near the railroad sta tion, find it difficult to explain why they didn\u2019t call the police.\u201d \u2019Lieut Bernard Jacobs, who handled the investigation by the, detectives, said: \u201cIt is one of the better neigh borhoods. There are few re ports of crimes. You only get\u2019 \u201dPath of Victim: Stabber\u2019s Third Attack Was Fatal\u201d \u2019The police said most persons had told them they had been afraid to call, but had given meaningless answers when asked what they had feared. \u201cWe can understand the reti cence of people to become in volved in an area of violence,\u201d Lieutenant Jacobs said, \u201cbut where they are in their homes, near phones, why should they be afraid to call the police?\u201d He said his men were able to piece together what happened  \u2014  and capture the suspect\u2010be cause the residents furnished all the information when detec tives rang doorbells during the days following the slaying.\u2019 \u201d\u201cBut why didn\u2019t someone call us that night ?\u201d he asked un believingly.\u201d \u2019Witnesses \u2014  some of them un able to believe what they had allowed to happen \u2014  told a re porter why.\u2019 \u201dA housewife, knowingly if quite casual, said, \u201cWe thought it was a lover\u2019s quarrel. \u201d A husband and wife both said, \u201cFrankly, we were afraid. \u201d They seemed aware of the fact that events might have been\u201d \u2019One couple, now willing to talk about that night, said they heard the first screams. The husband looked thoughtfully at the bookstore where the killer first grabbed Miss Genovese. \u201cWe went to the window to see what was happening,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the light from our bedroom made it difficult to see the street. \u201d The wife, still ap prehensive, added: \u201cI put out the light and we were able to see better. \u201d\u2019 \u201dAsked why they hadn\u2019t called the police, she shrugged and re plied: \u201cI don\u2019t know. \u201d\u201d \u201dA man peeked out from a slight opening in the doorway to his apartment and rattled off an account of the killer\u2019s second attack. Why hadn\u2019t he called the police at the time? \u201cI was tired,\u201d he said without emotion. \u201cI went back to bed. \u201d\u201d \u2019It was 4:25 A. M. when the ambulance arrived for the body of Miss Genovese. It drove off. \u201cThen,\u201d a solemn police detec tive said, \u201cthe people came out. \u201d This article can be viewed in its original form.
