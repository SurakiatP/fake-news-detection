I. director, James Comey, said the bureau would not recommend criminal charges over Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a personal email server while she was secretary of state. That lifted a legal cloud hanging over her campaign. But, in keeping with a long career of diving into thorny political conflicts, he rebuked Mrs. Clinton for being \u201cextremely careless\u201d and the State Department for lax security. He noted that hostile governments might have gained access to her personal account. Some of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s aides could still be punished, potentially costing them security clearances in a Clinton administration. _____ 2. President Obama made his first campaign appearance alongside Mrs. Clinton in North Carolina, just hours after Mr. Comey spoke. \u201cI can tell you this, Hillary Clinton has been tested,\u201d the president said. \u201cThere has never been any man or woman more qualified for this office. \u201d _____ 3. Britain\u2019s pound hit a   low against the dollar as concerns over the country\u2019s exit from the European Union mount. Theresa May, Britain\u2019s home secretary, has emerged as the   for prime minister, to replace David Cameron. One lawmaker has called her \u201ca bloody difficult woman. \u201d Even the art world is trying to grapple with the seismic shift, although one writer said the news itself was \u201cplaying out as a fascinating, twisting narrative. \u201d _____ 4. NASA\u2019s Juno spacecraft completed a   voyage and has begun 20 months of orbits around Jupiter to collect data and images. The planet, most likely the first formed after the sun, could hold the keys to understanding the origins of the solar system. \u201cNow the fun begins,\u201d the lead scientist on the project said. _____ 5. PBS fended off fireworks from viewers after admitting that its broadcast of the Independence Day Show from the National Mall in Washington tried to compensate for   visibility problems by intercutting footage of pyrotechnics from previous years. The channel tweeted that its choice was \u201cthe patriotic thing to do,\u201d but a Washington Post reporter tweeted back, \u201cthe Milli Vanilli of fireworks #shame. \u201d _____ 6. Accumulating evidence suggests that cancer is not as random as many people believe. Our health columnist, a doctor, reviewed cancer studies and concluded that attention to diet and exercise, and avoiding smoking, can significantly lower our vulnerability. One study showed that less than 30 percent of the lifetime risk of getting cancer was because of intrinsic risk factors, or \u201cbad luck. \u201d _____ 7. A French parliamentary panel found widespread intelligence failures connected to the terrorist attacks in Paris last year. Taking a page from the U. S. after the   attacks, the panel urged that the nation\u2019s intelligence agencies be merged. \u201cToday we don\u2019t measure up to those who are attacking us,\u201d a lawmaker said. _____ 8. This Palestinian doctor, pictured with his family, has become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre in Israel after helping save the lives of Jewish settlers in the West Bank. He happened upon an overturned car and helped treat the injured. A Palestinian medic had to warn him to flee to avoid being set upon by other settlers who might have mistaken him for the gunman who fired on the car. _____ 9. Venus Williams advanced at Wimbledon, reaching a Grand Slam semifinal for the first time since the 2010 United States Open. \u201cI don\u2019t have any regrets about anything that\u2019s taken place in between,\u201d she said, referring to troubles, including a diagnosis of an   disease and a back injury. \u201cIt\u2019s been a journey, but it\u2019s made me stronger. \u201d Her sister, Serena, is also in the semifinals. _____ 10. Finally, one of our   pieces today taps into the confusion over what we should be eating. Nutritionists and ordinary Americans tend to agree that soda and bacon aren\u2019t so good for you, and that kale and fresh fruit are. But the experts rate sushi and tofu high, while the public elevates granola bars and orange juice. Both sides have mixed feelings about popcorn, pork chops and whole milk. So bon app\u00e9tit and good luck. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern. And don\u2019t miss Your Morning Briefing, posted weekdays at 6 a. m.
