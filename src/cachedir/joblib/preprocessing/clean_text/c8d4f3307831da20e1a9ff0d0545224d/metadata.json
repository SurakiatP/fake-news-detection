But saving today for a distant tomorrow isn\u2019t so simple, and has a great deal to do with how people think about money. Sean Furlong, the director of finance and administration at Gilman School, a private secondary school in Baltimore, said he realized that while teaching a business class. He was teaching students, he said, \u201cbut then I realized I wasn\u2019t teaching my faculty and staff. \u201d \u201cThey didn\u2019t know the things I was teaching to high school students,\u201d he added. \u201cMany of them had missed that. \u201d Mr. Furlong said he decided to ask the school for permission to begin a retirement education program. Its goal was to increase participation in its retirement plan and to educate people on thinking about their savings choices and investment options. Nearly five years after Mr. Furlong pushed for that education campaign, the school has an average contribution rate of 22 percent, up from 16 percent. (This includes Gilman\u2019s 8 percent match after participants contribute the first 7 percent of their salary.) At the highest end, people are contributing 35 percent of their salary. Changing how people think about the money they save for retirement is one of the central tenets of a movement that is based on behavioral finance, the approach to economics that aims to understand how average people, not rational economists, make financial decisions. After all, it\u2019s the way people behave around money that tends to derail their plans, not a lack of knowledge about what they need to do if they want to retire comfortably. \u201cThe biggest challenge is not saving enough,\u201d said Liz Davidson, founder and chief executive of the consultancy Financial Finesse and author of \u201cWhat Your Financial Advisor Isn\u2019t Telling You. \u201d \u201cHistorically, there\u2019s been a lot of focus on returns. The return is on what you save, and most people aren\u2019t saving enough. \u201d Ms. Davidson, whose consultancy works with companies on their financial plans for employees, said that when it came to retirement, her company tried to get employees to think about how much they could set aside each day, and to forget about a larger monthly or annual number. \u201cMost people can save a few dollars a day or even $10 a day,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s doable. But if you say, \u2018Can you save $300 a month or a couple of thousand dollars a year?\u2019 people will say, \u2018Whoa.\u2019 \u201d Avoiding that \u201cwhoa,\u201d which is the hesitancy that can derail planning, is what consultants like Ms. Davidson are trying to do. Just as saving a bit more today is going to pay off in the future, not saving enough, failing to participate in a retirement plan or taking money out of a plan too early can significantly reduce the amount of money available decades later. Many of these efforts come back to seminal work by Shlomo Benartzi and Richard H. Thaler, behavioral economists who have researched how to get people to be better retirement savers. One of their conclusions is people need to be nudged by employers to stay on track, often in ways that keep them from missing the money they are saving. These strategies include automatically enrolling people in retirement plans, asking whether they would like to increase their contributions when they receive a raise and limiting the investment choices so they would need to opt out of a broadly diversified portfolio, which is likely to produce the best returns over time. As simple as the nudges seem, they have been proved to work. The National Football League\u2019s Players Association, which represents current and former players, moved to automatically enroll its players in 2007. Since then the participation rate has gone to 90 percent, from 82 percent. \u201cYou don\u2019t miss what you don\u2019t have,\u201d said Dana Hammonds, senior director of player affairs and development. At Gilman School, Mr. Furlong pushed to limit the number of investment options, cutting the funds its plan offered by 75 percent, while increasing the education about the ones that were available. \u201cIt used to be faculty and staff could be invested 100 percent in commodities funds and no one would care,\u201d Mr. Furlong said. \u201cNow the majority are in target date funds. \u201d (Target date funds are set up so that the allocation of a person\u2019s investment changes as the person gets older.) Increasing the amount people contribute has also been a challenge. The default rate used to be 3 percent, which wasn\u2019t enough, said Aimee R. DeCamillo, head of retirement plan services at T. Rowe Price, which provides plans for two million people at 3, 500 companies. She said a savings rate closer to 15 percent, including the employer match, was better. One way it gets people closer to that number is to use behavioral finance tricks with its online portal. This comes into play with increasing the contribution rate. \u201cIf you\u2019re at 10 percent, we\u2019ll show you 13, 15, and 17 percent, knowing you\u2019ll go for that middle number,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s driving behavior in the right direction. \u201d Another feature is what T. Rowe Price calls its \u201cconfidence number,\u201d which aims to predict the likelihood that you will be able to replicate your salary in retirement. \u201cIt drives you to an experience where you change assumptions,\u201d Ms. DeCamillo said. \u201cYou can change your retirement age. You can adjust your salary you can pull in additional outside assets. It helps you build confidence that you have this control over the outcome. \u201d Aetna, which has worked with Financial Finesse to develop its workplace program, began a yearlong initiative this month called Retirement Ready. Its goal is to help employees think about what they are saving but also about what that money might be used for in retirement. \u201cIt\u2019s about financial readiness but also the emotional and physical readiness for retirement,\u201d said Kay Mooney, vice president for benefits at Aetna. \u201cIt\u2019s critical for   employees who service our customers. We know the business is challenged if our employees are stressed financially. \u201d Ms. Mooney said the company would measure the program\u2019s effectiveness based on how employees changed behaviors, like increasing contributions to their 401( k) plans or reducing their credit card debt. But success might also start by getting people to rethink what their retirement savings are for. \u201cFinancial independence is a phrase we found resonated very well,\u201d Ms. Davidson said. \u201cIt\u2019s living life on your own terms. Flexibility is very important. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561808.2410662}
