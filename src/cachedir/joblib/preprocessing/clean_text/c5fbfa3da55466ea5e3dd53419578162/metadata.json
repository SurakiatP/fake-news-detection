He further said that his replacement doesn\u2019t deal with Medicaid expansion, and that issue should be addressed in a repeal vote, but that he\u2019s open to a separate vote on Medicaid expansion. Later on, Rand said, \u201cI think the White House, the administration, and the president understands that there\u2019s enough conservatives that they can\u2019t pass Obamacare lite. That\u2019s why, this week, what\u2019s going on behind the scenes is a charm offensive. Every conservative that\u2019s come out publicly opposed to this, has been called by the White House and is being cajoled and wooed by the White House to give in, but if conservatives stick together, if we stick together, we will have a force and a negotiation, and we will talk about clean repeal versus replacement, if we stick together, because they don\u2019t think they have the numbers to pass this at this point. \u201d Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742562994.9649134}
