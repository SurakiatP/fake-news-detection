Jules Schulback, a New York furrier and taker of home movies, heard that Marilyn Monroe would be on the Upper East Side of Manhattan filming scenes again for her new picture, \u201cThe Seven Year Itch. \u201d Two days earlier, Mr. Schulback had taken footage of her with his   Bolex movie camera around the corner from his townhouse apartment. So he grabbed the camera  \u2014   the one usually used for family picnics and parades and the stuff of everyday life  \u2014   and headed over to the subway grate in front of Wright\u2019s Food shop, just down the street from the   movie theater on Lexington Avenue and 52nd Street. Though it was around 1 a. m. a large crowd had already gathered, mostly newspaper photographers and curious men waiting to see Marilyn. The movie studio and the director, Billy Wilder, had counted on this, inviting the press and the public to drum up buzz for the new movie, which starred Ms. Monroe as \u201cthe Girl Upstairs,\u201d who entices a   executive, played by Tom Ewell, while his wife is away with the kids for the summer. In the famous street scene, the two are leaving the movies as Ms. Monroe pauses over a grate to enjoy the breeze from the subway as it blows up her dress on a hot summer night. \u201cIsn\u2019t it delicious?\u201d she purrs. The breeze came from a large fan under the grate operated by the film\u2019s special effects chief. The night  \u2014   Sept. 15  \u2014   was actually quite chilly. But the stunt worked. It became known as \u201cthe shot seen around the world. \u201d But there was a dark subtext to the comedy. Gathered at that late hour were hundreds of gawkers, almost all men, who catcalled and yelled things like, \u201cHigher! Higher!\u201d as Ms. Monroe\u2019s dress blew up over her head. For two hours, the men watched from surrounding buildings and from the street. \u201cUnfortunately, one of them was her husband, Joe DiMaggio,\u201d Mr. Wilder is quoted as saying in his biography, \u201cNobody\u2019s Perfect. \u201d \u201cAnd he didn\u2019t like what he saw, or what everyone else was seeing. \u201d Mr. DiMaggio hadn\u2019t planned on visiting the set that night, and was waiting for his wife at the St. Regis Hotel, where the couple were staying. But the columnist Walter Winchell had persuaded him to come along. Ms. Monroe was not happy her husband had shown up. But he was even more unhappy and angrily stormed off. Later that night the couple had a screaming fight in their room. The next morning, her hairdresser covered up Ms. Monroe\u2019s bruises with makeup. Three weeks later, Ms. Monroe filed for divorce. Mr. Wilder never used the Lexington Avenue footage and reshot the scene on a closed lot in Hollywood, though photographs of that night appeared everywhere. Except for some brief, grainy shots from a newsreel covering the divorce, footage from that night was never screened. \u201cThe footage immediately disappeared,\u201d Mr. Wilder said in the biography. \u201cBut one day I\u2019m sure some film scholar will dig it up. \u201d The story of the night Marilyn Monroe\u2019s white   dress blew up was well known among Jules Schulback\u2019s children, and even among his grandchildren. His granddaughter Bonnie Siegler said he bragged from time to time about his personal film shoot with Marilyn. \u201cHe was a real raconteur,\u201d said Ms. Siegler, a graphic designer who runs her own company, Eight and a Half. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if the story was real. \u201d But even though she had never seen it, she often told people that her grandfather had footage of Marilyn Monroe on the subway grate. Ms. Siegler\u2019s older sister, Rayna Dineen, said her grandfather, whom they called Opi (a German term of endearment) was rarely without his camera. \u201cHe would be filming everywhere, all the time. \u201d There were reels of vacations, family picnics, birthday parties and bar mitzvahs. He had even filmed a   day in the life of his daughters, depicting them waking up, brushing their teeth and going to school. \u201cBut the Marilyn story was one of his favorite stories to tell,\u201d Ms. Dineen said. It was just one of dozens of amazing tales. Mr. Schulback had a long, technicolorful life, one so filled with drama that his Monroe story sometimes seemed like a footnote. In 1938, Mr. Schulback had argued with his family in Germany that Adolf Hitler was much more dangerous than anyone thought. According to Ms. Siegler, his family believed that Hitler\u2019s hate speech was simply rhetoric, and that he wouldn\u2019t act on anything he was saying. Mr. Schulback, 25 at the time, urged them to pack their bags and leave Berlin with him. But they resisted, opting to wait and see how things developed, never imagining the horror that awaited them and millions of other European Jews. Mr. Schulback was not taking any chances. In 1938, Jews immigrating to the United States needed a sponsor, someone to take financial responsibility for them. Mr. Schulback sold everything he had, bought an expensive suit, booked passage on the Queen Mary, reserved a room at the Plaza and headed to America to find a sponsor for him and his wife, Edith, and their daughter Helen, who was then a toddler. \u201cHe was like: \u2018I\u2019m your lost, rich relative. I won\u2019t be a burden.\u2019 But he had no money. He played it,\u201d Ms. Siegler said. He secured a signature, then returned to collect his family, but was stopped trying to enter Nazi Germany by a suspicious border guard. Knowing the Germans were big fans of the 1934 Clark Gable hit, \u201cIt Happened One Night,\u201d Mr. Schulback told the guard he was the distributor for Mr. Gable\u2019s new movie. He claimed that if he couldn\u2019t enter the country, neither would the film. \u201cThe guy was like, \u2018Oh, we love Clark Gable,\u2019 and waved him through,\u201d Ms. Siegler said. Mr. Schulback grabbed Edith and Helen, again imploring his other relatives to leave, and escaped back to the United States with a few suitcases, claiming to the Nazi immigration officers that his family was going on vacation. The date was Nov. 8, the day before Kristallnacht. In Berlin, he had been a furrier, and his shop was destroyed that night. His remaining family  \u2014   four sisters, parents and    \u2014   would all perish in the Holocaust. The United States was good to Mr. Schulback. He and his family lived a happy, successful life in New York, much of it preserved in his home movies. As a child, Ms. Siegler loved going to her grandfather\u2019s Upper East Side apartment not just because of his great stories and sense of humor, but also because he lived opposite the New York Doll Hospital. From his apartment window, she could see the buckets of doll eyes and doll arms. \u201cIt was really intense,\u201d she said. When Edith had a stroke in the 1970s, she was given only a few weeks to live. But Mr. Schulback, always a man of action, refused to let his wife die in the hospital and took her home. The couple moved into the   apartment of a building around the corner, and Mr. Schulback became her nurse. \u201cHalf her body was paralyzed, she couldn\u2019t speak,\u201d Ms. Siegler said. \u201cBut he loved her and took care of her for 26 years until she finally died. \u201d After 35 years in that same apartment, Mr. Schulback  \u2014   who had been president of the 61st Street Block Association  \u2014   was forced to leave. The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation had bought the townhouse where he lived and the one behind it and wanted to reconfigure the property. So Ms. Siegler and her husband, Jeff Scher, helped move her    grandfather to a new place on the other side of Central Park. In 2004, in the arduous packing up of Mr. Schulback\u2019s home, the couple came across a big stash of film. It was stored in a back room that the family called \u201cOpi\u2019s fur room,\u201d where Mr. Schulback had once assembled garments from animal pelts for his business. \u201cNo one ever wanted to go back there,\u201d Ms. Siegler said. \u201cBut when we went in, we found this plastic bag filled with just tons of film, home movies, bought movies and everything mixed together. \u201d Ms. Siegler\u2019s husband, an experimental filmmaker, couldn\u2019t wait to screen the films. He was particularly interested in seeing whether Marilyn and the subway grate footage actually existed. \u201cIt was like this family myth,\u201d Mr. Scher said. \u201cSo long rumored and never confirmed. \u201d The same was true for its source material. For decades, innuendo swirled around the Lexington Avenue shoot for \u201cThe Seven Year Itch. \u201d Ms. Monroe and Mr. DiMaggio had married that January and had already had a bumpy ride, the Yankee Clipper enraged by her exhibitionism and by rumors of infidelity, according to Lois W. Banner, the author of the 2012 biography \u201cMarilyn: The Passion and the Paradox. \u201d \u201cShe was having an affair with her musical director at the time, and everyone knew about it in the business,\u201d said Dr. Banner, a professor emeritus of history and gender studies at the University of Southern California. So before he even arrived on set, there was tension. \u201cDiMaggio,\u201d Dr. Banner said, \u201cwas not happy with Marilyn. \u201d There are several theories as to why the footage from that night was never used. Some believe the Manhattan shoot was done purely as a publicity stunt, which was made even more sensational when Mr. DiMaggio showed up. Some biographers say the enthusiastic crowd was just too noisy, making the film unusable. A third theory was that the footage was too risqu\u00e9 and Ms. Monroe wanted to shoot a more demure version, so as not to further infuriate her husband. There was even talk at the time that she wasn\u2019t wearing any underwear. Mr. Wilder tried to put those rumors to rest in his biography. She had put on not just one, but two sets of underwear, he said. Dr. Banner said all three reasons quite likely played into the final decision to reshoot. \u201cBut the photographs of that night had gone viral by the time the film was being put together,\u201d she said, \u201cand played a great role in her fame. \u201d The   scene used in the finished film is incredibly brief and tame. The image many people have of that moment comes from the press shots and publicity stills in New York, and not from the finished movie. Back in the pelt room of Mr. Schulback\u2019s apartment, Mr. Scher excitedly gathered up the old metal film canisters. None were labeled, Mr. Scher recalled. Some of the film was off the reel and sitting there like big balls of spaghetti, as if there had been a projector mishap years ago. Later that night in his studio in the couple\u2019s apartment on West 16th Street, Mr. Scher slowly and carefully wound the film, since some of it was very brittle and in danger of breaking. He did a few repairs and then began looking at it using a light box, spooling it from reel to reel by hand. There were about 50 rolls of   film and around 75 rolls of 8 millimeter. There were the family outings and parades. The birthdays and bar mitzvahs. And there, amid the mundane scenes of precious everyday life, was Marilyn Monroe, in crisp, colorful Kodachrome. \u201cThis stuff just popped out,\u201d Mr. Scher said. \u201cIt was real! Preserved like the home movies are, too. Just these moments in time. \u201d Mr. Scher could clearly see the actress\u2019s dress billowing up. \u201cLike a parachute with a pair of legs attached,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was startling. Like seeing a myth materialize. \u201d It was a shadow version of lost footage amid home movies of a family that almost certainly wouldn\u2019t have existed had the Schulbacks stayed in Germany. Mr. Scher called out to his wife: \u201cIt\u2019s really here!\u201d They watched all 3 minutes 17 seconds in amazement. \u201cThere was something so magical about it,\u201d Ms. Siegler said. \u201cFor years I didn\u2019t know if it was real. I certainly didn\u2019t believe it wholeheartedly. And there it was. It was like the end of the story. \u201d The film starts with a   intertitle that reads \u201cWorld Premiere,\u201d Mr. Schulback\u2019s little inside joke. And then there is Marilyn Monroe, in a white terry robe, coming down the stoop of a   building at 164 East 61st Street, between Lexington and Third Avenues. It was the earlier scene  \u2014   before the subway grate footage  \u2014   that Mr. Schulback had shot. Cameramen and press photographers are gathered outside as the actress smiles and waves. Cut to Ms. Monroe in a   window wearing a slip and   her hair. Mr. Ewell walks down the street and into the building. The film cuts inexplicably to 30 seconds of what must be a Shriners parade in Manhattan, then jumps to another intertitle, which reads \u201cOur Baby. \u201d And suddenly, there is Ms. Monroe again, this time on the subway grate in that famously fluttering white dress, holding a matching white clutch in her right hand and a     scarf in her left. Mr. Schulback was incredibly close, filming right behind Mr. Wilder\u2019s shoulder, stopping to wind his   camera every 25 seconds. Now and then, a silhouette of the director\u2019s arm intrudes into Mr. Schulback\u2019s   shot. At one point Mr. Wilder, in a fedora, passes across the frame. Ms. Monroe gets into position and yawns, while the cinematographer sets up the camera. Through a gap in the film crew, Mr. Schulback captures just her face, looking off to the left, serious and unsmiling. Then Mr. Ewell is there, chatting with Ms. Monroe, who pushes him into position. The dress flutters again, Ms. Monroe holds it down, bending slightly, smiling and talking to Mr. Ewell, but it flutters up some more and she laughs, her head thrown back. It blows up again, but she doesn\u2019t push it down this time, and it flies up over her head, clearly revealing two pairs of underwear that, because of the bright lights, do not protect Ms. Monroe\u2019s modesty quite as much as she might have liked. Then, as suddenly as she appeared, Marilyn is gone, and the film reverts to   mode: Edith Schulback walking on the grass at a family outing in the country. It\u2019s like being shaken from some crazy dream, back to reality. Interest in that moment in film history from more than 50 years ago endures. The new movie musical starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, \u201cLa La Land,\u201d makes brief filmic reference to it in the opening number, with a young dancer\u2019s yellow dress blowing up. And a Snickers commercial from the Super Bowl last year stars Willem Dafoe, Eugene Levy and a   Monroe on the famous set. \u201cIt\u2019s that iconic image,\u201d said Dr. Banner, the Monroe biographer. \u201cPeople are still fascinated by the context in which it all happened. \u201d After screening the film with her husband, Ms. Siegler immediately told her grandfather that she had found the footage. \u201cI was so excited about it  \u2014   more for the reason that his story was true. \u201d She shrugged. \u201cBut he never had any doubts. \u201d Mr. Schulback moved in 2005 and died six months later. Ms. Siegler and Mr. Scher made a print and screened it for about 100 people in 2004 at the upstate home of their friends Kurt Andersen and his wife, Anne Kreamer. The two couples had started a small film festival for neighbors and friends, hanging a sheet on the side of a barn and serving popcorn, ice pops and beer. The people in the audience that summer night had no idea what they were in for. \u201cThat scene is one of the most iconic scenes in American cinema,\u201d said Mr. Andersen, an author, radio host and a founder of Spy magazine. \u201cSo to have film of it actually being shot, it\u2019s like watching the Zapruder film. It\u2019s just extraordinary. \u201d The crowd that evening sat in silence as Marilyn Monroe\u2019s dress blew up on the side of the barn. \u201cPeople were \u201d Mr. Andersen said. \u201cThey were like, \u2018What did I just see? \u2019\u201d That was the only time anyone outside the family had seen the film. Until now.'"}, "time": 1742562834.712093}
