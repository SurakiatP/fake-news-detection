How could I be so sure, because he would not actively campaign and endorse anyone, in a meaningful way during the Republican Primary. He filed paperwork to run for President on January 30, 2016. And he is a Clintonista, a globalist, a traitor to the American people. He doesn\u2019t carry the criminal baggage of Clinton, but he supports all free trade agreements, the elimination of all national borders, the weakening of our military. etc., etc.\\nPaul Ryan represents the globalists and their Plan B since Hillary Clinton is going to be indicted AFTER the election.\\nPlease watch the following video and you will see the inescapable conclusion that Hillary Clinton is no longer useful to the globalists and Ryan\u2019s lack of a criminal record , whose election will not spark rioting in the streets from 50% of Americans who do not know any better, and who will do what he is told by the Rothschild/Rockefeller cartel.\\nAll the documentation you need is on The Common Sense Show. \\nPlease make this go viral. Awareness of this insidious plot designed to fool the American people can blow this plan up. Every American needs to see this evidence so that even the casual Clinton supporters will not cast their vote for her knowing she will never make it to Inauguration Day.\\n \\n\\n \\n \\nP lease Donate to The Common Sense Show \\n \\nPLEASE SUBSCRIBE TO OUR YOUTUBE CHANNEL AND DON\u2019T FORGET TO \u201cLIKE\u201d US \\n\\n \\n\\nThis is the absolute best in food storage.
