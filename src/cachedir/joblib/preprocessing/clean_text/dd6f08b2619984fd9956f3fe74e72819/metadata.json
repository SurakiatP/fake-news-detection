[\u201cTo keep Americans safe, we have made tough choices that have been put off for too long,\u201d Trump wrote in a message to Congress. \u201cBut we have also made necessary investments that are long overdue. \u201d  The outline increases defense spending by $54 billion and increases funding for immigration enforcement as well as $4. 1 billion investment for his promised wall on the southern border. \u201cWe must ensure that our courageous servicemen and women have the tools they need to deter war, and when called upon to fight, do only one thing: Win. \u201d Trump wrote. The budget includes Trump\u2019s promises to veterans, as the Department of Veterans Affairs gets a 10 percent increase in spending. Trump cut funding for several agencies, including a 28 percent cut in the State Department, mostly because of cuts in foreign aid programs. The EPA also experiences a 31 percent cut, the biggest loser in the budget. The Department of Agriculture gets a 29 percent cut and the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Labor are also cut by over 20 percent. Although there are over 13 percent cuts in the Department of Education, Trump\u2019s budget proposes $168 million for charter school programs and $250 million for a   choice program, according to the Washington Post. The Budget calls for the elimination of funds for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting as well as the endowments for the Arts and the Humanities. \u201cWe are going to do more with less, and make the Government lean and accountable to the people,\u201d read Trump\u2019s message to Congress. The budget outlines Trump\u2019s spending priorities, but a more detailed document is expected to be released by the White House in May.'"}, "time": 1742562423.0932357}
