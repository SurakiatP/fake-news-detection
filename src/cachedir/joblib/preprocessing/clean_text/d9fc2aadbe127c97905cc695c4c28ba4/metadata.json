Mick Mulvaney ( ) now Director of the Office of Management and Budget, turned nasty in its final days, with the campaigns of rivals Chad Connelly and Tom Mullikin accusing each other of disingenuous campaigning. [Accusations are flying between the two camps, with Connelly\u2019s campaign calling Mullikin a \u201c  Democratic lobbyist\u201d and Mullikin\u2019s supporters painting Connelly as a closet #NeverTrump GOP establishment insider.  If you want a career politician, I\u2019m not your guy. But if you\u2019re sick of business as usual, I\u2019m an outsider who will fight for #SC5 values! pic. twitter.   \u2014   Chad Connelly (@ChadConnelly) March 28, 2017,  Connelly\u2019s website is loaded with   populist policy snippets like, \u201cIt\u2019s simple: stop the bleeding before tackling the problem of those already here illegally  \u2014   start by building the wall\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s such a breath of fresh air to have a President willing to take the side of prosperity, and I look forward to working with him. \u201d Connelly\u2019s credentials as an outsider, however, have been called into question over the last week. The Washington Times reported Thursday that Connelly was employed by the RNC as \u201cdirector of faith management,\u201d even as he launched his congressional bid. His 2016 RNC salary was reported as $120, 000, and he continued to receive payments from the RNC until over a month after he began to raise money for his campaign. From   Connelly served as Chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party. No evidence of impropriety has surfaced, but the overlap of Connelly\u2019s employment and campaign fundraising, along with his connections to the state and national Republican apparatus, has raised eyebrows. \u201cThe bigger thing here is the appearance. It may be that it doesn\u2019t look very good,\u201d Michael Kang, an Emory University law professor, told the Washington Times. Beyond his strong connection with the RNC, often seen as the epitome of the \u201cRepublican Establishment,\u201d supporters of Mullikin, are appalled at his presentation as a Trumpist. Karen Giorno, former Trump Southeast Regional Political Director and Senior Advisor to the Trump for President Campaign, spoke at a Mullikin event to express her misgivings, calling him a \u201cposter child for the establishment:\u201d In his TV ads, Chad is described as an outsider and an unwavering supporter of Donald Trump. Those claims are patently untrue. I personally observed Chad, in multiple states, leading efforts to defeat Trump Delegates at Republican conventions, despite you, the voters, pledging those delegates to Donald Trump. Chad worked tirelessly on behalf of his employer, the Republican National Committee, to deny Donald Trump the Convention victory he earned that you, the American people, demanded. In a press release issued after the event, Giorno added, \u201cI know he worked against us behind the scenes. All this happened while he was taking $120, 000 a year of the Republican National Committee\u2019s money. \u201d Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the South Carolina Primary was pivotal in propelling him to the nomination. The \u201cTrump Strike Team\u201d organized out of Republicans from California and other states in the final days of that campaign tipped the balance in candidate Trump\u2019s favor, much to the chagrin of leftist journalists. Members of the Strike Team joined Giorno at the Mullikin event to attest that Connelly had worked to stop Trump both before and after his victory in the South Carolina contest. Girono told Breitbart News that Connelly pushed his own slate of #NeverTrump delegates with the intention of nullifying Trump\u2019s primary victory. Politico reported on these machinations in the aftermath of the primary, while Trump\u2019s nomination was anything but assured. According to Giorno, Connelly also did not attend a \u201cUnity Breakfast\u201d designed to bring   primary voters into the fold before the general election and, at the South Carolina Republican Convention, he refused to sign a Trump banner with the other attendees. Mullikin\u2019s campaign provided Breitbart News with photographs of the banner, which lacked Connelly\u2019s signature. Connelly\u2019s campaign denied Giorno and the Mullikin campaign\u2019s accusations in the strongest terms, calling them \u201ccomplete fabrications\u201d and \u201clast second desperation\u201d from Mullikin\u2019s camp. \u201cThey ought to be ashamed of themselves,\u201d Connelly staffer Luke Byars told Breitbart news. \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting that Tom Mullikin is sanctioning this and it shows you how desperate he is. \u201d The Connelly campaign points to his efforts during the general election as proof of his commitment to the President. \u201cLast year, Chad Connelly spent 140 nights away from home working to get evangelical support for Donald Trump,\u201d Byars told Breitbart news. As for the Primary season, Byars noted that, as an   he was prohibited from supporting any candidate. \u201cHe was not allowed to be involved in the primary process at all,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat proof do they have, other than [Giorno] who is making stuff up?\u201d Byars asked. He called Connelly\u2019s principle accuser \u201ca disgruntled Trump campaign staffer who was fired,\u201d referring to Giorno\u2019s reassignment amid controversy from Trump\u2019s field operations in Florida to an advisor\u2019s position in New York City. Robert Cahaly, a strategist working with the Mullikin campaign, found that characterization \u201cridiculous. \u201d \u201cShe went from being in the field to being at Trump Tower, and that means she was fired? That\u2019s the kind of spin only an RNC professional could come up with,\u201d he told Breitbart News. Mullikin\u2019s campaign pointed to Connelly\u2019s retinue of supporters as indicating his #NeverTrump history. For example, prominent #NeverTrump voice Erick Erickson, formally of RedState and now the principal of   conservative site The Resurgent, glowingly endorsed Connelly last month. Cahaly called the continued posting of the endorsement on Connelly\u2019s website a \u201cloud and clear message to  . \u201d Connelly has, however, also been endorsed by a wide swath of the Republican   including Freedom Caucus chairman Rep. Mark Meadows ( ) and early   former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee. Tom Zawatowski, leader of an Ohio tea party group, endorsed Connelly in a Facebook post in which he recalls Connelly playing a pivotal role in getting Ohio\u2019s evangelical community on Trump\u2019s side, even as #NeverTrump Governor John Kasich refused to support Trump in the general election. Connelly\u2019s campaign let fly its own accusations against Tom Mullikin, who has gone to great lengths to position himself on social media as \u201cthe   candidate. \u201d As a loyal #TeamTrump soldier I\u2019m always proud to answer the call. Go vote May 2nd #SC05 #scpol #MAGA\u27a1https:  .  pic. twitter.   \u2014   Tom Mullikin (@TomMullikinSC) April 28, 2017,  Byars found this \u201cridiculous,\u201d calling Mullikin a \u201c  Democrat who has given to Democrats all over the country. \u201d \u201cTom Mullikin says he was a BIG Trump supporter, so why did he choose not to even cast a vote in the SC Presidential primary in 2016?\u201d Byars asked, citing GOP voter data. He tried to contrast the two candidates\u2019 roles in the 2016 campaign: I think it is offensive that a career lobbyist like Tom Mullikin who has aided liberal Democrats would criticize Chad Connelly now. Chad gave up 2 years traveling the country to recruit evangelical support for Donald Trump. Mullikin has made contributions to many political campaigns, including those of Democratic Senator Debbie Stabenow ( ) and former Sen. Kay Hagan ( ). In the 1980s, he worked with then Sen. Al Gore ( ) on his unsuccessful presidential run. He has also donated to many Republican campaigns and himself ran as a Republican candidate for state representative in the 1990s. Mullikin contributed to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the DNC as recently as 2014. His record of GOP contributions might similarly alarm some populist voters, with recurring contributions to Sen. Lindsay ( ) a #NeverTrump stalwart, and Sen. John McCain ( ) who clashed with Trump on the campaign trail. Mullikin made his only contribution of the 2016 presidential campaign to early dropout Rick Santorum. Mullikin\u2019s camp found these lines of attack unwarranted. \u201cHe\u2019s never denied he made contributions to Democrats   \u2026     he made a lot more to Republicans, including Mick Mulvany,\u201d Cahaly told Breitbart News. \u201cJust like the president, he was in business and he was trying to get things done in the state, and he\u2019s not going to apologize for it. \u201d Cahaly also took issue with the characterization of his candidate as a lobbyist, especially a \u201cdemocratic\u201d one, noting Mullikin \u201chasn\u2019t been registered to lobby in years and years. \u201d The Mullikin website characterizes his lobbying work on environmental issues as \u201cHis outspoken support for American manufacturing, farming and energy production placed him on the front lines of combating the radical left\u2019s attempt to use environmental hysteria as an excuse to institute global socialism. \u201d As the campaigns continue to spar over these accusations, voters will go to the polls in South Carolina\u2019s Fifth District Tuesday. If neither Connelly, Mullikin, nor any of the other three candidates in the GOP primary wins 50% of the vote, a runoff will be held May 16. Considered a safely Republican district, Democrats are rumored to continue their    efforts to derail the Trump administration\u2019s momentum by vigorously contesting special elections.'"}, "time": 1742628439.5072381}
