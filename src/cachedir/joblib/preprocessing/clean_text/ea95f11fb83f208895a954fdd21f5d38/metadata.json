Trump, the Republican nominee for president, has closed the gap with his Democratic opponent Hillary Rodham Clinton with just a couple weeks left in the election, the latest national Breitbart News Network/Gravis Marketing poll shows. \\nClinton, at 46 percent, leads Trump at 45 percent by just one point\u2014inside the survey\u2019s 2.3 percent margin of error. Libertarian Gary Johnson gets just 3 percent and the Green Party\u2019s Dr. Jill Stein just 1 percent, while 4 percent are unsure. The survey was conducted from Oct. 25 to Oct. 26, sampling 1,824 registered voters across the United States. The poll was conducted using a combination of interactive voice response polling and an internet panel of cell phone users. \\n\u201cSomething has happened since the third debate,\u201d Doug Kaplan, the managing partner of Gravis Marketing, said of the poll. \u201cConventional wisdom was after Trump said he wouldn\u2019t promise to accept the results of the election and made the \u2018nasty woman\u2019 comment, many thought Hillary would gain\u2014but Trump seems to be closing the gap. In every election in the last 30 years, this happens where the person behind closes the gap. Hillary still has a clear electoral advantage and many paths to victory. However, Trump is not out of it but Hillary is still the favorite.\u201d \\n\u201cThis is a big story because it shows Trump really closing, importantly, as the other close polls are showing,\u201d Democratic pollster Pat Caddell, who worked for President Jimmy Carter and is working with Breitbart News and Gravis Marketing on these polls, added. \u201cHe is closing with his favorability and unfavorability as well. \\nCaddell said he thinks Obamacare\u2019s failures, where premiums are skyrocketing, is one of many reasons why Trump is surging. \u201cAmong other things, that is contributing [to Trump\u2019s rise in the polls],\u201d Caddell said. \u201cWhen we are looking down the road at other things that may be influential, we are seeing the possibility of again on the immigration issue\u2014that thing about concern on the border seems to be increasing as is opposition to Hillary and their plans to expand immigration and refugees, which is another big issue. But more importantly, at the end of the survey, we see both candidates have problems on their ability to unite the country and on whether or not they can have the moral leadership to lead. They\u2019re basically about the same, which I consider a real improvement for Trump now that he\u2019s that close.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742563221.0381904}
