He will save our America, and he will certainly make it great again,\u201d he said . \\nDaily Mail reports: \\nVoight has repeatedly supported Trump throughout the election cycle despite the business tycoon\u2019s unprovoked attacks on his daughter Angelina Jolie\u2019s looks. \\nIn the video, posted on Voight\u2019s social media channels, he said: \u2018We were once a country of freedom. Now we\u2019re becoming a country of tyranny. \\n\u2018Thousands of refugees will flood our nation, and no one will know the good guys from the bad guys. It will kill our economy which is at an all time low under the years of Obama\u2019s presidency.\u2019 \\nMillions of jobs have been created, unemployment has plummeted, and the economy has grown about two per cent each year under Obama\u2019s administration, with experts grading it a \u2018solid B or B+\u2019, CNN reported. \\nBut Voight also warned that people would lose their Second Amendment rights under Hillary Clinton, even though she has repeatedly disputed similar statements. \\nVoight went on to say: \u2018Freedom of religion will be attacked\u2026and Hillary will try to stop all conservative voices on TV and radio. \\n\u2018Our highest courts will become socialist, and she will restrict what America was founded on \u2013 our freedom to become a small business owner and pursue our own personal dreams.\u2019 \\nVoight also accused Soros of \u2018turn[ing] hundreds of Jewish people over to the Nazis to be exterminated during World War II,\u2019 an idea perpetuated by conservative commentator Glenn Beck. \\nWhen Soros was 14, his father bribed an agriculture official in Nazi-occupied Hungary to pose as his Christian godfather. \\nSoros once accompanied the man during an inventory of an estate left behind by the wealthy Jewish aristocrat Mor Kornfeld. \\nIn a 1998 episode of 60 Minutes, Soros said: \u2018I had no role in taking away that property. So I had no sense of guilt.\u2019 \\nWhile Voight made no reference to Trump\u2019s comments about women in his latest video, he came out to defend the business tycoon days earlier. \\n\u2018I am so ashamed of my fellow actor Bobby DeNiro\u2019s rant against Donald Trump\u2026\u2019 I am so ashamed of my fellow actor Bobby DeNiro's rant against Donald Trump. What foul words he used against a presidential nominee. cont'd \\n\u2014 Jon Voight (@jonvoight) October 8, 2016 \\n\u2018Donald Trump\u2019s words were not as damaging as Robert DeNiro\u2019s ugly rant. Trump\u2019s words did not hurt anyone.\u2019 Voight tweeted in response to the Republican candidate\u2019s comments that he could sexually harass women without consequence. Donald Trump's words were not as damaging as Robert DeNiro's ugly rant. Trump's words did not hurt anyone. Can you imagine. cont'd \\n\u2014 Jon Voight (@jonvoight) October 8, 2016 \\n\u2018I don\u2019t know of too many men who haven\u2019t expressed some sort of similar sexual terms toward women, especially in their younger years,\u2019 Voight added. \\nTrump has since been accused of sexual harassment by six women in the days following the 2005 hot mic recording\u2019s emergence. \\nThe presidential candidate has spoken out against Voight\u2019s daughter over the last decade, saying in 2006: \u2018[Angelina Jolie has] been with so many guys she makes me look like a baby, OK, with the other side. And, I just don\u2019t even find her attractive.\u2019 \\nIn 2007, Trump said: \u2018Angelina Jolie is sort of amazing because everyone thinks she\u2019s like this great beauty. \\n\u2018I really understand beauty. And I will tell you, she\u2019s not\u2014I do own Miss Universe. I do own Miss USA. I mean, I own a lot of different things. I do understand beauty, and she\u2019s not.\u2019\""}, "time": 1742562860.8555095}
