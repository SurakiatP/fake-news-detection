[The comedian\u2019s new Netflix specials, The Age of Spin: Live at the Hollywood Palladium and Deep in the Heart of Texas: Live at Austin City Limits, include jokes about homosexuality that have some social media users outraged.  One punchline that apparently rubbed fans the wrong way, according to at least one report, involved prison inmates performing oral sex: \u201cL. G. B. T. Q?! I was like what the f*ck is the Q? Does that even make sense, Q? Turns out Q is like the vowels, that sh*t is sometimes \u2018Y\u2019. It\u2019s for gay dudes that don\u2019t really know they\u2019re gay. you know what I mean. like prison f*gs who are like: \u201cWhat I\u2019m not gay n***a I\u2019m just sucking these d*cks to pass the time. \u201d The former Comedy Central star also cracked jokes about Caitlyn Jenner and transgender people. \u201cWhenever I see one of them Ts on the street I\u2019m like \u2018I don\u2019t mind them but man I miss Bruce,\u2019\u201d he said to laughter from the audience. \u201cI knew before you guys knew,\u201d he says of Jenner\u2019s sexuality. \u201cI heard things on the street in Hollywood, you know you used to be out, see people: \u2018Hey what\u2019s up Kanye, why the long face?\u2019 \u2018N*gaa you\u2019ll see, I\u2019ve got two mother in laws now. \u2019\u201d Outrage on social media over Chappelle\u2019s jokes came swiftly: Dave Chappelle is a funny dude, but that homophobic and transphobic nonsense just derailed the whole thing for me. Major bummer.  \u2014   KeenAnvil (@keenanvil) March 22, 2017,  Lots of weird, disappointing   in the Dave Chappelle Netflix tbqh,  \u2014   Soma\ud83c\udf39 (@darkroomdoor) March 22, 2017,  But Chappelle\u2019s material was homophobic and transphobic and involved rape culture. I\u2019ve grown too much not to speak up about it now.  \u2014   April (@ReignOfApril) March 22, 2017,  You can find Dave Chappelle funny and still say his homophobic behavior isn\u2019t okay (as someone who has paid to see him, I would know)  \u2014   \u00af_( \u30c4) \u00af (@morganslegit) March 22, 2017,  Chappelle, for his part, had warned audiences during his special, saying \u201cLadies and gentleman, man the f*ck up or you\u2019re not going to make it through this show. \u201d And some Twitter users downplayed the idea that the comedian\u2019s set was offensive. Good lord people saying Dave Chappelle was trans or homophobic are fucking reaching. Does everyone just desperately need someone to hate on?  \u2014   Angry CanadianGinger (@Weatherbee79) March 22, 2017,  Dave Chappelle\u2019s comedy is refreshing.. I miss people saying whatever they want.  \u2014   Sean The Triggerer (@SeanTheTerrible) March 22, 2017,  The Chappelle complaints kinda make me glad the greats like Pryor and Carlin never did a standup in the social media era.  \u2014   Suge Night Shyamalan (@B_Effin_G) March 22, 2017,  Chappelle\u2019s new comedy specials debuted on Netflix March 21, and a third special is slated for release on the streaming platform later this year.
