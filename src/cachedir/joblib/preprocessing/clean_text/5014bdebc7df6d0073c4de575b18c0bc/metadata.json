Both are megaselling queens of pop whose every move reverberates throughout the culture. The fact that they will face off in each of the top three categories  \u2014   album, record and song of the year  \u2014   gives the Grammys a rare tension that can only be good for ratings. Yet their competition is also fraught in ways that have long dogged the awards. One concerns race, a subject the Grammys have a tangled history with  \u2014   especially this year, when one of the most acclaimed young black artists, Frank Ocean, has boycotted the process altogether. Another sensitive area is the Grammys\u2019 spotty record in recognizing the vanguards of contemporary pop. Added to the mix is a heightened political climate in which issues of race and identity are front and center, raising the question of whether the music industry will use this year\u2019s Grammys as a soapbox. Many longtime Grammy watchers say that a sweep by Adele  \u2014   and therefore a Beyonc\u00e9 snub  \u2014   could feed into   complaints that the awards too often fail to recognize black performers in the most prestigious categories. Ebro Darden, a disc jockey on the New York   station Hot 97 and on Apple\u2019s Beats 1, said that a big Beyonc\u00e9 win would be \u201cthe best move\u201d for the Grammys \u201cif they want to get the most attention and keep people interested. \u201d Should Adele dominate, he added, some music fans \u201cwould come for them and say #OscarsSoWhite. \u201d With the news media closely focused on diversity at awards shows  \u2014   and the public relations nightmares that result from an absence of it  \u2014   that would be an unwelcome response for the Recording Academy, the organization behind the Grammys. (A representative for the academy declined to comment.) Adele and Beyonc\u00e9 are both hailed in music circles as supremely deserving talents. But for voters, the singers also represent a choice between two strains of modern pop: Adele\u2019s album \u201c25\u201d and her hit ballad \u201cHello\u201d are examples of the finely   traditional style that is Grammy catnip. Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cLemonade,\u201d with its dynamic single \u201cFormation\u201d and accompanying politically and racially charged hourlong art film, represents an edgier    sound that rarely takes the top prize  \u2014   Exhibit A for those who contend that the Grammys are perennially out of touch. Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s own example is telling: She may already have 20 Grammys on her shelf, but only one is in the   big four categories (album, record and song of the year, or best new artist). She has also been passed over twice for album of the year, losing to Taylor Swift in 2010 and Beck in 2015 (much to the consternation of Kanye West, a frequent Grammy critic). \u201cThe #OscarsSoWhite controversy really shook the motion picture academy, and I think the Grammys are saying, \u2018There but for the grace of God go we, so let\u2019s make sure this doesn\u2019t happen to us,\u2019\u201d said Paul Grein, a former Billboard columnist who performs detailed Grammy analysis for the industry magazine Hits. The Grammys may be more diverse than most shows this year, Beyonc\u00e9 is the top nominee, with nine nods, while the newcomer Chance the Rapper has seven. But the show\u2019s record in recognizing black talent has come under plenty of fire. Mr. Ocean declined to submit his work for consideration in this year\u2019s Grammys at all, saying that the institution \u201cjust doesn\u2019t seem to be representing very well for people who come from where I come from,\u201d and calling the boycott his \u201cColin Kaepernick moment. \u201d Rap fans were outraged when Kendrick Lamar lost best rap album to the white rapper Macklemore in 2014, though Mr. Lamar took all four rap trophies last year. (Eminem has won best rap album six times.) The last black artists to win album of the year were legacy picks: Ray Charles in 2005, and Herbie Hancock, covering Joni Mitchell, in 2008 a black woman hasn\u2019t won since Lauryn Hill did nearly two decades ago. Russell Simmons, the entertainment mogul who is a founder of Def Jam Recordings, said that Beyonc\u00e9 \u201cis overdue for being accepted by the mainstream in the way she deserves. \u201d \u201cShe\u2019s obviously the most mainstream thing on the planet,\u201d Mr. Simmons said. He added: \u201cWhen they define her, her color has something to do with the way she\u2019s viewed and the amount of awards she wins and the accolades she gets. I would venture to say were she white and blond from Texas, she would be recognized differently. \u201d Some, however, reject the idea of the   contest as a referendum on race. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a black and white thing it\u2019s a quality thing,\u201d said Joel Peresman, the chief executive of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation. Kevin Liles, a veteran record executive now with 300 Entertainment, said that the Grammys had evolved in recent years: \u201cIf it was truly a dormant or stagnant association, then Beyonc\u00e9 wouldn\u2019t be there. All shapes, sizes, colors and genres are represented. \u201d The odds on Adele and Beyonc\u00e9 are hard to read, even among industry insiders. Adele may be a safe choice, but she also swept all three top prizes five years ago, making a repeat seem unlikely. No   or contemporary RB album has won the top prize since Outkast\u2019s \u201c  Love Below\u201d in 2004, a tough precedent for Beyonc\u00e9 on the other hand, there is a wide sense in the industry that it may simply be her turn. At the Grammys, however, anything is possible: Contenders for an upset album of the year winner are streaming hits like Drake\u2019s \u201cViews\u201d and Justin Bieber\u2019s \u201cPurpose,\u201d and this year\u2019s darkest horse, \u201cA Sailor\u2019s Guide to Earth\u201d by the country outsider Sturgill Simpson. The awards   also comes at a cultural crossroads, following a divisive presidential election. Now, even the most mainstream events are weighted with ideological expectations. \u201cThe gloves are off: It is absolutely in style to have a political opinion right now,\u201d the D. J. Mr. Darden said, predicting that the Grammys would \u201cabsolutely have that moment\u201d where current events come up, such as with Meryl Streep\u2019s Golden Globes speech aimed at President Trump. Lady Gaga, a vocal Hillary Clinton supporter, did not make a grand political statement, as some had hoped, at the Super Bowl, but she will have another platform when she performs with Metallica at the Grammys. Among the other performers scheduled on Sunday are Katy Perry, who was a dedicated surrogate for Mrs. Clinton, and Chance the Rapper, a frequent guest of President Obama\u2019s White House. Beyonc\u00e9 and Adele, who is British, both expressed support for Mrs. Clinton last year. \u201cWe want to be a place where artists can feel they can come and express themselves,\u201d Ken Ehrlich, the Grammys producer, said of the possibility that performances or speeches could become political. \u201cOur guidelines are taste and the F. C. C. The F. C. C. is more concerned with profanity than it is with political discourse. \u201d Mr. Simmons said that no matter who comes away the night\u2019s big winner, a foray by a major artist into politics would be a boon for the show. \u201cIf Trump says the Grammys are overrated on Monday morning, people will go looking for what he\u2019s talking about,\u201d Mr. Simmons said. \u201cI hope he does. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562298.9456592}
