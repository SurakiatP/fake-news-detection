Mark Sanford told reporters at the Capitol on Tuesday that in the spirit of President Donald Trump\u2019s legacy as a businessman, he is treating the Obamacare bill supported by Speaker Paul Ryan (R. .) as the beginning of the process, not the end. [\u201cIn as much as President Trump views many things as a negotiation, I\u2019m quite sure he would rarely take any party\u2019s opening bid,\u201d said Sanford, flanked by other members of the House Freedom Caucus, as well as Sen. Rand Paul (R. .) and Sen. Mike Lee (R. ) \u2014  all of whom consider the RyanCare bill a weak attempt to repeal and replace the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.  \u201cWith regard to a healthcare bill moving forward, I see leadership\u2019s healthcare plan as an opening proposal,\u201d he said. \u201cThe debate that is forming will allow conservatives to enhance and improve what has been proposed, and I think this could represent a win for patients, healthcare providers, and the taxpayer alike,\u201d the congressman said. \u201cIn the case of the Affordable Care Act, it\u2019s important that we not lower the bar on what we believe simply because a Republican is now in the White House,\u201d he said. Sanford said he and other Capitol Hill conservatives do not understand how every House and Senate Republican voted for the 2015 repeal and replace bill, but the 2015 bill is no longer supported by the Republican leadership. The 2015 Obamacare repeal and replace bill was authored by Rep. Tom Price (R. .) who is now Heath and Human Services Secretary. \u201cWe have a repeal bill that was fully supported by House and Senate Republicans and made its way to President Obama\u2019s desk,\u201d he said. \u201cAs Republicans, we decried the fact that he would veto it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy would we now water down this same bill and send a new and weaker bill to President Trump?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742564017.1634202}
