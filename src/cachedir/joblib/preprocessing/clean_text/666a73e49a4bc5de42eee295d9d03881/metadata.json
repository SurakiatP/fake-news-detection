However, Emirati authorities reportedly provided special visas for Danon and his staff to enable their trip, reported the Israeli channel. \\nBarring Jordan and Egypt, which have open, diplomatic relations with the Tel Aviv regime, Arab governments claim that they do not recognize Israel. They say they would normalize relations with the Tel Aviv regime only when it reaches a deal with the Palestinians, whose lands the Israeli regime has occupied. \\nHowever, there have been numerous reports and public statements indicating covert ties between the Arab governments and Israel. \\nIn Mid-March, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his regime\u2019s relations with regional Arab countries was \u201c dramatically warming .\u201d Moshe Ya\u2019alon, Israel\u2019s minister of military affairs, also in February pointed to open channels between the regime and Arab states. \\nAlso in July, a Saudi delegation headed by a former military general visited Israel and met a senior Israeli foreign ministry official and a number of Knesset members. \\nAnwar Eshki, the Saudi former general, met Israel\u2019s foreign ministry director general Dore Gold, and Yoav Mordechai, who coordinates the Israeli regime\u2019s activities in the occupied territories. \\nIn November 2015, AP cited an Israeli foreign ministry spokesman as saying that Tel Aviv would \u201csoon\u201d open a \u201cpermanent mission\u201d in Abu Dhabi. The mission, it said, would operate as part of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) based in the Emirati city. Related Posts:'"}, "time": 1742564137.489987}
