Elizabeth Warren ( ) and many of her fellow Democrats for their support of illegal immigrants and calling for these politicians to put United States veterans first. [\u201cSenator Warren and others like her should know the difference between legal and illegal activity and chose instead to act out negatively in selfish political theater,\u201d the letter reads. It asks, \u201cWhere\u2019s your rally for US Veterans, Senator Warren?\u201d The group wrote they are \u201cdeeply troubled by the continued lack of prioritization by some prominent elected members of our government. \u201d  John MacDonald, a board member and VAV spokesman, signed the letter. He and fellow VAV member Dennis Moschella appeared on \u201cFox  Friends Weekend\u201d Sunday and were invited back on again Monday morning. During Sunday\u2019s interview, MacDonald reminded Warren, \u201cIllegal immigrants didn\u2019t vote for her. \u201d According to the Boston Herald, the group has funded the purchase of   wheelchairs for local veterans and horse therapy at Ironstone Farm in Andover, Massachusetts. \u201cA message we have for every politician in this country: There are between 15 and 20 million veterans,\u201d MacDonald said in Monday\u2019s interview. \u201cIf we get all our veterans together, people that are serving currently in the armed forces, and call our representatives, we have an unbelievable voting bloc. \u201d The letter also criticizes Sen. Ed Markey ( ) Reps. Michael Capuano ( ) and Seth Moulton ( ) and Boston\u2019s Democrat Mayor Martin Walsh for not doing enough for veterans issues. Moulton served in the Iraq War. The sole Republican mentioned in the letter is Sen. John McCain ( ). \u201cEven Republican Senator and US Veteran John McCain has seemed to forget about his fellow veterans and the deep troubles at the VA  \u2026     and its extremely sad,\u201d the letter notes. Last December, Breitbart News reported that some employees at the hospice unit of the Veterans Affairs medical center (VAMC) in Bay Pines, Florida, left the body of a deceased veteran in a shower room for over nine hours. In 2015, a damning report published by the Inspector General for Veterans Affairs revealed that a number of former combatants\u2019   documents at the Los Angeles VA Regional Office (VARO) were placed in employee shred boxes without being processed. All but one of the documents labeled for shredding had the potential to affect veterans\u2019 benefits. According to the Boston Herald, Warren spokeswoman Lacey Rose said the   of veterans is of \u201cutmost importance\u201d to the senator. \u201cShe also knows that standing up for our veterans and rejecting President Trump\u2019s unlawful, immoral, and irresponsible attacks on immigrants are not mutually exclusive issues. \u201d Follow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter and Periscope @AdelleNaz'"}, "time": 1742561819.769596}
