Long jumped to his Twitter account to slam fans disappointed over his decision. [After announcing that he would be one of at least six Patriots players who will not attend the White House meeting, Long was hit with a wave of tweets by fans upset over his move. Some of the criticism appears to have stuck in the player\u2019s craw and he took to Twitter to strike back with a series of disjointed, sometimes childish, other times sensible attacks on the fans.  Of all his tweets, one stood out as a common sense note about what these White House events really are. \u201dYou should go talk to trump if you want change\u201d I\u2019m skipping a photo op, not a congressional hearing.  \u2014   Chris Long (@JOEL9ONE) February 17, 2017,  Indeed, the event is just a photo op. But, if it is that meaningless, why make such a big statement by skipping it? In any case, Long unleashed a tweetstorm of other responses to fans to explain his decision and in many cases responding directly to their complaints. Sorry dude. I appreciate your support of me as a football player, but I just don\u2019t get this tweet. https:  .   \u2014   Chris Long (@JOEL9ONE) February 17, 2017,  Heard it all this week  \u2026    if you don\u2019t want to hear about some of the dumb shit I\u2019ve heard  \u2026    mute away, but it\u2019s good.
