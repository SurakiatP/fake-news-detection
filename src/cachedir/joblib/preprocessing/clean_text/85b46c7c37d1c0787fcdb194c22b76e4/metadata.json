Disturbing footage emerged of the fatal encounter between a black man and police officers in Charlotte, N. C. Recorded on a cellphone by the wife of the man, Keith Scott, the video shows the officers ignoring her as she tells them from a distance that her husband is unarmed, has a traumatic brain injury and just took his medicine. As she pleads with the officers not to shoot, the sound of gunfire can be heard. \u201cHe better live,\u201d she says repeatedly, turning the camera to his body on the ground. Then: \u201cDid you all call the police? I mean, did you all call an ambulance?\u201d _____ 2. Stock prices dipped on Wall Street. Some investors dropped Yahoo, driving down its share price a day after the company revealed the 2014 breach of a staggering 500 million user accounts, an episode that may affect Verizon\u2019s deal to acquire the company. Facebook\u2019s stock was down, too, after it acknowledged a measuring error led to inflated figures on video consumption, while Twitter shares shot up  \u2014   way up  \u2014   on reports that the company was in talks to be bought. _____ 3. President Obama vetoed a bill that would allow families of Sept. 11 victims to sue the Saudi government for any role in the attacks. But Congress, which passed the bill in both houses with bipartisan support, is likely to override the veto, which would be a first during Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency. Mr. Obama will speak at the opening of the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of African American History and Culture on Saturday. _____ 4. Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump are  preparing for their first debate, each looking to take advantage of the other\u2019s vulnerabilities on Monday night. In our campaign podcast, The   Mr. Trump\u2019s ghostwriter for \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d shares his observations on both candidates\u2019 weak spots. As of Sunday, there will be a new platform for following the race: We the People, a Snapchat Discover channel from one of the founders of Politico. _____ 5. Mr. Trump won the surprise endorsement of a former bitter rival: Ted Cruz. And in another sign of Republican acquiescence, if not unity, House Speaker Paul Ryan, who once made it a point to counter Mr. Trump\u2019s more controversial statements, generally deflects questions about the candidate now. Here\u2019s our    voter registration guide. _____ 6. In theaters this weekend: \u201cThe Magnificent Seven,\u201d a remake of a remake. Our critic says its main redeeming feature is Denzel Washington, \u201ca great star, which means that he has that ineluctable what\u2019  for selling the goods no matter what their   date. \u201d And our TV experts recommend Season 3 of \u201cTransparent\u201d (Amazon) and, for those who want to relive the distinctive humor of Garry Shandling, \u201cThe Larry Sanders Show\u201d (HBO   Now). _____ 7. In   San Francisco, the new   Millennium apartment tower has taken on a pronounced lean, forcing city officials to reassess how buildings are vetted. An exemplar of the city\u2019s construction spree, the tower is the subject of a   suit on behalf of the   unnerved residents, some of whom paid more than $2 million for a   apartment. _____ 8. Violence in Syria suddenly escalated. Government forces and their Russian allies launched aerial assaults on   areas of the northern city of Aleppo and threatened a ground invasion. Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s efforts to revive a   at the United Nations appeared to collapse. President Obama has said the situation in Syria \u201chaunts me constantly,\u201d but his calculations of the realities, including the difficulty of trusting deals with Russia, have stopped him from greater intervention. _____ 9. One of our   stories today is by a novelist whose defense of fiction as a vehicle for empathy was met with outrage by those who understood her interest in writing about people different from herself to be excusing cultural appropriation. The novelist, Lionel Shriver (\u201cWe Need to Talk About Kevin\u201d) said she worried that the    stance popular among the young could end up damaging progressive politics. \u201cThere are many people who see these frenzies about cultural appropriation, trigger warnings,   and safe spaces as overtly crazy,\u201d she writes. \u201cThe shrill tyranny of the left helps to push them toward Donald Trump. \u201d _____ 10. Finally,  need a break? You need venture no farther than your armchair to go to the ends of the earth through the eyes of six adventuresome photographers. \u201cIt\u2019s the region where Lucy, the famous hominin, was found it was the start of humanity, and it feels like it,\u201d one of them wrote about his visit to the area pictured above, the Danakil Desert in Ethiopia.
