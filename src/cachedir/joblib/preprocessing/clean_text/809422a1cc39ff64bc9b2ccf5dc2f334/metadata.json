{"duration": 0.12420368194580078, "input_args": {"text": "'The highly charged debate over transgender rights has resulted in a tangle of contradictory laws governing access to public bathrooms and locker rooms across the country. Many states permit transgender people to choose bathrooms and locker rooms based on their gender identity, considering it a civil rights issue. But in a handful of states and cities, legislators are moving in the opposite direction. Here are some milestones in the national debate. 2012 | Cities including Austin, Tex. Berkeley, Calif. Philadelphia Santa Fe, N. M. and Seattle were among the first to pass laws requiring     restrooms, following a pattern emerging at schools and universities. Soon museums, restaurants and even the White House (in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building) began rebranding restrooms, resulting in a dizzying range of creative signage and vocabulary. December 2014 | In a memo by Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. the Justice Department took the position that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 applied to claims of discrimination based on gender identity. The memo was one of a combination of policies, lawsuits and public statements that the Obama administration used to change the civil rights landscape for gay men, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender people. May 2016 | The Justice and Education Departments issued guidance that, under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, schools receiving federal money may not discriminate based on a student\u2019s transgender status  \u2014   and that the departments would treat a student\u2019s gender identity as the student\u2019s sex for purposes of enforcing Title IX. Jan. 20, 2015 | President Barack Obama mentioned transgender people in his State of the Union address, a presidential first. \u201cThat\u2019s why we defend free speech and advocate for political prisoners, and condemn the persecution of women, or religious minorities, or people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender,\u201d Mr. Obama said. Nov. 3, 2015 | After a yearlong battle, Houston voters easily repealed an   ordinance that banned discrimination based on several \u201cprotected characteristics,\u201d including gender identity. Opponents said the measure would allow men claiming to be women to enter women\u2019s bathrooms and inflict harm. The message \u201dNo Men in Women\u2019s Bathrooms\u201d on signs and in television and radio ads turned the debate from one about equal rights to one about protecting women and girls from sexual predators. (Houston became the largest city in the United States to elect an openly gay mayor, Annise D. Parker, in December 2009 she had pushed hard for the ordinance.) November, 2015 | Public schools began to write policies requiring transgender students to use private changing and showering facilities, drawing complaints of discrimination. February 2016 | The South Dakota Legislature approved a bill that would require public school students to use bathrooms and other facilities that correspond to their biological sex, defined in the bill as \u201ca person\u2019s chromosomes and anatomy as identified at birth. \u201d Gov. Dennis Daugaard, a Republican, vetoed it. The Legislature announced in January that it would consider a similar bill. March 23, 2016 | Meeting in special session, North Carolina legislators passed a   bill known as House Bill 2 barring transgender people from bathrooms and locker rooms that did not match their biological sex. Republicans unanimously supported the bill, while in the Senate, Democrats walked out in protest. \u201cThis is a direct affront to equality, civil rights and local autonomy,\u201d the Senate Democratic leader, Dan Blue, said in a statement. The bill\u2019s passage prompted the N. B. A. to withdraw this season\u2019s   Game from Charlotte and led the N. C. A. A. to move playoff games in several sports  \u2014   including   and   games in its most prominent event, the Division I men\u2019s basketball tournament  \u2014   out of the state. May 12, 2016 | The Obama administration took up a legal fight with North Carolina over the issue, quickly issuing guidance  \u2014   signed by Justice and Education Department officials  \u2014   that was sent to all school districts, outlining what schools should do to ensure that no student was discriminated against. The letter did not have the force of law, but it contained an implicit threat: Schools that did not abide by the Obama administration\u2019s interpretation of the law could face lawsuits or a loss of federal dollars. The measure attracted criticism and support from across the country. Cities in the Deep South were increasingly at odds with their states on gay rights and other benchmarks, moving toward common ground with big cities on the coasts. And North Carolina, the rare Southern state that is evenly split between liberals and conservatives, was considered to be up for grabs in the November presidential race. But backlash against the law roiled the governor\u2019s race and affected other crucial contests. April 19, 2016 | A federal appeals court in Richmond, Va. ruled in favor of Gavin Grimm, a transgender student who was born female and wanted to use the boys\u2019 restroom at his rural Virginia high school. April 22, 2016 | As the Republican presidential   Donald J. Trump said that transgender people should be allowed to use whatever bathroom they feel most comfortable with. At a town   event, he said that North Carolina\u2019s legislation had resulted in an exodus of businesses and \u201cstrife\u201d from people on both sides of the issue. \u201cYou leave it the way it is,\u201d he said. \u201cThere have been very few complaints the way it is. \u201d Aug. 21, 2016 | A federal judge in North Texas blocked the Obama administration from enforcing guidelines intended to expand restroom access for transgender students across the country. In his ruling, which he said should apply nationwide, Judge Reed O\u2019Connor said the government had not complied with federal law when it issued \u201cdirectives which contradict the existing legislative and regulatory text. \u201d The Trump administration has decided not to challenge the injunction in court. September 2016 | Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, signed a bill requiring all   bathrooms to be gender neutral, effective March 1, the first such state legislation in the country. Jan. 5, 2017 | A bill revealed by Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a Republican, would require transgender people to use bathrooms in government buildings and public schools and universities based on their \u201cbiological sex,\u201d overruling any contrary local rules, and raising the prospect of a new confrontation with college sports officials and professional sports leagues. Feb. 22, 2017 | President Trump rescinded protections for transgender students that had allowed them to use bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity, overruling his own education secretary. In a joint letter, the top civil rights officials from the Justice and Education Departments rejected the Obama administration\u2019s position that nondiscrimination laws require schools to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice. With Mr. Trump\u2019s decision, the focus shifts to the Supreme Court, where Mr. Grimm\u2019s 2016 lawsuit is scheduled for oral arguments at the end of March.'"}, "time": 1742564247.9370964}
