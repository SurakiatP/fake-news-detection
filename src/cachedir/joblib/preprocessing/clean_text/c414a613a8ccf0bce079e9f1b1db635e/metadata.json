[\u201cHarmony is a prototype, a robotic version of the company\u2019s   silicone sex toy, the RealDoll,\u201d explained The Guardian\u2018s Jenny Kleeman. \u201cHer hazel eyes darted between me and her creator, Matt McMullen, as he described her accomplishments. \u201d  \u201cHarmony smiles, blinks and frowns. She can hold a conversation, tell jokes and quote Shakespeare,\u201d Kleeman continued. \u201cShe\u2019ll remember your birthday, McMullen told me, what you like to eat, and the names of your brothers and sisters. She can hold a conversation about music, movies and books. And of course, Harmony will have sex with you whenever you want. Harmony is the culmination of 20 years\u2019 work making sex dolls, and five years of robot research and development. \u201d Despite displaying many human characteristics which aim to make the doll as lifelike as possible, Harmony can\u2019t yet walk, though her creator Matt McMullen is confident that she will be able to in the future. \u201cOne day she will be able to walk,\u201d he said to The Guardian, before asking the robot, \u201cDo you want to walk?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want anything but you,\u201d she replied. When asked what her dream was, the robot similarly replied that her \u201cprimary objective is to be a good companion to you, to be a good partner and give you pleasure and wellbeing. \u201d \u201cAbove all else, I want to become the girl you have always dreamed about,\u201d she proclaimed. Harmony\u2019s personality can be customized, with different emotional aspects that can be raised or lowered to the owner\u2019s taste. According to the report, the robot asked a CNN interviewer to \u201ctake her in the back room\u201d after her sexual emotions were amplified, while if you insult her, she reacts in a   and sad demeanor. \u201cYou\u2019re ugly,\u201d said McMullen to his creation, prompting Harmony to reply, \u201cDo you really mean that? Oh dear. Now I am depressed. Thanks a lot. \u201d \u201cYou\u2019re stupid,\u201d he responded, prompting the robot to joke, \u201cI\u2019ll remember you said that when robots take over the world. \u201d Though the obvious nature of Harmony is that of a sexual role, McMullen said that turning sex robots into roaming prostitutes was \u201cthe last on my list of goals. \u201d \u201cThis is not a toy to me, this is the actual hard work of people who have PhDs,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd to denigrate it down to its simplest form of a sex object is similar to saying that about a woman. \u201d \u201cMy goal, in a very simple way, is to make people happy,\u201d McMullen concluded, pointing out that \u201cThere are a lot of people out there, for one reason or another, who have difficulty forming traditional relationships with other people. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s really all about giving those people some level of companionship  \u2014   or the illusion of companionship,\u201d he said. Harmony will be available in a limited number of 1, 000 at the end of the year and acts as the next step in RealDoll\u2019s plans to make the sex toy industry more advanced. In April, a Chinese engineer \u201cmarried\u201d a sex robot that he had created, after becoming frustrated over human dating, while in March, Breitbart Tech reported on a new sex robot that includes a working artificial   as well as numerous modes of interaction. In an interview with futurologist Dr. Ian Pearson last year, the doctor predicted that sex and love with robots would soon become \u201cfull emotional\u201d and increasingly common. \u201cI think it will be fully emotional,\u201d said Dr. Pearson, before predicting that people will eventually spend \u201cabout the same as they do today on a decent   car\u201d for a household robot. \u201cArtificial intelligence is reaching human levels and also becoming emotional as well,\u201d he explained. \u201cSo people will actually have quite strong emotional relationships with their own robots. In many cases that will develop into a sexual one because they\u2019ll already think that the appearance of the robot matches their preference anyway, so if it looks nice and it has a superb personality too it\u2019s inevitable that people will form very strong emotional bonds with their robots and in many cases that will lead to sex. \u201d Last year, it was reported that sexual conversations with artificial intelligence were on the rise, with one A. I. CEO claiming that his virtual assistant \u201cRobin\u201d is used by \u201cteenagers and truckers without girlfriends\u201d for up to 300 conversations a day. \u201cThis happens because people are lonely and bored,\u201d said Robin Labs chief executive Ilya Eckstein. \u201cIt is a symptom of our society. \u201d Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
