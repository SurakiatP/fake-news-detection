(Photo by AFP) \\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May is facing growing criticism over her comments about Brexit at a leaked private speech to Goldman Sachs. \\nThe premier, who has publicly made the case for a hard Brexit following a June referendum, speaks of the \u201cbenefits\u201d of being an EU member in the hour-long session, whose audio file was leaked to the Guardian on Tuesday night, drawing harsh criticism on Wednesday. \\n\u201cI think the economic arguments are clear. I think being part of a 500 million [population] trading bloc is significant for us. I think, as I was saying to you a little earlier, that one of the issues is that a lot of people will invest here in the UK because it is the UK in Europe,\u201d she is heard saying. \u201cIf we were not in Europe, I think there would be firms and companies who would be looking to say, do they need to develop a mainland Europe presence rather than a UK presence? So I think there are definite benefits for us in economic terms.\u201d \\nThe leader of the rival Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, attacked the prime minister for having failed to address her own concerns about leaving the European Union. \\nCorbyn has previously been calling on the Tory-held government for a clear plan to exit the bloc.

This work is being done in government and it must now be published,\u201d he said, asserting that May\u2019s comments \u201cdemonstrated that the prime minister was just as worried privately as the rest of us are publicly about the economic impact of the hard, destructive Brexit her government seems set on.\u201d \\nAccording to the Guardian , the audio file was leaked as May was \u201cprioritizing cutting immigration over staying in the single market, while refusing to elaborate any further on her plans for taking the UK out of the EU.\u201d British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson leaves the weekly cabinet meeting at 10 Downing Street in London on October 25, 2016.

The membership fee seems rather small for all that access. Why are we so determined to turn our back on it?\u201d he wrote, calling the EU a \u201cboon for the world and for Europe.\u201d Loading ...\""}, "time": 1742564099.7545435}
