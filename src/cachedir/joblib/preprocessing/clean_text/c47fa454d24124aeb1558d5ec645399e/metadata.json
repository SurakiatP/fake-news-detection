Is a vast kitchen worth settling blocks from a trendy thoroughfare? Usually, a compromise is struck. Unless it isn\u2019t. For a small but resolute faction of New Yorkers, living in a particular neighborhood, or even on a certain street, is an unwavering desire. These partisans happily renounce many   comforts for the privilege  \u2014   even though it means squeezing into a minuscule space. These are not   individuals who have been painted into a corner, nor are they young professional types starting out in the new  . Many are simply realizing the fantasy of moving to a charmed setting, home size be damned. For others, safe and socially or culturally rich environs are far more alluring than square footage. And then there are those who prize geographic convenience, as well as the emotional liberation of (really)   living. For some, the ultimate New York neighborhood may be Greenwich Village, defined by its winding streets, historic architecture, cozy but chic storefronts and diverse dining options. Roomy digs are less essential when a neighborhood serves as an extension of your living room, wherever in the five boroughs it may be. Vicki Behm and her husband, Glenn Coleman, are Chicago transplants who have lived in New York for 20 years. Their   residential history is a handbook for urban downsizing, as they have managed to achieve, in four happy translocations, the equivalent of reducing a cow to a bouillon cube. \u201cBefore buying this place, we sat down and said, \u2018This is little, even for us,\u2019 \u201d recalls Ms. Behm, a painter and public school teacher, while sitting in the snug living     studio of her    residence on West 11th Street in Greenwich Village, several blocks from the Hudson River. An accomplished artist who once favored large, abstract canvases  \u2014   \u201cNot anymore I draw at this table\u201d  \u2014   she had long been drawn to the neighborhood. The couple\u2019s real estate journey in New York began in 1996 when they rented a comfortable   apartment in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn. Two years later they purchased a nearby     1840s   townhouse, with three bedrooms and two working marble fireplaces. Four years later, for reasons personal and professional, they decided to move to Manhattan, even if it meant downscaling. Being devotees of modern art, the couple gravitated to the landmark 1936 Rockefeller Apartments, built in the curvaceous International Style, on West 55th Street. Their        was augmented by a     terrace. The building had a private garden and a captivating neighbor, the Museum of Modern Art. \u201cIt was nice, well run and fit us well,\u201d Mr. Coleman, a financial journalist, said of the Rockefeller. \u201cAlthough I don\u2019t miss cutting 24 checks at Christmastime. \u201d Several years later, they contracted the highly contagious Village virus. \u201cWhen we were living in Midtown, we used to walk around this neighborhood and say, \u2018Gosh, wouldn\u2019t it be great to live here someday?\u2019 \u201d Ms. Behm recounts. \u201cI never got that out of my mind. \u201d One day they happened upon a   in a     in a    brick compound of five contiguous buildings that wrap around West 11th and Washington Streets. The setting was ideal. \u201cBut the apartment was in really rough shape,\u201d Ms. Behm said. \u201cEven the halls were bad, with that surface like icing on a cake that you can cut yourself on. \u201d A big plus was the shared roof garden with trees, plants and views of the Statue of Liberty and Empire State Building. They bought the     for $660, 000. They executed a complete, historically minded overhaul, including redoing walls and ceilings, and installing period woodwork and period black doorknobs. One small bedroom was turned into a   closet, study and TV room, while the other remained a sleeping space. \u201cOnce we got used to it, and it took a little time, we were happy with the move,\u201d Ms. Behm said. \u201cExcept those stairs,\u201d Mr. Coleman said. They loved the neighborhood. As the Village goes, West 11th delivers on the swoon meter: gracious old brownstones, inviting restaurants, cafes and bars, an art gallery and a tiny spa. But last summer they learned through the   grapevine that a      in the compound was going on the market. Because the tiny   place opened onto a handsome   courtyard of about 2, 000 square feet, the locals referred to it as a \u201ccottage. \u201d \u201cAnd I have always wanted to live in a cottage,\u201d Ms. Behm said, beaming. She soon learned that her infatuation with cottages was shared by a number of other New Yorkers. On the day of the open house, an estimated 250 prospective buyers queued up around the block. Being residents of the   Ms. Behm and Mr. Coleman were on the inside track and purchased it for $825, 000. Their current dwelling is not exactly a   cottage, but it feels like one. The courtyard just outside, where they have put a small table and chairs, belongs to their   Ms. Behm said, but is seldom used by others. After minor alterations, the couple moved in last September. They are more than content. Of course, the smaller you go, the more you heave overboard, Ms. Behm said. \u201cSo out goes the Herman Miller sofa and credenza out go my big art books  \u2014   that was hard. The big turkey platter had to go, also my nine cake pans  \u2014   I\u2019ll buy that flourless chocolate cake. \u201d She also sold all but one of her large paintings. Their cheerful   room features a working fireplace (wood is stored at the bottom of   bookshelves) hardwood floors, tall windows facing the courtyard and an   ceiling. A napkin\u2019s toss away are a    bedroom with a   closet, a cleverly arranged galley kitchen and a small tiled bathroom. The entrance hallway serves as a coat closet. \u201cThe apartment doesn\u2019t feel as small as it is,\u201d Mr. Coleman says, \u201cbecause for seven to eight months of the year the courtyard is part of our living space. \u201d Christine Kudrav, 30, an executive at a philanthropic foundation in Manhattan, arrived in New York in 2008 from Virginia, landing a   apartment in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, of more than 1, 000 square feet. A roommate came with the package, but considering her means, that was to be expected. \u201dIt was fine,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBut back then there were few amenities there, like restaurants and bars, not like it is today. \u201d This paucity of amenities occasioned a move to a sizable   apartment in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn (also shared) then a      residency in Manhattan in Chelsea  \u2014   three bedrooms, three roommates. After that came a stint in a moderately sized place in a   in Brooklyn Heights with a boyfriend. When her relationship took a downward turn last year, she decided to end her courtship with city rentals and buy something. After exploring Brooklyn neighborhoods like Williamsburg and   Gardens, she set her sights on vibrant Clinton Hill, even though she knew it might be expensive. \u201cI always really loved Clinton Hill, and was willing to go smaller to live there,\u201d she said. And so it was that she bought a    apartment in an 1870   limestone building on Clinton Avenue for $300, 000. Ms. Kudrav had immediately fallen in love with the block  \u2014   an architectural farrago of mostly    structures  \u2014   and the diverse social diversions it afforded. \u201cI like dive bars,\u201d she said. Clinton Hill, it turns out, amply satisfies this thirst. Her home is also a bicycle ride away from two parks, Fort Greene and Prospect  \u2014   \u201cI\u2019m at both constantly when the weather is nice,\u201d she said. Two of her favorite restaurants are in the \u2019hood: Emily and Taqueria Tepango. She also frequents Olea Mediterranean Taverna and the  Greenlight Bookstore in nearby Fort Greene. Like many   downsizers, Ms. Kudrav rationalized her choice by noting that what she sacrificed on the inside was more than made up for outside. She says the block has become a wing of her home. \u201cI don\u2019t feel closed in,\u201d Ms. Kudrav said. Nor does she miss the clothing and kitchen items she jettisoned. Her   building has a wide, handsome marble and oak foyer where one can envision the children of the original owner, a Union officer in the Civil War, sliding down the gleaming banister. Ms. Kudrav\u2019s dwelling features    ceilings, tall rounded windows and two   clothes closets. A small but functional cooking area is built into one wall  \u2014   she cooked a dinner for eight friends days after moving in  \u2014   with an island that doubles as a table. One   item is a large wooden wall panel that opens to reveal a   Murphy bed. Ms. Kudrav provides a demonstration, lowering the technological marvel and proudly demonstrating how two large pillows can be employed as a headboard. Rather than surrender space to a television, she plans to buy a projector that can display programs on a screen or wall and can be stored in a drawer. \u201cAt the beginning, I have to say, I was a little nervous about whether I could make such a small place work,\u201d she conceded. \u201cBut this is where I wanted to live, and I feel I made the right decision. \u201d Nick Demos, 44, a theater producer and director who has a sideline as a yoga teacher, only recently discovered the transcendental contentment of shoe box living. \u201cLook over here,\u201d he called out to a visitor. \u201cThis is my tiny kitchen with my tiny refrigerator, my tiny stove and tiny sink. \u201d The tiny kitchen was aseptically clean, unsullied by edible substances. \u201cI eat out all the time,\u201d he says. A native of Montana, Mr. Demos, whose trim, muscular physique speaks to his earlier career as a Broadway dancer, resided for eight years in Oklahoma City, where he was the artistic director of the Lyric Theater of Oklahoma. When New York called, in 2008, he sold his   ranch, in one day, for the asking price of $150, 000. \u201cI was very, very, very lucky,\u201d he adds. \u201cThis was two months before the economy fell. \u201d Having read about a renaissance in Harlem, he gravitated there, purchasing a    condo in a contemporary building on 148th Street and Bradhurst Avenue, overlooking Jackie Robinson Park  \u2014   comfortable and cheerful enough, with a terrace, a sizable kitchen, good natural light and various amenities for $395, 000. This arrangement sufficed for a number of years, but after a while, the commute to the theater district became old. What is more, the neighborhood\u2019s predicted cultural reawakening was too slow in coming to suit him. \u201cI always, always wanted to live in the Village,\u201d he said. \u201cBut until then, especially coming from Oklahoma, I was not sure if I was ready to go as small as it might take to do it. \u201d Last year, he sold his condo for $550, 000 and went small, really small  \u2014   as in    small. (Well, almost that small: That square footage doesn\u2019t include the dollhouse kitchen or the bathroom.) His spare but sunny studio on West 13th Street near the Avenue of the Americas cost him $425, 000 and is nestled in the rear of a small brick   with a sleek lobby and a   doorman. While the block is not as serene as areas farther west, the kind of amenities he desires are nearby: the New School, the Quad Cinema, an Italian restaurant called Da Andrea and the Jade Hotel Greenwich Village. The apartment, about   neatly made bed, accommodates a small work desk, a bureau, a   bath and what passes for a living room. \u201cThis sofa you are sitting on,\u201d he said with a grin, \u201cis half of a sectional  \u2014   got rid of the other half. I could never entertain here. \u201d He estimates that he has condensed his possessions by 80 percent since Oklahoma. Like many others who have drastically downsized in order to realize their neighborhood dream, Mr. Demos noted that what he has lost in square footage he has gained in convenience and peace of mind. \u201cThere is a sense of security in paring down to just the things you absolutely need,\u201d he said. \u201cI work, I go out, I travel, I\u2019m in the neighborhood I want, I come home, I sleep  \u2014   what more do you really need?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742563727.4048924}
