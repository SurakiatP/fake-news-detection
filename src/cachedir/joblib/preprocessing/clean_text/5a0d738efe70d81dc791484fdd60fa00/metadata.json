The best anyone can do is point you to where forgiveness is, and that journey begins and ends with Jesus Christ . He shed God\u2019s own blood on the cross at Calvary to obtain that pardon for you, and He did not \u201ctransfer that power\u201d to any other human agency. When you step into the Catholic \u201cconfessional\u201d and ask a man for forgiveness, you step out of that box just as dirty as you went in. Cut out the phony middleman, and go straight to the Source if you want to be clean. If you put your trust in the black-robed, \u201chocus-pocus\u201d man from Rome, you will be gravely disappointed. Pun intended. \\nIt continues a special dispensation granted last year for the duration of the Year of Mercy \u2014 which finished Sunday \u2014 which gave all priests, rather than just bishops and specially designated confessors, the power to absolve the sin of abortion. \\nWhile the practical effect of Francis\u2019 announcement remains unclear, it draws attention to the prevailing theme of his papacy: That the doors of the Church must remain open, just as God\u2019s forgiveness and mercy extend to all those who repent from sin. THE GOSPEL TRUTH ABOUT VATICAN CITY AND THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH \\nThat said , the Catholic Church\u2019s stance on abortion has not changed \u2014 it is still viewed as a \u201cgrave sin.\u201d But it makes it easier for women who have had abortions to be absolved for their actions, and rejoin the church. \\n\u201cI wish to restate as firmly as I can that abortion is a grave sin, since it puts an end to an innocent life,\u201d the Pope\u2019s letter states. \u201cIn the same way, however, I can and must state that there is no sin that God\u2019s mercy cannot reach and wipe away when it finds a repentant heart seeking to be reconciled with the Father.\u201d \\nThe letter continues: \u201cMay every priest, therefore, be a guide, support and comfort to penitents on this journey of special reconciliation. \u201cI henceforth grant to all priests, in virtue of their ministry, the faculty to absolve those who have committed the sin of procured abortion.\u201d \\n\u201cFor by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:\u201d Ephesians 2:8,9 (KJV) \\nForgiveness for the sin of abortion , and for all sins, is found only in Jesus Christ and Him alone. \\n '"}, "time": 1742563863.4306326}
