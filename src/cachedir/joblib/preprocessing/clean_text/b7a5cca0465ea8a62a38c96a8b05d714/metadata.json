On that day, the distance between our planet and the moon will be the shortest in almost 70 years! The last time it happened was in January 1948. \\nEarth\u2019s natural satellite will appear about 14% bigger and 30% brighter in comparison with an average full moon. It is estimated that the next supermoon of this size will take place on 25 November 2034 , so make sure you don\u2019t miss this beautiful celestial event (if the weather conditions in your region are favorable for skywatching, of course)! \\nAs NASA reports: \\n\u201cThe full moon of November 14 is not only the closest full moon of 2016 but also the closest full moon to date in the 21 st century. The full moon won\u2019t come this close to Earth again until 25 November 2034.\u201d What Is a Supermoon \\nAlmost all celestial bodies have elliptical orbits; that\u2019s why the distance between our planet and the moon is not always the same. The further side of the moon\u2019s orbit is called apogee and the closer one is called perigee. In short, when a full moon occurs on the perigee, then we get a supermoon phenomenon , which causes our natural satellite to appear closer and brighter in the night sky. \\nWhile supermoons are quite frequent (this year, we will have three of those), the full moon of November 14 will be within approximately 2 hours of perigee , which makes it a truly rare phenomenon. How to Watch a Supermoon \\nA perfect location to enjoy the coming supermoon (as well as any other astronomical phenomenon) is somewhere away from the city so that the urban lights don\u2019t interfere with skywatching. \\nDon\u2019t forget that the difference between a regular full moon and a supermoon is best seen to the human eye when the moon is close to the horizon. \\nAccording to NASA, \u201c When the moon is near the horizon, it can look unnaturally large when viewed through trees, buildings, or other foreground objects.\u201d \\nThe moon will be at the peak of its full phase and, therefore, will appear the biggest at 8:52am EST. For those of you living in Australia, the moon will reach its full phase at 12:52 a.m. AEST on November 15.
