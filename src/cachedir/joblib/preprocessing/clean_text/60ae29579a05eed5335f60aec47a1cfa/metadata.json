Sometimes, they\u2019re just taken with a subject, like Myanmar\u2019s unemployed elephants or President Xi Jinping\u2019s favorite jacket. Here are some of our favorites. Enjoy. \u201cI Can\u2019t Drive 55,\u201d the rocker Sammy Hagar once famously wailed, but 43 years ago this week, he and every other American driver were faced with obeying the first federal speed limit. Setting speed limits had been the states\u2019 responsibility. But in 1973, OPEC cut oil shipments to the United States for supporting Israel in a war with its Arab neighbors. The embargo hit the American economy hard. In 1974, President Richard M. Nixon signed the Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act, lowering the speed limit to reduce consumption. And American car buyers sought out more   vehicles, turning to a country that had not yet been celebrated for automaking: Japan. The debate over road safety and speed limits continued for decades, and in 1995, President Bill Clinton repealed the federal limit, returning the power to the states. In parts of Texas, drivers can legally go 85 m. p. h. That\u2019s the fastest in the country, though it\u2019s slower than a few places in the world. Stretches of Germany\u2019s autobahn have no maximum limit. It\u2019s a far cry from one of the earliest speed restrictions. In 1901, Connecticut limited some drivers to 12 miles per hour.
