[Now parked close to the bottom of the leaderboard, Woods will need to go low on Friday at the more forgiving North Course at Torrey Pines in La Jolla, CA to make the cut, (projected at  ) and continue the competition over the weekend.  Although the extremely soggy courses played long for all the golfers due to extraordinary amounts of rain the region received in January, Tiger couldn\u2019t keep his drives out of the rough forcing bogeys on 12, 13, 14, and a disastrous double bogey on 15, where he tugged his drive into a ravine. Another bogey on 17 and a one putt birdie on 18 put an end to Tiger\u2019s comeback debut.  Woods can\u2019t blame the course for his troubles, a layout he has dominated in his career, winning there 8 times, including four consecutive wins between 2005 and 2008. Woods caddy Joe LaCava blamed the poor showing for Woods on his lack of patience. \u201cJoey kept telling me all day today, just be patient with it. I didn\u2019t quite smile at him a few of those times he said that. But I was fighting out there trying to get my ball around the golf course and score,\u201d Woods said.  Slow playing conditions also contributed to Tiger\u2019s frustration with rounds taking nearly five and a half hours on Friday. The   Major winner has accustomed himself to playing much quicker practice rounds while gearing up in Florida for his PGA return.  \u201cIt\u2019s just weird to say this but it was just we were playing so much slower than I\u2019m used to. It was just weird waiting that much,\u201d Woods said. \u201cNot used to doing that. At home I guess we\u2019re flying a little quicker than this. It was just a different rhythm. We were out there talking most of the day trying just to kill time. \u201d Woods is hopeful for his Friday round at the North Course where the putting surfaces are better. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go over on some better greens tomorrow, some better conditions and hopefully not only myself but the rest of the guys, we can put some good numbers up. \u201d Australian and world #1 ranked golfer Jason Day, who played with Tiger on Thursday, also struggled shooting 73. He acknowledged that it\u2019s too early in the season to judge Tiger\u2019s performance. \u201cHaving 17 months off is a very, very long time. We can\u2019t just break down everything he did today because it\u2019s been 17 months,\u201d he said.  \u201cLet him go a year, let him play and go from there.  That\u2019s the same with us. We can\u2019t panic too much at the start of the year. \u201cLook at Rory\u2019s year last year. He really didn\u2019t do a lot until the FedExCup (Playoffs) and he ended up being the FedExCup champion. \u201d English golfer Justin Rose leads the tournament after shooting a remarkable 7 under 65 on the difficult South Course, while Canadian Adam Hadwin is one back after his 66 on the North. Hadwin is coming off of a 59 last Saturday in his   finish at the CareerBuilder in La Quinta. Haddin became only the ninth player to fire a   round in PGA tour history.'"}, "time": 1742563789.3472586}
