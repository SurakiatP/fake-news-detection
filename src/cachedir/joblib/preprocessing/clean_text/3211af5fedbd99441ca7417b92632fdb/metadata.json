The workweek for many commuters got off to a shaky start. Two New Jersey Transit buses heading into the city collided in the Lincoln Tunnel during the morning commute, shutting down the tunnel\u2019s center tube and snarling traffic for roughly two hours. More than forty people were injured, but luckily, the worst case was a broken jaw. And speaking of drama related to Hudson River crossings, all eyes are (still) on the George Washington Bridge. David Wildstein, the confessed mastermind behind the 2013 lane closings, returned today to the witness stand in Newark. The former official from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey testified that he and other members of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s inner circle did want to punish Democratic Mayor Mark Sokolich of Fort Lee, N. J. for declining to endorse Mr. Christie in the Republican governor\u2019s 2013   campaign. And they had deliberately decided to do so during the first days of school. \u201cThe purpose was to create as big a traffic jam as possible,\u201d Mr. Wildstein said. We leave you, now, to settle onto the couch to watch the first debate of the 2016 general election campaign for president. The   between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump  \u2014   straight from Long Island, at Hofstra University in Hempstead  \u2014   covered topics including the economy, crime statistics and climate.

Stepping in after ten minutes waiting on the steamy Astor Place platform, and with my    strapped to my chest, I didn\u2019t dare make a dash for the next car. Instead, we grudgingly eased ourselves into a seat by the door. \u201cYou look hot. \u201d I glanced up to find a young woman, dare I say a millennial, dressed in a white maxi dress and gold strappy sandals. \u201cYes,\u201d I said, blowing air onto my baby\u2019s flushed face. \u201cLet me help you,\u201d she said, moving from her seat across the car. \u201cI\u2019m switching at the next stop,\u201d I said in an attempt at a polite refusal. From her bag, she produced an iPhone and a   fan blade, everything white like her dress. She plugged the fan into the phone\u2019s charging slot. As it came to life, she turned the gentle breeze toward my baby. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen one of those,\u201d I said. \u201cI just got it at Duane Reade,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought it was a joke. \u201d The beads of sweat forming across her brow and upper lip threatened her perfect hair and makeup, but her only apparent concern was my son. \u201cThank you,\u201d I said. \u201cHe\u2019s adorable,\u201d she said, but offered no other small talk, swiveling the fan between him and me all the way to Bleecker Street. \u201cI\u2019m moving to the next car,\u201d I said as the train came to a stop. I looked back to thank her again, expecting her to follow my move. She was still sitting, eyes closed, finally taking her turn. Read all recent entries and our submissions guidelines.
