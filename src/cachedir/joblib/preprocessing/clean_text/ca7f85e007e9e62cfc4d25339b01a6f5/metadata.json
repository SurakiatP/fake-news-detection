Space exploration has ground to a halt, thanks to ridiculous restrictions imposed on NASA by Washington politicians who don\u2019t know the first thing about space travel. \\nTrump wants America to lead in space once again, and with that in mind he promised more investment in NASA as well as the expansion of current private-public partnerships to maximize America\u2019s potential. \\n\u201cI will free NASA from the restriction of serving primarily as a logistics agency for low-Earth orbit activity,\u201d Trump stated. \u201cInstead, we will refocus its mission on space exploration.\u201d   \\nYears ago, America led the world in space innovation. Astronauts like Neil Armstrong inspired generations of Americans to shoot for the stars . Science and technology programs flourished because America\u2019s children wanted to achieve the impossible. \\nThat dream has faded as our government has scaled back space programs over time. NASA used to regularly redefine the word \u201cwow,\u201d but now all it does is maintain the status quo. \\nWhat Trump is promising is a bright future for America. A revitalized space program would create thousand of jobs, spur advanced technological developments and inspire America\u2019s children to achieve the impossible once again. \\nThat\u2019s what America needs right now.
