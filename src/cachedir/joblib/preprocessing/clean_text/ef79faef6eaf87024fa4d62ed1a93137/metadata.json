Mr. Turnbull told reporters in Sydney the group was \u201c \u201d and inspired by the Islamic State. Five men, ages 21 to 26, were to be formally charged later Friday, the authorities said. Another man and a woman were also taken into custody, but were later released. According to the police, the plotters had scouted Federation Square, a popular shopping and entertainment district, as well as the Flinders Street train station, Melbourne\u2019s busiest, and St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral, an Anglican church. All three locations are close to one another in the center of the city. The country\u2019s justice minister, Michael Keenan, said the planned attack was imminent and \u201cwould have been the most serious in terms of its intent\u201d in Australia. Had it occurred, he added, it would have \u201ccaused very significant casualties. \u201d Andrew Colvin, the commissioner of Australia\u2019s Federal Police, said the arrests had been carried out in overnight raids involving about 400 officers in Melbourne\u2019s northern and western suburbs. \u201cThis is a significant disruption of what we would call an imminent terrorist event,\u201d Mr. Colvin said at a news conference in Sydney, held with Mr. Keenan and Mr. Turnbull. \u201cThey had moved very quickly from an intention to a capability, a developed capability, including quite progressed plans, we will allege,\u201d Mr. Colvin said. The premier of Victoria State, Daniel Andrews, said in Melbourne: \u201cWhat was being planned were not acts of faith, they were, in their planning, acts of evil. \u201d Graham Ashton, the chief commissioner of the Victoria police, said: \u201cThe attack we will allege was being planned was going to involve the use of explosives and we have gathered evidence to support that, and the intention to use other weapons, that could include knives and or a firearm. \u201d Of the five to be charged, four were born in Australia, and one was born in Egypt. \u201cWe believe they were \u201d Mr. Turnbull said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been inspired by Daesh or ISIL, that\u2019s our intelligence at the present time,\u201d he added, using alternate names for the Islamic State. The police have disrupted a number of terrorist plots in Australia, and Mr. Turnbull said that, since September 2014, 57 people have been charged as a result of 25 counterterrorism operations. But he added there had been four attacks in the country since then. In an episode that attracted international attention, two people were killed when a gunman took hostages at a cafe in Sydney in December 2014. The gunman was killed when the police stormed the building. Mr. Colvin said the state and federal police, as well as the Australian Security Intelligence Organization, had been monitoring the Melbourne suspects. \u201cWe believe that they were narrowing down exactly what their plan was, but that\u2019s all in one very small part\u201d of Melbourne\u2019s central business district, he said. The police, he said, were confident there was no longer a threat to public safety. A series of tough counterterrorism measures were enacted by Parliament this year, including legislation that could keep convicted terrorists in prison after the completion of their sentences, and   control orders to monitor children as young as 14 if they were thought to be involved in, or planning, a terrorist act. Mr. Turnbull on Friday urged Australians to defy terrorists by simply going about their lives. \u201cWe are the most successful multicultural society in the world,\u201d Mr. Turnbull said. \u201cThat\u2019s because we have a culture of mutual respect. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561723.4678705}
