[A USDA spokesperson told Washington Post writer Erik Wemple (pictured) that a Breitbart News article may have been the basis for a   Fox News story about food stamp fraud.  \u201cWe reported that back in 2016, $70 million were wasted on food stamp fraud. That was actually incorrect,\u201d Fox and Friends   Abby Huntsman said Friday, correcting a report she made on Tuesday. Huntsman\u2019s retraction came at the behest of the USDA, according to Wemple. \u201cWe are not quite sure where this came from,\u201d a USDA spokesperson reportedly told Wemple, adding \u201cWe saw that there was a story on Breitbart. We have not issued a report on this recently. There is no new rate that we\u2019ve published. So we\u2019re not quite sure why they\u2019re so interested in stirring this up. \u201d The USDA spokesperson was correct Breitbart News did recently publish a piece about food stamps titled: \u201cUnder Obama, 10. 7 Million More Use Food Stamps \u2014  A 32 Percent Jump. \u201d However, nowhere in that article does the word \u201cfraud\u201d appear  \u2014   not once. Wemple did not bother to mention that fact. Within hours of Wemple\u2019s report, several journalists with Verified Twitter accounts used the quote from USDA to call Breitbart the \u201csource\u201d of Fox\u2019s false report. Fox News falsely reported on a   gov study, and you\u2019ll be SHOCKED by who the source was pic. twitter.   \u2014   Alex Griswold (@HashtagGriswold) December 30, 2016,  Wasn\u2019t @FoxNews, it was @BreitbartNews that made it up. That outlet has had zero credibility sonce their namesake died. https:  .   \u2014   Benjamin Allbright (@AllbrightNFL) December 30, 2016,  wait @FoxNews just invented a USDA report that doesn\u2019t exist to claim food stamp fraud is at an   high? https:  .  pic. twitter.   \u2014   Jesse Lehrich (@JesseLehrich) December 30, 2016,  So made up Breitbart nonsense gets sent to Fox News and it comes out of @HuntsmanAbby\u2019s mouth?
