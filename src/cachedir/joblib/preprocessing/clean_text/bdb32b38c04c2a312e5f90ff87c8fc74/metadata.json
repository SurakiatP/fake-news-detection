This weekend, \u201cMany Rivers to Cross,\u201d a   \u201cmusic, art and justice\u201d festival in the Atlanta area focuses on three issues: voting, mass incarceration, and the relationship between community and law enforcement. The lineup features an array of genres and musical styles: John Legend Carlos Santana Goapele Dave Matthews and Tip Harris, better known as the rapper T. I. are scheduled to take the stage, alongside Chris Rock, the poet Sonia Sanchez, the actor Jesse Williams and the activist Umi Selah of the Dream Defenders. The event will raise money for Sankofa. org, a social justice organization founded by Mr. Belafonte that unites   organizations and artists in the fight against problems like income disparity and inequities in the justice system. \u201cWhat makes a movement work are thousands of parts that come together and express itself in favor of a given destination or objective,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to find men and women who are willing to play the role that each of these things demand. \u201d With Election Day nearing in what has been a contentious presidential race exposing deep ideological divides, registration services will be available to help attendees ahead of nationwide deadlines. \u201cThe vote is perhaps the single most important weapon in our arsenal,\u201d Mr. Belafonte said. An area called the social justice village will feature representatives from over 40 organizations. The goal is to allow festivalgoers to \u201cwalk away with tools to better go out and support the causes they care about,\u201d said Gina Belafonte, who helped organize the event with her father. Mr. Belafonte said, \u201cWhen Trayvon Martin was shot and our community went into a response to that, there was no question in my mind that America was being awakened to its reality. \u201d Thinking back to the 1950s and \u201960s, when he toiled alongside activists including Dr. King, Julian Bond and Fannie Lou Hamer, Mr. Belafonte recalled how Dr. King represented a \u201charvest of opportunity. \u201d He added: \u201cThe energy that went into the movement disappeared because people were reaping the benefits. We\u2019ve forgotten what the opportunity was about. \u201d In 2012, a brouhaha ensued after Mr. Belafonte asserted that today\u2019s celebrities have \u201cturned their back on social responsibility\u201d and mentioned Jay Z and Beyonc\u00e9. Jay Z responded in an interview with Rap Radar\u2019s Elliott Wilson by saying among other things, \u201cmy presence is charity. \u201d Mr. Belafonte said that he extended an olive branch and that he and Jay Z met one on one. But Mr. Belafonte fervently maintains that artists must do more to champion causes. \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence that artists are of the same passion and of the same kind of commitment of the artists of my time,\u201d he said. \u201cThe absence of black artists is felt very strongly because the most visible oppression is in the black community. \u201d Mr. Belafonte provides counsel to celebrities and organizations, saying that he draws parallels between the roadblocks and successes of the \u201950s and \u201960s and those of the present political movements. Linda Sarsour, the executive director of the Arab American Association of New York, said conversations with Mr. Belafonte had proved critical. \u201cMr. B plays no games with us,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen he doesn\u2019t think we\u2019re doing the right thing, he tells us. He said, \u2018Look, you need the wisdom of your elders, but we need your energy right now. \u2019\u201d T. I. who will perform at \u201cMany Rivers to Cross\u201d on Saturday, said he felt compelled to take action his latest EP, \u201cUs or Else,\u201d addresses interactions between law enforcement and blacks, among other issues, and part of its proceeds benefit Sankofa. org. \u201cIt just seemed all too consistent, all too repeated, all too ignored,\u201d he said of police killings of black people. In the widely viewed video for the song \u201cWarzone,\u201d which he plans to perform at the festival, he spotlights the cases of Eric Garner, Tamir Rice and Philando Castile. \u201cIt was very insightful to hear from someone who had been through so much and been a part of history in so many ways,\u201d he said of his meeting with Mr. Belafonte. With his 90th birthday on his mind, Mr. Belafonte paused to take stock. \u201cI wake up at the age of 90, and I look around and say, \u2018What do we need now? \u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWell, the same things needed now are the same things needed before,\u201d he went on. \u201cMovements don\u2019t die because struggle doesn\u2019t die. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564506.0189466}
