Al Franken ( ) said Attorney General Jeff Sessions should return and tell the Senate Judiciary Committee why he said something \u201cthat just wasn\u2019t true,\u201d regarding his meeting with the Russian ambassador.  Franken said, \u201cI called for him to recuse himself before this incident. I hadn\u2019t called for him to resign. But, he needs to answer some questions. For example, he said at his press conference, that if he had just thought about it for a moment, had taken his time, he would have said that he had met twice with the Russian ambassador. He had seven weeks to say that. He was testifying under oath to the American people. and, he said something that just wasn\u2019t true. \u201d He added, \u201cI would like to give him some benefit of the doubt. He needs to come back before the committee and explain this. It doesn\u2019t make any sense. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742564298.4567943}
