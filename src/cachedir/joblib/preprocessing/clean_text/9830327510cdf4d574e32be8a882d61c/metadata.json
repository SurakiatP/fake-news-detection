Brad Sherman ( ) joined a fledgling effort to impeach President Donald Trump on Wednesday  \u2014   even before former FBI director James Comey was set to testify on Capitol Hill on Thursday. [\u201cThe standard for \u2018high crimes and misdemeanors\u2019 has been met,\u201d Sherman declared to reporters, according to The Hill. He did not explain, apparently, what crimes Trump had actually committed.  In fact, Sherman seemed to admit that the evidence against Trump was flimsy: \u201cIf articles of impeachment based on obstruction of justice were on the floor of the House today, they would not succeed,\u201d he told The Hill. Nevertheless, he said, he planned to draft one article of impeachment to   a process that he said would accelerate over time. Sherman is working with Rep. Al Green ( ) who is also submitting articles of impeachment to the House. Another California Democrat who has led calls for Trump\u2019s impeachment is Rep. Maxine Waters ( ). Waters was spotted in the business class section of a flight from Los Angeles to Dulles International Airport on Tuesday evening, but declined to be interviewed by Breitbart News. Last year, Sherman found himself in trouble after he appeared to endorse a coup attempt against Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. \u201cMilitary takeover in Turkey will hopefully lead to real democracy  \u2014   not Erdogan Authoritarianism,\u201d he tweeted at the time. As the coup effort faltered, Sherman had to scramble to explain himself. Evidently, Sherman hopes his prospects for removing a president from power will be brighter this time. However, Comey is not expected to offer any evidence that Trump tried to obstruct justice. In fact, a written version of his prepared remarks indicates that Comey will corroborate Trump\u2019s claim that he told the president he was not under FBI investigation. Comey is also expected to describe his discomfort with being asked for his \u201cloyalty\u201d by the president. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.
