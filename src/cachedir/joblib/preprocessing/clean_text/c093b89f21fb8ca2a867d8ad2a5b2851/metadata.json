He alleges they sent a fake possible donor, named Charles Roth III, to speak with members of Americans United for Change (AUFC), another organization working with the Clinton campaign, to see how they would go about helping a \u201cdonor\u201d who wanted to stop Donald Trump from winning the presidency. \\n\u201cRoth\u201d spoke to Creamer about donating $20,000, and also inquired about how to affect Trump campaign events. \\nAccording to Creamer, who responded to Roth: \u201cNow, Trump events is fine and frankly I spent most of my time overseeing the Trump events around the country. I mean that\u2019s what I do, that\u2019s what I do for the Clinton campaign\u2026so that\u2019s interesting as well.\u201d \\nCreamer then instructed Roth to send a check to AUFC \u2014 the group that O\u2019Keefe reported Creamer was a general consultant for. Creamer admitted that he was a consultant for AUFC, but conveniently, after the first two Project Veritas videos were releaed, Creamer\u2019s name was scrubbed from their site. \\nProject Veritas dug even deeper into the corruption after AUFC confirmed that they got the $20,000 donation check from Roth via the offshore Belize account. To do so, Project Veritas sent another undercover journalist to intern with Democracy Partners and work with Creamer. \\nScott Foval, who we met in the previous \u201cRigged Election\u201d series videos, is now the former national field director for AUFC and spoke to who he believed was a representative for Roth: \u201cIf he wants to get dirty, we can get dirty.\u201d \\nMuch more was unearthed in the video \u2014 including Cesar Vargas, an illegal alien and founder of the Dream Action Coalition \u2014 who talked about conducting voter fraud in a meeting with Foval. \\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the goal of the campaign right,\u201d Vargas asked and added, \u201cYeah and for me I totally get it, this is illegal, this is something that can be done.\u201d \\nProject Veritas created a fictitious \u201cmoney man\u201d for Roth named Michael Carlson to see what these Democrat operatives would do with the promise of more money dangled in front of them. Creamer spoke to Carlson on the phone about a fictitious, wealthy client living in Syria that wanted to come to the U.S. Creamer told Carlson: \\nI just need to, I will try and find a couple of good referrals to you and get back to you pretty quick then. Okay? On the first\u2026Well, I\u2019ll just talk to\u2026the guy I\u2019m going to talk to first, to see if this is up his alley, the first thing is up his alley. It\u2019s the guy who ran the campaign for President Obama. He has a firm that\u2019s pretty well connected. \\nNow, where did the $20,000 go? MRC-TV reported: \\nThe shocker of why the $20,000 was mysteriously returned led back to the direction of Woodhouse [AUFC President Brad Woodhouse]. O\u2019Keefe claims that once Woodhouse learned of the future release of the undercover videos, the money was wire returned back to the offshore account in Belize with Woodhouse claiming suspicion of a foreign donation. \\nMake sure to watch the entire Project Veritas video so you can see the corruption for yourself \u2014 including a pay-to-pay situation involving Creamer who was caught admitting that a donation could buy a meeting with Clinton.'"}, "time": 1742564332.189122}
