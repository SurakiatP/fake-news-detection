Lesson learned about my stupidity.\u201d \\nIt\u2019s difficult to say whether Dougherty apologized because he didn\u2019t do it and had made a stupid joke or if he was simply trying to avoid being prosecuted. \\nAlthough we can\u2019t tell for sure right now what\u2019s true here, Dougherty\u2019s comments at the very least are a reminder of how important voter ID laws are. \\nIf everyone were required to present identification to vote, Dougherty wouldn\u2019t have made his \u201cjoke\u201d about how easy it was to commit voter fraud \u2014 and if he actually tried to do what he boasted about on Facebook, voter ID laws would stop such a thing. \\nFor all we know, Dougherty may not even be a Clinton supporter; he could have been trying to make a point about voter fraud and the dirty tricks committed by Democrats. Doubtful, but who knows? \\nNo matter what his party affiliation or whether or not he actually did what he boasted about, he intentionally or not made the case for strong voter ID laws. \\nShare this post on Facebook and Twitter so people can see how this man showed the importance of voter ID laws.
