But the occasionally stodgy Emmys, which sometimes latch on to winners (like Ms.  ) and stay with them, was also infused with new blood. Popular shows like \u201cThe People v. O. J. Simpson,\u201d \u201cRoots\u2019\u2019 and \u201cFargo\u201d drew attention to the limited series category, James Corden emerged as a force in the   competition, and there was recognition in the best drama category for the widely praised but previously overlooked \u201cThe Americans. \u201d \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d HBO\u2019s fantasy epic, will again be the leader of the pack heading into the awards. The drama, which just completed its sixth season, received 23 nominations, the highest total for any show. The show received 24 nominations last year and won its first best drama Emmy. [ List: Nominations for the 2016 Emmy Awards ] HBO, which is coming off its biggest Emmy haul ever last year, had a total of 94 nominations, the highest of any network for the 16th consecutive year. FX\u2019s   limited series \u201cThe People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story\u201d and its anthology series \u201cFargo\u201d were the   and   nominated shows. FX finished behind HBO in nominations with 56. The streaming services Netflix and Amazon continue to make significant inroads, with each scoring its highest Emmy nomination totals (54 for Netflix and 16 for Amazon). The Emmys reflect an infusion of talent into television at a time when movie stars are increasingly turning to TV, especially in limited series, and there are more scripted shows than ever before. Over the past few months, networks have been ferociously competing against one another in nomination campaigns. The broadcast networks are still experiencing a diminished presence at the Emmys, with three of the networks  \u2014   ABC, Fox and CBS  \u2014   notching fewer nominations than in 2015. NBC had the same total, with 41. And for the fifth consecutive year, the networks were shut out of nominations for best drama. In that category, \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d will compete against the final season of the PBS show \u201cDownton Abbey,\u201d USA\u2019s \u201cMr. Robot,\u201d AMC\u2019s \u201cBetter Call Saul,\u201d Netflix\u2019s \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d FX\u2019s \u201cThe Americans\u201d and Showtime\u2019s \u201cHomeland. \u201d \u201cMr. Robot,\u201d which won the Golden Globe for best drama in January, is a new entrant in the category, along with \u201cThe Americans. \u201d They replace \u201cMad Men,\u201d which ended last year, and Netflix\u2019s \u201cOrange Is the New Black. \u201d HBO\u2019s \u201cVeep,\u201d which last year ended the   winning streak of ABC\u2019s \u201cModern Family\u2019\u2019 in the best comedy category, was once again nominated for that award. It will go up against \u201cModern Family\u201d again, along with Netflix\u2019s \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,\u201d Amazon\u2019s \u201cTransparent,\u201d HBO\u2019s \u201cSilicon Valley,\u201d ABC\u2019s \u201c \u201d and Netflix\u2019s \u201cMaster of None. \u201d With Jon Hamm\u2019s Don Draper from \u201cMad Men\u201d out of the race, the best actor category for drama has no clear  . Two previous Emmy winners, Kyle Chandler (\u201cBloodline\u201d) and Bob Odenkirk (\u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d) will compete against Kevin Spacey (\u201cHouse of Cards\u201d) Liev Schreiber (\u201cRay Donovan\u201d) Matthew Rhys (\u201cThe Americans\u201d) and Rami Malek (\u201cMr. Robot\u201d) all of whom are looking for their first Emmy. Viola Davis, who last year became the first   woman to win a best acting Emmy in the drama category, will try to repeat, for her performance in \u201cHow to Get Away With Murder. \u201d She is up against Robin Wright (\u201cHouse of Cards\u201d) Keri Russell (\u201cThe Americans\u201d) Tatiana Maslany (\u201cOrphan Black\u201d) Claire Danes (\u201cHomeland\u201d) and Taraji P. Henson (\u201cEmpire\u201d). Ms. Russell is the only new actress in the category, and this represents her first Emmy nomination. FX\u2019s Emmy haul was propelled by \u201cThe People v. O. J. Simpson,\u201d \u201cFargo\u201d and \u201cThe Americans. \u201d \u201cThe People v. O. J. Simpson\u201d received a whopping six nominations in the limited series acting categories, including one for Sarah Paulson, who was also nominated for her role in FX\u2019s \u201cAmerican Horror Story: Hotel. \u201d Ms. Paulson, who portrayed the prosecutor Marcia Clark in \u201cThe People v. O. J. Simpson,\u201d said in an interview that she shot both roles at the same time and that she was \u201crunning on fumes, just as Marcia was. \u201d She added, \u201cI used all of my exhaustion to my benefit since no one was more tired during that trial than Marcia Clark. \u201d Another standout on Thursday was   Emmy winner Laurie Metcalf, who was nominated for three awards: for best actress in a comedy series for HBO\u2019s \u201cGetting On\u201d and for guest appearances in \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d and \u201cHorace and Pete. \u201d Netflix had a strong day, with nominations in both the lead drama and comedy categories and in several acting categories. With 54 nominations, Netflix has 20 more than it received last year, its previous record. \u201cMaking a Murderer,\u201d the popular Netflix documentary, was nominated for six awards, including best documentary series. This is the first year that Netflix eclipsed each of the broadcast networks. Amazon was led by its comedy \u201cTransparent,\u201d which had 10 nominations. Last year, the show\u2019s star, Jeffrey Tambor, won the best actor award, the first time a streaming service had won a lead acting Emmy. For the first time in 16 years, \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d was not nominated in the best variety show category, a blow to its rookie host, Trevor Noah. Likewise, Stephen Colbert\u2019s \u201cThe Late Show\u201d was snubbed, while Mr. Corden\u2019s \u201cThe Late Late Show\u201d was honored instead. The nomination will add fuel to the discussion that Mr. Corden is outshining his more experienced CBS colleague. Rounding out the category were HBO\u2019s John Oliver, ABC\u2019s Jimmy Kimmel, HBO\u2019s Bill Maher, NBC\u2019s Jimmy Fallon and Crackle\u2019s \u201cComedians in Cars Getting Coffee\u201d with Jerry Seinfeld. Unlike the Academy Awards, which have overhauled the membership ranks following controversy over its   slate of acting nominees, the Emmys have a relatively diverse lineup, with a number of actors of color receiving nominations. Last year, the Emmys made changes to the voting process, opening up the best drama and comedy categories to all Television Academy voters, not just a committee. \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d which has never been more popular, has probably been a beneficiary to the rules change. In the comedy acting categories, Ms.   is up again for her performance in \u201cVeep. \u201d She has won the award four years in a row (and has seven Emmys over all). She will be competing against Ms. Metcalf, Amy Schumer (\u201cInside Amy Schumer\u201d) Lily Tomlin (\u201cGrace and Frankie\u201d) Tracee Ellis Ross (\u201c \u201d) and Ellie Kemper (\u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u201d). Mr. Tambor will be up against Anthony Anderson (\u201c \u201d) Aziz Ansari (\u201cMaster of None\u201d) Will Forte (\u201cThe Last Man on Earth\u201d) William H. Macy (\u201cShameless\u201d) and Thomas Middleditch (\u201cSilcon Valley\u201d). Though television has never been more celebrated as an art form, drawing a sizable audience for the Emmys remains something of a challenge: Last year\u2019s show was its lowest rated ever.  The Emmys will be hosted this year by Mr. Kimmel and will be broadcast on Sept. 18 on ABC.'"}, "time": 1742564504.0917673}
