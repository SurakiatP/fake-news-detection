Now we were all interested in what they think, but that is irrelevant to the case. The case was, does the president have the authority to do it? And if he does, it\u2019s his judgment to make. And that\u2019s the plain reading of the law. It\u2019s he plain understanding of the Constitution. I think the policy was unwise, but that\u2019s irrelevant. I think it\u2019s very clearly legal. \u201d He added that the order\u2019s chances at the Supreme Court isn\u2019t a \u201cslam dunk,\u201d and could end up a   where the 9th Circuit\u2019s ruling is upheld. Krauthammer further stated that he thought the government\u2019s arguments in front of the court were \u201cexceedingly weak. \u201d And the administration wasn\u2019t prepared to defend the case in court.
