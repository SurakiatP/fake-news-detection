All you had to do is turn the page and find Democratic members of Congress who had also received the letter from the FBI. But it shows how ready Clinton is to fight anyone in the government who dares investigate or question her. It is likely a habit Clinton picked up when she was first lady, from 1993 to 2001. \\nClinton\u2019s opening salvo, though weak, is a sign of more to come. Her coming attack on the FBI and its director, James Comey, will likely begin in earnest on Monday, with her operatives using the letter to Congress as proof Clinton is the victim of a political conspiracy. \\nClinton previewed her attack in Daytona Beach, Florida, on Saturday, when she said the letter was \u201cunprecedented and deeply troubling.\u201d \\nClinton will also turn the issue into one of \u201ctransparency\u201d \u2014 even though FBI investigations are inherently not transparent. In Daytona, she called on Comey to \u201cexplain everything right away, put it all right on the table\u201d \u2014 a demand she knows will go unheeded. \\nBut many of Clinton\u2019s allies in the media are likely to demand to see the emails found on former Rep. Anthony Weiner\u2019s laptop. \\nIt\u2019s a strategy that could work, even with only a few days left until Election Day. \\nSuch attacks on law enforcement worked fairly well for Clinton in 1998, when she and her husband, then-President Bill Clinton, vilified independent counsel Kenneth Starr. Starr had been tasked by Bill Clinton\u2019s own attorney general to investigate corruption charges, but likely rued the day he ever took the job. \\nIn 1994, Bill Clinton faced questions from many, including The New York Times, about an investment the Clintons made in a company called Whitewater Development Corp. Bill Clinton\u2019s attorney general, Janet Reno, made Robert Fiske the independent counsel. \\nFiske would later be replaced by Starr. Starr\u2019s investigation would later reach into charges that President Clinton had lied in the Paula Jones sexual harassment civil trial. With explosive charges being published by the Drudge Report and Newsweek in January 1998 that Bill Clinton had seduced an intern, Monica Lewinsky, the Clintons could have been expected to admit the truth and take the punishments. \\nInstead, the Clinton White House and the Democrats began attacking Starr and the Republicans. \\nOn Jan. 27, 1998, Hillary Clinton went on NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Today Show\u201d and goaded the press into covering the opposition rather than President Bill Clinton, who had lied about his affair with Lewinsky just one day earlier. \\nMatt Lauer asked if Hillary Clinton had said the fight against Starr would be the \u201clast great battle\u201d of the Clinton White House. \\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve been that dramatic,\u201d Hillary Clinton replied. \u201cBut I do believe that this is a battle. I mean, look at the very people who are involved in this \u2014 they have popped up in other settings. This is \u2014 the great story here for anybody willing to find it and write about it and explain it is this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president.\u201d \\nThe Starr report on the Clinton scandals was released months later. But what the Clintons are really proud of that is that the Democrats actually gained seats in the 1998 midterm elections, helping to cause a backfire against the GOP. \\nThe GOP didn\u2019t have anywhere near the two-thirds majority in the Senate to remove Bill Clinton. In early 1999, the U.S. Senate acquitted Bill Clinton on two charges: obstruction of justice, and perjury. \\nIt taught the Clintons the wrong lesson: to fight authorities if authorities questioned them \u2014 even authorities within the Democratic Party. Clinton will be targeting and attacking President Obama\u2019s own FBI director as Obama leaves office.'"}, "time": 1742561996.6945941}
