And she came home one day horrified to discover that her mother and stepfather had festooned their house in Hollywood with Richard Nixon paraphernalia. Cher purged it all. First she ripped the Nixon yard signs out of their front lawn. And after her mother fished them out of the garbage and put them back up, Cher found a more permanent solution. \u201cI took them to my girlfriend\u2019s house, and we threw them in her trash,\u201d she told me by phone from California the other day, the mischievousness and pride still in her voice after all those years. But the signs weren\u2019t all she got her hands on. \u201cAlso threw out those hideous straw hats with Nixon on them,\u201d she said.   years later, that is more or less her approach to Donald J. Trump: trash and destroy. These days she wages her battles against the Republican Party not from her lawn  \u2014   it\u2019s in Malibu now  \u2014   but on her Twitter feed, which she acknowledges is not exactly a model of  . \u201cIf you looked at my tweets, you\u2019d think, \u2018She\u2019s crazy,\u2019\u201d she said. (That \u201ccraziness\u201d has attracted, at last count, 3. 1 million followers.) In many ways, Cher is the perfect political counterpart to Mr. Trump. Like him, she has always been defiantly indifferent toward her critics. Also like Mr. Trump, no one holds her to the rigid standards of campaign conduct, giving her license to say what she wants without all the consequences. Imagine for a minute that another septuagenarian supporter of Hillary Clinton like Madeleine Albright tweeted    pictures of John Gotti and Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump\u2019s recently departed campaign chairman, and offered this critique: \u201cFYI.. Manafort  \u2026    John Gotti called. .he wants his look back! !\u201d If there was ever a presidential election perfect for a Cher moment, this is it. Personality, outrage and a     insult are the political currency of 2016. She has earned a reputation as one of the more effective and entertaining Trump neutralizers on Twitter, largely because she can go    with him both in the sheer volume of tweets she fires off (19, 000 and counting) and in her lacerating,   style. She often won\u2019t refer to Mr. Trump by name, for example, but with the toilet emoji. (And that is one of her few jokes that is printable here.) Now she is getting marquee billing on the campaign trail. The Clinton campaign realized the weapon it had at its disposal and reasoned that Cher would be a hit at    \u2014   especially those with a larger than average guest list of gay men. She headlined three of them last month, in Miami\u2019s Wynwood neighborhood, Fire Island and Provincetown, Mass. \u201cI\u2019m such an obvious person,\u201d she told me, \u201cto bring that message to, as I call them, my people. \u201d After one guest at the Provincetown event uploaded to Facebook a video of her introducing Mrs. Clinton  \u2014   a profane   of insult comedy, political commentary and world history  \u2014   it went viral. \u201cI think the one thing that I am,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m honest. And I say what I think. \u201d She is   enough to know her impetuousness may cause trouble for her and Mrs. Clinton. That is why she sheepishly acknowledged, \u201cI\u2019m trying not to use any bad words. \u201d Public speaking, she insisted, does not come naturally to her. But anyone who has watched her eulogy to her former husband Sonny Bono has seen that she has a gift for moving audiences. I told her this when we had our first phone call because she wouldn\u2019t let me start the interview until I submitted to a minor grilling. \u201cI have to ask you a question,\u201d she said before I could get a word out. \u201cBecause most people think that if you\u2019re famous that you don\u2019t deserve an opinion. And so why are you calling me?\u201d I\u2019ve followed her career, the farewells, the reinventions, the public degradation and adulation, for quite a while. When I was in seventh grade, my performance in the talent show was to   Sonny and Cher\u2019s \u201cI Got You Babe. \u201d I was Cher, dressed in a   black wig and a pair of my mom\u2019s old bell bottoms. I always thought Cher had a unique voice, and in more than just song. There was the time in 2003 when she called in to  \u2019s Washington Journal to describe how heartbroken and outraged she was after visiting wounded soldiers at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. After the host tried to press this anonymous caller from Miami Beach about her identity  \u2014   \u201can entertainer\u201d was all Cher would volunteer  \u2014   her cover was blown. \u201cIs this Cher?\u201d the host asked, sounding stunned. She called in to the show again in 2006. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand how this government can send men into war without the proper helmets,\u201d she said, this time as an anonymous caller from Malibu. Again, the host figured it out. \u201cAnd is this Cher?\u201d To pigeonhole her as a Hollywood liberal misses some of the nuance of her politics. She voted for Ross Perot in 1992, which she announced to Larry King on CNN  \u2014   once again dialing in but this time not shrouded in anonymity. \u201cI was really nervous, I was really frightened, but my conscience is clear,\u201d she told Mr. Perot, who was a guest of Mr. King\u2019s that night. She told me she was so strongly moved to oppose Mr. Trump not solely because of his politics but because she felt he was dangerously misguided and intemperate. Ronald Reagan, she said, was a Republican she disagreed with politically but did not fear personally. \u201cHe did nothing for AIDS, and he just stood back when people were dying,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there were things that you could say, \u2018He makes a good president\u2019  \u2014   for some people. But I wasn\u2019t frightened really that he could bring the country to his knees because he knew nothing about how to govern. \u201d She says she is no fan of the government and has little confidence it can solve the employment problems that come with a rapidly changing economy, which she blames on cold, impersonal decisions made by   chief executives. \u201cIt\u2019s criminal what\u2019s happened to these people who had great jobs in Detroit, who worked in steel in Pittsburgh,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost respect for everything that doesn\u2019t make money. \u201d Or for jobs that don\u2019t require   college degrees, she added: \u201cThe janitor at my school, we called him \u2018Mr. \u2019\u201d Politics have been at the periphery of Cher\u2019s life since the 1960s. Her first husband would become one of the country\u2019s most famous Republicans: Mr. Bono, who was the mayor of Palm Springs and a congressman for two terms until he died in a skiing accident in 1998. \u201cWhen Sonny and I were married, he was a Democrat,\u201d she said, recalling how thrilled he sounded after returning from the 1968 Democratic National Convention. \u201cHe said, \u2018Oh my God, Cher, I met this amazing guy McGovern,\u2019\u201d meaning George McGovern, the former senator from South Dakota, who ran for the Democratic nomination that year and lost. Her second husband, Gregg Allman of the Allman Brothers, helped raise money for Jimmy Carter. The Allman Brothers, which had roots in Georgia, would play concerts for Mr. Carter during the 1976 presidential campaign. And after Mr. Carter won, he invited the couple to the White House for a reception for supporters. Cher did not expect much more than a tour that night. But she said that as she was downstairs in the White House basement looking at Mary Todd Lincoln\u2019s china collection, Amy Carter, the president\u2019s daughter, summoned her: \u201cAmy came down and said, \u2018Mama wants you to have dinner. \u2019\u201d I wondered, did she ever want to get in the game and run for office? \u201cNot even for a hot second,\u201d she assured me. She could never live with herself, she said, if she had to hold her tongue. \u201cIt would ruin me as a person. \u201d In 1988, Cher publicly backed Michael Dukakis, who was not the only Dukakis she got to know. That year, she won an Oscar for her lead role in \u201cMoonstruck. \u201d Starring as Cher\u2019s mother in the film was Olympia Dukakis, Mr. Dukakis\u2019s cousin. Cher\u2019s support for Mrs. Clinton started with her Senate campaign and, later, in 2008 with her unsuccessful bid for the Democratic presidential nomination against Barack Obama. The similarities between the two women struck me as something that must have affected Cher. They are just a few years apart in age. Cher is 70. Mrs. Clinton is 68. They both triumphed in   professions and faced their own career humiliations and rebirths. But when I asked her about it, she wouldn\u2019t hear it. \u201cI have to stop you right there,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fact that she\u2019s a woman does not  \u2014   I don\u2019t care. \u201d When she was a child, she said, the idea of a female president was so foreign to the way she saw politics that she thought electing a woman might even be against the law. \u201cI\u2019m so blessed to be alive to see a woman president,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m so angry at the fact that I feel blessed  \u2014   that it\u2019s not something that\u2019s natural. \u201d Her reasons for feeling so strongly about Mr. Trump, she said, are maternal: \u201cI know that women can look into the future, the future for their children. \u201d \u201cAnd even if they don\u2019t like Hillary, and many women don\u2019t,\u201d she added, they have to think to themselves \u201cbut I don\u2019t want to risk my children\u2019s future to this guy. \u201d Despite running in overlapping social circles for years  \u2014   she and Mr. Trump were regulars in Aspen, Colo.  \u2014   Cher said she has never met this man she has such disdain for. She said she would occasionally see him at Mezzaluna, a hot spot in Aspen that they both frequented. That cemented her opinion early on. \u201cI just thought, \u2018What an.   \u2026    \u201d She stopped herself. She is trying not to use bad words anymore.'"}, "time": 1742628448.4260402}
