Francis-Fourkiller was released after spending two days in jail, but her family says she was just an innocent observer in the clashes between militarized law enforcement and Native American activists, or \u201cwater protectors.\u201d \\nAccording to local news affiliate News On 6 : \\n\u201cFamily members of Caddo Nation chairwoman Tamara Francis-Fourkiller said an anonymous donor paid $2.5 million late Saturday afternoon to release everyone arrested on Thursday at the Dakota Access Pipeline site. They said, however, that Francis-Fourkiller should not have been arrested in the first place.\u201d \\nThough the donor who sent the $2.5 million remains anonymous, it appears the person is connected to the Caddo Nation tribe in some way . \\nThe anonymous donation is welcome news to those arrested in the mass crackdown last Thursday, however, Standing Rock is still raising legal defense funds for future arrests \u2014 which are all but guaranteed to happen.
