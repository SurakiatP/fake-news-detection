Anyone who questions this \u2018group think\u2019 is immediately labeled a \u2018tool of Putin\u2019 or worse.\u201d MSNBC host Rachel Maddow. \\nDr. Doctorow has launched an important conversation in light of the release of yet another alarmist media report , this time by a British neoconservative group named (oddly) after a long deceased Democratic Senator from Washington State (Henry \u201cScoop\u201d Jackson), which seeks to stifle debate on Russia policy in the West by smearing dissenters from the Russia-bashing conventional wisdom as \u201cPutin\u2019s useful idiots.\u201d \\nDoctorow\u2019s experience with the Russian media therefore serves a double use: to combat willful Western misconceptions of the Russian media landscape as well as to serve as a useful point of comparison with U.S. media outlets and their coverage of Russia. \\nIf we take the example of the purportedly liberal cable news outlet MSNBC, we find, paradoxically, that the hard-right neoconservative stance toward Russia goes virtually unopposed. Regarding Russia, in comparison with their principal center-left cable news rival CNN, which, to its credit occasionally makes room for the minority \u201cdetente\u201d point of view, MSNBC leaves about as much room for dissent as the Soviet-era Pravda \u2013 actually, perhaps less. \\nNew McCarthyism \\nAs it happens, there was a similar disparity when it came to the way the two networks covered the U.S. presidential election. While CNN went about bringing much needed balance to its coverage, albeit in the most inept way possible \u2013 by hiring paid flacks from each of the campaigns to appear alongside actual journalists, MSNBC (like Republican rival FOX News) wholly dispensed with any pretense of objectivity and served as little more than as a mouth piece for the disastrous Clinton campaign. Sen. Joseph McCarthy, R-Wisconsin, who led the \u201cRed Scare\u201d hearings of the 1950s. \\nAs such, the \u201cliberal\u201d network found itself in the vanguard of the new McCarthyism which swept the 2016 campaign, but which has, in fact, been a feature of the American debate over Russia policy since at least the beginning of the Ukraine crisis in late 2013 \u2013 if not earlier. \\nExamples abound, but perhaps the most striking case of the neo-McCarthyite hysteria which MSNBC attempted to dress up as its legitimate concern over U.S. national security was a rant that Rachel Maddow unleashed on her audience in June when Maddow opened her show with a monologue dedicated to the proposition that Donald Trump was in league with Vladimir Putin. \\nMaddow, in her signature smarter-than-thou tone, informed readers that the \u201cadmiration\u201d between Putin and Trump \u201creally is mutual. I mean, look at this headline, \u2018Putin praises Trump. He`s brilliant and talented person.\u2019 \u2018Putin praises bright and talented Trump.\u2019 \u2018Vladimir Putin praises outstanding and talented Trump.\u2019 There was some controversy over how to exactly translate Putin`s remarks, but Putin took care to flatter Donald Trump publicly, exactly the way Donald Trump likes to be flattered, and that`s apparently enough for Donald Trump, that`s all he needs to hear, that`s all he needs to know, to tell him, how great Vladimir Putin is. \\n\u201cPutin likes Trump, he must be smart, must be great. So, that is the very, very unusual context here, that you have a Republican presidential nominee who is very, very susceptible to flattery. It`s the most powerful thing in the world to him. If you compliment him, he will never forget it and that`s kind of all he needs to know about you.\u201d \\nMaddow went on in this vein for quite a while longer (meaning: little actual content but lots of \u201cvery, very\u2019s\u201d and eye-rolling). But her central insight, such as it was, was little more than a regurgitation of Democratic National Committee talking points. To no one\u2019s surprise, Maddow\u2019s accusations were repeated almost verbatim in the press releases issued by the Clinton campaign which accused Trump of being little more than a Russian fifth columnist. \\nMaddow\u2019s evidence-free, innuendo laden June rant took on an added importance because she was the messenger. After the risible, self-important sports journalist Keith Olbermann left the network in 2011, Maddow took over as the network\u2019s house intellectual. So her words carry weight with its viewers in a way, say, Mika Brzezinki\u2019s do not. \\nNevertheless at no point at which I am aware did Maddow ever host a guest who pushed back against the still unproven charges that the Russian government had interfered in the U.S. election or that Donald Trump was, in the words of former CIA functionary Mike Morell, an \u201cunwitting agent of the Kremlin\u201d \u2013 never mind that as recently as Nov. 15, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker admitted he had \u201cno proof\u201d of Moscow\u2019s interference in the U.S. election. \\nWhile it is unclear whether MSNBC\u2019s Joy Reid is seen as \u201cserious\u201d a voice as Maddow, it is unquestionable that she has emerged as the network\u2019s most enthusiastic practitioner of the new McCarthyism. \\nDays before the election Reid hosted Newsweek\u2019s increasingly unhinged Kurt Eichenwald and former Naval officer Malcolm Nance who has repeatedly and without evidence claimed the Wikileaks-Podesta emails were fake. \\nWhy, asked Reid, are the Russians backing Trump? As if that assertion was beyond dispute. Well, said Eichenwald, \u201cThey hate Hillary Clinton\u2026\u201d Oh. Reid then went on to wonder why the FBI is down-playing the intelligence community\u2019s allegedly deep concern that Russia was interfering in the election. \\nPutin-Bashing \\nDays later, right after the election, Reid re-assembled a panel featuring Nance, the reliable Putin critic Nina Khrushcheva and Esquire\u2019s Charles Pierce to reinforce the message that MSNBC had been pushing since the summer: that the Russian government had its hand on the scale of the U.S. election. Pierce, in particular, was apoplectic. Russian President Vladimir Putin. (Russian government photo) \\nThat Reid\u2019s roundtable featured Pierce made a good deal of sense. Throughout the campaign, Pierce has been determined to draw a direct link between the Trump campaign and Putin. A sample of his output helps tell the tale. On July 24, Pierce published \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s and Vladimir Putin\u2019s Shared Agenda Should Alarm Anyone Concerned About Democracy\u201d in which Pierce speculated that \u201cTrump seems increasingly dependent on money from Russia and from the former Soviet republics within its increasingly active sphere of influence.\u201d \\nIn his offering of Sept. 9, Pierce protested that \u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018red-baiting\u2019 to be concerned about Russian interference in our elections.\u201d Pierce, perhaps moved to madness by The Nation editorial \u201cAgainst Neo-McCarthyism,\u201d sounded as though he were channeling the ghost of James Jesus Angleton, asking, \u201cAre we supposed to believe that Donald Trump really went on RT television by accident ? That nobody on his staff knew that the Russian government\u2019s American network picks up Larry King\u2019s podcast?\u201d \\nAbout a month before the election, on Oct. 11, Pierce informed readers of the once-great Esquire, \u201cVladimir Putin Is Determined to See Trump in the Oval Office.\u201d Still worse, according to Pierce, \u201c There is little question now that Vladimir Putin is playing monkey-mischief with the 2016 presidential election, and that the Trump campaign is the primary beneficiary of that.\u201d \\nAll of the aforementioned is to demonstrate that the American media\u2019s much touted pluralism is little more than a fiction when it comes to reporting on Russia. The diversity of Left-Right voices on the political spectrum that Doctorow has encountered in Moscow indicates that the widespread perception that Moscow\u2019s political culture is monolithic compared to that of the Washington\u2019s is, at the very least, challengeable. \\nJames W Carden is a contributing writer for The Nation and editor of The American Committee for East-West Accord\u2019s eastwestaccord.com.
