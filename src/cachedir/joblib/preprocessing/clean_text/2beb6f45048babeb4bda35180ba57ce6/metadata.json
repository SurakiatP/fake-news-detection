Corruption doesn\u2019t even begin to cover it if wealthy donors \u2013 and even foreign powers \u2013 can just write checks, contribute to the Clinton Foundation, etc. \u2013 and just buy a law in return\u2026 \\n\\nby Melissa Dykes, The Daily Sheeple via SHTFPlan : \\nEditor\u2019s Comment: Unaccountable power multiplies, but this is astounding. This is a very good example of the reasons that the founders sought to limit and check power. But of course, over the years, those protections have been whittled down, and the loopholes are big enough drive tanks through. Corruption doesn\u2019t even begin to cover it if wealthy donors \u2013 and even foreign powers \u2013 can just write checks, contribute to the Clinton Foundation, etc. \u2013 and just buy a law in return. \\nWhy is no one standing up to this tyranny? Critics have taken George W. Bush and Barack Obama to task for abusing their power to write executive orders \u2013 and legislate with a pen when they have no constitutional power to make law at all. But Hillary, before she even takes power, is already leaving these two in the dust. So everyone is just going to take it, along with the \u2018first female\u2019 t-shirts they will be sending out as promos in the mail? \\nAs MLK famously wrote from his Birmingham jail cell: \u201cAt first glance it may seem rather paradoxical for us consciously to break laws. One may well ask: \u201cHow can you advocate breaking some laws and obeying others?\u201d The answer lies in the fact that there are two types of laws: just and unjust. I would be the first to advocate obeying just laws. One has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws. I would agree with St. Augustine that \u201can unjust law is no law at all.\u201d \\nExecutive Orders for Sale? Leaked Email Shows Hillary Camp Answering Wealthy Donor\u2019s Questions about How Executive Orders Work \\nby Melissa Dykes \\nIf you already thought the Executive Order system falls somewhere between problematic and completely unconstitutional, this takes it to a whole new, never before seen level of corruption. \\nThanks to all the leaks, America now knows our government is essentially one giant pay-for-play operation. That\u2019s how it works. That\u2019s how the DNC works. That\u2019s how the Clinton Foundation works. \\nBut how far does that go? \\nHow about bypassing Congress entirely with money in the most literal sense possible. \\nThis leaked email chain hints at something that kind of makes votes and lobbyists and, well, all of it rather pointless. \\nIf someone\u2019s wealthy enough, can they straight up buy an executive order? \\nThese days, the president uses Executive Orders to bypass Congress, even though there is no constitutional provision that explicitly permits the use of executive orders. It\u2019s a system that\u2019s been heavily abused in the past but now, apparently, it\u2019s for sale . \\nA new revelation buried in the Wikileaks trove of tens of thousands of Hillary campaign chairman John Podesta\u2019s emails shows him discussing executive orders in relation to an \u201cidea\u201d a wealthy donor has. \\nIn a leaked email thread between Podesta and Mary Pat Bonner, a \u201cdonor adviser\u201d who gets millions for her elite connections in bringing in donors and for being what The New York Times describes as a \u201cmaster of making donors happy,\u201d it\u2019s all but admitted that Executive Orders are another pay-for-play item on the corrupt American political menu. \\nRead this from the bottom up: \\n(click to enlarge) \\nIn an email with the subject line, \u201cIs there someone in your shop,\u201d Bonner writes, \u201cWho totally understands \u2018executive orders\u2019. It is to answer a very big donors questions.\u201d \\nPodesta responds with simply, \u201cMe.\u201d \\nBonner: \u201cIt is for Michael King.\u201d \\nPodesta: \u201cWhat does he need?\u201d \\nBonner: \u201cHe has an idea and just need answer [sic] to a bunch of easy questions about how this works.\u201d \\nOh goody. Mega wealthy donor Michael King has an \u201cidea\u201d about executive orders\u2026 \\nThe Michael King they are likely referencing is rich TV mogul Michael King, the exec who inherited King World Productions later acquired by CBS. To give you an idea, King World Productions launched Harpo\u2019s The Oprah Winfrey Show and Dr. Phil\u2019s talk show. \\nBack in 2012, Bill Clinton teamed up with King on a pricey fundraiser for President Obama at King\u2019s Pacific Palisades estate where tickets ranged from general seating starting at $1,000 and went all the way up to $40,000 premium seats with meet-and-greets. \\nWhile on the campaign trail over a year out from the election, Hillary Clinton has already vowed she will use Executive Orders to pass gun control regulations, for example. \\nBased on this email thread, you have to wonder what other EOs Hillary plans to pass as president\u2026 and whose \u201cidea\u201d they are. \\nAnd how much that idea cost.
