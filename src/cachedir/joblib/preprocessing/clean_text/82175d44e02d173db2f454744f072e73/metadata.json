Rather said, \u201cIn terms of policy, including foreign policy, President Trump has been jumping around like a frog in a hot skillet. He\u2019s reversed himself on any number of things. He questioned NATO and now he\u2019s all in favor of NATO. He said the U. S. military is a disaster during the campaign now he\u2019s for the military. He questioned the Federal Reserve, now he is maybe reappointing the head of the Federal Reserve. There\u2019s a long list of these things. Chinese currency, first he said China is a currency manipulator. Now he says they aren\u2019t currency manipulators. There\u2019s a lot going on behind the scenes. This business of jumping around from place to place. Being unpredictable is sometimes helpful for a leader. But, if you are this unpredictable, you run the risk of running a dysfunctional presidency. That\u2019s what Donald Trump is battling at the moment. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742562566.2291858}
