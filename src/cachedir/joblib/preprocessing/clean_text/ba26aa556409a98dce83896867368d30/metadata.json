The next in the series is the artist Kehinde Wiley, who shares his list exclusively with T. \u201cGiovanni\u2019s Room,\u201d James Baldwin \u201cGiovanni\u2019s Room\u201d is one of my   favorites by Baldwin, a master of deconstructing the American character and social temperature during an era in which novels that explored race and queer love were few and far between, at best. \u201cThe Honor Code,\u201d Kwame Anthony Appiah Why did Chinese foot binding end? Or the western pistol duel, for that matter? \u201cThe Honor Code\u201d takes a stab at this history, revealing the importance of honor as an agent for major social and political change  \u2014   a salient point to make in this morally fraught time of rapid transformation. \u201cThe Book of Night Women,\u201d Marlon James More recently celebrated for his masterpiece \u201cA Brief History of Seven Killings,\u201d James has created in this   book a deeply personal view of Jamaican slavery. Set from a decidedly female perspective, \u201cThe Book of Night Women\u201d takes you into domestic spaces, seduces you into understanding the very real conflicts and emotions behind charged and savage sexual encounters between slaves and masters, and dissects the negotiations of power within those relationships. \u201cRegarding the Pain of Others,\u201d Susan Sontag A very slim volume, \u201cRegarding the Pain of Others\u201d is a quick, yet painful read that allows you to deeply delve into empathy, a commodity that is doubtless lacking in our current national conversation. \u201cThe Queen of Harlem,\u201d Brian Keith Jackson As Harlem, the perpetual work in progress, continues to change, it\u2019s refreshing to revisit this book by my dear friend Brian Keith Jackson. \u201cThe Queen of Harlem\u201d sets the stage of a neighborhood that was very familiar to me as I left Yale and discovered New York for the first time. \u201cAfrican Metropolitan Architecture,\u201d David Adjaye The narrative around contemporary Africa\u2019s cosmopolitan cities  \u2014   exciting young people, vibrant artists and rapidly evolving promise  \u2014   is, happily, becoming increasingly familiar to people around the globe. In this amazing book, Adjaye looks at architectural spaces across the continent, dividing it into regions defined by climates and cultures, rather than artificially derived national boundaries. Here the Maghreb, the desert, the Sahel, the forest, the Savanna and grasslands, and the mountains and high fields, are the defining features of how different architectures throughout Africa can be witnessed. \u201cHow Pleasure Works,\u201d Paul Bloom Like artists of all stripes, I have attempted to analyze and justify my practice. The creative life, at its best, elucidates and thrives within pleasure: its absence, its expectation and its promise. Bloom\u2019s book isn\u2019t a   on life, but rather a cold, disciplined stare into the machinery of pleasure as it relates to human consciousness. \u201cWhite Trash,\u201d Nancy Isenberg Undergirding so much of the discourse surrounding resentment in America right now is the conversation about race. While the notion of \u201cblackness\u201d is often at the forefront of such discussions, the idea of \u201cwhiteness\u201d is frequently left unexamined. In her surprising new book, Isenberg goes into the history of how the \u201cwhite trash\u201d identity is directly related to social caste and economic realities that are perpetually unacknowledged in American castings of itself, its character and its history. \u201cWhite Trash\u201d is at once informative, painful and enlightening in how complex our obsession with       has evolved. \u201cRace and the Enlightenment: A Reader,\u201d Emmanuel Chukwudi Eze One of my favorite reads from those fundamental years of art school, I first discovered this book when trying to come to terms with western Enlightenment culture\u2019s broad impact on ideation in artistic practice. So much of Enlightenment thinking is poisoned by prior notions of race that one must ask: Is it ever possible to separate some of our greatest understandings derived from the Enlightenment era from its problematic history? In \u201cRace and the Enlightenment,\u201d Eze examines foundational writings on race by major Enlightenment figures and lays bare the toxic notions of their time in their own words. \u201cLove in the Time of Cholera,\u201d Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez \u201cLove in the Time of Cholera\u201d is not a love story, but more a treatise on the subject of love in all its many forms. M\u00e1rquez\u2019s brilliant storytelling here is a joy, transforming the mundane realities of a long marriage into moments to be savored and relished. The intimate discoveries and daily bonds of marriage are at once thoroughly human, relatable, as well as spiritually transcendent.'"}, "time": 1742564602.823235}
