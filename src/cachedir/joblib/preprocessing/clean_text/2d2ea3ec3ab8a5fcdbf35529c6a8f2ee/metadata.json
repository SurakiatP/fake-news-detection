Krauthammer said, \u201c[I]t makes no sense. It\u2019s totally illogical if you\u2019re a Democrat. The fight is going to be over the next nominee. As you say, this nominee does not alter the balance of the court ideologically. The next very well could, whether it\u2019s a Kennedy, or a Ginsburg, or a Breyer, it could be a radical change, a   if it\u2019s a Kennedy, and that would have an effect. And you\u2019d expect the Democrats to want to save their ammunition, but they are expending it here. \u201d He added, \u201cI think they are, in some ways, suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome, in the sense that they might not be personally deranged by his presence, but they have a base that has not recovered from the election, and they insist that anybody who represents them and does not want to face a primary fight, or have a demonstration outside their house on a weekend, is  \u2014   will oppose what Trump is doing. This is about Trump. It isn\u2019t about Gorsuch. And that I think, is their motive for doing it, but it makes no sense because, if this is the first partisan filibuster, it will be the last. \u201d Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742628291.4126647}
