We just haven\u2019t quite taken it in. Not really. \\nForget Donald Trump. \\nAdvertisement Square, Site wide \\nDoh! Why did I write that? Who could possibly forget the first presidential candidate in our history preemptively unwilling to accept election results? (Even the South in 1860 accepted the election of Abraham Lincoln before trying to wave goodbye to the Union.) Who could forget the man who claimed that abortions could take place on the day of or the day before actual birth? Who could forget the man who claimed in front of an audience of nearly 72 million Americans that he had never met the women who accused him of sexual aggression and abuse, including the People magazine reporter who interviewed him? Who could forget the candidate who proudly cited his positive polling results at rallies and in tweets, month after month, before (when those same polls turned against him) discovering that they were all \u201c rigged \u201d? \\nWhatever you think of The Donald, who in the world\u2014and I mean the whole wide world (including the Iranians )\u2014could possibly forget him or the election he\u2019s stalked so ominously? When you think of him, however, don\u2019t make him the cause of American political dysfunction. He\u2019s just the bizarre, disturbed, and disturbing symptom of the transformation of the American political system. \\nAdmittedly, he is a one-of-a-kind \u201cpolitician,\u201d even among his associates in surging right-wing nationalist and anti-whatever movements globally. He makes France\u2019s Marine Le Pen seem like the soul of rationality and Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte look like a master tactician of our age. But what truly makes Donald Trump and this election season fascinating and confounding is that we\u2019re not just talking about the presidency of a country, but of the country. The United States remains the great imperial state on Planet Earth in terms of the reach of its military and the power of its economy and culture to influence the workings of everything just about everywhere. And yet, based on the last strange year of election campaigning, it\u2019s hard not to think that something\u2014and not just The Donald\u2014is unnervingly amiss on Planet America. \\nThe World War II Generation in 2016 \\nSometimes, in my fantasies (as while watching the final presidential debate), I perform a private miracle and bring my parents back from the dead to observe our American world. With them in the room, I try to imagine the disbelief many from that World War II generation would surely express about our present moment. Of course, they lived through a devastating depression, light years beyond anything we experienced in the Great Recession of 2007-2008, as well as a global conflagration of a sort that had never been experienced and\u2014short of nuclear war\u2014is not likely to be again. \\nDespite this, I have no doubt that they would be boggled by our world and the particular version of chaos we now live with. To start at a global level, both my mother (who died in 1977) and my father (who died in 1983) spent decades in the nuclear age, the era of humanity\u2019s greatest\u2014for want of a better word\u2014achievement. After all, for the first time in history, we humans took the apocalypse out of the hands of God (or the gods), where it had resided for thousands of years, and placed it directly in our own. What they didn\u2019t live to experience, however, was history\u2019s second potential deal-breaker, climate change, already bringing upheaval to the planet, and threatening a slow-motion apocalypse of an unprecedented sort. \\nWhile nuclear weapons have not been used since August 9, 1945 , even if they have spread to the arsenals of numerous countries, climate change should be seen as a snail-paced version of nuclear war\u2014and keep in mind that humanity is still pumping near-record levels of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. I imagine my parents\u2019 amazement that the most dangerous and confounding issue on the planet didn\u2019t get a single question , not to speak of an answer, in the three presidential debates of 2016, the four and a half hours of charges, insults, and interruptions just past. Neither a moderator, nor evidently an undecided voter (in the town hall second debate), nor either presidential candidate\u2014each ready to change the subject on a moment\u2019s notice from embarrassing questions about sexual aggression, emails, or anything else\u2014thought it worth the slightest attention. It was, in short, a problem too large to discuss, one whose existence Donald Trump (like just about every other Republican) denies, or rather, in his case, labels a \u201choax\u201d that he uniquely blames on a Chinese plot to sink America. \\nSo much for insanity (and inanity) when it comes to the largest question of all. On a somewhat more modest scale, my mom and dad wouldn\u2019t have recognized our political world as American, and not just because of Donald Trump. They would have been staggered by the money pouring into our political system\u2014at least $6.6 billion in this election cycle according to the latest estimate, more than 10% of that from only 100 families. They would have been stunned by our 1% elections ; by our new Gilded Age ; by a billionaire TV celebrity running as a \u201cpopulist\u201d by riling up once Democratic working-class whites immiserated by the likes of him and his \u201cbrand\u201d of casino capitalism, scam, and spectacle; by all those other billionaires pouring money into the Republican Party to create a gerrymandered Congress that will do their obstructionist bidding; and by just how much money can be \u201cinvested\u201d in our political system in perfectly legal ways these days. And I haven\u2019t even mentioned the Other Candidate, who spent all of August on the true \u201ccampaign trail,\u201d hobnobbing not with ordinary Americans but with millionaires and billionaires (and assorted celebrities ) to build up her phenomenal \u201c war chest .\u201d'"}, "time": 1742562931.015383}
