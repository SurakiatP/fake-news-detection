[\u201cThis is among the most important work we do, protecting children especially,\u201d Comey said in his prepared remarks.  Comey described the shocking case of Doctors Jumana Nagarwala and Fakhruddin Attar, which made headlines around the world last month as the very first prosecution for FGM in the United States: For the first time since Congress passed a statute making it a crime in the United States to engage in female genital mutilation, to mutilate little girls  \u2014   it\u2019s been a felony in the United States since 1996  \u2014   we made the first case, last week, against two doctors in Michigan for doing this terrifying thing to young girls all across the country. FGM, a practice most popular among certain parts of the Muslim world, had not been   before recently in the United States. The practice involves cutting a   girl\u2019s genitals in a ritual designed to make her \u201cclean\u201d before her eventual marriage. There are differing forms of mutilation, some more extreme than others, but all involve the removal of varying amounts of a young girl\u2019s clitoris, labia majoria, and labia minora. The most extreme form of FGM is called \u201cinfibulation,\u201d in which virtually all external genitalia is removed and the wound is sewn together, leaving only a single tiny hole from which to urinate and menstruate until the girl is married. It is unclear how prevalent FGM is in the United States, but Comey\u2019s FBI believes Nagarwala and Attar\u2019s FGM operation has been operating for over a decade and has mutilated girls from across the American Midwest. Both the doctors and their named victims are part of the Dawoodi Bohra Muslim sect, named only as a \u201cparticular religious and cultural community\u201d in the complaints. Dawoodi Bohra is based in India and boasts over a million members across the world, with increasing numbers in the United States. The sect\u2019s leadership has made clear time and again that FGM is absolutely necessary as an \u201cact of religious purity\u201d and \u201ca religious obligation for all women and girls. \u201d Director Comey closed his remarks by praising his agents who made these arrests possible. \u201cIt was done by great work that you don\u2019t hear about a whole lot all across the country by the FBI,\u201d he told the committee.'"}, "time": 1742628438.7224782}
