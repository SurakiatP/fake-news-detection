Ambassador John Bolton discussed the significance of President Trump\u2019s apparent openness to a \u201c \u201d rather than \u201c \u201d solution for the   conflict. [\u201cFor basically the past 70 years, everybody on the Left, around the world, has insisted the only possible solution to the   conflict, and specifically with the Palestinians, is the creation of a Palestinian state,\u201d Bolton explained. \u201cWe\u2019ve got Israel, and then you have a state called Palestine. Now, I won\u2019t get into the extraordinarily complicated history of this. Some would say that when the British split their mandate and created Jordan, that was a Palestinian state. \u201d   \u201cBut leaving all that aside, the fact is there\u2019s nobody on the Palestinian side for the Israelis to negotiate with, other than terrorists like Hamas,\u201d he continued. \u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee that a Palestinian authority could keep up a state that wasn\u2019t a home for terrorists. And there\u2019s, frankly, no prospect in the near term that a Palestinian state would do anything for its own people, that it could simply not be economically viable. \u201d  \u201cThe idea of a   solution comes in a variety of forms, but it absolutely violates the   theological doctrine that there must be a Palestinian state. So for Trump to say, \u2018I could live with a   solution, I could live with a   solution\u2019 blows up about 70 years of orthodoxy,\u201d he said.  \u201cOf all the disruptive things he\u2019s done in Washington in just one month, that could be the most disruptive of all,\u201d Bolton proclaimed. \u201cIt just sends a signal all around the world that really the persecution of Israel that we\u2019ve seen, unfortunately, in many European countries, in the U. N. for sure, is going to meet some fierce resistance from this president. \u201d SiriusXM host Lee Stranahan wondered if Trump signaled a willingness to accept a   solution as a negotiating tactic  \u2014   a means of prodding the Palestinian leadership into pursuing more realistic goals. \u201cIt\u2019s possible,\u201d Bolton replied. \u201cAnd he did say, \u2018Look, I could live with a   solution if the parties agree to it.\u2019 That part  \u2014   that ultimately peace in the Middle East has to come from an agreement between the parties to the conflict it cannot be imposed from the outside  \u2014   is critical. It happens to be accurate. That\u2019s how Camp David occurred in 1979, the peace agreement between Egypt and Israel. It\u2019s how peace was reached between Israel and Jordan. \u201d  \u201cThe   solution really is an outside imposition on Israel, based in the view of many. So he\u2019s really saying, \u2018I\u2019m going to leave it to the parties.\u2019 If they were to come up with a   solution  \u2014   in other words, as you suggest, if the Palestinians got politically accountable, democratically elected leadership, foreswore terrorism, accepted the existence of Israel as a state, and were prepared to negotiate boundaries that would give Israel security  \u2014   yeah, it\u2019s possible. I think it\u2019s unlikely,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s an old saying: putting the cat among the pigeons. Boy, I\u2019m telling you, the cat\u2019s among the pigeons today,\u201d Bolton remarked. Stranahan asked for Bolton\u2019s grade on the Trump administration\u2019s handling of   from Iran and North Korea. \u201cI think when Prime Minister Abe of Japan was with the president, the North Koreans, as you say their act of provocation was firing a   ballistic missile into the Sea of Japan. Abe said that\u2019s unacceptable. Trump said we\u2019re 100 percent behind our ally Japan. I think he could have gone beyond that. He could have talked about South Korea. He could have talked about the threat to us, frankly,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cBut I think it was a pretty clear signal. Secretary of Defense Mattis was just in the region, visited Japan and South Korea, very clear about our opposition to the North Koreans. So the rhetoric, all very good, but we\u2019ve got to get the specifics. We\u2019ve got to pressure China in ways that we haven\u2019t under Obama, even under the prior Bush administration. I think this is a huge threat because it\u2019s not only North Korea\u2019s capacity to deliver a ballistic missile to the West Coast of the United States with a nuclear warhead, possibly in the next few years, according to our own military commanders in South Korea  \u2014   but they\u2019re cooperation with Iran on missiles and likely on nuclear programs, as well,\u201d he warned. \u201cThe first thing that has to be dealt with, with Iran, is this wretched nuclear deal that Obama cut with them,\u201d Bolton argued. \u201cBefore he was fired, Mike Flynn went out  \u2014   I think the president\u2019s instruction  \u2014   and said he was putting Iran on notice that their ballistic missile testing was unacceptable. We\u2019re going to have to come to a decision very soon, I wish we had done it already, to junk the Obama nuclear deal with Iran, which I don\u2019t think the ayatollahs are complying with to begin with. I\u2019m sure in the conversations between Trump and Netanyahu yesterday, how to deal with Iran was right at the top of the agenda, as it should be. \u201d Bolton judged that President Trump is \u201cdoing fine on national security matters. \u201d \u201cHe\u2019s doing even better than that, frankly, on domestic matters,\u201d he added. \u201cBut the Left is engaged in collective hysteria. I had an article in the Daily Telegraph in London on Tuesday  \u2014   I should have published it in the United States!  \u2014   to say there\u2019s no basis for this hysteria, let alone the drive by the New York Times and the Washington Post and others to convict half of the administration for cooperating with Russia in hacking the 2016 election, which I think is their objective. \u201d  \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence of any of that activity. I think the New York Times admitted as much yesterday,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got people absolutely going over the moon about how dangerous this is. What is the purpose of all this hysteria about the   cooperation with Russia, the hysteria about foreign policy, the hysteria about the cabinet nominees. The purpose of the hysteria is just to make people hysterical. It\u2019s like shaking a tree to see what else will fall out of it. \u201d  \u201cThey don\u2019t have anything else. They\u2019re not making substantive arguments. They\u2019re looking for embarrassments and mistakes that they can then use to pillory the administration. We\u2019re in a period of maximum turbulence, only one month into the administration. It\u2019s really pretty unprecedented,\u201d he argued. \u201cI think it requires everybody in the White House  \u2014   just the slogan the British had in World War II: \u2018Keep Calm and Carry On.\u2019 That\u2019s what they need to do. Don\u2019t get distracted by all of this. Just keep your eye on the prize and keep moving,\u201d Bolton advised. Stranahan asked Bolton for his assessment of the threat Russia poses to the United States today. \u201cI think you have to look at this not as to whether today the Russians are going to attack us, or even tomorrow, but what the   geopolitical risks are from a Russia under an authoritarian state  \u2014   rebuilding its military, enhancing its ballistic missiles, adding to its arsenal of nuclear weapons, crossing international boundaries in Europe with military force, annexing part of the Ukraine, threatening other Eastern and Central European countries, increasing its influence in the Middle East, and cooperating with China\u201d was Bolton\u2019s highly detailed reply. He gave an example of the latter concern: Russia\u2019s conducting naval maneuvers with China in the Eastern Mediterranean. \u201cIs that behavior threatening to the United States over the long term? Yes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe essence of statesmanship is not waiting around for a threat to be existential. It\u2019s preventing the threat from developing to that point early on. So I do think Russia\u2019s a problem, and I think it needs to be dealt with very strongly. \u201d Bolton said such a strong response would cover \u201cthe Ukraine sanctions and what to do about NATO and how to handle Russia in the Middle East because they are very extensively involved in a variety of theaters. \u201d \u201cThe notion that somehow the Russians have become benign is just wrong,\u201d he declared. \u201cThey went through a period of democracy in the 1990s. They struggled with it. They\u2019ve moved out of democracy, back into authoritarianism. This is an object lesson that history doesn\u2019t always move in a   direction. We\u2019ve got to deal with that. It\u2019s not an ideological threat, but it is a classic nineteenth century power whose interests are widely different from those of the United States. \u201d Stranahan followed up by asking if the Obama administration and Hillary Clinton State Department had \u2018created opportunities for Russia to become even more of a threat.\u2019 \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d said Bolton. \u201cThey wanted to press the famous \u2018reset button.\u2019 They thought the problems with Russia had been caused by the Bush administration. The Russians took advantage of them repeatedly by getting us to dismantle our national missile defense capabilities on Poland and the Czech Republic, agreeing to the   New START arms control treaty  \u2014   a really terrible agreement from the U. S. point of view  \u2014   and on and on and on. \u201d  \u201cThey took advantage of Obama\u2019s weakness. They did it for eight straight years,\u201d he charged. \u201cAnd the big advantage of the Trump presidency is, I think, he\u2019s demonstrated, just in the first four weeks, is that he projects a strong America. That will get Putin\u2019s attention. We actually have a better opportunity to form a cooperative relationship with Russia, at least on a few issues, because they perceive America now has a strong leader, rather than a weak one like Obama. \u201d John Bolton is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and presides over his own political action committee, BoltonPAC.
