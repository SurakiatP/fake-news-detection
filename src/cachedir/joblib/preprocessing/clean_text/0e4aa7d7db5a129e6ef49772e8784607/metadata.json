[The real estate magnate chided the deal on the campaign trail, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few. \u201d  Critics argue that the increased concentration of media and telecom companies hurts competition and consumers. Stephen K. Bannon, Trump\u2019s chief strategist, also opposes the deal. Trump\u2019s apprehensions with the merger stem partly from CNN, a subsidiary of Time Warner, which he argues covers him unfairly. Trump has called the network a \u201cfake news\u201d network as the outlet\u2019s personalities have repeatedly criticized him as he\u2019s taken the highest office in the land. Fox Business\u2019 Charlie Gasparino claims that Time Warner might need to spin off CNN as a separate entity to make the deal work. But it\u2019s not just CNN\u2019s biased coverage against him that has led to President Trump\u2019s opposition to the merger. During the campaign, his economic adviser Peter Navarro \u2014  now the director of the newly created National Trade Council in the Trump White House \u2014  said Trump is generally opposed to the consolidation of media power in a handful of companies: The very corporations that have gained from shipping America\u2019s factories and jobs offshore are the very same media conglomerates now pushing Hillary Clinton\u2019s agenda. She is the official candidate of the multinational ruling elite. NBC, and its Clinton megaphone MSNBC, were once owned by General Electric, a leader in offshoring factories to China. Now NBC has been bought by Comcast, which is specifically targeting the Chinese market  \u2014   even as Comcast\u2019s anchors and reporters at MSNBC engage in their Never Trump tactics. ATT, the original and abusive \u201cMa Bell\u201d telephone monopoly, is now trying to buy Time Warner and thus the wildly   CNN. Donald Trump would never approve such a deal because it concentrates too much power in the hands of the too and powerful few. Senator Jeff Sessions ( ) once confirmed as attorney general, would the merger. When asked by Senator Mike Lee ( ) about whether there would be side deals requiring CNN to be spun off for the merger to be approved, Sessions said, \u201cThe law is not crystal clear about what\u2019s lawful and what\u2019s not lawful and what the antitrust division is required to do and it leave dangers, if not politicization of it, it remains dangers of policy agendas getting embroiled in it. \u201d The law\u2019s ambiguity allows for flexibility when it comes to Trump\u2019s decision on the merger because he has not made up his mind yet on the matter. President Trump says that he has \u201cnot seen all the facts. \u201d He told Axios, \u201cI have been on the record in the past of saying it\u2019s too big and we have to keep competition. So, but other than that, I haven\u2019t, you know, I haven\u2019t seen any of the facts, yet. I\u2019m sure that will be presented to me and to the people within government. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628479.4739408}
