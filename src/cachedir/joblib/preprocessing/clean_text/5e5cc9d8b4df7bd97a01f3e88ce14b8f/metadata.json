This picture was taken in Pittsburgh California. My sister texted this to me 10 minutes ago.Our democracy is being tested even in California pic.twitter.com/gDLKw54Lox \\n\u2014 James Thompson (@JETBallin) November 13, 2016 \\nThe sign clearly promotes lynching to prevent African-Americans from getting equal rights. \\n\u201cYou can hang a n****r from a tree / Equal rights he will never see!\u201d it says. \\nThe FBI has been notified and local police have filed a lawsuit in an effort to force the owners of the sign to remove it. \\nIn the wake of Trump\u2019s surprising and depressing victory there has been a rise in the number of racist incidents in this country. In fact, there have been 139 reports of people being bullied by Trump supporters since the election night results. \\nThese incidents include the harassment of a Muslim teacher by a student in Georgia, and students designating water fountains \u201cwhite\u201d or \u201ccolored\u201d at a Florida high school. \\nFrankly, there are so many incidents that it\u2019s difficult to list them all. You can find a somewhat comprehensive tally here . \\nThis is what Trump\u2019s America looks like and it\u2019s scary. And this has all happend in the course of a few days as Melania Trump continues to tell the media that her focus will be on ending bullying. What exactly does she mean by that? Is she going to call out all bullying, including the racist bullying being perpetrated by her husband\u2019s own supporters? Or is she going to ignore those incidents and merely whine about people who criticize her husband. Because right now, she isn\u2019t even First Lady yet and her \u201ceffort\u201d has failed miserably. And she only has her husband to blame.'"}, "time": 1742563407.436138}
