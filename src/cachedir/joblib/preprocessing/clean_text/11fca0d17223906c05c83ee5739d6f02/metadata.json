The event, called \u201c Veterans Stand for Standing Rock ,\u201d already has 108 confirmed RSVPs on Facebook, and features several high-profile progressive activists who have served in the military, including U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) and Baltimore police officer-turned police brutality whistleblower Michael A. Wood, Jr . \\n\u201cBring Body armor, gas masks, earplugs AND shooting mufflers (we may be facing a sound cannon) but no drugs, alcohol or weapons,\u201d the event page, organized by Wes Clark Jr., states. \\nThe Facebook event is already being used to organize logistics for the veterans to come to Standing Rock, complete with rideshare registration and financial assistance for veterans scattered around the country who want to support the protest. \\n\u201cMy husband is a veteran Army Combat Medic,\u201d wrote Morgan McClure on the event page. \u201cHe has been talking about doing this for so long.\u201d \\nClark has also launched a GoFundMe page for the deployment, which he says will be used to provide material and logistical support to all the veterans wanting to join the Standing Rock protest from around the country. As of this writing, approximately $30,000 has been raised toward the $100,000 goal in just 10 days. \\n\u201cEveryday becomes more evident that the defenders of America must stand with the Water Protectors,\u201d Clark wrote on the GoFundMe page. \u201cLet\u2019s stop this savage injustice being committed right here at home. If not us, who? If not now, when?\u201d \\nClark cited the need for veterans to support the indigenous protesters at the pipeline construction site due to the excessive and heavy-handed militarized police response to the protests. \\nHere are some of what the protesters at Standing Rock have faced: Mace, sound cannons. sniper guns pointed at unarmed civilians, journalists being shot with rubber bullets, journalists being arrested for covering the protests, attack dogs unleashed on groups including children, elder Natives getting tased and violently arrest[ sic ], protesters marked with numbers and kept in dog kennels after arrest\u2026 \\nThe Dakota Access Pipeline, which would transport roughly half a million barrels of crude oil daily underneath the Missouri River, has had construction held up for months as protests continue to grow. Indigenous communities gathering at the construction site say the pipeline has the potential to permanently poison water supplies for millions of people who depend on the Missouri River for drinking, bathing, and farming. Part of the Dakota Access Pipeline construction route have been held up by the Obama administration, though that order has been ignored by pipeline builders. \\n\u201cMost civilians who\u2019ve never served in a uniform are gutless worms who\u2019ve never been in a fight in their life,\u201d Clark told Task & Purpose . \u201cSo if we don\u2019t stop it, who will?\u201d \\n\\nZach Cartwright is an activist and author from Richmond, Virginia.
