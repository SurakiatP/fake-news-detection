S. to refugees and people from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Implemented with little regard for basic governance, the measure drew support from Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters but criticism from   protesters, Silicon Valley, some members of his own party, State Department diplomats and even former President Obama. Mr. Trump fired the acting attorney general, a holdover from the Obama administration, after she instructed the Justice Department not to defend the order. World leaders have objected to the order, but the leaders of U. S. allies are faced with either openly criticizing Mr. Trump or facing protests at home, like the one above in Scotland. _____ \u2022 Mr. Trump\u2019s team was also on the defense over his startling reorganization of the National Security Council, a crucial adviser on major decisions.

Rights groups dismissed the move as a bid to deflect attention from police impunity. _____ \u2022 And Australian police are reviewing the deaths of 88 men between 1976 and 2000 to determine whether they should be classified as   hate crimes. The authorities now say gangs of teenagers hunted gay men for sport, sometimes forcing their victims off the cliffs that line Sydney Harbor. Above, a man whose brother fell to his death there in 1988. \u201cWe can now see that predators were attacking gay men,\u201d said a former police minister. \u201cAnd they were doing it with the   knowledge that the police would not have gone after them. That was the police culture of the day. \u201d \u2022 Nearly 400   stacks of Tesla batteries are helping California handle a projected energy shortage, demonstrating both the promise of the batteries as a substitute for conventional power plants and Tesla\u2019s evolution into a multifaceted clean energy company. \u2022 Volkswagen overtook Toyota to become the world\u2019s largest automaker. \u2022 Sony took a nearly $1 billion loss on its movie business, but said it remained committed to Sony Pictures Division. \u2022 The Bank of Japan will update its economic forecasts after President Trump\u2019s election sent the yen into   and rewrote the outlook for Asia in 2017. \u2022 A competitor to the bike repair shop has emerged in the U. S.: mobile shops that make house calls. \u2022 Wall Street had its worst day of 2017, and the dollar slipped against the yen. Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets. \u2022 Tens of thousands of mourners gathered in Yangon for the funeral of Myanmar\u2019s most prominent Muslim lawyer, U Ko Ni, who was assassinated on Sunday.

[The New York Times] \u2022 The operator of the Fukushima nuclear complex said fuel debris may have been located under one of its reactors, a possible breakthrough in cleanup efforts. [The Guardian] \u2022 Fred Korematsu, who fought the U. S. government\u2019s internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, was honored by a Google doodle on what would have been his 98th birthday. [Al Jazeera English] \u2022 In Cambodia, sculptors near Angkor Wat are creating reproductions of antiquities of such quality that unscrupulous dealers are selling them as the real thing  \u2014   making them forgeries after the fact. [The Phnom Penh Post] \u2022 If you\u2019ve never tried yoga, let this be the week you do: Here\u2019s the NYT guide on what you need to know about getting started. \u2022 We found a really cheap way to get happier: Get up and move around. \u2022 Recipe of the day: Try this spinach salad with pancetta and fried eggs. \u2022 The Japanese entrepreneur whose company created   one of the most successful video games ever, has died.

The French capital is eager to host the Olympic Games in 2024 and the World Expo in 2025. If it wins either bid, Paris will need to accommodate more than the normal roughly six million tourists visiting the landmark each year. But this concern would not exist  \u2014   nor would the tower itself  \u2014   had Eiffel\u2019s many early opponents prevailed. Some appeared to have worked at The Times. In 1887, when construction started, critics called the monument \u201cthe grotesque and mercantile imagination of a machine maker,\u201d according to a Times report. When the tower was inaugurated at a world exhibition in 1889, The Times wrote: \u201cOh! who will deliver us from the Eiffel Tower!\u201d And in 1937, The Times described the tower as \u201can aesthetic misfit\u201d that would soon be razed. \u201cIt is felt that the Eiffel Tower is out of date and out of perspective.
