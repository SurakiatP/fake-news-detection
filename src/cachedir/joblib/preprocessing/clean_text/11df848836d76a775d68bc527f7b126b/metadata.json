Technically we are \u2018enabling\u2019 him but fuck it; it\u2019s really good telly. \\n\u201cWe\u2019re always careful to cut away from him before he starts talking to Peter, the \u2018Rapiest Giraffe of Them All\u2019.\u201d Jeremy Vine election coverage \\nJeremy Vine has been taking LSD ever since John Major\u2019s first election victory; the campaign proving so overwhelmingly dull that recreational drug use became BBC protocol for several weeks. \\nVine is thought to be the only one to keep this up, apart from the Chuckle Brothers, who owe their youthful energy to a vigorous cocaine regimen. \\nAfter ballot day, it is thought that Vine will commence the mother of all comedowns, which should wear off just before his next pre-election bender for a Brexit-inspired snap election sometime next month.
