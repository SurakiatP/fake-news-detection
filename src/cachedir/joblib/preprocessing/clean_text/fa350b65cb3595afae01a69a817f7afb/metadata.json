While winning the popular vote would not in itself guarantee a Trump victory, if IBD / TIPP is once again accurate and Trump has a 2% or greater margin in the popular vote, it would far more likely than not he would also catapult above the 270 electoral votes needed to secure the Presidency. \\nIBD\u2019s polling partner TechnoMetrica uses \u201ctraditional\u201d telephone methodology using live interviewers for data collection for its public opinion surveys. Roughly 65% of interviews come from a cell phone sample and 35% from a Random Digit Dial (RDD) land line sample. \\nIBD\u2019s result is a outlier if you compare it to polls conducted by network as CBS News, ABC, NBC and Fox News have Clinton up between 1 and 4% in their final pre-Election polls. \\nHowever, today\u2019s LA Times / USC poll has Trump with an even larger 5% margin of victory. \\nWe won\u2019t have to wait long to see which national poll ends up being right. Trump supporters certainly hope the reigning king for accuracy will prevail once again. \\nFor once in our lifetime, we the people have an opportunity to elect a President who was NOT chosen by Multinational Corporations, Big Banks, DC Elites, and the Globalist Lapdog Mainstream Media. \\nPlease like and share if you are a TRUMP VOTER!
