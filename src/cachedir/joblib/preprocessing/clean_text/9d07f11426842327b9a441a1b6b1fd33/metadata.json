[The incident occurred in the Stockyards district around 10:45 pm Saturday.  According to Cleveland. com, the suspect,    Frederick Thornton, walked into the business wearing a surgical mask, pointed a gun at the    clerk, and demanded money. He allegedly became aggravated with the clerk\u2019s pace and \u201csmacked his gun against the register,\u201d demanding the money be handed over quicker. Banging against the register and screaming at the clerk caused enough noise that a    working in the back of the store noticed the commotion, retrieved a handgun, and went out to intervene. The video shows the employee sneak up behind Thornton and put the gun against his back.  Thornton then spun around. The two began to wrestle for control of the guns. An employee came out from behind the counter, took away Thornton\u2019s gun and fired warning shots into the air. Thornton then put his hands in the air at the sound of gunfire and asked the employees \u201cnot to shoot. \u201d While one employee held Thornton at gunpoint, the second armed employee ran outside to see if any accomplices were waiting on Thornton to exit the store. Police soon arrived, arrested Thornton, and charged him with \u201caggravated robbery. \u201d Store owner Haytham Mustafa expressed pride in the way his employees handled the situation. He said, \u201cThank God no one was hurt. They really handled it well. They didn\u2019t go overboard and didn\u2019t hurt anyone. That\u2019s what we wanted to do  \u2014   hold him and let the law deal with him. \u201d AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.
