C.  \u2014   Polly Sheppard, a    retired nurse and longtime stalwart of Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, dived under a table as the gunfire began and did the only thing she could think to do: She prayed aloud. She could see the bullet casings skittering across the floor of the fellowship hall and the young man\u2019s boots approaching. Dylann S. Roof told her to \u201cshut up,\u201d then asked menacingly if he had shot her yet. \u201cI said \u2018no,\u2019\u201d Ms. Sheppard testified on Wednesday, as the final witness in the guilt phase of Mr. Roof\u2019s federal trial on 33 counts, including hate crimes resulting in death. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018I\u2019m not going to. I\u2019m going to leave you to tell the story. \u2019\u201d She did, in a panicked call to a 911 operator that night, and again on Wednesday, when she described the events to a courtroom crowded with family members of the nine parishioners Mr. Roof is accused of killing in a massacre on June 17, 2015. After Ms. Sheppard finished testifying, the prosecution rested, and Mr. Roof\u2019s defense lawyers followed suit after declining to call any witnesses. With their eyes on the sentencing phase of the death penalty trial, the lawyers have tried to make suggestions of Mr. Roof\u2019s mental incapacity, but have been allowed little leeway by Judge Richard M. Gergel. Before the defense rested, Judge Gergel, of Federal District Court, summoned Mr. Roof to the bench, placed him under oath out of the jury\u2019s presence and asked if he wanted to testify in his own defense. Mr. Roof, 22, with pale white skin and a distinctive   haircut, said he did not. Judge Gergel has scheduled closing arguments for Thursday, and jurors are then expected to begin deliberations. If Mr. Roof is convicted  \u2014   a virtual certainty, as he confessed in a recorded F. B. I. interview and left a trail of incontrovertible evidence  \u2014   the jury will return in January to hear more evidence and decide whether to sentence him to death or to life in prison. Mr. Roof, who offered to plead guilty in exchange for a life term, plans to represent himself during that phase. He also faces capital murder charges in state court in a trial scheduled to begin on Jan. 17. Over six days, federal prosecutors presented the jury with an array of technical evidence that established the timeline of Mr. Roof\u2019s plot, but they bookended their case with Ms. Sheppard\u2019s testimony and that of her friend and fellow survivor, Felicia Sanders, who appeared as the opening witness. Guided gently through questioning by an assistant United States attorney, Julius N. Richardson, Ms. Sheppard humanized the nine victims. There was the Rev. Daniel Lee Simmons Sr. known as \u201cDapper Dan,\u201d who always wore a fedora and usually led the Bible study. She spoke of Ethel Lee Lance, who cleaned the church with \u201ca woman\u2019s touch\u201d and loved the song \u201cOne Day at a Time. \u201d Tywanza Sanders had a \u201cbig smile,\u201d and his   Susie Jackson, was \u201ca very sweet lady. \u201d The Rev. DePayne   \u201ccould sing like an angel. \u201d Cynthia Hurd, a librarian, had a soft spot for Zora Neale Hurston. And the Rev. Sharonda   the tall, graceful track coach, could preach like nobody\u2019s business. Ms. Sheppard said she attended the Bible study that night only because her    friend, Myra Thompson, was leading it. She sat near the back because she planned to sneak out early, but Ms. Thompson kept an eye on her. At some point, Ms. Sheppard testified, nodding toward Mr. Roof, \u201cthe young man at the table over there joined us. \u201d She said the church\u2019s pastor, the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, asked Mr. Roof if he was there for the study session, handed him a Bible and a pamphlet about the night\u2019s lesson, and offered him a chair. Usually, Ms. Sheppard said, the group would end with a prayer adapted from Genesis: \u201cThe Lord watch between me and thee when we are absent from another. \u201d But as they rose for the benediction, the gunman began firing, she said. Mr. Pinckney was the first to be shot. Ms. Sheppard said she first thought the explosions had come from the church\u2019s aging wiring but then heard Ms. Sanders scream, \u201cHe\u2019s shooting!\u201d She reached for Ms. Lance\u2019s cellphone and, after initially pressing the wrong buttons, managed to dial 911. \u201cHe shot the pastor,\u201d she told the dispatcher during a recorded call that was played in court on Wednesday. \u201cHe shot all the men in the church. \u201d Soon after, she told the dispatcher, \u201cThere\u2019s so many people dead, I think. Oh, my God. \u201d When the gunman finally left the building, Ms. Sheppard checked the pulse of Mr. Pinckney and another victim. She found none. Mr. Roof, who confessed that he had planned to kill himself if confronted by the police at the church, fled in his car into the sweltering South Carolina night. He was captured the next day in North Carolina. The evidence that prosecutors presented against him included GPS data showing he had visited the church\u2019s neighborhood six times in the six months before the attack and telephone records showing he had called the church four months before. They also have used Mr. Roof\u2019s writings, photographs and possessions to depict him as a racial extremist. Jurors heard, for instance, that he had downloaded a history of the Ku Klux Klan in August 2014, and that investigators found in his bedroom a pillowcase cut into a triangular shape, perhaps to represent a Klan hood. Prosecutors presented photographs Mr. Roof had taken of the Confederate battle flag when it flew on the grounds of the State House, before its removal in July 2015 in response to the shootings. They had a witness read aloud a white supremacist manifesto that Mr. Roof had posted online. They also showed chilling footage of Mr. Roof\u2019s preparations for his assault on the church, including surveillance video of his purchase of a Glock . 45 caliber handgun and   ammunition. Mr. Roof also recorded himself, wearing a black muscle shirt and reflective sunglasses, practicing with his    pistol, expressionlessly firing shot after shot. But on the final day of testimony, prosecutors turned away from Mr. Roof\u2019s planning and back to its consequences. A forensic pathologist, Dr. S. Erin Presnell, described the findings of autopsies that showed the nine parishioners had been struck at least 60 times. Then Ms. Sheppard, a bright pink scarf draped around her neck, mounted the witness stand. She plucked a tissue or two from a nearby box, and told her story for about 40 minutes. There was no   from Mr. Roof\u2019s lawyer, David I. Bruck. \u201cMs. Sheppard, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he told her softly. \u201cI have no questions. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561721.2056906}
