Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) and Rep. Mike Pompeo (R., Kan.) initially presented Lynch in October with a series of questions about how the cash payment to Iran was approved and delivered. \\nIn an Oct. 24 response , Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik responded on Lynch\u2019s behalf, refusing to answer the questions and informing the lawmakers that they are barred from publicly disclosing any details about the cash payment, which was bound up in a ransom deal aimed at freeing several American hostages from Iran. \\nThe response from the attorney general\u2019s office is \u201cunacceptable\u201d and provides evidence that Lynch has chosen to \u201cessentially plead the fifth and refuse to respond to inquiries regarding [her] role in providing cash to the world\u2019s foremost state sponsor of terrorism,\u201d Rubio and Pompeo wrote on Friday in a follow-up letter to Lynch, according to a copy obtained by the Free Beacon . \\nThe inquiry launched by the lawmakers is just one of several concurrent ongoing congressional probes aimed at unearthing a full accounting of the administration\u2019s secret negotiations with Iran.'"}, "time": 1742563514.6577315}
