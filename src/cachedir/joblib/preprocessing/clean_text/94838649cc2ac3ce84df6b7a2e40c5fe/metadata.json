[\u201cIt was disgraceful,\u201d Sharpton told TMZ of Maher. \u201cI have a lot of respect for Bill. He\u2019s a friend, I\u2019ve been on his show many times, but he is totally wrong. This is outrageous. He must be held accountable. There is no joke about using the  . \u201d  \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed in Bill and I think to just say it and apologize and not have some accountability is not enough,\u201d the   activist and former MSNBC anchor added.  On Friday\u2019s episode of Real Time, Maher referred to himself as a \u201chouse ni**er. \u201d The   comment sparked backlash on social media and calls for Maher\u2019s firing by Sharpton and Black Lives Matter activist DeRay McKesson. HBO issued a statement Saturday condemning Maher\u2019s remarks, and promised that the slur would be edited out of future broadcasts of the show. \u201cBill Maher\u2019s comment last night was completely inexcusable and tasteless. We are removing his deeply offensive comment from any subsequent airings of the show,\u201d the premium cable channel said. Maher apologized in a statement Saturday, saying \u201cThe word was offensive and I regret saying it and am very sorry. \u201d But Maher\u2019s apology is meaningless, according to Sharpton. \u201cHow do you get a pass for saying something like that?\u201d Sharpton asked. \u201cThey weren\u2019t even talking about race! He just out of nowhere took this \u2014  you felt you got so comfortable with us that you can denigrate us?\u201d However, Maher will apparently come out of this controversy unscathed. His weekly show is scheduled to air Friday. Sen. Al Franken ( .) has pulled out of his scheduled appearance on the show this week in the wake of the controversy, but rapper Ice Cube, former Florida congressman David Jolly, journalist David Gregory, and Symone Sanders, former national press secretary for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, are all scheduled to appear on the next episode.
