That might seem a bit obvious, because if it were easy, chances are you would have made the big life change that\u2019s on your list of changes you would really like to make. But you haven\u2019t. So my question for you is this: Why not? What\u2019s stopping you from just doing it? It might be money, family obligations, fear or just feeling stuck. If you\u2019re at all like me, you see people doing something transformative, like going to medical school at 45, because they couldn\u2019t imagine being an accountant for 20 more years. It seems magical, like one day they just decided to make it happen. For some people (a tiny few, I suspect) it might work that way. I have found, however, that most of the time, it\u2019s much less magical. In truth, it\u2019s a slog. It takes years of thinking and planning. But after plenty of practice, I think I\u2019ve figured out how to streamline things a bit. You may want to try it yourself. First, embrace the uncertainty of life. As much as we don\u2019t like to admit it, life is uncertain. We never know exactly where it will take us. If you doubt me, go back 10 years and ask yourself where you thought you\u2019d be now. I doubt it looks exactly like you planned. So start by being O. K. with the truth in the old saying, \u201cPeople make plans, and God laughs. \u201d Second, be open to possibilities. Many times, we know we want to do something, but we don\u2019t know what \u201cit\u201d is. Explore a bit. Brainstorm. Journal. Allow things to come up and be open to new ideas. Then, once you settle on something, it\u2019s time to plan a bit. At this point, obstacles start to show up, particularly around money. My family first explored the idea of spending a year living outside the United States more than a decade ago. At the time, there were a bunch of reasons it didn\u2019t make sense. Money was just one of them, but it was a big obstacle. So we kept weighing options. For you, it might be as simple as setting aside an hour a week to consider ways to move forward. Ask people who have done the thing you want to do. Use a little of that time you spend on social media for research instead. Little by little, a plan might emerge. If it doesn\u2019t, maybe it\u2019s not time, or it\u2019s not the right plan. As you reach different obstacles, make sure you spend time questioning your assumptions. Maybe something you always considered true is nothing more than someone else\u2019s opinion. Or maybe looking at it from a slightly different angle will produce a different result. Finally, as paths open, head down them. Don\u2019t worry if you experience false starts. I can tell you there will be plenty of those, and you may only need a quick course correction. Almost all of the stories readers shared with me about doing   things involved changing plans, disappointment and lots of hard work. But almost all said that in the end, it was worth it. And one last thing. As you explore making big changes, please realize that maybe nothing needs to change. Sometimes, the permission we seek is to embrace what we have and accept that it brings us real happiness. It\u2019s important to understand that there is nothing wrong with choosing not to change if that\u2019s the right answer for you.'"}, "time": 1742561761.697451}
