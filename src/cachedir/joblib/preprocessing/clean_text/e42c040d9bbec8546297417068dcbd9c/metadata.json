Although this type of race-baiting has been going on for a number of years now, it became more noticeable during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. When these liberals accuse Donald Trump of being racist, they had better be careful for one specific reason: \\nA leaked video from 2008 shows that during President Obama \u2019s first campaign, he was also concerned about border security, and he even suggested a wall! Now, there is just one dominant question anti- Trump individuals need to digest: \\nIs Obama a racist too? Because he was talking about some things you could easily accuse Trump of. Let\u2019s play a quick game. If you didn\u2019t know who said this, would you think it was Donald Trump in 2016 or Barack Obama in 2008? \\nThis man\u2019s core goal was to \u201cpreserve the integrity of our borders to reduce illegal immigration.\u201d Does this sound like Trump or Obama ? \\nHow about this one? This man said, \u201cadditional fencing could help get our border under control.\u201d Definitely sounds more like a GOP candidate than a Democrat one, that\u2019s for sure. \\nFinally, this man also supported \u201cadditional personnel, infrastructure, and technology on our border and at ports of entry.\u201d Liberals would love to claim these quotes came from Donald J. Trump , especially considering he is the villain du jour in their lives at the moment. \\nI hate to steal their thunder, but these quotes did indeed come from a young Barack Obama in 2008. Even he understood the need for a controlled border before the special interests in this country got to him. \\nSo, it is one thing when leaked videos show Hillary Clinton believed border security was important. It was entirely another when they showed that her husband thought it was important, but when liberal idol Barack Obama says it? Say it isn\u2019t so! Liberals just can\u2019t handle that. \\nBut anyway, folks, it is all about platforms. I\u2019m sure you have learned by now that Donald Trump doesn\u2019t get the free pass other politicians in this country enjoy. First of all, he is a conservative, so he is already someone every liberal loves to hate. \\nRepublicans have been so badly demonized in this country simply for desiring to get it under control. Luckily, people saw through the propaganda and decided that Obama \u2019s brand was simply not working any longer. \\nPeople are fed up with politicians who say one thing and do another. If you are looking for a reason why Donald Trump is the new president and not Hillary Clinton, there you go. '"}, "time": 1742628355.8124983}
