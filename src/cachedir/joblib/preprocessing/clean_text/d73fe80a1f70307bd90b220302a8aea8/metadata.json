But WhatsApp forwards are \u2014 in ways that mainstream media can never be \u2014 more fun. And in the aftermath of the demonetisation, WhatsApp forwards have become absolute riots. \\nIn the spirit of this occasion, we in Crank\u2019s News, who take our irresponsible journalism pretty seriously, have come up with five WhatsApp message that you should be forthwith forwarding to all the groups your are part of so that by tomorrow morning these will be actual news all the newspapers and channels. \\n1) Is demonetisation a monetisation for Adani? \\n\u201cFriends, this is confirmed as fact by a colleague\u2019s cousin who is working as a senior-level secretary in the Finance Ministry. He says the Adanis, who are very close to the Modigovernment, and are actually funding not just the BJP but also the entire government, have recently taken over a chocolate factory in Gujarat. The factory is into the manufacture of all kinds of toffees, candies. These are typically the eclairs-types chocolates that shopkeepers give in lieu of small change. \\nMy colleague\u2019s cousin says that what we take to be the demonetisation move by the Modigovernment is a move to monetise the chocolates that Adanis are now manufacturing. Even in normal times, shopkeepers give these candies for change, and in these change-starved times, this is going to get even more pronounced. \\nSo let us realise what the government is really trying to do here through demonetisationand that rich businessman are the ones calling the shots and cheating poor gullible public. Those who think that demonetisation is a sweet news may not know the real fact. \\nThe above is a fwd from another group\u201d. \\n2) India the first country to abolish rich and corrupt totally \\n\u201cForward this to all the other patriotic Indians: \\nAccording to a recent report in the US magazine Business Insider, India has now become the first country in the world to have abolished the rich people (sic) and officially every one in India is middle-class now. \\nThe report, quoting latest statistics from the IMF, has said that Modi\u2019s masterstroke demonetisation has totally made all Indians, including the poor and the rich, truly middle-class, along with those who are already middle-class. The magazine has also quoted Frank X McNamara, the \u2018inventor of credit cards\u2019, as saying that India\u2019s Prime Minister NarendraModi has pulled off what all economists of the world have been wanting to do for long. The use of credit cards will increase and there will be no difference between the rich and the poor as both will be in huge debts\u201d. \\n3) How Modi brought Ratan Tata and Naval chief to fall in line \\n\u201cInteresting True Story This: \\nA friend\u2019s wife was standing in a long queue in front of an ATM in South Bandra, Mumbai. Standing next to her were two well-dressed gentlemen who quietly went about minding their own business. There were murmurs of discontent from some others in the line at having to stand in the queue for withdrawing their own money. \\nHearing this one of the two gentlemen, smiled quietly, and said that standing in a line is a good way to understand the value of hard-earned money. To this the other well-dressed person agreed wholeheartedly and said that there are also people out there on the high seas without any access to ATMs. We are actually lucky to have ATMs near where we live. \\nThe first gentleman, who nodded his headed in approval, said that is very true and introduced himself to the other. \u2018I am Ratan Tata,\u2019 he said. The other offered his hand in a firm handshake and said, \u2018I am Sunil Lanba. I work in Indian Navy. I am its Chief Admiral\u2019. \\nThe rest in the line went silent after this. \\nFriends, this is true simplicity. And thanks Modi for making the country understand this. \\nSend this to your near and dear to make them feel inspired\u201d. \\n4) Trump to outsource management of US economy to Modi \\n\u201cIndia\u2019s contribution to the world economy is economy: \\nAfter years of Indians looking in awe of the Americans, now the tide has turned in favour of India. It is no secret that American President (sic) Donald Trump always likes to follow the footsteps of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Trump had used the same technique in campaigning that Modi used to defeat Sonia to get the better of Hillary Clinton. Trump understood that both Sonia and Hillary Clinton were essentially both women and hence copied the same strategy. \\nAnd now comes the most interesting part. With India\u2019s economy being the fastest growing one in the entire world and the US economy struggling, there are expectations that Trump may ask Modi\u2019s help, and if need be demeonetise US currency, to help shore up his country\u2019s economy. Both dollar and rupee, if Trump has his way, may start sharing the same symbol soon. \\nEconomy, which comes from the ancient Sanskrit word \u2018eko\u2019 which means \u2018one\u2019 and \u2018nomy\u2018 that signifies \u2018currency\u2019, may soon have one single currency as predicted by our scholars who gave economy to the world. \\nMODI truly is Man Of Demonetised India\u201d \\n5) Urjit Patel and Mukesh Ambani are twins FaceOff: Urjit Patel and Mukesh Ambani presenting different facial features to hide the fact that they are actually twins. \\n\u201cWhat your mainstream media will not tell you? \\nHow many of you in the group know that RBI Governor Urjit Patel and Reliance Chief Mukesh Ambani are not only related but are actually twins? \\nWhat your mainstream media will also not report is that Rajdeep Sardesai\u2019s wife Sagarika Ghose, who writes every anti-Modi story that you find in all newspapers, is actually the long-lost granddaughter of former Prime Minister Indra Gandhi. \\nHere is the proof. Check their hairstyles: \\nSend these to all Indians who truly believe they are Indians\u201d.'"}, "time": 1742628493.7781062}
