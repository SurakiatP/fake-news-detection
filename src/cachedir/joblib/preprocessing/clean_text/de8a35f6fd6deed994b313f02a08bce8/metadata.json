But in Los Angeles, Rabbi John L. Rosove of Temple Israel of Hollywood, who is the chairman of the Association of Reform Zionists of America, felt differently. He applauded the speech delivered on Wednesday by Secretary of State John Kerry explaining the decision by the United States not to block a United Nations Security Council resolution that condemned the construction of Israeli settlements in the West Bank. Rabbi Rosove also suggested that many American Jews were broadly supportive of the Obama administration. \u201cI felt Kerry was exactly right,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people who will criticize him will take a leap and say he\u2019s   just as some American Jews are saying Obama is an  . This is ridiculous. They recognize and cherish the state of Israel. \u201d The relationship between Israel and the United States, historically the Jewish state\u2019s closest ally, has seen periods of strain and tension almost from the day of Israel\u2019s creation in 1948. But rarely has the situation between the two countries been this stressed, with President Obama under attack not only from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but also from   Donald J. Trump. The events of the past few days have renewed a longstanding debate over whether American Jews must always stand with the Israeli government, and under what circumstances should they criticize a friend. \u201cThere\u2019s a very clear values clash going on,\u201d said Rabbi Jill Jacobs, the executive director of T\u2019ruah, a rabbinical human rights organization. \u201cOn the one hand, we have a small but vocal minority of American Jews who believe that supporting Israel means supporting the   agenda, the current government. And on the other, there is a larger percentage of American Jews who are committed to Israel and committed to democracy and want to see it as a safe place that reflects our values. \u201d This is a community that is hardly monolithic. For one thing, younger Jews are seen as less likely to identify themselves as religious or supportive of Israel, and do not share memories of the Holocaust or the wars with Israel\u2019s Arab neighbors. American Jews are also overwhelmingly Democratic Jews voted for Hillary Clinton over Mr. Trump, 71 percent to 24 percent, according to exit polls. Yet the most influential and vocal organizations that represent Jews in Washington tend to be more conservative and supportive of Mr. Netanyahu, who has had a combative relationship with Mr. Obama, and has made little secret of his happiness over the changing of the guard that is about to take place in Washington. Mr. Trump has signaled that his administration would upend the nation\u2019s policies toward Israel, promoting rather than discouraging settlement construction and moving the American embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. \u201cThese days the right wing has a louder voice in Israel, and, in some ways, it also has a louder voice in America, because the people who are most actively and publicly Jewish, sectarian Jewish, share the right wing point of view, and are very \u201d said Samuel Heilman, a sociology professor of at Queens College specializing in Jewish life. \u201cBut it\u2019s not the mainstream point of view. \u201d Steven M. Cohen, a research professor at Hebrew Union College and a consultant to a recent Pew study of American Jews, said that Mr. Kerry\u2019s speech represents the viewpoints of most American Jews. \u201cOn survey after survey, American Jews are opposed to Jewish settlement expansion. They tend to favor a   solution and their political identities are liberal or moderate,\u201d he said. Some Jews said they thought Mr. Kerry\u2019s speech, even if delivered in harsh terms, actually reaffirmed the best hope for a lasting peace in Israel: a   solution. \u201cThis administration has been \u201d said Paula Greene, 65, a retired nurse in Hollywood, Fla. \u201cLike Kerry said, you can still be friends, still be allies and still have disagreements. \u201d But for others, even those who support a   solution and object to Israeli settlement policy, the decision by the United States not to shield Israel at the United Nations  \u2014   which is widely viewed among many American Jews as hostile to Israel  \u2014   was a mistake. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, a Democrat with a large Jewish constituency, called the Security Council action unnecessary and inappropriate, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t think you can solve a problem with a friend by flogging them publicly. \u201d The Security Council\u2019s    vote a week ago condemned Israel\u2019s construction of settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem as a \u201cflagrant violation under international law\u201d and an obstacle to peace in the region. The United States chose to abstain rather than use its veto, as it has done in the past to quash resolutions it considered  . Rabbi Rick Jacobs, the president of the Union for Reform Judaism, the largest Jewish movement in North America, said it was \u201ca miscalculation in our minds. I think a majority of American Jews would agree, no matter how one feels about settlements, that the idea that the U. N. is an honest broker when it comes to Israel is laughable. \u201d For Shira Greenberg, a public school teacher in Florida, Mr. Obama\u2019s rebuke of Mr. Netanyahu confirmed her worst assumptions about the president. \u201cThroughout the whole Obama administration, people were trying to guess where he stood,\u201d she said after morning services at her conservative synagogue on Thursday. \u201cAt this point, it\u2019s pretty clear. \u201d And at Sinai Temple in Los Angeles, a large and politically divided congregation, Rabbi David Wolpe said Mr. Obama had \u201cpulled the rug out from under people who said the president\u2019s intentions toward Israel was positive and strong. \u201d The public display of rancor is unsettling. \u201cNobody in the community can be happy when you have this public spat between the prime minister and the president, and the kind of language the prime minister has been using about the president,\u201d said Daniel C. Kurtzer, who has served as the United States ambassador to both Israel and Egypt. David Zwiebel, the executive vice president of Agudath Israel of America, which represents   Jews, said that there is a general sense among Orthodox Jews, who tend to be more conservative, \u201cthat the outgoing administration is outgoing and should be outgoing, and it\u2019s time for an approach that is more openly supportive of Israel. \u201d For all the controversy created by the vote, few Jewish leaders think there is any chance that Mr. Kerry and Mr. Obama might, in the next three weeks, strike the deal that has eluded negotiators for years. That said, some supporters of a   solution applauded Mr. Kerry for trying. \u201cI think it\u2019s a question of legacy,\u201d said Jeremy   the head of J Street, a liberal Jewish lobbying group. \u201cAnd you have to have the long view on this issue. Donald Trump will be president for X years. And then there will be someone else and the chances are it will go back to where we are today. And Bibi will lose someday,\u201d he said, referring to Mr. Netanyahu. \u201cSomeday down the line this is the way it\u2019s got to go. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563194.8101358}
