(Photo by AFP) \\nThe Pakistani Foreign Ministry summoned a senior Indian diplomat to lodge a protest \"over the unprovoked firing by India on the LoC and the working boundary on October 25 and 26.\" \\nThe ministry called on India to \"instruct its troops to respect the ceasefire\" and \"refrain from intentionally targeting the villages and maintain peace.\" \\nRelations between the two countries have plummeted in recent months, with India blaming Pakistan for a raid on an army base in Indian-controlled Kashmir in September that killed 19 soldiers. New Delhi responded with what it called \"surgical strikes,\" infuriating Islamabad. \\nKashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan but claimed in full by both since the two countries gained independence from Britain in 1947. \\nIndia and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire in Kashmir on November 26, 2003, and launched a peace process the following year. Since then, there have been sporadic clashes, with the two sides trading accusations of violating the ceasefire along their de facto border. Loading ...'"}, "time": 1742564189.367386}
