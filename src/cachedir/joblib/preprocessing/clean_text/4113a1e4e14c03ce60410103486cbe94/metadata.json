[Trumka also praised the decision by President Trump to reopen negotiations on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) deal from the 1990s, a deal that saw millions of U. S. jobs leave the country for Mexico and Canada \u2014  and the labor union leader praised President Trump\u2019s harsh words for Big Pharma, the pharmaceutical industry, when Trump said of that industry that \u201cthey\u2019re politically protected, but not anymore\u201d in an interview with the Washington Post.  Trumka said in his Monday statement: Last year, a powerful coalition of labor, environmental, consumer, public health and allied groups came together to stop the TPP. Today\u2019s announcement that the US is withdrawing from TPP and seeking a reopening of NAFTA is an important first step toward a trade policy that works for working people. While these are necessary actions, they aren\u2019t enough. They are just the first in a series of necessary policy changes required to build a fair and just global economy. We will continue our relentless campaign to create new trade and economic rules that end special privileges for foreign investors and Big Pharma, protect our planet\u2019s precious natural resources and ensure fair pay, safe conditions and a voice in the workplace for all workers. \u201d While labor unions\u2019 politically motivated leaders by and large supported Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2016\u2019s presidential election, it is no surprise that President Trump won over many of the workers throughout the union structure. Trump\u2019s populist appeal to American workers in states like Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Ohio was critical to his landslide electoral college victory, when he stunned the   political, financial, and cultural elites in places like New York City, Washington, D. C. and Los Angeles with a 306 electoral vote landslide win over Clinton on Nov. 8. The media and political class have struggled to understand the matter since, with many still refusing to make course corrections after their failures. Trump has met with labor leaders and industry leaders, bringing them together on key issues like trade and fighting corruption \u2014  building an entirely new political coalition while the Democratic Party debates about how far to the extreme left to veer with a race for the Democratic National Committee chairmanship coming down to two extreme progressives, Rep. Keith Ellison ( ) and former Labor Secretary Tom Perez, both of whom oppose good trade deals and immigration controls that Trump and his new coalition support.'"}, "time": 1742563139.5827909}
