He was 92. The   Funeral Home in Dearborn confirmed his death. Schemansky competed across four decades, winning competitions, breaking records and, with his   heaves, leaving spectators in awe. A bear of a man with a mild countenance, he could be instantly picked out of a bevy of musclemen in tights by his signature   eyeglasses, as if Superman had shown up still wearing Clark Kent\u2019s. But there was no disguising his prowess. \u201cNorbert Schemansky is the greatest and strongest athlete I have ever seen,\u201d his Cold War rival and fellow Olympian Yuri Vlasov of Ukraine was quoted as saying. Schemansky himself said, \u201cOne time I figured it out, and I\u2019d lifted enough weight to lift the Queen Mary. \u201d At just under six feet tall and weighing 265 pounds or so, Schemansky had   thighs, wrists like    and, by all accounts, steel in his sinews since childhood. The Detroit Free Press called him \u201cborn strong. \u201d At 11 years old he had gotten a job at a Detroit market unloading   bags of potatoes. He began his Olympic run in 1948 in London, where he won the silver medal in the super heavyweight class. In 1952, in Helsinki, he won the gold in the   class. He missed the 1956 Games, in Melbourne, Australia, while recovering from two back operations to repair damaged disks. But the injuries did not deter him. He returned to the Olympics in 1960, in Rome, to win the bronze as a superheavyweight, and then in 1964, in Tokyo, to bring home the bronze again. In between, he was winning world and national championships and breaking records. In 1964 he became the first man ever to lift a total of 1, 200 pounds: 400 with the press (no longer used in competition) 355 with the snatch and 445 with the clean and jerk. He later exceeded that total, lifting 415, 363 \u00be and 445 (totaling 1, 223 \u00be pounds). An international poll in 1954 ranked him as the fifth greatest athlete in the world. \u201cWhat Muhammad Ali and Joe Louis are to boxing, what John Grimek and Arnold Schwarzenegger mean to bodybuilding, and what Gordie Howe and Wayne Gretzky represent in hockey, Norbert Schemansky is to Olympic weight lifting,\u201d Richard Bak wrote in his 2007 biography of Schemansky, \u201cMr. Weightlifting. \u201d Yet for all his success, Schemansky was consigned to stardom in a sport that drew little notice in the United States. Even his hometown, Dearborn, seemed indifferent, particularly before and after the 1952 Games. \u201cI was working at Briggs Manufacturing, and I asked for time off,\u201d Schemansky told The Detroit News in 2002, \u201cand one of the guys from downstairs said: \u2018Give him all the time off he wants. Fire him. \u2019\u201d Schemansky quit, went to Helsinki and won the gold medal. When he returned home, a gold medal in his bag, no one was there to greet him. Only an airport porter recognized him. \u201cThe bus porter said, \u2018Nice going, Semansky,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cHe mispronounced my name, but he knew who I was. \u201d Schemansky took a bus home alone. It was not an unfamiliar experience. As he told Strength  Health magazine in 1973, \u201cThe worst part of competing was coming home. \u201d Norbert Schemansky was born in Detroit on May 30, 1924, and grew up there, one of four brothers. He started lifting at 15 with an older brother, a national junior champion, and training in a converted   garage. In high school he was a    . In World War II he fought in the Battle of the Bulge. While competing across the country and abroad, he took mostly menial jobs  \u2014   one was cleaning latrines  \u2014   despite a reported I. Q. of 132. Sometimes he was out of a job or took unpaid leave just so he could compete. His straitened circumstances dismayed the sportswriter Mark Kram, who in a sympathetic 1966 profile in Sports Illustrated expressed incredulity that Schemansky had not earned more than $3, 000 in any of the previous eight years, a time when he and his wife, Bernice, were rearing four children and scratching to make payments on their house. \u201cHow can it be,\u201d Kram wrote, \u201cthat a man who has won respect for himself and prestige for his country clings to the shadowy periphery of life, is a nonperson without status or function and one whose wife for most of the last 20 years has, in effect, supported his participation for the U. S. with an $   job?\u201d Schemansky said he had to work because there were no endorsements in his day and no money for athletes. \u201cNot a penny,\u201d he said in 2002, adding, \u201cIf I was competing now, I\u2019d be a millionaire. \u201d The Soviet news agency Tass was quick to recognize Schemansky\u2019s plight as a useful propaganda tool when he and Vlasov met in front of 8, 000 fans in Budapest in 1962 in what was billed as the \u201cheavyweight match of the century. \u201d After Schemansky beat Vlasov in the press and the snatch but lost the match on total points (his ankle collapsed on the final lift) Tass made ideological hay, declaring that \u201cthe story of Schemansky\u201d illustrated \u201cthe attitude toward man in a capitalistic world. \u201d Schemansky retired from competition in 1972 after 26 years of lifting and became a civil engineer for the city of Dearborn, which named a park after him in 1996. He was elected to the National Weightlifting Hall of Fame, the National   Sports Hall of Fame and the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame. His wife died in 1996. He is survived by three daughters, Paula Sperka, Pamela Petro and Laura Rowe a son, Larry 10 grandchildren and 16  . Schemansky could be ambivalent about the fame and fortune that never accrued to him in any great measure. \u201cNorb himself is an anomaly, a man of contradiction,\u201d Strength  Health magazine observed in 1973. \u201cHe appears to disdain recognition, yet he feels he should have it for what he has done. \u201d   years later, his attitude remained the same. \u201cI always thought something good would come out of it,\u201d he said of his career, in an interview with The Detroit Free Press, \u201cbut nothing ever did. I thought it would help me get a better job. When I worked for Stroh\u2019s Brewery, I asked for a salesman\u2019s job. They said, \u2018We\u2019re not hiring athletes.\u2019 Then, a couple of months later, I find out they hired a football player. You give up so much. Yeah, sometimes I wonder why I did it. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562911.642492}
