Then the resumed booms of incoming artillery shells from   forces sent them into hiding or running for their lives. It was the latest    whiplash for the thousands trapped in the ruins of a   northern metropolis, which has come to symbolize the atrocities unfolding in the nearly    war. Under the supposed deal for a   and evacuation  \u2014   announced on Tuesday by Turkey, Russia and Syrian rebels  \u2014   the remaining fighters were to leave Aleppo for   territory farther north and civilians were free to join them or move to   areas. That outcome would leave the whole city in the hands of forces loyal to the Syrian president, Bashar  . The United Nations high commissioner for human rights, Zeid Ra\u2019ad   denounced the resumed shelling, calling it a probable war crime. \u201cThe way this deal was dangled in front of this battered and beleaguered population  \u2014   causing them to hope they might indeed live to see another day  \u2014   and then snatched away just half a day later is also outrageously cruel,\u201d Mr.   said in a statement. \u201cThe Syrian government has a clear responsibility to ensure its people are safe, and is palpably failing to take this opportunity to do so,\u201d he said. As each side blamed the other for the deal\u2019s collapse, civilians inside the city issued anguished, angry pleas for international pressure to reinstate it. The Assad government and Iran, Syria\u2019s other main ally besides Russia, appeared not to have been fully consulted on the deal, according to international officials and others briefed on the talks, and were insisting on new conditions. Rebel groups outside the city resumed shelling   districts in Aleppo. Civilians in other   areas to the north protested against their leaders and ransacked posts of   rebel groups, demanding they help those in Aleppo. Close to midnight Wednesday, rebel groups announced a new deal for another evacuation attempt on Thursday. Trapped civilians expressed disbelief, and the Syrian military denied that another deal had been reached. But by early Thursday the shelling had tapered off, residents reported, hoping the pause would hold. As the shelling escalated Wednesday morning, a radiology nurse in Aleppo, Mohamed   said he hoped the world would hear \u201cour final scream,\u201d adding that the wounded, with rescue and medical services in disarray, were bleeding to death in the streets. Yasser, an accountant volunteering in a makeshift medical clinic, posted a photograph via WhatsApp of an injured girl lying on a hallway floor. She was 10, he said, with broken bones, and was crying and shouting: \u201cGet me out of Aleppo. I am afraid, I am cold. My back is hurting me. Where is the doctor?\u201d Yasser, who asked to be identified only by his first name for fear of being arrested for contacting journalists, said in frustration, \u201cLet us leave  \u2014   what is happening?\u201d Problems with the deal had been evident from the start. Soon after it was announced Tuesday night, Syrian officials said they had no knowledge of it, and there was no word from Iran. Then, around 1 a. m. Wednesday, a convoy of vans carrying dozens of wounded people, including fighters and their families, began making its way out of Aleppo. But the vans returned soon after, witnesses said, after   militiamen blocked the way and said they did not have Syrian government permission. The militiamen said they would not allow anyone out until rebel groups had ended their siege of Fouaa and Kfarya, two encircled Shiite enclaves in Idlib Province. Residents said they were told they could leave at 6 a. m. but as buses idled, the shelling resumed. Opposition leaders and civilians inside Aleppo said they believed that Iran had balked at a deal brokered by Russia. Osama Abu Zayd, a legal adviser to Syrian opposition factions, told The Associated Press that Iran\u2019s field commander in Syria was resisting it. The interests of Mr. Assad\u2019s two main backers, Russia and Iran, do not always dovetail. Iran has a stake in retaining the influence it gained by entering the conflict on behalf of Mr. Assad two years before Russia. Iran has trained, backed and financed the   militias that have bolstered Syrian ground forces, with recruits from Iraq, Afghanistan and other countries, as well as Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite militant group. Yasser, the accountant, said civilians in Aleppo did not approve of rebel shelling of civilians in Fouaa and Kfarya. \u201cWe are humans,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are not our enemies. They are civilians like us. \u201d The Russian Defense Ministry blamed the rebels for the impasse, saying on Wednesday that they had \u201cresumed the hostilities\u201d at dawn, trying to break through Syrian government positions to the northwest. Residents questioned why rebels inside eastern Aleppo would start shooting again when they were about to escape. Later, negotiators said the Syrian government was asking for the release of prisoners and the bodies of dead soldiers, and for rebels to hand over fighters from the   Levant Conquest Front. Government opponents also said they suspected Mr. Assad of stalling. His government has often skillfully played its backers against one another. The wrangling could provide cover to finish off Aleppo\u2019s last rebel enclave with force. As one Syrian military officer told Reuters in Aleppo recently, rebels must \u201csurrender or die. \u201d Troubles carrying out the accord were not surprising, as there was no international monitoring  \u2014   United Nations officials said the Syrian government had refused their repeated pleas to observe  \u2014   and no enforcement provision. The same problems have vexed other deals reached during the conflict. Malek, an activist who said he hoped to join his pregnant wife in northern Aleppo Province, and who asked to be identified only by his first name for fear of retaliation, said the world saw civilians in   territory as \u201cno longer human. \u201d \u201cThey think we are Daesh,\u201d he said via WhatsApp, using an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State, the militant group that has established a   caliphate in parts of Syria but not in Aleppo. Using a mournful expression, he added, \u201cwe didn\u2019t taste the flavor of life. \u201d At the United Nations on Tuesday, Secretary General Ban   said there had been \u201ccredible reports\u201d of atrocities, including extrajudicial killings, as eastern Aleppo was retaken. Russia categorically denied the reports, and Mr. Ban said the world body had been unable to verify them. Dr. Salem Abou   a dentist who had kept his clinic open until last week but finally moved to one of the last rebel neighborhoods when his was taken by government forces, said Wednesday morning that he could hear heavy shelling. \u201cWe slept a quiet night, but sadly the shelling is back,\u201d he said. Later, Dr. Abou   posted a video on Facebook calling for global powers to intervene to push through a deal. \u201cThe situation can\u2019t wait,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone should know, we, the people here, we love life and want to live. \u201d The evacuation plan came after two weeks of rapid advances by the Syrian Army and its allies, who drove insurgents into an   pocket of eastern Aleppo, with support from heavy airstrikes and artillery fire. Rebel groups have received support from Turkey, the United States and Persian Gulf states, but far less than the direct military aid that Iran and Russia have provided to Mr. Assad.'"}, "time": 1742563277.841593}
