Mr. Zorn, 63, a longtime fixture of downtown Manhattan, is known for composing frenzied, explosive music, riots of psychotically bright colors. Martin  \u2014   who lived alone in the New Mexico desert for decades, died in 2004 at 92 and is currently the subject of a quietly majestic retrospective at the Guggenheim Museum  \u2014   made paintings of serene subtlety. Mr. Zorn stated the obvious question as he walked on Monday morning around the Guggenheim\u2019s rotunda, where a series of his   works will be played on Thursday and Friday evenings. \u201cCrazy John Zorn and Agnes Martin, the spiritual, the saint,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere does it connect?\u201d In fact, the connections go back to Mr. Zorn\u2019s teenage years in New York, when he first encountered Martin\u2019s painting \u201cRed Bird,\u201d with faint lines in colored pencil on a   background, at the Museum of Modern Art. \u201cI was completely hypnotized by it,\u201d he said. Martin had by then grown famous for her softly colored grids, but Mr. Zorn found in her art as much passion as precision. \u201cWhen I look at her work, I don\u2019t see horizontal lines,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see a grid. I see a glow. It\u2019s a feeling that\u2019s going on here. \u201d Walking up to one of the paintings at the Guggenheim, he added: \u201cYou see all these minute  \u2014   you could call them mistakes. It\u2019s supposed to be a straight line, but it\u2019s not a straight line. But she accepts those irregularities, the imperfections that make it perfect. That\u2019s improvisation. Playing, and making a mistake, but you keep working with that mistake and it makes it right. \u201d It\u2019s in that spirit of improvisation that Mr. Zorn, with his grounding in jazz, perceives a connection between his work and Martin\u2019s that transcends their obvious differences. (\u201cI can\u2019t just go to the desert and start writing,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not who I am. \u201d) But they share, in his telling, a fundamental focus on their work and a perpetual need for the sensory rejuvenation aloneness brings, whether in the expanses of New Mexico or the chaos of the East Village. \u201cShe lived in a desert environment,\u201d he said. \u201cI live in a city environment. My home is a device to enable creativity. It\u2019s my desert, it\u2019s where I\u2019m going to get those receptors open. \u201d \u201cAs crazy as my work may sound,\u201d he added, \u201ceven at its craziest, there is a spiritual practice going on in the process. \u201d Mr. Zorn long ago gave up on the idea of seriously collecting Martin\u2019s work. (One of her paintings sold at auction this year for more than $10 million.) Instead, he has accumulated old posters for her gallery shows. His musical tributes to her began in the 1990s, when he returned to a few hypnotic, sensuous chords he had created as part of a soundtrack for a lesbian erotic film. Playing with the chords, Mr. Zorn stretched them into a   piece that amplified that mesmerizing quality. He hadn\u2019t been thinking explicitly of Martin while composing, but when he finished, he said, he realized, \u201cOh, this is an Agnes Martin thing. \u201d \u201cHer work has a hypnotic vibe to it, you know,\u201d he added. \u201cIt has introspection. And it flows in a sensual way, and that\u2019s what those chords did. \u201d \u201cRedbird,\u201d as he called the piece, moves forward in a long series of calm yet ominous downbeats and their comet trails of resonance, sprinkled with slight rustles of percussion and the smoky undercurrent of a jazz club. The general stillness quivers with the expectancy of a long Morton Feldman work when \u201cRedbird\u201d came out, some summed it up as \u201cZorn does Feldman. \u201d Translating the order of the chords in \u201cRedbird\u201d into the duration of hits on four bass drums, he created the booming \u201cDark River,\u201d and released the two works together. When the Guggenheim was planning its Martin retrospective (a traveling exhibition that, since the summer of 2015, has visited museums in London D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany and Los Angeles) officials there, having heard \u201cRedbird,\u201d asked Mr. Zorn if he would perform it live. He demurred, believing that the piece, intended to be heard solely in recorded form, wasn\u2019t meant to be revived in person. But he surprised the museum by offering to write something new instead  \u2014   and for free. (Mr. Zorn said that he does not accept commissions, preferring to follow the timetable and subject matter his inspiration dictates.) At the time, he was mulling a piece for the American Brass Quintet. While he usually composes scores in full, all at once, this time he started with a simpler harmonic progression, which he wrote down on a   staff. (Think of piano music.) When it was done, though, it somehow didn\u2019t seem like a brass piece: It felt, instead, like a work for harp. That became \u201cPraise,\u201d which surrounds a harpist with electronics and percussion. Just as Mr. Zorn considers \u201cDark River\u201d a pr\u00e9cis of \u201cRedbird,\u201d so is \u201cPraise\u201d a pr\u00e9cis of \u201cBlue Stratagem,\u201d the piece he eventually made for the brass quintet, featuring the same harmonic motion. Both new works will have their premiere at the Guggenheim this week, alongside \u201cDark River\u201d and \u201cCurling\u201d (1977) one of the   \u201cgame pieces\u201d that Mr. Zorn created early in his career. \u201cRedbird\u201d will play over speakers as the audience tours the exhibition after the concert. It is not the first time Mr. Zorn has occupied a major museum in recent years. This downtown doyen, once an enfant terrible and now an established master, was celebrated at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on his 60th birthday in 2013, as performances of his work sprawled through  the building, an experience that, for this art lover, was, \u201c  \u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m still na\u00efve enough,\u201d he said as he looked closely at a Martin, \u201cto believe that a few marks on a piece of paper can change the world. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561720.225783}
