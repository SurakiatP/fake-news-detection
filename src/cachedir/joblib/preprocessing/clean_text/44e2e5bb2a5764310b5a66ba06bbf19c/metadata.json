[In a hastily arranged meeting on Capitol Hill, the Republican conference scrambled to kill the rules changes proposal before a scheduled vote and after   Donald Trump publicly ridiculed them for their   timing on the issue.  Other tough ethics organizations, including Judicial Watch, criticized the proposed rule changes. \u201cThe American people will see this latest push to undermine congressional ethics enforcement as shady and corrupt,\u201d Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said in a statement. \u201cThe full House should seriously consider whether it wants to bear the brunt of public outrage and go through with the rule change this afternoon. \u201d Democrats and the media piled on as well, ridiculing Republicans for trying to weaken the panel despite many of them campaigning to drain the swamp. \u201cRepublicans claim they want to \u2018drain the swamp,\u2019 but the night before the new Congress gets sworn in, the House GOP has eliminated the only independent ethics oversight of their actions,\u201d House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement. \u201cEvidently, ethics are the first casualty of the new Republican Congress. \u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan was vocally opposed to the proposed reforms, according to a senior congressional source, but he ultimately failed to lead Republicans away from the public relations disaster that ensued. Republicans were split about the proposed changes, according to House sources. Some agreed that there were reforms needed to change the anonymous nature of the ethics accusations and leaks of investigations to the media, others thought that the reforms went too far. Many Republicans ultimately agreed that the timing of the reforms looked bad. Speaker Ryan tried to defend the reforms in a statement on Tuesday morning, before ultimately calling a meeting to revisit the proposition. The Republican conference unanimously agreed to cancel the changes, according to reports.'"}, "time": 1742562188.587901}
