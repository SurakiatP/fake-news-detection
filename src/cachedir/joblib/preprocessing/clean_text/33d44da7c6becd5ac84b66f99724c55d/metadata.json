Chao, a veteran cabinet secretary who has served under two Republican presidents, offered remarkably few specifics but many promises of cooperation on Wednesday as she cruised through her confirmation hearing to become transportation secretary. Democrats on the Senate committee charged with reviewing Ms. Chao\u2019s nomination by   Donald J. Trump made it clear that they have no objections to her, suggesting that she will be easily confirmed in a full Senate vote. Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, the top Democrat on the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, praised Ms. Chao for acting with \u201cgrace and excellence\u201d in her previous government service. \u201cI certainly look forward to you, in this new administration, doing the same,\u201d he said. Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and the committee\u2019s chairman, called her \u201can ideal candidate. \u201d Ms. Chao spent most of the   hearing promising to examine and learn more about drones, fuel efficiency standards, air traffic control services and many other subjects that may soon be part of her portfolio. With most of the spotlight falling on Mr. Trump\u2019s desire for a major infrastructure overhaul  \u2014   in his own words, a priority for his first 100 days in office that could cost $1 trillion  \u2014   Ms. Chao vowed to keep senators informed of emerging plans. She called the overhaul \u201ca heavy lift\u201d that would require cooperation both between the parties and between Congress and the administration. \u201cAs the infrastructure proposal is being put together, we will certainly be in great discussion with the Congress, because, once again, we can\u2019t do it on our own,\u201d she said. The selection of Ms. Chao to lead the Transportation Department and its $75 billion budget stands out in the lineup of largely billionaire business executives Mr. Trump has nominated to populate his cabinet. She served as labor secretary for the duration of George W. Bush\u2019s administration and as a deputy transportation secretary under the elder George Bush. Ms. Chao vowed on Wednesday to work with lawmakers on a host of transportation issues  \u2014   including maritime infrastructure and positive train control, a safety system intended to prevent collisions. Emphasizing the need to revitalize the nation\u2019s transportation infrastructure, Ms. Chao called for creativity to fund improvements. Asked whether Mr. Trump would support including federal spending in his infrastructure package, she said, \u201cI believe the answer is yes. \u201d Support for federal infrastructure funding could put the Trump administration on a collision course with congressional Republicans, who have been reluctant or even openly hostile to increasing domestic spending in recent years. Ms. Chao offered few other funding solutions, though she did propose turning to more   partnerships, referencing the potential capital available from \u201cequity firms, pension funds and endowments. \u201d That seemed to raise concern from Mr. Nelson, who cautioned against the privatization of government services, alluding to a possible point of friction between Democrats and the incoming Trump administration. Since leaving public service, Ms. Chao has joined the boards of Wells Fargo, News Corporation and Vulcan Materials, among others  \u2014   positions she said she would resign from if confirmed. However, according to documents she filed with the Office of Government Ethics, Ms. Chao will continue for a time to receive payments under financial agreements with Vulcan, which makes construction supplies, and Wells Fargo as she severs her ties with them the payments from Wells Fargo stocks will continue through March 2021. She has agreed to recuse herself from matters involving those companies. Though Wells Fargo came under fire late last year for its business practices, senators did not ask her to elaborate on her continued ties with the embattled company. There was a notably cozy, familiar tone to much of the hearing, as senators questioned a nominee with close ties to one of their own: Ms. Chao is the wife of the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky. Praising Ms. Chao as \u201cincredibly capable\u201d in his introduction, Mr. McConnell cheekily endorsed Mr. Trump\u2019s pick. \u201cShe\u2019s got really great judgment, on a whole variety of things,\u201d he said. To capture his feelings, Mr. McConnell turned to the words of a previous Republican senator whose spouse was a transportation and labor secretary, paraphrasing what Bob Dole once said about his wife, Elizabeth. \u201cI feel a little bit like Nathan Hale,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201c\u2018I regret that I have but one wife to give for my country. \u2019\u201d Ms. Chao said, \u201cI will be working to lock in the majority leader\u2019s support tonight over dinner. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564296.7412996}
