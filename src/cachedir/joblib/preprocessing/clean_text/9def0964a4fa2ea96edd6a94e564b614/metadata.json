His ill-conceived lie has propelled the progressive filmmaker\u2019s \u2018October Surprise\u2019 movie straight to the very top of the iTunes charts with almost 8 million views today, prompting the famed filmmaker to embark on a tweetstorm mocking the Trump supporters for helping shine the spotlight on his film. Righties\\'ve doctored clip from my film 2 make it look pro-Trump. 7.9M views! Sending millions 2 iTunes!

Haha. Pls don\\'t tell them otherwise! #satire #irony pic.twitter.com/difR93uzTg \\n\u2014 Michael Moore (@MMFlint) October 26, 2016 \\nSnopes had already busted Milo\u2019s gross misrepresentation, which used audio from Moore\u2019s movie without context or follow through to make it appear as if Moore had endorsed Trump \u2013 a charge which Moore has loudly debunked. \\nFirst of all, I make it very clear: I wrote a chapter in my very first book 20 years ago [1996\u2019s Downsize This! ] called \u201cMy Forbidden Love for Hillary.\u201d There\u2019s nothing to come around on. I was for Hillary before Hillary was for Hillary. I didn\u2019t go to convert Trump people. I did not want the racists or the crazies in there or we would have never gotten the show done. But we went to union halls and guys that I grew up with \u2014 people who normally vote Democrat who are thinking of voting for Trump. That is a huge chunk of the population, especially where I\u2019m from. So I wasn\u2019t there so much to convert them away. I don\u2019t think a lot of them necessarily decided for sure that they were going to vote for him. But I want them to think about the damage they could do by being a legal terrorist on November 8th. \\nThat didn\u2019t stop Milo from broadcasting this video containing a clip from Moore\u2019s movie which has gotten over 6 million views, but without publishing the entire narrative which explained how a vote for Trump might feel good in the short term like Brexiteers imagined their votes might feel this past summer. Moore\u2019s point is that Trump\u2019s populist rhetoric sounds good, but his economic ideas and 19th century tariffs would be terribly damaging to American business, and ultimately to workers. \\nIf you keep watching the movie immediately after the part that Milo cited, then you would actually hear this dire warning by Michael Moore about the abject danger of electing the Republican candidate who\u2019d like to end the First Amendment, destroy America\u2019s economy and bring Jim Crow out of the dark past of the deep south and parade him around the entire United States. This is how Moore described the severe buyer\u2019s remorse felt by Brexit voters: \\n[Voting for Trump will feel good] for a day. Maybe a week. Possibly a month. And then. Like the Brits, who wanted to send a message, so they voted to leave Europe only to find out that if you vote to leave Europe you, actually have to leave Europe. And now they regret it. All the Ohioans, Pennsylvanians, Michiganders and Wisconsinites of Middle England, right, they all voted to leave and now they regret it. \\nAnd over 4 million of them signed a petition to have a do-over, they want another election, but It\u2019s not going to happen. Because you used the ballot as an anger management tool. And now you\u2019re fucked. And the rest of Europe. They\u2019re like, Bye Felicia. So when the rightfully angry people of Ohio and Michigan and Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin find out after a few months in office that President Trump wasn\u2019t going to do a damn thing for them, it will be too late to do anything about it. \\nBut I get it. You wanted to send a message. You had righteous anger. And justifiable anger. Well, message sent. Goodnight America. You\u2019ve just elected the last president of the United States. \\nOnce again a simple fact check shows that a widely conservative writer is lying to his audience by taking video out of context to make an argument that is entirely divorced from the actual facts. Michael Moore would never endorse a candidate like Donald Trump or his Republican friends that share his values and lie to America\u2019s working people about their multi-decade campaign to deliver more money to the top 1% of American households at the expense of 99% of our country\u2019s population.'"}, "time": 1742628457.4872878}
