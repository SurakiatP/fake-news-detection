We\u2019ve seen this with Al-Qaeda, and various documents that have tied them to U.S. intelligence agencies like the CIA. We\u2019ve also seen a lot of shady circumstances surrounding the \u201cterrorist\u201d attacks that occurred on 9/11; the evidence alone has approximately half of the American people believing it was an inside job \u2013 a simple Google search of the polls will show you that, and for the evidence we are referring to, you can access our articles on that topic here . \u201cAll three buildings were destroyed by carefully planned, orchestrated and executed controlled demolition.\u201d \u2013 Professor Lynn Margulis, Department of Geosciences, University of Massachusetts at Amherst and National Academy of Science member, one of many academics who has been very outspoken regarding 9/11 ( source ) ( source ) All of this activity continues to be used as more justification for a heightened national security state, one in which citizens are being forced to give up their freedoms and privacy in order to be \u201cprotected\u201d from such attacks. The entire national security state would crumble if people found out that it was their own government perpetrating these attacks, and this realization is finally beginning to leave the realm of conspiracy and enter into the realm of reality in the minds of the masses. It\u2019s about time. \u201cMost terrorists are false flag terrorists, or are created by our own security services. In the United States, every single terrorist incident we have had has been a false flag, or has been an informant pushed on by the FBI. In fact, we now have citizens taking out restraining orders against FBI informants that are trying to incite terrorism. We\u2019ve become a lunatic asylum.\u201d \u2013 David Steele, a 20-year Marine Corps intelligence officer, and the second-highest-ranking civilian in the U.S. Marine Corps Intelligence ( source )   The \u201cterrorists\u201d we are pointing our fingers at (or so I believe, along with many others, after having done careful research) are a creation of Western intelligence, used to justify the infiltration of other countries for ulterior motives. Those who usually do not believe that, almost one hundred percent of the time have not actually done any research, or examined the information for themselves. This is the power mainstream media has over us \u2013 if something is depicted on television, it\u2019s instantly believed without question. Any other explanation which does not come from a major mainstream media outlet (like CNN, for example), or fit the framework of accepted knowledge, seems to be met with harsh resistance. This resistance comes despite the fact that a tremendous amount of evidence is available in the form of videos, documents, and whistle-blowers, yet a large majority of people still refuse to do any research for themselves, or again, believe something contrary to what Western media is telling them. \u201cThe truth is, there is no Islamic army or terrorist group called Al-Qaeda, and any informed intelligence officer knows this. But, there is a propaganda campaign to make the public believe in the presence of an intensified entity representing the \u2018devil\u2019 only in order to drive TV watchers to accept a unified international leadership for a war against terrorism. The country behind this propaganda is the United States.\u201d \u2013 Former British Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook \\n '"}, "time": 1742561774.2401955}
