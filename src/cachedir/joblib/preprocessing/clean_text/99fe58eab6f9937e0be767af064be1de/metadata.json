Moreover, Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201ccrew\u201d supposedly includes not just close aide and confidante Huma Abedin and her husband, Weiner, but other aides and insiders \u2014 and even members of Congress. Reports True Pundit : \\nNYPD sources said these new emails include evidence linking Clinton herself and associates to: \u2022 Money laundering \u2022 Sex crimes with minors (children) \u2022 Perjury \u2022 Pay to play through Clinton Foundation \u2022 Obstruction of justice \u2022 Other felony crimes \\nNYPD detectives and a [sic] NYPD Chief, the department\u2019s highest rank under Commissioner, said openly that if the FBI and Justice Department fail to garner timely indictments against Clinton and co- conspirators, NYPD will go public with the damaging emails now in the hands of FBI Director James Comey and many FBI field offices. \\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in the emails is staggering and as a father, it turned my stomach,\u201d the NYPD Chief said. \u201cThere is not going to be any Houdini-like escape from what we found. We have copies of everything. We will ship them to Wikileaks or I will personally hold my own press conference if it comes to that.\u201d \\nThese revelations would explain why Director Comey reopened the investigation into Clinton\u2019s mishandling of classified information, a move that shook the political world and caused Comey to come under fire. As the NYPD chief put it, the new e-mails contents truly are \u201calarming.\u201d \\nTrue Pundit also reports FBI sources as stating that Abedin and Weiner are both trying to cut immunity deals with federal officials and that, if they didn\u2019t cooperate, they\u2019d face long prison sentences. Abedin\u2019s turning state\u2019s evidence would no doubt be devastating for Clinton, as the two women have for years been joined at the hip. Abedin has at times been like Clinton\u2019s shadow, has been called her \u201cbody woman,\u201d and has even been rumored to be Clinton\u2019s lesbian lover. So Abedin likely knows where, as is said, the bodies are buried. \\nOf particular note, the new e-mails allegedly contain information revealing that Hillary, Bill Clinton, Weiner, and numerous congressmen took trips to convicted billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s private island, where he is said to pimp out underage minors of both sexes to prominent people. The trips were taken aboard Epstein\u2019s Boeing 747, dubbed the \u201cLolita Express\u201d; the pedophile\u2019s island, in the US Virgin Islands, has been called \u201c Sex Slave Island .\u201d \\nThese revelations would also explain why Clinton used powerful software called BleachBit to scrub damning information from her private server. According to BleachBit\u2019s website, its program gives criminals and others the ability to \u201cshred files to hide their contents and prevent data recovery.\u201d \\nYet it can\u2019t scrub bumbling perverts from your personal life, and Weiner\u2019s laptop also contains incriminating e-mails revealing the mishandling of classified information by Abedin and Clinton, say the sources. Both women \u201csent and received thousands of classified and top secret documents to personal email accounts,\u201d and this information could have been \u201caccessed, printed, discussed, leaked, or distributed by untold numbers \u2026 of unknown individuals,\u201d writes True Pundit . \\nConsequently, FBI sources say the new Clinton investigation has been broadened and now includes matters such as how, informs True Pundit : \u2022 Abedin forwarded classified and top secret State Department emails to Weiner\u2019s email \u2022 Abedin stored emails, containing government secrets, in a special folder shared with Weiner warehousing over 500,000 archived State Department emails. \u2022 Weiner had access to these classified and top secret documents without proper security clearance to view the records \u2022 Abedin also used a personal yahoo address and her Clintonemail.com address to send/receive/store classified and top secret documents \u2022 [a] private consultant managed Weiner\u2019s site for the last six years, including three years when Clinton was secretary of state, and therefore, had full access to all emails as the domain\u2019s listed registrant and administrator via Whois email contacts. \\nThis story just adds more intrigue to a presidential campaign that is truly unprecedented, with a torrent of WikiLeaks and Project Veritas revelations and now Clinton\u2019s Weiner woes. From vote fraud to inciting violence to child sex abuse to pay-for-play to perjury, it\u2019s becoming clear to many that the Democratic Party \u2014 and the Clintons in particular \u2014 are essentially a criminal syndicate. \\nAs former assistant FBI director James Kallstrom said in a Sunday interview, \u201cThe Clintons, that\u2019s a crime family, basically. It\u2019s like organized crime. I mean the Clinton Foundation is a cesspool\u2026. God forbid we put someone like that [Clinton] in the White House.\u201d And now we know better why, as I wrote Sunday, this \u201cappears standard FBI sentiment. I personally know of an ex-agent \u2014 someone with knowledge of Clinton \u2018crime family\u2019 dealings \u2014 who I\u2019m told is having trouble sleeping at night due to the prospect of a Clinton presidency.\u201d \\nAll these revelations raise important questions: How could Hillary Clinton and her cohorts have bumbled so badly that they appear a cross between Inspector Clouseau and Boss Tweed ? \\nAnd if Clinton is so careless with her own personal survival, how can she be trusted with national survival? \\nPart of the explanation is general incompetence, yet there\u2019s another factor: Both Clintons have engaged in continual criminality over the decades \u2014 and have been allowed to skate at every turn. This lack of accountability has led to complacency and ever-increasing brazenness, just as with a child never punished for wrongdoing. \\nSo, finally, perhaps, Clinton corruption has reached critical mass. And with Donald Trump ahead 10 points (according to one respected poll) among the 88 percent of voters who have definitely made up their minds, maybe, come late Tuesday evening, some tossing and turning FBI agents will finally be able to enjoy a good night\u2019s rest.
