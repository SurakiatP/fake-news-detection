In tiny storefronts and suburban megachurches, worshipers mourned the deaths of five Dallas police officers at the hands of an   sniper who was aiming to kill white officers at a demonstration against police violence. They also grieved for two   men killed in shootings by the police in Baton Rouge, La. and Minnesota. Some prayed for the souls of the men who pulled the triggers. Some thanked God for the sacrifices the police made daily to protect their cities. Some thanked God for the technology that allowed the world to see controversial acts of police violence toward  . At St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in New York, Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan spoke of a country \u201cworried, frustrated and fatigued over senseless violence. \u201d \u201cFrom Minnesota to Louisiana and Texas, one nation under God examines its soul,\u201d he said. \u201cSadness and heaviness is especially present in our   and law enforcement communities. \u201d The turbulence felt close, sometimes distressingly so, for many churchgoers. Protests had roiled the streets of San Francisco, Chicago, New York and Philadelphia, among other cities, hours before sunrise. In Dallas, drivers had to maneuver on Sunday morning around a   crime scene that remained closed off in the heart of downtown, where Micah Johnson, a    former Army reservist, used a semiautomatic weapon last week to kill the five officers and wound seven others, as well as two civilians, before the police killed him with a   explosive device. A few blocks from the scene, Mayor Mike Rawlings of Dallas gave an interview on Sunday on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d posing questions about his city that many Americans, Christian and   alike, had begun asking about the nation as a whole. \u201cCan we, in a moment of crisis, when officers are fallen, forgive?\u201d Mr. Rawlings said. \u201cCan we disagree without demonizing? Can we see a better narrative, as opposed to just absurdity, that there\u2019s redemption as we build this great city?\u201d Mr. Rawlings, who is white, also attended a service at the Potter\u2019s House Church, the huge Dallas congregation led by the   televangelist T . D. Jakes. The service was more of a town hall event promising \u201ctools on reconciling and moving forward. \u201d The city\u2019s police chief, David O. Brown, and other officers were in attendance. Among the panelists and   participants were relatives of Alton Sterling, the black man killed in Louisiana, and the girlfriend of Philando Castile, the black motorist shot to death in Minnesota. Nine miles away, on the outskirts of South Dallas, Pastor Frederick Douglass Haynes III addressed a congregation of hundreds, most of them black, at   Baptist Church. He told them he was not interested in preaching a message of reconciliation if that did not come with change, or of healing if that simply meant patching over the injustice that had led to last week\u2019s violence. \u201cWe can\u2019t have normal church today,\u201d he said, explaining that he was tired of delivering services after such tragedies, naming Tamir Rice, Walter Scott and Eric Garner. Calling the nation a racial powder keg, Pastor Haynes said, \u201cYou won\u2019t have unity as long as you have structured injustice. \u201d \u201cThe Bible says injustice is a sin,\u201d he added. \u201cThe Bible says oppression is a sin. \u201d Pastor Haynes\u2019s daughter was at the Dallas protest on Thursday night and was   with him from her phone when the shooting began. Pastor Haynes, who said he had watched his daughter\u2019s proud smile transform into screams, struck out at those trying to blame the advocacy group Black Lives Matter for the attack, calling it \u201cracist gall. \u201d \u201cThat was a peaceful march,\u201d he said. \u201cPolice and protesters were taking selfies. \u201d At Watermark Community Church in Dallas, those who dropped off their children for Sunday school walked by the place where Sgt. Michael J. Smith had stood for years, sometimes on Sundays, sometimes during the week, by the glass doors leading to the preschool classrooms. He had been there the previous Sunday, but he was not there for this one. Sergeant Smith, who provided security at the church while off duty and was also a member, was one of the sniper\u2019s victims on Thursday night. That evening, Watermark\u2019s senior pastor, Todd Wagner, posted a letter online to Dallas residents. The city, he said, was \u201ca war zone. \u201d \u201cAs part of that war, darkness has been growing in our country because for some time leaders and citizens alike have mocked\u201d the light of God, he wrote. Onstage Sunday, Pastor Wagner reiterated that theme but also called for a greater sense of understanding among the races. \u201cThey very first time I heard \u2018Black lives matter,\u2019 I was like: \u2018What? Why would you make such a racist statement? \u2019\u201d Pastor Wagner, who is white, said during an impassioned sermon. Later, he said, he realized that he needed to listen to those making the declaration, try to understand the source of their hurt, love them and preach the Gospel. Others, he said, would be wise to do the same  \u2014   to respond to \u201cBlack lives matter\u201d with \u201cLet me understand your pain,\u201d and to show \u201cthat white men do care. \u201d In Baton Rouge, about 20 worshipers, nearly all of them black, gathered at the Ark of Safety, a storefront church sometimes attended by relatives of Mr. Sterling, who was selling CDs in a parking lot before he was killed by the police on Tuesday. The Rev. Tommie Gordon told congregants that if they trusted in the world, they would be lost  \u2014   that if they demanded justice from the world, they would be lost. \u201cWhen things are going wrong, people always want to shout about it,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody\u2019s going to listen. This is the time to get on your knees and pray. \u201d There is nothing wrong with lawful protest, he said. But he added, more than once, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen Jesus at a protest. \u201d Brandon Lee, 22, who knew Mr. Sterling and whose father bought CDs from him, expressed a belief that did not exactly echo the message of the service. \u201cI just really feel like it starts with man,\u201d he said, speaking of the need for justice. \u201cIf you fix man, you fix the world. \u201d Elsewhere, easy answers seemed equally difficult to come by. At Nativity Lutheran Church in St. Anthony, Minn. not far from where Officer Jeronimo Yanez shot and killed Mr. Castile, the Rev. Glenn Seefeldt called for prayers for both men. \u201cWe want to be able to be a part of the solution, not a part of the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cBut where do we start?\u201d Pastor Seefeldt, whose congregation is mostly white, mentioned \u201cwhite privilege\u201d and urged members to think deeply about their actions and hidden biases. \u201cI have a real and tremendous guilt response,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat have I done to contribute to racism as a white male?\u201d This peculiar and tangled American moment seemed even more vexing for Rose Tolbert, 58, a member of the   church in Dallas. Ms. Tolbert works for the Dallas County Sheriff\u2019s Department and has two sons in law enforcement. Ms. Tolbert is also   and she had wanted to attend Thursday\u2019s protest in a stand against police killings of black men but had to work that night. When she got news of the shootings, she called to make sure her family was O. K. Then she fell asleep crying over the tragedy that had befallen her fellow law enforcement officers. At the same time, she remained devastated by the deaths of Mr. Sterling and Mr. Castile. On Sunday morning, her preacher invited her to the altar for a special prayer for law enforcement officers and their families, for protesters, and for children who he said were being traumatized by violence. Ms. Tolbert went to the altar, then returned with tears streaming down her face. \u201cI needed consolation  \u2014   I needed the word from God,\u201d she said, her voice breaking. She paused and then collapsed against a pole in the church lobby, sobbing. \u201cI came here to get refilled,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to pray and get active. We need to stand up. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562889.4333487}
