He said : \\n\u201cIf Donald Trump takes people\u2019s anger and turns it against Muslims, Hispanics, African Americans and women, we will be his worst nightmare.\u201d \\nAnd from what was just announced, it seems that Sanders has every intention of making good on that warning. Earlier today, the Vermont Senator was named chair of outreach during a closed-door Senate Democrat caucus meeting, according to The Hill . In his new role, Sanders will lead outreach to blue-collar voters \u2014 the very voters who became Trump supporters this year. Sanders will also be the ranking member on the Senate Budget Committee. Acknowledging that he has a \u201cheavy responsibility to help shape the priorities of the United States government,\u201d Sanders said: \u201cI\u2019m going to do everything that I can to make sure that the budget that leaves the United States Congress is a budget that represents the needs of working families and a shrinking middle class and not billionaires.\u201d With the announcement of Sanders\u2019 new position, Trump is definitely going to be a nervous wreck. He\u2019s spent his entire presidential campaign claiming that he would help the working class, and now Sanders is in the position to challenge him and hold him to it for the next four years. By elevating Sanders to this new role, Democrats are moving to a more grassroots message, fully aware that Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign and vision for America resonated with many voters. As we saw with Sanders\u2019 popularity in the primaries, the Vermont Senator struck a nerve with workers and families, making him the perfect candidate to go up against Trump as he takes office. Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) commented on Sanders\u2019 new responsibility: \u201cWe want to expand on that, and he will be reaching out to all our allies. We have a tremendous amount of talent in our caucus and we want to make sure everyone is contributing.\u201d Sanders hardly needed this promotion to upset Trump, as he\u2019s been one of the most outspoken politicians on Twitter since Trump\u2019s win: Twitter Twitter Twitter \\nHowever, Sanders\u2019 new role is great news for our country, and we know he\u2019s going to give Trump hell. \\nFeatured image via Zach Gibson and Alex Wong / Getty Images Share this Article!
