The German director Maren Ade discovered a muse for her latest, the sensational \u201cToni Erdmann\u201d  \u2014   a critical favorite at the 69th Cannes Film Festival  \u2014   in an American comic who died in 1984: \u201cI fell in love with Andy Kaufman. \u201d Maren Ade (pronounced    ) also fell for Kaufman\u2019s most outrageous creation, the belligerent insult comic Tony Clifton, whose first name she borrowed for the title character of her new movie. Toni is the fabrication of Winfried (Peter Simonischek) a music teacher who uses this outsize persona to infiltrate the life of his only child, Ines (Sandra H\u00fcller) a corporate strategist on assignment in Bucharest. Toni emerges after Winfried pays a brief, awkward visit to Ines, who barely makes time for her father. Exit Winfried, enter Toni, a lout with a wolfish leer, a fright wig and false teeth who claims to be a \u201cconsultant and coach\u201d for the chief executive of Ines\u2019s company. \u201cToni Erdmann\u201d quickly lifted the festival mood and Ms. Ade\u2019s international profile, though it was shut out on awards night. \u201cIt\u2019s nice and weird at the same time,\u201d she said of the attention the day after her movie\u2019s first press screening. While here, she racked up 30 hours of interviews with 60 journalists from more than 15 countries. Seated on a terrace in the festival headquarters overlooking a   marina, she seemed remarkably at ease, especially given that she had been working on the movie days before the festival opened. \u201cIt was very, very crazy to just get it here. \u201d We met again a few days later in a small Italian restaurant. She was at once alert and relaxed, although also hoarse, either from all the interviews or, she thought, tending to her   . She had brought both her sons  \u2014   the other is 6 months old  \u2014   along with her partner and assorted grandparents. That afternoon, she and her family planned to take a boat to a nearby island for a break before heading to a friend\u2019s house. Sipping warm milk with honey to soothe her throat, and speaking in English, she seemed pleased by the praise, if somewhat exasperated that the movie had been described as arriving out of the blue. \u201cIn your own life,\u201d Ms. Ade said, \u201cnothing is out of the blue. \u201d Some of this surprise doubtless stems from the movie\u2019s comedy, a quality not always associated with German cinema, especially in a temple of seriousness like Cannes. In addition, until now, Ms. Ade, 39, has been largely known only inside rarefied cinephile circles and it has been seven years since her last feature, \u201cEveryone Else. \u201d Since then, she has produced movies and had her children she was pregnant with one son while writing \u201cToni Erdmann\u201d and pregnant with the second while working on it in postproduction. As she once put it, \u201cI became a mother, which is also like making one film at least. \u201d The textured realism in \u201cToni Erdmann\u201d also needed time. \u201cIt took long to develop the characters and to really find that story,\u201d Ms. Ade said. \u201cIt came step by step, going deeper and deeper into the game they\u2019re playing. \u201d As a character, Toni enables Winfried to insinuate himself into Ines\u2019s   life. He barges into her workplace and social events, becoming a classic trickster, that mischievous, subversive figure who upends the status quo. Lewis Hyde, a scholar of tricksters, argues that they emerge from need: \u201cThere are large, devouring forces in this world, and that trickster\u2019s intelligence arose not just to feed himself but to outwit these other eaters. \u201d With a demented smile and oversize teeth, Toni the trickster sets out to sabotage the forces devouring his daughter. Most obviously, \u201cToni Erdmann\u201d is a   story, if one thankfully without the familiar therapeutic platitudes and psychological tidiness. Ms. Ade had been interested in the   dynamic \u201cfor a long time,\u201d she said. \u201cI found out that during writing it\u2019s difficult to escape your own family. \u201d The inspiration for Toni\u2019s teeth came from a gag set she was given at a premiere of \u201cAustin Powers\u201d when she was 20 and working for a production house. She gave the teeth to her father, who she knew would make good use of them, and together they, with Andy Kaufman and Tony Clifton, became part of her exploration of role playing. \u201cToni Erdmann\u201d is only Ms. Ade\u2019s third feature, after \u201cThe Forest for the Trees\u201d (2003) and \u201cEveryone Else,\u201d which shared the Silver Bear (second place) at the 2009 Berlin Film Festival. Ms. Ade began making amateur movies with a camcorder when she was a teenager and attended the University of Television and Film Munich. There, she and another student, Janine Jackowski, founded Komplizen Film, which produces Ms. Ade\u2019s work along with those of other   names like Miguel Gomes. (A third partner, Jonas Dornbach, joined Komplizen in 2010.) Having her own company, Ms. Ade said, gives her the freedom she wants  \u2014   and the control she seems to like  \u2014   including the luxury to rehearse on location. \u201cEverything had to come out of the characters,\u201d Ms. Ade said. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s also why the film needs time. \u201d The movie runs a comfortable, perfectly calibrated two hours and 42 minutes, although she did try to shorten it. \u201cI went back into the editing room three weeks after giving birth, because I wanted to be sure that it\u2019s the right length. \u201d But when she tried to cut it, she felt the movie lost its complexity. It makes sense. Ms. Ade is a pointillist, and over the span of \u201cToni Erdmann,\u201d you don\u2019t only watch Ines and Winfried, you also learn to read their looks, to inhabit their silences and to recognize the weight of their seemingly meaningless moments. Last November, after her second son was born, Ms. Ade sat down with her   and asked them to be honest about whether the film had a shot at being selected for Cannes. It\u2019s an index of this event\u2019s significance to a filmmaker like Ms. Ade, whose importance isn\u2019t measured in box office numbers, that she powered ahead to finish the movie by the festival\u2019s deadline. Her persistence and work paid off, because long after this year\u2019s juries have disbanded and the world has forgotten who won this year\u2019s awards, the 2016 edition will best be remembered as the year Ms. Ade gave us \u201cToni Erdmann,\u201d a work of great beauty, great feeling and great cinema.'"}, "time": 1742561779.3068871}
