As the   titans Marvel and DC, having already colonized movie theaters, take over ever larger chunks of television and streaming video, they\u2019ve wisely started to mix things up. A new series set in one of their superhero universes just might be capeless, or bring in costumed crime fighters as window dressing. Marvel\u2019s \u201cJessica Jones\u201d on Netflix largely takes the form of a noirish mystery, while its \u201cLegion\u201d on FX (beginning next week) looks like a surrealist psychological thriller. \u201cPowers\u201d on the PlayStation Network is essentially \u201cLaw  Order: Superhumans. \u201d Perhaps the least superheroish superhero show, though, is NBC\u2019s new \u201cPowerless\u201d (beginning Thursday). It\u2019s a comedy, for one thing, part of a small tradition that includes \u201cThe Tick\u201d and the campy,   1960s \u201cBatman. \u201d (A promo for the show is narrated by that   Batman, Adam West.) And it\u2019s set in a particularly nonheroic corner of the DC universe: the drab offices of Wayne Security, where a cousin of Batman oversees a motley crew designing products that keep civilians from becoming collateral damage in superhero battles. It\u2019s a nifty, layered premise. For one thing, it\u2019s a dig at the big, soulless tentpole movies in which teams of heroes lay waste to cities full of screaming little humans, particularly the \u201cAvengers\u201d films from DC\u2019s rival, Marvel. Seen from another angle  \u2014   as a traditional workplace sitcom  \u2014   the       angle works just as well. What office doesn\u2019t make people feel powerless? It\u2019s hard to judge how that premise will be developed, though, because NBC made only one episode available for review. (The pilot was originally commissioned in 2015, and since then the show\u2019s creator, Ben Queen, has left.) It\u2019s quirky and pleasant but not terribly funny, and the comic situations are standard office sitcom: The new supervisor is hazed the disgruntled workers sort out into nice, mean and wacky stereotypes the boss spends all his time trying to get his cousin Bruce on the phone. Vanessa Hudgens (\u201cSpring Breakers\u201d) stars as the company\u2019s relentlessly perky new head of RD, but if the show succeeds it will be because of an ensemble that includes distinctive performers like Alan Tudyk as the feckless Van Wayne and Danny Pudi, Ron Funches and Christina Kirk as the cranky workers waiting to be whipped into shape. In the pilot, costumed heroes appear only in the amusing credits sequence and in an opening on an elevated train that plays like an  \u2019    scene from a Hollywood musical. Add a few songs, and it could be from \u201cMeet Me in St. Louis,\u201d except for the supervillain tearing up the train tracks and the superhero  \u2014   an actual DC character, Crimson Fox  \u2014   who saves the day. It\u2019s clever and invigorating, and about the only thing in the pilot that actually makes the connection between office workers and superheroes. \u201cPowerless\u201d is a cute idea for a show, but it will need a lot more scenes like that to turn into a worthwhile series.'"}, "time": 1742562332.6206708}
