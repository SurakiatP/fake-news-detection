[After his weekly Angelus prayer Sunday in Saint Peter\u2019s Square, the pontiff said that he joined the Italian Bishops in \u201csupporting bold educational action in favor of human life. Every life is sacred!\u201d  \u201cLet us promote the culture of life in response to the logic of disposability and a declining population,\u201d he said. \u201cLet us join together and pray for babies who are in danger of being aborted, as well as for people who are at the end of life. All life is sacred!\u201d he said. \u201cLet no one be left alone and may love defend the meaning of life. \u201d Pope Francis has been a vocal critic of abortion, calling it a \u201chorrendous crime,\u201d similar to Mafia murders and the slaughter of the innocents by King Herod 2000 years ago. The Pope also quoted Mother Teresa on Sunday, whom he declared to be a saint last September: \u201cLife is beauty, admire it life is life, defend it!\u201d before adding, \u201cboth for the child about to be born, and the person who is close to death: all life is sacred!\u201d In last fall\u2019s canonization ceremony, Pope Francis stressed Mother Teresa\u2019s commitment to the poorest of the poor, especially unborn children threatened by abortion. \u201cMother Teresa, in all aspects of her life, was a generous dispenser of divine mercy,\u201d the Pope said in his homily before the more than 100, 000 people overflowing Saint Peter\u2019s Square, \u201cmaking herself available for everyone through her welcome and defense of human life, those unborn and those abandoned and discarded. \u201d \u201cShe was committed to defending life, ceaselessly proclaiming that \u2018the unborn are the weakest, the smallest, the most vulnerable,\u2019\u201d he added. On Sunday, Francis sent a special greeting to all who work for   causes, with his wish \u201cthat they may be capable of building a society that is welcoming and worthy for every person. \u201d Follow Thomas D.
