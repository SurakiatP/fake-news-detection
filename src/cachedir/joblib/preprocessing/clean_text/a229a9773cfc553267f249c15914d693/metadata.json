Johnson in 1964. The third comes Wednesday afternoon, when the magazine posted an editorial endorsing Hillary Clinton for president and dismissing Donald J. Trump as \u201cthe most ostentatiously unqualified   candidate in the   history of the American presidency. \u201d For good measure, it calls him \u201ca demagogue, a xenophobe, a sexist, a   and a liar. \u201d One day earlier, the Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter wrote, in his editor\u2019s letter for the November issue, \u201cThrough word or action, Trump has promoted gun violence, bigotry, ignorance, intolerance, lying, and just about everything else that can be wrong with society. \u201d That came after USA Today made the first presidential endorsement in its history  \u2014   or, more accurately, a \u201cdisendorsement,\u201d as it came out against Mr. Trump (\u201cunfit for the presidency\u201d) but not for Hillary Clinton or some other alternative. This is the time in the election cycle when media columnists write about whether endorsements have much to do with the outcome. The answer is usually, if not always, \u201cno. \u201d But the question takes on another dimension this year because of the sheer weight of the endorsements against Mr. Trump. They are overwhelmingly against him, and they just keep coming, in language that is notable for its blunt condemnation of the candidate and its \u201csave the Republic\u2019\u2019 tone. The endorsements are coming not only from the usual mainstream media suspects but also from newspapers that either never before supported a Democrat or had not in many decades  \u2014   The Dallas Morning News, The Arizona Republic, The Cincinnati Enquirer  \u2014   or had never endorsed any presidential candidate, like USA Today. The Wall Street Journal has not gone there, at least not yet, but a member of its   editorial board has: Dorothy Rabinowitz, who called Mr. Trump \u201cunfit. \u201d What\u2019s most striking is the collective sense of alarm they convey  \u2014   that Mr. Trump is a \u201cdangerous demagogue\u201d (USA Today) whose election would represent a \u201cclear and present danger\u201d (The Washington Post, The Cincinnati Enquirer) or, as The Atlantic editor Scott Stossel said in an interview Tuesday, \u201ca potential national emergency or threat to the Republic. \u201d That\u2019s the same base line the magazine used when it decided to break its founding vow to be \u201cthe organ of no party or clique\u201d and endorse Johnson in 1964 and, more dramatically, Lincoln in 1860. And yet, for all the   dismay in America\u2019s editorial boardrooms, a huge portion of the country just doesn\u2019t see it the same way at all. National polls aren\u2019t great for predicting the final outcome in the Electoral College. But they do capture the sense of the country. And right now The New York Times\u2019s polling average  \u2014   of various national surveys  \u2014   shows that 41 percent of the country would choose Mr. Trump over Mrs. Clinton if the election were held now. (With 45 percent, she still holds an edge.) The split between editorial opinion and a significant portion of voters, especially Republican voters, has been around for decades. But this campaign takes that schism to a whole new level  \u2014   not just because of the mix of publications weighing in against the Republican nominee but also because of the contrast between their apocalyptic view of a Trump presidency and his supporters\u2019 belief that he will indeed \u201cmake America great again. \u201d Then again, as the language of the editorial warnings hits   decibel levels, so does the language of the attacks against the mainstream media. Mr. Trump is stoking those attacks, depicting the media as among the \u201cspecial interests\u201d that have \u201crigged the system against everyday Americans,\u201d as he put it in New Hampshire last week. Which brings us to the question of how many minds it all changes.   Trump supporters will no doubt view the editorials as more evidence for Mr. Trump\u2019s case that the media fix is in. Mr. Trump recently said as much when he celebrated the loss of subscriptions the more surprising Clinton endorsements have caused in some cases, saying in a Twitter post: \u201cThe people are really smart in cancelling subscriptions to the Dallas  Arizona papers  now USA Today will lose readers! The people get it!\u201d (The Fox Business host Charles Gasparino provided one possible motive: \u201cA jealously rooted hate\u201d over his wealth, \u201chis beautiful wives\u201d and his television success.) A driving question is whether they factor into the mix with truly undecided voters. That is, and will remain, hard to determine. I did stumble upon some interesting data from Google, which can provide a sense of what people look for on its ubiquitous search engine. Searches for Mrs. Clinton spiked by nearly 50 percent in Dallas County after the Dallas Morning News recommendation in early September, though not as much as they did for the American swimmer Ryan Lochte  \u2014   after his legal trouble in Brazil  \u2014   or for the game between the Cowboys and the Giants. She trended in Cincinnati\u2019s Hamilton County after The Enquirer\u2019s endorsement, and in all of Arizona after The Republic\u2019s endorsement, though data from Hamilton County shows she was behind subjects like \u201cClown Sightings\u201d and \u201cNational Coffee Day\u201d on the list. Mr. Stossel of The Atlantic said he was aware of the divide in the country. \u201cPeople who support Trump have legitimate grievances and he is speaking to them in ways that clearly resonate,\u201d he said. (The editorial, whose language was shaped by the Atlantic correspondent Jeffrey Goldberg, addresses them by saying that Mr. Trump failed to present \u201crealistic policies to address\u201d their \u201clegitimate anxieties. \u201d) Mr. Stossel knows that the power of endorsements can be limited. But, he said, \u201cOne hopes that our endorsement, along with many of these others, will have an amplification effect that sort of ripples out. \u201d \u201cIf it affects only a few people at margins in a few key states,\u201d he said, \u201cthat may make a difference. \u201d \u201cGiven our previous endorsements, we\u2019re two for two,\u201d he noted. The streak will stand or fall Nov. 8.'"}, "time": 1742561912.0031588}
