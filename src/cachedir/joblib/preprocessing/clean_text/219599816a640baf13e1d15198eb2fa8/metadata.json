[This is the shocking admission of a paper published this week in Nature Geoscience. It\u2019s shocking because the paper\u2019s lead author is none other than Ben Santer  \u2014   one of the more vociferous and energetic alarmists exposed in the Climategate emails.  According to the paper\u2019s abstract: In the early   century,   tropospheric warming trends were generally smaller than trends estimated from a large   ensemble. And: We conclude that model overestimation of tropospheric warming in the early   century is partly due to systematic deficiencies in some of the   external forcings used in the model simulations. Translation: the   temperature increases were much smaller than our spiffy, expensive computer models predicted. Its significance did not pass unnoticed by this veteran climate scientist: Wow! \u201dmost early 21st century  \u2026    model tropospheric warming is substantially larger than observed\u201d https:  .     @RyanMaue,  \u2014   Roger A. Pielke Sr (@RogerAPielkeSr) June 19, 2017,  His surprise is understandable given that, previously, alarmist scientists like Ben Santer have gone to great lengths to deny the existence of a \u2018Pause\u2019 in global warming, to pour scorn on those who have argued otherwise and to insist that their computer models are fundamentally reliable. Indeed, only last week the Spectator published an article by one such Pause Denier  \u2014   a scientist from the University of East Anglia (ground zero of the Climategate scandal) fondly known as the University of Easy Access, named Phil Williamson. It is titled The Great Myth of the Global Warming Pause and it claims, somewhat imaginatively: The Paris agreement will be the future, whereas the     hiatus is already history. And let\u2019s not forget that in the dog days of the Obama administration, alarmist scientists were so desperate to pooh pooh the \u201cPause\u201d in the run up to the Paris climate talks that they concocted a junk science paper  \u2014   now the subject of a federal investigation  \u2014   which used dodgy data to try to airbrush the Pause out of history. Truly, as the Daily Caller notes, the alarmists\u2019   on this subject has of late been remarkable. Do they believe in the \u2018Pause\u2019 (or \u2018hiatus\u2019 as they sometimes term it) or don\u2019t they? Santer recently   a separate paper that purported to debunk statements EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt made that global warming had \u201cleveled off. \u201d But Santer\u2019s paper only evaluated a   and    portion of Pruitt\u2019s statement by removing the term \u201chiatus. \u201d Moreover, climate scientists mocked Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz for talking about the global warming \u201chiatus\u201d during a 2015 congressional hearing. Instead, activist scientists worked hard to airbrush the global warming slowdown from data records and advance media claim that it was a \u201cmyth. \u201d Santer and Carl Mears, who operate the Remote Sensing System satellite temperature dataset, authored a lengthy blog post in 2016 critical of Cruz\u2019s contention there was an   \u201chiatus\u201d in warming that climate models didn\u2019t predict. The fact that Ben Santer is involved in this embarrassing retraction  \u2014   his admission on the Pause is bad enough, but what the paper says about the unreliability of the computer models is breathtaking in its implications  \u2014   will be particularly piquant to those who remember his prominent role in the Climategate emails. Santer revealed himself to be one of the nastier and more aggressive members of Michael Mann\u2019s \u201cHockey\u201d team when he emailed one of his colleagues: Next time I see Pat Michaels at a scientific meeting, I\u2019ll be tempted to beat the crap out of him. Very tempted. (Climatologist Pat Michaels, now of the Cato Institute, incurred Santer\u2019s wrath by being one of the first climate scientists to pour cold water on Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming theory. In other words, Michaels made the disgusting,   error of using actual science and being right). But perhaps Santer\u2019s lowest point was the occasion where he effectively hijacked one of the early IPCC Assessment Reports and ramped up the scaremongering in a way that had rather more to do with political activism than it did to science. I describe it in my book Watermelons: Ben who? Well quite. Unless his name rings a bell as the guy from the Climategate emails who wanted to \u201cbeat the crap out of\u201d climate sceptic Pat Michaels, you almost certainly won\u2019t have heard of him. Yet in the   this climate modeling nonenity was somehow placed in the extraordinary position of being able to dictate world opinion on global warming at the stroke of a pen. He achieved this in his role as \u201clead author\u201d of Chapter 8 of the scientific working group report on the IPCC\u2019s Second Assessment Report (SAR). Nothing to write home about there, you might think, except that Santer was personally responsible for by far the most widely reported sentence in the entire report: the one from the Summary for Policy Makers (the only part of the IPCC\u2019s Assessment Report most people actually bother to read) claiming \u201cthe balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on global climate. \u201d But was this line actually true? Was this really a fair summary  \u2014   the kind of summary the IPCC purports rigorously and definitively to give of us  \u2014   of the general state of scientific understanding at that particular moment? Er, well not according to some of the scientists who\u2019d contributed to that chapter of the report, no. The original version of the chapter  \u2014   as agreed on and signed off by all 28 contributing authors  \u2014   expressed considerably more doubt about AGW than was indicated in Santer\u2019s summary. It included these passages: \u201cNone of the studies cited above has shown clear evidence that we can attribute the observed changes to the specific cause of increases in greenhouse gases. \u201d \u201cNo study to date has positively attributed all or part (of the climate change observed) to ( ) causes. \u201d \u201cAny claims of positive detection and attribution of significant climate change are likely to remain controversial until uncertainties in the total natural variability of the climate system are reduced. \u201d \u201cWhen will an anthropogenic climate be identified? It is not surprising that the best answer to the question is \u201cWe do not know. \u201d Strangely, none of these passages made it to the final draft. They were among 15 deleted after the event by Santer, who also inserted a phrase entirely of his own to the effect that \u201cthe body of statistical evidence\u201d now \u201cpoints to a discernible human influence on climate. \u201d In other words the chapter did not represent the \u201cconsensus\u201d position reached by 28 scientists. What it in fact represented was the scientifically unsupported opinion of one man, Benjamin D Santer. We climate rationalists do still get an awful lot of stick from the alarmists for our old fashioned belief that scientists should stick to the evidence and use actual data rather than plucking stuff from thin air based on their fanciful notions of what ought to be true or what might get them more  . How delightful it is to have it confirmed  \u2014   albeit in the arid language of a science paper  \u2014   that yet again are 100 percent correct.'"}, "time": 1742562596.8095136}
