And yes, it is filled with songs about romantic skepticism and ones about how the first steps you take after an old love breaks are tentative and fragile. And yes, it is a double album, the sort of gesture intended to connote seriousness of artistic and spiritual purpose, as well as suggesting that the font of feelings serving as inspiration is a roaring waterfall that cannot easily be contained. And yet it turns out that \u201cWings\u201d isn\u2019t so much about Ms. Lambert\u2019s relationship to Mr. Shelton as it is about hers to the Nashville mainstream, which she has shunned, coveted, flirted with and rejected at various points in the last decade. \u201cWings\u201d is her sixth album, and dating to before her 2005 debut, \u201cKerosene,\u201d she\u2019s been engaged in an elaborate dance with country music tradition and the current state of the genre. On the   competition \u201cNashville Star,\u201d she was a striver then, on her first two major label albums, she was a dissenter, upending norms with verve and backbone. In the years since, she\u2019s been, by turns, a traditionalist, a seemingly happy member of the Nashville establishment  \u2014   especially in the years she and Mr. Shelton were winning female and male vocalist of the year at the Country Music Association Awards  \u2014   and, at her most thrilling, a   boundary pusher being yanked (or, more accurately, yanking) in all sorts of wild directions. You could rarely accuse her of complacency, but maybe that\u2019s the most perverse strategy on this album, which no one would have blinked at if it were an earthquake, but which is perhaps more cunning as a tremor. For the most part, these songs  \u2014   vocals and all  \u2014   were recorded live to tape, leaving a texture of rustle and warm air. (There are overdubs and rerecorded vocals here, but they do not dominate.) Ms. Lambert wants to communicate that, through all of her personal struggles, she is working, right down to the flubbed then rerecorded intro to the crunchy, almost rowdy \u201cBad Boy,\u201d one of this album\u2019s better songs, written with the underheralded   Mando Saenz. This approach is clearest  \u2014   which is to say, the sound is the cloudiest  \u2014   on this double album\u2019s first, and better, half. \u201cThe Nerve\u201d is unhurried, verging on indifferent, a perhaps inadvertent nod to when country first went   in the 1990s. \u201cPushin\u2019 Time\u201d is strikingly intimate, as if recorded from the middle of the round. And \u201cHighway Vagabond\u201d is downright shaggy, even though its lyrics about hippie drifters are better suited to Jake Owen. Produced by Frank Liddell, Glenn Worf and Eric Masse, this \u201cWings\u201d is modestly scaled  \u2014   something Ms. Lambert never has been, and isn\u2019t always well suited to. Partly that\u2019s because her piercing voice breaks in just the right places when her mood grows downcast, and explodes into colorful curlicues when she\u2019s enthused, or peeved. That rarely happens here, though there is a vicious   \u201cTo Learn Her\u201d (written with Ashley Monroe and Waylon Payne) which singes with Gary   acid. And Ms. Lambert takes a quick, zany turn on the album\u2019s first half with the    songs \u201cWe Should Be Friends\u201d and \u201cPink Sunglasses,\u201d lightly comic feminism for the parts of the country where the local    is a Walmart: \u201cIf you\u2019re lookin\u2019 for love but willin\u2019 to   men and mamas and Miller   then, we should be friends. \u201d Mostly, though, fragility reigns. \u201cTin Man\u201d is a weepy warning: \u201cBetter thank your lucky   you ever felt one breakin\u2019 \u2019d never want a heart. \u201d And \u201c \u201d is a plea, to a new lover, or to a listener expecting fireworks and instead getting a small campfire: \u201cLike a caged bird barely set   me, I\u2019m finding my wings. \u201d When this album whispers, as it does on large swaths of the second half, it neuters Ms. Lambert\u2019s gifts. Even with a voice as signature as hers, there\u2019s little to elevate songs like \u201cGood Ol\u2019 Days\u201d or \u201cDear Old Sun. \u201d Most jarringly, this album doesn\u2019t serve as a retort to its surroundings, and retort is what Ms. Lambert does best, especially because, in her hands, it can take on myriad thrilling shapes. But doing so draws attention, and what\u2019s clear from this album is that Ms. Lambert is in retreat. Maybe the loudest person in the room could do with a little quiet.'"}, "time": 1742628472.1353993}
