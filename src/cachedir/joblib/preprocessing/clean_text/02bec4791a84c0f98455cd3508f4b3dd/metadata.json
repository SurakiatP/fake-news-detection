But that email says that it is the government of Saudi Arabia, and the government of Qatar that have been funding ISIS.\u201d \\nAs recounted by RT , Assange and Pilger, who sat down for their 25-minute interview at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London where the whistleblower has been a refugee since 2012, also talked about the conflict of interest between Clinton\u2019s official post, her husband\u2019s nonprofit, and the Middle East officials, whose stated desire to fight terrorism may not have been sincere. John Pilger: The Saudis, the Qataris, the Moroccans, the Bahrainis, particularly the first two, are giving all this money to the Clinton Foundation, while Hillary Clinton is secretary of state, and the State Department is approving massive arms sales, particularly Saudi Arabia. \\nJulian Assange: Under Hillary Clinton \u2013 and the Clinton emails reveal a significant discussion of it \u2013 the biggest-ever arms deal in the world was made with Saudi Arabia: more than $80 billion. During her tenure, the total arms exports from the US doubled in dollar value. \\nJP: Of course, the consequence of that is that this notorious jihadist group, called ISIL or ISIS, is created largely with money from people who are giving money to the Clinton Foundation? \\nJA: Yes. \\nThe conversation then turns to the imminent presidential election: Pilger questioned Assange over increasingly frequent accusations from the Clinton camp, and Western media, that WikiLeaks is looking to swing next week\u2019s US presidential election in favor of Donald Trump \u2013 perhaps at Russia\u2019s behest. \\nHowever, just as he did last week, Assange again dismissed the prospect of Trump, who is almost tied in the polls, winning as unlikely, and not necessarily due to his standing with the electorate. \\n\u201cMy analysis is that Trump would not be permitted to win. Why do I say that? Because he has had every establishment off his side. Trump does not have one establishment, maybe with the exception of the Evangelicals, if you can call them an establishment,\u201d said Assange. \u201cBanks, intelligence, arms companies, foreign money, etc. are all united behind Hillary Clinton. And the media as well. Media owners, and the journalists themselves.\u201d \\nHe is right, but the same was said about Brexit. \\nThis article originally appeared on ZeroHedge.
