(Disney Animation Studios and its corporate sibling, Pixar, now hold the top six spots on that Thanksgiving records list.) Costing at least $300 million to make and market worldwide, \u201cMoana\u201d took in an additional $16. 3 million in limited overseas release, including in China, where the response was muted. \u201cMoana,\u201d which navigated various controversies en route to theaters, including one over an   Halloween   and one over an oversize male character, is a   musical   Miranda, the virtuoso behind the Broadway smash \u201cHamilton,\u201d contributed to the score. After a fallow period in the 2000s, when Pixar reigned supreme, Disney Animation Studios has delivered one successful original film after another, including \u201cTangled,\u201d \u201cFrozen,\u201d \u201c  Ralph\u201d and, earlier this year, \u201cZootopia. \u201d Pixar, lately focused more intently on sequels, has recently had an uneven track record with originals, finding a blockbuster in \u201cInside Out\u201d but fizzling with \u201cThe Good Dinosaur. \u201d Among other new   offerings, Robert Zemeckis\u2019s period spy drama, \u201cAllied\u201d (Paramount) did the best, collecting about $18 million, according to comScore, which compiles box office data. Had the film not cost a hefty $85 million to make  \u2014   not including marketing expenses  \u2014   that sales total would have been fine. As it is, \u201cAllied,\u201d which drew soft reviews, will likely go down as another misfire for Mr. Zemeckis and Paramount. The studio is counting on foreign audiences to pick up the slack in partial overseas release, \u201cAllied,\u201d starring Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard, took in $9. 4 million. \u201cBad Santa 2\u201d (Broad Green) fared poorly. Costing an estimated $26 million to make, it sold about $9 million in tickets. The original \u201cBad Santa,\u201d now considered a crude comedy classic, arrived to $22 million in Thanksgiving ticket sales in 2003, after adjusting for inflation. Bombing outright was Warren Beatty\u2019s \u201cRules Don\u2019t Apply,\u201d a romantic comedic drama set in the late 1950s. Independently financed for $27 million and distributed by 20th Century Fox, \u201cRules Don\u2019t Apply\u201d collected a breathtakingly bad $2. 2 million for the   period. The movie likely suffered from mixed reviews, Mr. Beatty\u2019s   absence from movie screens and   marketing materials that failed to make the film seem relevant to contemporary  . Even so, it was a strong weekend over all for Hollywood, as a broad array of movies, including the   arrival of the Weinstein Company\u2019s \u201cLion,\u201d and sizzling holdovers, including \u201cFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,\u201d generated wide audience interest. For the year to date, total ticket sales in North America stand at $10. 1 billion, a 4. 5 percent increase from the same period a year ago.'"}, "time": 1742628302.4389362}
