Arnoldski -  \\n\\n\\nThis week, a very important delegation from Turkey visited Moscow. The group consists of members of the Turkish parliament and representatives of the ruling party, big business, and non-governmental organizations. At the head of the delegation is the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s cousin, Mehmet Mutlu, one of the most influential figures in modern Turkey. From the standpoint of diplomatic symbolism, the most important part of this trip is the delegation\u2019s visit to Crimea, which starts today, November 23rd. \\nWe\u2019ve seen Russian Crimea visited by many European politicians, including Italians from Matteo Salvini\u2019s Northern League, Frenchmen from Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Front and the Republican Party, deputies from the Alternative for Germany party, and many others. Conservative European politicians have no doubt: Crimea is part of Russia. This is a kind of consensus. In fact, in addition to right wing politicians, this position is shared by left politicians as well, such as the fearless Sahra Wagenknecht from Germany\u2019s Die Linke and Italian politicians from the Five Stars party.  \\nBut the high-ranking Turkish delegation\u2019s visit to Russia Crimea is already a completely new stage. Once again, we are dealing with a delegation involving Turkey\u2019s ruling party and the closest companion and relative of Erdogan. In essence, this is a decisive step towards Ankara\u2019s recognition of Crimea\u2019s reunification with Russia. It is telling that this is happening synchronously with Erdogan\u2019s statements that Turkey is suspending the process of integrating into Europe - where, by the way, no one is waiting for Turkey or will accept it - and Turkey\u2019s reorienting towards the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.  \\nErdogan is determined to change the country\u2019s Atlanticist course for a Eurasian one. Following the scare of the Gulenists\u2019 coup attempt, this determination has become even stronger. The American swamp stabbed Erdogan in the back. With the arrival of Trump, who is highly critical of Ankara, the situation has not defused. Therefore, Erdogan is clearly opting for rapprochement with us, and this is already irreversible. A symbol of this determination is the Turks\u2019 visit to Crimea. Russian Crimea.  \\nWe saw how the forces of the West who staged the coup d\u2019etat on the Maidan in 2014 and unleashed a bloody civil war in Ukraine tried to play the Crimean Tatar card in their favor. This provocative, extremist, nationalist, Wahhabist trend has come to be embodied in Mustafa Dzhemiliev. The objective of Kiev, and the West (or rather, the Western globalist swamp) standing behind it, was to mobilize Crimean Tatars against Russia. But Crimean Tatars themselves did not succumb to this provocation. In addition, Moscow almost immediately did what Kiev didn\u2019t do over 20 years: recognize the rights of Crimean Tatars. \\nThe majority of Crimean Tatars live in Turkey and are deeply and organically integrated into Turkish society. Therefore, even given Tatars\u2019 loyalty to Moscow after the reunification of Crimea with Russia, the Turkey factor remains extremely important. Even though Turkish President Erdogan has never spoken out against Russia\u2019s reunification with Crimea, he has never clarified his attitude towards Crimea or Crimean Tatars.  \\nAnd now, in front of our very eyes, is happening this visit, which is historic in every sense of the word. The aim of the visit is setting up active and intense social and commercial relations between the Turkish Republic and Russian Crimea. This says it all. It is obvious that Ankara decided on the composition of this delegation only after having well weighed all the consequences. The visit itself was made possible on the condition of agreeing on Crimea's status and the future of its official recognition.  \\nIt is telling that one of the leaders of the delegation, Hasan Cengiz, the head of an influential Turkish Eurasianist NGO, recently visited Damascus and held talks with Bashar al-Assad\u2019s entourage. These were the first talks since the beginning of the conflict between Syria and Turkey. The choice of the delegation\u2019s members was and is not accidental.  \\nTherefore, we can conclude that the process of Russian Crimea being recognized is gaining momentum in both the West and the East. Turkey is in the vanguard here.  \\n\\nThe Eurasian strategy removes almost all the contradictions that accumulated between neighboring countries in past periods. Turkey, like Russia, is undoubtedly a Eurasian country. And now this is becoming all the more obvious.  \\n\\n\\n     Follow us on Facebook!                                                   \\n                                                   \\n\\n       Follow us on Twitter! \\n                               \\n\\n             Donate! \\n\""}, "time": 1742628420.1175382}
