[During an interview on CNN\u2019s State of the Union, host Jake Tapper pointed out to Mayor DeBlasio that the City of New York refuses to cooperate with the federal government to deport illegal aliens who have been convicted of drunk driving and grand larceny. Tapper went on to ask why the city is so quick to shield such dangerous criminals from deportation.  Tapper also asked DeBlasio for a response to the recent order President Donald Trump signed stating that federal grant money will be stripped \u201cfrom the sanctuary states and cities that harbor illegal immigrants. \u201d DeBlasio decried the move and insisted he opposes \u201ctearing families apart\u201d over a \u201csmall offense\u201d such as drunk driving. DeBlasio claimed these \u201csmall\u201d crimes don\u2019t merit deportation, but for \u201cany serious and violent crime, we\u2019re going to work with\u201d the federal government. Still, DeBlasio claimed that drunk driving could easily be seen as a lesser offense. \u201cDrunk driving that does not lead to any other negative outcome, I could define as that,\u201d DeBlasio said before going on to say, \u201cSomeone commits a minor offense  \u2026     let\u2019s say someone went through a stop sign, they could be deported for that and their family could be torn apart and you could have children left behind where the breadwinner in the family is sent back to a home country, that is not good for anyone. \u201d Of course, if someone is picked up and scheduled for deportation after being detained during a traffic stop, it isn\u2019t the running of a stop sign that gets him deported it\u2019s being in the country illegally. Drunk driving is not generally seen as a \u201csmall offense. \u201d Nearly 10, 000 Americans are killed by drunk drivers every year, according to The Hill newspaper. Indeed, for years many activists have criticized what they feel are chronically lax drunk driving laws in many states in the U. S.
