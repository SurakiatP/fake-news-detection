He described the people planning this as \u201cbarbarians,\u201d and said, \u201cthis is not going to end well.\u201d He also issued this ominous warning, \u201cI have very serious doubts about the survival of our civilization under such people.\u201d Below is what the multi-billionaire had to say in this incredibly powerful interview. \\nThese People Are \u201cBarbarians\u201d Hugo Salinas Price: \u201cWith regards to the social question in the world, in 1929 a Spanish thinker by the name of Ortega y Gasset wrote a book that really shook up the world titled, \u2018The Revolt of the Masses.\u2019 He was talking about the appearance on the world stage of new individuals. \\nHe was writing about the growth of the population and the appearance of new individuals coming in to the mass of humanity. And these individuals evidently are (what he described as) \u2018barbarians.\u2019\u2026. \u201cThey came too suddenly to be educated, and for the knowledge of how to keep the Western way of life alive. These (barbarian) people have increased (in numbers), and now they have taken over power (in the world).\u201d \\nWe Are Now In The Hands Of These Barbarians So now we are in the hands of \u2018barbarians.\u2019 They have no idea of how our society came to be, and what is necessary to keep it going. They are fiddling with the controls: You might think of a monkey flying a 747 (airplane) \u2014 they don\u2019t have any idea what they are doing. And this is not going to end well with the barbarians at the controls\u2026 IMPORTANT: To find out which high-grade silver mining company billionaire Eric Sprott just purchased a nearly 20% stake in and learn why he believes this is one of the most exciting silver stories in the world \u2013 CLICK HERE OR BELOW: Sponsored \\nHugo Salinas Price continues: \u201c We don\u2019t have people who write books in power any more. I remember when a Prime Minister of England was a skilled musician and wrote books before he became Prime Minister. Where do we have such people in power today? We don\u2019t have scholars or people with a true background of education, history, economics and politics. \\n\u201cI Have Serious Doubts About The Survival Of Our Civilization\u201d They are all working on the spur of the moment. They are experimenting to see if this works and that works. And I have very serious doubts about the survival of our civilization under such people. I expect that a great crisis is coming. We are going to see a great separation and some people are just not going to make it, and the old truths are going to come back into fashion because of the need for survival.\u201d \\nHugo Salinas Price also added: \u201cI think we are going to see a series of bankruptcies. I think the (eventual) rise in interest rates is the fatal sign which is going to ignite a derivatives crisis. This is going to bring down the derivatives system (and the financial system). \\n\u201cIt\u2019s Not Going To Be A Very Pleasant World\u201d There are (over) one quadrillion dollars of derivatives and most of them are related to interest rates. The spiking of interest rates in the United States may set that off. What is going to happen in the world is eventually we are going to come to a moment where there is going to be massive bankruptcies around the globe. \\nWhat is going to be left after the dust settles is gold, and some people are going to have it and some people are not. Then the problem is going to be to hold on to what you\u2019ve got because it\u2019s not going to be a very pleasant world.\u201d \\n***KWN has now released the extraordinary audio interview with Egon von Greyerz, where he gives KWN listeners a look what is really happening behind the scenes globally and in the gold market, and you can listen to it by CLICKING HERE OR ON THE IMAGE BELOW. \\n***ALSO RELEASED: The Greatest Wealth Transfer In History Nears As \u2018Deep State\u2019 Now Pulling Out All The Stops CLICK HERE. \\n\u00a9 2015 by King World News\u00ae.
