Really, of course, he\u2019s being followed and watched, at street level and from a   surveillance hub on the other side of the ocean, where his erstwhile employers in the C. I. A. track him as if he were the quarry in a   game of Pok\u00e9mon Go. Like Jigglypuff or Snorlax, Bourne is a     throwback brought back into circulation because   \u2026    well, why not? It\u2019s summer. People need something to do, and at the moment, two hours of   paranoia might provide a soothing respite from the real thing. The good news and the bad news is that \u201cJason Bourne,\u201d directed by Paul Greengrass and starring Matt Damon as everyone\u2019s favorite amnesiac assassin, feels like old times. The band is back together for a reunion tour, and if some of the original members are missing, the new additions have learned the chords and are even permitted to try out a few fresh riffs. Almost a decade has passed since the last time Mr. Greengrass and Mr. Damon stepped out in this franchise together, and their return is both welcome and weary. In 2004, when Mr. Greengrass took over the series with \u201cThe Bourne Supremacy\u201d (Doug Liman had directed \u201cThe Bourne Identity\u201d two years before) his approach to action filmmaking felt distinctive and new. Now, his vigorous, rigorous style of shooting and editing  \u2014   maximum speed and maximum chaos rendered with elegant, sometimes breathtaking coherence  \u2014   has kind of an     vibe. The thrill isn\u2019t entirely gone. It\u2019s just a little more subdued. Mr. Damon, for his part, is as subdued as ever. Jason Bourne is a uniquely passive action hero, a man who runs on pure survival instinct as he tries to figure out who is after him and why. After so many years and so much running, his existential predicament has become a matter of routine. He knows that he knows some bad stuff  \u2014   and his pursuers know it, too  \u2014   but he\u2019s not entirely sure what he knows or how he knows it. For him, the resulting confusion is harrowing. For us, it\u2019s part of the fun, like the insidery frisson of hearing nuggets of spy jargon hissed by unsmiling people in dark suits. \u201cAlpha team, I need a sitrep, stat!\u201d The sitrep here is that Bourne, who has been pursuing his Plan B career as a   boxer in the wilds of Greece, is approached by his former colleague and fellow Company renegade, Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles). She has some information, harvested from a hacker camp in Iceland, concerning past Agency skulduggery involving Bourne\u2019s father (Gregg Henry, in flashbacks). Nicky and Jason rendezvous in Athens in the middle of a riot, and the   chase commences, with Robert Dewey, the director of the C. I. A. (Tommy Lee Jones) and Heather Lee (Alicia Vikander) one of his ambitious underlings, running the show amid the satellite feeds and data displays of suburban Virginia. Their main operational weapon on the ground overseas is a killer known only as the Asset (Vincent Cassel) who harbors a personal grudge against Bourne. This is perhaps the most striking feature of \u201cJason Bourne\u201d: Virtually all the major characters  \u2014   good, bad and    \u2014   work for the same organization, at least on a consulting basis. There are dark whispers about external threats, and invocations of the tension between security and privacy in the digital age, but geopolitics and technology are scaffolding for what is essentially a movie about human resources challenges in a large bureaucracy. This chapter in the series, coming after the emergence of WikiLeaks and the growth of social media, takes passing note of contemporary realities. Edward J. Snowden\u2019s name is dropped a few times, and there is a subplot about a young tech mogul named Aaron Kalloor (Riz Ahmed) who is trying to extricate his company from Dewey\u2019s pocket. Terrorism and surveillance are treated both as facts of life and as vaporous abstractions. When Dewey talks about protecting the homeland, or Kalloor speaks of the importance of protecting consumer data, the words carry no real conviction, on the part of either the characters or the filmmakers. There is also a rote quality to much of the action, an absence of passion, if not of skill. I suspect that some youngsters out there will complain that \u201cJason Bourne\u201d is tedious and irrelevant. Without disputing the substance of that judgment, I can\u2019t help taking it personally. The tedium, I would argue, is not incidental but essential, because this is not really a spy thriller or even a   and    action movie, but rather a somber meditation on the crisis of the   professional in the throes of middle age. I\u2019m not casting shade on Mr. Damon, who at 45 looks terrific, with the complete opposite of a dad bod and a residual Will Hunting twinkle in his eye. But reflect for a moment on the character he plays, who must do his own   on the fly and under duress. Jason, for all his prodigious talent and carefully honed technique, finds himself permanently stalled on the career ladder, unable either to advance or to quit. To make matters worse, he is caught in a generational pincers grip, squeezed on one side by a   and sentimental   boss (Mr. Jones) and on the other by a   millennial rising quickly through the ranks (Ms. Vikander). Poor Bourne is burdened with inconvenient historical knowledge even as he must fight a perpetual battle against his own obsolescence. So I have to say I\u2019m rooting for the guy. I doubt he\u2019ll ever truly figure out who he is. But at least he can keep moving until his 401( k) is fully vested, and he can finally get around to writing that novel. \u201cJason Bourne\u201d is rated   (Parents strongly cautioned). A modest body count by the standards of the genre. Running time: 2 hours 3 minutes.'"}, "time": 1742564153.6500955}
