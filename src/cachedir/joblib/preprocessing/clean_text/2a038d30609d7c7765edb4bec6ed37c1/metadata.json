Sheriff Peyton Grinnell as he deadpanned: \u201cWe are coming for you. Run. \u201d Perhaps it was the muted background music: an eerie melody that wouldn\u2019t have been out of place in a Batman movie. In the end, what could have been an unremarkable public service announcement about opioid abuse in Lake County spread widely on the internet, garnering about a million views on the Facebook page of the sheriff\u2019s office, where it was first posted Friday. It sparked concerns about police militarization and drew more than a few comparisons to Islamic State recruitment videos. But many residents of Lake County seemed to respond positively, thanking the sheriff for drawing attention to a deadly scourge that has altered communities beyond recognition. In the   clip, Sheriff Grinnell, who was elected in November, stood at a podium flanked by four deputies wearing black face coverings. The sheriff addressed his Lake County constituents, saying he was aware of the \u201cserious issue\u201d of heroin abuse in the area. He encouraged people to call the office with tips. He added: \u201cTo the dealers that are pushing this poison, I have a message for you. \u201d And the camera began to zoom in. The sheriff warned drug dealers that the police were waiting for some arrest warrants to be finalized. \u201cEnjoy trying to sleep tonight, wondering if tonight\u2019s the night our SWAT team blows your front door off the hinges,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are coming for you. If our agents can show the nexus between you, the pusher of poison, and the person that overdoses and dies, we will charge you with murder. We are coming for you. Run. \u201d At the end of the video, Sheriff Grinnell and the four others walked offscreen in a silent, single file. \u201cIt makes the Lake County Sheriff\u2019s Department look like they\u2019re about to go to battle in Falluja,\u201d said Ezekiel Edwards, director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Criminal Law Reform Project. SWAT teams, he added, should be used only when there is an imminent threat to human life. \u201cThat video suggested that they are using SWAT inappropriately, and in a way that is going to escalate violence and danger to all involved. \u201d But Lt. John Herrell, a spokesman for the sheriff\u2019s office, said responses from residents had been positive. \u201cI would say that the critics are off the mark and have missed the whole point of the message,\u201d he said. \u201cThe sheriff wanted to let the community know that he\u2019s aware of this problem. \u201d Lt. Herrell added that the video\u2019s tough tone was aimed at dealers, not addicts. And as for the men in black masks, he explained: \u201cThey are undercover deputies, and state statutes require that their identities be protected. \u201d Kim Mousette, 52, said it was time for the police to take a tougher approach to heroin abuse in the county. She said her neighborhood in Pine Lakes, once a quiet refuge, had lately become a haven for drug users where people no longer felt safe leaving their doors unlocked. \u201cWe were in one of the most pristine, protected areas of Florida, and now this is going on,\u201d she said in a phone interview. \u201cYou could be walking along and have a syringe go through your foot. \u201d Ms. Mousette, who said the police had largely been unresponsive to complaints, voted for Sheriff Grinnell last year. Now, she feels she made the right choice. \u201cI was very happy to see that video,\u201d she said. Heroin abuse surged in Lake County after Florida\u2019s state legislature cracked down on loosely regulated pain clinics  \u2014   known as \u201cpill mills\u201d  \u2014   in 2011, said Lt. Herrell. As a result, people lost easy access to prescription drugs like OxyContin and turned to heroin. The opioid scourge is national in scope the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that nearly 13, 000 people died of heroin overdoses across the country in 2015, up 20. 6 percent from 2014. Audrianna Nicole Boone, 27, watched family members suffer from addiction in her hometown, Lady Lake. She moved to North Carolina in 2012, and has long felt that the Lake County police never did enough to fight opioid abuse. \u201cWhen I see this video, it\u2019s kind of like the sheriff\u2019s office declaring war on the drug addiction and the criminals,\u201d she said. \u201cI love it, and I hope it continues to go viral. \u201d Still, she added, the video was only a starting point. \u201cInstead of arresting these people for the drug use, how about enacting some type of system that helps these people get clean and reintroduces these people to society?\u201d she said. As the clip began to find audiences across the country, it encountered sharper criticism. Some compared it to Islamic State recruitment videos, which often feature militants wearing black ski masks. Others poked fun at the melodramatic production. Still others said it was a clear case of an   of police forces across the United States. Mr. Edwards of the A. C. L. U. acknowledged that opioid addiction was a serious issue in need of redress  \u2014   but not like this. \u201cEven though it\u2019s just one local video, it does, in a very short amount of time, encapsulate much of what is wrong with policing today: militarization, using force inappropriately, and continuing to fight a drug war that has proved to be a failure,\u201d he said. Some in Lake County agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s a good example of how overly militarized police in the U. S. are,\u201d said Robert Vibert, 35, who lives in the town of Tavares, where the county sheriff\u2019s office is. He said he found the video overly dramatic, as if Sheriff Grinnell were trying to make a name for himself. \u201cI\u2019m sure he means well, but his approach is lackluster and a waste if he doesn\u2019t tackle the totality of the problem,\u201d Mr. Vibert said. \u201cWithout attacking supply lines, and helping addicts and users get clean, it won\u2019t ever really solve the problem. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562268.1157696}
