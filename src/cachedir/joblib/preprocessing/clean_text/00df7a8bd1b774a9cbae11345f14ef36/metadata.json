At a meeting in New York to give momentum to the idea, the group cited the report of a bipartisan Congressional commission in November that urged construction of the museum. \u201cIt\u2019s tremendously important,\u201d said Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York, who first proposed the project in the late 1990s. \u201cHow can you empower women if they are not even recognized?\u201d The commission recommended \u201ca national museum dedicated to showcasing the historical experiences and impact of women in this country. \u201d The commission did not specify a site but said its preference was for the museum, to be called the American Museum of Women\u2019s History, to be located prominently in the capital, on or close to the National Mall. The museum will require legislation to become a reality. Emily K. Rafferty, former president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and one of the commissioners who produced the congressional report, said, \u201cThe women\u2019s tale has not been revealed, has not been properly identified or properly articulated. \u201d The commission proposed that the government provide the land or an existing building for the museum. Private   of about $150 million to $180 million would pay for construction costs, it said. A spokeswoman for the Smithsonian, Linda St. Thomas, said its secretary does not believe the institution is in a position to establish a new museum at this time, but was committed to representing the contributions of women in all the Smithsonian\u2019s museums. Last year on the Mall, the Smithsonian opened the National Museum of African American History and Culture, the 19th museum or gallery in the Smithsonian portfolio.'"}, "time": 1742563480.1438165}
