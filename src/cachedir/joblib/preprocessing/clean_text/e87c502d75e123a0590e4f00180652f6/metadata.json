Kiki, with the faded glamour of Norma Desmond, sings deranged takes on Top 40 hits and slurs through tactless banter about current events. Herb, with   gray hair and a kitschy suit, hammers a keyboard and sips Canadian Club. A medley might start with \u201cFrosty the Snowman\u201d and end with Patti Smith. From 1993 until 2008, Kiki and Herb, known offstage as Justin Vivian Bond and Kenny Mellman, performed under the guise of failed, septuagenarian lounge singers, earning a devoted audience that included luminaries from the pop, film and fashion worlds. What started small in San Francisco evolved into a Broadway show and ended with a   farewell at Carnegie Hall. And now, after eight years, Kiki and Herb are reuniting for a monthlong engagement beginning Thursday, April 21, at Joe\u2019s Pub, as part of the commissioning program New York Voices. The show, \u201cSeeking Asylum! ,\u201d sold out within minutes. \u201cI guess this is how \u2018Star Wars\u2019 fans must feel when a new movie comes out,\u201d said Kathleen Hanna, a feminist punk musician and a longtime fan. Ms. Hanna first came across Kiki and Herb in the late 1990s when visiting her boyfriend, Adam Horovitz of the Beastie Boys, in New York. She was living in North Carolina then and considering a move to either New York or Chicago. She thought the cabaret act was weird, brilliant, even devastating. \u201cThis is the New York of my fantasies,\u201d she remembered thinking. Forget Chicago, Ms. Hanna told her boyfriend, \u201cI want to be where Kiki and Herb are. \u201d Now, she plays with Mr. Mellman in her band the Julie Ruin, and Mr. Horovitz, now her husband, accompanies another downtown cabaret fixture, Bridget Everett. Kiki and Herb fans often have stories like this, in which they stumble on a new cabaret act and end up obsessed. Doug Wright, the Pulitzer   playwright and an occasional director of Kiki and Herb shows, called them \u201cGreek tragedians in tacky lapels and stiletto heels\u201d who turn familiar songs into \u201c  lamentation. \u201d After seeing their act for the first time, he said, \u201cIn some dark little corner of my heart, I wanted them to adopt me. \u201d But when the act started in San Francisco, Mr. Mellman and Bond, who uses the   honorific Mx. counted only a small number of regulars in the audience (a \u201cboutique audience,\u201d Mx. Bond called them). They first performed together in 1989, in Mx. Bond\u2019s cabaret show \u201cDixie McCall\u2019s Patterns for Living. \u201d At the time, Mx. Bond was 26 and considering a career as a professor of art history. Mr. Mellman was 21, in college and writing poetry while living on Market Street. One night, during a later engagement at Cafe du Nord, Mx. Bond was sick and told Mr. Mellman: \u201cI\u2019m not going to be able to sing. So I\u2019m going to be Kiki, and you\u2019re going to be Herb, and we\u2019re going to do this material in the style of old vaudeville people. \u201d Herb drank Scotch, they decided, and Kiki drank Canadian Club and ginger ale. (Later, Herb took up Canadian Club because they couldn\u2019t afford two bottles of liquor.) The act was improvised but well received. \u201cFrom the moment this coalesced, I felt it was artistically right,\u201d Mr. Mellman said. They found inspiration in real people. Herb, for example, was a lot like Eddie, who played piano at Athens by Night, the tiny Greek restaurant that first hosted \u201cDixie McCall\u2019s. \u201d \u201cEddie would get drunk and talk about his cat,\u201d Mr. Mellman said. \u201cAnd he\u2019d weep on his piano keys. I was like, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s what happens to an old piano player. \u2019\u201d Kiki was based on the mother of Mx. Bond\u2019s childhood friend Nancy. The woman had been a showgirl in Baltimore in the 1950s, but gave up performance for parenthood and later had terminal cancer. Mx. Bond remembers radiation pencil marks on her neck, but also   fingernails and a turban on her head. \u201cWhen I first met her, she started doing a   in my friend\u2019s bedroom, and she said, \u2018I started out as a dancer in the 50s, and I still got it,\u2019\u201d Mx. Bond said. \u201cAnd that became one of Kiki\u2019s signature lines. \u201d The woman, like Kiki, was also very opinionated about politics. One day, she was sick and lying in bed, Mx. Bond said, and watching President Reagan on TV. \u201cShe looked at me and said, \u2018You know, the saddest day of my life was the day John Hinckley missed. \u2019\u201d When Kiki and Herb first began performing regularly, Mr. Mellman said, \u201cSan Francisco was one big protest. \u201d People were angry about AIDS and fighting for gay rights, and Kiki\u2019s banter catered to them. When the act moved to New York in the late 90s, Mx. Bond wove humor with empowering political statements and frank talk about race and other issues. In a video from 1999 at Flamingo East in Manhattan, Kiki tells the story of her fictional son, Bradford. It begins with a joke: \u201cHe would say we\u2019re estranged, perhaps. \u201d Then Kiki says that Bradford called to say he has AIDS. \u201cI said, \u2018You\u2019re calling me on Mother\u2019s Day to say you\u2019re dying of AIDS,\u2019\u201d Kiki slurs, \u201cand he says, \u2018No, Mother, I\u2019m living with AIDS. \u2019\u201d The audience whistles and cheers, but Kiki doesn\u2019t let the political message linger. She ends with another joke: \u201cI sent him a card and wrote, \u2018I hope you\u2019re feeling chipper, get well soon.\u2019 He could have picked a better day. \u201d The act works only because of Mx. Bond and Mr. Mellman\u2019s \u201c100 percent commitment\u201d to the characters, said the fashion designer Isaac Mizrahi, a friend and occasional collaborator. The actress Molly Ringwald, another friend, recalled, \u201cThe transformation to Kiki was so complete that it felt like she existed somewhere in the ether, and Justin was simply channeling her. \u201d This method acting extends to their seemingly misguided musicianship. Both Mx. Bond and Mr. Mellman are classically trained, and \u201cthe way I sing as Kiki is very difficult,\u201d Mx. Bond said. \u201cDolly Parton said, \u2018It takes a lot of money to look this cheap.\u2019 Well, it takes a lot of work to look this haphazard. \u201d The actress Tilda Swinton referred to their performance as a \u201ctruly beautiful\u201d partnership. \u201cIt\u2019s a love story,\u201d she said, \u201cif one played out through the tantalizing veils of mutual frustration and   screaming. \u201d Over the years, Kiki and Herb moved from downtown basements to the mainstream, even Off Broadway at the Cherry Lane Theater. In 2004, they gave a   farewell performance at Carnegie Hall, with guests like Mr. Mizrahi and Jake Shears of the Scissor Sisters. But they were back onstage the next year, touring and eventually arriving on Broadway. The show was nominated for a Tony Award but lost to the ventriloquism act \u201cJay Johnson: The Two and Only!\u201d  \u2014   or, as Mx. Bond and Mr. Mellman said, \u201cWe lost to a puppet. \u201d Then, in 2008, they gave another performance at Carnegie Hall that would turn out to be their last in New York. \u201cWe reached a crossroads,\u201d Mx. Bond said. \u201cTo make a commitment to those characters would have been a career choice. Joan Rivers could never not be Joan Rivers. Robin Williams was very popular as Mork. And he could have been that character for his entire life, but he wanted to do other things. \u201d Mx. Bond wanted to be more like Mr. Williams Mr. Mellman was fine as Rivers. So Kiki and Herb ended suddenly, and not amicably. They didn\u2019t speak for five years. In their time apart, they thrived individually, pursuing projects that for years had taken a back seat to Kiki and Herb. Mx. Bond wrote a memoir, has had three solo   shows and is behind a fragrance, \u201cAfternoon of a Faun\u201d (named after the 1912 Nijinsky ballet, which Mx. Bond called \u201cthe first queer performance\u201d). Mr. Mellman contributed to other cabaret acts, like Ms. Everett\u2019s, and with Ms. Hanna founded the Julie Ruin, which has a new album scheduled for release on July 8. In 2013, Mx. Bond had a 50th birthday party at Le Poisson Rouge and wanted to invite Mr. Mellman, but didn\u2019t. After a bittersweet email exchange, Mx. Bond said, \u201cWe acknowledged to each other that we missed being together, and that we meant a lot to each other. \u201d Their renewed friendship, combined with Mx. Bond\u2019s   retrospective underway at Joe\u2019s Pub, made for a natural opportunity to reunite as Kiki and Herb. And not a moment too soon for some fans, like Ms. Swinton, who said, \u201cI\u2019m longing for the sight and rhythm of Kiki\u2019s   embonpoint and the deathless glamour of her style, updates on Herb\u2019s mental health and her   analysis of the world of political cut and thrust. \u201d For their reunion, Mx. Bond and Mr. Mellman have also brought on board their longtime costume designer, Marc Happel, the director of costumes at New York City Ballet. He has been working on Kiki and Herb\u2019s outfits in his off hours because, he said, \u201cHow often do you get to dress a failed, drunk cabaret singer?\u201d \u201cSeeking Asylum!\u201d will address where Kiki and Herb have been since Carnegie Hall. Without giving too much away, Mx. Bond said, \u201cHerb had a scenario that got complicated when he was visiting Southeast Asia as a sexual tourist. \u201d Kiki has been in   Syria, where \u201cshe has a long history with the Assad family,\u201d Mx. Bond said. \u201cBut you don\u2019t know what people are like. \u201d With a signature coy smirk, Mx. Bond added, \u201cSome of the most evil people in the world are charming. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628460.8027322}
