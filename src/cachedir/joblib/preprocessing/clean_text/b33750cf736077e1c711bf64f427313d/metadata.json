Gorsuch in a move that will most likely reshape both the Senate and the court. After Democrats held together Thursday morning and filibustered President Trump\u2019s nominee, Republicans voted to lower the threshold for advancing Supreme Court nominations from 60 votes to a simple majority. In deploying this   nuclear option, lawmakers are fundamentally altering the way the Senate handles one of its most significant duties, further limiting the minority\u2019s power in a chamber that was designed to be a slower and more deliberative body than the House. The move, once unthinkable among senators, is a testament to the creeping partisan rancor in recent years, after decades of at least relative bipartisanship on Supreme Court matters. Both parties have warned of sweeping effects on the court itself, predicting the elevation of more ideologically extreme judges now that only a majority is required for confirmation. Senate Democrats in 2013 first changed the rules of the Senate to block Republican filibusters of presidential nominees to lower courts and to government positions. But they left the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees untouched, an acknowledgment of the court\u2019s exalted status. On Thursday, that last pillar was swept away on a   vote, with all 52 Republicans choosing to overrule Senate precedent and all 48 Democrats and   independents pushing to keep it. For weeks, the demise of the Supreme Court filibuster had seemed preordained  \u2014   like a moldering stadium with a demolition date  \u2014   even as members lamented the inevitability as a low moment for the Senate. In recent days, faint rumblings of a deal to avert the clash had faded almost entirely. Democrats placed the blame squarely on Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and his Republican colleagues, who last year refused to even consider Judge Merrick B. Garland, President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee for the seat of Justice Antonin Scalia, who died nearly 14 months ago. \u201cWhen history weighs what happened, the responsibility for changing the rules will fall on the Republicans\u2019 and Leader McConnell\u2019s shoulders,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, who had called for the withdrawal of the nomination if Judge Gorsuch could not earn 60 votes. \u201cThey have had other choices,\u201d he added. \u201cThey have chosen this one. \u201d Lawmakers first convened late Thursday morning to decide whether to advance the nomination. Republicans needed 60 votes  \u2014   at least eight Democrats and independents joining the   majority  \u2014   to end debate on the nomination and proceed to a final vote. Only a handful of Democrats defected, leaving Republicans to choose between allowing the president\u2019s nominee to fail or bulldozing   Senate practice. The final confirmation vote is set for Friday. Republicans argued that changing the rules to push through the nomination was their only option, accusing Democrats of razing Senate norms with the   successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee. Allowing this obstruction to stand, Republicans said, would have caused more damage than overriding Senate precedent to turn back the filibuster. \u201cThis is the latest escalation in the left\u2019s   judicial war, the most audacious yet,\u201d Mr. McConnell said, after describing Democratic opposition in the past to Judge Robert H. Bork and Justice Clarence Thomas. \u201cAnd it cannot and it will not stand. There cannot be two sets of standards: one for the nominees of the Democratic president and another for the nominees of Republican presidents. \u201d But Democrats had shown no signs of forsaking their filibuster plans all week. Their stance has pleased their most progressive voters, who have preached resistance to Mr. Trump at every opportunity. Critics of Judge Gorsuch said they had identified ample reasons to oppose him, chafing at the suggestion that Democrats are merely seeking payback for Judge Garland. They cited concerns over Judge Gorsuch\u2019s record on workers\u2019 rights and wondered whether he could be reliably independent from Mr. Trump and conservative groups like the Federalist Society, which pushed his nomination. But at times on Thursday, it was difficult to escape the conclusion that Judge Garland loomed largest in the minds of Democrats. After Mr. McConnell suggested from the Senate floor that Republicans had given due deference in the past to Supreme Court nominees under Democratic presidents, Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, could not suppress a rebuttal. \u201cThere must have been a hacking into his computer,\u201d he said of Mr. McConnell, \u201cbecause he can\u2019t print the name Merrick Garland to include in the speech. \u201d Mr. Durbin later said that both Mr. McConnell and Judge Gorsuch would \u201center the history books with asterisks by their names. \u201d And in a performative flourish of parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Schumer seized the floor to ask if any rules or precedents prohibited the Senate from \u201cconsidering and voting on a nominee to the Supreme Court in the fourth year of the president\u2019s term\u201d  \u2014   the   justification for denying Judge Garland even a hearing. \u201cThe chair is not aware of any such prohibition in its rules or precedents,\u201d replied Senator Deb Fischer, Republican of Nebraska, who was presiding in the chamber at the time. For Mr. McConnell, who could be seen doling out   among lawmakers and aides after the votes, Thursday\u2019s proceedings amounted to a gamble rewarded. Last year, Democrats had hoped to make Republicans pay at the ballot box for their treatment of Judge Garland. Instead, they will watch on Friday as a conservative jurist is confirmed for a lifetime appointment, with no power to filibuster nominees for future vacancies. Judge Gorsuch will be taking the seat of one of the court\u2019s most reliably conservative justices. A   replacement for Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 84, Anthony M. Kennedy, 80, or Stephen Breyer, 78, would herald a significant ideological shift for the high court. \u201cThey had a right to do what they did,\u201d Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the body\u2019s   Republican, said of the Democrats\u2019 filibuster. \u201cI just thought it was stupid. \u201d Other lawmakers sounded graver notes on Thursday, even as members of both parties dismissed any suggestion that a majority party might one day pursue more drastic remedies, like removing the filibuster on legislation. Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, said he was now serving an institution in \u201csuffering,\u201d with no clear direction as the parties lurched toward a deeper mutual resentment. \u201cWhere we go from here, it\u2019s hard to tell,\u201d he said. \u201cWill there be further erosions or not?\u201d He was asked if this might prove a turning point, a moment for doubling back. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty early in this Congress,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there\u2019s plenty more time for more harm to be done. \u201d Despair was bipartisan. Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said she had strained over the last several days to broker an agreement to head off the filibuster and nuclear option. By all accounts, the senators hoping for such a compromise did not come particularly close. \u201cThere is such a profound lack of trust between the two parties,\u201d said Ms. Collins, the rare Republican last year who supported holding a hearing and a vote on Judge Garland. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know whether the polarization in the Senate reflects the country or whether the polarization and divisiveness in the Senate affects the country. \u201d She paused for a beat, a few feet from Mr. McConnell\u2019s office. \u201cWell, it clearly affects the country,\u201d she said. \u201cBut which causes the other is at times hard to discern. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628539.183732}
