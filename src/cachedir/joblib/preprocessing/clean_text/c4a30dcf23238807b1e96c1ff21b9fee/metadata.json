And if there's anything top FBI officials now, it's crime families. Certainly this is probably the first serious level of experience that Hillary can claim in any field. \\n\u201cThe Clintons, that\u2019s a crime family, basically,\u201d former assistant FBI director James Kallstrom said. \u201cIt\u2019s like organized crime. I mean the Clinton Foundation is a cesspool.\u201d \\n\u201cKallstrom, best known for leading the investigation into the explosion of TWA flight 800 in the late '90s, said that Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, was a \u201cpathological liar.\u201d \\nHe also blasted Attorney General Loretta Lynch, claiming that she impeded the investigation into Clinton\u2019s private server. \\n\u201cThe problem here is this investigation was never a real investigation,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem. They never had a grand jury empanelled, and the reason they never had a grand jury empanelled, I\u2019m sure, is Loretta Lynch would not go along with that.\u201d \\nKallstrom also said that FBI Director James Comey and the rest of the FBI\u2019s leadership were responsible for holding back the investigation, not the rest of the bureau. \\n\u201cThe agents are furious with what\u2019s going on, I know that for a fact,\u201d he said. \\nBut according to the media, the FBI investigating Hillary is the real crime.\""}, "time": 1742628592.962402}
