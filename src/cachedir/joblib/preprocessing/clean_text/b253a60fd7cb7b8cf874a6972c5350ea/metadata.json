Gowan, an unassuming Republican legislator whom colleagues on both sides of the aisle saw as someone they could work with. But Mr. Gowan has proved to be anything but. He has angered lawmakers from the right and left since assuming the post in January 2015, putting his own stamp on a legislative body that has garnered its share of attention for its   leanings on issues like immigration and abortion. Right after approving a budget last year that forced state agencies to make another round of cuts, Mr. Gowan, a conservative who makes his home in a rural border county in southeastern Arizona, embarked on a redecorating spree. The House floor got an elegant carpet. Lawmakers got reupholstered chairs. His leadership team got cherry wood office furniture. He also planned for showers and a multiuse room in the basement, but shelved the project after half of his Republican caucus chided his \u201cexcessive spending\u201d in a letter. In January, Mr. Gowan repaid the state for travel reimbursements and daily allowances he had improperly claimed, a matter that remains under investigation by the state\u2019s attorney general. He began this month by abruptly revoking reporters\u2019 access to the House floor unless they agreed to an extensive background check. None of them did. Fourteen journalists regularly assigned to cover the Capitol retreated to the   gallery that morning, taking pictures and writing stories as a group of visiting elementary school students giggled and gawked. State Representative Ken Clark, a Democrat from Phoenix, warned, \u201cThis is a slippery slope. \u201d In an   column, Amanda Ventura, the president of the local chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists, wrote, \u201cReporters pose no security threat  \u2014   unless truth hurts. \u201d From the floor, Mr. Gowan told his colleagues, by way of explanation, \u201cI want to make sure you\u2019re protected. \u201d But the ensuing debate promptly stirred another controversy, about guns in the chamber. Mr. Gowan had authorized the removal of a sign that banned firearms from the staff entrance to the House building, effectively allowing lawmakers to enter armed. Mr. Gowan, 46, who was first elected as a state representative in 2008, is leaving the House at the end of the year because of term limits. He is now aiming his sights at Washington, running to represent one of the largest congressional districts in the country. In a crowded field of Republican contenders, he is considered an underdog, though he does not seem deterred. \u201cDavid Gowan has always been underestimated, always traveled under the radar,\u201d Frank Antenori, a former Republican state senator who is a close friend of Mr. Gowan\u2019s, said in an interview. \u201cHe\u2019s got a real folksy personality, people just don\u2019t see him as being as aggressive. That\u2019s a big mistake. \u201d Mr. Gowan hails from conservative Cochise County, a land of cattle ranchers that takes in Fort Huachuca  \u2014   once home to the storied Buffalo Soldiers, these days a sprawling base that is host to the armed forces\u2019 intelligence training program. He earned a living as a magazine distributor  \u2014   stacking periodicals and paperback novels on the shelves of supermarkets and drugstores  \u2014   and teaching martial arts on the side he is a black belt in karate. Mr. Gowan turned his political ambitions into action methodically and patiently. He ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination to the Arizona House twice, in 2004 and 2006, focusing his campaign on a single issue: illegal immigration, a major point of contention in the border district he wanted to represent.  An editorial in The Tucson Citizen, a newspaper that has since ceased publication, called his command of other topics \u201cfuzzy at best. \u201d Jonathan Paton, who defeated him twice in primaries, said determination is what got Mr. Gowan where he is. \u201cHe does not quit,\u201d said Mr. Paton, a Republican who served in both the Arizona House and Senate. \u201cHe does not accept that he shouldn\u2019t be in office, that he shouldn\u2019t be speaker of the House, that he shouldn\u2019t be in Congress. \u201d Mr. Gowan is one of seven Republicans running for Arizona\u2019s First Congressional District, whose jagged borders encompass nine counties in full or in part in eastern, northern and central Arizona. The area has traditionally leaned Republican, but the district itself has been competitive since it was realigned in 2010. In 2014, Ann Kirkpatrick, a Democrat, narrowly defeated her Republican opponent, Andy Tobin, a former Arizona House speaker. She is leaving her congressional seat to run against John McCain, the   Republican senator and former presidential candidate. One of Mr. Gowan\u2019s rivals for the Republican nomination is Sheriff Paul Babeu of Pinal County, one of the most vociferous proponents of more border security. His county, an expanse of desert and rugged mountains near the   border, is a major route for drug cartels bringing contraband to Phoenix and Tucson. \u201cIn a crowded Republican field like this, each of the candidates is trying to move to the right of the other,\u201d said Matthew Benson, a political consultant and senior aide to former Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican. \u201cNobody is running as a moderate. \u201d \u201cThey\u2019re all trying to prove they\u2019re the most conservative and go to Washington to shake things up,\u201d he added. Mr. Antenori said Mr. Gowan got into politics \u201cto make sure that our basic liberties were protected,\u201d in particular \u201cour religious freedoms, the Second Amendment, our property rights. \u201d At the Capitol, Mr. Gowan is reserved, a man who has a tendency to mumble his words. While his predecessor, Mr. Tobin, was known for his \u201cbackslapping, more public, more accessible\u201d ways, Mr. Gowan has \u201ca quiet, more   style, but he has been just as effective,\u201d said Glenn Hamer, the president of the Arizona Chamber of Commerce, an influential   group. Mr. Gowan rarely gives interviews and declined to comment for this article. Lobbyists often meet with him over lunch. In 2013, Mr. Gowan ranked No. 3 on a list of    expenditures reported by lobbyists, according to an analysis of such records by The Arizona Capitol Times. (\u201cI\u2019m looking for free food,\u201d he told the newspaper.) For his part, Representative Bruce Wheeler, a leader of the Democratic minority, was unreservedly blunt in his criticism: \u201cThe leadership under Gowan has been disastrous,\u201d he said. But to Republicans and Democrats alike, the storm over the banning of reporters from the House floor became a source of embarrassment. Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, told reporters he felt \u201cpretty safe around you. \u201d On April 8, the day Mr. Gowan issued his ban, The Capitol Times suggested in an online article that the move may have been motivated by the fact that one of its reporters, Hank Stephenson, has written about the improper reimbursements and the lobbyists\u2019 expenses. Mr. Gowan rescinded his ban on Tuesday, maintaining nonetheless that his motivation had been to protect the chamber.'"}, "time": 1742564503.628776}
