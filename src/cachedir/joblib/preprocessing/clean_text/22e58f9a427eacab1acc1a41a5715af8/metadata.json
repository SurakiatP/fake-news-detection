While the other red carpet reporters tried to get the attention of celebrities by yelling their names, he usually waited for them to come to him. And they usually did. Although Mr. Slonim specialized in light journalistic fare, he took it seriously. He wrote out his questions in advance and avoided the clich\u00e9d \u201cWho are you wearing?\u201d As a result, the quotations he gleaned had some charm. Kim Kardashian West marched straight to his side. Anne Hathaway greeted him with a kiss on the cheek. Gwyneth Paltrow and Melissa McCarthy breezed past the other   reporters to speak into the recorder that seemed permanently attached to his hand. \u201cHe was this little island of sanity at every red carpet,\u201d said Andy Cohen, the Bravo talk show host and author. \u201cWhen I read the news, I just thought, \u2018Wow, how sad. \u2019\u201d From the 1990s until it all came to a blunt and violent end on Oct. 13, Mr. Slonim, who died at age 56, was a steady and affable presence on the circuit, always neatly turned out and professional as he chronicled the endless balls and premieres. So when he jumped from the roof of a Lincoln Center building, it came as a shock to his relatives, friends and   not to mention the celebrities who considered him a gentleman among brutes. \u201cIt still doesn\u2019t register,\u201d said Mr. Slonim\u2019s brother, the artist Hunt Slonem (who spells the family name differently). \u201cIt\u2019s like, How? What happened? It\u2019s just so shocking. \u201d He paused. \u201cAnyway, he really made up his mind. \u201d Mr. Slonim\u2019s writing for Allure was his main source of income from the   until late 2015, when he lost his special correspondent position at the Cond\u00e9 Nast monthly. The change came as part of a cutback that followed the firing of the magazine\u2019s founding editor, Linda Wells. A few months later, Lena Dunham stopped on the red carpet to tell Mr. Slonim she missed his page. He appreciated that. \u201cWhat a doll,\u201d he wrote on Facebook. In the last year of his life, he was trying to piece together a living by turning out   items for Gotham, Architectural Digest, Hamptons, the New York Post Page Six column and other outlets. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say that\u2019s what he lived for,\u201d his wife, Fiona Moore, a school administrator, said, \u201cbut he really loved his work. \u201d He cut a stylish figure, never failing to dress for the occasions he covered, which meant crisp tuxes for galas and preppy seersucker suits for summertime Hamptons fetes. He wore his eyeglasses low on the bridge of his nose as he worked, and the J. Press scarf completed the look of someone who might have stepped out of a novel he loved, F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s \u201cTender Is the Night. \u201d But the man who might have struck casual onlookers as just another partygoer would inevitably leave the night\u2019s affair for his desk, where he stayed until his copy was ready to file. \u201cHardest working man in the business,\u201d said George Wayne, a veteran    journalist. \u201cThe thing about Jeff is, unlike some of us  \u2014   and I\u2019m one of them  \u2014   he didn\u2019t want to be part of the story. He was always the humble   wretch. He waited at the ropes with everybody else, in the herd. He didn\u2019t mind that. He was so unaffected and so good at his job. \u201d On a typical day, after working the carpet and filing his items, he would get into bed with his wife at 5 a. m. in their railroad apartment on the Upper East Side and sleep until 7:30. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a great sleeper,\u201d Ms. Moore said. After spending time with his two sons, he would take a nap  \u2014   then it was back to the job. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t believe the pace he kept,\u201d his brother, Mr. Slonem, said. \u201cHe\u2019d be up writing until 5, 6 in the morning. He seemed to have deadlines all the time. He\u2019d always say, \u2018I\u2019m on deadline  \u2014   I\u2019ve got to have this done in two hours.\u2019 For years this went on. \u201d To those who saw him only when he was in his element, Mr. Slonim seemed to lead a charmed life, unruffled in a milieu peopled with   celebrities and   publicists. He joined the media scrum at Interview magazine in 1984, when Andy Warhol was overseeing it, thanks, in part, to an introduction from his cousin, the writer Tama Janowitz. Mr. Slonim, a Yale graduate, class of 1982, took the job after an unhappy stint at IBM in Florida, where his habit of moonlighting as a cocktail pianist in a hotel bar suggested he was not cut out for corporate life. He spoke French, Italian, Spanish and Swedish. As a young man he banged out short stories on a portable typewriter. Friends fondly recalled him as an expert orchestrator of parties who sometimes entertained guests with his renditions of Scott Joplin rags and Cole Porter standards. What he did for a living gave him a   seat for the passing celebrity parade. He dined with Warhol at the Odeon. He stood nearby when Tommy Hilfiger got into a fistfight with Axl Rose in the V. I. P. area of the Chelsea club the Plumm. He saw Tom Cruise roar into a Vanity Fair Oscar party on a black Ducati motorcycle. When Prince held an impromptu,     at Lily Pond, a cozy East Hampton nightclub, Mr. Slonim stayed among the dozen or so select guests until 5 a. m. A son of the naval officer and nuclear engineer Capt. Charles E. Slonim, whose career took the family to Hawaii, New Hampshire, Virginia and Washington State, Mr. Slonim early on developed a knack for putting strangers at ease, a skill that came in handy on the red carpet. He met Fiona Moore, the woman who would become his wife, on the Greek island of Ios in the early 1990s. She was on vacation with friends, one of whom had just given her \u201cThe Andy Warhol Diaries\u201d as a birthday present. He let her know his name appeared as part of the entry for Thursday, Feb. 12, 1987: \u201cAnd Jeff Slonim from Interview, he\u2019s Tama\u2019s cousin, and he has perfect teeth, a beautiful toothpaste smile. \u201d In 1993, Ms. Moore moved into his Lexington Avenue apartment, which is still home for her and their two teenage sons. Their 1995 wedding took place in Cork, Ireland, not far from where Ms. Moore grew up. They found a priest who spoke Hebrew to officiate, as if to provide some middle ground for Mr. Slonim, who was Jewish, and the Roman Catholic Moore family. In his toast, the bride\u2019s father mentioned the Warhol line about Mr. Slonim\u2019s smile, adding that you could judge a horse by the quality of its teeth. Early in the marriage, there was a complication: Mr. Slonim had blood clots and difficulty walking. The diagnosis was polycythemia vera, a rare and   blood cancer that may be present for years before symptoms show up. To treat it, he was prescribed the drug Interferon, which he took at regular intervals from the time of his diagnosis until June of this year, according to three relatives. Ms. Moore saw how the changes in New York\u2019s night life and media business affected her husband\u2019s routine and fortunes. Things turned hectic in the giddy late 1990s, with Mr. Slonim working five nights a week soon after the birth of their first son and the onset of his health problem. But the end of the last decade produced a queasiness for Mr. Slonim and others who relied on magazines for their incomes. Blowback from the economic collapse, which coincided with the rise of digital media, made itself felt at Cond\u00e9 Nast Publications, the owner of Allure, in 2009. That is when a McKinsey  Company report led to a budget cut of 25 percent at several Cond\u00e9 Nast magazines. The company rid itself of Cookie, Details, Domino, Men\u2019s Vogue and Portfolio. Toward the end of 2015, amid layoffs at GQ, Glamour, Self and Teen Vogue, Mr. Slonim and 14 other Allure contributors lost their yearly contracts. The cutback occurred at roughly the same time as the firing of Ms. Wells. \u201cPeople were terrified and upset,\u201d Ms. Moore said. \u201cI think Linda being fired was devastating for him. \u201d The job of celebrity and society reporter, even one at the top of this rarefied field, seemed no longer enough for a family breadwinner. As Mr. Slonim grappled with this, his health issue came to the fore. In June, he stopped taking Interferon. He told his brother that his doctor had taken him off the drug because it was no longer effective for him. Ms. Moore said he started taking a new drug, in the same family as Interferon, but it left him in a low mood. Ray Rogers, an editor who worked with Mr. Slonim at Interview, BlackBook and other publications, was concerned when he saw his friend at an East Hampton benefit over the Labor Day weekend. \u201cI said to him: \u2018Jeff, what\u2019s wrong? Are you O. K.?\u2019\u201d Mr. Rogers said. \u201cHe looked despondent. He was not himself. And he was like, \u2018I\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Jeff, what\u2019s wrong?\u2019 I must have asked him that in three different ways. \u201d Mr. Slonim\u2019s work often took him to Lincoln Center, where the red carpet is rolled out dozens of nights every year. On Sept. 20, on assignment for Gotham magazine\u2019s website, he interviewed Sarah Jessica Parker and her husband, Matthew Broderick, at a Lincoln Center benefit for the New York City Ballet. On Oct. 7, also on assignment for Gotham, he covered the premiere of Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s \u201cJulieta,\u201d part of the 54th New York Film Festival. Earlier that day, he called his sister, a psychiatric social worker and professor, Anne Slonim Rafal, and said he was having dark thoughts. After she laid out counseling options for him, he said, as she recalled it, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m just being dramatic. \u201d At home, he told his wife about the call to his sister, and the two of them discussed the possibility of his going on an antidepressant. But Mr. Slonim was against the idea, partly because he did not like the way people looked when they were medicated. \u201cAnd then I said, \u2018Well, if you\u2019re on medication, you\u2019re actually going to feel so much better, so you\u2019re not going to care,\u201d Ms. Moore said. But her argument did not sway him. \u201cAnd that, I think, was probably the problem,\u201d she added. \u201cMaybe he should have started taking something. \u201d They spent the weekend in East Hampton, and things seemed to be looking up. \u201cIt was a lovely time,\u201d Ms. Moore said. \u201cHurricane Matthew was coming in, and we went to the beach and all of that. He kept saying, \u2018I feel so much better,\u2019 so of course I believed him. \u201d After the Hamptons idyll, Mr. Slonim went to    Cornell Medical Center to see his hematologist. He apparently spoke of his recent thoughts, and the hospital placed him under observation. His wife said he called from the hospital, saying he wanted to leave. Mr. Slonim also called his sister, Dr. Slonim Rafal, who advised him to be honest with staff members and to follow their recommendations. \u201cThey never admitted him,\u201d she said. \u201cThey just observed him for, I would say, 36 hours, maybe 48. \u201d \u201cHe wanted out of there, big time,\u201d Ms. Moore said. \u201cHe compared it to like the seven rings of hell, basically. \u201d (A public affairs officer at the hospital said that \u201cregarding Jeffrey Slonim,\u201d she had \u201cno information available. \u201d) Mr. Slonim was released and made his way home on the evening of Oct. 11, his wife said, and he seemed in good spirits. The next morning, they went for a run together, and he said, as she recalled it: \u201cI can see color for the first time. This is amazing. \u201d He was also making plans  \u2014   lunches for the following week and a meeting at the Cond\u00e9 Nast human resources department. \u201cHe felt he needed to reinvent himself, that print was dying,\u201d Ms. Moore said. \u201cSo he was working on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9. \u201d On the morning of Oct. 13, he went to Lincoln Center. The Laurie M. Tisch Illumination Lawn was closed, but he slipped past a chain gate and made his way to its northern edge, above the West 65th Street sidewalk. The lawn, which serves as the roof for the   Lincoln Ristorante, has become an architectural showpiece and neighborhood attraction since it opened to the public in 2010. At the time of the unveiling, the New York Times architectural critic Nicolai Ouroussoff singled out the lawn for praise in his review of the Lincoln Center renovations: \u201cThe project\u2019s most dazzling space, the lawn warps up on two sides, so that climbing it can make you feel as if you were about to float off into the air on a carpet of green. \u201d At its high point, the    expanse of grass is 23 feet above the sidewalk. At 10:52 a. m. someone called 911. Documents from the New York Police Department note \u201ca    male who\u2019s observed pacing    on a roof and sitting on a ledge. \u201d A crowd formed outside the entrances to the restaurant and the nearby Elinor Bunin Film Center. Two Lincoln Center security guards were talking to Mr. Slonim, and it seemed to be working. At one point, he turned around and moved away from the ledge  \u2014   only to come back. People screamed \u201cNo!\u201d when he made his move and hit the sidewalk below. \u201cAt 11:05 a. m. the unit was on scene,\u201d a spokeswoman for the Fire Department of New York said in an email. \u201cThe unit departed the scene at 11:13 a. m. with one patient to   Hospital. \u201d Despite the doctors\u2019 efforts, Mr. Slonim died later that day, his wife said. \u201cHere\u2019s a guy who spent his whole career covering high society  \u2014   and to take his life, he walked over to Lincoln Center and jumped,\u201d his friend Mr. Rogers said. \u201cIt seemed intentional to me. It seemed pointed. \u201d Back in the apartment, Ms. Moore found a note on the computer. \u201cHe\u2019s rambling and stuff,\u201d she said, \u201cbut he thanks a couple of people, and he thanks Linda Wells. It\u2019s really sweet. \u201d With tears streaming down her face during an interview in her apartment, she went on: \u201cI understand the whole concept of  \u2014   not that he committed suicide, but suicide took him. I know that he didn\u2019t have a choice. Because it wasn\u2019t him that did this. I know he would never dream of doing that and leaving us. And I know that. \u201d Julianne Moore was another movie star who made a beeline toward Mr. Slonim at red carpet events. Their relationship went back to the   when they were each other\u2019s dates for a homecoming dance at J. E. B. Stuart High School in Falls Church, Va. On the rainy, dark afternoon of Dec. 18, Ms. Moore was among the roughly 350 mourners crowded into the Fourth Universalist Society church on Central Park West. Nearby sat Mr. Slonim\u2019s wife and their sons. Speakers included his two sisters, who recalled the Superman costume he wore as a boy his    Dominic Moore, who described his generosity with the swag bags he picked up at parties the   film producer Bruce Cohen, who reminisced about his days with Mr. Slonim in middle school, at Yale and on the red carpet and the former Allure editor Ms. Wells, who spoke last. \u201cJeffrey hit the red carpet and he loved it,\u201d she said. \u201cWhich sounds hard to believe, now that the red carpet is so often a shouting match and a total fame orgy. But he did, and he respected it, too. \u201d After describing his amusing encounters with Roseanne Barr, George Clooney and Donald J. Trump, she continued: \u201cYou could tell he had a genuine connection with the subjects, many of whom made a ritual out of greeting him with a kiss. He gave as much time and attention to the Oscar winner as he did to the guy who was voted off \u2018Survivor: Borneo. \u2019\u201d A montage of still photographs projected onto a small movie screen gave glimpses of Mr. Slonim from babyhood to adulthood. After the clergyman said a few final words, the mourners stayed in place for a long moment, silent and not quite ready to leave.'"}, "time": 1742564304.3741615}
