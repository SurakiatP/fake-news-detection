So maybe Sean Spicer, I know you don\u2019t get this, but perhaps an apology to the former    for accusing him of a federal crime, of a felony. The problem for me is when you know you\u2019re wrong when the FBI, CIA, KFC, LMNOP said this didn\u2019t happen and you double down on the lie. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742628471.1029866}
