Photographers captured disturbing images of the aftermath. Many of the   areas in the south were completely cut off from rescue workers by severed phone lines and collapsed bridges until Thursday. Men in   searched for a place to cross La Digue river after the only bridge linking to the south collapsed. Buildings were ravaged, including the Ste.  church in Les Cayes, below. \u201cThat many people died because they never believed what the authorities told them when they said they had to evacuate,\u201d said Jean Senozier Despreux, who lives and works in Les Cayes and weathered the storm there. \u201cThey resisted it. \u201d Mr. Despreux said the death toll was not surprising. \u201cWe knew we would continue find people under the rubble,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was so intense there was no way out. \u201d In J\u00e9r\u00e9mie, burials had already begun on Thursday. In Les Cayes, across the peninsula from J\u00e9r\u00e9mie, people lost their homes, livestock and possessions. A street vendor, below, sold food on the side of a road after the storm. At least 20, 000 homes were damaged across the country, officials said.'"}, "time": 1742563394.2077355}
