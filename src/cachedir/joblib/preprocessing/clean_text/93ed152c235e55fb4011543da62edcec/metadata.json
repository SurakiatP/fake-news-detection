Trump will seal his presidential victory  \u2014   despite losing the national popular vote by a significant margin. His Electoral College lead should be substantial, since he won states worth 306 electoral votes to 232 from states won by Hillary Clinton. Yet the nearly final popular vote count has him trailing by nearly three million votes, or 2. 1 percentage points, the largest deficit for a winning candidate since 1876\u2019s notorious election. How exactly did we end up with such divergent results? Liberals say Mr. Trump\u2019s victory is proof that the Electoral College is biased against big states and undemocratically marginalizes urban and nonwhite voters. Conservatives say the Electoral College serves as a necessary bulwark against big states, preventing California in particular from imposing \u201csomething like colonial rule over the rest of the nation,\u201d as the conservative analyst Michael Barone put it. California sided with Mrs. Clinton by a vote margin of four million, or 30 percentage points. Both sides have a point. But in the end, Mr. Trump won for a simple reason: The Electoral College\u2019s (largely)    design gives a lot of weight to battleground states. Mr. Trump had an advantage in the traditional battlegrounds because most are whiter and less educated than the country as a whole. But Mr. Trump\u2019s success in those states isn\u2019t just about demographics. It\u2019s about quirks of history, like the outcome of a battle over Toledo, Ohio. It\u2019s about gains by Mrs. Clinton that went unrewarded. It\u2019s also about plain luck. One argument in favor of the Electoral College is that it doesn\u2019t reward regionalism: a candidate who wins with huge margins in one part of the country. That\u2019s because a    system doesn\u2019t reward any additional votes beyond what\u2019s necessary to win a state or a region. You get all of Florida\u2019s electoral votes, whether you win it by 537 or 537, 000 votes. A good example of how regionalism can drive a   vote split is the 1888 election. The Democrat, Grover Cleveland, won the popular vote by nearly a point, but he lost the Electoral College by a margin similar to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s. Why? He won the popular vote by dominating the Deep South, where white supremacist Democrats had succeeded in disenfranchising Republican black voters since the end of Reconstruction. Even progressives would consider this a moral victory for the Electoral College. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s big win in California was, on paper, potentially enough to be \u201cresponsible\u201d for the   vote split in the same way that the Deep South drove Mr. Cleveland\u2019s popular vote win in 1888. But unlike the situation in 1888, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s huge victory in California (along with the District of Columbia and Hawaii, where Mrs. Clinton won by a higher percentage than she did in California) was almost entirely canceled out by Mr. Trump\u2019s dominance of his base states  \u2014   which we\u2019ll call Appalachafornia  \u2014   from West Virginia to Wyoming. (\u201cAppalachafornia\u201d consists of West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Alabama, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, North Dakota and South Dakota.) Mrs. Clinton led in the rest of the country by the same   margin after excluding Appalachafornia and California  \u2014   and yet she still loses the Electoral College vote by about the same margin. That\u2019s not how it went in 1888: The Republicans didn\u2019t waste nearly as many votes in their best states, so they actually led in the vote in the rest of the country. They won the Electoral College as well. Whatever danger conservatives face from \u201cimperial\u201d California in a popular vote is matched by the threat Democrats would face from an \u201cimperial\u201d Appalachafornia. Regionalism alone is not why Mr. Trump won without the popular vote. The Electoral College isn\u2019t just a check against regionalism. It also reflects our federal system by awarding an electoral vote for every senator and representative. The result is that small states get more sway, since senators aren\u2019t awarded by population. Wyoming, the least populous state, has    of California\u2019s population. Yet it has   of California\u2019s electoral votes. In general, the Electoral College\u2019s   bias does hurt the Democrats. In fact, the   bias tipped the 2000 election. Al Gore would have won the presidency, 225 to 211, if electors were just awarded by representative, not by senators and representatives. But the   bias was almost entirely irrelevant to Mr. Trump\u2019s advantage. Mrs. Clinton won plenty of small states  \u2014   she won seven of the 12 smallest. Mr. Trump, meanwhile, won plenty of big states  \u2014   in fact, he won seven of the 10 largest. As a consequence, the result would have been virtually identical if states had not received electoral votes for their senators. It would have even been the same if the electors had been apportioned exactly by a state\u2019s population. O. K. so it\u2019s not California and it\u2019s not   bias. What is it? It\u2019s the Electoral College\u2019s most straightforward bias: The battleground states count the most. Mrs. Clinton did well in noncompetitive states and \u201cwasted\u201d popular votes that didn\u2019t earn her any more electoral votes, while Mr. Trump did just well enough in competitive states to pick up their electoral votes. There are, of course, two halves to this effect: \u25a0 Mrs. Clinton fared better in the remaining blue states, outside of California and Hawaii, than Mr. Trump did in the remaining red states, outside of \u201cAppalachafornia. \u201d Mrs. Clinton won states like Illinois and New York by a much larger margin than Mr. Trump won similarly sized red states like Georgia and Texas. Compared with President Obama in 2012, Mrs. Clinton made sizable gains in many of the red states outside of Appalachafornia, including a big   improvement in Texas  \u2014   yet won no electoral votes from them. \u25a0 Mr. Trump did very well in the battleground states. Depending on how the battlegrounds are defined, the vote there either broke for Mr. Trump or was virtually tied  \u2014   a huge improvement over Mitt Romney\u2019s showing in 2012. Mr. Trump won a lopsided electoral vote tally from those states by narrowly winning four of the five states decided by around one point or less: Florida, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania (Mrs. Clinton edged him out in New Hampshire). Outside of those five states, the electoral vote was basically tied, with Mr. Trump edging out Mrs. Clinton, 231 to 228 (and leading by the margin of   bias). The imbalance between competitive and battleground states is somewhat similar to a regionalism issue, at least in a mathematical sense: Mrs. Clinton won the \u201cblue states\u201d by a wider margin than Mr. Trump won the \u201cred states. \u201d The rest of the country  \u2014   the battlegrounds  \u2014   voted Republican, and so did the Electoral College. But this isn\u2019t a regionalism issue. The \u201csolid red\u201d and \u201csolid blue\u201d states where Mr. Trump failed to make gains include a clear majority of the country\u2019s Electoral College votes, population and actual votes. The regional anomaly was the Midwest, and it just so happens that in a    system Mr. Trump\u2019s strength in the Midwestern battleground states yielded a lot of Electoral College votes. There\u2019s a real demographic reason for it: Most of the traditional battleground states are much whiter, less educated and particularly less Hispanic than the rest of the country. But the demographics alone don\u2019t quite do justice to Mr. Trump\u2019s victory in the Electoral College. In the end, he won the battleground states by just a   margin  \u2014   but claimed   of their Electoral College votes. He won four of the five closest states, winning 75 of 79 votes at stake. There has never been a close election in the United States in which one candidate has claimed such a resounding electoral vote margin out of the closest states. For lack of a better word: Mr. Trump had some very good luck. There\u2019s nothing about the distribution of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s votes in the battlegrounds or nationally that meant she was destined to get as few electoral votes as she did. Just take Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan  \u2014   three contiguous states spanning the Upper Great Lakes. Mrs. Clinton actually won the region by a narrow margin, but she won just 10 of the 36 votes at stake. Ultimately, state lines are pretty arbitrary. Yes, when those lines were determined, there were reasoned considerations like population and access to rivers and resources. But statehood and state lines, often poorly surveyed in the first place, were hotly disputed in the 19th century. Many states were created in response to political considerations, especially the balance between free and slave states. In other times, it could have gone very differently. Consider two of the bigger nonpolitical state boundary questions of the 19th century: the fate of the Florida Panhandle and the \u201cToledo War. \u201d The Toledo War was a long dispute between Michigan and Ohio over a tiny strip of land along their border, which happens to include the city of Toledo. Ohio had the upper hand for one reason: It earned its statehood first, and therefore blocked Michigan\u2019s petition  \u2014   which included the strip. In the end, Congress proposed a deal: Michigan would relinquish its claim on the Toledo strip and, in exchange, would get the Upper Peninsula. The Florida Panhandle and the Florida Peninsula were governed as separate regions  \u2014   West and East Florida  \u2014   under Spanish and British rule. They were effectively separated by hundreds of miles of treacherous swamp and forest. Ultimately, West and East Florida were combined into one state. This was mainly coincidental: Alabama earned statehood before the Florida territory was annexed. West Florida repeatedly tried to join Alabama, starting as soon as the state was annexed and lasting all the way past the Civil War. Many of these efforts  \u2014   which included referendums, congressional petitions and direct negotiations between Florida and Alabama  \u2014   nearly succeeded. But they ultimately did not. If these minor border issues had gone differently, Mrs. Clinton would probably be president. The Florida Panhandle is heavily Republican: Without it, the rest of Florida votes Democratic. Both halves of the Toledo War worked out poorly for Mrs. Clinton. Not only would she have won Michigan with Toledo, but she would have also won Michigan without the Upper Peninsula: Only the full trade gives Mr. Trump a narrow win. Interestingly, the same changes would have flipped the 2000 election, and perhaps the 1876 election, to the same result as the national popular vote (though I don\u2019t have   results for Florida in that election). The pronounced regionalism at play in 1888 would have made it harder to change the outcome by tweaking state lines. To be clear, you can also make plenty of changes that would benefit Republicans. You could reunify West Virginia and Virginia, to take an easy one. The point is that the main bias of the Electoral College isn\u2019t against big states or regionalism it\u2019s just toward the big battleground states. If they break overwhelmingly one way, that\u2019s who wins. This is not exactly a   Hamiltonian argument. There aren\u2019t many justifications for letting a few close states decide a close national election. But that\u2019s basically what the system does, and there\u2019s nothing about those states that ensures they provide a representative outcome.'"}, "time": 1742628422.1446054}
