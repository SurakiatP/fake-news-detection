I thought I was a decent human being, and this was a decent country, but fuck it, this is where we\u2019re at now,\u201d shared New Yorker Bernice Stewart. \\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s something I want, I abhor murder, but give it a few months and when Trump hasn\u2019t made America great again by placing US Muslims in internment camps, I\u2019ve every faith in him stirring the sorts of emotions in a mentally unstable individual required to break our 53-year streak,\u201d another voter remarked. \\nExperts in slowly unraveling individuals with access to guns even speculated that the ultimate cause of the assassination may be seemingly insignificant. \\n\u201cRight now, no one is focused enough to remember Trump said he would release his tax returns, but when he delays that disclosure again and again, someone who never really gave a shit about that might start studying a map of tall buildings surrounding his victory parade route in New York. It could be one of those very people Trump mobilised to vote; working class, jobless and perennially ignored by the political establishment that will pull the trigger, ironic really,\u201d isolated loner expert Condie Matthews explained. \\nSecret Service personnel, tasked with bodyguarding and protecting the president, resigned en masse this morning stating they \u2018don\u2019t get paid enough for this shit\u2019.'"}, "time": 1742563839.9692056}
