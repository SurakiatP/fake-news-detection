She had a hand in choreographing Missy Elliott\u2019s surprise appearance at the 2015 Super Bowl halftime show. She created several of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s    dance moves from her \u201cDiva\u201d video from 2008. She even appeared in front of the camera, in a promotional dance video for Iggy Azalea\u2019s single \u201cTeam. \u201d But that wasn\u2019t enough. In an era when dance has exploded thanks to social media, Ms. Miranda wanted to share her dance moves, unfiltered, with the rest of the world. So in 2014, she hired a videographer to tape her dance studio in the North Hollywood neighborhood of Los Angeles, with students performing her signature moves, blending   swagger with a gymnastic breakneck pace. The first video, with a series of   dancers strutting their stuff to Nicki Minaj\u2019s \u201cAnaconda,\u201d was uploaded to YouTube and has gotten more than 27 million views. Another video, set to Rihanna\u2019s \u201cBitch Better Have My Money,\u201d has been viewed 41 million times. Since then, Ms. Miranda\u2019s YouTube channel, which shows a diverse set of dancers (some as young as 6) performing new routines to the latest hits by Tinashe, Pitbull and others, has racked up more than one million subscribers. Such attention has turned Ms. Miranda into a budding celebrity, with strangers coming up to her at hotels, grocery stores, restaurants and on the street. \u201cI had a waiter recently cry when he met me,\u201d she said. \u201cHe politely asked me for a picture and got emotional because I have inspired him so much. \u201d Her fame is about to get bigger. Ms. Miranda is starring in a new MTV series, tentatively titled \u201cGoing Off,\u201d in which a new young dancer will be crowned at her master class studio in each episode. \u201cI\u2019ve been a dance instructor for 15 years,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t until I got big on YouTube that I started getting this much attention. \u201d Not since Paula Abdul, a dancer who went on to become a pop and TV personality, has the role of the choreographer been so appreciated in popular culture. \u201cDancing is language agnostic,\u201d said Kevin Allocca, YouTube\u2019s head of culture and trends. \u201cPeople around the world can watch, learn and upload their own moves. \u201d   platforms like YouTube, Vine and Snapchat have not only expanded the reach of seasoned choreographers like Ms. Miranda, they have also turned choreographers of all kinds, who traditionally toil behind the scenes, into stars in their own right. The new celebrity choreographers include Ryan Heffington, a    dance instructor from Los Angeles with a distinctive handlebar mustache and long curly hair, who masterminded Sia\u2019s \u201cChandelier\u201d video (which features the young performer Maddie Ziegler dancing by herself in an apartment). Parris Goebel, 24, is the New Zealander behind Justin Bieber\u2019s \u201cSorry\u201d video (which features an   dance crew dressed in \u201990s neon). Elle magazine recently called Ms. Goebel the world\u2019s most     choreographer. At 36, Ms. Miranda acts as a den mother of sorts for the clutch of young dancers who flock to the Basement of NoHo, her studio in North Hollywood, a grittier neighborhood in the San Fernando Valley that has become an unofficial dance hub. \u201cThese kids are becoming YouTube stars, too,\u201d she said, referring to    such as Jade Chynoweth, a    dancer and aspiring actress with model looks and 358, 000 Instagram followers, or Kaycee Rice, a    from Simi Valley, Calif. who performed at Missy Elliott\u2019s halftime show. Another, Aidan Xiong, an adorable    break dancer, appeared on Ellen DeGeneres\u2019s show in 2014. On a recent Saturday morning, Ms. Miranda was being filmed in her studio for a TV commercial for Mania Jeans, an Israeli streetwear brand. (\u201cI have a huge following in Israel,\u201d she said.) Clad in baggy sweatpants, oversize gold hoop earrings, chocolate brown lipstick and two Willie Nelson braids, she fired off a series of   commands to her pack of millennial dancers. \u201cSix, seven   \u2026     and one and four,\u201d she called out, followed by a succession of     punctuated by foot stomps. After a feverish routine, she summoned her posse, many in midriff shirts emblazoned with slogans like \u201cKeep It Real,\u201d for a group selfie, which she posted on Instagram. Born in Arizona, Ms. Miranda started ballet and tap at age 4. By 19, she was teaching   classes. She moved to Los Angeles in 2001 to be closer to the action, and she made ends meet as a waitress and as a dance instructor at Gold\u2019s Gym. Her big break came in 2004, when her agent tipped her off that Beyonc\u00e9 was looking for a backup dancer for her Ladies First Tour. \u201cI was a hostess at the time when they called me to tell me I got the gig,\u201d she said. \u201cI immediately took off my apron, turned to my manager and said: \u2018I\u2019m going on tour with Beyonc\u00e9. I\u2019ve got to go. \u2019\u201d Ms. Miranda has never looked back. Her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes dance credits with Gwen Stefani and Taylor Swift, who are drawn to her   style, and Prince. \u201cI liked how aggressive her choreography was,\u201d Ms. Azalea said. \u201cEven the smallest movement dripped with confidence. I wanted dancers that could be unapologetic, and that\u2019s what Tricia delivers. \u201d Her influence is such that some artists now want their songs used on her YouTube channel. \u201cTricia is recognizing the songs of the moment and making them even bigger songs of the moment,\u201d said Amanda Taylor, the chief executive of DanceOn, an entertainment network centered on dance that counts Madonna as a founder. Speaking in a hallway outside her rehearsal studio, Ms. Miranda said she was still getting used to her fame. She laughed at first when she received messages on Instagram and Facebook, with pictures of fans parroting her   look. \u201cIt\u2019s a little strange for me,\u201d she said. With that, she got up and returned to rehearsal. \u201cAll right, back to work everyone,\u201d she said with the clap of her hands.'"}, "time": 1742628416.9249904}
