[Sources close to the Abedin family told the New York Post that \u201cHuma has been working hard on her relationship with Anthony. He has been spending 80 to 90 percent of his time at the [Irving Place apartment] they share. If there is a disagreement, he goes to his mother\u2019s apartment in Brooklyn. \u201d  \u201cBoth [his and her] families are hoping they will reconcile,\u201d the source continued. Another source supported this story, saying that the couple\u2019s separation was \u201cmore for optics for the campaign and pressure from Hillary\u2019s camp. \u201d The potential reconciliation is perhaps surprising given Weiner\u2019s multiple sexting scandals. The first, exposed in 2011 by the late Andrew Breitbart and dubbed \u2018Weinergate,\u2019 led to Weiner\u2019s resignation from Congress and the issuing of a public apology. In 2013, having declared himself a candidate to be mayor of New York, other photos were published of Weiner sexting another woman under the name \u2018Carlos Danger.\u2019 Despite the revelation, Weiner did not pull out the race and eventually finished fifth with just 4. 9 percent of the vote. In August last year, Abedin revealed that she was separating from Weiner after yet another sexting incident, although she said the pair would continue to work together to raise their son, who could even be seen in one of Weiner\u2019s photos. EXCLUSIVE: Anthony Weiner sexted a busty brunette while his son was in bed with him https:  .  pic. twitter.   \u2014   New York Post (@nypost) August 29, 2016,  Last October, Weiner checked into a sex addiction facility to overcome his urges, although he was reportedly forced to leave early having run out of money to pay for it. He was also investigated by the FBI over claims he had been sexting a    girl. A laptop examined in that investigation reportedly contained emails from Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server, as both Weiner and Abedin used the device. This development led FBI Director James Comey to announce that the bureau   its investigation of Clinton\u2019s handling of classified information. The Clinton campaign to this day claims the Comey announcement caused significant damage to her candidacy. The girl claimed that Weiner sent her nude photos, shared pornographic videos with her, discussed his \u201crape fantasies,\u201d and requested that she undress and masturbate during video calls. In January, media reports revealed that federal prosecutors were looking into potential charges against Weiner for child pornography, However, despite all this, Abedin is apparently \u201cstill in love\u201d with Weiner, blaming the \u201cpressures of the campaign and presidential race and him drifting off into obscurity\u201d for his latest relapse. \u201cA lot of [their] friends believe this is an illness, that he is sick. [But] Huma takes it into consideration that there\u2019s been no affair, or physical contact that anybody is aware of. He never met [the women],\u201d the family friend added.
