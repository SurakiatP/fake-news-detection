Another difference is that the French tend not to raise their children on the additive-laced food that parents in the U.S so, coincidence?These two very different cultures have different ADHD levels in children, in America the rate is 19 percent, and in France, it\u2019s .5% \u2013 a half of a percent. For that half percent, the treatment includes no chemical or medicine whatsoever, opting for older fashioned methods.French children are subjected to much less sugar and additive-laden foods. Sugary cereals, fast food and fizzy drinks are consumed in much less volume than in the U.S, they are not shown the same advert driven television programs and lead an altogether more simple life.In 1998, Dr. Edward C. Hamlyn of the Royal College of General Practitioners said: \u201cADHD is fraud intended to justify starting children on a life of drug addiction\".

There are now 5 million children in the U.S. on Ritalin or Adderall who have been resigned to either a life sentence of these drugs, or the awful process of weening themselves off them if they decide to do so.
