It is ILLEGAL!\u201d \\nThe same thing happened in 2012, Goldenfield noted. The suburban Cincinnati county is overwhelmingly Republican; Mitt Romney got 69 percent of the vote four years ago. It\u2019s been almost 40 years since a Democrat was elected to countywide office. \\nGoldenfield told The Enquirer the Warren County Sheriff\u2019s Office called her around 7:45 a.m. Saturday alerting her to the manure pile outside the Lebanon building. Deputies met party officials later to review video. \\n\u201cHopefully the perps will be held accountable for their actions,\u201d she said. \\nJeff Monroe, chairman of the Warren County Republican Party, said the GOP had nothing to do with the manure \u201cand has offered to help clean things up.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742562491.4938955}
