November 1, 2016 Daniel Greenfield \\nDaniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is a New York writer focusing on radical Islam. \\nA generation ago the Communist tyranny in Cuba demanded that the United Nations condemn America for the embargo. The brutal Castro regime\u2019s rant accused the United States of threatening \u201cnuclear annihilation,\u201d \u201ccountless acts of sabotage and plans to assassinate Cuban leaders.\u201d \\nOn a cold day in October, the European left-wing activist serving as UN Ambassador announced to applause that her administration would no longer be voting to defend the US at the UN. \\n\"UN Member States have voted overwhelmingly for a General Assembly resolution that condemns the U.S. embargo and calls for it to be ended. The United States has always voted against this resolution. Today the United States will abstain,\" Samantha Power said. \\n\"Thank you,\" she added, acknowledging the applause. \\nUnder Obama, the United States would no longer defend the United States. A generation ago the Communists had been in Cuba. Now they were in Washington D.C. \\nInstead of defending America, Obama\u2019s chosen representative agreed that our Communist enemies had a point about our lack of human rights and our imperialist foreign policy. \\n\u201cLet me be among the first to acknowledge \u2013 as our Cuban counterparts often point out \u2013 that the United States has work to do in fulfilling these rights for our own citizens. And we know that at times in our history, U.S. leaders and citizens used the pretext of promoting democracy and human rights in the region to justify actions that have left a deep legacy of mistrust,\u201d she said. \\nIf the Cuban representative had been in her place, he could not have done much better. Communist Cuban propaganda was now being parroted by Ambassador Power. If the Castro dictatorship wanted to save money, it could shut down its propaganda department and outsource the labor to Washington D.C. \\nThe Cuban ambassador boasted that Cuban Communists had \u201crid ourselves of US imperialism\u201d and proclaimed that, \u201cWe will never go back to capitalism.\u201d He declared that the resolution was a powerful message to \u201cthe peoples of the world.\u201d The message is indeed unmistakable. \\nBen Rhodes, the close Obama adviser who sold the media on the Iran sellout, curtly tweeted his justification, \u201cNo reason to vote to defend a failed policy we oppose.\u201d \\nWho is this \u201cwe\u201d? \\nThe Cuban embargo is the \u201claw of the land\u201d. It\u2019s the official policy of the United States. It\u2019s based on laws passed by Congress and implemented by President John F. Kennedy and his successors. \\nThis \u201cwe\u201d certainly isn\u2019t the United States government, its elected representatives in the legislative and executive branches working together to end the old policy and implement a new one. \\nOne member of the \u201cwe\u201d must be Ben Rhodes because he tells us so. Who is Rhodes? An \u201caspiring\u201d novelist who pushed Obama to back the Muslim Brotherhood takeover of Egypt, the Iran nuke sellout and now, apparently, choosing Communist Cuba over America. \\nNo one has ever elected Rhodes to anything, but under left-wing rule, he outweighs Congress, President Kennedy, the law of the land and the national interests of the United States. \\n\u201cWe\u201d is Obama who made the final decision. It\u2019s Ambassador Samantha Power. It\u2019s a number of other functionaries all of whom derive their power from a single elected official who is only one third of the government. This is the \u201cwe\u201d that announced its treasonous opposition to the US at the UN. \\nAmerica has a \u201cwe\u201d problem. \\nIf the \u201cwe\u201d of the American left wants to vote its own way, it should secede to form its own country. \\nWhen President John F. Kennedy proclaimed the \u201cEmbargo on All Trade with Cuba\u201d, he based it on authorization from \u201cthe Congress of the United States\u201d. That is how our system used to work. \\nThese days El Teleprompte in D.C. decides that he wants to sign a nuclear treaty with Iran, mandate transgender bathrooms, legalize millions of illegal aliens or open relations with his brother tyrant in Havana and he does so on his own authority. And Congress is dismissed as a bunch of obstructionists. \\nThat\u2019s not how America is supposed to work. That\u2019s how Iran works. That\u2019s how Cuba works. \\nThe first word in the introduction to Obama\u2019s Presidential Policy Directive on Cuba after the date was \u201cI\u201d. Obama\u2019s basis for his authority is his 2014 announcement. L\\'etat c\\'est moi. Obama is the State. \\nJFK, no humble shrinking violet, mentions \u201cI\u201d only in the fourth paragraph, after Congress. What is the context of Kennedy\u2019s \u201cI\u201d? \u201cNow, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority of section 620(a) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.\u201d \\nThe \u201cI\u201d of JFK can only act as a servant, not a master. \\nIn Obama\u2019s \u201cDirective\u201d, Congress exists only to be berated or badgered for its obstructionism. There is no source of authorization for anything other than Barack Obama. There is no law. Only Obama. \\nNow the big \u201cwe\u201d in Washington have decided that they will oppose America at the United Nations. But Ben Rhodes, who aspires to excel at novelistic narratives, made an unfortunate slip. Obama has been accused of Louis XIV\u2019s L\\'etat c\\'est moi mentality. But Ben Rhodes isn\u2019t saying, \u201cWe are the state\u201d. Instead he tells us that there are two powerful political entities in America. One is US. The other is We. \\n\u201cWe\u201d does not yet entirely control the state. But \u201cwe\u201d also feels no obligation to the United States. If \u201cwe\u201d agrees with America, then \u201cwe\u201d will vote with it at the UN. If \u201cwe\u201d opposes America, then \u201cwe\u201d votes against it. \u201cWe\u201d will choose patriotism or treason based on its own interests. Not ours. \\n\u201cWe\u201d happens to run America. But it isn\u2019t America. It\u2019s the parasite humped on America\u2019s back. \\nYou can call \u201cwe\u201d by many names. Deep State is one. It\u2019s a coalition of left-wing special interests networking through politics, the non-profit sector and media corporations to control America. \\nPresident Kennedy was quite familiar with the enemy . \u201cWe are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence--on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice.\u201d \\nKennedy was speaking after the recent Bay of Pigs crisis. The Foreign Assistance Act, mentioned by him, was passed by Congress that year. While the Cuban embargo limited the ability of the Castro regime to sponsor and spread terror around the region and the world, it didn\u2019t stop the \u201cwe\u201d in Washington D.C. \\nIt is easy to sit here in the distant future of 2016 and wonder whether Cuba matters at all. But the truth is that we are still enmeshed in the same fundamental struggle of the Cold War. That struggle did not end when the Berlin Wall fell. It is a battle over whether nations will be ruled by \u201cWe the People\u201d or by the nameless \u201cWe\u201d of the monolithic and ruthless conspiracy of the Nomenklatura of the left. \\nBy backing away from America at the United Nations, the \u201cwe\u201d have announced their independence from the laws, responsibilities and duties of the country whose government they have hijacked. \\nBut the \u201cwe\u201d offer us no such independence from their treasonous rule. Instead they impose on us the collectivism of Yevgeny Zamyatin\\'s novel \u201cWe\u201d in which everyone suffers under the stifling progressive tyranny of the One State that controls every aspect of human life. That novel inspired 1984. \\nWhat \u201cwe\u201d offer us is what Cuba\u2019s Castro, We\u2019s One State and every Communist regime offer us. It\\'s what George Orwell in 1984 summed up as, \u201cA boot stamping on a human face \u2014 forever.\u201d \\nPresident Kennedy dated his embargo proclamation from the \u201cone hundred and eighty-sixth\u201d year of \u201cthe Independence of the United States of America.\u201d At the United Nations, Ambassador Power cheerfully declared America\u2019s enforced submission to the Communist demands for Cuba. \\nThe Cuban people show no signs of winning independence from their Communist overlords. The question is will the United States of America be able to regain its independence from the \u201cwe\u201d?'"}, "time": 1742628570.081177}
