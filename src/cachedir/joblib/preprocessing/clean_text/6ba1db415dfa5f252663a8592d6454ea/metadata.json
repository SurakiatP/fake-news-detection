The complainant implied that Flowers was only hired because of her alleged relationship with Clinton.\\n From December 1990 to December 1991, Flowers famously recorded a series of conversations with Clinton during the period he was Governor of Arkansas and considering a run for the presidency.\\nOn October 1991, Clinton announced his bid for the Oval Office, with rumors of extramarital affairs threatening to derail his campaign.\\nFlowers recently provided this reporter with complete original cassette recordings of her taped conversations with Clinton, recordings that take on renewed significance as the issue of Clinton\u2019s alleged treatment of women has reemerged during the 2016 presidential campaign.\\nThe sections of the audio recordings related to the state job are not exclusive to Breitbart News. Those excerpts were played for the news media in 1992, one day after Bill and Hillary Clinton appeared side by side on 60 Minutes , where Bill denied a relationship with Flowers.\\nClinton later admitted to one sexual encounter with Flowers in a 1998 deposition for the Paula Jones lawsuit.\\nThe audio segments about the state job were widely reported by the news media in the 1990\u2019s. However, the details may warrant revisiting amid numerous Clinton financial scandals that have since surfaced alleging pay-for-play, including those tied to the Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative.\\nIn one section of the audio, which can be heard above, Flowers discusses the grievance filed against her and informs Clinton that she was being questioned about how she obtained the position.\\nClinton says \u201cGood for you,\u201d when Flowers tells him that she found out about the job from a newspaper advertisement and pursued it from there.\\nHere is a transcript of that part of the audio:\\nGF \u2013 But anyway, then Wednesday, there was a grievance filed in my office when I got the job by a girl who felt like she should have gotten it, a black girl named (deleted). And they called me as a witness. So I go in and uh, nothing big came of it. It\u2019s just that they were questioning me about how I found out about the job. And I said, \u201cWell, that personnel said it that it was a possibility there would be a position,\u201d and then uh, \u201cthey told me that it would be advertised in the newspaper. And it was and I pursued it from there.\\nBC \u2013 Good for you.\\nGF \u2013 Well, it caught me off guard \u2018cause I\u2026 at first I just didn\u2019t know\u2026 I just didn\u2019t expect that for some reason. I thought about a whole lot of things about my qualifications and all that business, but I didn\u2019t think about that.\\nBC \u2013 Yeah.\\nIn the next section of the audio, Flowers expresses concern that the news media, which was asking her questions about the alleged affair, could find out about the state job.\\nGF: Yeah. We had a little bit of a scare recently because she had a spot on an X-ray. And she went and had it checked again and it wasn\u2019t cancer. And it\u2019s been almost, it\u2019ll be two years in May that she\u2019s now diagnosed cancer free. My stepfather has been through two angioplasties, but he\u2019s doing good. And I am, I\u2019m really, Bill what I\u2019m afraid of is that if somebody in the press finds out that I\u2019m working for the state.\\nBC \u2013 Yeah.\\nGF \u2013 They\u2019re going to make a big deal of it.\\nBC \u2013 Yeah.\\nIn a subsequent conversation, Clinton specifically counsels Flowers to say \u201cno\u201d if she is asked about whether she discussed the state job with him.\\nHere is a transcript:\\nGF \u2013 Well the only thing that concerns me, where I\u2019m, where I\u2019m concerned at this point is the state job.\\nBC \u2013 Yeah. I never thought about that, but as long as you say you\u2019ve just been looking for one, you\u2019d uh, check on it. If they ever asked if you\u2019d talked to me about it, you can say no.\\nGF \u2013 Well and I would. But I\u2019m\u2026 here is the thing I\u2019ve got to consider, too, is I\u2019ve gotta go in there to work every day. You know what I mean?\\nBC \u2013 Yep.\\nGF \u2013 And if, and if these people start talking or someone in the press\u2026\\nBC \u2013 Well, have they been nice to you there?\\nGF \u2013 Yeah they have been. But I don\u2019t, you know, I mean, I just want you to know what\u2019s going on. And I\u2019ll be glad to hang in there.\\nBC \u2013 Has the, has the\u2026\\nGF \u2013 But if it gets real\u2026\\nBC \u2013 Has the grievance committee ruled yet?\\nGF \u2013 No. Not that I am aware of. Uh, I forget the guy\u2019s name that appeared to be the head of it. Dudley or Dewey. Is there a Dudley or a Dewy or somebody? Do you know?\\nBC \u2013 I don\u2019t know.\\nGF \u2013 Don Barnes was there. And of course\u2026\\nBC \u2013 Is he happy with you?\\nGF \u2013 Well sure. (Laughter.) I\u2019m good. I\u2019m good at what I do, Bill.\\nBC \u2013 I know.\\nGF \u2013 But Don was, you know. He\u2026 He pretty much\u2026 When this guy was trying to beat up on me a little, said, \u201chey, I don\u2019t see the relevance of this\u201d and dadada. And then the head of the grievance committee said \u201cI don\u2019t either and I think we need to go on and you know go, not go along with this line of questioning.\u201d And then that was about it except for just some other minor questions. But I found that curious that he would ask me how I found out about the job.\\nBC \u2013 Yeah.\\nGF \u2013 Now maybe at this point I\u2019m paranoid but I mean no one has mentioned anything about it to me at all but I just found that, that I found interesting.\\nBC \u2013 Yeah.\\nIn another conversation, Clinton tells Flowers that he will \u201cnose around\u201d to see if he can find out more about the issue, and he asked her whether the person who filed the grievance was being represented by a lawyer.\\nBC \u2013 Alright. I\u2019m gonna nose around, if I find out anything I\u2019ll call you. And meanwhile, uh, I can understand this grievance thing. I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll run that down.\\nGF \u2013 Well I don\u2019t think there\u2019ll be any problem there from what I understand, you know, that her deal was to either have my job or for them to create a position equal to mine.\\nBC \u2013 Uh huh.\\nGF \u2013 But it\u2019s my understanding that then it\u2019ll go to\u2026 even if they say yes, created position for her.\\nBC \u2013 Uh huh.\\nGF \u2013 That\u2019s the same as Gennifer\u2019s. Don Barnes can always say, \u201cNo, I won\u2019t\u201d and period. That\u2019s it.\\nBC \u2013 That\u2019s right. I mean that\u2019s my understanding. So\u2026\\nBC- Yeah. And then she could sue, but I doubt if she will. Was she there with a lawyer or a representative of any kind?\\nGF \u2013 She had a guy that works for the tribunal represent her which I thought was very inappropriate.\\nBC \u2013 Uh huh. Well, I guess maybe they do that for people\u2026\\nContacted yesterday by Breitbart News, Flowers explained why she says she turned to Clinton for help securing the state job.\\nShe stated:\\nI found out my Mom had cancer and decided I wanted a regular job so I would have my weekends to spend with her. I was performing six nights a week and wouldn\u2019t of had time. I asked to get me the job and he did.\\nIn her deposition for the Paula Jones case, Flowers detailed Clinton\u2019s alleged involvement in helping her secure the state job.\\nHere is her affidavit on that matter:\\nIn early 1990 I told Bill Clinton that I wanted a job with the state. Bill Clinton told me to contact his assistant Judy Gaddy who would assist me with the application for employment. I met with Judy Gaddy in her office and she provided me with the details of what needed to be on the application. Judy Gaddy also told me to contact Clara Clark who set up a job interview for me. I was eventually employed by the state as an administrative assistant for the Arkansas Appeal Tribunal.\\nShortly after I was employed by the state, another woman who had applied for my job filed a grievance or some sort of complaint in which she alleged that she was more qualified and implied that the only reason I got the job was because I had had an affair with Bill Clinton. I was called to testify before a panel in connection with this proceeding. When I learned that I would have to testify, I did not know what to do, so I called Bill Clinton. I told him that I had been called to testify and asked what I should say. He told me to deny that we had ever had an affair. During the proceeding, when questions came up about my relationship to Bill, Don Barnes, his appointee and head of the commission, stopped the questioning.\\nIn 1992, Michael Isikoff reported at the Washington Post that Clinton\u2019s office admitted that it helped Flowers obtain the job in June 1991, while denying allegations that Flowers was Clinton\u2019s mistress. Clinton\u2019s office maintained that Clinton only helped Flowers because the politician felt bad that she was being hounded by the media over the sex allegations.\\nIsikoff reported:\\nGov. Bill Clinton\u2019s office said today that Clinton assigned a member of his staff to help Gennifer Flowers find a state job in September 1990 after she asked for his assistance.\\nMichael Gauldin, Clinton\u2019s press secretary, also released two handwritten notes he said Flowers had written to Clinton. The first, in 1986, said she would appreciate his help in finding a job. The second, dated Feb. 23, 1991, complained that the assistant assigned to help her was not being very \u201csuccessful.\u201d \u2026\\nGauldin said Clinton was interested in helping her in part because he \u201cfelt responsible for all the women\u201d who were being hounded by reporters after they were named in an unsuccessful 1990 lawsuit in which a state employee alleged the governor had used state funds in furtherance of extramarital affairs.\\nIn the 1986 letter, Flowers enclosed a resume, said she \u201ccertainly enjoyed speaking with you by phone,\u201d and said \u201canything you can do\u201d to help with employment would be \u201cappreciated.\u201d\\nIn the 1991 \u201cDear Bill\u201d letter, Flowers complained that the staff aide Clinton assigned to the matter, special assistant Judy S. Caddy, \u201chas not been very successful in the job hunting area.\u201d\\n\u201cBill, I\u2019ve tried to explain my financial situation to you and how badly I need a job,\u201d Flowers wrote. She said she was enclosing \u201csome correspondence that will be of interest to you\u201d \u2013 a letter written by a lawyer she had hired threatening to sue a local radio station for repeating the 1990 allegations. The letter, which had previously been released by Clinton, said the allegations were untrue.\\n\u201cUnfortunately, it looks like I will have to pursue the law suit to hopefully, get some money to live on until I can get employment,\u201d Flowers ended the note. \u201cPlease be in touch.\u201d\\nIn 1998, the Washington Post again reported on the matter:\\nFlowers said her affair with Clinton had been over for at least a year but that about the time of the Nichols suit, she was looking for a job and turned to the governor.\\nClinton agreed to help find her a position at an Arkansas state agency, Flowers said, and enlisted a political appointee named Don Barnes. Efforts to contact Barnes last night were unsuccessful.\\n\u201cI don\u2019t know Vernon Jordan, and I don\u2019t know whether he is or is not telling the truth,\u201d Flowers said. \u201cBut it reminds me of [1990] in regard to a position that Vernon Jordan supposedly arranged for Monica Lewinsky.\u201d\\nFlowers was hired by the Arkansas Appeal Tribunal, a state agency, after an interview Barnes arranged and sat in on, according to Flowers\u2019 1995 written account of her relationship with Clinton.\\nhttp://www.scoopnest.com/user/TPoliticmanager/791321070535966720\\nTrump threatened Hillary with bringing on Gennifer Flowers last month to the debate.\\nMike Pence Gennifer Flowers Wont Be at Debate Trump Was Just Mocking Clinton Camp\\nAll Stories By King of Shambhala Click Here!\""}, "time": 1742563920.8971682}
