Next to take the stage was Kevin Mandia, the founder of Mandiant, a security company acquired by another security company called FireEye, who said nothing could be done to stop hackers from conducting digital attacks. The juxtaposition did not sit well with Oren Falkowitz, a former analyst at the National Security Agency. \u201cI thought, \u2018Really? We can solve global warming but we can\u2019t stop cyberattacks? \u2019\u201d Mr. Falkowitz recalled. He didn\u2019t buy it. For the last two years, Mr. Falkowitz\u2019s   Area 1 Security, has been trying to persuade the owners and operators of computer servers that have been compromised by state spies, criminals and hacktivists to allow the company to tap into those servers to monitor the attackers\u2019 activities. Those servers have given the Area 1 team a much clearer picture of who is being targeted and what tools and websites attackers are using. And the security company has started to block attackers, heading them off days or even months before they hit their targets. It\u2019s a new tack in an industry that in recent years has appeared less confident that it can block digital attacks. Most security   seeking funding today have resigned themselves to the inevitability of a breach and are focused more on identifying an attack as it plays out and praying that they can respond before the perpetrator makes off with something important. It\u2019s as if everyone in the cybersecurity industry forgot that customers pay them to keep from being hacked in the first place. Mr. Falkowitz and his   Blake Darch\u00e9 and Phil Syme, think they have found a new way to turn attackers\u2019 tools against them. For as long as there have been cyberattacks, hackers have relied on a vast network of compromised servers around the globe to funnel their malicious code, search out targets and steal data. By watching what happens on those compromised servers at dentists\u2019 offices, farms, welding shops and tech companies, Area 1 believes it has secured a unique vantage point for monitoring and even blocking attacks. Area 1\u2019s technology addresses one of the most pernicious digital threats:     attacks, which bait unsuspecting workers into clicking on links in emails and unknowingly giving attackers a toehold in their employers\u2019 systems. Phishing attacks have become an epidemic. To date, more than 90 percent of breaches have begun with a phishing attack, according to Verizon. Intelligence experts say that phishing attacks are the preferred method of Chinese hackers who have managed to steal things as varied as nuclear propulsion technology and Silicon Valley\u2019s most guarded software code. \u201cOren does not take it as writ law that we have to live that way, and he wanted to do something about it,\u201d said Ted Schlein, a venture capitalist at Kleiner Perkins Caufield  Byers, which has invested in Area 1. \u201cIf we could look every company in the eye and say, \u2018We can stop your phishing attacks,\u2019\u201d Mr. Schlein said, \u201cthen Oren could look Kevin Mandia in the eye and say, \u2018Thanks for the inspiration, but you\u2019re wrong. \u2019\u201d One of the biggest challenges in combating phishing attacks has been a lack of   among victims, security firms and law enforcement. Victims are reluctant to publicize security breaches, potentially keeping competitors from heading off similar attacks. And the role of the government in sharing threat data has been constrained since the former intelligence contractor Edward J. Snowden leaked documents revealing the scale of government monitoring. The Obama administration has been pushing to collect and share more threat data with the private sector. But few companies want to share any more data with the government than they are compelled to by law. Intelligence agencies say the lack of   works to attackers\u2019 advantage. \u201cWe are in a very complex digital world that\u2019s only going to get more complex as innovation presents challenges we haven\u2019t even anticipated,\u201d said Daniel Ennis, former director of the Threat Operations Center at the N. S. A. \u201cPeople have incredible expectations of the government to keep them safe\u201d online. \u201cMy concern is that the bad guys are going to   us,\u201d he added. \u201cThe only way we\u2019re going to   them is a partnership between the government, the private sector, the victims and academia. \u201d Until that happens, Area 1 may have found a way to circumnavigate the politics by recruiting the owners of those compromised servers around the globe. \u201cCyber is perceived as this \u2018Matrix\u2019  structure, but people forget that it\u2019s also physical in nature,\u201d Mr. Falkowitz said. \u201cThe players are not just the attackers and the victim there\u2019s an entire underbelly of the web that has been subverted. \u201d Area 1 discovers, on average, 859 new targeting phishing sites a day. Now it can use its unusual vantage point to help its customers stave off attacks. It is still early days, but Area 1 aims to eventually end phishing attacks altogether, Mr. Falkowitz said. \u201cWe just went to Mars and found water, and people are saying we can\u2019t solve this?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742564251.1278524}
