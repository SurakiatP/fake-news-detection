But how do you find meaning, identity and purpose in the remaining years of your life? John and Kathryn Gee, both 57, recently engaged in this existential query. They have worked hard at     jobs, invested diligently and are planning to retire soon. Having relocated to San Antonio from Phoenix in 2010, they have already reached a sweet spot where they have a bountiful nest egg. Yet they worry that something is missing. \u201cWe thought we\u2019d be retired and would be fat, dumb and happy at 55,\u201d Mr. Gee said. \u201cWe only talked about money. Then we started asking some simple questions. \u201d Embracing the guiding principles of life planning laid out by a financial planner, George Kinder, the Gees asked themselves what they would do if money wasn\u2019t an issue and they only had one day to a few years left to live. The answers, which they are still contemplating, gave them a renewed focus on what was most important to them. \u201cWhat is it that can make me a better person?\u201d Ms. Gee asked herself after a   of their core values. \u201cHow can we give back? Family became more important. \u201d Mr. Kinder, who has been espousing and refining   programs with his clients and in seminars for several decades, calls for a process that involves self, family and community. \u201cWho do I want to be?\u201d is a question that Mr. Kinder says his clients should ask. \u201cWhat have I missed? Who did I not get to be? What an incredible opportunity to have all of these things in front of you. \u201d As with financial preparation, life planning evolves in stages. Mr. Kinder says he walks clients through exploration of positive outcomes and goal setting \u201cwithin a human setting of comfort and support. \u201d If the process unfolds in a positive way, Mr. Kinder says, the ideal state is one of the Hawaiian word \u201caloha. \u201d The term does not simply mean hello or goodbye, he says, but in the truest sense stands for \u201cthe process of passing a blessing from one person to another. \u201d Mitch Anthony, author of \u201cThe New Retirementality\u201d (Wiley, 2008) says your   should start with the question, \u201cWhat am I wired for?\u201d which involves taking an \u201cinventory of who you are. \u201d Mr. Anthony\u2019s principles are geared around one\u2019s aptitudes and having active pursuits that involve the mind, body and spirit. Translating that into concrete actions can be challenging. Retired professionals may be able to continue to do what they were doing, but now as   or consultants. Others may be able to apply their analytic, management or organizational skills in     settings. Still others may want to strike out in entirely new directions. \u201cIt\u2019s never an easy answer,\u201d Mr. Anthony says of   in retirement. \u201cYou need to take stock of things that resound with you  \u2014   that stir you up. \u201d Through Mr. Anthony\u2019s process of discovering engagement, it is possible to isolate the activities that you are already doing  \u2014   or could be doing  \u2014   that make you feel most alive, creative, happy and connected to others. Finding a balance between the myriad components of our lives certainly takes some adjustment. Mary Zimmerman, a financial and life planner in the Phoenix area who has worked with the Gees, said one of the most important goals she discussed with them was to \u201cfind your humanity and sanity. \u201d \u201cThere\u2019s often so much anxiety in retirement,\u201d Ms. Zimmerman says. \u201cHow do we allow ourselves to be at ease? How can we be comfortable?\u201d These questions lead into an exploration of what makes us tick and how we can find our best selves. By no means is this a seamless transition for most. The rough patches may come early and often. It\u2019s hard to break the routine and inertia of a career. You may have to become a \u201clite\u201d version of your   self to bridge the gap. Like many, Ms. Gee says that her   and identification were intimately linked to her work, a common problem with retirees seeking a new role. Some professionals find it unnervingly difficult not to be a banker, doctor, lawyer or engineer anymore. \u201cThe myth of retirement is that you have to leave that all behind,\u201d Mr. Anthony said. You don\u2019t. Once you shatter the conventions of a   retirement, Mr. Anthony says, it\u2019s like \u201cbreaking through the gravity barrier. You\u2019re on the path to contentment. \u201d Admittedly, seeking what Viktor Frankl, a Holocaust survivor who was a renowned neurologist and psychiatrist, called the \u201cwill to meaning\u201d is one of the most challenging parts not just of retirement planning but of living your life to the fullest. You don\u2019t have to do it alone, though. You can find a coach, mentor or life planner. Consider a certified life coach, who, like a planner, works    to help you walk through a life plan Mr. Kinder\u2019s organization, Kinder Institute, also has a search engine to find life planners throughout the world. Rates for this service vary from as little as $200 to as much as $10, 000 a month for   executive coaches. Some retirees may have a clear idea of how they want to define their lives while others may take months to discern a path. Certified financial planners may also provide this assistance in the course of comprehensive hourly or   financial planning. The universe of financial planners who have had specific life planning or life coaching training, though, is small. To date, about 2, 000 planners have taken the Kinder Institute\u2019s training and 350 have qualified for the registered life planner designation. That\u2019s out of an industry of more than 74, 000 professionals holding the certified financial planning certificate. Even if you find the process emotionally nettlesome  \u2014   most do  \u2014   you can figure out life goals on your own and create your route for finding purpose and meaning. One way to start is by asking if there\u2019s a need for your service within your family or community. You may spend time with relatives who need you in a caregiving or educational role. Another approach is to   some community activities that you feel most comfortable with and that provide social engagement as well. Others seek out social, environmental or political causes or a nonprofit activity that revolves around doing good, not just doing well. Sometimes the quest for inner meaning may be right in front of you. For Mr. Gee, it was family that called to him. He wanted to help a niece and spend time with his mother, who is 86, infirm and living alone in his native England. She could not relocate to the United States. Let\u2019s be honest: Those pursuing the   process tend to be financially secure already. You can\u2019t be nimble with life decisions if you are constantly worried that market volatility will blister your investments. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to thoroughly vet your portfolio, estate plan and cash needs. A certain level of comfort is almost a keystone for most people before embarking on an existential exploration. Once you cross that barrier, though, almost anything is possible. \u201cIt\u2019s not about being busy,\u201d Mr. Anthony said. \u201cIt\u2019s about being engaged. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563364.2296941}
