What\u2019s the nature of existence? Where are we headed? \\nBashar answers these questions via channeling and, accompanied by state-of- the-art graphics, explains how the universe works and how each person creates the reality they experience. \\nOver the past three decades, thousands of individuals around the globe have listened to Bashar\u2019s messages and have had the opportunity to apply these principles in their lives and create the reality that they desire. \\nFIRST CONTACT proposes that we are not alone and that Truth is Stranger Than Fiction.
