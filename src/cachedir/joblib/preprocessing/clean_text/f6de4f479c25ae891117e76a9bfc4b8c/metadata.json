[Rory started Friday one over par and far back of the leader, Charley Hoffman, who sat at 10 under. Consequently, it was an earlier than usual tee time. He played with Jim Herman, a    journeyman who had his first tour win at the Shell Houston Open last year. Rory walked up onto the first tee and shook hands with all the volunteers and scoring officials. He immediately started chatting up Herman. He\u2019s a natural conversationalist. If you\u2019re a golfer or a first baseman, it\u2019s important to always have something to talk about because there\u2019s a lot of waiting around. After the players tee off there\u2019s a mass exodus from the stands as most people are there to follow Rory\u2019s group.  First   Rory makes a pedestrian par. I ran into his dad Gerry McIlroy on the first green. I met him a few times over the years at tournaments and he\u2019s one of the most affable guys around. He was so welcoming, in fact, that I had visions of him really taking a liking to me and asking if I would become Rory\u2019s business manager. That never happened sadly, but he still sort of remembers me. Maybe there\u2019 still a chance I could take over Rory\u2019s finances. Second Hole \u2014  Rory misses the green on a tough par three and thins a chip shot 20 feet past the hole.  The ball was on a severe downhill but he still elected to chip it. I asked my buddy Gerry if he agreed with that call, and he said, \u201cYes, without a doubt. \u201d That\u2019s good enough for me.  All\u2019s well that ends well as he drains the putt for par. Third Hole \u2014  Another   par for Rory. On his tee shot some idiot in the crowd yelled, \u201cBababooey. \u201d I made an effort to track him down and box their ears to no avail. I\u2019m doing my part as a golf vigilante, though. Fourth Hole \u2014  Rory is under par for the round with a great up and down for birdie. His second shot into the   hole went left into the crowd but he hit a classy chip to six feet and made the putt. Fifth Hole \u2014  Rory hits an iron off the tee to get into position for the short par four. Nobody clapped after the shot even though it appeared perfect. If one person had started clapping then everyone else would have. It\u2019s like singing in church. This phenomenon should have a name if it doesn\u2019t already. He just misses a downhill   and makes par. Sixth Hole \u2014  This is a beautiful par five that bends around a lake. An osprey diving into the water for fish entertains the crowd. The bird actually caught a fish and flew to a nearby tree to consume his catch. It\u2019s the Nature Channel and the Golf Channel. We are definitely getting our money\u2019s worth. Rory hits a huge drive and a monster long iron over the flag. He two putts for par and is now two under and looking sharp.  Seventh Hole \u2014  Rory hits a towering iron shot on the long par three. There is an audible gasp from the crowd as the ball reaches its apex. It\u2019s really a sight to behold and McIlroy is the only player in the world that can hit these shots. It goes 15 feet past the hole but he misses the birdie putt and makes par. Eighth Hole \u2014  Rory gets another birdie chance on the tough par four. I approach Gerry, and say, \u201cHow about he makes this and shoots a 65?\u201d Gerry says, \u201cSounds good to me. \u201d So, he\u2019s onboard. He misses the birdie. Ninth Hole \u2014  Another birdie putt goes begging on the tough   ninth. Rory is two under for the round but could easily be four or five under with the way he\u2019s striking the ball. As the crowd walks to the tenth hole, U. S. Open and Olympic gold medalist Justin Rose tries to walk the other way to the range. Pretty funny to see Rose fight the crowd while carrying a bucket of range balls. One guy nonchalantly says, \u201cHey Justin\u201d and Rose, to his credit, was nice enough to smile and \u201cHey\u201d back. Tenth Hole \u2014  Rory opens the back nine with a birdie to get to three under. As he walks to the next tee an inebriated college kid yells, \u201cRory you have to shake my friend\u2019s hand, he has the same name as you. \u201d I ask him if his friend\u2019s name is Rory McIlroy, but, unsurprisingly, it\u2019s just the first name. Rory passes up the chance to shake his friend\u2019s hand but fist bumps with drunk college guy because his extended fist is blocking his way. Drunken college guy is a treat. He\u2019s in a good spot now still fun and coherent. It\u2019s only noon, so I shudder to think what 5 p. m. will bring. He did tell me about how Rory\u2019s playing partner Jim Herman received sponsorship from Trump early in his playing career. Trump played a lot of golf with Herman, who served as an assistant pro at Trump\u2019s course in Bedminster, New Jersey. He saw how good Herman was and implored him to follow his dream on the PGA Tour. Trump\u2019s instincts are correct once again.  As Herman walks by drunk college guy yells out, \u201cHerman!\u201d and then \u201cTrump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump!\u201d Good times. Eleventh Hole \u2014  Another birdie to get to four under for the round! We may have something brewing here. A guy had an awesome Fathead of Rory and I wanted to take a picture for the article. But every picture I took he was grabbing his girlfriend\u2019s butt. Unacceptable. What kind of a website does he think we\u2019re running around here? Twelfth Hole \u2014  On the reachable par five, Rory\u2019s drive just trickles into the sand. Gerry says no way he can reach in two. He hits out to 85 yards. After an indifferent approach shot, he drains an   for his third birdie in a row. There\u2019s now a buzz in the air. Thirteenth Hole \u2014  After a good drive and an excellent approach shot, Rory has   for birdie. He just misses and that is deflating. It looked like four birdies in a row. I see his lovely mom Rosie and try and worm my way into the McIlroy\u2019s good graces even more. I approach her and ask if she\u2019s Gerry\u2019s better half? She doesn\u2019t hear me and I then mumble hello. Not a good start. I ask if she is staying with Rory at his house in Jupiter, Florida. She looks at me dumbfounded as if to say, no, my son is worth over 100 million dollars, I think he can afford to buy us a house in Florida. It\u2019s looking unlikely I\u2019ll ever get control of the McIlroy fortune. She was very nice though and was happy to hear about Jim Herman\u2019s Shell Open win late in his career. Fourteenth Hole \u2014  Tough par three and he hits a decent shot 20 feet below the pin. Putt just misses and what could have been a phenomenal round may just be a good round. I\u2019m seeing a lot of pretty girls on the course. This is expected at PGA events. They get dolled up as well. A number of these woman are wearing   wedge shoes. They can barely stand, let alone walk around the course. Very impractical ladies. We appreciate the effort but would rather you just wore running shoes so we wouldn\u2019t have to worry about you turning an ankle. Fifteenth   Rory makes par on the difficult par 4. As he waits on the green for Herman to putt, he\u2019s looking down and fiddling with his ball. A young kid in my area jokingly asks those around him, \u201cis he texting?\u201d There\u2019s hope for this next generation. Sixteenth Hole \u2014  This is an easy par five but Rory\u2019s tee shot goes well right into the high rough and on a downhill slope. It\u2019s a really difficult shot as he also faces a creek in front of the green. People in crowd think he will lay up but he chooses to go for the green. He somehow digs it out and gets it pin high but just off the green. His chip is decent but he can\u2019t make the birdie putt. Facing two very tough finishing holes it looks like he will be lucky to hold on and shoot five under. Seventeenth Hole \u2014  On the treacherous   par three over water, Rory hits an excellent tee shot to 14 feet. He then drains the putt. The gallery is now twice as big as when he started. Eighteenth Hole \u2014  This is the second most difficult hole on the course. Rory hits a huge drive then stuffs an approach shot to 14 feet. My prediction to Gerry of a 65 is definitely in play. Speaking of Gerry, I haven\u2019t seen him in four holes. There\u2019s a chance the whole McIlroy clan is avoiding me. Rory, with a flair for the dramatic, drains the putt to shoot 65! He vaults himself back into contention for the championship. What a great day at Bay Hill. Check back here for Dan Redmond\u2019s recap of the final round tomorrow.'"}, "time": 1742564291.0675657}
