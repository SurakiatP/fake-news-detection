Painter wrote in a New York Times an op-ed: The F.B.I.\u2019s job is to investigate, not to influence the outcome of an election. \\nSuch acts could also be prohibited under the Hatch Act, which bars the use of an official position to influence an election. That is why the F.B.I. presumably would keep those aspects of an investigation confidential until after the election. The usual penalty for a violation is termination of federal employment. \\nAnd that is why, on Saturday, I filed a complaint against the F.B.I. with the Office of Special Counsel, which investigates Hatch Act violations, and with the Office of Government Ethics. I have spent much of my career working on government ethics and lawyers\u2019 ethics, including two and a half years as the chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, and I never thought that the F.B.I. could be dragged into a political circus surrounding one of its investigations. Until this week. \\nThis is the second complaint to be filed against FBI Director Comey. The Democratic Coalition Against Trump has also filed a complaint against Comey for interfering in a presidential election as a federal employee. \\nSuspicion around Comey\u2019s actions has grown as the FBI Director is not expected to make any additional statements on this matter before the presidential election. Director Comey appears to have set himself for problems after the election as Senate Democrats are making it known that they are open to holding hearings to investigate the FBI investigation if they win back the Senate majority. \\nUnless Trump wins and Republicans take control of Congress, Director Comey is going to have to answer for his decisions. \\nAs the complaints pile up, it looks like Congressional testimony may be the least of James Comey\u2019s future problems.'"}, "time": 1742562242.8210518}
