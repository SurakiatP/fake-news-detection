Mr. Trump has been using  his old, unsecured Android phone to post on Twitter since moving to Washington late last week. The president\u2019s desire to use his old, personal smartphone raises concerns that its use could be exposing him and the nation to security threats. He is using the Android smartphone mainly to post on Twitter, not to make calls. But it\u2019s unclear what security measures have been put in place on the device and how vulnerable he could be to someone stealing data or breaking into his Twitter account. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Twitter requires a connection to the internet, which exposes the device to security vulnerabilities if proper measures like   authentication  \u2014   a password and a code texted to a phone, for example  \u2014   are not in place. If he uses the smartphone on an unsecure   network, he could be exposing his location and other personal information on the device. \u201cThe absolutely minimum Trump could do to protect our nation is to use a secure device to protect him from foreign spies and other threats,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon on the Intelligence Committee. \u201cIt would be irresponsible in the extreme for the commander in chief to use an unsecure device that could be easily hacked or intercepted. \u201d Among the concerns by security experts: \u25a0 It is unclear if the device and its functions like texting are encrypted to thwart hacking. \u25a0 The device could be more vulnerable to hacking if used on unsecured   and cellular networks, such as when Mr. Trump travels between meetings or anywhere outside the White House. \u25a0 Hackers could access the device to turn on the camera and microphone. \u25a0 Stingray devices, a type of surveillance tool often used by law enforcement, can track a device\u2019s location and other information. \u201cThere are a lot of questions, but it is clear there are often vulnerabilities in our phones and internet systems  \u2014   and it is critical that people take precautions to ensure their sensitive information is protected from hackers and other malicious actors,\u201d said Neema Singh Guliani, legislative counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union. The president\u2019s use of the personal device is particularly notable given his criticism of Hillary Clinton for using a personal email address and server when she was secretary of state. In 2009, President Barack Obama fought to become the first president with a smartphone though he won, the use of a White   secure device came with many rules. \u201cAs president, he is the biggest sitting target in the world,\u201d said Kevin Bankston, the director of New America\u2019s Open Technology Institute.'"}, "time": 1742564542.1563451}
