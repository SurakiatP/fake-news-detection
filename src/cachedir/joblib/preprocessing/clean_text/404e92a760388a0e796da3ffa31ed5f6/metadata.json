You\u2019re going to learn how to find a fulfilling career. You\u2019re going to learn how to better navigate life\u2019s   decisions and kill your \u201cwicked problems\u201d dead. How? By training yourself to think like a designer. That, anyway, is the premise of \u201cDesigning Your Life,\u201d a class taught at Stanford University (the school\u2019s \u201cmost popular class,\u201d according to Fast Company magazine) as well as the   book that grew out of it, \u201cDesigning Your Life: How to Build a   Joyful Life\u201d (Knopf). The two men who created the class and wrote the book are Silicon Valley veterans, Bill Burnett and Dave Evans. They believe they have hit upon a system to help you deal with almost any challenge. \u201cHow do you find the one to love  \u2014   we don\u2019t do that,\u201d Mr. Burnett said. \u201cWe also don\u2019t give advice on weight loss. \u201d But everything else? The two professors claim that you can design an amazing life in the same way that Jonathan Ive designed the iPhone. They say the practices taught in the class and the book can help you (in    ) \u201creframe\u201d dysfunctional beliefs that surround life and career decisions and help you \u201cwayfind\u201d in a chaotic world through the adoption of such design tenets as    prototyping and  . After nine years of teaching their secrets to future Google product managers and   wunderkinds, Mr. Burnett and Mr. Evans are opening up the curriculum to everyone. \u201cWhat do I want to be when I grow up?\u201d and \u201cAm I living a meaningful life?\u201d aren\u2019t only subjects for     dorm hangouts, the men said. \u201cThe question of \u2018What do I do with the rest of my one wild and wonderful life?\u2019 is on everyone\u2019s mind,\u201d Mr. Evans said. Mr. Burnett recalled a conversation with Stanford\u2019s dean of the engineering department, who was about to retire. \u201cHe said: \u2018Can I take your class? Because I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to be now that I\u2019m not the dean anymore. \u2019\u201d Mr. Burnett added: \u201cOne of the   out there is that you should figure it out by 25, or maybe it\u2019s 27 now. Then there\u2019s the other thing of failure to launch, that millennials are slackers. Part of the permission we give people is: Reframe this. You\u2019re not supposed to have it figured out. \u201d Mr. Burnett and Mr. Evans looked on as the roughly 50 Stanford students in their charge took out and read from their flow journals. Then they broke the class into discussion groups of six or seven. It was early May, and the students were in the final weeks of \u201cDesigning Your Life. \u201d Standing in the front of the room, Mr. Burnett and Mr. Evans began to make their way through a PowerPoint presentation. \u201cWhen did you seem the most animated, the most present?\u201d Mr. Burnett said, by way of guiding the discussion groups. Silviana Ilcus, an art history major who had completed more than 230 units at Stanford without having arrived at a firm idea of what she wanted to with her life, addressed the other members of her group. \u201cI don\u2019t have flow when I\u2019m doing art history,\u201d Ms. Ilcus said. \u201cI hate writing. \u201d The others listened patiently. \u201cMy flow was doing math,\u201d she said, seeming to have a   moment in real time. \u201cI\u2019m wondering why it didn\u2019t guide my choice of major. \u201d Sitting at an outdoor campus food court after class, Mr. Burnett and Mr. Evans nodded in recognition after hearing of the exchange. \u201cThe course surfaces stuff that people haven\u2019t worked through yet, almost universally,\u201d Mr. Evans said. Mr. Burnett said, \u201cIt\u2019s a place to have this conversation, because nobody is asking them these questions, and they\u2019re not asking themselves. \u201d College students are promising empty vessels, as yet unburdened by the   and compromises that keep the rest of us up at night  \u2014   say, hating your corporate job but loving the house it pays for, or wanting to fulfill your dream of backpacking across Europe with two young children in school. To make \u201cDesigning Your Life\u201d workable for people in midcareer, the professors had to do their own reframe of the curriculum. The book includes things that are not in the class, like what Mr. Burnett and Mr. Evans call \u201canchor problems\u201d  \u2014   overcommitted life choices that keep people stuck and unhappy. A common mistake that people make, they said, is to assume that there\u2019s only one right solution or optimal version of your life, and that if you choose wrong, you\u2019ve blown it. That\u2019s completely absurd, Mr. Evans said: \u201cThere are lots of you. There are lots of right answers. \u201d As   messengers, the two men are an odd couple. Mr. Burnett, 59, is a   acerbic, existential atheist with an earring, while Mr. Evans, 63, is an outgoing, verbose, practicing Christian with the gray beard of a philosopher. Both are Stanford grads, and while they have accomplished r\u00e9sum\u00e9s (Mr. Burnett helped to design the original \u201cStar Wars\u201d toys and worked at Apple before becoming executive director of Stanford\u2019s design program Mr. Evans also worked at Apple and   Electronic Arts, the game company) each said his younger self would have been well served by the course. For his part, Mr. Evans struggled as a biology student, a major he chose because he had watched a Jacques Cousteau television special as a boy, and one he clung to because, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think I had conscious permission to not know what I was doing. \u201d He switched to mechanical engineering and graduated with a master\u2019s degree in the  \u201970s. But when an Apple recruiter called, he initially hung up, because he was bored by computers. In doing so, Mr. Evans said ruefully, he violated several principles of \u201cDesigning Your Life,\u201d among them staying open to \u201clatent wonderfulness. \u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re wrong, you go: \u2018Oh, computers are boring. O. K. I\u2019m going home now,\u2019\u201d Mr. Evans explained. \u201c \u2018Yes\u2019 is easy. \u2018No\u2019 is hard to come back from. \u201d Mr. Burnett had an easier time on the surface, finding his way to the design program at Stanford and a lifelong vocation. Through a professor mentor, he landed a job as a toy designer and went on to greater success. But, he said: \u201cMy method was a blind walk. I didn\u2019t have any strategies. I trusted my intuition, but I worried that I didn\u2019t know what I was doing. \u201d Before joining forces, they hashed out the concepts they had been developing over a   lunch at a Portola Valley beer garden then known as Zott\u2019s (short for Rissotti\u2019s it is now called the Alpine Inn) using their life experiences as grist for the curriculum. In a place like Stanford, where yearly tuition is about $50, 000, they thought it was worthwhile to send students into the world with practical knowledge about how to find a fulfilling job and excel at it. They began holding workshops for adults a few years ago, including for the employees of Google. The workshop and the book are an effort to take their approach beyond its cloistered campus setting. As Mr. Evans put it, \u201cWe\u2019re trying to give this thing away. \u201d If you can get past the   language and Silicon Valley preciousness, many of the principles of \u201cDesigning Your Life\u201d are, in fact, helpful. Design thinking, as rendered in the book, is about treating life in a more improvisational way. It\u2019s a welcome counterbalance to the   engineering   gripping the culture. Follow Mr. Burnett\u2019s and Mr. Evans\u2019s teachings, and the   process of decision making suddenly seems more playful. Their method is experiential and accepts that failure is part of the process. Central to the philosophy is prototyping, a concept borrowed from how product designers work. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re thinking of changing careers. Interview someone who does the job you\u2019re considering. Better yet, ask to shadow them for a day, or work in the field on weekends. If it feels right, take it a step further if it doesn\u2019t, move on. \u201cIt\u2019s a classic form of design,\u201d Mr. Burnett said. \u201cYou build a lot of stuff, you try a lot of stuff. But it\u2019s always less than the whole product. \u201d Prototyping big decisions like a career change or a move, meanwhile, guards against blowing up your life to rush headlong into the alluring unknown, or worse, taking no action for years, unhappily. Emma Wood, a    Stanford graduate and a consultant at McKinsey  Company who took \u201cDesigning Your Life\u201d as an undergraduate, said the class released the pressure she felt about the life she would face after graduation. \u201cYour whole future and happiness aren\u2019t tied to this one plan working out,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can make mistakes. Failure is good. \u201d The capstone of the Stanford class, and a key part of the book, is an assignment to come up with three \u201cOdyssey Plans\u201d that map out the next five years of your life in radically different ways. The activity is designed to reinforce the sense of multiple viable options, unlock the imagination and eliminate the attractive power of the unknown alternative. Lingtong Sun, who graduated from Stanford last year, said he continues to use the \u201cOdyssey Plan\u201d and other concepts from the class to decide his   career. \u201cOn the grand level, I haven\u2019t figured out what I want to do yet,\u201d said Mr. Sun, who works as a software engineer for a tech   in the Bay Area. \u201cBut I\u2019m more open to trying something and seeing how it goes. It\u2019s that bias toward action. You can\u2019t think your way into your future. \u201d Breaking down the system to its basic parts, as a designer would, Mr. Evans said, \u201cThere are only two things we offer in the class: ideas and tools. \u201d He added, \u201cIf you think with these ideas rather than the ones you had before, and you use these tools, we believe your chance of building and getting what you want will go up. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628605.0123286}
