Foxes sometimes reuse old den sites or steal dens from smaller animals like squirrels. The best dens are the ones that are elevated on ridges, mounds, or riverbanks. \\n\\nArctic foxes can have litters that contain as many as 16 cubs. They deposit high amounts of nutrients in and around their dens through urination, defecation, and left over kills. Because of this fertilization, vibrant diamondleaf willows and yellow wildflowers pop up from their dens, coloring the otherwise gray landscape. \\n\\nThese dens exist throughout the Arctic and they turn the otherwise gray landscape into something that is spectacularly beautiful. These dens also boost the environment by creating more plant diversity. This greatly helps herbivores find food during the short summers, which in turn helps carnivores. The ongoing cycle provides more food, and better health to animals living in an otherwise desolate region. \\n\\nMany species such as caribou and other herbivores visit these dens creating a great environment for healthy growth within the ecosystem. \\n\\nThe cute foxes have been dubbed the \u201cecosystem engineers\u201d. \\n\\n '"}, "time": 1742561806.3810701}
