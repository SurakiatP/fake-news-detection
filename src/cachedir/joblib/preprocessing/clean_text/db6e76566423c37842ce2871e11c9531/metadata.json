But Desert Trip is not your average festival. On Friday night, an   team of classic rock veterans  \u2014   the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney, Neil Young, the Who and Roger Waters of Pink Floyd  \u2014   will begin its first of two weekends on the same storied bill at the Empire Polo Club in Indio, Calif. Among the crowd will be Julie Varon, a mother of three from Seattle, who grew up on the rock \u2019n\u2019 roll that once soundtracked and spurred the counterculture. Also taking part, though not entirely of his own volition: Ms. Varon\u2019s    son, Sam, who prefers modern country music and Coachella, the annual pop festival that shares an organizer and location with Desert Trip. \u201cThis is definitely a little bit of a twist,\u201d Sam said a few days before the event. His mother chimed in: \u201cA twist of the arm. \u201d She added: \u201cIt didn\u2019t help that people started calling it Oldchella. But he gets it. \u201d Like many of the 150, 000 people expected at the festival, Ms. Varon, 59, saw Desert Trip as a historic event, a   last chance to commune with these titans of   rock. As a baby boomer, she also happens to be in the target demographic. By pairing such venerated acts with amenities of relative luxury (seating options, extra bathrooms, gourmet food) the promoters of Desert Trip have created a destination for an underserved festival audience with the time, means and inclination to go all out for what is seen as a singular occasion. Matthew Thirlwall, 60, a geology professor living outside London, spent $898 plus fees for a V. I. P. ticket that comes with the \u201cculinary experience bundle,\u201d on top of airfare and a camping pass. (  tickets topped out at $1, 599.) \u201cI decided a year or two ago that life had much more to offer than working   days, and decided to take part in early partial retirement,\u201d Mr. Thirlwall said. Emboldened by a trip to Burning Man this year, he had decided to make Desert Trip his first rock festival. \u201cOne of my daughter\u2019s friends at university said, \u2018Oh, your dad\u2019s so cool,\u2019\u201d he recalled. Simone Harle, 47, a journalist in Perth, Australia, also decided to cross oceans for the event. She called the   trip to Indio  \u2014   her first visit to the United States  \u2014   \u201ca pilgrimage\u201d in honor of the music. \u201cThis is the soundtrack to my life,\u201d she said, which made an overall cost of more than $5, 000 a  . \u201cIt was an automatic reaction for me. I\u2019ve got goose bumps all over my body and on my eyeballs just thinking about it. \u201d Others took the idea of a musical pilgrimage even further. Jon Langille, 55, spent a month riding an electric bicycle more than 1, 800 miles to the festival from British Columbia. \u201cMy wife and I couldn\u2019t agree on what kind of trip to make this,\u201d he said. \u201cHer idea was to fly in and fly out. That\u2019s all fine and dandy, but I really wanted to make an experience of it. \u201d He continued, \u201cI\u2019ve been a busy guy for 20 years and the opportunity to take a month off and be by myself, to meditatively pedal my bicycle 2, 000 miles to a rock concert, really appealed to me  \u2014   especially for a     thing like this. \u201d Ms. Varon was equally committed to attending, but went the crafty route instead: To ensure access to the   show and save money, she sought a job on the Desert Trip grounds and was hired as a supervisor for the V. I. P. ushers both weekends. Her son Sam will be on staff as well. \u201cHe was available,\u201d Ms. Varon said. At home, \u201che\u2019s golfing, job searching and sitting on the couch  \u2014   he\u2019s having a good old time  \u2014   but I was like, \u2018This is kind of mandatory. \u2019\u201d While the Indio area is known for its   snowbirds, retirees and familial duos are not its typical festival audience. \u201cI would never rent my house to the Coachella or Stagecoach people,\u201d said Susan Andrews, who lives in nearby Indian Wells, of the annual   events also held at the Polo Grounds. \u201cThey tell you it\u2019s a group of four and it\u2019s really a group of 15. \u201d For Desert Trip, however, Ms. Andrews opted to rent six of her time share properties to concertgoers, along with the three spare bedrooms in her home. \u201cI have a doctor coming to stay,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are older people  \u2014   some of them went to Woodstock. They\u2019ll be calm. \u201d Another local, Cheryl Craig, said she, too, expects a more tranquil crowd for Desert Trip, which she plans to attend both weekends. \u201cThis is the kind of music that I grew up on,\u201d Ms. Craig, 57, said. \u201cJust having lost Prince and David Bowie this year, you wonder: When is the last time you\u2019re going to get to see these people?\u201d Such   reminiscence may prove inevitable for fans at a gathering with such weighty, last hurrah connotations. \u201cThese bands were a moment in my life a long time ago and they were very significant,\u201d said Mr. Langille, the cyclist. \u201cI, like probably them, have moved on past my heyday years, but it\u2019s a great opportunity to revisit that time and those people. \u201d At the same time, being among peers \u201cmight be kind of refreshing,\u201d not simply nostalgic, he said. At concerts geared toward younger audiences, \u201cpeople in their 20s are   us like we\u2019ve just discovered rock music,\u201d Mr. Langille said. \u201cIt drives me nuts. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563713.6707053}
