Muhammad, a   Olympian at age 30, came from behind to edge a Ukranian fencer, Olena Kravatska,   in the round of 32 of the women\u2019s saber competition, but she lost later Monday, to C\u00e9cilia Berder of France,   in the round of 16. Saber is the quickest and most aggressive of the fencing disciplines. Fencers score quickly, slashing for points, without a lot of the fancy parrying of foil fencing. Milliseconds can separate a winning touch from one that is too slow. Wearing a mask emblazoned with the American flag, Muhammad punctuated her scores with roars of delight and showed visible frustration when calls did not go her way. \u201cI always say that in a sport like fencing, you\u2019re your own biggest opponent,\u201d she said afterward. \u201cIf you can control yourself and your nerves and your emotions, and execute the actions that you want, you\u2019ll always be successful, and I failed to do that today. \u201cThis has been a beautiful experience for me. I know that this was written for me, the chips fell where they did, and I feel proud to represent Team U. S. A. even in defeat. \u201d Muhammad, of Maplewood, N. J. first tried fencing at age 13. When she competed in softball, tennis, track and volleyball, her mother, Denise, adjusted her uniforms in accordance with the family\u2019s Muslim faith, adding stretch pants for track and sweatpants for volleyball. \u201cMy parents were on a mission to find a sport without alteration,\u201d Muhammad said in an interview in February. Muhammad said of her hijab: \u201cPeople ask Muslim women about it  \u2014   not just athletes  \u2014   all the time. Like, aren\u2019t you hot? On a hot day, you\u2019d still wear a shirt and pants. I would not leave the house without it. \u201d Muhammad\u2019s accomplishments led to an invitation to join President Obama when he made his first visit as president to an American mosque in Baltimore in February. Muhammad was among the prominent American Muslims invited to a   discussion with Mr. Obama before his speech. After losing on Monday, she said that many people in America, both Muslims and   did not believe Muslim women participated in sports. \u201cI want to break cultural norms and show girls that it\u2019s important to be active it\u2019s important to be involved in sport,\u201d she said. The other American in the saber competition, Mariel Zagunis, the gold medalist in 2004 and 2008, also lost in the round of 16. The third American, Dagmara Wozniak, was eliminated in the round of 32.'"}, "time": 1742628382.870291}
