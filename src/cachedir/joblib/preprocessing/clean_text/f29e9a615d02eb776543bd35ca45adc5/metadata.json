Even if some show more classified information passed its way through the private server, it should not change the FBI\u2019s earlier decision that a criminal charge would be unfair without evidence of intent or coverup. But so long as this is not categorically established, there may be a nagging doubt in some minds that the FBI suspects otherwise. \\nVermont Senator Bernie Sanders destroyed the issue of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails early in the Democratic primary campaign, noting that they\u2019re a giant pile of minutiae and that the American people are more concerned about economic fairness, trade policies and the corrosive effect of Citizens United on our politics. Famously, he said: \\nLet me say something that may not be good politics, but the Secretary is right. People and America are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails. \\nThe American people aren\u2019t buying Trump\u2019s lies about the FBI Director\u2019s vague memo \u2013 written entirely without actual facts \u2013 signifies anything other than a DC game being played by House Republicans. Even CNN\u2019s New Day plainly says at the start of this video plainly that, \u201cTrump is Lying.\u201d \\nRepublicans are in familiar territory after having run a divisive and needlessly incendiary political campaign this year, and stuck focusing on literally any little thing they can find about the Democratic nominee to distract voters from the real issues. \\nIt didn\u2019t work during primary season and it\u2019s not likely to work now. \\nWatch Bernie Sanders debunk the Republican email spin machine in one minute here:'"}, "time": 1742564139.3681586}
