For the anchors chosen to preside over this fall\u2019s presidential debates, the excoriation of Mr. Lauer was a   call signaling what modern viewers now expect from a moderator  \u2014   and a stark example of how media figures can become partisan flash points in a   election. On Friday, for the second straight day, aides to Hillary Clinton accused Mr. Lauer of being unfair to their candidate, blasting out a   email saying he \u201clet Donald Trump walk all over him. \u201d Borrowing a page from Mr. Trump\u2019s   playbook, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign asked supporters to donate because \u201cwe have to do what the press won\u2019t. \u201d Conservative websites like Breitbart News portrayed the attacks on Mr. Lauer as a   pressure tactic, saying that the criticism could encourage future moderators to go easier on Mrs. Clinton  \u2014   and be tougher on her opponent. Mr. Trump, for his part, declared at a rally, \u201cI thought Matt Lauer did a very good job. \u201d All this foreshadows more scrutiny, and perhaps anxiety, for the debate moderators  \u2014   Anderson Cooper of CNN, Lester Holt of NBC, Martha Raddatz of ABC and Chris Wallace of Fox News  \u2014   whose encounters with the candidates could draw record audiences. Mr. Wallace, asked on Fox News this week if he was excited or nervous about his debate gig, flashed a sly smile. \u201cThe answer is yes,\u201d he replied dryly. His fellow moderators have not discussed their preparations. But Bob Schieffer, the veteran CBS anchor who moderated presidential debates in 2004, 2008 and 2012, said in an interview that several had reached out to him for counsel. Citing professional decorum, he declined to name names, but said they had expressed variations on the same joke: What have I gotten myself into here? \u201cIt\u2019s different from the kind of scrutiny that I\u2019ve gotten,\u201d Mr. Schieffer said, referring to the glaring spotlight on this year\u2019s moderators. \u201cIt\u2019s just exponentially more. \u201d Mr. Wallace raised eyebrows after saying that he did not consider    \u2014   or \u201c\u201d in his words  \u2014   to be a central component of his moderating role. His comments circulated again in the days after what was arguably Mr. Lauer\u2019s most memorable misstep, when he failed to challenge Mr. Trump\u2019s false claim that he had opposed the Iraq war. The notion of a moderator as a   \u201cis too simplistic,\u201d said the Rev. John I. Jenkins, the president of the University of Notre Dame and a board member of the Commission on Presidential Debates, the nonpartisan group that oversees the events. \u201cWhat a good journalist does is ask   questions that challenge the candidate to explain. \u201d \u201cThe moderator can\u2019t do it all the onus falls on us a little bit, as the body politic,\u201d to determine if a candidate is plausible, he added. \u201cThe moderator can make a mistake by being the voice of God, saying, \u2018Here\u2019s the way it is. \u2019\u201d He said he did not watch the NBC forum. But he added that the commission had sought out moderators who would facilitate a civil and sober discussion  \u2014   \u201cIt sounds a little moralizing, but I\u2019m a priest, so indulge me,\u201d he said  \u2014   in contrast with what he considered flashier, less substantive debates during the primaries.     is an increasingly visible tool of the modern political press, particularly in a     campaign where candidates frequently bend facts and audiences often rely on partisan news outlets to interpret them. There is also the presence of Mr. Trump, a candidate who freely dissembles in a manner rarely seen in a presidential campaign. Still, Mr. Schieffer, of CBS, said he believed that \u201cthe chief   should be the candidates. \u201d \u201cIf one of them says something wrong, or inconsistent with what they have said previously, the other candidate should have the first opportunity to call them on it,\u201d Mr. Schieffer said. Failing that, he added, \u201cit\u2019s the moderator\u2019s responsibility to set the record straight. \u201d Mr. Lauer spoke with Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump    so he could not rely on the candidate\u2019s opponent to jump in to contradict a dubious claim. Asked about Mr. Lauer\u2019s performance, Mr. Schieffer demurred, saying, \u201cI\u2019m not in the habit of piling on. \u201d Others were less shy in the wake of the broadcast. Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York and Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, speaking at the Capitol, expressed annoyance at what they saw as Mr. Lauer\u2019s lackluster attempt to hold Mr. Trump accountable for some of his more unusual comments. \u201cHe missed the whole boat,\u201d Mr. Rangel said, referring to Mr. Lauer. Jennifer Palmieri, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s communications director, contacted NBC News executives to discuss Wednesday\u2019s forum, according to two people familiar with the discussion. Internally, the Clinton campaign believed the backlash against NBC could ultimately be beneficial, if the moderators of the coming debates are on eggshells about ensuring equal treatment and holding Mr. Trump to account. Mrs. Clinton, for her part, was already in a motorcade to her home in Chappaqua, N. Y. when Mr. Trump appeared with Mr. Lauer. While the Democratic nominee did not consider Mr. Lauer\u2019s questions out of bounds, she did relish the subsequent coverage of the event that suggested Mr. Trump had gotten off easy, said a person familiar with her thinking. On Friday, the chairman of NBC News, Andrew Lack, sent an upbeat memo to his staff that declared the forum a success, noting that the event had generated days of headlines about Mr. Trump\u2019s praise of the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, and criticism of the American military leadership. \u201cMatt did a tremendous job  \u2014   driving one of the most serious discussions to date on these topics,\u201d wrote Mr. Lack, who is close with Mr. Lauer. The pressure on NBC News, however, is not likely to relent: the network\u2019s evening news anchor, Mr. Holt, is set to oversee the first presidential debate, set for Sept. 26 at Hofstra University on Long Island. Mr. Schieffer, who at 79 has watched more than a  \u2019s worth of debates, said he had faith that this year\u2019s moderators would be prepared. But, Mr. Schieffer added: \u201cThere won\u2019t be a perfect debate. There hasn\u2019t been one yet. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563563.6503916}
