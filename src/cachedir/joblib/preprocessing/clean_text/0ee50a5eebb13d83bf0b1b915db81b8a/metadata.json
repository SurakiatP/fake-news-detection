[Gaffney began with a story about one of his colleagues delivering copies of the Center for Security Policy\u2019s book CAIR Is Hamas on Capitol Hill and discovering he couldn\u2019t deliver a copy to noted   opponent Sen. Pat Leahy ( ) without a government ID.  LISTEN: \u201cThis individual could vote without that ID, of course, but he can\u2019t give Senator Leahy a book about an internal threat to our country from Hamas. It\u2019s just ridiculous,\u201d Gaffney said. He pronounced himself pleased with President Trump\u2019s first week, saluting \u201cthe signaling, and the executive orders, and the statements that the President has made thus far, and the statements for that matter that even people like Rex Tillerson and his confirmation hearing made about the nature of the challenges we\u2019re facing internationally and the necessity of rebuilding our military to contend with them. \u201d Among those necessary measures he included constructing a     missile defense system and eradicating radical Islamic terrorism from the face of the earth, as Trump has promised. \u201cThese are very encouraging signs,\u201d Gaffney said. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much an aggressive national security policy, Alex, with respect. It\u2019s a   policy that\u2019s rooted in the principle that Ronald Reagan, my old boss, espoused and practiced called \u2018Peace Through Strength.\u2019 I think it\u2019s very welcome, and long overdue, frankly. \u201d He noted that, with the exception of the invasion of Grenada, Reagan didn\u2019t \u201cactually have to use our military power,\u201d but he rebuilt it and \u201ccreated, as part of a larger strategy, conditions that brought down our principal enemy  \u2014   without firing, as they say, a shot  \u2014   the Soviet Union. \u201d \u201cI think Donald Trump gets this. If you want to prevent wars, prepare to fight them,\u201d he advised. \u201cThere are a lot of people around the world who witnessed Barack Obama take the opposite approach, weaken us, hollow out our military, signal a desire for appeasement at any price. And they became much more dangerous. \u201d  \u201cThe prospect of a conflict with Communist China today, Alex, as you know, is vastly higher than it was a decade ago,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cAnd that\u2019s partly because the Chinese have been rapidly building the military with which to attack us, and to dominate the South China Sea, and so on. But partly it\u2019s also because they have perceived the opportunity for either getting what they want without conflict, their strategy of strength to obtain their objectives  \u2014   or they think if they do have to have a conflict with us, they\u2019ll prevail in it. \u201d  \u201cSo this is a very dangerous approach. It\u2019s been proven to fail time and time again, whereas I believe peace through strength has been proven to work rather consistently throughout the course of human history,\u201d Gaffney asserted. Marlow asked Gaffney about the significance of President Trump\u2019s plan to move the U. S. embassy for Israel to Jerusalem. Gaffney described the   state of affairs as \u201cbizarre,\u201d noting that Israel is the only country he knows of where the U. S. embassy isn\u2019t located in the national capital. \u201cThe signals that Donald Trump has sent, in terms of his commitment to restore the kind of strong partnership and strategic alliance that we have historically had with Israel, is a signal, a statement, of his break with his predecessor,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important not just because it matters to our security whether Israel is secure, but it\u2019s also important because it restores the sense that it\u2019s also better to be a friend of the United States than an enemy. \u201d \u201cObama had that completely backwards, and as a result we had more enemies, and I think fewer friends,\u201d he observed ruefully. Gaffney said moving the U. S. embassy was \u201cimportant in a number of respects,\u201d beginning with Jerusalem being \u201cthe rightful place for us to be represented. \u201d \u201cSecond of all, it sends a signal of our commitment to Israel, and the status of Jerusalem as the undivided eternal capital of the Jewish state,\u201d he continued. \u201cPeople talk a lot about, well, there will be violence, there will be the Palestinians and holy war and all the rest. I seriously doubt it, because I think the Arabs at this moment more generally, beyond the Palestinians  \u2014   for whom, by the way, they don\u2019t have a whole lot of use  \u2014   have a view that this is a time to cultivate a relationship with Donald Trump, not precipitate conflict with him. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to have much truck with the Arab street blowing up. \u201d \u201cHere\u2019s the larger point: if Donald Trump, having made this commitment to Israel, backs away from it, that will be seen by the very radical Islamic terrorists that he has promised to eradicate from the face of the earth, as evidence that they can in fact extort him to submission. That\u2019s exactly the wrong message to send,\u201d Gaffney warned. \u201cI think it\u2019s time. I think that he can do it quite easily, actually. I believe the first order of business ought to be simply to change out the plaque in front of the consulate in Jerusalem. Call it an \u2018embassy.\u2019 It\u2019s a done deal on Day One,\u201d he advised. \u201cI think there may be histrionics, but I think they\u2019re eminently manageable. The symbolism is very important, both to Israel, and I think to potential adversaries. \u201d Marlow referred to the criticism Trump has taken for his \u201cAmerica first\u201d policy, suggesting critics have willfully misinterpreted it to mean \u201cAmerica only,\u201d and wondered if Trump would have difficulty sticking to such a dramatic change in U. S. policy outlook, or keeping his bold promise to \u201ceradicate radical Islamic terrorism from the face of the earth. \u201d Gaffney said frankly that it would depend, in part, on \u201cwhether he remains committed to the sorts of principles and guiding philosophy that he\u2019s laid out, not just in this particular context or in his inaugural address, but throughout the campaign. \u201d He pointed to the decisions Trump was scheduled to announce today about \u201crestricting entry into this country against people who do not share our values, and who specifically may be trying to bring in this totalitarian sharia doctrine\u201d as a demonstration of the President\u2019s determination to stand by his campaign promises. \u201cI think if he hews to all of those principles, he\u2019s going to be fine. If he staffs his administration  \u2014   this is the kicker  \u2014   if he staffs his administration, not just at the Cabinet level, with people who hew to that line as well, he will be fine,\u201d Gaffney predicted. \u201cThere is a concern, I have to tell you, among some of us that at lower levels, people who don\u2019t seem to share that are being considered, or actually given, appointments, and people who do share those principles are not,\u201d he added.  \u201cSo this is very much a work in progress. I believe Donald Trump is very   on this. I think that a number of the people around him  \u2014   our mutual friend Steve Bannon among them, Michael Flynn of course, the National Security adviser, General Mattis at the Defense Department, Rex Tillerson in his statements before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee  \u2014   they seem to get it,\u201d he said.  \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make sure that they\u2019ve got people below them who support and will faithfully execute the President\u2019s policy of protecting us against whatever you want to call it: radical Islamic terrorism, sharia supremacism, you pick your term. That\u2019s the mortal threat of our time. And by the way, it is present here in the form of the Muslim Brotherhood. I hope one of the early actions  \u2014   a defining action of this President  \u2014   will be that he designates the Muslim Brotherhood as what it is, a terrorist organization,\u201d said Gaffney. Marlow concluded by asking for Gaffney\u2019s take on the Syria peace talks currently being held in Kazakhstan under the auspices of Russia, Turkey, and Iran, but pointedly excluding the U. S. and its coalition partners from a major role. \u201cWell, we\u2019ve seen this movie before,\u201d Gaffney replied. \u201cI\u2019ll be very surprised if the   has any duration to it at all. I think the truth of the matter is, what\u2019s happening on the ground, Alex, is that the people who have been fighting this civil war to this point, primarily, against the government of Syria  \u2014   the Sunni Arabs  \u2014   are being displaced. They\u2019re being replaced by Shiites from Iraq, in many cases, and elsewhere. \u201d  \u201cYou\u2019re going to see a population transfer that I think ultimately will cause this Syrian conflict to peter out  \u2014   with the government of Assad still in power, the Russians in a stronger position, the Iranians of course in a much stronger position, having created what\u2019s been called a \u2018Shiite Crescent\u2019 from their own country all the way to the Mediterranean,\u201d he predicted. \u201cThey\u2019re very important, and frankly very dangerous, strategic developments, but I think that\u2019s where this is headed. \u201d Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.
