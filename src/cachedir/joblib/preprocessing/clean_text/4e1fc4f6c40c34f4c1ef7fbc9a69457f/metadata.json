[\u201cI suspect it\u2019s all politics,\u201d said Carney, adding, \u201cEven when Donald Trump was running for president, we saw Macy\u2019s drop his clothing line. We saw NBC turn against him. \u201d  \u201cWhat I want to say,\u201d continued Carney, \u201c[is] all of this just emphasizes to me the sacrifices the Trump family is willing to make for America. People say conflicts of interest they\u2019re trying to get ahead. However, time after time, we see that they\u2019re actually sacrificing business prospects as these politically charged businesses turn against them. \u201d Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern. '"}, "time": 1742564330.6238267}
