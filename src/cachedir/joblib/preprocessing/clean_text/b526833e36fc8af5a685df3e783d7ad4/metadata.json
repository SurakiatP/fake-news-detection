By: November 21, 2016 \\nSo, soon-to-be-ex-President Obama won\u2019t be going away anytime soon. \\nAfter George W. Bush left office, he essentially went silent. He had no criticism for President Obama; he didn\u2019t sound off about Mitt Romney or Donald Trump. He went away. Not so for Obama. It seems that Barack Obama will follow the Jimmy Carter pathway to Annoyingland: he\u2019ll be commenting whenever possible. After acknowledging that Bush \u201ccould not have been more gracious to me when I came in,\u201d Obama said, \u201cAs an American citizen who cares deeply about our country, if there are issues that have less to do with the specifics of some legislative proposal or battle or go to core questions about our values and ideals, and if I think that it\u2019s necessary or helpful for me to defend those ideals, I\u2019ll examine it when it comes.\u201d \\nThis comes as welcome news for Republicans. Obama\u2019s policy unpopularity \u2013 and his tendency to lecture from on high to Americans in rural areas \u2013 means that he\u2019ll suck all the oxygen out of the room when it comes to criticizing Trump and Republicans. Middle Americans voted for Trump in order to sound off against Obama\u2019s obvious scorn for them. Here\u2019s what Obama had to say about those who didn\u2019t vote for Trump in today\u2019s Der Spiegel : \\nIf you look at the new generation of Americans, they reflect the vision that I spoke about. They're diverse. They believe in tolerance. They're accepting of things like same-sex marriage. They believe in integration. The problem, though, is that young people are less likely to vote than older people. What results is a situation in which sometimes the elections don't fully reflect the views of the American population. Essentially, the president-elect was supported by about 27 percent of the American population. One of our challenges, historically, is that we have very low voting rates, even during presidential elections. \\nThis sort of language drove Americans to Trump. And if Obama continues to critique Trump from the outside with this sort of language, not only will he be doing Trump a favor, he\u2019ll be preventing any other Democrat from taking a leading role in opposing Trump. He\u2019ll become the point of resistance for his own party \u2013 and his party won\u2019t be able to escape his shadow. \\nObama\u2019s ego has already cost his party the presidency, the Senate, the House, a bevy of state legislators and governor\u2019s mansions. Now it may cost them the future. \\nExcellent. \""}, "time": 1742564295.774583}
