Trump, Trump\u2019s close advisor Roger J. Stone, Jr., Stone\u2019s organization Stop the Steal Inc., the Ohio Republican Party (\u2018ORP\u2019), and others are conspiring to threaten, intimidate, and thereby prevent minority voters in urban neighborhoods from voting in the 2016 election,\u201d the lawsuit claims.\\nIn reality, Stop the Steal is simply planning to have volunteers conduct their own exit polls outside of polling stations. Despite their never having mentioned targeting minorities, or intimidating anyone, multiple outlets picked up the Democrat\u2019s version story after Stop the Steal announced their effort.\\n\u201cThe Clintons had to cheat and rig the system to steal the Democratic nomination from Bernie Sanders. Why wouldn\u2019t they try to steal the election from Donald Trump?\u201d Stop the Steal\u2019s website states. They are calling for \u201ctargeted EXIT-POLLING in targeted states and targeted localities that we believe the Democrats could manipulate based on their local control, to determine if the results of the vote have been skewed by manipulation.\u201d\\nDemocratic outlets such as the Huffington Post and Media Matters have posted breathless articles claiming that exit-polling, which is conducted by every major media outlet, is somehow intimidation if done by an organization that favors the Republican candidate.\\n\u201cTrump and Stone appear to be of like minds when it comes to deploying citizens to the polls on Election Day to watch other citizens vote. Trump regularly encourages his mostly white supporters to stand guard on Election Day at polling stations in areas where the population is largely made up of minorities and \u2018watch\u2019 the polls,\u201d the Huffington Post wrote.\\nThe article the quoted Trump himself, where he makes absolutely no mention of targeting minority voters.\\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to go out, and you\u2019ve got to get your friends, and you\u2019ve got to get everyone you know,\u201d they quoted Trump saying at a rally in Pennsylvania, \u201cand you\u2019ve got to watch your polling booths. I hear too many bad stories, and we can\u2019t lose an election because of, you know what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d\\nWe Are Change spoke to Jack Posobiec of Stop the Steal to learn more about their efforts, and the lawsuit.\\n\u201cOur exit polling plan is very simple, we are going to dress in neutral, non-partisan clothing and request voters take the survey after they are finished voting. We are using the same types of questions that the AP uses regarding how someone voted, their top election issues, and asking their demographic info. The only difference is we are going to focus on one party rule precincts that have been reported to have irregularities in the past, such as in inner city Philadelphia,\u201d Posobiec explained.\\nWhen asked to clarify whether or not they intend to campaign, or harass, voters before they enter the polls, Posobiec stated that is not their intention.\\n\u201cWe are only talking to people after they have completed voting, and will be dressed in neutral clothing. We also requested our volunteers to not wear Red, as there is a large movement of Trump supporters to wear red on election day, and we want to remain neutral,\u201d he explained.\\nPosobiec then referenced the infamous case of the New Black Panther Party actually intimidating voters , with weapons, in 2008. Many believed that the case was mishandled before being dropped.\\n\u201cI was involved in filming the Black Panthers dressed in black military clothing swinging billy clubs at white voters in Philadelphia in 2008, so I am very surprised our neutral exit polling plan would be seen as \u2018intimidation\u2019 by the Democrats,\u201d he continued.\\nJustice officials who served in the Bush administration argued that the department had enough evidence to pursue the case, and that it was dropped for political reasons.\\n\u201cHolder\u2019s officials argued that the Voting Rights Act of 1965 did not apply to white people, only for minorities,\u201d Posobiec stated. \u201cIn retrospect, this was the first sign that Obama would politicize the DOJ. Explains why they blocked the FBI from investigating the Clinton Foundation, or sending 100 FBI agents to Ferguson.\u201d\\nWhen asked if they would be fighting the lawsuit, Posobiec stated that they absolutely will be.\\n\u201cWe absolutely are. These tactics were used against Citizens for Trump to shut down our rally in Cleveland in July, and we received the aid of the ACLU and won in court,\u201d he said.\\nIn the lawsuit, the DNC asks the court to \u201cdeclare that defendants\u2019 \u2018exit polling\u2019 and \u2018citizen journalist\u2019 initiatives are contrary to law,\u201d and bar them from encouraging anyone to do so, or from doing it themselves.\\n\u201cThey are fighting scrutiny from independent citizens, but our elections are the fundamental cornerstone of American democracy, and should be held to the highest standard possible,\u201d Posobiec stated. \u201cGiven the depth of collusion we have seen between mainstream media and establishment partisan political operatives this election through Wikileaks, we need citizen journalists and independent exit polls more than ever now.\u201d\\nDuring the primaries, there were unprecedented discrepancies between the exit polling and actual counted votes \u2014 always in Clinton\u2019s favor.\\n\u201cThey cheated the debates, they cheated Bernie, so its perfectly reasonable to be concerned they would cheat in November,\u201d he concluded.\\nPosobiec also stated that they are in no way coordinating with the Republican National Committee or the Trump campaign.\\nThe post DNC Files Lawsuit to Bar Citizen Journalists From the Polls appeared first on We Are Change .\\n'"}, "time": 1742628388.7551744}
