Of course they don\u2019t. Here\u2019s the video: Dana Bash: Is your DC hotel opening free advertising?Donald Trump: \u201cNo, not at all\u201d https://t.co/6OZtrfIwim https://t.co/9HHqooom8r \\n\u2014 CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 26, 2016 \\n\u201cSo to people who say you\u2019re taking time out of swing states to go do this, you say?\u201d Bash asked. \\n\u201cI say the following: You have been covering me for the last \u2014 long time. I did yesterday eight stops and three major speeches, and I\u2019ve been doing this for weeks straight,\u201d Trump responded. \\n\u201cFor you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because Hillary Clinton does one stop and then she goes home and sleeps. And yet you\u2019ll ask me that question. I think that\u2019s a very rude question, to be honest with you.\u201d Trump exclaimed. \\nTrump added that the opening of the hotel also served to prove a point that he can get things built under budget and ahead of schedule, suggesting that the country needs to be able to follow suit. \\nDid the media ask Hillary where she was when she went off the grid for six days with only one event last month? Nope. \\nDid they make any comments when she took the entire first half of August off to recuperate from exhaustion/pneumonia/dehydration or whatever they\u2019re making up? Of course not. \\n\u201cHer speeches are so short \u2013 they don\u2019t last long, they\u2019re like 10 minutes and \u2018let\u2019s get out of here,\u2019\u201d Donald Trump said about her schedule. \u201cGo back home and go to sleep.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742562995.359649}
