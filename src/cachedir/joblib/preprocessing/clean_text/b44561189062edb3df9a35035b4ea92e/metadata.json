Other alternatives are gloomy.\u201d \\nThe Hadi administration, however, said that it had not received any roadmap for a political settlement. \\nPeace talks, which were held between Yemen\u2019s opposing parties in Kuwait, ended in deadlock in August. \\nEarlier this week, Ahmed made a visit to Sana\u2019a, where he held meetings with Yemen\u2019s warring sides and called for a return to a cessation of hostilities to allow aid deliveries. \\nThe Riyadh regime resumed its deadly airstrikes on Yemen on Sunday hours after a three-day truce in the conflict-ridden country expired. \\nYemen has seen almost daily military attacks by Saudi Arabia since late March 2015, with the UN putting the toll from the aggression at more than 10,000. \\nThe offensive was launched to crush the Houthi Ansarullah movement and its allies and reinstate the former Yemeni government. \\nThe Houthi Ansarullah fighters took state matters in their own hands after the resignation and escape of Hadi, which threw Yemen into a state of uncertainty and threatened a total security breakdown in the country, where an al-Qaeda affiliate is present.
