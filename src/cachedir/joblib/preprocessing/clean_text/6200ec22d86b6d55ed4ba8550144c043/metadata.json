He can even repair his own go-kart. \\nRecently, he made a clock that he was proud of so he decided to take it into school and show his classmates and teachers. Sadly, instead of celebrating his achievement, one of his teachers called the police on him because they thought that it might be a bomb. \\nWhen the police arrived, they took the threat seriously and believed that it could be a bomb as well, even though it obviously wasn\u2019t. Eventually, the police charged him with making a clock and misrepresenting it as a bomb, even though he consistently told everyone that it was a clock, and denied that it was a bomb when the teachers or the police suggested it. \\nThe young man was then handcuffed and taken to a juvenile detention center, and his clock was taken and put in an evidence room. He was also suspended from school and was unable to attend a student council meeting that he was scheduled to be a part of. \\n\u201cHere in high school, none of the teachers know what I can do,\u201d Ahmed told Dallas News after the incident. \\nHe then explained that when he showed his engineering teacher what he created, he was warned not to show it to the other teachers. \\n\u201cHe was like, \u2018That\u2019s really nice, I would advise you not to show any other teachers\u2019,\u201d Ahmed said. \\nHe then kept the clock in his bag until his English class when the alarm went off and disturbed his teacher. After the class, Ahmed showed his teacher what was making the noise, and she accused him of bringing a bomb to school. \\n\u201cShe was like, it looks like a bomb,\u201d he said. \\n\u201cI told her, \u2018It doesn\u2019t look like a bomb to me,\u2019\u201d he explained. \\nThe teacher took the clock from him and he had expected that was the end of it. However, towards the end of the day, Ahmed was pulled out of class and taken to a room filled with police officers. \\nHe said that the officers then attempted to get him to admit that he tried to make a bomb. \\n\u201cThey were like, \u2018So you tried to make a bomb? \u2019\u201d Ahmed said. \\n\u201cI told them no, I was trying to make a clock.\u201d \\nThe officer then told him, \u201c \u2018It looks like a movie bomb to me.\u2019\u201d \\nThe police even admit that Ahmed never once said the device was a bomb, and they never had any reason to believe that it actually was one, but the police still seemed to think he was lying about something, even though they didn\u2019t have any proof. \\n\u201cWe have no information that he claimed it was a bomb. He kept maintaining it was a clock, but there was no broader explanation,\u201d police spokesman James McLellan said. \\n\u201cIt could reasonably be mistaken as a device if left in a bathroom or under a car. The concern was, what was this thing built for? Do we take him into custody?\u201d he added. \\nThey couldn\u2019t possibly imagine that a young man would want to teach himself a valuable skill and share his achievement with his teachers. \\n\u201cThey thought, \u2018How could someone like this build something like this unless it\u2019s a threat?\u2019,\u201d Ahmed said. \\nAhmed\u2019s father, Mohamed Elhassan Mohamed believes that his family is being discriminated against. \\n\u201cHe just wants to invent good things for mankind, but because his name is Mohamed and because of Sept. 11, I think my son got mistreated,\u201d he said. \\nThere has since been an outpour of support on social media since Ahmed\u2019s story went public. He has even gotten support from Mark Z and President Obama. Cool clock, Ahmed. Want to bring it to the White House? We should inspire more kids like you to like science. It's what makes America great. \\n\u2014 President Obama (@POTUS) September 16, 2015 \\nJohn Vibes is an author, researcher and investigative journalist who takes a special interest in the counter-culture and the drug war.

As a Vietnam Vet who spent a great deal of time in the Philippines when they were under martial law, life, liberty, and public safety are too precious to let slip. Every time a citizen is persecuted, the Terrorists win. That is the point of terrorism. Destruction alone is not the object. Having us turn on each other is. A draconian law enforcement suits the political purposes by creating innocent martyrs. When they violate the laws they are paid to enforce and threaten the public safety they are sworn to protect, we lose our liberty and the TERRORISTS win. John Lloyd Scharf \\nI did that.

There exists a possibility it might work. Just thinking away Miguel Angel Coria \\nI\u2019m assuming your african american because i actually went into your page, took time to form an idea before I got offended, but just from your comments i\u2019m realizing your just as ignorant as rednecks. People who realize they can\u2019t win in an intellectual debate do they directly start offending their opponent, you might as well start wearing a Donald Trump shirt and watching duck dynasty. Because the problem is that Government separates people by race, religion, or beliefs. They way they can\u2019t stand together against them. Try researching information before going and thinking your right about everything you say. I\u2019m Douglas Brigham \\nCops fuck up its not the cops fault. \\nI guess it\u2019s also not Dylan Roof fault that he killed 9 people. Because of the media. \\nSMH Beth Pucku \\nI\u2019m Canadian and love all you. Obama is obviously trying to switch over the American people brain washing from hating Muslim to loving them cos Obama knows he\u2019s killing all thses people over seas to get the oil to feed the industrial military war machine. \\nI\u2019m reading an article, generating my own thought about it and creating an idea that might help solve the issue ? And what are you doing about it? Small minded people discuss other people. Average minded people discuss events, Critical thinkers discuss ideas. Aimee Hernandez \\nMiguel your initial comment is very basic n ambiguous. You appear to contradict yourself to say the least. What \u201cidea\u201d are you creating to solve the issue? Perhaps you should take a couple steps back, not just one, but a couple sir. I can construe an opinion based on the few comments you have posted. FYI you can\u2019t be part of the solution when your basic mentality is part of the issue. With all due respect read some more\u2026.a lot more then pretend to have some sort of \u201cintellictual\u201d debate. Just saying \u2026 Miguel Angel Coria \\nI\u2019ll leave it plain and simple so you and your friend can understand, I stated my opinion, and an idea (Not the exact blue print). I never stated any of those as a fact. I try and help by spreading thought process but it\u2019s people like you and your friend who go around acting like overseers deciding what is wrong and what is right. I read, I watch, I think. I don\u2019t offend people directly or insult people who try and improve and give opinion. So re-read the post and all it\u2019s comments think about it for a second and just like in elementary school if you have nothing nice to say, don\u2019t say anything. Go to your hompage and on will find a tab that say\u2019s \u201cwhat\u2019s on your mind today\u201d go ahead click and go crazy.
