[U. S. retirees, a recent city study revealed, are also causing conflict in the city, raising real estate prices, demanding   service, and threatening to sue locals accustomed to more \u201ccasual\u201d business contracts.  In a report this week, the Miami Herald highlights the blissful existence of   white American migrants who have flocked to Cuenca, attracted by retiree blogs and news sites that emphasize the appeal of its temperate weather and inexpensive healthcare and real estate. \u201cIn Cuenca, a city of about 350, 000 people, they\u2019ve found robust public transportation, an extensive museum network, solid healthcare and markets bursting with fresh fruits and produce,\u201d the Herald notes. \u201cIt\u2019s a place where their       bath apartment costs less than $400 a month. They\u2019ve found that for about $1, 500 a month, they can live a solidly   lifestyle, dining out frequently and traveling. \u201d The newspaper notes that a bus ride for seniors costs $0. 12, and medical procedures are orders of magnitude cheaper than they would be at home. The city commissioned a study on its foreign population in February 2017 that identified the majority of these new Cuencans as \u201c\u2018baby boomers\u2019 who began retiring in 2010 and  \u2026     4 percent of this population, estimated at 78 million, is planning to retire abroad. \u201d North American countries  \u2014   mostly the U. S. and Canada  \u2014   make up 93 percent of Cuenca\u2019s foreign population. Cuenca\u2019s \u201cboomers\u201d are more likely to have been professors before retirement than any other occupations, with \u201cexecutives\u201d coming in second place. The study delicately notes that many of these individuals \u201care not interested in being part of a new culture, and are more interested in that the city and its people respond to their needs and demands. \u201d Paramount among the city\u2019s concerns is that many Americans are demanding Cuencans speak English and creating   neighborhoods within the city. \u201cThere is a large group for which learning a language is outside of their interests and, faced with the frustration of not being able to communicate, express annoyance with Cuencans who do not tend to their demands in English,\u201d the study reads, adding that the city has invested in Spanish and idiomatic dictionaries for the new residents, but this has not solved the problem. Boomers are also annoyed by \u201cthe \u2018slowness\u2019 of service\u201d in Ecuador compared to the United States, and the common use of verbal or informal contracts. \u201cCases have been reported in which retired foreigners suggest a lawsuit against those who have not completed a previously agreed upon work,\u201d the report notes. In addition to cultural tensions, the study notes that 65 percent of the native Cuencan population is under 35, and many are frustrated that they must pay taxes and invest in the welfare state that foreign retiree migrants are now abusing. The Herald story, which cites some findings from this study, is the latest trend piece on Cuenca in a crowded genre. The Cuenca study followed years of anecdotal journalism noting the idiosyncratic Boomer wave moving south. The city of Cuenca, in a study published in February, found its foreign population grew 173 percent between 2001 and 2010. By 2012, outlets like the BBC were calling it an American \u201cpromised land. \u201d That article traced the Cuenca viral sensation among retiree migrants back to an article on the website Gringo Tree, which in turn noted that the wave of thousands of American   hitting the city followed the 2009 publication of an article in International Living that described the city as \u201cthe top destination in the world to retire. \u201d At the time, Cuenca\u2019s International Relations Director Dani Jara appeared pleased by the new influx of high spenders to her city. She told BBC, \u201cTourism we promote, one creates strategies for the medium and long term. But in the case of a migratory phenomenon, that is due to the city conditions. Cuenca has grown throughout its history into a city where one can live well. \u201d By 2013, Cuenca Mayor Paul Granda was describing the mass migrant wave as \u201ca little complicated for us. \u201d \u201cThe city is less accessible to Ecuadorians\u201d due to the wealthy Americans flocking there, he argued to ABC News, noting that average prices of basic goods had increased 40 to 50 percent. Two years later, Ecuador\u2019s Secretary of the Vice Ministry of Human Mobility was warning of wealthy American \u201cghettos\u201d threatening the character of Cuenca. \u201cThere should not be ghettos forming in zones where Americans live, versus those who live permanently in these places,\u201d Humberto Cordero said. The migration, he urged, \u201cmust be regulated. \u201d Cuenca\u2019s American invasion was not regulated, in part because local businesses and real estate owners preferred selling and renting to Americans. \u201cThey care for their spaces and pay what is fair,\u201d Cuencan homeowner Mar\u00eda Torres told Ecuador\u2019s El Comercio newspaper last year. She noted that their comfortable economic status and lack of children made for quiet, reliable tenants. The government has nonetheless continued to express concern over American migrants overrunning the city. New International Relations Director Ana Paulina Crespo told the Herald in this week\u2019s column that \u201cCuencanos are feeling like strangers in their own city\u201d and emphasized, \u201cCuenca never wanted to attract retirees  \u2026     we\u2019re facing lots of problems over how to deal with a phenomenon that we aren\u2019t responsible for creating. \u201d Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.'"}, "time": 1742628464.4790173}
