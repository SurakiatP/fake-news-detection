Mike Lee ( ) said the proposed House Republican health care legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare does \u201cvery little at all\u201d that would bring premiums down.  Lee said, \u201cI think he\u2019s wrong especially if what he\u2019s suggesting is that we have conservative policies in this bill that will bring down the cost of health care. Look, one of the things that has caused the cost of health care to spike so significantly is the regulatory section of the Affordable Care Act, which has put insurance companies in a position where they\u2019ve increased their premiums and the cost of health care across the board has gone up. \u201d \u201cThis bill does far too little about that,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt does very little at all, that would bring premiums down. And that\u2019s the concern I have with it, is what this would do to the cost of health care. We have to bring that under control. This bill doesn\u2019t do that to a degree sufficient for me to vote for it. \u201d (  Grabien) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742564504.9123468}
