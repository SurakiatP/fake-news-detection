Aides to Mr. Sanders have been pressing party officials for a significant role in drafting the platform for the Democratic convention in July, aiming to lock in strong planks on issues like a $   federal minimum wage, breaking up Wall Street banks and banning natural gas \u201cfracking. \u201d Amid his unexpectedly strong showing in the Democratic primaries, Mr. Sanders has tapped his    donor list to raise money for liberal congressional candidates in New York, Nevada and Washington State. And in the waning months of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, Mr. Sanders\u2019s allies are testing their muscle against the White House, mounting a public attack on the president\u2019s housing secretary, Juli\u00e1n Castro, over his department\u2019s sales of delinquent mortgages to banks and private equity firms. \u201cThere is a greater goal here,\u201d said Representative Ra\u00fal M. Grijalva of Arizona, a   of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, who sent a letter to Mr. Castro criticizing the mortgage sales. \u201cThe contribution of Bernie that will be lasting for us is that we will coalesce around an agenda. \u201d The pressure from Mr. Sanders and his allies is putting the party establishment, which is closely aligned with Hillary Clinton, in a delicate position. Democratic leaders are wary of steering the party too far left, but do not want to alienate the Sanders supporters whose votes Mrs. Clinton needs in November, or risk losing the vast new donor base Mr. Sanders has created. The institutional bulwarks against Mr. Sanders are significant: Hundreds of the party\u2019s \u201csuperdelegates\u201d have endorsed Mrs. Clinton, a signal of her broad support among the party\u2019s power brokers. The Democratic National Committee now relies on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s   to provide a fifth of its monthly income, an arrangement the Sanders campaign has criticized. And Mrs. Clinton is well positioned to block any proposals she would not want to defend in a general election. In January, the party chairwoman, Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, appointed dozens of Clinton supporters and advisers to the three standing committees of the Democratic Party convention. Of 45 potential members submitted by Mr. Sanders, she appointed just three, according to Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign. Gov. Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut, a top Clinton surrogate, will be   of the platform committee. Barney Frank, a former Massachusetts congressman and fierce critic of Mr. Sanders and his Wall Street proposals, will be a   of the rules committee, which governs procedure on the convention floor. Mark Longabaugh, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders, said he believed the campaign would ultimately be well represented on all the committees as more members are named. But he questioned how Ms. Wasserman Schultz had chosen her discretionary appointments. \u201cNot only are they supporting Clinton, but they have been extremely critical of Bernie Sanders,\u201d Mr. Longabaugh said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem like the right way to go if we want to have a convention that is evenhanded. \u201d Luis Miranda, a spokesman for the Democratic National Convention, said the party was \u201ccommitted to an open, inclusive and representative process\u201d to draft the platform. \u201cBoth of our campaigns will be represented on the drafting committee,\u201d Mr. Miranda said. Some fissures within the Democratic family may be inevitable. For eight years, Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency has muted ideological disagreement within the party. His moral authority as the country\u2019s first black commander in chief, his popularity with   Democratic voters and his political battles with Congress have worked to squelch the kind of ideological battles that have divided the Republican Party. But the Democrats\u2019 liberal wing, including lawmakers like Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, has become more restive in Mr. Obama\u2019s second term. Liberal groups have pressured the president on recent appointments to the Treasury Department and his deportation policies. At the same time, a younger generation of activists is challenging presidential candidates in both parties on issues of criminal justice, police violence and the rights of undocumented immigrants. \u201cA boldly populist,   type of platform is massively appealing to those who have come of age during the financial meltdown and the period afterward,\u201d said Kurt Walters, the campaign director at Rootstrikers, a group that favors limiting the influence of big donors in politics. The party is relatively unified on raising the minimum wage to $15, and Mrs. Clinton recently voiced qualified support. But there is a risk, some Democrats said, that Mr. Sanders  \u2014   an independent who is not actually a member of the party  \u2014   would push the party to embrace positions that could later hurt Mrs. Clinton and other Democratic candidates. Mr. Sanders is almost certain to win a   speaking slot at the summer convention, providing one of the biggest audiences yet for his views. Some Democrats said they feared a   equivalent of Pat Buchanan\u2019s searing speech at the 1992 Republican convention, when Mr. Buchanan, who had failed to win his party\u2019s nomination, called for a \u201ccultural war\u201d against \u201cliberals and radicals. \u201d Matt Bennett, a founder of the   think tank Third Way, said Mrs. Clinton had so far avoided tacking too far left to compete effectively in a general election. \u201cThey need to be careful not to go so far as to hand the Republicans something to beat them over the head with,\u201d Mr. Bennett said. \u201cBans on anything tend to be politically problematic. \u201d The campaign against Mr. Castro\u2019s policies at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, called \u201cDon\u2019t Sell Our Homes to Wall Street,\u201d could foreshadow the kind of leverage progressives would like to exert after November. Mr. Castro, one of the country\u2019s most prominent young Latino politicians, is seen as a potential   pick for Mrs. Clinton. But the pressure tactics are also likely to sow more of the bitterness that has come to dominate Mr. Sanders\u2019s primary battle with Mrs. Clinton. This month, Mr. Sanders asked his supporters to contribute money to Lucy Flores, a former Nevada assemblywoman running for Congress. In his email, Mr. Sanders also suggested that Emily\u2019s List, a political action committee that is dedicated to electing women who support abortion rights and is close to Mrs. Clinton, had spurned Ms. Flores in her race because she had endorsed Mr. Sanders. Emily\u2019s List, which has endorsed Ms. Flores in past campaigns, backed another Democratic candidate. The claim drew a sharp response from Emily\u2019s List, one of the most powerful groups in mainstream Democratic politics. \u201cWe support several candidates who have endorsed him, so he should stick to issues rather than disingenuous attacks,\u201d said Marcy Stech, a spokeswoman for Emily\u2019s List. But in an interview, Ms. Flores said she believed there was a broader agenda at play in the group\u2019s decision. \u201cIt\u2019s just like with the presidential race,\u201d Ms. Flores said. \u201cThe Democratic Party and the establishment have their ideas about who they want to support. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562192.4146335}
