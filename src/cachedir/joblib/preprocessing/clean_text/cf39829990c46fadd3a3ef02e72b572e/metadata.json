That\u2019s not to say that his replacement, Trevor Noah, hasn\u2019t done a good job, but there\u2019s nothing like watching Stewart\u2019s magical brilliance. \\nHowever, Stewart hasn\u2019t completely stayed out of election talk; after all, he appeared on The Late Show with his friend and partner in crime Stephen Colbert. On Tuesday night, Stewart left us with another comedic treat \u2013 and of course the target of his relentless mockery was GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump. \\nAt the \u201cStand Up for Heroes Benefit\u201d in New York City\u2019s Madison Square Garden, Stewart wasted no time in lighting into Trump. He began: \\n\u201cI\u2019m not as much of a political analyst. But if I could ask you a question that I\u2019ve been saying to my television, it\u2019s \u2018What the fuck? What the fuck is going on? What is happening?!'\u201d \\nStewart then went on to recall a Twitter war Trump started with him, complete with Trumpian anti-Semitic dog whistles, in which Trump called Stewart \u201cJonathan Leibowitz\u201d and said that he needs to be \u201cproud of his heritage.\u201d Of course, Stewart trolled Trump harder than Trump could ever troll him, saying: \\n\u201cSo I start to think to myself, Oh, I think this guy is trying to let people know I\u2019m a Jew. And I think to myself, doesn\u2019t my face do that? Honestly, like, where have you seen this face other than a poster for Yentl ? In what world are people like, Stewart, that\u2019s a Scottish name, but there\u2019s something about that fella that looks a little schmeary. It would be funny if it wasn\u2019t so toxically fucking crude and horrible, but. So I decide to tweet back at him, \u201cMany people don\u2019t know this, but Donald Trump\u2019s real name is Fuckface Von Clownstick. I wish you would embrace the Von Clownstick heritage.\u201d \\nThis is just TOO GOOD. Hopefully, Trump has a complete meltdown over this one; after all, we know how thin Trump\u2019s skin is, and he won\u2019t be able to resist responding. \\nWatch the magic of Stewart trolling Trump below: \\nFeatured image via Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for The Bob Woodruff Foundation Share this Article!\""}, "time": 1742561803.559677}
