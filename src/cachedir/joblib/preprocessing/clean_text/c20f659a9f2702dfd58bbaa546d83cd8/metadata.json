The comedian Bill Maher was the textbook case for the bygone era of the   universe, after ABC bought his hit show, \u201cPolitically Incorrect,\u201d away from Comedy Central. Just after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Mr. Maher said that it was wrong to refer to the hijackers as cowards, and that the United States was more cowardly for its strategy of going after enemies with cruise missiles from afar. The White House denounced him, advertisers and affiliates flipped out, and a few months later ABC cut him loose. HBO swept in to give him a   home where he continues to joke, inform and offend to this day. I headed West last week to investigate what looked to me like a   version of the Maher tale, involving something more powerful than the White House: the National Football League. In this case, our protagonist, Bill Simmons, is not a bitingly funny comedian, but a bitingly influential sportswriter and commentator, who for 14 years was one of ESPN\u2019s biggest stars. ESPN, which spends some $1. 9 billion a year for N. F. L. rights, let Mr. Simmons go last year, after he repeatedly, and colorfully, criticized Roger Goodell, the N. F. L. commissioner, over his handling of two embarrassing scandals  \u2014   the New England Patriots\u2019 alleged cheating case, known as \u201cDeflategate,\u201d and the league\u2019s lackluster domestic violence investigation of the Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice. Once again, HBO swept in, giving Mr. Simmons a new talk show about sports and pop culture called \u201cAny Given Wednesday\u201d that makes its debut on June 22. And this month Mr. Simmons introduced his new multimedia company, The Ringer, whose main site is inspired by the   sports and pop culture hub he founded at ESPN, Grantland, and features much of its main editorial team. Mr. Maher\u2019s story was about government\u2019s potential to chill free speech during war and the redemptive power of television when it is freed from advertising pressures. Mr. Simmons\u2019s situation is a bit more complicated, especially when you take ESPN\u2019s version of it into account, which I\u2019ll get to. But it does raise questions about how media conglomerates that rely on the N. F. L. for ratings and revenue handle criticism of the league as it faces deepening concerns about its culture and the health of its players. Yet, Mr. Simmons\u2019s story also offers hope that firebrands like him can find ways to operate independently at this opportune time in media. When I visited Mr. Simmons in his suite at the Sunset Gower Studios last week, he was excited for his fresh start, but still a little raw about ESPN. He had just issued a public apology to his old colleagues there for his quote in The Hollywood Reporter asking, \u201cWho would work there that you respect right now?\u201d \u201cI read it and I was like, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t feel that way, I wish I hadn\u2019t said that,\u2019\u201d Mr. Simmons said. The incident played into criticism from ESPN executives that Mr. Simmons can be petulant and disrespectful of rival colleagues. Yet it was also in keeping with the   style that ESPN hired him for. Mr. Simmons, 46, came to ESPN from AOL\u2019s Boston \u201cDigital City\u201d site, where he wrote a column called \u201cBoston\u2019s Sports Guy. \u201d In that job, he could not get press passes, he said, because, \u201cIt was the internet. They were like, \u2018What? No. \u2019\u201d So he set out to write about sports the way he was watching them, on the tube, and in the brutally honest and sometimes   language of the sports bar  \u2014   as an outsider. It meant breaking from tradition with contemporary pop culture references (if a scene from \u201c90210\u201d came to mind, he\u2019d say so) praise for players he loved, contempt for owners, players and commissioners he didn\u2019t. ESPN first noticed him after he eviscerated the company\u2019s own sports awards program, the ESPYs, which he called a \u201cTV holocaust. \u201d Over all, it was a fruitful relationship that earned him accolades and made him millions. He starred on \u201cNBA Countdown,\u201d helped to create the successful ESPN documentary series \u201c30 for 30\u201d and founded Grantland, which earned three national magazine award nominations in 2015. His podcast, \u201cThe B. S. Report,\u201d was ESPN\u2019s most popular. Yet Mr. Simmons\u2019s   feral side often broke glass inside ESPN, which blanched at some of his stunts  \u2014   a porn star in his fantasy basketball league?  \u2014   and twice banned him from using Twitter after he wrote posts criticizing colleagues. Things started falling apart after Mr. Simmons called Mr. Goodell \u201ca liar\u201d for saying the league had not known what was contained in a damning video of Mr. Rice punching his fianc\u00e9e unconscious when it initially handed Mr. Rice a light,   suspension. (The tape had been leaked to TMZ.) Mr. Simmons followed that by daring ESPN to \u201cCall me and say I\u2019m in trouble. \u201d His   suspension followed. Mr. Simmons says he now regrets the dare. But, he said, he was just fulfilling his role as a \u201cdisrupter,\u201d if an imperfect one. That was what he planned to tell Disney\u2019s chief executive, Robert A. Iger  \u2014   a proponent of disruption  \u2014   when he went to Mr. Iger\u2019s office several months after his suspension. Mr. Simmons did not get to make his point. \u201cHe was like, \u2018You know, when you go after Roger, it\u2019s really hard for us we want you to do it respectfully,\u2019\u201d Mr. Simmons said of Mr. Iger\u2019s counsel. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018I think that\u2019s fair. I can be relentless on him but I\u2019ve got to do it respectfully. \u201d\u2019 \u201cRespectfully\u201d is not what came to mind when, a few weeks later, Mr. Simmons questioned Mr. Goodell\u2019s \u201ctesticular fortitude\u201d in his handling of Deflategate. The next day, ESPN\u2019s president, John Skipper, announced that Mr. Simmons\u2019 contract would not be renewed. Mr. Simmons says he wonders if something else was at play. A few months after his ouster, Mr. Iger emerged as a champion of a proposed new stadium near Los Angeles that would have been shared by the San Diego Chargers and a relocated Oakland Raiders team  \u2014   with an option to buy a stake in either team. \u201cOne of my working theories was, maybe this was driven by Iger because he wants a team. \u201d Disney declined to comment. But when I reached out to ESPN for a response, Mr. Skipper sent me this: \u201cBill would rather spin conspiracy theories and be perceived as a martyr than take responsibility for his own actions. Let me be unequivocal and clear and take responsibility for my actions: I alone made the decision, and it had nothing to do with his comments about the commissioner. I severed our relationship with Bill because of his repeated lack of respect for this company and, more importantly, the people who work here. \u201d The network, which has beefed up its investigative reporting staff in recent years, also disputed any notion that it goes easy on the N. F. L. sending me citations for some 70 critical items about the league. And the \u201cOutside the Lines\u201d investigation of the Rice case by Don Van Natta Jr. and Kevin Van Valkenburg, which influenced Mr. Simmons by describing \u201ca pattern of misinformation and misdirection\u201d at the league, was as tough as they come. That work is definitely worth noting. But so is ESPN\u2019s decision in 2013 to withdraw from a   documentary with \u201cFrontline\u201d about the N. F. L. \u2019s \u201cconcussion crisis\u201d under pressure from the league, as my colleagues James Andrew Miller and Ken Belson reported then. (ESPN denied it was buckling to the N. F. L.) Surely, when a large part of your business rests with the most powerful sports league in the country, you\u2019re probably going to watch your p\u2019s and q\u2019s. Mr. Simmons said he came up against this when he was seeking new partners and met with Showtime\u2019s president, David Nevins, and Mr. Nevins\u2019s boss, the CBS chairman Les Moonves. \u201cI really liked Moonves, and he was totally honest,\u201d Mr. Simmons said. \u201cHe was just like, you know, this is my biggest partner\u201d  \u2014   meaning the N. F. L. \u201cI can\u2019t figure out how we would make this work. \u201d CBS had no comment. One presumes neither Mr. Moonves nor Mr. Iger would ask their news divisions to stand down from real N. F. L. reporting. And ESPN says it keeps a \u201cchurch and state\u201d wall between business and journalism. But where\u2019s the line between being \u201crespectful\u201d and being overly sparing with necessary criticism? The question is important, given the current national discussion about football and concussions. That conversation is taking place in a media environment in which the N. F. L. is that rare content producer that can deliver huge audiences for live programming, where the power of the   ad endures. Expelled from the monolith, Mr. Simmons is undergoing recovery in a media market hungry for fresh programming. \u201cI\u2019m a proven content maker at a time when it\u2019s great to be that,\u201d he said. Mr. Simmons says he will cover a range of topics, including football, when he joins the same program lineup as Mr. Maher on HBO  \u2014   a network with no commercials, no boundaries and no slate of N. F. L. games.'"}, "time": 1742564380.9610794}
