From meeting the US president to his first day of nursery school, but none of these moments made him smile more than yesterday\u2019s Halloween festivities, when he finally got to wear his favourite costume accessory \u2013 a necklace of human ears. \\n\u201cHe has been asking us all year if he could wear them,\u201d Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton told press reporters yesterday afternoon, \u201cGeorge really, really likes Halloween. It\u2019s actually scary how much he likes the whole thing. Myself and William were woken up at 4am this morning to a dead bird at the end of our bed. He means well, and I\u2019m sure he thought it was a nice present to give, but I\u2019ll be glad when Halloween is over\u201d. \\nLittle is known about the owners of the ears, but sources believe they were a present from his great granddad, Philip, and were originally gifted to the 95-year-old from a tribe of New Guinea cannibals in 1946. \\n\u201cGeorge loves searching through great granddad\u2019s old memorabilia,\u201d Royal nanny Maria Cantwell explains, \u201cWhen he found the necklace, his little eyes lit up. \\n\u201cThey\u2019re very close and he loves listening to Philip\u2019s stories about the Nazis and the Bengal famine in India. They\u2019re like the same person inside\u201d. \\nLater asked by reporters what he wants from Santa for Christmas, the little dote replied \u2018Putin\u2019, clapping manically and repeating the Russian president\u2019s name, over and over again, before then chomping down on one of his ears. \\n\u201cHe\u2019s teething,\u201d insisted the red faced Duchess as she quickly ushered him away.'"}, "time": 1742562668.437677}
