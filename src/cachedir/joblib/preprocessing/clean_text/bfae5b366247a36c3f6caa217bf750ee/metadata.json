The award was presented by Mel Gibson. Mr. Loach, a previous winner for \u201cThe Wind That Shakes the Barley,\u201d accepted his prize first in French before switching to English. \u201cWe\u2019re in the grip of a project of austerity,\u201d he said, invoking the \u201ccatastrophe\u201d of neoliberalism. He talked of cinema\u2019s tradition of speaking to the \u201cpowerful and the mighty\u201d and the need to show that \u201canother world is possible and necessary. \u201d This year\u2019s jury for the feature competition was led by George Miller (here in 2015 with \u201cMad Max: Fury Road\u201d) who lauded \u201cthe feast of cinema,\u201d and also included the directors Arnaud Desplechin and Laszlo Nemes (his \u201cSon of Saul\u201d won the Grand Prize last year) a producer, Katayoon Shahabi and a clutch of internationally recognizable names: Kirsten Dunst, Valeria Golino, Mads Mikkelsen, Vanessa Paradis and Donald Sutherland. The ceremony included a brief tribute to   L\u00e9aud, the screen immortal who played Antoine Doinel for Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, beginning with \u201cThe 400 Blows\u201d Mr. L\u00e9aud received an honorary Palme d\u2019Or presented by a visibly moved Mr. Desplechin. The best actor award went to Shahab Hosseini, one of the stars of the Iranian movie \u201cForushande\u201d (\u201cThe Salesman\u201d) from the director Asghar Farhadi. This smooth, schematic drama turns on a married couple who are performing in a production of Arthur Miller\u2019s \u201cDeath of a Salesman\u201d and whose lives are upended when the wife is attacked. Mr. Farhadi also won for best screenplay. The best actress prize was given to Jaclyn Jose, the star of \u201c\u2018Ma\u2019 Rosa,\u201d a slice of naturalism from the Philippine director Brillante Mendoza. Ms. Jose plays a tough,   drug dealer who peddles dope out of her small Manila store and, with her addict husband, is swept up in police corruption. The best director prize was, surprisingly, split between the Romanian director Cristian Mungiu, for \u201cGraduation,\u201d and to the French director Olivier Assayas, for \u201cPersonal Shopper. \u201d The Jury Prize (effectively third place) went to \u201cAmerican Honey,\u201d from the British director Andrea Arnold. \u201cWhen I\u2019m happy, I want to dance,\u201d Ms. Arnold said, swaying to the accompanying music. The Canadian filmmaker Xavier Dolan won the Grand Prix, second only to the Palme d\u2019Or, for \u201cIt\u2019s Only the End of the World,\u201d a decision booed by the press, who watched the ceremony in a live feed from a theater in the same building. \u201cThank you for feeling the emotion of the film,\u201d Mr. Dolan said, choking up as booing continued from critics across the hallway. \u201cThe Happiest Day in the Life of Olli Maki,\u201d a    movie about a boxer, from the Finnish director Juho Kuosmanen, was awarded the prize for Un Certain Regard, a section reserved for younger and sometimes more adventurous filmmakers. The Cam\u00e9ra d\u2019Or, for best first feature, went to \u201cDivines,\u201d from the French director Houda Benyamina it screened in La Quinzaine des Realisateurs, a program that runs parallel with the official selection. The Palme for the best short film was presented to \u201cTimecode,\u201d from the Spanish director Juanjo Gim\u00e9nez. Information about other winners is at www. .   .'"}, "time": 1742564550.9342132}
