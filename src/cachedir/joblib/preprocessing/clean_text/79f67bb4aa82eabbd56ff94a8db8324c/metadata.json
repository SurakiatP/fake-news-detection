[Contracts obtained by the Post show that the federal government had a contract with   PR firm Weber Shandwick, where the government paid the firm $74. 15 million on July 28, 2016, and an additional $3. 69 million on September 9, 2016, to promote the plan.  Of that money, $64 million went to radio, television, and digital  $4 million went to creative development and production $5 million to direct response marketing $2 million to campaign strategy $1 million to branding and $1. 5 million to encourage small business enrollment. An official from the Trump administration dismissed the efforts of the Obama administration to make a   effort to boost enrollment. \u201cTens of millions in   taxpayer funds spent on TV ads won\u2019t sell a fundamentally flawed approach to health care,\u201d the official told the Post. Pam Jenkins, president of Weber Shandwick, signed the contract. Obama selected the firm\u2019s chairman, Jack Leslie, to be chairman of the U. S. African Development Foundation. Leslie donated $1, 000 to former President Barack Obama\u2019s 2012   campaign and $2, 700 to Hillary Clinton\u2019s failed presidential bid. On Monday, President Trump met with nine people who have suffered from the healthcare law\u2019s high costs, telling them that he would put in its place a better plan that would \u201clower costs\u201d and \u201cexpand choice. \u201d Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said Sunday that \u201cnobody would be worse off financially\u201d if Republicans in Congress made an effort to repeal and replace Obamacare with the House replacement plan.'"}, "time": 1742563968.894782}
