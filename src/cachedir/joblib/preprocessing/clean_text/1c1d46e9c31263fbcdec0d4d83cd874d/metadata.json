[From Bloomberg:  In a bid to expand its influence in the era of Donald Trump, Breitbart News, the crusading   website that was an early champion of the incoming president, has hired veteran financial journalist John Carney of The Wall Street Journal to lead a new finance and economics section set to launch soon after the Jan. 20th presidential inauguration.  \u201cBreitbart was way ahead of the curve on politics and the rise of Trump,\u201d Carney said in a telephone interview. \u201cI think there\u2019s an opportunity to do that for business, finance and economic news. \u201d In his new role, Carney will manage a roster of news contributors that includes former CNBC personality Larry Kudlow.   \u2026     \u201cThere simply isn\u2019t a better person in media to lead the economics section of an anti establishment,   global news outlet,\u201d Larry Solov, chief executive of Breitbart News Network, said in a statement. Carney, a former attorney and veteran of CNBC and Business Insider, writes about finance with a populist bent that often mirrors Breitbart\u2019s outlook on politics. \u201cWe\u2019re going to both break news and provide analysis and commentary as it happens,\u201d he says. While Carney describes the site\u2019s new contributors as having a variety of ideological backgrounds, he says all have become \u201cconverts to the cause of economic nationalism and populism. \u201d Read the rest of the story here.'"}, "time": 1742628505.7569695}
