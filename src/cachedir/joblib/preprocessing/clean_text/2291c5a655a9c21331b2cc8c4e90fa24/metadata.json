Takata pleaded guilty to charges stemming from its handling of defective airbags, and will pay $1 billion in penalties. Three of its executives face criminal charges.

Chelsea Manning is asking Mr. Obama to commute her sentence before he leaves office next week. Ms. Manning, who was an Army intelligence analyst known as Bradley Manning when she disclosed archives of secret military and diplomatic files to WikiLeaks in 2010, is serving a   sentence.

Finally, we bring you the back story of the iconic image of Marilyn Monroe\u2019s white dress fluttering up as she stands over a subway grate in \u201cThe Seven Year Itch. \u201d What made it into the movie was actually a reshoot of a discarded and more risqu\u00e9 scene filmed on the Upper East Side in the summer of 1954. The discarded version happened to also be captured on   film by an amateur filmmaker who lived nearby.
