Shear, a White House correspondent for The Times, discussed the tech he\u2019s using. As a White House reporter, you must be bombarded with news about the Trump administration. What\u2019s your favorite tech tool for staying on top of your beat? When a president routinely makes policy pronouncements in 140 characters, there\u2019s no more important tool than Twitter for a White House reporter. But President Trump and his aides also appear on television throughout the day, often with little notice and without being streamed on whitehouse. gov. So, I\u2019ve recently loaded up Sling TV on all my devices (also, my family just cut the cable cord). Now, no matter where I am  \u2014   at my desk, at a restaurant, or in a van waiting for POTUS to play a round of golf  \u2014   I have access to cable news reports and live streams from the White House. What do you like about the setup, and what could be better about it? I like the fact that Sling TV works just about everywhere. There are apps for my iPhone 7 and my iPad Air, as well as my MacBook Pro and the Apple TVs and Rokus I have at home. The apps load quickly and even work behind the firewall at work.\u2019 \u201dI do have a few gripes. For now, you can\u2019t pause most shows on Sling TV, and there\u2019s no recording of shows. (The company has a DVR beta in the works, but I haven\u2019t been able to get in.) And there are often hiccups. The audio and video are often, frustratingly, out of sync, especially for MSNBC and NBC. And there are times that the channels say \u201cunavailable\u201d for a few seconds, or a few minutes, with no explanation. Also, because of licensing issues, I can get NBC and Fox, but not ABC or CBS.\u201d \u2019As a political reporter, how do you keep messages, contacts and phone calls secure from surveillance?\u2019 \u201dI\u2019ve always been pretty careful about electronic security. I have   authentication turned on for all of my accounts  \u2014   email, iCloud, etc. And I\u2019m as careful as I can be to avoid being trapped by a phishing scam. I rarely click on any link from an email, and I\u2019m pretty aggressive about sending emails that I don\u2019t recognize to spam.\u201d \u2019In the wake of the hacking episodes involving the Democratic National Committee, officials in Washington have become more careful (paranoid?) about their communications, which has affected the way reporters do business. Many of the people I communicate with now routinely ask to discuss issues with secure texting apps such as Signal or Confide. Others still use iMessage or WhatsApp. A few have said they want to have voice communications only over secure voice apps. How do you keep on top of President Trump\u2019s Twitter? Having covered the White House since the beginning of 2009, I\u2019m definitely having to adjust to a new rhythm. I have about a dozen Twitter accounts set to alert me to every tweet, including the @POTUS and @RealDonaldTrump accounts, as well as the president\u2019s senior staff like @Presssec (Sean Spicer) @KellyannePolls and others. I had to adjust my Do Not Disturb settings on my iPhone so that notifications resume earlier  \u2014   at 5:30 a. m. now. (There are overnight editors who can call me if he tweets between midnight and 5:30 a. m.) I also make extensive use of my Apple Watch to keep tabs on the president\u2019s Twitter habit throughout the day. I generally keep the speaker on mute, but the watch\u2019s haptic engine taps my wrist anytime he or his aides tweet. Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life? My mother sent me a check for my birthday and, on a lark, I bought a Google Home. The     is in my kitchen and I\u2019m hoping that it becomes a new tool that everyone in my family  \u2014   including my wife and two teenagers  \u2014   find useful. So far, I use it as a timer when I cook. I find it much easier to simply say \u201cHey, Google, set a timer for 30 minutes\u201d than to use the   timer on my oven. We also have fun using Google Home for our grocery shopping list. Throughout the week, as we notice things we need at the store, any of us can say, \u201cHey Google, add orange juice to the shopping list. \u201d It\u2019s eerily accurate, even on stranger items. The list is automatically compiled in a Google Keep note that all of us have access to. (I will admit that my    daughter is having fun putting weird items on the list to surprise me when I go to the grocery.) What could be better about it? The problem with Google Home  \u2014   and the reason it often sits, neglected, on the counter  \u2014   is that it just doesn\u2019t do that much. It can\u2019t send emails or text (yet). It can do some limited shopping, but isn\u2019t connected (for obvious competitive reasons) to our Amazon shopping account. It can\u2019t (yet) be used as a convenient speakerphone. The news sources that it accesses are limited (no New York Times headlines read aloud). And there is one, serious limitation that has to be fixed for Google Home to be really useful in a home with more than one person: It needs individual profiles. It has a nice feature that reads out the appointments for your day, but it links to only one calendar. That means only one of us can use the feature. The internet is flooded with fake news. What\u2019s your advice for readers for distinguishing good information from bad information? First, read The New York Times. But more broadly, I guess my advice would be to constantly crosscheck what you see and hear on the internet. If you read a   allegation in a Facebook post or a tweet, or on a   internet site, try to see whether that allegation is also being reported by The Washington Post or Fox News. Go to the   at various news organizations. Look around on Twitter to see whether the allegation has been debunked. If it sounds like something is \u201ctoo good to check,\u201d it probably means it\u2019s not real. But check it anyway!'"}, "time": 1742563973.6726074}
