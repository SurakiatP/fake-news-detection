Let\u2019s turn it over to Brooks Barnes, our Hollywood reporter based in Los Angeles, for today\u2019s introduction: You could hear a collective gasp in Hollywood on Tuesday morning, as the show business capital awakened to word from its town crier, TMZ, that Angelina Jolie had filed for divorce from Brad Pitt. There was an     feeling to it: As a couple, Ms. Jolie and Mr. Pitt were perhaps most important to Hollywood as a marketing tool, \u201cproof that   movie star glamour and storybook romance had not yet faded away entirely,\u201d said Janice Min, chief creative officer of The Hollywood   Media Group. And then most of moviedom went normally about its day. Contrary to the East Coast stereotype, Hollywood is not a place where people lounge around under palm trees. There are meetings to attend, numbers to crunch, emails to answer. Just like in the rest of America. Divorce fallout speculation was largely confined to the machinery that pumped out that imagery of Ms. Jolie and Mr. Pitt as   epitomized: \u201cExtra,\u201d \u201cEntertainment Tonight,\u201d People magazine and other celebrity news outlets. Lisa Gregorisch, the senior executive producer for \u201cExtra,\u201d said that her team in Burbank was finishing a regularly scheduled 6:30 a. m. meeting when the news started to break. \u201cWe turned on a dime, with literally every single person here, 140 people, working an angle,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat went wrong. Their past loves. The kids. The custody. Angelina\u2019s health. The social media response. \u201d There are also the questions of their precise worth  \u2014   hundreds of millions, at least  \u2014   and whether a prenuptial agreement governs the dividing of assets. Ms. Gregorisch had been planning an Emmy Awards   for her Tuesday night show. Not anymore. \u201cExtra\u201d devoted   coverage to the divorce. The main challenge, she said, was \u201cwalking a fine line in terms of respect for them in a painful time and the interests of our viewers. \u201d On the print side, Jess Cagle, editor in chief of People magazine, was scrambling on Tuesday to figure out how to race out a new cover. (The publication typically closes its weekly issue on Monday nights.) For People, which has landed numerous \u201cBrangelina\u201d scoops over the years, the divorce story \u201cis absolutely one of the biggest\u201d of the past couple of years, Mr. Cagle said in an email. \u201cOn a    scale,\u201d he said, \u201cthis is approximately 17. \u201d \u2022 Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts assailed the chief executive of San   Wells Fargo over a fraud scandal: \u201cYou should resign. \u201d [The New York Times] \u2022 Sacramento lawmakers are collecting thousands of dollars in per diems even when absent.

[Voice of San Diego] \u2022 San Diego has become a destination for \u201cstem cell tourism\u201d as companies send patients across the border for treatments. [KPBS] \u2022 Curtis Hanson, the director of \u201cL. A. Confidential,\u201d died in Los Angeles. He was 71.

[Los Angeles Times] \u2022 Oakland\u2019s housing crisis is displacing the city\u2019s arts and music counterculture. [East Bay Express] \u2022 Colin Kaepernick said he has received death threats, but he\u2019s \u201cnot too concerned about it. \u201d [The Mercury News] \u2022 The plight of a tiny California pension fund illuminates a debate sweeping the country\u2019s public pension system. [The New York Times] \u2022 California accounts for a fifth of all public companies on the major American markets, data show.

[NASA] \u2022 When a New Yorker comes to Los Angeles: Culture shock in small talk and ripe avocados. [New Yorker] San Francisco hit fall overflow this week with the unofficial start of the tech company conference season. The companies that sell ideas about virtual life, cloud computing and telecommuting bring in thousands of customers each year for valuable    meetings. Over the weekend, Oracle Corporation shut off several blocks of downtown as part of its   OpenWorld conference. While traffic backs up and reroutes, the   area called Oracle Cloud Plaza served organic food (and, throughout the   event, an estimated three million cups of coffee). It\u2019s a huge boon to the hotel business: On Monday, a Hampton Inn in the Soma neighborhood had a couple of rooms left for Tuesday night at $479 a night. Those prices will come back down to $179 when conference season ends in late October. That is after the Salesforce conference, which the company says now has 170, 000 people registered. The Opal, a 2.  hotel on Orbitz, has two rooms left at $570 a night.  \u2014   Quentin Hardy, deputy technology editor for The New York Times, based in San Francisco California Today goes live at 6 a. m.
