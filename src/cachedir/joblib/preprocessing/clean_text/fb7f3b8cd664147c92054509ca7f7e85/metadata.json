He dared to use the word \u201cman,\u201d instead of \u201chumankind. \u201d  \u201cThoughtful paper, although the   errors are killing you,\u201d Professor Jack Davis wrote at the bottom of the paper. Davis claimed that the exercise is \u201cnot to enforce political correctness\u201d but rather serves as \u201cboth a grammar refresher and a style and user guide. \u201d He also claimed that students would only lose points when they violate two or more \u201c \u201d guidelines, meaning that just the singular usage of \u201cman\u201d was not enough for Poirier to have his grade marked down. \u201cI do not lower a student\u2019s grade for only one inconsistency, and I single out no student as an example,\u201d Davis said. Poirier claims that Professor Davis\u2019 class is \u201ccertainly biased,\u201d but that he believes \u201cDavis is rather moderate compared to his peers and formulated the   rule in order to be \u2018by the books. \u2019\u201d \u201cIt is on those grammarians who, like the rest of the academy, have eagerly stoked the slide towards gender [and] social anarchy,\u201d Poirier claimed. \u201cPolitical correctness on college campuses goes far deeper than this one excess by this one teacher. By and large, the radical liberationist ideas go unchallenged because no truly oppositional content is presented,\u201d he added.
