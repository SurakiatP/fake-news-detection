[Last month, as Breitbart News reported, President Trump gave his strong support to L. A.\u2019s Olympic bid after meeting with the International Olympic Committee: \u201cI would love to see the Olympics go to Los Angeles. I think that it\u2019ll be terrific. The United States committee\u2019s members have asked me to speak up about it, and I have, and I think I\u2019ve helped them, and let\u2019s see what happens. \u201d  In contrast, Sykes said, President Obama had been noncommittal, following his lackluster role in Chicago\u2019s failed bid to host the 2016 games. \u201cHe [Obama] never went to an Olympic games, never met with the IOC [International Olympic Committee] leadership, never talked to them by phone, and showed sort of a disregard and that was deeply frustrating to the leaders of the IOC,\u201d Sykes told KPCC. Sykes also acknowledged that Trump\u2019s role was a \u201c  sword,\u201d given global opposition to some of his policies, as well as bad media coverage. In February, former L. A. mayor (and 2018 gubernatorial candidate) Antonio Villaraigosa worried openly that Trump\u2019s immigration policies would hurt the city\u2019s Olympic bid. 2024 would mark the 40th anniversary of the highly successful 1984 Summer Olympics, dominated for Americans by memories of Carl Lewis\u2019s    sweep (and only somewhat marred by a Soviet bloc boycott). The other contender to host the 2024 games is Paris. The vote is scheduled for September. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.
