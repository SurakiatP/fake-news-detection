He worked out on the elliptical, wiping it down when he was done. Then one day Shaun Yeary, a salesman at a landscape supply company, asked him in the locker room what he did for a living. \u201cI used to be a priest,\u201d Joe recalled telling him. \u201cAnd now,\u201d he said, his voice growing quieter so as not to scare anyone in earshot, \u201cI\u2019m the archbishop of Indianapolis. \u201d \u201cI was like, for real?\u201d Mr. Yeary recalled. \u201cThis guy is benching two and a quarter!\u201d  \u2014   gymspeak for 225 pounds. Joe, also known as Cardinal Joseph W. Tobin, recently became one of the 120 men in the world who will choose the next pope. But he wants to be judged by his actions, not his lofty position in the Roman Catholic Church. Though he has led the Archdiocese of Indianapolis since 2012, a status that usually comes with perks like a driver, he drives himself around in a Chevy Tahoe and helps with the dishes after lunch meetings. He introduces himself simply as Padre Jos\u00e9 to the children at a local Catholic school. He showers and shaves at the Community Healthplex gym like any other member, and calls his workout buddies his Band of Brothers. In short, he is just the kind of leader Pope Francis is elevating to realign the church in the United States with his priorities. As the pope has made clear over the past three years, fancy lifestyles, formality and regal titles like Prince of the Church are out of style for cardinals. So is an emphasis on the divisive issues of abortion and   marriage, even though the church\u2019s underlying position on those issues has not changed. Instead, in the pope\u2019s view, the church should emphasize humility and service to the poor. It should be multicultural, welcoming different styles of worship. It should reach out to other faiths and stand up for immigrants, refugees and nuns. And that, church experts and members of his flock say, is a close description of the priorities of Cardinal Tobin, who will be heading east just after Christmas to lead the approximately 1. 5 million Catholics in the Archdiocese of Newark. He is replacing Archbishop John J. Myers, 75, who preferred to be addressed by the formal title Your Grace, and who achieved notoriety when the church spent some $500, 000 to outfit the house he will retire to with an indoor exercise pool and an elevator. Cardinal Tobin\u2019s appointment in October as one of the nation\u2019s 18 cardinals came as a surprise to many, including the man himself. But perhaps it should not have. For what his unassuming bearing does not reveal is that he is no stranger to the corridors of power in the church. He is a friend of Pope Francis. And under Francis\u2019 predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, he had helped lead the Vatican office that oversees the roughly one million men and women in religious orders around the world. That position did not end so well. It was an open secret that Cardinal Tobin was sent to Indiana as a kind of exile most likely because he questioned an inquiry by his office into supposed doctrinal lapses among the roughly 50, 000 nuns in the United States. As he got to know the faithful in the chancery of Indianapolis, he would joke with them about it. \u201cI was kicked out and I\u2019m grateful for it,\u201d the chancellor of the archdiocese, Annette Lentz, recalled his saying about how he turned up on her doorstep. And she would tell him, \u201cTheir loss is our gain. \u201d How Cardinal Tobin, 64, an amiable      who likes Bob Seger, plays piano and speaks five languages, went from being the oldest of 13 children living in Detroit to the pinnacle of the global church is a story that bears telling. He grew up in a   neighborhood where the big houses were perfect for the large families of Irish, Polish and other Eastern European backgrounds that filled them. The local parish, Holy Redeemer, was run by an order of priests called the Redemptorists, and was unusually large, with 14 Masses each Sunday for up to 20, 000 worshipers, he recalled in a Dec. 5 interview. His mother was a   teacher who quit her job to raise her brood nine of her cousins and three of her aunts were nuns. Growing up in a deeply Catholic environment, Cardinal Tobin had two role models: the parish priests and his father, a cost analyst at General Motors who attended 6 a. m. Mass daily. Joe Tobin was a    child, who once crashed through the   window when he was being chased. But he also learned the deeper lessons taught by the nuns at the parish school. \u201cJoe came home in second grade and said to me, \u2018Mom, I need a pair of socks,\u2019\u201d his mother, Marie Tobin, 93, recalled before Cardinal Tobin\u2019s emotional farewell Mass in Indianapolis on Dec. 3. \u201cAnd I looked at his feet and saw his socks were fine. \u2018Mother,\u2019 he said, \u2018there\u2019s a boy in my class who has rags around his feet and a safety pin. \u2019\u201d In 1977, when the cardinal was in seminary in Esopus, N. Y. his father died of a heart attack. By that time, the family had moved across the border to Canada, and his father had been commuting to Michigan. \u201cI idolized my dad,\u201d Cardinal Tobin said. \u201cHe was everything I think a man should be. He was strong, he played in the Orange Bowl as a freshman in Boston College. He lost his leg in World War II, so he never played football again. He had a quiet, unpretentious faith. He was chivalrous with women. \u201cAnd I remember when he died,\u201d he added, \u201cand I was waiting at the seminary for someone to drive me to La Guardia, and one of my teachers came and said, \u2018If you can be a man like your father, when they call you Father you will be all right.\u2019 And I suppose I am still trying to do that. \u201d He remains close with his siblings. And in the Redemptorists, an order that requires a vow of poverty and emphasizes missionary outreach, he found a second family. He dreamed of being sent to   locales once he was ordained in 1978. Instead, because he spoke Spanish, he was sent right back to Holy Redeemer, which had a growing Hispanic population. There, he learned about serving the poor. An older priest modeled what was to become a signature of Cardinal Tobin\u2019s ministry: an intense focus on each person. \u201cWhen he is there and you are talking to him, it\u2019s as if you have known him all your life,\u201d said Bernice Guynn, 89, a parishioner at St. Rita in Indianapolis. From Detroit, he was moved during the AIDS epidemic to Chicago, where he ministered at the bedsides of the dying. The church\u2019s stance against homosexuality was not a barrier to him. \u201cIt\u2019s important to be there for people,\u201d he said. By 1991, the   of his order had taken notice and he was moved to Rome. For 12 years, he led the Redemptorist order, finally traveling the world to missions in more than 70 nations. In that capacity, he made an impression on Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, then the Vatican official responsible for enforcing Catholic doctrine. In 2010, five years after Cardinal Ratzinger became Pope Benedict, he offered Father Tobin the title of archbishop and the position of secretary of the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life in the Vatican. Cardinal Tobin recalled that he was painting his mother\u2019s porch in Ontario when he got the call from the Vatican secretary of state. \u201cI turned white and started stuttering,\u201d he said. He did not want the job, he said, but how does one refuse the pope? The office he had been tapped to administer was investigating American nuns for supposedly adopting a \u201csecular mentality\u201d and straying from Catholic orthodoxy. In other words, the nuns were accused of being too liberal, and Cardinal Tobin was to oversee the inquiry. But he had an \u201cextremely positive\u201d view of the nuns, he told The National Catholic Reporter at the time, and he wanted to explain their good works. \u201cMy first job, I thought, was to ask, \u2018What were people trying to accomplish with this? \u2019\u201d he said this month. But the problem, he came to believe, was structural: the investigation of 55, 000 religious women by a tiny staff for the alleged errors of a few. \u201cIt made as much sense as an ophthalmologist trying to do cataract surgery standing in center field in Yankee Stadium and pointing his laser gun up at the bleachers,\u201d he said. Two years into his   term, his priest secretary surprised him with the news. \u201cWe are so sorry you are going,\u201d Cardinal Tobin recalled him saying. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Really, where am I going?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Indianapolis. \u2019\u201d The official news did not come for four months. \u201cIt was like death by 1, 000 cuts,\u201d he said. When he arrived in Indiana in December 2012, most American Catholics had never heard of him. But to the nuns he was something of a hero. \u201cWe thought that he was a tremendous individual,\u201d said Mother Anne Brackmann, the prioress of the Carmelite Monastery in Terre Haute, Ind. \u201cAnd he was welcomed very, very warmly. \u201d Someone else took note of his dismissal: Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio of Buenos Aires, who would become Pope Francis. The two men met in 2005 during a synod of bishops in Rome, and they bonded over a shared view of the church. There were conservative bishops in their group who wanted, for example, to ban girls from being altar servers. \u201cI have eight sisters, and at the time, I had nieces who were serving at the altar, and I didn\u2019t see the justification for it,\u201d Cardinal Tobin said. \u201cBergoglio was on the same page. There are more important things to talk about. \u201d They had also laughed together: Cardinal Tobin recalled telling Cardinal Bergoglio that he had been his mother\u2019s choice for pope that year, because she had read how he picked up after himself and cooked his own food. Still, Cardinal Tobin was surprised to get a note from Cardinal Bergoglio in 2010 wishing him luck in his Vatican position. \u201cHe said: \u2018I remember our time together, I remember our conversations, and I remember your mother\u2019s good taste. I\u2019m praying for you. \u2019\u201d By the time Cardinal Tobin came to the Vatican in 2013 to receive his pallium  \u2014   the cowl that would mark his status as the archbishop of Indianapolis  \u2014   Pope Francis had been elected. He was not sure the new pope would remember him. But Francis again surprised him. \u201cI\u2019ve been praying intensely for you since I heard what happened,\u201d Cardinal Tobin said the pope had told him. What happened next was a kind of rehabilitation. Francis appointed him to the oversight committee of the same Vatican office he had been removed from. Then, in October, came the announcement: The pope was naming him a cardinal. He would be the youngest one in the United States. Cardinal Tobin was shocked. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like you are sleeping in class and all of a sudden the spotlight is on you,\u201d he said. At a news conference last month in Newark, he put it this way: \u201cSometimes I think Pope Francis sees a lot more in me than I see in myself. \u201d Cardinal Tobin said he loved his time in Indianapolis, where he visited parishes in 39 counties, ministered to prisoners on death row and baptized about 1, 000 new Catholics each Easter. He was up by 4 many mornings to pray before arriving at the gym by 5:30. With the help of a trainer, Shane Moat, he learned how to deadlift 425 pounds. \u201cBig breath, explode, keep it close,\u201d Mr. Moat coached him earlier this month. Cardinal Tobin strained and hoisted the weight to his waist. \u201cYou the man!\u201d someone shouted. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d Cardinal Tobin said after dropping the weight with a bang. That morning, Mr. Yeary, the salesman, presented him with a goodbye gift: a framed photo of the cardinal with his seven workout buddies, whose ages range from 27 to over 70. \u201cOh, man, that\u2019s wonderful, thank you,\u201d the cardinal said. Then he reverted to his lighthearted tone: \u201cNone of those Sopranos are going to mess with me. This is my crew. \u201d Cardinal Tobin has had a hard time saying goodbye. He choked up at his farewell Mass and had only one request of the congregation that had packed the cathedral: Pray for him. But his admirers here and elsewhere are hoping that Cardinal Tobin will become a more public voice for Pope Francis and his priorities. He has already done that once, in a showdown with Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, a Republican who is now the vice   over welcoming Syrian refugees. In November 2015, Mr. Pence announced that he would suspend Syrian refugee resettlement programs, citing security fears. Cardinal Tobin felt that was not only illegal, but also immoral. He met with Mr. Pence, discussed his objections and told him he would continue the Catholic Charities resettlement program. A federal court has since overturned the governor\u2019s directive. In an email, Mr. Pence said, \u201cCardinal Tobin is a personal friend, and I deeply respect his commitment to his faith and his ministry. \u201d While Cardinal Tobin did not tell anyone whom to vote for in the presidential election, he said he was disturbed by appeals to fear during the campaign of Donald J. Trump, particularly his views of refugees and immigrants. Mr. Trump, he said, \u201cwas appealing to the dark side of the divisive forces, to the unredeemed part of us. \u201d And while the cardinal believes American democracy will ultimately resist such appeals, \u201cyou can\u2019t be too Pollyannish about things. \u201d In Newark, he said, his first job after his installation on Jan. 6 will be to listen. Encompassing Bergen, Essex, Hudson and Union Counties in northern New Jersey, the archdiocese has pockets of great wealth and poverty, and an array of immigrants so diverse that Mass each Sunday is celebrated in 20 languages. About 30 percent of the parishioners are Hispanic. It is also a community in need of healing. In July, citing the failure of the archdiocese to effectively remove priests accused of sexual abuse from contact with children, the editorial board of The   of Newark called the departure of Archbishop Myers a \u201ctrue blessing. \u201d \u201cDuring his   tenure as New Jersey\u2019s   Catholic, he protected pedophile priests,\u201d the board said. \u201cHe urged his flock to vote based on two issues  \u2014   abortion and gay marriage  \u2014   at the threat of being denied Holy Communion. \u201d Jim Goodness, the spokesman for the archdiocese, denied those allegations, saying that Archbishop Myers had permanently removed from ministry some 20 abusive priests and that he had \u201cnever threatened to deny Communion to anyone. \u201d Cardinal Tobin will bring a different message. One of his priorities, he said, would be to ensure that the archdiocese is fully compliant with church and criminal protocols on handling sexual abuse allegations. At the Vatican in the late 1990s, the cardinal recalled, it was difficult to convince people that the abuse issue was serious. \u201cI think they just believed it was an American problem,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t want to make it like I was a great crusader over there, but I did take it seriously. \u201d He later led an effort to establish protocols for abuse claims in his order. Yet the most outspoken American victims group, the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests, said that Cardinal Tobin, like the church as a whole, must do more, such as posting the names of all credibly accused priests online. \u201cCertainly there are worse bishops, but that fact should comfort no one,\u201d David Clohessy, the organization\u2019s national director, said. Cardinal Tobin assumes his role in an uneasy time. He said that he hoped to lead with joy and transparency, and that he intended to encourage dialogue to bridge divisions. But he would go further if he believed that policies ran counter to the moral values that Jesus taught. On the threats by   Trump to carry out mass deportations of illegal immigrants, for example, Cardinal Tobin was clear. He recalled how Pope John XXIII, before he became pope, issued false baptismal certificates to help Jews escape the Nazis in World War II. \u201cWe have to resist,\u201d he said. \u201cWith public statements, and then, you do what you got to do. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562080.5438175}
