Over the past four months, Marcus Willis, a    from Slough, England, has starred in a   version of the film, all but   its implausible plot points on the way to his unlikely spot in the Wimbledon main draw, scheduled to begin Monday. Willis, ranked 775th before the qualifying tournament, had nearly given up on his dreams of reaching Wimbledon and was planning to move to Philadelphia, where offers of coaching jobs were waiting. \u201cI was adamant I was going to go to America to coach,\u201d Willis said. \u201cI had called up someone about the visa  \u2014   and then I met a girl. She basically told me I was an idiot and that I should keep going, and I\u2019m very grateful for that. \u201d Shortly before he had planned to leave in February, Willis met Jennifer Bate, a dentist and a mother of two. Bate said she was out on the town with a cousin as each tried to shake off \u201cwrong relationships\u201d that had just ended. \u201cWe just met, and honestly, it was a blur after that,\u201d Bate said. \u201cWe went on a little walk to get some fresh air before we\u2019d get a cab. He said, \u2018I\u2019m meant to be going to America soon,\u2019 and I was like: \u2018What? You can\u2019t go to America.\u2019 The night we met, I said, \u2018You\u2019ve just met me you can\u2019t just move to America.\u2019 I said it jokingly, and then he told me he was a tennis player. I thought, \u2018Yeah, right, whatever.\u2019 \u201d After experiencing what she called \u201clove at first sight,\u201d Bate rushed home to tell her mother she had met \u201cthe one,\u201d and Willis postponed his plans to leave England. With Bate\u2019s encouragement, Willis rededicated himself to tennis, despite having endured injuries and financial hardships in recent years. In 2014, struggling with touring expenses, Willis had started a crowdfunding campaign seeking support in getting to his \u201cchildhood dream\u201d tournament. In 2016, he had played only one event, a January tournament in Tunisia at the lowest rung of sanctioned professional tennis, earning just $356. But his falling ATP ranking was just high enough to get him the last direct entry into a Wimbledon qualifying   playoffs for British players. Once there, he won three matches to reach the tournament\u2019s main qualifying event. Though British wild cards often prove to be overmatched cannon fodder in the qualifying tournament, Willis played with confidence. In his first match, against the   Yuichi Sugita, Willis came back from losing the first set,   to notch his first career victory over a   opponent. With his unorthodox   barrage of chunked slices and    Willis continued his winning ways in the next two matches, beating the Russians Andrey Rublev and Daniil Medvedev and becoming the first British player to reach the Wimbledon singles main draw through qualifying since 2008. By doing so, he guaranteed himself prize money of at least 30, 000 British pounds. Andy Murray, who ended 77 years without a British men\u2019s singles champion at Wimbledon when he won here in 2013, had practiced with Willis at the Davis Cup years earlier and called Willis\u2019s qualifying a \u201creally cool story. \u201d \u201cHe\u2019s an awkward player, has got quite a different sort of game style,\u201d Murray said. \u201c   a little bit. He\u2019s got really good touch, good volleys, puts a lot of slice on his slice backhand, quite a spinny forehand. He\u2019s quite an unusual player. \u201d Those unnerving, unconventional weapons were on display when Willis made his previous best career run, to the quarterfinals of a   tournament in Knoxville, Tenn. in 2014. There, Willis also gained notice for his tubby physique, which inspired one Facebook heckler to call him Cartman, after Eric Cartman, the corpulent cartoon    from \u201cSouth Park. \u201d Willis embraced the nickname, and while he is still bulkier than many in the sport, he has dropped 55 pounds. He still readily pokes fun at himself. \u201cIt\u2019s good banter I enjoy it,\u201d he said. If he wins his   match Monday against the   Ricardas Berankis on Court 17, a possible   encounter with the   champion Roger Federer looms. His weekend at Wimbledon playing among the game\u2019s best  \u2014   \u201cI saw Djokovic earlier, and my jaw dropped I\u2019m going to act cool and pretend it\u2019s all normal now,\u201d he said  \u2014   has proved equally invigorating. \u201cI\u2019m delighted, but it makes me realize I want it week in, week out now,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to keep working, keep my head down, and get on with it. \u201d Bate, who was unable to cancel her Monday dental patients\u2019 appointments, will follow his   match from afar. She said she believed she would have many more opportunities to watch Willis continue toward a Hollywood ending. \u201cSomething in his mind has just clicked, and he\u2019s ready now,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s taking it all in, and he\u2019s got plenty more in him. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563264.3537261}
