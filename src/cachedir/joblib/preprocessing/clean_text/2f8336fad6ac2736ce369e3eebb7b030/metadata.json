[Dershowitz makes a   case against the special counsel. First, he says, the Trump campaign is not facing criminal accusations. Second, he says, even if collusion were to be found between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, or if Trump were found to have divulged secrets to the Russian foreign minister, none of that would be illegal, and ought to be punished by voters, not prosecutors. Third, he argues, Trump\u2019s decision to fire James Comey does not constitute obstruction of justice, and a special counsel could not impeach him anyway.  The only legitimate targets of a special counsel, Dershowitz says, would be \u201cthose current and former intelligence officials who willfully leaked classified and highly secret information to the media\u201d over the past several months. He concludes: So what will the special prosecutor be doing? The short answer is that we don\u2019t know and may never know, because he will be operating in secret. His most powerful weapon will be the grand jury, which has the power to subpoena witnesses to be questioned without their lawyers behind closed doors. It is a crime to disclose or leak grand jury testimony (except in special situations). At the end of his super secret investigations, the special counsel has essentially three options: he can issue indictments and prosecute the defendants, he can issue a statement that no indictments are warranted and close down his investigation, or he can issue a report. If he were to issue a report, it would be   and based on an investigation not geared towards knowing the whole truth, but rather to develop and present to the grand jury sufficient evidence to show probable cause that a crime may have been committed. The grand jury hears only one side  \u2014   the prosecutor\u2019s. A report, based on no criminal investigation, is likely to be   and incomplete. Dershowitz writes that he would have preferred to see \u201ca   investigatory commission to uncover the whole truth\u201d about Russia\u2019s role in the election.
