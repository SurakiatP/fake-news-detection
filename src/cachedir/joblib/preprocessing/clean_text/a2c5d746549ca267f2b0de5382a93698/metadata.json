Quicken Loans Arena, home of the Cavaliers, was hosting an official Game 7 watch party. The place was gussied up in    banners proclaiming, \u201cALL IN. \u201d In fact, most things were all out. The $5 tickets for the 20, 562 indoor seats sold out in less than a minute a like number of admissions for the outdoor plaza were also gobbled up in under a minute. The chosen ones (apologies, LeBron) shuffled past their ticketless brethren in an approximation of the Last Judgment, marching toward not the Pearly Gates but the Gateway Plaza security. \u201cAnybody got a ticket to sell?\u201d a tattooed man said. \u201cOne ticket?\u201d Inside, your   Ahmad and Nicole, a   couple, took over the Humongotron. \u201cThe   scoreboard has four enormous HD video screens that are tilted and uniquely curved to provide optimal viewing angles for all fans\u201d is the way the Q\u2019s website described it, and the Big H, replete with flaming sabers, could barely contain Ahmad\u2019s enthusiasm. \u201cIt\u2019s Game 7 of the N. B. A. finals with the Golden State Warriors\u201d  \u2014   we boo  \u2014   \u201cgoing against YOUR Cleveland Cavaliers!\u201d High in the rafters  \u2014   the uppermost stretches of the Q are dubbed Loudville  \u2014   Nicole cornered Mark, a young fan. She asked what his plans were after the Cavs won. Mark\u2019s eyes went saucers, as if the thought had never really occurred to him. Then the Humongotron filled with pregame   live from Oakland. There was LeBron James\u2019s face, broad and as impassive as the Sphinx. And the building lost its collective mind. Is this heaven? No, it\u2019s Cleveland. \u201cDo not engage in any fighting or throwing of objects,\u201d the   announcer reminded us. \u201cViolators will be ejected and subject to arrest. \u201d It\u2019s not easy being CLE. In most cities, sports failure is an occasional painful lesson in Cleveland, it has been the entire point. Futility here turned into an annual ritual: The (insert franchise name here) would start the season with high hopes, lose much of their steam via poor   play and horrible   miscalculations (see Johnny Football) and reload with a new crop of talent, only to reprise the outcome. The Cavs had seemingly followed the script, left for dead after the fourth game of the championship series as assorted talking heads proclaimed that no team had ever come back from a   series deficit. Believeland would have none of it. \u201cCavs all the way,\u201d Laurie Coduto said. Her husband, Mike, agreed. \u201cYou know the Cavs are going to win,\u201d he said. The Codutos were here Sunday night because \u201cwe want to be part of history,\u201d Laurie said. The music kicked in. Billy Idol was singing \u201cRebel Yell. \u201d Or it could have been \u201cWhite Wedding. \u201d Heck, it could have been Pachelbel\u2019s \u201cToccata in E Minor. \u201d No matter. It was the moment, and the moment is what set the wheelchairs in the Subway Fan Zone to dancing. A trio of young men passed, laden with enough nachos for a week in the North Woods. \u201cFollow me,\u201d one said. \u201cKnow where you\u2019re going?\u201d \u201cNo. \u201d You knew by the time of the player introductions that something was different. As the lights dimmed, and just before the Humongotron belched fire, a fan waved a sign: \u201cLeBron the Real M. V. P. \u201d Maybe. The Warriors closed the half strong. Draymond Green ignited an   run in the final four minutes of the second quarter, and Golden State took a   lead into the locker room. No matter. \u201cThe Cavs are going to win,\u201d said a woman who gave her name as Ophelia. Calm in the storm, she was here \u201cto be part of the excitement. \u201d The elite craziness took place in deeper waters. The Cleveland Indians\u2019 afternoon game against the Chicago White Sox provided the undercard, and Tribe fans wandered over from the ballpark to join the throng outside. The vibe was Spring Break North the dress  \u2014   what there was of it  \u2014   was casual, the conversation livelier. \u201cDid you get him anything for Father\u2019s Day?\u201d a young woman asked her friend. \u201cWho says he\u2019s the father?\u201d her friend answered, not looking up from her drink. Nearby, another young woman lectured a boy. \u201cDon\u2019t play for a team,\u201d she scolded. \u201cBe a lawyer and own the team. \u201d She added, \u201cI dated a lawyer, and I should know. \u201d The boy was about 2 years old and tiny, riding on his father\u2019s shoulders. Dad and son quickly moved away. With 1 minute 50 seconds left in the game, James uncoiled a   block of an Andre Iguodala shot. Kyrie Irving hit a   shot over Stephen Curry. Curry answered with a wildly errant   attempt on the other end before James was fouled hard. He knocked down the second of two free throws for a   Cleveland lead with 10 seconds on the clock. Chants of \u201cM. V. P. !\u201d rocked the Q. Please, no more about the Curse. Suffice to say, the Cavs put up a season that any thinking sports fan ought to have been proud to witness. Cleveland has beaten flawed teams, like Atlanta, and it has beaten young rosters just coming into their own, like Detroit and Toronto. The Cavs are smarter than any team that\u2019s tougher, and there aren\u2019t many of those. It could be argued, while listening to Wiz Khalifa rattle your molars, that sport has sucked the charm out of the contemporary game and replaced it with volume. Marketing is a simple villain. Hunger for karmic justice, and they will offer you a discounted hot dog. Shiver in the cold rain of a   of disappointment, and they will hand you a FirstEnergy  . That is the way the game is played now. It is easy to overlook the obvious even when it is flashed onto a video screen the size of an apartment building. The real power lies inside, coiled and remarkable. It always has. It is what causes the granny during the Irving   to chair dance to mad beats. It is what causes the beanpole wearing a Matthew Dellavedova jersey as a belly shirt to lean to his left to misguide a Curry free throw, even if the hoop in question is 2, 200 miles away. And yes, it is what turns every \u201cBrian on a car phone\u201d into James Naismith this time of year. No maybes here. We\u2019re going to win. Not \u201cthey\u201d or \u201cI. \u201d In the end, the Cavs played like a team with a chip on its shoulder, winning for a city full of people with a chip on theirs. Which brings us back to Mark, pondering a course of action for the final buzzer. \u201cI\u2019m going to go running in the street,\u201d he said. It was a beautiful summer night, a gentle breeze finally coming over a Great Lake, past the glass pyramid of the Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll Hall of Fame. The Cavs were champs. A spell had been lifted without crystals, roosters or the intercession of Madame Zora. And there was nothing left to do except join 20, 562 of your closest friends and run in the street.'"}, "time": 1742628323.0068672}
