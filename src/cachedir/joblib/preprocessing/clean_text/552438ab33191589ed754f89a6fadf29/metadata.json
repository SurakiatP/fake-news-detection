The identity of the Santa who graces ABC Carpet  Home? His identity is off the record, too. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a job,\u201d Amy Chender, that store\u2019s chief operating officer, wrote in an email. \u201cHe is Santa. \u201d We get it: Magic must be preserved. If you don\u2019t want a Santa spoiler, stop reading here. Every now and then, a brave Santa offers a peek behind the red velvet curtain. John Gebbie, a    grandfather of three, agreed to share the tricks of his trade on one of his busiest weekends, the one before Christmas. 9 a. m.: It all starts with the beard.  A key ingredient to becoming Santa? You must nail the facial hair. \u201cYou know what the kids use to spike their hair?\u201d Mr. Gebbie asks, gesturing to the loops in his mustache. \u201cGot2b Glued. That\u2019s what I used. \u201d Mr. Gebbie joined the Santa trade two years ago after crossing paths in a Costco store with another man who looked a lot like St. Nick. That man was Timothy Connaghan, a member of the International Brotherhood of Real Bearded Santas and the creator of School4Santas. com. Interested in extra income after retiring from a career as a customs broker, Mr. Gebbie enrolled in Santa school, where the coursework included lessons on how to talk with children (yes, this Santa has undergone a background check) winning over Santa skeptics and building his business. 9:30 a. m.: The commute begins. Mr. Gebbie lives in Port Jefferson, on Long Island, which is about 70 miles from today\u2019s gig, a fitness complex called MatchPoint in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. Mr. Gebbie begins his trip by clearing snow off his sleigh, a blue 1996 Subaru Impreza. \u201cI tell the kids the dents are from the reindeer,\u201d he said. 11:24 a. m.: The transformation. Some events offer valet service and changing rooms, but MatchPoint is a   affair. Mr. Gebbie lugs a garment bag and a rolling suitcase to the gym\u2019s entrance. Still a relatively new Santa, Mr. Gebbie has personally booked about 15 events during this year\u2019s   season, ranging from a stint at Cipriani 42nd Street to home visits. He can earn $200 to $1, 000 per appearance. (This event will pay him toward \u201cthe high end\u201d of what he makes.) MatchPoint has been transformed into a festive wonderland. Mr. Gebbie finds a space to change behind a curtain. \u201cI want to lose a little more weight next year,\u201d he said of his red velvet suit. \u201cI might get a 2XL instead of a 3XL. \u201d On his belt is a magic key to every house  \u2014   this is crucial for warding off questions from children who don\u2019t have chimney access. 12:13 p. m.: Taking the stage. Mr. Gebbie emerges from behind the curtain to take his place on Santa\u2019s throne, where he plugs in a portable fan (Santas can easily overheat). Children wander near him, murmuring Ded Moroz  \u2014   Santa Claus in Russian. This is an    event, stuffed with more than a dozen performers. Parents have paid up to $60 to spend the day here with their children. Troy Curtis, a performer who was once part of the boy band Menudo, is singing a Bruno Mars hit. The event is flashy, but the day\u2019s success hinges on Santa, according to Dennis Jaigobin, who produced the event. The work is surprisingly physical: To beckon   children, Mr. Gebbie hams it up on stage by clapping, waving and cupping his hands around his mouth. One of Mr. Gebbie\u2019s visitors, Gabriel Haskel, 5, is a professional. \u201cThis is the fourth Santa this year,\u201d his father, Oleg Haskel, said. \u201cSome of them he believes and others he\u2019s like, \u2018Nah, that\u2019s a costume. \u2019\u201d Onstage, the boy confers with Santa for a moment, and afterward, Mr. Gebbie cups his hands: \u201cA piano!\u201d he mouths to the boy\u2019s parents. Gabriel says this Santa is the real deal. 1:24 p. m.: Santa takes a break. There are a few cardinal rules for being Santa, and one is that a break is mandated every hour. As gymnasts dance to Russian music, Mr. Gebbie disappears behind a blue tarp. An ice princess materializes with a plate of boiled hot dogs and a few pieces of fried food. \u201cYou never refuse it because you never know,\u201d he says, accepting sustenance. 6:30 p. m.: The car ride home. After his shift is over, Mr. Gebbie faces a long drive back to Port Jefferson. Spending six hours working a bilingual event has reminded him of his goal for the next year. \u201cI want to learn foreign languages,\u201d he said. \u201cI just want the kids to come in and feel comfortable. \u201d Another goal: less travel. Tomorrow, he\u2019ll drive the 70 miles back to Sheepshead Bay and become Santa all over again. It\u2019s not easy being Santa.'"}, "time": 1742562949.4106586}
