However, the end is nigh\u2026because as at the same time, Nostradamus also predicted that Trumps presidency would herald the the end of the world.\\nThe ancient prophet refers to president-elect Donald Trump as \u201cthe false trumpet\u201d who will one day engage in military adventures to force \u201cByzantium to change its laws,\u201d which in turn would lead to the Apocalypse. \u201cThe false trumpet concealing madness will cause Byzantium to change its laws,\u201d Nostradamus predicted over four hundred years ago.\\nWhile many were surprised by the billionaire\u2019s victory in the 2016 US election, followers of Nostradamus would not have been, claiming the prophesier predicted this in the 16th century.\\nIn Century III, Quatrain 81, Nostradamus wrote: \u201cThe great shameless, audacious bawler. He will be elected governor of the army: The boldness of his contention. \u201cThe bridge broken, the city faint from fear.\u201d\\nMany believe that the \u201cshameless, audacious bawler\u201d part refers to Mr Trump\u2019s loud communication, while \u201cgovernor of the army\u201d refers to being in charge of the world\u2019s leading military force. In Century 1, 40, another prediction reads: \u201cThe false trumpet concealing madness will cause Byzantium to change its laws.\u201d\\nByzantium was an Ancient Greek colony \u2013 some have connected this to the fact Greece is becoming a landing spot for immigrants and refugees, a topic that has been at the center of Mr Trump\u2019s candidacy.\\nFinally, in Quatrain 50, Nostradamus writes \u201cthe Republic of the big city\u201d will engage in costly military operations, ordered by the \u201ctrumpet\u201d, which has led to fears of nuclear war. One user wrote on Facebook: \u201cI pretty sure this is the start to Nostradamus\u2019 prediction of the Apocalypse.\u201d\\nAnother posted: \u201cNostradamus predicted this outcome. Nostradamus predicted after the trumpet wins, there will be a Great War! He predicted this 400 yrs ago! \u201cHis prediction have all come true! I\u2019m afraid America is going fall, compare us to Roma, we have to much debt, and we import more than we export, we are in serious trouble.\u201d\\n'"}, "time": 1742563111.3993304}
