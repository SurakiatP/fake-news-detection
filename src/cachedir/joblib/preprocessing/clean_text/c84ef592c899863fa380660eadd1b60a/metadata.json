{"duration": 1.3323190212249756, "input_args": {"text": "'\\nA grim new Ministry of Defense ( MoD ) report circulating in the Kremlin today states that intelligence analysts of the System of Forward-looking Military Research and Development ( SFLMRD ) have now placed the United States in the \u201c active zone \u201d of nations currently undergoing a \u201c Colour Revolution \u201d as both US and EU elites have united to topple the soon to come government of President-elect Donald Trump. [ Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]\\nAccording to this report, SFLMRD intelligence analysts are tasked with using \u201c modern/sophisticated \u201d technologies to ensure and protect the Federation\u2019s national security interests\u2014and of which the MoD has previously identified \u201c Colour Revolutions \u201d as being one of the gravest threats, not only to Russia, but the entire world.\\nDuring the MoD\u2019s 2014 meeting of the Moscow Conference on International Security , this report explains, Federation military commanders labeled \u201c Colour Revolutions \u201d as a new US and European approach to warfare that focuses on creating destabilizing revolutions in other nations as a means of serving their security interests at low cost and with minimal casualties .\\nThe some of first of these Western \u201c Colour Revolutions \u201d to be unleashed on an unsuspecting world, this report continues, was in 2003 when the legitimately elected democratic government of Georgia was overthrown in what was called the \u201c Rose Revolution \u201d\u2014and that turned this once peaceful nation into a Western military puppet who, in 2008, launched an unprovoked attack against the Federation , but that was quickly and decisively defeated.\\nNext to be attacked by a Western \u201c Colour Revolution \u201d, this report notes, was Ukraine, in 2004, who\u2019s \u201c Orange Revolution \u201d resulted in the 2014 overthrow of that nations legitimately elected government in what the powerful American private intelligence agency Stratfor (aka The Shadow CIA ) called \u201c the most blatant coup in history \u201d\u2014and like Georgia before it, has, likewise, been used by the West as a military puppet against the Federation .\\nIn 2005, this report continues, the West then launched a \u201c Colour Revolution \u201d against Kyrgyzstan called the \u201c Tulip Revolution \u201d\u2014but that ultimately failed leading that nation, in 2014, to expel the US military from its territory .\\nOnce the subversive tactics of the West in their using their \u201c Colour Revolutions \u201d against other nations was \u201c deciphered/discovered \u201d, this report says, both Iran (2009-\u201c Green Revolution \u201d) and Russia (2011-\u201c White (Snow) Revolution \u201d) were able to be stop them from being successful and causing great loss of life.\\nTo exactly how the West \u201c engineered/manipulated \u201d their \u201c Colour Revolutions \u201d, this report explains, was through the use of what are called non-governmental organizations ( NGO\u2019s ) using very innocuous sounding names that the United States and European Union would secretly funnel millions-of-dollars into for the purpose of fermenting rebellion\u2014and which, in 2015, President Putin signed a law against preventing their nefarious actions in the Federation .\\nHeading nearly all of these Western backed and financed \u201c Colour Revolution \u201d NGO\u2019s, this report details, is the Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros \u2014who has not only fomented rebellions across the world costing thousands of innocent lives, he was, also, recently exposed as being Hillary Clinton\u2019s puppetmaster controlling all of her actions during her failed bid to become the US president .\\nUnlike the Federation that has protected itself against a George Soros led, and US-EU funded, NGO \u201c Colour Revolution \u201d, this report grimly warns, the United States government has now become the most vulnerable nation in the world to this type of \u201c rebellion/warfare \u201d as he funds hundreds of organizations violently opposed to both America and that nations core moral values .\\nAnd immediately upon Donald Trump being elected as the 45 th President of the United States, this report states, these George Soros funded NGO\u2019s launched their newest \u201c Colour Revolution \u201d intended not only to destroy President Trump, but the entirety of America.\\nLed by the George Soros funded MoveOn.org NGO , this report continues, this new \u201c Colour Revolution \u201d striking American began with tens-of-thousands of protesters striking nearly all of the United States largest cities \u2014and that was quickly followed with thousands of these revolutionaries calling for the assassination of President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence before they can take office .\\nTo the main \u201c purpose/reason \u201d behind these protests, this report explains, is to initiate a \u201c brutal/violent \u201d response from US government forces seeking to suppress them and reestablish order\u2014which in turn these revolutionaries will use as an example of how the American government is no longer legitimate because it\u2019s killing innocent people, and, therefore, must be overthrown.\\nNot being understood by the American people about how these \u201c Colour Revolutions \u201d work, this report continues, is that they are intended to last for years\u2014like in Ukraine that took a full 10 years before that government was overthrown.\\nTo the most basic reason why this \u201c Colour Revolution \u201d is now targeting the United States, this report details, are the US-EU elites fear of President-elect Donald Trump whose choice of nationalism over globalism has left European leftist leaders in \u201c complete horror \u201d as the populace revolution he, Trump, is leading is soon to wash ashore in Europe as new elections for nearly all of the continent are nearing\u2014with Holland being the first fall , and France soon to follow , and whose next leader, Marine Le Pen , just proclaimed: \u201c Congratulations to the new President of the US, Donald Trump, and the American people \u2013 free! \u201d\\nWith the US propaganda mainstream media still in denial of what has happened to them because of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s victory, and Google now reporting that their top search term is \u201c How did Donald Trump win? \u201d , this report further states, it bears notice that the Kremlin and its intelligence analysts were among the only entities in the world who correctly stated Donald Trump would win\u2014and as we had detailed in numerous reports, including Russia Confirms Supercomputer Findings Showing Donald Trump Landslide Victory and Russian Report Warns: American Revolution Has Now Begun, May Last Entire Decade .\\nBut to the most global consequential outcome of Donald Trump becoming the 45 th President of the United States, this report concludes, (and as we had previously alerted you to on 13 May in our report Putin Warns Military Commanders: \u201cIf It\u2019s Hillary Clinton, It\u2019s War\u201d ) was President Putin\u2019s advisor Sergei Glaziev stating just hours ago how close to catastrophe our world actually was: \u201c Americans had two choices: World War III or multilateral peace. Clinton was a symbol of war, and Trump has a chance to change this course .\u201d\\nLet\u2019s all hope President Trump can, indeed, change this course because the world, literally, now hangs in the balance if he doesn\u2019t.\\nSource \\n'"}, "time": 1742564428.3775861}
