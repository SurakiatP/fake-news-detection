In the other, he plays a schlubby dreamer turned jungle adventurer. The details are not important. The main thing is, the movies will keep him in the public eye  \u2014   talk shows, awards ceremonies, magazine covers  \u2014   continuing the    McConnaissance that went into effect when, in a   move, he gave up   for more challenging fare. But if you think of him as a mere movie star, you\u2019re wrong. His work with the directors Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, Christopher Nolan, Richard Linklater and Steven Soderbergh has served to provide him cover. Mr. McConaughey has really been a guru all along. Over a period of more than 20 years, almost unnoticed, he has been building a religion of sorts. Call it the Tao of Matthew McConaughey. He preaches to his flock largely through the media of men\u2019s magazines and television commercials. Take the Lincoln campaign. Mr. McConaughey didn\u2019t need a free car when he began pitching the Lincoln MKC in 2014. What he did need was a platform to get his message across. So while other   pitchmen (like Jon Hamm, George Clooney and Jeff Bridges) play the game with just enough enthusiasm to earn the huge paychecks, Mr. McConaughey goes deep. \u201cSometimes you gotta go back to actually move forward,\u201d he says in an early Lincoln ad while cruising a dark empty freeway. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t mean going back to reminisce or chase ghosts. I mean go back to see where you came from, where you been, how you got here. \u201d Perhaps knowing we are weak of spirit and doubting his words, he adds reassuringly: \u201cI know there are those that say you can\u2019t go back. Yes, you can. You just have to look in the right place. \u201d His work with Lincoln made him a hot enough property in the advertising industry that Wild Turkey signed him not only as the face of its brand but also as the creative director for a new series of commercials. His first spot, \u201cThe Journey Begins,\u201d is set, no surprise, in a bar. The lights are low. The mood is mellow. We hear Mr. McConaughey\u2019s voice: \u201cWe\u2019re not in a rush to be most popular. \u201d Pause. \u201cNot in a rush not to be. \u201d We follow an elegant woman carrying a glass of Wild Turkey deeper into the space. Suddenly, there is an   blast of a tuba. A bar that was quiet only seconds earlier is now a wild roadhouse, filled with the sounds of the Hot 8 Brass Band, whose members mix freely with twirling dancers, and we are reminded that a tenet of the McConaughey worldview is to stay loose, to remain open to any sudden change. Once we have grown accustomed to the new surroundings, the woman leaves the bar behind for the outdoors. The sun is setting behind distant peaks. Mr. McConaughey has led us, in mere seconds, from the noisy pleasures of civilization to the tranquillity of nature. \u201cReal bourbon, no apologies,\u201d he says in the  . \u201cIf it\u2019s for you, you\u2019ll know. \u201d This would seem to be a natural ending. But Mr. McConaughey has one more twist in store: A bright moon appears in a night sky, we hear sweet music, and guess who is sitting at a grand piano situated, incongruously, on an expanse of grass? Mr. McConaughey himself, unshaven,   surrounded by revelers. Through his person, it seems, the untamed and the more refined have come together in a harmonious whole. \u201cAhhhhh,\u201d he says. \u201cThank you!\u201d The commercial is a distillation of McConaugheyism disguised as an enticement to drink. Listen to your own inner tune. Go where it takes you. The good things you discover along the way, you were meant to discover. Tomorrow\u2019s hangover? You were meant to have that, too. Readers of men\u2019s magazines are often seeking a guide, a mentor, a hip professor. And Mr. McConaughey comes through in one cover story after another. Not only does he have pectorals that look like \u201ca pair of toasted dinner rolls,\u201d as GQ once wrote, but also a questing mind that cannot be tamed. \u201cEvery time you think you\u2019ve reached the end of that long   street, you slip around the edge, past that stopping point,\u201d he said in Esquire in 2011. \u201cAnd at the end of your life, all the things you thought were periods, they turn out to be commas. There was never a full stop to any of it. \u201d In a 2012 Men\u2019s Journal interview, he tackled the eternal question of fate versus free will: \u201cEverything we do in life is part of a plan. Sometimes you learn what that plan is today, sometimes you learn about it tomorrow and sometimes it takes you years to figure out. \u201d Lest he seem too New   he added a dollop of Ayn Rand to his philosophical brew in a 2013 GQ profile: \u201cI\u2019m a fan of the word \u2018selfish,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018Selfish\u2019 has always gotten a bad rap. You should do for you. \u201d He does not shy away from the charged subject of masculinity. \u201cMan is never more masculine than after the birth of his first child,\u201d he said in his most recent Esquire  . \u201cI don\u2019t mean in a macho way. I mean in terms of giving a man strength. \u201d It goes down easy because Mr. McConaughey remains something of a good ol\u2019 boy who likes his Shiner Bock and comped tickets at the   line. A foundational part of his myth is the 1999 night when he was booked on a charge of suspected marijuana possession after he was arrested at his home in Austin, Tex. where he was dancing naked and playing the bongos at 3 a. m. (Who knew joy was against the law?) Years later, in an Esquire interview, he was calling himself \u201cspiritual,\u201d only to correct himself and say that the word spiritual was \u201ca dodge. \u201d \u201cI\u2019m religious,\u201d he said. \u201cI like that word. You can use it. \u201d In his 2014 Oscar acceptance speech, he thanked God explicitly, saying, \u201cHe has shown me that it\u2019s a scientific fact that gratitude reciprocates. \u201d That was before he said his hero is himself, Matthew McConaughey, but 10 years in the future, so that there is always \u201csomebody to keep on chasing. \u201d His   the first book he says he read cover to cover, is \u201cThe Greatest Salesman in the World\u201d by Og Mandino. It tells the tale of 10 ancient scrolls and a trader named Hafid, who reveals their wisdom. Like all sages, Mr. McConaughey can be hard to follow. Confronted with his words, you may feel like Woody Harrelson\u2019s character in \u201cTrue Detective,\u201d trapped in a car as Mr. McConaughey\u2019s Rust Cohle speaks in riddles. But for all its mystery, McConaugheyism is not a hair shirt religion. In fact, for a number of years now, as his fans and friends have noticed, it has decreed avoiding shirts whenever possible. \u201cI worked hard to live in Malibu, California,\u201d he told GQ in 2014. \u201cI\u2019m going to the beach! I\u2019m gonna go surfing! No, I don\u2019t want to wear a shirt. I want to get a tan and feel the sun on my bones. \u201d He\u2019s not about abnegating life\u2019s pleasures. He likes the Dolce  Gabbana suits, the Lincolns, the evening glass of bourbon. Trust the universe and it will provide. That seems fundamental to the McConaughey way. He has been saying it one way or another since he burst onto the scene in 1993 as Wooderson in \u201cDazed and Confused. \u201d It is said that he improvised Wooderson\u2019s famous line, \u201cJust keep livin\u2019. \u201d He has since adopted it as a motto and even named his foundation after it. He was a guru from the  . A year before the film\u2019s release, he wandered into the bar of the Hyatt Regency Austin, where he happened to meet a producer. The chance encounter helped win him the role in \u201cDazed and Confused,\u201d which led to his breakout in \u201cA Time to Kill. \u201d Soon enough, Vanity Fair was hailing him as the next Paul Newman. \u201cWhy did I go to the bar?\u201d he asked a writer from The Austin Chronicle in 1995. \u201cWhy did I stay there late that night? Why did this bartender with the same name as me tell me there was a producer in the bar who was working on a movie?\u201d Why did any of us go into that bar? In the McConaughey belief system, it was destiny. He went into that bar in 1992 so that, in 2015, he could sit on a stage inside the University of Houston\u2019s football stadium and offer the graduating class (and all of us, via YouTube) this   utterance: \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing that you can depend on people being, it\u2019s people. \u201d Since he joined with Lincoln in 2014, Mr. McConaughey has dispensed many such nuggets of wisdom. But with the latest Lincoln commercial, which has no   he has gone deeper into the mystic. This is   messaging, and it presents us with a new figure: Silent McConaughey. Like certain Buddhist monks, like Thomas Merton and the Trappists, like Kramer on Season 9 of \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d Mr. McConaughey seems to be reaching for enlightenment through quietude. The ad, titled \u201cMidnight\u201d and directed by J. C. Chandor, opens at night, inside a modern home in the Hollywood Hills with glass walls and jetliner views. Mr. McConaughey, well groomed in a dark suit, looks as if he is back from a catered affair. He walks with purpose through the living room, toward a patio with an infinity pool. We see mountains. A sky full of glowing stars. A twinkling metropolis below. Mr. McConaughey gazes at the paradise he has won for himself. It seems he wants us, his followers, to have it, too. He stops at the edge of the pool. He turns around slowly. Then there is a cut to another McConaughey, who is driving alone at night through a long tunnel. Then we return to the pool. Back to the tunnel. And back to the pool. Is the tunnel scene a flashback to a McConaughey who existed at an earlier moment that same night? Is it perhaps a flash forward to a future McConaughey, similar to the one he chases but is never able to catch? Or do the two McConaugheys exist simultaneously, like Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat? Tight shot of Mr. McConaughey, still fully clothed, at the pool\u2019s edge. He smiles. What does it mean? He springs into a reverse back dive, and he breaks the water\u2019s surface just as the McConaughey at the wheel of the Lincoln emerges from the tunnel and speeds toward the horizon. In this chaotic world, he seems to be telling us, find a moment to be still. Reflect. But don\u2019t get so caught up in reflection that you cannot make a bold, blind leap of faith  \u2014   into the water, toward the horizon. Mr. McConaughey has been speaking his message long enough. His followers know it by heart. Now he has gone beyond words.'"}, "time": 1742564430.4607112}
