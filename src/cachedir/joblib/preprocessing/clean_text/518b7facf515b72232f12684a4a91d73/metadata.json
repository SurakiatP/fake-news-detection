Nowhere was its strategy more evident than in iMessage, the company\u2019s instant messaging system that offered a free, elegant chatting solution exclusive to Apple devices. Until last week, that is, when Apple updated its software, cracked open iMessage and allowed the ephemera of the outside internet to seep in. Now, click on an unassuming arrow in the chat window, and you\u2019ll throw open a junk drawer of digital tchotchkes scavenged from web properties new and old. GIFs, stickers and supersized emoji dominate this digital playground, while text  \u2014   actual words  \u2014   becomes almost an afterthought. But unlike the freewheeling world of the outside web, where we grab and go as we please, Apple is steering users toward a tightly curated selection of   toys. None would look out of place at a   \u2019s birthday party. Many come at a price. Welcome to Apple\u2019s sanitized, monetized version of internet culture. Apple\u2019s extreme messaging makeover gives us a suite of new visual effects  \u2014   throw confetti, release balloons and shoot lasers across the text screen  \u2014   that recall the crude,   d\u00e9cor of   GeoCities sites. Another set of tricks turns the text box into a kind of slick, improvised web video: The \u201cloud\u201d effect makes the chat bubble stretch and tremble as it\u2019s delivered, while the \u201cgentle\u201d effect shrinks it down to visualize a whimper. The most superfluous piece of flair is the \u201cdigital touch\u201d feature, which conjures a beating heart or a sizzling fireball when you press on the screen just so. These features mimic the aesthetics of the open internet, which is obsessed with nostalgia and is not exactly subtle. But they can\u2019t replicate the feeling of collecting digital miscellany in our travels across the internet, remixing the material and sending it along to friends who might appreciate the find. The programmatic iMessage sucks the spontaneity from the experience. It standardizes the strange. Several new features, meanwhile, blow up iMessage\u2019s intimate chat experience to help it compete with the social networks. A handy GIF keyboard jumps off the   empire that Tumblr built, calling up video loops of broadly accessible cultural references (Honey Boo Boo dancing, two Minions giggling) to convey a range of emotional states. Another feature lets you   directly onto your photos, just like you can on Snapchat. But mostly, this thing feels like Facebook. A new class of iMessage apps  \u2014   yes, apps within an app  \u2014   lets chatters play Words With Friends, send money through Square or make dinner reservations on OpenTable, all right within the chat window. It feels like iMessage is trying to swallow the rest of your phone. The camera is in here, and so too can be Fandango, ESPN, and, if you want, Carrot, a snarky robot that reads you the weather report for $3. 99. In many of these cases, the service is so slight that exchanging actual words would work just fine: Want to see \u201cSnowden\u201d at 10:15? Did you catch the Nats game? It\u2019s 77 and sunny  \u2014   greeaaaaat. It\u2019s not clear why every shade of human interaction needs to be mediated by its own app. Here\u2019s one theory: Each tap into the iMessage world sends you further away from your chat bubbles and deeper into Apple\u2019s labyrinth of special features. Follow the path to its inevitable conclusion, and all of a sudden, you\u2019re no longer talking with your friends. You\u2019re shopping. Five clicks into iMessage, you\u2019ll arrive at Apple\u2019s   sticker shop. Offering colorful sets of illustrations to drag and drop into your chats, it\u2019s one of iMessage\u2019s most tantalizing new destinations. If our chat windows function as modern living rooms, stickers offer the opportunity to appoint our walls with art from   digital creators. Too bad Apple is most excited to highlight stuff created by brands. This past weekend, the app store showcased sticker packs sponsored by Pok\u00e9mon, Star Wars and Disney. Other top offerings came from the Powerpuff Girls, Marvel, Sesame Street, Sephora, the Backstreet Boys and Ellen DeGeneres, who\u2019s charging $1. 99 for a set of illustrations including an avocado in a top hat and a cucumber in a snapback cap. The products are ads for other products. iMessage is the iPhone\u2019s most trafficked feature. Its chats facilitate an endless combination of social interactions and emotional expressions. But Apple\u2019s shop suggests that all conversations would improve from a Party   redecoration, with generic celebratory sentiments and   flair. \u201cStickers\u201d sound inherently childish, but they don\u2019t have to be. The stickerification of chats was pioneered by Line, a Japanese chat giant that swept Asia and is lately making a bid for western audiences. Line loves corporate synergy, too, heralding sticker sets starring Snoopy, Super Mario and Hello Kitty. But even as it attempts world chat domination, Line services online subcultures. Dozens of sticker sets feature gay characters, and more than one  \u2014   \u201cFangirl\u2019s Activities\u201d and \u201cI Love KPOP\u201d  \u2014   depicts anime girls in various states of obsession. Then there\u2019s the sex stuff. The \u201cUMAOTOKO\u201d sticker shows two men in horse costumes, uh, stretching together. The most risqu\u00e9 sticker I could find in Apple\u2019s version was in a set called \u201cFailmoji. \u201d It\u2019s a   butt with the caption \u201cFART! !\u201d Apple\u2019s chat overhaul ushers elements of internet creativity into the company\u2019s tightly controlled  . But the most truly creative expression to unfurl inside iMessages so far has been made in opposition to Apple\u2019s imposed boundaries. Madison Malone Kircher, a writer at the New York magazine tech blog Select All, wrote a handy guide to using iMessage to \u201cannoy the hell out of your friends. \u201d When the tech writer Casey Johnston updated her phone and the new iMessage, she posted screenshots of herself and a friend virtually vandalizing their chat window with smarmy pregnancy stickers,    effects and graphics layered so high the images became unintelligible. As Ms. Johnston put it: \u201cThe race to find the worst thing iOS can possibly do is on. \u201d May I suggest this celebrity sticker pack created in the image of the white rapper  ?'"}, "time": 1742562737.9283395}
