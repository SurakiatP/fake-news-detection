C.  \u2014   As North Carolina State\u2019s star freshman, Dennis Smith Jr.   down Coach K Court one last time on Monday night to put an exclamation point on the Wolfpack\u2019s   upset of the Blue Devils, many sports fans received an opportunity to take up one of their favorite pastimes: hating Duke. For Duke students and supporters, the reaction to the program\u2019s first loss to N. C. State at Cameron Indoor Stadium since 1995  \u2014   before some of them were born  \u2014   was different. \u201cIt was a really tough one,\u201d Richard Liu, a senior who attended the game, wrote in an email, \u201cbecause N. C. State is a team we really should have beaten, especially at home. \u201d It has been a rare year of disappointments for Duke. The Blue Devils began the season at No. 1 but lost the top ranking before Thanksgiving. At times, they have been without their best player, Grayson Allen (suspended for tripping an opponent) several promising freshmen from their   recruiting class (injuries) and their Hall of Fame Coach, Mike Krzyzewski (lost to a back operation this month, and still out). Those misfortunes, of course, mean it has also been a rare year of schadenfreude for many outside Duke. But perhaps there is something to be said for what Duke offers its fans. At a time when entire segments of the country have retreated into private echo chambers of elation or fear, sports is not a terrible place to try to put oneself in another\u2019s shoes. Call it sympathy for the Blue Devils. \u201cImagine how you\u2019d feel if you\u2019d gone to school there or if you played there,\u201d said Jay Bilas, an ESPN commentator who played for Duke in the 1980s and later was an assistant coach for the Blue Devils. \u201cLike, it\u2019s a blast. \u201d It is true that other fan bases  \u2014   almost all of them, actually  \u2014   are more in need of a   . Since 1985  \u2014   the year the N. C. A. A. tournament expanded to 64 teams and college basketball began its climb to the status of national spectacle  \u2014   Duke has been the country\u2019s most successful program, with 12 Final Four appearances and five national titles. In recent years, at least, it has also been the most popular, according to the Harris Poll. Other polarizing teams\u2019 pitches to casual fans are aggressively inclusive witness the Yankees\u2019 rechristening as America\u2019s team after the Sept. 11 attacks or the Dallas Cowboys\u2019 gargantuan Xanadu, ATT Stadium. But Duke, a tidy private university ranked eighth in U. S. News  World Report\u2019s list of America\u2019s top colleges, with a team led by a coach who moralizes about the realities of college basketball even as he benefits from them, seems to revel in its superiority. (One student\u2019s sign at Monday night\u2019s game read, \u201cNorth Carolina State is the North Carolina State of basketball. \u201d) The student section at Duke frequently serves as the university\u2019s   chest to a national audience. The Cameron Crazies, filling up the risers on the western side of the arena, are aggressive in trying to knock opposing players  . Sometimes, as when they chant, \u201cYou let the whole team down,\u201d after poor plays, they are fair and funny other times, they have pushed the envelope, even crossed lines. When a sign targeted a North Carolina player with the words \u201cJ. R. Can\u2019t Reid\u201d in 1988, Tar Heels Coach Dean Smith argued the taunt had racial undertones. When Duke hosted Michigan State this season, one sign mocked the continuing   crisis in Flint, Mich.: \u201cThe water tastes better in North Carolina. \u201d (A Duke basketball spokesman condemned that sign.) Duke students also continue to produce cheer sheets for games that, on one side, contain   dirt  \u2014   opposition research. Monday night\u2019s dirt sheet included the email address of one Wolfpack player, a past criminal charge against another and the suggestion that a third could be taunted for his first name. Michael Schoenfeld, a Duke spokesman, said the university would not \u201chesitate to criticize things that legitimately deserve criticism,\u201d but he insisted that college students were roughly the same at all colleges and that   vitriol was a response to the university\u2019s athletic and academic accomplishments. \u201cThe people who are supporters of Duke and like Duke understand what this university is and can do,\u201d Schoenfeld said, \u201cand that will inevitably create some friction or backlash. So be it. \u201d The Duke dynamic has been magnified this season with the blossoming of Allen, the team\u2019s most compelling villain in nearly three decades. His infamy outside Durham is equaled only by that of a player so despised that he became the subject of an ESPN documentary titled \u201cI Hate Christian Laettner. \u201d Allen is a junior whom some pegged as a strong contender for player of the year. But he has provoked public ire by tripping opponents at least three times in the past two seasons. The most recent incident, against Elon on Dec. 21, prompted a   suspension, the loss of his captaincy and a news media firestorm that longtime Duke observers labeled unprecedented. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d Bilas said. \u201cIt feels different. \u201d Yet to walk past the   tent city of Krzyzewskiville and into the preposterously tiny Cameron on a January evening is to understand why Duke inspires passion not only among its detractors. \u201cBecause Duke is a relatively small school, you feel like you are personally invested in it, because when you see the players around campus, they really feel like classmates,\u201d said Tara Bansal, the student government president. The fact that students will put down stakes  \u2014   up to 100 tents  \u2014   for several weeks for a chance at prime seating inside Cameron (particularly for games against North Carolina) is an indisputable testament to the students\u2019 zeal. One must be zealous  \u2014   and drunk on one\u2019s youth (and perhaps other things)  \u2014   to spend dozens of nights in an unheated tent for the sake of a good view. And although one might scoff at the tent city  \u2014   which, given Duke\u2019s demographics, is sort of like an Occupy Wall Street for, rather than against, the 1 percent  \u2014   tent life is rough. According to byzantine rules, tents must be occupied at all times and are subject to   by line monitors. The only bathrooms are in an adjacent gym. On Monday night, the ground near the tents was muddy. Many of the   city\u2019s denizens could be seen huddled in their canvas shelters reading thick textbooks. \u201cWe\u2019ve got \u201d said Evi Alexopoulos, a freshman whose tent\u2019s rules require her to spend several nights there every week. \u201cOutlets are hard to find. \u201d Among the rewards, though, are the prime seats in Cameron, which, with an official capacity of 9, 314, is half the size of North Carolina\u2019s Dean Smith Center and significantly smaller than the home arenas of nearly every other college program of Duke\u2019s pedigree and popularity. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a bad seat,\u201d said Herb Neubauer, who is known as Crazy Towel Guy for his practice of waving a towel to rile the crowd from his seat in the upper deck. Even so, student attendance is down this season, according to The Duke Chronicle  \u2014   most likely part of a general trend in college sports  \u2014   and loyalties have been tested by the furor over Allen. \u201cI have good friends at Syracuse, so I get bullied,\u201d said Kit Devine, a freshman. \u201cGrayson has been a pretty big deal. \u201d The season is hardly lost. Duke is   and still in the top 25, although it needs to get healthy, both on the court and on the sideline. Allen needs to return to the attacking style that made him a    . Jayson Tatum, Marques Bolden and Harry Giles, the heralded freshmen who missed time with injuries, need to develop a better feel for the college game. But even the prospect of a disappointing season  \u2014   more drama questions about the longevity of Krzyzewski, who turns 70 next month a lackluster postseason performance despite lofty preseason expectations  \u2014   is unlikely to bring the Cameron Crazies back to sanity. \u201cI get what they\u2019re saying,\u201d Alexopoulos, the   freshman, said of the haters. But, she added, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t question my passion. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562603.1693897}
