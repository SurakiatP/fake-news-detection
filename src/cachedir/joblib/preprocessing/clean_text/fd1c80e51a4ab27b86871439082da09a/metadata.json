[Meanwhile, at an election campaign event in Amsterdam, Dutch   populist Geert Wilders also resorted to   comparisons, calling Erdogan an \u201c  leader. \u201d  The diplomatic tension has been rising in recent days amid Turkish plans to have government ministers to address rallies in Germany and the Netherlands in support of an upcoming constitutional referendum that would give Erdogan new powers. Speaking in Istanbul, the Turkish president fanned the flames with a stinging verbal attack. \u201cIn Germany they are not allowing our friends to speak. Let them do so. Do you think that by not allowing them to speak the votes in Germany will come out \u2018no\u2019 instead of \u2018yes? \u2019\u201d Erdogan said. \u201cGermany, you don\u2019t have anything to do with democracy. These current practices of yours are no different than the Nazi practices of the past. \u201d On Thursday, Turkey\u2019s justice minister canceled a meeting with his German counterpart after local authorities in southwest Germany withdrew permission for him to use a venue to hold a rally near the French border that was part of a campaign to get Turks in Germany to vote \u201cyes\u201d in the referendum. Turkey\u2019s economy minister, Nihat Zeybekci, was due to speak at two events in western Germany on Sunday. There are about 1. 4 million people in Germany who are eligible to vote in the Turkish referendum, Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern, in an interview with German weekly newspaper Welt am Sonntag, said it is time to pull the plug on   moves to bring Turkey into the EU. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t just temporarily suspend the accession talks with Turkey but end them,\u201d Kern said. \u201cWe can\u2019t continue to negotiate about membership with a country that has been steadily distancing itself for years, during ongoing access talks, from democratic standards and principles of the rule of law. \u201d The Dutch government is investigating whether it can halt a rally being planned for later in the week at which Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu is reportedly due to speak. Prime Minister Mark Rutte told Dutch broadcaster NOS on Saturday that his government \u201cis looking at all legal avenues to prevent such a visit. \u201d Rutte said the proposed constitutional changes take Turkey, an aspirant European Union member state, \u201cin a less democratic direction. \u201d \u201cWe believe that Dutch public space is not the place for political campaigns of other countries,\u201d Rutte wrote earlier in a post on his Facebook page. Kern said, \u201cA concerted approach by the EU to prevent such campaign appearances would make sense. So that individual countries such as Germany, where appearances have been banned, don\u2019t come under pressure from Turkey. \u201d Wilders, whose Party for Freedom is lagging only slightly behind Rutte\u2019s VVD party in polls before March 15 elections for Parliament\u2019s lower house, said he would go further if he were in power. \u201cI think that coming here to advocate a change of the Turkish constitution that will only strengthen the   leader Erdogan of Turkey more than Parliament, Turkish parliament, is the worst thing that could happen to us,\u201d Wilders told reporters at a campaign event. Wilders said that if he were Dutch prime minister, \u201c\u201dI would call the whole Cabinet of Turkey \u2018persona non grata\u2019 for a month or two, not allowing them to come here. \u201d Kern, however, pointed out that totally cutting ties with Ankara wouldn\u2019t be in EU interests. An EU deal with Turkey, which also is a NATO member, has significantly cut the number of migrants crossing into Europe. \u201cWe should realign the relationship, without the illusion of EU membership,\u201d Kern said. \u201cTurkey is an important partner in security matters, on migration and on economic cooperation. Turkey has stuck to all of its commitments resulting from the refugee deal in any case. We should build upon that. \u201d  '"}, "time": 1742564500.366062}
