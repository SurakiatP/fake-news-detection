Let\u2019s turn it over to Jennifer Medina, a correspondent based in Los Angeles, for today\u2019s introduction. Often referred to as the Ellis Island of Los Angeles, the neighborhood east of downtown known as Boyle Heights has been the first stop for several waves of immigration. Since the 1940s, it has transformed into a largely   enclave and the center of Chicano culture and activism in the city. As other parts of Los Angeles have seen real estate prices climb steadily, many in Boyle Heights have expressed concern about gentrification, particularly after several art galleries moved into an industrial stretch. The battle between the galleries and activists reached a peak last fall when someone   a vulgar statement condemning \u201cwhite art\u201d on the door of one gallery and a   investigation was opened. Almost from the moment it opened its doors last year Pssst, a nonprofit gallery, and its creators, have been the focus of protests and criticism on social media. Last month, they announced they could no longer tolerate it. They were closing up shop. \u201cThis persistent targeting, which was often highly personal in nature, was made all the more intolerable because the artists we engaged are queer, women,   people of color,\u201d they said on their website. \u201cWe could no longer continue to put already vulnerable communities at further risk. \u201d Defend Boyle Heights, one of the activist groups that has called for a boycott of the galleries, said that it considered the closing a victory and that it hoped other galleries would soon follow suit. The response has raised alarms for many of the other galleries in the area. Ethan Swan, one of the directors of 356 Mission, which has been there since 2013, said that he had tried to arrange a meeting with local activists, but that he had been repeatedly turned down. \u201cWe want to be thoughtful about our presence and what it was that we could do or how we could work together for a better future for this neighborhood and how it might shift,\u201d he said. \u201cBut their position is an uncompromising one since they don\u2019t see a solution unless we leave. \u201d Do you think the galleries should stay in Boyle Heights or leave?

[San Francisco Chronicle] On Monday, we wrote about an effort to end daylight saving time in California. We asked where you came down on the matter. Among hundreds of responses, an overwhelming majority made the same plea: stop the twice yearly clock changing. Readers called for the adoption of an unchanging time throughout the year, outnumbering those who favored the status quo by roughly eight to one. Most of those favoring an immutable time said they would prefer to simply stay on daylight saving time, dispensing with the \u201cfall back\u201d of November. Dave Spaulding, of Sausalito, echoed a theme: \u201cLove that extra hour of sunshine. \u201d The     crowd expressed worries of falling out of sync with the rest of the country. Others complained that our politicians should be focused on bigger issues. A sample of the responses: \u201cI really don\u2019t care which one we use. But use it consistently. I dislike the change. One or the other, not both. \u201d  \u2014   Carolyn Dennison, Garden Grove \u201cI\u2019m totally for permanent daylight saving time. I think people feel more energized and happy with the extra hour of sunshine. \u201d  \u2014   Toni Bouman, San Luis Obispo \u201cI very much favor eliminating the   time change. It is confusing and physically stressful. I dread it every time. Personally I would favor Pacific Standard Time year round. \u201d  \u2014   Leslie Clarke Gray, Cambria \u201cI feel daylight savings is an arbitrary practice of torture we impose upon ourselves. Ditch it and save the headache. \u201d  \u2014   Cory Windorff, Irvine \u201cIdeally the whole country would adopt a uniform time plan, either daylight saving time or standard. Maybe if California gets the ball rolling, other states would follow. Meanwhile, the shift back and forth is a useless and disruptive annoyance. \u201d  \u2014   Linda Lancione, Berkeley California Today goes live at 6 a. m. Pacific time weekdays.
