Still, some celebrities leapt to the   host\u2019s defense, including Star Trek actor George Takei, comedian Patton Oswalt, and actress Rosie O\u2019Donnell. \u201cNow the little right wing mushrooms want to #FireColbert because he made fun of the Troll King. Waaaa! It\u2019ll go as well as #BoycottHamilton,\u201d Takei wrote on Twitter Wednesday, appearing to refer to the social media outrage that enveloped the Broadway show Hamilton when the cast lectured Vice President Mike Pence from the stage during a performance in November.

The supportive messages from celebrities come as both Colbert and CBS have remained silent on the controversy and social media campaign. Neither the   host nor the network had issued a public statement as of Wednesday evening, and representatives for CBS did not immediately return Breitbart News\u2019 request for comment. On Wednesday, CBS announced that the May 9 episode of The Late Show would reunite the stars of Comedy Central\u2019s Daily Show, on which Colbert got his start. Jon Stewart, Samantha Bee, John Oliver, Rob Corddry and Ed Helms are set as guests for the episode.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum'"}, "time": 1742628347.665282}
