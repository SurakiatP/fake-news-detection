The agreement covers the port in Tartus and an air base near Latakia, which have been pivotal in Russian assistance to President Bashar   of Syria in fighting an array of insurgents. It ensures Russia\u2019s ability to deploy forces in Syria for the next   and perhaps beyond. News of the agreement came as Mr. Assad received what appeared to be another positive development: A Turkish official suggested publicly for the first time that Turkey would accept a peace deal in Syria\u2019s    war that would allow Mr. Assad to stay in power. The remarks by the official, Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, indicated that Turkey  \u2014   Syria\u2019s northern neighbor and one of Mr. Assad\u2019s most implacable foes  \u2014   had softened its position in the interest of finding a solution. While Turkey\u2019s government later said that Mr. Simsek\u2019s remarks had been misconstrued, it was clear that he had said a settlement without Mr. Assad would be \u201cnot, you know, realistic. \u201d Both developments came as Russia, Turkey and Iran prepared to convene Syrian peace talks in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan, on Monday. For the first time, it looked likely that the main Syrian opposition, along with many other factions, would sit down with Mr. Assad\u2019s government for peace talks. The last effort at such negotiations was held by the United Nations in Geneva in February, and it collapsed in days. The new Russian military agreement with Syria provides for an expansion of Russia\u2019s Tartus naval base on the Syrian coast under a   lease that could automatically renew for a further 25 years, according to Tass, the Russian news agency. Tass said the expansion would provide simultaneous berthing for up to 11 warships, including   vessels, more than doubling its present known capacity there. Tass reported that the agreement also provided for a similar   commitment for the Russians to use the Khmeimim Air Base in the Latakia area, which the Russians built in 2015 as they mobilized to help Mr. Assad\u2019s forces. There were news reports that the Russians were building a second runway at the air base. The military agreement came despite Russia\u2019s announcement this month that it was drawing down its  forces in Syria after successes by the Assad government against Syrian rebels, which were achieved with much help from the Russians. The rebels were ousted from their strongholds in Aleppo, once Syria\u2019s largest city, late last year, partly because of Russian air support. The   agreement came as momentum grew among dissidents to join the peace talks in Astana, although it was a foregone conclusion that any deal from those negotiations would be rejected by jihadists. At least 14 rebel factions are participating. At the Turkish government\u2019s insistence, however, Kurdish groups fighting the Islamic State in the east of the country and backed by the United States were not invited. Turkey\u2019s government has accused those Kurdish groups of affiliations with militant Kurdish separatists in Turkey. Mr. Simsek\u2019s remarks were made at a World Economic Forum session titled \u201cSyria and Iraq: Ending the Conflict. \u201d He suggested that Turkey would accept continued rule by Mr. Assad. \u201cAs far as our position on Assad is concerned,\u201d Mr. Simsek said, \u201cwe think that the suffering of the Syrian people and the tragedies, clearly the blame is squarely on Assad. \u201d \u201cBut we have to be pragmatic, realistic,\u201d he said. \u201cThe facts on the ground have changed dramatically, and so Turkey can no longer insist on, you know, a settlement without Assad, and it\u2019s not, you know, realistic. We just have to work with what we have. \u201d Hours later, Mr. Simsek\u2019s office in Ankara issued a statement saying news accounts had distorted Mr. Simsek\u2019s remarks and \u201ctried to create the perception that our deputy P. M. said, \u2018Turkey cannot insist anymore on an agreement without Assad. \u2019\u201d But a review of the videotape of the session left no doubt that that was what he had said. The Astana talks are the outcome of a     throughout Syria that began at the end of December. It has been widely observed except in areas where extreme jihadist factions prevail  \u2014   but with many accusations of breaches elsewhere as well. \u201cThe priority for us is to put an end to human tragedy, human suffering in Syria and Iraq,\u201d Mr. Simsek said in Davos. \u201cThe process is to make sure we translate the current lull into a more lasting   and then talk about more mundane stuff of settling the conflict. \u201d Russia is the lead host of the talks in the Kazakh capital, with support from Turkey and Iran. Over the last week, Turkey and Russia have also invited the United States and the United Nations to attend the Astana negotiations.'"}, "time": 1742563145.5223987}
