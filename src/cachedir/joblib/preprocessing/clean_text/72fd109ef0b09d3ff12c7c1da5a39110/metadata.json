In the days since Britain voted to leave the bloc, the movement\u2019s leaders have often appeared as if they had not expected to win and were not prepared to cope with the consequences. Faced with the scope of the decision, they have been busy walking back promises they made during the campaign and scaling back expectations. They have failed to show a united front or to answer basic questions. Their faltering performance has added to the sense of political chaos in Britain and, arguably, to the turmoil in the financial markets. And it has undercut their credibility and authority as Mr. Johnson prepares his bid to become prime minister and lead Britain into a new relationship with the Continent. The stakes are high for Mr. Johnson in particular, as he tries to build an impression as a capable leader amid the chaos that followed the vote in favor of a British exit, or \u201cBrexit. \u201d But the mixed signals coming from him and other proponents of leaving the European Union have left their intentions unclear on such basic issues as when and how they will seek to negotiate a withdrawal, and what kind of new arrangement they want. To the degree that they have signaled a direction, it has often been substantially different from what they promised during the campaign. On issues from immigration to spending on the National Health Service, the \u201cLeave\u201d coalition has retreated from its more populist and apparently exaggerated claims. Many of those assertions had been promoted by the   U. K. Independence Party, or UKIP, led by Nigel Farage, and benefited the broader Leave campaign, whose most prominent figures included two senior Conservatives, Mr. Johnson and Michael Gove, the justice minister. In changing their tune, the leaders of the   Union campaign risk undermining whatever trust they had earned from the millions who voted to leave the bloc in the expectation that immigration would be cut sharply and that money now going to the European Union  \u2014   which the Leave campaign said was 350 million pounds, or $465 million, a week  \u2014   would be available to help finance the National Health Service. For example, one Leave advocate, Iain Duncan Smith, a former Conservative Party leader and cabinet secretary, walked away from the campaign pledge to reallocate the \u00a3350 million a week to the health service. Instead, he said, \u201cthe lion\u2019s share\u201d of anything left from that amount after replacing subsidies from the bloc to British farmers could be available for health services. On immigration, too, there was immediate backtracking from Mr. Johnson and Daniel Hannan, a member of the European Parliament from the Conservative Party, who told the BBC, \u201cFrankly, if people watching think that they have voted and there is now going to be zero immigration from the E. U. they are going to be disappointed. \u201d Analysts say the change in tone may be necessary to begin reeling in unrealistic expectations about the changes the referendum could produce, but it also holds considerable political peril for Mr. Johnson and other Conservative Party leaders of the Leave campaign, especially with populist sentiment spreading and   groups like the U. K. Independence Party eager to build support. \u201cThere is a clear tension between what the voter wanted and what senior euroskeptic leaders want to produce,\u201d said Matthew Goodwin, a professor of politics and international relations at the University of Kent. \u201cIf they don\u2019t deliver radical reforms on immigration, it would be the equivalent of pouring gasoline on the populist UKIP fire that has been burning since 2010. \u201d In his regular column in The Daily Telegraph on Monday, Mr. Johnson tried to strike a prime ministerial tone of unity in the wake of the divisive referendum, but he emphasized continuity over change and tried to argue that immigration, clearly the primary motivation for many voters in taking a position against Europe, was somehow not a major issue. \u201cIt is said that those who voted Leave were mainly driven by anxieties about immigration,\u201d Mr. Johnson wrote. \u201cI do not believe that is so. \u201d Suggesting that he wants to keep some kind of open flow of people across the border with Europe, Mr. Johnson wrote, \u201cBritish people will still be able to go and work in the E. U. to live to travel to study to buy homes and to settle down. \u201d Not only that, he asserted, \u201cThere will continue to be free trade, and access to the single market. \u201d What he described was a relationship with the European Union like that of Norway, which would allow freedom of movement and labor and would pay money to Brussels in return for access to the single market, but without having a voice in  . But Mr. Johnson rejected the Norway model during the campaign, and even if negotiations proved to lead to a slightly enhanced Norway, with some symbolic measures to restrict immigration of European Union citizens to Britain, the result would be a betrayal of those who voted Leave. And right now, Norway pays Brussels roughly per capita what Britain currently does as a full member. \u201cThe difficulty for Boris and Gove is that Brexit feels like a column gone wrong, an academic exercise suddenly turned into reality,\u201d Paul Waugh wrote in his blog for The Huffington Post, alluding to the shared backgrounds in journalism of Mr. Johnson and Mr. Gove. \u201cAnd reality, particularly where the E. U. is concerned, is a messy, complex thing. \u201d Mr. Johnson is clearly looking to unite the divided Conservative Party behind his own, flamboyant self and to burnish his   economic credentials. But playing down immigration, Mr. Goodwin said, could create more political trouble. \u201cI worry for senior euroskeptic leaders, because there is a misunderstanding of the vote, and that will feed voter dissatisfaction,\u201d he said, driving many of the voters who chose a British exit to turn away from both mainstream parties and move to the populist right. The referendum was unusual, because it pitted a government on one side, \u201cRemain,\u201d against a loose coalition on the other, made up of Conservatives, some Labour legislators and U. K. Independence Party supporters. The Leave side never had to hammer out an agreement on how to proceed if it won, said Tony Travers, a professor of government at the London School of Economics. \u201cThere was no coherence, because it wasn\u2019t a political party fighting for government, but an odd coalition fighting against something, but with no consistent view of what it was fighting for,\u201d he said. Even on the economy, the Leave side was made of   economists who believe in no tariffs at all, those who believe in trade deals and protectionists who want to shield the declining working class against globalization, Professor Travers said. \u201cAnd now the government will have to be reformed as if it were representing the Leave side and yet represent both, a   government that must reflect the schism in itself,\u201d he said. In the aftermath of the Leave campaign\u2019s victory, the political editor for Sky News, Faisal Islam, asked a Conservative member of Parliament who supported leaving the bloc to see his camp\u2019s plan. The legislator replied, according to Mr. Islam: \u201cThere is no plan. The Leave campaign don\u2019t have a   plan. \u201d Then the legislator added, \u201cNumber 10 should have had a plan,\u201d referring to the prime minister\u2019s office.'"}, "time": 1742561624.4898572}
