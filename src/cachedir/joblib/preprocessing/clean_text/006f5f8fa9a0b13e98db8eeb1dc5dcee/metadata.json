Bush and Barack Obama. [His attack in Monday\u2019s New York Times on White House adviser (and former Breitbart News chair) Steve Bannon, however, does a disservice to the public policy debate about national security strategy.  Adm. Mullen objects to Bannon\u2019s appointment to the National Security Council (NSC). He admits, however, that President Bush\u2019s NSC \u201cwas arranged similarly to Mr. Trump\u2019s,\u201d albeit with the exclusion of political guru Karl Rove. He also admits President Obama included his own political adviser, David Axelrod, in NSC meetings  \u2014   even though Axelrod had no military or foreign policy experience whatsoever (and close ties to the   left and Chicago\u2019s corrupt Democratic machine). In addition, Adm. Mullen complains about \u201cMr. Bannon\u2019s troubling public positions. \u201d Adm.  does not list which positions he means  \u2014   hoping, perhaps, that the false innuendos of mainstream media attacks will fill in the blanks for the Times\u2018 readers. USA Today recently reviewed hundreds of hours of Bannon\u2019s radio commentaries and found none of the racism, antisemitism or \u201cwhite nationalism\u201d that the Times, among others, falsely ascribed to him. All it found was that Bannon worried about the threats posed by Islam and China. Those are threats most Americans also take seriously  \u2014   and which, presumably, Adm. Mullen did as well. Where Adm. Mullen\u2019s argument really begins to take on water is when he worries that Bannon\u2019s presence would disrupt what is supposed to be a \u201cnonpartisan\u201d institution. It is hard to imagine a more partisan security apparatus than that which emerged on Adm. Mullen\u2019s watch, when the military undertook   changes such as the end of \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell. \u201d And though generals asked for more troops in Afghanistan, the president gave them less than they needed  \u2014   along with a   timeline that ended, conveniently, in time Obama\u2019s  . And the disastrous 2011 pullout from Iraq flew in the face of Adm. Mullen\u2019s own recommendation to Congress, in 2007, that success required a   commitment there. Bannon\u2019s official job title is not political adviser, but \u201cChief Strategist. \u201d That undoubtedly involves some political advice, but it also points to a role in maintaining the coherence of Trump administration policies. That is crucial in a White House led by a political outsider with a   mandate for change. Bannon\u2019s own naval experience, and his immersion in history and foreign policy, qualify him for the role. And speaking as his former colleague at Breitbart News, I can testify to his   in moments of crisis. I feel more secure knowing Steve is advising our president  \u2014   and I believe others should, as well. In a \u201cdisruptive\u201d presidency, he is a stabilizing influence, as he was on the campaign trail. President Trump seems to agree. Adm. Mullen says he worries about \u201ca blurring of presidential responsibilities  \u2014   Republican Party leader and commander in chief. \u201d But the Constitution recognizes no such distinction, and the time for worrying about that began in January 2009, when for the first time, the U. S. military was led by a    who placed his own political fortunes ahead of the safety and security of the American people. The morning after the Benghazi attacks in 2012, for example, President Obama flew to Las Vegas for a political fundraiser. None of his predecessors  \u2014   not even President Jimmy Carter  \u2014   would have done that. President Trump, like his predecessors, deserves to choose his team, and a leader of Adm. Mullen\u2019s stature should not lend his name to partisan and evidently misinformed attacks. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.
