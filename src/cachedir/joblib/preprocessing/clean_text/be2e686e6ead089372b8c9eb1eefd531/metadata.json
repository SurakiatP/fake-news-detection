Some remarkable images from the Venezuelan protests have emerged, including the video of a Venezuelan National Guard armored vehicle driving into a crowd of protesters. Another striking image shows a protester set on fire after the gas tank of a police motorcycle exploded:  These photos capture the scale of the demonstrations:  Here is an image that captures the painted shields protesters have been creating: Numerous injuries from tear gas used by the police have been reported  \u2026       \u2026     while protesters have equipped themselves with gas masks, and used firebombs against the police.  The latest fatalities include university federation president Juan Lopez, 33, gunned down by an unknown assailant at a meeting in El Tigre, and a    police officer shot during demonstrations in Carabobo. The Associated Press counts at least 37 deaths, 700 injuries, and 1, 000 arrests. Also from the Associated Press comes news that classical music maestro Gustavo Dudamel, one of Venezuela\u2019s biggest celebrities, has spoken out against the socialist government of Nicolas Maduro. Dudamel has previously been criticized as too close to Maduro. \u201cWe must stop ignoring the just cry of the people suffocated by an intolerable crisis. Democracy cannot be built to fit the needs of a particular government or otherwise it would cease to be a democracy,\u201d Dudamel wrote in an essay entitled \u201cI Raise My Voice. \u201d \u201cWe owe our youth a hopeful world, a country where we can walk freely in dissent, in respect, in tolerance, in dialogue and in which dreams have room to build the Venezuela we all yearn for. It is time to listen to the people: Enough is Enough,\u201d Dudamel added. The AP reports that his essay was dedicated to    musician Armando Canizales, who was killed during a demonstration on Wednesday. Supporters of jailed opposition leader Leopoldo L\u00f3pez held a vigil outside the Ramo Verde jail on Thursday night, following rumors that he had either died or been taken seriously ill. L\u00f3pez\u2019s wife Lilian Tintori claimed that a video message sent on Wednesday testifying to his good health was \u201cfalse,\u201d insisting that \u201cthe only proof of life that we will accept is to see Leopoldo. \u201d On Friday, L\u00f3pez\u2019s father and sister also expressed doubts about the veracity of the video evidence provided by the ruling party to prove L\u00f3pez is healthy. \u201cWe have big doubts about this video and we don\u2019t accept it as proof of him being alive,\u201d his sister Diana L\u00f3pez said. The L\u00f3pez family\u2019s lawyers wrote to the International Committee of the Red Cross asking it to verify his health and whereabouts through \u201cdirect personal contact. \u201d The lawyers also said they would ask for the Spanish government to launch   prosecutions against Venezuelan officials, beginning with the cases two imprisoned Spanish nationals.'"}, "time": 1742561729.7797608}
