In Las Vegas last weekend, voters were still waiting outside a polling place in a Mexican grocery store two hours after it was set to close. In New York City on Election Day, voters who spilled out of polling sites snaked through schoolyards and around entire city blocks. There are two ways to interpret these scenes. \u201cIt does give some indication of the health of our democracy that you have all these people who are excited enough to vote that they\u2019ll wait in a long line,\u201d said Stephen Pettigrew, a Ph. D. candidate in Harvard\u2019s department of government who studies polling lines. \u201cBut it\u2019s also an indication, at least in some areas, that there is a problem. \u201d One problem is that some groups are much more likely to face long lines than others. Another, according to Mr. Pettigrew\u2019s research on recent elections, is that the people who do wait are less likely to vote in the future as a result. Early voters, urban voters and minority voters are all more likely to wait and wait and wait. In predominantly minority communities, the lines are about twice as long as in predominantly white ones, Mr. Pettigrew has found. And minority voters are six times as likely as whites to wait longer than an hour to vote. Those disparities have persisted even within the same town or county, suggesting they don\u2019t reflect simply the greater difficulty of putting on elections in populous cities. \u201cThat means members of minority communities are forgoing wages they\u2019re having to juggle child and family care and all sorts of other things that white voters don\u2019t have to do,\u201d said Charles Stewart III, an M. I. T. political scientist. (In a presidential election, he has estimated, all this waiting nationwide adds up to a billion dollars in lost wages.) Voting essentially costs people more in minority communities, and that also makes them particularly susceptible to the long wait\u2019s other effect. Mr. Pettigrew\u2019s research suggests that for each hour   voters wait, their probability of voting in the next election drops by one percentage point. That may not sound like a lot, but Mr. Pettigrew estimates that this means 200, 000 people didn\u2019t vote in 2014 because of the lines they encountered in 2012 (and that\u2019s accounting for the lower turnout we\u2019d expect in a midterm election). Even the most effective     tactics budge turnout by only three or four percentage points, at best. So long lines are a relatively powerful way to influence behavior. In concerns over minority turnout in particular, the public\u2019s focus has fallen much more on the consequences of stricter voter ID laws and fewer early voting days. But long lines can have a similar effect, depressing turnout too. Mr. Pettigrew, whose data also shows that predominantly white precincts tend to receive more voting machines and poll workers, doesn\u2019t argue that these patterns necessarily prove discrimination. Election officials may have reacted slowly, for example, to shifting dynamics in who votes. Historically, white turnout has been higher than black turnout  \u2014   a pattern broken for the first time in 2012. But regardless of whether party officials are actively trying to depress minority turnout  \u2014   a question litigated extensively over the last several years as the Supreme Court has weakened the Voting Rights Act  \u2014   the effective outcome of these disparities matters. \u201cI can understand long lines randomly appearing in places because of weird idiosyncratic forces,\u201d Mr. Pettigrew said. \u201cI think it\u2019s not O. K. for there to be this systematic pattern in certain areas of long lines. \u201d For the vast majority of voters, this issue never arises. In 2012, voters waited an average of about 14 minutes to cast a ballot. Only about 5 percent waited longer than an hour. But that small fraction, in a presidential election, is several million voters. Those voters might be deterred in the future for several reasons. As the costs of voting rise, research suggests, people are less likely to do so. And many of us vote not because we think we\u2019ll cast the deciding ballot, but for the civic experience  \u2014   the chance to get that sticker, to join in the communal exercise, to feel patriotic. If the experience itself (or the customer service around it) is unpleasant, that undercuts one of the main reasons to do it. Mr. Stewart\u2019s own surveys also show that people who wait longer to vote have less confidence that their votes are counted accurately. As a result, long waits may signal to voters that the entire election system is flawed. Just as unfair traffic stops can test faith in the criminal justice system, dysfunctional lines may undermine belief in American elections. And so why vote next time? In North Carolina, where a federal court struck down voting restrictions that it said targeted blacks with \u201calmost surgical precision,\u201d there were reports this election of black voters who encountered long lines and gave up. \u201cIn America, we have heightened awareness about racial disparities,\u201d Mr. Stewart said. \u201cAnd isn\u2019t it really sad to say here\u2019s yet another area in which the racial disparities exist, particularly in light of the fact that one of the top goals of   political activism for a century has been access to the poll. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563819.276217}
