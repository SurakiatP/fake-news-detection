[\u201cDuring the Obama administration, the Division served purely ideological ends with rigidity unmatched in other federal offices. Entrenched federal bureaucrats jettisoned precepts like equal enforcement in favor of political and racialized dogmas with a zeal that risks litigation failure and invites court sanctions,\u201d the letter states.  Signed by such conservative heavyweights as Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, the letter paints a picture of a Division ripe for sweeping reform after eight years under Obama during which \u201cThe Civil Rights Division has relegated its leadership role to political activists. \u201d Hiring practices for the career staff of the Division is one of the letter\u2019s chief concerns. While Tom Perez, now head of the Democratic National Committee, was the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, the Division was the subject of an Inspector General\u2019s review that found the Obama Justice Department\u2019s insistence that   have a \u201cdemonstrated commitment to civil rights\u201d led to a perception only   activists need apply. \u201cIn this case, perception and reality were synonymous,\u201d the letter insists, noting instances in which Division employees leaked confidential information to civil rights groups, and Perez\u2019s subsequent refusal to implement any of the report\u2019s hiring recommendations. Also among the letter\u2019s complaints is the alleged culture of politically motivated bullying that was fostered during the Obama years. The same Inspector General\u2019s Report found a pattern of personal attacks against, for example, employees who were \u201copenly Christian. \u201d J. Christian Adams, President of the Public Interest Legal Foundation and a signatory of the letter, added, \u201cFor years, a radicalized Civil Rights Division   advanced leftists causes with respect to voting, law enforcement, immigration, and others while constitutional Rule of Law was considered a nuisance. General Sessions has an opportunity to begin the course correction necessary to protect all Americans from civil rights abuses. \u201d In picking a new head for the Civil Rights Division, the letter\u2019s signatories hope Attorney General Sessions will look for a reformer prepared to return to   civil rights enforcement and tackle the Division\u2019s entrenched cultural problems. \u201cThe next AAG certainly cannot be a proponent of the status quo by any means,\u201d they say.'"}, "time": 1742561627.684855}
