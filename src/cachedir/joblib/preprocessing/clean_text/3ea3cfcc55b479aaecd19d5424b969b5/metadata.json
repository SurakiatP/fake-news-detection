And now two electors have launched a last-minute effort to convince their colleagues to abandon the president-elect. \\n\u201cThis is a long shot. It\u2019s a hail Mary,\u201d Bret Chiafolo, a Washington state elector who previously pledged not to vote for Clinton, told Politico Monday. \u201cHowever, I do see situations where \u2014 when we\u2019ve already had two or three [Republican] electors state publicly they didn\u2019t want to vote for Trump. How many of them have real issues with Donald Trump in private?\u201d\\nChiafolo along with Colorado elector Micheal Baca have launched what they call a \u201cmoral electors\u201d movement in hopes of convincing 37 of their Republican colleagues to deny Trump their votes. Should they succeed in their radical effort, the presidential decision would be thrown to the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.\\n[\u2026]\\nThe Electoral College consists of 538 members who are expected to convene in their respective state capitals on Dec. 19 to formally vote for the next president\u2026 Baca said he hopes the move launches a serious national discussion about abolishing the Electoral College , which would require either a constitutional amendment or legislation in several states.\\nThe speculation is that if this maneuver were to be successful, the GOP-led Congress could be persuaded not to choose Hillary, but to write-in a selection for a party loyalist \u2013 like Mitt Romney or John Kasich\u2026 maybe even a Bush.\\nOf course, there have also been reports that Team Hillary has been hard at work attempting to persuade electors to switch their votes in the hope, however desperate, that they can still flip the election and take the White House:\\nOn December 19, the Electors of the Electoral College will cast their ballots. If they all vote the way their states voted, Donald Trump will win. However, they can vote for Hillary Clinton if they choose. Even in states where that is not allowed, their vote would still be counted, they would simply pay a small fine \u2013 which we can be sure Clinton supporters will be glad to pay! \\nWe are calling on the Electors to ignore their states\u2019 votes and cast their ballots for Secretary Clinton. Why? Mr. Trump is unfit to serve.\\nThe larger issue here is that the system is badly broken, the people are harshly divided along demographic and political lines, and the future is gambling on extreme versions of itself \u2013 larger than life candidates, and bizarre back-door maneuvers in attempt to hack the system and bend it in one direction or another.\\nTrump has taken his place on the stage in a thunderous revolt of the people, but his legacy will be tested out the gates by the heavy pressures of Washington lobbyists, intrigue on the part of political insiders and the cults of opposition that are springing up in response to his controversial journey to the White House.\\nThe entire political establishment have been knocked off their perch, though their hold on power has not necessarily been loosened.\\nA whole new era is born, and it remains to be seen how it will play out.\\nRead more: \\nIt\u2019s Not Over Yet: \u201cThey Are Probably Still Trying To Steal The Election\u201d | Calls For Electoral College To Ignore Will Of People \\nClinton Insider Confesses: Trump Protests Are Just More Pre-Paid \u201cSoros Riots\u201d to Stir Unrest \\n\u201cBeware of the Shadow Government\u201d: Ron Paul Advises President-Elect \\nTrump Surrounded By Bankers, Wall St. Insiders Banging on the Door to Get In: \u201cDraining the Swamp?\u201d \\n\u201cViolent Revolution If Trump Lets Them Down\u201d: People Remain Poised for Angry Revolt \u2013 Roberts '"}, "time": 1742561652.9470243}
