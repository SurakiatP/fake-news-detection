[The Independent reports that Boeing will soon be testing   planes, possibly utilizing artificial intelligence to make decisions usually left up to human pilots. Boeing\u2019s aim is to develop an aircraft that can operate entirely with minimal human interaction. Planes can already take off, cruise, and land without much interaction from human pilots, so the idea of a fully functioning artificial   plane is not too far fetched.  Mike Sinnett, Boeing\u2019s vice president of product development, told Reuters, \u201cWhen I look at the future I see a need for you know 41, 000 commercial jet airplanes over the course of the next 20 years. And that means we\u2019re going to need something like six hundred and seventeen thousand more pilots. That\u2019s a lot of pilots. \u201d He continued to say, \u201cso one of the ways that may be solved is by having some type of autonomous behaviour and that could be anything from taking instead of five pilots on a long haul flight down to three or two, taking two pilots down to one in a freight situation, or in some cases going from one to none. \u201d \u201cSo one of the ways that may be solved is by having some type of autonomous behaviour and that could be anything from taking instead of five pilots on a long haul flight down to three or two, taking two pilots down to one in a freight situation, or in some cases going from one to none,\u201d he explained. Starting this summer, Boeing will use advanced cockpit simulators used in the training of pilots to test the new   technology before implementing it in an actual aircraft. Boeing isn\u2019t the only airplane manufacturer looking at automated travel: Airbus is currently working on   flying cars and will be testing   flying taxis by the end of 2017 with the aim of rolling out further access to the taxis in 2021. Airbus, however, is looking to develop an     system while Boeing seems to be focusing on long haul, large passenger flights.
