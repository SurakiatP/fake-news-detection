(Photo illustraion 21WIRE) \\nFBI October Surprise? \\nAccording to reports , in a letter written today, FBI Director James Comey , stated that the FBI has begun a new probe into Hillary Clinton related emails once again. Comey offered scant details about the new probe, but due to an unrelated case, additional classified material may have been mishandled on Clinton\u2019s personal email server. \\nCNBC reported the latest FBI developments, including a passage from Comey\u2019s letter discussing the new investigation: \\n\u201cIn previous congressional testimony, I referred to the fact that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had completed its investigation of former Secretary Clinton\u2019s personal email server. Due to recent developments, I am writing to supplement my previous testimony,\u201d Comey wrote. \\nIn connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation. I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation,\u201d he added. \\nAlthough the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant, and I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work, I believe it is important to update your Committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony,\u201d Comey concluded.\u201d \\nHuma\u2019s Estranged \u2018Sexting\u2019 Husband \\nAccording to a new report released via The New York Times : \\n\u201cThe presidential campaign was rocked on Friday after federal law enforcement officials said that emails pertinent to the now-closed investigation into Hillary Clinton \u2019s private email server were discovered on a computer belonging to Anthony D. Weiner, the estranged husband of a top Clinton aide.\u201d \u201c In a letter to Congress , the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, said the emails had surfaced in an unrelated case, which law enforcement officials said was an F.B.I. investigation into illicit text messages from Mr. Weiner to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. Mr. Weiner, a former Democratic congressman from New York, is married to Huma Abedin, the top aide.\u201d Comey has come under fire recently for apparently letting Clinton off the hook for mishandling, and lying to Congress, about classified emails coming through her \u2018home brew\u2019 email server while she was Secretary of State. After previously closing the case, Comey has done a U-turn and is now saying the FBI will review the new emails to for classified information, and see whether it was mishandled. \\nThis unprecedented investigative move comes just two days after a Wikileaks docu-dump revealed a memo containing detailed financial information between Clinton Foundation donors and former president Bill Clinton \u2018s private financial activities. Among those included in the memo, was a $30 million dollar business arrangement under \u201cBill Clinton, Inc.,\u201d with another $66 million dollar deal scheduled over nine years. \\nThe following is a tweet from Brad Jaffy of NBC Nightly News containing the new FBI recommendation\u2026 \\nThe new investigation into the Clinton camp will most certainly spark new \u2018Pay-to-Play\u2019 allegations , as the new FBI revelations also comes days after a Project Veritas hidden camera sting operation revealed that the Democratic consultant Robert Creamer of Democracy Partners, discussed ways to commit \u2018large-scale\u2019 voter fraud as well as paying political agitators to cause violence at Donald Trump rallies. Out of Creamer\u2019s 342 visits to the White House, also included his wife, a 9-term Illinois Democratic congresswoman, Jan Schakowsky some 47 times. White House visitor records show that Schakowsky took 47 \u201cprivate meetings with Obama or his senior staff,\u201d also over the past year. The consultancy Democracy Partners appears to have applied Schakowsky as a political buffering point, possibly in the event of a fallout over their operations at a grassroots level. The impetus of this type of procedural separation is to keep certain high-ranking officials of the hook in case of a massive upheaval over various underhanded campaign tactics \u2013 thus giving a political campaign or political entity plausible deniability. \u2018CAUGHT ON FILM\u2019 \u2013 Robert Creamer resigns over a massive Democratic Party controversy.

(Image Source new republic ) It remains unclear what exactly reopened the new Clinton probe, but perhaps the FBI had its own cobwebs to clear out after it was revealed that a longtime Clinton associate , Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe , \u201chelped steer $675,000 to the election campaign of the wife of an FBI official who went on to lead the probe into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email system, according to a report.\u201d The NY Post also reported on the matter this past week: \\n\u201cThe political action committee of McAuliffe, the Clinton loyalist, gave $467,500 to the state Senate campaign of the wife of Andrew McCabe, who is now deputy director of the FBI, according to the Wall Street Journal . \\nThe report states Jill McCabe received an additional $207,788 from the Virginia Democratic Party, which is heavily influenced by McAuliffe. \\nThe money directed by McAuliffe began flowing two months after the FBI investigation into Clinton began in July 2015. Around that time, the candidate\u2019s husband was promoted from running the Washington field office for the FBI to the No. 3 position at the bureau.\u201d \\nIn a CNN report from October 18th, a week before the McAuliffe revelations, \u201c\u2026According to notes from interviews conducted during an FBI investigation into Clinton\u2019s email practices, Undersecretary of State Patrick Kennedy personally tried to convince FBI officials that the email should be declassified. One interviewee described feeling \u201cpressured\u201d by another FBI official at Kennedy\u2019s request.\u201d \\nThe newly reopened FBI investigation into Clinton could be related to all or some of the items listed above, but there\u2019s no doubt that due to public backlash the FBI received following the first Clinton investigation, in addition to concerns over dealings between the FBI and Clinton associates \u2013 the agency needed to save face. \\nIt remains to be seen how new case will impact the US Presidential election. \\nMore from RT below\u2026 '"}, "time": 1742561776.587669}
