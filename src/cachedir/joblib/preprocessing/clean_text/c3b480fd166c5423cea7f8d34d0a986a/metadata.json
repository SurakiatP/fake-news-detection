But that does not mean he is ready to give up the   part just yet. Although Mr. Trump is not starring in NBC\u2019s coming season of \u201cThe New Celebrity Apprentice,\u201d the   is still involved: Mr. Trump will be credited as one of the show\u2019s executive producers, a spokeswoman for Mark Burnett, the creator of the \u201cApprentice\u201d franchise, said on Thursday. MGM, Mr. Burnett\u2019s studio, declined to comment on what the   would be paid for his participation in the new season, which will feature Arnold Schwarzenegger as the show\u2019s   businessman. But in the past, Mr. Trump has held as much as a 50 percent stake in \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d and received payments from the show\u2019s international editions and a   version that starred Martha Stewart. \u201cMr. Trump has a big stake in the show and conceived of it with Mark Burnett,\u201d Hope Hicks, the  \u2019s spokeswoman, said on Thursday. Ms. Hicks confirmed that she was referring to a financial stake. For an incoming president whose business holdings have already drawn ethical scrutiny, Mr. Trump\u2019s continuing involvement with \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d could spawn a new round of questions about conflicts of interest. For NBC, which nurtured Mr. Trump\u2019s celebrity until he left the show in 2015 to pursue a presidential bid, the fact that the   stands to profit from the program could raise concerns about how a politically polarized audience may react to one of its biggest   shows. Mr. Schwarzenegger\u2019s first episode airs on Jan. 2, and major companies, including Trident gum, Welch\u2019s, and Carnival Cruise Line, have signed on as sponsors. NBC declined to comment on Mr. Trump\u2019s producing credit, which was first reported by Variety. Mr. Trump, for months, has shown a keen interest in how Mr. Schwarzenegger, a former governor of California, bodybuilder and actor, might perform as host, asking friends and even campaign crowds, \u201cHow do you think Arnold\u2019s going to do?\u201d During an interview in May about his history with \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d Mr. Trump made clear that he remained invested in the program, emotionally and otherwise. \u201cYou know I have a big chunk of that show, going forever,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cMark and I did it together. We were   partners. \u201d The   and Mr. Burnett are on good terms, even though the producer issued a statement in October denouncing Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy, referring to \u201cthe hatred, division and misogyny that has been a very unfortunate part of his campaign. \u201d This week, Mr. Burnett met privately with Mr. Trump and suggested ideas for his inauguration, including a helicopter ride from New York to Washington and a parade on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. During the interview in May, Mr. Trump said that he had not spoken to Mr. Schwarzenegger about the program. \u201cI don\u2019t know how he is going to do,\u201d Mr. Trump said, \u201cbut I hope he does well. \u201d \u201cWe tried to do it with Martha Stewart,\u201d Mr. Trump added, \u201cand that didn\u2019t get the ratings, to put it mildly. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563397.6247687}
