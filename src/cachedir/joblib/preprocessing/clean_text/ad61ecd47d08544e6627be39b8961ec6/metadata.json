Throughout the interview, Newt Gingrich seemed to live in an alternate state of reality. He continued to discount polls that show Trump losing badly. He refused to acknowledge that all the tossup states are moving towards Clinton. \\nThe interview was already contentious when a couple of words from Megyn Kelly turned it explosive. (Video here .) \\n\"You want to know why Trump has had a rough time?\" Newt Gingrich asked. \\n\"If Trump is a sexual predator,\" Megyn Kelly said. \"That is ...\" - Advertisement - \\n\"He is not a sexual predator,\" Newt Gingrich shouted. \\n\"That\\'s your opinion,\" Kelly said. \"I am not taking a position on it.\" \\n\"You could not defend that statement,\" an unhinged Gingrich shouted. \"Now I am sick and tired of people like you, using language that\\'s inflammatory, that\\'s not true.\" \\n\"Excuse me Mr. Speaker,\" Kelly interjected. \"You have no idea whether it is true or not. What we know is that at least ...\" \\n\"Neither do you,\" Gingrich shouted. - Advertisement - \\n\"That\\'s right,\" Kelly replied. \"And I am not taking a position on it unlike you. So what I said is incorrect?\" \\n\"Yes you are,\" Gingrich replied. \"When you use the words you took a position. And that is very unfair of you Megyn. I think that is exactly the bias people are upset by.\" \\n\"I think that your defensiveness on this may speak volumes, sir,\" Kelly replied. \"What I said is if -- no, no, no, -- let me make my point and then I will give you the floor. What I said is if Trump is a sexual predator, then it is a big story. And what we saw on that tape was Trump himself saying that he likes to grab women by the genitals and kiss them against their will. That\\'s what we saw. Then we saw ten women come forward after he denied actually doing it at the debate to say that was untrue. \\'He did it to me. He did it to me.\\' We saw reporters. We saw people who had worked with him; people from Apprentice and so on and so forth. He denies it all, which is his right. We don\\'t know what the truth is. My point to you is, as a media story we don\\'t get to say the ten women are lying. We have to cover that story, sir.\" \\nGingrich then went into full spin mode. He attempted to characterize the media as biased for covering more about the growing Trump sexual predator scandal than Clinton speeches to banks, a false equivalency. He then unleashed his anger and abuse again.'"}, "time": 1742564207.417816}
