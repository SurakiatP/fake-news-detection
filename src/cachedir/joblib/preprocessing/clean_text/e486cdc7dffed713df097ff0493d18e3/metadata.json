Mr. Thompson said in a statement that his chief assistant, Eric Gonzalez, would take over as interim district attorney during \u201cthe absences occasioned\u201d his \u201ctreatment and recovery. \u201d \u201cAs a man of intense faith, I intend to fight and win the battle against this disease,\u201d Mr. Thompson said. \u201cI humbly seek your sincere prayers as I confront this challenge and respectfully ask that you honor my family\u2019s need and wish for privacy during this time. \u201d Mr. Thompson has been absent from his office for about two months, and had received the cancer diagnosis around August, according to colleagues who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Neither his spokesmen nor several of his friends would disclose what type of cancer Mr. Thompson has. The news of his illness comes three years after he was elected, becoming Brooklyn\u2019s first black district attorney. He defeated Charles J. Hynes, an incumbent of more than 20 years who had been weakened by accusations of favoritism toward political supporters in Brooklyn\u2019s Orthodox Jewish community, and of allegations of   improprieties. Mr. Thompson, 50, a Democrat, had previously had a successful private law practice he represented Nafissatou Diallo, a Manhattan hotel housekeeper who, in 2011, accused the French politician Dominique   of sexually assaulting her in a case that was eventually dropped by the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office. Mr. Thompson had also worked as a federal prosecutor in Brooklyn and delivered a memorable opening argument at the trial of Justin Volpe, a police officer who pleaded guilty in 1999 to torturing a Haitian immigrant, Abner Louima, with a broken broomstick in a Brooklyn station house. Having run on an agenda of reform and racial justice, Mr. Thompson, once in office, earned a reputation as both an advocate for minority communities in a section of the city known for its divisions between black and white residents and, simultaneously, as a tough   officer who concentrated on cracking down on gun crimes and violent street gangs. Brushing aside the resistance of the New York Police Department, he announced in July 2014 that his office would stop prosecuting most   marijuana arrests. He also put in place an amnesty program for people with outstanding warrants. Among his   efforts was the creation of one of the country\u2019s most robust internal units dedicated to reviewing wrongful convictions, which in the past two years has exonerated 20 defendants. Perhaps the biggest case of his tenure was the prosecution of Peter Liang, a former police officer who was found guilty in February of manslaughter in the shooting of an unarmed black man, Akai Gurley, in the stairwell of a Brooklyn housing project. The shooting, which took place just days before a Staten Island grand jury elected not to indict an officer involved in the choking death of Eric Garner, placed enormous pressure on Mr. Thompson, who had to balance his campaign promises to Brooklyn\u2019s black neighborhoods with his close working relationship with the Police Department. Though he did not shy away from mounting an aggressive case against Mr. Liang, after the trial was over Mr. Thompson decided, in Solomonic fashion, to seek no prison time for the former officer, a move that enraged Mr. Gurley\u2019s family and led to bitter protests by   reform activists. One took place early in the morning outside Mr. Thompson\u2019s home in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn. For weeks, Mr. Thompson\u2019s illness had been a closely guarded secret, known only to a small circle of friends and associates. On Tuesday, public officials such as Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo issued statements wishing him well. In an email on Tuesday, Douglas H. Wigdor, the   of Mr. Thompson\u2019s private practice, said, \u201cAs Ken\u2019s former partner for over 15 years, I have no doubt that he will tackle his illness with the same determination that he has shared with his clients, the people of Brooklyn and, most importantly, his family. \u201d Another close friend, Arnold N. Kriss, a lawyer who has served as an adviser to Mr. Thompson over the years, said: \u201cKen is doing a remarkable job rebuilding the Brooklyn D. A.\u2019s office. There is no doubt he will successfully continue to fight his illness and, at the same time, fight for the people of Brooklyn. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562324.9371352}
