The audio segments about the state job were widely reported in the 1990\u2019s, however, as other pay-for-play financial scandals have surfaced, the details may warrant revisiting. \\n\\nHere is a transcript of part of the recording: \\nGF \u2013 But anyway, then Wednesday, there was a grievance filed in my office when I got the job by a girl who felt like she should have gotten it, a black girl named (deleted). And they called me as a witness. So I go in and uh, nothing big came of it. It\u2019s just that they were questioning me about how I found out about the job. And I said, \u201cWell, that personnel said it that it was a possibility there would be a position,\u201d and then uh, \u201cthey told me that it would be advertised in the newspaper. And it was and I pursued it from there. \\nBC \u2013 Good for you. \\nGF: Yeah. We had a little bit of a scare recently because she had a spot on an X-ray. And she went and had it checked again and it wasn\u2019t cancer. And it\u2019s been almost, it\u2019ll be two years in May that she\u2019s now diagnosed cancer free. My stepfather has been through two angioplasties, but he\u2019s doing good. And I am, I\u2019m really, Bill what I\u2019m afraid of is that if somebody in the press finds out that I\u2019m working for the state. \\nBC \u2013 Yeah. \\nGF \u2013 They\u2019re going to make a big deal of it. \\nBC \u2013 Yeah. \\nGF \u2013 Well the only thing that concerns me, where I\u2019m, where I\u2019m concerned at this point is the state job. \\nBC \u2013 Yeah. I never thought about that, but as long as you say you\u2019ve just been looking for one, you\u2019d uh, check on it. If they ever asked if you\u2019d talked to me about it, you can say no.'"}, "time": 1742561678.9196756}
