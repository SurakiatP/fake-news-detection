[After playing clips of the interview, host Noah brought out Daily Show correspondent Wolf, who said that seeing someone \u201cso conniving trying to manipulate the American public was disgusting. \u201d  When Noah said he agreed that watching Putin\u2019s responses was indeed disgusting, Wolf said she was referring to Kelly. \u201cLast night on her new show, she acted like she didn\u2019t spend the last 12 years of her life as a soldier in Fox News\u2019 culture war,\u201d Wolf said. The Daily Show then played a clip from Kelly\u2019s NBC show in which she chided the media for its \u201crude behavior\u201d and asked \u201cCan\u2019t we all just get along?\u201d \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry, now we\u2019re all supposed to be friends?\u201d Wolf continued. \u201cNow that you\u2019re NBC you\u2019re acting all peaceful like some sort of Mahatma Blondie?\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s not forget, before she was \u2018NBC News\u2019s Megyn Kelly,\u2019 for over a decade she was \u2018Fox News\u2019s Megyn Kelly,\u2019 basically a pretty,   puppet who Roger Ailes kept trying to put his hand up,\u201d Wolf added, drawing a loud groan from the audience. \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry, she\u2019s on network now and he\u2019s dead, they\u2019re both in better places. \u201d Wolf didn\u2019t let up for the whole segment, blasting Kelly for acting what she described as \u201chigh and mighty\u201d when she told Axios in a recent interview that she only consumes news by print. \u201cSorry Megyn, you\u2019re not the new Barbra Walters, you\u2019re that   guy who just follows the money,\u201d she concluded. Kelly\u2019s contentious interview with Putin at an international economics forum in St. Petersburg  \u2014   in which the pair discussed allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 U. S. presidential election  \u2014   drew mixed reaction from fellow journalists and middling ratings for NBC.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum'"}, "time": 1742561667.6880565}
