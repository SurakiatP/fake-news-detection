The attack\u2019s motive was unclear as of Sunday evening, leaving an anxious nation to wonder whether the anger over recent police shootings had prompted another act of retaliation against officers. What was clearer were the waves of worry that rushed across the United States as sketchy details emerged of a bloody melee Sunday morning on a workaday stretch of highway in Louisiana\u2019s capital  \u2014   a city that had already been rocked by the police shooting on July 5 of a black man, a purported murder plot against the police that was apparently foiled and many racially charged nights of protest and rage. State and local officials speaking at a news conference here on Sunday afternoon did not address whether the law enforcement officers who were killed and wounded  \u2014   three members of the Baton Rouge Police Department and three deputies from the East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office  \u2014   had been lured to the scene. Police officials said the officers had responded to a call about a man carrying a gun. Officials initially believed that other people might have been involved in the attack, but the superintendent of the Louisiana State Police, Col. Michael D. Edmonson, said at a news conference that it was the act of a lone gunman. Some details about the gunman began to emerge late Sunday: Officials identified him as Gavin Long, an   military veteran. According to military records released by the Marine Corps, Mr. Long served as a data network specialist and was a sergeant when he left the Marines in 2010. He enlisted in his hometown, Kansas City, Mo. in 2005, and was deployed to Iraq from June 2008 to January 2009, his records show. They also show a number of commendations, including the Good Conduct Medal. On a social media site registered under the name Gavin Long, a young   man who refers to himself as \u201cCosmo\u201d posted videos and podcasts and shared biographical and personal information that aligned with the information that the authorities had released, so far, about the gunman. In one YouTube video, titled, \u201cProtesting, Oppression and How to Deal with Bullies,\u201d the man discusses the killings of   men at the hands of police officers, including the July 5 death here of Alton B. Sterling, and he advocates a bloody response instead of the protests that the deaths sparked. \u201cOne hundred percent of revolutions, of victims fighting their oppressors,\u201d he said, \u201chave been successful through fighting back, through bloodshed. Zero have been successful just over simply protesting. It doesn\u2019t  \u2014   it has never worked and it never will. You got to fight back. That\u2019s the only way that a bully knows to quit. \u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve got to stand on your rights, just like George Washington did, just like the other white rebels they celebrate and salute did,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s what Nat Turner did. That\u2019s what Malcolm did. You got to stand, man. You got to sacrifice. \u201d In one of a string of podcasts the man posted, titled, \u201cMy Story,\u201d he expounded on the recurrence of the number seven in his life. \u201cMy father was born in 1947. My mother was born in 1957. And I took physical form on   . \u201d Sunday was the man\u2019s 29th birthday. Around the country, political leaders, police officers and activists focused their attention, and their mourning, on the slain officers. They also sought to calm the tensions that welled up this month over the killings of black men by the police and the retaliatory violence directed at officers, including the July 7 killings of five officers in Dallas, carried out by a black man who said he wanted to kill white police officers. Just last week, President Obama was in Dallas for a memorial service, and on Sunday afternoon, he was at the White House, again addressing the nation after an assault on police officers. He said the killings were \u201can attack on all of us. \u201d \u201cWe have our divisions, and they are not new,\u201d he said, noting that the country was probably in store for some heated political speech during the Republican National Convention this week in Cleveland. \u201cEveryone right now focus on words and actions that can unite this country rather than divide it further,\u201d the president said. \u201cWe need to temper our words and open our hearts, all of us. \u201d Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana said, \u201cThe violence, the hatred just has to stop. \u201d Colonel Edmonson said a call came in to police dispatch early Sunday reporting \u201ca guy carrying a weapon\u201d in the vicinity of the Hammond Aire Plaza shopping center on Airline Highway  \u2014   a commercial thoroughfare dotted with carwashes, car dealerships and chain stores that cuts through a leafy residential neighborhood. It is also about a mile from the Baton Rouge Police Department headquarters, where protesters had held numerous rallies since July 5, when the police here fatally shot Mr. Sterling, after a confrontation in front of a convenience store. On Sunday, around 8:40 a. m. law enforcement officers observed the man, wearing all black and holding a rifle, outside a beauty supply store, the colonel said. In the next four minutes, there were reports of shots fired and officers struck, said Colonel Edmonson, whose agency will take the lead on the investigation, helped by local and federal investigators. Mark Clements, who lives near the shopping center, said in a telephone interview that he was in his backyard when he heard shots ring out. \u201cI heard probably 10 to 12 gunshots go off,\u201d he said. \u201cWe heard a bunch of sirens and choppers and everything since then. \u201d Avery Hall, 17, who works at a nearby carwash, said he was on his way to work when the gunfire erupted. \u201cI was about to pull in at about 8:45, and we got caught in the crossfire,\u201d he said. \u201cI heard a lot of gunshots  \u2014   a lot. I saw police ducking and shooting. I stopped and pulled into the Dodge dealership. I got out and heard more gunshots. We ducked. \u201d On the police dispatch radio, a voice could be heard shouting: \u201cShots fired! Officer down! Shots fired. Officer down! Got a city officer down. \u201d Around 8:48 a. m. officers fired at the suspect, killing him, Colonel Edmonson said. On Sunday afternoon, officials said that two of the slain officers were Baton Rouge city police officers, and that the third was from the Sheriff\u2019s Office. One city police officer and two sheriff\u2019s deputies were wounded, including one who was in critical condition. The shooting was the latest episode in a month of violence and extraordinary racial tension in the country. The night after the police shooting of Mr. Sterling, who was selling CDs outside a convenience store here, a black man was killed by the police during a traffic stop in a St. Paul suburb. The next night, five police officers were killed by a gunman in Dallas. Violence against the police, Mr. Edwards said, \u201cdoesn\u2019t address any injustice, perceived or real. \u201d He continued, \u201cIt is just an injustice in and of itself. \u201d Speaking at the news conference, the police chief here, Carl Dabadie Jr. called the shooting \u201csenseless\u201d and asked people to pray for the officers and their families. \u201cWe are going to get through this as a family,\u201d he said, \u201cand we\u2019re going to get through this together. \u201d The police in Baton Rouge had in recent days announced that they were investigating a plot by four people to target police officers, and they cited the threat to explain why their presence at local protests, which had been light at first, had grown heavy. The police said a    was arrested this month after running from a burglary of the Cash American Pawn Shop in Baton Rouge. He and three others, including a    arrested on Friday, were believed to have broken into the pawnshop through the roof. It was unclear whether the burglary was connected to Sunday\u2019s shooting. Chief Dabadie told reporters at the time that the    had told the police \u201cthat the reason the burglary was being done was to harm police officers. \u201d The explanation, however, was met with skepticism on social media sites, where many people believed the report was concocted by the police to justify their militarized response to the protests after the death of Mr. Sterling. \u201cThat was bull  \u2014   it was a scare tactic to calm things down,\u201d Arthur Reed of Stop the Killing, the group that first released the video of Mr. Sterling\u2019s shooting, said on Sunday. \u201cAnd it worked. I ain\u2019t going out there if people are going to be out there trying to kill police. \u201d The intense protests had started to lose steam. Sima Atri, a lawyer who represented some of the protesters who were arrested last weekend, said recently that many protesters were afraid to hit the streets after the authorities\u2019 aggressive approach last weekend, which included nearly 200 arrests. (Nearly 100 charges were dropped on Friday.) A protest on Saturday afternoon attracted fewer than a dozen people, who huddled on the side of the road under a tent to escape the blazing sun and flashed signs at passing cars. They were mostly white the protesters at large demonstrations shortly after Mr. Sterling\u2019s death had been nearly all black. Louisiana has lately taken a harder line to defend its police officers, who this year will become a protected class under the state\u2019s hate crimes law. The killing of the officers on Sunday occurred as hundreds of police officers trained in   tactics braced for protests outside the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Cat Brooks, the   of the Anti   Project, cautioned against criticizing activists after the attack on Sunday in Baton Rouge. \u201cI think anytime that there\u2019s a loss of life  \u2014   black, white, police officer, otherwise  \u2014   it\u2019s cause for us to take a moment and be sad about that life,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think we have to be really careful about where these shootings of police officers steer the conversation. I think it\u2019s absurd to insinuate that a movement that is doing nothing more than demanding that the war on black life come to an end is in any way responsible for these police officers getting shot. \u201d Stephen Loomis, the president of the Cleveland Police Patrolmen\u2019s Association, has urged people not to bring their guns anywhere near Cleveland\u2019s downtown during the convention because officers are in a \u201cheightened state. \u201d In Cleveland on Sunday, Steve Thacker, 57, of Westlake, Ohio, stood in the city\u2019s Public Square holding a semiautomatic    assault rifle  \u2014   allowed under the state\u2019s   law  \u2014   as news broke that several officers had been killed in Baton Rouge. When asked about Mr. Loomis\u2019s comments and the Baton Rouge shooting, Mr. Thacker said that despite the attack, he wanted to make a statement and show that people could continue to openly carry their weapons. \u201cI pose no threat to anyone. I\u2019m an American citizen. I\u2019ve never been in trouble for anything,\u201d said Mr. Thacker, an information technology engineer. \u201cThis is my time to come out and put my two cents\u2019 worth in, albeit that it is a very strong statement. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563696.617483}
