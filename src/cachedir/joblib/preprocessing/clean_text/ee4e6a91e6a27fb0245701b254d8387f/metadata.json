Perhaps unwittingly, former British Prime Minister David Cameron inspired these unfounded expectations. Cameron\u2019s constantly repeated allegations that Russian President Vladimir Putin supported a vote for Brexit made people expect a somewhat softer line on Russia from the new governing team in London who were, after all, supporters of Brexit and opponents of Cameron. \\nWhen Boris Johnson became the new foreign secretary, several MPs were even concerned about him not being \u201ctough enough\u201d with Russia and making \u201cconciliatory\u201d calls to his Russian counterpart, foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. \\nJohnson quickly proved these concerns wrong, issuing a call for protests near the Russian Embassy in London as a way to punish Moscow for its actions in Syria. \u201cThis is something unprecedented in the world of diplomacy,\u201d Alexey Pushkov, former head of the Duma\u2019s committee on international affairs, said in an interview to Vesti FM radio station. \u201cA diplomat calling for non-diplomatic solutions, with popular anger mobilized \u2013 this is something new.\u201d Pushkov also noted Johnson\u2019s tough statement accusing Russia of deliberately killing Syrian civilians with \u201crepeated bombings.\u201d\u201cThey drop one bomb and then they wait for the aid workers to come out pulling the injured from the rubble, and then five minutes later they drop another bomb,\u201d Boris Johnson said in an interview with the tabloid The Sun. \\n\u201cBoris Johnson is showing a flamboyant attitude where it is needed least of all,\u201d Pushkov replied. \\nFor their part, the Russian authorities, disappointed by Johnson, are also changing their tone, trying to drive home to both foreign and domestic audiences the message that they are angry. \\n\u201cDecent people first provide the evidence, and only later they come out with accusations,\u201d said Maria Zakharova, spokesperson for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in response to Johnson\u2019s interview with The Sun. Seeing the bigger picture \\nBoth Johnson and Zakharova have provided plenty of fodder for the media, but all commentary and posturing aside, the decline in Russo-British relations is detrimental not just for the two countries at hand, but also for global security at large. \\n\u201cWe should not forget that the world was once brought to the brink of a nuclear disaster not because of European problems, but because of a conflict over a distant land \u2013 Cuba. When I hear British voices suggesting that NATO forces should impose a no-fly zone over northern Syria by striking at the airfields of the Syrian or Russian air forces in Syria \u2013 I get really worried,\u201d Alexei Pushkov said. \u201cIn this situation, tough statements with a strong populist message \u2013 such as the talk about \u201cwarning strikes\u201d in Syria \u2013 such statements are not just tasteless, they are plain dangerous.\u201d Patriarch\u2019s visit to London hailed as step toward reconciliation with West Media tensions were somewhat eased by the visit to the UK by Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill. During his visit, which took place on Oct. 15-18, the Patriarch deliberately avoided controversial issues, playing down the conflict between the Russian and British governments. \u201cPolitical differences won\u2019t be able to disrupt the relations between Russia and Britain on the basic level, on the level of people-to-people ties,\u201d Patriarch Kirill said, speaking to journalists before his flight back to Moscow. \u201cI am often asked about our church\u2019s position on Ukraine. My answer is that there can be only one position: to reconcile the people, to lessen the tension, to end the bloody clashes.\u201d\\nTrying to minimize the damage from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the Russian Orthodox Church still recognizes Crimea as a canonical territory of its Ukrainian \u201cOrthodox sister church.\u201d For two years, Patriarch Kirill avoided any political comments on the recent \u201cregime change\u201d in Ukraine. When the Ukrainian government barred him from visiting Kiev, the cradle of Orthodox Christianity in ancient Rus, Kirill did not protest. In this way, the Russian Orthodox Church is offering a good example of forgiveness and compromise. Several British MPs protested against what they called a \u201cred carpet reception\u201d for Patriarch Kirill in London because of Kirill\u2019s loyalty to Putin, but the Patriarch did not pronounce a single word of anger or even sadness, meeting instead with Queen Elizabeth, the titular head of the Church of England, and blessing by his presence the opening of a renovated Orthodox cathedral in London. \\n\u201cSince the early stages of deterioration of relations between Russia and the West, the church leaders have often been doing the diplomats\u2019 jobs in Russia\u2019s relations with the West,\u201d wrote Moscow-based Nezavisimaya Gazeta, deviating from its usual line, which is very critical of Kirill. \\nThis is perhaps not the worst of developments: at a time when diplomats are often sacrificing security and professionalism in order to boost their standing in the mass media, the church is trying to remember and celebrate the positive legacy of Russo-British relations. This is done not so much for the sake of history, as for the sake of a secure future. Sooner or later, this cursory attitude towards diplomacy will have to give way to wisdom and responsibility. \\nDmitry Babich is a political analyst at Sputnik International. \\nThe opinion of the writer may not necessarily reflect the position of RBTH or its staff.
