The shooting followed a struggle as officials were trying to transfer the prisoner from a holding cell to a courtroom where he was to appear before a judge, said Paul Bailey, the Berrien County sheriff. The prisoner broke free, shot and wounded a sheriff\u2019s deputy, then fatally shot the two bailiffs before shooting another person who was standing in a courthouse hallway, Sheriff Bailey said. The prisoner was then shot and killed, apparently by officials who rushed to the hallway. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad day,\u201d Sheriff Bailey said, noting that he had known the bailiffs for decades they had worked in other law enforcement roles before taking the courthouse jobs. Officials said they were uncertain how the inmate had grabbed a gun  \u2014   and did not yet know whose weapon he grabbed  \u2014   but said that routine procedures had been followed for bringing jail inmates to court appearances in Berrien County, in the southwest part of the state. Sheriff Bailey later identified the prisoner as Larry Darnell Gordon, 45, and the bailiffs who were killed as Joseph Zangaro, 61, and Ronald Kienzle, 63, The Associated Press said. Standing behind Sheriff Bailey during an evening news conference, Gov. Rick Snyder called the shooting an \u201cawful act,\u201d and urged residents to stand together in Michigan and elsewhere. \u201cI ask that all Michiganders put your prayers out, your thoughts and prayers,\u201d Mr. Snyder said. \u201cThis is a particularly tough time for law enforcement. \u201d The courthouse is in St. Joseph, a community of about 8, 200 people on Lake Michigan and the seat of Berrien County.'"}, "time": 1742628444.5041025}
