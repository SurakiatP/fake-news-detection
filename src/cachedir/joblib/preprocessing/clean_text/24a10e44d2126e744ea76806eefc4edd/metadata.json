But the issue became personal three years ago when she was pushing her    child in a stroller through the city\u2019s business district. A homeless couple in a tent on the sidewalk were having sex, tent flaps open, as their pit bull stood guard. Ms. Cooper expressed her outrage loudly and in colorful language. \u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t have started yelling at them,\u201d she said in an interview in her fishbowl office in the heart of the Chronicle\u2019s newsroom. \u201cThey let their dog loose. \u201d San Francisco residents have over decades become inured to encounters with the city\u2019s homeless population, the clumps of humanity sleeping on sidewalks under coats and makeshift blankets, or drug addicts shooting up in full view of pedestrians. There are also the   but common scenes of mentally ill men and women stumbling down streets, arguing with imaginary enemies or harassing  . One particularly vocal group of residents, San Francisco\u2019s journalists, say they feel a sense of urgency in addressing the problem. They are banding together in an exasperated, but as yet vaguely defined, attempt to spur the city into action. Next month, media organizations in the Bay Area are planning to put aside their rivalries and competitive instincts for a day of coordinated coverage on the homeless crisis in the city. The Chronicle, which is leading the effort, is dispensing with traditional news article formats and will put forward possible solutions to the seemingly intractable plight of around 6, 000 people without shelter. Representatives from Bay Area television and radio stations, The Chronicle, The San Francisco Examiner, Mother Jones and online publications, among others, met last month to figure out a plan to share resources and content. They agreed to publish their reports on homelessness on June 29. \u201cWe are all frustrated,\u201d said Jon Steinberg, the editor in chief of San Francisco magazine, which is also taking part. \u201cWe are all fed up. We feel there is not enough movement and accountability on the issue. \u201d \u201cWe want the full force of the Fourth Estate to bear down on this problem,\u201d he added. Thirty news organizations have confirmed their participation. KQED, a public television and radio station, is also taking a lead role in the campaign. The premise of the effort is to create a \u201cwave\u201d of coverage that will force politicians to come up with solutions, Ms. Cooper said. \u201cYou will not be able to log onto Facebook, turn on the radio, watch TV, read a newspaper, log onto Twitter without seeing a story about the causes and solutions to homelessness,\u201d she said. At a time of tight budgets, collaboration has become increasingly common in the news business. This year\u2019s Pulitzer Prize for investigative journalism was won by a combined team from The Tampa Bay Times and The Sarasota   in Florida. Still, the San Francisco collaboration stands out for the number of organizations involved and, in the case of The Chronicle, the emphasis on proposing solutions. Ms. Cooper said The Chronicle will run a week of coverage, including four articles that she described as something akin to a science project: putting forth a hypothesized solution and investigating it. The first proposal is that the city build a mental health center large enough to treat the mentally ill on the streets. The article will explore the cost and the feasibility of institutionalizing people. \u201cWe need to be a hell of a lot more creative about how we solve this problem,\u201d Ms. Cooper said. \u201cAnd we are probably going to have to break some dishes to do it. \u201d The paper\u2019s articles and photographs will be offered free to all participants. The paper will also run a   editorial with its conclusions on what solutions should be pursued. Advocacy is a longstanding taboo in American journalism, making reporters and editors wary of discussing solutions to the problems they highlight in their coverage. One rationale for this is that journalists who advocate causes might be selective in their reporting or biased in their coverage. In a city known for its liberal traditions, the question of whether San Francisco\u2019s journalists are crossing into activism has not come up, at least not in the initial meeting of news organizations last month. \u201cIt was sort of shocking that there was no dissension,\u201d said Holly Kernan, the executive editor for news at KQED, the public broadcaster that hosted the meeting. \u201cOn the contrary, the conversation was, \u2018Let\u2019s do way more. \u2019\u201d Ms. Kernan said her station plans \u201cblanket\u201d coverage on June 29, but will not propose solutions. \u201cI see what we are doing as pure journalism,\u201d Ms. Kernan said. Aaron Pero, news director of   a Bay Area television news station, said he planned to have a report on homelessness each day for a week, possibly profiles of homeless people. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to try to figure out how to solve the homeless problem,\u201d Mr. Pero said. \u201cMy vision was to send a number of reporters out and to find a profile that we could do every single day. \u201d Mr. Pero said it was \u201creally awesome that all these media outlets are coming together. \u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s been done anywhere else,\u201d he added. Only one local outlet, KCBS, a news radio station, declined to participate. \u201cIt\u2019s not because of any lack of interest in the homeless or any perception that the story is unimportant to our listeners,\u201d Jack Swanson, the director of news and programming at KCBS, said in an email. \u201cLike many media outlets in the Bay Area we cover the homeless situation in our communities and will continue to cover it, on a regular basis. \u201d (A New York Times reporter also attended the meeting. While The Times is not participating in the coordinated coverage, it has and will continue to cover homelessness as a major issue in the city.) Proponents of   journalism are applauding the initiative. Andrew Donohue, a senior editor at the Center for Investigative Reporting, a nonprofit organization that partners with other media on reporting projects, said the   muckraking focus of some journalism has made the public more cynical. \u201cThere\u2019s outrage fatigue,\u201d Mr. Donohue said. \u201cYou can very easily leave people feeling helpless, which can then lead to being disengaged. \u201d Courtney Martin, a founder of the Solutions Journalism Network, a nonprofit organization that advocates journalism that covers solutions to social problems, said she was thrilled to hear of the San Francisco project. \u201cThis is the kind of thing that is music to our ears,\u201d Ms. Martin said. \u201cWe have this bias in the media to think that our only job is the watchdog role. \u201d A journalist\u2019s job, she said, \u201cis not to pick a winner. \u201d \u201cYour job is to investigate solutions,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople want to read about how to fix broken systems. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564153.772367}
