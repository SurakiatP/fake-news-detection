[Researchers at the Ragnar Frisch Centre for Economic Research uncovered \u201cencouraging signs of labour market integration during an initial period upon migrants\u2019 admission\u201d.  But after a period of just five to 10 years, according to the report, \u201cthe integration process goes into reverse with widening   employment differentials and rising rates of immigrant social insurance dependency\u201d. \u201cBasically we were very surprised by these results, because really the differences between immigrants and   citizens should be getting lesser and lesser the longer migrants have lived in Norway. We found that the opposite happens,\u201d said Knut R\u00f8ed, a senior researcher at the Frisch Centre. Norway\u2019s acting minister for immigration and integration Per Sandberg said the government is aware of problems highlighted by the report, but suggested that not everything can be solved politically. \u201cEven if the government went further still in delivering migrants jobs and opportunities, we mustn\u2019t forget that politicians can\u2019t force people to become integrated,\u201d said the minister. He added: \u201cThere must also be a significant commitment from individuals themselves, if they are wanting to succeed in Norway. \u201d Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang described the findings of the study as \u201cvery bad news\u201d for the nation\u2019s welfare state. \u201cThe conclusion is clear: if we do not succeed in getting newcomers into work, our entire welfare model will be in jeopardy,\u201d the paper\u2019s editorial read. Norway\u2019s welfare state is not the only aspect of life in the Nordic nation that mass migration threatens to disrupt, it has been warned. Last year, the head of the Norwegian Police Security Service (PST) stated that Muslim immigrants are resistant to integration and can cause \u201cproblems\u201d for the host nation. \u201cA strong increase in immigration, particularly from Muslim countries, can cause other   challenges. When a large number of asylum seekers come to a local community, it can have unfortunate consequences,\u201d said PST head Marie Benedicte Bj\u00f8rnland.'"}, "time": 1742563408.9287775}
