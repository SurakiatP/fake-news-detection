[In a submission to an Australian parliamentary inquiry into freedom of religion, the Islamic Council of Victoria (ICV) said such   forums enabled opinions to be \u201crespectfully and intelligently debated and challenged\u201d while also helping to combat alleged \u201cmental health\u201d problems in the young Muslim community in the State of Victoria.  The ICV claimed \u201cMuslim Victorians experience religious intolerance in the form of Islamophobia, racial abuse and breaches of our universal human rights. \u201d The alleged inability of Muslim adherents to safely practice their religion without feeling subject to surveillance is a \u201chuman rights issue,\u201d according to the ICV. The call comes just days after    Somali refugee Yacub Khayre took a hostage, killed a man, and wounded three police officers in Melbourne. The terrorist explicitly dedicated the attack to the Islamic State and   while Islamic State swiftly claimed him as a \u201csoldier\u201d of the caliphate. ICV spokesman Adel Salman said they did not consider the \u201csafe space\u201d proposal controversial, because it is a practice he claimed  \u2014   without providing evidence  \u2014   is already used with young people in other countries. \u201cThis is about good practice because the youth require an avenue to express their views in a safe environment  \u2026     where they feel their views are valued, where they can be respectfully challenged and counter views presented,\u201d Mr. Salman said. He said such spaces would be \u201cconducted with experts who are familiar with the methodology, and understand the way the conversation can be guided\u201d. Victoria State Premier Daniel  Andrews ruled out any possibility of funding such an initiative. \u201cI am very troubled by the suggestion that we might have a space where people could be radical as part of a   programme. That makes no sense to me whatsoever\u201d.  '"}, "time": 1742563144.5654223}
