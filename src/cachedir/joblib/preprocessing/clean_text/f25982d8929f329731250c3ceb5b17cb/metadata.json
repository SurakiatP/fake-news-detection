Early in the episode, Kim Kardashian West was called to action by her husband, Kanye West, after audio of him angrily referring to Taylor Swift as \u201cfake\u201d leaked in February. Over and over again, she reiterated how she felt that Mr. West was portrayed unfairly in public, by Ms. Swift and others. As the episode goes on, Ms. Kardashian West\u2019s ire rises  \u2014   clearly, she is plotting her moves. At the end, she seeks advice from her mother and manager, Kris Jenner. Ms. Jenner suggests calling Ms. Swift to smooth things over. Ms. Kardashian West says no, thanks. Just as the episode ended on the East Coast, Ms. Kardashian West released on Snapchat several video clips of a phone conversation between Mr. West and Ms. Swift in which he appears to get her support  \u2014   mostly enthusiastic, perhaps slightly hesitant  \u2014   for provocative lyrics that refer to her on his song \u201cFamous,\u201d from his album \u201cThe Life of Pablo,\u201d released in February. Not long after, Ms. Swift released a statement on  Instagram stating that she had not approved of the song and that Mr. West had not delivered on a promise to play her the final version before its release. \u201cWhile I wanted to be supportive of Kanye on the phone call, you cannot \u2018approve\u2019 a song you haven\u2019t heard,\u201d she wrote. These are the latest salvos in the running squabble between Ms. Swift and Mr. West, a gripping but unfortunate beef that puts two of the leading pop stars of the day at loggerheads. The first phase of their disagreement dates from the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, when he crashed her acceptance speech for best female video, in a show of support for Beyonc\u00e9, whom she had beaten. They didn\u2019t publicly reconcile until the 2015 Grammys, and the road since has been bumpy. On \u201cFamous,\u201d he rapped, in familiar hyperbolic style, that they \u201cmight still have sex,\u201d and that he was responsible for her success. Shortly thereafter, she lashed out at him (without using his name) from the Grammy stage. The video for \u201cFamous,\u201d released last month, features a Swift   along with other celebrity   topless in bed with Mr. West and Ms. Kardashian West, an   jolt of beatific   erotica. Ms. Swift and Mr. West couldn\u2019t be more different: Ms. Swift is a covert operator, Mr. West a namer of names. Ms. Swift is as careful a crafter of narrative, both in song and in life, as anyone in pop. Mr. West shoots from the hip it\u2019s the source of much of his charm. Throughout this battle, each has accused the other of dishonesty. There is a fundamental layer of falseness and contrivance to all public images: Celebrity culture relies on that layer not being disrupted. Part of the power of the video Ms. Kardashian West released is it appeared to show that Ms. Swift\u2019s public presentation and private machinations were at odds. The Ms. Swift in those video clips is    \u2014   \u201cI\u2019m, like, this close to overexposure,\u201d she said  \u2014   in a way she often isn\u2019t in public, and she is also willing to disrupt her image in unexpected ways. But her stern response to the song\u2019s release served as a reassertion of the old order. It also extended a narrative in which Mr. West, who is black, is painted as the predator and Ms. Swift, who is white, as the prey, a story with uncomfortable racial overtones. In the excerpts, though, Mr. West is solicitous and warm. \u201cI feel like me and Taylor might still have sex,\u201d he says, enunciating each word of the lyric carefully, with Ms. Swift on speakerphone. Rhythmically, it sounds like perhaps he\u2019s workshopping one of two options with her. Later, he says: \u201cI want things that make you feel good. I don\u2019t want to do rap that makes people feel bad. \u201d (The clips are short and choppy, and clearly excerpts. On Twitter in February, Mr. West said the call with Ms. Swift had been an hour long.) \u201cI just really appreciate it,\u201d Ms. Swift said. \u201cI never would have expected you to tell me about a line in your song. \u201d \u201cRelationships,\u201d Mr. West tells her, \u201care more important than punch lines. \u201d Seeking permission for a lyric is an extraordinary step, especially for Mr. West, whose loose tongue is his greatest asset. Ms. Swift, by contrast, has generally avoided identifying the subjects of her songs, though after the 2009 V. M. A. s, she released the rather patronizing \u201cInnocent\u201d  \u2014   including the words \u201cWho you are is not what you  \u2019re still an innocent\u201d  \u2014   which she described in a 2010 interview with MTV as not a song about Mr. West but one \u201cto\u201d him. (Her song \u201cDear John\u201d is widely believed to be about John Mayer, to whom Ms. Swift was romantically linked. It is one of the most effective and ruthless eviscerations of a fellow celebrity in pop history, and it seems unlikely that Ms. Swift ran it past Mr. Mayer for approval.) Given the seemingly genial nature of the conversation between Ms. Swift and Mr. West, what agitated Ms. Swift remains unclear. The release of video clips of the call is a clear violation of trust and raises possible legal issues. (The legality of recording phone calls varies from state to state a representative for Mr. West did not respond to an inquiry about where the rapper had been at the time of the call.) In an interview with GQ released last month, Ms. Kardashian West mentioned that Ms. Swift\u2019s legal team knew about the recorded conversation \u201cand then they sent an attorney\u2019s letter like, \u2018Don\u2019t you dare do anything with that footage,\u2019 and asking us to destroy it. \u201d The statement issued by Ms. Swift\u2019s representative when Mr. West\u2019s \u201cFamous\u201d came out said that Ms. Swift had \u201ccautioned him about releasing a song with such a strong misogynistic message,\u201d but that does not appear to be in line with what she expresses in these video clips. The statement also said, \u201cTaylor was never made aware of the actual lyric, \u2018I made that bitch famous. \u2019\u201d The video clips on Ms. Kardashian West\u2019s Snapchat do not show Mr. West asking about that line. And so, if this conflagration turns on the interpretation of that epithet, then what may be at play is a contextual misread, or perhaps a clash of value systems. Mr. West comes from the world of   where use of that term to refer to women can be so pervasive as to dull its pejorative meaning. In 2012, Mr. West unveiled the song \u201cPerfect Bitch\u201d  \u2014   it was about Ms. Kardashian West, then his girlfriend. But though it has become a catchall term, it still carries undeniable historical baggage. Perhaps Ms. Swift didn\u2019t like hearing herself referred to in that fashion, regardless of the context. Maybe she was concerned about her young female fan base and the word\u2019s effect on them. Maybe she simply got cold feet. Whatever the case, both sides have opted for public escalation over private reconciliation. Mr. West and Ms. Kardashian West are armed with selectively edited documentation optimized for social media distribution. They are primed for battle. Meanwhile, Ms. Swift and her team increasingly transmit an air of fatigue. After Ms. Kardashian West\u2019s GQ interview, Ms. Swift\u2019s representative released a statement that concluded, \u201cTaylor cannot understand why Kanye West, and now Kim Kardashian, will not just leave her alone. \u201d And Ms. Swift\u2019s latest reply concludes with a similar sentiment, though this time from her directly: \u201cI would very much like to be excluded from this narrative, one that I have never asked to be a part of, since 2009. \u201d But this bespeaks a misunderstanding of how public storytelling unfolds. It is crowdsourced, not written from the top down. In the past, Ms. Swift\u2019s refusal to name the subjects of her songs or any of her personal antagonists also robbed them of their opportunities to respond, keeping the narrative tidy. But that\u2019s not an option when the two main characters are equally famous. Ms. Swift\u2019s revulsion only amplifies the situation: The farther from Mr. West she tries to pull, the more tightly they are bound.'"}, "time": 1742562232.7768302}
