That sentiment translates into politics. For the Dutch, both the British vote to leave the European Union and Donald J. Trump\u2019s election in the United States broke political dikes, leaving the Dutch ill at ease with the conflict and uncertainty that has ensued. That, some analysts said, helps explain why the Dutch ultimately chose to contain the populist surge led by Geert Wilders, the   icon, in their elections on Wednesday. \u201cIn Europe we all see the developments in the United States, and that\u2019s not where we want to go because we see it as chaos,\u201d said Janka Stoker, a professor in the School of Economics and Business at the University of Groningen in the north of the Netherlands. \u201cWe\u2019re a coalition country, we don\u2019t always like the coalitions, but we know it gives stability and people know here that we have to work together,\u201d Ms. Stoker said. It is hard to say if the same feeling will prevail in other European countries holding elections this year. The Netherlands, a nation of essentially liberal social instincts, is some barometer, but an imperfect one, with its proportional electoral system that dissipates power and enforces cooperation. It is far less clear that the political circuit breakers in places like France or Italy will similarly hold back a populist movement. They have already blown in Britain, where the incautious choice of a   referendum on Europe removed the usual electoral safeguards, and in the United States, where the Electoral College has twice overridden the popular vote since 2000. So while the sense of relief among   politicians and voters was palpable on Thursday after the Dutch vote, Europe  \u2014   its project of integration, its unity, its political ideals  \u2014   was by no means free of populist threats. Even if the Dutch refused to hand a big win to Mr. Wilders, they backed center right parties that adopted some of his positions and language in order to win. Over all,   parties, including the parties defined as populist by academics and pollsters, gained seven seats in the Dutch Parliament, giving them 57 percent of the   body in this election, in contrast to 52. 6 percent in the last election when they had 79 seats. At the same time, one of the oldest Dutch political forces, the mainstream left Labor Party, cratered. The result all but guarantees that policies toward immigrants and Muslims will be more restrictive, though less than if Mr. Wilders were running the Dutch government. Yet there are several signs the \u201cTrump effect\u201d that was once expected to carry similarly minded populists is less powerful, or even having the opposite impact, several analysts and pollsters said. Similarly, the British vote to leave the European Union, known as Brexit, may look less inviting as a model as the reality of its messiness comes into view. Charles Grant, director of the Center for European Reform, a   research organization, said the \u201cTrump factor\u201d had played a role in \u201cmaking people think twice about voting for a populist, as people have seen that if you elect a populist you can get all kinds of wacky policies. \u201d \u201cAt the same time,\u201d he added, \u201cwe have seen a drop in populism in Europe since Brexit, as citizens have realized that, while a protest vote is fun, it can lead to the uncertainties of Brexit, which are not funny at all. That helped shift the mood in the Netherlands. \u201d In polls in the Netherlands that looked at perceptions of Mr. Wilders before and after Mr. Trump\u2019s election, Mr. Wilders did significantly better before Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, said Maurice de Hond, one of the Netherlands\u2019 most seasoned pollsters. \u201cThe reason Wilders ended in second place has to do with Trump,\u201d he said, noting that there were other factors, like Mr. Wilders missing early debates. Not everyone agrees, and some analysts underscored that all politics are local. More important than Brexit or Mr. Trump may have been last weekend\u2019s diplomatic spat with Turkey, which gave the   party a lift after it took a strong stand against Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish president. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that the Netherlands was not that concerned with Trump and Brexit, it\u2019s that there\u2019s a provincialism about these European elections,\u201d said E. C. Hendriks, a Dutch researcher in social sciences and cultural anthropology who is now at Peking University in Beijing. \u201cReally, everyone is on his island. \u201d Certainly, there are factors in both France and Germany that make their respective elections idiosyncratic and potentially less affected by the American and British political winds. Nonetheless, in France it is striking that for the most part Marine Le Pen, the leader of the   National Front, has steered clear of analogies between her politics and those of Mr. Trump. \u201cGeert Wilders, the Le Pen Dutch equivalent, spoke a lot about Trump, he praised him on the Muslim ban and was one of the few European political figures to praise that ban,\u201d said Alexandra de Hoop Scheffer, director of the German Marshall Fund office in Paris. \u201cLe Pen was quieter, I think she understood that to be too close to Trump right now when his administration was in a chaotic phase was not to her advantage. \u201d Some Dutch voters said they took Mr. Trump\u2019s sometimes bellicose tone seriously, and consciously voted for parties that supported the European Union because they believe that Europe is stronger together and better able to stand up to the United States under Mr. Trump. For similar reasons, some said, they did not favor Brexit. \u201cI don\u2019t like Brexit, it weakened the system, it weakened the European Union and indirectly the Netherlands,\u201d said Max den Voort, 19, a student at The Hague University of Applied Sciences in Delft. The Green Party, led by    Jesse Klaver, was an unexpected winner, scoring the biggest parliamentary gains on the left. The D66 party also had a successful showing, getting the left\u2019s largest share of votes. Both parties are  . One important difference between the Netherlands and countries that vote later this year is that the Dutch have already had experience with populists in government, said Ronald Kroeze, a political historian at the Free University of Amsterdam. Mr. Wilders was part of the governing coalition in 2010, but when it came to supporting austerity measures in the wake of the recession, he refused to go along. That left the impression he was not serious about governing. In contrast, France and Germany have no direct recent experience with populist leadership and they may be more open to it as a result. Regardless, the continent seems to be moving in an   direction that relies more on identity politics, Ms. Hoop de Scheffer said. \u201cThe mainstream parties are now stealing parts of the populist discourse, and this is undermining the attraction of the populist parties,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a dangerous game because it almost normalizes these ideas. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564350.4914172}
