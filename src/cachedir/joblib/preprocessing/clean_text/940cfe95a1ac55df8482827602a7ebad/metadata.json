Fortunately, someone amazing is looking out for her. When the CEO of Firestone Tires heard Alexa\u2019s story, he surprised her by showing up at the hospital with dozens of exclusive photos of the company\u2019s entire 2017 tire lineup. \\nWhat an amazing gesture! \\nThe rest of us will have to wait until next July to see these tires, but thanks to the incredible generosity of Firestone CEO Gary Garfield, Alexa got a special advance peek on Tuesday. According to Alexa\u2019s parents, Garfield entered the ward totally unannounced carrying a large briefcase containing what he called \u201ca glimpse of the future of American tires.\u201d \\nGarfield then had the hospital room cleared to make sure that the photos of Firestone\u2019s tire offerings were for Alexa\u2019s eyes only. Staying for a full hour despite his busy schedule, he was able to give Alexa detailed descriptions of the tread life, fuel efficiency, and all-weather performance for the full range of tires set to be released under the Firestone brand next year. \\n\u201cAlexa has been incredibly brave and strong. I\u2019m so glad I could share these tire design specs with her,\u201d said Garfield. \u201cUsually you\u2019d have to be an industry insider to get this kind of advance info, but in Alexa\u2019s case, we were happy to make an exception and show her some pictures of slick road tread patterns that no one outside of Firestone headquarters has seen before.\u201d \\nWow. Thanks to this CEO\u2019s kindness, Alexa now knows more about Firestone\u2019s tires than just about anyone. Kudos to Firestone for doing their part to make this youngster\u2019s day very, very special.'"}, "time": 1742562348.9166346}
