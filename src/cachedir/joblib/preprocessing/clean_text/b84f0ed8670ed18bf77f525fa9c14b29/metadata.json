Guests will be welcomed instead by   photographs of Cubans from Cuba and New York, alongside quotations that display a variety of views and aspirations. Although this is not a political exhibition, the nature of Cuba\u2019s relationship to the United States means that politics cannot  \u2014   and should not  \u2014   be avoided, said Christopher J. Raxworthy, curator of the museum\u2019s department of herpetology and a curator of \u201c\u00a1Cuba!\u201d \u201cWe wanted the exhibition to be very honest,\u201d he said, to allow the diversity of Cuba, both environmental and political, to come through. \u201c\u00a1Cuba! ,\u201d opening Nov. 21 and running through Aug. 13, 2017, will be one of the largest exhibitions on Cuba\u2019s biodiversity, natural resources and culture ever presented in the United States. It will also be the museum\u2019s first fully bilingual show. All the senses will be brought into play. The scent of tobacco leaves will waft through part of the exhibition. Videos of Cuban music  \u2014   and perhaps even live performances  \u2014   will play at the end of what looks like a typical Cuban street, with cafes (no food or drink, but guests can sit down and play a game of dominoes to the aroma of coffee). The timing is both serendipitous and not. It comes about 16 months after President Obama announced the   of diplomatic ties, which were severed by the Cuban missile crisis more than 50 years ago. Legal commercial flights to Cuba began just this summer. But the museum\u2019s ties to Cuba go deep. \u201cWe have a relationship with Cuban scientists and paleontologists going back 100 years,\u201d Dr. Raxworthy said. While the museum had long had an interest in doing something on Cuba, \u201cthe normalization awakened people\u2019s interest,\u201d he said. The political shift also made it easier to invite Cuban colleagues to help and accelerated visas, said Ana Luz Porzecanski, director of the museum\u2019s center for biodiversity and conservation and a curator of the exhibition. While it takes a minimum of two years to create something of the complexity and size of \u201ciCuba! ,\u201d this has been a little more rushed. \u201cWe have had just under two years,\u201d Dr. Raxworthy said. Nothing is being shipped from Cuba because of the tight controls on the movement of biological materials. In any case, Dr. Porzecanski said, it is common for the museum to make models the exhibition needs to be hardy enough to travel, as it might be shown in different museums over the next 10 years. So in the bowels of the museum, an entire kaleidoscope of Cuban life has been created. It took 25 volunteers and several staff members to make the 4, 000 tobacco leaves out of construction paper. They are   with acrylic in varying shades of brown and green, complete with tiny holes mimicking insect damage. Stems made of hardened hot glue are attached. Then they are crinkled, bundled together and hung over drying poles. \u201cIt\u2019s taken from April to the end of August\u201d to finish the leaves,\u201d said Andrea Raphael, a model maker for the museum. There\u2019s a   shed for the leaves that will demonstrate the tradition of   and a   of a throne used for the   spiritual tradition known as Santeria, with information on how both have shaped the island nation. Also displayed are 30 original posters created over the last decade, which show \u201cthe breadth and vitality of Cuban art,\u201d said Catharine Weese, director of exhibition graphic design. Michele Miyares Hollands, a Cuban artist who created some of the posters, was brought in to help develop that part of the show. An interactive exhibit allows museumgoers to explore the country\u2019s art, fashion and dance worlds. A 1955 Chevy will be on display as a tool to explain Cuban restrictions on imports and sales of American cars after 1959, as well as the ingenuity Cubans used in keeping their ancient automobiles running. But of course, the natural world is an important part of the exhibition, and that means an enormous amount of work has been done to recreate accurately everything from the prehistoric giant owl to the bee hummingbird, the tiniest bird in the world. Wetlands, rain forests and coral reefs all come to life. The plywood, foam and resin model of the Garden of the Queens coral reef alone took about six months to make, complete with a   shark, which once lived in the museum\u2019s Ocean Life hall and had been banished to storage. \u201cCuba has some of the best sea corals in the Caribbean,\u201d Dr. Raxworthy said. The giant owl, which went extinct about 6, 000 years ago and might have been the largest flying bird, stands about three feet tall and was created by sculpturing epoxy, applied over foam and a steel armature form. Its piercing glass yellow eyes were flown over from Wales because no one in the United States had the right size in the right color, said Jason Broughan, a model maker who was working on the owl. \u201cIt was hard to flesh out the whole body  \u2014   we had to do a lot of inference,\u201d he said. Rebecca Meah, who created the model of the endangered Cuban crocodile  \u2014   known for leaping in the air to catch small animals hanging from tree branches  \u2014   used the skull of a Cuban crocodile that lived in the Bronx Zoo for many years to shape its head. Working with clay over urethane foam, Ms. Meah said it was the details  \u2014   such as recreating exactly how the skin lies on the bone  \u2014   that make the animal seem real. \u201cOtherwise, it looks like a stuffed animal,\u201d she said. The reuse of bits and pieces from other parts of the museum is typical. The fur of the Cuban solenodon  \u2014   which looks like a shrew with a very long snout  \u2014   was repurposed from a polar bear and painted rusty brown. And some live animals, including the Cuban tree frog and Cuban boa, will also be on view. The hope, Dr. Raxworthy said, is that visitors will \u201clearn and have fun\u201d And, he said, \u201cfor   who haven\u2019t been back in a long time, it could be emotional. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563380.8306162}
