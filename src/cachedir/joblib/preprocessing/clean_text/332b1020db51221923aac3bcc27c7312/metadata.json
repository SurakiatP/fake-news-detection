Trump\u2019s contention that her push for stricter gun control would make families less safe, saying the presumptive Republican nominee would put more children \u201cat risk of violence and bigotry. \u201d The day after Mr. Trump received the endorsement of the National Rifle Association, Mrs. Clinton assailed her probable general election rival as pandering to the group. \u201cI believe it\u2019s the most powerful lobby in Washington,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said of the N. R. A. at an event in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. to benefit the Trayvon Martin Foundation\u2019s Circle of Mothers. \u201cAnd we know some candidates will say or do anything to make them happy. \u201d Speaking in a ballroom full of mothers who had lost children to gun violence, Mrs. Clinton defended her position on gun control and her promise to overhaul the criminal justice system. \u201cI love my daughter and granddaughter more than anything, and I worry about them as every mother does, and I want them always to be safe,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cParents, teachers and schools should have the right to keep guns out of classrooms, just like Donald Trump does at many of his hotels by the way. \u201d She mentioned his speech to the N. R. A. on Friday, which included a vow to allow teachers and principals to arm themselves. \u201cThis is someone running to be president of the United States, a country facing a gun violence epidemic, and he\u2019s talking about more guns in our schools,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cHe\u2019s talking about more hatred and violence in our streets. \u201d Mrs. Clinton delivered her remarks to a group named after Mr. Martin, an unarmed black    who was fatally shot in 2012 by a neighborhood watch volunteer, George Zimmerman. Before she spoke, Mrs. Clinton sat for dinner alongside Mr. Martin\u2019s mother, Sybrina Fulton. \u201cWe will carry the memories of your sons and daughters in our hearts every day, as you do,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told the group as she affirmed her plans to strengthen background checks and take other measures to keep guns out of the wrong hands. Mr. Trump, speaking before N. R. A. members in Louisville, Ky. called Mrs. Clinton \u201cthe most     Amendment candidate ever to run for office. \u201d Mr. Trump said Mrs. Clinton\u2019s policies would put women in particular danger. \u201cYou have a woman living in a community, a rough community, a bad community  \u2014   sorry, you can\u2019t defend yourself,\u201d he told the group on Friday. For months, Mrs. Clinton has made gun control a major issue in her Democratic primary campaign against Bernie Sanders, whose record as a senator from Vermont has been mixed on the issue. She has campaigned alongside the mothers of Eric Garner, Jordan Davis, Sandra Bland and others who have lost children in clashes with the police or to gun violence. Some of them attended the event on Saturday. The Clinton campaign has featured these mothers and Erica Smegielski, daughter of the school principal killed in the massacre in Sandy Hook, Conn. in evocative television ads. But as the Clinton campaign turns its focus to the fall election against Mr. Trump and as both candidates vie for the support of white voters in the Rust Belt, gun control has become less of a driving force. A New York   News poll in January found that 57 percent of respondents wanted stricter laws governing gun sales, and 88 percent favored background checks for all purchases. On Saturday, Mrs. Clinton reaffirmed her commitment to both gun control and the overhaul of the criminal justice system, two issues that formed the pillars of her primary campaign and have helped her win broad support among  . Mrs. Clinton vowed to end the \u201cschools to prison pipeline\u201d that affects black men. \u201cSomething is wrong when so many Americans have reason to believe that our country doesn\u2019t consider their children as precious and worthy of protection as other children because of the color of their skins,\u201d she said. Mrs. Clinton also restated her promise to \u201cend the era of mass incarceration\u201d and to \u201crebuild the bonds of trust between law enforcement and communities\u201d  \u2014   issues that could resonate with voters in Los Angeles, Oakland and other California cities ahead of that state\u2019s June 7 primary.'"}, "time": 1742628433.1105006}
