Robert Menendez ( ) said President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cgreat wall of hate\u201d that had a $20 billion price tag \u201ccould be spent far better in creating educational opportunity. That he said included creating jobs and \u201ca whole host of things that are important to our country. \u201d  Menendez said, \u201cWhen our products become more expensive if there is retaliatory tariff by Mexico, that\u2019s going to affect jobs here in the United States. That\u2019s not how you become the greatest job creator ever known to mankind. So, you know, our challenge is we need to work with Mexico and get our relationship to meet our mutual challenges, to create greater stability, greater economic growth, to control the traffic of people and at the same time protect ourselves against the scourge of gangs and drugs. \u201d \u201cBut you don\u2019t do it by putting up a wall,\u201d Menendez said. \u201cLast time a wall was built was in Germany, and at the end of the day it ultimately came down. And, so, I don\u2019t believe this is the way to go. And I don\u2019t believe the taxpayers of the United States should spend nearly $20 billion dollars  \u2014   billion dollars  \u2014   on a wall, the great wall of hate, at the end of the day when that 20 billion could be spent far better in creating educational opportunity, in creating jobs, in a whole host of things that are important to our country. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742561973.243037}
