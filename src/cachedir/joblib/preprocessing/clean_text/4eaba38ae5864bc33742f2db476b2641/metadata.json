[The Department of Justice announced on Friday that U. S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions asked for the resignation of 46 U. S. Attorneys who were appointed during President Barack Obama\u2019s regime.  The Attorney General\u2019s actions are not uncommon. Many past presidents and their AGs have asked for the resignations of U. S. attorneys they were tasked with overseeing. In 2006 George W. Bush was attacked by liberals for firing seven U. S. attorneys. He was hardly the first. Both Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan fired a list of attorneys when they came to office. President Obama also cleaned house but at a slower pace, replacing many of the 94 U. S. attorneys one at a time instead of starting with a mass firing. Despite the long list of past presidents who also fired U. S. attorneys, as they are legally allowed to do, CNN criticized the firing, reporting an unnamed source saying, \u201cThis could not have been handled any worse. \u201d Upon the announcement, liberals took to Twitter to complain about the Attorney General\u2019s actions. One liberal even tried to blame Sean Hannity for the AG\u2019s actions.

After being appointed the U. S. Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama by President Ronald Reagan and serving through President George H. W. Bush, Sessions was also fired by an incoming president in 1993.  Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com.'"}, "time": 1742562102.049494}
