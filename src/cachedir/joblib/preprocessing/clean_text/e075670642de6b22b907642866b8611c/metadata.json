By: Ben Shapiro November 18, 2016 \\nThe media, desperately in search of a narrative to cast the incoming Trump administration as dangerously incompetent, are once again overplaying their hands. Instead of focusing on the nepotistic fact that Trump relies heavily on his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his daughter, Ivanka \u2013 he invited them to a state meeting with Japan \u2013 they\u2019re trying to claim that he just isn\u2019t moving fast enough on appointments. \\nThat\u2019s nuts. \\nBarack Obama didn\u2019t name his picks for Secretary of State, Defense, or Attorney General until December 1, nearly a month after the November 4, 2008 election. George W. Bush didn\u2019t name his picks for State, Defense, or Attorney General until mid-December (December 16 for Colin Powell, December 28 for Donald Rumsfeld, December 22 for John Ashcroft). Bill Clinton didn\u2019t name his picks for those positions until at least December 22. George H.W. Bush was the fastest off the mark \u2013 he named James Baker Secretary of State the day after the November 8 election. Ronald Reagan waited until December 11 to get started; Jimmy Carter waited until December 3. \\nWe\u2019re still waiting on Trump\u2019s State and Defense picks, but he\u2019s already out of the gate with Senator Jeff Sessions for Attorney General. It\u2019s November 17. \\nThe media are so eager to bury Trump\u2019s administration that they are falling all over themselves to do so. Instead of soberly covering potential problems with top level picks \u2013 Steve Bannon, for example, is a rotten pick , but not because he\u2019s a racist or anti-Semite \u2013 the media keep proclaiming THE END IS NEAR. This sort of alarmism doesn\u2019t convince Americans, who don\u2019t really see why there\u2019s any giant rush to appoint people who aren\u2019t going to be formally considered by the Senate until January 20 anyway. \\nIf this election was about repudiation of the media \u2013 and it was \u2013 the media aren\u2019t doing themselves any favors when they promulgate fact-free narratives while simultaneously attempting to label conservative outlets \u201cfake news.\u201d For years, Americans have assumed that the leftist media are ladling them fake news each day. Each day, the media seem determined to prove them right. Tags \""}, "time": 1742561978.3119538}
