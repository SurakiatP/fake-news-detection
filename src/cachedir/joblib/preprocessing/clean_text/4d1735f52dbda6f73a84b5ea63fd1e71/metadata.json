[Apatow, the   who launched Lena Dunham\u2019s career and   HBO\u2019s Girls, began his comedy set by describing his feelings about Trump\u2019s election and his presidency.  When Trump was elected, Apatow said, according to the Daily Beast, he felt like \u201ca person about to get raped, but I didn\u2019t know how bad it would be. \u201d Now that Trump is president, \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve just been raped and I just don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to get murdered. \u201d The comic\u2019s crude comments came Saturday night at the Regent Theater in Los Angeles during Pete Homles\u2019   tour to promote his new HBO series Crashing, which Apatow executive produced. Later, he aimed his   insults toward the first family. Playing on reports that Melania Trump plans to move into the White House after Barron completes the school year in New York City, Apatow said. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty bad. \u201d \u201cI mean, think about it: Hillary Clinton didn\u2019t move out of the White House and her husband got a blowjob in it,\u201d Apatow joked. \u201cEvery day she\u2019s not in the White House is a day she\u2019s not getting f*cked by Donald Trump. Wouldn\u2019t you stay away?\u201d Then Apatow used Barron Trump to pan the president. \u201cHe f*cking gets it,\u201d he said of the    Trump. \u201cYou ever see the look on his face when Trump\u2019s talking? People are like, \u2018Is there something wrong with him?\u2019 No! He knows his dad\u2019s a f*cking asshole!\u201d Echoing comments he made last month at the Television Critics Association press tour about how \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d it is that the president doesn\u2019t laugh, Apatow told the L. A. crowd, \u201cHe only laughs when he makes someone feel bad. What does he do to laugh, just go on YouTube and watch Special Olympics bloopers?\u201d Apatow has been a fierce critic of Trump since well before Inauguration Day. The director attended at least one fundraiser for former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton during the campaign, and was one of the celebrities hosting a \u201c  \u201d to benefit progressive causes during Trump\u2019s inauguration in January.
