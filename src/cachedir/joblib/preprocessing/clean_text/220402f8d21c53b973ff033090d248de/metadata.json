Secret Service will reportedly open an investigation into Madonna after the singer told demonstrators at the Women\u2019s March on Washington Saturday that she has often thought of \u201cblowing up the White House. \u201d[During a   speech at the protest rally in Washington, D. C. Saturday, the    \u201cRebel Heart\u201d singer said she had felt \u201cangry\u201d and \u201coutraged\u201d over Donald Trump becoming the country\u2019s 45th president.  \u201cI\u2019m angry. Yes, I\u2019m outraged. Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House,\u201d Madonna said. \u201cBut I know that this won\u2019t change anything. We cannot fall into despair. \u201d A spokesman for the Secret Service reportedly told The Gateway Pundit that the agency was \u201caware\u201d of the singer\u2019s comments and would open an investigation, though the final decision on whether to prosecute would be made by the U. S. Attorney\u2019s office. Madonna performed two songs during her appearance at the Women\u2019s March, \u201cExpress Yourself\u201d and \u201cHuman Nature. \u201d During \u201cHuman Nature,\u201d the singer changed the song\u2019s lyrics to include \u201cDonald Trump, suck a d***. \u201d Madonna\u2019s comments aired uncensored on several cable TV networks, leading to apologies from some   anchors.  Madonna was one of several celebrities who participated in Saturday\u2019s march. Other stars on hand included Alicia Keys, Amy Schumer, Ashley Judd, Scarlet Johansson, Cher, Julia Roberts and Katy Perry. Madonna was one of Trump\u2019s biggest celebrity antagonists during the election. In October, the pop star offered to perform oral sex on anyone who voted for former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.
