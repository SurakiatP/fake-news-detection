There have been a few odd occasions where the guys have revealed their struggles with women, like Jared attempting to engineer a friendship between Monica and Carla, or Richard referring to his old laptop as his \u201cgirlfriend,\u201d because it\u2019s the only warm thing that\u2019s touched his crotch in three years. To put it generously, the boys have been too busy managing the ups and downs of Pied Piper to brush the cobwebs off their dormant libidos. But now, to the horror of single ladies from Silicon Valley to Estonia, they\u2019re ready to play the field. Opening with the gang on the town, dipping into an extra large virgin margarita, this week\u2019s episode finally offers a glimpse of the men at play. To say they\u2019re rusty is an insult to the ancient Volkswagen perched atop concrete blocks on your neighbor\u2019s front lawn. Richard comes to the table with the exciting news that Winnie, the lovely young woman sitting at the bar, has given him her phone number. Gilfoyle guesses, correctly, that Richard has let it slip that he\u2019s the C. E. O. of his own company. Dinesh surmises that maybe Winnie is a \u201cFounder Hounder,\u201d but defends Richard telling her why he and his friends were celebrating. \u201cEvery time you are near a woman,\u201d he says, \u201cit is important to explain why. Otherwise, they get nervous. \u201d And that, in a nutshell, describes the excruciating awkwardness of their romantic lives. \u201cBachmanity Insanity\u201d takes the form of many an Apatowian comedy since \u201cThe    Virgin,\u201d with guys who know little about love dispensing advice to guys who know even less. But it\u2019s a hilarious specificity of each character that makes the difference: Dinesh creepily macking on his Estonian underling via video chat, which is murky enough to support his claim to be \u201cPakistani Denzel\u201d Richard spoiling a certain opportunity to have sex by freaking out over a dispute with Winnie over   preferences and Jared, who talks about fanning out his plumage, quietly bedding at least two women in Erlich\u2019s garage. Turns out Russ Hanneman had him pegged all along. Jared\u2019s sexual prowess adds to a character book that\u2019s growing sadder and stranger by the episode. The formality of his language (\u201cShe\u2019s magnificent! ,\u201d he declares, when Richard points out Winnie at the bar) the utter sincerity of his sycophancy, the darkness that casually seeps out of him like sap from a Vermont maple: Jared has become the show\u2019s most fascinating character and its most poignant, too, in the way he suppresses a life of unimaginable misfortune with cheery optimism. \u201cI had a stuffed animal named Winnie,\u201d he tells Richard\u2019s new squeeze. \u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t technically an animal. I took a Ziploc bag and stuffed it with old newspaper, then drew a smile on it. \u201d Zach Woods plays Jared with a gentle composure that slyly undercuts the outrageous things that come out of his mouth and suggests an ease that might make women comfortable around him. At least until they get to know him better. With Pied Piper currently downshifted to the core staff at Erlich\u2019s incubator and a network of   engineers working from abroad, \u201cBachmanity Insanity\u201d has more freedom to fool around with observational comedy than previous episodes. The only real developments come in the   partnership between Erlich and Big Head, which crashes because of profligate spending, like Big Head paying to move the pool closer to the house (and then back to where it was before) and Erlich blowing money on helicopter rides, a   launch party at Alcatraz and $500, 000 for a blog. Erlich and Big Head were an incompatible team in many ways, but they both turned out to be exceptionally good at burning through $20 million. The episode was also evidence that the show\u2019s writers are capable of zagging when they\u2019re expected to zig. So much of \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d has been staked on the tension and perils of getting a tech   off the ground that it\u2019s a relief to step back and watch these characters try something unfamiliar. The show has been moving forward  \u2014   or lurching, anyway  \u2014   relentless from the beginning, but while the constant conflict has been productive, it runs the risk of sinking into formula. \u201cBachmanity Insanity\u201d more or less took a breather, and may be the most breezily entertaining episode of the season. Bytes \u2022 Thomas Middleditch\u2019s reaction to being called a \u201cformatting Nazi\u201d is a master class of physical and verbal anxiety, like a   meltdown. First, he tries playful   in a German accent: \u201cMe? A Nazi? Zats    . \u201d Then he tumbles into Hitler and the Holocaust, and a series of regrettable analogies, his body twitching all the while. Not a smooth operator. \u2022 \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d prides itself in getting the tech right, and there is indeed a    formatting debate. A casual Internet search reveals this lively article, called \u201cDeath to the Space Infidels!\u201d \u2022 Every week brings glorious profanities that are not fit to print, so Erlich\u2019s metaphor about his \u201cvengeful, viscous web of payback\u201d cannot be transcribed in full. Let it be known, however, that Erlich\u2019s gift for vulgar phrasing is formidable. \u2022 Big Head\u2019s comments on his   Agreement with Hooli suggests that the writers of \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d know their Marx Brothers: \u201cThe NDA is actually covered under the NDA, so if I told you about the NDA, it would have been a violation of the NDA. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564026.3752346}
