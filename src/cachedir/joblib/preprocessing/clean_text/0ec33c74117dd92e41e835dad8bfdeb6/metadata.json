But the anti-Russia hysteria is the final straw. It\u2019s not just \u201canti-Russia\u201d: it\u2019s anti-truth, anti-rational and anti-modern. It\u2019s the end result of postmodernism. What began as irony is now systematic madness.\\nEverything is upside down. Or maybe at last it\u2019s the right side up. Maybe the West to begin with never was the Free World. Wasn\u2019t that the whole point of modernism? Modernism was self criticism. Modernism was critical of the West. And then along came postmodernism. And the West suddenly was off the hook. The West wearing the clothes of postmodernism went on the attack again.\\nThe end result is that anything goes as long as the West wins. Forget the truth. Forget the facts. And forget history. Everything apparently is fiction. The West can say what it wants because everything is interpretation. That\u2019s the beauty of postmodernism. You can contradict yourself a million times and laugh it all off. As long as you\u2019ve the power. And that\u2019s the key word: power. Because postmodernism was from the word go a political project. One that was made in the West for the West.\\nThe end result is hatred for Russia. And love for \u201cAl-Qaeda\u201d. Why? Because Russia attempted to rationalise the world. It attempted to apply reason to the 21st century. And so the irrational West had to punish it. Listen to Putin in 2007 when he spoke in Munich:\\n\u201cHowever, what is a unipolar world? However one might embellish this term, at the end of the day it refers to one type of situation, namely one centre of authority, one centre of force, one centre of decision-making.\\nIt is [a] world in which there is one master, one sovereign. And at the end of the day this is pernicious not only for all those within this system, but also for the sovereign itself because it destroys itself from within.\\nAnd this certainly has nothing in common with democracy. Because, as you know, democracy is the power of the majority in light of the interests and opinions of the minority.\\nIncidentally, Russia \u2013 we \u2013 are constantly being taught about democracy. But for some reason those who teach us do not want to learn themselves.\\nI consider that the unipolar model is not only unacceptable but also impossible in today\u2019s world. And this is not only because if there was individual leadership in today\u2019s \u2013 and precisely in today\u2019s \u2013 world, then the military, political and economic resources would not suffice. What is even more important is that the model itself is flawed because at its basis there is and can be no moral foundations for modern civilisation.\u201d\\nAnd listen to him in New York in 2015 when he spoke in the UN General Assembly:\\n\u201c and so the export of revolutions, this time of so-called democratic ones, continues. It would suffice to look at the situation in the Middle East and North Africa, as has been mentioned by previous speakers. Certainly political and social problems in this region have been piling up for a long time, and people there wish for changes naturally.\\nBut how did it actually turn out? Rather than bringing about reforms, an aggressive foreign interference has resulted in a brazen destruction of national institutions and the lifestyle itself. Instead of the triumph of democracy and progress, we got violence, poverty and social disaster. Nobody cares a bit about human rights, including the right to life.\\nI cannot help asking those who have caused the situation, do you realize now what you\u2019ve done?\u201d\\nDid you hear the plea for reason? Did you hear the cry for modernity? Did you hear the demand for \u201cmoral foundations\u201d \u2013 for universal values \u2013 for international law? Did you hear the defence of national sovereignty and the defence of the UN Charter? The West didn\u2019t. In these two key Russian speeches (Munich \u201907 and New York \u201915) the West only heard a threat to it\u2019s power.\\nThe West\u2019s reply to Russia\u2019s rationalism was and continues to be irrationalism. Media madness, \u201cPresidential\u201d paranoia and Islamic insanity is the West\u2019s response to the truth. And the truth is no secret. But the West just shrugs it\u2019s shoulders and laughs it all off. The truth is Western imperialism: the unipolar world, full spectrum dominance, neo-con mendacity, hybrid warfare, sanctions, speculation, special forces, the CIA, fundamentalism and American Exceptionalism. In short: Putin hit the nail on the head.\\nAnd the West hit back. Why? Because the West can\u2019t defend itself rationally. There is no good reason for all the wealth found in the West. So there can only be a bad reason: imperial power. And modernism proved beyond doubt that it was bad. However as this power was rolled back in modern times \u2013 as the victims of Empire succeeded in liberating themselves \u2013 postmodern times came to the rescue of the West. In Nietzsche the West found it\u2019s champion. The will to power was the West\u2019s trump card. And with Nietzsche\u2019s blessing it played it.\\nFor Nietzsche all that mattered was power. And whoever had it needed no justification or reason. Truth was a lie. And morality was only for the weak. However if this intellectual climate only emerged and became hegemonic in the late 1970s (think of Reagan and Thatcher) it of course was ever present behind the scenes in the dark corners of Western imperialism. For instance: America\u2019s leading strategist (and Russian \u201cexpert\u201d) after World War Two, George F. Kennan, famously put it into words in Memo PPS23 (1948):\\n\u201cWe have about 50% of the world\u2019s wealth but only 6.3% of its population\u2026.Our real task in the coming period is to devise a pattern of relationships, which will permit us to maintain this position of disparity. To do so we will have to dispense with all sentimentality\u2026.We should cease to talk about vague\u2026.unreal objectives such as human rights, the raising of living standards, and democratisation. The day is not far off when we are going to have to deal in straight power concepts. The less we are hampered by idealistic slogans, the better.\u201d\\nNietzsche could not have said it better himself. The question is though: has this elite Western approach to the world changed since Kennan wrote Memo PPS23? No \u2013 it has only become more crass. As a result this Nietzschean worldview is what Russia is up against today. But haven\u2019t we seen this before? Hasn\u2019t Nietzsche in another guise attacked Russia already? Have not the forces of irrationalism invaded Russia before? And did Russia not for our benefit defeat those forces of irrationalism? We still owe Russia.\\nSo let\u2019s support it today it by burying Nietzsche. And by resurrecting universal reason and all the ideals which are built upon it. Give modern secular life another chance. Not just in Syria but in the West too.\\n Aidan O\u2019Brien is a hospital worker in Dublin, Ireland.'"}, "time": 1742628378.5039668}
