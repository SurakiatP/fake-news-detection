This time around, the terror state gives us a small child blowing a chained prisoner\u2019s head off in an abandoned amusement park. [Heavy. com reports that the new video appeared on ISIS social media channels on Sunday, under the title \u201cSometimes With His Own Blood,\u201d but it has also been posted under the name \u201cHe Revived Me by His Blood. \u201d The footage was shot in Deir   Syria. The prisoners executed in the video are said to be Kurdish fighters.  Most of the children, dressed in military fatigues and stalking through an abandoned amusement park, executing prisoners tied to the inert rides, look to be around 10 years old. One of them performs a gruesome knife beheading on a captive. The UK Sun has a clip from this sequence, with the shocking violence and bloody aftermath edited out. According to a report at PJ Media, it ends with the victim\u2019s decapitated head sitting in the middle of the   ride while it slowly spins. The most horrifying sequence in the new video shows a much younger boy  \u2014   ARA News says he is 4 years old  \u2014   approaching a prisoner chained to the wall of a dusty old ball pit.
