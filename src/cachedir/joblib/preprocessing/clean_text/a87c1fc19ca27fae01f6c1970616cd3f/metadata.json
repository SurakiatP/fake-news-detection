Unfortunately for her, it\u2019s all going down mere days before the election for her desired presidency. As she faces this harsh but deserved reality, she encountered several Trump supporters in Pompano Beach, Florida, who chanted 3 brutal words, and her reaction is proof that she\u2019s guilty of it all. \\nWith only a little over a week to go before America votes for our next president, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign is publically imploding. It seems even her most devoted fans are questioning her actions, and their uneasiness will only increase once they see what she did when she encountered several Trump supporters chanting, \u201cLock her up.\u201d Pompano Beach \u2013 Clinton ran into some Trump supporters at an early voting site. pic.twitter.com/Lzbz1Pga1g \\n\u2014 Roberta Rampton (@robertarampton) October 30, 2016 \\nObviously, she\u2019s been living in her own corrupt world for many years and believes she\u2019s untouchable. However, people are now finally seeing who the real Hillary Clinton is \u2014 a crook and a criminal. When she encountered the vocal Trump supporters at an early voting site and heard what they were implicating, her reaction is exactly how a guilty person would respond \u2013 she ignored them, plastering that fake grin across her face. She ignored the folks screaming \"Lock her up!\" pic.twitter.com/SpgHvawvUr \\n\u2014 Roberta Rampton (@robertarampton) October 30, 2016 \\nOf course, some people may argue that her reaction is what anyone would do, but I believe the contrary. If you\u2019re innocent, you\u2019re going to want everyone to know you didn\u2019t do it and vocally deny any unexpected accusations. Of course, Hillary does the opposite as she has many years of practice on how to ignore people who call her out for her wrongdoings. \\nClearly, when FBI Director James Comey dropped his bombshell, reopening her criminal investigation, Hillary became frantic and desperate. She knows what she\u2019s done and how guilty she is. \\nNow, all she can do is pray nothing more comes to light before the big election. Sorry Hillary, not even your followers can be that dumb. I think it\u2019s safe to say, Comey just handed Donald Trump the presidency.'"}, "time": 1742563147.231163}
