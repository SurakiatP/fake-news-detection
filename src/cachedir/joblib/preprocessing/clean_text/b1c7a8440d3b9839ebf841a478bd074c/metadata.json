Mark Meadows ( ) said he was optimistic about the prospects of a bill to replace Obamacare getting a vote in the U. S. House of Representatives by the end of the week.  Meadows told host Sean Hannity he gave it a \u201cbetter than 80 percent\u201d chance of happening. \u201cWe are going to get the health care bill, hopefully,\u201d Meadows said. \u201cWe\u2019re informing a few other members to get a few more to yes. Obviously, the Democrats are not helping us on any of that, so it makes every \u2018yes\u2019 vote critical and every \u2018no\u2019 vote critical. \u201d \u201cWe may be at 22 [Republican] \u2018nos,\u2019 but I think a couple of those are looking at specific issues within their district,\u201d he continued. \u201cI can tell you that they\u2019re meeting earlier tonight, working on trying to address some of those concerns. I had three meetings this afternoon   \u2026     you know, I think the odds are still better than 80 percent that we still have a vote this week and I\u2019m optimistic that we\u2019re going to get it done for the president and the American people. We got to lower premiums. We got to make sure that we deliver. And I think we will. \u201d Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor'"}, "time": 1742564270.0236888}
