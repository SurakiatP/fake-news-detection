Apparently, he had decided that emails on Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin\u2019s home laptop computer should be examined further. But that didn\u2019t mean that the FBI had the legal authority to look at them yet. Actually, it didn\u2019t\u2014and still doesn\u2019t\u2014have that authority. What Did The FBI Find? \\nLet\u2019s remember, first, that the FBI was investigating Weiner\u2019s use of the internet to send sexts and photos to a 15-year-old girl. They searched a laptop that they say was used by both Weiner and Abedin, and they found emails from the State Department, forwarded by Huma Abedin from work to home. There is no indication that Hillary Clinton sent any emails to or received emails from Abedin on this computer. When Will We Know What\u2019s In The Emails? \\nNo one knows. The FBI needs a warrant to view the emails. The warrant for Weiner\u2019s emails and texts doesn\u2019t apply to emails that Weiner neither sent or received. As of Sunday afternoon, October 30, the FBI has not gotten a warrant to search the emails. Pending requests for search warrants are not usually made public, so we wouldn\u2019t know if the FBI has even asked for a warrant. Is Search Warrant Available? An Open Legal Question \\nAs the Washington Post reported on October 30, 2016, there are good reasons to think that the FBI would be denied a warrant to search the couple\u2019s computer for emails related to Clinton\u2019s tenure as Secretary of State when the purpose of the FBI\u2019s access was to review Weiner\u2019s recent emails and sext messages. By what logic would the FBI be justified opening emails to and from Huma Abedin\u2019s accounts from 2009 to 2013? Unfortunately, some people, especially conservatives, resist arguments based on the \u201ctechnicality\u201d of the Fourth Amendment. Comey\u2019s \u2018Explanation\u2019 \\nAccording to Yahoo News , as of Saturday night, the Department of Justice and FBI officials were discussing what to do next. Because the FBI did not have a warrant to read Abedin\u2019s emails, on Thursday, October 28, Comey accepted the investigators\u2019 recommendation that the Bureau \u201cseek access\u201d to them. On Friday, he sent a memo to FBI employees explaining that he felt he had to update Congress because of his previous testimony that the Clinton email investigation was finished. On the other hand, he didn\u2019t know yet what significance the emails would have. and he didn\u2019t want to create a \u201cmisleading impression.\u201d Violating Policy \\nThere seems to be no doubt that Comey\u2019s letter to Congress violated two long-standing tradition and policies: (1) prohibiting discussion of ongoing investigations; and (2) not taking actions to favor one side or another in elections. Two former Deputy Attorneys General, one Democrat and one Republican, publicly questioned Comey\u2019s fitness to lead the FBI because of it. In addition, others have pointed out that Comey has repeatedly gone beyond established limits in his discussions of the Clinton email investigation. \\nFeatured image from Liberal America media archives.
