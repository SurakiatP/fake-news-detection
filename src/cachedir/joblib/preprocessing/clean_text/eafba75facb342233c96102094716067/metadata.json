It\u2019s time for our governments to break rank with corporate lobbyists and redesign a trade policy that respects democracy and promotes the public interest,\u201d said Shira Stanton, trade policy adviser at Greenpeace EU. \\nCETA now faces a vote in the European Parliament and ratification by the parliaments of the EU\u2019s 28 countries. \\nIf it passes, CETA would create a legal system that allows corporations to sue governments for perceived loss of profit. That framework will also be put to scrutiny by the European Court of Justice and the German constitutional court, and if it fails to stand up would invalidate CETA. \\nThe deal has long been opposed on the grounds that it would harm human rights, democracy, and the climate, among other risks. \\nAlfred de Zayas, the United Nations independent expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order, said in a statement Saturday that each country should hold a referendum on signing the deal before doing so, warning that it was a \u201ccorporate-driven, fundamentally flawed treaty.\u201d \\n\u201cThere is a legitimate fear that CETA will dilute environmental standards, food security, and health and labor protection,\u201d he said. \u201cA treaty that strengthens the position of investors, transnational corporations, and monopolies at the expense of the public interest conflicts with the duty of states to protect all people under their jurisdiction from internal and external threats.\u201d \\nGlobal Justice Now (GJN) trade and migration campaigner Guido Tallman tweeted a picture of the massive deal and wrote, \u201cHere\u2019s CETA. Any MEP planning to vote for it, should be sure to read it first. All of it. So they know what they\u2019re voting for.\u201d \\nThroughout Europe this weekend, CETA opponents took to the streets to protest the signing. In London on Saturday, many posed outside the European Commission office dressed as zombies to symbolize CETA\u2019s seeming resurrection, urging commissioners to \u201cstop CETA rising from the dead.\u201d \\nIn Brussels, some protesters broke through a barricade and attempted to storm the European Commission building before being dragged away by police. \\nGJN executive director Nick Dearden said Saturday , \u201cThe signing ceremony . . . means that CETA has been brought back from the dead for now\u2014but it is a ticking time bomb. The Wallonia parliament has a promise that they will be able to stop the ratification of CETA when they get a formal vote on it, and unless there are substantial changes, they\u2014and hopefully other parliaments\u2014will use that veto.\u201d \\n\u201cCETA would open up our government to a deluge of court cases by North American multinational corporations and investors,\u201d Dearden continued. \u201cIt presents a threat to our ability to protect the environment, to protect the public and to limit the power of big banks. It\u2019s thoroughly undemocratic and must be stopped.\u201d \\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 License \\nNadia Prupis is a Common Dreams staff writer.
