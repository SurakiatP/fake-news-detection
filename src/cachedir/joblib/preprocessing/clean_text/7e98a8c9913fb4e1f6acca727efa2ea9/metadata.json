Recommended \\nThe rapid melting of one the largest glaciers on earth, the Totten Glacier in East Antarctica, could raise global sea level at least 2 meters by the end of the century, according to a new study (4 hours ago) \\n\u201c On top of that, glacier recession is leaving lakes that could burst and wash away villages or infrastructure downstream, \u201d says lead-author Simon Cook , a lecturer at the Manchester Metropolitan University in the UK. \\nEuropean Geosciences Union reports: \\nReceding glaciers also put water supply in the region at risk. Glacial meltwater is important for irrigation, drinking water and hydropower, both for mountain villages and large cities such as La Paz and El Alto. Throughout the year, the 2.3 million inhabitants of these two cities receive about 15% of their water supply from glaciers , with this percentage almost doubling during the dry season. Glacier retreat also means less water is available to supply rivers and lakes, such as southern Bolivia\u2019s Lake Poop\u00f3, which recently dried up . \\nThe new study is one of the first to monitor recent large-scale glacier change in Bolivia, to better understand how receding glaciers could affect communities in the country. \u201cThe novelty of our study lies in the bigger picture \u2013 measuring glacier change over all main glaciated ranges in Bolivia \u2013 and in the identification of potentially dangerous lakes for the first time,\u201d Cook says. \\nThe team measured glacier area change from 1986 to 2014 using satellite images from Landsat, the U.S. Geological Survey\u2019s and NASA\u2019s Earth observation programme. They found that the area of the Bolivian Andes covered by glaciers decreased from about 530 square kilometres in 1986 to only around 300 square kilometres in 2014, a reduction of 43%. Recommended Bodies Of Climbers Alex Lowe & David Bridges Found In Melting Glacier \\nThe remains of renowned American mountain climber Alex Lowe and his companion cameraman David Bridges have been found partially melting out of a glacier on Shishapangma, Tibet. The two climbers disappeared in a Himalayan avalanche 16 years ago while attempting to ascend the 14th highest mountain in the world. (4 hours ago) \\nAs glaciers recede, they leave behind lakes typically dammed by bedrock or glacial debris. Avalanches, rockfalls or earthquakes can breach these dams, or cause water to overflow them, resulting in catastrophic floods known as glacial lake outburst floods. The team reports that both the number and size of glacier lakes in the study region increased significantly from 1986 to 2014. \\nAfter studying glacier change, the researchers used their 2014 glacial-lake observations to identify the lakes where outburst floods could occur and present a hazard to populations. \u201cWe mapped hundreds of lakes,\u201d Cook explains. \u201cSome lakes are very small and pose little risk. Others are very large, but there\u2019s little or no possibility that they would drain catastrophically. Others are both large enough to create a big flood, and sit beneath steep slopes or steep glaciers, and could be dangerous.\u201d \\nThey identified 25 glacial lakes across the Bolivian Andes as potentially dangerous to communities and infrastructure, as they could result in very damaging floods. If the smallest of these 25 lakes was to drain completely, it would yield a flood with a peak discharge of 600 cubic metres per second. The largest could result in a discharge of over 125,000 cubic metres of water, about 50 times the volume of an Olympic swimming pool, in a second. \\nWhile measuring glacier area change was a relatively simple task, Cook says \u201cidentifying which lakes are dangerous is the million dollar question\u201d as there are various factors to take into account. \\n\u201cWe considered that a lake was dangerous if there were settlements or infrastructure down-valley from the lake, and if the slopes and glaciers around the lake were very steep, meaning that they could shed ice or snow or rock into the lake, which would cause it to overtop and generate a flood \u2013 a bit like jumping into a swimming pool, but on a much bigger scale!\u201d Recommended \\nA new study on antidepressants published in The BMJ has revealed that the risk of suicide and aggression in children and teens increases two-fold when they are prescribed drugs to treat depression. (4 hours ago) \\nSuch catastrophic floods have occurred in the region in the past. Dirk Hoffmann, a researcher at the Bolivian Mountain Institute and co-author in The Cryosphere study, recently documented a glacial lake outburst flood in the Apolobamba region that happened in 2009 and killed farm animals, destroyed cultivated fields and washed away a road that left a village isolated for months. \u201cAs those locations are very remote and far away from the cities, authorities at national level and the wider public are often not even aware of the new dangers that mountain dwellers are facing due to the impacts of climate change, and no appropriate measures are being taken,\u201d Hoffmann says. \\nCook says these events could be under-reported, suggesting the risk of such floods in the Bolivian Andes has been overlooked. \u201cWe heard of other [glacier lake outburst flood] events from villagers when we visited the Apolobamba region in 2015, but there is no mention of these in publications or papers, possibly because many of these communities are relatively remote.\u201d Hoffmann adds: \u201cA nation-wide risk assessment of potentially dangerous glacial lakes would be of great interest to local communities in glacier watersheds.\u201d \\nIn the study, the team also estimated that glacier area will be severely reduced by the end of the century, to about a tenth of the 1986 values. This would put communities even more at risk from water scarcity, Cook says. \u201cWe predicted in our study that most glaciers will be gone or much diminished by the end of the century \u2013 so where will the water come from in the dry season? Big cities like La Paz are partially dependent on meltwater from glaciers. But little is known about potential water resource stress in more remote areas. More work needs to be done on this issue.\u201d \\nThe team hope the study raises awareness about the rapid glacier loss in Bolivia, how it could change in the future, and how it could affect water supply and cause glacial lake outburst floods. \u201cUltimately, I hope that our results will be useful to people in Bolivia \u2013 governments, agencies, people living in rural areas and cities,\u201d Cook concludes. \\nThis research is presented in the paper \u2018Glacier change and glacial lake outburst flood risk in the Bolivian Andes\u2019 to appear in the EGU open access journal The Cryosphere on 20 October 2016.'"}, "time": 1742564301.6999116}
