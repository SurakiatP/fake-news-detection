In meetings between President Obama and President Xi Jinping of China, it has typically come up after half a dozen more pressing issues, like trade, cyberattacks and Beijing\u2019s aggressive moves in the South China Sea. Now, though, in a single   phone call with the president of Taiwan,   Donald J. Trump has thrust it back on the table. Not since President Richard M. Nixon met with Mao Zedong in 1972  \u2014   when the two issued the Shanghai Communiqu\u00e9 clarifying the status of Taiwan  \u2014   has an American leader so shaken up the diplomatic status quo on the issue. \u201cTaiwan is about to become a more prominent feature of the overall U. S.  relationship,\u201d said Jon M. Huntsman, who served as ambassador to China during Mr. Obama\u2019s first term. \u201cAs a businessman, Donald Trump is used to looking for leverage in any relationship. A President Trump is likely to see Taiwan as a useful leverage point. \u201d In the short run, Mr. Trump has rattled the entire region. Representatives of several Asian countries contacted the White House on Saturday to express concern, according to a senior administration official. In the longer term, officials in the Obama administration worry that the episode could not just ignite tensions across the Taiwan Strait but also inflame trade relations and embolden China in the South China Sea, where it has clashed with the Philippines, Vietnam and other neighbors over competing claims to reefs and shoals. Mr. Trump expressed no misgivings about taking the call from President Tsai   which was arranged beforehand at the initiative of the Taiwanese government, not Mr. Trump\u2019s camp. Mr. Trump bridled at suggestions that he had committed a faux pas, writing on Twitter on Friday evening that it was \u201cinteresting how the U. S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call. \u201d Nor did Mr. Trump or his aides make a gesture to reaffirm the One China policy, much to the chagrin of the White House. It fell to a spokesman for the National Security Council to affirm that the United States was not changing the policy. Under that policy, the United States formally recognized the People\u2019s Republic of China in 1979, abrogating its ties with Taiwan, as the Chinese leader, Deng Xiaoping, sought to bolster China\u2019s economy and create closer ties to the West. Whether Mr. Trump views the call as the beginning of a change in approach toward Taiwan is not clear. A person close to him insisted that he was just being polite in taking Ms. Tsai\u2019s call. But Stephen Yates, a former deputy national security adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney who is advising the Trump transition, said in an interview that people around Mr. Trump were well aware of the nuances of American policy toward Taiwan. Among   Republicans, there has always been a push to confront China by reaching out to Taiwan. In a statement on Friday, Senator Tom Cotton, the Arkansas Republican who was briefly believed to be a candidate for Mr. Trump\u2019s defense secretary, praised him for taking the call, saying it \u201creaffirms our commitment to the only democracy on Chinese soil. \u201d President Ronald Reagan antagonized China by inviting a delegation from Taiwan to his inauguration. Aides to President George W. Bush pressed him to take a more confrontational approach with China until the attacks of Sept. 11 reordered his priorities, increasing the need for him to cultivate China on counterterrorism and other issues. Tensions over Taiwan peaked under a Democratic president, Bill Clinton, who in March 1996 ordered two aircraft carrier battle groups into the Taiwan Strait after China conducted missile tests to intimidate the island. For some China experts, shaking up the   relationship would not be the worst thing in the world. \u201cWe have had a status quo of sorts in the Taiwan Strait that has kept the peace, but it recently has not looked all that durable, nor was it very agreeable to most citizens of democratic Taiwan,\u201d said Orville Schell, the director of the Center on U. S.  Relations at the Asia Society. \u201cWhether a new kind of Trumpian brinkmanship will now cause China to reconsider its   position towards Taiwan, or to respond in a dangerous and militant way, remains to be seen,\u201d he said. Mr. Trump has spoken harshly about China, accusing it of concocting climate change as a hoax to undercut American manufacturers, branding it a currency manipulator (when it in fact is trying to prop its currency up) and threatening to impose a 45 percent tariff on Chinese goods. Mr. Trump\u2019s trade advisers have also advocated punitive responses to what they portray as unfair Chinese actions. A few days after he was elected, however, Mr. Trump spoke with China\u2019s president, Mr. Xi, and released a statement afterward that said the two men had a \u201cclear sense of mutual respect. \u201d Taiwan is also likely to seek a closer relationship with the United States. After years of a Kuomintang government, which pursued closer China ties, Taiwan elected Ms. Tsai as its second president from the   Democratic Progressive Party. Analysts said that Ms. Tsai, though not a firebrand, was seeking to diversify Taiwan\u2019s economic partners and carve out more space for it in international affairs. There are also lingering questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s business dealings in Taiwan. The news media there has reported that the Trump Organization sent a representative to Taiwan to explore building a luxury hotel in a   development near Taipei\u2019s airport, though an official with the Trump Organization said it was not planning any expansion into Taiwan. The Trump Organization does not dispute that one of its employees  \u2014   assigned to promote hotel sales related to Asia  \u2014   was in Taipei, the capital, in October for a   visit. The duties of the executive,   Donoghue, include trying to find guests for the company\u2019s hotels worldwide, and she is not involved in developing new real estate projects for Trump Hotels. For the Chinese government, as for many other governments around the world, Mr. Trump\u2019s freewheeling diplomacy poses a challenge. At first, China\u2019s foreign minister, Wang Yi, played down the episode, saying it was a \u201cpetty action by the Taiwan side\u201d that would not upset the longstanding policy of One China. But hours later, the Chinese Foreign Ministry lodged a formal complaint with the Obama administration. It urged the United States to \u201chandle issues related to Taiwan carefully and properly to avoid causing unnecessary interference to the overall U. S.  relationship. \u201d David Shambaugh, the director of the China policy program at George Washington University, said Beijing\u2019s measured response made sense. But he said that if the Trump administration took more concrete steps to change   ways of dealing with Taiwan, \u201cthey can expect additional pushback from China. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563999.9306495}
