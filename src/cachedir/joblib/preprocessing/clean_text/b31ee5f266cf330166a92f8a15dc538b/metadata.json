Now it\u2019s been revealed that the FBI has been flooded with resignations letters by disenfranchised agents ever since Comey decided last July not to indict Hillary Clinton. Comey\u2019s now attempting to save face has reopened the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s private server claiming that the FBI has now found an additional 650,000 email messages on Anthony Weiner\u2019s laptop, ten thousand of which were found were in a folder called \u201cLife Insurance.\u201d Things are boiling up for the Clinton campaign, what an October surprise!\\n10,000 new emails found on Huma Abedin and Anthony Weiner\\'s computer and phones. They were in a file marked \"Life Insurance\". #Corruption \\n\u2014 Morgan Brittany (@MorganBrittany4) October 29, 2016 \\n\\nWeiner is under investigation for sending sexually explicit pictures and material to a 15 year old girl and it drags Hillary\u2019s campaign and chances of presidency with it..\\nHuma Mahmood Abedin, recently divorced from Weiner, has worked with Hillary Clinton since 1996, where she began as a white-house intern She quickly grew her political career to the position of vice chairman of the Hillary campaign.\\nWhat could be found on Huma Abedin and Anthony Weiner\u2019s laptop?\\nA source has a guess at what may potentially be found on Huma Abedin and Anthony Weiner\u2019s computer: Huma\u2019s long-speculated ties to the Muslim Brotherhood , something that U.S. Representative Michele Bachmann asserted in 2012 when she accused Huma Abedin of being a mole for the Muslim Brotherhood . Bachmann then said during a live broadcast interview that \u201cthe infiltration of our government is much wider than anyone expected.\u201d\\n\u201cIt appears that there has been deep penetration in the halls of our United States government by the Muslim Brotherhood,\u201d Bachmann stated during a radio interview. \u201cIt appears that there are individuals who are associated with the Muslim Brotherhood who have positions, very sensitive positions, in our Department of Justice, our Department of Homeland Security, potentially even in the National Intelligence Agency.\u201d \\n~U.S. Representative Michele Bachmann, said.\\nHuma actually hasn\u2019t been shy about her potential connection to the brotherhood, earlier in 2016 she confirmed that her Muslim Brotherhood-connected mother Saleha Mahmoud Abedin was proud of her .\\nSaleha Mahmoud Abedin was identified in 2011 as one of 63 suspected leaders inside the Muslim Sisterhood. \\nWell we are about to truly find out what was on the laptop of Huma Abedin as the FBI as of Sunday filed for the warrant needed to begin looking through the emails.\\nAgain my source asserts that, \u201cHuma Abedin was copying emails and printing them and she was labeled a threat by the FBI in it\u2019s own report about the Clinton investigation.\u201d \\nHuma herself said in an interview this week with a podcast that she has yet to read the emails she exchanged with her longtime boss, Hillary Clinton, but that she is \u201cmortified\u201d by what may be in them.\\n\u201cTerrifying,\u201d is how Abedin described the existence of the records in the public domain during an interview on the \u201cCall Your Girlfriend\u201d podcast.\\n\u201cI confess I have not read anything that has become public,\u201d Abedin, said.\\nComey has jumped on this chance to right his wrongs, seizing an opportunity to save his own career and reputation as well as the FBI\u2019s reputation which, according to a source, has been tarnished. Agents are not happy about the outcome and conduct of the former Director, including some agents that have decided enough is enough and are resigning in droves .\\nThe FBI director has been embroiled in an inside fight against his own agents worried about internal leaks. Comey said it himself in his reasoning for announcing the re-opening of the Clinton email investigation.\\nEx-FBI Assistant Director of New York, James Kallstrom weighed in on Comey\u2019s actions calling the Clintons a crime family . Kallstrom also acknowledged the fact that agents were rebelling within the ranks including senior agents. \\n\u201cThe agents are furious with what\u2019s going on, I know that for a fact,\u201d\\n\u2018The Clintons, that\u2019s a crime family. It\u2019s like organized crime, basically. The Clinton Foundation is a cesspool,\u201d \\n~former FBI, assistant director, James Kallstrom , said.\\nKallstrom additionally told Fox\u2019s Judge Jeanine Pirro, \u201cI think there is something happening, I think something big is going to happen,\u201d when confronted with the question on why Comey chose 2 weeks before the election to announce the re-opening of an investigation, politicizing the investigation.\\n\\nKallstrom made sure to not leave out that it was the higher power of the FBI to blame and not the field agents who were involved in the overall investigation into the Clintons server.\\nMeanwhile several FBI field offices and U.S. attorneys are busy investigating and collecting evidence on the Clinton Fraudation. The investigation backed by none other then the Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara, who is also investigating Anthony Weiner, who authorized the warrants for the devices to be seized. That means that Preet Bharara is behind both cases on the Clintons \u2013 the investigation into the Clinton Fraudation , in which Bharara is leading NY, DC, and Texas branches of the FBI\u2019s investigation into the Clinton\u2019s long time fraud vehicle the \u201cClinton Foundation\u201d. The Clinton Fraudation investigation was started when Terry Mccauflife was linked to the Clintons and the Chinese mob .\\nWikileaks has proven that the Clinton foundation is basically a large money-laundering operation sprinkled with a bit of fraud thanks to Doug Band. Although hacked documents can\u2019t be used for prosecution the new Wiener emails may be identical copies of Huma\u2019s emails that have been leaked in Wikileaks releases, and if it\u2019s true that she printed out copies she could face charges. Additionally there may be evidence of pay-to-play in Huma\u2019s emails as well as fraud, or potentially her ties to the Muslim Brotherhood.

OK. Because who knows?
