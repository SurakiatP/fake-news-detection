Here is the solution right under our noses. Ship them to Equatorial Guinea where the local dictator dines on human body parts. I\u2019m sure he has a good size freezer. \\nGood news for the Brits, next door to Equatorial Guinea is Cameroon. What did we hear about Cameroon recently? Oh yes, the large parasitic family from Cameroon (via France) to UK and how they feed off British taxpayers. Load them up and ship them back to Cameroon. The politician attached to them should be one named Dave Cameron. \\nMeanwhile back at the ranch in Equatorial Guinea, the son of the cannibal faces his own headlines: \\nTeddy the cannibal even dined at the White House back on August 5th, 2014. Per CNN: ~On Tuesday guests will dine on chilled tomato soup, a vegetable salad, and Wagyu beef (raised in Texas) that\u2019s been marinated in chermoula, a garlicky herb blend that\u2019s used in northern Africa. \u201cEven though it\u2019s an American beef we want to give it an African touch,\u201d Comerford explained, pointing to other ingredients like cinnamon, coffee and saffron that accent traditionally American dishes on the menu. Produce harvested from the White House garden will also appear. Like every aspect of the evening, the menu was created with the array of guests in mind. \u201cWe want to make sure that our Wagyu beef is all Halal, all of our purveyors make sure that everything we use is secure, came from reliable sources, and the things that we use here are wholesome and good for our guests,\u201d Comerford said.~ \\nOk then, no body parts.'"}, "time": 1742563235.7717538}
