She is also a Muslim who agrees with President Donald Trump\u2019s travel order and his effort to keep Americans safe. [In fact, Amaal and the eight other Libyans who were granted visas by the Trump State Department came to the United States to seek help from the United Nations and the United States to achieve stability in their country and to gain support for all Muslims in Libya, not just what Amaal calls \u201cpolitical Islam\u201d in power there, including the Muslim Brotherhood.  Members of that delegation, made up of tribal leaders and women activists and organized by the National Movement of Libya (NML) believe that the political processes led by the United Nations in Libya have been more accommodating to Islamists than tribes that represent much larger areas and far more people, partly due to the influence of foreign powers, including the United States under the Obama administration. \u201cI believe Trump is not fighting Muslims just because they are Muslims,\u201d Amaal told Breitbart News. \u201cAnd the decision he made, I can accept it   \u2026     because he has to make sure the people who enter America are not the wrong people. \u201d Amaal added that most Libyans are peaceful people who would not commit terrorists acts. \u201cThey were trying to empower political Islam in Libya,\u201d Amaal said. \u201dThis is the truth. \u201d Amaal said NML isn\u2019t advocating for the exclusion of Islamist groups, with the exception of terrorist groups, but that they want the U. N. to respect Libya\u2019s demographics and strengthen cooperation with tribal groups and representatives of cities and civil society. NML consists of groups that both supported and did not support Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi during the 2011 revolution, with members reconciling with the help of facilitators. During the delegation\u2019s visit to New York City and Washington, D. C. this week, members met with officials from the U. N. Security Council, the U. S. State Department, the U. N. Development Program, the Permanent Mission of the United Kingdom to the U. N. and the U. S. Institute for Peace. Amaal, who fled her country in 2014 after being targeted for activism for women\u2019s rights and human rights, including her efforts to be elected as the first female Libyan Prime Minister, said her countrymen who now live in the U. S. aren\u2019t united about the future of Libya. \u201cThere are some in the Libyan community in the United States that support the Muslim Brotherhood and are happy about what is happening in Libya,\u201d Amaal said. \u201cMany of those who support the Islamists have dual citizenship. But there are many American Muslims that work hard against terrorism, and we appreciate what they have done and are doing,\u201d she added. Libya has experienced years of violence and lawlessness since the   ouster of Kadhafi, with rival parliaments and governments trading barbs and militias fighting over territory and the country\u2019s vast oil wealth. Militias loyal to former prime minister Khalifa Ghweil, whose administration was replaced by the   government last year, have stepped up a campaign of defiance against its authority. For her part, Amaal plans to move back to a safe area in Libya and continue her activism. \u201cI want democracy,\u201d Amaal said. \u201cI want justice. \u201d The Libyan delegation was sponsored by the Network for Religious and Traditional Peacemakers and the Libya Institute for Advanced Studies, with the support of Finn Church Aid.'"}, "time": 1742563377.4531121}
