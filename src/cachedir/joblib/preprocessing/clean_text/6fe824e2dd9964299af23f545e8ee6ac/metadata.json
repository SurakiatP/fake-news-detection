[Across Germany, migrants from North Africa have been setting \u2018traps\u2019 for staff in prisons by \u201cgreasing\u201d doors handles, floors, and other surfaces that employees are forced to touch and walk over with bodily fluids, mainly faeces and blood.  NRW has acknowledged the problem for some time, but in November the state\u2019s justice minister Thomas Kutschaty was forced to admit the attacks have been growing more frequent.   cases in which \u201cdetainees from the Maghreb states have contaminated areas with blood   faeces\u201d were logged in 2016. At prisons in Iserlohn and Cologne, there were even incidents in which staff members were pelted with faeces. Head of Bielefeld Prison, Uwe Nelle Cornelsen, described \u201crestlessness, rioting, rebellion against lawyers, and suicide threats\u201d are typical problems staff have to deal with. He told the Neue Westf\u00e4lische that prisons \u201cmust remain consistent, and refuse to negotiate,\u201d reporting rumours that in some parts of the Maghreb, such tactics encourage centres to release detainees earlier. Along with \u201csecurity and discipline,\u201d integration centres and language courses form the core of a series of measures recently announced by NRW\u2019s justice ministry to tackle problem prisoners. Integration centres are being set up at each prison to \u201cdeal with problems between detainees and prison staff\u201d. So as to \u201cdecrease the language barrier\u201d facilities will also expand language courses on offer to prisoners, and hire more interpreters. A programme to provide tablets to staff in NRW jails, enabling them to translate their instructions into Arabic, is also set be rolled out across the state. Bridging the language gap is likely to succeed in preventing grotesque behaviour, according to a report in broadsheet Die Welt. This claimed that many migrants just \u201cwanted to be understood,\u201d and became calmer after conversing with staff in Arabic. The justice ministry hopes that hiring four \u2018Islam scientists\u2019 in addition to the two currently employed by the state will also ease tensions. As well as teaching prison staff to spot signs of Islamism in detainees, the \u2018Islam scientists\u2019 are also training employees to \u201cdeal with emotionally disturbed prisoners\u201d and instructing them in \u201cintercultural competence. \u201d One final measure announced by Kutschaty, to deal with the growing turmoil in NRW jails, is for faster expulsion of people from the Maghreb, who the justice minister said \u201chave little chance of being granted leave to remain [in Germany]. \u201d To this end, the Social Democratic Party (SPD) minister called for Germany to recognise North African nations as safe countries of origin, and said \u201ccollective charter flights\u201d could be used to deport Maghreb migrants who are causing trouble in prisons.'"}, "time": 1742563200.3978477}
