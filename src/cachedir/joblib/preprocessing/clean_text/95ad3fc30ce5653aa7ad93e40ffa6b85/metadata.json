The man was pulled off the building\u2019s facade and apprehended by police officers who had removed a glass panel on the 21st floor about three hours into his climb. By then, he had become a social media sensation, as people watched live videos posted on Facebook and Periscope, a live   app. A stream on Facebook from   in New York received more than four million views, and people commented along with the action. Clad in shorts and a   the climber began to scale the building around 3:30 p. m. the police said, wearing a harness and using what appeared to be suction cups to aid his climb. William Aubry, the New York Police Department\u2019s assistant chief of the Manhattan South detective squad, told reporters that the man was a    from Virginia who had told them he sought to scale the tower with one purpose: to gain a personal meeting with Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee. Police officials said he told them about a YouTube video he posted on Tuesday that explained his motives. In the widely shared video that matched the police\u2019s description, titled \u201cMessage to Mr. Trump (why I climbed your tower),\u201d a hooded man claimed he was an \u201cindependent researcher. \u201d \u201cBelieve me, if my purpose was not significant, I would not risk my life pursuing it,\u201d the man said solemnly. \u201cThe reason I climbed your tower was to get your attention. \u201d Police did not release the name of the man, whom they took to Bellevue Hospital Center for an evaluation. On Wednesday night, Mr. Trump expressed his appreciation for the police on Twitter, writing, \u201cGreat job today by the NYPD in protecting the people and saving the climber. \u201d Livestreaming, which increasingly draws wide audiences, has helped turn the outlandish happenings that occur periodically in a place like New York into viral public events. In June, a broadcast primarily seen on Periscope of a naked man whom the police described as \u201cemotionally disturbed\u201d became a similar public spectacle. With the climber\u2019s image being broadcast  \u2014   and commented on  \u2014   far and wide on Wednesday, the man perched, if only briefly, at the intersection of two unpredictable worlds: the combustible presidential campaign and the chaotic city beneath him. The climb and frenzy that followed were also the latest instance in which Trump Tower has starred in a noteworthy role during the campaign. The building on Fifth Avenue, the site of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign launch and his residence, has prompted some of the same strong emotions as those inspired by the candidate himself. It has been a magnet for those making political statements: a protester in a Ku Klux   hood who tussled with security guards in September 200 marchers in December   activists in the spring. It has also been the site of a zoning tussle, magnified by the stakes of the presidential election, after the Trump Organization was forced to remove a Trump kiosk from its lobby, which had been designated as a public space as part of an agreement that allowed the developer to add 20 stories to the building\u2019s height. And it has burnished its status as a tourist attraction, drawing more than one million visitors every year from around the globe. On Wednesday, hundreds of people gawked from the streets below, filming the climb with cameras and phones, oohing after the man dropped an object. Some cheered for him, remarking on the difficulty of his climb. \u201cYou will never believe what I just saw,\u201d a woman leaving the commotion said into her cellphone. Aaron Hesseltine, 17, in town with his family from Saranac Lake, N. Y. to see Alex Rodriguez\u2019s last game with the Yankees, watched for an hour and a half, documenting the experience on Snapchat for his friends at home. His last missive showed the moment the climber disappeared into the opening. \u201dThey got him,\u201d it read.'"}, "time": 1742564502.4128935}
