His isolationism \u201ccould give Africans a chance to recalibrate what is now an excessive, self-destructive reliance on export of oil and gas, minerals and cash crops.\u201d On climate policy, Trump is an unmitigated disaster. What Does a Trump Victory Mean for Africa? by Patrick Bond \\nThis article previously appeared in Pambazuka News . \\n\u201c Trump will sabotage the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and similar strategies to solve global problems.\u201d \\nThe most catastrophic long-term consequence is climate change. This is because Trump is a denialist who will give the green light to widespread fracking, coal and oil exploration. Africa will be the most adversely affected continent. United Nations scientists estimate that 9 out of 10 small-scale farmers are unlikely to farm by 2100 due to drying soils and global warming, plus extreme weather will also cause 180 million unnecessary African deaths by then, according to Christian Aid. \\nUnder Trump, we can safely predict that Washington will no longer seek to control United Nations climate negotiations, as did Barack Obama\u2019s administration. The WikiLeaks Clinton emails and State Department cables revealed blatant manipulations of the Copenhagen and Durban climate summits. Instead, Trump will simply pull the US out of the 2015 Paris agreement, as did George W. Bush from the Kyoto Protocol. \\nBy good fortune, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change annual summit is underway this week in Morocco. The only logical move, if the delegates have any spine, is to expel the US State Department and establish the machinery for a major carbon tax applied to products associated with countries \u2013 the US especially \u2013 which raise emissions and threaten the survival of many species across the globe. \\n\u201cTrump will simply pull the US out of the 2015 Paris agreement, as did George W. Bush from the Kyoto Protocol.\u201d \\nTrump also heralds a rise in US racism and xenophobia, parallel to the Brexit vote by the British white working class. In neither case will local solutions be effective for the simple reason that neither Trump nor Theresa May (UK Prime Minister) are interested in the income redistribution required to benefit their economies. \\nAnd African elites who have \u2013 with a few exceptions \u2013 climbed over each other to please Washington, won\u2019t find themselves welcome in the White House. \\nHopefully the contagion of Trump\u2019s racism \u2013 which will make life for Africans much harder \u2013 will be met by a major resistance movement including Africans from all walks of life in solidarity with various groups that stand to be oppressed by the US \u2013 women, African-Americans, Latinos, Muslims, environmentalists, progressives of all sorts. This movement can shape up in the same spirit to those that gave solidarity during the fight against apartheid. \\nWhat are the likely economic consequences? \\nConsistent with his isolationism, world trade stagnation will continue. In the case of Africa, Trump is likely to retract benefits under the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act and reduce US aid. \\nThat isolationism, in turn, could give Africans a chance to recalibrate what is now an excessive, self-destructive reliance on export of oil and gas, minerals and cash crops. Africa must focus on localizing its economies to be able to meet basic needs. \\nTrump\u2019s hatred of what he terms the \u201cglobalists\u201d is probably just hot electioneering rhetoric. It\u2019s fair to predict that pro-corporate candidates will come forward as Trump allies to calm the crashing stock markets. \\nThe \u201cneoliberal\u201d group of policy wonks who expressed disgust with Trump and favored Hillary Clinton will quickly make inroads into the new administration. They will ensure that the continuing US dominance in Western-leaning multilateral institutions is not disturbed. \\nWe can simply anticipate more brazen US self-interest, as witnessed during the Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush regimes, with less of the confusing rhetoric promoted by Obama and his allies. \\nWhat US policies on Africa are likely to change? With what impact? \\nTo be frank, we can only offer guesses. Trump said literally nothing about Africa during his campaign. He wants to \u201crebuild US military power,\u201d which might include strengthening the Pentagon\u2019s controversial Africa Command, known as Africom. \\nEconomically, it is worth noting Trump\u2019s close relations to the oil and gas industry which comes via Vice President Mike Pence. This suggests that multinational corporations in the extractive industries who desire more explicit imperial support for African adventurism will be served well by Trump\u2019s bully-boy mentality. \\nWhat does this mean for multilateral institutions and how will this affect Africa? \\nThe US\u2019s role in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will become nastier given the veto power it enjoys, holding more than 15% of the voting shares. Trump will probably hire a brutal neoliberal as his IMF executive director, someone who will tighten the screws on Africa using Washington\u2019s veto power. The leaders of two big African economies are desperate for IMF credits: Nigeria ($29 billion) and Egypt ($12 billion). \\nIn relation to the United Nations, an interesting question comes to mind: should the UN leadership now sitting in Trump\u2019s Manhattan East Side neighborhood not develop a contingency plan to move UN headquarters out of the US? Trump promises to make life very hard for visitors who are Muslims, Libyans, Syrians and Mexicans \u2013 amongst others \u2013 so holding multilateral events in the US may soon be impossible. \\nThe period ahead demands a very different multilateralism due to a number of expectations. The first is that Trump will sabotage the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and similar strategies to solve global problems, and wreck nuclear non-proliferation strategies such as the agreement that Obama painstakingly reached with Iran earlier this year. \\nAnd the second is that three of the BRICS\u2019 nationalistic leaders \u2013 Vladimir Putin in Russia, Nahendra Modi in India and Michel Temer in Brazil \u2013 can be expected to establish much closer ties to Trump. This is likely to affect the balance of power between geographical regions, added to which are the drift of Pakistan, Turkey and the Philippines away from Washington. Trump\u2019s hatred of China is another indeterminate factor. \\nRegardless of the geopolitical maneuvers, it\u2019s time for a \u2018multilateralism-from-below\u2019 in which traditional progressive movements in civil society find common cause, because this is the most serious threat to humanity, the world economy and environment we\u2019ve seen in living memory.
