It would be difficult to overstate Mr. Marshall\u2019s effect on American entertainment. His work in network television and Hollywood movies fattened the archive of romantic, family and buddy comedies and consistently found the sweet spot smack dab in the middle of the mainstream. Indeed, Mr. Marshall was one of the forces directing that mainstream, working with   stars from the 1960s (Lucille Ball and Danny Thomas, among others) into the early years of the 21st century (Anne Hathaway, for instance, whom he directed in the      film \u201cThe Princess Diaries\u201d). Beginning in the \u201860s, his television work alone included writing scripts for the     comedies \u201cMake Room for Daddy\u201d (with Mr. Thomas) \u201cThe Lucy Show\u201d and \u201cThe Dick Van Dyke Show. \u201d In 1970, with Jerry Belson, a frequent early writing partner, he adapted Neil Simon\u2019s play \u201cThe Odd Couple\u201d into the ABC television series of the same name, starring Tony Randall and Jack Klugman as the mismatched roommates, the neatnik Felix and the slob Oscar. Mr. Marshall went on to create, in 1974, \u201cHappy Days,\u201d a fondly nostalgic parody of   life in the 1950s and early \u201960s featuring a roster of stereotypical young people, including Ron Howard as Richie, the straight arrow, and Henry Winkler as the rebellious,   charmer known as the Fonz. (The lawyer Martin Garbus, who was a friend of Mr. Marshall\u2019s from their early teens, and who confirmed the death, said in an interview that he was the model for Richie and that the other characters in the show were generally based on Mr. Marshall\u2019s friends from the Bronx, though \u201cHappy Days\u201d was set in Milwaukee.) A hit in itself, the show begat other hits. One featured the charmingly innocent, logorrheic space alien Mork, from Ork, played by Robin Williams, who appeared in a \u201cHappy Days\u201d episode in early 1978 and became the central character in \u201cMork  Mindy,\u201d a show created by Mr. Marshall with Joe Glauberg and Dale McRaven. They set Mork down in Boulder, Colo. where he befriends a young woman, played by Pam Dawber, who patiently teaches him the ways of earthlings and eventually marries him. \u201cHappy Days\u201d lent another   show, \u201cLaverne  Shirley,\u201d both a setting and its main characters. Created by Mr. Marshall with Lowell Ganz and Mark Rothman, it was about a pair of   single women  \u2014   Laverne DeFazio, played by Mr. Marshall\u2019s younger sister Penny, and Shirley Feeney, played by Cindy Williams  \u2014   who work at a brewery. They had been introduced to the \u201cHappy Days\u201d audience when they went on a double date with the Fonz and Richie. \u201cGarry Marshall had a feel for Everyman,   comedy that matched exactly the young,   audience that made up the base of ABC\u2019s appeal,\u201d Bill Carter, the former longtime television reporter for The New York Times and now a commentator for CNN, said in an email. \u201cHe was the dominant figure in the rise of that long downtrodden network to a run of ratings supremacy in the 1970s. It was the first time ABC had ever ascended to the top of television. \u201d Mr. Marshall began directing movies in the 1980s. Several were   star vehicles that dealt with mismatched pairs: \u201cNothing in Common\u201d (1986) a reconciliation story with Jackie Gleason and Tom Hanks as cantankerous father and resentful son \u201cOverboard\u201d (1987) which proposes that a meanspirited heiress with amnesia (Goldie Hawn) can be persuaded to believe she is the wife of a carpenter (Kurt Russell) and, most famously, \u201cPretty Woman\u201d (1990) a Cinderella tale  \u2014   and a gigantic hit  \u2014   set in contemporary Los Angeles, about a hooker with a heart of gold (Julia Roberts) and her Prince Charming, a ruthless corporate raider (Richard Gere). Mr. Marshall once confessed that he wanted to be \u201cthe Norman Rockwell of television. \u201d \u201cI like to do very romantic, sentimental type of work,\u201d he told The  Times as \u201cPretty Woman\u201d was being released. \u201cIt\u2019s a dirty job, but somebody has to do it. \u201d As an actor, Mr. Marshall appeared frequently in small roles, cast usually to take advantage of his casually blunt manner and distinctly nasal Bronx accent, perhaps best exemplified by a scene in Albert Brooks\u2019s comedy \u201cLost in America\u201d (1985) in which he played a Las Vegas casino manager whom Mr. Brooks harangues in an attempt to get him to return the money he lost gambling. When Mr. Brooks says the casino could be like the Gimbels department store in the Christmas movie \u201cMiracle on 34th Street,\u201d profiting from an act of beneficence, Mr. Marshall is the personification of flabbergasted. \u201cIn that movie, Santy Claus took care of everything,\u201d he says in the film. \u201cThere was Macy\u2019s, Gimbels, but Santy Claus came and he fixed the whole thing. We don\u2019t have Santy Claus. \u201d Garry Kent Marshall was born in the Bronx on Nov. 13, 1934. His father, who was born Anthony Masciarelli but changed the family name, made industrial films. Mr. Marshall recalled them in an interview in 2000 with the Archive of American Television. \u201c\u2018The Story of Zinc,\u2019 \u2018Smelting in the Pittsburgh Mill\u2019  \u2014   we watched them,\u201d he said. \u201cNot one laugh. \u201d His mother, the former Marjorie Ward, taught dance classes in the basement of their apartment building. She was also the family wit, Mr. Marshall said, who introduced him to   humor, \u201cwhich became one of the great tools of humor throughout my career. \u201d \u201cMy mother was funnier than anybody I ever worked for,\u201d he said in the 2000 interview, fingering his sport jacket. \u201cMy father was as funny as this coat. Not a laugh a minute, my father. \u201d As a boy, Mr. Marshall learned to play the drums, and he was a good athlete a shortstop, he admired Phil Rizzuto of the Yankees and was known as Flip, he said, for the way he tossed the ball. He used that nickname later when he performed in nightclubs. Adding his father\u2019s former surname, he called himself Flip Masciarelli  \u2014   a creative hiccup away from the name of one of his   characters, Arthur Fonzarelli, a. k. a. the Fonz. Mr. Marshall attended Public School 80 and DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx and graduated from Northwestern University, where, he recalled in an interview with The Wall Street Journal in May, \u201cI realized words mattered and I studied journalism. \u201d When his mother died in 1983, Mr. Marshall and his family donated $1 million to Northwestern to name a building in his mother\u2019s name: The Marjorie Ward Marshall Dance Center. Mr. Marshall joined the Army in 1956 and served in South Korea before returning to New York, where he worked briefly for The Daily News, did his comedy routines at night and wrote jokes for the comedian Joey Bishop and others. In the early 1960s he moved to Los Angeles, where he met a nurse, Barbara Sue Wells they married in 1963. In addition to her, his survivors include a son, Scott two daughters, Lori and Kathleen two sisters, Ms. Marshall, the actor and director, and Ronny Hallin, a producer and six grandchildren. Mr. Marshall wrote episodes for many of the shows he created, and he contributed to other   series, including \u201cGomer Pyle: U. S. M. C.,\u201d a spinoff of \u201cThe Andy Griffith Show,\u201d starring Jim Nabors the buddy adventure drama \u201cI Spy,\u201d with Robert Culp and Bill Cosby and the omnibus sitcom \u201cLove, American Style. \u201d Not all of his series were big winners. Among his   and less successful were \u201cHey Landlord,\u201d about a young man from Ohio who inherits a New York apartment building \u201cMe and the Chimp,\u201d about a dentist (Ted Bessell) and his family, who adopt, well, a chimp \u201cAngie,\u201d about a waitress (Donna Pescow) who marries a wealthy young doctor (Robert Hays) and \u201cJoanie Loves Chachi,\u201d another \u201cHappy Days\u201d spinoff, starring Erin Moran and Scott Baio. Mr. Marshall\u2019s other films include \u201cBeaches\u201d (1988) a melodrama about the trials and tribulations of a   friendship between two women, played by Barbara Hershey and Bette Midler \u201cFrankie and Johnny\u201d (1991) based on a play by Terrence McNally, about the courtship of a waitress (Michelle Pfeiffer) by a persistent     cook (Al Pacino) \u201cRunaway Bride\u201d (1999) a   reuniting Ms. Roberts and Mr. Gere as a      repeat offender and the journalist who writes about her and, in his last few years, a handful of comedies with   ensembles telling a variety of stories revolving around holidays: \u201cValentine\u2019s Day\u201d (2010) New Year\u2019s Eve\u201d (2011) and \u201cMother\u2019s Day\u201d (2016). A theater buff, Mr. Marshall built a   performance space in Burbank, Calif. and opened it as the Falcon Theater in 1997 it began a   subscription series in 2002. He also tried his hand at playwriting, with limited success. His   play, \u201cWrong Turn at Lungfish,\u201d written with Lowell Ganz, was a bittersweet   comedy about a dying, sightless and cantankerous old intellectual, a perky, uneducated young woman who volunteers to read to him, and her lunkhead of a boyfriend. It was presented at Steppenwolf in Chicago and in 1993 Off Broadway, directed by Mr. Marshall with George C. Scott, Jami Gertz and Tony Danza in the leading roles. Mr. Marshall is the author of two memoirs, both written with his daughter Lori: \u201cWake Me When It\u2019s Funny: How to Break Into Show Business and Stay\u201d (1995) and \u201cMy Happy Days in Hollywood\u201d (2012). \u201cCritics have knocked me for targeting society\u2019s lowest common denominator,\u201d Mr. Marshall said in the earlier book. \u201cI believe that television was, and still is, the only medium that can truly reach society\u2019s lowest common denominator and entertain those people who maybe can\u2019t afford a movie or a play. So why not reach them and do it well? \u201cWhen I produced a television show I didn\u2019t just roll out of bed each morning and say, \u2018I\u2019m going to make some rich, smart and successful people laugh.\u2019 I thought, \u2018Let them get their own laughs.\u2019 They have the money to pay for it. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563952.3561249}
