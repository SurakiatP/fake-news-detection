There was that beautiful girl, killing time in the big city while her fianc\u00e9 was away the   flirtation with a dreamy playboy the unhappily married rich man starting to fall apart the swirl of   aristocrats, Russia at war, and a comet streaking across the sky. This section of \u201cWar and Peace,\u201d Dave Malloy thought, would make a perfect musical. That was in 2007, on an ocean liner traveling from New York to Bermuda Mr. Malloy, a struggling musician, was earning his keep in the house band and passing the time talking Tolstoy, via email and phone calls, with his onshore girlfriend. Now, nine years later, the musical birthed from that passage, \u201cNatasha, Pierre  the Great Comet of 1812,\u201d is about to open on Broadway. It is one of the most anticipated shows of the season, and one of the most unusual, pairing a group of experimental downtown theatermakers with Josh Groban, a   pop singer from the mellifluous mainstream. They\u2019re all making their Broadway debuts, as are most of the actors  \u2014   in all, 24 members of the cast and creative team. The show, like most Broadway ventures, is an expensive gamble: in this case, a $14 million bet that what was once a wild night of   storytelling (in its first incarnation, the show provided free vodka at every table) can retain its sense of intimacy and authenticity in a vastly expanded space while broadening its appeal beyond adventurous theatergoers to the tourists who sustain commercially successful musicals. The core creative team  \u2014   the    composer, Mr. Malloy the    director, Rachel Chavkin and the    set designer, Mimi Lien  \u2014   is optimistic. As daunting as selling an adaptation of \u201cWar and Peace\u201d to a mass audience may seem, Mr. Malloy notes that the   tenant of the Imperial Theater, where \u201cThe Great Comet\u201d begins previews Oct. 18 and opens Nov. 14, was also an adaptation of a sweeping   historical novel  \u2014   Victor Hugo\u2019s \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d  \u2014   and these days no one questions that tome\u2019s marketability as a musical. \u201c\u2018War and Peace\u2019 wouldn\u2019t have lasted 200 years if he hadn\u2019t really tapped into something universal,\u201d Mr. Malloy said, speaking during an interview in his Brooklyn studio, with a portrait of Tolstoy on the wall, Christmas lights still strung over a    piano, a bookcase groaning with volumes of Marvel comics, and a bottle of whiskey atop a  . Mr. Malloy has little interest in writing the   dramas that dominate contemporary theater, and instead said he finds himself drawn to classical literature for subject matter. He first drew attention with a \u201csongplay\u201d celebration of \u201cBeowulf,\u201d is now working on a musicalization of \u201c\u201d and has even tried adapting the Zhuangzi, a foundational Taoist text. He jokes (or dreams?) about an \u201cimpossible novels trilogy\u201d: \u201cWar and Peace,\u201d \u201c \u201d and \u201cUlysses. \u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a perverse interest in picking the texts that have a reputation as being boring,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, no: \u2018War and Peace\u2019 is an amazing book, and here\u2019s all the reasons why. It\u2019s a trashy romance novel. It\u2019s not this unapproachable academic piece. \u201d The Broadway production is the fourth for \u201cThe Great Comet. \u201d The musical, then billed as an \u201celectropop opera,\u201d was commissioned by, workshopped, and first staged, in 2012, at a   Off Broadway nonprofit, Ars Nova, with 87 seats, rented costumes for the actors and Costco pierogies for the audience. \u201cBy the end of the first workshop, I remember thinking, I have no idea what\u2019s going on, but this is going to be incredible,\u201d recalled Jason Eagan, the company\u2019s founding artistic director. (The show was the biggest ever undertaken by Ars Nova, and will be its first ever to transfer to Broadway.) Mr. Malloy had a strong sense of what he wanted the show to feel like, shaped by two experiences: a boozy night at Chez Poulet, a San Francisco warehouse space where \u201cBeowulf\u201d was performed   with actors staging their fighting among the drinkers and another at Cafe Margarita, a Moscow bar with an unmarked door where musicians were    with     diners, so crowded that Mr. Malloy had a viola at his ear. As collaborators for \u201cThe Great Comet,\u201d he enlisted two friends who shared his passion for erasing lines between performers and audiences: Ms. Chavkin, a founder of an experimental theater company called the Team, and Ms. Lien, a college architecture major who had studied painting in Italy before finding her way to set design. \u201cThe goal from the beginning has been remarkably the same: putting the performers in close proximity to the audience members, and putting the audience members in very close proximity to each other, sitting at a table together, drinking vodka and eating bread,\u201d said Ms. Lien, who last year won a MacArthur Foundation \u201cgenius grant\u201d in part for her work on this show. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much a show that you sit back and watch from a distance, but it\u2019s an experience that you\u2019re actually inside of,\u201d she added. The Ars Nova staging, which ran for just 39 performances, was a sensation, as much for the environmental production as the energetic storytelling: In an effort to disorient patrons, Ms. Lien routed ticketholders downstairs and past dressing rooms into a makeshift nightclub where actors and musicians performed atop bars and between banquettes while patrons ate black bread and rattled shakers. Mr. Malloy not only conducted the   band but also played the piano and the accordion and starred as Pierre Natasha was portrayed by a recent (and radiant) Juilliard graduate named Phillipa Soo, who was later seen in the role by   Miranda and cast as Eliza in \u201cHamilton. \u201d Howard Kagan, a board member at Ars Nova, was taken with the show  \u2014   at first, he thought of it as mostly an unusual experience, akin to \u201cSleep No More,\u201d but then he began to focus on the songs, and decided, with his wife and   Janet Kagan, to test its   promise. The first commercial production, beginning in 2013, was in a tent, named \u201cKazino,\u201d erected on an empty lot in Manhattan\u2019s meatpacking district, with full dinner service (for big spenders, a seafood tower with caviar was available) and then in Midtown (this time as a supperless supper club) on a lot, as luck would have it, next to the Imperial. Late last year, \u201cGreat Comet\u201d opened at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass.  \u2014   the first time in a   house, as a chance to test how the enveloping design and peripatetic players might work in a conventional auditorium. Each production featured vodka (on Broadway, to be sold by vendors walking through the aisles) and free pierogies (on Broadway, served flaky and in boxes, after the   variety tested in Cambridge proved too messy). But with each move, the show has changed: songs rewritten and replaced, an ensemble and then roving musicians hired, a dance break inserted. A handful of defining visual elements have remained: a bleak, unexpected entrance passage (meant to evoke images of a Cold   bunker) a performance space cocooned entirely in red velvet drapery (opulence) walls covered with Russian paintings hung   (aristocracy) multiple chandeliers (the opera) including one giant \u201cSputnik\u201d chandelier (a comet). The Imperial is being rejiggered to preserve the immersive feel: a couple hundred people will be seated on the stage new internal staircases will permit performers to move between orchestra and mezzanine there will be side tables with lamps and egg shakers interspersed among the seats, along with snaking platforms to allow for elevated action by actors. Among those who came to check out the tent production was Mr. Groban, who has sold more than 35 million albums and DVDs and has long wanted to perform theater. He tweeted his enthusiasm for the material later, the Kagans, looking for a star who could help them justify a Broadway transfer, reached out to him, just as he was also urging his agent to look for stage roles. After an introductory phone call (at 4 a. m. for Mr. Malloy, who was then in Berlin) Mr. Groban, Mr. Malloy and Ms. Chavkin met at the Weather Up bar in TriBeCa as they all began imagining what it might be like for the famed singer to take direction from emerging artists. \u201cI didn\u2019t at all want to push myself into this project, but I wanted to make my interest known,\u201d Mr. Groban said. \u201cIt had to be something they felt would be right. \u201d Mr. Malloy wound up visiting the singer\u2019s apartment, so the two could see what it felt like to sing through, and talk about, the score. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to work with a diva,\u201d Mr. Malloy said. \u201cIt turned out he\u2019s supercollaborative. \u201d Over the last few weeks, as Mr. Groban wrapped up a tour and began preparing for rehearsals, Mr. Malloy has been looking for places to trim the score, while Ms. Lien has overseen construction of the set at Hudson Scenic Studio in Yonkers. Ms. Chavkin has been holed up with her choreography team at the New 42nd Street Studios, moving pennies around theater blueprints to try to plot entrances and exits and quick costume changes. Broadway beckons  \u2014   the production bigger and grander, but, they hope, at heart unchanged. \u201cThe whole beauty of the show is to make you feel like stuff\u2019s happening everywhere, and that everyone\u2019s having a different experience but no one is missing a central action,\u201d Ms. Chavkin said. \u201cWe want to make sure everyone is feeling the life of the show. \u201d With each step toward Broadway, \u201cNatasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812\u201d has grown.
