(And entirely devoid of women.) Instead, his economic circle  \u2014   as he promised  \u2014   is a bit, shall we say, less typical. The prominent of the    list of economists includes only one Ph. D. Peter Navarro, a professor at the University of California, Irvine and longtime opponent of free trade who blames China for America\u2019s economic ills Stephen Moore, a   advocate who   the   group Club for Growth and David Malpass, a consultant and former chief economist at Bear Stearns. The group is heavy on moguls and   moguls  \u2014   all, of course, Trump donors. Among them are Steven Roth, a real estate mogul who owns a building with Mr. Trump Harold Hamm, the billionaire wildcatter John A. Paulson, the billionaire hedge fund manager Steve Feinberg, the   of Cerberus, the private equity firm and Dan DiMicco, former president and chief executive of the steel company Nucor Corporation, who has been vocal about bringing manufacturing jobs back to the United States. Wilbur Ross, the famed venture capitalist, was left off the original list but later added on Trump\u2019s website Mr. Ross said that his team hadn\u2019t gotten back to the candidate in time to be included last week. And for those keeping score, Carl Icahn, the activist investor and longtime Trump backer, said he was left off the list so he could start a \u201csuper PAC,\u201d which he said would not be allowed if he were a formal member of the campaign. Then again, Mr. Trump has made a virtue of his lack of traditional support, depicting himself as an   candidate willing to make difficult choices. He sent a tweet saying as much earlier this week, showing a picture of him and Ms. Clinton under the headline \u201cCampaign Contributions from Hedge Funds. \u201d It showed Ms. Clinton received $48. 5 million from the hedge fund industry while Mr. Trump received only $19, 000. \u201cCrooked Hillary Clinton is 100% owned by her donors,\u201d he wrote. The tweet and his economics council are a bit of mixed message, given that he is trying to raise money from the financial industry and clearly has some support  \u2014   even some from traditional Republican circles. On Monday, for instance, George P. Bush, the son of Jeb (who is  ) came out in favor of the Republican candidate, urging all party members to support Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump\u2019s challenge is he is trying to be two things at the same time: distinctly   yet absolutely elite. This is particularly tough given he wants to be seen as a successful billionaire businessman while also being an outsider trying to work for the little guy. That said, while Mr. Trump may relish his unconventional group, he has been quietly trying to get some more establishment voices to join him. But many of the most prominent Republican donors have been doing their best to avoid associating with him. Stephen Schwarzman,   of the Blackstone Group, met with Mr. Trump, but has so far refused to donate or publicly support him, according to people briefed on the meeting. Henry Kravis, who historically has voted for Republicans and donated money to them, has been relatively silent. (When Mr. Trump floated his name for Treasury secretary, Mr. Kravis said, \u201cThat was scary when he said that. \u201d) Ken Griffin, the founder of Citadel, would seem like a natural Trump supporter, given that he describes himself as a \u201cReagan Republican. \u201d He has donated to Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Scott Walker, but not to Mr. Trump. Cliff Asness, the billionaire founder of AQR, an investment management firm, has historically supported Republicans, but called Mr. Trump \u201ca disaster for the G. O. P. and for the country. \u201d In March, he seemed to bend a little, saying, \u201cI have to keep a more open mind,\u201d but his spokesman said on Monday that he hadn\u2019t changed his position. Paul Singer, one of the biggest Republican donors, has been part of the #NeverTrump campaign, saying his policies would be \u201ca guarantee of a global depression. \u201d The list goes on. Seth Klarman, who runs the hedge fund Baupost, has often supported Republicans even though he is an independent. Last week he issued a blistering statement about Mr. Trump while throwing his weight behind Mrs. Clinton. \u201cHis words and actions over the last several days are so shockingly unacceptable in our diverse and democratic society that it is simply unthinkable that Donald Trump could become our president,\u201d Mr. Klarman said. Traditional Republican economists have also kept their distance. Glenn Hubbard, the dean of Columbia Business School, who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush, wrote, \u201cThe   and   policies of Mr. Trump portend a   future for all Americans, and   and   Americans in particular. \u201d Greg Mankiw, a Harvard economist who succeeded Mr. Hubbard as chairman of President Bush\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers and also advised Mitt Romney, said of Mr. Trump: \u201cHe will not be getting my vote. I have Republican friends who think that things couldn\u2019t be worse than doubling down on Obama policies under Hillary Clinton. And, like them, I am no fan of the left\u2019s agenda of large government and high taxes. But they are wrong: Things could be worse. And I fear they would be under Mr. Trump. \u201d Mr. Ross, a Trump supporter, said he thought the candidate\u2019s economic speech in Detroit on Monday might prove to be a positive turning point. \u201cHe did a very good job,\u201d Mr. Ross said after the speech. \u201cIf he just stuck to that, he\u2019d be in a lot better shape. \u201d Mr. Ross called Mr. Trump \u201csubstantive\u201d and said he was particularly impressed by \u201cthe whole way he reacted to the staged demonstrators. \u201d It was \u201cmature\u201d of Mr. Trump to refrain from taking the bait and getting angry, Mr. Ross said. The question is, if Mr. Trump adjusts his behavior over the next several weeks, will some of those establishment names come join his   band?'"}, "time": 1742562633.9522762}
