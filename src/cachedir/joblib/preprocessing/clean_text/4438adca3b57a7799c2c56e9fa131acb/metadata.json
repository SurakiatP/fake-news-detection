He was 74. His death was confirmed by Bob Gunnell, a family spokesman. The cause was septic shock, a family spokeswoman said. Ali, who lived near Phoenix, had had Parkinson\u2019s disease for more than 30 years. He was admitted to the hospital on Monday with what Mr. Gunnell said was a respiratory problem. Ali was the most thrilling if not the best heavyweight ever, carrying into the ring a physically lyrical, unorthodox boxing style that fused speed, agility and power more seamlessly than that of any fighter before him. But he was more than the sum of his athletic gifts. An agile mind, a buoyant personality, a brash   and an evolving set of personal convictions fostered a magnetism that the ring alone could not contain. He entertained as much with his mouth as with his fists, narrating his life with a patter of inventive doggerel. (\u201cMe! Wheeeeee! \u201d) Ali was as polarizing a superstar as the sports world has ever produced  \u2014   both admired and vilified in the 1960s and \u201970s for his religious, political and social stances. His refusal to be drafted during the Vietnam War, his rejection of racial integration at the height of the civil rights movement, his conversion from Christianity to Islam and the changing of his \u201cslave\u201d name, Cassius Clay, to one bestowed by the separatist black sect he joined, the   Nation of Islam, were perceived as serious threats by the conservative establishment and noble acts of defiance by the liberal opposition. Loved or hated, he remained for 50 years one of the most recognizable people on the planet. In later life Ali became something of a secular saint, a legend in soft focus. He was respected for having sacrificed more than three years of his boxing prime and untold millions of dollars for his antiwar principles after being banished from the ring he was extolled for his    gallantry in the face of incurable illness, and he was beloved for his accommodating sweetness in public. In 1996, he was trembling and nearly mute as he lit the Olympic caldron in Atlanta. That passive image was far removed from the exuberant, talkative, vainglorious    who bounded out of Louisville, Ky. and onto the world stage in 1964 with an upset victory over Sonny Liston to become the world champion. The press called him the Louisville Lip. He called himself the Greatest. Ali also proved to be a    \u2014   a public figure who kept reinventing his persona. As a bubbly teenage gold medalist at the 1960 Olympics in Rome, he parroted America\u2019s Cold War line, lecturing a Soviet reporter about the superiority of the United States. But he became a critic of his country and a government target in 1966 with his declaration \u201cI ain\u2019t got nothing against them Vietcong. \u201d \u201cHe lived a lot of lives for a lot of people,\u201d said the comedian and civil rights activist Dick Gregory. \u201cHe was able to tell white folks for us to go to hell. \u201d But Ali had his hypocrisies, or at least inconsistencies. How could he consider himself a \u201crace man\u201d yet mock the skin color, hair and features of other   most notably Joe Frazier, his rival and opponent in three classic matches? Ali called him \u201cthe gorilla,\u201d and long afterward Frazier continued to express hurt and bitterness. If there was a supertitle to Ali\u2019s operatic life, it was this: \u201cI don\u2019t have to be who you want me to be I\u2019m free to be who I want. \u201d He made that statement the morning after he won his first heavyweight title. It informed every aspect of his life, including the way he boxed. The traditionalist fight crowd was appalled by his style he kept his hands too low, the critics said, and instead of allowing punches to \u201cslip\u201d past his head by bobbing and weaving, he leaned back from them. Eventually his approach prevailed. Over 21 years, he won 56 fights and lost five. His Ali Shuffle may have been pure showboating, but the \u201c  \u201d  \u2014   in which he rested on the ring\u2019s ropes and let an opponent punch himself out  \u2014   was the stratagem that won the Rumble in the Jungle against George Foreman in 1974, the fight in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo) in which he regained his title. His personal life was paradoxical. Ali belonged to a sect that emphasized strong families, a subject on which he lectured, yet he had dalliances as casual as autograph sessions. A brief first marriage to Sonji Roi ended in divorce after she refused to dress and behave as a proper Nation wife. (She died in 2005.) While married to Belinda Boyd, his second wife, Ali traveled openly with Veronica Porche, whom he later married. That marriage, too, ended in divorce. Ali was politically and socially idiosyncratic as well. After the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the television interviewer David Frost asked him if he considered Al Qaeda and the Taliban evil. He replied that terrorism was wrong but that he had to \u201cdodge questions like that\u201d because \u201cI have people who love me. \u201d He said he had \u201cbusinesses around the country\u201d and an image to consider. As a spokesman for the Muhammad Ali Center, a museum dedicated to \u201crespect, hope and understanding,\u201d which opened in his hometown, Louisville, in 2005, he was known to interrupt a   meeting with an ethnic joke. In one he said: \u201cIf a black man, a Mexican and a Puerto Rican are sitting in the back of a car, who\u2019s driving? Give up? The  . \u201d But Ali had generated so much good will by then that there was little he could say or do that would change the public\u2019s perception of him. \u201cWe forgive Muhammad Ali his excesses,\u201d an Ali biographer, Dave Kindred, wrote, \u201cbecause we see in him the child in us, and if he is foolish or cruel, if he is arrogant, if he is outrageously in love with his reflection, we forgive him because we no more can condemn him than condemn a rainbow for dissolving into the dark. Rainbows are born of thunderstorms, and Muhammad Ali is both. \u201d Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. was born in Louisville on Jan. 17, 1942, into a family of strivers that included teachers, musicians and craftsmen. Some of them traced their ancestry to Henry Clay, the   representative, senator and secretary of state, and his cousin Cassius Marcellus Clay, a noted abolitionist. Ali\u2019s mother, Odessa, was a cook and a house cleaner, his father a sign painter and a church muralist who blamed discrimination for his failure to become a recognized artist. Violent and often drunk, Clay Sr. filled the heads of Cassius and his younger brother, Rudolph (later Rahman Ali) with the teachings of the   black separatist Marcus Garvey and a refrain that would become Ali\u2019s  \u2014   \u201cI am the greatest. \u201d Beyond his father\u2019s teachings, Ali traced his racial and political identity to the 1955 murder of Emmett Till, a black    from Chicago who was believed to have flirted with a white woman on a visit to Mississippi. Clay was about the same age as Till, and the photographs of the brutalized dead youth haunted him, he said. Cassius started to box at 12, after his new $60 red Schwinn bicycle was stolen off a downtown street. He reported the theft to Joe Martin, a police officer who ran a boxing gym. When Cassius boasted what he would do to the thief when he caught him, Martin suggested that he first learn how to punch properly. Cassius was quick, dedicated and gifted at publicizing a youth boxing show, \u201cTomorrow\u2019s Champions,\u201d on local television. He was soon its star. For all his ambition and willingness to work hard, education  \u2014   public and segregated  \u2014   eluded him. The only subjects in which he received satisfactory grades were art and gym, his high school reported years later. Already an amateur boxing champion, he graduated 376th in a class of 391. He was never taught to read properly years later he confided that he had never read a book, neither the ones on which he collaborated nor even the Quran, although he said he had reread certain passages dozens of times. He memorized his poems and speeches, laboriously printing them out over and over. In boxing he found boundaries, discipline and stable guidance. Martin, who was white, trained him for six years, although historical revisionism later gave more credit to Fred Stoner, a black trainer in the Smoketown neighborhood. It was Martin who persuaded Clay to \u201cgamble your life\u201d and go to Rome with the 1960 Olympic team despite his almost pathological fear of flying. Clay won the Olympic   title and came home a professional contender. In Rome, Clay was everything the sports diplomats could have hoped for  \u2014   a handsome, charismatic and black  . When a Russian reporter asked him about racial prejudice, Clay ordered him to \u201ctell your readers we got qualified people working on that, and I\u2019m not worried about the outcome. \u201d \u201cTo me, the U. S. A. is still the best country in the world, counting yours,\u201d he added. \u201cIt may be hard to get something to eat sometimes, but anyhow I ain\u2019t fighting alligators and living in a mud hut. \u201d Ali would later cringe at that quotation, especially when journalists harked back to it as proof that a merry   had been misguided into becoming a hateful militant. Of course, after the Rome Games, few journalists followed Clay home to Louisville, where he was publicly referred to as \u201cthe Olympic nigger\u201d and denied service at many downtown restaurants. After one such rejection, the story goes, he hurled his gold medal into the Ohio River. But Clay, and later Ali, gave different accounts of that act, and according to Thomas Hauser, author of the oral history \u201cMuhammad Ali: His Life and Times,\u201d Clay had simply lost the medal. Clay turned professional by signing a   contract with 11 local white millionaires. (\u201cThey got the complexions and connections to give me good directions,\u201d he said.) The   Louisville Sponsoring Group supported him while he was groomed by Angelo Dundee, a top trainer, in Miami. At a mosque there, Clay was introduced to the Nation of Islam, known to the news media as \u201cBlack Muslims. \u201d Elijah Muhammad, the group\u2019s leader, taught that white people were devils genetically created by an evil scientist. On Allah\u2019s chosen day of retribution, the Mother of Planes would bomb all but the righteous, and the righteous would be spirited away. Years later, after leaving the group and converting to orthodox Islam, Ali gave the Nation of Islam credit for offering   a    message at a time of low   and persecution. \u201cColor doesn\u2019t make a man a devil,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the heart and soul and mind that count. What\u2019s on the outside is only decoration. \u201d Clay enjoyed early success against prudently chosen opponents. His outrageous predictions, usually in rhyme  \u2014   \u201cThis is no jive, Cooper will go in five\u201d  \u2014   put off many older sportswriters, especially since most of the predictions came true. (His fight against the Englishman Henry Cooper did end in the fifth round at Wembley Stadium in 1963, although Cooper, who had knocked Clay down in the fourth, did not \u201cgo down. \u201d) The reporters\u2019 beau ideal of a boxer was the laconic Joe Louis. But they still wrote about Clay. Younger sportswriters, raised in an age of Andy Warhol, happenings and the \u201cput on,\u201d were delighted by the hype and by Clay\u2019s friendly accessibility. In 1963, at 21, after only 15 professional fights, he was on the cover of Time magazine. The winking quality of the prose  \u2014   \u201cCassius Clay is Hercules, struggling through the twelve labors. He is Jason, chasing the Golden Fleece\u201d  \u2014   reinforced the assumption that he was just another boxer being sacrificed to the box office\u2019s lust for fresh meat. It was feared he would be seriously injured by the baleful slugger Liston, a    betting favorite to retain his title in Miami Beach, Fla. on Feb. 25, 1964. But Clay was joyously comic. Encouraged by his assistant trainer and \u201cspiritual adviser,\u201d Drew Brown, known as Bundini, Clay mocked Liston as the \u201cbig ugly bear\u201d and chanted a battle cry: \u201cFloat like a butterfly, sting like a bee, rumble, young man, rumble. \u201d The Beatles, on their first American tour, were in town and showed up for a photo op at Clay\u2019s training gym. Malcolm X, a leading minister for the Nation of Islam and a worrisome presence to many white Americans, was there, too, with his family members as guests of Clay, whom they saw as a big brother. To the shock of the crowd, Clay, taller and broader than Liston at 6 feet 3 inches and 210 pounds and much faster, took immediate control of the fight. He danced away from Liston\u2019s vaunted left hook and peppered his face with jabs, opening a cut over his left eye. Clay was in trouble only once. Just before the start of the fifth round, his eyes began to sting. It was liniment, but he suspected poison. Dundee had to push him into the ring. Two rounds later, Liston, slumped on his stool, his left arm hanging uselessly, gave up. He had torn muscles swinging at Clay in vain. Clay, the new champion, capered along the ring apron, shouting at the press: \u201cEat your words! I shook up the world! I\u2019m king of the world!\u201d (More than a year later, in May 1965, he would retain his crown in   fashion in a rematch with Liston in Lewiston, Me. Within two minutes of the first round, Ali threw what became known as the phantom punch, sending Liston sprawling and resulting in a disputed decision to end the fight.) The morning after the Miami Beach fight, a calm Clay affirmed his rumored membership in the Nation of Islam. He would be Cassius X. (A few weeks later he became Muhammad Ali, which he said meant \u201cWorthy of all praise most high. \u201d) That day he harangued his audience with a preview of what would, over the next few years, become a series of longer and more detailed lectures about religion and race. This one was about, as he put it, \u201cstaying with your own kind. \u201d \u201cIn the jungle, lions are with lions and tigers with tigers,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go where I\u2019m not wanted. \u201d The only prominent leader to send Ali a telegram of congratulations was the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. \u201cI remember when Ali joined the Nation of Islam,\u201d Julian Bond, the civil rights activist and politician, once said. \u201cThe act of joining was not something many of us particularly liked. But the notion he\u2019d do it  \u2014   that he\u2019d jump out there, join this group that was so despised by mainstream America, and be proud of it  \u2014   sent a little thrill through you. \u201d The thrills gave way to darker thoughts. After Malcolm X left the Nation and was assassinated on Feb. 21, 1965, by members of the group, there was talk that Ali had been tacitly complicit. Jack Newfield, a political journalist with an interest in boxing, wrote, \u201cIf Ali, as the new heavyweight champion, had remained loyal to his mentor, and continued to lend his public support to Malcolm, history might have gone in a different direction. \u201d On Feb. 17, 1966, a day already roiled by the Senate\u2019s televised hearings on the war in Vietnam, Ali learned that he had been reclassified 1A by his Louisville selective service board. He had originally been disqualified by a substandard score on a mental aptitude test. But a subsequent lowering of criteria made him eligible to go to war. The timing, however, was suspicious to some the contract with the Louisville millionaires had run out, and Nation members were taking over as Ali\u2019s managers and promoters. \u201cWhy me?\u201d Ali said when reporters swarmed around his rented Miami cottage to ask about his new draft status. \u201cI buy a lot of bullets, at least three jet bombers a year, and pay the salary of 50, 000 fighting men with the money they take from me after my fights. \u201d But as the reporters continued to press him with questions about the war, the geography of Asia and his thoughts about killing Vietcong, he snapped, \u201cI ain\u2019t got nothing against them Vietcong. \u201d The remark was   news around the world. In America, the news media\u2019s response was mostly unfavorable, if not hostile. The sports columnist Red Smith of The New York Herald Tribune wrote, \u201cSquealing over the possibility that the military may call him up, Cassius makes himself as sorry a spectacle as those unwashed punks who picket and demonstrate against the war. \u201d Most of the press refused to refer to Ali by his new name. When two black contenders, Floyd Patterson and Ernie Terrell, insisted on calling him Cassius Clay, Ali taunted them in the ring as he delivered savage beatings. On April 28, 1967, Ali refused to be drafted and requested   status. He was immediately stripped of his title by boxing commissions around the country. Several months later he was convicted of draft evasion, a verdict he appealed. He did not fight again until he was almost 29, losing three and a half years of his athletic prime. They were years of personal and intellectual growth, however, as Ali supported himself on the college lecture circuit, offering medleys of Muslim dogma and boxing verse. In the    sessions that followed, Ali was forced to explain his religion, his Vietnam stand and his opposition (unpopular on most campuses) to marijuana and interracial dating. Now the \u201conliest boxer in history that people asked questions like a senator\u201d developed coherent answers. During his exile from the ring, Ali starred in a   Broadway musical, \u201cBuck White,\u201d one of several commercial ventures. There was a   chain called Champburger and a mock movie fight with the popular former champion Rocky Marciano in which Ali outboxed the slugger until being knocked out himself in the final round. The broadcaster Howard Cosell, one of Ali\u2019s most steadfast supporters in the news media, was responsible for keeping him on television, both as an interview subject and as a commentator on boxing matches. As Ali\u2019s   case made its way to the United States Supreme Court, he returned to the ring on Oct. 26, 1970, through the efforts of black politicians in Atlanta. The fight, which ended with a quick knockout of the white contender Jerry Quarry, was only a tuneup for Ali\u2019s anticipated showdown with Frazier, the new champion. But it was a night of glamour and history as Coretta Scott King, Bill Cosby, Diana Ross, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Sidney Poitier turned out to honor Ali. The Rev. Ralph Abernathy presented him with the annual Dr. King award, calling him \u201cthe March on Washington all in two fists. \u201d \u201cThe Fight,\u201d as the Madison Square Garden bout with Frazier on March 8, 1971, was billed, lived up to expectations as an epic match. With Norman Mailer ringside taking notes for a book and Frank Sinatra shooting pictures for Life magazine, Ali stood toe to toe with Frazier and slugged it out as if determined to prove that he had \u201cheart,\u201d that he could stand up to punishment. Frazier won a   decision. Both men suffered noticeable physical damage. To Ali\u2019s boosters, the money he had lost standing up for his principles and the beating he had taken from Frazier proved his sincerity. To his critics, the bloody redemption meant he had finally grown up. The Supreme Court also took a positive view. On June 28, 1971, it unanimously reversed a lower court decision and granted Ali his   status. It was assumed now that Ali\u2019s time had passed and that he would become a   \u201copponent,\u201d the fighter to beat for those establishing themselves. But his time had returned. Although he was slower, his artistry was even more refined. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have fights,\u201d wrote Jim Murray of The Los Angeles Times, \u201che gave recitals. \u201d He won 13 of his next 14 fights, including a rematch with Frazier, who had lost his title to George Foreman, a bigger, more frightening version of Liston. Ali was the underdog, smaller and seven years older than Foreman, when they met on Oct. 30, 1974, in Zaire, then ruled by Mobutu Sese Seko. Each fighter was guaranteed $5 million, an extraordinary sum at the time. The fight also launched the career of the promoter Don King and was the subject of Leon Gast\u2019s documentary \u201cWhen We Were Kings,\u201d which was released more than 20 years later. (Ali attended a special screening, along with   performances, at Radio City Music Hall.) The film won a 1997 Academy Award. Ali reveled in the African setting, repeating an aphorism he had heard from Brown, his assistant trainer: \u201cThe world is a black shirt with a few white buttons. \u201d As the fight progressed, the crowd chanted, \u201cAli, bomaye!\u201d (\u201cAli, kill him! \u201d) first out of concern as Ali leaned against the ropes and absorbed Foreman\u2019s sledgehammer blows on his arms and shoulders, and then in mounting excitement as Foreman wore himself out. In the eighth round, in a blur of punches, Ali knocked out Foreman to regain the title. He leaned down to reporters and said, \u201cWhat did I tell you?\u201d On Dec. 10, 1974, Ali was invited to the White House for the first time, by President Gerald R. Ford, an occasion that signified not only a turning point in the country\u2019s embrace of Ali but also a return of the Lip. Ali told the president, \u201cYou made a big mistake letting me come because now I\u2019m going after your job. \u201d Ali successfully defended his title 10 times over the next three years, at increasing physical cost. He knocked out Frazier in their third match, the   Thrilla in Manila in 1975, but the punishment of their 14 rounds, Ali said, felt close to dying. In 1978 he lost and then regained his title in fights with Leon Spinks. Ali\u2019s longtime ring doctor, Ferdie Pacheco, urged him to quit, noting the slowing of his reflexes and the slurring of his speech as symptoms of damage. Ali refused. In 1980, he was battered in a loss to the champion Larry Holmes. A year later, he fought for the last time, losing to the journeyman Trevor Berbick in the Bahamas. Ali was soon told that he had Parkinson\u2019s syndrome. Several doctors have speculated that it was brought on by too many punches to the head. The diagnosis was later changed to Parkinson\u2019s disease, according to his wife, Lonnie. She said it had been brought on by Ali\u2019s exposure to pesticides and other toxic chemicals at his training camp in Deer Lake, Pa. After retiring from the ring, Ali made speeches emphasizing spirituality, peace and tolerance, and undertook   missions to Africa and Iraq. Even as he lost mobility and speech, he traveled often from his home in Berrien Springs, Mich. Product and corporate endorsements brought him closer to the \u201cshow me the money\u201d sensibilities of Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods, the heirs to his global celebrity. In 1999, Ali became the first boxer on a Wheaties box. On Dec. 31 that year, he rang out the millennium at the New York Stock Exchange. In 2003, a $7, 500 art book celebrating his life was published. His life was the subject of a television movie and a feature film directed by Michael Mann, with Will Smith as Ali. (Both productions sanitized his early religious and political viewpoints.) The same licensing firm that owned most of Elvis Presley\u2019s image purchased rights to Ali\u2019s. Thomas Hauser, his biographer, decried the new \u201ccommercialism\u201d surrounding Ali and \u201cthe rounding off the rough edges of his journey. \u201d In a book of essays published in 2005, \u201cThe Lost Legacy of Muhammad Ali,\u201d Hauser wrote, \u201cWe should cherish the memory of Ali as a warrior and as a gleaming symbol of defiance against an unjust social order when he was young. \u201d In 2005, calling him the greatest boxer of all time, President George W. Bush presented the Medal of Freedom to Ali in a White House ceremony. In recent years, Parkinson\u2019s disease and spinal stenosis, which required surgery, limited Ali\u2019s mobility and ability to communicate. He spent most of his time at his home in Paradise Valley, Ariz. often watching Western movies and old    TV shows. He ventured out mostly for physical therapy, movies and concerts. He rarely did TV interviews, his wife said, because he no longer liked the way he looked on camera. \u201cBut he loved the adoration of crowds,\u201d she said. \u201cEven though he became vulnerable in ways he couldn\u2019t control, he never lost his childlike innocence, his sunny, positive nature. Jokes and pranks and magic tricks. He wanted to entertain people, to make them happy. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561801.058266}
