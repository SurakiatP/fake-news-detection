As a United States Senator she was in Washington D.C. at her home in Whitehaven when the first plane hit the World Trade Center. She spent most of the day reacting to the attacks in media interviews and joined her colleagues singing \u201cGod Bless America\u201d on the Capitol Hill steps. Clinton flew to New York on September 12, after making a speech on the Senate Floor in the morning. She traveled with her fellow New York Senator Chuck Schumer and Democratic Congressman Charlie Rangel. Clinton toured the disaster site with New York mayor Rudy Giuliani before leaving the city that evening to travel back to Capitol Hill. \\nAnother day, another lie from Crooked Hillary.
