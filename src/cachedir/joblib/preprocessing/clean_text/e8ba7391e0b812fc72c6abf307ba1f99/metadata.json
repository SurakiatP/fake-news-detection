Because we didn\u2019t tell the voters we were going to repeal Obamacare, but keep some of the Obamacare taxes. We didn\u2019t tell the voters we\u2019re going to repeal Obamacare, but keep and extend Medicaid expansion. And we certainly didn\u2019t tell the voters we\u2019re going to repeal Obamacare, but start a new entitlement. \u201d  Jordan said, \u201c[L]et\u2019s do this right, and, more importantly, let\u2019s do what we told the voters we\u2019re going to do. That\u2019s why today I\u2019ll be introducing legislation which just says clean repeal. Let\u2019s vote on the exact same thing, 15 months ago, every single Republican in the House, every single Republican in the Senate voted on. We put it on President Obama\u2019s desk. Of course, he vetoed it. But let\u2019s put that same legislation on President Trump\u2019s desk, and then work on the replacement model that will actually bring down the cost of insurance. I don\u2019t think the plan they introduced yesterday is going to bring down the cost for working class and middle class families. \u201d He stated of the current replacement, \u201cEvery conservative group out there is opposed to this legislation, because, as I said yesterday and others have said, I think it\u2019s Obamacare in a different form. Because we didn\u2019t tell the voters we were going to repeal Obamacare, but keep some of the Obamacare taxes. We didn\u2019t tell the voters we\u2019re going to repeal Obamacare, but keep and extend Medicaid expansion. And we certainly didn\u2019t tell the voters we\u2019re going to repeal Obamacare, but start a new entitlement. \u201d He further said that he doesn\u2019t think the current replacement \u201ccould pass today.   \u2026     So, this needs to be changed in a dramatic way for it to have a chance to pass, in my judgment. \u201d Jordan continued his criticism of the current replacement, arguing, \u201c[T]his is what Americans hate. We campaign on one thing, and then we get here and say, oh, we can\u2019t do what we campaigned on. We really can\u2019t do a clean repeal, and then replace it with something that\u2019s going to bring down the costs. We\u2019ve got to mush it all together and do some different form of Obamacare. That\u2019s what the American voters hate. Let\u2019s do what we told them we were going to do. Let\u2019s do what they sent us here to do and what they expect us to do. \u201d Jordan also stated, \u201cEven if you don\u2019t have the CBO score, look at the four corners of the document and read what it says. I think it\u2019s not going to bring down the cost of premiums for working class and middle class families. That\u2019s why I oppose it. I think it\u2019s Obamacare, as I\u2019ve said, Obamacare in a different form. That\u2019s why I oppose it. But it would also be nice to have a score. I can\u2019t believe the score won\u2019t be high because, when you\u2019re extending and expanding the Medicaid expansion, when you\u2019re starting this new entitlement called advanceable refundable tax credits, when you\u2019re doing all that, I\u2019ve got to believe that\u2019s a cost to the federal government. But apart from that, just look at what it does, it keeps the federal government in control of how this thing works, the exchange and that sort of thing. That\u2019s the wrong approach because we\u2019ve seen how bad Obamacare has been for the American people the last six years. \u201d Jordan added his replacement plan \u201cwould put in place policies that will bring back affordable insurance. That\u2019s the big problem right now. If people can afford the premiums, they can\u2019t afford the deductibles. Fewer choices, higher costs is what Obamacare has given us. We want those policies, like expanded health savings accounts, interstate shopping, easier formation of association health plans, tax deductibility on the individual market side so that you begin to equalize treatment for folks who get their insurance in the individual market with those who get   plan insurance. So, that\u2019s what we want to do. Those kinds of things will bring down the cost. And most importantly, you get out all the regulations which drove up the cost of insurance. Never forget what Obamacare did. It set mandates, taxes, and regulations, drove up the cost of insurance, told every American, you have to buy it, and if you don\u2019t, there\u2019s a penalty. That\u2019s what we have to get away from. \u201d Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742562754.0058534}
