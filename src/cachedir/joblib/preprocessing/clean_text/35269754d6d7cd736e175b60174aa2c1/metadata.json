It was a    rebuke to the protests calling for limits on what kinds of speech should be condoned on campus, and who should be allowed to speak, that have rocked Yale, Wesleyan, Oberlin and many other colleges and universities in recent years. Some alumni, dismayed by the trend, have withheld donations from their alma maters. The Chicago letter echoed policies that were already in place there and at a number of other universities calling for \u201cthe freedom to espouse and explore a wide range of ideas. \u201d But its stark wording, coming from one of the nation\u2019s leading universities, and in a routine correspondence that usually contains nothing more contentious than a dining hall schedule, felt to people on all sides like a statement. Kevin Gannon, a history professor at Grand View University in Des Moines, dismissed the letter on his website as \u201ca manifesto looking for an audience,\u201d one that \u201crelies on caricature and bogeymen rather than reason and nuance. \u201d The Heritage Foundation wrote on Facebook that the letter \u201cwill make you stand up and cheer. \u201d Other universities have made similar statements, but the message from Chicago is \u201cclearer and more direct than I\u2019ve seen,\u201d said Greg Lukianoff, president of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a leading critic of what it says are destructive speech restrictions at many campuses. \u201cSending a letter to freshmen is different than I\u2019ve seen, at least in a long time, and certainly from a major university. \u201d Michael S. Roth, president of Wesleyan University, said the Chicago letter was, at least in part, a publicity stunt  \u2014   \u201cGosh, is there any doubt?\u201d he asked  \u2014   and a way of \u201cnot coddling students, but coddling donors. \u201d Jeremy Manier, a University of Chicago spokesman, insisted there were no hidden motives behind the letter. And he said professors remained free, at their discretion, to use trigger warnings, the messages sometimes posted atop campus publications, assignments and other material, noting that they might be upsetting for people who have had traumatic experiences. Conservatives have been the loudest critics of campus political correctness, and hailed the Chicago statement as a victory. Mary Katharine Ham, a senior writer for The Federalist, a conservative website, wrote that it was \u201ca sad commentary on higher education that this is considered a brave and bold move, but it is, and the University of Chicago should be applauded mightily for stating what used to be obvious. \u201d But while conservatives often frame campus free speech as a    issue, the dispute is often within the left. \u201cHistorically, the left has been much more protective of academic freedom than the right, particularly in the university context,\u201d said Geoffrey R. Stone, a University of Chicago law professor who specializes in free speech issues. Conservatives \u201csuddenly became the champions of free speech, which I find is a bit ironic, but the left is divided. \u201d Mr. Lukianoff said he and his group are often mistakenly called conservative, adding, \u201cI\u2019m a former A. C. L. U. person who worked in refugee camps. \u201d The dispute over free speech has ricocheted off campuses and around the country. In a commencement speech this year at Howard University, President Obama said: \u201cDon\u2019t try to shut folks out, don\u2019t try to shut them down, no matter how much you might disagree with them. There\u2019s been a trend around the country of trying to get colleges to disinvite speakers with a different point of view, or disrupt a politician\u2019s rally. Don\u2019t do that  \u2014   no matter how ridiculous or offensive you might find the things that come out of their mouths. \u201d The University of Chicago has long been associated with the conservative school of economics that is named for it. It also takes pride in a history of free expression, like allowing the Communist Party candidate for president, William Z. Foster, to speak on the ornate   campus on the city\u2019s South Side in 1932, despite fierce criticism. Mr. Obama taught constitutional law at the university law school. The university said Friday that Dean Ellision and the university president, Robert R. Zimmer, were not available to discuss the letter or what prompted it, but Mr. Manier referred queries to Professor Stone, a former university provost. Last year, a faculty Committee on Freedom of Expression, appointed by Dr. Zimmer and headed by Professor Stone,  produced a report stating that \u201cit is not the proper role of the university to attempt to shield individuals from ideas and opinions they find unwelcome, disagreeable, or even deeply offensive. \u201d \u201cWe didn\u2019t feel we were doing something, internal to the University of Chicago, that was in any way radical or different,\u201d Professor Stone said Friday. It is clear that some colleges are retreating from the same free speech values, he said, \u201cbut my guess, if you asked most of these institutions 10 or 20 years ago, they would have said more or less what we said in our statement. \u201d Since Professor Stone\u2019s committee produced its report, several other universities, including Princeton, Purdue, Columbia and the University of Wisconsin system, have adopted similar policies or statements, some of them taken almost verbatim from the report. And this week\u2019s letter to University of Chicago freshmen draws from that and specifically cites the report as embodying the university\u2019s point of view. Many academics say the concerns reflected in the University of Chicago letter, while real, are overblown. \u201cI asked faculty if any had ever been asked to give trigger warnings,\u201d said Dr. Roth, of Wesleyan. \u201cI think one person said they had. \u201d There often seems to be a generational divide on campus speech  \u2014   young people demanding greater sensitivity, and their elders telling them to get thicker skins  \u2014   but a survey by the Knight Foundation and Gallup gives a murkier picture. It found that 78 percent of college students said they preferred a campus \u201cwhere students are exposed to all types of speech and viewpoints,\u201d including offensive and biased speech, over a campus where such speech is prohibited. Students were actually more likely to give that response than adults generally. But when asked specifically about \u201cslurs and other language on campus that is intentionally offensive to certain groups,\u201d 69 percent of college students said that colleges should be allowed to impose restrictions on such expression. Eric Holmberg, the student body president at the University of Chicago, said the letter suggested that administrators \u201cdon\u2019t understand what a trigger warning is,\u201d and seemed \u201cbased on this false narrative of coddled millennials. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s an effort to frame any sort of activism on campus as    just young people who are upset,\u201d Mr. Holmberg said, \u201cwhen in reality I\u2019d say the administration is far more fearful of challenge than any student I know. \u201d Sara Zubi, a Chicago junior majoring in public policy, said the dean\u2019s letter seemed contrary to some of the support programs the university has created or endorsed, like a \u201csafe space program\u201d for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students. \u201cTo say the university doesn\u2019t support that is really hypocritical and contradictory,\u201d she said, \u201cand it also just doesn\u2019t make sense. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564234.028905}
