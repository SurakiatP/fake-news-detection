S.,\u201d said Nedal Tamer to Pelosi during Tuesday\u2019s town hall hosted on CNN. \u201cCountries like Syria. I am Lebanese American Muslim. There are countries that harbor radical Islamic groups, and [teach] teenagers to hate anyone who is not Muslim. \u201d  That\u2019s all it takes for some to \u201ccome as a refugee and create a problem here,\u201d Tamer continued. \u201cHow can you guarantee the safety for all Americans  \u2026     If we let these refugees to come [in]?\u201d Every refugee or \u201cnewcomer\u201d who arrives in the U. S. with \u201chopes, dreams, aspirations\u201d makes \u201cAmerica more American,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cThe reason I oppose this specific thing that President Trump did was the following: Refugees have the most stringent vetting of all newcomers to our country. The most stringent vetting,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so, when he cuts off Syria, largely those are refugees coming, the most stringent vetting. We take an oath to support the American people and the Constitution of the United States. It\u2019s our responsibility. So we\u2019re not casual about our reasons to, our need to protect the American people. \u201d \u201cBut we have to be strong, and we have to be smart. We don\u2019t have to be reckless and rash,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t have to discriminate against people because of their religion. And so, that\u2019s why I oppose what he\u2019s done with the seven countries. He has no case, in my view, with the refugees. \u201d While thanking Tamer for his question, Pelosi also revealed she believed that billions of foreigners around the world have a \u201cright\u201d to emigrate to America, a common leftist talking point. She said she had visited Lebanon and hoped \u201cthe way things go, I hope people can enjoy staying home and enjoying their lives there, as well as exercising the right to come to America. \u201d Trump\u2019s executive order \u201chas not made us more safe,\u201d Pelosi told Tamer. Tamer has been profiled by the media before: He\u2019s a   Lebanese Muslim immigrant living with his wife and children in heavily Muslim Dearborn, Michigan, where he works in real estate. Last April, The New York Post quoted his praise of Trump and his proposals to control immigration: \u201cI like the fact that he\u2019s a little nuts. He\u2019s got the good heart, he cares about America. \u201d In another interview last May, Tamer strongly opposed further Islamic immigration into the U. S.: \u201cWe don\u2019t want these groups to come in here, or anyone with these refugee groups to come in here, and create any problem here,\u201d he said to Al Arabiya English. \u201cWe\u2019re going to pay the price, and that\u2019s why the Muslim community and the Arab community have got to understand, every time we step forwards, we take 10 steps back because of these problems. \u201d \u201cIf you love this country, then you support this man. I will say this to any Arabic Muslim: if you love this country then you support this man,\u201d Tamer added.'"}, "time": 1742563788.8682785}
