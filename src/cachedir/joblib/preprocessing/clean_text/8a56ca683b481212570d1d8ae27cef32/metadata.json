S. murders. [The study shows that \u201c54% of counties (with 11% of the population) have no murders\u201d while \u201c69% of counties have no more than one murder. \u201d Taken together these counties, which represent about 31% of the U. S. population, \u201caccount for only 4% of all murders in the country. \u201d  However, CPRC shows that two percent of U. S. counties \u2014  led by Los Angeles County \u2014  account for 51% of all murders. And \u201cthe worst 5% of counties contain 47% of the population and account for 68% of murders. \u201d This is crucial information because gun controllers continuously point to polls claiming a vast majority of Americans support one type of gun control or another, and those same gun controllers point to homicide rates to bolster their push for new laws. One thing the gun controllers do not explain is where the the poll respondents live \u2014  for example, are they all concentrated in the two percent of counties where 51% of U. S. murders occur? And secondly, when listing homicide rates, gun controllers do not point out that murder is a local problem rather than a national one.

S. counties which had zero murders during any given year from 1977 to 2000.

They point to a 2015 report in the Hartford Courant, wherein \u201cYale Ph. D. candidate Michael   explained that Yale University sociologists determined \u201970 percent of all shootings in Chicago can be located in a social network composed of less than 6 percent of the city\u2019s population. \u2019\u201d Think about it \u2014  70 percent of Chicago\u2019s bloodshed and mayhem occurs in an area representing \u201cless than 6 percent of the city\u2019s population. \u201d Gun controllers would say this means more gun control is needed for the other 94% of the population, but such thinking is  .
