Share on Facebook \\nGerman Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen is in panic mode. Her fear is that Trump may actually call out NATO\u2019s uselessness\u2026and that would mean Germany, and other NATO freeloaders, may actually have pay for their own security. \\nThat is why, when von der Leyen warns Trump to not even think about rapprochement with Russia, she is signaling her fear that such a rapprochement would mean the end of her and her war hungry cronies. \\nWhen von der Leyen tells Trump that NATO stood by the US after the 9/11 attacks, and that NATO \u201cisn\u2019t just a business,\u201d she is trying to kiss Trump\u2019s ass, and admitting that NATO is in fact a \u201cbusiness.\u201d \\nAnd of course no NATO grand standing would be complete without the exhausted and fictional argument that NATO is actually useful in countering Moscow on Syria and Ukraine. \\nRT reports \u2026 \\nAppearing on the ZDF Thursday show \u2018Maybrit Illner\u2019, German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen emotionally argued that the US president-elect needs to understand NATO is more about values than business-like behavior. \\nShe also went on to address some unfounded speculation circulating in Western capitals, namely that Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are in a \u2018bromance\u2019 \u2013 a kind of relationship between the two leaders that would benefit bilateral ties between Moscow and Washington. \\nTherefore, the Defense Minister continued, the issues of the Ukrainian conflict and the ongoing anti-terrorist efforts in the Syrian city of Aleppo are not to be taken off the table during discussions with Moscow. \\nHere are some of von der Leyen remarks to Trump with regard to NATO\u2026 \\n\u201cWhat his advisers will hopefully tell him and what he needs to learn is that NATO isn\u2019t just a business. It\u2019s not a company.\u201d \\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how he values NATO.\u201d \\n\u201cYou can\u2019t say \u2018the past doesn\u2019t matter, the values we share don\u2019t matter\u2019 but instead try to get as much money out of [NATO] as possible and whether I can have a nice deal out of it,\u201d \\n\u201cDonald Trump has to say clearly on which side he is. Whether he is on the side of the law, peaceful order and democracy or whether he does not care about this and is looking instead for a best buddy.\u201d \\nFor his part, Trump has been lukewarm on the whole NATO charade\u2026and rightly so. RT reminds us of what Trump has said about NATO \u2026 \\nDuring his election campaign, Donald Trump repeatedly voiced skepticism towards the bloc, calling it \u201cobsolete\u201d in the era of fighting terrorism worldwide. \\n\u201cMaybe NATO will dissolve and that\u2019s OK, not the worst thing in the world,\u201d he said earlier. \\nTrump, however, earlier dismissed claims he favors Putin both personally and as a political leader, saying on NBC in September: \\n\u201cI don\u2019t know him, I know nothing about him really. I just think if we got along with Russia that\u2019s not a bad thing.\u201d \\nTrump has also suggested that the US should not engage too much in defending European allies. \\n\u201cHey, NATO allies,\u201d Trump wrote in a Facebook post in July, \u201cIf we are not reimbursed for the tremendous cost of protecting you, I will tell you \u2013 congratulations, you will be defending yourself.\u201d '"}, "time": 1742563910.6413054}
