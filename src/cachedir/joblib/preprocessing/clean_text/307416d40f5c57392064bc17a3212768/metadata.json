As confetti showered South Carolina\u2019s first women\u2019s basketball title winners, she put on a championship cap she had waited a career to wear. Later, she wore a net like a necklace. The   win over Mississippi State, a fellow member of the Southeastern Conference, was a victory that represented a diversity of opportunity, both for coaches and for teams playing for a championship. Staley became the second   coach to win a title since the N. C. A. A. began sponsoring a women\u2019s basketball tournament in 1982. (Carolyn Peck coached Purdue to the 1999 championship.) And for the first time in five years, a program not named Connecticut won a national title. After Peck won her championship, she gave Staley a piece of the net that Purdue cut down in celebration that night, telling her to return it when she won her own title. For years, Staley kept the strand of net in her wallet. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to pass a piece of my net on to somebody else, so they can share it and hopefully accomplish something as big as this,\u201d Staley said. Staley was a fierce point guard from Philadelphia and one of the most renowned players in the history of women\u2019s basketball as a collegian, professional and Olympian. She became a coach only reluctantly. But now, as an N. C. A. A. champion and the recently named Olympic coach for the 2020 Tokyo Games, Staley has a chance to become a   for women\u2019s basketball as Geno Auriemma of UConn and Tara VanDerveer of Stanford move closer to retirement. \u201cBasketball is an incredible gift that keeps on giving,\u201d Staley, 46, said Sunday. Earlier, at the Final Four, she said, \u201cI\u2019m one that thinks basketball is a place of utopia and fairness. \u201d For the third time this season, the Gamecocks beat the Bulldogs. Mississippi State ( ) appeared to be somewhat tired, or anxious, after Friday night\u2019s epic overtime upset of UConn. South Carolina attacked from the opening tip, then sputtered after building a   lead in the third quarter. But the Gamecocks were settled by their    post player A\u2019ja Wilson (23 points, 10 rebounds) and guard Allisha Gray (18 points, 10 rebounds).   of South Carolina\u2019s points were scored in the lane. Three times, Staley had reached the Final Four as a player at Virginia. And this was her second appearance in the past three seasons as South Carolina\u2019s coach. She had not won until Sunday, but a championship that had remained elusive finally became inexorable. \u201cShe was the best leader I ever coached,\u201d said Nell Fortner, who led Staley and the United States to an Olympic gold medal at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. \u201cIt isn\u2019t overbearing, just a natural aura she has about her. Players follow her. \u201d Yet opportunities for minority women to become head coaches at the top levels of women\u2019s college basketball have been rare. Excluding historically black colleges and universities, among 320 Division I women\u2019s teams, only 35 (10. 9 percent) have   women as head coaches, while 45 percent of the players are black, according to a report to be released this week by the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport at the University of Central Florida. (Nineteen   men also coach women\u2019s teams.) After John Thompson became the first black men\u2019s coach to win an N. C. A. A. basketball title at Georgetown in 1984, \u201cmore athletic directors were open to putting an   in charge,\u201d said Richard Lapchick, the director of the diversity institute. \u201cHopefully, that will be the case here\u201d after Staley\u2019s triumph, Lapchick added. Staley said: \u201cI don\u2019t know what athletic directors will think about. I\u2019m not one that looks at race. Basketball has been faceless and colorless and genderless when I approached it. I think athletic directors need to hire what\u2019s best for them. \u201d She added: \u201cIf it\u2019s an   male or female, then that\u2019s who they should hire. If it\u2019s somebody else who they feel can take their program to the next level, it has to be the best fit for them, and not necessarily  . \u201d The daughter of parents who moved from South Carolina, Staley grew up in public housing in Philadelphia. She played baseball, football and basketball with her three brothers and other boys and sometimes shot baskets until 2 a. m. She developed a robustness that allowed her to win three Olympic gold medals as a player and be named one of the top 15 players in the formative years of the W. N. B. A. \u201cShe\u2019s basically a gym rat, and definitely ball is life for her,\u201d said Gray, the guard. With Sunday\u2019s title, Staley joined Pat Summitt of Tennessee, Kim Mulkey of Baylor and Marianne Stanley of Old Dominion as former star women\u2019s college players who went into coaching and won N. C. A. A. championships. \u201cI have always respected Dawn\u2019s competitiveness, her work ethic, her absolute passion for the game of basketball,\u201d said VanDerveer, who coached Staley to a gold medal at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. \u201cBut if she tells you she beat me in chess, she\u2019s a liar. \u201d While still playing in the W. N. B. A. Staley was somehow persuaded in 2000 by Dave O\u2019Brien, then Temple University\u2019s athletic director, to coach the university\u2019s women\u2019s basketball team. Perhaps more out of hometown devotion than enthusiasm, Staley agreed, though she has said, \u201cNot one ounce of me wanted to coach. \u201d In eight seasons at Temple, Staley guided the Owls to six appearances in the N. C. A. A. tournament. But she grew weary of a sobering realization: She could not recruit the caliber of players needed to get Temple beyond the second round of the tournament. \u201cAt tournament time, we always got \u201d Staley said. \u201cWe outplayed people, but they   us. \u201d In 2008, she left for South Carolina, a team that was underachieving but seemed to have great possibility, with the financial resources available to a school in a major football conference. Staley expected the same kind of dedication that she played with, and some of her players transferred early on. But the Gamecocks soon grew into a national power and, as of Sunday, into a national champion. Referring to her fellow semifinalists Auriemma (11 N. C. A. A. titles) and VanDerveer (two) Staley said, \u201cI want to be among greatness. \u201d With Sunday\u2019s championship, she moved into rarefied company. \u201cIt means I can check off one of the things that has been a void in my career,\u201d she said.'"}, "time": 1742564247.3775067}
