So it\u2019s nice to just open a pack and boom; there\u2019s a smoke waiting for you. Open it again, there\u2019s another! And another and another! It\u2019s just the most magical experience in the world\u201d. \\nMuldoon also states that real cigarettes seem healthier, and are basically good for you if you smoke enough of them.'"}, "time": 1742563552.3134189}
