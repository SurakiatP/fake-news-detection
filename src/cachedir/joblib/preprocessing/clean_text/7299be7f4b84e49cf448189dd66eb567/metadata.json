And has that person been drawn and quartered?\" https://t.co/jXc1mHi5vn \u2014 Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) October 27, 2016 The Backstory: \\nClinton surrogate Neera Tanden was going on CNN with Jake Tapper in July of 2015, where she was told she\\'d be shown a new poll comparing Hillary Clinton to Bernie Sanders and others, including Jeb Bush. While she didn\\'t know the results of said poll, she told John Podesta (via email) that she expected it to be rough. \\nPodesta fired back: \\n\u201cPS can you imagine what the Republicans would do to [Bernie] if he were the nominee?\u201d \\nTo which Tanden replied: \\n\"Well, let\\'s see what the poll actually says. \\nLet\\'s hope the Democratic party is not suicidal.\" \\nThen Tanden dropped the hammer: \\n\"Do we actually know who told Hillary she could use a private email? And \\nhas that person been drawn and quartered? \\nLike whole thing is fucking insane.\" \\nWikiLeaks has thus far released 33,000 Podesta emails. While the Clinton campaign has yet to confirm their accuracy, they have also not challenged their authenticity. It\\'s been 3 weeks since @WikiLeaks began publishing Podesta emails. Not one doc has been claimed - let alone demonstrated - to be doctored. \u2014 Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) October 27, 2016 \\nExpect even more to come out over the next two weeks, but keep this in mind: Way back in 2015, the people at the top of the Clinton campaign were at war over the decision to let her use personal emails. \\nWill that continue if \u2014 or when \u2014 she returns to the White House?
