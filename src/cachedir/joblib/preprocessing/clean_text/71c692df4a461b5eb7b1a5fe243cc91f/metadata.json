They are delivered from Commander\u2019s Palace, her family\u2019s restaurant next door to her mansion in this city\u2019s historic Garden District. Drinks are often followed by dinner, also from Commander\u2019s, and wine. Ms. Brennan favors Champagne and distinguished whites from the C\u00f4te de Beaune because, as she puts it, \u201cI\u2019m too damn old to drink cheap wine\u201d and \u201cbecause I can. \u201d In New Orleans, there is little question that Miss Ella, as Ms. Brennan is widely known here, has earned her sense of entitlement. Her hometown\u2019s civic pride is tightly linked to its reputation for culinary excellence Ms. Brennan helped create that reputation, and has made maintaining it a personal responsibility for more than 60 years. At 91, she is the matriarch of an extended family of restaurateurs that employs nearly 1, 400 people, both full and part time, and she has mentored countless talents, including the celebrity chefs Paul Prudhomme and Emeril Lagasse. \u201cShe was there to embrace and elevate, not just me but the entire staff,\u201d said Mr. Lagasse, whom Ms. Brennan plucked from obscurity and installed, at age 23, as Commander\u2019s chef in the early 1980s. \u201cThe list of people she has impacted in the hospitality industry in America is endless. \u201d Ms. Brennan\u2019s family has recently set out to ensure that her legacy is appreciated beyond New Orleans. Those efforts culminated last year with the release of a memoir, \u201cMiss Ella of Commander\u2019s Palace,\u201d written with Ti Martin, her daughter. It was followed by the documentary \u201cElla Brennan: Commanding the Table,\u201d directed by Leslie Iwerks. The film, which has been screening at festivals, will be available on Netflix in May. The book and film tell the story of a     businesswoman  \u2014   her other nickname is Hurricane Ella  \u2014   who excelled in a   profession decades before gender imbalance in the restaurant industry became a hot issue. \u201cWhen I first started, you would hardly ever see another woman in the kitchen, much less running the show,\u201d said Sue Zemanick, the former chef at Gautreau\u2019s, a \u201cTop Chef Masters\u201d contestant and a line cook at Commander\u2019s early in her career. \u201cWorking at a restaurant with such strong women in charge gave me hope that I could make it. \u201d While Ms. Brennan is, as Ms. Martin put it, \u201cas retired as Mom is capable of being,\u201d her New Orleans restaurants, which include Caf\u00e9 Adelaide and SoBou, remain an obsession for her they are managed by Ms. Martin and Lally Brennan, a niece of Ms. Brennan. On a recent afternoon, Ms. Brennan sat next to the unlit fireplace in her living room. As she moved a sore leg back and forth between an ottoman and the floor, she suggested that her impulse to empower employees was a rejection of restaurant industry norms she confronted as a young woman. \u201cIn those days, no one was paying attention to developing people,\u201d she said. \u201cA restaurateur has to be part of a team to make something everyone can be proud of. \u201d Her decision to tap Mr. Prudhomme, a Cajun, to run Commander\u2019s kitchen in the 1970s loosened the grip that   chefs had on American fine dining. Alongside Ms. Brennan, and later on his own, the   Mr. Prudhomme helped set the table for a renaissance in American regional cooking that has yet to abate. \u201cNew Orleans was really the centerpiece of the whole American food movement,\u201d the New York restaurateur Drew Nieporent said. \u201cAnd Ella put New Orleans on the map. \u201d Ms. Brennan entered the hospitality business as a teenager working at the Old Absinthe House, a Bourbon Street bar owned by her brother Owen, 15 years her senior. She had dropped out of a local business school after deciding, as she wrote in her book, that \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to type for any man. \u201d In 1946, Mr. Brennan bought Vieux Carr\u00e9, a French Quarter restaurant that Ms. Brennan described recently, with typical candor, as \u201cterrible. \u201d Mr. Brennan hired her to manage the business, looking to prove that an Irish family could operate a restaurant superior to established   restaurants like Arnaud\u2019s, Antoine\u2019s and Galatoire\u2019s. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anything,\u201d Ms. Brennan recalled. \u201cBut Owen was a raconteur. He slept till noon. He got me to do all of the things he didn\u2019t like. So I learned. \u201d A voracious reader, she pored over books recommended by the restaurant\u2019s two chefs, Jack Eames and Paul Blang\u00e9, whose respect she sought and whom she frequently praised. \u201cI was amazed at their talent,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were like surgeons. \u201d The gregarious Brennan family  \u2014   the other siblings were Dick, Adelaide, Dottie and John  \u2014   cultivated a clientele of influential locals and visitors, including celebrities. All the while, Ms. Brennan worked with the chefs to elevate Vieux Carr\u00e9\u2019s food. For inspiration, she traveled frequently to New York City, where she became a regular at the \u201c21\u201d Club. Culinary pioneers like James Beard and Helen McCully, the food editor of McCall\u2019s magazine, took the young visitor under their wings. \u201cYou had to go to New York in those days,\u201d Ms. Brennan said. \u201cI was trying to get New Orleans to that level. \u201d In 1955, the Brennans were preparing to relocate Vieux Carr\u00e9 to a larger space on Royal Street when Owen died of a heart attack at 45. It fell to Ms. Brennan to carry out her brother\u2019s vision for the new restaurant, which would be called Brennan\u2019s. By all accounts, Brennan\u2019s ushered in a new age for fine dining in the South. It became a grand showcase for New Orleans joie de vivre, replete with a wine cellar, antiques and food that stretched the boundaries of traditional   cuisine. The national press took notice, especially of its boozy, multicourse breakfasts. \u201cAmerica was coming to appreciate dining as entertainment,\u201d Ms. Brennan wrote, \u201cand all of the newspapers were just beginning to have columns about food. \u201d Ms. Brennan helped develop new dishes, including bananas Foster. She pushed to expand the family\u2019s restaurant properties, with spotty success, aggravating a rift between Owen\u2019s heirs and what came to be known as \u201cElla\u2019s side\u201d of the family. In 1973, Ms. Brennan was dismissed from Brennan\u2019s, initiating a bitter, litigious family split that has never fully healed. \u201cIt was a tragedy,\u201d Ms. Brennan said. \u201cFamily is everything to us. \u201d (Owen Brennan\u2019s sons continued to run Brennan\u2019s until 2013, when a group that includes Ralph Brennan, a son of John Brennan, purchased the   property at a sheriff\u2019s auction. Brennan\u2019s of Houston, overseen by Ms. Brennan\u2019s son Alex, is part of her restaurant group.) Commander\u2019s Palace, which Ms. Brennan acquired in 1969, was a sprawling property in need of repair. In partnership with her sisters and brothers, she set about turning it into a restaurant that would eclipse Brennan\u2019s. Early reviews weren\u2019t favorable. But over time, Commander\u2019s became renowned for its sophisticated blending of south Louisiana and nouvelle cuisines  \u2014   Ms. Brennan christened the style haute Creole  \u2014   and its warm, celebratory approach to fine dining. \u201cWe want people who eat here to feel important, and we want them to have fun,\u201d Ms. Brennan said. Ms. Brennan never presumed that her management responsibilities ended at the kitchen door. Alex McCrery, a Commander\u2019s line cook in the early 2000s, recalled that Ms. Brennan admonished another cook for proposing that the kitchen make mustard ice cream. \u201cShe was the type who was like your mom is when she is disappointed in you,\u201d Mr. McCrery said. \u201cShe was stern, and you\u2019d feel like you really messed up. \u201d Ms. Brennan said she \u201cgave up men for Lent\u201d after her divorce in 1970 from Paul Martin. She also never learned to cook (\u201cI don\u2019t think she can boil water,\u201d Mr. Lagasse said) but that doesn\u2019t prevent her from giving lavish dinner parties in the home she shares with Dottie. \u201cWe don\u2019t carry on like we once did,\u201d she said before a recent meal. \u201cBut I do like to take advantage of living next door to my restaurant. \u201d A waiter carried Ms. Brennan\u2019s drink as she moved, with the aid of a walker, from her   parlor to her   dining room. She sat at the head of the table as Commander\u2019s waiters delivered a series of courses from the restaurant\u2019s kitchen. As she sank her spoon into a steaming sea urchin and stone crab souffl\u00e9, Ms. Brennan explained that entertaining gives her an opportunity to weigh in on new ideas from Tory McPhail, Commander\u2019s current and   chef. It also allows her to partake in the kind of pleasure she has provided others for so long. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing here tonight is letting him experiment on us,\u201d she said, referring to Mr. McPhail, who had just introduced a course of lamb osso buco. Ms. Brennan was as engaged and vivacious as when the evening began. As Mr. McPhail turned to leave, she called after him, \u201cBring back a bottle of Champagne, will you?\u201d Recipe: Bananas Foster'"}, "time": 1742561631.212894}
