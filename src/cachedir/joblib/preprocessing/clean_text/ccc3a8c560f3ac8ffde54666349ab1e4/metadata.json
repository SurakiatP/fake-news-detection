When the average cow is given growth hormones, antibiotics, GMO feed, vaccinations and exposed to toxic conditions, it is no wonder that many humans experience negative effects from consuming pasteurized cow milk . Goat\u2019s milk is a much healthier alternative, especially when it is raw and organic. Goats produce about 2% of the global milk supply and it is interesting that most of the populations of people who consume goat milks cite a lower incidence of allergies and digestive complaints. The Benefits of Goat Milk Goat\u2019s milk offers a wide variety of health benefits, with very few of the negative side effects of drinking regular cow milk. 1. Reaction to Inflammation Some research suggests that one of the main benefits of goat milk is that it may benefit inflammation. Another reason why it is easier for people with bowel inflammation to drink goat\u2019s milk, instead of cow\u2019s milk. 2. Environmentally Friendly Goats requires far less space and food than cows. Typically, you can comfortably raise six goats on the same acreage as two cows. 3. Metabolic agent Studies done at the USDA and Prairie View A&M University, link goat\u2019s milk to an increased ability to metabolize iron and copper, especially amongst individuals with digestion and absorption limitations. Besides drinking goat\u2019s milk, you can also take a digestive enzymes supplement to help with this also. 4. Bio-availability Another main health benefit of goat milk, is that it is closer to human mother\u2019s milk than cow\u2019s milk is. Because it has a chemical make up that is much closer to human milk, it is easier to digest and assimilate in the human body. 5. \u201cSmaller\u201d Fat \u201cSmaller\u201d fat? Does that mean it has less fat? Not necessarily, it means that the size of the fat molecules in goat\u2019s milk are much smaller than those found in cow\u2019s milk. This makes goat\u2019s milk easier to digest. 6. High in Fatty Acids While cow\u2019s milk has about seventeen percent fatty acids, goat\u2019s milk averages thirty five percent fatty acids, making it more nutritionally wholesome. In fact, up to 50% of people with lactose intolerance to cow\u2019s milk find that they can easily digest goat\u2019s milk, especially if it is raw. 7. Calcium-rich Many people worry that they need to drink cow\u2019s milk for calcium intake and the prevention of bone loss. Goat\u2019s milk also offers high amounts of calcium, the amino acid tryptophan, and much less side effects of drinking cow\u2019s milk. It\u2019s just one of the many foods high in calcium . 8. Anti-Mucousal While drinking cow\u2019s milk is a common reason for allergies and excess mucous, goat\u2019s milk is not. Cow\u2019s milk is high in fat, which may increase mucous build-up. Moreover, the fat globules in goat\u2019s milk are one ninth the size of those found in cow\u2019s milk, another possible reason why it does not produce irritation in the gut. 9. Ultra-nourishing In Naturopathic medicine, goat\u2019s are referred to as bioorganic sodium animals. They are also associated with vigour, flexibility and vitality. Cows are calcium animals known for stability and heaviness. Bioorganic sodium is an important element in keeping joints mobile and limber. Goat milk has traditionally been used in medicinal cultures to nourish and regenerate an over-taxed nervous system. Goat\u2019s milk is also extremely nutrient dense. It has almost 35% of your daily needs for calcium in one cup. Extremely high in riboflavin, just one cup of goat\u2019s milk offers 20.0% of our daily needs. Add to that high amounts of phosphorous, Vitamin B12, protein and potassium. In fact, Ghandi himself rejuvenated his own health after extremely long periods of fasting through drinking raw goat\u2019s milk [ 1 ] . 10. Less toxic than Cow\u2019s Milk Whereas most cow\u2019s milk is pumped full of bovine growth hormones as well as a substance known as bovine somatotropin, a hormone specific for increasing milk production in an unnatural way, goat\u2019s are rarely treated with these substances. Because of its use on the fringes of big agriculture, goat\u2019s milk is not only more nutritious for you, but also less toxic. 11. May Boost Immune System Goat\u2019s milk has the trace mineral, selenium, a key essential mineral in keeping the immune system strong and functioning normally. Why You Should Drink Goat Milk Over Cow\u2019s Milk These are just a few of the many health benefits of goat milk. Not only does it contain more nutrients your body craves, but it also has less additives than cow\u2019s milk. Go with the healthier choice. References: Time Magazine.
