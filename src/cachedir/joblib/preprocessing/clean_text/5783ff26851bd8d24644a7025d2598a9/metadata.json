Senator from the heart of coal country in West Virginia, told Breitbart News exclusively that he was shocked and disappointed in White House National Economic Council director Gary Cohn\u2019s   comments in Europe this week. [Manchin said in the exclusive interview that he hopes that Cohn will allow him to \u201ceducate\u201d him more on his uninformed   standpoint, and that he looks forward to a deeper conversation with the official from President Donald Trump\u2019s White House.  \u201cYeah, Gary, I don\u2019t know what the hell happened with Gary. Jesus Christ, what\u2019s wrong with these people?\u201d Manchin joked when asked for a response to Cohn\u2019s comments this week that coal \u201cdoesn\u2019t make much sense anymore. \u201d Cohn\u2019s comments run counter to President Trump\u2019s position on the issue, too, since Trump said the \u201cwar on coal is over\u201d with him as president. Cohn is a former Goldman Sachs banking executive. Manchin told Breitbart News: I\u2019d tell Gary to check out the world consumption of coal, and tell India and tell China and tell all these different countries that are sometimes getting electrified for the first time \u2014  the first time in a developed nation or developing nation. That\u2019s how the Obama administration was, and I guess it looks like I\u2019m going to have to go and try and work on Gary and give a little history lesson. It\u2019s a base load fuel. It\u2019s simple. We can depend on it  . If we would just develop technology, we\u2019ve got the ability to develop technology that makes using it much, much cleaner. The numbers are there. About 8 billion tons of coal is burned per year in the world. The United States of America burns less than one billion tons of coal a year, so we\u2019re less than one eighth of the world\u2019s consumption. That tells you seven eighths of all the coal in the world is being burnt somewhere else. Four billion tons is being burned in just China alone. They\u2019re all talking about how they\u2019re doing all these wonderful things, but day in and day out they\u2019re using coal because they know it\u2019s uninterruptible, it\u2019s laying right there, and you can use it. But here\u2019s the thing, we can\u2019t even get our allied countries \u2014  let\u2019s say Poland, which relies 90 percent or more on coal. Europe, a lot of Europe relies on coal. They need to do what we\u2019ve already done which is scrubbers, low NOx boilers, mercury baghouses. They\u2019re not even using those. Coal is much needed and it\u2019s going to continue to be. Ask Gary how he thinks they make steel, where does the cooking come from? I\u2019m going to give him a history lesson. Hopefully they\u2019ll let me come over and talk to him. Manchin added that Cohn\u2019s comments were \u201cabsolutely not\u201d helpful for President Trump in any way, shape, or form in coal country, and that his   comments \u201cgives them doubt\u201d in coal mines across West Virginia. Manchin also said that while Cohn\u2019s comments were problematic, it is also true that President Trump has by and large been a major booster for the coal industry outside of this particular comment. He went on to say: Let me just say: What President Trump has been able to help us with, in coal country and in areas where we\u2019ve been doing the heavy lifting all of these years, is help us stabilize by getting rid of these onerous regulations that were just piled on \u2014  piled on. We\u2019re always going to have the Clean Water and the Clean Air Act, everybody is for that, but these regulations from EPA weren\u2019t doing anything except piling on and making it so unbearable that nobody could afford coal. So, he stabilized us \u2014  okay? Bringing the market back, the market is what the market is, we understand that too. So people thinking a lot of the coal jobs, we do have them now moving coal in West Virginia, world markets and U. S. markets \u2014  we\u2019ll continue to do that \u2014  but it makes it very difficult now and I just talked to people who were asking \u2018what happened? I thought the Trump people, they were all for us.\u2019 I said, \u2018well, that\u2019s one person within President Trump\u2019s team who\u2019s from New York who we\u2019re going to have to educate a little bit better.\u2019 When asked if Cohn, in his view, would be open to such a meeting, Manchin simply replied: \u201cI think he will be. \u201d The White House has not answered whether Cohn would be open to such a meeting with Manchin. But a White House official did tell Breitbart News after publication of this article that President Trump has been great on coal. Manchin also praised President Trump on coal. \u201cFrom rolling back the burdensome regulations that were strangling our domestic energy production to securing healthcare benefits for miners in the latest government funding bill, President Trump always has the best interests of America\u2019s coal workers at the top of his mind,\u201d the White House official told Breitbart News in an email. In his interview, though, Manchin explained exactly how he would go about teaching the uninformed Cohn about the energy, specifically coal, industry. \u201cWell first of all you have to have base load \u2014  base load is   uninterrupted,\u201d Manchin said when asked how such a lesson would go. He continued: You only have two things which are base load, two products \u2014  that\u2019s coal and nuclear. When you have the coal, you have 60 days to 90 days of coal power boiling \u2014  it\u2019s uninterruptible. You follow me? You boil it and you make electricity. No matter what the weather is, no matter what. And if you have the nuclear rods and nuclear fuel, you\u2019re able to keep nuclear plants going nonstop. Gas will become and it\u2019s pretty much been relied on now as a base load fuel. But think about this: Gas has to be delivered by a gas line. Gas is not right on site. When you build a plant, you\u2019re not going to have gas underground right there to run that plant forever. So you have to bring gas. That can be interruptible. You can have lines break, you can have lines freeze up, you can have a lot of things happen and you can also have \u2014  it\u2019s an easy target for terrorists. He added that Cohn needs to understand this idea of base load energy sources like coal. Manchin said: Coal, that\u2019s what we call base load. And Gary is going to have to understand, we have to have so much base load here. So just give me a chance to explain the role coal has played in the United States and how we built our country, how we won every war, how we made our own steel because we had our own coal to make it. We didn\u2019t rely on any foreign country for the energy we use to defend ourselves. Manchin said in the interview that, outside of these Cohn comments, President Trump has been better for coal in his first few months in office than the entire previous eight years of former President Barack Obama. The comment from a Democratic U. S. Senator praising Trump \u2014  a Republican \u2014  as better already than Obama on one of his core issues is remarkable, in that Trump is winning at least some bipartisan praise despite opposition from many Democrats on a number of other issues. The Senator went on to say: I\u2019ve said this, I think we have had a better relationship in three or four or five months and had more conversations on how we can find a balance and move forward and help us with the Trump administration and the president himself than in the last eight years. He has given us some stability. I don\u2019t want dirty water and dirty air. I haven\u2019t met a West Virginian who wants to breathe dirty air or drink dirty water. And there\u2019s a balance between the economy and the environment. We\u2019ve never had the hardcore right or hardcore left trying to find that balance. That\u2019s my problem. They just think they don\u2019t like people mining it, they don\u2019t like the job of mining coal and if you don\u2019t mine it that means you don\u2019t use it and hey that means you don\u2019t need to mine it. So, we were running upstream all the time saying \u2018hey guys, we wouldn\u2019t be here if we hadn\u2019t done the heavy lifting.\u2019 So hopefully I\u2019ll be able to explain that to Gary Cohn and he\u2019ll know the role that coal has played and the role that coal needs to play. If you take the 30 percent of energy that coal provides, you take 30 percent out, you\u2019ve got serious problems \u2014  you\u2019re going to have rolling brownouts and blackouts. So that\u2019s what I hope to explain to him. Manchin also said that despite Cohn\u2019s   comments, he thinks Trump still stands with coal workers nationwide: I really believe in all my heart that the president still believes in an     energy policy that includes coal \u2014  and that we don\u2019t turn our noses to any others they\u2019re trying to develop. We\u2019re always using research and technology to find better ways to use energy that we have and who knows maybe when your children\u2019s or grandchildren\u2019s lifetime it will maybe happen. Commercial hydrogen \u2014  I mean, water \u2014  those things. I\u2019m all for technology and using the best we have but I\u2019m not for a      and telling the world \u2018sure that did feel good and I hope you all do the same as well.\u2019 Manchin noted that countries like China and India and others are not going to give up competitive advantages against the United States \u2014  and that he thinks President Trump should use his \u201cnegotiating skills\u201d to scrap the Paris climate deal and start over. He said: They\u2019re not. Their main thing is provide the energy and if they can get a competitive advantage, they\u2019ll take it. That\u2019s where I think these agreements we\u2019re talking about if it says \u2018okay, not only are we going to let you catch up, but we\u2019re going to give you a   head start on us and we\u2019re going to lose part of our [industry],\u2019 I\u2019m not going to do that. I thought it was wrong. So I think, Mr. President: Use your negotiating skills, use your understanding of the marketplace and make it competitive and strike the balance between economy and environment. And use the strength of our trading dollar, our trading market, to make sure that the countries that want access to our markets are at least using the technology we\u2019ve already perfects. Make the Polish, make India, make China use the scrubbers, use the low NOx boilers, use the baghouses for mercury. And then work together to develop the technology for CO2. It can be done. Specifically, on the Paris climate accord, Manchin told Breitbart News that the president should renegotiate it so it does not disadvantage the United States. Manchin said, when asked where he stands on the Paris deal: First of all, I\u2019m saying this: The technology has to be proven, commercial technology before you\u2019re telling us to meet certain things. If the president wants to sit down and I believe they would renegotiate it \u2014  he\u2019s good at negotiations \u2014  then renegotiate it because it is not good for the United States of America and puts us at a disadvantage and gives everyone else much more of an advantage in getting our markets and taking our market share. That\u2019s not who we are. Now, I know we have to lead the way and we have led the way if we can just get them to use what we\u2019ve already perfected. In China and in India, it\u2019s not CO2 killing people. It\u2019s particulates. It\u2019s SO2. We\u2019ve removed about all of the SO2 out of the market in America. We\u2019ve cleaned up the environment more in 20 years than has ever been done in history. So I would say, \u2018Mr. President, sit down and renegotiate and tell them you\u2019re not going to put the United States at an unfair disadvantage\u2019 which is what the Paris Accord did the way it was written. Manchin added that the key thing in climate agreements that a president needs to ensure is that the United States has no disadvantage as a result. \u201cI think in all those agreements on the climate the thing is we shouldn\u2019t put the United States of America at a disadvantage,\u201d Manchin said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done a lot. If we can get carbon capture and use the waste from carbon when you solidify it as a fuel \u2014  there\u2019s so much more, hopefully, with carbon capture sequestration. President Obama said \u2018if you want to build a power plant, go ahead and build it, we\u2019ll break you.\u2019 He knew it wasn\u2019t economically or commercially feasible to do that, unless you had enhanced oil recovery where you could take the carbon you sequestered put it in the ground and push up more oil to pay for it, it made no sense. So if you weren\u2019t in an area where you had oil, and you could recover more oil, then it didn\u2019t make sense. It made it very difficult. The thing on any of these agreements, giving China or India a leap forward, or giving any of these others a leap home, let\u2019s all move and use the technology that we can develop together to make sure that the whole world is on a competitive cycle, not making the United States way up or putting onerous conditions on the United States or giving other countries 20 or 30 years to get to the same level where we are. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628485.689539}
