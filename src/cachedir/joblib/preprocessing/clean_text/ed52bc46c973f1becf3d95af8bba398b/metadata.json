Trump thrust himself into one of the world\u2019s most polarizing debates on Thursday by pressuring President Obama to veto a United Nations resolution critical of Israel, the newly elected leader\u2019s most direct intervention in foreign policy during his transition to power. Mr. Trump spoke out after Israeli officials contacted his team for help in blocking the draft resolution condemning settlement construction even as they lobbied its sponsor, Egypt. Within a couple of hours, Egypt withdrew the resolution, at least temporarily, and its president, Abdel Fattah   called Mr. Trump to discuss how \u201cto establish true peace in the Middle East,\u201d according to an aide to the  . Mr. Trump\u2019s forceful intervention was a rare effort by a new president to shape international events even before taking office. While new presidents typically refrain from weighing in on current issues during the interregnum between their election and inauguration, Mr. Trump\u2019s statement underscored that he does not plan to wait for the swearing in. He has already upended decades of American policy by speaking directly with Taiwan\u2019s leader, and he has spoken out regularly on events like this week\u2019s terrorist attack in Germany. But his push to stop a United Nations resolution criticizing Israel was more directly aimed at decisions still being made by his predecessor in his final days in office. The move also highlighted the stark shift on Middle East policy ahead when the new administration takes over in a month. Combined with his pledge to move the United States Embassy to Jerusalem and his selection of a   ambassador to Israel, Mr. Trump\u2019s involvement Thursday signaled an intent to play an active role in Middle East peace issues as a strong ally of Israel\u2019s. The   resolution would have condemned Israeli housing construction in East Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank as a \u201cflagrant violation under international law\u201d that was \u201cdangerously imperiling the viability\u201d of a future peace settlement establishing a Palestinian state. The United States has routinely used its veto at the Security Council to block similar measures, including under Mr. Obama in 2011. But Mr. Obama refused to commit to doing so again this time. Mr. Trump said flatly that he should. \u201cAs the United States has long maintained, peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians will only come through direct negotiations between the parties and not through the imposition of terms by the United Nations,\u201d the   said. \u201cThis puts Israel in a very poor negotiating position and is extremely unfair to all Israelis. \u201d Mr. Trump amplified his position by posting the statement on Facebook and Twitter as well, but a transition official insisted on anonymity to confirm the  \u2019s conversation with Mr. Sisi because of the sensitivity of the matter. Mr. Trump\u2019s words echoed the positions expressed by Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has welcomed Mr. Trump\u2019s election as a breath of fresh air after years of clashes with Mr. Obama. According to Security Council Report, an independent research organization, the United States has vetoed 30 resolutions regarding Israel and the Palestinians, plus a dozen more regarding Israel and Lebanon or Syria, more than half of its 77 vetoes since the United Nations was founded in 1946. Mr. Netanyahu cited that history on Thursday. \u201cI hope the U. S. won\u2019t abandon this policy,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope it will abide by the principles set by President Obama himself in his speech in the U. N. in 2011  \u2014   that peace will come not through U. N. resolutions, but only through direct negotiations between the parties. \u201d Frustrated by two failed efforts to broker peace between Israelis and Palestinians during his tenure, Mr. Obama has been considering an effort to lay out an American framework during his final days in office. Palestinian leaders and their allies had hoped he would allow the   resolution at the United Nations to pass as an expression of frustration at Israeli policies. A Palestinian delegation traveled to Washington this month to urge Mr. Obama\u2019s team to support the   resolution or at least abstain. Mr. Obama\u2019s advisers did not disclose a position and were holding out until the vote to watch how the matter developed. The Palestinians were unable to meet with Mr. Trump\u2019s aides and expressed disappointment on Thursday with his position. \u201cA veto means support of settlement activities,\u201d Saeb Erekat, the Palestinian negotiator, said after the resolution was pulled. \u201cA veto means abandoning the   solution and peace efforts. \u201d Asked about Mr. Trump\u2019s comments, a visibly upset Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, Riyad Mansour, said, \u201cHe is acting on behalf of Netanyahu. \u201d The return of the Palestinian cause to the world stage could serve the interests of some Arab leaders eager to turn public attention away from troubles at home. The government of Mr. Sisi, which sponsored the resolution as the Arab representative on the Security Council, faces domestic challenges stemming from a deteriorating economy, a persistent Islamic terrorist insurgency and this month\u2019s bombing of a Coptic Christian cathedral. At the same time, it could distract from Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s efforts to forge stronger relations with Sunni Arab nations on the basis of shared antipathy toward Iran, dominated by a Shiite theocracy that has threatened Israel\u2019s existence and challenged Arab interests in the region. Arab leaders, who have largely overlooked the Palestinian issue in recent years, may feel pressured to distance themselves from Israel again if their own publics are angered at the treatment of Palestinians. Egypt backed off on the resolution after Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s government put pressure on Mr. Sisi\u2019s government to withdraw it, shortly before Arab ambassadors meeting at the United Nations endorsed it. Mr. Netanyahu treated the pending United Nations vote as a crisis, staying up late into the night discussing it with aides and posting on his own Twitter account, at 3:28 a. m. local time, a message urging Mr. Obama to veto what he called the \u201c \u201d resolution. \u201cThe Israelis leaned on the Egyptians this morning to postpone the vote, and the Egyptians basically caved,\u201d said a Western official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the diplomatic sensitivity of the matter. Arab officials met in Cairo on Thursday night to consider their next move. \u201cThe negotiations over the Arab proposal for the Israeli settlements on occupied Palestinian territories are still not finished at both the United Nations and the Arab League\u2019s   committee,\u201d said Ahmed Abu Zeid, a spokesman for the Egyptian Foreign Ministry, according to Egyptian state news. If the White House had let the resolution pass, it would have been a symbolic blow to the diplomatic shield that the United States has always offered Israel. It would also have sent a strong signal of international disapproval over the construction of settlements, regarded by many as illegal under international law. A former top Obama adviser suggested that the president should consider supporting the resolution because settlements are an obstacle to peace and therefore the real damage to Israel. \u201cThe resolution is about settlements, not negotiations,\u201d Martin Indyk, a former special envoy under Mr. Obama, wrote on Twitter. \u201cVetoing would mean vetoing US policy on settlements. \u201d But Aaron David Miller, another former Middle East peace negotiator, said supporting the resolution would have plunged the administration into an issue that the past several administrations had avoided: the legality of the settlements. \u201cThe problem with voting for this,\u201d Mr. Miller said, \u201cis that Trump will disavow it and U. S. credibility on the issue will again be undermined, not to mention what the Israelis might do on the ground in response, to which the new administration may acquiesce. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561863.5088744}
