Well, the three terrorists who attacked London Bridge over the weekend found the Black and Blue Steakhouse, and they found the toughest man in the house. [Or, maybe more to the point, he found them.  Roy Larner, 47, is a huge fan of the South East London soccer team Millwall F. C. The team is known as the Lions, and when   terrorists entered the Black and Blue to kill innocent people, Larner let them know who is the true king of the jungle. After the terrorists entered, with obvious bad intentions, Larner sprang into action: \u201cLike an idiot I shouted back at them. I thought, \u2018I need to take the p*** out of these b*****s.\u2019 \u201cI took a few steps towards them and said, \u2018F*** you, I\u2019m Millwall.\u2019 So they started attacking me. \u201cI stood in front of them trying to fight them off. Everyone else ran to the back. I was on my own against all three of them, that\u2019s why I got hurt so much. It was just me, trying to grab them with my bare hands and hold on. I was swinging. \u201cI got stabbed and sliced eight times. They got me in my head, chest and both hands. There was blood everywhere. \u201cThey were saying, \u2018Islam, Islam!\u2019 I said again, \u2018F*** you, I\u2019m Millwall!\u2019 \u201cIt was the worst thing I could have done as they carried on attacking me. \u201cLuckily, none of the blows were straight at me or I\u2019d be dead. \u201d A petition has begun, with the aim of awarding Larner with the George Cross for bravery. The award is the second highest commendation granted by Great Britain. Looking at his scars, it\u2019s really hard to imagine that he won\u2019t get it. If Millwall is looking for a new slogan, they may have found it. \u201cF*** you, I\u2019m Millwall!\u201d has a nice ring to it.
