His FBI sources told Baier, \u201cwith 99 percent\u201d certitude, that Clinton\u2019s Chappaqua server \u201chad been hacked by at least five foreign intelligence services\u2026\u201d \\nIf this is so, Hillary Clinton as security risk ranks right up there with Alger Hiss and Harry Dexter White, though they acted out of treasonous ideology and she out of Clintonian hubris. What do these foreign intelligence agencies know about Clinton that the voters do not? \\nThe second revelation from Baier is that the Clinton Foundation has been under active investigation by the white-collar crime division of the FBI for a year and is a \u201cvery high priority.\u201d \\nSpecifically, the FBI is looking into published allegations of \u201cpay-to-play.\u201d This is the charge that the Clinton State Department traded access, influence and policy decisions to foreign regimes and to big donors who gave hundreds of millions to the Clinton Foundation, along with 15 years of six-figure speaking fees for Bill and Hillary. \\nAccording to Baier\u2019s sources, FBI agents are \u201cactively and aggressively\u201d pursuing this case, have interviewed and re-interviewed multiple persons, and are now being inundated in an \u201cavalanche of new information\u201d from WikiLeaks documents and new emails. \\nThe FBI told Baier that they anticipate indictments. \\nIndeed, with the sums involved, and the intimate ties between high officials of Bill\u2019s foundation, and Hillary and her close aides at State, it strains credulity to believe that deals were not discussed and cut. \\nBooks have been written alleging and detailing them. \\nAlso, not only Fox News but also The Wall Street Journal and other news sources are reporting on what appears a rebellion inside the FBI against strictures on their investigations imposed by higher ups in the Department of Justice of Attorney General Loretta Lynch. \\nDirector Comey has come under fire from left and right \u2014 first for refusing to recommend the prosecution of Clinton, then for last week\u2019s statement about the discovery of new and \u201cpertinent\u201d emails on the Abedin-Weiner computer \u2014 but retains a reputation for integrity. \\nAnd he knows better than any other high official the answer to a critical question that needs answering before Tuesday: Has Baier been fed exaggerated or false information by FBI agents hostile to Clinton? \\nOr has Baier been told the truth? \\nIn the latter case, we are facing a constitutional crisis if Clinton is elected. And the American people surely have a right to know that before they go to the polls on Tuesday. \\nWhat is predictable ahead? \\nAttorney General Lynch, whether she stays or goes, will be hauled before Congress to explain whether she or top aides impeded the FBI investigations of the Clinton scandals. And witnesses from within her Justice department and FBI will also be called to testify. \\nMoreover, Senate Republicans would block confirmation of any new attorney general who did not first promise to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the email and pay-to-play scandals, and any pressure from Lynch\u2019s Justice Department on the FBI. \\nEven Democrats would concede that a Department of Justice, staffed by Hillary Clinton appointees, could not credibly be entrusted with investigating alleged high crimes and misdemeanors by former Secretary of State Clinton and confidants like Abedin and Mills. \\nAn independent counsel, a special prosecutor, appears inevitable. \\nAnd such individuals usually mark their success or failure by how many and how high are the indictments and convictions they rack up. \\nHowever, these processes proceed at a torpid pace. \\nFirst comes the setting up of the office and the hirings, then the investigations, then the grand jury appearances, then the indictments, then the prosecutions, then the horse-trading for the testimony of the accused and the convicted in return for immunity or leniency. \\nSteadily, it moves up the food chain. And when a head of state is involved, it is a process deeply debilitating to the nation. \\nWe have gone through this before, twice. \\nDo we really want to go through it again? \\nPatrick J.
