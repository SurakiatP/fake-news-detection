Amnesty says the US must come clean about the civilian toll of its fight against Islamic State.\\nAmnesty suspects that US Central Command (CENTCOM), which directs coalition airstrikes in Syria, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153may have\u00e2\u20ac\u015a carried out unlawful attacks\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d in Syria , failing to take necessary measures to prevent civilian killings.\\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We fear the US-led coalition is significantly underestimating the harm caused to civilians in its operations in Syria,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Lynn Maalouf, Deputy Director for Research at Amnesty International\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Beirut regional office.\\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high time the US authorities came clean about the full extent of the civilian damage caused by coalition attacks in Syria. Independent and impartial investigations must be carried out into any potential violations of international humanitarian law and the findings should be made public.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\\nAmnesty investigated evidence, including eyewitness accounts, reports by human rights organizations and the media, photographs and video footage as well as satellite imagery, related to 11 suspected coalition attacks in Syria. The group estimates that the attacks have claimed as many as 300 civilian lives. So far none of these deaths has been acknowledged by CENTCOM.\\nThe report published on Wednesday added that the total civilian death toll from coalition action \u00e2\u20ac\u0153could be as high as 600 or more than 1,000\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d since the operation against Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS, ISIL) started in Syria in 2014.\\nOne of the strikes investigated by Amnesty took place in the early hours of December 7, 2015. The attacks hit two houses in the village of Ayn al-Khan, near al-Hawl in al-Hasakah governorate in northern Syria, killing 40 civilians, including 19 children, and injuring at least 30 others, the report said.\\nAccording to an eyewitness account, an initial night strike was followed by a second attack from a helicopter gunship, which hit first responders trying to dig out survivors.\\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153At this point I had a two-month-old baby boy in my arms whom I had rescued. The hit caused me to fall and drop him\u00e2\u20ac\u015a I fell into the hole made by the air strike. That was what saved me\u00e2\u20ac\u015a My mother, aunt, wife and children \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a daughter who was four years old and a son who was two and a half were all killed. The woman and her son who I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d rescued were killed. Everyone but me was killed,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d the survivor said.\\nThe strike is believed to have targeted IS fighters. But local Kurdish militia reportedly warned the coalition that there were civilians in the area.\\nAmnesty said CENTCOM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure to acknowledge civilian deaths in Syria, as well as the poor record of investigating such incidents in Afghanistan and Iraq, poses grave concerns over the toll which the civilian population of Mosul, Iraq is likely to face from the ongoing operation to take the city from IS. The US-led coalition is providing air support for the offensive.\\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Given the likely increase in air strikes by the US-led Coalition as part of the Iraqi offensive to recapture Mosul, it is even more pressing that CENTCOM be fully transparent about the impact of their military actions on civilians. And it is crucial that they adhere scrupulously to international humanitarian law, including by taking all feasible precautions to spare civilians and to minimize harm to civilian homes and infrastructure,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d said Maalouf.\\nA similar operation to capture Manbij, Syria, which is far smaller than Mosul, killed more than 200 civilians, Amnesty estimated.\\nMeanwhile, US State Department spokesman John Kirby said that the US \u00e2\u20ac\u0153takes seriously all credible allegations of civilian casualties.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Pentagon has a fairly comprehensive system for analyzing themselves what these allegations are and then, when they feel that they want further investigation, they do it. And unlike any other military in the world, they actually release the results of these investigations. And unlike any other military in the world, if the hold people accountable for their actions they [bring them to justice] too,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Kirby said during the press briefing on Wednesday.\\nAt the same time, he said that the Department of State is not aware of the Amnesty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report about the US Central Command (CENTCOM) strikes in Syria and suggested contacting the Pentagon for that matter. He also welcomed the Amnesty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153input\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d and stressed that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no military tries harder than the US military to limit, to prevent casualties to civilians or damage to civilian infrastructure.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are not at all afraid to receive criticism about our efforts,\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d Kirby added.\\nThe 300 fatalities are those that Amnesty considers credible, but the number is likely around 900, the report\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s author, Neil Sammonds, told RT. He said that while there were some indications that the Pentagon would try to improve the targeting of its strikes in Syria, so far this hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happened.\\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Until now the big picture in Syria is that they are not investigating thoroughly enough, they are not aware as they should be of the amount of civilians they have killed, and it means that it is quite possible that they will be killing more civilians in their campaign to retake Mosul from Islamic State.\u00e2\u20ac\\x9d\\nHe added that Amnesty was focusing on other parties in the Syrian conflict, including the Syrian government, Russia, terrorist groups and armed rebels, who, he said, are responsible for more civilian deaths than the US-led coalition, which explains why the report didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come sooner.\\nLast week, Amnesty International blasted Russia for civilian deaths in Aleppo. The Syrian city is divided between government forces and various armed groups, including the Al-Qaeda offshoot Al-Nusra Front. Russia says that the militants use civilians as human shields and would not allow them to leave the city, derailing several attempts by Russia to open humanitarian corridors out of the city.\\nSource \\n'"}, "time": 1742561683.8867974}
