Normally, I would not post another Real News Network interview with Colin Powell\u2019s former chief of staff when he was Secretary of State, Tom Wilkerson so close to Yves posting Is the US Headed Towards War in Syria? , another interview with the same subject just last week. Yet given the urgency of the topic, reader interest in last week\u2019s post, and the perhaps Panglossian hope that high-level focus on this issue now might limit the range of future options that hawkish Hillary Clinton can take in future\u2013 in what I must admit still looks to be the likeliest scenario, that she is inaugurated come January\u2013 I upload this post. Perhaps if the Obamamometer took time off from his rounds of legacy-burnishing interviews and concentrated on this problem, he might have a chance of correcting one specific aspect of his horrendous existing foreign policy legacy before the clock runs out on his administration. \\nThis Real News Network interview with Lawrence Wilkerson , offers some suggestions on what would be necessary to stop the immediate ongoing slaughter and reach a peaceful solution in the longer term. It\u2019s by no means the most comprehensive nor the last word on the subject. I cleaned up the rush transcript as best I could. Please excuse any remaining errors. \\nSHARMINI PERIES, TRNN: Welcome to the Real News Network. I\u2019\\x92m Sharmini Peries coming to you from Baltimore. As the civil war in Syria rages on, a school was struck in an airstrike in a rebel held area of northern Syria last week. Reports indicate that 22 children died in the attack along with several civilians. The Russians who are supporting Syria\\x92\u2019s president al-Assad denied any involvement in the strike. There\\x92\u2019s also much speculation that Russians were not reelected to the UN Human Rights Council last Friday because of its involvement in Syria. But this is not known for certain since nations do not need to disclose why they choose to reject candidates for the council. Also last week, Amnesty International released a report in which it estimates that US-led coalition airstrikes in Syria have killed at least 300 civilians. It suggests the US military must come clean on the casualties that they have caused. So far, the war in Syria has cost somewhere between 250 thousand and 400 thousand deaths and has created over 4 million refugees. The highly complicated conflict has increased tensions between the US and Russia and a ceasefire seems more remote than ever. \\nJoining us now to take a closer look at the conflict and what is required to end this is Larry Wilkerson. Larry is a retired United States army soldier and former chief of staff to the United States Secretary of State, Colin Powell. Larry, it\\x92\u2019s so good to have you with us today. \\nLARRY WILKERSON: Thanks for having me Sharmini. \\nPERIES: So Larry, last week when we talked, you mentioned that Hillary Clinton\\x92\u2019s proposal to implement a no fly zone over Syria and what that would probably mean is that it would worsen the conflict. So then, what steps need to be taken by the US to bring this conflict to a peaceful resolution? \\nWILKERSON: Sharmini, this is going to sound like the impossible but there are two steps that need to be taken right away, immediately. The first is a high-level policy step which says President Obama and his council of elders, his National Security Council, whatever, should decide that Bashar al-Assad does not have to go. I think from what we have seen, the United States continuing to insist that Bashar al-Assad being untenable\u2013 that is unacceptable as President Obama said it earlier\u2013 is simply a position that now is part and parcel to all this blood and carnage and treasure and lives and diaspora being caused. If you can\\x92\u2019t back up from a strategic error like this and count your loses and say okay I made a mistake. You don\\x92\u2019t have to publicly say that but you have to say that in the councils of government and you have to be able to say I\\x92\u2019m going to rectify that mistake. I miscalculated. \\nBashar al-Assad has enormous support. He has support not just outside Syria from Iran and Russia and elsewhere. He has support from inside Syria. Significant support. Then you have to face the reality too that on the other side you are largely supporting your own enemy, Al Qaeda. No matter what you say about the CIA\\x92\u2019s ability to differentiate between so called moderate rebels and those of the Al Nusra Front and those of Al Qaeda affiliates, that is pure nonsense. The CIA does not have that kind of capability. It does not have that kind of discrimination. So, most of the people we are now arming to fight Assad look a lot like Al Qaeda to me. So, you\u2019ve got to admit you\u2019ve made two huge errors and you have to rectify those errors. Those are the steps you need to make immediately. \\nPERIES: Now what\u2019\\x92s preventing them from doing that and is what you\\x92\u2019re proposing unrealistic in the US diplomatic and military milieu? \\nWILKERSON: Unrealistic if you don\\x92\u2019t have the political will nor the political courage to pursue a rectification of your errors. But what is the consequence? The consequence is more death, more conflict, more destruction, more damage, more tragedy, more refugees, more making Jordan unstable, and so forth. You\\x92\u2019ve got to be able to back up from these strategic errors and instead of doing what throughout history, bad leaders have done, that is reinforce the strategic error until it becomes catastrophic, you\\x92\u2019ve got to reverse it. And you\u2019ve got to replace it with a better policy. You\\x92\u2019ve got to force Saudi Arabia, you\\x92\u2019ve got to force the Qataris, you\\x92\u2019ve got to force the Turks however way you may do it. Economic, political, financial, whatever, you\u2019ve got to force them to follow you. They don\u2019t have to follow you like lapdogs but at least they do have to recognize your change in policy and begin to at least for appearance\u2019s sake, support it. \\nIf the United States were to leave I think the rest of them would, reluctantly somewhat, follow in domain. What does that mean? That means you quit supplying these opposition forces with the massive arms that we are supplying them with. That includes anti-tank missiles and other elements. They\\x92\u2019re just going to make them go on and on and on. After all, Iran and Russia and Syria had an inexhaustible [coffers] of the kind of equipment that they need to oppose us as we do to oppose them. So, what are we doing here? We\\x92\u2019re having a great power confrontation over the graves and the blood of the Syrian people. This just simply has to stop. \\nPERIES: Now in the past, Larry you said that Israel seems to be playing a contradictory role in Syria\\x92\u2019s conflict. If one is to believe that Israel actually prefers Assad to be in power than an Islamic regime there, would it not make sense for US to do what you\\x92\u2019re saying? To reassess and take a step back and keep Assad in power? \\nWILKERSON: I think I\\x92\u2019d have to say the contrary is operating right now Sharmini. Michael Horne has said point blank, he has that Israel would rather \\x96when I say Israel, let me be more precise, Bibi Netanyahu and Bibi Netanyahu\\x92\u2019s government would rather see ISIS in command, Al Qaeda in command in Damascus, than they would Bashar al-Assad. So, that\\x92\u2019s what we\\x92\u2019re up against here. But I don\\x92\u2019t think we\\x92\u2019re up against the Israeli people. If the Israeli people were confronted with the reality of this chaos and this collapse of nations all around them, it\\x92\u2019s more detrimental to their long-term security than coming to some accommodation with these countries and helping them come back to some reasonable degree of stability and political feasibility, I think it\\x92\u2019d get a change of attitude in Israel. \\nBut no one\\x92\u2019s telling them the truth. Everyone is scaring them and everyone is saying well you\\x92\u2019ve got to keep these people in chaos. You\\x92\u2019ve got to keep them on the verge of collapse if not collapsing. You\\x92\u2019ve got to change these regimes and it would be better to have ISIS in charge in Damascus rather than have Assad. Just think how preposterous that is and yet that\\x92\u2019s what\u2019s being said. \\nPERIES: Now in the last few weeks Larry, we\\x92\u2019ve seen the battle of Aleppo covered extensively in the media. However there\\x92\u2019s another battle going on in Mosul similar in that sense in terms of the number of people that it\\x92s attacking and very devastating there as well but very little attention in the media about what\\x92\u2019s happening in Mosul. What is going on there and what\\x92\u2019s the comparison here? \\nWILKERSON: Well the media in this country don\\x92\u2019t care about this place Sharmini. They don\\x92\u2019t care about anything but Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and how big Kim Kardashian is today. What\\x92\u2019s happening in Mosul is in one sense a tactical defeat and maybe even an operational and maybe even strategic defeat for the group known as ISIS, ISIL and their ideal of upholding territory. It\\x92\u2019s going to happen in Mare\u2019. They\\x92\u2019re going to be roundly defeated with regard to that aspect of their strategy. But what\\x92\u2019s going to happen in Mosul afterwards is going to refer back to their previous comments just now Sharmini which are going to have happen in Mosul afterwards is going to be the Turks and the Iraqis confronting one another. \\nEveryone has made it pretty clear that he\u2019\\x92s not going to respond to the Baghdad government\\x92\u2019s request for him to stay out of Mosul in any real way. You\\x92\u2019re going to have Kurds. You\\x92\u2019re going to have all manner of different groups that have sufficient power to contest power in Mosul after ISIS is kicked out. Then you\u2019re going to see the proof of the pudding with regard to whether Iraq stays a state as it is currently constituted, however fragile, or it goes into something else. Splinters into two or three or possibly even more states. And you\\x92\u2019re going to see whether or not the Kurds can be talked into an autonomous relationship with these countries rather than an independent country of their own or whether everyone in Turkey will bless any of that. \\nSo, you\\x92\u2019re going to have the aftermath of Mosul and the defeat of ISIL which I think is going to happen. You\\x92\u2019re going to have that aftermath determine the future of several countries in that region if not the future of the region for many years to come and it\\x92\u2019s going to be indicative of whether or not we\\x92\u2019re going to be able to politically, diplomatically, economically and otherwise forge some kind of stability, some kind of peace, some kind of prosperity for the many young people in the region and bring people home from places like Jordan and Lebanon. And put them back in their own homes in places like Libya and Syria and so forth. The proof of the pudding as I said is going to be in the aftermath of Mosul, not necessarily in the tactical battle occurring there right now. \\nPERIES: Alright Larry, I\\x92ll let you go for now but looking forward to having you back next week. \\nWILKERSON: Thanks. Take care. \\nPERIES: And thank you for joining us on the Real News Network. 0 0 0 0 0 0 This entry was posted in Guest Post on'"}, "time": 1742628448.3413143}
