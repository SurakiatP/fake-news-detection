The number of abortions performed at Planned Parenthood, however, has increased, as have its taxpayer funding and profits. \u201cDespite reports that the number of abortions performed in the United States is declining, Planned Parenthood once again reports an increase in the number of human lives ended in their facilities: 328, 348 abortions last year,\u201d says Americans United for Life\u2019s president Catherine Glenn Foster. \u201cAdditionally, despite their repeated claims that American women rely on them for   health care services, many of their   services have continued to decrease. \u201d #Regram (@mayasworld): @TheLipstickLobby and their new lippie \u201cKiss my Pink\u201d. 100% of net profits go to@PlannedPar  \u2026     https:  .  pic. twitter.   \u2014   The Lipstick Lobby (@TLipstickLobby) May 24, 2017,  Congressional legislation aimed at eliminating Planned Parenthood\u2019s taxpayer funding also seeks to redirect that funding to other community health centers that provide more expansive services and do not perform abortions. \u201cIt\u2019s time to redirect Planned Parenthood\u2019s funding to community health centers,\u201d said Susan B. Anthony president Marjorie Dannenfelser. \u201cThey outnumber Planned Parenthood facilities by an average of 20 to 1 nationwide and are more comprehensive and accessible to the poor. \u201d \u201cTaxpayers would be disentangled from the grisly abortion industry and get a better return on their investment in women\u2019s health,\u201d she added.
