And then last year happened. ON A RECENT SUNDAY afternoon,  Eileen Myles came to meet me in the East Village on a white bicycle with brown leather handlebars. We chose as our destination Saint Mark\u2019s     a historic portal of downtown Manhattan a few blocks from the   apartment where she has lived for nearly 40 years. Since 1966, the church has housed the Poetry Project, which began as a   funded attempt to address the teenage hippie runaway problem by offering free creative writing workshops, and which Myles discovered when she made her way to New York from Boston in 1974, then in her   and not yet out as a lesbian. There, she found the poets drinking and smoking cigarettes around long tables in the church\u2019s back rooms, at seminars run by Alice Notley and Ted Berrigan. Allen Ginsberg came to readings, the group\u2019s leaders were heroes and the East Village felt, to Myles, like the center of   American poetry. \u201cThe romance was that you had to be poor, you had to live in this neighborhood, you had to hang out and read all the books that everybody was reading, stay up all night, have an amazing life and write poetry,\u201d said Myles, who had just returned from a visit to her second home in Marfa, Tex. with a tan. Her look is L. L. Bean meets the South Shore, a grandfatherly assortment of cotton   shirts, wool sweaters, a canvas coat and transition lenses in blond tortoiseshell frames, complemented by a Massachusetts accent that\u2019s most pronounced when she\u2019s reading poems or cracking wise. At the age of 66, Myles has published 19 books of poetry, prose and criticism, but until last year, when Ecco   released her 1994 novel, \u201cChelsea Girls,\u201d many readers didn\u2019t know who she was. That\u2019s not to say she wasn\u2019t famous in her own way  \u2014   if you were a contemporary poet, if you were gay or if you had an interest in the cultural feminism of the 1990s, you probably read her. Each of these communities had its canon, and in their canons Myles figured. But 2015 was the year that the culture machine picked up Myles and transmitted her to a larger audience. The gritty, idealistic outsiders of New York\u2019s creative scenes in the late \u201970s  \u2014   their era\u2019s music, art and general sense of freedom  \u2014   provided an antidote to the homogeneity of today\u2019s pop culture, and few writers captured that romantic rawness quite like Myles. She published poems in The New Yorker and The New York Review of Books for the first time. Young women were reading her work in the coffee shops of Brooklyn. On television, on the Amazon show \u201cTransparent,\u201d the poems of a character named Leslie Mackinaw, played by Cherry Jones, are actually hers, and the fictional feminist professor is based on Myles, too. (Myles and the show\u2019s creator, Jill Soloway, have dated.) This new generation of public feminists, including Beth Ditto, Lena Dunham and Tavi Gevinson, cite her as an inspiration, finding in her writing a ribald and ponderous succession to the New York School. Earlier in her career, she explained, publishers seemed only to accommodate so much difference, so that \u201cif you were going to publish gay work, you were going to publish sentimental gay work, you were going to publish conventional gay work. \u201d Now, she said, \u2018\u2019I think what social media has done is made us relish variables. You know? We\u2019re just living in these floating fragmentations. \u201d And with that came a realization that \u201ceverybody\u2019s queer  \u2014   everybody\u2019s wrongly shaped for a culture that requires conformity. \u201d For many readers discovering Myles\u2019s work for the first time, the experience was accompanied by a sense of confusion: Why hadn\u2019t we read her sooner? Sitting under the   window at Saint Mark\u2019s, Myles suggested that perhaps the distance of time has made her writing more palatable to the public. \u201cTo be too queer,\u201d she said, \u201cto be talking too graphically, closer to the present, is more frightening. \u201d In \u201cChelsea Girls,\u201d Myles describes a world of penny loafers and   jean shorts, the World\u2019s Fair, highway \u201ccomfort stations,\u201d Filene\u2019s Basement, teenagers hanging out in the parking lot of Butterick\u2019s ice cream, \u201cteevee\u201d  \u2014   all familiar baby boomer territory, but without nostalgia, and with a frankness about sexuality that opens a direct channel of connection from then to now. The novel also captures what it was like to be Eileen Myles in Manhattan in the \u201970s and \u201980s, when people planned their book parties according to the astrological calendar and went out afterward to a \u201cglitter ball tall     Italian Lesbian disco environment. \u201d Her narrator gets her amphetamines from a corrupt diet doctor in Flushing, Queens, and redistributes them at the Strand. She subsists on garlic knots, hot dogs, Campbell\u2019s tomato soup, Budweiser and cigarettes. She has lovers of different temperaments and physical forms. One of them convenes an \u201celite junkie salon. \u201d Another throws herself into the East River. Of a stint working a factory job in Maine: \u201cThe men were all men, and we were all lesbians, and everyone loved to get smashed. \u201d Despite having written the book 20 years ago, Myles\u2019s literary style feels as contemporary as the essayistic autobiographical fiction of Sheila Heti, Ben Lerner and Tao Lin, who might be considered her literary offspring. Her work functions as a bridge between many of the discussions of the present  \u2014   about sexual violence, class, \u201c  culture\u201d  \u2014   and a past from which those narratives were often secret or hidden. And even though her writing is now being transmitted on that most mainstream of venues, the \u201cteevee,\u201d it seems to resist assimilation, in part by maintaining its sense of defiance. \u201cI keep getting called a punk poet in the press, because they can\u2019t say dyke,\u201d she said dryly. Myles has been many things, but punk is not one of them. In her early years in New York she worked as a librarian on Wall Street. She sold subway slugs. She was employed by the Department of Corrections, where she would type up Dodgems, the poetry magazine she was publishing, which, at the time, was as common as starting a band. For half a year she was an assistant to the poet James Schuyler who, said Myles, had \u201ca career as a mental patient,\u201d supported by   friends who admired his writing. He lived at the Chelsea Hotel, and every morning Myles would bring him his newspapers and keep him company for the day. Schuyler was one of  Myles\u2019s literary influences, of which there were many: Lucille Clifton, Susie Timmons, John Wieners and, of course, Ginsberg, \u201ca poet who actually got heard. \u201d After sitting in Saint Mark\u2019s for a while, we decided to get lunch at the   Ukrainian diner Veselka, the site of many late evenings for Myles and her friends. She scanned the room as if to surface the memories. \u201cIn the \u201970s it was cool to be a poet,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the \u201980s it was a joke. \u201d And yet, in 1993, when she finished her novel after working on it for 14 years, it proved as resistant to the market as anything else she\u2019d done. Finally getting it published by Black Sparrow Press  \u2014   \u201cthey were indie but they were top of the indie,\u201d she said  \u2014   was a breakthrough. The head of the company, John Martin, saw in Myles a kind of female Bukowski, also a house author, although her own idea of \u201cChelsea Girls\u201d was that it would be \u201c\u2019u2009\u2018On the Road\u2019 for girls,\u201d she said. Its release was followed by a series of unlucky coincidences: Bukowski died the same year it came out and the promotional energy turned to his legacy someone bought the rights to translate the book into French, but the translator died before its completion and although the movie rights to one of its essays, \u201c1969,\u201d were optioned, the film was never made. But maybe the book\u2019s obscurity wasn\u2019t just bad luck: Maybe the culture just wasn\u2019t ready for it. Myles has a theory about her resurgent popularity  \u2014   you might call it the Theory of the Bad Copy, which posits that most people who are breaking with the past do so by presenting initially as bad copies of an accepted person. Which is to say that Myles got published by Black Sparrow as a bad copy of Charles Bukowski. And that Leslie Mackinaw, on \u201cTransparent,\u201d is a bad copy of Myles. And that Hillary Clinton  \u2014   who Myles recently endorsed  \u2014   is a bad copy of the male presidential figure, but one who Myles insists will be different because of her gender. People get published or elected or onto television shows because they\u2019re bad copies painted in broad strokes  \u2014   that\u2019s how difference slips by, and then the bad copies break with the past and make something new. This seems to have been Myles\u2019s plan all along. \u201cIf a fool will persist in their folly, he will be wise, right?\u201d she said, smiling, because she knew she already was.'"}, "time": 1742628433.61495}
