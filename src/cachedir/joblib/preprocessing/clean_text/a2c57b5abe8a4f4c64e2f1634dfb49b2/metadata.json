But now some of the panel\u2019s Democrats are warning that they may pull their support for the inquiry if it becomes mired in   politics. When that might happen is unclear, and Democrats know that the current moment of even tentative comity on the   panel may offer their best chance for scrutinizing links between people close to President Trump and Russian officials. Still, Democrats are bracing for fights over subpoenaing witnesses and documents  \u2014   including, possibly, Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns  \u2014   since Republicans have balked at an outside, independent inquiry into what intelligence officials say was an unprecedented intrusion into an American election by a foreign power. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be part of a    show that is not a serious effort to do an investigation because this is really serious,\u201d said Representative Jackie Speier, Democrat of California. \u201cIf it\u2019s not a legitimate and comprehensive and   investigation, why would we be party to it?\u201d Ms. Speier said the committee\u2019s Democrats  \u2014   all nine of whom were interviewed by The New York Times  \u2014   would not hesitate, \u201cunder certain circumstances,\u201d to pull their support. Democrats are already wary of moves by the committee\u2019s chairman, Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California, to undercut the purported Russian connection. Mr. Nunes has belittled news stories about the Russian links of Mr. Trump\u2019s associates and has pledged  \u2014   along with Senator Richard M. Burr, the North Carolina Republican who leads the Senate Intelligence Committee  \u2014   to examine Mr. Trump\u2019s accusations, made without evidence, that President Barack Obama ordered surveillance of Trump Tower. Mr. Nunes was a prominent supporter of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and served on the administration\u2019s transition team. So far, some Democrats on the House panel said, Mr. Nunes had been receptive to many of their requests in the inquiry. \u201cMost of us would agree that there\u2019s no way we\u2019re participating in any form of   or whitewash, so we will walk away if the moment requires,\u201d said Representative Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut. \u201cBut we\u2019re certainly not there yet. \u201d Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the committee\u2019s top Democrat, said it was unclear whether the panel could conduct a credible investigation, ideally resulting in a single, bipartisan report on its findings. Along with Mr. Nunes, Mr. Schiff is among the   Gang of Eight congressional leaders who receive classified intelligence briefings. \u201cIf we get to the point at any time where I feel we can\u2019t do that, where there are legitimate lines of investigation that are being walled off, then I will say so,\u201d Mr. Schiff told reporters this week. Democrats expect the first major test of the investigation  \u2014   and Mr. Nunes\u2019s stewardship  \u2014   to come on March 20, when the committee holds its first public hearing. An initial list of invited witnesses included James B. Comey, the F. B. I. director James R. Clapper Jr. the director of national intelligence under Mr. Obama and Sally Q. Yates, the former acting attorney general who was fired by the Trump administration after refusing to defend the president\u2019s first travel ban. Absent from the witness list was Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump\u2019s first national security adviser, who resigned after it was revealed that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence and other White House officials about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Though Mr. Nunes emphasized it was only an early list, he referred to Mr. Flynn as \u201ca tangent,\u201d portraying him as more of a victim of the intelligence leaks Mr. Nunes is seeking to investigate than a target of the inquiry. \u201cFrom everything that I can see, his conversations with the Russian ambassador, he was doing this country a favor, and he should be thanked for it,\u201d Mr. Nunes said. Mr. Nunes may need to tread cautiously to avoid the perception of crossing the line from impartial moderator to advocate. He has said the issue of whether Trump Tower was under surveillance during the campaign was well within the scope of the inquiry, and has denied that he added it after the president demanded that Congress investigate. With a tight smile, Mr. Schiff said he welcomed the opportunity to disprove Mr. Trump\u2019s accusation. But some Democrats fumed at the idea that the panel\u2019s work could give credence to it. Should the issue not be put to rest quickly, Ms. Speier said, \u201cit would call into question the entire investigation. \u201d Several Democrats said they expected their desire to compel certain witnesses to testify to stoke friction among Republicans. But a flash point could come if Democrats press to subpoena Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns, a move that could scuttle the entire inquiry. Democrats have favored an outside, independent investigation, but many of them see the panel\u2019s inquiry as the best they can do. And they are keenly aware that by pulling their support, they would sacrifice their roles in an investigation some see as among the most important of their time in public service. \u201cIt\u2019s a big jump to pull out of this investigation, no matter how bad it is,\u201d said Representative Mike Quigley, Democrat of Illinois. \u201cBecause whatever truth you can bleed out of this thing, the better off you are. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561986.7280035}
