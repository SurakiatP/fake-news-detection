But Prudential is not the only insurance company that may have been affected by allegedly fraudulent insurance policy sales at Wells Fargo. On Monday, Wells Fargo announced that it had temporarily cut off its sales of another insurance product it had offered at its bank branches: renters\u2019 insurance from Assurant. \u201cWe are suspending referrals for renters\u2019 insurance until we can do a complete review of our online insurance product referrals,\u201d said Mark Folk, a spokesman for Wells Fargo. Assurant and Wells Fargo declined to comment on whether they had uncovered any problems with Wells Fargo\u2019s renters\u2019 insurance sales. \u201cAs a matter of policy, we don\u2019t comment on our clients,\u201d said Linda Recupero, a spokeswoman for Assurant. Last week, three former Prudential employees filed a   lawsuit asserting that the company had tried to hush up evidence that Wells Fargo bankers  \u2014   who were supposed to market a   Prudential policy, MyTerm, to their customers  \u2014   opened sham accounts in customers\u2019 names and had premiums withdrawn from their accounts without their consent or knowledge. Many of the victims did not speak English, the suit said. The employees had been fired by Prudential  \u2014   in retaliation, they say, for trying to prod their bosses to act more aggressively on the findings. Prudential disputes this account Scot Hoffman, a Prudential spokesman, said the employees were fired \u201cfor appropriate and legitimate reasons that were entirely unrelated to Prudential\u2019s business with Wells Fargo. \u201d At least one other bank, BBT, continues to sell Prudential\u2019s MyTerm insurance, but the majority of the product\u2019s sales came through Wells Fargo, Mr. Hoffman said. He said the timing of Prudential\u2019s decision to suspend sales through Wells Fargo  \u2014   which came just days after Prudential\u2019s former employees went public with their claims  \u2014   was coincidental. \u201cWe have been conducting our review for some time,\u201d Mr. Hoffman said. \u201cIt became apparent last week in discussions with Wells Fargo that it was going to take more time. We thought that suspending sales of the MyTerm product through the Wells Fargo franchise was the best course of action until we have all the facts about whether it is being distributed properly and in the best interest of customers. \u201d Prudential would appear to be the first partner company of Wells Fargo to get caught in the aftermath of the bank\u2019s admission three months ago that thousands of its employees had opened unauthorized accounts in bank customers\u2019 names. The bank has fired more than 5, 000 employees and paid fines of $185 million in connection with the scandal. Wells Fargo employees were encouraged to aggressively sell a mix of products to their customers, former Wells Fargo employees said, including insurance offerings from partners. The renters\u2019 insurance Wells Fargo sold for Assurant had some similarities to Prudential\u2019s MyTerm policies: Both were fairly inexpensive products that could be bought in a few minutes, after the applicant filled out a brief online questionnaire. \u201cAs we have consistently reinforced, if we identify any instances where a customer received a product they didn\u2019t ask for, we will make it right,\u201d Mr. Folk said. The bank eliminated its sales goals for retail bankers in October, he noted. It no longer offers incentives for selling customers additional products, including insurance policies. Also on Monday, Alex Perea, a Wells Fargo customer who said he had been victimized by the insurance scheme, filed a lawsuit against Prudential. He and his lawyers are seeking   status for the case. Mr. Perea, of Arizona, received a collections notice in October about unpaid premiums on a MyTerm policy, according to his complaint. A Wells Fargo customer since 2010, Mr. Perea \u201cnever authorized anyone to seek life insurance on his behalf\u201d and was unaware that a Prudential policy had been taken out in his name, he said in the lawsuit. When he called Prudential\u2019s customer service center, the insurance company refused to cancel the policy, the complaint said. Mr. Perea later discovered that some premiums for the policy had been deducted from his Wells Fargo savings account. Through his lawyer, Neil Mullin, Mr. Perea declined to comment further on his complaint. The case was filed in Federal District Court in New Jersey, the state where Prudential is headquartered. \u201cPrudential believes the lawsuit is totally without merit and will vigorously defend itself in the appropriate legal venue,\u201d said Mr. Hoffman, the company spokesman. \u201cIf any Wells Fargo MyTerm customers have concerns about the way in which the product was purchased, Prudential will reimburse the full amount of the premiums they paid and cancel the policy. \u201d Wells Fargo\u2019s sales scandal rocked the bank, forcing the retirement of its chief executive and causing some of its customers to flee. The bank is under investigation by the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission, multiple state attorneys general and prosecutors\u2019 offices, and several congressional committees. The aftershocks keep coming: On Friday, an industry overseer, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, said it was investigating claims from former Wells Fargo employees that the bank left black marks on their employment records in retaliation for their attempts to draw internal attention to the bank\u2019s fraudulent activities. Finra wants to \u201creview the facts and circumstances surrounding these allegations,\u201d it said in a statement, and it has set up a hotline for former Wells Fargo employees  \u2014   many of them financial advisers  \u2014   who are registered with Finra and wish to dispute their termination records.'"}, "time": 1742628428.6831703}
