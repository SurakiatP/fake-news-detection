Radiohead worries throughout the album: about environmental devastation, about mass thoughtlessness, about love gone cold, about finding some way forward. \u201cYou\u2019ve really messed up everything,\u201d Thom Yorke sings in \u201cFul Stop,\u201d one of the album\u2019s few   songs, though it uses its insistent beat for jitters, not pleasurable motion. On this album, grim tidings arrive amid gorgeous backdrops: gentle pianos and acoustic guitars reinforced by a string orchestra. Multilayered tinklings and murmurings give the music a subliminally shimmering aura. But this is Radiohead, whose beauty is always laced with dread for the most part, \u201cA Moon Shaped Pool\u201d is an album of nightmare lullabies. In \u201cDaydreaming,\u201d a somber, undulating piano waltz, Mr. Yorke croons, \u201cBeyond the point of no   it\u2019s too late, the damage is done. \u201d The album\u2019s opening track, \u201cBurn the Witch,\u201d is a spiral of tension, cryptically portraying a society ignoring its own witch hunts as a clattery, insistent string arrangement ratchets up the dissonance and agitation. Throughout the album, the state of the world and the state of the singer\u2019s heart shade into one another. \u201cWhen I see you messing me around, I don\u2019t want to know,\u201d Mr. Yorke sings in \u201cIdentikit,\u201d and whether he\u2019s thinking about personal, political or corporate betrayal  \u2014   or just about the way facial features can be interchanged and messed around with in a police    \u2014   is unclear, even after the   chorus arrives: \u201cBroken hearts make it rain. \u201d In \u201cPresent Tense,\u201d a bittersweet bossa nova akin to past Radiohead songs like \u201cKnives Out\u201d and \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d Mr. Yorke sings, \u201cAs my world comes crashing  \u2019ll be dancing, freaking out\u201d and wonders, \u201cWill all this love have been in vain?\u201d Mr. Yorke, 47, and his partner of 23 years, Rachel Owen, separated last year, releasing a statement that the parting was \u201cperfectly amicable\u201d at the end of \u201cDaydreaming,\u201d Mr. Yorke\u2019s voice is played in reverse, repeating \u201cHalf my life. \u201d But the songs shouldn\u2019t be reduced to autobiography. Radiohead, and Mr. Yorke on his own, have been playing some of the album\u2019s material  \u2014   \u201dIdentikit,\u201d \u201cPresent Tense\u201d and \u201cTrue Love Waits\u201d  \u2014   onstage for years as they painstakingly tinkered with them in the studio. \u201cBurn the Witch\u201d has been hinted at for more than a decade. Every hiss and creak on the album has probably been weighed and considered. \u201cA Moon Shaped Pool\u201d was five years in the making, a little longer than the   gaps between \u201cHail to the Thief\u201d (2003) \u201cIn Rainbows\u201d (2007) and \u201cThe King of Limbs\u201d (2011). That\u2019s how Radiohead works now, in fits and starts between Mr. Yorke\u2019s side projects (Atoms for Peace, appearances at protests and benefit concerts) and the guitarist Jonny Greenwood\u2019s soundtracks (among them \u201cThere Will Be Blood,\u201d \u201cThe Master\u201d and \u201cInherent Vice\u201d) and collaborations (such as \u201cJunun,\u201d with the composer Shye Ben Tzur). The songs thrive on their coalition, melding Mr. Yorke\u2019s troubled words and aching melodies with Mr. Greenwood\u2019s textural mastery (including, presumably, the string arrangements) and the   contributions of the rest of the band. Both Mr. Yorke and Mr. Greenwood are relentlessly inquisitive listeners, lovers of melody and explorers of idioms, makers of puzzles who don\u2019t shy away from emotion. One thing Radiohead no longer worries about is digital technology. During the 1990s, when Radiohead made \u201cOK Computer,\u201d its songs warned desperately about technology\u2019s incursions on individuality. But in Radiohead\u2019s music now, technology is just a tool, ubiquitous and unremarkable, not the center of attention. \u201cA Moon Shaped Pool\u201d uses the studio extensively, but reveals the human activity there. Regardless of how it was assembled, the sound of the album is largely acoustic and analog: a little hazy, a little noisy, avoiding the metronomic. \u201cDaydreaming\u201d opens with that most analog of effects, a wavering pitch like a tape slipping  . The technology just helps capture and loop the tones of acoustic guitars, keyboards, percussion and voices, whether or not they\u2019re fed through analog distortion gadgets it\u2019s as amoral as a microphone or an amplifier. And the music sounds unplugged even where it\u2019s obviously programmed. The results often hark back to the late 1960s in a way, \u201cA Moon Shaped Pool\u201d is Radiohead\u2019s   album. \u201cThe Numbers,\u201d which Radiohead fans have previously known as \u201cSilent Spring,\u201d counsels, \u201cWe are of the   her we do return,\u201d and comes as close as Radiohead gets to a call to arms: \u201cWe\u2019ll take back what is ours,\u201d it insists. The production hints at Buffalo Springfield\u2019s \u201cExpecting to Fly,\u201d with stately swells of guitar and gusts of strings. \u201cDesert Island Disk\u201d recalls the   folk experiments of Pentangle and the electronic phantasms of early Tim Buckley as Mr. Yorke envisions \u201cthe wind rushing \u2019round my open heart, an open ravine. \u201d Yet it\u2019s the rare song on the album that offers a glimpse of hope  \u2014   a feeling of being \u201ctotally alive, totally released. \u201d \u201cGlass Eyes\u201d starts as the bleakest of ballads, with minor piano chords drifting into the fog as the singer arrives in a frightening unknown town and finds, perhaps, an escape. \u201cA path trails off and heads down the mountain,\u201d he sings. \u201cI don\u2019t know where it   don\u2019t really care. \u201d The album ends with \u201cTrue Love Waits,\u201d a love song Radiohead wrote in the 1990s and first recorded on a 2001 live EP, \u201cI Might Be Wrong,\u201d with Mr. Yorke simply strumming and singing alone, building up to the song\u2019s pleading refrain, \u201cDon\u2019t leave, don\u2019t leave. \u201d Two decades later, its studio version testifies to what Radiohead\u2019s patient perfectionism can achieve. Instead of guitar chords, it starts with four repeating piano notes, a chord dissected and laid bare. The same piano figure sketches the song\u2019s other chords through the first verse. Gradually, more pianos are overdubbed: in rippling loops, low resonant tones and repeated chords, not so much filling out the arrangement as emanating alongside it, somewhere between harmonious and oblivious. It\u2019s a world that exists outside one man\u2019s longings, and won\u2019t be eclipsed by them.'"}, "time": 1742561666.4923506}
