Specifically, the the plaintiff charged the defendants with: \\n\u201cRape, sexual misconduct, criminal sexual acts, sexual abuse, forcible touching, assault, battery, intentional, and reckless inflection of emotional distress, duress, false imprisonment, and defamation.\u201d Jane Doe v. Donald J. Trump and Jeffrey E. Epstein . \\nJudge Ronnie Abrams scheduled a December 16, 2016 pretrial conference to set a timeline for the case in the U.S District Court, Southern District in Manhattan. \\nThe complaint argues for the use of Jane Doe rather than the plaintiff\u2019s actual name: \u201cThis litigation involves matters that are highly sensitive and of a personal nature, and identification of Plaintiff would pose a risk of retaliatory physical harm to her and to others.\u201d \\nThe heart of Jane Doe\u2019s complaint is summarized below: \\n\u201cPlaintiff was enticed by promises of money and a modeling career to attend a series of parties, with other similarly situated minor females, held at a New York City residence that was being used by Defendant Jeffrey Epstein. \u2026 \\n\u201cDefendant Trump initiated sexual contact with Plaintiff at four different parties. On the fourth and final sexual encounter with Defendant Trump, Defendant Trump tied Plaintiff to a bed, exposed himself to Plaintiff, and then proceeded to forcibly rape Plaintiff. During the course of this savage sexual attack, Plaintiff loudly pleaded with Defendant Trump to stop but with no effect. Defendant Trump responded to Plaintiff\u2019s pleas by violently striking Plaintiff in the face with his open hand and screaming that he would do whatever he wanted. Exhs. A and B.\u201d Jane Doe v. Donald J. Trump and Jeffrey E. Epstein . \\nThe complaint against Epstein describes behavior similar to that of Trump. \\nEpstein \u2013 a convicted sex offender \\nPalm Beach, Florida investigators produced a probable cause affidavit in 2006 that documented Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s \u201cunlawful sexual activity with\u201d 4 minors and \u201clewd and lascivious molestation.\u201d The crimes took place at Epstein\u2019s Palm Beach mansion where he entertained lavishly. \\nEpstein hired Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershhowitz and former special prosecutor Kenneth Starr as his defense team. Even though FBI and other investigations accumulated a victim list of 40 underage girls in Florida , the case was settled in 2008 when Epstein pleaded guilty to one count of soliciting prostitution from underage girls. He was sentenced to 18 months, served 13, and had to register as a risk level 3-sex offender in New York (the highest level). \\nTrump \u2013 brags about close friendship with Epstein \\nBefore Epstein\u2019s legal problems, Trump did a 2002 interview in New York Magazine in which he described a long-term relationship with Epstein. \\n\u201cI\u2019ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He\u2019s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it \u2014 Jeffrey enjoys his social life.\u201d New York Magazine \\nTrump had Epstein at a guest at his Florida mansion and Epstein had Trump as a guest as his estates in Florida and New York. \\nWill the case go forward if Trump wins the election? \\nIf the case is not dismissed, the scheduling conference on the December 16 will outline various tasks and dates over the first few months of 2017, including the dates for the inauguration of the 45 th President of the United States. If that happens to be Donald Trump, there is nothing to prevent the trial from going forward. The Supreme Court decision in the Bill Clinton \u2013 Paula Jones case established the right of citizens to sue presidents in civil court for acts committed prior to taking office. \\nIf the case moves forward, the evidence in the exhibits and subsequent information, the quality of representation at trial, and the judge and jury are the central factors that will determine if a sitting president or losing presidential candidate will do some serious time for the heinous crimes alleged. Unlike the original Epstein case, the visibility for this matter is so high, backroom deals for the rich and famous will be virtually impossible.'"}, "time": 1742561951.383911}
