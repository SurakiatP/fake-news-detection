[Jerusalem Police Spokeswoman Luba Simri explained the policeman was walking down a street near the Lion\u2019s Gate, an entrance to the Old City, when the officer was stabbed in the face and body by the Jordanian citizen,    Mohammed Abdullah Salim  .  \u201cThe terrorist rushed toward him, whipped out a knife that he had in his possession, stormed him and began stabbing him. The police officer responded with determination and in a professional manner, managed to activate his weapon and neutralized the terrorist,\u201d Simri told reporters. A second policeman was stabbed in the hand while helping to subdue the terrorist, who reportedly entered Israel several days ago. The Israeli police released graphic video of the attack (watch it below) in which Kasaji can clearly be seen repeatedly stabbing the policeman, who had been knocked to the floor.  Jordan\u2019s Foreign Ministry in Tel Aviv described the attack as an \u201cugly crime. \u201d Jordan was referring to the policeman\u2019s   and not to the reportedly unprovoked terrorist attack by one of its own citizens. Jordan\u2019s Minister of Communications Muhammad  \u2019man was quoted as saying, \u201cThe Israeli government, as the occupying power in Jerusalem, bears responsibility for the shooting of a Jordanian civilian who was killed. \u201d Mu\u2019man failed to note that the terrorist, Kasaji, was killed while stabbing the officer. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the Jordanian statements. \u201cIt is time that Jordan ceases its double sided game. Just as Israel condemns terror attacks in Jordan, Jordan must condemn terrorist attacks in Israel. Terror is terror,\u201d Netanyahu said. The Times of Israel further reported on today\u2019s terrorist attack: The    police officer was taken to Jerusalem\u2019s Shaare Tzedek Medical Center in moderate condition after the incident near the Lions\u2019 Gate. He had wounds in the neck and head, and was conscious and in stable condition when evacuated to the hospital. A second man was lightly wounded, with cuts to the hand.   \u2026    After the incident police arrested a local merchant who they suspected prevented   from helping the policeman during the attack.
