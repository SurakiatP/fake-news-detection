But as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe prepares to pay his respects at Pearl Harbor on Tuesday, Japanese officials are scrambling to identify what, exactly, is unprecedented about his reciprocal visit. Mr. Abe announced this month that he would visit Pearl Harbor. Japan\u2019s Foreign Ministry, in news briefings, indicated at the time that he would be the first sitting Japanese prime minister to visit Pearl Harbor, the site of the surprise attack on a United States naval base 75 years ago. It turns out, though, that he might not be the first, or even the second. It now appears that he is the fourth. A few days after Mr. Abe announced his visit, news reports emerged that a predecessor, Shigeru Yoshida, had stopped in Hawaii in 1951 on his way home from signing a treaty in San Francisco and had paid a quiet visit to Pearl Harbor. And last week, a   newspaper in Hawaii reported that it had found in its archives articles about two other visits there by sitting Japanese prime ministers in the 1950s, including Nobusuke Kishi, Mr. Abe\u2019s grandfather. In response to the reports, Japanese officials are now characterizing Mr. Abe\u2019s visit as the first by a sitting prime minister with an American president to the memorial atop the remains of the U. S. S. Arizona, the American battleship on which the worst losses occurred. Mr. Abe will accompany Mr. Obama to the memorial, which was constructed in 1962. After the existence of the prior visits was reported, Japan\u2019s Foreign Ministry acknowledged that in 1956 Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama had visited the United States Pacific Command in Honolulu, and that Mr. Kishi had followed in 1957. Mr. Kishi was also reported to have visited the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, a mountaintop shrine dedicated to the American dead in several wars. Mr. Abe\u2019s office said that \u201cit was difficult to confirm as it was contained in records more than 60 years ago. \u201d It is possible that the current government did not realize that the prime minister\u2019s predecessors had visited Pearl Harbor. Robert Dujarric, the director of the Institute of Contemporary Asian Studies at Temple University in Tokyo, said he was not familiar with either Mr. Hatoyama\u2019s or Mr. Kishi\u2019s visits. \u201cThey weren\u2019t big time, official state visits,\u201d he said. At the time, the news media on both sides of the Pacific provided scant coverage. The New York Times did not cover any of the prime ministers\u2019 visits to Pearl Harbor, and both The Associated Press and The Nikkei Shimbun of Japan described Mr. Kishi\u2019s visit to Honolulu without mentioning Pearl Harbor. In a memoir, Mr. Hatoyama recounted his trip to Honolulu and his stop at the United States Pacific Command. \u201cIn front of the building, the Army brass band was ready and they fired a   salute and the band played the Japanese national anthem for me,\u201d Mr. Hatoyama wrote. \u201cIt happened at the top of a hill overlooking Pearl Harbor, so I got a catch in my throat. \u201d Mr. Abe apparently did not know that his grandfather, Mr. Kishi, had been to Pearl Harbor. Mr. Abe has professed his desire to fulfill his grandfather\u2019s thwarted effort to revise the pacifist clause in Japan\u2019s Constitution. Historians speculated that the prime ministers who visited Pearl Harbor in the 1950s would have kept a low profile because the wounds of the attack were still raw and the United States and Japan were establishing the terms of their postwar alliance. What\u2019s more, said Hironao Suzuki, a professor of political science at Shizuoka University, the \u201cpolitical conflict between the left and right was so fierce that there might have been concern that the public might not accept the visits. \u201d In postwar Japan, the left assailed the Japanese alliance with the United States, while the right defended Japan\u2019s actions during World War II as a matter of  . The Americans also had strategic reasons to treat the early Japanese visits to Pearl Harbor with delicacy. \u201cFor the American public, also, we had to do this real pirouette from vilifying the inhuman, disgusting, vile Japanese to being our best friends in the Pacific,\u201d said Jeff Kingston, the director of Asian studies at Temple University in Tokyo. And in the case of Mr. Kishi, who was accused of war crimes (although he was never indicted) the American government might have been reluctant to highlight his trip to Pearl Harbor. \u201cThere was no possible gain to be made from making this public,\u201d Mr. Kingston said. \u201cAnd there was some political risk at making it known. \u201d In answering questions about why the Japanese government had not recognized the earlier visits, Yoshihide Suga, Mr. Abe\u2019s chief cabinet secretary, told reporters on Monday that Mr. Abe would be \u201cthe first to express remorse\u201d at the Pearl Harbor memorial. Indeed, the politics of apology began to gain currency only in the 1980s, said Alexis Dudden, a professor at the University of Connecticut who specializes in modern Japanese history. Both Mr. Hatoyama and Mr. Kishi would have stopped in Hawaii because they needed to make refueling stops on the way home from Washington. And when they visited the United States Pacific Command, Ms. Dudden said, \u201cthose were more likely visits of assurance that in fact now the Cold War was up and running and Japan was very much an ally. \u201d Mr. Abe\u2019s visit, on the other hand, represents \u201ca formulaic understanding of contrition that enables a nation to reinstate itself as sufficiently contrite in order to move on into the future,\u201d she said. For those on the left in Japan, as well as critics in China, South Korea and elsewhere, the prime minister\u2019s visit to Pearl Harbor ignores Japanese aggression closer to home in Asia. \u201cI can only hope that building on this visit, Abe will take the opportunity to go to Nanjing and Seoul,\u201d Ms. Dudden said. Other historians said that whether Mr. Abe was the first or fourth prime minister to visit Pearl Harbor was less significant than what he does when he is there. \u201cWhat we should watch is what Mr. Abe will say,\u201d said Masayasu Hosaka, a historian who has written books about the wartime Emperor Hirohito and Prime Minister Hideki Tojo. \u201cThat\u2019s more important. How his speech will be evaluated historically and internationally is more interesting. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562042.1088126}
