Ted Cruz ( ) \u201cone of the leading constitutionalists\u201d in America, conservative giant Mark Levin engaged the prominent Texan senator at CPAC on Thursday in a   conversation covering the Constitution, immigration, and the Second Amendment. Many   are wondering if Cruz might be President Trump\u2019s next pick for the Supreme Court. [\u201cLet me ask you about the courts,\u201d Levin said early through the interview, asking Cruz about the recent decision from the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit against Trump\u2019s executive order restricting foreigners from seven   nations from entering the United States.  \u201cYou look at judicial activism,\u201d Cruz began, unloading on the San   appeals court. \u201cThey don\u2019t even cite the controlling federal law!\u201d he exclaimed, noting that Congress in 8 U. S. C. \u00a7 1182( f) explicitly delegated to the president the power to do precisely what Trump did in issuing Executive Order 13, 769. Cruz also tackled the Second Amendment, blasting a decision this week from the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which held that firearms useful in military conflicts are not protected by the Second Amendment. \u201cIt is nuts!\u201d the senator declared. \u201cIf we were living back in 1789, your musket would be really useful for military conflict,\u201d yet muskets are clearly protected as part of the right to bear arms. He explained that the Second Amendment is \u201cabout protecting your home, and your family, and your life,\u201d and that any firearms that could achieve that purpose could also be used in a military setting. But, he continued, this appeals court \u2014  which is now dominated by liberal   judges \u2014  have excluded all such firearms from constitutional protection. \u201cSo apparently the Second Amendment protects \u201d Cruz added sarcastically, saying that if someone breaks into your home, the owner can make sure the intruder is clean while he\u2019s robbing the house. Later the conversation shifted to Jeff Sessions becoming the nation\u2019s top law enforcement officer as attorney general. \u201cLet me just say that again: \u2018Attorney General Jeff Sessions,\u2019\u201d Cruz said, to the laughter and applause of the crowd. \u201cI just like to make Chuck Schumer twitch,\u201d he quipped. \u201cThe Democrats right now are living in an alternative universe,\u201d he went on, discussing Democratic reactions to Sessions and various other presidential appointments. He pointed out that Democrats have no one to blame but themselves. Focusing again on the former Alabama senator, Cruz kept the applause coming with, \u201cLet me, on behalf of CPAC, thank Harry Reid  \u2026     Harry Reid, that you for Attorney General Jeff Sessions,\u201d singling out other Cabinet officials for praise as well. Cruz also promised that, one way or the other, Senate Republicans would also get Judge Neil Gorsuch confirmed to the Supreme Court. After Gorsuch is confirmed, there\u2019s already buzz about who conservatives want to see as the next nominee to the High Court. Experts expect two more vacancies, likely for Justices Anthony Kennedy and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, during Trump\u2019s current   presidential term. When talking with top conservative leaders at CPAC, two names keep popping up, neither of whom is a judge. One is former U. S. Solicitor General Paul Clement. The other is Sen. Ted Cruz.
