South Africa, which was instituting apartheid at the time, objected to an interracial couple\u2019s leading a neighboring country Britain opposed the marriage because   South Africa did and Botswanans were angry that their leader had chosen a queen not of their race or tribe. Reviewing \u201cA United Kingdom\u201d for The New York Times, Glenn Kenny said the best reason to see the film was Mr. Oyelowo\u2019s performance and added, \u201cIt is remarkable, genuinely riveting work. \u201d One scene in particular encapsulates the performance: an   meeting at which he must convince his countrymen that he should remain their king and that they should accept his wife. In an interview at The Times, Mr. Oyelowo, who was also a producer of the film, explained how, for this scene, he drew on his own life as well as historical research. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation: How did you think about this scene? For me, things hopefully come together. Obviously you have to know your lines and know them well enough in front of a crowd, [so] you harness their attention. There\u2019s also the accent: Seretse Khama had a Botswana accent, but he also spent a lot of time in the U. K. so his accent was a hybrid. And sometimes the emotion can take over and the technical aspects can go by the wayside, and you don\u2019t want that to happen. Then there\u2019s the truth of what he\u2019s saying, the emotional truth. None of the technical work means anything unless there is an emotional connection  \u2014   for you as the actor but also to the people you\u2019re delivering the speech to and then the audience as well. What was the attitude you started out with when you looked out into the crowd? It was one of those rare instances for me as an actor where what I say as the character very much overlapped with what I believe as a person myself. And so I felt a lot of the emotions I imagine Seretse Khama would have felt. We shot it in Botswana in front of a Botswana crowd, a lot of whom would know who Seretse Khama was. So in some ways, it\u2019s a real test to play this leader who means so much to them and to convince them both within the film and as real people who see me as an actor not from Botswana.  Do you think about posture or other physical things when you\u2019re performing?  I found through my research and watching footage [that Khama] was an incredibly poised man, a very elegant man. And I felt in this speech, there should be a stillness to him. I\u2019ve always felt stillness gives status. And even though he is emotional [throughout] this speech, he never loses his dignity.  When people aren\u2019t engaged in the crowd, how do you get them back? Any actor will tell you this. I\u2019ve done a lot of stage, and you can see how the audience is reacting. Sometimes you have people asleep in the front row. Sometimes people are crying their eyes out. You have to try to find a place within you that doesn\u2019t take it personally. Thankfully, most people seemed engaged, but sometimes people weren\u2019t. And you have to use those people you probably zone in on someone who seems not so interested. In the scene, a single tear falls. How do you make that happen? For me, any emotion I have, it\u2019s not technical. I am not one of those people who can cry on cue. It has to feel real.  Is there anything in your performance as the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in \u201cSelma\u201d that you brought to this role? In many ways, I was desperate to make sure there was a distinction between myself as Dr. King giving a speech and Seretse Khama giving a speech. Of course, these are completely different men, but they have me in common in movies, and I was very mindful that they must remain distinct.'"}, "time": 1742563590.4099333}
