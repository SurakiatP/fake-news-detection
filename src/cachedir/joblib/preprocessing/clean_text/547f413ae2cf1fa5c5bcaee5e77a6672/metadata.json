When Saudi Arabia executed the prominent nonviolent Shia dissident Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, causing protests throughout the Shia world and inflaming sectarian divisions, The New York Times noted that the Podesta Group provided the newspaper with a Saudi commentator who defended the execution.\u201d \\nNotably, the Saudis\u2019 reputation has only worsened as further atrocities pile up \u2014 concerning not only a record number of barbaric beheadings this year, but suspiciously reckless and errant U.S.-backed coalition bombings of civilian sites in several regions of active conflict. \\nAdditionally, Tony Podesta\u2019s status as a registered foreign agent for Saudi Arabia is at least obliquely discussed in an email from April 15, 2015 \u2014 ironically revealed by Wikileaks\u2019 publishing of his brothers personal communiques \u2014 in which former Clinton Foundation chief development officer and now campaign national finance director Dennis Cheng wrote to a small group of insiders: \\n\u201cHi all \u2013 we do need to make a decision on this ASAP as our friends who happen to be registered with FARA [Foreign Agents Registration Act] are already donating and raising. \\n\u201cI do want to push back a bit (it\u2019s my job!): I feel like we are leaving a good amount of money on the table (both for primary and general, and then DNC and state parties)\u2026 and how do we explain to people that we\u2019ll take money from a corporate lobbyist but not them; that the Foundation takes $ from foreign govts but we now won\u2019t. Either way, we need to make a decision soon.\u201d \\nTo which general counsel to the Clinton campaign, attorney Marc Elias, replied [all errors original and emphasis added], \\n\u201cResponding to all on this. I was not on the call this morning, but I lean away from a bright line rule here. It seems odd to say that someone who represents Alberta, Canada can\u2019t give, but a lobbyist for Phillip Morris can. Just as we vet lobbyists case by case, I would do the same with FARA. While this may lead to a large number of FARA registrants being denied, it would not be a flat our ban. A total ban feels arbitrary and will engender the same eye-rolling and ill will that it did for Obama.\u201d \\nAs the exchange continues, how to precisely handle the campaign\u2019s image with potentially controversial donors \u2014 while, at all costs, maintaining the flow of cash \u2014 becomes even more apparent. As strategist and campaign manager Robby Mook responds, \\n\u201cWhere do we draw the line though?\u201d \\nElias suggests a particularly intricate solution: \\n\u201cIf we do it case by case, then it will be subjective. We would look at who the donor is and what foreign entity they are registered for. In judging whether to take the money, we would consider the relationship between that country and the United States, its relationship to the State Department during Hillary\u2019s time as Secretary, and its relationship, if any, to the Foundation. In judging the individual, we would look at their history of support for political candidates generally and Hillary\u2019s past campaigns specifically. \\n\u201cPut simply, we would use the same criteria we use for lobbyists, except with a somewhat more stringent screen. \\n\u201cAs a legal matter, I am not saying we have to do this \u2013 we can decide to simply ban foreign registrants entirely. I\u2019m just offering this up as a middle ground.\u201d \\nMook eventually decides plainly, \\n\u201cMarc made a convincing case to me this am that these sorts of restrictions don\u2019t really get you anything\u2026that Obama actually got judged MORE harshly as a result. He convinced me. So\u2026in a complete U-turn, I\u2019m ok just taking the money and dealing with any attacks. Are you guys ok with that?\u201d \\nAll of this political wrangling appears to have had the desired effect \u2014 despite increasing calls for the United States to either rein in or sever completely its support for the bloody Saudi regime \u2014 the U.S. approved a stunning $1.29 billion sale of smart bombs to the Kingdom in November 2015. \\nTony Podesta\u2019s specific contract with the government-run Center for Studies and Media Affairs at the Saudi Royal Court, which will earn $1.68 million by year\u2019s end, does, indeed, suggest the infusion of a pro-Saudi message into the U.S. media propaganda machine. \\n\u201cSaudi Arabia is consistently one of the bigger players when it comes to foreign influence in Washington,\u201d Sunlight Foundation spokesman Josh Stewart told the Washington Post . \u201cThat spans both what you\u2019d call the inside game, which is lobbying and government relations, and the outside game, which is PR and other things that tend to reach a broader audience than just lobbying.\u201d \\nThat broader audience \u2014 the American public \u2014 has indeed been manipulated courtesy of at least the thoroughly-corrupt Clinton campaign if not surreptitiously by the Saudis, as well. \\nAs The Free Thought Project has repeatedly reported , the evidence of collusion among the Democratic National Committee, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, and the mainstream presstitutes is indisputable \u2014 including no less than 65 so-called journalists listed by name in various leaks as darlings of the campaign. \\nAlthough this level of corruption and collusion would be considered intolerable in nearly any other nation on the planet. And yet, at the center of this shit storm of contention is an official nominee for the White House \u2014 who will not be held responsible for any number of questionable and criminal acts. \\nThe system isn\u2019t rigged \u2014 it\u2019s performing exactly as intended \u2014 and always will as long as the vote validates its existence.
