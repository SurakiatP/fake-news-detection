First Lady Melania Trump may be the best hope for White House advisers who are trying to convince President Donald Trump to tweet less or, at the very least, more judiciously.  The First Lady was apparently a big reason why Trump did not tweet as much while he was abroad for his first foreign trip as President, according to Politico\u2019s White House reporter Annie Karni. She tweeted, \u201cI\u2019ve been told a factor in the lack of tweeting abroad overall was the presence of Melania Trump. \u201d   I\u2019ve been told a factor in the lack of tweeting abroad overall was the presence of Melania Trump. https:  .   \u2014   Annie Karni (@anniekarni) May 27, 2017,  Melania Trump is expected to move into the White House next month, Trump\u2019s advisers have told media outlets in recent days that they may want lawyers to vet Trump\u2019s tweets so they \u201cdon\u2019t go from the president\u2019s mind out to the universe. \u201d According to the New York Times, Trump has \u201cbeen told by his lawyers to limit his posts. Each one, they argue privately, could be used as evidence in a legal case against him. \u201d The Times wrote that Trump \u201cwent through his entire overseas trip without posting a single incendiary message. \u201d After former House Speaker John Boehner \u2014  who reportedly, at the urging of Trump\u2019s chief of staff Reince Priebus, called Trump and persuaded him to sign the most recent spending bill that Trump may have wanted to veto \u2014  said last week that Trump\u2019s presidency was a \u201ccomplete disaster,\u201d Trump reportedly wanted to hammer him on Twitter but refrained from doing so. None other than media pioneer Matt Drudge wondered a few months ago if Melania Trump would be to Trump what Nancy Reagan was to Ronald Reagan once she moves into the White House. While making a rare radio appearance on Michael Savage\u2019s radio show for Savage\u2019s 75th birthday on March 31, Drudge wondered, \u201ccould this help soften some of Trump\u2019s edges?\u201d Drudge mentioned that Nancy Reagan was known as the \u201csecret behind Ronnie\u201d because she \u201csoothed him  \u2026     she played watchdog. \u201d During the 2016 campaign, when asked what advice she gives to her husband, Melania Trump often told media outlets that she told him to stay away from tweeting things that could \u201cget him in trouble. \u201d When he arrived back at the White House on Sunday, Trump fired off a series of tweets denouncing the \u201cfake media\u201d and calling the mainstream media the \u201cenemy. \u201d He also said he thought \u201cit is very possible\u201d that the \u201cfake news\u201d mainstream media are making up their sources to harm his presidency.     \u2026    . it is very possible that those sources don\u2019t exist but are made up by fake news writers. #FakeNews is the enemy!  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 28, 2017,  It is my opinion that many of the leaks coming out of the White House are fabricated lies made up by the #FakeNews media.  \u2014   Donald J.
