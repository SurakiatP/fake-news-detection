C.  \u2014   As soon as Chris Rock strode onstage here on Monday in the first performance of his   \u201cTotal Blackout Tour,\u201d he explained why, nine years after his last   special, he\u2019s pacing stages again: \u201cThat\u2019s what alimony will do to you. \u201d Mr. Rock, who was married for 16 years,  divorced last year, and while his quip had the jackhammer snap that has long made him the best deliverer of punch lines in comedy, the old swagger faded during his     show. Now 52, Mr. Rock, looking trim in casual black pants and jacket, talked about his vanity, insecurities and failures with startling frankness. \u201cI wasn\u2019t a good husband,\u201d he said, standing still, shifting into a quieter register. \u201cI didn\u2019t listen. I wasn\u2019t kind. I cheated. \u201d Mr. Rock paused as the audience waited for the joke. It arrived eventually, but it did not match the impact of this silent, dramatic beat. In his new set, Mr. Rock appeared to be after something more than laughs. It is rare to see a celebrity discuss his infidelity with the specificity that he did here  \u2014   detailing who and how many  \u2014   but he talked about this in an anguished, searching tone that fans may find surprising. At times, Mr. Rock sounded like a man confessing his sins, turning vulnerability into his latest provocation. Ever since his breakthrough 1996 HBO special, \u201cBring the Pain\u201d  \u2014   his new set includes giant initials evoking that seminal show  \u2014   Mr. Rock has maintained a secure place in the   pantheon. But in contrast with peers like Bill Burr and Louis C. K. his specials are infrequent enough that every one is a major event. His current show will be released as a special on Netflix, part of a   $40 million deal. His last, \u201cKill the Messenger,\u201d was recorded during the 2008 election, and it\u2019s hard not to be struck by his cheerful mood then, sounding positively giddy as he pokes fun at John McCain, skewering him as a \u201cwar hero who got captured. \u201d In the recent presidential campaign, Donald J. Trump made the same point about Mr. McCain in similar language, but without the punch line. In the past nine years, the line for transgression has shifted. But Mr. Rock didn\u2019t try to adjust to it. Nor did he approach the recent election with what has become the standard alarm of many comedians. Barack Obama was the anomaly, he argued, while Mr. Trump is a return to business as usual in a conservative country always run by rich white men. \u201cI\u2019m not scared,\u201d Mr. Rock said, looking to the evils of history for comfort. \u201cI\u2019m black. The future is always better when you\u2019re black. \u201d Comedy is about surprise, and one reason Mr. Rock has been his generation\u2019s finest political   is his ability to consistently go against the grain with conviction. (Unlike some, he always seems to believe the premises of his jokes.) The rise of Mr. Trump, he concluded, taking his critique to a comic extreme, stems from our battle against bullying. \u201cWe got rid of bullies,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen a real one showed up, we didn\u2019t know what to do. \u201d He also discussed police shootings in an unexpected way, saying that he would think that law enforcement might try to shoot a white kid for once, \u201cjust for appearances. \u201d But he also spent time sympathizing with police officers, describing work that has zero room for error and draws pay that is far too low. If his current social commentary has a common thread, it\u2019s an alertness to how economics colors every issue. \u201cWhole Foods does not say \u2018No Blacks Allowed,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut a $7 orange does. That\u2019s the new Jim Crow. \u201d What stood out most about this show, however, was the personal, not the political. Mr. Rock has mostly kept the audience at a distance from his private life. He isn\u2019t the type to dwell on his demons or soul search on a podcast. So it\u2019s a surprise to see him tell jokes about the dark consequences of his addiction to pornography or the excruciating details of family court. This is not his funniest show, but it might be his most compelling, a departure even in its form. The distance between his forceful   persona and the   more thoughtful one he displays in interviews has shrunk a bit  \u2014   and his jokes are more intricate, denser. What remains firm is a lyricist\u2019s gift for concision, boiling down a thought to its comic essence. On bullying: \u201cPressure makes diamonds. Not hugs. \u201d Mr. Rock\u2019s comedy has always been happily cynical about marriage, his jokes regarding relationships rooted in regressive stereotypes about men and women. He\u2019s found many laughs in sympathy for men behaving badly, blaming Hillary Clinton for her husband\u2019s cheating and pointing out how O. J. Simpson had to pay steep alimony while his former wife slept with another man. (\u201cI\u2019m not saying he should have killed her, but I understand. \u201d) When discussing his own marriage, however, he blamed only himself, repeatedly, allowing sadness to creep into his dynamic voice. He also dug into his past, telling a story about his grandmother disparaging poor men that stuck with him for years, and another about his grandfather mocking him for crying. Mr. Rock wants to tell us where he came from, and also where he hopes to go. \u201cI\u2019m trying to get a little bit of religion,\u201d he said, before backtracking: \u201cNot a lot. \u201d He added that he believes in God, but only a bit. Onstage, Mr. Rock has always had the intonations of a preacher  \u2014   which his grandfather was  \u2014   repeating premises until they sound like incantations. But his real religion is comedy, and at the end of this discussion of his relationship with God, he contrasted the sureness of faith with the questioning nature of a comic. But as comedians go, Mr. Rock has always been one of the most forcefully confident. What\u2019s different is he now sounds more anxious. And while the election and his divorce may have added heaviness to his gait, this evolution may also stem from simply growing older. In a line he repeated over and over on Monday, Mr. Rock explained his spiritual search in the hardheaded pragmatic terms we\u2019ve come to expect from him: \u201cI want to find God before God finds me. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561751.9643934}
