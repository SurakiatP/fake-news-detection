Links to her appearance were also temporarily unavailable on the festival website, leading supporters of Ms. Shriver to complain of censorship, but festival officials said it was only a technical malfunction on their website, which was repaired later. The event, the Brisbane Writers Festival, which ended Sunday, also hurriedly organized counterprogramming, billed as a \u201cright of reply\u201d for critics of Ms. Shriver, whose speech belittled the movement against cultural appropriation. They scheduled the rebuttal opposite a session Saturday afternoon in which Ms. Shriver was promoting her new novel, \u201cThe Mandibles. \u201d Ms. Shriver had been billed as speaking on \u201ccommunity and belonging\u201d but focused on her views about cultural appropriation, a term that refers to the objections by members of minority groups to the use of their customs or culture (or even characters of their ethnicity) by artists or others who do not belong to those groups. Ms. Shriver criticized as runaway political correctness efforts to ban references to ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation from Halloween celebrations, or to prevent artists from drawing on ethnic sources for their work. Ms. Shriver, the author of 13 novels, who is best known for her 2003 book, \u201cWe Need to Talk About Kevin,\u201d was especially critical of efforts to stop novelists from cultural appropriation. She deplored critics of authors like Chris Cleave, an Englishman, for presuming to write from the point of view of a Nigerian girl in his   book \u201cLittle Bee. \u201d Ms. Shriver noted that she had been criticized for using in \u201cThe Mandibles\u201d the character of a black woman with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, who is kept on a leash by her homeless white husband. And she defended her right to depict members of minority groups in any situation, if it served her artistic purposes. \u201cOtherwise, all I could write about would be          white women from North Carolina,\u201d she said. Ms. Shriver donned a sombrero for much of her speech  \u2014   an allusion to a case in the United States in which articles of impeachment were drawn up (and later rescinded) against   student government members for doing the same during a   tequila party at Bowdoin College. To frequent laughter from the audience, Ms. Shriver warned that the    movement that began in America had already reached Britain  \u2014   where she lives most of the year  \u2014   and might be headed to Australia. Actually, it seems to have already arrived. In the middle of Ms. Shriver\u2019s speech on Thursday night, an Australian writer of Sudanese and Egyptian origin, Yassmin   got up and walked out, making live posts on Twitter about her dismay at what she described as \u201ca poisoned package wrapped up in arrogance and delivered with condescension. \u201d \u201cI have never walked out of a speech,\u201d Ms.   wrote in a post published on Medium. com and Guardian. com. But Ms. Shriver\u2019s, she added, \u201cbecame a celebration of the unfettered exploitation of the experiences of others, under the guise of fiction. \u201d The movement against cultural appropriation has grown in recent years, targeting singers like Miley Cyrus, who \u201ctwerk\u201d onstage, and white men who wear  dreadlocks. After her Brisbane speech, Ms. Shriver was accosted by a festival participant in the hallway of the State Library of Queensland, who shouted, \u201cHow dare you come to my country and offend our minorities?\u201d The author said that the woman had clearly not actually heard her speech, which made no mention of Australian minorities. The festival\u2019s director, the poet Julie Beveridge, responded to the outrage by organizing the \u201cright of reply\u201d session, inviting as speakers Ms.   as well as the   author Suki Kim, whose   book \u201cWithout You, There Is No Us,\u201d was based on her six months working undercover as an English teacher in North Korea. Ms. Kim complained that books by white male writers on North Korea were better received in some quarters than books like her own. Adam Johnson\u2019s \u201cThe Orphan Master\u2019s Son\u201d won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 2013, though Mr. Johnson did not speak Korean and had spent only three days in North Korea, Ms. Kim said. She attributed that acclaim at least partly to racism from institutions dominated by white men. \u201cThe reality is that those from marginalized groups, even today, do not get the luxury of defining their own place in a norm that is profoundly white, straight and, often, patriarchal,\u201d Ms.   said in her criticism of Ms. Shriver. Ms. Beveridge wrote on the festival\u2019s website, after links to Ms. Shriver\u2019s speech were taken down, \u201cAs a festival of writers and thinkers, we take seriously the role we play in providing a platform for meaningful exchange and debate. \u201d She could not be reached on Monday to ask why links to Ms. Shriver\u2019s speech were removed from the festival website. Links to the rebuttal remained active. Ms. Beveridge has said that the festival\u2019s keynote speech was intended to set the tone for the festival, which drew scores of authors to this eastern Australian city. \u201cLionel Shriver, by her own admission, did not speak to her brief,\u201d Ms. Beveridge said. \u201cThe views expressed during her address were hers alone. \u201d Ms. Shriver described the festival\u2019s response as \u201cnot very professional,\u201d and, at a later appearance at the festival, said she was disturbed by how many of those on the political left had become what she described as censorious and totalitarian in their treatment of artists with whom they disagreed.'"}, "time": 1742562843.5696516}
