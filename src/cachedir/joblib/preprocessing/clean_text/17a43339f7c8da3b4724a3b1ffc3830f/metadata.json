The Islamic State claimed responsibility via its Aamaq news agency.  In the interview, the widow addressed the perpetrators of the attack, saying, \u201cYou took my husband, the father of my children, but I forgive you. I ask that God forgive you as well. My husband is gone. You put my husband in a place that I didn\u2019t want him to be in and I very much want to be next to him. \u201cI\u2019ll say just one thing to you, to those who did this, those who have been led astray, think about what you\u2019re doing, think again, think about your actions. We didn\u2019t do anything to you. When I say that I forgive you, believe me, I really forgive you. \u201d Her comments were expanded upon by the program\u2019s famous presenter, Amr Adeeb, who said, \u201cThe Copts of Egypt are made of steel. For hundreds of years they\u2019ve suffered. The Egyptian Copts love their homeland immensely and they suffer for their homeland  \u2014   such power, such great tolerance and forgiveness. \u201cIf your enemies knew how tolerant and conciliatory you were, they wouldn\u2019t believe it. If my father had done this I wouldn\u2019t forgive him. These people (the Copts) are made of something else. They have tolerance that is the product of very strong belief. \u201d After the show aired, Egyptian Christians responded on social media. Reem Karsham said, \u201cIt\u2019s true that we Christians live by the teachings of Jesus Christ who commanded us to love our enemies. On Good Friday we ask our father to forgive them. We are the salt of the earth spreading love wherever we are. Our blessings to our Coptic brothers in Egypt . \u201d Another social media user, Mari Abouaita, commented, \u201cWe aren\u2019t made of something else, we\u2019re simply following the teachings of our Lord, Jesus Christ, blessed is his name. Jesus, who was crucified by no fault of his own. The crucifix that was the symbol of humiliation became the symbol of faith and the salvation after Jesus Christ. God forgive them (the attackers) for what they\u2019ve done. \u201d Gladis Odish wrote, \u201cThis is what Jesus Christ said 2000 years ago: He said, \u2018You have heard to love your loved ones and hate your enemies, but I say love your enemies. Do good to those who don\u2019t love you. Pray for those who harm you and oppress you,\u2019 and that\u2019s what every Christian says. \u201d Another commenter, Suhail Youssif, wrote, \u201cWe are not made of steel  \u2014   it\u2019s written that God took from us our heart of stone and gave us the heart of man. It\u2019s also written they were perfect as your father in heaven and they were merciful as your father in heaven.   \u2026     How great are you God, your instructions are indeed heavenly and not the instructions of the hand of man. May your name be blessed. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563964.6717498}
