Women, however, may have good reason to feel that way. Discrimination persists in the workplace and it isn\u2019t necessarily intentional or overt, experts on gender and negotiation say. But it can emerge when women act in ways that aren\u2019t considered sufficiently feminine, and when women advocate for themselves, these experts say, some people find it unseemly, if on a subconscious level. As a result, women need to take a more calibrated approach, whether in asking for a higher salary or a new position. Otherwise, they can risk being perceived as overly demanding and unlikable, experts say, and their requests can backfire. \u201cWe are asking women to juggle while they are on the tightrope,\u201d said Linda C. Babcock, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University and founder of its gender equity program. \u201cIt\u2019s totally unfair because we don\u2019t require the same thing of men. But if women want to be successful in this domain, they need to pay attention to this. \u201d Research on gender and negotiation has largely focused on requests for a raise, but the same strategies can  \u2014   and probably should  \u2014   be applied to a broad range of requests, including negotiating for a new position or job title. \u201cHow women negotiate their career paths is arguably a more important determinant of lifetime earnings than negotiating a little extra money,\u201d said Hannah Riley Bowles, a senior lecturer at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government, who has conducted many studies on gender and negotiation. Some women may bridle  \u2014   justifiably  \u2014   at adjusting their behavior to conform to stereotypes. But the negotiation experts say that they think about these strategies pragmatically. \u201cThese stereotypes will hold us back, so we might as well use them to move forward,\u201d added Joan C. Williams, a   of \u201cWhat Works for Women at Work. \u201d Here are some strategies for approaching negotiations at work: Groundwork Asking for a raise shouldn\u2019t be rushed or boiled down to one short conversation. To prepare, keep a record of every piece of positive feedback you receive over time, and catalog any objective metrics that help illustrate your contributions. This is easy to overlook when you\u2019re busy. Be careful about how you present the information  \u2014   in a performance review might be more effective instead of naked  . Women also benefit when other people highlight their accomplishments with the   experts said. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important for women to seek not only mentors, but also what some call sponsors, professionals who actively trumpet your work.   Women tend to negotiate less for themselves than men, when there aren\u2019t clear standards on what they should be asking for, studies found. In fact, women worked longer and made fewer errors but paid themselves less than men did for similar tasks, according to another study. But that effect went away when women were given data on what others paid themselves. There are several ways to gather objective numbers supporting why a particular salary is merited. \u201cThe next time a recruiter calls you up, she is your new best friend, even if you don\u2019t want to move,\u201d said Ms. Williams, also founding director of the Center for WorkLife Law at the University of California, Hastings College of Law. Or seek one out. \u201cTalk to her because she is the one who knows what you are worth on the open market. \u201d Women need to speak with men about salaries, too. If they network only with other women, experts said, they are more likely to come up with numbers that are systematically less. Specific Language When negotiating for higher pay, research has found that it is not enough for women to act in a way that conforms to stereotypes. Acting feminine enough  \u2014   that is, showing they care about maintaining good relationships as well as the communal good over themselves, for instance  \u2014   helps women in the likability department. And that\u2019s important. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily make the person in the position of power any more likely to grant a woman\u2019s request. Women also need to legitimize their requests, or find ways to make them seem more appropriate, according to a study that Prof. Riley Bowles and Prof. Babcock published in 2012. That means saying something like, \u201cMy supervisor suggested that I to talk to you about raising my compensation. \u201d Women should also frame requests from the employer\u2019s perspective. \u201cThe key thing is to turn it around and think about what it is legitimate to this person and what they value,\u201d Professor Riley Bowles added. She refers to this as the \u201c \u201d strategy: You might be thinking about something from your perspective, but when you make the pitch, it should come out as \u201cwe. \u201d This, she says, is good advice for men, too. It just may be particularly important for women. Negotiate in Person Negotiation by email can backfire. \u201cIt comes across very cold, very hard and very direct, so all of the things that women tend to do in conversation that soften their approach are impossible to do in email,\u201d Professor Babcock said. Email also requires waiting for a response. \u201cIf you are having a conversation, you can judge more accurately about how your request is going over,\u201d she added, \u201cand you can adjust your request as you see the reaction. \u201d That\u2019s what may have caused one woman to have a recent job offer rescinded, a situation that recently made the rounds in the blogosphere and media. The candidate, known only as W. was offered a position as a philosophy professor at Nazareth College in Rochester. In response, she emailed the job search committee and listed    items that would \u201cmake my decision easier. \u201d W. also said in the email that she knew some requests would be easier to grant than others, indicating that she knew she wouldn\u2019t get everything. Nazareth says it declines comment on personnel issues. In a blog post, W. said she figured asking couldn\u2019t hurt. But it apparently did: In response, the college reportedly emailed her back and said it had determined that she was more interested in teaching at a research university. \u201cIt is impossible to say in any particular case whether\u201d gender played a role, Professor Babcock said. \u201cThe research could not be more clear in that we tolerate more aggressive or assertive behavior by men more than women. \u201d Outside Offers Receiving an offer for a more lucrative position may seem like a prime opportunity to negotiate. But this tactic may harm women because it can be perceived as a threat, experts said, \u201cEvery negotiation textbook says to use an outside offer, except for mine,\u201d said Professor Babcock, who with Professor Riley Bowles, studied the effects of using outside offers in an experimental setting. \u201cThat is seen as aggressive when used by a woman. \u201d If you do want to use this strategy, she said you have to be careful about how you craft your language. Approach the situation as a dialogue instead of a negotiation. She said women might say something like, \u201cHey, there is something I really want to talk about. I want to stay. Is there a way to make this happen for me?\u201d   Keeping all this in mind isn\u2019t easy, which is why experts suggest   the situation with a friend or partner. Practice how you might present yourself to make sure your request appears appropriate and persuasive, while also demonstrating that you are concerned about communal goals. \u201cWhen you are personally inflamed or nervous,   helps to get into someone else\u2019s perspective,\u201d Professor Riley Bowles said. \u201cIt takes a lot of practice. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563163.9943244}
