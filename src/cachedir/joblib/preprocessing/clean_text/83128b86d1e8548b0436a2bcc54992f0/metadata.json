If I\u2019m not mistaken, not only is this unethical, it\u2019s illegal. Last year, the State Department tipped off the Clinton campaign that a New York Times reporter was digging into her email scandal. The State Department had claimed that they had not worked to help Clinton during the whole corrupt mess. Guess what? They lied. \\nMike Schmidt is the reporter that broke the original story on the Hildabeast using a private email account and a home brewed server. They were keeping tabs on the guy and running to the Clinton campaign to report on what he was doing so they could head it off at the pass. That\u2019s called collusion. The State Department should go under immediate review and heads should roll over this. What blatant corruption. \\nFrom The Daily Caller: \\nThe State Department tipped the Hillary Clinton campaign off last year that a New York Times reporter was asking questions about Clinton\u2019s emails. \\nThe revelation undermines the State Department\u2019s claims that it has not worked to help Clinton during the ongoing email scandal. \\n\u201cState just called to tell me that Mike Schmidt seems to have what appear to be summaries of some of the exchanges in the 300 emails the committee has,\u201d Nick Merrill wrote in a March 14, 2015 email . \\nSchmidt is the Times reporter who broke the news that Clinton used a private email account as secretary of state. The article was published on March 2, 2015. Clinton had turned more than 50,000 emails over to the State Department in Dec. 2014. The State Department then provided around 300 emails to the House Select Committee on Benghazi, which was chaired by South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy. \\nThe emails seem to indicate that Clinton\u2019s team suspected Trey Gowdy of leaking the contents of Clinton\u2019s emails to Schmidt. \u201cAgain, it appears that he does not have the email but that someone, likely from the committee, is slipping him cherry-picked characterizations of the exchanges,\u201d Merrill wrote. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard directly from Schmidt yet but will circle back when I do.\u201d Other Clinton campaign officials were not pleased with the news. In fact, they were pissed and went on a war footing over it. \\n\u201cThis is no bueno,\u201d communications director Jennifer Palmieri wrote. \u201cThis is some kind of bullshit.\u201d \u201cIf Gowdy is doing selective leaks, we are in very different kind of warfare.\u201d This exchange was of course exposed by WikiLeaks\u2026 man, the Hildabeast must really hate those guys. \\nAnd it gets even worse. Another email sent days before Schmidt published his first bombshell report on the Clinton emails, shows that Democrats on the Benghazi Committee also tipped off the Democrat\u2019s team that the reporter was snooping around. There\u2019s not a damned one of these Democrats that have any honor. Not one. \u201cTalked to [Clinton attorney Heather Samuelson] late afternoon aand [sic] told her I\u2019d heard from Dem Staff Director on Benghazi Select Comm that NYT was sniffing around, maybe to do a story on State production to Committee or on our production to State,\u201d Clinton lawyer David Kendall wrote on Feb. 28th, 2015. \\n\u201cI\u2019d gotten a call from NYT\u2019s Mike Schmidt (very young) about 2:00 pm\u2013said nothing on background or on record. I didn\u2019t feel he had anything, but. We may get a further inquiry from him over weekend.\u201d This indicates to me that these idiots had no idea how big the NYT\u2019s story would be. \\nKendall also wrote that Schmidt attempted to get him to hand over copies of Clinton\u2019s emails that had already been produced for the Benghazi Committee. \u201cHe knew that some of the HRC dox had been produced \u2014 wasn\u2019t sure if they all had been. He knew that State had asked other former SOS\u2019s for their emails but didn\u2019t know what the response was. I couldn\u2019t tell what his likely angle was (and even if he had one),\u201d Kendall wrote. \\nThis isn\u2019t the first time there has been dirty dealings between the State Department and other government agencies with Team Clinton. It surely won\u2019t be the last. Our government definitely needs an enema. Related Items Terresa Monroe-Hamilton \\nTerresa Monroe-Hamilton owns and blogs at NoisyRoom.net .
