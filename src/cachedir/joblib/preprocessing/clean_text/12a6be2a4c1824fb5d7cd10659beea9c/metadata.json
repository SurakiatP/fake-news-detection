Joy Behar commented that Trump\\'s \"rhetoric about nuclear weapons is reckless\", but when Conway tried to respond she was interrupted repeatedly and eventually called \"delusional\". The back and forth banter was more like an aggressive approach to dumb down Conway\\'s answers and of course limit any negative talk about the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, who is under intense legal scrutiny just days before election. The women also stated that they did not care if Donald Trump \"ever came back on the show\". Remains to be seen if they will say the same thing if he wins the nomination.'"}, "time": 1742563437.5682893}
