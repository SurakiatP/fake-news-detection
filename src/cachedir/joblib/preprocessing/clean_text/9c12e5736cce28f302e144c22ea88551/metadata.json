As an   female, I understand the plight for equality. However, I am severely offended by the continual comparison of a sexual preference, a gender preference, to the plight of an enslaved, raped, lynched, brutalized, oppressed people. Dare anyone compare choice of bathroom to the plight of blacks for the past 400 years? Isn\u2019t that a bit ridiculous? First of all, it\u2019s insulting to every black person in America. As blacks we were born as we are. No choice involved. Transgenders have to make a conscious choice to become a transgender. There is no comparison. People say that Christians force their beliefs on others. Well, people who take these actions and measures are forcing their beliefs on those who don\u2019t agree. There is nothing wrong with a person who prefers to use the bathroom with people of the same gender by birth. Stop making it seem like it is. That\u2019s judgmental and degrading.  \u2014   Loves\u2019 Redemption in Washington, reacting to an article about the Obama administration telling public schools to allow transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identities. 2. It\u2019s past time to admit that when it comes to upholding federal law, and even civil rights, many states have pretty much just flipped off the U. S. government, many federal rulings, and even the U. S. Constitution. It\u2019s now necessary for the U. S. government to bring the hammer down and start insisting that civil rights rulings are not optional, nor are they open to debate, overruling, or corruption by any state. Either we are a nation with universal civil rights that are enforceable or we are not. It\u2019s time to make them stick.  \u2014   GWBear in Florida. This comment received over 200 reader recommendations.  3. As I listen to Mr. Sanders speak tonight  \u2014   completely caught up in his own hubris  \u2014   I am fascinated and repulsed by his angry entitlement to the Democratic nomination. As he was shouting about momentum and that he is the best candidate  \u2014   despite the fact that three million more voters preferred Mrs. Clinton  \u2014   I feel increasingly concerned that he is a huge liability to the party he adopted for his own convenience.  \u2014   Dana in Santa Monica, Calif. reacting to an article about Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s victory in the West Virginia primary. This comment received over 1, 090 reader recommendations and 127 reader responses. 4. I am absolutely astounded at the way these analyses ignore the obvious: The Trump phenomenon is the backlash against our first black president. Come on! You go back decades dissecting American conservatism, and you somehow manage not to mention that Donald Trump headed the \u201cBirther\u201d movement, which gave racists the okay to assert that Barack Obama was not a real American  \u2014   explicitly because he was alleged (falsely) to have been born in Africa? HELLO? Are we ever going to be allowed to discuss this elephant in the living room? Are we supposed to pretend FOREVER that the origins of this outburst of hatred are totally mysterious?  \u2014   DW in Philadelphia, reacting to an article about the Republican Party\u2019s failure to unite behind its presumptive nominee, Donald J. Trump. This comment received over 1, 680 reader recommendations and 33 reader responses.  5. Keep writing away. It doesn\u2019t matter what you say, I am still going to vote for him. The more I read against him, the more I want to vote for him.  \u2014   Chris in Louisville, Ky. reacting to a post about Mr. Trump refusing to release his tax returns. 6. How many of us believe that the Olympics and every other competition actually award medals for achievement, rather than for who cheats most successfully? Of course, athletes also train. For strength and skill and endurance. But who does it without drugs? It\u2019s not just the cheating that bothers me, but the effect on young people who do it. The effect of that lifelong secrecy. The effect of knowing that their medal was gained by cheating. It\u2019s very discouraging.  \u2014   TheraP in the Midwest, reacting to an article about the former chief of Russia\u2019s antidoping lab detailing a   doping effort  in the 2014 Olympics in Sochi. 7. Great, another special interest group to pander to.  \u2014   MKM in New York, reacting to an article about Hillary Clinton vowing that as president she would unseal the government records about Area 51, reputed to contain classified information about aliens and U. F. O. s. 8. Colonialism was pretty rude too, Your Majesty.  \u2014   Viraj Vaidya on The Times\u2019s Facebook page, responding to an article about Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s criticism of a visiting Chinese delegation, which was caught on a video.  This comment received over 1, 700 likes. 9. I find it so ironic that people do these things to their body in the name of \u201cindividuality. \u201d The inked and pierced masses are the real sheep.  \u2014   Lena in Ontario, Canada, reacting to an article about body modifications like tattoos, piercings and ear gauging becoming de rigueur on fashion runways.  10. Brazil will not change. The problem with our country and economy is not the president herself, but our senators and everyone else who\u2019s been stealing, and ruining our country for their personal gain. I\u2019m sad to say that, even though I don\u2019t support Dilma and never voted for her, what\u2019s coming is much, much worse than her. I fear for the future of my country.  \u2014   Vit\u00f3ria Fernandes on The Times\u2019s Facebook page, responding to an article about impeachment proceedings against Brazil\u2019s president, Dilma Rousseff.'"}, "time": 1742628328.03081}
