According to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) exemptions cited in the documents obtained by Judicial Watch, three of the Clinton-Abedin email exchanges contained material \u201cclassified to protect national security.\u201d \\nAlso included in the newly obtained documents is an additional instance of the State Department doing special favors for a high-dollar Clinton Foundation donor. And the documents include instances of the distribution by State Department officials of Clinton\u2019s government schedule to members of the Clinton Foundation staff. \\nThe documents contain emails not previously turned over to the State Department, bringing the known total to date of such emails uncovered by Judicial Watch to 238 new Clinton emails (not part of the 55,000 pages of emails that Clinton turned over to the State Department). These records further appear to contradict statements by Clinton that, \u201c as far as she knew ,\u201d all of her government emails were turned over to the State Department. \\nThe new records include three separate Clinton-Abedin email exchanges withheld in part from Judicial Watch under the State Department\u2019s \u201cB1\u201d FOIA exemption, applying to \u201cinformation that is classified to protect national security\u201d: \\nSent: Thu Oct 08 [8:08:03] 2009 \\nSubject: Fw: Memo on latest N.I. negotiations; yr trip; from Shaun W Sid \\nCONFIDENTIAL \\nFrom: Sid \\nRe: Latest/N. Ireland \\nAfter five hours of talk at Downing Street tonight, Thursday, October 8, Shaun Woodward tells me that it seems Gordon Brown has brokered a financial package with Peter Robinson and Martin McGuinness that may in turn break the deadlock of devolution of policing and justice. They have covered the major issues in stage two in their discussions. On Monday, Brown will formally set out the details in a letter to Robinson and McGuinness. Gordon will share these with you when you meet with him on Sunday at Chequers. Shaun says that both Robinson and McGuinness, subject to some minor details, should be in a position to recommend to Unionists and Nationalists that this is a strong deal. The letter will confirm the details.

On October 13, 2009, Anaya emailed Abedin seeking to arrange a meeting between Fanjul, the CEO of Florida Crystals, and Clinton. Jiloty responded the next day, asking that Anaya talk with Clinton scheduler Lona Valmoro about \u201csetting up a meeting.\u201d Fanjul donated more than $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation and was a Bill Clinton co-chairman in Florida. \\nIn an October 26, 2009, email exchange, power attorney and Hillary Clinton financial supporter, Charlie Ann Syprett, contacted Doug Band, apparently seeking help in getting around U.S. Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) restrictions on U.S. citizens\u2019 ability to travel to Cuba. Syprett ostensibly wanted a waiver from the restrictions to enable people from her organization, SYC Charitable Foundation, to travel to Cuba, noting \u201cwe are not asking for something out of the ordinary.\u201d \\nThe emails also show that Valmoro sent Clinton\u2019s government schedule to the unsecure email addresses of numerous members of the Clinton Foundation staff on October 16, 2009, again on October 18, 2009, and on October 25, 2009. The emails also include discussions of personnel matters and appointments on Clinton\u2019s unsecure account, which may run afoul of federal privacy law. \\nThis is the thirteenth set of records produced for Judicial Watch by the State Department from the non-state.gov email accounts of Huma Abedin. The documents were produced under a court order in a May 5, 2015, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit against the State Department requiring the agency to produce \u201call emails of official State Department business received or sent by former Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin from January 1, 2009 through February 1, 2013, using a \u2018non-state\u2019.gov email address\u201d ( Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of State (No. 1:15-cv-00684)). Previous records releases documented special Clinton State Department consideration for Clinton Foundation supporters (see here , here , and here .) \\n\u201cWe\u2019ve once again uncovered classified information in Hillary Clinton\u2019s and Huma Abedin\u2019s emails,\u201d said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. \u201cIt is frankly remarkable that the FBI and Justice Department are only now investigating Abedin\u2019s connection to Clinton\u2019s mishandling of classified information.\u201d \\n###'"}, "time": 1742628435.7353845}
