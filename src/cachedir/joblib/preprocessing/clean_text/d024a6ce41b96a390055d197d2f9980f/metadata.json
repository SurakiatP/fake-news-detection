And that meant his loyal star, Matt Damon, wouldn\u2019t be returning as the covert operative for the C. I. A. who unraveled agency conspiracies while he recovered his memory. As late as 2013, Mr. Greengrass, the director of \u201cThe Bourne Supremacy\u201d and \u201cThe Bourne Ultimatum,\u201d insisted he had no desire to return to the Universal Pictures franchise inspired by the Robert Ludlum novels. \u201cI certainly didn\u2019t expect to ever come back and make another one,\u201d Mr. Greengrass said in an interview last month. Yet on July 29, Jason Bourne will return to theaters after a   sabbatical, played by Mr. Damon in a movie directed by Mr. Greengrass. The road to yes involved a fragmented political landscape, an insistent fan base and gently prodding studio executives. But the simply titled \u201cJason Bourne\u201d emerges in a moviegoing environment very different from the one the superspy found himself in in 2007. For franchise films, 2016 has been an annus horribilis. \u201cThe Huntsman: Winter\u2019s War,\u201d \u201cNeighbors 2: Sorority Rising,\u201d \u201cThe Divergent Series: Allegiant\u201d and \u201cAlice Through the Looking Glass,\u201d just to name a few, landed with a thud at the box office. The results were even worse for sequels with significant time lags since the previous film, like \u201cZoolander 2\u201d and \u201cMy Big Fat Greek Wedding 2. \u201d The creative team and studio behind \u201cJason Bourne\u201d hope their film performs more like this year\u2019s few outliers, \u201cCaptain America: Civil War\u201d and \u201cFinding Dory. \u201d But they all recognize that the calculus behind successful sequels is tricky. \u201cIt\u2019s this weird thing where you can\u2019t give them exactly the same thing, or they\u2019ll be resentful,\u201d Mr. Damon said. \u201cBut you have to give them enough of something they recognize that they feel like they\u2019re getting what they paid for. \u201d Given the Bourne franchise\u2019s rocky beginnings, its ultimate success came as a bit of a shock  \u2014   even to its star. \u201cThe first movie looked like a turkey within the business,\u201d Mr. Damon said of \u201cThe Bourne Identity. \u201d That film was delayed and over budget. But something odd happened in the summer of 2002. The movie\u2019s mix of visceral, kinetic action and contemporary political concerns felt fresh to audiences. Jason Bourne was a new kind of action hero. He didn\u2019t punctuate his pummeling of foes with   quips. And he wasn\u2019t kitted out with the latest technological marvels or a   Aston Martin he made do with found objects or whatever car he could steal. Though \u201cThe Bourne Identity\u201d performed only decently on its opening weekend  \u2014   \u201c \u201d nearly tripled its   take  \u2014   word of mouth buoyed the movie, and it ended up making more than $120 million domestically. The studio quickly set out to make more. Mr. Greengrass, coming off \u201cBloody Sunday,\u201d his dramatization of a massacre by British troops of Irish protesters in 1972, was recruited for the 2004 \u201cBourne Supremacy. \u201d Critical acclaim joined   success for \u201cSupremacy\u201d and, in 2007, \u201cThe Bourne Ultimatum,\u201d which won Oscars for film editing, sound mixing and sound editing. But Mr. Greengrass was burned out on Bourne. The films were not only grueling to make, but the original trilogy also felt of a piece, one unfolding story when watched in succession. At the end of \u201cUltimatum,\u201d Jason Bourne remembered everything about his past as a highly trained government assassin and swam off in the East River, having dispatched the corrupt agency officials who had tried to have him killed. A new film would require a new motivating set of circumstances. The studio gave Mr. Greengrass time, and he gave it a shot. But when it became clear that he couldn\u2019t find an idea that excited him, Universal Pictures  \u2014   facing a contractual deadline with the Robert Ludlum estate to produce another film  \u2014   went to Plan B. Not keen on recasting the role, the studio then released an offering from the screenwriter of the first three films, Tony Gilroy, who conjured up another black ops agent, Aaron Cross (played by Jeremy Renner) for \u201cThe Bourne Legacy. \u201d But Donna Langley, the chairwoman of Universal Pictures, never gave up hope. After all, franchise sequels are the lifeblood of today\u2019s movie business. \u201cWe were always playing the long game with the Bourne franchise,\u201d said Ms. Langley, respecting the pair\u2019s decision but believing that a compelling idea might take hold. \u201cEven though Matt and Paul had been very definitive about not wanting to come back, we weren\u2019t really willing to submit to that,\u201d she added with a laugh. In late 2013, Ms. Langley invited Mr. Damon to lunch with her new boss, Jeff Shell, a longtime television executive whom Comcast had just put in charge of Universal\u2019s filmed entertainment business. The   had but one purpose: to gently nudge a Bourne movie starring Matt Damon back on track. Mr. Damon was amenable to at least considering a return. Year after year of people coming up to him on the street, in the coffee shop, at the airport, urging him to make another Bourne film, had had its intended effect. And stumbling upon the production offices of \u201cLegacy\u201d while he was in Vancouver filming \u201cElysium\u201d a few years earlier may have contributed as well. \u201cI thought I was completely at peace with the three movies, and I was so happy with how good they were and what the whole franchise had done for my career and my life,\u201d Mr. Damon said. \u201cBut when I saw their production offices, it hurt me in a way that surprised me. \u201d Not long after his meal with the Universal executives, Mr. Damon dined with Mr. Greengrass in Los Angeles. \u201cAt a certain point, I said to Paul, \u2018People really want to see this movie, and that\u2019s not something to turn our noses up at,\u2019\u201d Mr. Damon said. \u201cHaving made movies that didn\u2019t find an audience, I didn\u2019t want to thumb our nose at this opportunity. \u201d That resonated with Mr. Greengrass. The ideas began whirring with his longtime creative partner Christopher Rouse, who had edited \u201cSupremacy\u201d and \u201cUltimatum. \u201d And a few weeks later, on a long drive back to his London home, Mr. Greengrass realized: This could actually be fun. Mr. Greengrass, a former journalist, tends to situate his films in recent,   events, whether in Iraq after the 2003 American invasion (\u201cThe Green Zone\u201d) or on a cargo ship hijacked by Somali pirates (\u201cCaptain Phillips\u201d). And the economic and political aftershocks of the 2008 financial crash that he and Mr. Rouse had been exploring for other projects  \u2014   institutions desperately trying to hold onto power amid a wave of angry populist movements  \u2014   could find fertile ground in a new \u201cBourne\u201d entry. One of the early action set pieces in \u201cJason Bourne\u201d unspools during an austerity riot in Athens. \u201cAt heart, Bourne is a patriot who\u2019s been betrayed by the institutions he believed in,\u201d Mr. Rouse said. \u201cThose are very identifiable feelings for people today. \u201d Social media had barely begun when \u201cThe Bourne Ultimatum\u201d was released: Facebook was three years old, Twitter just one. Now, it\u2019s a dominant feature of our lives, and Mr. Greengrass wanted to incorporate the     debate the rise of these companies has exacerbated. \u201cThe classic Bourne universe is one where you look at the C. I. A. with great skepticism,\u201d Mr. Greengrass said. \u201cBut I wanted to cast that skeptical eye, Bourne\u2019s skeptical eye, a bit broader. Because the truth is there are other barons in the world now. \u201d The need for a different world to confront Jason Bourne may be addressed. But a significant slice of the younger moviegoing public may have no clue about the character. And in a summer where more sequels have been rejected than embraced, the audience may view another Bourne movie as just the latest cynical studio project. Mr. Greengrass had that concern in mind when he mapped out Jason Bourne\u2019s first appearance in the film, engaging in a     fight on the   border. \u201cIt\u2019s important because it tells you that Bourne is potent, and a physical force to be reckoned with still,\u201d Mr. Greengrass said. (Mr. Damon said he had to get in the best shape of his career, which, he added ruefully, was harder to do at 45 than at 29.) \u201cBut more importantly, it\u2019s proof of our intent, that this is real for us. \u201d Every movie franchise comes with its own set of audience expectations, and the filmmakers sought to both provide what Mr. Greengrass calls \u201cthe new and the true. \u201d Younger characters are introduced. The      fight scenes are there but amped up. And Mr. Damon\u2019s Bourne once again finds himself in a possibly deadly car chase, but this time there\u2019s a SWAT truck involved. Asked if the   absence from theaters worries him or the fans beseeching him for an encore were outliers, Mr. Damon began to laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s too late now  \u2014   scared money never wins, and I would never have wanted to make the movie worrying about stuff like that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe still approached it the same way we approached them all: We made the very best movie we could. \u201d Ms. Langley at Universal doesn\u2019t betray any doubts about the new movie\u2019s prospects. There are no current plans for a sequel to \u201cThe Bourne Legacy\u201d with Mr. Renner, nor are there designs (as had once been considered) to spin off other characters in other clandestine government operations, she said. \u201cLook, here\u2019s what I think the goal is: to keep Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass doing Bourne movies till they can\u2019t do them anymore,\u201d she said. Lassoing the two men again will require more of Ms. Langley\u2019s   skills. Mr. Damon said that the franchise would need to go off in another direction and that Mr. Greengrass must be involved. Asked if he\u2019d return for another Bourne film, Mr. Greengrass began cackling. \u201cLast time I made the mistake of saying never again, which proved not to be true,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019m not going to say that. \u201d While he\u2019s been noodling with a new adaptation of \u201c1984,\u201d Mr. Greengrass has not committed to his next project. But he insisted that another Bourne movie would definitely not be it. \u201cI hope the franchise lives on, because I\u2019ve got immense affection for it,\u201d Mr. Greengrass said, but whether he\u2019ll be part of it is an open question. \u201cI\u2019m not even going to think about it for some years. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628493.373221}
