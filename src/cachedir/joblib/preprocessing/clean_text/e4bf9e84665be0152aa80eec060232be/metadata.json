Share on Twitter Print This Post \\nThe 12th woman has come forward to accuse Donald Trump of doing what he bragged about doing on the Billy Bush bus tape. \\nIn a story that sounds very familiar, former Miss Finland Ninni Laaksonen told the tabloid Ilta-Sanomat that the now Republican nominee grabbed her butt just before Trump and three other beauty pageant contests went on the air for the Late Show with David Letterman in 2006. \\n\u201cBefore the show we were photographed outside the building,\u201d Laaksonen is quoted by Haaretz . \u201cTrump stood next to me and suddenly he squeezed my butt. He really grabbed my butt. I don\u2019t think anybody saw it but I flinched and thought, \u2018What is happening?'\u201d \\nAs to the veracity of these claims, it should be noted that Laaksonen didn\u2019t seek the tabloid out. Ilta-Sanomat, the second largest paper in the country according to Wikipedia , reached out to Finnish women who had encountered Trump and that\u2019s how they discovered her story. \\nIn case you\u2019re not already grimacing, the former Miss Finland added, \u201cSomebody told me there that Trump liked me because I looked like Melania when she was younger.\u201d \\nTrump has been caught on tape saying women expire at the age of 35. Melania Trump is now 46, so she would have been \u201cexpired\u201d when this alleged groping incident took place in 2006. \\nNew York Magazine has an exhaustive list of allegations made by women against Donald Trump. \\nDonald Trump is on tape bragging about grabbing women by their \u201cp*ssy\u201d against their will, so it\u2019s not a stretch to hear that he did indeed do this to women who are also willing to come forward and face the wrath of the Trump machine. \\nWhat should be alarming is that Donald Trump is the best of the best on the Republican bench. I mean, that is supposed to be how this works, right? A group of top contenders are picked for possible nomination and the best gets it. \\nRepublicans try to say this is just locker room talk, but if then Senator Barack Obama had had a bus tape like Trump\u2019s, let alone 12 women accusing him of doing what he bragged about doing, he not only wouldn\u2019t be in office right now \u2013 he wouldn\u2019t have been a contender. Rightfully so.\""}, "time": 1742563099.389125}
