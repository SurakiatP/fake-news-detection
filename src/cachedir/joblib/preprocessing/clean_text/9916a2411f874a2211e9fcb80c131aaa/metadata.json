I\\'ll take it, millions say \"Has not been large enough to motivate people to sign up for insurance\\' Published: 1 hour ago \\n(New York Times) The architects of the Affordable Care Act thought they had a blunt instrument to force people \u2014 even young and healthy ones \u2014 to buy insurance through the law\u2019s online marketplaces: a tax penalty for those who remain uninsured. \\nIt has not worked all that well, and that is at least partly to blame for soaring premiums next year on some of the health law\u2019s insurance exchanges. \\nThe full weight of the penalty will not be felt until April, when those who have avoided buying insurance will face penalties of around $700 a person or more. But even then that might not be enough: For the young and healthy who are badly needed to make the exchanges work, it is sometimes cheaper to pay the Internal Revenue Service than an insurance company charging large premiums, with huge deductibles.'"}, "time": 1742562482.0833178}
