John Cornyn, R-Texas. \u201cI haven\u2019t met the angry, racist coffee mug personally, so I can\u2019t say it\u2019s racist or not, but I can say it\u2019s ridiculous to claim that the angry, racist coffee mug is entirely responsible for every single thing that\u2019s printed on it.\u201d \\nSources inside Trump Tower said the angry, racist coffee mug has so far fit seamlessly into the transition, and hinted that another staff announcement could come as early as tomorrow, when outgoing advisor Mike Rogers, a Republican moderate, will be replaced by a box of firecrackers. \\n '"}, "time": 1742562134.042125}
