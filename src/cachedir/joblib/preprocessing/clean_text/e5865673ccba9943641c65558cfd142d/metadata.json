One of his viewers agreed, and in that moment was born a diplomatic incident that illustrates the unusual approach that President Trump takes to foreign policy, as well as the influence that television can have on his thinking. After watching the program, Mr. Trump threw a line into a speech the next day suggesting that a terrorist attack had occurred in Sweden the night before. Just like that, without white papers, intelligence reports, an interagency meeting or, presumably, the advice of his secretary of state, the president started a dispute with a longtime American friend that resented his characterization and called it false. The president\u2019s only discernible goal was to make the case domestically for his plans to restrict entry to the United States. The Swedes were flabbergasted. \u201cWe are used to seeing the president of the U. S. as one of the most   persons in the world, also well aware of the importance of what he says,\u201d Carl Bildt, a former prime minister of Sweden, said by email on Monday. \u201cAnd then, suddenly, we see him engaging in misinformation and slander against a truly friendly country, obviously relying on sources of a quality that at best could be described as dubious. \u201d While aides sought to clarify that Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks were about a rising tide of crime in general, rather than any particular event or attack, the president chose to escalate. In a Twitter post on Monday, he accused American journalists of glossing over a dark and dangerous situation in Sweden. \u201cGive the public a break,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe FAKE NEWS media is trying to say that large scale immigration in Sweden is working out just beautifully. NOT!\u201d Sweden\u2019s prime minister, Stefan Lofven, responded hours later at a news conference, noting that Sweden ranks highly on international comparisons of economic competitiveness and human development. \u201cWe have challenges, no doubt about that,\u201d he allowed. But he added pointedly, \u201cWe must all take responsibility for using facts correctly and for verifying anything we spread. \u201d Sweden is hardly the first American friend to find itself uncomfortably at odds with the new president. Mexico\u2019s president canceled a meeting with Mr. Trump over his plans to build a border wall and bill the United States\u2019 southern neighbor for it. Mr. Trump reportedly lit into Australia\u2019s prime minister over refugees in a telephone call that was said to have ended abruptly. But the episode underscored that Mr. Trump obtains, processes and uses information differently from any modern president. He watches television at night and tends to incorporate what he sees into his Twitter feed, speeches and interviews. \u201cIt begs the question of where the president gets his information as he articulates his administration\u2019s global approach,\u201d said Mark Brzezinski, the ambassador to Sweden under President Barack Obama. \u201cTo do so in an improvisational way, based on snippets picked up from cable news, is a major mistake. \u201d Immigration is a hotly debated issue in Sweden, Germany and many other European countries. Sweden, which prides itself as a humanitarian leader, processed a record 163, 000 asylum applications in 2015. But statistics in Sweden do not back up the suggestion that immigrants have created a major crime wave. Preliminary data released last month by Sweden\u2019s crime prevention council found no significant increase in crimes from 2015 to 2016, even with the influx of migrants. The council did note an increase in assaults and rapes last year, but it also recorded a drop in thefts and drug offenses. Still, a Pew Research Center survey last year found that 46 percent of Swedes said refugees were more to blame for crime than other groups. Manne Gerell, a doctoral student in criminology at Malmo University in Sweden, said in an interview that immigrants were disproportionately represented among crime suspects, particularly in more serious and violent offenses. But he noted that many of the victims were other immigrants, whether members of criminal networks or simply residents of poor neighborhoods. \u201cImmigration will come with some cost, and we will likely have a bit more crime  \u2014   but that\u2019s in a society with low crime rates and in a society that works really well, so in my opinion, it\u2019s something we can live with,\u201d he said. \u201cI know everybody won\u2019t agree with that. But immigration will not double the crime rate, make everybody go broke or turn Sweden into a living hell. \u201d Although terrorism is a concern for Sweden  \u2014   an   Swede blew himself up in central Stockholm in 2010  \u2014   the authorities say they are equally worried about racist hate crimes, including attacks on migrants. The Fox News segment featured an interview with Mr. Horowitz, whose short film, \u201cStockholm Syndrome,\u201d depicted Sweden as a place where rape and violence have been on the rise since it began accepting more refugees from Muslim countries. In the Fox interview, Mr. Horowitz acknowledged that most Swedes do not see the situation as he does. \u201cThey\u2019ll make excuses for it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe majority of the population in Sweden still wants to have an   policy. It\u2019s confounding. \u201d Mr. Trump was clearly struck by the interview, and he cited Sweden at a rally in Melbourne, Fla. on Saturday as he argued for stronger borders. \u201cYou look at what\u2019s happening last night in Sweden,\u201d he said. \u201cSweden! Who would believe this? Sweden. They took in large numbers. They\u2019re having problems like they never thought possible. \u201d Aides later said \u201clast night\u201d referred to the Fox program, not to an episode the night before. Mr. Carlson argued on Monday that although \u201cthe president ought to be precise in what he says, there should be no confusion about what he means. \u201d Mr. Carlson said that assimilation had failed and that immigration was \u201cin the process of totally changing these ancient cultures into something different and much more volatile and much more threatening. \u201d Critics of Sweden\u2019s migration policies have pointed to a Facebook post on Feb. 3 by a police officer, Peter Springare, who said that migrants were taxing Sweden\u2019s pension, education and health systems and that they were the principal culprits in assaults. \u201cHalf of the suspects we cannot even be sure of because they don\u2019t have any valid papers,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMost often this means they are lying about their country of origin and identity. \u201d But the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter on Monday quoted two police officers interviewed by Mr. Horowitz, Anders Goranzon and Jacob Ekstrom, as saying that the filmmaker had selectively edited and distorted their comments to prove his thesis. They said that Mr. Horowitz had asked them about   neighborhoods and that they did not agree with his argument about links between migration and crime. \u201cWe don\u2019t stand behind what he says,\u201d Mr. Goranzon said. \u201cHe is a madman. \u201d Mr. Horowitz did not respond to a request for comment, but he went back on Mr. Carlson\u2019s show on Monday night to defend his work, citing crime statistics and asserting that the police officers had recanted because they were under pressure. \u201cMy record stands for itself,\u201d he said, \u201cand what you saw on that video clear as day stands for itself. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564238.8601062}
