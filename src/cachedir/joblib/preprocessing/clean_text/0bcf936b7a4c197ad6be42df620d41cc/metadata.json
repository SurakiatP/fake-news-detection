This is the kind of industry that might invest heavily into robots and research and development, but when it comes to managing their supply chain and accounts receivable, their IT infrastructure was frozen in amber circa 1974. \\nThe pay was fine, but the work was frustrating. Things like \u201cCode reviews\u201d and \u201crefactoring\u201d were viewed as \u201cwastes of time\u201d or \u201cdevelopers playing with toys\u201d. Unit tests were a luxury for \u201clazy\u201d developers- good developers should just be writing code that works. If the work you\u2019re doing isn\u2019t directly involved in getting cars built and shipped, you shouldn\u2019t be doing it. \\nEd was looking to get out of the company, and while he kept sending out resumes, he found more excuses to get away from his desk by taking smoke breaks with Mitchell. Mitchell was a lifer- he joined the company back when pensions were a thing, and was close enough to retirement that he just needed to keep his head down and stay the course to check out with a nice nest-egg. \u201cBut you,\u201d he\u2019d tell Ed, \u201cyou\u2019ve gotta get out of here. You\u2019re young. You shouldn\u2019t be wasting your time here.\u201d \\nAfter one of those smoke breaks, Ed returned to his desk to see Pilar waiting for him. Pilar was their summer intern, a junior in college. She mostly handled \u201cmanual reporting\u201d, which was a euphemism for \u201cwe don\u2019t actually have a reporting system for this data set, so we have an intern run SQL queries against production and then copy/paste the results into a spreadsheet.\u201d Yes, there were still manual reports because none of the SBUs wanted to pay to automate them. \\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a new report,\u201d she said, \u201cand it\u2019s on something called SCORDBE? You wouldn\u2019t know how I get access, would you?\u201d \\nEd didn\u2019t know. At best, he might have seen the acronym someplace on a PowerPoint during a quarterly meeting once. \u201cNo, but has anyone shown you the Internal Apps Sheet?\u201d He was referencing a spreadsheet used to track support contacts for different applications. He CTRL+F-ed to the entry for SCORDBE. \u201cOh, no\u2026\u201d \\nThe SCORDBE database was administered by Yev \u201cTicket-Nazi\u201d Kassem. He automatically closed any tickets for changing the database- even for production releases. Any ticket requesting access to the database, for any reason, received a simple reply: \u201cNO ACCOUNT FOR YOU.\u201d He used IP whitelists to prevent connections from unapproved devices. While it probably was good for security, that was an afterthought. Yev had a small bit of power, and he wanted to make sure that he held onto it. \\nStill, that was just the database side. There was an application on top of that database. He scrolled across the spreadsheet, past the cloumns for \u201cApproving Manager\u201d, \u201cSBU Contact\u201d, \u201cSBU Backup Contact\u201d, \u201cSBU Backup Bakcup Contact\u201d and found \u201cIT Development Contact\u201d. It was Mitchell. \\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll get very far with the database,\u201d Ed said. \u201cBut maybe Mitchell can help?\u201d \\nPilar went off to visit Mitchell, and Ed got back to his regular work. A half hour later, Mitchell CCed him on an email to Pilar. \u201cI\u2019ve got a solution. Just visit this URL and it\u2019ll run your query. And you can change the id=\u2026 part at the end to do it for other part numbers.\u201d \\nEd didn\u2019t think much about it until his next smoke break. \u201cSo,\u201d he said, \u201chow\u2019d you get past the Ticket-Nazi?\u201d \\nMitchell laughed. \u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d He paused and lit his cigarette, taking a few drags before explaining. \u201cSCORDBE is about 35,000 lines of Perl written back in the 90s. Nobody ever wants to touch this code, and nobody really understands what it does. I figured there had to be some poorly escaped queries, so I just grepped until I found one. Now we can run ad-hoc queries as needed.\u201d \\nEd left the company a short time later. Mitchell, and his injection-based reporting solution, however, are still there.
