[Asra Q. Nomani, a former reporter for The Wall Street Journal and professor at Georgetown University, has received online harassment after penning an   for The Washington Post about supporting Donald Trump.  This is my confession  \u2014   and explanation: I  \u2014   a    a Muslim, an immigrant woman \u201cof color\u201d  \u2014   am one of those silent voters for Donald Trump. And I\u2019m not a \u201cbigot,\u201d \u201cracist,\u201d \u201cchauvinist\u201d or \u201cwhite supremacist,\u201d as Trump voters are being called, nor part of some \u201cwhitelash. \u201d Georgetown Professor Christine Fair took to social media to condemn Nomani\u2019s   suggesting that Nomani was helping to \u201cnormalize Nazis in DC. \u201d \u201cWhy? Like many women, I have PTSD from sex assault. YOU publicly voted for a sex assailant,\u201d Fair exclaimed. As a result of Fair\u2019s behavior, Nomani made public a formal complaint she filed with Georgetown in which she requested that \u201cFair receive training regarding how to engage in civil discourse in a way that is respectful and productive. \u201d In addition, Nomani asked Fair for \u201ca public apology. \u201d \u201cWhat don\u2019t you understand, you clueless dolt?\u201d Fair wrote, saying Nomani \u201chelped bring this hell 2 [sic] our country. His hate is on your   shoulders. Was it worth it? Don\u2019t forget 2 [sic] register. \u201d \u201cI have been opposed to the decision by President Obama and the Democratic Party to tap dance around the \u2018Islam\u2019 in Islamic State,\u201d Nomani added, much to the ire of her former Georgetown colleague, who exclaimed that she has \u201cwritten [Nomani] off as a human being. \u201d After Fair attempted to claim that Nomani was an atheist rather than a Muslim, Nomani suggested that it\u2019s not uncommon that someone tries to suggest she isn\u2019t a true Muslim. She told the online conservative campus watchdog site Campus Reform that   who stray from the progressive orthodoxy \u201chear all sorts of charges of not being Muslim from the extremists within our community. \u201d \u201cThey always want to out us and throw us out of the religion and declare us apostates so we have no credibility and so there is a target on our back. So for Christine Fair, a white liberal   atheist to call me out as an atheist is not only dangerous but offensive,\u201d Nomani said, adding that she does not think that \u201canyone should be in the position of educating others and be so abusive. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563645.9922378}
