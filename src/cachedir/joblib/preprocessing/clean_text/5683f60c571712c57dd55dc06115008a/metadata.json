Mr. Obama delivered a stinging rebuke of those who would build walls, a message aimed at foreign leaders who he said had fueled rising nationalism, sectarian hatred and economic inequality  \u2014   but, unmistakably, at Donald J. Trump, as well. \u201cA nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself,\u201d Mr. Obama said of the protectionist impulse to resist the forces of global integration. At another point, he declared to the packed chamber in New York, \u201cthe world is too small for us to simply be able to build a wall\u201d to keep out extremists. Lest anyone miss the point, he said of the spreading Zika virus, \u201cmosquitoes don\u2019t respect walls. \u201d Mr. Obama has addressed the disruptive forces of globalism before, in speeches at Stanford University and before the Canadian Parliament. But this time, with his days in office ticking down, his legacy up for grabs and the global picture more unsettled than ever, there was a darker tone and a deeper urgency to his plea for international order. \u201cAt this moment, we all face a choice,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cWe can choose to press forward with a better model of cooperation and integration, or we can retreat into a world sharply divided and ultimately in conflict along   lines of nation and tribe and race and religion. \u201d That choice, Mr. Obama implied, was as sharply drawn in the race between Mr. Trump and the president\u2019s preferred candidate, Hillary Clinton, as it was in the grinding sectarian war in Syria, the predations of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and the   of China. Mr. Obama spoke of a \u201ccrude populism\u201d driving politics in the United States and Europe that fed on \u201cuncertainty and unease and strife\u201d around the world. Mr. Obama\u2019s words underscored the distance he has traveled from the hopeful leader who first addressed the General Assembly on Sept. 23, 2009. On that day, he pledged to forswear the unilateralism of his predecessor, George W. Bush, heralded a new era for the United States\u2019 relationship with the Muslim world and promised to revive peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. On Tuesday, he dismissed the   peace process with a single sentence  \u2014   not a fervent call for a   solution but the perfunctory observation that both sides would \u201cbe better off if Palestinians reject incitement and recognize the legitimacy of Israel, but Israel recognizes that it cannot permanently occupy and settle Palestinian land. \u201d Even more telling was Mr. Obama\u2019s reference to Syria. On a morning when his secretary of state, John Kerry, was struggling to salvage a fragile   agreement there after a deadly airstrike on an aid convoy  \u2014   which American officials said later in the day was probably carried out by Russian aircraft  \u2014   the president said, \u201cwe have to be honest about the nature of these conflicts. \u201d No outside actor, he said, will ever be able to force people from different religious or ethnic groups to coexist peacefully. \u201cIn a place like Syria, where there\u2019s no ultimate military victory to be won,\u201d Mr. Obama said, \u201cwe\u2019re going have to pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence and deliver aid to those in need and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect. \u201d There are a couple of explanations for Mr. Obama\u2019s circumspect tone. The obvious one is that he has only four months left in office, which means that intractable problems like Syria are not going to be fixed on his watch. Mr. Obama also finds himself in a political bind: He does not want to saddle Mrs. Clinton with policies that could backfire with voters, like a new plan to push Israel and the Palestinians back to the bargaining table. Mr. Obama was reticent even about his diplomatic achievements. The nuclear agreement with Iran, for example, consumed him and Mr. Kerry for months, requiring a titanic battle against opponents on Capitol Hill and months of diplomatic repair work with allies in the Persian Gulf. Yet on Tuesday Mr. Obama described the deal\u2019s benefits in the blandest terms, saying that it \u201cenhances global security and enhances Iran\u2019s ability to work with other nations. \u201d He coupled this unenthusiastic boast with a warning about another major proliferation threat, North Korea, which recently tested another bomb. Whatever its   risks and payoffs, the Iran nuclear deal remains a source of political static in the United States. To the extent that Mrs. Clinton refers to it on the campaign trail, which is not often, she mostly promotes her credentials to police Tehran aggressively. For his part, Mr. Obama saved his activism for what would otherwise be a less controversial issue: the plight of refugees. He led a meeting of fellow leaders to nail down commitments from countries to take in more displaced people, and to spend more to integrate them. But even here, in an election year in which fears of terrorism loom large, the constraints on Mr. Obama were clear. In noting that the United States had agreed to admit 110, 000 refugees in 2017, up from 85, 000 this year, he said that \u201crefugees are subject to more vigorous screening than the average tourist. \u201d Mr. Obama\u2019s annual speeches to the United Nations are a good way to track the evolution of his foreign policy. The soaring ambition of 2009 gave way to a more restrained tone in 2013, when Mr. Obama acknowledged the limits of American military force. A year later, however, the president struck a more hawkish tone, trying to enlist the world in the fight against the Islamic State and promising to resist Mr. Putin\u2019s aggression in Central Europe with sanctions  \u2014   and force, if necessary. Russia, Mr. Obama said on Tuesday, remains a threat to the international order. \u201cIn a world that left the age of empire behind,\u201d he said, \u201cwe see Russia attempting to recover lost glory through force. \u201d But he left to his successor how best to resist that. And though Mr. Obama reiterated the need for a \u201cunited and relentless\u201d effort to destroy the Islamic State, he lamented that \u201cthe   of sectarianism and extremism and bloodletting and retribution that has been taking place will not be quickly reversed. \u201d As he exits the world stage, Mr. Obama sometimes seems less determined to change the world than to come to terms with it.'"}, "time": 1742628572.1074631}
