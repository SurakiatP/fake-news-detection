The ban is intended both to curb the flow of counterfeit money and to take aim at terrorist organizations that rely on   cash. It is also expected to help the government clean up a system that has relied on cash to pay bribes and to avoid taxes. But the announcement, made on national television in both Hindi and English, led to an immediate upheaval in the country. Abolishing the current version of the 500 and 1, 000 rupee notes, worth about $8 and $15, will effectively remove 80 percent of the currency in circulation. Mr. Modi said banks would be closed on Wednesday. After that, people can exchange the banned notes through the end of the year for those of smaller denominations or new bills that are being created. A. T. M.s around the country were overrun Tuesday night with people confused about the plan and trying to complete financial transactions before the machines closed the following day. In some places, hundreds stood in line in front of a single A. T. M. Cash is so prevalent in Indian society that the ban came with a   exception for paying for hospital bills and airline tickets. India\u2019s   carrier, IndiGo Airlines, sent an email warning customers that banned notes could not be used to purchase   services or to pay excess baggage charges. The decision amounted to a \u201csurgical strike\u201d on the country\u2019s vast amount of   cash, said Manish Kejriwal, founder of Kedaara Capital Advisors, a Mumbai private equity firm, using a military term. \u201cThis is Modi\u2019s transformational reform,\u201d said Deepak Parekh, chairman of Housing Development Finance Corporation, one of India\u2019s largest mortgage lenders. \u201cIt will be disruptive, it will be inconvenient, but in the medium term, it will be very good. \u201d Mr. Modi was elected in 2014 after running on an anticorruption platform that included a pledge to fight   cash, also referred to as \u201cblack money. \u201d The results have been mixed. Under one tax amnesty program, Indians owned up this year to about $10 billion in income on which taxes had not been paid, the Modi administration said last month. But another effort encouraging people to declare hidden assets and income abroad met with limited success. \u201cThere\u2019s a perception that whatever he has done on the corruption front is not enough,\u201d said Harsh Pant, a professor of international relations at King\u2019s College London, noting that elections in India\u2019s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, were expected to take place early next year. \u201cPolitically he probably felt he needed to do something more visible. \u201d While the currency plan had been under discussion for some time, few had expected such a bold step. Mr. Modi kept the decision quiet to prevent holders of vast amounts of   cash from outwitting the ban. The problems run deep. Global Financial Integrity, a Washington think tank, has estimated that India lost $344 billion in illicit outflows of money in the decade leading up to 2011. But it is unclear what the full impact of the ban will be. Studies have shown that corruption can be curtailed by reducing cash transactions, but it is unlikely to be eliminated by the move. \u201cIt is regrettable this will inconvenience\u201d 1. 29 billion people, said Pradip Shah, the founder and former managing director of Credit Rating Information Services of India Limited, one of India\u2019s first   agencies, without stopping \u201cthe flow of black money. \u201d Even so, the ban on large bills is very likely to hasten India\u2019s transition away from cash. About 78 percent of transactions in India last year were made in cash, compared with 20 percent to 25 percent in the United States, Britain and other countries, according to a report by Google India and the Boston Consulting Group. The new policy puts India at the \u201cleading edge of countries restricting the use of   currency notes that are now seen as mostly fueling illegal activities rather than legitimate commerce,\u201d said Eswar S. Prasad, a trade policy professor at Cornell. As the ban works its way through the system, the real estate market could face a shock. Indian politicians, among others, not only hold vast amounts of cash, but they are also heavily invested in real estate, where it has historically been easy to convert   money into legal currency. A large percentage of real estate deals are done in unaccounted for cash. Without that cash, real estate prices could fall sharply. And developers holding large amounts of unaccounted for cash would find it suddenly rendered virtually useless, making it hard for them to pay their bills and finish their projects. \u201cCan you imagine what\u2019s going happen in real estate tomorrow?\u201d said Mr. Kejriwal, who also anticipated a drop in the prices of gold and luxury items. The exchange process, too, could prove problematic. For the next two weeks, people will be able to exchange only 4, 000 rupees a day, or about $60. People holding vast sums of unaccounted for cash will find it hard to exchange the money at banks because they will need to explain where they got it, risking tax investigations, experts said. \u201cIf I walk in with two crores,\u201d Mr. Kejriwal said, using the Indian term for 20 million rupees, or about $300, 000, \u201cpeople will be worried that the government will be tracking my name and address. \u201d \u201cPeople will be scared,\u201d he added. Mr. Modi, in his speech, addressed the inconveniences the public would most likely experience in the coming days. \u201cBrothers and sisters, in spite of all these efforts, there may be temporary hardships to be faced by honest citizens,\u201d he said. \u201cExperience tells us that ordinary citizens are always ready to make the sacrifices and face difficulties for the benefit of the nation. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564359.7618153}
