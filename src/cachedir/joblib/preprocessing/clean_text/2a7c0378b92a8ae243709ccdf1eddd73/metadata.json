Yet there is no record of anyone commemorating the first anniversary of the Battle of Hastings in 1067, nor the 100th anniversary in 1166. \\nIt has gradually crept up on us though. At first, only significant anniversaries were recognised, numbers like 25, 50 or 100; but gradually it has spread to any year ending in \u20180\u2019 or can easily be fitted onto a badge. If we don\u2019t stop the trend then before long every year will be an anniversary of something that happened before. \\nSaid one currency trader: \u2018We can make \u00a31 Billion in a second, so if we\u2019re forced to remain silent for a minute you can see how this costs the economy\u2019. He declined to explain his hypothesis further, saying that it was his birthday today and he was off to the pub for an extended lunch, but would be available for further comment after 4pm.'"}, "time": 1742563122.7746096}
