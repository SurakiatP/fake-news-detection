According to new genetic modelling, the species is unlikely to be Neanderthal or Denisovan \u2013 two ancient species that are represented in the fossil record \u2013 but could represent a third, unknown human relative that has so far eluded archaeologists. \\n\u201cWe\u2019re missing a population, or we\u2019re misunderstanding something about the relationships,\u201d Ryan Bohlender, a statistical geneticist from the University of Texas, told Tina Hesman Saey at Science News. Bohlender and his team have been investigating the percentages of extinct hominid DNA that modern humans still carry today, and say they\u2019ve found discrepancies in previous analyses that suggest our mingling with Neanderthals and Denisovans isn\u2019t the whole story. \\nIt\u2019s thought that between 100,000 and 60,000 years ago, our early ancestors migrated out of Africa, and first made contact with other hominid species living on the Eurasian landmass. This contact left a mark on our species that can still be found today, with Europeans and Asians carrying distinct genetic variants of Neanderthal DNA in their own genomes. And that\u2019s not all they\u2019ve given us. \\nEarlier this year, researchers investigated certain genetic variants that people of European descent inherited from Neanderthals , and found that they\u2019re associated with several health problems, including a slightly increased risk of depression, heart attack, and a number of skin disorders. And a separate study published earlier this month found evidence that modern genital warts \u2013 otherwise known as the human papillomavirus (HPV) \u2013 were sexually transmitted to Homo sapiens after our ancestors slept with Neanderthals and Denisovans once they left Africa. \\nWhile our relationship with Neanderthals has been widely researched, how we interacted with the Denisovans \u2013 the distant cousins of Neanderthals \u2013 is less clear. The problem is that Neanderthals are well represented in the fossil record, with many remains having been uncovered across Europe and Asia, but all we have of the Denisovans is a lone finger bone and a couple of teeth that were found in a Siberian cave in 2008 . \\nUsing a new computer model to figure out the amount of Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA carried by modern humans, Bohlender and his colleague found that Europeans and Chinese people carry a similar amount of Neanderthal DNA: about 2.8 percent. That result is pretty similar to previous studies have estimated that Europeans and Asians carry, on average, between 1.5 and 4 percent Neanderthal DNA. \\nBut when they got to Denisovan DNA, things were a bit more complicated, particularly when it came to modern populations living in Melanesia \u2013 a region of the South Pacific that includes Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, New Caledonia, West Papua, and the Maluku Islands. \\nAs Hesman Saey explains for Science News: \\n\u201cEuropeans have no hint of Denisovan ancestry, and people in China have a tiny amount \u2013 0.1 percent, according to Bohlender\u2019s calculations. But 2.74 percent of the DNA in people in Papua New Guinea comes from Neanderthals. And Bohlender estimates the amount of Denisovan DNA in Melanesians is about 1.11 percent, not the 3 to 6 percent estimated by other researchers. \\nWhile investigating the Denisovan discrepancy, Bohlender and colleagues came to the conclusion that a third group of hominids may have bred with the ancestors of Melanesians.\u201d \\n\u201cHuman history is a lot more complicated than we thought it was,\u201d he told her. \\nThis find is supported by a separate study by researchers from the Natural History Museum of Denmark, who analysed DNA from 83 Aboriginal Australians and 25 locals from the Papua New Guinea highlands. \\nAs we reported last month, this was the most comprehensive genetic study of Indigenous Australians to date, and it indicated that they are the oldest continuous civilisation on Earth, dating back more than 50,000 years ago. But the results revealed something else \u2013 DNA that was very similar to that of the Denisovans, but distinct enough for the researchers to suggest that it could have come from a third, unidentified hominid . \u201cWho this group is we don\u2019t know,\u201d lead researcher Eske Willerslev told Hesman Saey. \\nUntil we have more concrete evidence of this hypothesised third human species (some fossils would be nice), we can\u2019t prove this , and we should point out that Bohlender\u2019s estimates have yet to be formally peer-reviewed , so they might shift with further scrutiny. And it could be that our identification of Denisovan DNA is more ambiguous than we think, given that our only source is a finger bone and a couple of teeth. \\nBut the evidence is mounting that our interactions with ancient humans were far more complex than we\u2019d assumed, which shouldn\u2019t be much of a surprise, when you think about it. Just because we don\u2019t see them in the fossil record doesn\u2019t mean they didn\u2019t exist \u2013 preserving the remains of something for tens of thousands of years isn\u2019t easy, and then someone has to be in the right place at the right time to dig them up. \\nHopefully, the more we investigate the genetic make-up of our most ancient societies, the more hints we\u2019ll get of the rich and complicated history our species shared with those that didn\u2019t make it to modern times. \\nThe results of Bohlender\u2019s analysis were presented last week at the 2016 American Society of Human Genetics meeting in Canada. \u00a9 Guido Amrein Switzerland/Shutterstock Melanesian children of Papua New Guinea Share:'"}, "time": 1742563161.0892572}
