Unfortunately for the organization, Wikileaks promptly noticed the omission.\\nIn a post on Facebook , the WikiLeaks official page said, \u201c Al Jazeera\u2019s list of juiciest Wikileaks forgets to mention the revelation that Qatar funds both ISIS & Bill Clinton. \u201d\\nOn Twitter, the convenient lapse wasn\u2019t forgiven. Promptly after WikiLeaks pointed out the omission, users began pressuring Al Jazeera to explain why the publication failed to link Qatar to ISIS and Clinton.'"}, "time": 1742628409.9766614}
