[\u201cI think if you looked ten years ago, and you asked the question, \u2018Will Planned Parenthood be defunded in the next decade?\u2019 everyone would have said, \u2018No,\u2019\u201d Susan B. Anthony List (SBA List) President Marjorie Dannenfelser tells Breitbart News. \u201cBut the presidency of Donald Trump and the vice presidency of Mike Pence have changed all that. \u201d  The   base of the Republican Party saw the beginnings of change from the start of Trump\u2019s presidency. Within days of his inauguration, Trump signed an executive order that reinstated the Mexico City Policy, a rule that bans   organizations (NGOs) receiving U. S. funds  \u2014   including International Planned Parenthood  \u2014   from providing or promoting abortions overseas. The administration, however, not only reinstated the policy  \u2014   which other Republican presidents have done  \u2014   but also updated it by directing the secretary of state to expand it across all global health assistance funding, a move that ensures taxpayer funds will not support organizations that promote or participate in the management of a coercive abortion program. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) for example, is one such organization, with its long history of supporting China\u2019s   population control program, an agenda that has included forced abortions. Later in January, Trump tweeted his personal support for the March for Life  \u2014   the world\u2019s largest   demonstration  \u2014   which convenes in Washington, DC, each year on the anniversary of the Supreme Court\u2019s Roe v. Wade decision: The #MarchForLife is so important. To all of you marching  \u2014   you have my full support!  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 27, 2017,    activists, however, had even more reason to rejoice when Pence, a champion of the movement, became the first vice president to address the March for Life. The vice president will also serve as the keynote speaker of SBA List\u2019s 10th annual gala on May 3. It was Dannenfelser who led the coalition that met with Trump and Pence during the campaign to outline a   agenda for a Trump administration, which included four policy commitments in a letter to   leaders: Trump has already started on the path to fulfilling his promise to nominate   justices to the Supreme Court. National   leaders hailed the newly confirmed Justice Neil Gorsuch as \u201creminiscent\u201d of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, who regularly applied an originalist approach to the Constitution. The nomination led some   leaders to praise Trump as a \u201cman of his word. \u201d Dannenfelser explains that much has changed in the   movement within the past decade because the \u201chorrendous underbelly\u201d of Planned Parenthood has been exposed. \u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t exposed for decades,\u201d she says. \u201cThey were the Teflon organization no one could touch them. President George H. W. Bush was part of the reason for the original funding of Planned Parenthood. \u201d The national   leader says Planned Parenthood  \u2014   the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider  \u2014   had for decades been likened to \u201cthe Red Cross\u201d or a \u201cnurses\u2019 organization administering to suffering people. \u201d \u201cNobody wanted to touch that,\u201d she explains. \u201cSo, clearly, there has been a turn in the understanding of what this organization is about. It took a lot of brave people who were willing to be slandered to question that. \u201d Recently, for example, California prosecutors charged the Center for Medical Progress video makers  \u2014   who recorded Planned Parenthood officials allegedly selling the harvested body parts of aborted babies for a profit  \u2014   with 15 felonies. The charges continue a long string of attacks by the abortion giant and its political and media allies against activists exposing its operations. The Trump administration reportedly unofficially informed Planned Parenthood it would have to cease performing abortions to keep its taxpayer funding. House Republican leaders  \u2014   with support from the Trump administration  \u2014   put forward the American Health Care Act (AHCA) legislation that contained a provision to defund Planned Parenthood for a   period. Though conservatives were successful in thwarting the bill because it failed to fully repeal Obamacare, Trump would likely have signed it if Congress had passed it, ending Planned Parenthood\u2019s funding for a year.   leaders now hope Congress will put forward a single reconciliation bill to defund Planned Parenthood. Two weeks ago, Trump also signed a resolution that overturns former President Barack Obama\u2019s rule that forced states to provide family planning grants under Title X to Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers. The measure passed the House but required Pence as vice president to break the tie vote in the Senate due to the votes against it by Sens. Susan Collins ( ) and Lisa Murkowski ( ). Trump, formerly   acknowledges he has adopted the   view. Some concerns have arisen, however, about the influence his daughter Ivanka  \u2014   an apparent supporter of Planned Parenthood  \u2014   would have on the president\u2019s   agenda. Several weeks ago, a report surfaced that Ivanka held an \u201c  \u201d meeting with Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards to discuss possible \u201ccommon ground\u201d on the abortion issue. Asked whether she views Ivanka\u2019s perhaps more conciliatory tone toward Planned Parenthood as a threat to the future of the   agenda, Dannenfelser quickly dismisses the idea. \u201cI really do think this president understands what it is about  \u2014   his commitments, his promises. And he\u2019s got a vice president who knows how to lead the way legislatively,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not concerned. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563195.5413487}
