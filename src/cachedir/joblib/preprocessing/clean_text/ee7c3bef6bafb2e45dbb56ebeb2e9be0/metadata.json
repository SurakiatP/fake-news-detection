About 20 to 30 masked men threw stones and other objects at police officers in the suburb, Rinkeby, after the police arrested a man on suspicion of dealing drugs. A police officer fired at the perpetrators but did not strike anyone, and the disturbances continued for several more hours, stretching into early Tuesday morning. A photojournalist was injured in the clashes. (The police initially classified the gunshot as a warning shot.) The episode drew scrutiny worldwide because of Mr. Trump\u2019s assertions  \u2014   based on a Fox News segment  \u2014   that Sweden had experienced a surge in crime and violence as a result of taking in large numbers of refugees. Mr. Trump\u2019s comments were greeted with anger in Sweden, the latest example of strong criticism by the American president antagonizing friendly countries, including neighbors like Mexico and allies like Australia and the European Union. Swedish officials criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s statements about crime in the country as exaggerations. Preliminary statistics do not show a major increase in crime from 2015, when the country processed a record 163, 000 asylum applications, to 2016. Disturbances like the one in Rinkeby, officials said, are not unprecedented but are infrequent. In 2013, the police shooting of a man wielding a knife led to nights of violence in the suburbs of Stockholm, including Rinkeby. Interior Minister Anders Ygeman called the clashes on Monday \u201cvery serious. \u201d But, he added: \u201cThere is work being done to make our suburbs and socially vulnerable areas safer. Sometimes it can get a little messy, but the police are not backing down. \u201d Nonetheless, the disturbances in Rinkeby were seized upon by some people online as evidence of Mr. Trump\u2019s claim. Rinkeby, an economically deprived area of about 16, 000 people, is overwhelmingly populated by residents with immigrant backgrounds.   news media in the United States and elsewhere have insisted that Sweden is covering up evidence of   crime  \u2014   a claim officials in this prosperous Scandinavian nation, which has a long humanitarian tradition, have rejected. Lars Bystrom, a police spokesman, said the police were summoned at 8:18 p. m. on Monday to the transit station in Rinkeby, about seven miles northwest of Stockholm\u2019s City Hall, after officers made a   arrest and were set upon by residents. A police officer fired a live round of ammunition as a warning shot. \u201cNo one was hit, but it had the intended effect of clearing the scene so that police could make an arrest,\u201d Mr. Bystrom said. The clashes intensified, with up to 70 people throwing stones and objects, before the police finally got the situation under control around 12:15 a. m. he said. Asked whether there was enough of a police presence in Rinkeby, Mr. Bystrom cited the district police chief, Niklas Andersson, in describing police resources in the area as plentiful. But Mr. Bystrom also said that officials would continue to bolster security. Patrik Derk, the district director for   the northernmost of the boroughs that make up the municipality of Stockholm, said it would be a mistake to see proof of Mr. Trump\u2019s claims in the unrest. \u201cThis type of problem exists in most countries, even in the U. S. A. ,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cAnd we are managing these problems and will succeed with this. They\u2019re complex problems. \u201d Mr. Derk was hired in late 2015 to \u201cmake Rinkeby a better place to grow up and live in,\u201d as he put it. He previously helped turn around the Hovsjo district of Sodertalje, a city southwest of Stockholm that, like Rinkeby, has a large population of   immigrants. \u201cWe created jobs through building development initiatives and training unemployed youth,\u201d he said, adding that the efforts involved collaboration with the police as well as economic investments. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what we are trying to do here, create a condition for the residents to live a good life in the area. \u201d Mr. Derk acknowledged that Rinkeby had significant problems: \u201cIt is one of the more troubled areas in terms of school results, tight quarters, unemployment. \u201d Benjamin Dousa, 24, an appointed member of a local board in Rinkeby that distributes public money for schools, social services, parks and recreation, and elder care, wrote in an opinion essay that Mr. Trump\u2019s critique had some merit. \u201cA battered journalist, stones thrown at the police and stores that are being plundered, unfortunately, are not unusual occurrences where I live,\u201d Mr. Dousa, whose father was a Turkish immigrant to Sweden, wrote in the essay, published in the newspaper Expressen. \u201cI hear the police helicopter every other day. \u201d He said that in the neighborhood, \u201cthis type of criminality has become part of everyday life. \u201d The prime minister, Stefan Lofven, has said that complaints that migrants are driving a crime surge are exaggerations. Mr. Trump\u2019s critique was made in response to a Fox News interview with Ami Horowitz, an American filmmaker who argues that migrants in Sweden have fed a rise in violent crime.   news media like Breitbart and Infowars have also pointed repeatedly to Sweden as a case study of the failure of immigrants to assimilate. Mr. Dousa said in a phone interview that he was familiar with the     news reports. \u201cOf course, some of them are fake, but the situation in Rinkeby is not good,\u201d he said. \u201cThe police don\u2019t have control over the area. That\u2019s not fake news. \u201d Mr. Horowitz has not responded to requests for an interview about his videos, which Swedish officials say contain errors and distortions. But Mr. Dousa said he was sympathetic to Mr. Horowitz\u2019s argument that Swedish elites are unwilling to talk about the problems associated with migration. \u201cIf you said you had a problem with integration in Sweden, you would be called a racist,\u201d he said, adding that the situation has been changing: \u201cThe debate has opened up. \u201d Questions about migration policy are being raised not only by the Sweden Democrats, a   party, but also by   parties, he said. Asked about Mr. Dousa\u2019s characterization of the problem, Mr. Derk said he agreed that more police officers were needed and that many young men in the community had criminal backgrounds. But, he said, officials should \u201caddress the underlying problem of unemployment and cramped living conditions. \u201d He added: \u201cWe need to develop relationships on the spot with the residents. We need to motivate people to leave criminality by creating work. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563878.0838785}
