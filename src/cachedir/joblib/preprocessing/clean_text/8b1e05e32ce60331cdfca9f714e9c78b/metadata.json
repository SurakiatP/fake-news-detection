But she changed her mind this weekend, after he rescinded his support for Donald J. Trump. Instead, she plans to split her ticket, voting for Mr. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, but for Mr. McCain\u2019s Democratic challenger, Representative Ann Kirkpatrick. She has never voted for a Democrat before. \u201cI want to send a message to John McCain,\u201d said Ms. Rupnik, 58, a consultant for an essential oils company. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t get elected, the American people that support Trump are going to blame it on those Republicans who didn\u2019t support him. \u201d Ms. Rupnik\u2019s punitive impulse captures the dilemma confronting Republican leaders as they head into the final four weeks of the campaign. Sticking by Mr. Trump after the surfacing of a 2005 recording in which he could be heard speaking about women in vulgar terms and bragging about being able to get away with sexual assault would subject Republican candidates to devastating and, quite possibly,   attack. But disavowing Mr. Trump, whose supporters make up the largest share of the Republican base, risks alienating those voters, potentially a no less lethal choice for Senate candidates in key races. And if Mr. Trump loses to Hillary Clinton, as polls now indicate is likely, the loss of those Senate contests could be crushing for a party that was already teetering and counting on a chance to rebuild after the election. An NBC   Street Journal poll conducted just before the debate showed Mr. Trump\u2019s support cratering, with Mrs. Clinton assuming an   lead nationally. Still, Mr. Trump has   supporters who have shown they will stay with him through every controversy he has sparked or endured. His populist, outsider message may be at odds with his background and even with some of his policy proposals, but it has taken hold with many voters, particularly   Republicans who are disenchanted with the party\u2019s elite and deeply unhappy with President Obama\u2019s stands on health care and immigration. \u201cThe establishment is trying to hold on to their power, and McCain is one of them,\u201d Ms. Rupnik said. That was a common theme in interviews with Trump supporters on Sunday in Arizona and New Hampshire, two states with close Senate contests. Many spoke witheringly of incumbent Republican lawmakers who have renounced their support for the party\u2019s presidential nominee. Stephen Cotta, 61, a Navy veteran who owns a cannabis testing lab in Tempe, described Mr. McCain as a \u201ctraitor\u201d and echoed Mr. Trump\u2019s view that he was \u201cnot a hero. \u201d Mr. Cotta said he, too, would vote for Ms. Kirkpatrick. \u201cIf you can see McCain and Hillary aren\u2019t that far apart on their philosophies, O. K. that\u2019s why they can stand up so adamantly to Trump,\u201d Mr. Cotta said. Vera Anderson, 75, of Phoenix, said she had voted for Mr. McCain before, but made up her mind to oppose him when she learned of his rejection of Mr. Trump. \u201cI was really on the fence of voting for McCain,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to, didn\u2019t want to, but this made up my mind: I will not vote for him in the general election. \u201d She was dismissive of the outrage over the 2005 recording that surfaced on Friday. \u201cNobody likes to hear anything like that, but to me that\u2019s not the important issue, so I absolutely, just  \u2014   I\u2019m not paying attention to it,\u201d Ms. Anderson said. \u201cYou know, to me, that is men\u2019s   talk. And I\u2019m sure that if anybody wants to criticize that, let them look at themselves first. \u201d There was similar disgust among Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters in New Hampshire, where Senator Kelly Ayotte  \u2014   locked in a tight   battle against Gov. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat  \u2014   became the first senator to disavow Mr. Trump after the recording\u2019s publication. \u201cI think the Republican Party is out for itself,\u201d said Buddy Greene, a    stonemason from Center Harbor, N. H. who said he supported Mr. Trump in the Republican primary in February. \u201cThey are not looking at issues of regular folk in the country. \u201d As he watched the New England Patriots play on television at the Frog Rock Tavern in Meredith, N. H. Mr. Greene said Ms. Ayotte had lost his support. But he said he had already come to see her as overly politically motivated. \u201cIt does not surprise me with her,\u201d Mr. Greene said. He said he planned to leave his ballot blank for the Senate contest. As Mr. Trump becomes more isolated from the Republican Party, elected officials risk being isolated from their own voters. Mr. Greene said he admired Mr. Trump\u2019s speaking style and trusted that there would be \u201cchecks and balances\u201d to prevent him from doing anything rash as president. \u201cI don\u2019t believe any president has absolute control,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not his fingers on the bomb. \u201d When a young boy listening pointed out that Mrs. Clinton had more political experience, Mr. Greene smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s why I like Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause he has no experience. I want change. \u201d For Mr. McCain, the decision to break with Mr. Trump is cushioned by the knowledge that he is on course to win  . Ms. Ayotte is in a tight race with Ms. Hassan, and her choice was fraught with more peril. Some Trump supporters in New Hampshire said they still planned to vote for Ms. Ayotte, but grudgingly, and more out of dislike for Ms. Hassan. One of them was Eric Granfors, a    truck driver from Nashua, who had harsh words for Ms. Ayotte and her reasoning. \u201cTo see Kelly Ayotte coming out and saying that she doesn\u2019t endorse him now? I think she\u2019s a sellout,\u201d Mr. Granfors said. \u201cYou know he\u2019s said a lot of bad things along the way. And now with another sound bite, she says this is the one where she isn\u2019t going to endorse him?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742563202.1986184}
