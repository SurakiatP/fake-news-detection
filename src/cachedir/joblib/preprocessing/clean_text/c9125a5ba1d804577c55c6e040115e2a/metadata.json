[The spotlight is now on President Barack Obama and his administration\u2019s alleged surveillance of the Trump campaign, as well as his aides\u2019 reported efforts to spread damaging information about Trump throughout government agencies to facilitate later investigations and, possibly, leaks to the media.  On Sunday morning, the White House released a statement indicating that the president would ask the congressional committees investigating Russian hacking theories to add the question of \u201cwhether executive branch investigative powers were abused in 2016. \u201d Media outlets continued to repeat that the story was based on \u201cno evidence,\u201d though the evidence was plain. President Donald Trump originally tweeted about the alleged surveillance  \u2014   which radio host Mark Levin called a \u201csilent coup\u201d by Obama staffers keen to undermine the new administration  \u2014   on Saturday. Levin\u2019s claims, reported at Breitbart News early Friday, were in turn based on information largely from mainstream outlets, including the New York Times and the Washington Post. Heat Street was one   source, but the BBC also reported similar information in January. So, too, did the UK Guardian, which is a mainstream source (albeit with a decidedly   slant, hardly favorable to Trump). All day Saturday, former Obama staffers tried to put out the fires. A spokesperson for President Obama responded  \u2014   and Obama aide Valerie Jarrett tweeted: A cardinal rule of the Obama Administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice. As part of that practice, neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U. S. citizen. Any suggestion otherwise is simply false. As Breitbart News\u2019 Matthew Boyle noted, however, it was a \u201c  denial. \u201d It is worth examining the statement in detail. Note that this sentence does not dispute any of the key factual allegations at issue: that the DOJ approached the FISA court for permission to spy on Trump aides that surveillance, once granted, continued after no evidence was found of wrongdoing that the Obama administration relaxed National Security Agency rules to facilitate the dissemination of evidence through the government and that Obama staffers allegedly did so, the better to leak damaging (and partial) information to the media. In addition, there is reason to doubt the claim that the White House never \u201cinterfered\u201d: the New York Times reported in January that \u201cintelligence reports based on some of the wiretapped communications had been provided to the White House. \u201d Moreover, the first part of the sentence raises doubts about Lewis\u2019s entire statement. Lewis could simply have said: \u201cNo White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the DOJ. \u201d That would have been a clear denial. Instead, he referred to a \u201ccardinal rule\u201d that supposedly existed. All that does is create deniability for the rest of the White House in the event that evidence turns up that someone was, in fact, involved with a Department of Justice probe. (No doubt Obama will be outraged to find out if someone broke the \u201ccardinal rule,\u201d and will claim to have found out through the media, rather than directly.) The Obama communications operation is notoriously careful with the way denials are worded. \u201cAs part of that practice, neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U. S. citizen. \u201d This is a meaningless denial, since the FISA court deals with communications with foreigners, with U. S. citizens potentially swept up in the investigation. It would have been possible for the DOJ to approach the FISA court with a request to monitor foreign entities allegedly communicating with the Trump campaign, using those intercepts as a way to monitor the Trump campaign itself. According to news reports cited by Andrew McCarthy, that could have been precisely what happened. And, again, this sentence does not deny that someone in the Obama administration may have ordered such surveillance. \u201cAny suggestion otherwise is simply false. \u201d What we have here is a blanket denial crafted to protect President Barack Obama himself, but allowing him to admit later  \u2014   once the facts emerge  \u2014   that his administration was, in fact, up to something. In addition, the Democrats have been adept at constructing elaborate chains of communication to create plausible deniability for  . That is how the \u201c \u201d scheme  \u2014   through which   activists instigated violence at Donald Trump\u2019s rallies  \u2014   was arranged for the Clinton campaign. (The organizer behind that scheme visited Obama\u2019s White House 340 times, meeting Obama himself 45 times.) As the New York Times  \u2014   supposedly the paper of record  \u2014   recently reported, there is \u201cno evidence\u201d that the \u201cTrump campaign was colluding with the Russians on the hacking or other efforts to influence the election. \u201d But there is ample evidence that the outgoing Obama administration could have used intelligence agencies to carry out a political agenda against Trump. The media, as Mark Levin pointed out again on Sunday\u2019s Fox and Friends, simply refuse to report their own earlier reports. Even without Trump\u2019s more sensational accusations of wiretapping, it is, so far, undisputed that there have been many leaks of classified information to damage Trump, and that the Obama administration took steps that could have made such leaks more likely. (Charles Krauthammer  \u2014   who is skeptical of \u201cdeep state\u201d theories  \u2014   called this the \u201cRevenge of the Losers\u201d on Friday.) Those are serious allegations that the former administration is likely going to have to explain to Congress. But if the Obama administration did order surveillance of the Trump campaign during the election and if Obama or any other White House officials knew about it (or created a \u201cplausible deniability\u201d scheme to allow such surveillance while preventing themselves from knowing about it directly) then there is an even bigger problem. It would then seem that the \u201cRussia hacking\u201d story was concocted not just to explain away an embarrassing election defeat, but to cover up the real scandal. Joel B.
