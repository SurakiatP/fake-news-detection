Today\u2019s approach revolves around directness and no-beating-around-the-bush kind of mentality when it comes to communication.\u201d \\nHe continued, \u201cThat\u2019s precisely the reason why we need to tackle the gun safety issue head on and without pardon. It\u2019s a burning problem that is affecting millions of Americans every single day, and as such, it represents an emergency. At the end of the day, public health is not something that should be neglected for the obvious reasons, and whether we\u2019d like to admit it or not, the public health of America today is becoming increasingly gangrenous.\u201d \\n\u201cGuns have found their way to every single layer of society and have become the preferred method of resolving disputes and mere disagreements,\u201d Kaine said. \u201cWe must put a stop to that and I\u2019m happy to announce that Hillary Clinton has come up with the perfect solution for this problem. She is going to modify Obamacare from its existing state into a comprehensive healthcare program that\u2019s going to include both voluntary, but also mandatory gun-addiction therapy.\u201d \\nHe also said, \u201cThat way, Republicans who just want to talk and have their side of the story heard will be listened to instead of ignored and left to their own inner demons, which tend to come up to the surface via a weapon of some sort. On the other hand, Republicans who own more than one firearm and/or shoot it regularly either at a firing range or somewhere else will be summoned to a mandatory conversation with a licensed gun-addiction psychotherapist who will make sure to explain to them that it\u2019s perfectly okay to be a liberal and own a gun. The two aren\u2019t mutually exclusive.\u201d \\n\u201cAnd the best part? They won\u2019t have to pay a cent for it \u2013 it will all be covered by the federal budget. So, even if you happen to be a recurring Republican and gun owner, don\u2019t worry, we can fix you. The Hillary Clinton administration will make sure to give back to its citizens just as much as it takes from them. And when you take a Republican\u2019s gun, you\u2019re basically de-Americanizing him. We are going to change that. Obamacare will become a symbol for fewer weapons in the country, which could ultimately result in a Nobel peace prize for Hillary Clinton. Only this time, naturally, it won\u2019t be just a fictional recognition. Unlike Obama, President Clinton will actually be given a plaque,\u201d Kaine concluded.
