Well, I bet you do. But then again, how about homo faber? What\u2019s the relation between homo sapiens and homo faber? \\nTranslated literally, homo faber means \u201cman, the maker.\u201d \\nTo put it simply, let\u2019s assume that dolphins are very intelligent creatures since that\u2019s what I hear constantly on National Geo and the Discovery Channel. \\nBut that intelligence doesn\u2019t help them much; they\u2019re just the same as they were 500,000 years ago. Cute, intelligent creatures that constantly get caught in our fishing nets (by mistake) and they can\u2019t get out. They often end up in tuna cans (that\u2019s why I never eat tuna, but I\u2019m digressing). \\nAre you starting to get the picture? \\nHomo faber is a peculiar creature, and I mean us, the people, the only \u201canimals\u201d on the planet which are able to control their environment through the use of \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 tools. Okay, tools and a juicy brain-to-body ratio. Some say that we control our fate too with those same tools , but I have my doubts about that. \\nRegardless of what you\u2019re thinking about your fate or the lack thereof, tools are pretty cool to have, especially in a survival situation . But then again, tools aren\u2019t necessarily defined by what you can buy for $3.99 in your local hardware store. \\nActually, some while ago, I saw an octopus on TV that was using a small rock to break a clam\u2019s shell. By most accounts, octopuses are pretty stupid compared to humans. \\nThe idea is that when confronted with an outdoors survival scenario, you can improvise tools from scratch, thus living to fight another day. If an octopus can do it, so can you, right? \\nSo, if early humans were able to manufacture tools using first animal bones, then stones, then metal and then via 3D printing, what\u2019s there to stop you from learning from your ancestors? \\nNow that you have the general idea, let\u2019s see about a few primitive-technology ideas which may very well save your life someday, or at least improve the quality of life for you and your family in a survival scenario, which is the next best thing. \\n1. How to build a fresh water prawn trap from scratch \\nThe idea is very simple and straightforward: one must eat in order to stay alive. So, with the prawn trap you can catch prawns and eat them. The trap is very easy to build using lawyer cane, vine, and sticks. Prawn/fish traps are very easy DIY traps which can successfully be used to catch aquatic life thanks to their peculiar shape. \\nBasically, you\u2019ll have to build a simple basket with an entrance designed in a funnel-like fashion so that the prawn will get funneled in, but it will not be able to get out. Here\u2019s the detailed video tutorial about the DIY-ing job itself. Video first seen on Primitive Technology . \\nThe trap must be placed under some tree roots or something similar in the water and it doesn\u2019t require bait, as curiosity kills the cat \u2026 err, prawns. You\u2019ll require a little bit of basketry practice but if you\u2019re into outdoor survival, learning this skill may prove very useful some day for many different tasks. \\n2. How to make a survival spear from scratch \\nSpears were among the first hunting/ self defense weapons used by mankind and this video tutorial will teach you how to make your own survival spear from (almost) scratch. Video first seen on Animal Man Survivor . \\nAll that\u2019s required is a cutting tool, which may very well be a knife or a stone with a sharp edge. and a piece of wood of the desired length. Watching the video will also teach you how to make a fire using what\u2019s available in the woods, i.e. almost nothing. \\nOh, I almost forgot \u2013 here\u2019s how to make a rock knife if you don\u2019t carry a survival blade on your person 24/7 (not good). Video first seen on Captain Quinn . \\n3. How to build a grass hut from scratch \\nYou do remember the holy trinity of survival, right? Food, water and shelter. I know that a grass hut made from scratch is not a tool per se, but it\u2019s a shelter by any definition and it can be built basically anywhere on Earth, provided there\u2019s grass available. Which means, almost anywhere. \\nThis project is easy to build, with a simple yet effective design and you\u2019ll only require a sharp stone (or a knife) and a digging tool (stick, shovel, whatever). Here\u2019s the video tutorial. Video first seen on Primitive Technology . \\n4. How to DIY a Bow and Arrow from scratch \\nWhile hunting with a spear requires some mad skills, bows and arrows are the ideal hunting tools for long-term wilderness survival. \\nThis video tutorial will teach you how to DIY a bow and arrow outdoors, using primitive \u201ctechnology\u201d \u2013 natural materials and tools made from scratch, i.e. a stone chisel, a stone hatchet, fire sticks and various stone blades. Video first seen on Primitive Technology . \\n5. How to DIY a cord drill from scratch \\nCheck out this video tutorial and you\u2019ll learn how to make a cord drill from scratch. This baby consists of a fly wheel, a shaft, and a piece of cord and it can be used for making a fire without getting blisters on your (soft) hands or for drilling holes. Video first seen on Primitive Technology . \\nNow, with the \u201csurvival stuff\u201d taken care of, let\u2019s see about a few life-hacks, i.e. some \u201cmore benign\u201d tools made from recycled materials. \\nNext time you destroy a tape measure, you can improvise a depth gauge using a piece from the broken tape-measure by cutting out a twelve inch section using a pair of tin snips. To get an usable zero to twelve inch scale, start cutting at the beginning of a one footmarker and then use the ultra-thin, elastic material for measuring stuff in small/confined places \\nYou can use scrap wood from the shop for improvising a table saw push stick for keeping your hands and fingers on the safe side when feeding wood to the saw at a consistent rate. Video first seen on Adam Gabbert . \\nHere\u2019s how to make a scratch stock cutter from an old hand saw which can be used for scraping/scratching a decorative profile into a piece of wood, a method used by furniture manufacturers on historic pieces for creating a hand-made appearance. Video first seen on Wood By Wright . \\nYou can improvise an adjustable marking gauge by driving a dry-wall screw into a piece of wood. Video first seen on Paul Sellers . \\nYou can use an empty bottle as a glue dispenser, thus saving money by buying glue in bulk. You\u2019ll require an empty bottle that features an extendable cap, which allows you to distribute a consistent amount of adhesive for, let\u2019s say edge-gluing boards. \\nWhen closing the cap, you\u2019ll prevent the glue from drying out. The best bottles to use are bottles with sports caps, such as water bottles,, Gatorade bottles, or dish soap bottles. An expired credit card is excellent as a glue spreader. \\nIf you want to drill perfectly perpendicular deep holes without a drill-press, just use an old piece of mirror and position it against the drill bit. \\nYou\u2019ll have to fine-tune the position of the drill until the reflection and the bit are combined in such a way that they look perfectly aligned. That\u2019s all! \\nOr you can make your own smart saw at home.
