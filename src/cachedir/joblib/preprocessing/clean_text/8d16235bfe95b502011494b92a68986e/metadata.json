Talking to supporters, Strache argued \u201cthe uncontrolled influx of migrants alien to our culture who seep into our social welfare system\u2026 makes civil war in the medium-term not unlikely.\u201d Austrian Freedom Party (FPOe) party leader Heinz-Christian Strache (L) and Freedom Party\u2019s presidential candidate Norbert Hofer UK Express (h/t Terry D) Strache added that his party\u2019s presidential candidate, Norbert Hofer, \u201cwill be there for all Austrians\u201d in a rallying speech to drum up support ahead of the general election. Hofer has attempted to keep a neutral tone in a bid to broaden the typical appeal of the Freedom Party from an anti-immigration stance to the wider Austrian population ahead of a re-run of the earlier election. Yet the 45-year-old\u2019s recent election posters carry the phrase \u201cso help me God\u201d \u2013 a term which has been slammed by both Islamic and Christian officials who say introducing God into the campaign is not appropriate. \u201cVienna must not become Istanbul\u201d He says what Vienna thinks Three branches of the Protestant church in Austria released a joint statement denouncing the slogan. It reads: \u201cGod cannot be instrumentalised for one\u2019s own intentions or for political purposes. \u201cWe consider that mentioning God\u2026 to attack other religions and cultures indirectly amounts to an abuse of his name and religion in general.\u201d The Freedom Party claim Hofer used the rallying phrase as it came \u201cdirectly from the heart\u201d and \u201cis strongly anchored in Christian and Western values\u201d which the party holds. Two-thirds of Austrians identify as Catholic while just four per cent are Protestant. The Freedom Party narrowly lost the election by just 31,000 votes to Alexander Van der Bellen\u2019s left-leaning Green party, but the result was ruled void after voting irregularities were discovered. The initial re-run of the election was due to take place in October but has been pushed back to December after defects were found in the postal vote envelopes.'"}, "time": 1742564501.0481215}
