Boyle made the point that the way House Republicans can succeed in passing any health care legislation is to keep Ryan on the sidelines, and continue forward with negotiations directly between House Freedom Caucus chairman Rep. Mark Meadows ( ) and House Tuesday Group   Rep. Tom MacArthur ( ) since Ryan\u2019s unpopularity jeopardizes the Republican Party\u2019s chance at success.  \u201cMark Meadows and Tom MacArthur have gotten together and negotiated out a fix, a new bill, a series of compromises from both sides that likely could pass the House of Representatives,\u201d Boyle said. Boyle noted that the House Freedom Caucus has been trying to get legislation that would lower Americans\u2019 healthcare premiums, something Ryan\u2019s original bill did not do. \u201cThe number one goal of House Republicans, especially conservatives, is to lower people\u2019s premiums so that they\u2019re paying less for health insurance but they still have health insurance,\u201d Boyle said. \u201cThat\u2019s the impetus here. That\u2019s the key thing these guys are negotiating on. The reason why there\u2019s a chance for success right now is because of the fact that the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus Mark Meadows as well as the   of the Tuesday Group, Tom MacArthur, have gotten together. \u201d  \u201cPaul Ryan, the Speaker of the House who is very, very unpopular across the country right now, has taken a step back,\u201d he continued. \u201cHe\u2019s not been really involved in this. He was out in Hollywood, he was over in Europe, while this whole thing has been going on, so as long as Paul Ryan stays out of the picture here they have a chance at passing an Obamacare repeal and replace and following through on President Trump\u2019s campaign promise to repeal and replace Obamacare and they might even be able to do it in the first 100 days. \u201d Follow Breitbart News on Twitter @BreitbartNews'"}, "time": 1742562084.0438018}
