The conference title was an impressive achievement that will nonetheless most likely leave the Nittany Lions short of the College Football Playoff. No. 8 Penn State ( ) overwhelmed Wisconsin\u2019s defense, which had entered the game holding opponents to 13. 7 points per game, with a pass attack spearheaded by quarterback Trace McSorley and receiver Saeed Blacknall, both juniors. McSorley finished 22 of 31 for 384 passing yards and four touchdowns, while Blacknall caught six of those passes for 155 yards and two touchdowns. No. 6 Wisconsin ( ) ran the ball well, as is its tradition, with the   running back committee of Corey Clement, Bradrick Shaw and Dare Ogunbowale. Clement led with 21 carries for 164 yards and a touchdown. But as the game wore on and Wisconsin\u2019s stellar front seven found it more difficult to pressure McSorley, Wisconsin\u2019s weaker defensive secondary was exposed. It was a triumphant night for Penn State and its fans, who wore white and packed Lucas Oil Stadium for their team\u2019s first title game appearance in the six years in which the Big Ten has had one it also came five years after the Jerry Sandusky scandal. But it was unlikely that the sense of total triumph would last longer than 12 more hours. Because of conference standings, the Badgers, sixth in the playoff rankings, and the Nittany Lions, seventh in those rankings, played for the conference title even though two conference rivals  \u2014   Ohio State and Michigan  \u2014   were ranked above them. With No. 4 Washington having manhandled No. 9 Colorado in the   title game Friday night,   No. 1 Alabama having rolled over No. 15 Florida,   for the Southeastern Conference title on Saturday afternoon and No. 3 Clemson having handled No. 19 Virginia Tech in the Atlantic Coast Conference championship game,   on Saturday night, there was expected to be room for only one Big Ten team in the final   playoff bracket. That team will very likely be No. 2 Ohio State ( ) which, unlike the other Big Ten contenders, has just one loss  \u2014   at Penn State,   in October  \u2014   and wins over No. 7 Oklahoma, No. 5 Michigan and Wisconsin. That did not stop Penn State Coach James Franklin from making his case. During the postgame trophy ceremony, his voice booming through the stadium loudspeaker, he grabbed the microphone like a professional wrestler mugging for the crowd. \u201cWe just won the toughest conference in college football,\u201d Franklin said. Referring to Penn State\u2019s   start, he added: \u201cThey say you\u2019re allowed to overcome early setbacks? We\u2019ve done that. It\u2019s on you now, committee. \u201d Big Ten Commissioner Jim Delany had said on ESPN on Saturday morning that he thought that Alabama and Ohio State had done enough to make the Playoff. He added that when the Playoff was being formulated four years ago, he had advocated that it comprise the four best conference champions. As it turned out, the committee is instructed to select the four best teams, with conference championships merely a positive factor. \u201cWe wanted this process  \u2014   we wanted the human element,\u201d Delany said after the trophy ceremony. \u201cAnd regardless of what happens, I\u2019ll be supportive of the outcome. We would love to have a team or two or three or four. We had a good year. \u201d Wisconsin, meanwhile, is most likely not be heading to the playoff or to the Rose Bowl  \u2014   which will feature the   Big Ten team that does not make the Playoff. Coach Paul Chryst acknowledged as much after the game, saying, \u201cOur team didn\u2019t make enough plays tonight. \u201d Wisconsin seemed in control early, steadily moving the ball in a first drive that consumed eight minutes and resulted in a touchdown. The Badgers\u2019 second drive was shorter, the score coming on the second play as Clement ran by Penn State\u2019s secondary for 67 yards. In the second quarter, Wisconsin linebacker Ryan Connelly recovered a bad snap and ran it in 12 yards to give the Badgers a   lead. Penn State, rushing to the line and conveying offensive plays via hand signals, wanted the game to be fast, and the Lions did well when they turned the tempo their way. With 58 seconds left in the first half, they scored on a   pass to Blacknall after a defensive misplay. The third quarter brought an even worse error from Wisconsin\u2019s secondary. With Penn State at its 30, McSorley backed up and heaved the ball nearly 60 yards through the air to Blacknall, who broke free of cornerback Natrell Jamerson. Safety D\u2019Cota Dixon, coming from the opposite direction, overran Blacknall, allowing him to run 20 yards into the end zone. Penn State made it   before Wisconsin  \u2014   which had earlier missed a   field goal attempt  \u2014   drove into the red zone and settled for a   field goal. That was followed by the fourth consecutive drive on which Penn State scored a touchdown  \u2014   a pass to the star running back Saquon Barkley that gave Penn State the lead,  . Penn State\u2019s Tyler Davis added a   field goal on the following drive. Wisconsin then drove more than 50 yards, but with 1 minute 1 second left and his team needing a yard to convert a fourth down from Penn State\u2019s    Clement was tackled for no gain, putting the game on ice.'"}, "time": 1742562638.868514}
