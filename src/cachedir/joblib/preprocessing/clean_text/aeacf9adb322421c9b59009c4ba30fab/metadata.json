Hashtags have spread to raise awareness of its offensiveness and to try to put an end to it. And after the massacre in an Orlando nightclub popular with gay Latinos, commentators have urged fans to abandon it once and for all. But still, as is customary when the Mexican national team is playing in an international tournament, it could be heard: the roar of \u201cEeeh   \u2026     puto!\u201d by Mexican fans trying to distract the opposing goalkeeper punting the ball upfield. \u201cPuto,\u201d roughly translated as \u201cmale prostitute,\u201d is a slur often hurled at gay men in Mexico, but fans who chant it say they use it out of the more generalized meaning of \u201ccoward\u201d (or, in the adjective form, simply an unpleasant thing). On Monday, two days after a gunman killed 49 people in Orlando, Fla. including at least four Mexican nationals, the chant could be heard during Mexico\u2019s match against Venezuela in Houston during the Copa Am\u00e9rica regional tournament, being held in the United States for the first time. Some people even believe they heard it chanted with a little more gusto, as if in defiance over the criticism of the term. Mexico\u2019s national team was fined $20, 700 in January by FIFA, the world soccer body, over fans\u2019 use of the chant in a World Cup qualifying game against El Salvador in November. In theory, FIFA could move to take away points in the World Cup standings, which could derail the team\u2019s advancement to the 2018 finals. On Thursday, without mentioning Mexico, Concacaf, the governing body for soccer in North and Central America and the Caribbean, issued a statement denouncing \u201cchants or actions that are derogatory or offensive\u201d and said that \u201cthey must be stopped. \u201d It did not mention what action, if any, it would take. Mexico next plays on Saturday night in a Copa Am\u00e9rica quarterfinal match against Chile at Levi\u2019s Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif. In Mexico, the chant is largely seen as much ado about nothing, and penalizing the team over it a sign of political correctness. Luis Fernando Lara, the editor of the Diccionario del espa\u00f1ol de Mexico (Dictionary of Mexican Spanish) said in an interview that the word derives from a Latin root that means \u201cchild. \u201d In its feminine form, it came to mean \u201cprostitute,\u201d and its male form took that meaning as well, particularly in the gay community. It evolved to mean \u201ccoward\u201d or \u201c . \u201d In soccer matches, he said, it is intended simply to insult the goalkeeper, not to call him gay. \u201cIt seems to me that FIFA is wrong in judging the shout as an insult to homosexuals,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is indeed an insult, but it is not aimed at the gay community. I think unfortunately they are making a cause out of the shout all through a politically incorrect mistake. \u201d Many gay advocates consider such reasoning nonsense. \u201cThe whole point is that the choice of this word is absolutely linked to a negative, homophobic meaning,\u201d said Enrique Torre Molina, a Mexican who is campaign manager at All Out, an international gay rights organization. \u201c\u2018Puto\u2019 is the word many gay men have been called in school or even by family members to mock us or put us down. \u2018Puto\u2019 is the word many gay men hear as they\u2019re being beaten, sometimes to death, in the daily homophobic crimes committed in Latin America. \u201d\u2019 \u201dHe added: \u201cWhat is kind of infuriating, especially after tragedies like the Orlando shooting and any other homophobic crime that happens, is to read and hear people refusing to let it go after having so many gay men literally asking for them to drop it. If you have a group of people saying, \u2019Hey, when you use this word, it hurts,\u2019 why not drop it? \u201d\u201d \u2019Some fans are trying to do just that. Sergio Tristan, a   and the founder of Pancho Villa\u2019s Army, an Austin, Tex.  fan club for the Mexican team, said the group had tried to persuade the \u201cvocal minority\u201d backing the chant to drop it. Tristan said that he had once chanted it too but that he had eventually acknowledged that it was offensive and not worth the penalties that have been or could be imposed on the team. He said the vitriol directed by American fans offended by the chat could actually backfire. \u201cThey actually are making it worse,\u201d he said, pointing to the perceived louder volume of the chant at recent matches. \u201cIt\u2019s a Mexican problem that should be solved by Mexican fans. \u201d He added: \u201cWhether or not it is offensive, it really is a matter of perspective. We want to stop it because we are at the juncture where our team could suffer fines or lose points in our World Cup spot. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564582.7445638}
