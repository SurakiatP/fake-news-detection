Make your own Oscar picks with this interactive ballot. From its   premiere at the Venice Film Festival last summer, \u201cLa La Land,\u201d the tale of   strivers reaching for   glory, has charmed best picture wins out of prize givers. It has it all  \u2014   singing, dancing, Ryan Gosling, summer frocks that never wrinkle  \u2014   along with a muted choir of dissenters who don\u2019t understand all the fuss. One crucial win \u201cLa La\u201d missed was the top Screen Actors Guild Award, an Oscar bellwether that went instead to \u201cHidden Figures,\u201d adding a measure of frisson to a race that\u2019s all but sewn up. That boost for \u201cHidden Figures\u201d is certainly giving \u201cLa La Land\u201d a bit of competition, as is the indie favorite, \u201cMoonlight,\u201d a surprise hit with an ardent fan base. The failure of \u201cLa La Land\u201d to land even a SAG nomination is injurious but hardly fatal. (The musical is a   not an ensemble.) By now, it is hard to imagine anything stopping the momentum of \u201cLa La Land. \u201d It is heading into the Academy Awards with 14 nominations, tying the previous record holders, \u201cTitanic\u201d and \u201cAll About Eve. \u201d Another point to remember is that when it comes to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, \u201cbest picture\u201d really means \u201cmost popular picture. \u201d And \u201cLa La Land\u201d is about something that academy voters cherish above all: themselves. You know it\u2019s a tight race when Amy Adams and Annette Bening are shut out despite critically lauded performances in equally lauded films. But Emma Stone is the heavy favorite for her turn in \u201cLa La Land,\u201d having snagged the Golden Globe, the Bafta and the Screen Actors Guild Award. Whether Ms. Stone really bested her fellow Oscar contenders Meryl Streep, Ruth Negga, Natalie Portman and Isabelle Huppert is a matter of opinion, but other factors work in her favor: She largely carried an enormously popular film, she\u2019s an ing\u00e9nue in Hollywood\u2019s eyes, she\u2019s well liked by the academy, and she has been nominated for an Oscar before. While Ms. Huppert is putting up stiff competition, it\u2019s almost assuredly Ms. Stone\u2019s year. Casey Affleck has been in the Oscar race before but didn\u2019t win. His   turn in \u201cManchester by the Sea,\u201d along with his many triumphs all season long, pointed to Oscar gold. Then the Screen Actors Guild Award for best actor went to Denzel Washington (\u201cFences\u201d) an upset that shocked everyone, even Mr. Washington. Given that the actors\u2019 branch is the academy\u2019s largest, and that most SAG winners go on to nab Oscars, Mr. Washington seems well poised to win. (And for Mr. Affleck, renewed attention to 2010 sexual harassment complaints that he settled didn\u2019t help.) But Mr. Washington already has two Oscars, and only six actors in history have won more. So I\u2019m betting on Mr. Affleck. This category was locked up from the word go. Viola Davis could have easily run for best actress for her performance in \u201cFences\u201d  \u2014   and arguably should have, given that she won the Tony for a lead role for the same part when \u201cFences\u201d ran on Broadway. But Ms. Davis is said to have chosen to run for supporting actress, a less competitive category. Regardless, few doubt it is high time that she won an Oscar. This is her third nomination, and she has already landed more than two dozen awards this season. While her fellow competitors have all gamely shown up to support their films, Ms. Davis owns the category. While there are indications of a possible upset  \u2014   Dev Patel won the Bafta for \u201cLion\u201d  \u2014   odds favor Mahershala Ali from \u201cMoonlight. \u201d Though Mr. Ali spent far less time onscreen than some of his fellow nominees  \u2014   like Jeff Bridges, who dominated much of \u201cHell or High Water\u201d  \u2014   his performance as the tenderhearted drug dealer Juan was one of the season\u2019s most talked about. He also brought peerless grace and elegance to his   appearances, which are crucial to any campaign. It is hard to imagine anyone topping Mr. Ali\u2019s heartfelt \u201cI am a Muslim\u201d acceptance speech from the SAG Awards, except, come Sunday, Mr. Ali himself. \u201cThe Umbrellas of Cherbourg\u201d was released 21 years before Damien Chazelle was born, yet the homage he pays to it and other musicals of yore in his hit, \u201cLa La Land,\u201d greatly endeared him to the academy. Although early chatter suggested his fellow nominees Kenneth Lonergan and Barry Jenkins were strong bets, Mr. Chazelle has mopped up big prizes: a Golden Globe, a Bafta and, crucially, the Directors Guild of America Award. The guild\u2019s membership overlaps with the academy\u2019s, and the D. G. A. Awards are largely predictive of Oscars. It also helps that Mr. Chazelle is a known quantity to the academy: His \u201cWhiplash\u201d took home three Oscars in 2015. Until a few weeks ago, Disney\u2019s \u201cZootopia,\u201d about a plucky rabbit police officer fighting prejudice and a   lamb, seemed a   for this prize, having collected a Golden Globe and a Producers Guild Award. But then \u201cKubo and the Two Strings,\u201d about a Japanese boy on a hero\u2019s quest to defeat an evil spirit, won the Bafta for animated feature, an accolade that usually foretells an academy win. \u201cKubo\u201d is also up for best visual effects, making it a very strong contender. But \u201cZootopia\u201d will probably benefit from its timing: It is a love letter to diversity and the triumph of acceptance over xenophobia, a message the film\u2019s campaigners have been pushing all season long. And the Academy Award for best documentary feature goes to   \u2026     a nearly   television  . Though the director Ezra Edelman and his backers at ESPN vigorously insist their virtuoso project \u201cO. J.: Made in America\u201d is genuinely a theatrical film rather than one made for TV, the fact is, it is both. And that has done nothing to stop Mr. Edelman from winning almost every major documentary award this season, among them a Producers Guild prize. While some believe the television lineage of \u201cO. J. \u201d will undercut its chances with the academy  \u2014   and note that the Bafta for best documentary went to Ava DuVernay\u2019s \u201c13th\u201d (\u201cO. J. \u201d wasn\u2019t eligible)  \u2014   odds are that Mr. Edelman will be collecting an Oscar. Early in the season, the momentum seemed to be behind \u201cToni Erdmann,\u201d a German satire with a run time of nearly three hours that thrilled critics. But that is long to sit through for a foreign film, especially for voters watching screeners. After France\u2019s entry, \u201cElle,\u201d failed to be nominated, energy seemed to shift to Sweden\u2019s \u201cA Man Called Ove. \u201d But then came the White House travel ban, which drew attention to Iran\u2019s much lauded entry, \u201cThe Salesman,\u201d by Asghar Farhadi, who announced that he would boycott the ceremony in protest. Mr. Farhadi won an Oscar for his 2011 drama \u201cA Separation. \u201d This time, voting for him has become political, which will probably give him the edge. \u201cManchester by the Sea,\u201d a poignant and at times wry tale of a Massachusetts man gripped by grief, made history this year by becoming the first film to land a best picture Oscar nomination for a streaming service (its distributor is Amazon). Yet the film\u2019s best picture chances are slim, thanks to the juggernaut that is \u201cLa La Land. \u201d But Kenneth Lonergan, the \u201cManchester\u201d director, is expected to win the Oscar for best original screenplay. Few match his skills at capturing and conveying onscreen the idiosyncrasies, awkwardness and absurdities of everyday conversation and life. Also bolstering Mr. Lonergan\u2019s chances: His script isn\u2019t up against \u201cMoonlight,\u201d which was deemed an adaptation and has passionate support. Whether Barry Jenkins\u2019s screenplay for \u201cMoonlight,\u201d a cinematic tone poem about growing up poor, black and gay, should be considered adapted or original is in the eye of the beholder. The Writers Guild of America and Bafta organizers deemed it original, but the academy decided it was an adaptation of an unproduced stage piece by Tarell Alvin McCraney, who receives story credit. The academy\u2019s designation certainly helped the film\u2019s chances in the adapted category by not pitting it against \u201cManchester by the Sea,\u201d which took home the original screenplay Bafta. Still, \u201cMoonlight\u201d ended up besting \u201cManchester\u201d for original screenplay at the Writers Guild Awards. Confusing? Sure. But in the end, it makes the movie the favorite here.'"}, "time": 1742563537.55301}
