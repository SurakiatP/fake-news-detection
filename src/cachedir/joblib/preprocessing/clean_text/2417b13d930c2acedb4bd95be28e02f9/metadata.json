{"duration": 0.0654296875, "input_args": {"text": "'Vinnie Paz of the hip hop group, Jedi Mind Tricks, wrote this song inspired by the work of people\u2019s historian, Howard Zinn. It picks up where his song, \u201cYou Can\u2019t Be Neutral on a Moving Train,\u201d left off, and similarly, it is a kind of hip hop cliff notes of Zinn\u2019s book, \u201cA People\u2019s History Of the United States.\u201d \\n\u201cWritings On Disobedience and Democracy\u201d was put out as part of the \u201c30 Days, 50 Songs\u201d project, which posted songs over a period of 30 days in order to motivate voters to defeat Donald Trump. The project was not just anti-Trump. Artists For a Trump-Free America were very pro-Hillary Clinton. However, what stands out and makes Paz\u2019s song enduring is that it does not make any reference to Trump or the 2016 election. \\nAs Paz said when the song was shared, \u201cIt felt like the right time to rekindle some of these forgotten stories in American history.\u201d He added these are \u201cstories that aren\u2019t necessarily taught in our classrooms.\u201d\\nThe song opens with the following Zinn quote:\\nWe have to stop thinking that we must have military solutions to the problems we face in the world. The solutions that we need are the solutions dealing with sickness and disease and hunger. That\u2019s fundamental. If you want to end terrorism, you have to stop being terrorists, which is what war is. \\nPaz begins with the imperialist intentions behind the United States\u2019s involvement in World War II. Acknowledging the unspeakable evil of Adolf Hitler\u2019s regime, he then summarizes, \u201cWe opposed the Haitian revolution. We turned Guam, Puerto Rico, and Hawaii into institutions, pretended to help Cuba win freedom from Spain. This country\u2019s built on the blood of other people\u2019s pain.\u201d \\nBlacks looked at anti-Semitism in Germany. What they saw mirrored their experience in the U.S. And America appeased Hitler in the 1930s until President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was ready to advance imperialist interests. But, as Paz puts it, \u201cRoosevelt ain\u2019t care about oppression of the Jews.\u201d \\nAs Paz tells it, in 1945, \u201cTroops were jammed onto the Queen Mary. The blacks were stowed down in the depths of the same ferry. See there\u2019s a parallel you have to understand, that they wanted them to fight but wouldn\u2019t treat them like a man.\u201d \\nPaz notes the workers\u2019 resistance that occurred post-WWWII then the black revolt in the 1950s. \\n\u201cAngelo Herndon felt everything was equal,\u201d Paz raps. \u201cHe was arrested, they convicted for insurrection\\nHow the fuck it\u2019s insurrection? I call it dissension. Gave him five years when all he wanted was protection.\u201d\\n\u201cThere was other black men that made the same connection. Benjamin Davis defended Herndon as a savior\\nThen Paul Robeson; he only magnified the danger. Harry Truman had to deal with the militant mood. But how the fuck that gonna work when he a racist too?\u201d\\nThe song covers the Freedom Rides, the Black Panthers, the Vietnam War and Watergate. Following these events, \u201cThere was a deep economic insecurity in this world of ours. Environmental deterioration took its toll. A cultural violence upon the families took its toll. Problems couldn\u2019t be solved without bold changes. But no major party candidates proposed changes.\u201d\\nRonald Reagan was elected president. He cut welfare for the poor and unemployment grew. That is where Paz ends, but he plans to continue the conversation in a future song. \\nIn the outro, Paz asks people to reflect on what they were taught in school and whether they were taught lies about American history. \u201cDig into the real history of this country, and the fact that it was built on blood,\u201d he urges Americans. \\nNot only does it stand as a tribute to Zinn, but it also serves as a means to use the form of hip hop to reach people who may not be aware of the history brought to the fore by Zinn. It celebrates dissent and resistance at a time when it is critical for people to take the fear and panic from a Trump election and channel it into targeted action. \\nListen to Paz\u2019s \u201cWritings on Disobedience and Democracy\u201d: \\n\\nThe post Protest Song Of The Week: \u2018Writings On Disobedience And Democracy\u2019 appeared first on Shadowproof .\\n'"}, "time": 1742562730.8121939}
