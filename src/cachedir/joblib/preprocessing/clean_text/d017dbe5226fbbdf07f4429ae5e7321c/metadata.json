It\u2019ll be the last time I go into that fucking place. I felt so old\u201d. \\nMr. Roache is currently being treated for verbal looping at the psychiatric unit, and doctors have suggested temporarily moving him to an old folks home in a bid to \u2018snap him out of it\u2019. \\n\u201cThis kind of thing is common in the over 35\u2019s,\u201d Dr. Kevin Maher explained, \u201cHopefully an hour or two in the old folks home will neutralize his psychosis. He should have known better going to a nightclub at his age, though\u201d.\""}, "time": 1742562229.0507486}
