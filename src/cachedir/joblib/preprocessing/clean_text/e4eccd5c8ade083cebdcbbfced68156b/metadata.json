Straight white men are a big problem, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d declared Carroll. \\n\u201cBut I actually feel pretty good about it,\u201d he continued. \u201cI think straight white guys have been screwing things up for long enough. High time for straight white males to step back and let some other people do it.\u201d \\n\u201cThat\u2019s my dad!\u201d replied Lena, as Carroll laughed. \\n{snip} \\nLena Dunham has expressed monumental support for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton this year, even hitting the campaign trail in North Carolina to encourage young people to vote for Clinton .
