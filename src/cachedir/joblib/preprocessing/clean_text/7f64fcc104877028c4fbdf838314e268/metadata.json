Something Lord Maggot Kerr would not know about since he lives in his taxpayer funded mansions replete with duck houses and luxury. \\nWhat he does not understand is that the premise of Brexit is not to halt migration completely but to control it. We are not against controlled migration, we are against unfettered uncontrolled migration. \\nIf there ever were a time to bury these cockroaches infesting the House of Lords, now would be a good time to begin.
