You have no idea how much you are eating. \\nEver wonder why you can\u2019t gain any muscle or lose any body fat? Well, the first place to look for the answer is your diet. Are you eating the requisite amount of calories for your goals? If you want to gain muscle you have to eat more calories than you burn, whereas if you want to lose body fat you have to eat fewer calories than you burn. There is no way around this simple fact. Even though this is nothing more than a grade school physics problem, I\u2019m still baffled by the number of guys out there whining about being \u201chardgainers\u201d or \u201cendomorphs.\u201d Invest in a food scale and track your intake. It\u2019s really not that hard. \\n2. You are constantly looking for the next best supplement to take. \\nThis is the game equivalent of asking for the one magic pick up line that will allow you to swoop top shelf girls left and right. The hard truth is that the vast majority of supplements are a complete waste of money. Guys flock to supplements because it\u2019s an easy fix. Instead of putting in the time and hard work needed to obtain the results they desire, they look for shortcuts in order to get ahead. Unfortunately, these shortcuts don\u2019t exist. The only time you should be worrying about supplements is when you have all of the other nutritional building blocks in place. \\n3. You think you don\u2019t have the time to eat healthy. \\nA lot of guys complain about being too busy to eat nutritious meals made mostly of whole foods. Guys will also complain about not having enough time to hit the gym after work (or during their lunch break). The problem here is not one of time , but rather of priorities . Guys would rather sleep-in than get up early to make themselves a good lunch to take to work. The bottom line is this: if you value your health then find the time to make yourself nutritious meals. Ditch the excuses. \\n4. You think there is one \u201cbest\u201d diet for everyone \\nI\u2019ve been in this game long enough to know that there is no one particular diet that is best for everyone. I remember about 10 years ago people were losing their minds over The Atkins Diet. About 5 years later people moved on to The Paleo Diet, and now Intermittent Fasting is all the rage. New diets will always be on the horizon, which pretty much guarantees that arguments on the internet about which diet is the \u201cbest\u201d will never end. I do not know what the \u201cbest\u201d diet is. What I do know is that all good diets have several things in common such as being based around whole foods, and acknowledging the importance of portion control, protein, fiber, and other important nutrients. Aside from these basics, whether you eat low carb or high carb, three meals a day or six meal, is entirely up to you and your lifestyle but make sure you get the basics down first. \\nIf you can get a handle on just these four areas of your nutrition you will be ahead of the vast majority of individuals out there.'"}, "time": 1742562033.5497003}
