In the latest episode of The   we explore what, exactly, the Obama legacy will be. The president is aggressively telling his version, through a major speech broadcast on   TV, interviews and a forthcoming book. But   Donald J. Trump is telling a very different version, through tweets, speeches and news conferences. Who\u2019s will win out? I speak with David Leonhardt, an   columnist at The New York Times who chronicled the Obama administration from the start, and Jodi Kantor, a reporter whose book, \u201cThe Obamas,\u201d was just reissued with a new preface. Our   conversation explores Mr. Obama\u2019s impact on race, health care, economic inequality and America\u2019s place in the world. And we seek to answer a question historians may puzzle over for decades: Just how consequential was this presidency compared with past White Houses? I speak as well to former Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts about whether Mr. Obama\u2019s relationship with Republican lawmakers had to be so adversarial, polarizing and partisan. Who was to blame? Could Mr. Obama have done more to get things done using executive orders? Mr. Frank is blunt. \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d he says. \u201cYou had a Republican majority in both houses that (A) was determined to undercut him politically and (B) did not care if the government was dysfunctional because they don\u2019t like government anyway. And to the extent, by the way, that a failure for the government to perform discredited government, that was a further benefit as far as they\u2019re concerned. \u201d From a desktop or laptop, you can listen by pressing play on the button above.
