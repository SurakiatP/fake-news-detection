It shows he\u2019s curious, interested in what Obama has to say. By not opening it, he\u2019s telling Obama and the world that he has something better to do with his time,\u201d explained app and politics expert Morgan Wilde. \\nA number of Snapchat users have become heavily invested in the ongoing brinkmanship between the two superpowers who are locked in a series of countermeasures in Syria, which have left lives of innocent civilians in the balance and with rumours persisting that Putin hasn\u2019t looked at any Western leaders\u2019 Snapchat stories in weeks, the outlook is bleak. \\n\u201cOh, shit, I didn\u2019t realise it was all this serious,\u201d said one Snapchat user, who had finally begun to understand the full extent of the deterioration of the diplomatic relationship. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to be squabbling over Aleppo, and accusations of war crimes, but it really hits home when it\u2019s played out on my favourite app,\u201d added Snapchat user Ciaran Bergin. \\nHowever, some political commentators have urged people not to read too much into the exchange. \\n\u201cLook, who knows what the Snap contained, it could have just been Obama with a dog face, his way of reaching out to Putin and saying \u2018God, it\u2019s lonely at the top, isn\u2019t it? Now, how funny do I look with dog ears and a big tongue?\u2019 Let\u2019s not panic about this,\u201d shared commentator Henrietta Norris. \\nThere is some hope in Russia circles that Putin was simply taking a day off the app as he\u2019s sick of seeing the same 4 or 5 people send Snapchats all day long.'"}, "time": 1742562393.7342343}
