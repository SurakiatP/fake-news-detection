[Hamas\u2019 deputy diplomatic leader Mousa Abu Marzouk and former Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh met with Egyptian military officials this week.  \u201cExtraditing jihadists to Egypt would send significant shockwaves across the Gaza Strip and will create a backlash among Hamas loyalists, most notably its military wing operatives,\u201d a Hamas official told Breitbart Jerusalem. He said the fate of the jihadists detained by Hamas was a central part of the negotiation between the two parties and the main impediment to progress in an overall positive process of rapprochement with Egypt. \u201cHaniyeh and Marzouk gave all the information they had about Islamic State loyalists in the Gaza Strip, including some specific names that the Egyptians raised,\u201d he said. \u201cThey also pledged that they\u2019ll pass on any information their interrogation may yield. But extradition remains a bone of contention. \u201d He said that security arrangements across the border to prevent the movement of militants between Sinai and Gaza have been discussed, as well as the establishment of a joint force. He failed to disclose any further details about this. Meanwhile, Hamas has continued to loosen its grip on IS sympathizers in Gaza. A Gaza jihadi affiliated with IS ideology said that for the first time in almost a year Hamas has allowed detainees to be visited by their families. Abu Baker Almuhajer surmised that Hamas is hoping to persuade Welayat Sinai, IS\u2019s Egyptian affiliate, to send a weapons shipment it has delayed. Speaking to Egyptian journalists in Cairo, Marzouk said that Hamas \u201cturned over a new leaf with Egypt, and no longer shelters anyone who may be a risk to Egypt\u2019s national security. \u201d He said Hamas\u2019 relationship with Egypt was better than it had ever been, and that the Egyptian judiciary had failed to link Hamas to attacks against Egyptian targets. \u201cCurrently, there are no more outstanding issues between us and our Egyptian brothers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe received from them a wanted list, comprising very few names, and we\u2019ll discuss each of them individually. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561983.2163126}
