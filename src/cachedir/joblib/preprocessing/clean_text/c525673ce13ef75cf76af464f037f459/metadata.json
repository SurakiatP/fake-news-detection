Turkey declared martial law as military factions attempted a coup. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose whereabouts was previously unclear, flew back to Istanbul. It was a sign that the coup was failing as factions fought for control. \u201cThere is no power higher than the power of the people,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said earlier, using an iPhone to broadcast messages. Our live coverage is here. _____ 2. World leaders expressed solidarity and outrage as France reeled from its third major terrorist attack in 19 months. \u201cThe times have changed,\u201d Prime Minister Manuel Valls said, \u201cand France is going to have to live with terrorism. \u201d The weapon was chillingly mundane: a   refrigerator truck, driven into a crowd of people watching holiday fireworks in the Mediterranean city of Nice. At least 84 people were killed  \u2014   including children  \u2014   and more than 200 injured in a   trail of carnage. _____ 3. The police shot and killed the   driver. He was identified as Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel, a    Tunisian who moved to France about 10 years ago. _____ 4. In the U. S. the attack prompted Donald Trump to pledge to seek a declaration of war from Congress against Islamic terrorists. He also delayed an appearance with his newly named running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, above. Newt Gingrich, whom Mr. Trump passed over for vice president, stirred controversy by saying that American Muslims who believed in Shariah law should be deported. _____ 5. Plans for the Republican National Convention, which starts Monday, were still taking shape. The football player Tim Tebow denied reports that he would be speaking, and the rabbi of Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka backed out of delivering the invocation. More than a dozen senators also say they have better things to do next week. (Jeff Flake of Arizona said he would be \u201cmowing my lawn. \u201d) _____ 6. Congress released 28   pages of its 2002 inquiry into the Sept. 11 attacks, which list possible links between Saudi officials and Qaeda operatives. Lawmakers and families of victims fought for years to declassify the pages, which were kept secret to protect U. S.  relations. Repeated investigations failed to confirm any official Saudi role, and Saudi officials welcomed the release as a way to \u201cclear up, once and for all, any lingering questions or suspicions. \u201d _____ 7. In theaters this weekend: \u201cGhostbusters. \u201d  Our reviewer calls it cheerfully silly  \u2014   and a lot like the 1984 comedy hit, \u201cexcept that it stars four funny women instead of, you know, four funny men. \u201d The   Paul Feig, she writes, is \u201cone of the best things to happen to American   comedy. \u201d And here are more recommendations from our entertainment experts on TV and streaming options. _____ 8. Herbalife, the supplements company, avoided being classified as a pyramid scheme by the Federal Trade Commission but agreed to pay $200 million to resolve accusations of deception. Herbalife\u2019s stock rose 11. 7 percent, to $66. 15. _____ 9. Researchers made inroads on understanding just how much harsher the misery of jet lag is going east than west. The team\u2019s mathematical model of the body\u2019s   cells shows that a westward trip across nine time zones can take eight days of recovery, because lengthening a day is easier to handle. The eastward parallel may take a person 13 days to bounce back from. _____ 10. Finally, China\u2019s farmers think they can offer customers something even better than organic. They are adapting the herbal elixirs in traditional Chinese medicine for  their cows, pigs and ducks. One farmer said that what\u2019s good for the goose is good for those dining on the goose. \u201cIn the old days, we used traditional methods to feed the animals,\u201d one farmer said. \u201cPeople\u2019s longevity was very long. \u201d Have a good weekend. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.
