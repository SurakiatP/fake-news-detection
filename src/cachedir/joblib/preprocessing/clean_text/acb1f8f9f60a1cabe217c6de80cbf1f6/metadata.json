At the time, Breitbart News called Trump\u2019s use of the CRA a \u201clegislative milestone,\u201d arguing that Trump\u2019s \u201cuse of the CRA to repeal regulations has put future administrations on notice that there is a limit to government\u2019s regulatory reach, and that given the opportunity by the voters, conservatives will enforce those limits. \u201d Now, Politico\u2019s Andrew Restuccia and Nancy Cook seem to agree  \u2014   and they fill in the rest of the picture, noting that Trump\u2019s executive orders and executive actions amount to \u201ca series of actions that could reshape American life for decades  \u2014   efforts to rewrite or wipe out regulations affecting everything from student loans and restaurant menus to internet privacy, workplace injuries and climate change. \u201d They add: Trump is   \u2026     setting bureaucratic wheels in motion that could eventually ax or revise hundreds of regulations as agencies reorient themselves toward unwinding red tape and granting speedier approvals to projects   \u2026     If successful, these efforts could represent the most   rollback of federal regulations since Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidency, especially if Trump\u2019s proposed budget cuts make it hard for a future Democratic president to reaccelerate the   apparatus. Trump\u2019s assault on regulations represent a fulfillment of a core campaign promise, and the execution of what adviser Steve Bannon called in February the \u201cdeconstruction of the administrative state. \u201d Read the full Politico article here.
