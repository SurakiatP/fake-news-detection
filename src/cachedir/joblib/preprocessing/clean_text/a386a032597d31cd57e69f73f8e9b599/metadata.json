Trump as president of the United States has shocked the world  \u2014   and has the potential to reshape it. \u201cI want to tell the world community that while we will always put America\u2019s interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone  \u2014   all people and all other nations,\u201d Mr. Trump said in his victory speech. His triumph was seen as good for Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, but made some in Mexico nervous. Leaders from Asia, Europe and Latin America offered congratulations to Mr. Trump or to the United States, but the distinctions in their messages were noteworthy. Latin American heads of state wished Mr. Trump well, and offered their own ideas on how he might govern. Venezuela, a country that Mr. Trump has repeatedly criticized for its leftist leadership, asked Mr. Trump to essentially mind his own country\u2019s business by \u201crespecting nonintervention in internal issues and to the right of development and peace. \u201d Juan Manuel Santos, the president of Colombia and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, said he hoped Colombia and the United States \u201cwill continue deepening bilateral relations. \u201d Mr. Trump has criticized a trade agreement between Colombia and the United States, among many other trade deals. \u00c1lvaro Garc\u00eda Linera, Bolivia\u2019s leftist vice president, said the voters\u2019 endorsement of Mr. Trump\u2019s populist message shows how Americans, too, are questioning prevailing economic paradigms in \u201ca passive revolution,\u201d this time coming from the right. Others expressed dismay with the election entirely. \u201cThe excesses of this eccentric millionaire have proven that the number one enemy of the U. S. is not beyond its borders, but rather within,\u201d wrote Vladimir Fl\u00f3rez, a Colombian cartoonist popularly known as Vladdo, in El Tiempo newspaper. \u201cThis threat called Trump is a product of American society a nightmarish mutation of the American dream. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign  \u2014   and his promise to build a wall on the United   border and to deport millions of immigrants in the country illegally  \u2014   became a rallying point for Mexicans. He has promised to blow up the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta, upending commerce between the two countries, valued at about $500 billion a year. Early on Wednesday  \u2014   as the peso gyrated  \u2014   President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto said, \u201cMexico and the U. S. A. are friends, partners and allies. \u201d Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, a popular leftist politician and likely 2018 presidential candidate, asked Mexicans \u201cto remain calm,\u201d and said, \u201cWe will stay together no matter what the circumstances are. \u201d Foreign Minister Claudia Ruiz Massieu repeated in a television interview on Wednesday morning that Mexico would not pay for the wall.  \u2014   AZAM AHMED President Mauricio Macri had rooted for Hillary Clinton but said he hoped to work with Mr. Trump. \u201cOne of the issues that worried us is the transition,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will have to adapt, and that is what we will do. \u201d Earlier in the week, Foreign Minister Susana Malcorra warned that a Trump victory would bring relations between the United States and Argentina \u201cto a standstill,\u201d but on Wednesday she praised his \u201cconciliatory\u201d victory speech.  \u2014   DANIEL POLITI Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who enjoys a close relationship with President Obama, said that \u201cCanada has no closer friend, partner and ally than the United States. \u201d He added, \u201cThe relationship between our two countries serves as a model for the world. \u201d But Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to revisit Nafta brings unwelcome uncertainty to Canada\u2019s economy. Mr. Trudeau\u2019s open approach to immigration and refugees is the inverse of Mr. Trump\u2019s. And Canada will be in a difficult position if it imposes carbon taxes only to find that Mr. Trump undoes all American efforts to mitigate climate change. One of the few positive developments for Canada is Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to reverse the Obama administration\u2019s decision to block the Keystone XL pipeline.  \u2014   IAN AUSTEN Ban   the United Nations secretary general, said it was \u201cworth recalling and reaffirming that the unity in diversity of the United States is one of the country\u2019s greatest strengths. \u201d As if to remind the United States of its role as a guarantor of world stability, he noted that it is \u201can essential actor across the international agenda. \u201d Mr. Trump has demanded that the NATO allies of the United States foot more of the bill for their collective defense. Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary general, noted that the alliance comes with legal obligations. \u201cNATO\u2019s security guarantee is a treaty commitment and all allies have made a solemn commitment  \u2014   a solemn commitment  \u2014   to defend each other,\u201d Mr. Stoltenberg said. \u201cWe have to remember that the only time that we have invoked Article 5, our collective defense clause, is after an attack on the United States, after  . \u201d  \u2014   RICK GLADSTONE and JAMES KANTER The two top officials of the European Union  \u2014   Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, and   Juncker, president of the European Commission  \u2014    congratulated Mr. Trump and invited him to visit Europe. \u201cEuropeans trust that America, whose democratic ideals have always been a beacon of hope around the globe, will continue to invest in its partnerships with friends and allies, to help make our citizens and the people of the world more secure and more prosperous,\u201d they wrote. Later, however, Mr. Tusk, a former prime minister of Poland, warned that Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union, and the election of Mr. Trump, should raise alarms. \u201cThe events of the last months and days should be treated as a warning sign for all who believe in liberal democracy,\u201d he said. Guy Verhofstadt, the leader of a prominent group of lawmakers in the European Parliament and a former prime minister of Belgium, called Mr. Trump\u2019s victory \u201ca   call for European leaders,\u201d adding, \u201cDonald Trump has declared several times that our priorities are not his. \u201d He added: \u201cWe cannot be dependent anymore on the U. S. we have to take charge of our own destiny. Europe should get its act together, too, and set its internal differences aside. \u201d Britain\u2019s prime minister, Theresa May, spoke of the country\u2019s \u201cenduring and special relationship\u201d with the United States. President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France noted that \u201csome of Donald Trump\u2019s campaign positions must be put to the test of the values and the interests that we share with the United States. \u201d He added that \u201cdisorders in the world are worrying people everywhere, including the people of America, the first world power. \u201d The French prime minister,   Ayrault, asked, \u201cWhat will become of the Paris agreement on the climate, of the nuclear deal with Iran that Donald Trump wants to reconsider?\u201d Chancellor Angela Merkel congratulated Mr. Trump and offered her cooperation  \u2014   but stressed that it must rest on human rights and nondiscrimination. Germany\u2019s foreign minister,   Steinmeier, said that \u201cif Donald Trump really wants to be president of all Americans, then I think his first duty is to fill in the deep rifts which arose during the campaign. \u201d  \u2014   AURELIEN BREEDEN, JAMES KANTER and ALISON SMALE Two   nationalist leaders  \u2014   Geert Wilders in the Netherlands and Marine Le Pen in France  \u2014   cheered Mr. Trump\u2019s victory. \u201cThe Americans are taking their country back,\u201d Mr. Wilders, a lawmaker who leads the Party for Freedom and who faces   charges in his home country, wrote on Twitter. He called Mr. Trump\u2019s election \u201ca historic victory\u201d and \u201ca revolution. \u201d Ms. Le Pen, the leader of the National Front in France and a candidate for the French presidency, congratulated Mr. Trump on Twitter and declared the American people \u201cfree!\u201d She called it \u201cgood news for our country. \u201d Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary, one of the few European leaders who spoke favorably of Mr. Trump during the campaign, wrote on Facebook: \u201cWhat a great news. Democracy is still alive. \u201d  \u2014   BENO\u00ceT MORENNE and MARTIN de BOURMONT Mr. Trump has called the January agreement between Iran and world powers \u201cthe worst deal ever,\u201d and he has vowed to unilaterally abandon it. Under the agreement, Iran has given up large chunks of its nuclear program in exchange for some sanctions relief. The head of Iran\u2019s atomic energy program told the semiofficial Tasnim news agency on Wednesday that the country would \u201ctry to continue to implement the nuclear agreement. \u201d Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said last week that the presidential debates had illustrated \u201cthe crisis America is in. \u201d Some analysts said the election of Mr. Trump was the result of an \u201cawakening,\u201d Iran\u2019s ideological label for some of the Arab Spring revolts. One analyst, Farshad Ghorbanpour, who is close to the government of the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, said he feared the implications for Mr. Rouhani, who has been promoting better relations with Washington. \u201cOur   will pressure him, they are very happy now,\u201d he said. \u2014   THOMAS ERDBRINK \u201c  Trump is a true friend of the State of Israel, and I look forward to working with him to advance security, stability and peace in our region,\u201d Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement. The United States is Israel\u2019s most important ally. The Israeli government, which has often had a tense relationship with the Obama administration, has studiously avoided taking sides, but at the same time, Jerusalem has moved to improve relations with India and Russia, and is in talks to develop economic ties with China.  \u2014   ISABEL KERSHNER Across the Middle East, where the United States has a long history of often divisive involvement, many seemed to have no idea how to react to the election of Mr. Trump. President Abdel Fattah   of Egypt and Prime Minister Binali Yildirim of Turkey quickly congratulated Mr. Trump, but official reaction was scarce from Saudi Arabia. Mr. Trump said the kingdom may no longer be able to count on American defense guarantees and should give the United States \u201cfree oil for the next 10 years. \u201d Syrians, too, said they had little inkling what the vote would mean for the civil war in their country, although many in the opposition had expressed hope that a victory for Hillary Clinton would mean more robust support for the rebels fighting to topple President Bashar  . \u201cI am scared, scared for Syria,\u201d said Murhaf Jouejati, the chairman of the  Day After organization, an independent body that aims to prepare Syrians for a democratic future. \u201cHere is a man who is openly saying that he is going to defer to the Russians on Syria. This is a clear victory for the Assad regime. \u201d Many have expressed worry that Mr. Trump\u2019s negative statements about Islam and Muslims would translate into aggressive policies in the region, as well as making it harder for displaced Syrians to seek refuge.  \u2014   BEN HUBBARD, ANNE BARNARD and HWAIDA SAAD Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who had been planning to meet Mrs. Clinton in Washington in February, tried to calm his country, as the yen surged and stocks stumbled. \u201cHand in hand with Trump, we will try to work together,\u201d he said. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump singled out Japan. He claimed that Tokyo was not paying its fair share to support United States military bases, calling into question the American commitment to defend Japan in case of attack. A rising China could put a check on Mr. Trump\u2019s stated ambitions in Asia. \u201cMaybe he will decrease the commitment to Pacific security issues,\u201d said Shin Kawashima, professor of international relations at the University of Tokyo. \u201cBut if he carries out such a policy, China will be much more authoritative and aggressive in the Pacific. And then most of the alliance countries and security experts in Washington will be against Trump\u2019s policies. It is a little difficult for Trump to just change all the old policies. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s talk of disengaging could embolden Mr. Abe\u2019s efforts to build its military capabilities and strengthen ties with Russia.  \u2014   MOTOKO RICH and HISAKO UENO President Park   of South Korea instructed her government to coordinate closely with Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team to ensure that her country and the United States would maintain sanctions and pressure on North Korea to stop its nuclear weapons program. \u201cNorth Korea should not misjudge the solidity of our alliance with the United States and our joint ability to respond\u201d to provocations, said Jeong   a government spokesman. Mr. Trump unsettled South Koreans when he said that he might withdraw American troops from their country unless Seoul paid more for their presence. He also indicated that he might let Japan and South Korea protect themselves with nuclear weapons and that he might negotiate directly with the North Korean leader, Kim  . Mr. Trump\u2019s surprisingly strong performance caught analysts off guard, but it was welcome news for those in South Korea who believe that their country must build its own nuclear weapons to defend against North Korea.  \u2014   CHOE   Prime Minister Najib Razak of Malaysia was one of the first leaders to offer effusive praise for Mr. Trump. \u201cThe world has watched this year\u2019s presidential election with fascination,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cAt almost every turn, media commentators have been proved wrong and the results anticipated by experts have been overturned. Donald Trump was considered a distant outsider when his candidacy was first announced. He beat the establishment consensus by winning the Republican nomination, and did so again with his remarkable victory today. Mr. Trump\u2019s success shows that politicians should never take voters for granted. \u201d Mr. Najib, who has stared down corruption charges, added, \u201cHis appeal to Americans who have been left behind  \u2014   those who want to see their government more focused on their interests and welfare, and less embroiled in foreign interventions that proved to be against U. S. interests  \u2014   have won Mr. Trump the White House. \u201d Arriving in Malaysia on Wednesday evening, Rodrigo Duterte, the president of the Philippines, who has lashed out at the United States and at Mr. Obama in often profane comments, mentioned Mr. Trump in a speech to overseas Filipino workers. \u201cCongratulations,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are alike. We both swear. \u201d  \u2014   SEWELL CHAN and RICHARD C. PADDOCK Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a tweet addressed at Mr. Trump, \u201cWe appreciate the friendship you have articulated towards India during your campaign. \u201d For India, a central question is whether Washington will reduce its military presence. \u201cIf that is called into question, India will no longer be able to rely on the U. S. to be there as a security provider,\u201d said Dhruva Jaishankar, a fellow at the Brookings Institution India Center. The result could be more assertive attitudes from China, Japan and Korea. Manjeet Kripalani, the executive director of Gateway House, a   think tank, likened Mr. Trump to Putin of Russia, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, and Mr. Modi. (A former journalist, Ms. Kripalani worked for Steve Forbes\u2019s 1996 presidential campaign.) As far as any change in the relationship between India and the United States is concerned, she predicted, \u201cYou will find the Trump administration being realistic about Pakistan, being realistic about India and realistic about China. \u201d  \u2014   ELLEN BARRY and NIDA NAJAR Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull reassured his people that \u201cAmericans understand that they have no stronger ally, no better friend, than Australia. \u201d Mr. Turnbull said the American role in the Pacific region had underpinned stability, economic growth and a   order, a term he and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop have used when discussing the resolution of disputes with China over territorial and fishing rights in the South China Sea. \u201cI have great confidence that all of our engagement will continue to be strong and intimate, filled with the trust and confidence that has characterized it for so many years,\u201d Mr. Turnbull said.  \u2014   MICHELLE INNIS'"}, "time": 1742563035.2314923}
