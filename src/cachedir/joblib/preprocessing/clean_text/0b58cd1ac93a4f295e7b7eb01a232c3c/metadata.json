[Page Six pointed out that in a Reddit AMA on Tuesday, one user asked the actor and devout Christian Scientist: \u201cWhat would you want fans to know about having, and beating, the Big C. ?\u201d  \u201cI am very grateful for all the prayers and good thoughts from around the world,\u201d the    Heat star replied. \u201cPeople that know I am a Christian Scientist make the assumption that I have somehow endangered myself. But many many people have been healed by prayer throughout recorded history. And many many people have died by whatever was modern medicine. \u201d Kilmer said that multiple doctors prayed for him while he was in the hospital and he even spoke to the inventor of the defibrillator, Dr. Bernard Lowen. Kilmer recounted his conversation with Lowen, saying, \u201cHe started to weep without his voice wavering and he leaned into me and said, \u2018Fluff their pillow. That what I tell all the interns. LOVE. Love heals. More than any other skills, I urge them to LOVE the life they are entrusted to save.\u2019 Well that\u2019s what is at the heart of Mrs. Eddy\u2019s understanding of the teachings of Jesus. \u201d Kilmer revealed his battle with cancer in a previous Reddit AMA when one user asked him about actor Michael Douglas\u2019 claim that he was battling a terminal form of the illness. \u201cHe was probably trying to help me cause press probably asked where I was these days, and I did have a healing of cancer, but my tongue is still swollen altho healing all the time,\u201d Kilmer replied then. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t sound my normal self yet people think I may still be under the weather. \u201d   Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
