Gingrich, told Megyn Kelly that \u201c You are fascinated by sex and you don\u2019t care about public policy. \u201d He followed up that outburst by demanding that Kelly repeat his words about Bill Clinton: \u201cI want to hear you use the words, \u2018 Bill Clinton, sexual predator .\u2019 Say, \u2018Bill Clinton, sexual predator. \u2019 \u201d Being that it was her show and she control the microphone, Kelly ended the interview ended with Kelly telling Gingrich, \u201c You can take your anger issues and spend some time working on them .\u201d Fireworks on FAUX NEWS! Further, this shift accentuates the fact that Trump is leading Clinton by an overwhelming majority and Kelly has aligned with the losing side and it is going to cost her the coveted career that she has worked all of her life to obtain. \\nSince the Gingrich interview, Kelly\u2019s already declining ratings, the result of her incessant Trump bashing, took a nose dive into the toilet and emptied out into the local sewer. Megyn Kelly is not likely to recover from the fact that she has been exposed as a Clinton supporter and denier of her crimes. Look for Judge Jeanine Pirro to take her place in the 9-10 PM Eastern time slot. Meanwhile, Sean Hannity\u2019s ratings continue to climb for all the obvious reasons. \\nThe Trump crowd has spoken, Megyn Kelly is on the wrong side of history.'"}, "time": 1742563708.517559}
