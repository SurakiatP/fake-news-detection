Arnoldski -  \\n\\n\\nThe Donetsk People\u2019s Republic is discussing opening five new representative offices in EU countries similar to the one already established in Czech Republic. This was announced by the acting minister of foreign affairs of the self-proclaimed republic, Natalya Nikonorova.  \\nNikonorova recalled that the DPR\u2019s first representative office is already successfully working in Czech Republic and a program for its activities until the end of the year has been worked out.  \\n\u201cWe are very grateful to Mrs. Nela Liskova, our representative in the Czech Republic with whom we\u2019ve worked in this direction, as well as the citizens of the Czech Republic, who are not indifferent to us,\u201d the DPR\u2019s foreign minister expressed thanks. \\n\u201cNow we plan to open several more such centers in Europe. In total, around five are under development for now,\u201d Nikonorova reported. \\nThe diplomat remarked that there are several challenges facing the DPR on this matter. \u201cNot all states and not all governments in Europe are friendly and sympathetic towards the DPR. But we are working through the laws of every state in order to open our centers there in accordance with state legislation, so that there would be no possibility to reproach us,\u201d she stated. \\n\\nNikonorova also expressed hope that attitudes towards the DPR will change for the better in many countries of Europe in the future.  \\n\\n     Follow us on Facebook!                                                   \\n                                                   \\n\\n       Follow us on Twitter! \\n                               \\n\\n             Donate! \\n'"}, "time": 1742563852.6238317}
