Cuban said, \u201cYou have to ask why do they support him and I think we\u2019re coming to a greater understanding now. I call it political chemotherapy. One of my friends, who I always thought was really smart, I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s dumb,  but had a different viewpoint on why he voted for Trump. I didn\u2019t expect him to vote for him. He said \u2018Mark, I\u2019ve voted for politicians my entire life.\u2019 He\u2019s in his 50s. \u2018Do you know what the definition of insanity is? Doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. So I voted for Donald Trump. Is he poisonous in a lot of respects? Yeah, this is out chemotherapy. We hope he\u2019s going to change the political system.\u2019 And if that\u2019s the way you\u2019re evaluating Donald Trump, he\u2019s doing a phenomenal job. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742563176.4461753}
