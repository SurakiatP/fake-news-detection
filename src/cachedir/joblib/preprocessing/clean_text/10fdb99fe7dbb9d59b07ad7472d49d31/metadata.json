Bloomberg, writing on the report , put the key fact-like price comparison in the deck: \\nAutonomous taxis one-quarter the price of New York cab ride \\nAnd then quoted the following eye-popping fact-like dollars-and-cents figure: \\nThe self-driving vehicles being pioneered by Tesla Motors Inc., Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and others are poised to dramatically lower the cost of taxis, potentially making them cheaper than buses or subways, according to a joint report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance and McKinsey & Co. Having no driver to pay could reduce taxi prices to 67 cents a mile by 2025 , less than a quarter of the cost in Manhattan today, the report found. \\n(The word \u201ccould\u201d seems to be doing rather a lot of work in the second sentence.) But how were those figures \u201cfound\u201d? On what basis did McKinsey, the \u201cthe trusted advisor and counselor to many of the world\u2019s most influential businesses and institutions\u201d , come to its conclusions? \\nAnd here, readers, I went wrong. I thought I would try to understand the business ratios and income statements of today\u2019s taxi industry ( NAICS code 4853 ; income statement from Yellow Cab of Missoula, MT[ 1]) and use those as a baseline to evaluate McKinsey\u2019s analysis. That was a time-consuming mistake, and here is why. \\nLet\u2019s look at the report, starting by having searched the PDF on \u201c67.\u201d Here is the source for Bloomberg\u2019s quote, Exhibit 10: \\nI\u2019ve helpfully highlighted the \u201c67\u201d; interestingly, a PDF search reveals that this is the only place where \u201c67\u201d appears. There is, for example, no table or equation showing the calculations through which McKinsey arrived at that figure.[2] Nevertheless, we look for some explanation, and the best I can find is in the text adjacent to Exhibit 10, on pages 23 and 25. (I\u2019ve pasted a snippet from page 23 in at the top of page 25, and helpfully highlighted some of the text, and footnote 17): \\nNow, the $0.67 figure in Exhibit 10 applies only to the case of an \u201cindividual use\u201d self-driving taxi (the chart says \u201cself-driven,\u201d but the caption is correct). That is, Jane Coder calls up a self-driving taxi to get to work, and when she\u2019s done with her commute, the freed-up taxi responds to a call from Joe Coder to go home, and so on. The taxi is not shared. This use case is described in the paragraph marked \u201c[1]\u201d. Here is that paragraph: \\nFor many drivers ride-hailing would nonetheless become the economic alternative. An on-demand, self-driving vehicle could also replace most current shared-mobility business models such as car sharing, carpooling, and ride-hailing: it could drive itself to the next customer, to a designated parking space, or back to the point of origin. \\nDo you see any calculations there \u2014 indeed, any numbers at all \u2014 that would justify the $0.67 figure? No? (Notice also that \u201ccould\u201d and \u201cwould\u201d are working hard in this paragraph, too.) \\nWe move on to the paragraph marked [2]: \\nIf a private consumer were open to sharing a ride with another traveler, the economics become even more attractive: on average, using a self-driving, electric, pooled taxi could be 30\u201360 percent cheaper per mile than a private vehicle, depending on the number of people sharing the ride. By 2025, a private car would cost $0.43/mile, whereas a consumer could use a self-driving, pooled taxi for as little as $0.17/mile\u2013$0.29/mile 17 . \\nHere at least we see claims with numbers in them, but none of them are relevant to the \u201cindividual use self-driving taxi\u201d case, and so the $0.67 figure remains a mystery, as yet unexplained. We move on to the paragraph marked [3]: \\nCompared with public transport, it appears that in various US cities public transport remains about as twice as cheap as human-driven taxi pooling with a cost of $0.64/mile in 2015. \\nThe same applies; the $0.67 figure remains inexplicable. But wait! There\u2019s that footnote 17 in the paragraph marked \u201c[2]\u201d: \\nCosts are estimated the total cost of ownership, assuming 70,000 miles driven annually[3], average driver salaries, 10 percent overhead costs and a 10 percent required rate of return on invested capital for the fleet operator. We assume a utilization factor of 50 percent for taxis and 70 percent for pooled cars. This does not take into account a price premium for any additional journey time required to pick up multiple passengers. \\n(I\u2019ve helpfully underlined the weasel words, along with words that make me ask \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d) Do you see a source for any of this? No? Why would that be? (Contrast footnote 17, in the left column, to footnotes 18, 19, and 20 in the right column, all of which provide sources. \\nWishing to give McKinsey the benefit of the doubt, I looked for their editorial policies, which I found on page 64, on the About page. In relevant part: \\nSo this really is the best part, isn\u2019t it? \\nThe information contained in this publication is derived from carefully selected sources we believe are reasonable. \\nWell, I should hope so! (\u201cTrusted advisor and counsellor,\u201d et cetera et cetera.) So that\u2019s alright then! Although one could wish that the \u201creasonable\u201d and \u201ccarefully selected\u201d sources were named.[4] \\n* * * \\nSo, I\u2019ve managed to emulate the classic bad New Yorker article; I followed the ornithologists into the swamp, because when they said they heard the call of a rare bird, I believed them. But they didn\u2019t find the bird! So, we still don\u2019t know where McKinsey got its sixty-seven cents ($0.67) a mile figure for its \u201cself-driving taxi\u201d use case. (What the Bloomberg reporter thought they were doing when they repeated it is another question.) And we don\u2019t know know why its \u201creport\u201d didn\u2019t provide an explanation for it. Explanations that occur to me: \\n1. An editorial disaster . Nobody checked footnote 17 to add the sourcing the for sixty-seven cents ($0.67) a mile figure. This strikes me as unlikely, given the level of attention given to the reports design. \\n2. A public relations scam . McKinsey simply made up the sixty-seven cents ($0.67) a mile figure out of whole cloth. This strikes me as unlikely, given the whole \u201ctrusted advisor\u201d schtick. \\n3. A bait and switch . The source of the calculations for sixty-seven cents ($0.67) a mile figure is internal and proprietary, and McKinsey won\u2019t reveal anything until you engage them. This strikes me as unlikely, dittoez. \\n\u2018Tis a puzzlement! \\nNOTES \\n[1] I don\u2019t want to whinge about this, but when I was a sprat, twenty years ago, and I wanted industry ratios and company reports, I\u2019d go down to the Boston Public Library\u2019s Business Branch , display my library card, and get the information for free . Google was awfully good at displaying results from \u201cindustry research\u201d firms that demand a fee , but not so good with, er, \u201cfree stuff.\u201d Am I looking for stats in all the wrong places? \\n[2] Why 67? Why not 65? Or 70? I\u2019d hate to think McKinsey guilty of spurious precision. \\n[3] New York\u2019s Taxicab Factbook estimates that the average cab travels 70,000 miles per year. \\n[4] There\u2019s also \u201cWe do not guarantee its accuracy or completeness and nothing in this document shall be construed to be a representation of such a guarantee,\u201d but I assume Bud from Legal insisted that go in, and I don\u2019t hold it against them. \\nAPPENDIX \\nI like this too. From page 49: \\nAnd the text: \\nWithin the mobility sector itself, an on-demand self-driving taxi could replace most current shared-mobility business models. Adding a self-driving component to car-sharing operations, ridehailing services, and taxi services makes the business models indistinguishable. \\nIndeed it \u201ccould\u201d! Exactly in the way the wizards of Unseen University nailing magic broomsticks under Sam Vimes\u2019s horse-drawn coach made it \u201cindistinguishable\u201d from an airborne, supersonic vehicle! 0 0 0 0 0 0'"}, "time": 1742562681.816842}
