[Convenience and security are the two key benefits of the new system that MasterCard have highlighted. While contactless payment technology offers speed, no authentication is usually needed. PIN numbers are more secure, but they take a greater amount of time, can be forgotten, and can easily be seen if the keypad is not obscured from prying eyes. The fingerprint system provides the best of both worlds at least in MasterCard\u2019s opinion.  Previous iterations of biometric cards required a separate fingerprint scanner, limiting their usefulness, as the special equipment needed to be provided by the store, which only a small minority did. This new generation of cards only needs to be inserted into the standard terminal, with the fingerprint authentication bypassing the need to enter a PIN number. A MasterCard spokesperson did say that \u201cIf the finger is too greasy or sweaty and the biometric doesn\u2019t go through, the cardholder would experience a small delay and then asked to put in their PIN to complete the transaction,\u201d which is a small price to pay for the benefits. Contactless payment technology will be implemented in future versions \u201cadding to the simplicity and convenience at the checkout. \u201d However, to enroll their fingerprint on the system, customers must visit their bank and register their prints there. Usually, bankcard users are mailed their card, not requiring the extra journey to visit their local branch. MasterCard is \u201cexploring ways to make remote registration possible\u201d at this moment in time, but remote registration may open vulnerabilities in the security system. Karsten Nohl, chief scientist at Berlin\u2019s Security Research Labs, also raised concerns about how secure the system may be. \u201cAll I need is a glass or something you have touched in the past,\u201d he told the BBC. If the information is stolen, \u201cyou only have nine fingerprint changes before you run out of options. \u201d Nohl was however cautiously optimistic despite this, saying that it is \u201cbetter than what we have the moment\u201d: With the combination of chip and PIN, the PIN is the weaker element. Using a fingerprint gets rid of that  \u2026     Fingerprints have helped us avoid using terrible passwords, and even the most gullible person is not going to cut off their finger if [a criminal] asks nicely. This is not the first time MasterCard has experimented with biometrics to increase security and ease for their customers. Last year, they launched MasterCard Identity Check, colloquially known as \u201cselfie pay,\u201d where users would be able to authenticate online transactions by snapping a quick photo of themselves using the camera on their phone or tablet. Given that the fingerprint verification can only be used in store, customers could use the two systems in tandem for their different shopping needs. Full consumer rollout is expected at the end of this year, after two successful trials in South Africa further trials in Europe and East Asia are likely to occur as well, to fully check the functionality of the system.
