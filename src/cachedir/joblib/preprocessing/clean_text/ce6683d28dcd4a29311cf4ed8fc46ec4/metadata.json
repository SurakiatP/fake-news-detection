Trump\u2019s praise of Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president. It also coincided with a growing belief, in Moscow, that Russia faced an imminent threat in Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy. Mrs. Clinton is viewed in Moscow as innately hostile to Russia. Widely held conspiracy theories portray her as seeking to foment unrest that will return Russia to the chaos and depression of the 1990s. Even many government technocrats view her with suspicion that at times verges on paranoia. She referred to these views at an event on Thursday, telling donors that Mr. Putin\u2019s \u201cpersonal beef\u201d with her had driven Russia\u2019s intervention in the American election. Mark Galeotti, a Russia expert at the Institute of International Relations, based in Prague, said the Kremlin was consumed by something more urgent than petty revenge:  . \u201cIt\u2019s not just they didn\u2019t like Clinton, but they actually thought that she represented a threat,\u201d he said, describing Russia\u2019s actions as a matter of \u201cpolicy, not pique. \u201d No one factor can fully explain Russia\u2019s decision to hack and pass on Democratic emails, analysts say, and intelligence agencies appear divided on assessing Russian motives. But, in Moscow, fear of Mrs. Clinton has loomed as large or larger than any warmth for Mr. Trump. Mr. Putin accused Mrs. Clinton of instigating protests against him in late 2011. \u201cShe set the tone for some actors in our country and gave them a signal,\u201d he said, reflecting a widespread view in Moscow that Mrs. Clinton, then secretary of state, had sought to topple Russia\u2019s government. Mr. Putin returned to the presidency a few months later, appearing to believe that the United States had engineered the Middle East\u2019s descent into chaos and was targeting his country to be next. He put Mrs. Clinton at the center of these plots. Mrs. Clinton is indeed more hawkish than other Democrats, including toward Russia. In 2008, while a senator, she mocked President George W. Bush\u2019s claim that he had looked into Mr. Putin\u2019s soul. \u201cI could have told him  \u2014   he was a K. G. B. agent. By definition, he doesn\u2019t have a soul,\u201d Mrs. Clinton joked. The line is still remembered in Moscow. But the Kremlin\u2019s views of Mrs. Clinton go beyond defining her as hawkish. They are also layered with a   Russian belief that American democracy promotion is a ploy to unseat unfriendly governments, that the United States remains bent on Russia\u2019s destabilization or even destruction, and that there is an American hand behind nearly every Russian misfortune. These suspicions go back decades. But, since Mrs. Clinton\u2019s tenure as secretary of state, popular telling has cast her as the culprit responsible for America\u2019s misdeeds and, therefore, Russia\u2019s setbacks. In the summer of 2015, when Russian hacking groups first infiltrated Democratic National Committee servers, I happened to be reporting in Moscow. The American name on everyone\u2019s lips was not Mr. Trump\u2019s, who was already praising Mr. Putin, but rather Mrs. Clinton\u2019s. Fyodor Lukyanov, a prominent Russian foreign policy commentator, told me at the time that there was a widespread view in his country\u2019s government that Mrs. Clinton, as president, would take \u201ca very hostile approach\u201d toward Russia. Consensus in Moscow, Mr. Lukyanov said, was that \u201cHillary is the worst option of any president, maybe worse than any Republican. \u201d It was conventional wisdom, he added, that Mrs. Clinton considered her husband\u2019s efforts to reform Russia in the 1990s an unfinished project, and that she would seek to finish it by encouraging   efforts that would culminate with regime change. This summer, when Russian hacking groups began releasing Democratic emails through third parties such as WikiLeaks, many Americans suspected an effort to help Mr. Trump, who had promised to realign the United States with Russia. But Mr. Galeotti, the Russian expert, said that, in all his time in Moscow, \u201cI didn\u2019t speak to anyone who thought a Trump presidency was possible. \u201d Rather, conversation there followed the same polls that dominated the discussion in America, and which all projected a landslide for Mrs. Clinton. Even as Mr. Putin deemed Mr. Trump \u201ccolorful\u201d and suggested they might get along, officials in Moscow \u201cwere absolutely working from the assumption that Clinton was going to get it,\u201d Mr. Galeotti said. This belief may have informed Russia\u2019s actions during the campaign, which a number of analysts still suspect were aimed at weakening, rather then preventing, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s presumedly imminent presidency. But if Moscow does gain an ally in Mr. Trump, it will lose a foil in Mrs. Clinton  \u2014   something that has been politically useful for Mr. Putin as his country\u2019s economy has sunk and its isolation deepened.'"}, "time": 1742564498.6575425}
