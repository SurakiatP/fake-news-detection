Or just that they think they can promote any fantastical lie or obfuscation and the Kardashian-worshipping American public won\u2019t notice. It\u2019s been reported for days that The Islamic State/al-Qaeda is calling for the \u201cslaughter of U.S. voters\u201d on Election Day. But that didn\u2019t stop officials from designated terrorist group CAIR from inventing a fake potential threat against Muslims\u2026to deflect the fact that the FBI is questioning potential terror-linked suspects in the Muslim community. USA Today Ritz Katz, director of the SITE Intelligence Group, said Saturday on Twitter that the threats appear in an essay carried by the Islamic State\u2019s Al Hayat media center that declares militants \u201chave come to slaughter you and smash your ballot boxes.\u201d 3) #ISIS urges Muslims to refuse participate in #Elections2016 & to announce that they \u201chave come to slaughter you & smash your ballot boxes\u201d \\n\u2014 Rita Katz (@Rita_Katz) November 5, 2016 \u201cMay Allah make this year\u2019s U.S. presidential election a dreadful calamity like no other to have struck America throughout its pathetic history,\u201d the seven-page manifesto, entitled \u201cThe Murtadd Vote ,\u201d read. Murtadd is an apostate who turns his back on Islam. The essay, which uses lengthy religious arguments in an effort to justify such attacks, also declares there is no difference between the Republican and Democratic parties in their \u201cpolicies against Islam and Muslims\u201d In an article from the perpetually Muslim-sympathizing Fusion website: As if Muslim Americans haven\u2019t had it hard enough during this presidential campaign\u2014what with Donald Trump\u2019s steady drumbeat of Islamophobic racism\u2013now comes reports that federal agents are paying surprise visits to Muslims across the United States ahead of the November 8 election. According to officials from the Council on American Islamic Relations, representatives from the FBI have questioned Muslims living in at least eight states leading up to November 8, reportedly searching for information pertaining to a possible Election Day al Qaeda threat . Over the weekend, the designated terrorist group CAIR (Council on American Islamic Relations) received reports from Muslim-Americans in eight states, who said they were approached by FBI agents who wanted to speak to them about the alleged threat. Those states included California, Washington State, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Kansas Oklahoma, Florida and Texas. Hassan Shibly, executive director of CAIR\u2019s Florida offices, called the reported questioning \u201ccompletely outrageous,\u201d and \u201cborderline unconstitutional,\u201d telling the Washington Post : \u201cThat\u2019s the equivalent of the FBI visiting churchgoing Christians because someone overseas was threatening to blow up an abortion clinic. It\u2019s that preposterous and outrageous.\u201d The people who were interviewed this weekend were asked if they knew anyone who might want to harm Americans at home or abroad. Shibly said all of those interviewed appeared to be of Afghani or Pakistani descent. Shibly says such sweeps are dangerous to Muslim-American relations.\u2019Unfortunately we\u2019re dealing with an environment that\u2019s not very friendly to American Muslims,\u2019 he said. \u2018The environment is very hostile to the American Muslim community.\u2019 On Twitter, CAIR\u2019s Dallas-Fort Worth director Alia Salem posted a short video updating her followers about the FBI visits, and offering a series of resources for anyone approached by law enforcement. \u201cIt was made apparent to us that the FBI has a list of a couple hundred people they are wanting to visit,\u201d Salem told the Dallas Morning News . \u201cAnd ask a series of eight generic questions intended to drum up information about the attacks.\u201d The FBI\u2019s sudden scrutiny of Muslim Americans comes as the United States is experiencing a surge in white nationalism and militia groups , fueled in no small part by Donald Trump\u2019s KKK-backed candidacy . Militant Trump supporters have, in fact, explicitly stoked fears of violence come Election Day. (But it\u2019s Muslims who actually carry out terrorist attacks on Americans) \u201cPrior to this campaign season, these ideas were relegated to sort of the political fringe of the American political landscape,\u201d Ryan Lenz, a researcher at the anti-American, Muslim-funded Southern Poverty Law Center told Reuters . \u201cNow these ideas are legitimized.\u201d Perhaps while the FBI is questioning Muslim Americans over vague international threats, they should check in with some of the no-longer-fringe radicals on America\u2019s far right wing, too.'"}, "time": 1742628582.0592105}
