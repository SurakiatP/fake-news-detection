[Gutfeld began with a story of his own: how he met first met Andrew Breitbart while writing for the Huffington Post, which Andrew helped launch and edit. It was when Andrew encouraged Gutfeld to follow his own instincts (as opposed to micromanaging his talent) that the Fox News personality realized that Breitbart had \u201cmajor balls. \u201d  \u201cI remember that, and I remember hearing about you long before I met you because he was fascinated with what you were doing, and what you were writing,\u201d Susie Breitbart said with a chuckle. \u201cHe loved your style, he loved your humor and your insight. He was, I think at that time, also really trying to own who he was, and become his own person, and no longer be in the shadows of people like Matt Drudge and Arianna Huffington. \u201d  \u201cThe way you described him saying \u2018Can you change that?\u2019 and then calling you back and saying \u2018no, wait, keep it the way it is,\u2019 I think that was him sort of coming into his own at the same time and going, \u2018Let\u2019s own this, let\u2019s be who we are,\u2019\u201d she told Gutfeld. Gutfeld credited Andrew Breitbart with writing half of his best jokes. \u201cI would send a piece that would be like, let\u2019s say 1500 words. It would come back 3000 words because he added so many jokes, and some of them were so absurd and surreal and like from another planet that it would take a while to understand what he was doing. Then I would edit it out and I would go, \u2018No, wait, I can\u2019t edit this out, it\u2019s too good!\u201d Gutfeld reminisced. \u201cHe used to call those your double secret blog posts,\u201d Susie Breitbart said. \u201cYou were kind of sneaking in through a back door of the Huffington Post and writing things you weren\u2019t really supposed to. \u201d Gutfeld compared the \u201cunusual group of friends\u201d around Andrew and Susie to the eclectic cast of a \u201c1970s talk show. \u201d \u201cThat was a really interesting group,\u201d Susie agreed. \u201cI can\u2019t remember who initially formed that group. I want to say I think it was Dale Launer, a screenwriter. He wrote My Cousin Vinny, among other things. That group was just an eclectic group of writers and journalists, and not necessarily politically   people. Andrew was always just fascinated with storytellers, loved being around all types of people. \u201d Gutfeld recalled his surprise at learning Susie\u2019s father is prolific actor Orson Bean, \u201cwho was for me kind of a Sixties and Seventies legend because he was on everything. \u201d \u201cHe was!\u201d she agreed. \u201cTo some people my dad was a household name, and some people had never heard of him. He\u2019s so many things to so many different people, because he has done so much. He\u2019s a raconteur, most notably. He hosted The Tonight Show over a hundred times when Johnny Carson was absent, or he was a guest on The Tonight Show within those appearances. He\u2019s been on Broadway, television, movies. He often gets recognized, and it kind of spans across various generations. \u201d \u201cWhen we were growing up, game shows were huge, and they\u2019re making a comeback, a lot of them,\u201d she said, remembering her father\u2019s many appearances on classic shows. \u201cThe Match Game, Tattletales  \u2014   which he did with my mom, Caroline, which was like a couples\u2019 game show. He did To Tell the Truth, and I think Hollywood Squares, all of those were a huge part of my growing up too. \u201d Gutfeld recalled visiting Orson Bean\u2019s house and discovering he kept a news clipping about the   terror attack pinned to his refrigerator door, because he said it was something that should be remembered every day. Susie Bean Breitbart said she believes the clipping holds that position on her father\u2019s refrigerator to this very day. She hastened to add that her father is hardly a brooding man. \u201cHe just finished doing a   show about his life. His life was very heavy and tragic as a child. Throughout the show, he would tell some really, really tragic story  \u2014   and then follow it up immediately with a magic trick and a joke, to sort of lighten the mood,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can watch his   show, it\u2019s on YouTube. That\u2019s his style. \u201d Susie said she was never a political person herself, although her father and later her husband became major political presences. \u201cI always had my opinions, of course, but I was a registered independent from the first time I was old enough to vote. The first time I did vote was for H. Ross Perot, because Andrew and I were just kind of fascinated, and amused, and just trying to figure it all out,\u201d she recalled. \u201cAt that time Andrew was becoming increasingly obsessed with the Clarence Thomas hearings, and politics became more prominent in his life. He became more interested in all of that,\u201d she said.  \u201cI was never political in the way he was. He started to be aware of the effect it was having. He would think, \u2018Susie never signed up for this,\u2019 because as he became more of a public figure people would approach us and say things at dinner parties, and at schools. It\u2019s not something I had really been prepared for,\u201d said Susie Breitbart.  \u201cI think I always knew that Andrew was going to make a name for himself. When we met and started dating, he was a waiter. I looked at him and I said, \u2018This guy\u2019s going to do something.\u2019 He wanted to be a comedy writer, so I figured it was going to be that. He always was very funny. I never figured it would be this, but actually it doesn\u2019t surprise me. It was only a matter of, \u2018What\u2019s he going to do next? What\u2019s he going to be?\u2019 Because it was going to be something,\u201d she said. Gutfeld recalled that politics was almost never the topic of discussion when he hung around with the   Andrew Breitbart. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t angry,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember we all went on the National Review cruise together, and you and Andrew were both panelists, but other than the work you were doing there and the reason we were there, it was really just a vacation with friends. He was a lighthearted person. He could talk to anyone about anything. It didn\u2019t have to be politics,\u201d she said.  \u201cAt some point that became difficult to navigate sometimes. I came home to our first apartment, when we first started dating, to find Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses trying to get out, because they were literally trapped in there. He was so fascinated with exploring people, and stories, and ideas. He could talk to anyone about anything, and he knew something about everything,\u201d she said. Of course, politics came to dominate Andrew Breitbart\u2019s later career, becoming \u201cthe reason people wanted to talk to him in some instances. \u201d Gutfeld remembered Andrew\u2019s particularly strong feelings about 80s New Wave music. \u201cHe had this Friday night Twitter DJ thing that he would do with 80s music,\u201d Susie said. \u201cI\u2019m still not on Twitter, so I wasn\u2019t able to really follow it when it was happening, but he loved it. He was obsessed with New Wave, British pop. \u201d Gutfeld asked for Susie\u2019s take on the most   facet of Andrew\u2019s personality. \u201cI think because he considered himself to be somewhat of a warrior, people assume that he was an instigator,\u201d she observed. \u201cHe really wasn\u2019t a  . He liked people to a fault. It was pretty easy to ingratiate yourself to Andrew. He was someone who felt that he needed to stand up for what was right, and stand up to bullies. There was this very intense   side of him, but the side that people didn\u2019t really get to see when he became more of a public figure was that he was such a lighthearted, funny, crazy, smart, sensitive guy. \u201d \u201cThere is some of that out there,\u201d she added. \u201cHe went on your show Red Eye, and I think tweaked his nipples after snorting a powdered form of red wine or something. \u201d  \u201cThat\u2019s true!\u201d Gutfeld laughed.  \u201cThat\u2019s out there, but I don\u2019t think most people are Googling \u2018Breitbart\u2019 along with the terms \u2018goofy, lighthearted, silly.\u2019 They\u2019re more Googling \u2018controversy, Trump,\u2019 you know,\u201d said Susie. Gutfeld recalled how Andrew was once thrown off his game before a Red Eye appearance because he was worried his daughter was mad at him for leaving a slumber party early. \u201cThat was a bigger deal to him than anything,\u201d Gutfeld said. \u201cAnd he always used to say that he was so lucky he was married to you. He would say to me, \u2018I can\u2019t believe she married me.\u2019 Because we would sit and commiserate over stuff, and he would say that. He would just laugh and go, \u2018How did I get this lucky? \u2019\u201d Gutfeld laughed as he recalled the great downside to Andrew\u2019s easy affection for people: \u201cHe would introduce you to somebody that is not a good person, but he was so forgiving  \u2026     he took in stray dogs, you know what I mean?\u201d \u201cHe did,\u201d Susie agreed. \u201cMy dad always says about his wife Alley when he\u2019s ready to leave a party, he says, \u2018She has a character flaw: She likes people.\u2019 Andrew and I had to develop a kind of shorthand at some point that meant  \u2014   me looking at him which said, \u2018I love you, but I\u2019m ready to go home. I\u2019ll be taking the car, and you can take a taxi in three hours when you\u2019re done talking to this guy. \u2019\u201d \u201cAnd sometimes that guy would come home with him, and he would stay at our house for a weekend,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m not kidding. He would bring people home, and just the way he opens my dad\u2019s guest house to you  \u2026    \u201d \u201cYes! I was one of those stray dogs!\u201d Gutfeld cried. \u201cSometimes we got lucky and the stray dog was Greg Gutfeld. Sometimes it wasn\u2019t so lucky,\u201d said Susie. \u201cHe was really interested in just exploring people\u2019s character and personalities. Sometimes he would delve in without really vetting the situation, I would say. He was a nice person, too. He didn\u2019t want to turn people away, I suppose,\u201d she said. Susie Breitbart said writing has been part of her healing process. \u201cInitially I started writing for my kids, because I want them to remember who he was as a person. It\u2019s so easy, I think of my own childhood so I can conjure up stories when I\u2019m asked, like what was it like growing up with my dad, or whatever,\u201d she recalled.  \u201cReally I feel like most of the time I\u2019m just culling through like a shoebox full of Polaroid pictures, and I have to really make myself remember. So I want to put down these stories on paper for my kids, and I want to collect stories from other people who had personal interactions with Andrew, because I don\u2019t want them to just see the biased tidbits that are out there on the Internet, that really only capture his persona,\u201d she said.  \u201cThey don\u2019t necessarily capture who he was, this whole other side of him,\u201d she maintained. \u201cHe was this intense, and thoughtful, and intelligent person  \u2014   but he was also, like you said, a goofball. I think you referred to him recently as just a big hairy dad. And he was that! He was so many things. He was such a good friend to so many people, and so many people who disagreed with him. He was all of those things. I want them to remember that. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628329.7192457}
