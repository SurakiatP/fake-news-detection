[\u201cThis merciless slaughter of Christians in Egypt tears at our hearts and grieves our souls,\u201d he said, after terrorists shot at a bus, killing at least 28 people.  Trump again criticized the \u201cdepraved, twisted, and thuggish ideology\u201d of terrorists, promising to fight on eliminating them from the world. \u201cThe bloodletting of Christians must end, and all who aid their killers must be punished,\u201d he said. Trump vowed that America would help defend historic Christian communities in the Middle East. \u201cCivilization is at a precipice  \u2014   and whether we climb or fall will be decided by our ability to join together to protect all faiths, all religions, and all innocent life,\u201d he said. Earlier today, President     also responded to the attack. \u201cI direct my appeal to President Trump: I trust you, your word and your ability to make fighting global terror your primary task,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742628294.8731165}
