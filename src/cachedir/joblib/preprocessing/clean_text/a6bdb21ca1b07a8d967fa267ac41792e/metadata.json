[Marlow asked Cuban about his \u201cRadical Transport\u201d Kickstarter campaign to create hoverboards with two key features previous products lacked: they will be made in the U. S. and they will not explode.  \u201cIt\u2019s made in the United States. We have a few parts we have to import, that we couldn\u2019t make here. It\u2019s going to be assembled in Dallas, so it\u2019s going to be made with a lot more care,\u201d Cuban explained. \u201cWe\u2019re   which the previous boards out of China were not,\u201d he noted. \u201cEverything is redesigned. It\u2019s   intellectual property. The previous hoverboards, they were designed to push the price down, be as inexpensive as possible, and appeal to as many kids as possible. We\u2019ve taken a completely different approach:   intellectual property, a whole new design. It\u2019s a lot more responsive. It\u2019s a lot safer from a manufacturing perspective. \u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s a lot more oriented toward   riders, if you will. Believe it or not, there\u2019s a group of people who don\u2019t just want to ride them around the house or the driveway. They want to do tricks and kind of be an alternative to skateboards. That\u2019s the market we\u2019re going after, so they\u2019ll be a little bit more expensive, too,\u201d he said. Cuban said that in all of his companies, \u201cwe\u2019re not allowed to buy anything overseas until we\u2019ve priced it here in the United States first. \u201d \u201cThere are some products we just can\u2019t get here, like with the Mavericks, I can\u2019t get my   all made here. They\u2019re twice as expensive. But anything else, all the tchotchkes, whatever we give away, it always has to be priced here in the United States, just in case something\u2019s changed. If it\u2019s even close, the tie goes to the U. S. A. company,\u201d he said. Marlow saluted Cuban, a supporter of Hillary Clinton in 2016 and critic of President Donald Trump, for appearing on Breitbart News Daily. \u201cI like facilitating dialogue between people who disagree,\u201d said Marlow. \u201cYou\u2019d be shocked at how hard it is to get Hillary supporters to come on a show like this and talk to me. \u201d Cuban in turn applauded Marlow and the Breitbart News Daily crew for welcoming such guests when they do appear. \u201cI agree with you. I take the same approach. I don\u2019t need to go and talk to people who agree with me. We already agree,\u201d he said. \u201cI learn from people who disagree with me. I call it checking my hole card: you know what you have underneath there, but you\u2019re always checking to make sure you\u2019re still being consistent in your thoughts. I want people to challenge me. That\u2019s how I get smarter. That\u2019s how I learn. \u201d \u201cI try not to be an ideologue about anything. If I\u2019m wrong, I\u2019m wrong, and I\u2019m willing to evolve. Coming on a show like this is a great opportunity for me,\u201d he added, stressing that he was not a partisan for the left or the Democratic Party, but an independent. Cuban agreed with Marlow that the healthy exchange of ideas was vital, especially in a time when so many people are living in ideological bubbles or actively calling for the suppression of speech with which they disagree. \u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s necessarily a \u2018crackdown\u2019 on free speech, but I do agree with you that we kind of insulate ourselves and tend to live in our own little bubbles,\u201d he said. \u201cWe tend to see the news with which we agree. To me, that\u2019s a real problem. It was a problem during the election, and it continues to be. \u201d \u201cWhen we have two people that disagree or groups that disagree, if we can have an open dialogue, we both get a chance to get a little smarter, and that\u2019s always a good thing,\u201d he said. Cuban said he could not divulge the details of his private meeting with White House strategist and former Breitbart News executive Steve Bannon months ago. \u201cThe heart of the matter is, I\u2019ve known Steve since the late 90s, early 2000s, when he was in the entertainment business, so it was just a chance to catch up,\u201d he said. \u201cHe ran a company called The Firm, which did a lot of work in Hollywood, so I had occasion to meet with him. We have a good relationship. But again, like us, we don\u2019t have to agree on everything, but we can certainly discuss it all. \u201d Marlow asked if President Trump\u2019s success was inspirational as Cuban pursues his own political ambitions or if it \u201cterrifies you that Trump is the president. \u201d \u201cI would say it inspires me because we\u2019re so different,\u201d Cuban replied, after laughing at the phrasing of the question. \u201cI think the commonality is that we\u2019re both businesspeople, but we take a completely different approach to how we do business. If you\u2019ve read anything I\u2019ve said, I haven\u2019t been a big fan of his approach. I have been a fan of some of his economic policies. \u201d \u201cI\u2019m trying to be   and see what works and what doesn\u2019t work,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of my  \u2014   I wouldn\u2019t call them political aspirations, but more willingness to get out there and talk more about these things  \u2014   is just from my desire to learn and my desire to do what\u2019s best for the country. \u201d Cuban added that as an entrepreneur, he has \u201ca desire to try to help create as many jobs as possible. \u201d \u201cThese days, more than ever, politics and entrepreneurship intersect,\u201d he observed. He thought it was not quite right to say that he and Trump are similar in background and personality but diametrically opposed politically because there are issues upon which they agree. \u201cI believe in lower taxes. I believe in more efficient government. I believe in reducing bureaucracy. I believe that we shouldn\u2019t have lobbyists who can go in or former government workers who can come back and lobby. So in a lot of respects, we\u2019re very much the same,\u201d he said.  \u201cI disagree with him on trade, but I think he\u2019s evolving his trade position. You know, he\u2019s backed off on NAFTA. He\u2019s backed off on the border adjustment tax stuff, at least from initial appearances. He\u2019s not been as aggressive on trying to not work with other countries,\u201d Cuban said of Trump. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of things that we\u2019re on the same page about, but those are more conservative values, I think, than they are Donald Trump values. Where I disagree with him vehemently is that he doesn\u2019t do a good job of communicating, and I don\u2019t think he has great leadership skills. I say that based off of a long history in investing in companies and working with a lot of different corporate leaders. That\u2019s where I really take issue with him,\u201d he explained. Cuban strove to make a distinction between President Trump\u2019s ability to draw large crowds at his rallies and the kind of leadership skills to which he was referring. \u201cGoing to a rally is part of an entertainment and part of a social gathering. More power to him, right? Whether there\u2019s 15 or 50, 000, more power to him for bringing them in, more power for getting them excited. He is a good marketer. He gets credit for that,\u201d Cuban allowed.  \u201cBut once you get the job  \u2014   this may not seem like a great analogy, but trying to get an investor, whether it\u2019s from Shark Tank or me or anybody investing in your company, that\u2019s an accomplishment. But once you get the investment, you have to run the company profitably,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou have to be able to execute on the things that you\u2019ve said the company is going to do. \u201d  \u201cDonald Trump going out there and holding rallies. That\u2019s him bringing in the investors, the voters. Now that he\u2019s been elected, it\u2019s time for him to execute and be a leader and try to take the entire country  \u2014   not just the people who voted for him  \u2014   to a place that\u2019s best for the United States. That\u2019s the challenge for him right now, from my perspective,\u201d he said. Cuban observed that Trump \u201cdidn\u2019t campaign as a politician, but he\u2019s becoming a politician. \u201d \u201cI think there\u2019s a variety of business leaders, from Bill Gates to Warren Buffett to  \u2014   not Mark Zuckerberg, but Sheryl Sandberg, people that I respect as businesspeople. Howard Schultz,\u201d he added, offering some examples of the leadership style he believes Trump should emulate.  \u201cPut aside their politics. They\u2019ve taken companies that have tens of thousands  \u2014   even Rex Tillerson, right? People have taken companies with tens of thousands of employees, and despite the varied political viewpoints of those employees, have put them working together towards a common goal that has led to significant accomplishments for the company and for the people at that company,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the position he\u2019s in right now, that he\u2019s got to achieve. That\u2019s where a lot of people had hoped he would be able to deliver with business acumen and business skills as a leader. I don\u2019t believe he has,\u201d Cuban said of Trump. Marlow asked if Cuban would agree Rex Tillerson was a \u201cbold pick of the president, to put a CEO into the secretary of state position. \u201d \u201cI have no problem with it. I thought it was a good pick, simply because Rex has managed 75, 000 people,\u201d Cuban said. \u201cI had no problem with that pick at all. But now, look at whether Donald Trump, President Trump, is letting Rex Tillerson do his job. We haven\u2019t seen Rex Tillerson stand up and say, \u2018This is my vision for the State Department.\u2019 We haven\u2019t seen him stand up. Where he\u2019s stood up and spoken has almost been a contradiction to what the president has said in terms of policy. \u201d  \u201cAnd so you\u2019re starting to see that bifurcation, those challenges between the people that he\u2019s picked for these cabinet positions and the positions they\u2019re taking when they\u2019re out there doing their jobs and the positions the president has taken when he\u2019s tried to communicate with the people. That\u2019s a problem. That\u2019s a leadership issue,\u201d he argued. Turning to some specific issues, Marlow brought up health care, which he noted Cuban has referred to as a \u201cright. \u201d He asked Cuban to explore that logic by explaining why people don\u2019t have an equivalent \u201cright\u201d to food and housing. \u201cLet\u2019s take a step back,\u201d Cuban began. \u201cFirst of all, we all have to eat, we all need a place to live, and we all get sick. We all play that genetic lottery. No one dies healthy. You\u2019re going to get sick. Everybody you know is going to get sick. \u201d \u201cThe decision we make as a country is, how much are we going to help people when they get sick? Because when someone gets sick and they don\u2019t have the means to pay for their health care, we pay for it anyway,\u201d he contended. \u201cYou pay for it. I pay for it. All taxpayers pay for it, one way or the other. There\u2019s nobody who gets sick and we just let die. There\u2019s nobody that gets sick and there\u2019s no economic consequences. \u201d  \u201cSo from my perspective, the question isn\u2019t is it a right because it\u2019s in the Constitution, or why not food, why not everything else. The question is, what\u2019s the best economic course for the United States? What\u2019s the best economic course for the American people?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe reality is, given we all have to pay for everybody\u2019s health care  \u2014   whether it\u2019s directly or indirectly  \u2014   I\u2019d rather see us just take on this problem and say, \u2018Let\u2019s do it\u2019 in the most   manner. \u201d \u201cAnd because health care, really, we all face the same genetic risk. We all face the same randomness of life risk, where you can be in an accident, et cetera, when you\u2019re able to spread the cost among everybody for  \u2014   not all healthcare issues if you sprain your ankle, that\u2019s on you. If you break your finger, that\u2019s on you, right? But if you get a chronic illness, if you get a serious illness or   illness, that\u2019s something I think we should all share the cost in because we all face the same unknowns and the same risks,\u201d he said.  \u201cAnd when we have people that fall through the cracks, and we don\u2019t pay for them, we end up paying more indirectly. When someone has to go to the hospital because they don\u2019t have insurance  \u2014   and by the way, I think the insurance companies should be out of the mix altogether  \u2014   but when someone needs health care and they don\u2019t have the ability to pay for it, in our communities, we end up paying for it one way or the other. That means my property taxes go up. That means sales taxes go up in order to pay for a local hospital, local medical services, et cetera,\u201d he said.  \u201cI would rather just all of us recognize that these are shared risks and share in paying the costs  \u2014   not for all healthcare issues, like I mentioned, but for chronic and serious injuries and healthcare problems. For everything else, just leave a free and open market. You\u2019re taking the greatest cost away from the insurance companies,\u201d Cuban said.  \u201cNow, the insurance companies will hate it because they\u2019re making twenty percent,\u201d he added. \u201cThey make a twenty percent VIG off of all those costs. Their net income might only be about seven percent, but when insurance companies are doing $180 billion or $160 billion in revenue, that could fall to $30 billion. So they\u2019re going to hate this idea. \u201d  \u201cBut the reality is, we all pay for each others\u2019 health care, directly or indirectly,\u201d he stressed. \u201cAs a businessperson, as an entrepreneur, I\u2019d rather just say, \u2018What\u2019s the best way to solve the problem of health care?\u2019 rather than just putting it all into the government as, \u2018Okay, you come up with Obamacare or an alternative.\u2019 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right way to do it. \u201d Another issue Cuban has been involved with is student loan debt.  \u201cWe\u2019ve got a problem, and I\u2019ve been speaking about this for years,\u201d he said. \u201cI said the same thing to Obama when Secretary Clinton came out with her suggestion that all student loans should basically be dismissed and college should be free. I said that was a bad idea. I told her that was a bad idea. \u201d \u201cRight now, I think the cost of tuition has increased dramatically over the past 20 years, simply because there\u2019s too much easy money to be borrowed for tuition,\u201d he explained. \u201cNow, I have no problem with Pell grants. I have no problem with basic loans, up to $5700, I think it is. But what\u2019s happening now is, private lenders are lending to families thirty, forty, fifty thousand dollars per year in some cases. And because that money is so easy to borrow, it\u2019s really easy just for colleges to continue to increase their tuition. \u201d \u201cI\u2019m not suggesting that we dismiss all loans that students have, even though that\u2019s what some people would like,\u201d he emphasized. \u201cBut what I am suggesting is, if we\u2019re going to arrest the increases and inflation in college tuition and living expenses, we\u2019re going to have to end the easy money. \u201d \u201cWhatever the number is, I\u2019d like to see a cap on the amount of money that a family could borrow in any given year and in total,\u201d he suggested. \u201cIf you do that, the easy money stops for colleges. They have to become more efficient. \u201d  \u201cRight now, particularly big public universities, they\u2019ll have more administrators making over $200, 000 a year than they have teachers or professors making over $200, 000 a year,\u201d Cuban pointed out. \u201cThe economics are just wrong in universities. They\u2019ll have a sociology building, a psychology building, a business building  \u2014   none of which has unique features that are required for their teaching purposes, but they\u2019re there just because a donor paid for them. I think all that just creates tuition inflation, and that needs to change. \u201d Cuban disagreed with Marlow that too many university resources are devoted to liberal arts classes that have few applications in the working world. \u201cI think right now the argument could be made that liberal arts majors aren\u2019t going to make as much, and it\u2019s far more difficult to get a job,\u201d he countered. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to go through a complete change in the nature of work over the next five to ten years. \u201d  \u201cWhat\u2019s happening with artificial intelligence and its derivatives and robotics, machine learning, deep learning, neural networks  \u2014   if you work for software, or if you are in a position that you\u2019re doing the same job, or it\u2019s a repetitive job, over and over, or if you\u2019re in a   job  \u2014   if this, then that  \u2014   there\u2019s a good chance your job\u2019s going to be displaced over the next ten years,\u201d he predicted.  \u201cAs we get more into a machine   learning environment, we\u2019re going to need more free thinkers who know how to use data than we\u2019ll need people who maybe were bookkeepers or accountants, even some lawyers. Those jobs, because they\u2019re   there\u2019s not going to be a need for those. We\u2019re literally going to have machines more capable of doing that. It used to be that we told machines what to do. Now we\u2019re asking machines what to do,\u201d said Cuban. Marlow clarified that he was concerned about students who incur enormous debt earning degrees that offer them no real prospect of repaying the debt through gainful employment. He cited someone he knows personally who incurred $200, 000 in student loan debt to earn a Women\u2019s and Gender Studies degree, realized it was of little use to her career ambitions, and started over as a medical student, studying alongside his wife. \u201cTwo questions there,\u201d Cuban responded. \u201cOne, she went to the wrong school. She went to a school that was too expensive. She didn\u2019t go to a school she could afford. That was the first issue, and that was her choice. She\u2019s obviously dealing with the consequences. \u201d \u201cTwo, it\u2019s all going to change. We don\u2019t know what the best jobs are going to be in ten years, for the reasons I mentioned earlier,\u201d he continued. \u201cBetween robotics and deep   learning, not to get too technical, the nature of work is going to change. There\u2019s going to be significant displacement. I don\u2019t have a relationship with the administration, but the people I know that work in and around the White House that I have been able to talk to, that\u2019s the overriding theme that I\u2019ve been preaching to them. \u201d \u201cThis goes back to an issue I have with President Trump: he doesn\u2019t have a curiosity to learn. He doesn\u2019t a quest for knowledge,\u201d Cuban charged. \u201cPart of that has led to his excitement over creating factories and what he calls \u2018bringing in jobs.\u2019 The reality is  \u2014   write this down  \u2014   look at the companies that he is saying are opening up factories, and make a note for their total employment the day he makes an announcement  \u2014   whether it\u2019s Ford, GM, whoever it may be. And then two years from now, look at the total employments for those companies. I guarantee you, the total number of employees for those companies will be down because the factories that President Trump is so excited about will lead to fewer jobs, not more jobs. \u201d  \u201cTechnology marches on,\u201d he mused. \u201cThat\u2019s not a bad thing. I\u2019d rather have that technology be hosted in the United States, where we have some level of control over our own destiny, than those factores be created in China where they are being created, and they are changing the cost and the nature of work there already. The point being that unless you recognize the changes and disruption that are coming in the very short term, it\u2019s going to be very difficult to say, \u2018Okay, this is the type of classes you should take. \u2019\u201d  \u201cAnd so I\u2019ve said publicly, I don\u2019t have a problem with a women\u2019s studies major if they\u2019re smart, if they\u2019re inquisitive, if they\u2019re willing to continue to learn. I tell this to all my friends and their kids, et cetera, and my own kids  \u2014   my oldest is 13  \u2014   the greatest skill that you can have is a thirst for knowledge, loving and learning how to learn because things are going to be changing so dramatically over the next ten years in terms of technology that we don\u2019t know what the best jobs are going to be. So we\u2019re all going to have to continue to learn how to find new skills,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, your wife and her friend, they\u2019re in great shape. You talk about, going back a little bit to health care, if it was up to me, one of the programs I would start is a program that paid to have more doctors because if we\u2019re going to push down the cost of health care, we should subsidize the cost of medical school  \u2014   not to any amount that the school would charge us, but offer your wife $50, 000 a year, and make it available not just to her, but so that instead of there being 90, 000 med students in school in any given year, there are 180, 000 med students in school in any given year. We spend the $900 million or $1 billion a year, whatever it may be, knowing that that increased competition, because we have more doctors, is going to push down the cost of medical care,\u201d said Cuban.  \u201cThose are the types of things that I think, if we start to anticipate what\u2019s coming down the pike in the future, we can be smarter and have an impact on health care, on insurance costs, on medical costs. There\u2019s just so many things that we can do. Again, I\u2019ll go back to the president: these aren\u2019t the types of conversations that are being held in the White House. They\u2019re looking backwards to the way things used to be and trying to recreate those, as opposed to looking forward to the way things should be,\u201d he said.
