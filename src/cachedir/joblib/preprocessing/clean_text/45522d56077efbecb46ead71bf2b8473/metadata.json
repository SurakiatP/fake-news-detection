[Hoping to form a parliamentary pact with the DUP after the Conservatives\u2019 collapse in seats following last week\u2019s snap general election, negotiators from Theresa May\u2019s Tories have been hammering out a deal with the   group Tuesday, in the second day of official talks.  Speaking to the BBC about the progress in negotiations, DUP boss Arlene Foster declined to \u201cnegotiate on the airwaves\u201d but praised progress, and gave insight into the areas over which the agreement was being made. She said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had some very good discussions again today, and these discussions continued into the afternoon. I hope we can reach a conclusion sooner rather than later. \u201d Hope we can reach a conclusion \u201dsooner rather than later\u201d  \u2014   DUP leader Arlene Foster on talks with PM Theresa May https:  .  pic. twitter.   \u2014   BBC News (UK) (@BBCNews) June 13, 2017,  In words apparently chosen to reassure both her voters in Ulster and politicians in Westminster, Foster said: \u201cIt won\u2019t surprise anyone that we\u2019re talking about matters that pertain to the nation generally, bringing stability to the UK government, in and around issued around Brexit, obviously around  . \u201d Discussions are going well with the government and we hope soon to be able to bring this work to a successful conclusion.  \u2014   Arlene Foster (@DUPleader) June 13, 2017,  As for what she expected in return for supporting the Conservative government, Foster said she had discussed \u201cdoing what\u2019s right for Northern Ireland with respect to economic matters\u201d. This remark could refer to points within the DUP manifesto that aim to make Northern Ireland more competitive for businesses than their southern neighbour, the Republic of Ireland. Amongst those initiatives is a cut of corporation tax to 12. 5 per cent  \u2014   well below the Conservative goal of 17 per cent and the present figure of 19 per cent. More outlandish is the establishment of \u201cfreeports\u201d  \u2014   tax and customs free trading areas  \u2014   in \u201ceconomically underdeveloped parts of the UK\u201d a sure euphemism for Ulster. Other ambitions laid out within the DUP manifesto while   for traditional conservatives have caused consternation amongst Britain\u2019s political left. The manifesto promise to \u201cfreeze then cut or abolish the TV licence\u201d and the possibility it may be a price demanded by the DUP for supporting the government, has so worried Labour deputy leader Tom Watson he was motivated to appeal to the Conservatives Tuesday that they would pledge not to scrap the licence fee. Writing to Conservative Culture Minister Karen Brady, Watson said: \u201cThe DUP\u2019s manifesto includes a commitment to \u2018freeze then cut or abolish the TV licence\u2019  \u2026     I urge you to fight hard to ensure that this pledge is not included in any agreement, formal or otherwise, between the Conservative Party and the DUP,\u201d reports The Guardian. Slamming the BBC\u2019s main source of income, a levy on all homes which have a working television set whether they watch BBC programming or not, the DUP manifesto said: \u201cThe TV licence fee is a highly regressive tax which was designed for a different era and a world of communications that no longer exists. The success of Netflix and Amazon streaming services shows that   media can and does work. \u201d  '"}, "time": 1742563300.3319654}
