The only other abstention, besides the US, was Israel. The vote is non-binding but it can have political weight. \\nCuba\u2019s Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez described the abstention as a \u201cpositive step for the future of improving relations between the United States and Cuba,\u201d according to Reuters. \\nRodriguez said in September that the embargo cost Cuba $4.6 billion last year, and the full damage over the length of the 50-year embargo was estimated at $125.9 billion. \\nWhen it was first announced that the US government would abstain from the vote, the entire General Assembly applauded. \\n\u201cAbstaining on this resolution does not mean that the United States agrees with all of the policies and practices of the Cuban government. We do not,\u201d Samantha Power the US Ambassador to the United Nations told the General Assembly on Tuesday. \\n\u201cWe are profoundly concerned by the serious human rights violations that the Cuban government continues to commit with impunity against its own people,\u201d she said, according to AP. \\nThe Obama administration began normalizing relations with the Communist-run country in at the end of 2014, easing trade and travel restrictions. On July 20, 2015, diplomatic relations were restored, and embassies in the two countries were reopened. \\nLifting the full embargo will take the support of the Republican-run Congress, which remains critical of the administration\u2019s efforts, arguing it offered too many concessions to Cuba and accepted little in return, especially on human rights and the restoration of expropriated property. \\nObama made the first visit to Havana by a US president in 88 years in March. \\nVia RT .
