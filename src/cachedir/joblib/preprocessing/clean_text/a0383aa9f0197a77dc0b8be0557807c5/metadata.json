One Bank May Pull Funding of Pipeline Build \\nWhile all eyes have been on the recent election results, protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline achieved a quiet victory. One bank may be pulling its investments in the project, leaving the Dakota Access Pipeline with very little money to continue its build. \\n\\nDNB, Norway\u2019s largest bank, has reportedly loaned $350 million to Energy Transfer Partners (ETP) for the construction of the pipeline.The bank is worried that Indigenous rights are being overlooked by Energy Transfer Partners. \\n\\nDNB states that it will take initiative and use its position to try to find a constructive solution to the conflict. If the bank finds that these initiatives do not give appeasing answers or results, DNB will consider ending its involvement in financing the project. \\n\\nViolence by police against protesters drove the bank to review its investment in the controversial pipeline. \\n\\nAs knowledge about what is going on in North Dakota reaches international countries, corporations are forced to question their own involvement in the pipeline build. \\n\\nStanding Rock Sioux Tribe members, Indigenous peoples from First Nations around the planet, activists, and even well-known reporters and move stars are all speaking out against the Dakota Access Pipeline. Protesters have occupied several camps along the Missouri River near Cannon Ball, and North Dakota. \\n\\nThe protests have a history of police violence against peaceful protesters. ETP hired private security mercenaries who were untrained. These employees unleashed vicious dogs on crowds of unarmed protesters and at least 6 were mauled. \\n\\nSince then, militarized police with tanks have replaced mercenaries. Activists have been pepper-sprayed, maced, beaten, shot with bean bag projectiles and rubber bullets, tasered, blasted by LRAD and sound cannons, and have been strip-searched, detained in dog kennels, had their arms marked with numbers, and more. \\n\\nPolice violence and tactics have been so bad that even representatives from the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues have been amassing testimony from witnesses and victims about excessive force, unlawful arrests, and mistreatment in jail. \\n\\nAmnesty International USA brought human rights observers to monitor the situation. \\n\\nETP has brazenly ignored requests by President Obama and several federal officials for ETP to halt construction until a tribal lawsuit and permit reviews conclude. \\n\\nDuring the chaos of Election Day, ETP announced it will be moving forward with drilling to begin installation of the pipeline beneath Lake Oahe in only two weeks, hinting that it would do so with or without appropriate permits. \\n\\nDNB views these acts as unacceptable and will likely revoke its financial support if ETP continues to ignore Indigenous requests. \\n\\nIf DNB withdraws its financial support, the bold move could inspire other major investors to follow suit, especially if the public continues to apply pressure. \\n\\nAriana Marisol is a contributing staff writer for REALfarmacy.com.
