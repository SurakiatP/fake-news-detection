They\u2019re members of the Upper Room, a black church in San Diego, who clearly do much good helping the sick and the elderly. There\u2019s no place for error (especially regarding sexual morality) in their eyes, which means that they are particularly hard on the younger generation that has grown up with a less rigid sense of promiscuity. Their harsh condemnation is strong enough to destroy the very church that has been the center of their friendships, their religious community. Since the time frame for the novel is contemporary\u2014or quite recently\u2014the women referred to in the title also represent a dying breed, presumably the final generation with such religious dedication. I felt the same way about The Mothers as I did about J. D. Vance\u2019s Hillbilly Elegy (which I reviewed in CounterPunch , September 16 th ): another pocket of America that has been left behind. Hard to tell if this is reason for celebration or consternation. \\nThe adult male of major consequence in the story is Robert Turner, known \u201caround Upper Room as the man with the truck, a black Chevy pickup that had become Upper Room\u2019s truck because of how often Robert was seen driving from church, an arm hanging out of the window, the truck bed filled with food baskets or donated clothes or metal chairs.\u201d He\u2019s a good man, who can always be relied upon to lend a helping hand. Even Robert himself believed that his truck \u201chad turned things around for him,\u201d because his wife blew her brains out, and his truck made it possible for him to help others and get his mind off his own pain. No explanation is ever provided for the woman\u2019s suicide. \\nThe Upper Room is successful, a bulwark for part of the city\u2019s black population. Pastor Sheppard and his wife, Latrice (known as \u201cFirst Lady\u201d) are models of decorum. The story\u2019s focus is not race but morality, though an occasional glib remark does place the story within a racial context. The first family\u2019s son, Luke, is, indeed, the stereotypical wild young man, whose father is a preacher. Luke is described as \u201creckless,\u201d followed by a remark that brings up race: \u201cBlack boys couldn\u2019t afford to be reckless,\u201d his mother told him. \u201cReckless white boys became politicians and bankers, reckless black boys became dead.\u201d The major theme of the novel is extended a few paragraphs later. \u201cA daughter grows older and draws nearer to her mother, until she gradually overlaps like a sewing pattern. But a son becomes some irreparably separate thing.\u201d That\u2019s some rather nice writing. \\nBennett illustrates her observation by shifting the narration to Luke and Nadia Turner, motherless because of her mother\u2019s suicide. Luke was a star athlete, but a broken leg on the football field ended his scholarship and, hence, his academic career. He\u2019s returned home, to live with his parents, and assist in their work at the Upper Room. Nadia, who is several years younger, has been awarded a scholarship to go to Michigan, but she earned the scholarship because of her intellect, not for athletics. The predictable occurs. Luke gets Nadia pregnant, which might not be such an awful thing were it not for Luke\u2019s religious upbringing. \\nThereafter, the story probes numerous layers of guilt involving the characters already mentioned, in part because of Nadia\u2019s decision to have an abortion. She leaves her community to attend the university in Michigan, then goes on to earn a law degree. Luke stays in San Diego, holding down various positions that are mostly unrewarding. Both of them were friends, at separate times, of another young woman named Aubrey, and the lives of all three become gnarled together, mostly because of deceit. It takes a number of years before the errors of the past become known to all three of them, and\u2014when it does\u2014new jealousies and additional guilt emerge. All three lives are also entwined with the Upper Room, which largely becomes a cage for them, not the liberating force it might have become. \\nThe attitudes toward religion in The Mothers (\u201cAnyone knows a church is only as good as its women, and when we all passed on to glory, who would hold this church up\u201d) are conflicting, largely because of the times in which we live. The novel has appeared with an enormous amount of hype that I\u2019m not certain it deserved. The story itself peters out well before you turn the final page.'"}, "time": 1742628532.9554975}
