[\u201cSobering briefing,\u201d tweeted Sen. Steve Daines ( ) after the briefing, hosted by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats. The President also briefly attended the event.  Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) called it an \u201cimportant\u201d meeting. \u201cWe will never accept North Korea as a legitimate nuclear weapons power,\u201d he tweeted. Just returned to Capitol.  Sobering briefing. https:  .   \u2014   Steve Daines (@SteveDaines) April 26, 2017,  Just attended important @WhiteHouse meeting on #NorthKorea. We will never accept North Korea as a legitimate nuclear weapons power.  \u2014   Senator Rubio Press (@SenRubioPress) April 26, 2017,  Sen. John Barrasso ( ) told NBC News that North Korea\u2019s \u201ccapacity is increasing and has increased significantly. \u201d After the meeting, Tillerson, Mattis, and Coats released a statement, calling North Korea\u2019s pursuit of nuclear weapons an \u201curgent national security threat and top foreign policy priority\u201d: Just weeks after Trump took office, North Korea   a   ballistic missile, on February 11. The regime then launched four ballistic missiles on March 6. On April 5, it launched another missile. The tests, in defiance of international law, show progress in North Korea\u2019s illicit nuclear weapons program. Earlier this year, North Korea fired a missile using solid fuel, which makes it harder to detect before launch. North Korea\u2019s leader Kim   has vowed to obtain a nuclear weapon that can hit the U. S. homeland, and Trump has warned that it will not happen during his watch. The White House meeting was highly atypical. In the previous administration, the White House would often send senior officials to Capitol Hill to brief lawmakers, as opposed to inviting them to the White House. While some critics argued the briefings were little more than a photo opportunity, others  \u2014   including Sen. David Perdue ( )  \u2014    praised the White House for inviting both Democrats and Republicans to the briefing, and for trying to engage with senators.

Roger Wicker ( ) after the meeting, also praised the president, saying he \u201cdeserves credit for updating the entire Senate. \u201d \u201cThe Administration\u2019s decision to hold this   briefing at the White House indicates the seriousness of the threat,\u201d he said in a statement. Sen. Todd Young ( .) called North Korea a \u201cgrave\u201d and \u201curgent threat. \u201d Democrats were more critical. Sen. Ed Markey ( ) said on NBC News it was \u201cheartening\u201d that there was more talk about diplomacy, but said it was in the context of more U. S. military exercises in the region and expressed concern about an \u201caccidental war. \u201d After the Senate meeting was announced, the White House decided to hold a briefing for members of the House, but at the Capitol. Senators were bussed over to the briefing, which took place in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on the White House grounds. The meeting occurred as the U. S. continued to deploy parts of a missile defense system to South Korea, known as the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD). U. S. Pacific Command Commander Adm. Harry Harris said earlier in the day that the system would be operational \u201cin the coming days. \u201d Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) after the meeting tweeted that it was \u201ctime to  \u201d North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism, following a Reuters report saying that the administration was considering doing so.
