He stood up for his teacher when his peer punched her in the face. This young man is certainly respectable! \\nA shocking video has emerged showing the moment a protective student knocked out a classmate who had just attacked their female teacher. The footage shows that the teacher was trying to break up a fight between two students \u2013 one in a red hoodie and one in a black hoodie \u2013 when the boy in the red turns around and hits her in the face. The teacher, dressed in white and wearing glasses, appears to fall to the ground after being hit, and then leaves the classroom. \\nThen, a third student comes in and punches the boy in head, sending him straight down to the ground. The third student is heard saying: \u2018Watch the f\u2014 out, you just hit the fucking teacher.\u2019 He then adds: \u2018Chill your s\u2014, you just hit the f\u2014ing teacher, you don\u2019t f\u2014ing do that. Who the f\u2014 do you think you are?\u2019 \\nThe teacher then reappears in the room, and appears relatively unscathed. She tells the group to stop fighting and separate.\u2018He just f\u2014ing hit you, that\u2019s not cool,\u2019 says the boy that came to her defense.\u2018It\u2019s not cool,\u2019 the teacher replies. It is unclear where the video was filmed or what school was involved, however the clip was spreading quickly on social media on Wednesday after appearing on the website LiveLeak. Some viewers questioned whether the boy in red may have mistakenly hit the teacher, believing she were the other one of the students. However others said he clearly meant to hit the woman. \\nShout out to the boy for standing up for what is right! Related Items'"}, "time": 1742561700.2508154}
