Now that he\u2019s been sworn in, I\u2019m eager to help him build a Supreme Court that will overturn Roe v. Wade and wipe out the \u201cabortion distortion\u201d that has plagued judicial rulings for decades. So when it comes to filling Justice Scalia\u2019s vacancy, it\u2019s essential to assess how the various candidates on President Trump\u2019s Supreme Court list measure up on that score. [That\u2019s why I must respectfully disagree with Andy Schlafly, son of the late and great Phyllis Schlafly, whose vocal opposition to almost all of the candidates on President Trump\u2019s list has caused confusion and consternation among   activists. Schlafly claims there is only one candidate among the 21 on the President\u2019s list worthy of his endorsement.  Even candidates like 11th Circuit Judge William Pryor, who has decried Roe v. Wade as the \u201cworst abomination in the history of constitutional law\u201d and as having \u201cled to the slaughter of millions of innocent unborn children,\u201d do not satisfy Schlafly\u2019s qualifications. Pryor has won my approval, and has strong backing from Federalist Society, Alliance Defending Freedom and others whose opinion I highly value. Phyllis Schlafly herself helped put several candidates on President Trump\u2019s list. She praised them as \u201c . \u201d Former Scalia clerk Ed Whelan (who has long argued for Roe to be overruled) has thoroughly argued against Schlafly\u2019s criticisms. Last week Whelan wrote a response to Schlafly\u2019s condemnation of 10th Circuit Judge Neil Gorsuch pointing out that Gorsuch, in a powerful opinion, argued for allowing the state of Utah to defund Planned Parenthood, America\u2019s largest abortion business. Gorsuch has written a doctoral dissertation and a book arguing against assisted suicide and euthanasia and has also declared that \u201chuman life is fundamentally and inherently valuable, and that the intentional taking of human life by private persons is always wrong. \u201d Further, Gorsuch strongly supported the   rights of Hobby Lobby and the Little Sisters of the Poor against the HHS mandate on abortifacient drugs and devices. Schlafly claims that Gorsuch \u201cthinks courts should not correct their own mistaken precedents. \u201d But the sentence written by Gorsuch quoted by Schlafly, from the panel ruling in a case United States v.   goes on to call for his court to overturn its wrong precedent. Schlafly also criticizes the Federalist Society for not being, and never being,  . The Federalist Society doesn\u2019t take institutional positions on any issues. But Justice Scalia helped to found the Federalist Society and remained a good friend of it until his death, precisely because of the sound legal principles that the Federalist Society helps to promote. I have every confidence that the Federalist Society is helping President Trump fulfill his pledge to appoint   justices. Truth is the   movement\u2019s strongest ally in our fight to change hearts and minds in the culture while also building protections for the unborn into our nation\u2019s law.  The names being surfaced as finalists for President Trump\u2019s Supreme Court pick provide an historic opportunity to fill the Supreme Court with strong Constitutionalists who would defend the right to life of Americans born and unborn. Marjorie Dannenfelser is the president of the Susan B. Anthony List. '"}, "time": 1742561899.1618135}
