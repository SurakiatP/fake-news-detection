In fact, it seems she has vanished. The next tweet features another \u201cmissing person\u201d style meme and notes, \u201c According to the Clinton Foundation, she was recently believed to be suicidal, however, Huma has no history of depression. \u201d Clearly, the creator was taking a sarcastic jab at the impossible coincidence that so many people close to the Clintons have committed suicide. \\n\u2014 Ben Dihya (@bendyhya) October 30, 2016 \\nSome reports assume that she\u2019s dropped out of the public eye and is holed up with lawyers, trying to come up with a plan to save her own ass. Others wonder if she\u2019s fled the country or is otherwise in hiding in fear of Hillary\u2019s retaliation. Meme created for the #SaveHuma internet campaign.

The idea of poetic justice being served up to Hillary Clinton and any person who aided and abetted her criminal acts\u00c2 is a very popular notion these days. \\nNow that the FBI has\u00c2 what is most likely the missing 33,000 emails, we can be reasonably sure that actual, lawful justice is on the horizon as well, and there isn\u2019t a hashtag on Earth that will be able to save Crooked Hillary or her favorite minion, Huma, from facing the consequences of their actions.'"}, "time": 1742563484.105576}
