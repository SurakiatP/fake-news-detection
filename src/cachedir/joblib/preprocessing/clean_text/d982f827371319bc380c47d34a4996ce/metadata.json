In 20 more miles, the crack will reach all the way across the ice shelf in a full break that will create one of the largest icebergs ever recorded  \u2014   and, even more troubling, imperil the buttressing that keeps glaciers from flowing into the ocean. _____ \u2022 In Hong Kong, a group of urban explorers uses stealth and drones as they peel back layers of history to forge video archives of the city\u2019s   buildings before they are razed.

[The New York Times] \u2022 President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines berated more than 200 police officers on national television, calling them \u201crotten to the core\u201d and ordering them to resign or be shipped off to a terrorist hotbed known for beheadings and police attacks.

[Reuters] \u2022 China\u2019s participation in a Vatican conference on organ trafficking is being criticized. Some doubt that the Chinese government is abiding by its announcement two years ago that it had stopped harvesting organs from executed prisoners. [The New York Times] \u2022 Steve Bannon, the chief adviser to President Trump, has cultivated alliances with traditionalists in the Vatican who share his low opinion of Pope Francis.

Gambia\u2019s former President Yahya Jammeh once pledged that he would reign for a billion years. But last month he fled into exile, 22 years after taking power in a coup. His democratically elected successor has since accused Mr. Jammeh, above, of plundering the treasury and fleeing with millions of dollars. A   source of income for Mr. Jammeh, though, had been a   scheme. For years, his government sold residence permits  \u2014   sometimes costing up to $15, 000 apiece  \u2014   to thousands of Chinese millionaires. Why? A special program meant to encourage investment in Hong Kong allowed wealthy Chinese citizens to gain the right to live there if they had permanent residence in another country. As of 2013, some 9, 000 Chinese obtained residence permits for Gambia. The maneuvering went on until 2015, when Hong Kong suspended the program. A review found that many of the people enrolled didn\u2019t eventually settle in Hong Kong. Instead, they used their Hong Kong passports for easier travel to other countries (but probably not Gambia).
