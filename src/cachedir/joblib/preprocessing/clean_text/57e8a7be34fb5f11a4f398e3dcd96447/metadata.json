Meanwhile, the   is on Twitter again, threatening the Cuba thaw and lobbing voter fraud charges. David H. Petraeus, the retired general who led the C. I. A. met Monday with   Trump, and it appears he really would like to be secretary of state. \u201cI was with him for about an hour,\u201d Mr. Petraeus told reporters. \u201cHe basically walked us around the world, showed a great grasp of a variety of the challenges that are out there and some of the opportunities as well. Very good conversation, and we\u2019ll see where it goes from here. \u201d The   returned the compliment. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, is up next with a meeting in Trump Tower on Tuesday. And Mitt Romney is set to have dinner with the   on Tuesday night. Mr. Romney is the preferred choice of Vice   Mike Pence and some business leaders from whom Mr. Trump has heard. But contention over him being chosen has led Mr. Trump\u2019s aides to open the process to other names, such as Mr. Corker. Typical of the pushback, L. Brent Bozell, a conservative media critic, said in a statement: The   camp is doing its own pushback. A person briefed on the process, who asked to remain anonymous to discuss sensitive conversations, said that Mr. Romney had not sought consideration for the secretary of state, and was initially contacted by Mr. Pence. In that first conversation, Mr. Romney made clear to Mr. Pence that he would accept the position if the incoming president offered it, the person said, contradicting the claim from others in Mr. Trump\u2019s circle who are opposed to the potential appointment. The debate over Mr. Romney  \u2014   and before him, Rudolph W. Giuliani  \u2014   has given an opening to Mr. Petraeus, despite the cloud of scandal that still hangs over him for sharing classified information during an extramarital affair. The   has not held his punches in denouncing the predations of Fidel Castro, the late Cuban dictator, but he seemed to be keeping his options open on President Obama\u2019s diplomatic thaw with the communist Caribbean nation. On Monday, via Twitter, Mr. Trump lobbed a threat about that. Josh Earnest, the White House spokesman, isn\u2019t mourning Mr. Obama\u2019s initiative just yet though. There will soon be 110 daily flights from the United States to Cuba, and cruise, tour and hotel operators have already invested significant sums in infrastructure to support those visits. Citizens in Cuba and the United States overwhelmingly support the new policy, Mr. Earnest said. \u201cSo unrolling all of that is much more complicated than just the stroke of a pen,\u201d Mr. Earnest said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s just not as simple as one tweet might make it seem. \u201d As a recount proceeds in Wisconsin, Michigan officially certified its results on Monday: Mr. Trump beat Hillary Clinton by 10, 704 votes, or 0. 2 percentage points. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s overall popular vote lead stands at 2, 241, 834. Mr. Earnest confirmed Monday that President Obama and   Trump had spoken for 45 minutes on Saturday after Mr. Obama returned a call from the man who will succeed him. \u201cPresident Obama has been doing this job for eight years, and he\u2019s learned a lot about the kind of challenges a person in that job faces,\u201d Mr. Earnest said. But what are they talking about? Mr. Trump has hinted that Mr. Obama has told him of one big foreign policy concern: North Korea. And for good reason: The autocratic government there is pressing ahead with efforts to develop a   missile that could reach American soil a corruption crisis has paralyzed South Korea\u2019s government and Washington will soon be led by a new president with no governmental experience. When   Trump claimed on Twitter that he was losing the popular vote because of massive voter fraud by millions of voters, one of the states he pointed to was California, where the latest voting returns showed Hillary Clinton crushing Mr. Trump. Now the state\u2019s top election official, Alex Padilla, has responded. Mr. Padilla asserted that there was no evidence for the  \u2019s claim, and he denounced Mr. Trump for what he said was unpresidential behavior. This state has historically been slow to count ballots, a reflection of its size and the inefficiencies of many county voting operations. As of Saturday, Mrs. Clinton had received 8. 1 million votes in California, compared with 4. 2 million for Mr. Trump, according to Mr. Padilla\u2019s office. It was not clear when the vote count would be concluded. Mr. Padilla is the   Latino elected to state office in California. Mr. Trump\u2019s poor showing there, many Democrats and Republicans said, came in no small part because of his attacks on what he described as the threat of illegal immigration  \u2014   particularly from Mexicans. About 40 percent of this state\u2019s population is Latino. Citing what they called Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cshocking level of disdain for legitimate bipartisan concerns\u201d over conflicts of interest, the Democratic members of the House Oversight Committee on Monday formally requested that the committee\u2019s chairman open a review of the  \u2019s web of global business interests. Oh, and they\u2019d like copies of the tax returns that Mr. Trump has refused to release. The  \u2019s elegant new hotel, built in the Old Post Office building on Pennsylvania Avenue near the White House, has finally secured its second restaurant. The space at the Trump International Hotel has been empty since the celebrity chefs Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s and Geoffrey Zakarian backed out in protest of Mr. Trump\u2019s incendiary comments about Mexican immigrants during the campaign, prompting legal action by the Trump organization. Now, Nakazawa, a Japanese omakase bar and dining room, is stepping up with a new restaurant, to be opened by next summer. \u201cMy decisions are not clouded by political views or what I feel in my heart, right or wrong,\u201d Alessandro Borgognone, Nakazawa\u2019s owner, told Washingtonian magazine. \u201cAnytime that we decide something on business, it\u2019s what\u2019s best for the business. \u201d The 114th Congress returns to Washington this week for one big order of business  \u2014   besides keeping the government\u2019s lights on. In one of its final and most significant acts, the House on Wednesday is set to pass the 21st Century Cures Act, an ambitious and pricey initiative that would deregulate some forms of drugs and medical devices and would fund President Obama\u2019s cancer \u201cmoonshot,\u201d Alzheimer\u2019s research, regenerative medicine and efforts to address opioid addiction. The agreement, reached between House and Senate negotiators over the Thanksgiving break, should be passed next month by the Senate. The legislation\u2019s total funding for the National Institutes of Health is $4. 8 billion, a reduction from what the House sought last year. The bill, large as it is, is expected to pass with little debate and lots of lobbying fingerprints  \u2014   and a bipartisan nod to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. who wanted the moonshot. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader and longtime head of the embattled House Democrats, faces something of a reckoning this week. Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio, a burly former high school football player from Youngstown, has had the temerity to challenge her for the minority leader post, saying the party needs to face the reality that Hillary Clinton\u2019s losses in Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania show that Democrats have lost touch with their   roots. Even if, as likely, Ms. Pelosi survives the vote on Wednesday, she has shown vulnerability. The leadership slate that she has introduced includes Representative Cheri Bustos of a   corner of Illinois. In a letter to colleagues, she introduced her as \u201ca leader representing the Heartland\u201d who \u201chas fought for manufacturing jobs and the needs of our veterans in rural America. \u201d Another offering? Representative Matt Cartwright, who \u201cknows how to take the concerns of his constituents in   Pennsylvania and translate them into a message that moves people. \u201d The pushback? The Congressional Black Caucus fears its own power is being diluted.'"}, "time": 1742563423.6921272}
