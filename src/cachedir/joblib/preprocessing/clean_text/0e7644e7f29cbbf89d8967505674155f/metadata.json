{"duration": 0.1451125144958496, "input_args": {"text": "'Even though Selina Meyer is the leader of the free world and, also, a woman, \u201cVeep\u201d rarely digs deeply into the gender politics that affect women in positions of power. The show has subtly highlighted the fact that Selina has to worry about her haircuts, her acne and the visibility of the bags under her eyes to a degree that most men officials probably don\u2019t. We\u2019ve also seen her male political colleagues underestimate her on more than one occasion. But most of the time, she and her staff are too busy dealing with things like teleprompter   and data breaches to directly address the sexism that a woman of Selina\u2019s stature would likely confront on a daily basis. That changes in this week\u2019s episode, in which Selina handles several crises unique to a woman POTUS. For starters, there\u2019s that Politico story that claims that a member of the White House staff referred to the president using That Word. (I say That Word because the word in question  \u2014   the most insulting thing a woman can be called  \u2014   is unfit for print here.) Selina instructs Amy, the only woman in her inner circle of advisers, to find out who\u2019s responsible for calling her such a derogatory name. Not surprisingly, it quickly becomes clear that Amy and almost everyone else in that aforementioned inner circle has recently used That Word to describe their boss. (\u201cI shouted it into my phone on the Acela quiet car,\u201d Mike confesses in one of the great,   lines in this episode.) The fact that there\u2019s an ugly, sexist aspect to that particular expletive doesn\u2019t necessarily seem to have occurred to any of them (note: they\u2019re mostly men) and in a way, that makes sense. To borrow a line from \u201cA Christmas Story,\u201d the Oval Office dwellers of \u201cVeep\u201d work in profanity the way other artists might work in oils or clay. It is their true medium they are masters. So many obscenities trip and fall off their tongues every day that it\u2019s unlikely they even considered the harsh ramifications of what they said about Selina. But Selina is very aware of how hurtful That Word is and calls Amy to the White House in the middle of the night to discuss it. In a scene that feels as though it were ripped from an old Bette Davis movie, Selina, dressed in a flowing nightgown while darkly barking orders and smoking a cigarette, delivers a blistering monologue: \u201cI am the first female president of the United States and this is an affront. I\u2019ll tell you something, Amy, a lot of people don\u2019t want me to be president. And you know why. Because fundamentally, people hate women. Right? I mean, they\u2019ll just stop at nothing to get me out of here. Everybody\u2019s trying to get me. But I\u2019m not going to let them. \u201d Theoretically, it is possible to listen to this speech without being reminded of Hillary Clinton. But so far, I haven\u2019t figured out how. It\u2019s telling that Selina only feels comfortable speaking so pointedly about her gender in a dimly lit room, in the dead of night, with only a single other woman present. It implies that she knows if she were to say any of this during the work day, with all the Oval Office lights on and everyone on her team present, she\u2019d be perceived as crazy or overly sensitive. Consequently, Selina tends to suppress her worst suspicions about how she\u2019s perceived or simply distract herself with the 87 other messes spilled at her feet. For example, later in this episode, when she finds out that Jonah is succeeding in his Congressional campaign by railing against her record, a move that actually validates her theory that everyone is \u201ctrying to get her,\u201d she lets it roll off her back. Ben tells her it\u2019s good news since once Jonah gets elected, he\u2019ll support her presidency. (Though, really, can\u2019t we all see Jonah   on that promise once he gets a tiny taste of power?) Regardless, the truth is there\u2019s only so many attacks a woman can worry about at once. There are key points in this episode that deliberately show Selina leaning too hard into stereotypical female behavior. One is that   Oval Office scene with Amy, which casts Selina as the harpy. The other involves her waffling about whether or not to bail out the bank overseen by Charlie Baird, a move that may be the best thing from an economic standpoint but a terrible thing for her image since she\u2019ll be perceived as doing a favor for her lover. That whole story line traffics in two classically demeaning perceptions of women: That they\u2019re indecisive, and that they\u2019re always driven by their hearts instead of their heads. By depicting Selina in this way, it\u2019s as if the show is inviting its audience to see her as a prototypical woman, too. But then \u201cVeep\u201d does something brilliant and subverts all of that by having Selina decide not to bail out Charlie\u2019s bank, primarily because of that drippy \u201clove is what matters\u201d pep talk from Gary. Selina isn\u2019t going to fall for the kind of talk she calls \u201cWhen Gary Met Sally. \u201d You can call her That Word and you can think she\u2019s being indecisive but she is still a woman who can\u2019t be pigeonholed. (It\u2019s worth noting that this episode was   by a woman, Georgia Pritchett, and a man, Will Smith, and directed by a man presumably inclined to be sympathetic to Selina  \u2014   Brad Hall, husband of Julia  .) Other examples of women raging against various machines are sprinkled throughout this episode, too. There\u2019s the reappearance of Candi Caruso, the seemingly competent job applicant who once again is called in for an interview and immediately dismissed because the position is being filled  . There\u2019s poor Amy, who\u2019s so overworked that she hilariously tells Siri to set a reminder for her to freeze her eggs. And then there\u2019s Catherine, who has more of a right to feel neglected and demeaned than maybe any other woman on \u201cVeep. \u201d After struggling for days to have a conversation with her mother, she finally drops a bomb on her at the end of this episode when she announces that she\u2019s fallen in love with Marjorie, Selina\u2019s Secret Service agent who was hired because she supposedly looks like Selina from behind. Despite all those progressive things Selina says for the cameras during a   for her holiday shopping trip to Kramerbooks  Afterwords Caf\u00e9  \u2014   she claims she plans to purchase a book by the   poet Wanda Coleman, as well as a graphic novel \u201cwith a strong Asian protagonist\u201d  \u2014   Selina\u2019s   goes out the window when she realizes her daughter is gay. \u201cI wish mother was alive, because this definitely would have killed her,\u201d Selina says. But shouldn\u2019t she have seen this coming? Of course Catherine has fallen for Marjorie. She\u2019s the one person on Earth who looks (a little) like Selina and actually pays attention to Catherine.'"}, "time": 1742564313.787488}
