[Now, Rhodes is part of a new echo, repeating and retweeting   smears aimed at one of his successors, Dr. Sebastian Gorka, Deputy Assistant to President Donald Trump and a key media spokesman for the White House.  Rhodes first took aim at Gorka in response to a tweet by Tommy Vietor, a former National Security Council spokesman under President Obama who infamously attempted to dismiss the Benghazi scandal by telling Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier: \u201cDude, this was like two years ago. \u201d Vietor was, in turn, quoting a Newsweek article criticizing Gorka for criticizing a critic for criticizing his credentials. Rhodes piled on, mocking the \u201cBreitbart credentialed Gorka\u201d for his sensitivity. Rhodes and Vietor ought to be the last to question anyone\u2019s credentials. Rhodes had no national security experience before being plucked from a struggling career as a fiction writer and promoted up the ladder. Vietor was literally the \u201cdude\u201d who drove the press van for Obama on the campaign trail. Both symbolize the callow nature and   culture of the Obama West Wing. (Rhodes still claims today that Syria gave up \u201call\u201d of its chemical weapons in 2013.) Since that first swipe in February, Rhodes has joined the latest round of smears aimed at Gorka, tweeting an article from the Forward that attempted  \u2014   and failed  \u2014   to prove that Gorka supported an antisemitic Hungarian militia. This person works in the WH: \u201cGorka  \u2026    publicly supported a violent racist and   militia\u201d https:  .  via @jdforward,  \u2014   Ben Rhodes (@brhodes) April 3, 2017,  (Be warned before clicking on the link to the Forward article itself: readers are hit with a popup request for donations to continue funding the smear campaign against Gorka. They are literally fundraising off this character assassination.) The   article included an old video interview in Hungarian with Gorka, with English subtitles  \u2014   but the video was obviously spliced together. The raw video was also provided, but without subtitles. David Reboi of RedState undertook a full translation. As David P. Goldman of PJ Media noted, \u201cthe Forward\u2019s clip edits out Gorka\u2019s denunciation of the   parties for exploiting popular fears in order to advance their own agenda\u201d (original emphasis). A lie good enough, as the joke goes, for government work  \u2014   or   work, in Rhodes\u2019s case. He tweeted later: \u201cPicture if Gorka was a Muslim who supported an   militia and had associations with Nazi groups. Would he be in the White House?\u201d Here Rhodes did more than repeat the false accusations in the Forward: he also took aim at Gorka\u2019s notable criticism of radical Islam, a threat Rhodes and his former boss refused even to pronounce. The culmination of this new \u201cecho chamber\u201d came last weekend, with an NBC News piece that tried, and failed, to prove Gorka\u2019s associations with Hungarian extremists but smeared him anyway, citing a fraudulent organization. And so a smear that started with a discredited report on an   blog has been promoted, via the Forward  \u2014   which has an actual problem with antisemitism, having linked Zionists absurdly and outragously with Nazis   \u2014   into the front ranks of the mainstream media and finally to the big network news stage, but remains essentially empty. It is the \u201cecho chamber,\u201d reborn  \u2014   or, rather, undead, a sort of zombie, totally impervious to truth. Note that none of Gorka\u2019s detractors actually question his support for Israel, or even his links with Jews, because they do not care. The echo chamber depends on a factual void, and repetition by false authorities. Just ask the man who invented it. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.
