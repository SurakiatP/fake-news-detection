Amnesty says the US must come clean about the civilian toll of its fight against Islamic State. \\nAmnesty suspects that US Central Command (CENTCOM), which directs coalition airstrikes in Syria, \u201cmay have\u2026 carried out unlawful attacks\u201d in Syria, failing to take necessary measures to prevent civilian killings. \\n\u201cWe fear the US-led coalition is significantly underestimating the harm caused to civilians in its operations in Syria,\u201d said Lynn Maalouf, Deputy Director for Research at Amnesty International\u2019s Beirut regional office. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s high time the US authorities came clean about the full extent of the civilian damage caused by coalition attacks in Syria. Independent and impartial investigations must be carried out into any potential violations of international humanitarian law and the findings should be made public.\u201d \\nAmnesty investigated evidence, including eyewitness accounts, reports by human rights organizations and the media, photographs and video footage as well as satellite imagery, related to 11 suspected coalition attacks in Syria. The group estimates that the attacks have claimed as many as 300 civilian lives. So far none of these deaths has been acknowledged by CENTCOM. \\nThe report published on Wednesday added that the total civilian death toll from coalition action \u201ccould be as high as 600 or more than 1,000\u201d since the operation against Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS, ISIL) started in Syria in 2014. \\nOne of the strikes investigated by Amnesty took place in the early hours of December 7, 2015. The attacks hit two houses in the village of Ayn al-Khan, near al-Hawl in al-Hasakah governorate in northern Syria, killing 40 civilians, including 19 children, and injuring at least 30 others, the report said. A d v e r t i s e m e n t \\nAccording to an eyewitness account, an initial night strike was followed by a second attack from a helicopter gunship, which hit first responders trying to dig out survivors. \\n\u201cAt this point I had a two-month-old baby boy in my arms whom I had rescued. The hit caused me to fall and drop him\u2026 I fell into the hole made by the air strike. That was what saved me\u2026 My mother, aunt, wife and children \u2013 a daughter who was four years old and a son who was two and a half were all killed. The woman and her son who I\u2019d rescued were killed. Everyone but me was killed,\u201d the survivor said. \\nThe strike is believed to have targeted IS fighters. But local Kurdish militia reportedly warned the coalition that there were civilians in the area. \\nAmnesty said CENTCOM\u2019s failure to acknowledge civilian deaths in Syria, as well as the poor record of investigating such incidents in Afghanistan and Iraq, poses grave concerns over the toll which the civilian population of Mosul, Iraq is likely to face from the ongoing operation to take the city from IS. The US-led coalition is providing air support for the offensive. \\n\u201cGiven the likely increase in air strikes by the US-led Coalition as part of the Iraqi offensive to recapture Mosul, it is even more pressing that CENTCOM be fully transparent about the impact of their military actions on civilians. And it is crucial that they adhere scrupulously to international humanitarian law, including by taking all feasible precautions to spare civilians and to minimize harm to civilian homes and infrastructure,\u201d said Maalouf. \\nA similar operation to capture Manbij, Syria, which is far smaller than Mosul, killed more than 200 civilians, Amnesty estimated. \\nLast week, Amnesty International blasted Russia for civilian deaths in Aleppo. The Syrian city is divided between government forces and various armed groups, including the Al-Qaeda offshoot Al-Nusra Front. Russia says that the militants use civilians as human shields and would not allow them to leave the city, derailing several attempts by Russia to open humanitarian corridors out of the city.
