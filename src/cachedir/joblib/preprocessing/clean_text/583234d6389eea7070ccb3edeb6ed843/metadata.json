A range of speakers and performers cutting across generational lines rallied near the Capitol before marchers made their way toward the White House. \u2022 They were joined by crowds in cities across the country: In Chicago, the size of a rally so quickly outgrew early estimates that the march that was to follow was canceled for safety. In Manhattan, Fifth Avenue became a river of pink hats, while in downtown Los Angeles, even before the gathering crowd stretched itself out to march, it was more than a quarter mile deep on several streets. \u2022 Begun as a Facebook post just after the election, the march is the start of what organizers hope could be a sustained campaign of protest in a polarized America, unifying demonstrators around issues like reproductive rights, immigration and civil rights. The movement has also encountered divisions. \u2022 The Times had journalists covering the marches in Washington New York Boston Atlanta Denver Los Angeles Phoenix St. Paul and Key West, Fla. Check out what they posted on Twitter and what readers asked of them live. See photos from marches around the world, too. (All times listed below are local.) (Or watch video of the whole event.) \u2022 The singer and actress Janelle Monae highlighted the issue of police violence, leading the crowd in a chant of \u201cSandra Bland! Say her name!\u201d a reference to the   case where a black woman died in police custody in Texas after being arrested in 2015. She then brought the microphone to each of the women in \u201cMothers of the Movement\u201d who had joined her onstage. One by one, they joined in the chant, each inserting the name of her child who had died at the hands of the police. \u2022 The actress Ashley Judd delivered an uninhibited speech that ended with her referencing how Mr. Trump bragged, in a 2005 recording, that he could use his celebrity status to force himself on women, even groping their private parts. They \u201cain\u2019t for grabbing,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are for birthing new generations of filthy, vulgar, nasty, proud, Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, Sikh, you name it, for new generations of nasty women. \u201d \u2022 Gloria Steinem, the feminist icon of the 1960s and 1970s, told the women in the group to get to know one another more personally. \u201cMake sure you introduce yourselves to each other and decide what we\u2019re going to do tomorrow, and tomorrow and tomorrow,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re never turning back!\u201d \u2022 \u201cIt\u2019s been a   time to be both a woman and an immigrant in this country,\u201d said the actress and activist America Ferrera. \u201cBut the president is not America. His cabinet is not America. Congress is not America. We are America! And we are here to stay. \u201d \u2022 After getting to the crowd to repeat a number to call Congress, the filmmaker Michael Moore urged people to run for office: \u201cThis is not the time for shy people! Shy people, you have two hours to get over it. \u201d \u2022 The actress Scarlett Johansson told a story about how she had visited a Planned Parenthood clinic in New York City after starting her acting career, and how a doctor there had treated her with compassion, \u201cno judgment, no questions asked. \u201d \u201cI feel that in the face of this current political climate, it is vital that we all make it our mission to get really, really personal,\u201d she said. \u201cPresident Trump, I did not vote for you,\u201d she continued. \u201cI want to be able to support you. But first I ask that you support me. Support my sister. Support my mother. Support my best friend and all of our girlfriends. \u201d Otherwise, Ms. Johansson said, her own daughter, \u201cmay potentially not have the right to make choices for her body and her future that your daughter Ivanka has been privileged to have. \u201d _____ Many participants believed that Mr. Trump expressed misogynistic views during the presidential campaign, with remarks about Megyn Kelly, Carly Fiorina and Hillary Clinton. After the 2005 recording surfaced, several women came forward to accuse Mr. Trump of inappropriate sexual conduct. He dismissed the recording as \u201clocker room banter\u201d and assailed his accusers. In a sly allusion to the crude remarks Mr. Trump made in the recording, many marchers, men and women alike, wore pink \u201cpussyhats,\u201d complete with cat ears. The hats are described on pussyhatproject. com as a way to \u201cmake a unique collective visual statement which will help activists be better heard. \u201d _____ Just after 10 a. m. Mr. Trump and his family headed in the opposite direction of the march in Washington for the National Prayer Service, an inaugural tradition, at the National Cathedral. When he spoke at C. I. A. headquarters in Langley, Va. in the midafternoon, he told his audience that they were his \u201cNo. 1 stop\u201d on his first full day in office, because they were \u201creally special amazing people. \u201d He also ruminated about how big the attendance had been at his inaugural speech, but he did not mention the large crowds of the women\u2019s march, where demonstrators were challenging his administration on a number of policies, or even that the march was taking place as he was speaking. _____ Mrs. Clinton was not expected to attend the march in Washington, The Times reported on Friday, but her Twitter account sent a midmorning note anyway. _____ In a speech in Boston, Ms. Warren, a Democratic senator from Massachusetts, said fundamental freedoms, like abortion rights and gay marriage, could be at stake under Mr. Trump\u2019s Supreme Court. \u201cWe can whimper, we can whine or we can fight back,\u201d she said, as demonstrators in pink hats waved American flags. \u201cMe, I\u2019m here to fight back. \u201d \u201cWe believe in science,\u201d Ms. Warren said, adding, \u201cwe know that climate change is real. \u201d A police officer patrolling the rally pumped his fists in agreement. \u201cWe also believe that immigration makes this country a stronger country,\u201d Ms. Warren said. \u201cWe will not build a stupid wall and we will not tear millions of families apart. \u201d \u201cYou know, I could do this all day,\u201d she added, to laughs and cheers. \u201cBut we gotta march. \u201d Jess Bidgood _____ Notable Signs: \u201cBend toward justice,\u201d evokeing the work of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. \u201cI\u2019m ready to march again,\u201d said Mr. Lewis, a Democratic representative of Georgia, who chaired the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in the 1960s. \u201cI\u2019ve come here to say to you: Don\u2019t let anybody, anybody, turn you around. \u201d Citing the demonstrations across the country, Mr. Lewis urged marchers, who flowed onto the street running near the Center for Civil and Human Rights, to \u201cuse this unity to organize\u201d future political efforts. \u201dThe next election, we must get out and vote like we never, ever voted before,\u201d said Mr. Lewis, who was embroiled in a public clash with Mr. Trump recently. Alan Blinder _____ The crowds appeared to be huge in most places, with marchers in Washington, New York City and Chicago seeming to stretch to the horizons. Police departments, at times, decline to provide crowd estimates, and crowds are notoriously hard to estimate, even with a good satellite image. But some official and unofficial estimates have given a sense of the turnout. Attendance in New York City was more than 400, 000, according to Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s office. The St. Paul police issued an official crowd count of 50, 000 to 60, 000 people. Attendance in Boston was 175, 000, according to Nicole Caravella, a spokeswoman for Mayor Martin J. Walsh. The Atlanta Police Department estimated about 60, 000 people attended a rally there. The Department of Public Safety in Phoenix estimated that some 20, 000 marched, while in Key West, Fla. a town of 25, 000, police said more than 2, 000 people marched. Organizers in Chicago estimated the crowd there at 250, 000, the Chicago Tribune said. The Office of Emergency Management and Communications there said late on Saturday morning that Grant Park, the sprawling area where the   had gathered, had been filled to capacity. Though the official march was canceled, many still chose to walk through downtown holding protest signs. Although the mayor\u2019s office in Washington and organizers declined to provide an estimate of the size of the flagship march, The Associated Press reported that the District of Columbia\u2019s homeland security director, Christopher Geldart, said it was safe to say the crowd at the march there was more than the 500, 000 that organizers told city officials to expect. \u201cThe crowd was so heavy, we didn\u2019t know which way to go,\u201d said Sabitha   a psychotherapist who traveled to Washington from Philadelphia with her    child, Sanji, and a friend, Pallavi Sreedhar. \u201cWe were squeezed, touching. \u201d (March organizers offered a worldwide tally for the 673 \u201csister\u201d marches, but when asked, could not provide an explanation of how the tally had been calculated.) _____ Overheard Chant: \u201cYes we can\u201d as people walked past the White House. As the sun set downtown, protesters made their way to the White House and assembled in small groups in a park just across from the building\u2019s entrance. There in an area surrounded by temporary gates, people walked single file through one open entrance and one by one laid protest signs across gates set up for inauguration several hundred feet away from the White House. While the temporary gates made walking up to the building impossible, people stood shaking their heads in frustration. Fontella Garraway, a    retired Army veteran who drove three and half hours from her home in Rocky Mount, N. C. sat on a bench staring at the White House with a pin that read \u201cgirl power. \u201d \u201cEven looking at the White House, it\u2019s like I hope he\u2019s looking out here at us,\u201d she said of Mr. Trump. \u201cI hope it\u2019s penetrating to him that we mean business and we are serious. \u201d Moments later she lay a handwritten sign that read \u201cLove trumps hate Hear our voice,\u201d on the a fence facing the White House. \u201dThat\u2019s his inauguration gift,\u201d she said. Yamiche Alcindor _____ Notable Chant: \u201cTell me what America looks like! This is what America looks like. \u201d Notable Sash: \u201c65, 855, 610 votes for a woman,\u201d worn by Sara Powell, 61, of Phoenix, and nine of her friends. Overheard: \u201cMy arms are tired. This is a good workout,\u201d said Rima Borgogni, 50, owner of a Pilates studio in Sedona, Ariz. after holding a sign throughout the   march. Ellen Ferreira and her friends felt as if they were fighting for some of the same things they used to. They are mostly retired and many of them are veterans of past protests, including the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963, when Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech. \u201cFor our right to choose,\u201d said Piya Jacob, 70, a retired elementary school principal. \u201cFor equality,\u201d said Mary Helsaple, 67, an artist. \u201cFor healing justice,\u201d said Gretchen Vorbeck, 72, who runs a nonprofit that buys grocery gift cards for public schoolteachers. Carol Decker, 70, a retired magazine publisher, jumped in and said, \u201cWe\u2019re mad as hell and we\u2019re not going to take it anymore. \u201d Fernanda Santos _____ Notable Chants: \u201cWe are the popular vote!\u201d Notable Shirt: A blue shirt with \u201cMake Sexism Wrong Again\u201d in the same style as \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d campaign shirts. Just off 15th street, a block north of the parade\u2019s official end point, a large flatbed float with big \u201cTRUMP\u201d letters arched along the back parked itself in the middle of the street, drawing the ire of the thousands of marchers, who berated the float with chants of \u201cShame!\u201d and \u201cWe are the popular vote!\u201d Police officers formed a barricade around the float with more than a   sidecar motorcycles. The six or so men and one woman on the float all took pictures of the protesters. Yet some of those who chanted to chase the float away weren\u2019t surprised at its appearance at their march. \u201cI mean the inauguration was yesterday,\u201d said Chrissy Fiore, 39, of Washington, though she said it was \u201ccrazy that they made it down here and that now they\u2019re getting police escorted out. \u201d Officers wouldn\u2019t let reporters approach those on the float or those driving it, but a magnet on the side said \u201cTrump Unity Bridge. \u201d As the float headed east to move away from the parade, Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. of Milwaukee County, a Trump supporter, was seen walking along the sidewalk, taking in the scene but remaining silent. He did not respond to a reporter\u2019s question about his opinion of the march or protest. Nick Corasaniti _____ Chant: \u201cDon\u2019t take away our ACA\u201d and \u201cWho\u2019s the boss? We are!\u201d Notable Signs: \u201cShow us your taxes\u201d \u201cyou can\u2019t comb over sexism\u201d \u201c1459 days\u201d and \u201cbuild a bridge not a wall. \u201d Overheard: One woman speaking at the rally told the story of having an abortion when she was young, making the minimum wage and could not support a child. She said she was fighting for equal pay \u201cnot just for white women. \u201d At the rally in Mr. Trump\u2019s hometown near Trump World Tower, elected officials and celebrities assailed the president. Signs in the crowd mocked his bouffant hair and the size of his hands. The actress Whoopi Goldberg said it would be the first of many protests against the president. \u201cThis is how people ended the war in Vietnam,\u201d Ms. Goldberg told the cheering crowd. Grace Huezo, 20, a student at Hunter College, marched with her twin sister holding a \u201cNasty Woman\u201d sign. She said she was there to defend women\u2019s rights after she was appalled by Mr. Trump\u2019s comments about grabbing women. \u201cWe\u2019re here saying, no, people do not have permission to grab women without our permission,\u201d she said. She said she was buoyed by the huge turnout and the camaraderie. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful to see so many people that are not giving up and they\u2019re keeping their spirit,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re all just going to stick together over the next four years. \u201d Emma G. Fitzsimmons _____ Popular chant: \u201cMarch! March! March!\u201d Notable signs: \u201cI won\u2019t stop til it rains glass\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t comb over misogyny\u201d (accompanied by a drawing of Mr. Trump\u2019s hair) \u201cFlunk the Electoral College. \u201d Overheard: \u201cI got to bring my high school punk rock out,\u201d said Emily Hastings, 39, a woman from Denver wearing a black \u201ceat the rich\u201d   and carrying a \u201cDon\u2019t tread on women\u201d sign. \u201cPunk rock is all about resistance. \u201d The march began in a park at the center of the city with a group singing \u201cYou\u2019ve got a friend. \u201d Marchers blanketed the park nestled between the   state capitol and city hall, hauling strollers, wearing pink hats and often hugging and kissing. Julie Turkewitz _____ Notable Sign: \u201cMake America Compassionate Again,\u201d and \u201cI Love You\u201d Thousands of demonstrators gathered on a drizzly morning clad in rain boots, ponchos and pink knit \u201cpussyhats\u201d to march to the Capitol. \u201cWhat Trump has said is so based on exclusion and winning and being right versus taking care of everyone,\u201d said Hilary James, 27, a musician from Minneapolis. \u201cEven if he doesn\u2019t listen to us, I feel it\u2019s important to not sit back. \u201d Christina Capecchi _____ Notable Sign: Make America Think Again Gloria Cole, 66, had turned the protest into a family affair, traveling here with her wife, her daughter, her daughter\u2019s boyfriend, and her brother and   . \u201cI drew a line, it\u2019s like, I\u2019m an old woman  \u2014   I\u2019m not that old, I\u2019m 66  \u2014   I have to stand up for equal rights for everyone, for human rights,\u201d Ms. Cole said. \u201cWe\u2019re here, and we\u2019re not going away. \u201d Aili Shaw, 14, held a white sign that read, \u201cOur arms are tired from holding these signs since the 1920s. \u201d Ms. Shaw had traveled here, by train and car, with friends from her home in Coventry, R. I. \u201cWomen don\u2019t have the rights they should,\u201d she said. Jess Bidgood _____ Popular Chant: \u201cThank You. \u201d Women were chanting this to the organizers of the march as they kicked off the day\u2019s events. Notable Clothing: At the corner of C and Third Southwest, many women (and some men) were wearing   \u201cpussyhats\u201d of all shades of pink. Organizers wanted to knit as many as one million hats for this event. People were also getting creative with the signs they carry. Alan and Alison Lewis drove in from Astoria with their    Grace. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to have a relationship to a woman to stand up for women,\u201d Mr. Lewis said. \u201cEquality and justice is enough of a reason to be here. \u201d Katie Rogers _____ Who She Is: Jessica Coleman, 56, of Stone Mountain, Ga. Backstory: A black retired teacher who used to show her daughter documentaries about black history and march with her daughter and church members during Martin Luther King holiday weekends. \u201cI wanted them to know you can be a smart, intelligent black person. You don\u2019t have to sag your pants and follow certain things that became media culture. I wanted them to know that people marched, bled and died for us to be able to vote and be able to go to college and have certain jobs. \u201d \u201cYou can really lose your sense of self if you don\u2019t know where you\u2019ve come from and you don\u2019t have a vision of where you want to go. \u201d _____ Who She Is: Amber   34, of Bethesda, Md. is Ms. Coleman\u2019s daughter Backstory: Works at a nonprofit focused on civic education \u201cOn the evening of election night, after saying, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m going to vote and I\u2019m going to get my friends to vote,\u2019 I sat on the sofa bawling trying to figure out what to say to my daughters the next morning because they went to bed certain that Hillary was going to win. \u201d \u201cMarching is my way of putting my money where my mouth is as far as being an active citizen. \u201d \u201cI want my daughters to have agency and have control over their bodies and feel comfortable in the country that they are in so this is my way of saying, \u2018Hey everybody, I agree with all the people who are out here for different reasons and we don\u2019t agree with what is happening right now and we are taking a stand. \u2019\u201d _____ Who She Is: Garvey Mortley, 8, of Bethesda, Md. is Ms. Coleman\u2019s granddaughter Backstory: Third grader was named after Marcus Garvey \u201cI think it\u2019s good to share the moment with them and help protest Donald Trump because we want to stand up for our rights because a long time ago, lots of women could not vote. Now we can vote and protest people and stuff. \u201d \u201cIf he affects the world in a bad way  \u2014   like I have lots of friends from different countries and he could make them all move away   \u2026     that makes me mad because all the people from the civil rights movement had a hard time trying to put us together. It\u2019s like a puzzle, all these people came together, piece by piece, and now Donald Trump is coming over and just breaking those puzzle pieces. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628495.2293766}
