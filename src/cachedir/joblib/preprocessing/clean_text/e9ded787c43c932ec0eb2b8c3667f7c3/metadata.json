[On February 13, 2014, a   panel of the Ninth Circuit ruled that the \u201cgood cause\u201d requirement violated the Second Amendment. Judge Diarmuid O\u2019Scannlain wrote the majority opinion for the 2014 decision and The San Francisco Chronicle quoted from that opinion, saying, \u201cThe right to bear arms includes the right to carry an operable arm outside the home for the lawful purpose of  . \u201d  On June 9, 2016, the Ninth Circuit reversed itself and ruled in favor of California\u2019s \u201cgood cause\u201d requirement by stating that Americans have no right to carry a concealed handgun outside of their home for  . Lacking such a right, the court found it acceptable that Californians demonstrate a \u201cgood cause\u201d or good reason for needing a gun with them for protection. The Chicago Tribune reports that Gorsuch will be part of the process by which SCOTUS will decide whether to hear the Ninth Circuit\u2019s rejection of Americans\u2019 right to carry a concealed handgun outside the home for  . Gorsuch will participate in the decision which will be made in \u201cprivate conference with his new colleagues Thursday. \u201d Throughout his Senate confirmation hearings, Gorsuch stressed his adherence to the SCOTUS\u2019 ruling in District of Columbia v. Heller (2008). That ruling reaffirmed Americans\u2019 natural, individual right to keep and bear arms. At question in the Ninth Circuit\u2019s 2016 decision is the scope of that right and whether one natural right \u2014  in this case, the right to bear arms \u2014  can be limited without also limiting rights to speech, religion, and security in one\u2019s person, among other rights.
