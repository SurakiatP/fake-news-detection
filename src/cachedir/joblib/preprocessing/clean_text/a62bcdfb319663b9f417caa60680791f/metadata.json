County Sheriff Jim McDonnell\u2019s opposition to State Senate Bill 54, which would declare all of California a \u201csanctuary state. \u201d[According to the Los Angeles Daily News, protesters held up signs that read, \u201cOne struggle, united\u201d and \u201cWe demand immigrant rights. \u201d  David Abud, with the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, reportedly spoke over a loudspeaker against SB 54. He said McDonnell\u2019s \u201cargument is that if we don\u2019t pass this, ICE is going to   our community with deportation. That is a ridiculous argument. \u201d Last month, 161 illegal aliens were arrested throughout Southern California by federal immigration authorities. (Some raids are reportedly ongoing.) The raids took place over the course of several days and resulted in the arrests of 680 illegal aliens across multiple states. That, in turn, upset many of the state\u2019s Democratic lawmakers. SB 54 was introduced by California State Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Le\u00f3n (  Angeles) in December. In February, Breitbart News reported that de L\u00e9on said that \u201c\u2018half his family\u2019 was in the country illegally, using false documents, and eligible for deportation under President Trump\u2019s new executive order against \u2018sanctuary\u2019 jurisdictions. \u201d According to the Daily News, McDonnell wrote to De Le\u00f3n earlier this month: \u201cSB 54 would not allow the safe transfer of custody rather it would force immigration enforcement agents into our communities in order to search out and find the person they seek. While doing this, they will most surely cast a wide net over our communities, apprehending and detaining those not originally the target of the enforcement actions. \u201d Breitbart News reported that on Tuesday, newly   L. A. Mayor Eric Garcetti released a new set of protections for illegal aliens that cement the city\u2019s status as a sanctuary city, and defy the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to ensure compliance with federal law. SB 54 is likewise cast as a direct rejection of President Trump\u2019s recent executive crder, \u201cEnhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States. \u201d The January 25 Executive Order states: \u201cSanctuary jurisdictions across the United States willfully violate Federal law in an attempt to shield aliens from removal from the United States. These jurisdictions have caused immeasurable harm to the American people and to the very fabric of our Republic. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628379.754227}
