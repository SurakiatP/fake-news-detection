Trump. In a yearlong nomination fight full of surprise twists, from the popularity of Mr. Sanders to the success of Mr. Trump, the revelation that Mrs. Clinton had clinched the nomination was another startling development  \u2014   especially coming on the eve of major primaries in California, New Jersey and other states. Mr. Sanders added to the drama by refusing to accept the A. P. survey and vowing to fight on, while Mr. Trump argued that he had done more for women than Mrs. Clinton. Mrs. Clinton was ebullient but also restrained as she received the news at an uncanny moment  \u2014   almost eight years to the day after she ended her campaign against Barack Obama before a crowd of many teary women and girls. On Monday night, she shared the breakthrough with a jubilant audience at a campaign stop in Long Beach, Calif. \u201cI got to tell you, according to the news, we are on the brink of a historic, historic, unprecedented moment, but we still have work to do, don\u2019t we?\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cWe have six elections tomorrow, and we\u2019re going to fight hard for every single vote, especially right here in California. \u201d Like Mr. Obama eight years ago, Mrs. Clinton clinched the Democratic nomination with the support of hundreds of superdelegates  \u2014   the party insiders, Democratic officials, members of Congress, major donors and others who help select the nominee. Under Democratic rules, these superdelegates  \u2014   approximately 720 in all  \u2014   are allowed to back any candidate they wish and can change their allegiance any time before the Democratic National Convention in July. Mrs. Clinton has had relationships with many of the superdelegates for years, and her campaign began seeking their support as soon as she entered the race last spring. Mr. Sanders, by contrast, has struggled to win their backing. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders competed most aggressively for   pledged delegates  \u2014   the roughly 4, 000 delegates won through state primaries and caucuses. The A. P. declared Mrs. Clinton the presumptive nominee by reaching out to superdelegates who had not announced which candidate they were supporting, and confirming that enough were backing Mrs. Clinton to get her to the magic number of 2, 383. But her aides were reluctant to proclaim the race over, for fear of depressing turnout on Tuesday  \u2014   especially in California, where the race remains close  \u2014   or appearing to take the victory for granted. Robby Mook, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, said the A. P.\u2019s call was \u201can important milestone\u201d but indicated Mrs. Clinton did not intend to declare victory until Tuesday night, when she \u201cwill clinch not only a win in the popular vote, but also the majority of pledged delegates. \u201d Advisers to Mr. Sanders took a dim view of the math. He previously said he would lobby Clinton superdelegates to shift their support to him by arguing that he is the party\u2019s best chance to defeat Mr. Trump, and he particularly plans to target those superdelegates who represent states where Mr. Sanders won primaries and caucuses. The advisers, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Mr. Sanders was aiming to win the California primary on Tuesday to bolster his argument to superdelegates that he is the stronger and more popular candidate than Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Sanders, speaking on Monday night at a rally in San Francisco, did not acknowledge the news that Mrs. Clinton had clinched the nomination, and instead defiantly vowed to continue his candidacy to the convention. But he also made clear that Tuesday\u2019s vote was make or break for the future of his campaign. \u201cTomorrow is the most important primary in the whole Democratic nominating process  \u2014   we are going to win here in California,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. He added that if he could win the Tuesday contests in California, North Dakota, South Dakota, New Mexico, Montana and do well in New Jersey, his campaign would be \u201cgoing into that convention with enormous momentum. \u201d Moments before Mr. Sanders took the stage, former State Senator Nina Turner of Ohio led thousands of supporters in a chant shouting, \u201cFight on. Fight on. Fight on. \u201d It was a sentiment shared by many audience members like Alex Borja, 18, of Castro Valley, Calif. who said he was happy Mr. Sanders had not conceded to Mrs. Clinton and hoped he would remain in the race through the summer. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that they have basically coronated Hillary as the nominee from the beginning and, at this point, Bernie still has a chance to win the delegates needed to clinch the nomination at the convention,\u201d Mr. Borja said. He added, however, that he would vote for Mrs. Clinton if she were the nominee. Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign spokesman, Michael Briggs, issued a sharply worded statement that refused to accept the A. P. survey. \u201cIt is unfortunate that the media, in a rush to judgment, are ignoring the Democratic National Committee\u2019s clear statement that it is wrong to count the votes of superdelegates before they actually vote at the convention this summer,\u201d Mr. Briggs said. Mr. Trump struck familiar notes on Monday night on Twitter, attacking Mrs. Clinton as unfit for the presidency, but he also put his own spin on making history during an interview with Fox News. \u201cI was the one that really broke the glass ceiling on behalf of women, more than anybody, in the construction industry,\u201d Mr. Trump said. For Mrs. Clinton, becoming her party\u2019s presumptive nominee is the latest chapter in a remarkable career that has taken her from being the first lady to being one election away from returning to the White House as president. She planned a victory rally on Tuesday in Brooklyn, but by the time The A. P. had called the contest, she seemed to already be in a celebratory mood, ending a campaign slog that had been expected to come to a close after the early contests but dragged on to just before the final votes were tallied, at a \u201cShe\u2019s With Us\u201d concert at the Greek Theater in Los Angeles with John Legend, Christina Aguilera and Stevie Wonder. Mrs. Clinton had for weeks hardly hid her eagerness to put the primary contests against Mr. Sanders behind her and to turn her full focus to the presumptive Republican nominee, Mr. Trump. Talking to voters at the Hawkins House of Burgers in the Watts section of Los Angeles, Mrs. Clinton promised to take on Mr. Trump \u201call the time,\u201d and, earlier that day, she urged Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters to consider the consequences if Mr. Trump captured the White House. \u201cAnyone who\u2019s supported me, anyone who has supported Senator Sanders has a lot at stake in this election in preventing Donald Trump from being our president, which I can barely say,\u201d she told reporters on Monday. But Mrs. Clinton must also work in the coming weeks to improve her own standing with voters, both with Mr. Sanders\u2019s hordes of young supporters and with a majority of registered voters who say they do not like or trust her. Still, many Democratic allies of Mrs. Clinton did not want to wait until Tuesday\u2019s primaries to celebrate, writing Twitter posts and issuing statements hailing her as the nominee and trying to shift the Democratic Party\u2019s focus and the national political conversation to take aim at Mr. Trump. Jennifer Granholm, the former Michigan governor who now advises a   \u201csuper PAC,\u201d said in an email: \u201cIt\u2019s beyond words incredibly moving for me personally  \u2014   but premature. We don\u2019t want to crush democracy. Still six states tomorrow whose votes must be counted. It\u2019s crucial to encourage people to vote. \u201d At Mrs. Clinton\u2019s rally on Monday evening in California, several voters expressed exhilaration at her historic victory. \u201cIt\u2019s about time,\u201d said Maria Garibay, a retired manufacturing analyst. But others also braced themselves for a final showdown with Mr. Sanders and ferocious fight against Mr. Trump. \u201cI hope Bernie goes out gracefully,\u201d said Helen Satorius, a retired high school counselor. \u201cWe need to beat Trump, completely and totally. So I think now he needs to just be willing to unite. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562410.40061}
