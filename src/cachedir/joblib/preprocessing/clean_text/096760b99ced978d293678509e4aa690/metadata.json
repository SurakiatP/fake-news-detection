Jackson is also close to John Podesta , Clinton\u2019s national campaign chairman. \\nMorocco\u2019s state-owned phosphate company, OCP, would ostensibly have benefited from Jackson\u2019s move to shut down Mosaic. Mohammed donated up to $15 million to the Clinton Foundation through OCP. \\nClinton also relaxed U.S. foreign aid restrictions on Morocco, thus allowing U.S. funds to be used in the territory of Western Sahara where OCP operates phosphate mining operations. The aid restrictions stemmed from Morocco\u2019s illegal occupation of the territory since 1974. \\nMorocco is repeatedly condemned for seizing the territory and for unilaterally extracting the country\u2019s valuable minerals, impoverishing what\u2019s left of the local Sahrawi Arabs. \\nNo nation recognizes Moroccan sovereignty over the Western Sahara and the United Nation\u2019s Security Council legal office and the International Court of Justice both demand that Muhammed withdraw his claim over the territory and end illegal extraction of minerals. \\nAn email WikiLeaks made public last week illustrated how Clinton, while acting as secretary of state, negotiated an additional $12 million donation to the Clinton Foundation from Muhammed in return for holding the 2015 Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) meeting in Marrakech, Morocco. Another $1 million payment came from OCP to cover the expenses of the CGI meeting. \\nThe regulatory assault against the U.S. phosphate industry began in earnest when Jackson launched a barrage of intimidating regulatory initiatives against Mosaic. Environmental concerns about phosphates date from 1979 but the EPA did little to address concerns related to phosphate mining until Jackson\u2019s 2011 moves. \\nThe regulatory assault on the U.S. phosphate industry encompassed several agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). DHS aircraft flew at low altitudes over Mosaic\u2019s central Florida operations in search of environmental problems. The EPA also threatened large Superfund penalties, which could have bankrupted Mosaic. \\nPhosphates are essential ingredients in fertilizers used in American farming. Closing or reducing Mosaic\u2019s output would have cost tens of thousands of American jobs and injured the country\u2019s agricultural productivity. \\nIt also would leave the U.S. dependent upon foreign phosphate producers, but particularly Morocco\u2019s OCP. The only other countries that mine phosphates are Russia, China and Saudi Arabia. \\nRep. Dennis Ross, a Republican congressman who represents the Florida district where Mosaic operates, told TheDCNF he now sees why the EPA went after Mosaic. \\n\u201cThe tactics makes perfect sense as to why the EPA, under Lisa Jackson\u2019s tutelage, targeted Mosaic\u2019s phosphate operations in my district. I was never given any answers when I questioned Lisa Jackson about the EPA\u2019s deliberate actions against Mosaic,\u201d Ross told TheDCNF. \\n\u201cNow I know why. An environmental concern never existed. This targeting was all done as a payback to Morocco for donating millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation,\u201d Ross said. \\nAn uproar from Florida regulators push-back from the state\u2019s congressional delegation and the agency\u2019s tenuous legal position all forced the EPA to end its threats against Mosaic. \\nRep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican who is vice-chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and a vocal critic of the Clinton Foundation, agreed with Ross, saying \u201cthese facts seem to reveal the possibility of more pay-to-play activities at the Clinton Foundation.\u201d \\n\u201cIt would be especially troubling if the Clinton Foundation was working with the EPA to suppress the American phosphate industry in favor of Morocco. The EPA and Clinton Foundation should be forthcoming about their dealings with the Moroccan government and the American phosphate industry.\u201d \\nClinton\u2019s 2012 support of a rider on the U.S. foreign aid bill permitting foreign aid to be sent to the Western Sahara arguably legitimized Moroccan occupation of territory and depopulated the Sahrawi Arabs. Native Moroccans were sent into the country by the government to extract the minerals. \\nThe rider approved by Clinton said that U.S. foreign aid funds \u201cmay be used in regions and territories administered by Morocco,\u201d meaning, the Western Sahara. The Western Sahara is classified a \u201cNon-Self-Governing Territory\u201d under international law. \\n\u201cPreviously, United States excluded Western Sahara from bilateral assistance to avoid seeming to endorse Moroccan control,\u201d said Eugene Kontorovich, a professor at Northwestern University School of Law, in a legal review of occupied territories around the world. \\nHans Corell, the U.N. Security Council\u2019s Under-Secretary for Legal Affairs, said in January 2002 that \u201cif further exploration and exploitation activities were to proceed in disregard of the interests and wishes of the people of Western Sahara, they would be in violation of the international law principles applicable to mineral resource activities in Non-Self-Governing Territories.\u201d \\nA Dec. 10, 2015 report by the International Court of Justice ruled that \u201cthe sovereignty of the Kingdom of Morocco over Western Sahara is not recognized by the European Union or its Member States, or more generally by the UN, and the absence of any international mandate capable of justifying Moroccan presence on that territory.\u201d \\nBut none of that mattered to former President Bill Clinton, who said nothing about the world\u2019s condemnation of Morocco\u2019s exploitation of the area for its phosphate industry, while speaking at the Clinton Foundation\u2019s 2015 Marrakech CGI conference. Instead, he praised it. \\n\u201cThe Moroccans who are here will tell you that in the last several years, they have become the Saudi Arabia of phosphates, and what they have done with it, to diversify their economy and to make it part of a comprehensive strategy instead of another example of resource curse, is very impressive indeed,\u201d Clinton said. \\n\u201cHillary Clinton sold her soul when they accepted that money,\u201d reported Politico the day after the Marrakech CGI conference. \\nH/T \u2013 DailyCaller \\nSupport the Trump Movement and help us fight Liberal Media Bias.
