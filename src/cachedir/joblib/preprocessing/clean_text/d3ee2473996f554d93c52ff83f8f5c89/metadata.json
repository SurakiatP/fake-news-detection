People who head to Twitter to discuss their ideals are, often unwittingly, conversing with legions of bots: accounts preprogrammed to spew the same campaign slogans, insults or conspiracy theories hundreds or thousands of times a day. And one of their most competitive battlegrounds is the prime digital real estate that opens up every time   Donald J. Trump tweets. Any supporters or critics who reply quickly enough to Mr. Trump can see their own tweets showcased right beneath the biggest spectacle on Twitter. But in this   contest, propaganda bots always best human beings. Recently, I noticed a different kind of bot clawing to the top of Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter replies. It\u2019s called @EveryTrumpDonor, and every couple of hours it tweets about the Americans who donated to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign  \u2014   who they are, where they\u2019re from, what they do, all from public Federal Election Commission data. People sucked into its timeline aren\u2019t always sure if it\u2019s a tool for shaming Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters or a celebration of the folks who contributed to his victory. Either way, the bot reminds us of the real people behind the Twitter brigades. Unlike the typical Twitter bot, it fights disinformation with actual facts. @EveryTrumpDonor represents an emerging class of politicized bots. You could think of them as \u201cprotest bots\u201d or, as the   theorist Mark Sample calls them, \u201cbots of conviction. \u201d Many bots set up to spread campaign propaganda or disinformation masquerade as humans, but protest bots typically own their cyborg natures. Some are designed to jockey for social media position with the propaganda bots, while others set out to unmask nefarious actors, distract enemies, redirect public attention to the messages they value or even build morale among human activists. They\u2019re not always deployed for universal good sometimes, their aims and means are unsettling. But in every case, propaganda bots and protests bots are fighting over a limited resource: our attention. Propaganda bots made a powerful showing during Election 2016. Oxford University\u2019s Project on Computational Propaganda found that at times during the campaign, more than a quarter of the tweets colonizing politicized hashtags like #MAGA and #CrookedHillary came from \u201cheavily automated accounts. \u201d In the days leading up to the election, Trump propaganda bots outnumbered Clinton propaganda bots five to one. Since then, bot armies have been programmed to spread conspiracy theories about a   Democratic pedophile ring known as Pizzagate. The bots help the topic trend, lend an air of   momentum and create enough of a mirage of a movement that real people then join in. Bots of conviction can\u2019t compete with those numbers  \u2014   spamming is not their style  \u2014   but they can work as effective tools of provocation, as this taxonomy shows. HUNTER BOTS One of Twitter\u2019s vilest subcultures is its collection of minstrel accounts, which impersonate Jews and people of color in order to mock and discredit them. These accounts steal avatars from real people, give themselves fake ethnic names and spew racism that\u2019s then boosted by a network of tittering racist tweeters. @ImposterBuster, a bot unleashed on Twitter last month by the Tablet writer Yair Rosenberg and the developer Neal Chandra, is designed to hunt them down. Mr. Rosenberg and Mr. Chandra have compiled a database of known minstrel accounts and haveput @ImposterBuster on their trail. The bot tracks their every move on Twitter and replies automatically to their tweets, exposing racists and alerting other users to their subterfuge. Another bot with a predatory instinct, @EveryTrumpette, is a visual variation on the @EveryTrumpDonor theme. Every few hours, it pulls up a photo from a Trump rally, then uses a   algorithm to scan the crowd and zoom in on one person\u2019s face. The resulting videos are scored with quotations from Mr. Trump himself. The bot\u2019s creator has contended that its purpose is empathic connection, the bot designed to examine Trump supporters, \u201cone by one, to try and see the humanity. \u201d But its effect is combative, even unnerving. It implies that whether online or at a rally, supporters will not be shielded by the anonymizing cloak of the crowd. At some point, this bot\u2019s unfeeling gaze will systematically hunt them down and call them out for judgment. HONEYPOT BOTS  These bots are meant to distract trolls by goading them into fighting with unthinking machines. Accounts like @arguetron and @good_opinions tweet out automated progressive lines, then lure in the folks who scan Twitter, looking for a fight. All it takes is tweeting out flash point terms like \u201caffirmative action,\u201d \u201cfeminist\u201d or \u201cDrudge Report. \u201d Whenever anyone responds to a provocation from @arguetron  \u2014   which presents as a woman named Liz  \u2014   the bot is programmed to volley back a dismissive tweet. @arguetron is not very smart  \u2014   it can\u2019t recognize anything you say to it, much less respond  \u2014   but the people who debate it always lose. Some have angrily tweeted for hours before logging off. That\u2019s time that could have been spent arguing with real progressive women, but is instead directed at a virtual brick wall. One of the most delicious honeypot bots of this campaign was targeted at one Twitter user in particular. @ilduce2016 is a Twitter bot created by Gawker journalists that exclusively tweets out Benito Mussolini quotations but attributes them to Mr. Trump. Gawker guessed that Mr. Trump\u2019s obsession with boosting his own image  \u2014   he\u2019s known to retweet fans who tweet his quotations back at him  \u2014   could be exploited to trick him into owning and promoting the words of a Fascist dictator. He took the bait one February morning, retweeting the Mussolini line \u201cIt is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep. \u201d COMFORT BOTS For a break from political struggle, turn to @tinycarebot, a robot that reminds people that they are only human. It popped up last month, in the middle of   Twitter angst, and began tweeting out calming nature emoji with simple relaxation tasks like \u201cplease remember to drink some water\u201d and \u201ctake time to look up from twitter please. \u201d If you tweet at @tinycarebot, it tweets back a \u201cpersonal reminder for you\u201d mine included the emoji of a cityscape at night with the message \u201cplease take time to look outside! be kind to urself!\u201d There\u2019s something soothing about the idea that one of the most draining forms of modern political engagement, fighting with strangers on Twitter, could be outsourced to forces of automation. Let the bots hunt down   divert antifeminist trolls and crowd out the propaganda bots. I think I\u2019ll take a nap. After all, bots don\u2019t have feelings to hurt, professional reputations to uphold or conflicts of interest to manage. They can respond instantly and tweet tirelessly, but waste no time reading anybody else\u2019s timeline. As inhuman as the bots are, their greatest promise may lie in their ability to cut through the artifice of political Twitter to reveal something real. Propaganda bots spew lines and lies that coat social media with impersonal rhetoric and   images. Bots of conviction produce interactions that feel grounded in revealing truths of human behavior. And that\u2019s the case whether the bot is offering up the name of a retired Trump donor from Oklahoma City or showing how fruitless Twitter political arguments really are.'"}, "time": 1742628555.4745686}
