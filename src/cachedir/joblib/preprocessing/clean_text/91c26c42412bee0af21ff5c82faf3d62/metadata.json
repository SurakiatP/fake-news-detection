[The revelations in CNN\u2019s report are not new, though the whistleblower\u2019s consistency in repeating his story is notable, and CNN received denials (and threats to have their journalists expelled from the country) from Venezuelan officials.  In November 2015, Misael L\u00f3pez Soto fled the Venezuelan embassy in Baghdad and posted a video to YouTube detailing how his officials requested he participate in a scheme to sell authentic documents to Mideast nationals. \u201cI have made public how, under the complacent eye of diplomats in the mission [in Baghdad] local employees delivered visas, passports, birth certificates, and other types of Venezuelan documentation to citizens of Syria, Iraq, Palestine, and, in some cases, Pakistan,\u201d he said in the video. L\u00f3pez added that those who benefitted from the project could very well have ties to international terrorist organizations. \u201cIn many cases, they were tied to terrorist groups, most of the Shiite variety,\u201d he said at the time, and placed the average price of such a document at up to $15, 000. L\u00f3pez also alleged that Venezuelan nationals would receive Iraqi identities for the right price, leading to individuals with criminal pasts resorting to bribing socialist Venezuelan officials to leave the country. L\u00f3pez  \u2014   now living in Toledo, Spain  \u2014   has not changed his story. In an interview with CNN en Espa\u00f1ol this week, he reiterated that he believed many of those buying government documents from the Venezuelan embassy in Baghdad did so as part of their involvement in terrorist activity. Ambassador Jonathan Velasco, L\u00f3pez says, \u201cgave me an envelope full of visas and passports and told me \u2018take care of this, you have a million dollars in your hands. \u201d \u201cHe later explained to me that, in Iraq, people paid a lot of money for a visa or a passport. I thought it was a joke,\u201d he continued. L\u00f3pez vividly recalls one incident in which a colleague at the embassy attempted to sell visas to Venezuela to thirteen Syrians for $10, 000 apiece. \u201cHer excuse was that they wanted to go to the World Cup in Brazil in 2014,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cI suspected they were terrorists so I completely refused. \u201d CNN traced L\u00f3pez\u2019s claims back to 2013 and found evidence that up to 173 Middle Eastern nationals received authentic Venezuelan documents, including passports, between 2008 and 2013. CNN concluded some these individuals had ties to the terrorist organization Hezbollah, which has long boasted ties to the socialist government in Caracas. The relationship between Hezbollah and the government of late dictator Hugo Ch\u00e1vez traces back to 2007, according to the Spanish book Boomerang Ch\u00e1vez. Spanish journalist Emili Blasco, who wrote the book, alleged that Ch\u00e1vez sent his   Affairs Minister Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to Damascus, Syria. There, Maduro met with, among others, Syria\u2019s head of state Bashar   and Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah. At least 300 Hezbollah members subsequently received Venezuelan identification documents, according to subsequent reports. The Center for a Secure Free Society (SFS) a   think tank, published a report in 2014 revealing that the Venezuelan government had issued an estimated 173 passports, visas, and permits to Middle Eastern nationals between 2008 and 2012, matching the timeline in the book Boomerang Ch\u00e1vez. SFS also accused Cuba of funding the scheme to provide these documents. Cuba\u2019s role in the scheme surfaced once again in documents released by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) in early 2016. The \u201cPanama Papers\u201d revealed that law firm Mossack Fonseca played a role in transferring Cuban funds into a shell corporation later used by Venezuela to buy advanced passport printing equipment. The plan to purchase new printing equipment traced back to 2005, according to the documents ICIJ made public. Multiple Venezuelan government officials denied these allegations to CNN journalists in investigations spanning the past year and published this week. In one case, Venezuelan officials threatened to expel a CNN journalist after attempting to ask Foreign Minister Delcy Rodr\u00edguez about L\u00f3pez\u2019s claims.'"}, "time": 1742628562.6920693}
