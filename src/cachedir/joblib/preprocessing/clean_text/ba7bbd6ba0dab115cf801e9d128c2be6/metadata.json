Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \\nAs Twitchy reported, Hillary Clinton held a brief press conference Friday to address news that the FBI had found \u2014 in the process of investigating Anthony Weiner\u2019s alleged sexting of a 15-year-old girl \u2014 new emails that warranted further investigation into her own email scandal. \\nObviously not pleased by this latest development, Clinton called on the FBI to release whatever it had. Hillary Clinton: \"We don\\'t know the facts, which is why we\\'re calling on the FBI to release all the information it has \u2026 let\u2019s get it out.\" \\n\u2014 New York Post (@nypost) October 28, 2016 \\nDespite that not being how FBI investigations work, Hillary\u2019s call for the FBI to lay its cards on the table inspired Sharyl Attkisson of Full Measure News to make a simple suggestion: There\\'s no mystery as to what\\'s in the Huma Abedin emails\u2013to Huma. She can fill in the Hillary campaign. \\n\u2014 Sharyl Attkisson (@SharylAttkisson) October 29, 2016 \\nWhat didn\u2019t Hillary think of that? Abedin is right there with her on board her campaign plane \u2014 it\u2019s not like she\u2019s hard to track down. Unless, of course, neither one can recall what they wrote to each other. It happens. More than 1,000 potentially relevant emails found on Weiner computer, including some between Huma and HRC. https://t.co/hVHL61vqrk \\n\u2014 Rosalind Helderman (@PostRoz) October 28, 2016 @SharylAttkisson @RobbyMook can bring them when he\\'s on @FoxNewsSunday and clear this all up.'"}, "time": 1742562464.5727224}
