The ultimate benefit for Brookings: $400, 000 in donations from Lennar\u2019s different divisions. The think tank began to aggressively promote the project, San Francisco\u2019s biggest redevelopment effort since its recovery from the 1906 earthquake, and later offered to help Lennar, a publicly traded company, \u201cengage with national media to develop stories that highlight Lennar\u2019s innovative approach. \u201d And Brookings went further. It named Kofi Bonner, the Lennar executive in charge of the San Francisco development, as a senior fellow  \u2014   an enviable credential he used to advance the company\u2019s efforts. \u201cHe would be a trusted adviser,\u201d an internal Brookings memo said in 2014 as the think tank sought one $100, 000 donation from Lennar. Think tanks, which position themselves as \u201cuniversities without students,\u201d have power in government policy debates because they are seen as researchers independent of moneyed interests. But in the chase for funds, think tanks are pushing agendas important to corporate donors, at times blurring the line between researchers and lobbyists. And they are doing so while reaping the benefits of their   status, sometimes without disclosing their connections to corporate interests. Thousands of pages of internal memos and confidential correspondence between Brookings and other donors  \u2014   like JPMorgan Chase, the nation\u2019s largest bank K. K. R. the global investment firm Microsoft, the software giant and Hitachi, the Japanese conglomerate  \u2014   show that financial support often came with assurances from Brookings that it would provide \u201cdonation benefits,\u201d including setting up events featuring corporate executives with government officials, according to documents obtained by The New York Times and the New England Center for Investigative Reporting. Similar arrangements exist at many think tanks. On issues as varied as military sales to foreign countries, international trade, highway management systems and real estate development, think tanks have frequently become vehicles for corporate influence and branding campaigns. \u201cThis is about giant corporations who figured out that by spending, hey, a few tens of millions of dollars, if they can influence outcomes here in Washington, they can make billions of dollars,\u201d said Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, a frequent critic of undisclosed Wall Street donations to think tanks. Washington has seen a proliferation of think tanks, particularly small institutions with narrow interests tied to specific industries. At the same time, the brand names of the field have experienced explosive growth. Brookings\u2019s annual budget has doubled in the last decade, to $100 million. The American Enterprise Institute is spending at least $80 million on a new headquarters in Washington, not far from where the Center for Strategic and International Studies built a $100 million office tower. The shift has occurred as nonprofits in general have been under increasing pressure from their donors to meet specific goals. But for think tanks, that pressure can threaten their standing as independent arbiters in policy debates in Congress, the White House and the news media. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice to go back to the greatest generation, in the   War II era of philanthropy, where they said, gosh, \u2018Here is $1 million spend it how you wish,\u2019\u201d Kimberly Churches, the managing director at Brookings, said in an interview. Think tank executives reject any suggestion that they are tools of corporate influence campaigns and say they are simply teaming up with donors that have similar goals, like helping cities with economic development. \u201cWe do not compromise our integrity,\u201d said Martin S. Indyk, Brookings\u2019s executive vice president. \u201cWe maintain our core values of quality, independence, as well as impact. \u201d But he acknowledged that the arrangement to appoint the Lennar executive as a senior fellow had created the \u201cappearance of a conflict of interest. \u201d And he said that Brookings, in the interest of transparency, had recently decided to prohibit corporations or   foundations from making anonymous contributions. At think tanks like Brookings, the majority of reports and events, with titles like \u201cFive Evils: Multidimensional Poverty and Race in America\u201d or \u201cIndia at the Global High Table,\u201d have no obvious link to corporate donors. Still, the benefits afforded to corporations looking to cloak themselves with the authority of think tanks are strikingly evident, according to a review of documents from more than a dozen institutions. The likely conclusions of some think tank reports, documents show, are discussed with donors  \u2014   or even potential ones  \u2014   before the research is complete. Drafts of the studies have been shared with donors whose opinions have then helped shape final reports. Donors have outlined how the resulting scholarship will be used as part of broader lobbying efforts. The think tanks also help donors promote their corporate brands, as Brookings does with JPMorgan Chase, whose $15. 5 million contribution is the largest by a private corporation in the institution\u2019s history. Despite these benefits, corporations can write off the donations as charitable contributions. Some tax experts say these arrangements may amount to improper subsidies by taxpayers if think tanks are providing specific services. \u201cPeople think of think tanks as   uncompromised and not bought like others in the political class,\u201d said Bill Goodfellow, the executive director of the Center for International Policy, a   think tank. \u201cBut it\u2019s absurd to suggest that donors don\u2019t have influence. The danger is we in the think tank world are being corrupted in the same way as the political world. And all of us should be worried about it. \u201d A group of Democratic state attorneys general is investigating whether Exxon Mobil worked with certain think tanks in past decades to cover up its understanding of fossil fuels\u2019 impact on climate change, in part by financing reports questioning the science, a suggestion the company rejects. Executives at Brookings, the Center for Strategic and International Studies and other think tanks say they have systems in place to ensure that their reports are based on scholars\u2019 independent conclusions. \u201cWe strongly believe in our model of seeking solutions to some of our country\u2019s most difficult problems,\u201d John J. Hamre, the chief executive at C. S. I. S. said in a written reply to questions. \u201cWe gather stakeholders, vet ideas, find areas of agreement and highlight areas of disagreement. \u201d Yet researchers at think tanks are seeing corporate influence firsthand. Rachel Stohl, a senior associate at the Stimson Center in Washington, said she had been quizzed by potential donors as she tried to raise money for research on the military\u2019s use of armed drones. \u201c\u2018Are you going to say drones are bad? \u2019\u201d she recalled one potential financial backer asking. \u201c\u2018We are not interested in funding something that says drones are bad. \u2019\u201d The confidential Brookings spreadsheet had an unassuming title: Corporate Overviews Tracking. It listed nearly 90 corporations, from Alcoa to Wells Fargo, providing a glimpse of the vast electronic file that Brookings maintained on donors and prospects, and the benefits it might offer. The database, along with thousands of pages of emails, solicitations for money and memos on meetings with corporate officials, highlighted Brookings\u2019s practice of assuring that donors would see results from their contributions. The files included company priorities and a tally of donations. General Electric wanted to fund work on rail networks and clean energy programs  \u2014   both critical parts of its business  \u2014   and Brookings then featured G. E. executives, joined by officials from the White House and Congress, at events that focused on these industries. In 2004, Brookings established its Metropolitan Policy Program, devised to stimulate economic growth in cities. As the country was emerging from recession, Brookings bolstered its ties to corporate donors in 2010 by naming Marek Gootman, a lobbyist from Patton Boggs, as its first director of strategic partnerships. He was assigned to work with \u201ca national network of elected, business and civic leaders engaged in city and metropolitan area policy development and implementation. \u201d From the start, the program blended a variety of insights on urban matters, including from corporate, nonprofit and government sources. And Mr. Indyk noted that any reports issued were made public. Donations to the program exploded, from $4. 3 million in 2005 to $12. 5 million in 2013, nearly 20 percent of Brookings\u2019s overall program spending that year. K. K. R. after starting special funds around 2010 to invest in real estate and other infrastructure projects, donated $450, 000 to Brookings, some of it as the institution agreed to set up meetings for a top K. K. R. executive with community leaders in Philadelphia and Detroit, where the company was considering real estate projects. Brookings separately produced a report, published on K. K. R. \u2019s website, promoting one of the company\u2019s infrastructure projects in New Jersey, after the company executive suggested such a piece. In advance of a 2014 event Brookings officials attended with corporate executives including Henry R. Kravis, a   of K. K. R. one memo marked as confidential noted: \u201cK. K. R. has given a total of $350K to Brookings. Last gift came in on    for $150K to Metro Henry has donated $75K to Brookings, most going to the individual unrestricted fund. \u201d The tally demonstrates the important distinction that Brookings makes between \u201cunrestricted\u201d donations, which the think tank can spend on any research, and   funding restricted to specific topics that the donor has a particular interest in. Lennar joined Brookings\u2019s Metropolitan Leadership Council, established for the program\u2019s top donors, in July 2010. That month, the company won approval to redevelop Hunters Point in San Francisco, turning the area into a more than   mix of housing, education and commercial development. Brookings would later name the project one of the three most \u201ctransformative investments in the United States. \u201d  The San Francisco project generated controversy from the beginning, with critics concerned about toxic waste left by the former Navy shipyard. Lennar joined with Brookings as protests were escalating in 2010. One complaint, filed by area residents with the Environmental Protection Agency, said the San Francisco Health Department was \u201cconspiring with Lennar Corporation to conceal the health threats of   dust. \u201d The company was busy at the time looking for investors to help it complete the project, known as the San Francisco Shipyard. A spokesman for Lennar, Glenn Bunting, disputed claims that the company had donated to Brookings out of    \u2014   and said the alliance was not related to the protests. \u201cThere was nothing needed in the way of assistance for Lennar to \u2018buy\u2019 from Brookings,\u201d Mr. Bunting said in an email. Brookings, though, continued to promote the project. \u201cSan Francisco\u2019s Shipyard project is both physically and economically transformative for the Bay Area and globally significant,\u201d Mr. Katz, the Brookings vice president, said in a news release issued by San Francisco\u2019s mayor in 2011 as Lennar\u2019s hunt for major investors intensified. \u201cThis project promises to set a new paradigm for successfully conceiving, financing and delivering transformative infrastructure projects in the United States. \u201d   memos were more explicit: Brookings, as it sought an additional $50, 000 from Lennar in 2014, said it was prepared to \u201cuse our convening power, research expertise, network connections and knowledge of innovative practices to help further drive the ultimate impact and success\u201d of Lennar\u2019s project and to \u201cprovide public validation of San Francisco\u2019s efforts through national and local media coverage. \u201d The think tank soon delivered. Mr. Katz made appearances alongside Mr. Bonner, the Lennar executive, to promote the project to government officials and business leaders in California. In 2014, around the time the think tank sought an additional round of money from Lennar, Brookings invited its new nonresident senior fellow, Mr. Bonner, who has a master\u2019s degree in architecture and is a former government planner for several California cities, to appear at an event at its headquarters. \u201cI am working in San Francisco in a fabulous property,\u201d Mr. Bonner said at the event, referring to Lennar\u2019s Shipyard project. In March, at a conference of real estate developers and investors in Cannes, France, Lennar sponsored a session in which Brookings researchers helped the company highlight the Shipyard. \u201cKofi is what I would describe as the quintessential city builder,\u201d Julie Wagner, a Brookings nonresident senior fellow, said as she introduced Mr. Bonner at an event where projects with no connection to donors were also featured. At least some of the $400, 000 Lennar has donated to Brookings since 2010 has come from its SunStreet Energy division, which sells rooftop solar systems, at the same time that Brookings\u2019s metropolitan program has published research on the rooftop solar industry. Mr. Indyk said the collaboration simply reflected shared goals of revitalizing cities. Brookings scholars promoted other real estate projects, he said, involving local governments, universities or even developers that were not donors  \u2014   including one in Detroit backed by Dan Gilbert, the founder of Quicken Loans, and one in Seattle backed by Paul G. Allen, a   of Microsoft. But Mr. Indyk acknowledged that naming Mr. Bonner, who declined to be interviewed, a Brookings nonresident scholar had \u201ccreated the impression that because Lennar was giving money, he was getting the title. \u201d His post, which was unpaid, was not renewed. Hitachi has been another large donor to the metropolitan program, giving a total of $1. 8 million to Brookings over the last decade, according to Brookings documents. The think tank reviewed the company\u2019s corporate marketing and sales strategy targeting the United States, an internal memo shows. Brookings also organized public events that featured top Obama administration officials and allowed Hitachi executives to promote their products. \u201cMetro has held nine meetings and several conference calls in the past six months with executives from Hitachi\u2019s water, transportation and data business lines and are collaborating more fully on defining what it means to be a \u2018Smart City,\u2019\u201d a confidential Brookings memo said. Officials at Brookings said they had not lobbied for Hitachi, and they provided examples of reports that they said included conclusions challenging the company\u2019s position. \u201cHelping a corporation\u2019s   agenda is not in any way our agenda,\u201d Ms. Churches, the managing director, said. Yet Ms. Churches also said the contract language with donors like Lennar and Hitachi was \u201cinelegant,\u201d although not improper. When asked if the documents read like a    agreement, she said, \u201cIt could be misconstrued. \u201d Mr. Indyk said Brookings had recently changed its policies so that \u201ctoday, there is no way in which those words would be used in our documents. \u201d When JPMorgan offered a major donation to the metropolitan program in 2011, Brookings created the Global Cities Initiative, complete with a new logo that called it a \u201cjoint project of Brookings and JPMorgan Chase. \u201d The project was premised on a common interest between the bank and the think tank. Brookings wanted to promote economic growth in cities by encouraging international trade, and JPMorgan wanted to gain new business by offering loans to companies in the same markets. In contract documents, Brookings emphasized that it would control the conclusions of its reports and said it would \u201cnot directly or indirectly communicate with any party\u201d to help get JPMorgan business. Mr. Indyk and executives from JPMorgan said the company and the think tank simply agreed on a worthy agenda. \u201cThis was about growing the economy, and we are incredibly proud of the results of this initiative,\u201d said Peter Scher, the head of the corporate responsibility program at JPMorgan. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s had a huge impact in more than 30 cities that are involved. \u201d At the same time, hundreds of pages of memos  \u2014   status reports to JPMorgan, internal reports by Brookings staff to prepare for meetings with top bank executives, and formal documents soliciting more money  \u2014   make clear that Brookings saw the Global Cities Initiative as a branding effort that could help JPMorgan bolster its standing in cities. \u201cBottom line: Growing metro economies is good for the nation and for JPMC also, many U. S. cities are JPMC clients  \u2014   motivation to support them and their clients,\u201d said one Brookings document dated July 2011, as officials from the think tank met with top bank executives to discuss a planned donation that eventually totaled $15 million. The Global Cities Initiative, another document written by a Brookings senior fellow explained, \u201cmust mean a marriage between JPMC corporate interests\u201d and \u201cBrookings continued thought leadership. \u201d JPMorgan, in a document dated a month before the agreement was signed, said the pending donation to Brookings \u201c  relationships with important client base among business and civic leaders both in the U. S. and abroad. \u201d And Brookings was ready to do its part. \u201cOur events, which in part target these audiences,\u201d said an internal 2014 Brookings memo, referring to the Global Cities Initiative and federal and state leaders, \u201chave yielded 100+ media hits, with 97% of them referencing GCI and 90% referencing JPMorgan by the end of this year, we will have held events in 13 domestic markets and 9 international markets. \u201d At times, Brookings officials seemed worried they were not doing enough for the bank. \u201cNo one wants to create overt marketing opportunities for JPMC, but we need to carve out roles and thought leadership opportunity for market presidents,\u201d said a 2013 Brookings memo, referring to a dinner with the bank\u2019s executives. \u201cWe need to do a better job tying it back to JPMC. \u201d It remains difficult to assess whether the relationship helped the bank\u2019s business, but Mr. Scher said that was not the goal. \u201cIf the Global Cities Initiative strengthens the economic competitiveness of cities, it\u2019s a win for small businesses, job creation and everyone involved in these communities, including us,\u201d Mr. Scher said in a statement. Donations from the corporations to Brookings are tax exempt based on the premise that the think tank\u2019s work benefits the public good, not a company\u2019s bottom line. But two lawyers who specialize in nonprofit law  \u2014   Miranda Perry Fleischer, a professor at the University of San Diego School of Law, and Clifford Perlman, a partner at a New   firm  \u2014   said Brookings\u2019s agreements raised questions. \u201cTax deductions are subsidies that are paid for by all taxpayers,\u201d Ms. Fleischer said. \u201cAnd the reason the subsidy is provided is that the charitable organization is supposed to be doing something for the public good, not that specifically benefits the private individual or corporation in the form of providing them goods or services. \u201d Mr. Indyk said that opinion was \u201ctotally unfounded,\u201d noting that Brookings had retained its own lawyers to review the documents and found no problems. \u201cBrookings\u2019s conclusion that all of these activities it engaged in with these donors primarily benefited the public rather than the donors is consistent with the applicable federal tax standards,\u201d Douglas Varley, one of the lawyers for Brookings, said in a statement. Other think tanks have been even more closely aligned with corporate agendas. FedEx teamed up with the Atlantic Council  \u2014   a think tank that focuses on international relations, with annual revenue that has surged to $21 million from $2 million in the last decade  \u2014   to build support for a   agreement the company hoped would increase business. Six months before the Atlantic Council report was issued, FedEx and the think tank worked on plans to use the report as a lobbying tool. \u201cThe impact and reach of the report would be maximized by a rollout event\u201d including a \u201cpublic report launch with member( s) of Congress from one of the relevant committees,\u201d said a   summary drafted by the Atlantic Council months before the study was completed. FedEx and the Atlantic Council, working with the European American Chamber of Commerce, also told companies being asked to participate in the study that the goal was to \u201cemphasize the positive impact that a comprehensive agreement would have on American and European small businesses. \u201d When the report came out in late 2014, its conclusions mirrored arguments FedEx had been aggressively pushing on Capitol Hill, including recommending a reduction in   tariffs and allowing more   shipments. An executive vice president at FedEx, Rajesh Subramaniam, attended an event at Atlantic Council headquarters in Washington to celebrate the release of the final report. So did a key supporter, Representative Erik Paulsen, Republican of Minnesota. \u201cThis is very exciting,\u201d Mr. Subramaniam said at the event, referring to the potential for more trade. \u201cThe upside opportunity is quite large. \u201d Frederick Kempe, the Atlantic Council president, said that FedEx had donated just $20, 000 to help fund the effort and that the staff at the Atlantic Council had handled the research. \u201cThere is no doubt the work of think tanks has more credibility than the work of lobbyists, but the only way we preserve it is through intellectual independence,\u201d Mr. Kempe said. General Atomics, the   manufacturer of Predator drones, had a clear problem. Prospects for sales were falling as the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq wound down. The company wanted the Obama administration to change its policy to allow for sales to other countries, a lucrative proposition. \u201cWhen the budgets are going down in the U. S. you would like to be able to export more,\u201d Frank Pace, the president of the company\u2019s aircraft systems group, told a Reuters reporter in late 2013 at an air show in Dubai. At about that time, the industry turned to the Center for Strategic and International Studies for help, providing money that the think tank used to conduct a study on drone policy, including exports. While defense contracting giants like Lockheed Martin and Boeing have cumulatively donated at least $77 million since 2010 to two dozen think tanks, disclosure records show, General Atomics\u2019s contribution to the Center for Strategic and International Studies was quite small  \u2014   in the tens of thousands of dollars. C. S. I. S. set up confidential meetings at its headquarters with company representatives, inviting top officials from the Navy, the Air Force, the Marine Corps, the Coast Guard, the State Department and the office of the defense secretary, according to emails and other documents obtained by The Times through open records requests. \u201cOur series will be unique in convening a much broader group of stakeholders than is typical,\u201d Samuel J. Brannen, the think tank\u2019s lead scholar, wrote in an email to Aaron W. Jost, one of the State Department officials in charge of regulating drone exports. As a think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies did not file a lobbying report, but the goals of the effort were clear. \u201cPolitical obstacles to export,\u201d read the agenda of one   \u201cworking group\u201d meeting organized by Mr. Brannen that included Tom Rice, a lobbyist in General Atomics\u2019s Washington office, on the invitation lists, the emails show. Boeing and Lockheed Martin, drone makers that were major C. S. I. S. contributors, were also invited to attend the sessions, the emails show. The meetings and research culminated with a report released in February 2014 that reflected the industry\u2019s priorities. \u201cI came out strongly in support of export,\u201d Mr. Brannen, the lead author of the study, wrote in an email to Kenneth B. Handelman, the deputy assistant secretary of state for defense trade controls. But the effort did not stop there. Mr. Brannen initiated meetings with Defense Department officials and congressional staff to push for the recommendations, which also included setting up a new Pentagon office to give more focus to acquisition and deployment of drones. The center also stressed the need to ease export limits at a conference it  hosted at its headquarters featuring top officials from the Navy, the Air Force and the Marine Corps. Mr. Brannen, who has since left C. S. I. S. declined to comment. The think tank insisted that its efforts to influence administration policy were not lobbying. \u201cC. S. I. S. will not represent any donor before any government office or entity, including congressional lawmakers and executive branch officials,\u201d Mr. Hamre, the chief executive, said in his statement to The Times. \u201cWe do not lobby. \u201d One thing is clear: The result was a victory for General Atomics. In February 2015, almost one year after the C. S. I. S. report was issued, the State Department announced a clarification of its rules, easing final approval that month for General Atomics\u2019s   sale of unarmed Predator drones to the United Arab Emirates, the first such sale to a   nation. The think tank report was just one of many voices pushing for the change. A State Department spokesman said that while the government officials involved in the review had received opinions from think tanks and industry officials, \u201cat the end of the day, this is a considered U. S. government policy. \u201d Huntington Ingalls Industries had an equally clear objective: to create an elaborate public relations and lobbying campaign to convince Congress that the nation needed to confront an emerging threat from China by building more   aircraft carriers  \u2014   at a cost of about $11 billion each. The clear beneficiary? Huntington, the lone builder of the ships. As part of a broader communications effort, Huntington helped finance a think tank report that enhanced the company\u2019s argument for more funding. Bryan McGrath, a former naval officer who had commanded a   destroyer, approached Huntington Ingalls and offered to write a study on a    basis as a private industry expert. The company turned down his offer. Later, after he had joined the Hudson Institute and helped create the Center for American Seapower, he approached Huntington officials again, and they were interested. \u201cA think tank has more prestige,\u201d Mr. McGrath said. Huntington Ingalls paid $100, 000 to fund the work, a critical commitment for Mr. McGrath, who said he was paid by Hudson only if he could successfully solicit donations to support his research. Mr. McGrath said he had always been a strong proponent of aircraft carriers, so the company was not buying his opinion. \u201cThe Hudson Center makes no secret about being very   power,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a company came that wanted us to write a piece that advocated for something other than that, the answer would be no. \u201d In exchange for Huntington Ingalls\u2019s support, company officials were given regular briefings on the research and the opportunity to suggest revisions to early drafts, Mr. McGrath said. \u201cWe have an iterative process already laid out in which we will sit down with them and go through drafts and discuss where we are going,\u201d Mr. McGrath said. He added that he had not accepted all of the company\u2019s suggestions. The report was released in October at the Rayburn House Office Building. Mr. McGrath received an introduction from one of the industry\u2019s most important boosters, Representative J. Randy Forbes, Republican of Virginia, the chairman of the House Armed Services subcommittee that oversees the Navy. The report did not mention that Huntington Ingalls had helped pay for it. Asked about the failure to disclose the contribution, John P. Walters, Hudson\u2019s chief operating officer, called it a mistake. The report was subsequently revised  \u2014   months after it was released and the congressional event held  \u2014   to disclose the donation. A second   report, prepared by the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, came out a month later with a similar urgent call for more money to build more ships and to base more ships abroad, although it did not mention that it had been funded by the Navy League of the United States, a nonprofit group whose large corporate donors include Huntington Ingalls. \u201cThis report is yet another important tool for Navy Leaguers to use in the field when educating local leaders and lawmakers,\u201d Skip Witunski, the Navy League president, wrote to the group\u2019s members late last year. The strategy  \u2014   lining up think tank reports as lobbying tools that echoed each other  \u2014   was backed up with a series of letters to the editor, dozens of posts on Twitter and Facebook, and   pieces. Mr. McGrath said he, too, wondered if this storm of   work might be threatening the integrity of the process. \u201cI see a lot of stuff that comes out in Washington,\u201d Mr. McGrath said, \u201cand I got to scratch my head and say, \u2018That guy must be on the payroll. \u2019\u201d'"}, "time": 1742628526.3969924}
