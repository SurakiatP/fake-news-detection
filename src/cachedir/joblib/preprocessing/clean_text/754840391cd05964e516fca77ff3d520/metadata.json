Instead, he gave every single Democrat in the country more than enough of a reason to vote for Hillary. Oops. \\nOn his Twitter account, Walker tweeted a photo of Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama embracing, he captioned the moment \u201cIf you like the past 8 years, vote Hillary Clinton.\u201d If you like the past 8 years, vote @HillaryClinton . pic.twitter.com/cQEtIgPsEz \\n\u2014 Scott Walker (@ScottWalker) November 1, 2016 \\nIn Walker\u2019s right-wing bubble that may be a stinging critique. To most of America, that\u2019s a great reason to vote Hillary. President Obama is currently seeing his favorability ratings surging. His presidency, and the accomplishments he\u2019s made during it, are very popular. At this moment, Gallup found 54 percent of Americans said they approved of Obama. His popularity outstrips Republican icon Ronald Reagan at the same time during his presidency. \\nLots of people like the past 8 years under Obama . \\nThe internet was bemused by Walker\u2019s tone-deaf plea. It seems like this could literally be a Clinton campaign tweet given Obama\u2019s approval rating. https://t.co/oHi573bllj'"}, "time": 1742563953.9529974}
