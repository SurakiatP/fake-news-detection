We understood that these images were a bit crass and promised to remove them if Trump were to win the election, as a sign of respect for the office of the United States presidency. True to our word, we tried to take these pictures down as soon as Trump was elected, but unfortunately we haven\u2019t been able to figure out how to delete this article from our website. Once content is published to our homepage, it seems to be stuck there. Though we cannot delete the bald Photoshops, we have been able to stretch out Donald Trump\u2019s face all wide so that you can\u2019t even tell he\u2019s the one in the pictures. We hope this serves as an adequate temporary solution until we find a way to take these unbecoming images down completely. 1. At the current time, we are comfortable posting this picture with the caption \u201cMy bald spot is absolutely yuge\u201d alongside it, but should Trump assume the esteemed office of president in the fall, we would immediately remove it. \\nWe apologize that we weren\u2019t able to remove this disrespectful picture of our president-elect completely, but we did what we could and stretched it out all wide. You can barely tell it\u2019s Donald Trump. 2. Regardless of whatever political views you hold, it is disrespectful to show a picture of the commander-in-chief along with a caption like \u201cSo this is what that pile of straw on his head is for.\u201d \\nWe\u2019re talking with our programmers now to figure out a way to delete these images from the web. Hopefully they will develop a method for doing so in the near future. In the meantime, we have preserved the dignity of President-elect Trump by stretching his face out and making his eyes huge. Nobody will be able to recognize that the man in this image is our new president. 3. Of course, it would still be fine to disagree with President Trump if you don\u2019t support his policies. A healthy democracy allows dissent and debate. However, implying that the president wears a toupee when there is no evidence that he does is a crass breach of proper decorum. \\nThe presidency is the most hallowed office in our nation, and it is worthy of reverence and decorum at all times. Ideally, this image of Donald Trump\u2019s toupee flying off in the wind would no longer be on our website. Since this is currently impossible, we\u2019ve used the magic of Photoshop to make his head very tall and thin. His identity is obscured. This bald man could be anybody. 4. No matter who is president, you address them as \u201cSir,\u201d not \u201cDonald the Hutt.\u201d We would quickly remove this if the American people choose Trump on November 8. \\nThis degrading Photoshop of President Trump\u2019s face on Jabba the Hutt\u2019s body is immature and degrading, and we\u2019d remove it if we could. Since we currently don\u2019t know how, we\u2019ve at least given him a tie to wear to imbue him with the poise and decorum the presidency confers on all who hold that hallowed office. 5. Comparing President Trump to Adolf Hitler would remain a valid political commentary, but making him bald in addition is completely uncalled for. If Donald Trump is elected, we promise to restore his normal hair to this image. \\nNow that the American electorate has chosen Donald Trump to lead our nation, this image depicting him as a bald Adolf Hitler has become an unsubtle and tactless political statement that does not meet our exacting editorial standards. We\u2019ve given President-elect Trump his hair back in an effort to restore his dignity. 6. For now, let us enjoy this humorous Photoshop and its accompanying caption, \u201cI am going to build a wig, and Mexico is going to pay for it.\u201d During a Trump presidency, it would no longer have a place in the national discourse. \\nAll right, that\u2019s all of them. We\u2019ve stretched out President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s face all wide so that nobody will know that he is the bald man in this picture. Hopefully, we\u2019ll find a way to remove these pictures from our website, but until then, this will have to do.'"}, "time": 1742562969.9391685}
