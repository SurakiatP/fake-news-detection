[Beyonc\u00e9 leads all artists with nine nominations, including for Album of the Year for her Black Lives   album Lemonade, though she will face stiff competition from British superstar Adele in several of the night\u2019s top categories.  Singer Rihanna and rappers Drake and Kanye West are up for eight nominations apiece. Late Late Show host James Corden is set to MC the proceedings. Meanwhile, producer Ken Ehrlich has indicated that artists could get more political with their acceptance speeches than usual. Follow along with the Breitbart News livewire as the Grammys get underway in Los Angeles. All times Pacific. Latest updates at the top.   8:45 P. M.  \u2014   Well, that\u2019s a wrap on the  . Stay tuned to Breitbart\u2019s Big Hollywood for   coverage and more from music\u2019s biggest night. Good night.     8:40 P. M.  \u2014   Well, she\u2019s done it. Adele picked up Album of the Year for 25. In the \u201cAdele vs. Beyonc\u00e9 battle\u201d that the music press spent the last couple months pushing, that\u2019s a decisive win for Adele. In her acceptance speech, a tearful Adele called Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s album \u201cmonumental\u201d and appeared to drop another   leading to another dead air pause from CBS. Adele wins Album of the Year, dedicates it to Beyonce: \u201dI can\u2019t possibly accept this award.\u201d #GRAMMYs pic. twitter.   \u2014   Hollywood Reporter (@THR) February 13, 2017,  8:35 P. M.  \u2014   Adele wins again, this time for Record of the Year for \u201cHello. \u201d That\u2019s two big wins over Beyonc\u00e9 so far. A win in Album of the Year would complete the British singer\u2019s sweep. Stay tuned  \u2026    . 8:28 P. M.  \u2014   The Grammys pay tribute to the musicians lost over the past year with an \u201cIn Memoriam\u201d segment hosted by John Legend and Cynthia Erivo.

M.  \u2014   Recording Academy President Neil Portnow calls on President Trump and Congress to uphold the country\u2019s commitments to the arts. The industry may be afraid that Trump will get rid of the National Endowment for the Arts, as it was reported he might do last month. 8:20 P. M.  \u2014   James Corden teases that Kanye West will present at the show and for a second, it seems like the broadcast could take a turn for the more entertaining  \u2026     Alas, Corden introduces Recording Academy President Neil Portnow. 8:12 P. M.  \u2014     winner tonight Chance the Rapper performs with the backing of a full orchesta. 8:08 P.

Could have done with fewer performances three hours would be a good length for the show. As it is, probably around 40 minutes left to go tonight. *Pentatonix, not Little Big Town. Like I said, the show\u2019s length is taking its toll. 7:50 P. M.  \u2014   A reunited The Time and Bruno Mars take the stage to perform a   tribute to Prince. Full video when the performance is wrapped. This is a fitting tribute to Prince, especially with Mars in full purple getup. Immeasurably better than Madonna\u2019s horrific attempt at the same tribute at last year\u2019s Billboard Music Awards.  7:39 P. M.  \u2014   Busta Rhymes joins the surviving members of A Tribe Called Quest for a tribute to Phife Dawg, who died last year. Busta goes off on Trump, calling him \u201cPresident Agent Orange\u201d and accusing him of \u201cspreading hate\u201d throughout the world. More on this here. 7:36 P. M.  \u2014   Adele wins Song of the Year for \u201cHello,\u201d beating out fellow frontrunner Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cFormation. \u201d \u201cFirst of all, I really do apologize for swearing,\u201d the singer says, explaining that she wanted to get the performance just right to honor the memory George Michael. 7:25 P.

M.  \u2014   As Roger Friedman reported this afternoon, Adele is back to perform George Michael\u2019s \u201cFastlove. \u201d Wow. CBS bleeps out Adele during the performance as the singer swears and is forced to restart the song after a rocky start. Full video coming shortly. Other than the initial flub, Adele sounded much better on this one than in her   \u201cHello. \u201d Full video: Watch Adele\u2019s tribute to George Michael in full here: pic. twitter.   \u2014   Adele Daily (@AdeleDailyInfo) February 13, 2017,  \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t mess this up for him. \u201d 6:45 P.

M.  \u2014   Gary Clark, Jr. and William Bell perform a bluesy \u201cBorn Under A Bad Sign\u201d in one of the night\u2019s better performances.  6:33 P. M.  \u2014   James Corden gets in another quick jab at Trump with a bit about   during the show. #GRAMMYS @JKCorden jokes: \u201dAny fake tweets you see are not real tweets. The negative tweets are fake.\u201d https:  .  pic. twitter.   \u2014   Hollywood Reporter (@THR) February 13, 2017,  \u201cAny fake tweets you see [on the bottom of the screen] are fake news!\u201d he says, as apparently   negative tweets float by on the screen, including a fake one from Trump himself. 6:30 P. M.  \u2014   Katy Perry delivers the first real onstage political statement by wearing a sparkly armband reading \u201cPersist\u201d* on her right arm during the performance of her new song, \u201cChained to the Rhythm. \u201d *From where I was sitting, it looked like the armband had said \u201cResist. \u201d Chained to The Rhythm  \u2014   Katy Perry Feat.

M.  \u2014   One hour into the    broadcast and there\u2019s been very little in the way of overt partisan political commentary so far, apart from Corden\u2019s   jab at Trump in his opening routine. Then again, there\u2019s still two hours to go  \u2026     5:54 P. M.  \u2014   A very pregnant Beyonc\u00e9 takes the stage for a trippy performance of \u201cLove Drought\u201d and \u201cSand Castles. \u201d The performance apparently incorporates   footage along with some impressive live choreography.

Sheeran performs his new song \u201cThe Shape of You\u201d by himself, using an   looping rig to provide his own backbeat.

M.  \u2014   Twenty One Pilots wins the Grammy for Best Pop   Performance for \u201cStressed Out. \u201d Before accepting the award, the duo take their pants off before they take make their way onto the stage.
