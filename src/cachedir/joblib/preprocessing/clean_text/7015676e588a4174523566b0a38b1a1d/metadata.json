President Donald Trump signed executive orders aimed at rolling back   financial regulations. The rules of the   Act were intended to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. Democrats and consumer groups called Mr. Trump\u2019s orders a gift to Wall Street. A government lawyer said more than 100, 000 visas were revoked by the Trump administration as part of the president\u2019s ban on travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries. The State Department said the number was \u201cfewer than 60, 000. \u201d And Kellyanne Conway, the president\u2019s adviser, said she erred when she talked about a \u201cBowling Green massacre\u201d that never occurred. _____ 2. Confirmation hearings for Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet nominees will pick up next week. Betsy DeVos, the nominee for education secretary, is expected to have a final,   confirmation vote on Tuesday. After Ms. DeVos seemed ignorant of major provisions of education law, some Senate offices reported receiving more calls opposing Ms. DeVos than any other Trump nominee. _____ 3. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump questioned a deal to bring migrants held by Australia into the United States as refugees. But on Thursday, his spokesman said he would honor the deal. Here is a video of what daily life looks like for one of them, a Kurdish dissident from Iran. He has been held on Manus Island for over three years. \u201cTake us from this hellhole prison,\u201d he pleads. _____ 4. As the New England Patriots seek their fifth N. F. L. championship this weekend, controlling the explosive Atlanta Falcons  \u2014   who are looking for their first title  \u2014   will be a major challenge. Here is a look at the championship matchup in Houston and who we think will win. Now, what to cook for the game. Our collection of Super Bowl recipes includes dips, chicken wings, potato skins, chilis, cheese steaks, nachos and vegetarian options. _____ 5. A little more than a week ago, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon seemed all but certain to become France\u2019s next president. Now he\u2019s in deep trouble for payments of nearly $1 million from the public payroll to his wife and children. The scandal has tapped a wellspring of anger in the French electorate and called into question the standard operating procedures of the political class. The country has been in a state of emergency since the 2015 terror attack in Paris. Early Friday, a man shouting \u201cGod is great\u201d in Arabic, tried to attack soldiers outside the Louvre. He was shot and no one else was injured. _____ 6. Photos and video from a spectacular sight off the coast of Hawaii circulated on social media this week. The images showed hundreds of millions of gallons of lava flowing into the ocean, like blood from a ruptured artery. Visible lava streams usually last only a day. This one began on New Year\u2019s Eve and ended on Thursday, when a seacliff collapsed and cut it off. _____ 7. More young women are smoking pot while they\u2019re pregnant. Most think it\u2019s harmless. But preliminary research suggests otherwise. Experts say marijuana\u2019s main psychoactive ingredient, THC, can cross the placenta to reach the fetus, potentially harming brain development, cognition and birth weight. (If you\u2019ve used marijuana while pregnant, we\u2019d like to hear from you. We won\u2019t publish any of the information without your permission.) _____ 8. We\u2019re doing a series on the \u201clions of New York,\u201d the movers and shakers who helped shape the city\u2019s comeback from the depths of crisis in the 1970s and \u201980s. This week we speak with Harry Belafonte, the   singer and a pillar of the civil rights movement. At 89, he is anxious about voting rights, police violence and the state of the movement he helped build. _____ 9. Sales of George Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984\u201d are up since the election. And now it\u2019s coming to Broadway. Producers plan to bring an adaptation of the 1949 novel to the Hudson Theater in June. It was previously staged in Britain. There\u2019s no word on the cast yet. _____ 10. Finally, if you\u2019re planning on warming up the couch before the Super Bowl, here are the latest recommendations from \u201cWatching,\u201d our team of TV and movie experts. They\u2019ve compiled a list of the best movies and TV shows on Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and HBO in February, and a guide to your options depending on how much time you have. One of their top picks is Netflix\u2019s \u201cSanta Clarita Diet,\u201d starring Drew Barrymore, above, as a zombie. Have a great weekend. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.
