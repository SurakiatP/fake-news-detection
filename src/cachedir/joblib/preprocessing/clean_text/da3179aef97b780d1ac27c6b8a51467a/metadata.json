Hillary Clinton accepted the Democratic presidential nomination tonight, taking American women to a new political peak. She offered a vision of unity, saying, \u201cWhen any barrier falls in America, for anyone, it clears the way for everyone. When there are no ceilings, the sky\u2019s the limit. \u201d Her speech directly challenged Donald Trump\u2019s ability to lead. \u201cA man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. Mrs. Clinton was introduced by Chelsea Clinton, who may play a White House role if her mother wins. \u201cI\u2019m voting for a fighter who never, ever gives up,\u201d Ms. Clinton said. _____ 2. Mr. Trump said his call for Russia to hack into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email was meant as sarcasm. But he also added to his previous praise for Vladimir Putin, saying the Russian president was \u201ca better leader than Obama. \u201d Above, a short video looking at the history of the   relationship. Mr. Trump\u2019s comments have been criticized by former government officials of both major parties, as well as many foreign policy experts. Some say the security briefings he is now entitled to should be curtailed, while he counters that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email troubles prove she should not be trusted with the briefings. _____ 3. How is Fox News getting along without its creator, Roger Ailes? Mr. Ailes left under a cloud after a lawsuit accused him of sexual harassment, which then drew corroborating accounts. Nothing looks all that different onscreen in the convention coverage. But when the cameras are off, two people with direct knowledge said, an icy silence descends over the anchor Megyn Kelly, who cooperated with the investigation into Mr. Ailes, and the   Bret Baier and Brit Hume. _____ 4. The   purge being carried out by Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has sidelined or jailed half of the country\u2019s top generals and admirals. Some analysts warned of dangerous consequences. \u201cWith its main pillar, the military, broken, the Turkish state will no longer be able to check a divided society or effectively counter security threats,\u201d one said. Above, the army\u2019s remaining top officers gathered in Ankara, the capital. _____ 5. U. S. officials say they have new hope against the Islamic State. A trove of more than 10, 000 documents and 4. 5 terabytes of digital data recently seized in northern Syria traces the movements of militants. The information, which is being shared with allies, could help direct battlefield operations and keep plotters from entering Europe. Above, ISIS fighters in 2014. _____ 6. Pope Francis addressed a vast crowd of young people gathered for the Catholic Church\u2019s World Youth Day in Krakow, Poland. Earlier, saying Mass at a revered monastery to commemorate the 1, 050th anniversary of the country\u2019s conversion to Christianity, Francis stumbled and fell, to the consternation of thousands of assembled pilgrims. He rose unharmed. _____ 7. Opposing marches are being held in a mostly white Boston suburb divided by concerns over police shootings and police safety. The galvanizing issue is a \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d sign hung at City Hall in Somerville, Mass. almost a year ago. The local police are rallying to demand that the mayor, the son of Italian immigrants, put up one saying \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d instead, while counterdemonstrators plan to urge him to keep it. _____ 8. Officials at the Bank of Japan, above, meet Friday to come up with more ways to try to end its country\u2019s long bout with deflation. One option on the table is something economists call helicopter money: dropping money from the sky, to be freely spent. Sadly, that\u2019s just a metaphor. In reality, it means printing more money to pay for government spending on public works, mass distribution of funds to citizens or tax cuts. _____ 9. The weekend is almost here. Got plans? Our movie reviewer says \u201cJason Bourne,\u201d the fifth installment of the   franchise, may have rote aspects. But he says that tone befits a film that is less a thriller than \u201ca somber meditation on the crisis of the   professional in the throes of middle age. \u201d And there\u2019s \u201cBad Moms,\u201d featuring six overachieving female characters summed up by the lines: \u201cWe\u2019re killing ourselves to be perfect and it\u2019s making us insane. Screw it. \u201d Also, check out our Book Review\u2019s roundup of summer thrillers. _____ 10. And maybe exercise a bit. A new study found that being out of shape may be second only to smoking as a risk factor for premature death. \u201cEven small amounts of physical activity may have positive effects on fitness,\u201d the lead researcher said. _____ 11. Finally, we leave you with a great dessert for summer: thick, strained yogurt, sweetened and enhanced with pistachios or almonds, cardamom and saffron. Called shrikhand in India, it suits spoons everywhere. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern. And don\u2019t miss Your Morning Briefing, posted weekdays at 6 a. m.
