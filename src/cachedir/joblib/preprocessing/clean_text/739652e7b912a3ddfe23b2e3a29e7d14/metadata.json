Bullying free speech \u2014 one of the first rights we as Americans are entitled to under constitutional law \u2014 was standard operating procedure for officers who threatened students giving out copies of the document to fellow classmates. \\nGrand Valley State University didn\u2019t stand behind students\u2019 rights when they were threatened for handing out the constitution and pamphlets promoting their newly created group, citing an obscure commandment from the \u2018office of student life.\u2019 Instead the school backed up threats of arrest issued by police officers. \\nCampus Reform stated that one officer told students , \u201cIn order to do that, you gotta be approved by the office of student life,\u201d asserting that the school policy applies to any distribution of materials, even if one is not selling something or asking for monetary contributions. \\nNathan Berning, a Michigan field representative from the Leadership Institute who was advising the students over the phone during the altercation, told Campus Reform that he found it \u201cunacceptable\u201d that a person \u201ccan\u2019t hand out Constitutions to college students\u201d in a country that enshrines free speech in its founding document. \\nInstead of facing time in jail, the students politely discontinued their act of passing out materials, even though this is protected by law. Berning attests this is the third incidence lately of students being threatened for expressing their freedom of speech, even in protected \u2018Free Speech Zones.\u2019 \\nThese zones are controversial to begin with. West Virginia University recently censored their students to two small areas of campus in which they are allowed to express their thoughts. Ninety-nine percent of campus was off limits to anyone who wanted to have their way with the First Amendment. \\nAs one Huffington Post article offers , a \u201cFree Speech Zone\u2019 is a backwards way of saying, \u201cJust shut up\u201d to University students. At a recent Yale University discussion on the topic, 66 percent of attendees felt their first amendment rights were being trampled on with these euphemist \u2018zones.\u2019 \\nA NY Times blogger on the topic called them micro-aggressions to young people and University students at large. \\nThe University of Chicago is taking a differen t tack. John Ellison, dean of students, wrote to a recent class of freshman, \\n\u201cOur commitment to academic freedom means that we do not support so-called trigger warnings, we do not cancel invited speakers because their topics might prove controversial, and we do not condone the creation of intellectual \u2018safe spaces\u2019 where individuals can retreat from ideas and perspectives at odds with their own .\u201d \\nThe Foundation for Individual Rights in Education or FIRE recently launched a national campaign asking colleges and universities to adopt the free speech policy statement produced by the Committee on Freedom of Expression at the University of Chicago. The statement guarantees \u201call members of the University community the broadest possible latitude to speak, write, listen, challenge, and learn,\u201d and makes clear that \u201cit is not the proper role of the University to attempt to shield individuals from ideas and opinions they find unwelcome, disagreeable, or even deeply offensive.\u201d \\nThe GVSU reaction to free speech on campus is particularly alarming considering that students pay more than ever to attend institutions of \u2018higher learning\u2019 which have become nothing more than an extension of the corporation. Student loan debt now exceeds $1 trillion in the U.S., and while universities are more than eager to take students cash, they aren\u2019t so keen on protecting their rights to free expression. Getting that highly coveted certificate of graduation has become more expensive than ever, but it isn\u2019t just money at stake.
