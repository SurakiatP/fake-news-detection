Weiner is off Twitter. This is the Democratic former congressman and repeat candidate for mayor of New York who extinguished his own political career with a series of lewd social media messages to strangers. The human implosion who spent years scrubbing the stains out of his reputation, with regular media appearances and Twitter commentary as the mop. The punch line who has now lost just about everything but his unfortunate name to revelations that he had, once again, exchanged sexually charged Twitter messages with a woman he had never met. But for Mr. Weiner, there always seemed to be something else to say. Normally too defiant to lie low, Mr. Weiner has always insisted he had no choice but to stay in the game. But in the wake of his third instance of scandal in five years, friends say he is wholly devastated and uncertain about the future. His wife, Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton, announced their separation on Monday. The Daily News and NY1, two of the media outlets that still offered him a platform for his ideas and his political expertise, have cut ties with him. Mr. Weiner has been seeing a therapist, according to one friend who spoke to him recently. To talk about Mr. Weiner is to deal in metaphor and allegory his problems must always mean something else. Amateur psychoanalysts are, suddenly, everywhere, the way sexting experts were in the days after his 2011 resignation from Congress. His basic humanity is obscured by the public character he and the New York news media  \u2014   the world\u2019s biggest, hungriest pack of journalists  \u2014   jointly conspired to create: Anthony Weiner, loudmouth liberal hero from Brooklyn turned tragic hero of tabloid proportions. He continues to be the easiest of targets. \u201cIt\u2019s sad and a little bit ironic that a guy who understood the intersection of politics and technology and media better than anyone, and exploited it better than anyone to fuel his rise, fell because of it,\u201d said Stu Loeser, a former spokesman for Senator Chuck Schumer and former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. Mr. Loeser has known Mr. Weiner since working for Mr. Schumer, Mr. Weiner\u2019s old mentor, in the early 2000s. \u201cRemoving himself from the public conversation, he\u2019s taking himself out of the part of the equation that has proven again and again to be part of his downfall,\u201d Mr. Loeser said. If giving up his microphone was an attempt by Mr. Weiner to reclaim private citizenship, it may have come too late. A former public official with a powerful wife who never seemed quite convinced that he belonged out of the spotlight, Mr. Weiner was unreluctantly dragged back into it time after time by a public that refused to avert its eyes from him. (His recent turn as the subject of \u201cWeiner,\u201d the documentary released this year that chronicled the abrupt collapse of his 2013 mayoral bid amid revelations that he had sent sexually charged photos to admirers under the pseudonym \u201cCarlos Danger,\u201d did not help.) Friends and associates contacted for this article, most of whom asked to remain anonymous because they did not wish to be seen as inflaming the spectacle, said his near silence seemed to reflect an acknowledgment of the depth of the crisis confronting him and his marriage. Mr. Weiner has told friends that he feels deeply remorseful about the fresh humiliation the documentary dredged up for his wife. And in recent months, as Ms. Abedin shadowed Mrs. Clinton on the presidential campaign trail, Mr. Weiner felt he owed it to his wife to embrace a supporting role. At home with their    son, Jordan, Mr. Weiner kept busy cooking the Blue Apron meals Ms. Abedin ordered for them. \u201cI think one of the blessings, in his mind, of the first scandal was how much time he did get to spend with Jordan,\u201d a person who is friendly with Mr. Weiner said, explaining that if he had remained in Congress, he would have seen his son infrequently. \u201cThe time with Jordan  \u2014   he really seemed to enjoy and thrive on it. \u201d The latest blast of scandal was especially shattering to Mr. Weiner, three of these people said, because he was what they described as an intensely caring and devoted father to Jordan, who appeared, asleep, in one of the photographs of Mr. Weiner\u2019s crotch. On Wednesday, The New York Post reported that the city\u2019s Administration for Children\u2019s Services had opened an investigation into Mr. Weiner\u2019s treatment of his son. Mr. Weiner, in his only comment to The New York Times, said via email, \u201cWe haven\u2019t been contacted by A. C. S. \u201d An agency spokeswoman, citing privacy, said it could not comment on whether a case had been opened. In the documentary, Mr. Weiner explains that his virtual encounters were like a \u201cvideo game\u201d to him. But several of his friends and associates said Mr. Weiner\u2019s third indiscretion had convinced them that he had an addiction or another clinical disorder, though he has denied as much in the past. With Mr. Weiner\u2019s every round of   the hallmarks of addiction seem increasingly to apply, though the psychiatrists interviewed for this article emphasized that they could not give a diagnosis for Mr. Weiner without evaluating him in person. \u201cThere\u2019s behavior where you can\u2019t stop what you\u2019re doing, and it makes no sense,\u201d said Dr. Kenneth P. Rosenberg, an addiction psychiatrist and clinical associate professor at     Cornell Medical Center. \u201cIf it crosses over the threshold of causing significant problems for you  \u2014   personal, occupational, social problems  \u2014   then in my mind, you\u2019ve earned the diagnosis of addiction. \u201d Asked by Bloomberg News in January why he continued to use social media, Mr. Weiner portrayed the activity as part of his professional and civic identity. \u201cI have no choice but to not let it debilitate me,\u201d he said, referring to the scandals. \u201cIt also doesn\u2019t make me care any less, or make me think that if I have something clever to say on Twitter I shouldn\u2019t say it, or if I have an idea I shouldn\u2019t espouse it, or if I have a company that needs my help I shouldn\u2019t help, or if someone calls me for advice on how to run for office I shouldn\u2019t sit down with him. I don\u2019t know what my alternative is. \u201d He repeated the argument as he granted an interview to The New York Times Magazine appeared on Stephen Colbert\u2019s and Bill Maher\u2019s television shows during the week of the Democratic National Convention, among other television forays penned columns in The Daily News and continued to joust and kibitz with reporters, ideological adversaries and random people on Twitter. Mr. Loeser offered Mr. Weiner, whom he called a \u201cflawed genius,\u201d a flicker of hope that he could find a way to stay engaged: Mr. Weiner\u2019s mastery of liberal crosscurrents and media appetite would make him, in Mr. Loeser\u2019s estimation, a smart person to hire for any organization looking to push a message. (Mr. Weiner has also acted as a consultant for private clients.) This will be Mr. Weiner\u2019s third stab at addressing a scandal of his own making. The last time, he held a news conference, his wife smiling at his side. This time, however, there is no public constituency he is obligated to address  \u2014   only public curiosity, waiting, insatiably, for answers.'"}, "time": 1742561985.059098}
