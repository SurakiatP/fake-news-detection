He was apprehended when he and his team were proofreading his suicide note before attempting suicide. \\nHe was later sent to 14 days judicial custody where he is currently undergoing a refresher course in grammar and spelling. \\nThe incident happened yesterday when AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal organized an impromptu protest rally at Jantar Mantar to expose Narendra Modi, but unfortunately no one from the media turned up for the event. Crestfallen, Mr. Kejriwal decided to go back on Twitter and continue his service for his constituency when an idea crossed his mind. He shared the idea with Ashutosh and urged him to commit suicide. \\n\u201cBut this is not what I was looking forward to when I joined AAP,\u201d retorted Ashutosh. \\n\u201cNo, you are not going to die. You will just attempt a suicide. We will call media to cover the event. Just imagine, you will be making headlines, you will be trending on Twitter, everyone will be talking about you. It will be so cool!\u201d \\n\u201cOk, you do it then if it\u2019s so cool.\u201d \\n\u201cNo, I need to oversee the whole event. See, there are two options for you, either do it or find another party.\u201d \\n\u2018\u2018Which party will take me if I leave AAP?\u2019 he pondered for a while and said, \u201cOk, let\u2019s do it.\u201d \\n\u201cCool, now write a suicide note and let\u2019s get on with this.\u201d \\n\u201cOk.\u201d \\nAAP party workers gathered around Ashutosh as he typed the opening line on Microsoft Word that read, \u201cI holed Modi resoncible for my deth\u2026\u201d \\nA crack team of 5 proof readers was formed immediately, who advised him about the correction the sentence demanded. \\nHe grinned and typed, \u201c sorry responcible \u2026not resoncible .. \u201d \\n\u201cNo, you can just delete the words and\u2026\u201d \\nAnother 5 proof readers were hired urgently to strengthen the team as he continued to type the letter. \\nBy the time he completed the letter, the language settings on MS Word had automatically turned into Spanish. \\n\u201cDone,\u201d Ashutosh pronounced with a satisfactory smile as he beheld his creation for a few seconds before calling police to inform them about his plan. \\n\u201cSir wait, we haven\u2019t started proofreading yet,\u201d implored one of the newly hired proofreaders. \\n\u201cDo you want me to die for real or what?\u201d \\n\u201cNo but at least the attempt should look genuine and not a hoax.\u201d \\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve informed Darya Ganj Police Station. By the time they beat the traffic to reach here, we will not only complete the proofreading but will also complete the suicide\u2026attempt.\u201d \\n3 proofreaders immediately started to decode the message in the letter in a separate document, another 3 changed the language settings of MS Word, and the rest started deleting the word \u2018why\u2019 which he had added at the end of every sentence. But it was too much of an ask for 10 mortals and they couldn\u2019t even rewrite half of the letter when police arrived at the scene. \\nKejriwal tried to cover up the whole mess and handed over the letter to the police inspector, saying, \u201cSee, what Modi has done to him! He was about to commit suicide.\u201d \\nThe inspector held the suicide note in front of him and mumbled, \u201cOh, Ashutosh. We would need some help here.\u201d \\nExperts, including the ones who decoded Nostradamus\u2019s predictions, were flown in from various parts of the world to decipher the message in the letter, however, they haven\u2019t quite succeeded in their endeavor as reports last came in.'"}, "time": 1742561792.3229883}
