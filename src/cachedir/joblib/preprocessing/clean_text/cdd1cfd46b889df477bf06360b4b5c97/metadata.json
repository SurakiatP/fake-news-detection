They were so flustered by the damning evidence, one of the liberal hosts even used the words \u201cDamn\u201d and \u201cYuck\u201d while describing the information as another said this could be the big story that ends it for Hillary. \\nFox News reports that among the new WikiLeaks release of John Podesta\u2019s emails was one containing an attachment to a twelve-page memo written in 2011 by Doug Band, a long-time aide to former President Bill Clinton. Within the text, Band talks about the \u201ccircle of enrichment\u201d which financially benefits the Clinton Foundation as well as the Clintons personally. Band used the contacts of his company, Teneo, to solicit donations to the Foundation from major corporations and to set up \u201cfor profit\u201d engagements for Bill Clinton. Band referred to the paid appearances as \u201cBill Clinton Inc.\u201d \\nWithin the memo, Doug Band described his role in helping to make the Clintons rich by leveraging their political influences. \u201c This memorandum strives to set forth how I have endeavored to support the Clinton Foundation and President Clinton personally ,\u201d Band wrote. \\nUnder a section titled \u201cFor-Profit Activity of President Clinton (i.e., Bill Clinton, Inc. ),\u201d Band wrote that he and Clinton aide Justin Cooper \u201cfound, developed and brought\u201d to Clinton all four of his advisory arrangements at the time \u2013 arrangements that \u201c yielded more than $30 million for him personally, with $66 million to be paid out over the next nine years should he choose to continue with the current engagements .\u201d The memo also included a footnote explaining how Clinton\u2019s speaking agent estimated that during a 10-year period, \u201c $20 million in speeches for the President have derived \u2026 from Justin and my efforts.\u201d [via FOX News ] \\nThis leaked memo consumed a large portion of Thursday\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on MSNBC , however, it\u2019s clear in the first two minutes of the five-minute clip below that the show\u2019s panel is shocked and flustered over the Clintons\u2019 dirty financial dealings that have been exposed. Mika Brzezinski even suggested that the only word that can be added to the discussion of the new scandal is \u201c Damn! \u201d \\nJoe Scarborough commented with some derision about how he views the Clintons\u2019 use of their political leverage and their \u201ccharitable\u201d Foundation as bait to fatten their own personal bank accounts. \u201c Maybe they\u2019re using the State Department, but using relief work in Haiti? \u2018Hey can you help those suffering in Haiti? It\u2019s really important. Thanks, listen, could you also give Bill Clinton $500,000 to give a speech? In your corporate luxury box?\u2019 \u201d At the end of Joe\u2019s impression of the unethical dealings, Mika added a disgusted, \u201c Yuck .\u201d \\nYuck, indeed. Also during the panel discussion, it was asked what the perception would be if a Bush had been engaged in this type of scandal. Incredibly, several of the participants, including Joe, admitted that the Bush family \u201cwould never do this.\u201d \\nFinally, the magnitude of the collective proof of the Clintons\u2019 unethical and illegal activities appear to have put seeds of doubt in the minds of some of their loyalists, but is it enough? Is it too late? Even though a few of the liberal news outlets have chosen to do the right thing, for once, in reporting on this \u201cBill Clinton Inc.\u201d scandal, it\u2019s unlikely it will last long in the spotlight of the national media. \\nIt\u2019s up to us, We the People , to make sure this kind of information reaches every corner of social media in the hopes that it will help to influence those voters who are still undecided. We only have ten days left to share the truth and make sure Hillary Clinton stays far away from our White House.'"}, "time": 1742562080.1232584}
