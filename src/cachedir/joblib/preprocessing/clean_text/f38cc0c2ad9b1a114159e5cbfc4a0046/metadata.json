Dear Watchers, Toss the confetti, pop the champagne, put on the nice sweatpants: We\u2019re in for a great TV week. New shows, returning favorites, a bird documentary  \u2014   heaven is a place on earth. And that place is within our televisions (and computers and tablets and whatnots). If you find yourself in need of some TV guidance, I\u2019d love to answer your questions, or settle your disputes. I am, as I ever was, and ever shall be: watching@nytimes. com. And a \u201c1776\u201d fan. Happy watching! Watch \u201cGomorrah,\u201d Wednesday, 10 p. m. SundanceTV. First came Roberto Saviano\u2019s 2007 nonfiction book about Neapolitan organized crime. Then came the 2009 movie. Now there\u2019s this   Italian 2014   airing weekly in   chunks. If you\u2019re looking for romantic, sweeping Italian vistas, try \u201cThe Wine Show. \u201d \u201cGomorrah\u201d is violent and bleak, almost suffocating. There are some familiar   beats here, but the cinematography alone is worth tuning in for. Watch \u201cHalt and Catch Fire,\u201d Season 3 premiere, Tuesday, 9 p. m. AMC.  The new season of this   drama transplants the show to Silicon Valley from Texas  \u2014   sort of a bummer, unless you are dying for another show about how people in California are just a little different from the rest of us. Thank god enough of the show\u2019s emotional core  \u2014   Donna, mostly  \u2014   is still intact. This   premiere highlights the strengths and shortcomings of \u201cHalt. \u201d (The first episode is available now on AMC.) \u201cMad Men\u201d is superficially about advertising, but more deeply it\u2019s about constructing identity. \u201cThe Americans\u201d includes tales of espionage, but foundationally is about defining truth. When it\u2019s its best, \u201cHalt\u201d is about the need for human bonds, and how that need will override all other behaviors. Too often, though, it\u2019s just about how computers and the internet worked (or didn\u2019t) in the \u201980s. Watch \u201cThe Profit,\u201d Tuesday, 10 p. m. CNBC (Previous episodes are on Hulu). The entrepreneur Marcus Lemonis travels the country and invests his own money in struggling small businesses, on the condition that he be \u201c100 percent in charge. \u201d If you like shows like \u201cTabatha\u2019s Salon Takeover\u201d or \u201cKitchen Nightmares,\u201d but wish they were more supportive and had better   messages, \u201cThe Profit\u201d is for you. Lemonis is calm and direct, and he doesn\u2019t yell at anyone or look to humiliate people anyone who comes across poorly does so on their own. This week\u2019s Season 4 premiere is another   venture (the show has included several such businesses) but more important, Lemonis seems to have retired his Herm\u00e8s belt. Watch \u201cDallas Cowboys Cheerleaders: Making the Team,\u201d Thursday, 9 p. m. CMT. Warning: The season premieres of \u201cDallas Cowboys Cheerleaders\u201d tend to be the worst episode of the season. The early auditions include too many aspiring cheerleaders who clearly have no chance of making the team, and too many randos weighing in. (Being married to a football player does not make you an expert in dancing.) But once the show   into gear, it\u2019s one of the most absorbing, brutal   reality shows going. The level of drive and athleticism on display is staggering, and if you\u2019ve ever wondered just how extrinsic one\u2019s image can be, this is the show for you. Everything is up for scrutiny: Are her eyes just too intense? Is that smile a little forced? Do her breasts seem natural enough? Hair: too severe? Every inch of the women\u2019s bodies is critiqued candidly and often, which can be galling, but it\u2019s almost refreshing to hear these narrow constraints articulated so openly. Watch \u201cToucan Nation,\u201d Wednesday, 10 p. m. Animal Planet. Warning: This doc contains very sad footage of an abused toucan. But Grecia survives! And inspires the nation of Costa Rica! Viva Grecia and his new beak. On Monday at 8 p. m. ESPN2 has \u201cPin Kings\u201d  \u2014   wrestling, not bowling, alas. It\u2019s the true story of high school wrestling teammates whose lives took different paths: One became a D. E. A. agent, one a cocaine kingpin. On Tuesday at 10 p. m. the tattoo contest show \u201cInk Master\u201d returns to SpikeTV. And Thursday at 8 p. m. on Logo, it\u2019s the premiere of the new season of \u201cRuPaul\u2019s All Stars Drag Race. \u201d Get swept up in the drama and passion of the dancers Mar\u00eda Nieves Rego and Juan Carlos Copes in the recent Argentine documentary \u201cOur Last Tango. \u201d Once a renowned couple from the Buenos Aires tango scene, the two split professionally after their marriage fell apart. Now the veteran dancers reflect on their life\u2019s work and tumultuous   relationship before a   reunion. \u201cOur Last Tango\u201d goes a step further than the standard memoir doc, creatively reinterpreting moments from Rego\u2019s childhood and her relationship with Copes into stylish modern and tango dance numbers. Between the couple\u2019s colorful anecdotes and impressive choreography, the movie makes it easy to get caught up in its bittersweet story.
