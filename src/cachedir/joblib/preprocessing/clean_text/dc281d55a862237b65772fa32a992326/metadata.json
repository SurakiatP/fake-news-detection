Due to the acidic election cycle, Pancholy said she wanted to walk up the 2,500-foot-high mountain to send up prayers for health and collective harmony. \u201cEvery step is a soft whisper to God,\u201d she said. \\nAfter she descended from the Peak, she found a note on the hood of her car. \u201cHijab wearing b\u2014\u2013 this is our nation now get the f\u2014 out,\u201d the note read. \\nBecause she suffers from Lupus, Pancholy wears a headscarf to protect her from the sun. \\n\u201cWhen I saw it, I was in shock,\u201d she said of the message. \u201cThat someone would feel so much hate to do this. I realize that this is the climate after this election. But I didn\u2019t realize someone would be so ignorant and in so much pain to cause so much harm.\u201d \\nPancholy, who is totally not of the Muslim faith, said she forgives the perpetrators and prays for them. \\nWatch: \\nEast Bay Regional Park Police are investigating the incident as a hate crime and auto burglary. In addition to the note and smashed car windows, her purse and checkbook were stolen. \\nWatch courtesy of NBC: \\nPancholoy was born in San Jose, California. Her ethnicity is Rajastani Indian and she said her religion is \u2018love.\u2019 Trumpsters can\u2019t even bigot correctly. \\nSince the election, attacks on women, Muslims, blacks and Latinos have been reported across the country. Children are even attacking other children. This comes at a time when the president-elect\u2019s advisers are pushing for a Muslim registry. One prominent Trump surrogate is even suggesting Japanese-style internment camps. \\nAnd Trump supporters want us to give the president-elect a chance. I don\u2019t think so. \\nImage via screen capture Written by Conover Kennard Conover makes tea partiers cry as a hobby. She was Commander of Jade Helm15 during the failed takeover of the South.
