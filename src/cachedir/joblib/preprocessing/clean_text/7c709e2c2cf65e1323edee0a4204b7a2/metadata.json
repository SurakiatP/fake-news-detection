The rulers of this new society will be the people who effectively control the means of production.\u201d\\n\u201cThe real question,\u201d Orwell adds, \u201cis not whether the people who wipe their boots on us during the next fifty years are to be called managers, bureaucrats, or politicians: the question is whether capitalism, now obviously doomed, is to give way to oligarchy or to true democracy.\u201d\\nWhile Orwell was wary of Burnham\u2019s worldview and of his more specific predictions, he agreed that the relationship between capitalism and democracy has always been, and always will be, a precarious one.\\n\u201cFor quite fifty years past,\u201d Orwell noted, \u201cthe general drift has almost certainly been towards oligarchy.\u201d\\nPointing to the concentration of political and economic power in the hands of the few and acknowledging \u201cthe weakness of the proletariat against the centralised state,\u201d Orwell was far from optimistic about the future \u2014 but he was quite certain that the economic status quo would eventually give way.\\nRecent events, and the material circumstances of much of the world\u2019s population, have prompted serious examinations of the same questions Orwell was considering seven decades ago. And though it appears as if rumors of capitalism\u2019s imminent demise have been greatly exaggerated, there is good reason to believe that its remarkable ability to adapt and evolve in the face of frequent (self-induced) shocks has reached a breaking point.\\nWidespread discontent over stagnant incomes and the uneven prosperity brought about by neoliberal globalization has, in 2016, come to a head in striking fashion; Donald Trump, Brexit, and the rise of far-right parties in Europe have many questioning previously sacred assumptions.\\n\u201cIs the marriage between liberal democracy and global capitalism an enduring one?\u201d asked Martin Wolf, a formidable commentator in one of the world\u2019s leading business papers, the Financial Times .\\nThis was no rhetorical softball; Wolf is genuinely concerned that the winners of globalization have grown complacent, that they have \u201ctaken for granted\u201d a couple that was only tenuously compatible to begin with. He also worries, rightly, that they have downplayed the concerns of the \u201closers.\u201d\\nWolf concludes that \u201cif the legitimacy of our democratic political systems is to be maintained, economic policy must be orientated towards promoting the interests of the many not the few; in the first place would be the citizenry, to whom the politicians are accountable.\u201d\\nNot all members of the commentariat share Wolf\u2019s willingness to engage with these cherished assumptions, however. Indeed, many analysts have reserved their ire not for failing institutions or policies but for the public, reviving Walter Lippmann\u2019s characterization of the masses as a \u201cbewildered herd\u201d that, if left to its own devices, is sure to usher in a regime of chaos.\\n\u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d declared Foreign Policy \u2018s James Traub, channeling the sentiments of Josh Barro, \u201cfor the elites to rise up against the ignorant masses.\u201d\\nApologists like Traub and Barro \u2014 just two among many \u2014 speak and write as if the leash previously restraining the \u201cherd\u201d has been loosened, and that the resulting freedom has laid bare what elitists have long believed to be the case: To use Barro\u2019s infamous words , \u201cElites are usually elite for good reason, and tend to have better judgment than the average person.\u201d They point to the rise of Donald Trump as evidence of an intolerable democratic surplus \u2014 evidence, in short, of what the masses will do if granted a loud enough voice.\\nAside from being conveniently self-serving, this narrative is also false.\\nFar from loosening the leash, elites have consolidated power to an unprecedented extent , and they have used their influence to undercut democratic movements and hijack public institutions. The resulting concentration of wealth and political power is jarring, and it puts the lie to the farcical notion that elites are a persecuted minority.\\nBut, in the midst of these anti-democratic diatribes, fascinating and important critiques of a rather different nature have emerged.\\n\u201cFar from loosening the leash, elites have consolidated power to an unprecedented extent , and they have used their influence to undercut democratic movements and hijack public institutions.\u201d\\nInstead of urging us to align Against Democracy , to use the name of a recent book by the libertarian political philosopher Jason Brennan, many are arguing that it is capitalism, and not the excesses of the democratic process, that has provided figures like Trump a launching pad.\\nIn his book Postcapitalism , Paul Mason argues that the rapid emergence of information technology has corroded the boundaries of the market; \u201ccapitalism,\u201d he insists, \u201chas reached the limits of its capacity to adapt.\u201d And its attempts to reach beyond these limits have fostered an economic environment defined by instability, crippling austerity for the many, and rapid accumulation of wealth for the few.\\nAccording to Oxfam, the global 1 percent now owns as much wealth as the bottom 99 percent. CEO pay has continued to soar. And though post-crisis reforms have carried soaring promises of stability, the financial sector is still far too large , and many of the banks harmed by the crash they created are back and nearly as powerful as ever .'"}, "time": 1742562433.8107238}
