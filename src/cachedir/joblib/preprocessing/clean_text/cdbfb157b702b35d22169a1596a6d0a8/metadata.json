Filmed during the first Gulf War, it shows CNN \"journalists\" Charles Jaco and his crew pretending to be giving a \"breaking news\" update on the fighting. The only problem is that the outtakes clearly show they are not on the front lines but in a poorly decorated television studio. CNN presented this as real-life, happening now news. Completely fake.   23, 2016 In short , the current news that there should be a campaign against \u2018fake news\u2019 is of itself a fake news story. \\nThe progressive Left , spearheaded by the liberal media and Barack Obama, want you to be outraged over the current level of \u2018fake news\u2019 that is disseminating across the globe. What they mean when they say this is that they want satire sites, like The Onion , to be shut down. They attempt to make the laughable claim that satire sites \u201c changed the course of the presidential election .\u201d But in point of fact, people are no more fooled by these sites than they are by \u2018fake news\u2019 broadcasting like SNL\u2019s Weekend Update and The Daily Show . Sites like these fill the gap that magazines like MAD and National Lampoon did years ago. And while a random sampling of low information Americans may be fooled by these satire sites, the vast majority of intelligent, everyday people are not. \\nIn short , the current news that there should be a campaign against \u2018fake news\u2019 is of itself a fake news story. But this is how they distract you, much like the streetcorner magician who has you looking off in one direction while he gins up his trick in the other. \\nSo let\u2019s take a look at a few times where the media and our government has deceived us with \u2018fake news\u2019 masquerading as an actual story. CNN Classic \u2018Fake News\u2019 Broadcast Pretending To Be On The Front Lines But Was Actually In TV Studio: \\nOur lead-off fake news story is a classic. Filmed during the first Gulf War, it shows CNN \u201cjournalists\u201d Charles Jaco and his crew pretending to be giving a \u201cbreaking news\u201d update on the fighting. The only problem is that the outtakes clearly show they are not on the front lines but in a poorly decorated television studio. CNN presented this as real-life, happening now news. Completely fake. The assassination of JFK and the \u2018fake news\u2019 of the Warren Report commission: \\nIn 2016, there is so much information online regarding the Kennedy killing that no one seriously believes that Lee Harvey Oswald shot him or ever fired a shot at all. But J. Edgar Hoover insisted that Oswald take the fall , and the \u2018fake news\u2019 Warren Commission was hatched to advance that narrative 36 Times Obama Said You Could Keep Your Health Care Plan \u2018Fake News\u2019 Scam: \\nOne of the greatest \u2018fake news\u2019 scams of the modern era is hoaxer-in-chief Obama saying that \u201c if you like your plan, you can keep your plan \u201c. Not only did this turn out not to be true \u2013 but \u2013 Obama was fully aware he was lying each and every time he said it. Not only that, every single media outlet in America repeated the lie, knowing it was a lie. George Bush selling the \u2018fake news\u2019 lie that Saddam Hussein had \u2018weapons of mass destruction\u2019: \\nHoo-boy, this was quite the \u2018fake news\u2019 whopper. Exactly what you would expect from the Bush Crime Family . Who helped Bush to sell this \u2018fake news\u2019 to the American public? Our old frenemies at the main stream media. How many US soldiers died as a result of this \u2018fake news\u2019 story? Right around 5,000 men and women were sacrificed for this. How our government and media use crisis actors to drive a narrative at staged horrific events: \\nOf all the \u2018fake news\u2019 stories out there , this is one of the toughest to talk about. No, we are not saying that people didn\u2019t actually die at places like Sandy Hook and other places, because they did. But that does not mean that the event that killed them was not a staged event involving paid crisis actors. So for this one we are going you a couple of videos to consider. FBI\u2019s own statistics reveal that no one died in the Sandy Hook shooting: \\nBefore you go and accuse us of being \u201cinsensitive\u201d to tragedy, take a look and see the official number of deaths in Newtown, CT, in 2012. Why are the \u201c27 victims\u201d of the Sandy Hook shooting not on the FBI list? Hmm\u2026looks like the FBI agrees with us.

Its brought to you by our own government, and by the crooked and corrupt pretend news media who spend 24 hours per day broadcasting stories that are various degrees of falsehood. \\nAnd what they are so upset about this year is that because of WikiLeaks , they were unable to use their \u2018fake news\u2019 to elect Hillary Clinton as president. The American people rejected their nonsense and journalistic lies, and they were left swinging in the breeze. \\nAs Kramer said so many years ago \u201c the only true news is the alternative media \u201c.
