New Jersey Senator Cory Booker doesn\u2019t care about her recording \u201crule\u201d as he caught her in the act with his cell phone camera. Now that the alarming video is out, so is her nasty secret. \\nIt\u2019s safe to say that Hillary is dealing with a lot of stress as the campaign she thought she had sufficiently rigged in her favor slips out of her grasp, now that she\u2019s under FBI investigation. It\u2019s becoming harder for her to hide who she really is, despite having done a pretty good job of it up until this campaign, but now we know how she deals with her many challenges after what Booker recorded her doing right before a campaign rally. \\nThe Democratic candidate was in New Jersey on June 1 for one of her few campaign stops at the time and seemed to have some \u201chelp\u201d with getting through the challenges of her day. After getting out of her black van, she walked right up to the Senator who she could probably see was recording, acting as if she had not a care in the world as she sang and awkwardly danced for the camera looking rather drunk, despite it being the early afternoon.

That\u2019s unacceptable behavior for anyone, but especially someone who is trying to be the leader of the free world. America doesn\u2019t need a drunk president.'"}, "time": 1742563248.217067}
