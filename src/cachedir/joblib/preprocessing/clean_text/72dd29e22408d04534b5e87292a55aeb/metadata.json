Now sit down, take a deep breath and really savor that Christmas cookie. TRY this: place a forkful of food in your mouth. It doesn\u2019t matter what the food is, but make it something you love  \u2014   let\u2019s say it\u2019s that first nibble from three hot, fragrant, perfectly cooked ravioli. Now comes the hard part. Put the fork down. This could be a lot more challenging than you imagine, because that first bite was very good and another immediately beckons. You\u2019re hungry. Today\u2019s experiment in eating, however, involves becoming aware of that reflexive urge to plow through your meal like Cookie Monster on a shortbread bender. Resist it. Leave the fork on the table. Chew slowly. Stop talking. Tune in to the texture of the pasta, the flavor of the cheese, the bright color of the sauce in the bowl, the aroma of the rising steam. Continue this way throughout the course of a meal, and you\u2019ll experience the    pleasures and frustrations of a practice known as mindful eating. The concept has roots in Buddhist teachings. Just as there are forms of meditation that involve sitting, breathing, standing and walking, many Buddhist teachers encourage their students to meditate with food, expanding consciousness by paying close attention to the sensation and purpose of each morsel. In one common exercise, a student is given three raisins, or a tangerine, to spend 10 or 20 minutes gazing at, musing on, holding and patiently masticating. Lately, though, such experiments of the mouth and mind have begun to seep into a secular arena, from the Harvard School of Public Health to the California campus of Google. In the eyes of some experts, what seems like the simplest of acts  \u2014   eating slowly and genuinely relishing each bite  \u2014   could be the remedy for a   Paula Deen Nation in which an endless parade of new diets never seems to slow a stampede toward obesity. Mindful eating is not a diet, or about giving up anything at all. It\u2019s about experiencing food more intensely  \u2014   especially the pleasure of it. You can eat a cheeseburger mindfully, if you wish. You might enjoy it a lot more. Or you might decide, halfway through, that your body has had enough. Or that it really needs some salad. \u201cThis is \u201d said Dr. Jan Chozen Bays, a pediatrician and meditation teacher in Oregon and the author of \u201cMindful Eating: A Guide to Rediscovering a Healthy and Joyful Relationship with Food. \u201d \u201cI think the fundamental problem is that we go unconscious when we eat. \u201d The last few years have brought a spate of books, blogs and videos about   eating. A Harvard nutritionist, Dr. Lilian Cheung, has devoted herself to studying its benefits, and is passionately encouraging corporations and health care providers to try it. At the Food and Brand Lab at Cornell University, Prof. Brian Wansink, the author of \u201cMindless Eating: Why We Eat More Than We Think,\u201d has conducted scores of experiments on the psychological factors that lead to our bottomless bingeing. A mindful lunch hour recently became part of the schedule at Google, and   gurus like Oprah Winfrey and Kathy Freston have become cheerleaders for the practice. With the annual   of Thanksgiving, Christmas and Super Bowl Sunday behind us, and Lent coming, it\u2019s worth pondering whether mindful eating is something that the mainstream ought to be, well, more mindful of. Could a discipline pioneered by Buddhist monks and nuns help teach us how to get healthy, relieve stress and shed many of the neuroses that we\u2019ve come to associate with food? Dr. Cheung is convinced that it can. Last week, she met with team members at Harvard Pilgrim Health Care and asked them to spend quality time with a   almond. \u201cThe rhythm of life is becoming faster and faster, so we really don\u2019t have the same awareness and the same ability to check into ourselves,\u201d said Dr. Cheung, who, with the Vietnamese Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh,   \u201cSavor: Mindful Eating, Mindful Life. \u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why mindful eating is becoming more important. We need to be coming back to ourselves and saying: \u2018Does my body need this? Why am I eating this? Is it just because I\u2019m so sad and stressed out?\u2019 \u201d The topic has even found its way into culinary circles that tend to be more focused on Rabelaisian excess than monastic restraint. In January, Dr. Michael Finkelstein, a holistic physician who oversees SunRaven, a   center in Bedford, N. Y. gave a talk about mindful gardening and eating at the   headquarters of the James Beard Foundation in New York City. \u201cThe question isn\u2019t what are the foods to eat, in my mind,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cMost people have a general sense of what the healthy foods are, but they\u2019re not eating them. What\u2019s on your mind when you\u2019re eating: that\u2019s mindful eating to me. \u201d A good place to try it is the Blue Cliff Monastery, in Pine Bush, N. Y. a Hudson Valley hamlet. At the serene refuge about 75 miles northwest of Manhattan, curious lay people can join Buddhist brothers and sisters for a free \u201cday of mindfulness\u201d twice a week. At a gathering in January, visitors watched a videotaped lecture by Thich Nhat Hanh (pronounced   ) who founded this and other monasteries around the world they strolled methodically around the grounds as part of a walking meditation, then filed into a dining room for lunch. No one spoke, in keeping with a key principle of mindful eating. The point is simply to eat, as opposed to eating and talking, eating and watching TV, or eating and watching TV and gossiping on the phone while Tweeting and updating one\u2019s Facebook status. A long buffet table of food awaited, all of it vegan and mindfully prepared by two monks in the kitchen. There was plenty of rice, herbed chickpeas, a soup made with cubes of taro, a stew of fried tofu in tomato sauce. In silence, people piled their plates with food, added a squirt or two of condiments (eating mindfully doesn\u2019t mean forsaking the hot sauce) and sat down together with eyes closed during a Buddhist prayer for gratitude and moderation. What followed was captivating and mysterious. Surrounded by a murmur of clinking forks, spoons and chopsticks, the Blue Cliff congregation, or sangha, spent the lunch hour contemplating the enjoyment of spice, crunch, saltiness, warmth, tenderness and   company. Some were thinking, too, about the origins of the food: the thousands of farmers, truck drivers and laborers whose work had brought it here. As their jaws moved slowly, their faces took on expressions of deep focus. Every now and then came a pause within the pause: A chime would sound, and, according to the monastery\u2019s custom, all would stop moving and chewing in order to breathe and explore an even deeper level of sensory awareness. It looked peaceful, but inside some of those heads, a struggle was afoot. \u201cIt\u2019s much more challenging than we would imagine,\u201d said Carolyn Cronin, 64, who lives near the monastery and regularly attends the mindfulness days. \u201cPeople are used to eating so fast. This is a practice of stopping, and we don\u2019t realize how much we\u2019re not stopping. \u201d For many people, eating fast means eating more. Mindful eating is meant to nudge us beyond what we\u2019re craving so that we wake up to why we\u2019re craving it and what factors might be stoking the habit of  . \u201cAs we practice this regularly, we become aware that we don\u2019t need to eat as much,\u201d said Phap Khoi, 43, a robed monk who has been stationed at Blue Cliff since it opened in 2007. \u201cWhereas when people just gulp down food, they can eat a lot and not feel full. \u201d It\u2019s this byproduct of mindful eating  \u2014   its potential as a psychological barrier to overeating  \u2014   that has generated excitement among nutritionists like Dr. Cheung. \u201cThich Nhat Hanh often talks about our craving being like a crying baby who is trying to draw our attention,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen the baby cries, the mother cradles the baby to try to calm the baby right away. By acknowledging and embracing our cravings through a few breaths, we can stop our autopilot of reaching out to the pint of ice cream or the bag of chips. \u201d The average American doesn\u2019t have the luxury of ruminating on the intense tang of sriracha sauce at a monastery. \u201cMost of us are not going to be Buddhist monks,\u201d said Dr. Finkelstein, the holistic physician. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve learned is that it has to work at home. \u201d To that end, he and others suggest that people start with a few baby steps. \u201cDon\u2019t be too hard on yourself,\u201d Dr. Cheung said. \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to be able to switch on your mindfulness button and be able to do it 100 percent. It\u2019s a practice you keep working toward. \u201d Dr. Bays, the pediatrician, has recommendations that can sound like a return to the simple rhythms of Mayberry, if not \u201cLittle House on the Prairie. \u201d If it\u2019s impossible to eat mindfully every day, consider planning one special repast a week. Click off the TV. Sit at the table with loved ones. \u201cHow about the first five minutes we eat, we just eat in silence and really enjoy our food?\u201d she said. \u201cIt happens step by step. \u201d Sometimes, even she is too busy to contemplate a chickpea. So there are days when Dr. Bays will take three mindful sips of tea, \u201cand then, O. K. I\u2019ve got to go do my work,\u201d she said. \u201cAnybody can do that. Anywhere. \u201d Even scarfing down a burrito in the car offers an opportunity for insight. \u201cMindful eating includes mindless eating,\u201d she said. \u201c \u2018I am aware that I am eating and driving.\u2019 \u201d Few places in America are as frantically abuzz with activity as the Google headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. but when Thich Nhat Hanh dropped by for a day of mindfulness in September, hundreds of employees showed up. Part of the event was devoted to eating thoughtfully in silence, and the practice was so well received that an hourlong wordless vegan lunch is now a monthly observance on the Google campus. \u201cInterestingly enough, a lot of the participants are the engineers, which pleases us very much,\u201d said Olivia Wu, an executive chef at the company. \u201cI think it quiets the mind. I think there is a real sense of feeling restored so that they can go back to the crazy pace that they came from. \u201d It\u2019s not often, after all, that those workhorse technicians get to stop and smell the pesto. \u201cSomebody will say, \u2018I ate so much less,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Wu said. \u201cAnd someone else will say, \u2018You know, I never noticed how spicy arugula tastes.\u2019 \u201d And that could be the ingredient that helps mindful eating gain traction in mainstream American culture: flavor. \u201cSo many people now have found themselves in an adversarial relationship with food, which is very tragic,\u201d Dr. Bays said. \u201cEating should be a pleasurable activity. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561629.1895158}
