{"duration": 0.17445921897888184, "input_args": {"text": "'At last week\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple\u2019s annual showcase of new tech, the company announced a special texting feature coming soon to iPhones near you. \u201cYou know, sometimes you\u2019ve typed a whole message and you realize at the end that you\u2019re entirely lacking in emojification,\u201d said Craig Federighi, Apple\u2019s senior vice president for software engineering. \u201cSo we provided the solution: When you tap on the emoji button, we\u2019ll highlight all the emojifiable words there, and you can just tap, tap, tap, tap and emojify. \u201d On a screen behind Mr. Federighi, a simulated message underwent the process: The word \u201cbasketball\u201d transformed into a little black and orange cartoon image of the ball itself. \u201cPizza\u201d flipped into a glistening pepperoni slice. \u201cMovie\u201d turned into an   film camera. A collective \u201cOoh\u201d wafted up from the technorati gathered in the crowd. \u201cChildren of tomorrow will have no understanding of the English language,\u201d Mr. Federighi said jokingly. But Apple\u2019s new emoji feature seems more likely to impede a different kind of skill: creating surprising, figurative and subversive forms of individual expression out of the digital ephemera that populate our devices. In a rush to harness the power of the web\u2019s most evocative cultural units  \u2014   emoji and their hyperactive cousins, GIFs  \u2014   tech companies, corporate brands and entrepreneurial social media stars could risk inadvertently flattening the creative world that\u2019s sprung up around them. \u201cThere is a constant push and pull between people finding new ways to express themselves online, and companies trying to make money off that expression,\u201d said Luke Stark, who studies digital communication and psychology. Emoji have emerged as cultural forces in and of themselves. The crisp,   glyphs form a modern emotional palette. And it\u2019s growing: On Tuesday, the Unicode Consortium, the body that standardizes emoji, will release 72 new ones that will soon make their way to our fingertips, including a black heart, a wilted flower and a pregnant woman. Emoji began as colorful icons loaded into Japanese pagers in the 1990s. When they first migrated to American devices several years ago, discovering emoji felt like opening a grab bag of Japanese curios: smiley faces, yes, but also a buffet of Japanese foods (a cut of sashimi, a fish cake, a bottle of sake) and a host of untranslatable images. But the emoji soon took on new meanings as they made their way to new countries and subcultures  \u2014   like the information desk person emoji (recast as a sassy retort) or the eggplant emoji (which usurped the banana to become the internet\u2019s favorite phallic symbol). In a group chat, adding emoji can feel like tacking up posters on the walls of a virtual clubhouse. A lively sequence can stoke flirtatious undertones or show off sparkling wit. One perfectly chosen emoji could suspend a mood in time, like an \u201980s movie that ends on an exultant freeze frame. If emoji encourage visual puns and whimsical juxtapositions, GIFs inspire a sharp curatorial sensibility. The art lies in detecting the richest slices of popular media  \u2014   film, TV or amateur video  \u2014   and punctuating their greatness by setting them on infinite repeat. The best \u201creaction\u201d GIFs  \u2014   those chosen to inject human expression in online conversation  \u2014   feel both emotionally familiar and visually surprising. But when emojis and GIFs are filtered through the interests of tech companies, they often become slickly automated. In addition to Apple\u2019s \u201cemojification\u201d feature, there is Twitter\u2019s new GIF keyboard (a partnership with the GIF company Giphy, which has been pumped with $78. 95 million worth of funding since 2013). It directs Twitter users to choose from a suite of emotional reactions, including \u201cAgree,\u201d \u201cApplause,\u201d \u201cAww\u201d and \u201cEww,\u201d which conjures a set of appropriate GIFs,   with those featuring the internet\u2019s most GIFable celebrities, like Beyonc\u00e9 and Oprah. Searching for a delicious bite of pop culture once took on the contours of a treasure hunt. A GIF keyboard feels like a shortcut: Click \u201cGIF,\u201d find an emotional state (\u201cAgree\u201d) then filter it through your cultural lens of choice (like Jerry Seinfeld saying \u201criiiiiight right right right right right. \u201d). Tap, tap, tap:  . It all feels simpatico with Facebook\u2019s new \u201creactions,\u201d released in February, which offer users a slim range of human experiences  \u2014   Anger, Sad, Wow, Haha and Love  \u2014   with which to react to news on their feed. Buying into these features means giving tech companies the power to shape our creative expressions in ways that further enrich the companies themselves. A limited emotional range helps collect data on users\u2019 states of mind. Twitter advertisers can now target users based on the emoji they tweet. The commodification of digital culture has engendered more explicit corporate branding, too. On Snapchat, where users embellish their selfies with emoji, crayon scribbles, and elaborate \u201clenses\u201d that cover their faces with virtual masks, marketers like McDonalds are seizing the opportunity to write their messages across people\u2019s faces. Even celebrities have tried to encode themselves. In December, Kim   released her latest pioneering app, Kimoji, which serves up an alternative emoji set (and a suite of GIFs) designed around her own image. It inspired a boomlet of celebrity emoji offerings, including Stephen Curry\u2019s StephMoji app, Amber Rose\u2019s MuvaMoji, Justin Bieber\u2019s Justmoji and the actor Ansel Elgort\u2019s Anselfie. Even Drake\u2019s dad has emoji now. With Kimoji, and its micro images of breasts and butts, Kim Kardashian isn\u2019t just sexy: She represents sex itself. But as more stars jump on the bandwagon, these apps begin to represent little more than a branding opportunity: Ansel Elgort sticking out his tongue Ansel Elgort pouting Ansel Elgort wearing headphones. Meanwhile, as traditional emoji expand beyond their Japanese roots, tech companies like Apple, Microsoft and Google (all are voting members of Unicode) have become responsible for making cultural, and sometimes political, choices in determining which new emoji will make the cut. Some additions to the emoji repertoire are informed by experts: Unicode has consulted the Cornell Lab of Ornithology for bird emoji advice. Others are culled from \u201cpopular requests from online communities\u201d and proposals submitted by the public. Companies have also made bids to influence the result, though Unicode says it rejects emojis \u201cstrongly associated with a particular brand. \u201d Last year, the ad agency Havas London started a campaign on behalf of Durex, calling for a condom emoji. Cerveza Indio wants a dark beer emoji. Ballantine\u2019s has championed a glass of whiskey. The rice company La Fallera suggested a paella emoji. (The whiskey and paella made the cut both are coming on Tuesday.) For the Olympics, Unicode recently considered encoding a rifle emoji alongside other   glyphs, but members voted it down. \u201cWhen vendors looked at it, they didn\u2019t see a lot of additional value in adding it,\u201d said Mark Davis, a Unicode spokesman. \u201cThere\u2019s already a firearm in Unicode. \u201d That decision has helped stoke concerns that modern visual language is being shaped by the political or financial priorities of gigantic tech companies. While many don\u2019t see the advantage of emojifying another gun, others wonder whether heightened scrutiny could lead to less idiosyncratic, less interesting characters. \u201cOne of the things that make emoji fun is this quirky weird list that came about through accidents of history,\u201d said Jeremy Burge, the founder of Emojipedia and a member of Unicode\u2019s emoji subcommittee. \u201cThe bomb, the cigarette, the dripping syringe  \u2014   it\u2019s crazy to think that all of those would make it in today. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563457.0715227}
