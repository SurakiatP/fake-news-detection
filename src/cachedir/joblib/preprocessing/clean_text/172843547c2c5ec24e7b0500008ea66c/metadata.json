Then he adds cymbals and kick drum, giving the phrase a sinuous curve just as the rest of the band enters. What they\u2019re playing is \u201cColtrane Time,\u201d an obscure piece by John Coltrane, and Mr. Cyrille shows the way forward with a regal, flowing  . He has been working this way more or less since the 1960s, reshaping jazz\u2019s rhythmic syntax while engaging with its lineage. A tireless workhorse in the   Mr. Cyrille, 76, deserves substantial credit for helping to unlock a freer pulse and purpose in the music, slipping away from a metronomic framework while preserving a rigorous attention to form. \u201cI used to spend time with older jazz drummers like Philly Joe Jones and Max Roach,\u201d Mr. Cyrille said in a recent interview from his home in Montclair, N. J. \u201cThey would always say, \u2018You\u2019ve got to make your contribution.\u2019 So that was always in my head. When you find yourself, you have to find your path. \u201d Mr. Cyrille\u2019s entire body of work suggests a fulfillment of that conviction, carried out with little concern for outside approval. He still hasn\u2019t been named a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master, the lifetime achievement honor bestowed on some of his former collaborators, like the pianists Cecil Taylor and Muhal Richard Abrams and the multireedist Anthony Braxton. But Mr. Cyrille has managed something just as meaningful, bringing his ideas into increasingly mainstream circulation without a hint of dilution. His work on fine recent albums by the pianist David Virelles and the bassist Eric Revis, and with the collective Trio 3, begin to make the case for a   renaissance. (Trio 3, with Oliver Lake on alto saxophone and Reggie Workman on bass, will be at Dizzy\u2019s Club   on Oct. 27.) Both \u201cThe Declaration of Musical Independence\u201d and \u201cProximity,\u201d a duo recording with the saxophonist Bill McHenry, bolster that impression, if not close the case entirely. A pair of albums with divergent sonic features but a similar ethos of discovery, they highlight Mr. Cyrille\u2019s insight, ingenuity and subtle mastery of touch. \u201cThere\u2019s so much clarity in his playing,\u201d said the guitarist Bill Frisell, who appears on \u201cThe Declaration of Musical Independence\u201d alongside Richard Teitelbaum on synthesizers and piano and Ben Street on bass. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t swallow you up. And he strikes this perfect balance between instigating something and also responding to what\u2019s going on around him. That\u2019s the most amazing feeling in music, and Andrew\u2019s got that really strong. \u201d Mr. Cyrille is a gregarious conversationalist, quick to illustrate any point. Born in Brooklyn to Haitian immigrants, he recalls being a small child and accompanying his mother to community meetings, where the great hand drummer Alphonse Cimber would often be playing. He honed his skills in almost every conceivable setting, from high school orchestra to Brooklyn jazz bars. He studied at Juilliard even while holding a gig with the Nigerian drummer Babatunde Olatunji. By the   when he started working with Cecil Taylor, he had a wealth of experience to draw from. \u201cI had been playing dances and parties, bar mitzvahs and polkas,\u201d he said. \u201cI had been in the drum and bugle corps. \u201d Mr. Cyrille had also provided musical accompaniment for classes associated with the June Taylor Dancers, improvising rhythmic cues for kinetic movement. \u201cThat\u2019s, in a sense, how I learned to solo,\u201d he said. \u201cSo when I got with Cecil, I was able to do all of that stuff. One time he asked me, \u2018How do you hear rhythm?\u2019 I said, \u2018I hear it in relationship to dance. \u2019\u201d During a more than   tenure with Mr. Taylor, who set a high bar for free improvisation, Mr. Cyrille refined new rhythmic strategies. His freedom of expression on the job was absolute, so it was up to him to establish a style that, in his words, \u201cwas concrete, and in acknowledgment of people like Kenny Clarke, Philly Joe Jones, Art Blakey and Max Roach. \u201d Mr. Cyrille also prioritized a kinship with his fellow   drummers. He learned \u201cColtrane Time\u201d from Rashied Ali, Coltrane\u2019s last drummer, who passed it along like a family heirloom. In 1974, Mr. Cyrille released the album \u201cDialogue of the Drums,\u201d a collaboration with Milford Graves. \u201cPieces of Time,\u201d released a decade later, features Mr. Cyrille and Mr. Graves alongside Mr. Clarke, a bebop progenitor, and Famoudou Don Moye, of the Art Ensemble of Chicago. One track from \u201cPieces of Time\u201d  \u2014   the jaunty \u201cDrum Song for Leadbelly,\u201d inspired by one of that bluesman\u2019s old recordings  \u2014   resurfaces on Mr. Cyrille\u2019s new album with Mr. McHenry. \u201cProximity\u201d otherwise features a balance of simmering idylls and   sparring sessions, with drums and saxophone always mutually engaged. The album is lean and dry but hardly austere: It feels dynamic and fully realized, a product of intense   exchange. \u201cThe Declaration of Musical Independence\u201d has a more ethereal footprint, partly because of the instrumentation: Mr. Frisell is a guitarist who can evoke the flicker of sunlight and shadow, and Mr. Teitelbaum favors the abstraction of sculptural sound. At Mr. Cyrille\u2019s behest, every musician on the album contributed a new tune, and they created a few others on the spot. \u201cBegin,\u201d by Mr. Frisell, is a brief dose of swinging mischief \u201cSay,\u201d by Mr. Street, is a gorgeous, watery ballad. The composition that Mr. Cyrille brought in was \u201cDazzling (Perchordially Yours),\u201d a process piece in which each musician elaborated on an assigned set of chords, finding common purpose through trial and error. Playing the tune with brushes, Mr. Cyrille sketches a tempo with clear forward motion but no strict cadence. \u201cOne can define time as \u2018the duration of that which changes,\u2019\u201d he said, briefly letting the phrase sink in. \u201cWe think of time as something like     or a clock that goes \u2018ticktock, ticktock.\u2019 But people who lived before clocks, they would look at the sun or the moon, see when the rooster started crowing. That meant \u2018time\u2019 for them. So it would change. \u201d He went on, \u201cHow you deal with it, from one moment to the next, depends on the culture that you come from. \u201d Then he laughed, but in a way that made it clear he was serious. Cecil Taylor, \u2018Unit Structures\u2019 (Blue Note, 1966) This album, deservedly a   landmark, presents Mr. Cyrille as the ideal improvisational partner, meeting every swarm and surge in Mr. Taylor\u2019s pianism with his own rumbling poise. Leroy Jenkins, \u201cSpace Minds, New Worlds, Survival of America\u201d (Tomato, 1978) The violinist Leroy Jenkins made this album in a contemporary classical vein, with Mr. Teitelbaum on synthesizer, George Lewis on electronics and Mr. Cyrille in alert and supple form. Andrew Cyrille  Maono, \u201cMetamusicians\u2019 Stomp\u201d (Black Saint, 1978) Mr. Cyrille featured several of his compositions on this earthy and exploratory album, featuring a captivating young tenor saxophonist, David S. Ware, alongside the slashing trumpeter Ted Daniel. Milford Graves, Andrew Cyrille, Kenny Clarke, Famoudou Don Moye,  \u201cPieces of Time\u201d (Soul Note, 1984) An intergenerational drummer\u2019s summit featuring compositions by all four members (Mr. Cyrille has two) and a spirit of selfless camaraderie. Trio 3 + Vijay Iyer, \u201cWiring\u201d (Intakt, 2014) The powerfully insightful collective Trio 3  \u2014   Oliver Lake on alto saxophone, Mr. Workman on bass, Mr. Cyrille on drums  \u2014   has made several fine recent albums with guest pianists. This one, featuring Mr. Iyer, is a knockout.'"}, "time": 1742563972.803893}
