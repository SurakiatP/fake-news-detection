Code Evid. 511, and the priest is exempt from mandatory reporter status in such circumstances by operation of La. Child. Code art. 603, because \u201cunder the \u2026 tenets of the [Roman Catholic] church\u201d he has an inviolable \u201cduty to keep such communications confidential.\u201d \\nThe case which originally brought this issue before the court was that of a young woman who told a Baton Rouge-area Catholic priest that a longtime parishioner had sexually assaulted her when she was 14-years-old. The priest in turn did not report the abuse. \\nTell us what you think of this controversial ruling in the comments section.'"}, "time": 1742628350.447689}
