{"duration": 0.6441164016723633, "input_args": {"text": "'Every week or so during the spring, I met with Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the party headquarters on Capitol Hill. We fell into a familiar routine. I would enter his office, usually chaperoned by Sean Spicer, the R. N. C. \u2019s chief strategist and head of communications. Priebus has a healthy appreciation for gallows humor, which is not a bad thing for an R. N. C. chairman these days. \u201cI haven\u2019t started pouring Baileys in my cereal yet,\u201d he says often enough that it has become a signature line. I would regularly break the ice with something sarcastic, like asking Priebus how his party\u2019s Hispanic outreach program was going on the morning after the committee\u2019s head of Hispanic outreach resigned rather than work another day for Donald Trump\u2019s election. \u201cThe scent of party unity is in the air,\u201d I said in May when Paul Ryan reported that he was \u201cnot there yet\u201d on supporting Trump. \u201cNo, that\u2019s incense,\u201d Priebus said, pointing out that he had been burning some behind his desk. As suits a man occupying what might be the toughest political job in America, Priebus does his best to stay availed of serene distractions. He plays jazz piano at home late at night and gazes into the   saltwater fish tank that he keeps next to his desk. \u201cYou see that big eel?\u201d Priebus asked one day, pointing out a black slithery creature on the bottom, before noting others. \u201cThat\u2019s a yellow tang, hippo tang, a spotted puffer. There\u2019s an anemone. An urchin. An orange clown fish. \u201d He took a hunk of shrimp from a refrigerator and dangled it with a set of tongs into the water. A race to the bottom ensued as bits fell away and the fish vied for pieces of flesh. It was difficult to look away from the feeding frenzy. The big orange clown fish flailed at front and center. I asked Priebus if it reminded him of anyone. \u201cThat\u2019s not funny,\u201d he said with something between a slight grunt and chuckle. No matter how much Trump has roiled the Republican water, it remained Priebus\u2019s job to carry it. The presumed Republican nominee appears on many days to be at open war with the party that is about to nominate him. The entire campaign, meanwhile, has been a proxy battle for the proverbial \u201csoul of the party\u201d that has been escalating between the G. O. P. \u2019s populist grass roots (captured by Trump) and \u201cparty leaders\u201d (embodied by Priebus, the House speaker, Paul Ryan, and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell). Is the G. O. P. now the \u201cparty of Trump\u201d? Priebus bristles when people ask him this  \u2014   or taunt him. I asked Priebus some variation on this question during each of my visits. \u201cDonald Trump is Donald Trump,\u201d Priebus says. \u201cAnd the party is the party. \u201d \u201cPriebus\u201d is a German name, pronounced like the Toyota Prius with a \u201cb\u201d stuck in the middle. Reince (short for Reinhold, rhymes with \u201cpints\u201d) is 44 but has an  \u2019s vibe. He is often underslept, has the beginnings of jowls and tiny goose pimples clustered under his eyes like those on the belly of a toad. He speaks in the slow and slightly   manner of an adolescent whose parents are always hassling him about the nightmare house guest. The Trump issue, in other words. It\u2019s never far from anything, and really, these days, what else is there? Plenty, Priebus kept trying to convince me. The Republican Party had its own distinct identity and principles and points of pride. It controls both chambers of Congress and holds more federal and statewide seats than at any time since 1900, he said. What keeps eluding Republicans is the White House. They have lost the popular vote in five of the last six national elections. \u201cCultural elections,\u201d Priebus calls them  \u2014   \u201cthe big ones. \u201d A chief reason for this is that many voters dismiss Republicans as being culturally and demographically stuck in 1900. It was Priebus who commissioned and endorsed the findings of the G. O. P. \u201cautopsy\u201d after Mitt Romney\u2019s defeat in 2012. Formally christened as the \u201cGrowth and Opportunity Project,\u201d the report warned that the G. O. P. was \u201cincreasingly marginalizing itself\u201d to a point where it would be \u201cincreasingly difficult for Republicans to win another presidential election in the near future. \u201d That is, the report concluded, unless the party expanded its aging white base to include more immigrants, ethnic minorities and women, precisely the groups the next likely   has so splendidly repelled. Priebus refers to himself as a \u201cparty guy. \u201d He spent much of his youth in Kenosha, Wis. organizing pizza parties for Republican volunteers, putting up yard signs and listening to Newt Gingrich speeches on cassettes in his car  \u2014     things. His first date with his future wife included a trip to a Republican Lincoln Day dinner, an evening sexed up by the presence of two Republican congressmen: James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin and Henry Hyde of Illinois. Being a \u201cparty guy\u201d can come off sounding a little   nerdy, like being a   guy. But Priebus speaks of this identity with sincere pride, and his allegiance is clear: to \u201cthe party,\u201d not any one nominee. Still, our meetings sometimes took on the feel of therapy sessions, with Priebus playing the role of the betrayed spouse trying to convince me that his tormentor really could change. Trump would soon be \u201cpivoting\u201d into a more \u201cpresidential\u201d mode, Priebus kept promising. But after a while it became clear that Trump\u2019s outrages would continue unabated. Within the space of a few weeks, he suggested that Bill Clinton had committed rape and (along with Hillary) might have killed his former aide Vince Foster and that Ted Cruz\u2019s father might have associated with Lee Harvey Oswald and that Mitt Romney walked like a penguin and. . .. Priebus pretty much stopped bothering with \u201cpresidential. \u201d On this particular day, cable news was    with stories: the surfacing of an audio tape of someone sounding a lot like Trump claiming to be a Trump \u201cspokesman\u201d the discovery of a Facebook post from Trump\u2019s longtime butler calling for President Obama to be killed and news that the Trump campaign had selected a white nationalist leader to be a California delegate (the delegate wound up resigning). Priebus eventually pivoted to Trump\u2019s supposed \u201cauthenticity. \u201d Yes, \u201cauthenticity\u201d was a better word, more latitude. He settled on the idea that Trump was a \u201cunique\u201d candidate who had created a new standard for what a politician could say and get away with. \u201cHe\u2019s carved out this idea that he\u2019s this earthquake in a box,\u201d Priebus says. Priebus was saying in effect that it would be possible to build a wall around Donald Trump and not have the G. O. P. pay for it. Trump did not define its values in the long term, even if he might temporarily defile them. \u201cWe\u2019re the party of the \u2018open door,\u2019\u2019u2009\u201d Priebus told me, as he often does. Not big, beautiful walls. For a while this spring, it seemed possible to contain the earthquake. Trump showed flickering signs of \u201cmaturing\u201d as a candidate, and Republicans seemed willing to \u201csupport the nominee,\u201d if not endorse him. The \u201cnormalization\u201d of Donald Trump became a media watchword, the idea that his daily affronts could be integrated into the routine paces of a quadrennial exercise. Formerly hostile primary opponents like Marco Rubio, Lindsey Graham, Bobby Jindal and Rick Perry all at various points said they would support Trump or were at least no longer (in Rubio\u2019s case) deriding him as a \u201cfraud,\u201d \u201ccon man\u201d and \u201clunatic\u201d or (in Graham\u2019s) a \u201c  xenophobic, religious bigot\u201d or (in Jindal\u2019s) a \u201cmadman who must be stopped\u201d or (in Perry\u2019s) a \u201cbarking carnival act. \u201d I imagined Trump laughing at how easy it was to get Republicans to submit to him after he had savaged so many of them during the primaries. Actually there was no need to imagine because Trump was doing exactly that. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen people able to pivot like politicians,\u201d he said at a rally in California in late May while boasting of his support from Perry. In an interview, I asked Trump if it was harder to flip politicians or the real estate people he has dealt with over the years. His smirk was audible over the phone. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not referring to any politicians in particular, but I\u2019ve said many times that businesspeople are much tougher,\u201d Trump said. \u201cPoliticians tend to be much more deceptive and deceiving and more willing to break a deal. But they are not as tough. \u201d Priebus, meanwhile, kept working the phones, trying to coax   Republicans back to the party line and persuade  \u2014   beg  \u2014   Trump to lay off the elected Republicans he kept dumping on. \u201cI have encouraged him to constantly offer grace to people that he doesn\u2019t think are deserving of grace,\u201d Priebus said. Trump, in turn, calls Priebus \u201cMr. Switzerland\u201d and speaks well of him. \u201cReince is a peacemaker, a very good person for getting people together,\u201d he said. Trump was calling me from his limo after a rally in Anaheim, Calif. He was in the midst of an intrapartisan grudge tour of the American West, during which he disparaged, among other Republicans, Jeb Bush, the South Carolina governor, Nikki Haley, and the New Mexico governor, Susana Martinez, who is one of the   Hispanic elected officials in the G. O. P. He also reiterated that Romney was a \u201closer\u201d and a \u201cchoker\u201d and for good measure boasted that \u201cI have a store that\u2019s worth more money than he is. \u201d Priebus\u2019s mother is Greek, which he says trains him for dealing with whatever the Greek word for mishegas is. \u201cEver see \u2018My Big Fat Greek Wedding\u2019?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat\u2019s my family, that\u2019s my life. The arguing starts at 7:30 in the morning, everyone\u2019s in each other\u2019s business. It was good family chaos. \u201d I asked if what the G. O. P. was going through now was \u201cgood family chaos. \u201d \u201cIt depends how it turns out,\u201d he said. At this point in the    calendar four and eight years ago, Romney and John McCain had built massive campaign operations and   networks that were orders of magnitude larger than Trump\u2019s. They had accumulated armies of elected officials promoting them and were diligently making peace with vanquished opponents and paying courtesy calls to party dignitaries and congressional leaders in the name of \u201cunity. \u201d The period between the end of the primaries and the start of the conventions is typically one of consolidation,   harvesting and turning full attention to the   opponent  \u2014   all of which Trump has succeeded in achieving the   opposite of. Trump would of course be the first to point out that both McCain and Romney lost and that he has been doubted at every step of his campaign. But the degree to which he seems unconcerned with his pariah status among name Republicans remains a key feature of his pursuit. To a comical extent, top Republicans willed themselves invisible when I reached out to them for this article, fearing, not incorrectly, that the conversation would turn to Trump. This included some of the most typically quotable Republicans, including former Trump challengers like Graham (\u201cHe\u2019s sorta had his fill talking about Trump,\u201d a spokesman emailed) Perry (\u201cThanks for thinking of him\u201d) and Ted Cruz (\u201cNot great timing on our end\u201d) the previous nominee Mitt Romney (\u201cYou are kind to think of me,\u201d he wrote) Trump stalwarts like Chris Christie (\u201cWe are going to take a pass this time\u201d)   Republican governors like Charlie Baker of Massachusetts (\u201cThe governor won\u2019t be available\u201d) and senators like Mike Lee, of Utah (\u201cSenator Lee would love to talk to you about the state of the G. O. P. and conservatism in general. We are free anytime after Nov 8. \u201d). I tried Rubio, who has undergone more public agony than perhaps anyone about Trump. Rubio looks nauseated whenever someone asks him about the man he called \u201cthe most vulgar person to ever aspire to the presidency\u201d but who later said he would be \u201chonored\u201d to speak for at the Republican convention before clarifying that if he did speak, he would only \u201cspeak about things I believe in, not somebody else\u2019s platform. \u201d Rubio also holds the astonishing position of saying he\u2019ll vote for someone he has previously declared unfit to hold the American nuclear codes. You envision him under a mushroom cloud, assuring his kids that it could be even worse  \u2014   at least he didn\u2019t vote for Clinton. There\u2019s a palpable weariness among Republicans, and it\u2019s still only June. Every day, it\u2019s something else. \u201cWhat it does is suck all the oxygen out of the chamber,\u201d Senator Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine, told me. \u201cI\u2019m trying to do my job as a senator, which does not end because we have a contentious and bizarre presidential candidate. \u201d Trump, after accumulating enough delegates to win the nomination with almost no visible operation or recognizable strategy, has only nominally scaled his campaign beyond where it was a few months ago. There is barely any   or field apparatus to speak of, and Trump has outsourced a great deal of the   of an enormous   campaign to the overtasked R. N. C. Priebus has won praise for revamping the   data and field infrastructure that he inherited from his embattled predecessor, Michael Steele, in 2011. But no national committee in recent memory has been called upon to pick up as much operational slack in a general election. I asked Priebus if he was frustrated that so much has been thrown into the R. N. C. \u2019s lap. \u201cIt\u2019s more frustrating for us when a campaign comes in and layers over our field staff,\u201d is how he spun it. In addition to celebrating the presidential nominee, national conventions are a showcase for party eminences, rising stars and elected officials. Not so here. The last nominee, Romney, and two living former presidents, George W. Bush and George H. W. Bush, have said they are not supporting Trump or will not campaign for him. McCain has said he would be skipping the convention and is pursuing his senate   in Arizona with characteristically gritted teeth: the familiar \u201cit pains me to do this\u201d routine. Three of the top five   in the primaries  \u2014   Cruz, Jeb Bush and the Ohio governor John Kasich  \u2014   have either made no commitment to support Trump or, in Bush\u2019s case, said definitively he would not support him. A fourth, Rubio, in addition to his prolonged and winding agony over Trump, has said he does \u201cnot want to be considered\u201d as Trump\u2019s running mate. This is a popular distancing trick doubling as a nifty   among reluctant Trump endorsers. \u201cTo the members of the press who are asking, while I am flattered to be mentioned,\u201d Nikki Haley said, \u201cmy plate is full, and I am not interested in serving as vice president. \u201d (For the record, Trump finds these expressions annoying. \u201cThey were never asked,\u201d Trump told me. \u201cI don\u2019t like it when they do that, because it\u2019s very dishonest. If they\u2019ve taken themselves out, it means they\u2019re not being asked. \u201d) There is a distinct sense among leading Republicans that if you take proper precautions  \u2014      \u2014   it\u2019s possible to avoid contagion. Ryan agreed to be interviewed for a Father\u2019s Day feature in People Magazine but only on the condition that no Trump questions be asked. Trump seems to fundamentally welcome the party\u2019s revulsion. As Ryan wavered over supporting him, Trump was privately saying that Ryan\u2019s rejection might actually help him, that he was just the kind of political lifer whom Trump positioned his campaign against. His   director (and a former caddie) Dan Scavino Jr. actually went public with this, tweeting out a link to a column in Breitbart headlined, \u201cPaul Ryan Is the Reason the G. O. P. Is Losing America. \u201d While Ryan is trying to refashion and sell the G. O. P. as a party of innovation and heart, Trump is a creature of mouth and gut and other   drivers. They can try to operate in parallel G. O. P. universes, but the two styles are often in obvious conflict. On the sunny morning of June 7 in Washington, Ryan and a group of seven House colleagues visited the mostly black neighborhood Anacostia to highlight a central idea of Ryan\u2019s agenda. After a meeting at a residential   center, the representatives took turns giving testimonials on why Republican policies  \u2014   lower taxes, entitlement reform, less regulation  \u2014   would better address the intractable problems of urban poverty. This was Ryan at his most earnest and  . His concern for the urban poor derives heavily from his intellectual mentor, Jack Kemp, the former Republican congressman, housing secretary and patron saint of     conservatism. Poverty is the first item of Ryan\u2019s   policy plan. He spoke at a lectern, surrounded by community leaders, and then invited questions from the press. Did Ryan have any regrets about endorsing Trump? \u201cI told you,\u201d Ryan said, smiling, turning to one of his hosts. The first six or so questions were about Trump. He was then in the midst of a furor over his repeated claims that Judge Gonzalo Curiel, the   jurist presiding in a civil case against Trump University, could not rule fairly because he was \u201cMexican. \u201d Ryan was blunt on the Curiel matter. \u201cClaiming a person can\u2019t do their job because of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of a racist comment,\u201d he said. That was the headline. Ryan expressed great frustration that such comments by Trump \u201cundercut these things,\u201d meaning this   event. When we spoke, Ryan was most eager to discuss Priebus, his old friend and fellow Wisconsinite. Along with the   governor, Scott Walker, the trio form a formidable G. O. P. axis of cheese heads. I asked Ryan how he, as the   elected Republican, would distinguish his mission as a party leader from Priebus\u2019s. \u201cI see my role as helping to define the standard, which are the issues,\u201d Ryan told me. Priebus\u2019s role is building the party\u2019s apparatus to be ready for the  . \u201cReince is basically being the adult in calming the situation,\u201d he added. \u201cHe is protecting that   process. Reince is protecting that from being disfigured or hijacked. \u201d Ryan views himself as a guardian of conservative \u201cideas. \u201d \u201cIdeas\u201d is one of those fetish words, popular among ambitious young pols (conservative   are constantly dropping Kemp\u2019s name). As the speaker of the Florida House, Rubio published a book in 2006 of \u201c100 innovative ideas\u201d and spoke about his love of ideas during his presidential campaign, before he started making   jokes about Trump. Bobby Jindal, the Louisiana governor who was then considered one of the   innovators of the party, warned after Romney\u2019s defeat in 2012 that the G. O. P. must stop being \u201cthe stupid party\u201d and urged fellow Republicans to talk \u201clike adults\u201d and swear off \u201coffensive and bizarre\u201d rhetoric. He then embarked on a presidential campaign in which his most memorable \u201cidea\u201d was suggesting that Trump \u201clooks like he\u2019s got a squirrel sitting on his head. \u201d (Jindal dropped out in November Trump barely bothered to insult him.) Jindal\u2019s \u201cstupid party\u201d remark reflected a concern among idea conservatives that was marinating well before Trump came along: that the Republican Party has taken on an increasingly   bent. There has been a strong populist allergy to elitism within the G. O. P. coalition for a long time. But Sarah Palin\u2019s emergence as the   nominee in 2008 and subsequent tenure as a party celebrity was a benchmark. Lesser imitators like Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain took turns as Republican   in 2012. Trump made his name as a national political figure in 2011 and 2012 with his flamboyant campaign to prove that Obama was not born in the United States, an   notion that was especially offensive to  . Four years later, the leader of what many Republicans had hoped was a nativist fringe movement is the party\u2019s presumed nominee. Ryan believed that he and fellow   in Congress could preserve the party\u2019s substantive core. This would be the laboratory from which he could remake the party\u2019s conservative identity while attracting new Republicans, including young and minority voters. \u201cI have to protect conservatism from being disfigured,\u201d Ryan told me. His focus, he said, is on \u201cideas, temperament and the future of conservatism. \u201d Ryan has little confidence that Trump cares at all about his ideas, possessed that temperament or had thought at all about the future of conservatism. Trump almost never talks about \u201cideas,\u201d unless you count blustery promises to \u201cbuild a wall and make Mexico pay for it,\u201d end lousy trade deals and \u201cwin\u201d again. When, after considerable public hesitation, Ryan finally did say he would \u201cvote for\u201d Trump, he wrote a column in a newspaper in Janesville, Wis. reiterating his view that \u201cpolitics can be a battle of ideas, not insults\u201d and that \u201cif we\u2019re going to unite, it has to be over ideas. \u201d He said he had become convinced that Trump \u201cwould help us turn the ideas in this agenda into laws. \u201d What Trump had going for him more than anything, in Ryan\u2019s eyes, was his willingness to outsource the conservative \u201cidea\u201d architecture of his administration to Ryan and   Republicans in the same way that he\u2019s farming out much of his   campaign to the R. N. C. Even so, there\u2019s no avoiding that Trump has over the last year been the ubiquitous voice of the G. O. P. to most voters, many of them new ones. He can cut a problematic image, to say the least. (In a June 15 Bloomberg poll, just 32 percent of Americans view the Republican Party favorably, the lowest figure since the survey\u2019s 2009 inception.) Priebus and Ryan were relatively powerless during the primaries as Trump undertook his systematic disfiguring of the R. N. C. \u2019s plans for a more inclusive party. Last summer, during the relatively innocent months of Trump\u2019s campaign, Priebus called and urged him to tone down his remarks (about \u201cMexican rapists,\u201d for example). Trump scoffed at the idea that such a puny figure, a party guy, would ever try such a thing. \u201cWe\u2019re not dealing with a   Army general,\u201d Trump said. Priebus paid a debasing house call to Trump Tower last fall to accompany Trump as he signed a loyalty pledge to the eventual nominee. He listened this spring to Trump predict \u201criots\u201d in Cleveland and complain about the \u201crigged\u201d system that might deny him his rightful nomination. (\u201cGive us all a break,\u201d Priebus tweeted at one point.) He has endured an outpouring from a gallery of   who are urging the R. N. C. to take extraordinary measures and disavow its extraordinary nominee. \u201cIf Priebus ends up blessing the Trump nomination,\u201d wrote the Washington Post columnist Michael Gerson, the head White House speechwriter for George W. Bush, \u201cit would turn the sins of Trump into the sins of the G. O. P. And Priebus would go down as the head of the party who squandered the legacy of Lincoln, the legacy of Reagan, in a squalid and hopeless political effort. \u201d Priebus is not a man for extraordinary measures. He is an organization man in a time of disruption, runaway   and selfie campaigns. Party guys go along. It\u2019s not always a fair fight. Political parties have seen better days in America. They are like many big and traditional institutions that way: the government, the church, among others. Signing on with the Donkeys and Elephants would seem a tired construct in a disintermediated culture of free agents and personal brand customization. Identities have replaced affiliations. In the course of reporting this article, I asked many Republicans of varied perspective why a young person today should consider joining a major political party. The question elicited sighs and head shakes, as if I were asking them why a millennial would join a Kiwanis Club, except that Kiwanis Clubs aren\u2019t actively being resisted the way the Democratic and Republican parties are. Based on data from a 2014 Pew survey, 39 percent of the electorate identify as independents, compared with 32 percent as Democrats and 23 percent as Republicans (that\u2019s the highest proportion of independents in nearly eight decades of surveys despite the fact that the country remains heavily partisan). It\u2019s certainly worth pointing out that people have been predicting the death of the   system in America for years and also the demise of individual parties at various low points. The G. O. P. was supposedly terminal after Barry Goldwater\u2019s landslide defeat of 1964, as were the Democrats following the rout of George McGovern in 1972 each party came back to win the White House four years later. Priebus, not surprisingly, is a defender of the party status quo. \u201cThe reality is, there\u2019s two doors that people can walk through in this country,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s not Italy. We don\u2019t have 12 different parties where everyone can fit into their exact box. \u201d Still, the culture and speed of technological change has fueled an accelerated shift in how voters engage with and perceive political institutions and politicians. When I asked Trump the \u201cwhy join a party?\u201d question, he said, \u201cI think the whole system is changing. \u201d His toggling between parties over the years has been well documented. Likewise, his embrace of atypical Republican positions during the primaries  \u2014   his support for some aspects of Planned Parenthood  \u2014   did nothing to thwart his nomination. It would indicate that voters might not be as wedded to the assumed conservative orthodoxies as G. O. P. leaders might think. \u201cYou have people who are socially conservative and fiscally nonconservative and vice versa,\u201d Trump told me. \u201cYou have so many different permutations now. \u201d Trump\u2019s embrace of this \u00e0 la carte approach comports to a sensibility of voters\u2019 choosing between models of disruption rather than a singular ideology. In a sense, disruption in and of itself has become an ideology. Whoever swings the biggest wrecking ball wins. \u201cWashington is so broken and needs to be disrupted, and a lot of what could happen in this disruption would be good,\u201d said Ben Sasse, a freshman Republican senator from Nebraska. \u201cUnfortunately, it has to be someone who takes seriously the stewarding of a whole nation. And who cares about facts. And who is trustworthy. \u201d Sasse was pointedly not talking about Trump. He has said that he could not support him as his party nominee. He would not be voting for Clinton either. \u201cThere are Dumpster fires in my town more popular than these two \u2018leaders,\u2019\u2019u2009\u201d he wrote in a Facebook post in which he predicted the imminent breakup of both parties. He was harsher on Trump. Everywhere he goes in Nebraska, Sasse told me, people ask him for advice. \u201cPeople say: \u2018I\u2019m distraught. I\u2019m opposed to everything Hillary Clinton stands for, and yet I think I have to vote for her. How do you make sense of this? What should I do? \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d he said. \u201cThese are young evangelical women, teary sometimes. They say, \u2018I can never tell my kids I voted for that man. \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d Sasse, who is 44, became an instant luminary of the   Never Trump movement after he unloaded on Trump. He is mostly avoiding interviews, though in a classic bit of politician   took this as an opportunity to share with me that \u201cI\u2019ve turned down something like 45 Sunday shows in a row. \u201d I asked Sasse if America\u2019s fascination with celebrity might help explain the rise of Trump. No, he said. \u201cThere is such crisis of shared vision for what America means right now,\u201d Sasse, a   former college president and business consultant, said. \u201cPeople desperately seek shallower pop culture as a form of escape rather than finding actual meaning. \u201d For politics to be satisfying, it requires deeper ideals. And to partake of it as just another celebrity snack food leads a citizen to feel, after a while, \u201clike you\u2019ve eaten a   of cotton candy. \u201d In a tweet from early May, Sasse tried to nudge the former senator Tom Coburn into making a   bid. Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican and   physician, left the Senate in 2015 after spending his career  \u2014   six years in the House, 10 in the Senate  \u2014   as one of Washington\u2019s proudest conservative mavericks and procedural troublemakers. Sasse told me that Coburn is one of his political idols. He also mentioned Paul Ryan. \u201cIf Tom Coburn and Paul Ryan have a baby,\u201d Sasse said, \u201cI\u2019m their hideous offspring. \u201d All things being equal, Coburn would welcome having a superdisrupter in Washington. He has never been a party guy. \u201cI don\u2019t think it really matters, the parties,\u201d Coburn, now retired and living in Tulsa, said. But Trump has been \u201crepulsive to me,\u201d he said, adding that Trump\u2019s ability to win a party nomination \u201ckind of fits with the modern social decline of America. \u201d I asked Coburn what Trump\u2019s nomination signaled about the state of G. O. P. He was characteristically glib, apocalyptic and idealistic. \u201cEither Trump is going to totally destroy the Republican Party,\u201d Coburn said. \u201cOr in the aftermath of him possibly losing an election, we\u2019re going to rebuild it stronger than ever. \u201d The    option is predicated on Trump\u2019s losing. Several Republicans I spoke to seemed to hope for this, if not explicitly. It is politically fraught, obviously, to say they will not support their party\u2019s presidential nominee. But based on my discussions, I\u2019m willing to bet a good portion of the elected Republicans who claim minimal allegiance to \u201cthe nominee\u201d will wind up voting for Clinton in the privacy of their voting booths while rooting for Trump\u2019s complete humiliation. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to have to swallow it,\u201d said Mark Salter, the longtime chief of staff and confidant of John McCain. \u201cHe\u2019s just unfit for the office,\u201d referring to Trump. As for Clinton, he said, \u201cI mean, the worst thing you can say about her is, she\u2019s kind of a hack. \u201d Ed Rogers, a Republican lobbyist and veteran of the Reagan and George H. W. Bush White Houses, calls himself a \u201cnot yet Republican,\u201d meaning he is \u201cnot yet\u201d ready to support Trump and has in fact moved in the opposite direction since Trump clinched the nomination last month. Rogers, a longtime business partner of the former Mississippi governor and R. N. C. chairman Haley Barbour, acknowledged that the Republicans tend to exaggerate Clinton\u2019s flaws as a trade prerogative. \u201cThe Clintons have never been the demons ideologically that we\u2019ve made them out to be,\u201d Rogers told me. \u201cFrom a character standpoint, they\u2019re pretty bad, but Hillary isn\u2019t the frightening offensive character that Trump is. \u201d If   Republicans rebelled against the \u201cestablishment\u201d in the primaries, Trump has provided the establishment with mounting ammunition to fight back in the 11th hour. The first half of June has been a running train wreck for Trump, beginning with his crusade against Judge Curiel. Trump has been provoking increasing alarm among Republicans at the moment he should be proving himself nominally \u201cpresidential. \u201d The Republican senator Mark Kirk of Illinois announced that he could no longer support Trump in the aftermath of Curiel (\u201cI think he\u2019s too bigoted and racist for the Land of Lincoln\u201d) Lindsey Graham did the same and urged other Republicans backing Trump to rescind their endorsements. Top Republicans voiced widespread opposition   to Trump\u2019s reiterated calls for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country. Trump in turn called party leaders \u201cweak\u201d and pounded them for not falling in line behind him. \u201cJust please be quiet, don\u2019t talk,\u201d he railed at them at a June 15 rally in Atlanta. \u201cWe have to have our Republicans either stick together or let me do it by myself,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019ll do very well. \u201d He would be banking on the   system being sufficiently hobbled that allegiance to him would prevail over partisan loyalty. Republicans wouldn\u2019t hold it against Trump that he\u2019s anathema to their establishment while Democrats would feel no loyalty to their traditional home team, let alone to Hillary Clinton. Trump appeared at this moment prepared to begin an independent   campaign under the nominal banner of the Republican Party, while using their abundant resources. This looked more like a jail break than a pivot. The second week of June was shaping up as another one of those \u201cBaileys in my cereal\u201d stretches for Reince Priebus. We were two days past the mass shooting in Orlando, a horrific event that moved Trump to tweet immediate thanks to all those who sent him \u201ccongrats\u201d for predicting it. He also called on Obama to resign and later seemed to suggest that the president might have even been complicit in the tragedy. This invited swift repudiations from Republicans and Democrats, including a furious Obama, whose presidential stature seems to grow the longer Trump dominates news cycles. Obama\u2019s net   rating has risen nearly 20 points since Trump became the G. O. P.   and the party\u2019s inescapable face last summer. Priebus spent the weekend in Utah at an annual \u201cideas\u201d gathering that Mitt Romney hosts for Republican luminaries, donors and business leaders. In a normal year, this would serve as a Republican unity confab before the convention: party bonding in the mountains. But this year\u2019s edition was more of a rock slide. It convened a huddle of the Never Trumps, disaffected    and increasingly skittish party notables like Ryan and Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee. Romney set the tone for the weekend when he told Wolf Blitzer on CNN that Trump in the White House could \u201cchange the character of the generations of Americans that are following\u201d and might result in \u201c  racism,\u201d \u201c  misogyny\u201d and \u201c  bigotry. \u201d In a    session with Ryan, the   chief executive Meg Whitman, who was the G. O. P. nominee for governor of California in 2010, questioned how Ryan could endorse such an appalling figure. She placed Trump in the company of Hitler and Mussolini. Romney appeared to tear up at one point, according to an account in Politico. \u201cSeeing this just breaks your heart,\u201d he said. Priebus played the good party soldier. \u201cRespect Mitt and differences but couldn\u2019t disagree more,\u201d he tweeted at Romney after his remarks. \u201cLet\u2019s stop this and unify. \u201d Priebus told Trump opponents at the retreat that Trump would win \u201cwith or without their help. \u201d He conveyed the exasperation of a substitute teacher being pelted with flying erasers. In almost every visit, Priebus and I had engaged in some variation on the same discussion. I kept asking him: \u201cWhose party is this anyway? Who gets to define the G. O. P. ?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the party\u2019s party,\u201d he always answered. \u201cThe party defines the party. \u201d Convention delegates write the platform that lays out the party\u2019s tenets. Trump can\u2019t really change those: It\u2019s a common refrain these days among   Republicans. \u201cTrump is not going to change the institution,\u201d the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, told Politico last month, referring to the G. O. P. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to change the basic philosophy of the party. \u201d Priebus and others might try to shape Trump\u2019s behavior. They talk every day, Priebus and Trump. And tens of millions of people are having their impressions formed, shaped or solidified about today\u2019s Republican Party by watching Donald Trump. They will vote for or against him in droves, not based on anything they read in the platform, whose readership probably amounts to less than 1 percent of Trump\u2019s Twitter following. As I waited for Priebus in the lobby of the R. N. C. I noticed a tweet from an Associated Press reporter saying that Lamar Alexander, a Republican senator, had just suggested Trump might not be the surefire nominee after all. \u201cWe do not have a nominee until after the convention,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cThat\u2019s what you say,\u201d Alexander added in response to a reminder that Trump was in fact the \u201cpresumptive nominee. \u201d It would seem ridiculously late in the process to be haggling over modifiers, at least it would be in a mythical normal year. When I walked into Priebus\u2019s office, he sat on his couch and soldiered forth like a good party guy. If Ryan and McConnell tried to remain boxed off from the earthquake, Priebus occupied another shelter, constructed of   armor, alternate reality and denial. \u201cI\u2019m feeling good about things,\u201d Priebus told me. His voice was flat and deliberate,   mode. It was hard to resist a few pokes at the organization man. How\u2019s that Trump pivot working out? \u201cI think it\u2019s a work in progress,\u201d Priebus said. He was trying to be upbeat. \u201cI have Hillary Clinton on the other side,\u201d he said, clinging to her as a lifeline. He was hoarse. I noticed him fiddling with a drink coaster. The coaster bore a cartoon rendition, sure enough, of Donald Trump: the only physical likeness I noticed anywhere in the building. Priebus had swiped a couple of these coasters from the bar at the   Hotel and found them amusing. He set them on a side table in his office, next to the fish tank. He predicted that Clinton\u2019s campaign would be a \u201crace to the bottom. \u201d Well, yes. There\u2019s nothing like claims of moral high ground on a campaign. But I couldn\u2019t help reminding Priebus that Trump recently accused President Bill Clinton of rape, Obama of treason, Hillary Clinton of murdering Vince Foster, Cruz\u2019s dad of associating with assassins, Romney of not being a \u201creal\u201d Mormon and the rest of the litany. Where did the bottom even begin, and where could it possibly end? Priebus said that the rape and Vince Foster things were \u201csort of just warning shots to the Hillary campaign. \u201d He also claimed that Trump and Clinton were running \u201ctied in the polls,\u201d though this was being contradicted as we spoke. Clinton led Trump by 12 points in a new Bloomberg survey, with 55 percent of respondents saying they would never vote for the Republican and in an ABC   Post poll, seven in 10 Americans viewed Trump unfavorably, up 10 points in just the last month. A few days earlier, the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt said that Republicans\u2019 accepting Trump as the nominee was \u201clike ignoring Stage IV cancer. \u201d There was a new wave of \u201cDump Trump\u201d stories in the media, mostly featuring the same band of   Never Trumpers who seem to spend vast amounts of time on Twitter. I asked Priebus about any convention situation that could deny Trump the nomination. He did not reject the possibility, but it\u2019s remote. It would require an alternative candidate (none currently) an organizing effort and a confluence of highly unlikely rule changes, delegate votes and procedural   whose likelihood Priebus compared to drawing an inside straight three times in a row. \u201cI think people are living in Fantasy Land,\u201d he said, not saying whether he shared in the fantasy. Priebus was heading out to catch a flight to Greensboro, N. C. for a   event with Trump that night. He was playing a role, the party guy, the proprietor of the china shop in the time of the bull. There was something oddly comforting to me about this presence, as thankless and unenviable as the life of Priebus might seem these days. What could be better for a lifer apparatchik? Priebus made a perfect   foil to a new politics of blazing chaos. \u201cIt could be a great moment or a bad moment,\u201d Priebus told me. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to be a moment. \u201d I thanked Priebus for his time. He was still fumbling with the cartoon Donald Trump coasters. \u201cYour party\u2019s made this story fun for me,\u201d I told him. \u201cHave I made it fun?\u201d he asked, almost plaintively. \u201cOr have I made it less fun?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742563146.530097}
