[Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings (D) and State Representative Eric Johnson (  100) submitted a letter Thursday to Dallas County Elections Administrator Toni   after public concerns continued to mount about scores of reports involving a potential absentee voter fraud scheme.  \u201cAccording to reports, dozens of voters received   ballots they never requested,\u201d the letter states, which \u201csuggests the possibility of a coordinated effort to benefit a candidate or candidates in the upcoming Dallas City Council elections. \u201d As Breitbart Texas previously reported, the episode began when West   pastor James Armstrong alerted local media and officials alike that some of his congregants came forward with evidence that absentee ballots were arriving at their respective homes without first asking for them, as Texas law requires. \u201cIt\u2019s just a travesty that we are dealing with this,\u201d Armstrong told NBC DFW at the time. \u201cSeniors who have lived in this neighborhood all of their life and are now being taken advantage of. \u201d Another community resident, Alice Washington, 81, lodged similar complaints with the County via her niece, Barbara Roberson. \u201cI said, \u2018Would you please send me a copy of that application because I\u2019d like to see her signature\u2019,\u201d Roberson told WFAA at the time. \u201cSomeone forged her signature,\u201d said Roberson after review of the paperwork. In the week following, dozens of similar complaints have been made, according to Mayor Rawlings\u2019 joint letter. The duo also notes a possible pattern in recent elections: What\u2019s more startling is that this is the second time in less than a year that we have heard reports of irregularities in West Dallas. In November, media reports indicated someone fraudulently mailed ballots for dozens of elderly or dead voters. Previous Breitbart Texas coverage noted where election integrity experts explained root causes for the latest episode and steps Texas can take to fix the matter going forward: Election integrity advocates have argued that absentee ballot problems can sometimes be rooted in poor maintenance of the underlying voter records. The Public Interest Legal Foundation noted in response to the Dallas episode that Texas should consider tightening procedures for requesting absentee ballots. \u201cAs long as you have a name and address of another voter, you\u2019re good to go   \u2026     You don\u2019t even need to give a birth date,\u201d a group spokesperson told Lifezette. Analysts say that requiring absentee ballot applications to include driver\u2019s license or other   identification numbers could cut down impersonation attempts like claimed by the Washington family. Recent fraud conspiracies prosecuted in southern Texas point to a possible example for how elderly voters are preyed upon through the mail voting system. After an unsolicited ballot arrives, an illicit     political operative would visit the recipient\u2019s home, offering \u201cassistance\u201d with completing and returning the form with   candidates in mind. One recent Texas case involved a U. S. Postal Service delivery man taking bribes in trade for allowing \u201cpolitiqueras\u201d to follow his truck, indicating which homes received ballots. The mailman also allegedly took part in campaigning for local Democrat candidates while in uniform as well. Short of legislative reforms, Mayor Rawlings and Rep. Johnson were left to implore   to \u201cdevote additional resources to verify the integrity of each   ballot in Dallas. \u201d Rawlings Johnson Re Mail Ballots by BreitbartTexas on Scribd,  Logan Churchwell is a founding editor of the Breitbart Texas team.
