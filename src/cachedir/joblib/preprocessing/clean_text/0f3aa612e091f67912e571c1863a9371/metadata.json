He also believes that internal strife at the FBI and the agencies upset with Comey\u2019s decision not pursue charges against Hillary Clinton also played a role in Comey\u2019s decision to act now. \\n\u201cI think there\u2019s something happening. People are asking me what is this about. I think something big is going to happen. I don\u2019t know what it is. It\u2019s just my gut feeling\u2026 I think he couldn\u2019t hold onto it any longer. OK. Because who knows? Maybe the locals would have stepped in on this. \u201d \\nOn Sunday Kallstrom was a guest on a radio show where he called the Clintons a \u201ccrime family.\u201d \\n\u201cThe Clintons, that\u2019s a crime family, basically,\u201d Kallstrom said. \u201cIt\u2019s like organized crime. I mean the Clinton Foundation is a cesspool .\u201d \\n\u2026 \\nHe also blasted Attorney General Loretta Lynch, claiming that she impeded the investigation into Clinton\u2019s private server. \\n\u201cThe problem here is this investigation was never a real investigation,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem. They never had a grand jury empanelled, and the reason they never had a grand jury empanelled, I\u2019m sure, is Loretta Lynch would not go along with that.\u201d \\nKallstrom also gave some insight to what is happening inside the agency right now, \u201cThe agents are furious with what\u2019s going on, I know that for a fact.\u201d \\nInterestingly, over at NBC, Larry Kudlow confirmed much of what Kallstrom said over the weekend when he told Chuck Todd that the FBI was in \u201cfull revolt.\u201d \\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m hearing from everybody, I mean, I have some sources in the F.B.I. and the former district attorney\u2019s. The F.B.I. is in full revolt right now. The F.B.I. has been in full revolt since the decisions made last summer\u2026 what I\u2019m getting at is if Comey hadn\u2019t said what he said to Congress and the rest of the world, it would have leaked. It would have leaked. That whole building was ready to leak that they had discovered this new source with Weiner and Abedin. So, I don\u2019t think Comey had much chance here. And I think the F.B.I. is badly divided.\u201d \\nShould we dare to hope? Could we really see justice meted out on the Clinton Crime Family? I\u2019m not ready to throw a \u201cHillary to Jail\u201d party yet, but I\u2019ll be watching what happens over the next few weeks with high hopes for justice. \\nBy the way, Kallstrom wasn\u2019t the only former Assistant Director of the FBI speaking out about the Clinton Family\u2019s corruption recently. \\n  Constitution.com  '"}, "time": 1742561992.185309}
