Trump dismissed Meryl Streep as \u201ca Hillary lover\u201d early Monday morning after the actress, in a speech at the Golden Globes award ceremony, denounced him as a bully who disrespected and humiliated others. Mr. Trump, in a brief telephone interview, said he had not seen Ms. Streep\u2019s remarks or other parts of the Globes ceremony, which were broadcast on NBC, but he added that he was \u201cnot surprised\u201d that he had come under attack from \u201cliberal movie people. \u201d [ Read Meryl Streep\u2019s Golden Globes speech ] The Globes were the last   Hollywood event before Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration on Jan. 20, a transfer of power that many in the entertainment industry have bemoaned. While   comments at the Globes were relatively restrained, Ms. Streep, one of the most outspoken progressives in the film world, mounted a powerful critique of Mr. Trump\u2019s abilities as a performer, complimenting in a backhanded way a style of showmanship that she all but called insidious. \u201cThere was one performance this year that stunned me  \u2014   it sank its hooks in my heart,\u201d Ms. Streep said. \u201cNot because it was good there was nothing good about it. But it was effective and it did its job. It made its intended audience laugh, and show their teeth. \u201cIt was that moment when the person asking to sit in the most respected seat in our country imitated a disabled reporter,\u201d she said, referring to a speech by Mr. Trump in 2015 when he shuddered and flailed his arms, seeming to mock a disabled reporter for The New York Times. \u201cIt kind of broke my heart when I saw it, and I still can\u2019t get it out of my head, because it wasn\u2019t in a movie. It was real life. \u201d Mr. Trump, as he has done many times before, grew heated in the interview as he flatly denied that he had intended to make fun of the Times reporter, Serge F. Kovaleski. \u201cI was never mocking anyone,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI was calling into question a reporter who had gotten nervous because he had changed his story,\u201d arguing that the reporter had been trying to back away from an article he wrote in September 2001 about the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and elsewhere that month. \u201cPeople keep saying I intended to mock the reporter\u2019s disability, as if Meryl Streep and others could read my mind, and I did no such thing,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cAnd remember, Meryl Streep introduced Hillary Clinton at her convention, and a lot of these people supported Hillary,\u201d Mr. Trump said, referring to Ms. Streep\u2019s remarks at the Democratic National Convention last summer on behalf of his opponent, Mrs. Clinton. Later Monday morning, Mr. Trump, in a series of tweets, called Ms. Streep \u201cone of the most   actresses in Hollywood,\u201d and \u201ca Hillary flunky who lost big. \u201d He also reiterated his argument that he had not mocked the reporter \u201cbut simply showed him \u2018groveling. \u2019\u201d Ms. Streep\u2019s artful denunciation of Mr. Trump  \u2014   whom she never mentioned by name  \u2014   drew applause from many other actors at the Globes ceremony, but also attacks online from the  \u2019s allies, like Sean Hannity, as well as some Republicans, like Meghan McCain, who are critical of Mr. Trump but see Hollywood liberals as only emboldening his supporters. Ms. Streep\u2019s speech did not seem intended to win people over  \u2014   she spoke dismissively of football and mixed martial arts at one point  \u2014   but rather to voice frustration and anger before Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration. \u201cThis instinct to humiliate, when it\u2019s modeled by someone in the public platform, by someone powerful, it filters down into everybody\u2019s life, because it kind of gives permission for other people to do the same thing,\u201d she said in her remarks. \u201cDisrespect invites disrespect, violence incites violence. And when the powerful use their position to bully others we all lose. \u201d Mr. Trump said that, Ms. Streep and her allies aside, he was confident that celebrities and others would turn out in strong numbers for his inauguration. \u201cWe are going to have an unbelievable, perhaps   turnout for the inauguration, and there will be plenty of movie and entertainment stars,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAll the dress shops are sold out in Washington. It\u2019s hard to find a great dress for this inauguration. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564444.1245966}
