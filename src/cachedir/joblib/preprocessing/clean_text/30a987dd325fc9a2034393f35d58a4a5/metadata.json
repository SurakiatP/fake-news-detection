Instead, the Republican nominee appears to have aides creating \u201cTrump safe\u201d messages on his behalf while he focuses his energy on whining and lying at his live rallies. \\nDuring the rally in the battleground state of Florida, Obama labeled Trump as being \u201cuniquely unqualified\u201d and \u201ctemperamentally unfit\u201d to serve as Commander-in-Chief. \u201cI\u2019ve been in this office now almost eight years and here\u2019s what I can tell you,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWho you are, what you are, does not change when you take office. It just magnifies who you are. It just shines a spotlight on who are you.\u201d Every day there\u2019s another example of how much of a complete joke Trump\u2019s campaign has been over the past year. But as much as we would love to laugh at this clown, we must first make sure he doesn\u2019t get elected. Or else the joke\u2019s on us.
