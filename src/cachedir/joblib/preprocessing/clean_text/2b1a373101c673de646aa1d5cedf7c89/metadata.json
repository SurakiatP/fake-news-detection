Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was a guest at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) Thursday, stating that she is working to \u201cfind common ground\u201d with the teachers\u2019 unions that were vocal opponents of her nomination and confirmation. [During an interview with CNN\u2019s Kayleigh McEnany at CPAC, DeVos said she had a \u201cgreat conversation\u201d with Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT). McEnany mentioned that DeVos has not had the same type of exchange with Lily Eskelsen Garcia, president of the National Education Association (NEA).  \u201cI think it\u2019s imperative that we work together to find common ground,\u201d DeVos said. \u201cIf students represent 100 percent of our future, we need to be focused on what\u2019s right for them and doing what\u2019s right for them. \u201d \u201cMy conversation with Randi was great, and we\u2019ve agreed to visit schools together,\u201d the secretary added. \u201cI will visit a school she selects  \u2014   a traditional public school  \u2014   and she will visit a choice school. So I look forward to that opportunity. \u201d However, Weingarten tweeted that DeVos was attempting a \u201cdivide and conquer Schtick\u201d: . @BetsyDeVosED tried a divide conquer Schtick at #CPAC2017, today. .regardless of whether we talk to u, both unions believe 1000% in pub ed,  \u2014   Randi Weingarten (@rweingarten) February 23, 2017,  Eskelsen Garcia released a statement last week: Education Secretary Betsy DeVos called me the other day saying we should talk. But this seems premature. I\u2019m still struck by the lack of clear answers she gave the public at her Senate hearing. There is no doubt where we stand on issues critical to supporting students and public education, but Americans have a right to know where she stands. So I sent her a letter, asking for the answers that we didn\u2019t get from her confirmation hearing. I have yet to receive a response  \u2026     Weingarten rebuked protesters who attempted to block DeVos from entering a public school in Washington, D. C. just days after her confirmation: Just heard a protester blocked  almost knocked Secy @BetsyDeVos down at Jefferson. We don\u2019t condone such acts. We want her to go to pub schls,  \u2014   Randi Weingarten (@rweingarten) February 10, 2017,  \u201cWe don\u2019t condone such acts,\u201d Weingarten tweeted. \u201cWe want her to go to public schools. \u201d At CPAC, DeVos spoke from prepared remarks for about ten minutes and then sat down for an interview with McEnany, who said she was \u201cthrilled\u201d for the secretary\u2019s visit. She added, \u201cThe nation is so blessed to have you as secretary of education. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628427.3697624}
