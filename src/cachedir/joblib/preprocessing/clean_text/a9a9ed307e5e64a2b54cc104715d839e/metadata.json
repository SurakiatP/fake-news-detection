Gold! Gold!\u201d \\nIt described a resplendent scene at the port involving mountains of yellow metal and men returning from the \u201cNew Eldorado\u201d with fortunes as high as $100,000. \\nTrump sold everything and headed north. \\nThe move to Canada spared him financial disaster. He not only sold off two Seattle eateries, but also land in nearby Monte Cristo, Wash. \u2014 right before floods and avalanches destroyed the nearby railroad and development plans for the town were scrapped. \\nBlair describes his perilous northward journey in early 1898. \\nAfter boarding a crowded ship to Alaska, Trump trekked over mountains, through Canadian customs, and to the Yukon River where he had to build a boat from scratch and transport a year\u2019s worth of personal supplies. \\nThe worst was a notorious mountain pass. The U.S. National Parks Service estimates 3,000 animals died on the White Pass, with many bones still visible today in its so-called Dead Horse Gulch. \\n\u201cOwners whipped horses, donkeys, mules, oxen, and dogs until they dropped. The bodies were not buried or even moved,\u201d Blair writes. \\n\u201cTravellers \u2026 had no choice but to walk over the remains. As the months went by, the walls of the pass were stained dark red from the blood.\u201d \\nTrump smelled opportunity. \\nHe opened a canteen along the route, Blair says, where weary travellers likely stopped for a bite of Arctic roadkill. There are records for similar establishments along the route, Blair writes: \u201cA frequent dish was fresh-slaughtered, quick-frozen horse.\u201d \\nThis established a pattern for Trump\u2019s Canadian business model. \\nIt\u2019s summed up in one chapter title: \u201cMining the Miners.\u201d \\nUnlike other gold-crazed migrants, Blair wrote, \u201c[Trump] realized that the best way to get [rich] was to lay down his pick and shovel and pick up his accounting ledger.\u201d \\n\u2018Liquor and sex\u2019 \\nIn his three years in Canada, Trump opened the Arctic Restaurant and Hotel in two locations with a partner \u2014 first on Bennett Lake in northern B.C., and then moving it to Whitehorse, Yukon. \\nTheir two-storey wood-framed establishment gained a reputation as the finest eatery in the area, Blair said \u2014 offering salmon, duck, caribou, and oysters. \\nIt offered more than food. \\n\u201cThe   sex,\u201d Blair wrote. She cited newspaper ads referring obliquely to prostitution \u2014 mentioning private suites for ladies, and scales in the rooms so patrons could weigh gold if they preferred to pay for services that way. \\nOne Yukon Sun writer moralized about the backroom goings-on: \u201cFor single men the Arctic has the best restaurant,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut I     sex.\u201d \\nThe Mounties initially tolerated the rowdiness. There were exceptions, according to the legendary Canadian writer Pierre Berton. People faced forced labour or banishment from town if they cheated at cards; made a public ruckus; or partied on the Lord\u2019s Day. \\n\u201cSaloons and dance halls, theatres and business houses were shut tight one minute before midnight on Saturday,\u201d Berton wrote in \u201cKlondike Fever.\u201d \\n\u201cTwo minutes before twelve the lookout at the faro table would take his watch from his pocket and call out: \u2018The last turn, boys!\u201d\u2018 \\n\u2018I wouldn\u2019t call him a pimp\u2019 \\nTrump acted as cook, bouncer, waiter. \\nBut Blair cautions: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call him a pimp.\u201d \\nShe said backroom ribaldry was part of the restaurant package in those towns, and it\u2019s not clear how the arrangement worked: \u201cAs somebody trying to attract business to his restaurant, of course he would have liquor. Of course he would arrange easy access to women. A pimp is, I think, a different business model.\u201d \\nBy early 1901, trouble was brewing. \\nThe Mounties announced plans to banish prostitution, and curb gambling and liquor. Trump quarrelled with his partner. Gold strikes were getting scarcer. \\n\u201cThe boom was over, Frederick Trump realized,\u201d Blair wrote. \u201cHe had made money; perhaps even more unusual in the Yukon, he had also kept it and departed with a substantial nest-egg.\u201d \\nHe returned to Germany with US$582,000 in today\u2019s currency, and found a wife. But he was greeted as a draft-dodger for being away and becoming a U.S. citizen during his military years. \\nSo he was deported from his own country. He boarded a ship for New York, his wife pregnant with Donald\u2019s dad. \\nThe elder Trump died of pneumonia in 1918, leaving behind some real estate. His son built the empire, his grandson the global brand. \\nIronically, their heir is now running for president on a platform of mass-deportation. But Donald and grandpa share some traits \u2014 an entrepreneurial spirit, and formative youthful adventures in Canada. \\nDonald met his first wife, Ivana, at the Montreal Olympics.
