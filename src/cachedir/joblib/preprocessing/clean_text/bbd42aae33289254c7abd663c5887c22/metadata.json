However, things didn\u2019t go so well for Hillary Clinton, who was humiliated when a camera caught what she immediately tried to hide to save her campaign \u2014 which backfired big time. \\nWhile Donald Trump\u2019s 15,000-person army of \u201cDeplorables\u201d were holding down the fort in Stanford, Florida as they listened to this great leader explain how he plans to make America great again, Hillary was at a much smaller venue at Palm Beach State College. Although she was feeling pretty good about herself with having a higher turnout than she\u2019s used to, the approximate 1,000 to 2,000 attendees paled in comparison to what Trump was looking at in the same state. However, Hillary\u2019s anemic crowd was enough to be publicly mocked in front of. \\nPerhaps Hillary didn\u2019t think anyone would notice, but Fox Business Network was watching \u2014 and commenting \u2014 live. With just fifteen minutes before the Democratic candidate was set to take the stage in one of her final and most important rallies, the small room should have been jam-packed with people. As the humored hosts noted on the news show, that was far from the case. \\n\u201cHere it is nowhere near the size of the crowd we saw in Sanford, Florida yesterday for Mr. Trump, 15,000. There\u2019s maybe a thousand to two thousand people here today,\u201d one host pointed out much to Hillary\u2019s embarrassment. \u201cThe Clinton rallies tend to be much smaller and you can see there\u2019s empty space here and she\u2019s supposed to speak in 15 minutes. And I can tell you that as the camera pans across that if we were at a Trump rally this would absolutely be packed,\u201d the commentators added. \\nNo matter how far ahead in the polls Hillary and her lapdog media says she is, the attendance at her events speaks volumes. Nobody cares or is enthusiastic enough about this woman to bother showing up, and those who do have to be coached on how to chant and act excited. \\nOn the other hand, there are Trump\u2019s rallies, where so many people turn up to venues four times the size as Hillary\u2019s that these massive stadiums can\u2019t contain everyone who is eager to come, and some are turned away. If the turnout at the rallies is any indicator of what\u2019s expected at the polls, Hillary can\u2019t win, and if she does, Americans should definitely question how that could even happen'"}, "time": 1742561620.8047836}
