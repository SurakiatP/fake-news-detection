Trump offered a vivid example on Sunday to prove his point. Imagine being wooed by Mr. Trump. \u201cLook, nobody has better toys than I do,\u201d he told reporters at a hotel on Staten Island, where he pressed his case that the system was rigged against him. \u201cI can put them in the best planes and bring them to the best resorts anywhere in the world. \u201d But Mr. Trump said that was unseemly. \u201cYou\u2019re basically buying these people,\u201d he added. \u201cYou\u2019re basically saying, \u2018Delegate, listen, we\u2019re going to send you to    on a Boeing 757, you\u2019re going to use the spa, you\u2019re going to this, you\u2019re going to that, we want your vote.\u2019 That\u2019s a corrupt system. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s comments were the latest salvo in an escalating war against the Republican National Committee over how delegates were being selected in the presidential race. On Sunday, two days before New York\u2019s primaries, Mr. Trump was the only Republican presidential candidate to campaign in the state, where polls showed him with a wide lead. During his visit to Staten Island, a stronghold of his support, he accepted an award from the New York Veteran Police Association and spoke at a party brunch. At a rally in Poughkeepsie, he berated party officials once again. Still, speaking to reporters on Staten Island, Mr. Trump said he hoped that the July convention \u201cdoesn\u2019t involve violence. \u201d \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think it will,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I will say this: It\u2019s a rigged system. It\u2019s a crooked system. It\u2019s 100 percent crooked. \u201d On the Democratic side, where the primary is expected to be closer, Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders spent the day trying to drum up support. Polls have shown Mrs. Clinton with an edge over Mr. Sanders, but Mr. Sanders is hoping for an unexpectedly strong performance that would embarrass Mrs. Clinton on her adopted turf. Both candidates were knocked off balance this weekend when questioned about an issue with particular relevance in New York: a bill that would allow foreign governments to be held responsible in American courts for having a role in terrorist attacks, such as the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. The New York Times reported on Friday that Saudi Arabia had told the Obama administration and members of Congress that it would sell off hundreds of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of American assets held by the kingdom if Congress passed the bill. The Obama administration has lobbied Congress to block the bill\u2019s passage, The Times reported. In television interviews broadcast on Sunday, Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton said they needed more information to say where they stood on the bill. But after Mrs. Clinton\u2019s interview aired, her campaign released a statement breaking with the Obama administration. The statement said Mrs. Clinton supported efforts \u201cto secure the ability of   families and other victims of terrorist acts to hold accountable those responsible. \u201d Later in the day, Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign also issued a statement in support of the legislation. Mrs. Clinton made several stops in New York on Sunday. In Mount Vernon, she spoke at a Baptist church, saying she was the candidate most willing to take stands in favor of gun control, while in Upper Manhattan she danced at a block party in Washington Heights. She also held a rally on Staten Island. At a block party in the   section of Brooklyn, Mayor Bill de Blasio urged New Yorkers to help turn out votes for her, and Mrs. Clinton greeted him with a hug and a kiss on the cheek. \u201cAnybody see the debate?\u201d she asked, addressing the crowd from the bed of a Ford pickup truck and referring to the Democratic debate on Thursday in Brooklyn. \u201cWe talked about the greed and recklessness of Wall Street. I take a back seat to no one in taking them on. \u201d After hosting packed rallies around the state, Mr. Sanders turned his attention on Sunday to courting black voters in New York City, visiting a predominantly black church in Harlem and a Brownsville housing project. Mr. Sanders also had a rally in Prospect Park in Brooklyn, which his campaign said drew more than 28, 000 people, the largest crowd of his presidential bid. In Brownsville, Mr. Sanders toured the Howard Houses along with some local elected officials, and his campaign later released a plan for affordable housing. \u201cThis is the wealthiest country in the history of the world,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cPeople should not be forced to live in dilapidated housing. \u201d As Mr. Sanders walked across the complex, several residents happily shouted at him. But others pointedly criticized him for using the apartments for what they viewed as a photo opportunity. Anthony Portis, 34, a construction worker, called the senator\u2019s visit \u201ca political stunt to gain all the black votes in the neighborhood. \u201d \u201cThis area always feels like we are left out,\u201d he said. Mr. Sanders said that he understood that some would be apprehensive about his visit but that he wanted to call attention to the issues faced by people in housing projects. \u201cBelieve me, I can understand the cynicism,\u201d he said. \u201cBut my understanding is that not too many presidential candidates have come to Brownsville housing projects. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564432.0727499}
