S.  border wall was \u201ca political stunt. \u201d  Durbin said, \u201cThe Democrats in the house and the senate are ready to work and cooperate with the White House to keep the government open. But we told the president weeks ago, don\u2019t try any political stunts, don\u2019t put any poison pills into this process. Let\u2019s just do the responsible important work of funding this government. We know what this wall is all about. This was a promise made by the president during his campaign. Don\u2019t you remember he said the Mexicans were going to pay for it? Now we know it\u2019s going to cost 20 to 70 billion dollars for this wall. We have Democrats and Republicans all along the border opposing this deal. It\u2019s a political stunt, an obsession for the president that should not shut down our government. \u201d He added, \u201cI hope the president will back off. To think that he would consider shutting down the government of the United States of America over this outlandish proposal of a border wall which we can\u2019t even pay for at this point and is opposed by Democrats and Republicans all along the border, that would be the height of irresponsibility. He would not want that to define his first 100 days. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742563993.0274096}
