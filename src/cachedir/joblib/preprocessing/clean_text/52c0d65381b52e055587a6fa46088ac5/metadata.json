Trump\u2019s    told business leaders in New York that Mr. Trump will be pushing a $1 trillion infrastructure plan closer to the ideal of Democrats than Republicans. At the same event, Senator Chuck Schumer, the incoming minority leader, sounded similarly conciliatory. \u25a0 Mr. Trump took to Twitter on Friday to again play down Russian interference in the elections  \u2014   this time, seemingly praising one of the cyberattacks for the revelations it contained. The Trump family on Friday appears to have canceled a charity auction that featured the  \u2019s daughter Ivanka, as criticism mounted that the future first family\u2019s charitable solicitation risked opening the White House to special interests seeking to pay for access. The auction for a chance to spend up to 45 minutes with Ms. Trump over coffee at either Trump Tower in New York or the recently opened Trump International Hotel in Washington was to continue for another three days. As of Friday morning, the high bid was $72, 888. But then the auction disappeared from the Charitybuzz website that had been hosting it, along with details on all the bids that had been offered since it opened on Dec. 5. \u201cThe loser is St. Jude, and the winner I\u2019m not exactly sure,\u201d one of the bidders, the   restaurateur Russell Ybarra, wrote in an email, referring to the Tennessee children\u2019s hospital, which stood to reap the proceeds. Eric Trump, in an interview Thursday, had said he was considering terminating the auction, after The New York Times raised questions about it. The Trump Organization and Charitybuzz did not immediately respond Friday to a request for comment. The Obama family has not directly participated in any   solicitation efforts since President Obama took office to avoid the impression that donations would allow the donor to get special access, said Norm Eisen, a former White House ethics lawyer. The  \u2019s    and close adviser, Jared Kushner, told New York business leaders on Friday that Mr. Trump\u2019s vision for a   federal infrastructure program was \u201ccloser\u201d to Senator Chuck Schumer\u2019s, the incoming minority leader, than to the majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell\u2019s. Mr. Kushner made the remarks at an event hosted by the Partnership for New York City, just after an appearance by Mr. Schumer, the New York senator. This week at a news conference in Washington, Mr. McConnell said he was not interested in \u201c  stimulus\u201d to finance any infrastructure plan, setting up what could be the first of many clashes with a Trump White House that will not always hew to Republican orthodoxy. The Trump campaign floated a $1 trillion infrastructure plan that would depend on private investors raising money and building the projects with the aid of some form of tax credit. Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist, said shortly after the election that a huge infrastructure plan would be in the offing, but the form was not clear. Democrats have long said they want an infrastructure plan that has plentiful direct federal funding, something Mr. Schumer has said repeatedly, not tax credits for rich developers. This does not excite Mr. McConnell who, like most Republicans, recalls President Obama\u2019s early stimulus plan unfavorably. That plan came in the middle of the worst recession since the Depression. Mr. Trump inherits an economy that is healthy enough that the Federal Reserve raised interest rates Wednesday to head off overheating. The Fed has made it clear that if Mr. Trump insists on pumping money into the economy, it will hasten rate increases to stave off inflation. \u201cWe need to do this carefully and correctly, and the issue of how to pay for it needs to be dealt with responsibly,\u201d Mr. McConnell, the Kentucky senator, said this week. Senate watchers used to the obstructionist stance that the Republican leader, Mr. McConnell, took with President Obama for eight years have been waiting for signs of the kind of minority leader that Mr. Schumer will be when he takes over as Democratic leader. The Democratic senator sent a big flashing of conciliation on Friday. Mr. Schumer praised Mr. Trump\u2019s call with the president of Taiwan, which drew objections from both sides of the aisle, as a shrewd move that sent a signal to China of a change in direction. Mr. Schumer made the remarks at the same annual meeting of the Partnership for New York City that Mr. Kushner spoke at, according to two people in attendance. Those attendees interpreted the comments as aligning Mr. Schumer with Mr. Trump on a diplomatic issue that has been met with consternation by the Obama White House. Mr. Schumer described the call that Mr. Trump took roughly two weeks ago as shrewd, and not necessarily indicating that it was a reflection of his view of the \u201cOne China\u201d policy, the two attendees said. An aide to Mr. Schumer did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment. Mr. Schumer has been a critic of China as a currency manipulator over the years. At the breakfast, where he was followed by Mr. Kushner, Mr. Schumer suggested that Democrats lost in part because the election was about a change in course, and Hillary Clinton ran as a continuation of the Obama administration\u2019s direction. The   took to Twitter on Friday to again dismiss the significance of Russia\u2019s meddling in the election  \u2014   but with a new twist. This time, he seemed to praise the revelations of one of the cyberattacks. The post seems to refer to an email stolen from the Democratic National Committee and given to WikiLeaks that came from a Democratic strategist, Donna Brazile, before a CNN Democratic primary debate in Flint, Mich. Ms. Brazile\u2019s subject line: \u201cOne of the questions directed to HRC tomorrow is from a woman with a rash. \u201d \u201cHer family has lead poison and she will ask what, if anything, will Hillary do as president to help the ppl of Flint,\u201d Ms. Brazile wrote to John D. Podesta, the Clinton campaign chairman, and Jennifer Palmieri, the candidate\u2019s communications director. That might seem like a pretty obvious question, given that the debate was in Flint to address the crisis over the city\u2019s   water. But it cost Ms. Brazile her commentator\u2019s job at CNN, and it helped to fuel Mr. Trump\u2019s accusation during the campaign that the election was \u201crigged\u201d in Hillary Clinton\u2019s favor. A new CBS News poll found that 46 percent of Americans are excited or optimistic about Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidency, about the percentage who voted for him. But 53 percent say they are concerned or scared. With the inauguration about a month away, a solid majority  \u2014   62 percent  \u2014   say the   will bring real change to the way Washington works. Whether that is a good thing or a bad thing probably depends on your party. Some 58 percent say they believe he will divide rather than unite people. The announcement on Thursday that David M. Friedman, Mr. Trump\u2019s bankruptcy lawyer, would be nominated to be the United States ambassador to Israel, is likely to roil an American Jewish community that sided overwhelmingly with Hillary Clinton and is already at sea in the wake of the 2016 election. Divisions remain among Jewish people over President Obama\u2019s policies, especially his nuclear deal with Iran. And Mr. Friedman is not likely to unify the community. Confronting the liberal Jewish group J Street, which largely opposes the policies of Israel\u2019s conservative prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, Mr. Friedman once leveled one of the worst insults possible to a Jew. He compared the group to kapos, the Jewish collaborators who enforced Nazi edict in the World War II concentration camps. \u201cAre J Street supporters really as bad as kapos? The answer, actually, is no. They are far worse than kapos  \u2014   Jews who turned in their fellow Jews in the Nazi death camps,\u201d Mr. Friedman said. J Street reacted almost immediately to news of Mr. Friedman\u2019s nomination, calling on the Senate to reject him. \u201cAs someone who has been a leading American friend of the settlement movement, who lacks any diplomatic or policy credentials and who has attacked liberal Jews who support two states as \u2018worse than kapos\u2019 Friedman should be beyond the pale for senators considering who should represent the United States in Israel,\u201d the group said in a statement. The Republican Jewish Coalition was all praise: A Trump economic adviser, Stephen Moore, caused quite a kerfuffle in Detroit on Thursday when in a fit of excitement, he announced that the economic commentator Larry Kudlow would be named chairman of Mr. Trump\u2019s White House Council of Economic Advisers. Mr. Kudlow, while certainly versed in economics, is not an economist. He has an undergraduate degree in history. The council chairman has traditionally been pulled from the highest echelons of academia to advise the president, not to lobby or persuade. Moreover, Mr. Kudlow is an ardent free trader and was openly critical of Mr. Trump\u2019s position on trade during the campaign, even as he enthusiastically backed the candidate. The announcement would have also come as a surprise to Peter Navarro, a   professor of economics at the Paul Merage School of Business at the University of California, Irvine. Professor Navarro is widely considered the   for the post, and his views on trade are more in line with the  \u2019s. After the Democrats sent out their reactions, and the news media came alive, Mr. Moore sheepishly admitted that, while he is pulling for his friend Mr. Kudlow, the deal is not done. \u201cLarry is the obvious choice, because he has all the connections with the key players on Capitol Hill, and there\u2019s nobody that can articulate the   conservative economic message better than Larry can,\u201d he said. But he admitted he had jumped the gun.'"}, "time": 1742562616.6361017}
