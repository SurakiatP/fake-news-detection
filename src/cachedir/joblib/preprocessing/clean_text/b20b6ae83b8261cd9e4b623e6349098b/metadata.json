During the first six months of 2016, Muslim migrants committed 142,500 crimes, according to the German Federal Criminal Police Office. Germany has been hit by a spate of horrendous violent crime including rapes, sexual and physical assaults, stabbings, home invasions, robberies, burglaries and drug trafficking. Adding to the country\u2019s woes is the fact that thousands of people have gone missing after travelling to the country on invitation from the country\u2019s leader. Germany took in more than 1.1 million Muslim migrants in the past year and parts of the country are crippled with a lack of infrastructure. Now the true reality is hitting home ahead of next year\u2019s elections as the far right surges in the polls threatening to topple the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) leader Mrs Merkel. According to a report by the international policy council the Gatestone Institute , local police in many parts of the country admit that they are stretched to the limit. The report states: \u201cThe rape of a ten-year-old girl in Leipzig, the largest city in Saxony, has drawn renewed attention to the spiraling levels of violent crime perpetrated by migrants in cities and towns across Germany. \u201cDuring the first six months of 2016, migrants committed 142,500 crimes, according to the Federal Criminal Police Office. This is equivalent to 780 crimes committed by migrants every day, an increase of nearly 40 per cent over 2015. The data includes only those crimes in which a suspect has been caught. \u201cThousands of Muslim migrants who entered the country as \u2018asylum seekers\u2019 or \u2018refugees\u2019 have gone missing. They are, presumably, economic migrants who entered Germany on false pretenses. \u201cMany are thought to be engaging in robbery and criminal violence.\u201d According to Freddi Lohse of the German Police Union in Hamburg, many migrant offenders view the leniency of the German justice system as a green light to continue delinquent behavior, says the report. He said: \u201cThey are used to tougher consequences in their home countries. \u201cThey have no respect for us.\u201d Meanwhile a female police officer has admitted that officers are under attack and that the courts are a \u201cjoke.\u201d In a new book, Tania Kambouri, a German police officer, said: \u201cFor weeks, months and years I have noticed that Muslims, mostly young men, do not have even a minimum level of respect for the police. \u201cWhen we are out patrolling the streets, we are verbally abused by young Muslims. source SHARE  '"}, "time": 1742563340.6336412}
