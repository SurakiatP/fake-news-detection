The top officials for the sport\u2019s global governing body are unlikely to be there cheering for her. Sharapova, who tested positive for meldonium this year after it was added to the list of banned substances, started a public attack on tennis\u2019s leaders after the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled on Tuesday that her   ban should be reduced to 15 months. Although the court did not clear her of a doping offense, she said she viewed the ruling as vindication, and she sharply criticized the International Tennis Federation for its handling of the case. \u201cI let everyone speak for a long time,\u201d Sharapova said in an interview Tuesday afternoon. \u201cI let everyone make assumptions and judge and say anything that they wanted to, and that\u2019s what makes the world go round. But at the end of the day, when this is all over, I knew that I would have the final say. \u201d Sharapova revealed in March that she had tested positive at the Australian Open for meldonium, a drug banned as of Jan. 1. Sharapova said at the time that she was unaware of the change in the drug\u2019s status, and she reiterated that assertion on Tuesday while faulting the tennis federation for the way it had communicated the change. Sharapova, whose handlers argued that the ban on meldonium was apparent only with a deep examination of links in emails, compared the federation\u2019s messaging to changing the traffic patterns at an intersection without a sign. \u201cThe I. T. F. didn\u2019t put up a \u2018No Left Turn,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cA sign wasn\u2019t even there it wasn\u2019t even behind a tree. It was complete false advertisement. It was like it was written on a   piece of paper, folded up and glued to a tree. \u201cIf there was a sign, I\u2019d have been, like, O. K. But through this process, there were no signs. And that was something that was obviously very evident in the C. A. S. report, that there were no signs. \u201d The federation declined an interview request Wednesday. The group\u2019s director of antidoping told the appeals court that he believed the group\u2019s notifications were \u201creasonable. \u201d Sharapova disputed that. \u201cThe delegation that the I. T. F. had with the WTA on checking what lists and emails were going out and who was actually receiving these notices  \u2014   was it players, agents, their doctors  \u2014   they had no system in place,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cThat\u2019s something that as I look to the future, I make it very clear that I don\u2019t want this to happen to anyone else. And I will be very much involved in making sure that it doesn\u2019t. \u201d Asked if the tennis federation had conceded any failure on its part, Sharapova scoffed. \u201cThey wanted to ban me for four years that was their way of conceding to me,\u201d she said, citing the maximum penalty she could have received from the federation at its initial June hearing, before her violation was ruled unintentional. \u201cI spent four days total in hearings listening to the head of the I. T. F. antidoping, Stuart Miller, giving two testimonies. I\u2019m sitting there just shaking my head on how so many athletes and tennis players are in the hands of someone in his position. I really couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cI was really shocked how little knowledge someone like him had, in his position. When he spoke about meldonium, he didn\u2019t know anything about it. It didn\u2019t strike him that it was so common that maybe more notice was appropriate for Eastern European athletes. \u201d When reached Wednesday morning, Miller declined to respond to Sharapova\u2019s remarks. The federation instead issued a statement. \u201cThe I. T. F. did not try to ban Ms. Sharapova for four years, as has been claimed,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe I. T. F. position was that it is the Independent Tribunal\u2019s responsibility to determine what the appropriate sanction should be. \u201cThere has been a suggestion that the I. T. F. should have given specific notice to Eastern European athletes about the use of meldonium because it was so common and widely known. In fact, it was accepted in the hearing by Ms. Sharapova that the I. T. F. did not know about the extent to which meldonium was used by athletes from any region, or that she was using it. \u201d Sharapova has said that she took meldonium for 10 years because of a magnesium deficiency, dizziness and a family history of diabetes. More than 300 athletes, mostly other Eastern Europeans, have tested positive for meldonium this year. \u201cThen it was a question of \u2018How is this banned when I knew it was legal, and for that amount of time? \u2019\u201d Sharapova said. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t fathom. And then I was like: \u2018How did this happen? Something that is so common  \u2014   are you sure? I mean, my grandparents take it, and millions of people in Russia.\u2019 In the beginning, I couldn\u2019t believe that. \u201d The appeals court did not conclude, as the I. T. F. had, that her initial use of meldonium had crossed a line into performance enhancement. Several other recent bans issued by the federation have also been overturned upon appeal. \u201cI think that makes you wonder, makes you think,\u201d Sharapova said of the federation\u2019s recent record in doping cases. \u201cSix bans in a row that have been overturned: You wonder, does the I. T. F. think about it? Is that on their mind? The tribunal that they choose, that they call neutral, by no means is it neutral at all. That part of it does not make any sense. \u201d Sharapova said she had entrusted her longtime agent, Max Eisenbud, with monitoring changes to the list of drugs banned by the World   Agency. In the tennis federation\u2019s inquiry, Eisenbud said his divorce had disrupted his normal   ritual of examining the list while on vacation the federation mocked his routine, asking, \u201cWhy it was necessary to take a file to the Caribbean to read by the pool?\u201d Sharapova said the experience had only made her relationship with Eisenbud stronger, but she also said she planned to have a doctor monitor antidoping concerns for her, including advising her on a permissible substitute for meldonium. While her case was being considered by the appeals court, Russian hackers penetrated WADA\u2019s athlete database and publicly revealed private medical information about international athletes. The hackers published documents showing that Serena Williams and others had received medical exemptions to use banned drugs. The hackers said the exemptions were proof of unfairness in antidoping protocols. Antidoping officials said that the athletes had legitimate medical reasons for using the drugs and had followed the rules. Of the athletes with medical exemptions whose records were published, about a quarter are American, although that group is not necessarily a representative sample of all international athletes. \u201cI think everyone knows how the system works, and that didn\u2019t show me anything except that players requested T. U. E.s and those were granted,\u201d Sharapova said, referring to   exemptions. \u201cThe only thing I took notice of was the difference in numbers from certain countries compared to others and the number of T. U. E.s that each country had. But as far as anything the athletes were doing, they didn\u2019t do anything wrong. \u201d Sharapova said she had kept herself occupied during her suspension with both physical challenges  \u2014   yoga, distance running, spinning classes  \u2014   and intellectual ones, like coursework at Harvard and a stint shadowing the N. B. A. \u2019s commissioner, Adam Silver. \u201cFrom one point of view, it gave me this reassurance that life without tennis, or after tennis, is fine  \u2014   and it\u2019s pretty freaking amazing, too,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d never known what weekends felt like. Weekends are pretty cool. In a time of so much uncertainty in my life, I actually felt like I was in control of my own schedule. \u201d She added: \u201cWhen you\u2019re constantly playing tennis, you wonder about when you\u2019re going to stop. In this time, I realized that I\u2019m in control of what I do. \u201d Retirement had seemed like an option for Sharapova, who has struggled with injuries throughout her career, including much of the last year she played. Sharapova, who won a Wimbledon title at 17, turns 30 in April, a week before she can return to competition. She acknowledged that the travel of tennis could be a grind, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t miss getting on a plane to Wuhan, you know what I mean?\u201d But she has no finish line in mind and wants to finish her career on her own terms, she said. She feels healthy and motivated. \u201cNo matter if I\u2019m in the middle of nowhere in Asia or walking into Arthur Ashe Stadium, it\u2019s the greatest feeling that I have,\u201d Sharapova said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I miss. I miss walking out onto my stage because that\u2019s been my stage since I was a young girl. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564048.6497324}
