[Riley, who rose to fame in the 2007 remake of St. Trinians, criticized Watson\u2019s brand of feminism in conversation with The Daily Mail.  \u201cMen and women should have equal rights, of course, but [they] are also different and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to start unifying gender in order to establish political equality. \u201d The actress, who is twice divorced from the   business magnate Elon Musk, then took aim at Watson\u2019s HeForShe campaign, claiming it promotes the idea of both genders being the same. \u201cThe HeForShe campaign creates a lot of confusion when it comes to gender equality, because people are getting stuck in a semantic argument, rather than addressing the actual issue. People are associating gender equality with being exactly the same and, of course, that\u2019s not what it means,\u201d she continued. The campaign, which was launched by Watson in 2014 following her speech on gender equality at the United Nations, seeks to eliminate gender equality by involving men in the feminist movement. Last week, Watson praised MTV for scrapping the channel\u2019s yearly \u2018Best Actress\u2019 award in favor of a gender \u201c \u201d honor, describing it as \u201cthe first acting award in history that doesn\u2019t separate nominees based on their sex. \u201d In March, Watson hit back at critics accusing her of promoting the objectification of women after she posed for a racy photo shoot in lifestyle magazine Vanity Fair. \u201cFeminism is about giving women choice. Feminism is not a stick with which to beat other women with,\u201d Watson told Reuters. \u201cIt\u2019s about freedom. It\u2019s about liberation. It\u2019s about equality. I really don\u2019t know what my t*ts have to do with it. It\u2019s very confusing. I\u2019m confused. Most people are confused. \u201d   You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart. com'"}, "time": 1742564495.6375926}
