Syrian War Report \u2013 November 3, 2016: Egyptian Officers Arrive in Syria By South Front on November 3, 2016 \u2026from SouthFront \\nOver 2,500 militants have been killed and wounded in western Aleppo since the start of Al-Nusra-led attempt to break the government forces\u2019 defenses in the area on October 28, according to sources in the Syrian military. Considering that the total striking force deployed by Jaish al-Fatah coalition for the operation was about 5,000 fighters, it\u2019s clear why the militant coalition failed to achieve its military goals. \\nAn infighting allegedly started between Harakat Nour al-Din al-Zenki and Fastaqim Kama Umirt militant groupsin Salaheddine and Al-Ansari Mashhad areas in Aleppo city on November 2. Nour al-Din al-Zenki stormed Fastaqim Kama Umirt checkpoints and arrested dozens of Fastaqim Kama fighters including their commander \u2018Istakem kma Oumrt\u2019. At least 1 militant was reported dead and 25 injured as result of the clashes. The conflict among \u2018moderate rebels\u2019 reportedly appeared because Fastaqim Kama Umirt was considering a possibility to leave Aleppo through corridors set up by the Syrian and Russian military. \\nThe Russian general staff has announced that President Vladimir Putin had ordered a humanitarian pause in Aleppo from 9am to 7pm on November 4. \\n\u201cConsidering that our American colleagues were unable to separate the opposition from terrorists, we are addressing all militant leaders directly, urging them to cease hostilities and leave Aleppo with their arms,\u201d General Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the Russian General Staff said, adding that \u201cTwo corridors will be opened, from which Syrian troops and weapons would be pulled back.\u201d Six additional corridors will be opened for civilians. \\nA group of Egyptian officers allegedly arrived in Syria on November 1 in order to learn from Russian military advisers that are embedded with government troops at the battle against terrorists across the country. The development took place amid the ongoing expansion of military cooperation between Russia and Egypt. In October 2016, Russian airborne troops arrived Egypt to participate in a joint military drill with the host country. The drill was codenamed \u201cDefenders of Friendship 2016\u201d.
