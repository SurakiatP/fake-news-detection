I\u2019ve got a consulting company with a handful of clients  \u2014   a couple of nonprofits, a universe of businesses and executives whose instincts are good. Sometimes they just want to kibitz. During the week of the Democratic National Convention, you appeared on both Stephen Colbert\u2019s and Bill Maher\u2019s shows. What\u2019s your current philosophy on media exposure? I\u2019m more experiential. When you do media as an elected official or as a candidate, you have a very clear message that you\u2019re trying to impart and an idea of who you\u2019re talking to. Now I don\u2019t have all that. It\u2019s more just to say what I think. You\u2019re an unusual public figure in that you are known as a former member of Congress and candidate for mayor  \u2014   and now you\u2019re a guy who had an embarrassing sex scandal featured in a recent documentary. Do people approach you differently? The interactions I have with people have gotten clouded lately because of the movie. The movie seems very much to be a Rorschach test of what people thought about the thing itself. Some people approach me, and they\u2019re like, \u201cOh, you got a raw deal. \u201d Some people approach me saying, \u201cOh, man, I wish you hadn\u2019t messed up. \u201d Some people approach me and say, \u201cMan, you are such an idiot. \u201d Have you or your wife, Huma Abedin, seen it? No. Do you regret giving access to the filmmakers? Obviously, when I agreed to do the movie, I anticipated a different outcome. Does anything hurt your feelings anymore or are you kind of immunized by what you\u2019ve been through? To some degree, the same thing that made me successful and that allowed me to survive stuff is that my emotional wiring isn\u2019t fully connected. I have a very thick skin. Without going down a rabbit hole here, you could argue that some of my emotional wiring wasn\u2019t working terribly well. That is how I can survive having 40 cameras outside my house. Are you still engaging in the activities that got you in trouble? I\u2019m not going to go down the path of talking about any of that. But I will say this: There\u2019s no doubt that the Trump phenomenon has led a lot of people to say to me, \u201cBoy, compared to inviting the Russians to come hack someone\u2019s email, your thing seems almost quaint. \u201d I would think a great number of your former Republican colleagues in Congress must have some regrets about what\u2019s really going on in their party, but most of them can\u2019t say anything. Do you think that might change now that the conventions are behind us? No. The reason they don\u2019t say anything is because they think it fractures their base. But I\u2019m far enough away from this that I doubt my judgment. Recently, you said that if Donald Trump Jr. ran for mayor of New York, you might run yourself, just so you could beat him \u201clike a rented mule. \u201d I never understood that expression. Why would a rented mule get beaten worse than a regular mule? I don\u2019t know. I grew up listening to Don Imus, who would use that expression all the time. It\u2019s colorful. Do you miss politics? I always had this philosophy when I was an elected official that I shouldn\u2019t be a pundit, but now I\u2019m called upon to be one every once in a while. Notwithstanding the flames I went down in, I\u2019m pretty good at this stuff. Have you thought about running campaigns or being a political consultant? Almost weekly, some candidate will call and ask for advice. I\u2019ve weirdly become a little bit of an elder statesman. Shouldn\u2019t you get paid for it then? No, I don\u2019t want to make a life out of it. Also, no one would want me. Why not? Would you really want the distraction of having me as your campaign manager?'"}, "time": 1742563429.2479181}
