The mobile game has also attracted concerns about just how vulnerable our personal data can be in the hands of seemingly benign applications. In the last few days, security bloggers noticed that the game, which is free to download and made by Niantic Inc. in partnership with the Pok\u00e9mon Company and Nintendo, requested permission not only to use a player\u2019s smartphone camera and location data but also to gain full access to the user\u2019s Google accounts  \u2014   including email, calendars, photos, stored documents and any other data associated with the login. Critics quickly called the game a \u201chuge security risk\u201d that was invading people\u2019s privacy, and Senator Al Franken, a Democrat, on Tuesday expressed concerns about the issue. Niantic has said the expansive permission requests were \u201cerroneous\u201d and that Pok\u00e9mon Go did not use anything from players\u2019 accounts other than basic Google profile information. Niantic also said it was working on a fix to change the permissions to a level that would be \u201cin line with the data that we actually access. \u201d The flap highlights how clicking \u201cyes\u201d to whatever requests pop up when installing an app on a mobile device can compromise privacy, sometimes in insidious ways. In disclosures, some apps say they will hand over data to law enforcement officials or other private parties to respond to legal requests, for example, or even on their own volition. \u201cA number of these games are not only making money on the front end by selling you the game or things within the game, they\u2019re also collecting data about your habits and what you\u2019re doing on your phone, and selling that to   marketers,\u201d said Andrew Storms, vice president of security services at the security company New Context. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty much giving the rights to all your information to this company. \u201d So what can be done to minimize the security risks that come with some apps? Here\u2019s a refresher on how to safeguard private information. Ari Rubinstein, a Silicon Valley security engineer, recommends paying close attention to the scope of access that apps request during installation  \u2014   or to look up the details online  \u2014   and say \u201cno\u201d if the demands make you uncomfortable. If you are unsure about the permissions you have already granted, check them on iOS by clicking on Settings and scrolling down for a list of apps that you can examine and change individually. On Android, click Settings and click Apps under the Device Settings, then choose an app and select Permissions. Permissions are not the only things to worry about you also need to know what kinds of data an app is collecting from your phone. Information about those is typically contained in an app\u2019s privacy policies, which are often available within the settings of an app, or searchable online. If you cannot find the disclosures, or you are unable to understand their legalese, consider holding off until you learn more. As for Pok\u00e9mon Go, while the game may not be digging through emails, it is capable of tracking your location. And like those of many apps, its privacy policy allows it to give any data it has about you to law enforcement officials or private parties in response to legal requests or even to whatever it may deem an unethical or legally actionable activity. It can also share nonidentifying information about you with other companies for what it says are \u201cresearch and analysis, demographic profiling, and other similar purposes. \u201d Because apps often use platforms like Facebook and Google to authenticate accounts, Mr. Rubinstein suggests regularly checking the access you have granted through the settings of these systems. With Facebook, go to your account settings and click on Apps to examine and revoke access. With Google, go to Privacy and Security Settings and click on Connected Apps and Sites to see or change the apps connected to your account. \u201cMost likely users have apps that they never use that put them at a similar risk\u201d to that from the Pok\u00e9mon app, he said.'"}, "time": 1742628445.5765884}
