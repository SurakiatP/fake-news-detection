The South Korean company on Wednesday introduced the Galaxy S8, its first major smartphone release since the scandal over its Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, which were discontinued last year after some of the devices spontaneously caught fire. \u201cIt\u2019s been a challenging year for Samsung,\u201d said D. J. Koh, the company\u2019s head of mobile devices, adding that Samsung was ready to start anew. The Galaxy S8 features a large 5.  screen without adding bulk to the device. The company said it made room for the screen by reducing the size of the bezel  \u2014   or the forehead and the chin  \u2014   on the face of the device. Samsung also made the home button into a virtual button and shoved it under the display. With the Galaxy S8, Samsung also rolled out its virtual assistant, Bixby, to rival Apple\u2019s Siri, Google\u2019s Assistant and Amazon\u2019s Alexa. Similar to previous virtual assistants, Bixby responds to voice commands. Time  \u2014   and sales  \u2014   will tell whether the Galaxy S8 will restore confidence in Samsung\u2019s smartphones. Last year, after the company received dozens of complaints about the Galaxy Note 7 overheating, and in some cases exploding, the company recalled the phones. But replacement phones continued to catch fire, and the company had to recall the devices a second time before killing the product altogether, sacrificing billions of dollars in revenue. The Galaxy Note 7 may still make a reappearance. On Monday, Samsung said that it might sell refurbished versions of the phone. Jan Dawson, an independent analyst for Jackdaw Research, said the Galaxy S8 could help Samsung recover as long as the product worked reliably. \u201cNote 7 definitely did some damage to the Samsung brand, especially for people who had little or no personal experience with Samsung devices,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as long as the S8 does well and doesn\u2019t suffer from any of the same problems, the memories of the Note 7 issues will fade and Samsung will recover well.\u201d Samsung last year also issued a separate recall for 2. 8 million washing machines in the United States. The machines were prone to detaching from the washing machine chassis, posing a risk of injury. The Galaxy S8 will arrive in stores next month with a starting price of $750.'"}, "time": 1742561627.9317698}
