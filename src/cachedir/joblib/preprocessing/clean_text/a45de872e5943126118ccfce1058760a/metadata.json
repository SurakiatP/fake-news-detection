Mr. McConnell, a Kentucky Republican and the majority leader, says he and his Senate Republican colleagues are quite satisfied with the Trump team so far. In fact, he said, they are reassured by signs that President Trump is going to hew to a conservative agenda after early fears that the president  \u2014   a relatively unknown quantity to most elected Republicans  \u2014   might not really be one of them. \u201cThe country doesn\u2019t need saving,\u201d Mr. McConnell said when asked during an interview in his Capitol office if there was any cause for a   congressional intervention given early chaos in the evolving West Wing. \u201cI think there is a high level of satisfaction with the new administration,\u201d he said, dismissing concerns about dissonant eruptions from the new president and some of his top staff members. \u201cOur members are not obsessed with the daily tweets, but are looking at the results. \u201d He added: \u201cNo matter what sort of theatrics that go on around the administration, if you look at the decisions that are being made, they are solid  \u2014   from our perspective  \u2014      things that we would have hoped a new Republican president would have done. \u201d Mr. McConnell has broken with the president on a few subjects, taking a much harder line against President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia than Mr. Trump has and objecting to some of the president\u2019s \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d initiatives, including a proposal for congressional term limits. Other members of the Republican establishment  \u2014   inside and outside Congress  \u2014   have expressed growing alarm about the conduct and competence of the White House. But Mr. McConnell, whose wife, Elaine Chao, was named by Mr. Trump as secretary of transportation, said things might even be turning out better than anticipated. \u201cBack during the campaign, there were a lot of questions: Is Trump really a conservative? A lot of questions about it,\u201d Mr. McConnell recalled. \u201cBut if you look at the steps that have been taken so far, looks good to me. \u201cIt is the kind of thing we would have expected of one of the others, had they been nominated and elected,\u201d Mr. McConnell said, referring to Republican presidential candidates defeated by Mr. Trump who had more conventional political and government backgrounds. Mr. McConnell\u2019s view clashes violently with that of Senate Democrats and their allies around the country. They have viewed the beginning of the Trump era as a disaster best exemplified by an immigration executive order they decry as unconstitutional and   as well as a selection of cabinet choices they rate as unqualified and carrying the very same baggage that has prevented others from being confirmed in the past. Even some Republicans have criticized as inept and amateurish the rollout of the immigration order, which is now at the center of a federal court fight. Others have expressed trepidation at the prospect of being hammered in a Trump tweet if they run afoul of the new president. Mr. McConnell, who is known for being able to take the temperature of his colleagues and to act accordingly, said he sensed no real unease about Mr. Trump on the Republican side of the aisle. \u201cWe have had very good unity on our side,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cPeople are genuinely excited about taking the country in another direction. I don\u2019t find any decision that he has made surprising. \u201d He said Senate Republicans had been enthusiastic about Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet nominees, dazzled by his Supreme Court pick and elated at the chance to roll back what he called the regulatory rampage of the Obama administration. \u201cA lot of us were wondering, what is Trump really going to be like?\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cHe used to support Democrats and have various views earlier in his life about politics. But when he got to the point of actually having the office and making the decisions, I think the decisions have been very comforting to my members, most of whom are a little bit right of center and further right of center. \u201d It goes without saying that having Mr. Trump in the White House gives House and Senate Republicans the opportunity to pursue an aggressive legislative agenda if they can find common ground. That prospect should be heightened by installing colleagues like Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama and two fellow Republicans, Representatives Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina and Tom Price of Georgia, at the highest levels of the administration. Mr. Sessions is Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general while Mr. Mulvaney has been tapped to run the White House Office of Management and Budget and Mr. Price to head the Department of Health and Human Services. Mr. McConnell looms as potentially the president\u2019s most important ally in Congress because success in the Senate is central to any legislative victory. But Republicans have not even started on the legislative end of the new Congress. Now their job is going to be made more difficult by the increasingly hard line that Democrats are taking against Mr. Trump by opposing his cabinet nominees en masse. Mr. McConnell\u2019s frustration at Democratic tactics boiled over Tuesday evening when he invoked a rarely used Senate rule to force Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, to end a speech on the grounds she was impugning the integrity of Mr. Sessions, a fellow senator, by criticizing his record on civil rights. \u201cIt is a superficially poisonous atmosphere, not a fundamentally poisonous atmosphere,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. Still, he noted that Republicans could do much of their preliminary work in the Senate just by relying on their party\u2019s 51 votes there as they take up health care, tax changes and nominations, and could try to work out the differences with Democrats later. \u201cSooner or later we will get around to things that will require some level of cooperation,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cHopefully there will be a kind of dysfunction fatigue. I think it will set in way before then. \u201d His point raises a question: Will that same passage of time produce a kind of Trump fatigue among the   congressional Republicans?'"}, "time": 1742564511.516659}
