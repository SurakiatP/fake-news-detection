This whole milieu is nauseating. I grew tired of it, so I made the account.\u201d \\nBelow is a small sample of Rectenwald\\'s tweets: The identity politics left: they need a safe space that is at once a hall of mirrors and a rubber room. \\n\u2014 Deplorable NYU Prof (@antipcnyuprof) October 11, 2016 What if Trump triggers a few hundred thousand liberal totalitarians to jump out of their dorm windows? one can only hope. #TriggerWarning \\n\u2014 Deplorable NYU Prof (@antipcnyuprof) September 27, 2016 OK, academia has officially gone completely ape shit. This is merely mental illness posing as \"politics\": https://t.co/1K1l7wSvom \\n\u2014 Deplorable NYU Prof (@antipcnyuprof) September 27, 2016 I\\'m a NYU prof who\\'s seen academe become a sham bc of identity pol & liberal totalitarianism. I\\'ll tell all soon. https://t.co/7Tyulse0a7 \\n\u2014 Deplorable NYU Prof (@antipcnyuprof) September 16, 2016 I\\'m a real full-time NYU prof who has inside stories that will blow yr mind. When I reach 500 followers the flood gates open. Pls help. Thx. \\n\u2014 Deplorable NYU Prof (@antipcnyuprof) September 15, 2016 . @kercard @TrumpetingTrump Yes, there are 1.5 administrators for every professor at NYU -gotta\\' monitor everyone for possible \\'bias\\' issues! \\n\u2014 Deplorable NYU Prof (@antipcnyuprof) September 13, 2016 \\n\\nIt wasn\\'t long before Rectenwald\\'s tweet storm drew the attention of NYU\\'s student newspaper, the Washington Square Times, which reached out to him over twitter for an interview. Unfortunately, that interview, which was published last week , proved to be his undoing. Within 2 days of his identity being revealed publicly, NYU\\'s \" Liberal Studies Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Working Group \" had published a letter in the same newspaper finding Rectenwald \"guilty of illogic and incivility.\" Later in that same day Rectenwald was forced to go on paid leave by administrators who claimed that \"a couple people had expressed concern about his mental health.\" \\nBut Rectenwald says he began getting \u201cdirty looks\u201d in his department and on Wednesday figured out why: A 12-person committee calling itself the Liberal Studies Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Working Group , including two deans, published a letter to the editor in the same paper. \\n\\n\u201cAs long as he airs his views with so little appeal to evidence and civility, we must find him guilty of illogic and incivility in a community that predicates its work in great part on rational thought and the civil exchange of ideas,\u201d they wrote. \\n\\n\u201cWe seek to create a dynamic community that values full participation. Such efforts are not the \u2018destruction of academic integrity\u2019 Professor Rectenwald suggests, but rather what make possible our program\u2019s approach to global studies,\u201d they argued. \\n\\nRectenwald likened the attack to \u201ca Salem witch trial. They took my views personally. I never even mentioned them and I never even said NYU liberal studies program. I was talking about academia at large.\u201d \\n\\nThe same day that letter was published, Rectenwald was summoned to a meeting with his department dean and an HR representative, he says. \\n\\n\u201cThey claimed they were worried about me and a couple people had expressed concern about my mental health,\u201d Rectenwald told The Post. \\n\\nThe leave has \u201cabsolutely zero to do with his Twitter account or his opinions on issues of the day,\u201d said NYU spokesman Matt Nagel, refusing to elaborate on the reason. \\n\\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid my academic career is over,\u201d he said. \u201cAcademic freedom: It\u2019s great, as long as you don\u2019t use it.\u201d \\nIs it any wonder that the liberal elite continues to run amok at our establishments of higher learning... anyone who dares express a non-conforming opinion is promptly found \"guilty of illogic and incivility\" and declared mentally incompetent.
