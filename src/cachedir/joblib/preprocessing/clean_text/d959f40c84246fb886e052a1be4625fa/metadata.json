[\u201cLet\u2019s heat up Tej\u2019s mic,\u201d said Alex Marlow introducing Gill, \u201cWe\u2019ve got Tej Gill here in the studio who\u2019s been running security for MILO\u2019s tour, which is easier said than done. He\u2019s a Navy SEAL, you\u2019ve heard him on the show a few times talking about various issues with Steve Bannon back in the day. Tej I wanna get your thoughts on all this and what kind of environment does this create for someone like you who makes his living in security, when you\u2019ve got your client being called all of these horrific names, saying he\u2019s literally orchestrating a hoax so his own followers get harassed and attacked, get bloodied, get beaten at his own events. \u201d  Tej replied, \u201cit creates a dangerous environment. The only thing that this guy [Berkeley Professor Robert Reich] said that\u2019s correct is that these guys were not students, the guys in the black, they\u2019re anarchists from out of town. They\u2019re the same people that shut down UC Davis, they\u2019re the same people that created chaos at University of Washington in Seattle. \u201d \u201cAnd the inauguration, they have the same garb,\u201d interjected Marlow, \u201cExactly, they look like ISIS when they march in. They\u2019re organised, well funded, I wouldn\u2019t go as far to say well equipped but I was standing up top with the police when these guys marched in and we\u2019re getting reports that anarchist are 4 blocks away, 3 blocks away, 2 blocks away, they\u2019ve got bats, they\u2019ve got weapons. They actually had shields with them, every other one had a shield that was about 3 foot by 6 foot covered in back trash bags, I don\u2019t know what it was made out of. But they walked into the campus, single file like a military unit, cut straight through the crowd about one row of people back behind the barriers and the surrounded the building. \u201d \u201cAt that time I thought they were gonna lock arms,\u201d Tej continued, \u201cthat\u2019s a tactic they used at University of Washington, Seattle, they did the exact same thing they just cut straight through the crowd and they locked arms. But they didn\u2019t do that, that\u2019s when they started firing fireworks, throwing eggs and that\u2019s when they started pulling apart the barriers and they tipped over that light stand that had a diesel generator in it, that\u2019s what caused the fire and lit the tree on fire. And the police effectively did nothing, nothing while we were there. \u201d \u201cI think the fact that there were no arrests,\u201d said Marlow, \u201cat the violent protests at UC Berkeley that shut down speech, that prevented your event from going forward and really broke the heart of a lot of fans as well, lets not underestimate that as well, people are entitled to have performers that they enjoy and go see them, it was a very unfortunate upsetting event and no on got arrested which to me sends a signal that this can go on over and over and it just is gonna embolden the left and Tej as a security expert what are your thoughts on that?\u201d \u201cIt just fuels the fire,\u201d replied Tej, \u201cthe no arrest thing, hands off policy, every time they do this and they do it successfully with no arrest, no trouble, there\u2019s no consequences and if there\u2019s no consequences why stop? Each time they\u2019re gonna get stronger and stronger. \u201d \u201cSo how do we deal with this? What is the recourse that we have in order to try to start stemming this really rising movement of totalitarianism from the left?\u201d asked Marlow. \u201cIt\u2019s simple, enforce the law. That\u2019s it. Just enforce the law. When we go to the conservative campuses the police departments there are amazing, the shows go off without a hitch, they\u2019re orderly, they give the protesters room to protest and they give the MILO supporters room to support MILO then they keep everybody separated. Liberal campuses have effectively emasculated the police forces there. They\u2019ve totally been politicised, they don\u2019t let them do their job, they actually have a hands off and no arrests policy, one of the guys at Berkeley told me this. \u201d said Tej, \u201cA no arrest policy? It is a policy that they can\u2019t arrest anyone? And is this only for the left, if this was a right wing event of course there would be arrests\u201d replied Marlow, \u201cyes, of course\u201d confirmed Tej, \u201cImagine if the politics had been reversed last night, if it had been Trump supporters causing a fuss outside a Lena Dunham speech,\u201d said MILO, \u201cwould there be a single front page that wasn\u2019t holding it today, would CNN be covering anything else? And it\u2019s interesting that you mention about the difference between the conservative and liberal campuses, well you\u2019ve hit upon something there and it\u2019s that it doesn\u2019t need to be this way and it\u2019s this way because of politics. And if I hadn\u2019t been on the frontline of this stuff I\u2019d consider myself a conspiracy theorist but I can tell you from the way that we have observed, my tour manager and my security teams, have observed local police departments, elected officials and university administrators effectively colluding to sabotage these events. Deciding on policing strategies that almost guarantee the events will not proceed or something awful will happen outside, these people are responsible for the violence that happened outside UW Seattle, these people are responsible for the cancellation of UC Davis, these people are responsible for what happened most spectacularly, in a technical sense, in Berkeley. \u201d MILO continued, \u201cBecause what they\u2019re doing is insisting that the police follow procedures that almost guarantee there will be violence and guarantee the event will not proceed, that is direct violation of their first amendment commitment. \u201d Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6AM to 9AM Eastern.
