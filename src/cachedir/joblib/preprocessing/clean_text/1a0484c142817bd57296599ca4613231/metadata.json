[Politico reports it was April 5, 2008, when Obama spoke to Democrat Party donors in San Francisco, saying:  You go into these small towns in Pennsylvania and, like a lot of small towns in the Midwest, the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothing\u2019s replaced them. And they fell through the Clinton administration, and the Bush administration, and each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are gonna regenerate and they have not. And it\u2019s not surprising then they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who aren\u2019t like them or   sentiment or   sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations. On January 5, 2017, he wrote in the Harvard Law Review: But as I\u2019ve said many times: \u201c[O]ur thoughts and prayers are not enough. \u201d They alone won\u2019t \u201ccapture the heartache and grief and anger we should feel,\u201d and they do \u201cnothing to prevent this carnage from being inflicted someplace else in America. \u201d We have a responsibility to act. Obama went on to make clear that his emphasis on acting \u2014  on doing something \u2014  was an emphasis on passing more gun control: Congress should pass the kinds of commonsense reforms supported by most of the American people \u2014  from investing in access to mental health care, to expanding background checks, to making it possible to keep guns out of the hands of suspected terrorists. The actions we take won\u2019t prevent every act of violence \u2014  but if even one life is spared, they will have been well worth it. He did not mention that the United States already has background checks, and such checks have proven to be mass attackers\u2019 method of choice for acquiring firearms. Nor did he mention that all the hype about using   lists to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists is just that: hype. After all, the San Bernardino attackers, the Orlando Pulse attacker, and the recent Ft. Lauderdale airport attacker were not on any such list. Obama and Democrats\u2019 methods, therefore, are not measures that will stop crime or make Americans safer.
