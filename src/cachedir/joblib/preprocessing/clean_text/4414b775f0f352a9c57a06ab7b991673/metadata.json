What better way, then, to celebrate the Fourth in this space than to quote that great Philadelphian Benjamin Franklin, an editor and signer of the Declaration of Independence and a founding father of the independent American press? There\u2019s one Franklin statement in particular that has a special resonance right now, something he wrote in his Pennsylvania Gazette: \u201cIt is a principle among printers that when truth has fair play, it will always prevail over falsehood. \u201d The operative phrase is \u201cwhen truth has fair play. \u201d Now, think about the last year in global and American politics. Then ask yourself, \u201cDoes it?\u201d I can make a pretty strong argument for \u201cdoes not. \u201d Exhibit A comes by way of CNN, which waded into new territory a few days ago by hiring Corey Lewandowski, Donald J. Trump\u2019s recently fired campaign manager, as an   commentator. Reporters and media critics have devoted a lot of ink and pixels to Mr. Lewandowski\u2019s hiring. How could the network enlist someone who had been arrested for roughly pulling Michelle Fields, the former Breitbart News reporter, away from Mr. Trump as she tried to interview him at a public event? (Prosecutors in Florida dropped the charges, but they did not dispute the incident.) What kind of message was CNN sending by hiring a political operative associated with some of the most aggressive   behavior in modern political history, an enforcer of the Trump campaign\u2019s media blacklist? But the true journalistic heart stopper was contained in the news that Mr. Lewandowski was bound by what even Mr. Lewandowski described as a \u201cstrict confidentiality agreement. \u201d Neither CNN nor Mr. Lewandowski has provided details about its stipulations (though they should). But The Associated Press unearthed a standard Trump nondisclosure form that prohibits staff from disclosing anything \u201cof a private, proprietary or confidential nature. \u201d And who gets to decide what should be private and confidential? Mr. Trump, of course. The agreement also includes a   clause. And it applies during employment with Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and \u201cat all times thereafter,\u201d which is another way of saying \u201cforever. \u201d It won\u2019t smash the republic. Still, in a small but significant way, Mr. Lewandowski\u2019s hiring represents a signal moment in political journalism\u2019s evolving embrace of political operatives: A major mainstream news organization is using a commentator who is legally prohibited from sharing the unvarnished truth on the subject  \u2014   Mr. Trump  \u2014   he was hired to talk about. Some of the media criticism that followed Mr. Lewandowski\u2019s hiring questioned the ruckus around it, given that television news already has its share of conflicted pundits tied to \u201csuper PACs\u201d or clients with business at stake in the political debate. CNN\u2019s thinking apparently holds that Mr. Lewandowski provides   balance for the network at a time when many of its regular Republican analysts are Trump detractors. In that case, they could ask, how does a nondisclosure agreement get in the way of Mr. Lewandowski\u2019s role as a Trump booster? After all, as Paul Farhi of The Washington Post captured so comprehensively last month, all of the television news networks  \u2014   hardly just CNN  \u2014   hire commentators who play specific roles on their panels: \u201c\u201d \u201c\u201d Democrat, Republican centrist, rightist, leftist. In presidential election cycles, such   rates well in the Nielsen numbers. But, going back to my fellow Philadelphian, wise old Ben: What happens to the balance between truth and falsehood when an important portion of the national news media hands the political debate over to partisan operatives who, as a rule, skew the facts  \u2014   or abandon them  \u2014   in the service of their own political ends or business interests? There\u2019s a glaring cautionary answer to be found across the pond, in Britain, where the media is avowedly more partisan, especially in the tabloid newspapers that continue to hold great sway. In the   to the startling vote there to leave the European Union, and for many years before, the larger and more conservative newspapers ran aggressive campaigns pushing for what became known as Brexit. One of the biggest proponents of the exit was former Mayor Boris Johnson of London, who was, after all, a onetime reporter for The Times of London and The Daily Telegraph, where he still writes a column. (He was fired from The Times for fabricating a quote.) As Martin Fletcher, a former associate editor of The Times of London, wrote last week in The New York Times, Mr. Johnson made his name as a journalist writing about the plans of bureaucrats in the European Union to \u201cban Britain\u2019s favorite potato chips\u201d and \u201cstandardize condom sizes. \u201d The articles, Mr. Fletcher wrote, \u201cbore scant relation to the truth,\u201d but they helped spawn an   Union movement in British journalism just the same. As the vote approached,   newspapers  \u2014   including The Sun, The Daily Mail, The Express and The Telegraph  \u2014   wrote stories that exaggerated how many immigrants were coming to Britain because of its E. U. membership and their effects on social services, reported that Queen Elizabeth II was secretly   and quoted claims from   politicians that Britain was sending 350 million pounds ($464 million) a week to the European Union that could be used instead to shore up the National Health Service. The Independent Press Standards Organization in Britain issued several rulings for inaccuracy  \u2014   including one for the headline \u201cQueen Backs Brexit,\u201d which ran in The Sun. But the partisan press climate meant all facts were up for debate. Nothing could stand out as Platonic truth. After the vote passed, Nigel Farage, a leading Brexit campaigner, said the Vote Leave campaign had been mistaken in saying the savings from the \u00a3350 million that supposedly went to the E. U.  \u2014   itself misleading  \u2014   could be used for the health service. That was followed by various expressions of regret by some   voters who now believe they were misled. \u201cThe context for the referendum vote was a public which had been poorly\u201d informed, \u201cif not misinformed about the issue,\u201d the former Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger told me. The media in the United States is not quite where Britain\u2019s is in terms of partisanship, though it seems to inch closer every year. And cable news is not the sole driver of political knowledge. But it can be the center ring for political discourse, especially in prime time. What happens there can drive a major campaign theme for the following day or longer. In the case of Mr. Trump\u2019s surrogates, they regularly go on television to push the point of the day from a candidate who, according to the   organization PolitiFact, has asserted more outright falsehoods than all the other candidates who ran for president this year combined. PolitiFact rated 60 percent of Mr. Trump\u2019s statements as false, compared with 13 percent of Hillary Clinton\u2019s. Jeffrey Lord, a Trump supporter and a commentator on CNN, told the CNN host Brian Stelter that such   analyses were an \u201celitist,   thing. \u201d But the amount of falsity on cable news nonetheless requires a lot of    declarations of \u201cthat\u2019s nonsense\u201d in a medium that doesn\u2019t provide a lot of room for it. Mr. Lewandowski has frequently wandered past the bounds of truth, including when he said he never touched Ms. Fields. Videotape showed the opposite. To its credit, CNN does have a crew of aggressive anchors like Jake Tapper, Alisyn Camerota and Erin Burnett, all of whom have pushed Mr. Lewandowski for as unvarnished a view of Mr. Trump as he could offer. Mr. Lewandowski told Ms. Burnett he\u2019d call \u201cballs and strikes\u201d in spite of his agreement with Mr. Trump. But when he weighed in on Mr. Trump\u2019s big economic speech last Tuesday, all he saw was a home run (\u201cMr. Trump\u2019s best speech of the presidential cycle,\u201d he gushed). Mr. Franklin was all for providing a multitude of voices through his press. \u201cWhen men differ in opinion, both sides ought to equally have the advantage of being heard by the publick,\u201d he wrote in his \u201cApology for Printers. \u201d In a twist on the quote I used above, he added, \u201cWhen truth and error have fair play, the former is always an overmatch for the latter. \u201d Let\u2019s give it a try.'"}, "time": 1742562971.133616}
