Here are key moments from today: \u25a0 Representative Tom Price of Georgia, nominated to be health and human services secretary, defended his investments in an Australian pharmaceutical company during his time in Congress. \u201cThe reality is that everything that I did was ethical, above board, legal and transparent,\u201d he said. \u25a0 Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, lamented \u201cthe   of the nomination process. \u201d \u25a0 Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, the nominee for budget director, said that tackling government waste and reducing debt would be his top priorities. \u25a0 The toughest questions that Mr. Mulvaney faced on Tuesday came from Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. He asked Mr. Mulvaney about his record of voting for cuts to military spending and appeared to be shocked when Mr. Mulvaney could not remember those votes. \u25a0 Linda E. McMahon, the former chief executive of World Wrestling Entertainment and Mr. Trump\u2019s choice to lead the Small Business Administration, said her entrepreneurial background suited her for the job. \u25a0 Ms. McMahon assured senators that she would be a vigilant opponent of restrictive government regulations. A background investigation of Mr. Price says he understated the value of his investments in an Australian pharmaceutical company, Innate Immunotherapeutics, and claimed income tax deductions that he could not substantiate. The findings emerged from a review of Mr. Price\u2019s tax returns and other official documents by committee staff members from both parties. In a questionnaire in December, the committee staff said, Mr. Price understated the value of 400, 613 shares of the Australian company that he purchased in August 2016 through \u201ca private placement offering. \u201d The value of the shares was listed on the questionnaire as $50, 000 to $100, 000, but that reflected the purchase price, the staff reported. At the request of the committee, Mr. Price recalculated the value of his holdings to reflect their market price. The revised value was $100, 000 to $250, 000. In addition, the committee staff said, Mr. Price \u201ctook improper deductions on his 2016 tax returns\u201d for the depreciation of land associated with condominiums that he owns in Washington and Nashville. Moreover, the staff said, Mr. Price and his wife, both physicians, claimed \u201cmiscellaneous employment deductions totaling $19, 034\u201d for various expenses in 2013, 2014 and 2015. Neither Mr. Price nor his wife work as a physician, the staff report said, and \u201cproper documentation could not be located,\u201d so Mr. Price\u2019s tax returns will be amended to remove the $19, 034 in deductions. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, questioned Mr. Price over his trades of health care stocks during his time in Congress. \u201cIt is hard to see this as anything but a conflict of interest and an abuse of position,\u201d Mr. Wyden said. In particular, Mr. Wyden pressed Mr. Price over his investments in Innate Immunotherapeutics, which the senator said could be affected by legislation that comes before Congress. Mr. Price said he had done nothing wrong. \u201cThe reality is that everything that I did was ethical, above board, legal and transparent,\u201d he said. Just how involved is Mr. Price as the Trump administration plots how it will replace the Affordable Care Act? Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, tried to find out. \u201cPresident Trump said he\u2019s working with you on a replacement plan for the A. C. A. which is nearly finished and will be revealed after your confirmation,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cIs that true?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s true that he said that, yes,\u201d Mr. Price responded, drawing laughter in the hearing room. \u201cNot that he\u2019s ever done this before, but did the president lie?\u201d Mr. Brown asked. He added: \u201cI know we don\u2019t use the word lie here, because we\u2019re polite, when presidents say statements that aren\u2019t true. But did he lie to the public about working with you?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve had conversations with the president about health care, yes,\u201d Mr. Price replied. Senator Hatch lamented \u201cthe   of the nomination process. \u201d He said Democrats\u2019 attacks on Mr. Price\u2019s ethics were \u201cspecious and distorted. \u201d He said lawmakers should not \u201cinvent new standards for finances, ethics and disclosure that are different from those that have generally applied in the past. \u201d \u201cNone of those who say they oppose Dr. Price\u2019s nomination seem to be talking about whether he is qualified,\u201d Mr. Hatch said. Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, also came to Mr. Price\u2019s defense. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been asked to be a character witness in a felony trial in the sentencing phase of a conviction,\u201d he said. He called Mr. Price \u201can honorable man. \u201d Mr. Mulvaney said that tackling government waste and reducing debt would be his top priorities if he were confirmed as Mr. Trump\u2019s budget director. \u201cI believe, as a matter of principle, that the debt is a problem that must be addressed sooner rather than later,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said in prepared remarks to be delivered to the Senate Budget Committee. \u201cI also know that fundamental changes are needed in the way Washington spends and taxes if we truly want a healthy economy. \u201d While Mr. Mulvaney is a big believer in spending cuts, he made it clear that he wanted to protect America\u2019s social safety nets. \u201cA strong, healthy economy allows us to protect our most vulnerable,\u201d he said. Mr. Mulvaney was asked about his failure to pay nanny taxes in his opening question, and said that it had been an innocent mistake. \u201cIn 2000, we had triplets. When we came home, we hired someone to help my wife, to help take care of the children,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said. \u201cIn my mind, she was a babysitter. \u201d He added, \u201cI did not consider her a household employee for purposes of withholding. \u201d Mr. Mulvaney said he had realized his error when filling out a questionnaire related to his nomination to be Mr. Trump\u2019s budget director. He said that he had quickly notified his accountant, the president and his colleagues so that he could correct the mistake. The toughest questions Mr. Mulvaney faced on Tuesday came not from a Democrat but from Senator McCain. He asked Mr. Mulvaney about his record of voting for cuts to military spending, and appeared shocked when he could not remember those votes. \u201cBoy, I\u2019ll tell you, I would remember if I voted to cut our defenses the way you did, congressman,\u201d Mr. McCain said. \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t take it with the seriousness that it deserves. \u201d Mr. McCain was also unimpressed with Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s explanation for wanting to withdraw all troops from Afghanistan. After giving the congressman a history lesson on the roots of the Sept. 11 attacks, he offered a final note of disapproval. \u201cI am deeply concerned about your lack of support for our military,\u201d he said. Mr. Mulvaney was forced to address suggestions he had made in the past that Social Security was akin to a Ponzi scheme, and he played down that characterization. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t read too much into it, as describing it as a Ponzi scheme,\u201d he said, explaining that he had merely been referring to the fact that the program takes money from people and gives it to other people. As for keeping the program solvent, Mr. Mulvaney said he would not recommend cuts that would cause current retirees to lose benefits. However, he said that he could see raising the age for receiving benefits in the future. Ms. McMahon reassured senators that she would be a vigilant opponent of restrictive government regulations, promising to work to put in place \u201cthe right regulations\u201d to spur economic growth if she is confirmed as head of the Small Business Administration. Senator Jim Risch, the Idaho Republican who leads the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, said the regulatory structure of government today was \u201cstrangling businesses. \u201d Ms. McMahon presented herself not as the billionaire former chief executive of W. W. E. but instead as an entrepreneur who had weathered the most difficult moments of building a business from the ground up. \u201cSmall businesses want to feel they can take a risk on expansion or a new hire without fearing onerous new regulations or unexpected taxes, fees and fines that will make such growth unaffordable,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to renew optimism in our economy. \u201d Ms. McMahon described how she and her husband, Vince, built their global business enterprise from an operation so small they shared a desk. She spoke of how they fought back from an early bankruptcy filing  \u2014   a stark contrast to the wealthy former executive she is today. The McMahons were among Mr. Trump\u2019s biggest campaign donors, having given $6 million to a \u201csuper PAC\u201d supporting him last August and September. Ms. McMahon and Mr. Trump go back decades, bound by their shared background in entertainment. The Trump Plaza in Atlantic City hosted the W. W. E. \u2019s WrestleMania twice in the late 1980s, according to Mr. Trump\u2019s W. W. E. \u201cSuperstars\u201d bio, and Mr. Trump became a frequent attendee at the entertainment empire\u2019s events. In 2007, he shaved Mr. McMahon\u2019s head in the wrestling ring after winning a   Battle of the Billionaires wager. Introduced and endorsed by the two Democrats who defeated her in her failed Senate bids in Connecticut  \u2014   Senators Richard Blumenthal and Christopher S. Murphy  \u2014   Ms. McMahon seems likely to sail to confirmation, with the committee expected to approve her next week. The introduction and endorsement of a Republican nominee by two Democratic senators is unusual at the outset of a confirmation hearing. Mr. Murphy, who defeated Ms. McMahon in 2012, expressed \u201cconfidence that she is going to give good, sound counsel to President Trump. \u201d \u201cI saw firsthand the fight that Linda brings to any endeavor she takes on,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742628590.9939106}
