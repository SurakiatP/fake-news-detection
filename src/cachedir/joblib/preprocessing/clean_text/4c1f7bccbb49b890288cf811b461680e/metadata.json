[\u201cI know that the power, size and weight of Hungary is much smaller than that of the financial speculator, George Soros, who is now attacking Hungary,\u201d Orb\u00e1n said.  \u201cDespite ruining the lives of millions of European with his financial speculations, being penalized in Hungary for speculations, and who is an openly admitted enemy of the euro, he is so highly praised that he is received by the EU\u2019s top leaders,\u201d he said. The Prime Minister\u2019s address built upon comments he made in an Easter interview with Magyar Id\u0151k, in which he stated the motives behind Hungary\u2019s diffidence toward George Soros. \u201cThere can be no special privileges, and no one may stand above the law  \u2014   not even George Soros\u2019s people,\u201d he said. Through his organisations in Hungary, and hidden from the public gaze, Orb\u00e1n said, \u201cGeorge Soros is spending endless amounts of money to support illegal immigration. \u201d \u201cTo pursue his interests he pays a number of lobbying organisations operating in the guise of civil society. He maintains a regular network, with its own promoters, its own media, hundreds of people, and its own university. \u201d \u201cI believe that George Soros must not be underestimated: he is a powerful billionaire of enormous determination who, when it comes to his interests, respects neither God nor man,\u201d he said. In his address before Parliament Wednesday, Orb\u00e1n said that the basic stance of the government is contrary to the intentions of the European Commission regarding immigration. \u201cOur position is clear: we do not want, and do not think it is in accordance with the founding treaties of the Union, to settle migrants in our country in a mandatory way,\u201d he said. \u201cThe decision on who we live with can only be made by the Hungarian citizens. \u201d The Prime Minister said it is important to note that \u201cGeorge Soros and his NGOs want to transport one million migrants to the EU per year. He has personally, publicly announced this programme and provides a financial loan for it. You could read this yourselves. \u201d \u201cWe reject this,\u201d Orb\u00e1n said. \u201cWe do not want to lose the right of national ratemaking for public utilities, because we fear that this would increase the burdens of the people and once again lead to drastic price increases, from which Hungarian families have suffered enough. Regarding the regulation of   organisations (NGOs) Orb\u00e1n said that the Hungarian proposal \u201cfollows the American example. \u201d The \u201ccomplicated question,\u201d he said, is \u201chow we can make the operations of financially strong foreign external lobbies, willing to influence democratic   transparent to everyone. \u201d \u201cThe Hungarian legislation builds on the principal of clarity and transparency. We want nothing else but to be able to know of NGOs what kind of money and what kind of interests are behind them. This does not undermine their constitutional rights to have their voices heard, represent their interests and be able to organise themselves freely,\u201d he said. Orb\u00e1n said that Hungarians are in favor of \u201cstraight talk\u201d and reject attempts to beat around the bush or hide behind diplomatic language when discussing important issues. \u201cWe talk clearly and unambiguously, so everyone can understand, even if we know that this may not appeal to everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cWe on the other hand are irritated by the restrained political language, unable to name things for what they are, that has become widespread in European public life nowadays. \u201d Follow Thomas D.
