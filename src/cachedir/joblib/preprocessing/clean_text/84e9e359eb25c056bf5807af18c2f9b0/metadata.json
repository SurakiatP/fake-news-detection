[But under questioning by Sen. James Risch ( ) Comey all but destroyed any hope Democrats had for bringing a case of obstruction of justice against President Donald Trump.  Their exchange was as follows: Risch: I want to drill right down, as my time is limited, to the most recent   regarding, allegations that the President of the United States obstructed justice. And, boy, you nailed this down on page page five, paragraph three, you put this in quotes. Words matter, you wrote down the words so we can all have the words in front of us now. There\u2019s 28 words that are in quotes, and it says, quote: \u201cI hope\u201d  \u2014   this is the president speaking  \u2014   \u201cI hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go. \u201d Now, those are his exact words is that correct? Comey: Correct. Risch: And you wrote them here and you put them in quotes. Comey: Correct. Risch: Thank you for that. He did not direct you to let it go. Comey: Not in his words, no. Risch: He did not order you to let it go. Comey: Again, those words are not in order. Risch: No. He said, \u201cI hope. \u201d Now, like me, you probably did hundreds of cases, maybe thousands of cases, charging people with criminal offenses. And of course you have knowledge of the thousands of cases out there where people have been charged. Do you know of any case where a person has been charged for obstruction of justice or for that matter any other criminal offense where they said or thought they hoped for an outcome? Comey: I don\u2019t know well enough to answer. And the reason I keep saying his words is, I took it as a direction. Risch: Right. Comey: I mean, it\u2019s the President of the United States with me alone, saying, \u201cI hope this. \u201d I took it as this is what he wants me to do. I didn\u2019t obey that, but that\u2019s the way I took it. Risch: You may have taken it as a direction, but that\u2019s not what he said. Comey: Correct. Risch: He said, \u201cI hope. \u201d Comey: Those are exact words, correct. Risch: You don\u2019t know of anyone that\u2019s been charged for hoping something? Comey: I don\u2019t, as I sit here. Risch: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Democrats have hinged their hopes for impeachment  \u2014   and reversing the 2016 elections  \u2014   on the idea that Trump committed obstruction of justice. That case has now been smashed beyond repair. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News. He was named one of the \u201cmost influential\u201d people in news media in 2016.
