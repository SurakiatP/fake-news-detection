Mcmullen reiterated his views on CNN, where he purported to speak for the concern of the agents doing the leaking: \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what their concerns are. There concerns are that Donald Trump presents a threat to the country because of his  \u2014   what they see as his relationship with Vladimir Putin and the relationship of his team to other Russian intelligence officers. \u201d McMullin cited a New York Times report indicating that Trump campaign aides had contact with Russian intelligence  \u2014   without also noting that the same report indicated there was \u201cno evidence\u201d that the \u201cTrump campaign was colluding with the Russians on the hacking or other efforts to influence the election. \u201d He went on to make the very claim denied by the Times article, telling Baldwin Trump \u201cran a campaign that was assisted by a foreign adversary  \u2014   our greatest foreign adversary. \u201d Pressed by host Brooke Baldwin as to whether there were \u201ctoo many leaks,\u201d McMullin said that intelligence officers were bound by an oath to defend the country and the Constitution against \u201cdomestic and foreign enemies. \u201d That included \u201ca security threat coming from the White House. \u201d An obviously sympathetic Baldwin then asked McMullin: \u201cAre any of these people you\u2019re talking to just even worried about him even getting intel briefings, period?\u201d McMullin said that they are  \u2014   and seemed to admit, in the process, that he is speaking with intelligence officials who may be leaking information. During the presidential campaign, McMullin was a leader in the \u201cNeverTrump\u201d movement, consisting of conservatives who rejected Trump as the Republican Party nominee. Though he hoped to flip Utah, among a few other states, to Hillary Clinton by relegating Trump to third place, Trump won in that state and elsewhere. On Tuesday, Weekly Standard    Bill Kristol expressed similar sentiments, and appeared, in theory, to endorse a coup by the \u201cdeep state\u201d against the \u201cTrump state. \u201d Obviously strongly prefer normal democratic and constitutional politics. But if it comes to it, prefer the deep state to the Trump state.  \u2014   Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) February 14, 2017,  Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.
