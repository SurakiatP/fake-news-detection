[\u201cTo residents of Maryland, catching an occasional glimpse of a huge white blimp floating in the sky is not unusual,\u201d proclaimed The Intercept\u2019s Ryan Gallagher on Monday. \u201cBut less known is that the test flights have sometimes served a more secretive purpose involving National Security Agency surveillance. \u201d  \u201cBack in 2004, a division of the NSA called the National Tactical Integration Office fitted a   diameter airship called the Hover Hammer with an eavesdropping device,\u201d he continued, adding that \u201cThe agency launched the   airship at an airfield near Solomons Island, Maryland. \u201d The blimp was reportedly referred to publicly as an \u201cantenna mounting platform,\u201d and comprises of a \u201c  sphere inside another sphere, constructed of Spectra, the same material used to make   vests. \u201d \u201cFrom there, the blimp was able to vacuum up \u2018international shipping data emanating from the Long Island, New York area,\u2019\u201d Gallagher explained, citing a classified document published on Monday. \u201cThe spy equipment on the airship was called Digital Receiver Technology  \u2014   a proprietary system manufactured by a   company of the same name  \u2014   which can intercept wireless communications, including cellphone calls. \u201d In his report, Gallagher notes that, \u201cUnsurprisingly, privacy groups have expressed concerns about the prospect of the blimps being used domestically to spy on Americans. However, military officials have often been quick to dismiss such fears. \u201d \u201cIn August 2015, Lt. Shane Glass told Baltimore broadcaster WBAL that the JLENS blimps being tested in Maryland were not equipped with cameras or eavesdropping devices,\u201d he stated, before concluding that \u201cThe same cannot be said, it seems, of the NSA\u2019s Hover Hammer. \u201d Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
