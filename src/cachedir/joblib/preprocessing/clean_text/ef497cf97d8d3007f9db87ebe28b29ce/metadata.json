Davis III, Inside Higher Ed, November 1, 2016 \\n{snip} \\nThe recent case involving a first-generation Latina student , Tiffany Mart\u00ednez, at Suffolk University, is but one example. An accomplished undergraduate, published journal author and McNair scholar, Mart\u00ednez wrote a personal blog post titled \u201cAcademia, Love Me Back.\u201d In her heartfelt plea, Mart\u00ednez first recounts an experience she described as both disrespectful and invalidating and then explains that a sociology professor accused her of plagiarism, not privately, but in front of the entire class. The professor\u2019s claim was further illustrated by emphatic written statements on her paper such as \u201cthis is not your word\u201d and \u201cplease go back and indicate where you cut and paste.\u201d \\nOne such comment was written in the margin near the word \u201chence,\u201d which the professor had circled, an important detail, given Mart\u00ednez merely used it as an appropriate transition to connect two related sentences. Was it that surprising to Mart\u00ednez\u2019s professor that she knew how to appropriately use a transitional word? \\nAlthough some may dismiss this as a minor incident, Mart\u00ednez reminds us of the internalized racism and self-doubt resulting from years of educational violence. Like the many students of color from whom we hear similar stories in our campus climate assessments , what transpired for Mart\u00ednez was yet another debilitating and painful experience of marginalization. \\n{snip} \\nIt is imperative that our colleagues stop being surprised when students of color are able to thoughtfully articulate themselves in their writing and in class discussions. {snip} \\n{snip}'"}, "time": 1742628441.5450912}
