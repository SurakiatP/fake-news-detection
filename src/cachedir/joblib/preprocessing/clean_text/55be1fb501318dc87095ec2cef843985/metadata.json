That\u2019s us right now. \\n\u201cThere is no way on earth inflation should have come down. Maybe there\u2019s a short-circuit between that and the exchange rate. Maybe it just does it on its own now. \\n\u201cSeriously it\u2019s a miracle something this ancient and patched-together works at all. I\u2019m afraid to look closely in case I disturb the magic elves and it suddenly collapses into a pile of rust and bright orange paint.\u201d \\nHe added: \u201cStill, with the money we\u2019ve saved running this thing on the cheap for so many years, I\u2019ll bet there\u2019s loads saved up to get a really nice new one.\u201d \\nShare:'"}, "time": 1742563411.4400861}
