Rock star Roger Waters said to lose $4m over anti-Israel activism By Ian Greenhalgh on October 28, 2016 [Editor\u2019s note: This sorry tale of the persecution of a famous musician due to his moral stance against the fascist, racist, genocidal apartheid state of Israel starkly illustrates why so many others choose not to speak out \u2013 they know that they will be attacked and it will probably end up hurting them financially, in Water\u2019s case, to the tune of 4 million dollars. As Waters himself said in an interview, celebrities are \u2018scared shitless\u2019 to criticise Israel. Ian] Rock star Roger Waters said to lose $4m over anti-Israel activism \\nRoger Waters\u2019 anti-Israel activism has cost the British rock star millions of dollars and an American Express sponsorship, the New York Post reported. \\nThe credit giant took off the table a $4-million sponsorship of Waters\u2019 2017 tour in North America following his partisan and anti-Israel rhetoric this month at a festival that American Express sponsored, according to the tabloid\u2019s report Thursday. \\n\u201cRoger is putting on a huge show. The company was asked to sponsor his tour for $4 million, but pulled out because it did not want to be part of his anti-Israel rhetoric,\u201d an unnamed source from American Express is quoted as saying. \\nBut an official spokesperson for the firm said it never formally offered to sponsor Waters\u2019 2017 tour. \u201cWhen we were approached with the options, we passed on making a bid,\u201d the spokesperson said. \\nAt the \u201cOldchella\u201d festival, Waters used his time on stage to blast the Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and to call for a boycott against Israel, according to the Post. \\n\u201cF\\u2009-\\u2009-\\u2009k Trump and his wall,\u201d Waters said at that event, calling Trump \u201carrogant, lying, racist, sexist.\u201d He then voiced his solidarity with students protesting for Palestinians. He also urged people to support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel. \\nWaters did not reply to requests for a reaction by the Post. \\nEarlier this year, Waters said during an interview that celebrities are afraid to \u201cspeak out against Israel\u2019s policies,\u201d as he termed it, because of what he described as financial consequences attached to doing so. \\n\u201cI\u2019ve talked to a lot of them, and they are scared s\\u2009-\\u2009-\\u2009tless. If they say something in public, they will no longer have a career. They will be destroyed,\u201d he said. \\nWaters, the 69-year-old co-founder of the classic rock group Pink Floyd, has been widely criticized for his anti-Israel activities and accused of espousing anti-Semitic symbols, though he has denied doing so. \\nIn a 2013 concert in Brussels, Waters performed on a stage featuring a giant pig balloon emblazoned with a Star of David, among other symbols. \\nThe Simon Wiesenthal Center called Waters \u201can open hater of Jews.\u201d And the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s then leader, Abraham Foxman, in an open letter to Waters earlier this month, said his \u201cviews on Israel are in fact colored by offensive and dangerous undercurrents of anti-Jewish sentiment.\u201d Related Posts: No Related Posts The views expressed herein are the views of the author exclusively and not necessarily the views of VT, VT authors, affiliates, advertisers, sponsors, partners, technicians, or the Veterans Today Network and its assigns.
