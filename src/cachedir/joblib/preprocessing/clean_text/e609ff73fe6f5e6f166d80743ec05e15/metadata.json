D.  \u2014   The federal government on Friday temporarily blocked construction on part of a North Dakota oil pipeline, an unusual intervention in a prairie battle that has drawn thousands of Native Americans and activists to camp and demonstrate. In announcing the pause, the government acknowledged complaints from the Standing Rock Sioux and other tribal nations that their concerns had not been fully heard before federal overseers approved a pipeline that the tribe said could damage their water supplies and ancestral cultural sites. The Justice Department and other agencies called for \u201cserious discussion on whether there should be nationwide reform with respect to considering tribes\u2019 views on these types of infrastructure projects. \u201d The tribe in a statement called the federal order \u201ca game changer. \u201d The government\u2019s move, announced minutes after a federal judge rejected efforts by the Standing Rock Sioux to block construction of the project, appeared to seek to ease tensions and reset the terms of a passionate debate that has cast the   Dakota Access pipeline either as an economic boon for the Plains or a threat to Native American sovereignty, waters and lands. But perhaps more significantly, it appeared to signal a broader willingness to   the involvement of the tribes in infrastructure decisions like this one. The government said it would invite tribes to attend formal consultations about how they might work together on federal decisions on tribal lands and on whether future legislation is needed. In recent days, protesters have clashed with the pipeline company\u2019s contractors and private security guards, and officials in North Dakota have stepped up patrols and warned of rising tensions as ranchers, sheriff\u2019s officers, tribal leaders and protesters waited for a ruling on the Standing Rock Sioux\u2019s federal lawsuit to block construction on the pipeline. In a joint statement from the Departments of Justice, the Interior and the Army, the government announced that the pause applied to the pipeline\u2019s path across a sliver of federal lands and under a dammed section of the Missouri River known as Lake Oahe. The lake, created by   dams a   ago, is a water source for the Standing Rock Sioux and a focal point of the dispute. The Army Corps of Engineers intends to review its previous decisions under federal environmental and other laws that had given approval for the pipeline. The government also urged the company building the pipeline to \u201cvoluntarily pause\u201d all construction for 40 miles around Lake Oahe. The rest of the pipeline construction would not be affected. Tribal leaders said they were heartened by the government\u2019s move and relieved that, for the time being, the Dakota Access pipeline would not be allowed to cross under their water supply. \u201cWhen there\u2019s a wrong that keeps continuing to happen, it\u2019s O. K. to stand up against that wrong. That\u2019s all we did,\u201d said David Archambault II, the chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux. \u201cI\u2019m just so thankful that agencies are starting to listen. \u201d For supporters and opponents of the pipeline, it was a day of   whiplash. The tribe had been bracing for a defeat in the courtroom. But the government\u2019s intervention surprised so many that the tribe and its supporters sent out news releases condemning the ruling as soon as it was handed down, and sharply reversed course once they realized that the   pause had scrambled the situation here. Craig Stevens, a spokesman for the MAIN Coalition, a   group supporting the pipeline, hailed the judge\u2019s decision, but said the government\u2019s move was \u201cdeeply troubling and could have a   chilling effect on private infrastructure development in the United States. \u201d \u201cShould the administration ultimately stop this construction, it would set a horrific precedent,\u201d Mr. Stevens said in the statement. \u201cNo sane American company would dare expend years of effort and billions of dollars weaving through an onerous regulatory process receiving all necessary permits and agreements, only to be faced with additional regulatory impediments and be shut down halfway through completion of its project. \u201d The company behind the pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners, did not respond to a request for comment. It was unclear whether the company would heed the government\u2019s request to pause construction 20 miles to the east and west of Lake Oahe. After protests swelled recently and flared into violence last Saturday, construction work was halted near the site of the protest camp and the fields about a mile up the road where the pipeline is set to be buried. The company has previously said it has complied with every state and federal rule and gotten all the necessary permits to build the $3. 7 billion pipeline. It has said the Dakota Access pipeline would create jobs, pump millions into local economies and provide a reliable way to transport oil from western North Dakota to pipeline networks in Illinois that was safer than hauling oil on trucks or trains. In his ruling, Judge James E. Boasberg of Federal District Court in Washington focused on efforts by the Army Corps to meet with the Standing Rock Sioux and others to work through possible issues with the pipeline, since \u201cthe Corps appears to have had little involvement in Dakota Access\u2019s early planning,\u201d the judge wrote, but \u201cThe writing was on the wall, however, that many DAPL permitting requests would eventually land in the Corps inbox. \u201d The judge described a series of attempted meetings and missed communications between government and tribal officials the judge suggested that the lack of cooperation was mostly on the part of the tribe, while \u201cthe Corps has documented dozens of attempts it made to consult with the Standing Rock Sioux from the fall of 2014 through the spring of 2016\u201d on the pipeline plan. Two days after the Corps approved what are known as preconstruction notifications on the pipeline, the tribes filed suit demanding that the permits be withdrawn. The judge said the efforts to obtain cooperation from the Standing Rock tribe were exhaustive, with dozens of attempts documented by the Corps to bring them to the table for discussion of Lake Oahe and other points of water crossings. The judge then wryly added: \u201cTo the reader\u2019s relief, the Court need not repeat them here. Suffice it to say that the Tribe largely refused to engage in consultations. \u201d The meetings that the Corps was able to arrange, he wrote, \u201csufficed\u201d under the law. \u201cToday\u2019s news is a stunning development,\u201d said Jan Hasselman, a lawyer with Earthjustice, an environmental legal group that is representing the Standing Rock Sioux. \u201cIt vindicates what the tribe has been saying form the beginning: The process was wrong, and the legal standards for projects like these need reform. \u201d It was unclear on Friday how long the   pause in construction around Lake Oahe might last, or whether the move had given the Standing Rock Sioux any greater odds of prevailing. But on Friday morning, tribal members said they had lived on the land for generation upon generation, and were prepared to stay through the fall, the winter and beyond. \u201cThey\u2019ll be here for years,\u201d said Jana Gipp, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux, as she surveyed the camp\u2019s tents and teepees from a grassy bluff. \u201cThey won\u2019t give this up. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628421.226809}
