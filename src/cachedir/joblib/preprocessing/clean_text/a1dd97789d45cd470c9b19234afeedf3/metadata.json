As the post suggests, failure to agree restrictions and stabilize prices might heighten the risks of terrorist attacks and political instability in some of the non-OPEC countries invited to participate in wider negotiations. Yet inviting new participants to the negotiating party is only likely to complicate the situation and slow further the implementation of an internal production reduction already delayed for nearly a year. \\nBy Zainab Calcuttawala, an American journalist based in Morocco. She completed her undergraduate coursework at the University of Texas at Austin (Hook\u2019em) and reports on international trade, human rights issues and more. Originally published at Oilprice.com \\nLast week, Venezuelan oil minister Eulogio del Pino released a list of states invited to participate in the OPEC ongoing negotiations regarding a much-anticipated output freeze. \\nRussia, Egypt and ten other oil exporters made the list, though the high variation between the economic and political standings of the non-OPEC participants add to the already complicated and delicate orchestration of the deal\u2014 if there is to be a deal, that is. \\nThis past weekend, several of the invited non-OPEC countries sent representatives to Vienna for consultations regarding the terms of a potential freeze deal. No details have been finalized, but those who participated agreed to meet again before the 30 November OPEC summit. \\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and Energy Minister Alexander Novak have recently agreed to freeze output in coordination with OPEC, if the group\u2019s members can flesh out a plan amongst themselves. \\nAccording to OPEC Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo, the bloc is on track to deliver a deal by the end of November. Barkindo also said that Russia has agreed to participate in OPEC\u2019s official meeting this month. \\nAs outlined by the Jamestown Foundation last month, Kazakhstan is desperate for a freeze deal to help economic development rebound to the 6-7 percent expansion rate that the former Soviet Republic saw when barrel prices exceeded $100. But just because they are desperate for a cut doesn\u2019t mean they will participate. \\nKazakh Energy Minister Kanat Bozumbayev said on Tuesday that Kazakhstan itself would not be doing any cutting, because, according to Bozumbayev, their production levels are small in proportion to some of the others at the negotiating table, namely Russia, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Iran, and Mexico. \\nThis year, Kazakhstan does not expect its economy to grow more than 0.1 percent, while 2017 forecasts from the World Bank predict a low one-percent increase in GDP. Kazakhstan \u2013 which recently reopened its Kashagan field, depends on oil exports for over 60 percent of total government revenues and a quarter of its GDP. \\nA failed deal could mean renewed terrorist attacks and political instability for Kazakhstan as the Kazakh economy continues to spiral downwards. \\nAsked what he hoped Saturday\u2019s meeting would achieve, a Kazakh official in attendance in Vienna desperately said: \u201cWe just hope the price will react and it will increase.\u201d That desperation is shared by many other oil-dependent countries, but this desperation is also a sign that these countries are not in any position to scale back the production that generates the most revenue. \\nAzerbaijan was also at the table. Halfway through October, Azerbaijan \u2013 a country that produced more than half of the world\u2019s oil a century ago \u2013 also announced its support of an OPEC/non-OPEC cut, which, as ClipperData noted , is convenient because the country\u2019s September oil production was 10.2 percent lower than its August rate. \\n\u201cVenezuela and Azerbaijan agree that some measures will be taken to stabilize the market,\u201d Azeri Energy Minister Natig Aliyev said this weekend. \u201cWe agreed the price of oil can be around $60 per barrel.\u201d Statements revolving around price, however, do not speak to who is ready to share the burden of cutting production, and do little to assuage market fears that a cut is but a wispy goal. \\nOman wasn\u2019t buying the feasibility of OPEC cuts either, and before the Algiers meeting in September, Oman said as much, stating that it did not believe in the bloc\u2019s ability to solve the pricing crisis due to several failed efforts to freeze output over the past year. \\nNewer reports on Oman show that they officially support an output freeze and overall reduction, with the expectation that \u201csimilar measures be taken by other countries.\u201d It remains unclear if Iraq, a war-torn nation currently defying production limits, and Iran, a country trying to regain its legs now that sanctions were lifted, count as one of the \u201cother countries\u201d that Oman expects to cut output. \\nAs a net oil importer, Egypt does not have the market power or political capital to sway the momentum of a freeze one way or another. The North African country\u2019s recent spat with Saudi Arabia \u2013 the de facto leader of OPEC \u2013 over suspended petroleum shipments will also limit the salience of Egyptian interests in the bloc\u2019s proceedings. \\nSources from the Egyptian Parliament say the country\u2019s energy ministry will be asked to review Saudi Aramco\u2019s five-year agreement to supply Egypt with petroleum derivatives in the coming weeks, further complicating relations between the two nations. \\nNinety-nine percent of Canadian oil exports go straight to the United States, according to governmental data from the buyer and seller countries. \\nNeither of the two North American countries is part of OPEC, and they have their own agreements for energy supplies. So even though Canada has been invited to participate in the freeze talks, the country does not have the economic or political incentive to reduce output. \\nBrazil elected to \u201cobserve\u201d Saturday\u2019s meeting as the country prepares to increase production rates over the next few years. This makes them extremely unlikely participants in any efforts to scale back production. \\nOther countries present this weekend included Mexico, which has spent the better part of this summer building a hedge against low oil prices for the next fiscal year. \\nSmall-scale producers such as Bolivia and Trinidad and Tobago have already turned down production over the past two years, which had a limited effect on market fundamentals. \\nNorway, a 1.6 million barrel per day producer that has increased output by 2.1 percent in 2014 and 3.08 percent in 2015, declined to meet with OPEC over the weekend. \\nThe geopolitics of oil within OPEC has already delayed the implementation of an internal production reduction for almost an entire year. By adding new nations from previously uninvolved continents (North America and Europe), the bloc has flooded the negotiation table with new interests \u2013 creating a fresh slate of diplomatic obstacles to overcome before an output freeze can be implemented. 0 0 0 0 0 0'"}, "time": 1742563852.9967477}
