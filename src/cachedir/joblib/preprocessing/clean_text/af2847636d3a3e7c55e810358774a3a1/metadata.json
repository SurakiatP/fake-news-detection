Two U.S. Senate candidates of the duopoly parties pretended to support the Green Party\u2019s candidate\u2019s right to join the debate, but failed to protest when cops hauled her away. \u201cThis was their \u2018Rosa Parks\u2019 moment when they could have stood for integrity and democracy\u201d \u2014 but failed the test. \u201cThe corporate media and the political duopoly collaborated to ensure that the Green Party message would not be heard.\u201d US corruption during this campaign season is on full display for the entire world to ponder. No one paying even scant attention can deny the thin veneer that is used to hide state sponsored police murder of Africans, structural poverty and the cozy relationship between the 1% rulers in the Democratic and Republican parties. Green Party candidates, such as Jill Stein, Ajamu Baraka and Margaret Flowers have forced sunlight\u2019s disinfectant power to expose a rigged, racist and revolting political system that politically and economically devours communities of color, condones police murders of Black youth, intentionally exposes communities, like Flint, Michigan, to poisoned water, promotes drone warfare and the pilfering of the natural resources of Africa and South America. The system, however is finding it more difficult to block out the voices of dissent. Such was the situation this week at the University of Baltimore College of Public Affairs where Dr. Margaret Flowers, the Green Party candidate for the Maryland US Senate seat, was refused the opportunity to participate in the only televised debate alongside Democratic Congressman Chris Van Hollen and Republican state Del. Kathy Szeliga. The corporate media and the political duopoly collaborated to ensure that the Green Party message would not be heard. The sham excuse used to exclude Flowers was that her poll numbers had not reached 15%. But, of course it is difficult to reach the magic number of 15% in the polls when one is systematically excluded from debates and public events. This is the revolving rigged system that Black people know so well. \u201cWhen the police came to escort her off the stage neither candidate provided a meaningful protest of the anti-democratic process unfolding.\u201d When the rigged debate started, audience members called for Dr. Flowers to join Van Hollen and Szeliga. Shouts of \u201clet her speak\u201d could be heard from the audience. Responding to the audience, Dr. Flowers took her place on the stage shaking hands with both candidates. Standing on the stage, she turned her attention to the audience and said: \u201cI think it\u2019s important for voters to understand the differences between myself and Congressman Van Hollen and Delegate Szeliga.\u201d With the police moving on stage to remove her, she said, \u2026\u201dI mean, you say you\u2019re a public university and you want to educate the public, but without having a full public discussion, that doesn\u2019t actually happen.\u201d While Van Hollen and Szeliga seemed to agree with Dr. Flowers participating in the debate, when the police came to escort her off the stage neither candidate provided a meaningful protest of the anti-democratic process unfolding. Delegate Szeliga noted that a third podium was available but both politicians remained silent while Dr. Flowers was forced to leave the stage. This was their \u201cRosa Parks\u201d moment when they could have stood for integrity and democracy but Van Hollen and Szeliga, failed to show the smallest amount of courage, leadership and commitment to anything greater than their individual ambitions and desire for power. Margaret was escorted by police to a sidewalk outside the debate hall and that symbolically represents the state of US democracy. After church on Sunday, a sister said to me, \u201cI know a lot of Black folks are going to vote for Hilary Clinton but I can\u2019t vote for the lesser of two evils. I\u2019ve decided to vote for Jill Stein. I\u2019m going to vote my conscience!\u201d My only response after agreeing with her analysis was to add, \u201cDon\u2019t forget to also vote for Margaret Flowers.\u201c Dr. Margaret Flowers of Green Party Interrupts Maryland Senate Televised Debate: Margaret Flowers Campaign Information: http://www.flowersforsenate.org [4] Source URL: http://blackagendareport.com/margaret_flowers_ejected_debate'"}, "time": 1742628498.935608}
