[\u201cFriday nights are always my worst night of sleep because I\u2019m up reflecting on the things I should or shouldn\u2019t have said on my live show,\u201d Maher said in a statement Saturday. \u201cLast night was a particularly long night as I regret the word I used in the banter of a live moment. The word was offensive and I regret saying it and am very sorry. \u201d  Maher was speaking to Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse on Real Time Friday night about the senator\u2019s new book, The Vanishing American Adult, when the topic of how adults dress up for Halloween came up. Sasse told Maher that in Nebraska, adults don\u2019t often dress up for Halloween. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get to Nebraska more,\u201d Maher joked. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Sasse replied. \u201cWe\u2019d love to have you work in the fields with us. \u201d \u201cWork in the fields? Senator, I\u2019m a house n***er,\u201d Maher replied, before quickly adding that the comment was a joke. The remark drew gasps and some laughter from the audience. HBO issued a statement Saturday saying the comment would be removed from future broadcasts of the show. \u201cBill Maher\u2019s comment last night was completely inexcusable and tasteless. We are removing his deeply offensive comment from any subsequent airings of the show,\u201d the premium cable channel said. Maher\u2019s comment sparked outrage across social media Friday night, with some prominent commentators, including Black Lives Matter activist Deray McKesson, calling for his firing from HBO. But really, @BillMaher has got to go. There are no explanations that make this acceptable. pic. twitter.   \u2014   deray mckesson (@deray) June 3, 2017,  And why did the audience think it was okay to laugh? And Ben Sasse doesn\u2019t even flinch. What is happening in the world?  \u2014   deray mckesson (@deray) June 3, 2017,  Maher\u2019s comment comes as comedians have faced increasing blowback for what many critics have called inappropriate and indecent jokes. Last week, comedian Kathy Griffin was fired from her role on CNN\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve Live broadcast and saw the cancellation of at least five scheduled performances on her comedy tour after a photo was published in which she posed with a bloodied, decapitated head meant to resemble that of President Donald Trump. In May, Late Show host Stephen Colbert issued an   apology after he said Trump\u2019s mouth was only good for being Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s \u201cc*ck holster. \u201d The FCC looked into the comments but decided no action was warranted.
