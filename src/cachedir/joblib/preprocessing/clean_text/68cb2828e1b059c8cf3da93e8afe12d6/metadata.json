The French bank BNP Paribas said it would shut its Cayman Islands branch. In Pakistan, a cricketer turned politician who had attacked the prime minister over his family\u2019s offshore accounts admitted that he, too, had used a shell company. And the Group of 7 nations, meeting in Japan, agreed to crack down on illicit finance. It was the latest fallout from the Panama Papers, the largest leak of secret documents to journalists in history. In the eight weeks since the publication of the first articles by some 370 reporters in 76 countries, an effort organized by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, the impact of the revelations on the shadowy world of offshore finance has been striking  \u2014   even as prospects for   reform remain uncertain. Investigations are underway in dozens of countries, including the United States. Proposed laws requiring disclosure of the true owners of offshore companies to tax collectors or to the public have new momentum. Cartoonists have had a field day, reflecting the widespread anger and disgust pressuring governments to act. \u201cThe reaction around the world has been pretty spectacular,\u201d said Gabriel Zucman, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, who has estimated that 8 percent of the world\u2019s personal wealth is hidden in tax havens. \u201cThe demand for financial transparency and tax reform is really growing. It\u2019s the first time there\u2019s been public outrage at the global level on these issues. \u201d The disclosure by an anonymous leaker of 11. 5 million documents from a Panamanian law firm at the center of the offshore industry to a German newspaper was a landmark in another way as well. It was the latest and biggest in a series of recent megaleaks, establishing the   unauthorized disclosure of government and corporate secrets as a contagious phenomenon that is unlikely to go away. Since 2010, when a   intelligence analyst in Iraq copied thousands of classified files onto CDs labeled as Lady Gaga songs and gave them to the antisecrecy organization WikiLeaks, it has become clear that technology has revolutionized leaking. Pfc. Chelsea Manning, then known as Bradley, disclosed hundreds of thousands of diplomatic cables and military field reports. In 2013, Edward J. Snowden, citing Private Manning as an inspiration, gave a similar number of highly classified National Security Agency documents to a few journalists. About a year ago, a     using the name John Doe contacted Bastian Obermayer, a reporter for the newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung in Munich, and eventually passed to him a far greater volume of material from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca: The trove totaled 2. 6 terabytes, more than 1, 000 times the size of the Manning files. In a subsequent manifesto issued by way of the German newspaper, John Doe cited the precedent of Mr. Snowden, who he said deserved \u201ca hero\u2019s welcome. \u201d Trevor Timm, the executive director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which supports what it calls transparency journalism, said the impact of each leak had inspired the next leaker. \u201cEspecially with the Panama Papers, I think it\u2019s now a trend,\u201d Mr. Timm said. \u201cWhen people inside organizations see the impact that   on this scale can have, they follow that example. \u201d None of this would have been conceivable in the photocopier era, when the Panama Papers would have required a fleet of   to deliver. \u201cThese are disclosures not of documents but of databases  \u2014   entire libraries,\u201d said Steven Aftergood, who tracks government secrecy for the Federation of American Scientists. John Doe\u2019s manifesto was tellingly titled \u201cThe Revolution Will Be Digitized. \u201d Of course, what many advocates cheer, the organizations exposed by the leaks denounce. In a series of statements, Mossack Fonseca has criticized journalists\u2019 use of \u201cinformation stolen from our files,\u201d asserted that news reports \u201cmisrepresented the nature of our work\u201d and threatened legal action. It is not clear whether John Doe is a disgruntled insider or a hacker who broke into the law firm\u2019s files, as the firm has suggested. The same tools that are being used by activists and journalists for what they consider to be   purposes can be used by others. Hackers stole nude photographs from celebrities\u2019 Apple accounts in 2014 and posted them on the web. A computer   later that year, attributed to North Korea, obtained hundreds of Sony Corporation emails, many of which were made public. The hacker group known as Anonymous has released voluminous email files of two security firms, Stratfor and HBGary Federal. For Mr. Obermayer and a colleague at S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, Frederik Obermaier, the fact that anonymous companies created by Mossack Fonseca were being used to evade taxes and launder illicit money justified publication. They shared the Panama Papers with the international journalists\u2019 group to bring strength and local expertise to the data. When the articles were published, their newspaper\u2019s web servers crashed from the initial volume of readers. Mr. Obermayer said it was \u201ca really strange feeling  \u2014   that something that started with you has led to mass demonstrations in several countries. \u201d Within days, Iceland\u2019s prime minister, whose offshore company was revealed by the papers, had stepped down. So had a Spanish government minister, an Armenian justice official and a member of the ethics committee of FIFA, the world soccer association. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, whose friends had moved $2 billion through offshore companies, denounced the disclosures as an American plot to smear his country. A Mexican cartel suspect was arrested in Uruguay at an address disclosed in the documents. Sierra Leone began to investigate mining contracts. The Swiss police raided the European soccer headquarters. The art market was rocked by revelations of subterfuge in the sale of valuable paintings. The list went on. In the United States, the revelations of hidden wealth have resonated amid growing public concern about economic inequality the word yacht appears in the documents 19, 380 times. President Obama has deplored how the rich and some companies are \u201cgaming the system,\u201d as he said the documents showed, and has proposed multiple reforms. In fact, some experts believe the \u201cPanama\u201d label is misleading, obscuring the central role of several states, including Delaware, Wyoming and Nevada, in registering companies with hidden ownership. Mossack Fonseca probably represents just 5 or 10 percent of the industry creating anonymous companies, Mr. Zucman of Berkeley said, so the disclosures have left the vast majority hidden. And no matter where shell companies may be registered, he said, much of the wealth they own is invested in the United States, in real estate, stocks and bonds. \u201cThe U. S. could find out who the true owners are,\u201d Mr. Zucman said. But the United States may illustrate the difficulty of moving from splashy revelations to serious change. States with a stake in the lucrative corporate registration business are likely to resist serious changes, and Congress appears unlikely to act anytime soon on comprehensive reform bills. \u201cThe offshore system is incredibly resilient, with a ton of smart lawyers and accountants to find new ways to hide money,\u201d said Marina Walker Guevara, the deputy director of the international journalists\u2019 consortium. David Marchant, the editor of OffshoreAlert, a news site that covers offshore finance, called the Panama Papers \u201can extraordinary event\u201d that dwarfs past expos\u00e9s of the industry. A session on the leak at the annual OffshoreAlert conference in Miami this month grew heated, he said, as champions of transparency debated industry players who said privacy had been trampled. Mr. Marchant said he believed the reform push from the leak would fade. \u201cThe people using the offshore system to evade their financial responsibilities tend to be very wealthy and influential people,\u201d he said. He predicted that any changes in laws and regulations after the disclosures would be \u201cmostly window dressing. \u201d On the other hand, Mr. Marchant said, the example of John Doe will probably be followed by other leakers. \u201cThis is the age we live in,\u201d he said. \u201cThis record will be broken before long. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563764.1765194}
