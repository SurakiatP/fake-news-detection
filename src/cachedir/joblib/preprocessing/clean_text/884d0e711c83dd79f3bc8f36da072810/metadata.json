As a result, the FBI is reopening its investigation of Hillary. \\nThe FBI began their investigation of Hillary in July, 2015. A year later, Comey announced that the FBI was not recommending charges against Hillary, saying \u201cno reasonable prosecutor\u201d would bring such a case. But he did chastise the former secretary of state for being \u201cextremely careless\u201d in her handling of sensitive information. For her part, Hillary continues to insist lie that her decision to use a private email server was merely a \u201cmistake,\u201d that the emails contained no classified information, and that she violated no laws. \\nAddressed to the respective Chairpersons of Congressional Committees on Intelligence, Judiciary, Appropriations, Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Oversight and Government Reform, below is Comey\u2019s brief letter of October 28, 2016 : \\nU.S. Department of Justice Federal Bureau of Investigation Washington, D. C. 20535 \\nOctober 28, 2016 \\nDear Messrs Chairmen: \\nIn previous congressional testimony, l referred to the fact that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had completed its investigation of former Secretary Clinton\u2019s personal email server. Due to recent developments, I am writing to supplement my previous testimony. \\nIn connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation. I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation. \\nAlthough the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant , and I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work , I believe it is important to update your Committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony. \\nSincerely yours, James B. Comey Director \\nThe \u201cunrelated case\u201d is the FBI\u2019s investigation of illicit text messages (sextexts) sent to a 15-year-old female minor in North Carolina by Anthony Weiner, the disgraced former Congressman (D-NY) and estranged husband of Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton. Note: Even after losing his Congressional seat after news broke of his sextexts and sending a picture of his erection to a woman, Weiner has continued with his sextexts. The most recent scandal was his sending , to a busty 40-something divorcee in California, a picture of himself with an erection, in bed next to his infant child ( New York Post ). \\nAs part of the probe, the FBI seized devices from Weiner, including a laptop computer shared by Weiner and Abedin. The laptop\u2019s hard drive reportedly contained thousands of Abedin\u2019s emails to Hillary and other State Department officials. \\nExperts believe that since Comey\u2019s letter was sent just 11 days before the 2016 presidential election, the FBI must have found something significant despite Comey\u2019s assertion otherwise. \\nVictoria Toensing, a former deputy assistant attorney general of the U.S. and a former assistant U.S. attorney, suspects agents came directly to Comey with evidence he could not ignore. Toensing said: \u201cWell, it couldn\u2019t be a trifling thing, because this is a big deal. You can see the brouhaha this is causing, so it couldn\u2019t just be a little incident over email. It has to be pretty significant.\u201d \\nToensing and her husband, former U.S. Attorney Joe diGenova, have publicly discussed the number of career FBI and Justice Department employees who are disgusted that Hillary was not prosecuted for her \u201ccareless\u201d handling of classified information and that Comey refused even to recommend charges. She believes Comey may have acted Friday with that internal criticism in mind: \u201cI think he\u2019s felt the heat. If nobody had criticized him at all he might have made this go under the rug. He knows he\u2019s in a glass house.\u201d \\nPredictably, the news that it was Anthony Weiner\u2019s sexual indiscretions that led the FBI to re-open its investigation of Hillary mere days before the presidential election, resulted in a flurry of jokes, puns and innuendos, such as \u201cCocktober Surprise\u201d. But the best line is from ZeroHedge reader Omega_Man: \\nBREAKING: DNC-Clinton campaign, along with Donna Brazile, have stated that the young girl Weiner was flirting with was actually Vladimir Putin in disguise. \\nHow ironic that the political ambitions of Hillary \u2014 the woman who means to be America\u2019s first female president \u2014 may be scuttled by two dicks. Already neck-deep in the ever-increasing number of women who accuse Bill Clinton of sexual harassment, rape, and fathering a child out of wedlock, Hillary now finds herself re-enmeshed in FBI investigation as a result of Anthony Weiner\u2019s sexual exploits. \\nIt\u2019s self-proclaimed feminist Hillary\u2019s karmic payback for not just turning a blind eye to her husband\u2019s decades of abusing women, but scapegoating and blaming his victims as sluts and floozies.'"}, "time": 1742628472.5220077}
