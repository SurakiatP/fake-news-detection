Some get injured, while others go unhurt  \u2014   often claiming it\u2019s because they knew how to fall. According to paratroopers, stunt professionals, physical therapists and martial arts instructors, there is indeed a \u201cright way\u201d to fall  \u2014   and it can save you a lot of grief if you know how to do it. Although often associated with older people, falls occur at any age and are the most common cause of injury seen in emergency rooms in the United States. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality estimates that falls cause more than a third of   emergency room visits, around 7. 9 million a year. \u201cAs physical therapists we talk a lot about preventing falls, but what we don\u2019t talk about is what to do when you actually do fall,\u201d said Jessica Schwartz, a physical therapist in New York City who trains athletes and people with prosthetic limbs to fall without hurting themselves. \u201cIt\u2019s almost inevitable you are going to fall, so you really should know what to do. \u201d The number one thing to remember, she said, is to protect your head. So if you find yourself falling, pivot to your side and tuck in your head. \u201cHave you seen those slip and fall cartoons where the characters fall flat on their back or face? Don\u2019t do that,\u201d said Dr. Schwartz. \u201cYou\u2019ll hit your head like a coconut and get a concussion,\u201d and the reverse motion, or bounce, of your head after impact \u201cwill give you something like whiplash. \u201d Moreover, falling straight forward or backward raises the risk of damaging your spine and vital organs. The other thing to avoid, she said, is \u201cfoosh,\u201d an acronym for \u201cfalling onto outstretched hands. \u201d If you do that, all the force of impact will be concentrated there, raising the risk of breaking your wrist. You similarly don\u2019t want to come crashing down on your knee so you break your kneecap or do that maneuver where you kind of pedal with your feet to catch yourself, which can lead to broken bones in your foot and ankle. Instead, if you feel yourself falling, experts said you should bend your elbows and knees and try to take the hit on the fleshiest parts of your body, like the side of your thigh, buttocks and shoulder. \u201cAim for the meat, not bone,\u201d said Kevin Inouye, a stuntman and assistant professor of acting, movement and stage combat at the University of Wyoming. \u201cYour instinct will be to reach out with hands or try to catch yourself with your knee or foot, but they are hard and not forgiving when you go down. \u201d The key is to not fight the fall, but just to roll with it, as paratroopers do. \u201cThe idea is to orient your body to the ground so when you hit, there\u2019s a multistep process of hitting and shifting your body weight to break up that impact,\u201d said Sgt. First Class Chuck Davidson, master trainer at the Army\u2019s Advanced Airborne School at Ft. Bragg, N. C. Paratroopers\u2019 goal is to fall sideways in the direction the wind is carrying them  \u2014   in no way resisting the momentum of the fall. When the balls of their feet barely reach the ground, they immediately distribute the impact in rapid sequence up through the calf to the thigh and buttocks. Then they roll over on the latissimus dorsi muscle, the large, flat muscle running laterally down the side of your back, and kick their feet over, shifting their weight so they end up supine with legs bent in front of them. The procedure is strikingly similar to how martial arts practitioners learn to take a fall when they are, say, thrown over someone\u2019s shoulder or have their legs knocked out from under them. \u201cI would say the principles we follow are: Accept that you\u2019re falling and go with it, round your body, and don\u2019t stiffen and distribute the energy so you take the fall in the widest area possible,\u201d said Paul Schreiner, a black belt jiu jitsu instructor at Marcelo Garcia Academy in New York City. While martial arts falls often have a gymnastic aspect, with rather elegant and snappy kinds of somersaults, it\u2019s still all about spreading out the force of impact. \u201cThere may be an aesthetic component, but what it does is save the body,\u201d said Mr. Schreiner. \u201cIf you don\u2019t take the fall in any single place, you\u2019ll still walk out sore, but you\u2019ll walk out of there. \u201d Difficult as it may sound as you\u2019re hurtling toward the ground  \u2014   medical bills and disability flashing through your mind  \u2014   experts said it\u2019s important to relax as you fall. You\u2019re less likely to hurt yourself if you soften up all your muscles and exhale. Rigidity is your enemy, while pliability is your friend. \u201cAs unfair as it is, that\u2019s why people who are drunk\u201d tend to be the ones who \u201cdon\u2019t get hurt in car crashes,\u201d said Mr. Inouye. \u201cThey are loose and just flop around. \u201d Of course, you will be better able to loosen up, pivot to your side, tuck and roll if you are in good physical condition. \u201cIf you have a room full of soccer players and computer desk workers and go around knocking people over, you can bet the soccer players are going to be less likely to get hurt because of their superior strength, agility and coordination,\u201d said Erik Moen, a physical therapist in Kenmore, Wash. But that doesn\u2019t mean you have to be an elite athlete or paratrooper to fall the \u201cright way. \u201d Young children are arguably the best fallers because they have yet to develop fear or embarrassment, so they just tumble and roll without tensing up and trying to catch themselves. Physical therapists can be helpful in assessing your weaknesses and prescribing    exercises to improve your strength and agility (for example, jumping from side to side and on and off platforms or steps) so that you will be better able to execute a fall as well as lessen the risk that you will fall in the first place.'"}, "time": 1742561944.4764712}
