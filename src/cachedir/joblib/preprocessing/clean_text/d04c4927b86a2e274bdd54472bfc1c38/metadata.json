Tuesday on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cFox  Friends,\u201d conservative radio host Laura Ingraham advised President Donald Trump to remain on track when it comes delivering his promises to the country and to not allow the investigation into his ties with Russia to get him off track.  \u201cI do think it\u2019s probably pretty wise at this point for President Trump to not to tweet issues or points that are tangential or that are not factually confirmed,\u201d Ingraham said. \u201cI think three weeks ago when he  \u2014   or two weeks ago when he tweeted that comment out about Obama wiretapping, that was a mistake, and I think he should stay focused on the things he promised the country that he would do. \u201d \u201cThis investigation is going to run its course,\u201d she added. \u201cBut they are going to try to use this to get him off track every chance they can. They want to use it to try to get him off track and try to hurt his credibility. That\u2019s their goal. They want him out. \u201d Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor'"}, "time": 1742628525.1011157}
