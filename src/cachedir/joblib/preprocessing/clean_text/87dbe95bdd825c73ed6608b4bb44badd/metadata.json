(AP Photo/Kevin Lamarque, Pool) \\nMINNEAPOLIS \u2014 WikiLeaks\u2019 archive of emails taken from the Gmail account of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chair continue to shed new light on the close relationships between the Democratic Party elite and the U.S. government. \\nThe latest wave of John Podesta\u2019s emails to be published by WikiLeaks has thrust into the spotlight Peter Kadzik, a well-connected Washington attorney who currently serves as an assistant attorney general at the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legislative Affairs. \\n\u201cDoJ Assistant Attorney Peter Kadzik outed as a mole for Hillary Clinton campaign,\u201d WikiLeaks tweeted on Wednesday. The tweet highlighted an email Kadzik sent to Podesta on May 19, 2015, warning him of a congressional hearing and updating the team on the State Department\u2019s progress in publishing Clinton\u2019s emails in response to Freedom of Information Act requests.

Likely to get questions on State Department emails. Another filing in the FOIA case went in last night or will go in this am that indicates it will be awhile (2016) before the State Department posts the emails.\u201d \\nPodesta forwarded the email to several members of the Clinton campaign team. \\nBen Brody, a Bloomberg politics reporter assigned to cover the election, noted that all of the information Kadzik provided was public. On Wednesday, Brody reported: \\n\u201cKadzik was alerting Podesta to public events: The Judiciary Committee held an open hearing that day, and a new filing in the court case a day earlier set out the State Department\u2019s proposed timetable.\u201d \\nBut the May 19 email and others like it are still prompting concerns over Kadzik\u2019s close ties to the DOJ and the Clinton campaign. On Monday, Kadzik sent letters to members of Congress, assuring them that the Justice Department would closely supervise a renewed FBI investigation into Clinton\u2019s emails in light of evidence uncovered in an unrelated investigation regarding Anthony Weiner, the New York congressman who resigned amid accusations that he\u2019d \u201csexted\u201d minors. Weiner is estranged from his wife, Huma Abedin, one of Clinton\u2019s top aides. Kadzik wrote: \\n\u201cWe assure you that the [Justice] Department will continue to work closely with the FBI and together, dedicate all necessary resources and take appropriate steps as expeditiously as possible.\u201d #BREAKING Senior DOJ official sends letter to lawmakers responding to request for more information about email review. #8days pic.twitter.com/PCgT2ODkQd \\n\u2014 Just the Facts (@JTF_News) October 31, 2016 \\nThe ties between Kadzik and Podesta go far beyond a single email, however. On Oct. 18, the conservative site The Washington Free Beacon highlighted a Sept. 8, 2008 email from Podesta to Cassandra Butts, a close advisor to President Barack Obama who died later that year. In the email, with the subject line \u201cPeter Kadzik,\u201d Podesta wrote: \\n\u201cWilling to help. Fantastic lawyer. Kept me out of jail. I\u2019m sure Christine knows him. Wants to help. Think he would be an excellent vet lead.\u201d \\nAn anonymous contributor to Zero Hedge writing under the name \u201cTyler Durden\u201d has been connecting the dots in an analysis of WikiLeaks\u2019 Podesta Emails archive published on Tuesday. \u201cTyler Durden\u201d elaborated on the ways Kadzik may have helped Podesta in the past: \\n\u201cPodesta was caught in a sticky situation in both the Lewinsky affair and the Rich pardon scandal. As deputy chief of staff to Clinton in 1996, Podesta asked then-United Nations ambassador Bill Richardson to hire the 23-year-old Lewinsky. In April 1996, the White House transferred Lewinsky from her job as a White House intern to the Pentagon in order to keep her and Bill Clinton separate. But the Clinton team also wanted to keep Lewinsky happy so that she would not spill the beans about her sexual relationship with Clinton.\u201d \\nThe anonymous blogger also noted that, \u201cin the waning days of the Bill Clinton administration, Kadzik lobbied Podesta on behalf of Marc Rich, the fugitive who Bill Clinton controversially pardoned on his last day in office.\u201d \\nWhile it\u2019s unclear if Podesta and Kadzik are truly \u201cbest friends,\u201d as \u201cTyler Durden\u201d asserts, the writer is correct in arguing that voters should be concerned that \u201cthe DOJ will be in charge of a probe that could potentially sink Hillary Clinton\u201d even as the department\u2019s leadership maintains such close connections to Clinton, her team, and the Obama administration.
