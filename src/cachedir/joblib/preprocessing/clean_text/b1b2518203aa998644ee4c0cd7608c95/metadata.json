Lauletta wrote that he received a phone call from Christina, who tearfully explained that she \"was jumped\" and \"beat up pretty bad.\" \\n\"I find out that her and her 2 male friends where badly beaten by a group of 30-40 black teenagers on their way home from the Temple football game,\" Lauletta wrote. \"This happened after they got off the subway at Broad and Cecil B Moore. These sick animals held her down and kicked and stomped on her repeatedly. Thank god, the people from the pizza place intervened.\" \\nWhile no bones were broken, Christina was \"badly bruised\" throughout her body, Lauletta said \"it makes me cry just thinking about it.\" \\nLauletta\\'s post seemed to indicate the racial aspect of the attack, and on Tuesday he posted on Facebook that \"the FBI is investigating\" and \"are analyzing all video coverage,\" signaling that the FBI is looking into the attack as a hate crime. \\nIn an interview with the New York Post , Lauletta wouldn\\'t explicitly say the attack was racially motivated but sort of implied it: \\n\u201cWell, I haven\u2019t been saying that because everybody is trying to get me to say it and I don\u2019t know if I want to be that person,\u201d Lauletta told The Post. \u201cEveryone can draw their own conclusions.\u201d \\nLauletta said the possibility of the attacks being motivated by race \u2013 perhaps as a sort of gang initiation \u2013 was part of the reason why his story was shared so frequently and as far away as Africa. \\n\u201cThat\u2019s why it spread so fast,\u201d Lauletta said. \u201cIf you read my Facebook page, everybody\u2019s saying it.\u201d \\nHowever, Philadelphia Police Lt. John Stanford insisted to the Post that \"there hasn\u2019t been any indication that race is involved in this in any shape or form.\" \\nEven still, the media hasn\\'t reported that the attack is possibly a hate crime, as LifeZette points out: \\nFriday violence as teen mob attacks Temple students, police; four arrested,\u201d read the headline on Philly.com, while the Philly Voice reported \u201cTeens arrested after flash mob leads to assaults on Broad Street.\u201d The Associated Press headline read: \u201cSTUDENTS BEATEN, HORSE PUNCHED IN MOB ATTACKS AT UNIVERSITY. \\nThe Washington Post buried the possibility in their story and then dismissed it with Stanford\\'s quote. \\nLifeZette also noted that Temple University described the attack as \"a large group of approximately 200 juveniles causing disruption along Broad Street.\" \\nMaybe Stanford is correct that it was a random attack, or maybe the black flash mob was targeting whites. But there is no doubting the media\\'s hypocrisy: if this were a flash mob of white teenagers that attacked blacks, the media would be screaming about it being a hate crime. But since the incident in Philadelphia does not advance the media\\'s racial narrative, they will not treat it in the same manner. Tags '"}, "time": 1742562275.2775564}
