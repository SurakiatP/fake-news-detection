Chris Christie of New Jersey. David Wildstein, who has confessed to coming up with the scheme to close the lanes and is cooperating with federal prosecutors in the trial of two top Christie administration officials accused of conspiring with him, described the governor and his aides as scheming for creative ways to use government resources to help Mr. Christie\u2019s   and, ultimately, his ambitions to run for president. Mr. Christie and his aides were looking for favors to hand out to officials they hoped would support the governor, he said. And they saw the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the $8      agency that runs the bridge along with other major transportation hubs and systems in the region, as a particularly sweet \u201cgoody bag,\u201d as an email revealed in court described it. The Christie administration used the agency to spread money and jobs, as well as emotionally rich gifts like pieces of mangled steel and ceremonial flags from the World Trade Center and private tours of the construction site there, Mr. Wildstein said. Mr. Wildstein, who had been hired at the Port Authority by one of the defendants, Bill Baroni, Mr. Christie\u2019s top staff appointee at the agency, recalled a conversation he and Mr. Baroni had soon after they started their jobs in 2010, establishing what they called the \u201cone constituent\u201d rule. \u201cThe only person that had to be happy was Governor Christie,\u201d Mr. Wildstein explained, adding, \u201cWe used that as the barometer by which a decision would be made at the Port Authority. \u201d \u201cHow did you know what the one constituent wanted?\u201d a prosecutor, Lee Cortes, asked him. \u201cBecause we were told by Governor Christie or a member of the governor\u2019s staff,\u201d Mr. Wildstein replied. Mr. Baroni and Bridget Anne Kelly, a former deputy chief of staff to Mr. Christie, are charged with closing access lanes to the bridge for four days in 2013 to punish the mayor of Fort Lee, the town on the New Jersey side of the bridge that was gridlocked by the closings, because he declined to endorse the governor for  . Mr. Wildstein, who arrived at the Port Authority with no transportation experience  \u2014   he had written an anonymous political blog for the previous 10 years while working at his family\u2019s textile company  \u2014   has pleaded guilty to conceiving the plan. Mr. Baroni approved it, prosecutors say, and Ms. Kelly directed it. As early as five months into Mr. Christie\u2019s first term in 2010, Mr. Wildstein testified on Friday, some of Mr. Christie\u2019s closest aides were already discussing a plan to secure endorsements from Democratic mayors to help Mr. Christie, a Republican, win a crushing and broad victory for his   three years later. With that sweeping win, the governor\u2019s aides believed, Mr. Christie could present himself as the Republican best able to win the White House in 2016. Mr. Christie and Bill Stepien, who would go on to run the governor\u2019s   campaign in 2013, said the Port Authority would be a key part of this strategy, Mr. Wildstein testified. The agency would hand out favors, but the governor\u2019s office would make the phone call or hold the photo op to announce the gifts so Mr. Christie could take credit. \u201cThe Port Authority had the ability to do things for Democratic officials that would potentially put the governor in a more favorable position,\u201d Mr. Wildstein said. By 2011, Mr. Stepien and Ms. Kelly, who worked for and later replaced him in the department in the administration that was in charge of soliciting endorsements, had begun identifying particular mayors whose support they wanted. They had started to hand out gifts  \u2014   surplus Port Authority vehicles to the mayor of Washington Township, a local grant to Springfield and, to Fort Lee, shuttle buses and firefighting equipment. In an email exchange that spring about possible World Trade Center tours for officials described by Ms. Kelly as \u201csignificant mayors,\u201d Mr. Wildstein promised that when he saw her a few days later he would be \u201cprepared to talk about other things in the Port Authority goody bag. \u201d It was a reference, he said in court on Friday, to \u201call the things the Port Authority had available to the governor\u2019s office that could be helpful to Governor Christie,\u201d including jobs and patronage positions that could be used to woo Democrats. \u201cI like goody bags!\u201d Ms. Kelly wrote back. \u201cI appreciate it. \u201d But on at least a couple of occasions, Mr. Wildstein seemed to be directing Mr. Baroni and Ms. Kelly. When the Port Authority approved sending surplus vehicles to Washington Township, Mr. Wildstein told Ms. Kelly to call the town\u2019s police chief and mayor. \u201cVery welcome news,\u201d Ms. Kelly reported back. \u201cThe chief couldn\u2019t believe he was on the gov\u2019s radar. \u201d The prosecution\u2019s case hinges on Mr. Wildstein\u2019s account the defense\u2019s, on undermining him as a kind of evil genius and a rogue operator. Mr. Wildstein himself smiled slightly as he recounted his own unusual route to power. He had his first phone call with Mr. Christie when they were both teenagers in the town of Livingston, volunteering on a political campaign. (Mr. Wildstein said he has been in politics in New Jersey for 43 years, or since he was 12.) He started the blog in 2000 to pursue a different kind of journalism, \u201cinsider politics,\u201d he said, describing his tone in writing about state officials and debates as \u201ckind of harsh, very blunt. \u201d In that decade, few people knew of his dual identity  \u2014   but among them were Mr. Baroni, Mr. Stepien and Mike DuHaime, the governor\u2019s political strategist. And when the governor came to power, Mr. Wildstein did not think he could write harshly or objectively about them. Mr. Baroni sat up rigidly at the defense table as Mr. Wildstein described him as the closest friend he had ever had, and how Mr. Baroni had hired him to be a \u201cbad cop\u201d at the Port Authority, where the governor was looking to reassert New Jersey\u2019s power in an often toxic relationship with New York State. The two men no longer speak to each other.'"}, "time": 1742564123.9853008}
