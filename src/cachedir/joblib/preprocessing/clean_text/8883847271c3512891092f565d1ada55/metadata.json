S. Congress. [In the   report issued Tuesday, the U. S. Department of Defense (DoD) warns under a subsection titled \u201cMilitary Cooperation\u201d:  As China\u2019s regional and international interests grow more complex, the PLA\u2019s [People\u2019s Liberation Army] international engagement will continue to expand, especially in the areas of PKO [peacekeeping operations] counterpiracy,   [humanitarian   relief, counterterrorism, and joint exercises. The Pentagon later adds that \u201cChina most likely will seek to establish additional military bases in countries with which it has a longstanding friendly relationship and similar strategic interests, such as Pakistan, and in which there is a precedent for hosting foreign militaries. \u201d In August 2016, Beijing reached a military counterterrorism pact with Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Tajikistan. Beijing believes terrorism, primarily stemming from Pakistan and, to a lesser extent,   Afghanistan, poses a threat to China\u2019s One Belt, One Road (OBOR) initiative, known as the 21st Century Silk Road project. As of 2015, China was the globe\u2019s   arms supplier, with Pakistan being one of its top customers. Pakistan receives more weapons from China than any other country. \u201cChina is one of only a few global suppliers of such [armed unmanned aerial vehicles  \u2014   UAV] equipment and faces little competition for sales to the Middle East and North Africa,\u201d notes the Pentagon. \u201cThis likely will result in the Middle East and North Africa surpassing   Africa as China\u2019s second largest arms export market. \u201d Pakistan and China, which consider India to be their regional foe, have agreed on the construction of the estimated $55 billion   Economic Corridor (CPEC) a component of Beijing\u2019s nearly $1 trillion modern Silk Road, officially known as Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s OBOR initiative. It appears China is using its OBOR project as justification to expand its military footprint to many of the 60 countries in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa that are involved in the ambitious project. Leaked documents recently obtained by Pakistan\u2019s DAWN purportedly revealed that Beijing is planning to use CPEC to suppress Islamic terrorism, diversity, and democracy in its   ally. It appears China is seeking to expand its military might beyond neighboring Pakistan and Afghanistan across various other countries. \u201cChina\u2019s overseas military basing may be constrained by the willingness of countries to support a PLA [People\u2019s Liberation Army] presence in one of their ports,\u201d it adds. Pakistan, the top recipient of Chinese weapons as well as other military assistance and foreign aid, is already collaborating with Beijing\u2019s military ambitions. With Pakistan\u2019s blessing, China has deployed naval ships to the Singapore   Gwadar Sea Port to safeguard the port and trade under the   Economic Corridor. From Gwadar port, China\u2019s area of operation would include a region from the Arabian Sea to the African coast, and, of course, the Gulf would be its area of operation. India is opposed to China\u2019s plan to set up military bases within its periphery. Nevertheless, China has already begun to establish military bases in the Indian Ocean, namely Djibouti and in the Gwadar port in Pakistan\u2019s Balochistan province. As has been Beijing\u2019s policy for a long time, China\u2019s goal is to isolate India. In the Indian Ocean, China intends to construct a military base network that would include Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, the Seychelles, and Djibouti, among others. The Pentagon reports: In May 2016, a large PLAN [PLA Navy] task force conducted an extensive deployment through the South China Sea, eastern Indian Ocean, and Western Pacific Ocean. The force conducted island assault training in the Spratly Islands and maritime interdiction training in the Indian Ocean before linking up to conduct an   exercise in the Philippine Sea. DoD also notes: China also continued to send submarines to the Indian Ocean, ostensibly in support of its counterpiracy patrols. In May 2016, a   powered attack submarine conducted a port call in Karachi, Pakistan, during a visit by the PLAN Commander, marking China\u2019s first port call in South Asia by a nuclear submarine. These submarine patrols demonstrate the PLAN\u2019s emerging capability both to protect China\u2019s SLOCs [sea lines of communication] and to increase China\u2019s power projection into the Indian Ocean. In what seems to be a pushback to China\u2019s ambitious OBOR project, India and Japan are embarking upon multiple infrastructure projects across Africa, Iran, Sri Lanka, and Southeast Asia. Last month, the Economic Times noted, \u201cIndia has conspicuously stayed away from the   New Silk Road, launched with much fanfare by Chinese President Xi Jinping on Sunday, because of strategic and security concerns. \u201d The   Economic Corridor is expected to run through the disputed   Kashmir (POK) a move that will certainly cause tension with India since New Delhi claims ownership of the region. China considers the growing Islamic terrorism threat it is facing to stem from Pakistan and to a lesser extent Afghanistan, according to the U. S.  Economic and Security Review Commission. Beijing and Kabul have already signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to integrate Afghanistan into the 21st Century Silk Road.   Kashmir and Afghanistan border China\u2019s autonomous and largest Xinjiang province, home to the country\u2019s Muslim Uighur minority.'"}, "time": 1742561847.7286386}
