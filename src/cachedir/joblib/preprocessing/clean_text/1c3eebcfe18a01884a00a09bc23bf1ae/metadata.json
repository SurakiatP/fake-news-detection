By Amanda Froelich \\nIntriguing eco-friendly innovations are unveiled all the time, but the floating Jellyfish Lodge is probably unlike anything you\u2019ve ever seen before. In addition to being aesthetically appealing, the lodges can purify the land, air, and water and grow nourishing food.\\nDesigner Janine Hung relays that the structures combine trash-collecting tentacles, aquaponic gardens, and a filtration system that all work to benefit the environment.\\n\\nThe solar-powered lodges utilize aquaponic technology to grow fruits and vegetables while cleaning the air with an electrostatic system. Each structure features and interior garden that thrives by filtering polluted water. Additionally, long tentacle arms which appear similar to a jellyfish\u2019s collect drifting trash without harming wildlife.\\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s not likely this design will be realized, as it only received an Honorable Mention award in this year\u2019s Biodesign Competition , reports Inhabitat . However, it\u2019s so neat we figured the concept needed to be shared.\\n\\n\\nAn intriguing feature of the lodge is that it can test water for toxicity and start the process of treating water through a unique microbial digestion chamber. Once the water is purified, it can be returned to the surrounding environment.\\nIf these structures are eventually created, they\u2019d ideally be maintained by nearby residents who could utilize the foods in their holistic kitchens .\\n\\nHung hopes that the Jellyfish Lodges are eventually constructed to serve as a solution to problems plaguing the world\u2019s waterways, including acidification and pollution .\\nImage Credit: Janine Hung \\nSource: True Activist \\n'"}, "time": 1742564245.4998548}
