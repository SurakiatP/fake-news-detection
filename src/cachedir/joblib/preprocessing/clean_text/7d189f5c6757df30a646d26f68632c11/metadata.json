While the OSC refuses to confirm the truth, they always look in to inquiries. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s OSC\u2019s longstanding policy not to confirm or deny the existence of an investigation In general, OSC opens a case after receiving a complaint.\u201d The complaint was made by Richard Painter, a former White House ethics lawyer. \\n\u201cThe F.B.I.\u2019s job is to investigate, not to influence the outcome of an election. Such acts could also be prohibited under the Hatch Act, which bars the use of an official position to influence an election. That is why the F.B.I. presumably would keep those aspects of an investigation confidential until after the election\u201d he wrote in the New York Times. \\nIf found guilty, OSC investigations usually lead to a rapid loss of employment. \\nDirector Comey certainly deserves to lose his job after throwing a wrench into the election, bowing to pressure from House Republicans and releasing an unnecessary and extremely misleading \u201cupdate\u201d on the new emails discovered in Anthony Weiner\u2019s cellphone that have nothing to do Hillary Clinton, her email server, or the election at large \u2013 all the while refusing to release the results of their likely inquiries into Republican nominee Donald Trump\u2019s relationship with Russian dictator Vladimir Putin.'"}, "time": 1742628559.225447}
