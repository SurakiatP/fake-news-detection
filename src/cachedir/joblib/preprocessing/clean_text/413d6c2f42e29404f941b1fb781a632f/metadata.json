[Mashable reports that this new   feature was already implemented in some countries in October of 2016 but will now be rolled out globally in multiple languages. Now when you search for a news item, you should see results with a tag that states which claim is being   which organization did the   and a summary of the story\u2019s credibility with a \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cfalse\u201d rating.  This feature will also be implemented on Google News, where news articles will be deemed true or false by Snopes and Politifact. Google has also stated that due to the nature of the system, some search results may return conflicting ratings depending on which organization   the story. Google has listed a number of rules for publishers to follow if they want to be included in the program. Google will also only include publishers who are  \u201calgorithmically determined to be an authoritative source of information\u201d.

Snopes   David Emery let his obvious partisanship be known in December of 2016 when he asked if there were \u201cany   Trump supporters\u201d and tweeted, \u201cIncredibly, some people actually think they have to put words in Trump\u2019s mouth to make him look bad. \u201d Google and Facebook have now appointed these organizations to act as the arbiters of truth in the digital age with little oversight from any governing body whatsoever.
