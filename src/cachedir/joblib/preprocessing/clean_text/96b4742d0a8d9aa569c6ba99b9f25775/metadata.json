Ra\u00fal Grijalva ( ) said   Donald Trump\u2019s \u201clegitimacy is in question\u201d and that he will not attend the inauguration.  Grijalva  said, \u201cI chose not to attend the inauguration. I really feel that since November 8, there are no signs that Trump is rising to the mantle of the office of a president. On the contrary, there\u2019s been no efforts at reconciliation, the attacks on Representative Lewis is a prime example. \u201d He added, \u201cI agree with John Lewis that the legitimacy is in question. And the person most responsible for the question of legitimacy, whether it is John Lewis\u2019 or mine, is Donald Trump himself. His comportment and rhetoric during the election carried on afterwards, failing to understand after an election one of the biggest responsibilities a   has and incoming president has is to reassure the country that the transfer of power with it is going to come a full understanding of the reconciliation needed among the American people. He doesn\u2019t understand that. And if there\u2019s any question of his legitimacy, whether it is the hacking by the Russians, whether it is  international, whether it\u2019s domestic that question that John Lewis has and I have and other people have has been brought about by his comportment and no one else. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742564148.3516414}
