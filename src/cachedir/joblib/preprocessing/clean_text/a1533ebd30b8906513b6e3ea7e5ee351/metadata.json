Trump after his explosive remarks challenging the objectivity of judges with Mexican or Muslim backgrounds. In an unusually coordinated series of attacks leveled from congressional offices and the Senate floor, in state capitols and sidewalk protests, Democrats excoriated Mr. Trump as racist and demanded that Republicans either stand behind his comments or condemn him and even rescind their endorsements of his candidacy. Democrats received unexpected ammunition from Mr. Trump himself, who, in an extraordinary conference call with allies on Monday, urged them to defend his criticisms of a federal judge\u2019s Mexican heritage  \u2014   and then rebuked his campaign staff for having suggested otherwise. Mr. Trump\u2019s doggedness, and his chastisement of his own aides, contributed to a sense of powerlessness among Republicans who said they increasingly saw no way to influence Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior or to convince him that his actions could hurt the party in competitive House, Senate and governor\u2019s races. Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, has held discussions with Mr. Trump about his attacks on Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel of Federal District Court, who is overseeing a suit against the   Trump University, according to a Republican briefed on the talks. But Mr. Priebus has had similar conversations over many months with Mr. Trump, to little avail. And other senior Republicans said there was confusion about whether it was worth approaching any of Mr. Trump\u2019s aides about doing an intervention with him. Republican candidates in tough races this fall were left to fend for themselves. Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire called on Mr. Trump to retract his comments about Judge Curiel, calling them \u201coffensive and wrong. \u201d Other candidates lay low. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a former rival of Mr. Trump\u2019s, and Senator Susan Collins of Maine both criticized Mr. Trump, yet neither they nor Ms. Ayotte indicated that they would reject his candidacy. \u201cI continue to hope that Mr. Trump will rethink his position and take back those words and show respect for the separation of powers doctrine that is enshrined in our Constitution,\u201d Ms. Collins said in an interview. \u201cI continue to believe in redemption. \u201d No prominent elected Republican came to Mr. Trump\u2019s defense unreservedly. And others found themselves wondering aloud what it would take  \u2014   what Mr. Trump would have to say or do  \u2014   for Republicans who have endorsed him to start jumping ship. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, another former primary rival of Mr. Trump\u2019s, urged Republicans who have backed Mr. Trump to rescind their endorsements, citing the remarks about Judge Curiel and Mr. Trump\u2019s expression of doubt on Sunday that a Muslim judge could remain neutral in the same lawsuit, given Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed ban on Muslim noncitizens entering the country. \u201cThis is the most   thing from a politician since Joe McCarthy,\u201d Mr. Graham said. \u201cIf anybody was looking for an   this is probably it,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019ll come a time when the love of country will trump hatred of Hillary. \u201d Republican hopes that Mr. Trump would tone down his language and heed advice were also undercut after he laced into his own campaign team during a strategy discussion with political surrogates. On the conference call, reported first by the Bloomberg News website and later confirmed by two participants, Mr. Trump argued that talking points sent by his campaign to his allies, directing them not to discuss the Trump University case, were ill advised. \u201cTake that order and throw it the hell out,\u201d Mr. Trump said. He then went further in excoriating his campaign staff: \u201cAre there any other stupid letters that were sent to you folks?\u201d Mr. Trump said, according to the Bloomberg News report. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons I want to have this call, because you guys are getting sometimes stupid information from people that aren\u2019t so smart. \u201d No other modern presidential campaign has unfolded like this, and gleeful Democrats have concluded that one of their best strategies for the general election is to hold Republicans accountable for each new Trump bombshell. In Indiana, state Democratic Party officials held a news conference on Monday to assail Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks about Judge Curiel, who was born in the state and graduated from Indiana University\u2019s law school. But the party\u2019s chairman, John Zody, spent even more time criticizing Gov. Mike Pence, a Republican seeking   this year, and Republican House and Senate candidates in Indiana for being \u201ccompletely silent on the fact that Donald Trump is questioning the integrity of a Hoosier. \u201d Only a few Republican officials in the state have criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s comments as inappropriate. Outside Trump Tower in Manhattan, meanwhile, Melissa   the speaker of the New York City Council, and Councilman Carlos Menchaca told reporters that Mr. Trump\u2019s comments about the judge were racist and xenophobic and reflected disrespect for the judiciary system. \u201cHe\u2019s quite literally saying Judge Curiel can\u2019t do his job because of his ethnicity. That is the definition of racism,\u201d said Ms.   who is Puerto Rican. \u201cIt\u2019s gross, it\u2019s vile, and it is not normal behavior for anyone, let alone someone running to be the president of the United States. \u201d The Democratic offensive was more systematic and effective than earlier, scattershot attempts to link Republicans to Mr. Trump\u2019s incendiary language and to his refusal to release his tax returns, among other actions. Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign was quick to act, putting out a video Monday morning that drew attention to Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks and to some critical responses to him by other Republicans. Representative Tammy Duckworth, Democrat of Illinois, accused Senator Mark Kirk, the Republican she is challenging, of being \u201ccomplicit\u201d in Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign of \u201chate and division\u201d and of dodging Mr. Trump\u2019s comments on Judge Curiel Mr. Kirk did not reply to requests for comment. Democrats in Nevada also held a news conference to draw attention to Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks, while others publicized them to reporters in Ohio and Florida. On Capitol Hill, House Democrats held a private conference call to discuss how to apply pressure on the Republican leadership. \u201cTrump\u2019s incendiary comments about Judge Curiel were the final straw,\u201d said Representative Steve Israel, Democrat of New York. He added, referring to Speaker Paul D. Ryan, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let Speaker Ryan and House Republicans spend every day criticizing Trump with one hand and endorsing him with the other. \u201d Texas Democrats are expected to try to hammer Mr. Trump when he visits their state in a week. And the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is preparing material to guide its candidates in attacking their opponents over Mr. Trump\u2019s positions. It remains very unlikely that ambitious Republicans and those on the ballot this year will publicly break with Mr. Trump until it becomes politically advantageous for them. At the moment, Mr. Trump enjoys wide support from the sort of    Republican voters whom elected officials are loath to antagonize. Mr. Rubio, who has said he would speak at the Republican convention and personally apologized to Mr. Trump for making jokes about the size of his anatomy during the primary, confirmed in a Florida television interview that he would still support Mr. Trump. Still, Mr. Trump expressed displeasure at criticism from his allies. In a Monday morning interview on Fox News, he faulted former Speaker Newt Gingrich for saying the Curiel attacks were \u201cinexcusable. \u201d \u201cI was surprised at Newt  \u2014   I thought it was inappropriate what he said,\u201d Mr. Trump said. The unified Democratic attack on Mr. Trump came on the final day of campaigning before primaries in California, New Jersey and several other states. In California, Mrs. Clinton blasted Mr. Trump as running a \u201ccampaign of insults,\u201d and said: \u201cI\u2019m waiting for him to say  \u2014   because of all the bigoted things he has said about women  \u2014   that a woman judge couldn\u2019t preside. \u201d Senator Bernie Sanders, also in California, insisted that he was still the Democrats\u2019 best hope of defeating Mr. Trump. For other Democrats, though, Mr. Trump\u2019s words were buoying hopes of a November resurgence. In a speech on the Senate floor as Congress returned from a break, the Senate minority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, sought to yoke Mr. Trump to his counterpart, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky  \u2014   and to every Republican running this fall. Mr. Reid pointed out that Mr. McConnell, interviewed on NBC on Sunday, had \u201crepeatedly refused to say Donald Trump\u2019s attacks on Judge Curiel\u2019s ethnicity are racist. \u201d \u201cThis is precisely the type of failure that gave rise to Donald Trump in the first place,\u201d Mr. Reid said. \u201cThat\u2019s because the hate emanating from Trump\u2019s mouth reflects the Republican Party\u2019s agenda here in the United States Senate for the past seven and a half years. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563193.3742113}
