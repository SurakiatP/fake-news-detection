He\u2019s going after the press he\u2019s going after the judiciary, things we\u2019re talking about. It\u2019s starting to make it seem a little bit also like America first is really white America first. Because if you look at what he\u2019s doing, he\u2019s going after immigrants. Even in the administration \u2014  the reason we know who Colin Powell and Condi Rice are is because Republican presidents appointed them to significant jobs. \u201d \u201cThis president doesn\u2019t have   Latinos, in unusual jobs in his cabinet,\u201d Simmons continued. \u201cThis is something that I think we all have to worry about. The United States of America has been moving in a direction for about 30 or 40 years, where everybody gets to participate. We have been teaching our children that. You see Democrats, progressives, but also independents on the streets because this president is moving us away from that direction. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742628337.868769}
