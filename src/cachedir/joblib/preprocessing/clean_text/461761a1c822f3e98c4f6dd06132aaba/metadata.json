Because guns are \"liberty\\'s teeth,\" Brutus is a firearms enthusiast, and a militia officer. Brutus fights to help Americans across the political spectrum wake up to the tyranny of our corporate overloads. November 4, 2016 Religion \\nI live in America, and I am happily married, with kids. I do not write this because I am more manly, or intelligent, or successful than you; I am not. I write this to share the main key to my success: patriarchal, traditional religion. \\nI am writing from my own religious convictions, which I believe are true. You are free to disagree, but you may still find value here. I have read the writings of other religions, and consider them \u201cTrue Myths,\u201d useful for their wisdom, even though I may disagree with their theology. Neomasculinity itself is a philosophy that can be accepted by people of different religions, or no religion. Modern Religion I\u2019ll find another church, thanks \\nModern religion is a feminized wasteland. God exists to impose obligations on men, and excuses women\u2019s evil acts. Faith is blind, irrational, and collectivist. \\nMen hate modern religion, which is why most churches in the West are demographically imbalanced toward women. Men are bored to death with touchy-feely sermons, endless committee meetings, female gossip, and the losers sitting in the pews around them. This is not how it should be. Patriarchal Religion That\u2019s more like it. \\nPatriarchal religion is interesting to men. It teaches that God is a man, creator of rationality, slayer of evil men, protector of the innocent: Praise be to the Lord my Rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle. (Psalm 144:1) \\nIn male-led churches, women are taught to be respectful to their fathers, husbands, and legitimate authority. They understand that their role is to raise and care for children, and support their husband\u2019s mission: Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord. (Ephesians 5:22) \\nIn patriarchal religion, female sins, like rebellion, envy, dishonesty, hypergamy, dressing and acting like a whore, and \u201chamstering\u201d or rationalizing sin are condemned: When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. (Genesis 3:6) I also want the women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, adorning themselves, not with elaborate hairstyles or gold or pearls or expensive clothes, but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to worship God. (1 Timothy 2:9-10) And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner. (1 Timothy 2:14)\u201d This is the way of an adulterous woman: She eats and wipes her mouth and says, \u2018I\u2019ve done nothing wrong.\u2019 (Proverbs 30:20) Finding A Virtuous Woman This is the unicorn I married. \\nAll women are tempted towards sins like envy, but not all women act on their impulses. In spite of what many observe in the West, I have met many virtuous women: few sexual partners before marriage, respectful, submissive to their husbands, physically fit, feminine, good mothers. Most are in the older generations, especially before the Boomers. Most are involved in traditional religion. There are fewer younger women who are virtuous, and every single one that I have met is involved in traditional religion. They tend to be more rural, from small churches. \\nTraditional religion can be extremely helpful to finding and vetting women. It provides a community with certain values that you want in a woman, and it provides reliable references for a person\u2019s character. A woman who spent her younger years \u201cout in the world\u201d and came back at 29 be a \u201cborn-again-virgin\u201d is a red flag, but a woman in her early 20s who teaches Sunday School and helps with the potluck dinners is far more likely to be wife material. The older women in the church will usually let you know if a woman is a whore. Patriarchal Religion Helps Control Women\u2019s Sinful Tendencies With proper training, woman can be virtuous. \\nTraditional religion acts as a curb (but not a cure) for women\u2019s immoral, rebellious, destructive behavior. My wife goes to a women\u2019s bible study group, where she often receives instruction from older religious women. This includes things like telling her to be submissive to me, lose weight and be healthy, not waste money, have cheerful sex on a regular basis, and to learn how to get some control over her emotions: Teach the older women to be reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but to teach what is good. Then they can urge the younger women to love their husbands and children, to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home, to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands. (Titus 2:3) \\nOne of my wife\u2019s friends once corrected her attitude toward sex, saying: \u201cyou need to view your body as a sheath for your husband\u2019s sword.\u201d She now routinely thanks me after we have sex. I am not a natural alpha, but I have little fear that my wife is going to suddenly cut off sex if I have a minor slip up. Band Of Brothers We\u2019ve got your back, bro! Deus Vult! \\nWith this great power comes great responsibility. As a patriarch, I am commanded to lead my family, instructing my wife and kids on how to act properly, with genuine love for their well-being. I must be on top of my game, be physically fit, and think rationally when my wife is irrational. I attend a men\u2019s Bible study, where we talk about leading as men. Every man in my group owns a gun, and we often go shooting together. \\nWe encourage, support, teach, and correct each other. I have had sharp, intense, discussions with my pastor and men in my church about my own character and life decisions. Things are handled like men, discussed in the open, with real-talk (not rhetorical bullshit), and masculine love and concern for each other. This has aided me in thinking deeply about my life, and correcting bad decisions I have made. \\nAwhile back we helped another man who was on the verge of divorce. He was working 100 hours a week because he would not stand up to his employer, and had no energy to lead his family. We told him that the marriage counseling he was getting was bullshit (\u201ctalk about your feelings more!\u201d), and that his slavish attitude toward his employer was making his wife lose respect for him. The women in our church also talked to his wife about choosing to be respectful and submissive, in spite of her rebellious emotions. \\nHe cut back hours at work, which enabled him able to be captain of his ship again. This, along with training his wife received, helped her become more respectful. Now, his wife is less of a bitch, and they have sex several times a week. I doubt this would have happened without patriarchal religion. Children I\u2019ve succeeded as a father! \\nWe see that our culture is toxic, feminized, and immoral. Men need a place to raise children apart from these toxins, and church is a great place to do this. My kids go to Sunday School classes where they are taught to be respectful to me, my wife, and legitimate adult authorities. We have several families with well-disciplined children that we can trust won\u2019t corrupt our kids. My wife often takes the kids for play-dates so she can socialize with wholesome women, which is a great alternative to sitting around on social media all day. Conclusion Patriarchal, traditional religion will not change female nature, but it can help restrain it. This is how past generations maintained civilization. I can confidently say that traditional religion is the main reason I can maintain a happy marriage in this cesspool of a culture. Those who are not religious might consider other institutions that may provide similar support for their marriage and child-raising.'"}, "time": 1742564102.7481725}
