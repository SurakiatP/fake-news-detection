When a Fukushima power plant was hit by the tsunami, it began releasing the largest amount of radioactive materials. Now, 3 years later, there are serious concerns about the levels of radiation contamination leaking not only into Japan, but also into the Pacific Ocean and beyond. Seems like to me that mainstream media does not even want to cover this topic nor do they want to warn the masses. Instead they are working hard on suppressing the truth from getting out to the public. This video brings you an inside look into what\u2019s really going on in Fukushima \u2013 and you may be extremely surprised by what you see and hear. Please SHARE this powerful video.
