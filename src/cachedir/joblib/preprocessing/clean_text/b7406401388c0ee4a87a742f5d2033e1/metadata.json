The panels and keynotes and forums have broken up, and you head off to get a drink with a handful of attendees. Are you on the record? Suki Kim, a New York Times   author, found herself in such a situation when she attended a book festival in Brisbane, Australia, over the weekend. After listening to a controversial keynote address on racial and cultural identity, Kim and a few other authors retreated to a small room in the hotel for what was billed by the conference hosts as an \u201c \u201d private conversation over cocktails. But four days later, Kim found herself quoted in The New York Times, in a piece in which she criticized another prominent author by name, lamenting that his and other books by white males on topics similar to her book\u2019s tended to be better received. Kim was outraged, and still is, that the Times reporter Rod Nordland, who she acknowledges speaking with at the event, would quote her for an article. Nordland is the Times Kabul bureau chief and is himself a recent author of a book on Afghanistan. That\u2019s the basis on which he was invited to the book festival, and to the smaller reception: he wrote a book. Kim says she knew Nordland was a journalist (she considers herself a journalist as well) but she says she had no idea they were having an    conversation for a story. They were at a book festival, after all, one exclusively for authors, and Nordland never mentioned he planned to write an article for The Times. That\u2019s Kim\u2019s version of events. But the more interesting fact is that\u2019s Nordland\u2019s version too. I spoke to both of them by phone after Kim wrote to the public editor\u2019s office Tuesday, angry that she had been quoted by name in the story. \u201cThis is so unethical. It\u2019s not acceptable what he did,\u201d Kim said from Seoul, South Korea. \u201cI would never talk about another writer in public. It\u2019s so ungenerous and tacky. \u201d Nordland agrees about the circumstances of their meeting: it was authors only, in a hotel room, with eight to 10 people. But Nordland insists that because Kim knew he was a journalist, she should have had an expectation that the conversation was on the record. He also says that at the time of their conversation, he didn\u2019t have any plans to write a story about the conference. \u201cI don\u2019t consider that kind of stuff off limits,\u201d Nordland told me from London. \u201cI\u2019ve been in many social situations and someone might say, \u2018By the way, that\u2019s off the record.\u2019 She didn\u2019t say that. \u201d Nordland also notes that Kim made similar comments the previous day at a larger forum, during which she complained that white males who do investigative journalism for a book are generally taken more seriously than women of color (she is  ). But Kim says that she didn\u2019t mention any male authors by name at the more public event. A review of the Facebook Live video of the event confirms her version. I found Kim\u2019s argument and perspective compelling and asked Phil Corbett, the editor who oversees issues of ethics and standards for the newsroom whether Nordland had complied with newsroom policy in this circumstance. Here\u2019s his reply: That seems like a stretch to me in this case. I believe Kim did have an expectation of privacy at this \u201c\u201d \u201cprivate\u201d gathering  \u2014   as the literature promoting the event described it. She was discussing books with a man she knew was an author and journalist, just like her. And there was no mention of any story. Kim is insisting, unsuccessfully, that the quote be removed. Disagreements between sources quoted in stories arise with some regularity in newsrooms. They are difficult to sort out and take any action on because it quickly turns into one person\u2019s recollection against another\u2019s. What\u2019s unusual about this case is the agreement over the circumstances  \u2014   Nordland acknowledges he didn\u2019t ask to quote Kim or mention any story. That strikes me as outside the bounds of good journalistic practice. If Nordland didn\u2019t know until the next day that he intended to write a story, he should have gone back to Kim and asked whether she was willing to be quoted. Or he should have quoted what she said the previous day at the event captured on video for the general public  \u2014   the version that didn\u2019t attack an individual author. I believe editors should speak to Nordland and make clear that his approach did not meet Times standards and was not good journalistic practice. I also believe a note should be attached to the piece saying that a portion of Kim\u2019s remarks were inappropriately obtained at a private event. Unfortunately for Kim, at this point in the publication cycle it probably makes no sense to remove the passage. That\u2019s too bad, because Kim had every expectation of privacy, and didn\u2019t get it.'"}, "time": 1742561997.346485}
