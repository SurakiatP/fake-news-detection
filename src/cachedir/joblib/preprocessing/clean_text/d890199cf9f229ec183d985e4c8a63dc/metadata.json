We are told definitively that has not happened. Those devices are currently in the FBI field office here in Washington, D.C. and are being exploited. \\n\u201cThe source points out that any immunity deal is null and void if any subject lied at any point in the investigation.\u201d \\nFurther, elaborating suspicions about aide Huma Abedin\u2019s now-estranged husband\u2019s laptop causing the FBI to relaunch its investigation, Real Clear Politics notes, \u201cAgents have found emails believed to have originated on Hillary Clinton\u2019s secret server on Anthony Weiner\u2019s laptop. They say the emails are not duplicates and could potentially be classified in nature.\u201d \\nWhile Baier\u2019s sources, being unnamed, are impossible to verify, the FOX report comes on the heels of reporting by the Wall Street Journal \u2014 also citing unnamed sources \u201cfamiliar\u201d with the same investigation \u2014 which states, \u201cSecret recordings of a suspect talking about the Clinton Foundation fueled an internal battle between FBI agents who wanted to pursue the case and corruption prosecutors who viewed the statements as worthless hearsay.\u201d \\nThose sources, paraphrased by the WSJ , explained, \u201cAgents, using informants and recordings from unrelated corruption investigations, thought they had found enough material to merit aggressively pursuing the investigation into the foundation that started in summer 2015 based on claims made in a book by a conservative author called \u2018Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.\u2019\u201d \\nInter- and intra-agency disputes over the strength of evidence surrounding the pay-to-play allegations against the Clinton Foundation left senior officials at both the FBI and DOJ at odds with lower-ranking investigators, who felt that \u2014 in combination with \u2018Clinton Cash\u2019 and the aforementioned recordings \u2014 promising leads deserved to be pursued. \\nInternal discord spilled into the public arena recently when FBI Director James Comey took the highly anomalous step of publicly announcing the investigation had been re-started \u2014 sparking condemnation by President Obama, politicians, and other officials about potentially influencing the looming election. \\nPartly fueling the internal squabble over investigating the foundation are those who blame Comey\u2019s second-in-command, \u201cdeputy director Andrew McCabe, claiming he sought to stop agents from pursuing the case this summer. His defenders deny that, and say it was the Justice Department that kept pushing back on the investigation,\u201d the WSJ reports. \\nWhile FBI agents continued making headway in an informal probe to decide whether a full investigation was warranted, official in the Justice Department began objecting to their actions, under the premise the evidence was flimsy at best \u2014 despite further statements from informants and additional information beyond what had been presented in \u201cClinton Cash.\u201d \\nAs the WSJ describes: \\n\u201cFBI investigators grew increasingly frustrated with resistance from the corruption prosecutors, and some executives at the bureau itself, to keep pursuing the case. \\n\u201cAs prosecutors rebuffed their requests to proceed more overtly, those Justice Department officials became more annoyed that the investigators didn\u2019t seem to understand or care about the instructions issued by their own bosses and prosecutors to act discreetly.\u201d \\nFriction between the DOJ and FBI reached a pivotal point when a \u2018senior Justice Department official\u2019 summoned McCabe to a meeting over the perception agents had rebuffed instructions from superiors not to pursue the investigation further. \\n\u201cAre you telling me that I need to shut down a validly predicated investigation?\u201d the WSJ quoted McCabe asking the official. \\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d the DOJ official is said to have replied. \\nWhether or not quashing a deeper investigation into the Clinton Foundation had, in actuality, been the Justice Department\u2019s intent may never be clear \u2014 but given the overlapping dates of this bickering and the FOX News report of the yearlong probe, it would seem the Clintons are still very much treading water.
