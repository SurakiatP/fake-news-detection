Ali, who died Friday at 74, recited doggerel, danced in the ring, taunted his opponents and converted to Islam. And, as he told us, he was pretty. Cosell was homely, with an adenoidal voice and a collection of toupees. But at his best, he could call a boxing match with dramatic brio, articulate complex issues, narrate football highlights with astonishing skill and little preparation, and, as he often said, \u201ctell it like it is. \u201d ABC Sports, Cosell\u2019s employer, carried a lot of Ali\u2019s fights, so Cosell was at ringside, inside the ring interviewing Ali and his opponents after fights, or in the network\u2019s studio interviewing Ali. Their camaraderie produced an entertaining union of spirited opposites and a     pairing for the times. One man, Ali, understood racism the other, Cosell, experienced  . And neither could stop talking. Ali spoke to many other journalists, but he and Cosell seemed inseparable: teasing and challenging each other, and   in suits and ties. Ali often threatened to strip off Cosell\u2019s toupee du jour, and in their jokey    each man said the other would have been nothing without him. \u201cEvery time you open your mouth, you should be arrested for air pollution,\u201d Ali once told Cosell, who responded, \u201cYou would still be in impoverished anonymity in this country if I hadn\u2019t made you. \u201d Beneath the stagecraft of their relationship was Cosell\u2019s support of Ali, whether by no longer calling him Cassius Clay when others, like his opponent Ernie Terrell, persisted, or by excoriating the New York State Athletic Commission for stripping him of his heavyweight title in 1967 after he refused induction into the Army. They were so tied in the public mind that the columnist Dave Kindred wrote a dual biography of the men, \u201cSound and Fury,\u201d in 2006. \u201cHad they been practitioners of traditional humility, their extraordinary talents alone would have demanded that attention be paid,\u201d Kindred wrote. \u201cBut there was nothing traditional about Ali and Cosell. A thimble would have contained their humility with room left over for an elephant. \u201d One day in January 1974, shortly before Ali and Joe Frazier\u2019s rematch of their epic bout three years earlier, they joined Cosell at the ABC Sports studio to review film of the first fight. Dennis Lewin, a longtime producer at the network, recalled: \u201cNormally when we had two people for Howard to interview with contrasting views, we sat Howard between them, but I wanted the two of them together to have the byplay better. I didn\u2019t realized it would lead to a fight. \u201d Indeed, when Ali brought up Frazier\u2019s hospitalization after their first bout, Frazier grew enraged, rose to his feet and asked Ali why he called him ignorant. \u201cSit down, Joe,\u201d Ali said, but Ali got to his feet and they began wrestling on the studio floor, as stagehands and the fighters\u2019 entourages tried to restore order. Cosell never got out of his chair, narrating the   as if it were a prizefight and trying to determine who was clowning and who was serious. \u201cIt\u2019s a bad and ugly scene,\u201d he said, \u201cand it\u2019s unfortunate that it happened as we showed this extraordinary fight. \u201d Frazier left angrily, leaving Ali alone with Cosell. Ali was petulant afterward and tried to rationalize why he had called Frazier ignorant. Cosell kept prodding Ali back to analyzing the first epic bout. Cosell sounded annoyed, yet paternal, as he tried to bring Ali back to the day\u2019s goal. \u201cI\u2019m going to represent Joe, as a devil\u2019s advocate,\u201d Cosell said. \u201cYou have to be a devil to represent Joe,\u201d Ali said. Lewin witnessed many   encounters and saw in them two \u201cgifted and highly intelligent performers\u201d who could \u201cplay off each other on any level. \u201d \u201cThey had genuine respect for their mutual talents and what they could do for each other,\u201d he said. \u201cClearly, they both enabled each other\u2019s careers. \u201d Both men\u2019s health declined, Ali from Parkinson\u2019s disease, Cosell from multiple problems. In 1992, when Ali celebrated his 50th birthday on a television special, the ailing Cosell offered his greetings in a prerecorded segment that showed his emotional side, without bombast or gibes. \u201cFifty years old,\u201d he said, \u201cI never thought that could happen, not to you. But it has, and you know something? You are exactly who you said you are. You never wavered. You are free to be who you want to be. \u201d Cosell paused, choking up, and added, \u201cI love you. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628501.9414217}
