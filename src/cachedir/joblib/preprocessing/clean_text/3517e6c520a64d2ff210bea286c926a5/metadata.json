In fact, herbicide use has increased . \\n\u201cAn analysis by The Times using United Nations data showed that the United States and Canada have gained no discernible advantage in yields \u2014 food per acre \u2014 when measured against Western Europe, a region with comparably modernized agricultural producers like France and Germany,\u201d an October 29 Times article stated. \\nTimes researchers compared data from Europe, where genetic modification was rejected, with that from Canada and the United States, where they are widely used. The data goes back 20 years and indicates that GM technology did not deliver on some of the promises that its promoters made. \\nIn fact, herbicide use has increased by 21 percent in the U.S. while it has decreased by 36 percent in France\u2019s, Europe\u2019s largest agriculture producer. GMO seeds have led to a decrease of about 33 percent in insecticide and fungicide use in the U.S., but France has seen an even larger decrease \u2014 65 percent \u2013 without using genetically modified crops. \\nAs the weather begins to warm, you\u2019ll want to switch over to more heat-tolerant greens. Consider lettuce varieties such as Red Butterworth and Larissa or spinach varieties such as Tyee or Emu. Post navigation'"}, "time": 1742628426.7669857}
