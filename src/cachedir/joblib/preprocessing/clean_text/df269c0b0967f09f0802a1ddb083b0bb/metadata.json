Both Title IX and Title VII rely on the consistent, uniform application of national standards in education and workplace policy. \\n\u201cA nationwide injunction is necessary because the alleged violation extends nationwide. Defendants are a group of agencies and administrators capable of enforcing their guidelines nationwide, affecting numerous state and school district facilities across the country.\u201d \\nNow in another ruling prompted by demands from the Obama administration, O\u2019Connor has affirmed the decision \u2013 again.
