Your whole day would be ruined. That\u2019s Russia for you; they don\u2019t care about your tea. They will invade your fridge and leave you with nothing\u201d. \\nThe NATO chief warned that the failure of countries such as France, Germany and Italy to take the threat of Russian aggression seriously could lead to a future loss of breakfast, lunch and dinner in millions of homes. \\nSpeaking to several fridge owners on the street today, WWN asked whether families are prepared for an imminent Russian fridge invasion, and what they would do if such a terrible thing happened here. \\n\u201cI\u2019d probably go to the shop and buy more food,\u201d said one frightened woman we spoke to, who will probably purchase some kind of fridge locking mechanism later today, \u201cI could think of worse things to happen, if I\u2019m honest. It\u2019s just a fridge, like\u201d. \\nAlong with today\u2019s fridge warning, NATO has also asked Eastern European countries to check under their beds every night for Russian invaders, and if there is any suspicious activity to contact one of the many local US military bases in the area.'"}, "time": 1742562405.5836549}
