One of our best performing offices, generating strong D early vote,\u201d he wrote. \u201cLesson: keep organizing while they bs.\u201d \\nWPCO reports the incident was a repeat from the 2012 election, when the local campaign office received the exact same donation. The party has since installed video cameras, however, and are hoping the investment pays off. \\n\u201cWe have cameras, so the perps will hopefully be responsible for their actions,\u201d the party posted to its Facebook page, WHIO reports.
