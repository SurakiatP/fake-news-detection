Simone Biles, the gymnast some call the best in history, was crowned the   gymnastics champion at the Rio Olympics. Her teammate Aly Raisman came in second. Here\u2019s a   of two of Biles\u2019s signature moves. With a win in the   individual medley, Michael Phelps earned his thirteenth individual gold medal, surpassing Leonidas of Rhodes, who won 12 gold medals in the ancient Olympics. Another achievement for the books: Simone Manuel became the first   woman to win an individual event in Olympic swimming. Our full coverage of the Games is here  \u2014   including the odd version of the U. S. national anthem being played at medal ceremonies. _____ 2. Hillary Clinton rejected the economic agenda Donald Trump laid out this week, calling him an enemy of \u201cthe little guy. \u201d He wants to \u201cgive trillions in tax cuts to people like himself,\u201d she said, while deepening the financial pain of the middle and working classes. Neither candidate, however, has said much about helping people who are not working  \u2014   many of them living in abject poverty. _____ 3. Mr. Trump faced down critics of his unorthodox campaign style, telling an interviewer, \u201cIt\u2019s either going to work or I\u2019m going to, you know, I\u2019m going to have a very, very nice long vacation. \u201d After weeks of hearing detractors saying a Trump presidency would be a grave threat to national security, Mr. Trump has begun portraying Mrs. Clinton and President Obama as   of the Islamic State. He held a rally in Kissimmee, Fla. in the evening. _____ 4. The F. B. I. has widened its investigation into what officials believe was a Russian cyberattack directed against the Democratic Party. The attack appears to have been far larger than first thought, raising the possibility of more damaging disclosures like the emails published recently by WikiLeaks. After a   impasse that has kept the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, holed up in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, Sweden has agreed to question him there over rape accusations. _____ 5. Almost 55 miles a gallon  \u2014   that\u2019s what U. S. regulators say automakers\u2019 fleets must average by 2025. Engineers, racing to meet the mark, are working with new batteries for hybrids. Some cars are going on a superglue diet:   adhesives, like the one being used on the GMC Acadia above, can stiffen seams and allow components to be made of thinner steel. _____ 6. The animated \u201cSausage Party,\u201d opening nationwide this weekend, sends   foodstuffs ranging through the supermarket for 89 minutes of bawdy, silly humor  \u2014   and a deeper layer. Characters voiced by Seth Rogen, Kristen Wiig, Edward Norton, Michael Cera, Bill Hader and others end up in a classic confrontation between comforting religious beliefs (weekend shoppers are gods who will liberate them) and scientific thought (their actual fate). Our reviewer saluted \u201cthe intellectual rigor of a project that probably didn\u2019t require it\u201d and called the movie \u201cfun pretty much all the way through. \u201d _____ 7. Fox News has not managed to put a   scandal behind it, despite rapidly forcing out its chairman, Roger Ailes. More women have come forward to describe a culture of intimidation and misogyny, including a former Fox host, Andrea Tantaros, above. Top Ailes deputies who remain are being accused of abetting Mr. Ailes\u2019s behavior. _____ 8. \u201cI found the numbers heartbreaking. \u201d That was a senior U. S. health official, commenting on a new study that found high rates of rape, bullying, depression and other harms suffered by gay, lesbian and bisexual teenagers. The survey found that they make up about 8 percent of the high school population, or 1. 3 million students. Future studies are likely to include an option for students to identify as transgender. Above, a youth contingent at Miami\u2019s gay pride march in April. _____ 9. U. S.  forces seized most of the coastal Libyan city of Surt, a stronghold of the Islamic State. But in Syria, the battle between government forces and rebels has left two million people in the city of Aleppo  with critical shortages of food and water. If the turmoil in the Mideast seems too overwhelming to grasp, this could help. A   team spent more than a year charting the catastrophe that has befallen the Arab world since the invasion of Iraq in 2003. At   words, it\u2019s not a quick read, but it is a remarkably clear account that connects the region\u2019s history and the Arab Spring uprisings to the creation of the Islamic State and the global refugee crisis. _____ 10. One of our   articles today focuses on the pharmaceutical giant Abbott Laboratories and its operations in India\u2019s highly competitive drug market. A Times investigation found that managers pushed workers to pursue sales in violation of Indian law, medical standards and the company\u2019s own ethics guidelines. One of the country\u2019s top salesmen jumped in front of a train last month, leaving a note that said he was committing suicide because of the pressure. Above, his daughter. _____ 11. Finally, Mongolia, a sparsely populated country with nomadic traditions, will be pioneering a novel   system next month. The country is adopting an app created by a British   What3Words, that looks up a unique   code (dissident. sloth. ploy, for instance) for every    patch of the earth\u2019s surface  \u2014   all 57 trillion. Users enter an address or position a pointer on a map to retrieve the code, which the postal service can then use for deliveries. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern.
