The same principle applies to our daily wastes. \\nIn case you did not know it, Americans are among the most wasteful civilization in history. Actually, I would dare to say that we are the champions, my friends, and that\u2019s nothing to be proud of. \\nWe waste at an incredible rate: absolutely anything, including food, where we lead the world by a wide margin. Also, as a nation, the United States generates more municipal solid-waste per person/per day than any other developed/industrial country in the world, boasting 7.1 pounds of solid waste a day, per person. \\nIf you crunch these numbers\u2013 365 days a year x 330 million people x 7.1 pounds of solid waste \u2013 you\u2019ll come up with astonishing numbers. \\nPutting Waste to Work for Energy \\nIt was a Greek philosopher who once said 2000 years ago that nothing gets wasted \u2013 everything gets transformed, or something along these lines. To follow this guy\u2019s axiom, we can transform waste into an excellent and basically perpetual source of energy . \\nWe, the preppers, can help mitigate the \u201cdisaster\u201d and put that amount of waste to good use, by making briquettes using daily wastes. \\nBriquettes are traditionally defined as compressed blocks of combustible material \u2013 usually coal dust, wood chips, paper, peat or sawdust \u2013 that are used to start a fire. The terms derives from the French language and it means \u201cbrick.\u201d \\nBiomass briquettes are starting to become all the rage nowadays and daily waste is basically biomass. Traditionally, biomass briquettes are built from agricultural waste and they\u2019re used as a \u201cgreen\u201d replacement for hydrocarbons (coal, oil etc) in all sorts of applications, including industrial stuff like heating boilers and whatnot. \\nCurrently, almost half of the world\u2019s population is using charcoal and/or wood for heating and cooking purposes. \\nCutting the forest for subsistence farming or for cooking your food or heating your home is not a great idea if you have better alternatives, and that\u2019s the whole purpose of technology: making the world a better place and improving   humans, right? \\nAny household can reduce their need for charcoal and wood by creating their own fuel so to speak, by making \u201cfuel briquettes\u201d using waste plant material which is readily available in their own environment. \\nHow to Make the Briquettes \\nSo, what type of wastes can be re-used for making fuel briquettes? Paper Charcoal fines Any other type of agricultural waste. \\nIt\u2019s important to realize that not all waste is created equal, and this is where the calorific value of each type of waste comes into play. \\nAs a general rule of thumb, the aforementioned materials are the best when it comes to DIY fuel briquettes (sawdust, paper etc), but you\u2019ll have to use a home-made press for achieving legendary status, i.e becoming energy self-sufficient as much as humanly possible. \\nThere are also commercially available presses. You\u2019ll just have to look for them on the internet or in   \\nThe fuel briquettes are being made around the world using mini Bryant and Peterson presses. You can also make them by hand or using a plastic mold. Video first seen on The Do It Yourself World . \\nYou can also use a plastic mold. Video first seen on The Do It Yourself World . \\nBasically, you can use a plastic bottle or any other type of plastic container in order to shape the briquette. You\u2019ll also need something that you can use as a piston that fits into the respective container to press it, in order to get the water out of the mix. You can use something like a tin can or a piece of wood as the piston along with a plastic bag, a knife and some wire. \\nHere\u2019s a cool idea about DIY-ing a mold-press biomass fuel briquette using an old DVD container. The possibilities are basically endless. \\nVideo first seen on nobodyprepper . \\nHow to Make Briquettes in Easy Steps \\nStep 1 \u2013 preparing the briquette mix \\nFor example, if you\u2019re going to use waste paper and sawdust (the simplest to DIY and very efficient and cost effective), you\u2019ll have to soak the paper in water for a couple of days in order to soften it and to allow the fibers to be released, as these fibers will later bind the materials together. \\nIn the next step, you\u2019ll have to thoroughly homogenize the soaked paper using your hands until the stuff reaches the consistency of porridge or mashed potatoes, i.e. no pieces are evident in the \u201csoup\u201d. This step is very important but it takes some time and you\u2019ll have to do it well. \\nTo speed up the process, you can use tools such as a mortar and pestle or a dedicated pounding tool for processing the paper mix quickly and more efficiently. \\nThe simplest mix for homemade briquettes consists of one part soaked paper and 3/4 parts sawdust. You can also add pine needles, rice husks, chopped leaves/grass, charcoal fines and any other flammable materials you can think of into the mix, as they\u2019ll add to the flavor. You\u2019ll have to use roughly 20% paper though \u2013 that\u2019s the lesson to be taken home. \\nYou can alternatively swap paper for cassava peels/flour, which can replace the paper\u2019s binding properties into the sawdust-mix. You\u2019ll have to boil the cassava until it gets very soft, but in sufficient amounts, the cassava paste will successfully replace the paper for the purpose of binding the sawdust together. \\nIn the next step, you\u2019ll have to mix the paper or cassava mixture with the sawdust along with enough water. The mix must hold together if squeezed; that\u2019s how you determine the ideal consistency. \\nStep 2 \u2013 prepare the press \\nThis step depends on whether you\u2019re using a cool home press or an improvised device. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re on the low-tech side and you\u2019re using a plastic bottle mold as an improvised briquette-making device. \\nYou\u2019ll have to cut the upper quarter of the plastic bottle (a soda bottle will do) and perforate the bottom, making 10-12 drainage holes. You can use a hot wire to burn the holes. \\nThen you\u2019ll require a thin plastic bag to be used as a liner to help you remove the finished briquette from bottle. Don\u2019t forget to punch drainage holes in the plastic bag too, both on the sides and in the bottom, so the water can be expelled during the pressing process. \\nObviously, you can use something bigger than a plastic bottle, like a plastic bucket or a plastic flower pot. Ideally you\u2019ll have two of each: one for playing the role of the mold and the second to act as a piston. Don\u2019t forget to put drainage holes in the plastic liner though \u2013 otherwise, the water won\u2019t drain and you\u2019re wasting your time. \\nStep 3 \u2013 press the mix \\nIn this step, you\u2019ll have to put a quantity of briquette-mix inside the plastic liner (bag) and then insert the bag into the mold. Then you\u2019ll have to add more mix to the bag and press it with the improvised piston (a can, the other bucket/another bottle or whatever fits into the mold) so the water gets pushed out of the mix. \\nPush as hard as you can \u2013 the harder the better. Then you\u2019ll have to pull the bag out of the mold and here\u2019s your first briquette, folks. \\nStep 4 \u2013 dry your briquettes \\nBut it\u2019s not over yet. You\u2019ll have to dry your briquettes for about a week outside in the sun. If they\u2019re not properly dried, the briquettes will smoke when burned and that\u2019s unpleasant to say the least. \\nIf you can\u2019t improvise a mold and/or a press, you can always make fuel-briquettes with just your hands, squeezing the mix in your bare hands and building fuel balls and you\u2019ll have to dry these out too, obviously. \\nThere are so many survival things you can do by yourself.   discover   wood creations. \\n\\n  5 total views, 5 views today'"}, "time": 1742561630.2615693}
