S. courts seek to block President Trump\u2019s executive order restricting some travel into the country, Italian populist leader Matteo Salvini has sharply criticized the move as politically motivated. [The leader of Italy\u2019s Northern League party (La Lega) told Breitbart News Friday that Trump is paying the price for keeping his campaign promises, facing the wrath of a \u201csystem in rebellion\u201d and federal judges who have been \u201cpoliticized. \u201d  Salvini said that Trump\u2019s executive order was a \u201cproper, useful and courageous response to a real threat,\u201d one that European leaders should emulate. Leaders of both individual European states as well as of the European Union have been notoriously ineffectual in responding to the grave migrant crisis afflicting the continent. The head of Italy\u2019s Lega told Breitbart that he had nothing but admiration for the U. S. President\u2019s ability to act on his campaign promises, \u201csomething that seldom happens in Italy. \u201d Salvini, who aspires to govern Italy, said he would do the same thing Trump has done: \u201cI would rely on intelligence services to close Italy\u2019s borders to those countries considered a threat to national security,\u201d he said. Even though President Trump must now deal with strong internal protests against his actions, Salvini said, \u201che will move forward with courage, emboldened by the knowledge that he has the majority of American citizens on his side, as evidenced by the election outcome. \u201d From early on, the League\u2019s leader has been a vocal advocate of Trump\u2019s ascendance to the White House, setting him apart from Italy\u2019s other political parties. During the campaign cycle last April, Salvini traveled to the United States to meet Trump personally and pledge his support. \u201cOn many issues we see    with President Trump and we look forward to partnering with his administration,\u201d Salvini told Breitbart Thursday, declaring his party to be a logical ally of the Trump administration. Salvini has noted many similarities between the platform of his party and that of the Trump administration, spanning beyond immigration to the idea of a flat tax to boost the economy to financial penalties for companies that outsource and opposition to international economic treaties that damage the national economy. \u201cOur battles on these issues are perfectly in tune,\u201d he told Breitbart, \u201cand we also agree on limiting the role of expensive supranational structures like the U. N. and NATO. \u201d Follow Thomas D. Williams on Twitter Follow @tdwilliamsrome'"}, "time": 1742563394.5130117}
