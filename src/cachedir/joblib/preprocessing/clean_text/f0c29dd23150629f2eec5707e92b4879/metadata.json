How long will the international community tolerate its vicious persecution of millions of defenseless people? \\nHow long will its longstanding slow-motion genocide policy be allowed to continue unchallenged? \\nEvery day is Kristallnacht in Palestine, especially in lawlessly blockaded Gaza under siege, subject to Israeli terror-bombing and incursions at its discretion, slaughtering civilians indiscriminately because who\u2019ll intervene responsibly to stop the horrors Palestinians endure. \\nIn his first report to the UN General Assembly, Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in Palestine Michael Lynk described deplorable conditions, unacceptable, yet persisting, with nothing in prospect likely to change things without international community intervention. \\nCalling for an end to nearly half a century of illegal occupation, he said that \u201c[t]he Palestinian economy is without parallel in the modern world. Israel\u2019s occupation is denying Palestine\u2019s right to development and severely hampering its ability to attain even the minimum targets of the Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ).\u201d \\nIsrael systematically breaches fundamental international laws unaccountably. Apartheid worse than South Africa\u2019s is institutionalized. State terror is official policy. Israel treats Palestinians the way Hitler persecuted Jews. \\n\u201cPoverty is rising,\u201d said Lynk. \u201cUnemployment is rising to epic levels. Food insecurity is becoming more acute. The Palestinian economy is becoming more stifled and less viable under the occupation. Israel\u2019s deliberate fragmentation of [Occupied Palestine] and lack of development has negatively impacted human rights.\u201d \\nConditions are \u201cseriously deficient in its respect for the legal principles and obligations embedded within the right to development.\u201d \\n\u201cThe deepening of the occupation, the constriction of basic human rights and the utter absence of a political horizon leading to self-determination for the Palestinians have reinforced an atmosphere of despair and hopelessness.\u201d \\nPraising regional human rights groups for their courage and commitment to justice, Lynk explained that \u201c[t]hey face scorn and worse . . . If a just and compassionate peace is ever to come to the Middle East, we will owe much to these fearless advocates.\u201d \\nIn mid-October, in testimony before Security Council members, B\u2019Tselem Executive Director Hagai El-Ad called for UN action to end nearly half a century of illegal Israeli occupation. \\nIsraeli UN envoy Danny Danon accused him of \u201cdefam[ing] us in front of the international community.\u201d Israel threatened to revoke his citizenship. \\nHuman rights workers for Palestinian liberation risk life and liberty. El-Ad concluded his remarks, saying: \u201cFor most of my country\u2019s existence, the world has allowed it to occupy another people. I have lived my entire life, every single day of it, with that reality.\u201d \\n\u201cMillions of Israelis and Palestinians know no other reality. We need your help. Fifty years of \u2018temporary\u2019 occupation are too long for even a single person on this planet to accept such a contradiction in terms.\u201d \\n\u201cThe rights of Palestinians must be realized; the occupation must end; the UN Security Council must act; and the time is now.\u201d \\nStephen Lendman lives in Chicago.
