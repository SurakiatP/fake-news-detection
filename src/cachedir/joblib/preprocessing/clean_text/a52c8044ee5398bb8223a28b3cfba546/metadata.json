But before heading to the nearest field to fly the devices, recipients may want to check their insurance coverage. \u201cI\u2019m sure there will be a lot of drones given as Christmas gifts, and we\u2019ll start to see more   claims,\u201d said Chris Hackett, the senior director for personal lines at the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America, an industry group. Demand for drones has surged because of their lower cost and expanded capabilities. More than 577, 000 people  \u2014   many of them owners of multiple drones  \u2014   have registered as hobby drone operators as of early December, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The Consumer Technology Association estimates that about 1. 2 million drones will be sold this holiday season. Drones are highly maneuverable, and they can carry cameras to record spectacular vistas from the air. But accidents do happen: Recently, news outlets reported that a drone being used to record a wedding reception in New Hampshire injured two guests, who later sued the groom. \u201cThere are a lot of unfortunate things that can go wrong,\u201d said Christie Alderman, a vice president at Chubb Insurance. Generally, if you are using a drone for personal purposes and it injures someone or damages their property, your standard homeowner\u2019s insurance policy would provide liability coverage up to the policy\u2019s limits, said Mr. Hackett. (If you are using a drone to make money  \u2014   even if it is a sideline, like photographing property for a real estate business  \u2014   that would not typically be covered by a homeowner\u2019s policy). It is always wise, however, to check with your insurance carrier on the specifics of your policy, said Loretta Worters, a spokeswoman for the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group. Some insurers may exclude   incidents from their policies  \u2014   and those that do not do so now may decide to eventually, as the number of drones taking to the skies increases and insurers learn more about the cost of   claims. \u201cGenerally speaking, we evaluate every claim on its own merit,\u201d said Justin Herndon, a spokesman for Allstate, in an email. \u201cWe continue to follow the evolution of drones and its impact on our customers\u2019 policies. \u201d It is also a good idea to reduce your risk by brushing up on drone operational and safety rules, Ms. Alderman said. The F. A. A. requires that hobby users fly drones at or below 400 feet, and keep them within sight. The agency offers a safety video on its website. Also, the Academy of Model Aeronautics, which charters more than 2, 500     clubs, works with other groups and the F. A. A. to promote safety guidelines and instruction through the Know Before You Fly initiative. Simulation software that can help you learn to fly a drone on a home computer is available for about $100, said Chad Budreau, director of public relations and government affairs for the model aeronautics group. Here are some questions and answers about drones: What other insurance options are available? One option for hobbyists: If you join the Academy of Model Aeronautics, you will receive group liability coverage as a benefit of membership. (Membership is $75 for adults, free for those under age 19.) The academy\u2019s insurance policy, issued by a specialty insurer, typically pays out after your homeowner\u2019s policy is exhausted, and it provides $2. 5 million in liability coverage for property damage or bodily injury. What if my drone is lost or damaged? Homeowner\u2019s policies typically cover replacement of personal belongings, which would include a drone. But most policies have a deductible  \u2014   say, $500. So unless you have a very expensive drone, it may not be worth filing a claim, Ms. Worters said. Do I have to register my drone? Federal rules now require recreational owners to register any drone  \u2014   or \u201cunmanned aircraft system,\u201d in F. A. A. parlance  \u2014   flown outdoors. Drones weighing a   to 55 pounds can be registered online on the agency\u2019s website the fee is $5 per person, can be applied to as many drones as you own and is good for three years. Failure to register a drone can be costly: The F. A. A. says generally it aims to educate operators, but can impose civil fines of up to $27, 500, and criminal penalties can be much higher.'"}, "time": 1742564472.0720425}
