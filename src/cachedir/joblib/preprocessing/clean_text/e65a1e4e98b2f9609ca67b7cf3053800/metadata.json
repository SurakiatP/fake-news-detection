The logo of a   sneaker brand is a silhouette of him flying through the air. But on Twitter, Michael Jordan is a loser. For the past two years, a photograph of Jordan crying, snapped at his 2009 induction into basketball\u2019s Hall of Fame, has been grafted onto any sports figure who has suffered humiliation or defeat. No one is seemingly safe from the Crying Jordan treatment. When the New England Patriots lost to the Denver Broncos in the N. F. L. playoffs this year, Tom Brady got Crying Jordaned. He\u2019s joined by the University of North Carolina mascot Rameses and the Villanova band member who cried as she played the piccolo during her team\u2019s stunning N. C. A. A. tournament defeat last year. Recently, Jordan\u2019s cry face has transcended sports. It has graced the cracked Liberty Bell, losing Powerball numbers and that picture of Marco Rubio on a gigantic chair. When it was announced that Harriet Tubman would replace Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill, the president\u2019s face got hit. Now you can Crying Jordan your friends: The \u201cCrying Jordan Meme Generator\u201d app, which serves up little Crying Jordan cutouts, has been downloaded more than 40, 000 times since its February release. The internet thrives on humiliation. Twitter is always raring for a public shaming. The Crying Jordan meme, which takes one of America\u2019s biggest sports stars and makes him small, indulges those impulses, but it also works on another level as a corrective to online  . The meme\u2019s hold over online culture offers clues about our ambivalent relationship to alpha males in 2016. \u201cIt takes somebody so good, so dominant  \u2014   the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me  \u2014   and it makes him into an international figure of epic failure,\u201d said David Okun, a software developer who created the app. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s so great about it. \u201d But the Crying Jordan meme radiates affection even as it burns. \u201cMemes are used as a weapon,\u201d said Limor Shifman, a lecturer at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem who studies digital culture. \u201cBut at the very same time, the weapon creates a kind of affinity between the groups that are fighting, because everybody gets the joke. \u201d By the way, \u201cMichael actually thinks it\u2019s funny,\u201d his spokeswoman, Estee Portnoy, said. The meme pokes fun at a person\u2019s failures, but it also turns them into an   game, one in which everyone messes up, and everyone receives the same absurd rebuke. It helps that the Crying Jordan often mercifully obscures the shamed person\u2019s face. It\u2019s a little like putting a   over a  . If the meme drags Michael Jordan\u2019s image down with it, his   persona can take the hit. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make you feel bad, like a picture of a crying kid would,\u201d said Courtney M. Cox, who studies the intersection of sports and technology at the University of Southern California. \u201cHe\u2019s the greatest basketball player ever. The lowest we\u2019ve ever seen him is crying at the Hall of Fame. \u201d Crying Jordan recalls other memes inspired by famous men caught in introspective moments. There is Sad Kanye, a meme based on a candid photograph of Kanye West looking dejected on a   tour, and Sad Keanu, which plays off a paparazzi photo of Keanu Reeves eating a sandwich alone. \u201cThere\u2019s an element of flawed masculinity at play,\u201d Ms. Shifman said. \u201cYou have a masculine star who expresses vulnerability, and people simultaneously mock and celebrate that. \u201d The Jordan meme can be read as straightforwardly emasculating: Watch a grown man cry. But it also works as a criticism of traditional maleness. The meme revels in the contradiction between Jordan\u2019s legendarily aggressive persona and his   tears. The joke probably couldn\u2019t work with any other sports star: Magic Johnson was a   passer, Tom Brady is a   but Jordan\u2019s dominance on the court was matched only by his nerve. He came back from retirement  \u2014   twice. And his Hall of Fame speech, in which he resurrected old feuds, extended that reputation. \u201cJordan is the ultimate alpha male, and this was his alpha male moment,\u201d a columnist for ESPN  wrote after the event. Only in the snapshot does he look oddly pitiful: eyes red, shoulders slouched, cheeks shiny with tears. The meme makes fun at the guy who cried like a little girl over what a big man he was. It\u2019s not a coincidence that the Jordan meme took off just as N. B. A. stars used the sport\u2019s biggest stages to model humility and playfulness. Modern masculinity in basketball is Kevin Durant, the most valuable player of 2014, calling his mother \u201cthe real M. V. P. \u201d It\u2019s Stephen Curry ceding the spotlight to his daughter Riley at a news conference. The meme seems to share that sense of perspective. Some iterations of the Jordan meme work as bizarre visual gags: replacing Michael Jackson on the cover of \u201cThriller\u201d making up James Harden\u2019s beard with layer upon layer of Crying Jordans. Other variations rely on sheer volume: As the Oklahoma City Thunder stumbled in the N. B. A. playoffs, every Thunder fan visible in the stands became a target. Perhaps the most technologically advanced and contextually creative Crying Jordan plays off LeBron James\u2019s pregame ritual. When he tosses some chalk above his head, an ephemeral Crying Jordan appears, then dissipates into the air. When Jordan made a rare public appearance in April, showing up at an N. C. A. A. tournament game at his alma mater, North Carolina, the meme threatened to turn meta. Sure enough, the Tar Heels were upset and, in countless tweets, so was Jordan. \u201cMemes, they come and they go, but this is unlike any I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Mr. Okun, the app\u2019s creator, said. \u201cIt keeps feeling like it\u2019s going to die, and it doesn\u2019t. It only gets bigger. \u201d He added, \u201cI hope it never stops. \u201d After all, the meme has helped extend Jordan\u2019s legacy, if not exactly honor it. \u201cI just hope that when kids say: \u2018Mommy? Daddy? Who\u2019s that crying basketball guy? \u2019,\u201d Mr. Okun said. \u201cThey tell them: \u2018That\u2019s the greatest basketball player of all time. That\u2019s Michael Jordan. \u2019\u201d'"}, "time": 1742561671.0122812}
