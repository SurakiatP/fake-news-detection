The world\u2019s most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. \\n\u201cIn fact, the history of the recent financial crisis, which doubles as a history of the rapid decline and fall of the suddenly swindled dry American empire, reads like a Who\u2019s Who of Goldman Sachs graduates.\u201d \\nObviously Soros wants to be like Goldman Sachs. Phil Butler puts it well when he says: \u201cGeorge Soros has a finger in every political pie there is. If there is a crisis on our world, it\u2019s a safe bet he\u2019s had a hand in it.\u201d \\nOne can say that Soros and Goldman Sachs are ideologically part of the same brotherhood. Their strategy is a little different, but the end result is the destruction of lives via the economic system (be it capitalism or socialism) and political manipulation. \\nThat\u2019s why Soros seems to think that he is invincible. He thinks he can move the political and economic planet in a few blinks of an eye and no one can tell him to stop. In fact, he writes books such as The Alchemy of Finance. Soros thinks he can kill political stability throughout Europe and indeed in America with no challenge. \\nSoros is certainly old, but he doesn\u2019t want to be obsolete. His organization has recently been caught conducting covert operations designed to destabilize Russia. Here is an interesting quote from the leaked files of Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundation: \\n\u201cOur inclination is to engage in activities and with actors that will understand and counter Russian support to movements defending traditional values\u2026Naming and shaming from us is problematic: we are also in the business of channeling money into other countries for political purposes.\u201d '"}, "time": 1742562763.2417154}
