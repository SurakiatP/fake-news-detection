The denial of the historicity of the two Jerusalem Temples and the Temple Mount as recounted in both the Old and New Testaments is a terrible indictment of the international community when repeatedly adopted by an important UN body. \\n\u201cThe outrageous repudiation of the millennia-old bond between Judaism and its holiest shrines in Jerusalem is a blatant attempt to rewrite history,\u201d he added. \u201cThe annals of both our religions cannot be erased by raised hands and counted votes.\u201d \\nEdelstein said the time has come for the international community to pass a resolution reaffirming Jerusalem as the holy city for the three major monotheistic religions, \u201ca city where the two Temples stood and from which the Word of G-d was first promulgated to humanity by our prophets.\u201d \\nEducation Minister Naftali Bennett called UNESCO\u2019s decision \u201ca denial of history, and history will erase the embarrassing decision.'"}, "time": 1742564409.2027683}
