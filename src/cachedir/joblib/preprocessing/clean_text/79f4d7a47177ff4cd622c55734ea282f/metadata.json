He also has a recent obsession with Donald Trump. \\nIn a video allegedly posted by Greene and discovered by Buzzfeed , the soon-to-be cop killer records himself having an altercation with police officers on October 14. In a comment below the video, he says: \\n\u201cI was offended by the blacks sitting through our anthem. Thousands more whites fought and died for their freedom. However this is not about the Armed forces, they are cop haters.\u201d \\nIronically, the video mostly featured Greene yelling at various cops about his rights while they try to escort him from a high school property. A selfie taken at the game shows why witnesses found Greene to be disturbing the peace. Greene decided to bring his Confederate flag to the stands with him. \\nNaturally, Greene\u2019s neighbors say he came out hard for Trump several weeks ago, even placing a large Trump/Pence 2016 sign in his yard. Neighbor tells me that shooting suspect Scott Michael Greene put this Trump sign in his yard approx 2 weeks ago. pic.twitter.com/8HjtthB51I \\n\u2014 Grant Rodgers (@GrantMRodgers) November 2, 2016 \\nNot exactly a surprising development considering the Republican candidates uncanny ability to collect endorsements from neo-Nazis, KKK leaders, and other hate groups. Also not surprising: The typically loud-mouthed Trump has been dead silent about the fact that his own supporter is allegedly involved in the execution of two police officers. Ditto for many of the same Republicans who rushed to baselessly blame Hillary Clinton and President Obama of inciting violence against cops every time they can. \\nIowa\u2019s own Rep. Steve King (R) had this inflammatory remark to say just after the Dallas police shooting: #DallasPoliceShooting has roots in first of anti-white/cop events illuminated by Obama\u2026Officer Crowley. There were others. \\n\u2014 Steve King (@SteveKingIA) July 8, 2016 \\nBut only \u201cprayers\u201d for the victims in this latest shooting. Our hearts & prayers are for 2 Des Moines police officers murdered early this morning, for families & all officers. https://t.co/iyIuxabHei \\n\u2014 Steve King (@SteveKingIA) November 2, 2016 \\nAnd after three officers were killed in Baton Rouge, Trump lashed out. President Obama just had a news conference, but he doesn't have a clue. Our country is a divided crime scene, and it will only get worse! \\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 17, 2016 \\nBut now that one of his own supporters murdered two officers, he\u2019s become more careful. Praying for the families of the two Iowa police who were ambushed this morning. An attack on those who keep us safe is an attack on us all. \\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 2, 2016 \\nNotice he didn\u2019t bothered to condemn the violence perpetuated by his own follower. That would take an ounce of class and Trump has never been able to find that for sale. \\nFeatured image via YouTube \""}, "time": 1742562549.8161273}
