But Italy\u2019s president, Sergio Mattarella, said in a statement that he had asked Mr. Renzi to delay stepping down until Parliament passes a budget for 2017. \u25a0 Mr. Renzi had said he would resign after voters rejected changes to the Constitution that he supported in what amounted to a referendum on the prime minister\u2019s government. \u25a0 The decision to hold a referendum is another example of why political scientists say such votes are often \u201cmessy and dangerous. \u201d \u25a0 The results represented another victory for   movements in Europe. \u201cTimes have changed,\u201d said Beppe Grillo, the leader of the populist Five Star Movement. As promised, Mr. Renzi submitted his resignation to Mr. Mattarella on Monday evening at the Quirinale Palace, the president\u2019s official residence, but the president asked Mr. Renzi to defer his resignation to see through the approval of his government\u2019s budget. \u201cGiven the need to complete the parliamentary process to approve the budget law,\u201d Mr. Mattarella asked Mr. Renzi to postpone stepping down until the budget, now being discussed in the Senate, had been passed, according to the statement from the president\u2019s office. An official from the office said the budget was expected to be passed this week. Mr. Mattarella\u2019s request was not unusual: His predecessor, Giorgio Napolitano, had \u201cfrozen\u201d the resignations of two prime ministers so that pending laws could be passed. Before his meeting with the president, Mr. Renzi briefly conferred with his cabinet at the Chigi Palace, the prime minister\u2019s residence in Rome, where the night before Mr. Renzi announced in an emotional news conference, \u201cthe experience of my government ends here. \u201d Once Mr. Renzi\u2019s resignation eventually takes effect, Mr. Mattarella will work with Italian political leaders to discuss what comes next.  \u2014   ELISABETTA POVOLEDO and JASON HOROWITZ Italy greeted the news of Mr. Renzi\u2019s symbolic defeat with uncertainty on Monday. A headline in the daily La Repubblica declaring, \u201cThe No Triumphs, Renzi Quits,\u201d echoing the sentiment in most newspapers. Commentators acknowledged Mr. Renzi\u2019s dignified reaction to what mostly seemed a vote against his tenure, and they called for responsibility from political forces. \u201cNow the reality is the risk of a return to the swamps and to instability,\u201d Mario Calabresi, editor in chief of La Repubblica, wrote in a   editorial on Monday. \u201cA scenario that Italy really doesn\u2019t need. \u201d Once Mr. Renzi\u2019s resignation is official and he steps down, Mr. Mattarella would then hold talks with the political parties trying to form a caretaker government or call early elections. According to the Italian news media, one candidate who could lead a temporary government is Economy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan, a technocrat. The speaker of the Senate, Pietro Grasso, a longtime   magistrate, is also a possibility. Although most opposition parties are pushing for quick elections, opponents of Mr. Renzi in his Democratic Party are more inclined to take their time.  \u2014   GAIA PIANIGIANI Beppe Grillo, the leader of the Five Star Movement who campaigned against the proposed constitutional changes and against Mr. Renzi, declared on Monday that \u201ctimes have changed. \u201d How much so may depend on Mr. Grillo\u2019s ability to parlay his latest success into a full sweep of the political establishment he has thumbed his nose at for years. Mr. Grillo, a former comedian, said that Italians should waste no time pressing for a new electoral law and for the dismantling of the old order. \u201cYou should vote as soon as possible,\u201d he said in a blog post on Monday to rally his supporters against the usual jockeying by parties for power in a caretaker government. \u201cThe parties will do anything to drag their feet,\u201d he said. The Five Star Movement won a quarter of the vote in 2013 national elections. Mr. Grillo said then that cooperating with traditional parties in any sort of alliance would be akin to capitulation. \u201cThe existing political class must be expelled immediately,\u201d he said in an interview at that time with The New York Times.  \u2014   JEFFREY MARCUS A breakdown of returns shows that opposition to the constitutional changes was widespread, though more pronounced in the south. Only three regions backed the changes: the historically leftist areas of Tuscany and   in central Italy, and   Adige in the far north. In the economically struggling Sicily and Sardinia, which voted against the changes, the divide between the camps was as large as 44 percentage points. The pattern was similar in areas with high unemployment and social problems. \u201cThe country isn\u2019t growing, and voters blamed their personal condition on the government,\u201d said Stefano Folli, a commentator for La Repubblica. The results also reflected a generational divide. According to a survey reported by the news channel Sky TG24, young voters rejected the proposed changes, while more than half of those over 55 supported them.  \u2014   GAIA PIANIGIANI In analyzing the results, Italian pundits did not always agree, except on one point: the severe consequences for Mr. Renzi. \u201cDoes Renzi represent the country from a political, cultural point of view? Yesterday\u2019s vote is a clear rejection of Renzi\u2019s economic policies and of how he envisioned the country,\u201d the political commentator Mario Sechi said. Mr. Renzi \u201cdoesn\u2019t represent the zeitgeist of the nation, which did not follow him,\u201d he added. For Mr. Sechi, the Five Star Movement is the clear victor, even if the \u201cno\u201d campaign brought together divergent political forces. Sergio Fabbrini, director of the Luiss School of Government in Rome, said the outcome was less clear. Rejection of the constitutional changes was actually a reaction to Mr. Renzi\u2019s \u201creformist program that in some way threatened a big part of the social political equilibrium,\u201d he said. The nearly 60 percent of the population that voted against him is \u201chighly divided, with nothing in common, and no leader,\u201d Mr. Fabbrini said. What joins them is a conservative,   outlook. \u201cWithin that, you have the most extreme left and right. \u201d The person to watch in the short term is Mr. Mattarella, the president. \u201cThis is the first real test of the president of the Republic, who has kept mostly in the background,\u201d said Antonio Polito, deputy director of the   daily Corriere della Sera.  \u2014   ELISABETTA POVOLEDO The euro recovered from early losses, and European stocks edged up. It was a muted reaction, in part because a vote against the constitutional changes had been expected, giving investors time to adjust their portfolios. Also, political instability in Rome is not unusual. But analysts said Italy was not in the clear, and there is potential for market turmoil in the case of government paralysis and of delays to plans to fix Italy\u2019s ailing banks. The euro first fell as much as 1. 5 percent against the dollar in Asian trading after the vote, but recovered by the morning in Europe, and it even gained ground compared with last week. Major European stock markets were all slightly higher.  \u2014   JACK EWING The vote results and Mr. Renzi\u2019s decision to step down drew a jubilant response from other populist leaders in Europe. \u201cItalians have disavowed the E. U. and Renzi,\u201d Marine Le Pen, the head of the National Front in France, wrote on Twitter. \u201cWe need to listen to this thirst for nations\u2019 freedom and for protection!\u201d With polls predicting that Ms. Le Pen will reach the 2017 presidential election runoff, she has sought to build an   platform calling for a \u201cFrexit\u201d and a \u201cPeople\u2019s Spring. \u201d The vote in Britain to withdraw from the European Union, known as Brexit, and Donald J. Trump\u2019s recent victory in the United States have put wind in her sails. The   Dutch politician Geert Wilders, who recently refused to attend his   trial, used Twitter to congratulate \u201cItalia + Matteo Salvini,\u201d a reference to the leader of the   Northern League.  \u2014   BENO\u00ceT MORENNE Writing in Italy\u2019s leading economic newspaper, Il Sole 24 Ore, the columnist Guido Gentili said that after the referendum, Italy needed to show through actions and legislation that it \u201cis not impermeable to reform. \u201d The image of Italy as a nation that \u201cbobs more or less happily in stagnant water between the third largest public debt in the world and a banking system in a deep coma\u201d must be \u201cvigorously contested,\u201d he wrote. Vincenzo Boccia, the president of Italy\u2019s main business lobby, Confindustria, said the referendum results highlighted the need to tackle pressing economic issues like \u201cdebt, deficit and   growth. \u201d \u201cGrowth is the only way to eliminate inequalities and poverty,\u201d he said in a statement issued Monday morning. Italian companies have been making \u201ccrucial efforts\u201d to compete in international markets, he added, and need the government to back them up.  \u2014   ELISABETTA POVOLEDO The populist victory in Italy was hailed by many   leaders across Eastern Europe, where similar sentiments are on the rise, but their reaction was tempered by widespread concern that the results would accelerate the fraying of the European Union, upon which the region has come to depend. Poland, the largest economy in the region, seemed torn between praising a victory by populists who share its governing party views and worrying about vulnerability to Russia. \u201cThis would be a major blow not just for the E. U. but for the eurozone,\u201d Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski said in an interview with Polish state radio. \u201cWhat will the future bring?\u201d Tomas Sedlacek, chief macroeconomic strategist in Prague for the lender CSOB, tied the Italian defeat directly to Mr. Trump\u2019s victory and predicted a dire future. \u201cDemocracy, and the future of the euro in Europe, is truly walking on the edge of a knife,\u201d he said. In Slovakia, where   sentiment is widespread, many residents say that embracing the currency led to higher prices for everyday goods. \u201cWe can expect a referendum about leaving the eurozone,\u201d predicted Richard Zulik, leader of Slovakia\u2019s liberal Freedom and Solidarity party.  \u2014   RICK LYMAN Finance ministers from the 19 countries that use the euro expressed relief that the economic reaction to the Italian referendum was muted. Yet the vote could still roil the European Union: It threatens to embolden opponents of the single currency, which could destabilize the Italian economy and foment turmoil in the banking sector. Helping to stoke that concern is Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, Italy\u2019s oldest lender, which faces questions about whether it has sufficient capital. Asked whether a planned capital increase for the bank would now be delayed, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the president of the   Eurogroup of finance ministers, emphasized that Italy first needed to select a new leader. Even as Brussels scrambled to stave off negative financial consequences, ministers from fiscally hawkish countries like Germany and the Netherlands will not want to be seen by their own electorates as being overly permissive toward Italy.  \u2014   JAMES KANTER'"}, "time": 1742628343.3321042}
