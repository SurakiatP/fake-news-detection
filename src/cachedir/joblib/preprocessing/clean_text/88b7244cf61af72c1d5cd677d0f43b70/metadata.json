The guests stayed at the   Grandover Resort and enjoyed a stream of activities, from a golf tournament to snacking in the hospitality suite. The bride was always there to ensure that details were executed flawlessly and that guests were mingling and happy. For a few hours on that Saturday, however, Mrs. Spinrad, 30, who now lives in Atlanta with her husband, Kyle Spinrad, took a break from playing the perfect host to go on a   run with her father. Escaping her guests to exercise may have seemed odd since she was already inundated with activities and wanted to be there for everyone. But this was her tradition with her dad, something she always did when she was home, and it was a chance for them to connect and relax. In retrospect, it was one of the best decisions she made. Before the run, she felt stressed, worrying about how everything was going. Afterward, she had a clear head and a new perspective. \u201cMuch of that weekend was a blur to me, but I actually remember that run,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a sense of normalcy, a chance to say, \u2018Everyone is here, everyone is happy, and we\u2019re O. K.\u2019 It was my relaxing moment. \u201d She didn\u2019t get upset even when she had to move the ceremony inside because of rain. Most brides and grooms feel jittery, said Allison   a psychotherapist based in     Mass. who specializes in counseling   . Couples have the logistical stress of pulling off a wedding and dealing with all of the people and perspectives involved. They are also going through an emotional transformation. \u201cYou are making this profound identity change, and you are doing it in public, and you don\u2019t know how you are going to react,\u201d Ms.   said. \u201cIt\u2019s overwhelming, and that\u2019s O. K. It should be. \u201d Instead of being caught off guard by that tension, some brides and grooms are taking creative steps to calm themselves on the big weekend, some not all that far removed from having their teddy bears accompany them down the aisle. Some, like Mrs. Spinrad, are reserving time to exercise. Ben Oberman, 32, a doctor in Durham, N. C. was particularly nervous about his wedding because some relatives disapproved of his fianc\u00e9e, now his wife, Jacquelyn Scott Oberman. \u201cI knew part of my family wasn\u2019t going to be there,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought, was I alienating my family? Was everything going to be fine?\u201d Dr. Oberman and his best man took off on a hike in a petrified forest near the wedding site in Sonoma County, Calif. He shared his fears, rehearsed his vows and took in the natural beauty around him. By the end of the trail, he was ready to get married. \u201cIt was a soothing environment, and I was with someone I could trust and who would be there for me no matter what,\u201d he said. Rachael Babington, a Manhattan yoga instructor, has received so many requests from women who wanted to attend a class before their weddings that she started the company Brides Love Yoga. In the busy summer, she has two clients a day. She arrives at sites with a yoga mat and shows brides poses that help to open their hearts and focus their minds. Mrs. Spinrad said it could be strange to do something restorative on your wedding day. \u201cIt\u2019s already a   experience that is already supposed to be all about you, so you don\u2019t necessarily think you need to take time for yourself,\u201d she said. \u201cBut that means you have to do things to keep your perspective even more, because everything else seems like the biggest deal. \u201d Before leaving for her rehearsal diner at the Atlantic Golf Club in Bridgehampton, N. Y. last September, Claudia Davidson, 28, who works for UberEats in Washington, packed her clutch. Alongside her wallet and lip balm she put in a piece of her childhood blanket, which her late grandmother made. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of something I take with me when I feel like I need backup,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew I was going to be overwhelmed being in the center of attention, so it was nice to have a little sentimental keepsake in my purse just in case. \u201d She turned to it during her rehearsal dinner, but felt confident enough to forgo it on her wedding day. Ms.   said: \u201cI\u2019ll call that a transitional object. Bringing along something that brings you comfort, why not? You are feeling vulnerable. \u201d Laurie Mehlman, 31, of Marietta, Ga. let her mother slip a red ribbon, an item that Jewish tradition says wards off evil, into her shoe before her wedding ceremony. \u201cI had just started getting nervous, and having that little connection calmed me down,\u201d she said. Her husband, Ross Mehlman, 30, had his own batch of nerves. \u201cI think it was the   and everyone looking at you and you have to make a speech and everyone wants to talk to you that night,\u201d he said. He dealt with his another way: He and his groomsmen watched his college team play football on television. \u201cIt quickly morphed from me sitting in a temple in a conference room waiting for my wedding to me and my best friends sitting around chilling out,\u201d he said. Some people ask mental health professionals to help them with their anxiety. Hillary Evans, a hypnotherapist in Charleston, S. C. has brides come to her many reasons: They want to lose weight and can\u2019t, they are fighting with relatives or friends, they are obsessing over details or they are terrified of giving their speeches. She uses traditional hypnosis to give them new perspectives. She teaches them how to visualize their success and slow down moments so they don\u2019t get out of control and can be savored. Ellyn Gamberg, a psychotherapist in New York, encourages clients to see weddings as rehearsals for real life. \u201cHow you navigate what you do in preparing for the wedding and the actual wedding day will be the exact same issues, the same concerns, the same fears, the same dynamics with people and within your self that you will have to struggle with for the rest of your life,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I say, \u2018Get them right during the process so you get them right for life. \u2019\u201d She spends months, even years, helping clients figure out the roots of their anxieties. But sometimes even that is not enough. Every year she attends many ceremonies, just to be there for clients in case they panic. \u201cPeople bring things to weddings, their baby blanket, their pet, their lucky charm,\u201d Dr. Gamberg said. \u201cAnd some people bring their therapist. It makes them feel better. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562471.434361}
