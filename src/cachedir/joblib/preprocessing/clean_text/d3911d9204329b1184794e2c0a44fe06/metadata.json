Is there anything to it? Is Trump, in essence, Putin\u2019s puppet, as Clinton claimed in the third debate? \\nIn an interesting twist of logic (if one can use that word to describe the incoherent and dissonant arguments made by a woman who still denies \u2014 despite mountains of evidence to the contrary \u2014 that she sent and received classified data over her unsecured, private e-mail server), Hillary Clinton at once claims that Russia is responsible for the hack of the servers of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in late spring and that there is no way her server was hacked by anyone. Leveraging the anti-Russian sentiment to its fullest, she and others in the DNC have sought to shift the focus away from what was on the servers and toward blaming Russia for the hack. After all, if Russia is trying to throw the election to Trump, wouldn\u2019t the patriotic vote be for Clinton? \\nBy the time WikiLeaks announced that a trove of damning documents and e-mails would be published on the Internet, Clinton and the DNC (along with their lapdog media) were already in full-blown \"it was Russia\" mode. On the same day that a video of Donald Trump emerged in which he can be heard bragging of his sexual abuse of women \u2014 which he has since claimed was just \u201clocker room talk\u201d \u2014 WikiLeaks began a rolling release of the promised leaked documents. Both of these stories deserved media attention . Only one got it. \\nBy the time the media was ready to report anything on the WikiLeaks dump, it was to speculate as to what part Russia played in the initial hack. Clinton \u2014 in her role as the staunch anti-Russian \u2014 used the timing of the second debate to attack Trump for the video and his supposed ties to Russia, which she plainly blamed for the leaked documents, saying to moderator Martha Raddatz: But, you know, let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s really going on here, Martha, because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election. And WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information, we don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s accurate information, and then they put it out. We have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election. And believe me, they\u2019re not doing it to get me elected. They\u2019re doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump. \\nClinton went even further in the third debate , bringing up Putin in an attempt to dodge a question about a leaked document showing that she gave a speech to a foreign bank in which she said, \u201cMy dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders.\u201d She \u2014 again \u2014 put the emphasis on the fact that WikiLeaks was providing the leaked documents rather than on what the leaked documents have to say. Then she claimed, on the authority of \u201c17 of our intelligence agencies,\u201d that Russia was behind the hacked and leaked documents: But you are very clearly quoting from WikiLeaks. And what\u2019s really important about WikiLeaks is that the Russian government has engaged in espionage against Americans. They have hacked American websites, American accounts of private people, of institutions. Then they have given that information to WikiLeaks for the purpose of putting it on the Internet. This has come from the highest levels of the Russian government, clearly, from Putin himself, in an effort, as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed, to influence our election. \\nTrump rebutted by bringing the conversation back on topic (not his usual strongest point), saying: She wants open borders. People are going to pour into our country. People are going to come in from Syria. She wants 550 percent more people than Barack Obama, and he has thousands and thousands of people. They have no idea where they come from. And you see, we are going to stop radical Islamic terrorism in this country. She won\u2019t even mention the words, and neither will President Obama. So I just want to tell you, she wants open borders. Now we can talk about Putin. I don\u2019t know Putin. He said nice things about me. If we got along well, that would be good. If Russia and the United States got along well and went after ISIS, that would be good. He has no respect for her. He has no respect for our president. And I\u2019ll tell you what: We\u2019re in very serious trouble, because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads \u2014 1,800, by the way \u2014 where they expanded and we didn\u2019t, 1,800 nuclear warheads. And she\u2019s playing chicken. Look, Putin... \\nAt this point, Clinton interrupted to say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s because he\u2019d rather have a puppet as president of the United States.\u201d \\nSo, getting past the he-said-she-said, what are the facts as we know them? \\nOn Monday, the New York Times reported that after conducting a months-long \u201cinvestigation into a Russian role in the American presidential campaign\u201d in which \u201cagents scrutinized advisers close to Donald J. Trump, looked for financial connections with Russian financial figures, searched for those involved in hacking the computers of Democrats, and even chased a lead \u2014 which they ultimately came to doubt \u2014 about a possible secret channel of email communication from the Trump Organization to a Russian bank,\u201d the FBI \u201csees no clear link\u201d between Trump and Russia. Of course, in typical leftist fashion, the Times not-so-gently insinuates that the FBI is guilty of pulling punches in the investigation. Interestingly, the Times seemed to miss that that is exactly what happened in the FBI\\'s investigation into Clinton\\'s e-mail server. \\nAs for Clinton\u2019s claims that the purpose of the hacked and leaked documents and e-mails was to influence the election for Trump, the Times article admits: Law enforcement officials say that none of the investigations so far have found any conclusive or direct link between Mr. Trump and the Russian government. And even the hacking into Democratic emails, F.B.I. and intelligence officials now believe, was aimed at disrupting the presidential election rather than electing Mr. Trump. \\nAlso on Monday, Slate published an article claiming that a server belonging to Donald Trump was \u201ccommunicating in a secretive fashion\u201d with servers in Russia. By the next day, the Washington Post had debunked the Slate article, saying, \u201cThat secret Trump-Russia email server link is likely neither secret nor a Trump-Russia link.\u201d Based in part on an interview with Naadir Jeewa, who \u201cdoes consulting work on precisely the sorts of systems involved in\u201d the scenario involving the server Slate claims was acting as a conduit between Trump and Russia, the article by the Post explains: To understand what\\'s likely happening, we need to establish a few basics. First of all, the Trump server wasn\\'t really a Trump server. It was much less of a Trump email server, for example, than Hillary Clinton\\'s email server was hers. Clinton had a physical server that hosted her email. The trump-email.com domain that Alfa was connecting to was hosted by a company called Cendyn. Cendyn runs marketing systems for the hospitality industry, meaning that it offers an out-of-the-box solution for a company that owns a bunch of hotels to push out sales pitch emails to its customers. In other words, trump-email.com isn\\'t the email server Trump used to send emails from his closet. It was a domain name that linked back to a Cendyn server. This is important for a few reasons. The first, Jeewa said, was that the trump-email.com was configured to reject a certain type of query from another server. Since its job was simply to push out thousands of enticements to come stay at Trump Soho (or whatever) it didn\\'t need to receive many incoming requests (like incoming email). The second is that the conspiracy theory hinges on Trump\\'s team using an offsite server hosted by someone else for its quiet communications with its Russian allies. Instead of, say, their own server, under their own control. Or an encrypted chat app. Or a phone call. \\nThis writer has to admit to being amused to see the shoe on the other foot (or the tinfoil hat on the other head, in this instance) as the Left trots out wild conspiracy theories to create a Trump-Putin connection to make Clinton retroactively correct. In point of fact, Clinton might be better off trying to implicate Trump in the Kennedy assassination. \\nBut, what about Clinton\u2019s assertion that WikiLeaks is releasing documents pilfered by Russia for the sake of influencing the election for Trump? Aside from the FBI saying that there does not appear to be any attempt to influence the election for Trump, Julian Assange, the founder and public face of WikiLeaks, denies that Russian hackers are his source. \\nIn an upcoming documentary made by Dartmouth Films, Assange speaks of the \u201cClinton camp\u201d putting forth a \u201chysteria that Russia is responsible for everything.\u201d He goes on to say, \u201cHillary Clinton has stated multiple times, falsely, that 17 US intelligence agencies had assessed that Russia was the source of our publications. That\u2019s false \u2014 we can say that the Russian government is not the source.\u201d \\nFurthermore, the Kremlin denies Clinton\u2019s claims. Russian presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov called the claims \u201cnonsense.\u201d While that \u2014 in and of itself \u2014 would not carry much weight, when it is added to the body of evidence that includes Assange denying the Russian connection, the laughably far-fetched lengths to which the Left will got to promote easily debunkable conspiracy theories, the FBI stating that there is \u201cno clear link\u201d between Trump and Russia, and Trump himself denying that he has any dealings with Russia, it\u2019s fairly easy to see that the only thing there is to see here is an imploding campaign by the woman who \u2014 the last time she occupied 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue \u2014 claimed that her husband\u2019s impeachment was the result of a \u201cvast right-wing conspiracy.\u201d \\nSome things never change.
