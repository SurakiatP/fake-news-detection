Far from being dead, vinyl records sales rose to $416 million last year, the highest since 1988, and artists like the Black Keys, Lana Del Rey and Beck are eagerly embracing the format. Instant   cameras have caught on among millennials and their younger siblings. A new Pew survey shows that print books remain much more popular than books in digital formats.   paper notebooks and erasable whiteboards are the   technology among many Silicon Valley types, and even typewriters are enjoying a renaissance in today\u2019s     era. In his captivating new book, \u201cThe Revenge of Analog,\u201d the reporter David Sax provides an insightful and entertaining account of this phenomenon, creating a powerful counternarrative to the   belief that we would live in an     world. Mr. Sax argues that analog isn\u2019t going anywhere, but is experiencing a bracing revival that is not just a case of nostalgia or hipster street cred, but something more complex. \u201cAnalog experiences can provide us with the kind of   pleasures and rewards digital ones cannot,\u201d he writes, and \u201csometimes analog simply outperforms digital as the best solution. \u201d Pen and paper can give writers and designers a direct means of sketching out their ideas without the complicating biases of software, while whiteboards can bring engineers \u201cout from behind their screens\u201d and entice them \u201cto take risks and share ideas with others. \u201d \u201cThe choice we face isn\u2019t between digital and analog,\u201d Mr. Sax asserts. \u201cThat simplistic duality is actually the language that digital has conditioned us to: a false binary choice between 1 and 0, black and white, Samsung and Apple. The real world isn\u2019t black or white. It is not even gray. Reality is multicolored, infinitely textured, and emotionally layered. \u201d And it\u2019s often analog  \u2014   perhaps less efficient, less perfect, less speedy  \u2014   which best captures those human imperfections, creating a tactile interface with the world. A growing number of artists have noticed that music made on old tape machines and vintage studio equipment sounds different  \u2014   \u201cmore heartfelt, raw, and organic,\u201d in Mr. Sax\u2019s words  \u2014   than music made with the latest, most sophisticated technology. Listeners, too, as the musician Jack White has observed, find that vinyl has a romance, a magic that doesn\u2019t come with the click of a mouse: \u201cWith vinyl, you\u2019re on your knees. \u201d He continued: \u201cYou\u2019re at the mercy of the needle. You watch the record spin and it\u2019s like you\u2019re sitting around a campfire. It\u2019s hypnotic. \u201d In these pages, Mr. Sax takes us on a spirited tour of the resurgent analog universe. He takes us to United Record Pressing, a vinyl plant in Nashville that\u2019s churning out 40, 000 records a day, with a staff that\u2019s tripled since 2010. He takes us to Book Culture, on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, one of the many indie bookstores to open in New York and around the country in recent years. And he takes us to Snakes  Lattes, a   cafe in Toronto, where customers can play not only familiar childhood games but also more obscure selections from a   collection. There are even \u201cgame gurus\u201d to dispense advice  \u2014   a decidedly more social experience than the solitary world of many video gamers. This desire for human interaction  \u2014   and a sense of community and place  \u2014   is one of the magnets that draw people to neighborhood bookstores, where readers can get expert recommendations (from a person, not an algorithm) and attend readings and discussion groups. The more time we spend in the digital world of clicks and taps and swipes, Mr. Sax writes, the more people have begun to recognize the value of    interactions. So much so that work spaces (most notably, at tech companies) are being configured to promote productive meetings and serendipitous exchanges. \u201cThe whole point of all these spaces,\u201d says Primo Orpilla, a   of a firm that designs offices for digital technology companies, \u201cis to get you to put down your device and read inflections, read body language, and have meaningful conversations. \u201d In an increasingly digital world where physical objects and experiences are being replaced by virtual ones, Mr. Sax concludes, \u201canalog gives us the joy of creating and possessing real, tangible things\u201d: the hectic scratch of a fountain pen on the smooth, lined pages of a notebook the slow magic of a Polaroid photo developing in front of our eyes the satisfying snap of a newspaper page being turned and folded back the moment of silence as the arm of an old turntable descends toward a shiny new vinyl disk and the music begins to play. In reporting this book, Mr. Sax says he found that it was less a case of older generations reaching back to familiar formats from their youth than teenagers and   discovering turntables and LPs, paperback novels and film cameras. \u201cThe younger someone was, the more digitally exposed their generation was,\u201d he writes near the end of this book, \u201cthe less I found them enamored by digital technology, and the more they were wary of its effects. \u201d These kids were falling in love with analog.'"}, "time": 1742562352.0175862}
