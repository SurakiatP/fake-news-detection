They often visited us on the holidays when I was a kid. Bill even knew the cows names by heart. That always surprised me\u201d recalls the 64-year-old, third-generation dairy farmer. \\n\u201c My father was a strong Democratic party supporter all his life and a big Bill Clinton fan, so I never found the strength to tell him the truth before he passed away \u201d \\nSex, drugs and cattle \\nDuring the 1992 Iowa caucus, the Clinton campaign stopped by for a night of festivities at the Brady\u2019s farm, a night Tom Brady says he will never forget. \\n\u201cThe Clinton team came by and we drank a lot and all was merry before they started indulging in hard drugs, that\u2019s when everything went wrong\u201d he recalls, visibly distraught by the whole affair. \\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about all those stories about him sexually assaulting women, but I sure as hell know he assaulted one of our cows because I was there and I saw him do it with my own eyes and believe me, it\u2019s not something I\u2019d wish my worst enemy to live to see\u201d he told local reporters. \\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for the Clinton family, but as a God-fearing Christian, I just had to let the truth be known\u201d he adds. \\nBill Clinton has been personally accused publicly by seventeen women of sexual misconduct between 1972 and 1997. The former US President also admitted to having had an \u201cinappropriate relationship\u201d with Monica Lewinsky while she worked at the White House in 1995 and 1996.'"}, "time": 1742563614.1949813}
