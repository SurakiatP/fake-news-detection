I. on Friday revealed new details about the Justice Department\u2019s yearlong investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server and whether she and her aides mishandled classified information. Among the documents was an   summary of an interview F. B. I. agents conducted with Mrs. Clinton on July 2. Two days later, the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, said the bureau had recommended to the Justice Department that neither Mrs. Clinton nor her aides should be charged with a crime. Here are six highlights from those documents: According to the F. B. I. in December 2014 a top aide to Mrs. Clinton told the company that housed her server to delete an archive of emails from her account. The company, Platte River Networks, apparently never followed those instructions. On March 2, 2015, The New York Times reported that Mrs. Clinton had exclusively used a personal email account when she was secretary of state. Two days later, the congressional committee investigating the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s response to them, told the technology firms associated with the email account that they had to retain \u201call relevant documents\u201d related to its inquiry. Three weeks later, a Platte River employee realized he had not deleted the emails as instructed. The employee said he then used a special program called BleachBit to delete the files. The F. B. I. said Mrs. Clinton was unaware of the deletions. The F. B. I. said it was later able to find some of the emails, but did not say how many emails were deleted, or whether they were included in the 60, 000 emails that Mrs. Clinton said she sent and received while secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. But Mrs. Clinton\u2019s lawyer, David Kendall, said in a letter to Congress on March 27, 2015, that after Mrs. Clinton gave roughly 30, 000   emails to the State Department, Mrs. Clinton \u201cchose not to keep\u201d her personal emails while she was secretary of state, which she has said numbered roughly 30, 000. Mr. Kendall said he confirmed with Mrs. Clinton\u2019s support staff that no emails from the time she was in office \u201creside on the server or on any backup systems associated with the server. \u201d In Mrs. Clinton\u2019s interview with the F. B. I. she said she did not recall receiving any emails \u201cshe thought should not be on an unclassified system. \u201d She said she had relied on State Department officials to use their judgment when emailing her sensitive information, adding that she \u201ccould not recall anyone raising concerns with her regarding the sensitivity of the information she received at her email address. \u201d In a summary of the investigation, the F. B. I. said Mrs. Clinton had emailed Colin L. Powell, a former secretary of state, a day after she was sworn into office about Mr. Powell\u2019s use of a personal email account when he was the country\u2019s top diplomat. Mr. Powell warned Mrs. Clinton that if she used her BlackBerry for official business, those emails could become \u201cofficial record[s] and subject to the law. \u201d Mr. Powell, apparently implying that he was cautious in his use of his personal email account, added: \u201cBe very careful. I got around it all by not saying much and not using systems that captured the data. \u201d According to a summary of her interview, Mrs. Clinton said she did not know exactly what Mr. Powell meant and that his message \u201cdid not factor into her decision to use a personal email account. \u201d Mrs. Clinton said in her interview it was \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d that she had a private email address because it was \u201cdisplayed to anyone with whom she exchanged emails. \u201d But the F. B. I. said in a summary of its findings that \u201csome State Department employees interviewed by the F. B. I. explained that emails by Clinton only contained the letter \u2018H\u2019 in the sender field and did not display her email address. \u201d The F. B. I. said that some of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s closest aides were aware she used a private email address but did not know she had set up a private server. The aides said they were \u201cunaware of the existence of the private server until after Clinton\u2019s tenure at State or when it became public knowledge. \u201d According to the summary of the investigation, Mrs. Clinton brought her BlackBerry into a secure area on the seventh floor of the State Department, where such electronics are prohibited. The F. B. I. interviewed three former State Department diplomatic security agents who said that Mrs. Clinton kept her BlackBerry in her desk drawer in the secure area, a   Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF. But Huma Abedin, a top aide to Mrs. Clinton, told the F. B. I. that Mrs. Clinton left the secure area to check her BlackBerry, often going to the State Department\u2019s   balcony to do so. The F. B. I. said that it had identified 13 mobile devices that Mrs. Clinton potentially used to send emails. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s aides were in charge of buying replacement BlackBerry devices when she was in office. Ms. Abedin told the F. B. I. that \u201cit was not uncommon for Clinton to use a new BlackBerry for a few days and then immediately switch it out for an older version with which she was more familiar. \u201d Ms. Abedin and another aide told the F. B. I. that \u201cthe whereabouts of Clinton\u2019s devices would frequently become unknown once she transitioned to a new device. \u201d An aide to Bill Clinton, Justin Cooper, who helped set up the server, told the F. B. I. that he recalled \u201ctwo instances where he destroyed Clinton\u2019s old mobile devices by breaking them in half or hitting them with a hammer. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561932.3431692}
