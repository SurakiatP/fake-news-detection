[\u201cThere\u2019s distrust right now that exists between the states and Washington, D. C. as it relates to the environment,\u201d Pruitt told the crowd at CPAC on Saturday.  \u201cWe need to do what we can to restore trust. I\u2019m going to be spending time   \u2026     with the state governors and the executive branches of [state] government   \u2026     I\u2019m going to send a message. Let\u2019s join    to do what\u2019s important for the environment,\u201d Pruitt said. Less than   hours later, Pruitt held the meeting with Western Governors, who appeared to welcome the dialogue. The governors of nineteen western states are members of the Western Governors Association. \u201cThe Western Governors Association wants a better state and federal partnership,\u201d Governor Steve Bullock of Montana, current chairman of the group, said in a statement released by the EPA. \u201cI look forward to working together with the Western Governors on issues unique to the Western States and with each of these Governors on issues important to their individual states,\u201d EPA Administrator Pruitt said. \u201cThese Governors and their states are great stewards of their natural resources. They want to protect their water and air and grow their economies. The Environmental Protection Agency is going to help them do that,\u201d he added. \u201cIn his first week on the job as EPA Administrator, Scott Pruitt has now met with 18 Governors and Lieutenant Governors, putting into action his promise of an open door policy and a new beginning of partnership with the states,\u201d the EPA said in its statement. Last week, the Western Governors Association sent a letter to the EPA\u2019s Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery, \u201creiterat[ing] concerns\u201d over a propsed rule, Financial Responsbility Requirements under CERCLA for Classes of Facilities in the Hardrock Mining Industry. \u201cMany western states rely on the hardrock mining industry for economic development and employment,\u201d the governors wrote: These states have staff dedicated to mine permitting and compliance. Such staff are committed to ensuring hardrock mining facilities are designed, constructed and operated in a manner that minimizes risks to the environment and ensures proper site reclamation. \u201cThe EPA\u2019s proposed rule   \u2026     will negatively affect state economies,\u201d they continued. \u201cIt may also hamper existing, effective state financial assurance programs,\u201d they added. Pruitt\u2019s meeting with the governors on Sunday is the kind of reaching out he intends to conduct with state governments across the country to address and respond to their concerns. Twelve members of the group met with Pruitt on Sunday. Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper did not participate in the breakfast, but was in attendance in other meetings. Of the twelve members of the Western Governors Association who met with EPA Administrator Pruitt, seven are Republicans ( Governor Doug Burgum (N. D.) Governor Butch Otter (Idaho)  Governor Mary Fallin (Okla.)  Governor Brian Sandoval (Nev.) Governor Gary Herbert (Utah) Governor Dennis Daugaard (S. D.)  Governor Matt Mead (Wyo.) ). Four are Democrats ( Governor John Hickenlooper (Colo.) Governor Kate Brown (Ore.) Governor Steve Bullock (Mont.) and Governor David Ige (Hawaii) ) and one member, Governor Bill Walker (Alaska) is an independent. The seven members of the Western Governors Association who missed the meeting with Pruitt included five Republicans (Governor Doug Ducey (Arizona) Governor Sam Brownback (Kansas) Governor Pete Ricketts (Nebraska) Governor Susanna Martinez (New Mexico) and Governor Greg Abbot (Texas) ) and two Democrats (Governor Jerry Brown (California) and Governor Jay Inslee (Washington).'"}, "time": 1742628419.9746282}
