C.  \u2014     DNC Chair Tom Perez called President Donald Trump\u2019s first joint address to Congress \u201cSteve Bannon on steroids with a smile\u201d during an interview with Rachel Maddow on MSNBC, where he appeared with his appointed deputy chair, Keith Ellison. [Ellison laughed, raised his eyebrows, and looked at Perez after he made that statement.  According to one MSNBC reporter, when asked about Trump\u2019s speech, Perez sarcastically clapped: \u201cOh, he read a TelePrompTer!! It\u2019s like my kid ate and didn\u2019t spill!\u201d When asked about the speech DNC Chair Perez sarcastically clapped:  \u201doh, he read a TelePrompTer!! It\u2019s like my kid ate and didn\u2019t spill!\u201d  \u2014   Michael LaRosa (@MichaelLaRosaDC) March 1, 2017,  Perez said Trump started out his speech with \u201calternative facts. \u201d He charged that Trump \u201ctook credit for things [he] had nothing to do with  \u2026     . All these new companies are adding jobs. \u201d He added, sarcastically, that \u201csince January 20, the Washington Wizards have one of the best records in the NBA, including they beat the Golden State Warriors tonight. Must have been Trump. \u201d Trump started his speech on Tuesday night reminding the nation of Black History Month and condemning the recent spate of   attacks: Tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our Nation\u2019s path toward civil rights and the work that still remains. Recent threats targeting Jewish Community Centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week\u2019s shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a Nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms. Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice  \u2014   in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present. That torch is now in our hands. And we will use it to light up the world.  I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart. In his interview with MSNBC, Perez continued, \u201cThen you move on to immigrant baiting. You know, that immigrant baiting is like the salt and pepper on the table of that Trump administration. \u201d He said, \u201cAnd then you close it up with a bunch of promises that you\u2019ll never keep. And frankly, some of the promises, I\u2019m glad they can\u2019t keep, because the Affordable Care Act is a lifesaver. It\u2019s not a job killer. \u201d Ellison took the opportunity to recruit for the Democratic Party. \u201cThis is a good time to get   with the Democratic Party,\u201d \u201cWe have a level of organization, unity, commitment and passion that, I think, is going to serve the American people very well. \u201d Perez added: \u201cOur most important area of agreement, and we have many, is that we need to redefine the mission of the Democratic Party. \u201d Follow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter and Periscope @AdelleNaz'"}, "time": 1742564058.5592906}
