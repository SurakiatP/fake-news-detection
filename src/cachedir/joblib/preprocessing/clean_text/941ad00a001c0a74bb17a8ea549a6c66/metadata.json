Election Special,\u201d which will compile recent \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d political sketches, promises to \u201cretrace the highlights of the current presidential campaign. \u201d That\u2019s the first joke right there: that any part of this exhausting, acrimonious,   campaign can be considered a highlight. As Alec Baldwin put it, breaking character as Donald J. Trump on the last Saturday before the election: \u201cDon\u2019t you guys feel gross all the time about this?\u201d But it\u2019s undeniable that the race has blessed \u201cS. N. L. \u201d with material. And cursed it. \u201cS. N. L. \u201d faced   expectations: first, to wring laughs out of a national nervous breakdown, and second, to improve on a political reality so   that it writes its own penis jokes. \u201cS. N. L. \u201d couldn\u2019t manage that, at least when it\u2019s taken the candidates head on. But it\u2019s done some fine work around the election\u2019s edges. \u201cS. N. L. \u201d is a mainstream media institution, no less than \u201cMeet the Press\u201d or the presidential debates. (We\u2019ve had televised   debates on a regular basis only since 1976, a year after \u201cS. N. L. \u201d started.) So there\u2019s a kind of dutifulness to its election satire, which unfolds with all the ritual merriment of a candidates\u2019 pancake toss at a state fair. The big change the show made this fall was to bring in Mr. Baldwin to  . His boorish Trump felt like penance for \u201cS. N. L. \u201d having let the candidate   the show last November during the Republican primary campaign, and maybe for NBCUniversal\u2019s larger entanglements with him  \u2014   the former \u201cApprentice\u201d host, sucked up to by Billy Bush, coddled by Matt Lauer, patted like an apricot sheepdog by Jimmy Fallon. Was Mr. Baldwin\u2019s Trump good? Mimetically, it was worthy of a biopic. If I try to visualize Mr. Trump from the debates now, I see Mr. Baldwin instead, hulking,   his lips pursed open like the suckers of some   creature. But there wasn\u2019t a distinctive spin on Mr. Trump as a character, the way Kate McKinnon developed her Hillary Clinton long ago into a savage yet sympathetic portrait of political thirst. The scripts mainly highlighted moments, like Mr. Trump\u2019s lurking in the second debate, that the writers\u2019 room of Twitter had already hashed out in real time. Like any establishment institution, the show is prey to conventional wisdom. After the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d Trump tape, \u201cS. N. L. \u201d followed mainstream pundits\u2019 conclusion that the election was over. The   sketch introduced the Democratic candidate as \u201cPresident Hillary Clinton,\u201d and Mr. Baldwin\u2019s Trump declared, \u201cI\u2019m going to huff, I\u2019m going to puff, and I\u2019m going to blow this whole thing. \u201d (This, by the way, was the episode that enraged the real Mr. Trump on Twitter  \u2014   \u201cAlec Baldwin portrayal stinks. Media rigging election!\u201d  \u2014   and if the past year and a half taught us anything, it was being treated as a loser, not Mr. Baldwin\u2019s huffing and puffing, that set him off.) The show hasn\u2019t been able to   Mr. Trump\u2019s   caricature, but then, neither has the rest of   comedy. He\u2019s been a pulsating orange sun that blinds any comedian who stares at it directly. Which may be why \u201cS. N. L. \u201d has been most effective when it\u2019s looked past the candidates. \u201cCelebrity Family Feud: Political Edition\u201d sketched the motley circus of surrogates and campaign allies, including Ivanka Trump (Margot Robbie, her hair apparently blown by an offscreen fan) a vampiric Vladimir Putin (Beck Bennett) and Bill Clinton (Darrell Hammond, slipping on the role like an old sweatshirt). The taped short \u201cA Day Off\u201d imagined Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway (Ms. McKinnon) having a free day interrupted by repeated calls to defend the indefensible on CNN. (\u201cOf course Mr. Trump thinks that Mexicans can read, and actually what he wants them to read the most is Hillary Clinton\u2019s 33, 000\u2019s missing emails\u201d  \u2014   an only slightly exaggerated version of a familiar    ballet.) By far the season\u2019s peak was an installment of the returning   sketch, \u201cBlack Jeopardy! ,\u201d with Tom Hanks as Doug, a Trump supporter, answering    questions against two black contestants (Sasheer Zamata and Leslie Jones). Doug, to everyone\u2019s shock, got one response after another right. Prompted with the answer, \u201cThey out here saying, the new iPhone wants your thumbprint \u2018for your protection,\u2019\u201d he answered, \u201cWhat is: \u2018I don\u2019t think so. That\u2019s how they get you. \u2019\u201d The host (Kenan Thompson) was surprised  \u2014   \u201cYes!\u201d  \u2014   even relieved. This   white guy was on the same wavelength as his black guests, suspicious of authority, anxious to make ends meet, unimpressed with skinny women. It was cathartic, almost moving. Despite all the vitriol out there, maybe they weren\u2019t all that different? Then came the final category: \u201cLives That Matter. \u201d Said the host, \u201cWell, it was good while it lasted, Doug. \u201d This wasn\u2019t just the best sketch of the \u201cS. N. L. \u201d election season. It was some of the best political analysis of the campaign, making a nuanced point about white Trump supporters and minorities, race and economic anxiety. Doug and his black counterparts, it said, have real issues in common  \u2014   and a real, ultimate difference they may not be able to get past. The final cold open with Mr. Baldwin and Ms. McKinnon likewise turned its focus from the candidates to us. It started in straight campaign mode, portraying Mr. Trump being supported by the F. B. I. Mr. Putin and the Ku Klux Klan while CNN obsessed over Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email. Then the two actors broke off, declared that they were tired of hurling insults, and ran into the streets of Manhattan to hug   before returning to urge the audience, in Ms. McKinnon\u2019s words, to \u201cchoose what kind of country we want to live in. \u201d This too was a staged bit. But it also felt like a concession. The election, it said, has taxed the limits of typical election comedy, of     poking at foibles. It\u2019s become an emotionally draining, terrifying,   culture war into which we\u2019ve been drafted. It was hardly the most hilarious election sketch \u201cS. N. L. \u201d has ever done. But it may have been the right place, this year, to stop: peering beyond the vanishing edge of satire to the point at which all this stuff is no longer funny.'"}, "time": 1742562956.9325962}
