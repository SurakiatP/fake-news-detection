N. envoy Vladimir Safronkov said President Donald Trump missile strike on Syria in response to that country\u2019s alleged use of chemical weapons was an \u201cact of aggression,\u201d which will \u201conly facilitated the strengthening of terrorism. \u201d  Safronkov said via a translator, \u201cOn the night of the 7th of April, the United States attacked the territory of sovereign Syria. We describe that attack as a flagrant violation of international law and an act of aggression. We strongly condemn the illegitimate actions by the U. S. The consequences of this for regional and international stability could be extremely serious. This attack was a flagrant violation of the 2015 memorandum on preventing incidents and ensuring security during our operations in Syrian airspace and the ministry of defense of Russia has stopped its cooperation with Pentagon under that memorandum. \u201d He continued, \u201cOf recent times the United States administration has often talked about combat international terrorism and this was just  \u2014   this justified American troops and their allies being present on Syrian territory. Although they were there without the invitation of the legitimate government of Syria and without the approval of the security council of the United Nations. Manipulating articles of the United Nations charter beyond any criticism. The aggression by the U. S. has only facilitated the strengthening of terrorism. The attack came against Syrian armed forces structure and its air force. That is against those who over all these years have been combatting terrorism. It\u2019s not difficult to imagine how much the spirits of these terrorists have been raised after the support from Washington. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742628531.9566638}
