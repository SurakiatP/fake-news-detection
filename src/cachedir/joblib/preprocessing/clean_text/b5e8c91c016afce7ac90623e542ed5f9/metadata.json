FBI Emails Are Not \\'Trending\\' On Twitter, Facebook, Buzzfeed, Or Snapchat   \\nThey are not known as \\'weapons of mass distraction\\' for nothing... \\n\\nIn the 24 hours since FBI Director Comey dropped perhaps the biggest bombshell of the entire Presidential campaign, sending Democrats (and media) scrambling headless-chicken-like for answers (and blame-scaping), does anyone else find it odd that \\'FBI Emails\\' does not appear to be a hot topic, trending, big deal on any social media? Snapchat...\"Hot\" Buzzfeed... \"Trending Now\" \\n* * * \\nAs Liberty Blitzkrieg\\'s Mike Krieger recently asked (and answered) , why are these things happening in the first place? \\nApple claims not to endorse candidates, but their actions suggest otherwise, and some of their executives - including CEO Tim Cook - actively support Clinton\u2019s campaign. Buzzfeed recently obtained an invitation to a private $50,000-per-plate fundraiser Cook is hosting for Clinton with his Apple colleague, Lisa Jackson, at the end of this month. \\n\\nApple isn\u2019t the only corporation doing Clinton\u2019s bidding. Wikileaks founder Julian Assange said Clinton made a deal with Google and that the tech giant is \u201cdirectly engaged\u201d in her campaign. It\u2019s been widely reported Clinton hired Eric Schmidt \u2014chairman of Alphabet, the parent company of Google\u2014to set up a tech company called The Groundwork. Assange claims this was to ensure Clinton had the \u201cengineering talent to win the election.\u201d He also pointed out that many members of Clinton\u2019s staff have worked for Google, and some of her former employees now work at Google. \\nTwitter is another culprit. The company has gotten a lot of slack for banning conservatives and Trump supporters such as Breitbart\u2019s Milo Yiannopoulos and, most recently, rapper Azealia Banks after she came out in support of Trump. Twitter has provided vague answers as to why conservative voices have been banned while they\u2019ve allowed other users to call for the killing of cops. \\n\\nJust yesterday, Buzzfeed revealed that the social media giant\u2019s top executive personally protected the President from seeing critical messages last year. \u201cIn 2015, then-Twitter CEO Dick Costolo secretly ordered employees to filter out abusive and hateful replies to President Barack Obama.\u201d \\n\\nThe founders of some of the most popular pro-Trump Twitter handles - including @USAforTrump2016 and @WeNeedTrump\u2014insist Twitter is censoring their content. They\u2019ve pointed out that Twitter changes trending hashtags associated with negative tweets about Clinton (which has been reported before ). On August 4, shortly after the hashtag \u201cHillaryAccomplishment\u201d began trending, it was taken over by anti-Clinton users, who used it to mention Benghazi or Emailgate. Eric Spracklen, @USAforTrump2016 founder, noticed the hashtag was quickly changed\u2014pluralized to #HillarysAccomplishments. \\nMany people have pointed out the exact shenanigans described above for other Clinton-related hashtags. In fact, it\u2019s been my self-described progressive friends who have been most up in arms about it. \\n\u201cThey take away the hashtag that has negative tweets for Clinton and replace it with something that doesn\u2019t so the average person doesn\u2019t see what was really trending,\u201d Spracklen said. \u201cThis happens every day.\u201d \\n\\nThis new strand, where one cannot even search for alternative viewpoints amid technology companies who stand to benefit from the free-trade policies and eased immigration regulations of a Clinton presidence, represents a dangerous sea change. There\u2019s absolutely no question the digital forums we use every day are censoring conservatives and favoring Clinton. You can\u2019t simply scroll through photos on Instagram, look for a video game in the App Store or do a quick Google search without being fed anti-Trump and pro-Clinton propaganda. \\nPersonally, I\u2019ve definitely noticed a big-time pro-Clinton bias in my Twitter stream on a daily basis, and I don\u2019t follow people/organizations that would define themselves as overtly pro-Clinton. That\u2019s my honest perception, and I don\u2019t have a dog in this fight. \\n* * *'"}, "time": 1742563664.441851}
