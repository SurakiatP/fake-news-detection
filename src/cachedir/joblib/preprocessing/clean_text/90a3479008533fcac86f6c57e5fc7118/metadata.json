Science proves that nature can help your brain! \\n\\nA 2010 study from the University of Rochester found that spending time outdoors not only make you happier, it also can lead to an increased sense of vitality. This might explain why hikes and camps can make us feel so much more energized, both mentally and physically. According to research, nature can lead to a surge of energy. \\n\\nIn an analysis of research on how nature can keep us calm, Adam Atler has found that being outside is similar to hitting the reset button on our brains. The key is through a process known as attention restoration theory. \\n\\nWhile man-made landscapes can sometimes over-stimulate our brains, natural landscapes give us the chance to think as much or as little as we\u2019d like, there lies the opportunity to replenish our exhausted mental resources. \\n\\nRelieves Depression \\n\\nA quick walk in nature can really help your mind. A 2014 study found that participants who took group nature walks saw a host of mental-health benefits, including decreased depression and better moods. Taking a walk in nature also gives you exercise which is always great for your body and mental health. \\n\\nCreativity \\n\\nA 2012 study found that looking at the color green can spark inventiveness in your mind. Being outside can also distract your mind from a problem, and some of the best ideas come when we are not thinking about anything in the first place. \\n\\nFocus \\n\\nCities can have negative influences on the brain, according to a 2012 study. There are so many distractions and things stimulating your brain, and these distractions impact the area of the brain that controls your directed attention and your self control . Nature can help subside and cure this. \\n\\nStress \\n\\nEveryone wants to be less stressed. One small study published in the journal Landscape and Urban Planning found that adults who live in areas with the most amount of green space experience lower levels of cortisol, the hormone that causes stress. \\n\\nResearch proves that being in nature can have a healing effect. It can also help reduce feelings of fear, and anger, lower blood pressure and contribute to the overall psychological well-being of all people. \\n\\nAriana Marisol is a contributing staff writer for REALfarmacy.com.
