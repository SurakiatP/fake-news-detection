American Herald Tribune Trump\u2019s grandfather was a pimp and tax evader; his father a member of the KKK \\nMost families of enormous wealth have a dark and sometimes scandalous, even monstrous past. Donald Trump\u2019s clan is no exception to that rule. His grandfather was a pimp and a tax evader, his father a racist who would in the course of his life, clash with New York City Police as a member of the Ku Klux Klan and then as a wealthy real estate magnate, refuse to rent to people of color. \\nDonald Trump\u2019s legacy is anything but a rags to riches story. His dad kicked the bucket with $250-$300 million in the bank. The man who wants to ban all people of a particular religion from travel, wasn\u2019t born with a silver spoon in his mouth, his was white gold. The only thing more obnoxious than Donald Trump himself, is his family\u2019s money grubbing, bigoted history. The Trumps: Three generations of criminals \\nTrump\u2019s Grandfather: Pimp and Tax Evader \\nDonald Trump\u2019s grandfather, Frederick or Frederich Trump, made his money from operating a decadent restaurant and hotel during the Gold Rush at Klondike in the Yukon. \\nThat\u2019s a nice way of saying it. \\n\u201cTrump made his first fortune operating boom-town hotels, restaurants and brothels\u201d, is more accurate, according to the CBC news report, \u201cDonald   says\u201d. Author Gwenda Blair simply wrote, \u201c\u201dThe   sex.\u201d \\nTrump\u2019s grandfather was born in Germany, to parents who were employed by a vineyard. He moved to New York City in 1885 where he became a barber. After six years of this, Frederick Trump moved across the United States to Seattle, Washington, where he owned and operated what he referred to as a \u201cdecadent restaurant\u201d that was actually called \u201cPoodle Dog\u201d in Seattle\u2019s red light district. Interestingly, the name and concept that had already been established in San Francisco. (He named his restaurant after a dog but would later make money selling horse meat) Around this time Frederick Trump became a US citizen. \\nA Yukon Sun Newspaper writer described his business: \u201cFor single men the Arctic has excellent accommodations as well as the best restaurant in Bennett, but I   \u2013   sex\u201d. \\nTrump moved to Monte Cristo, Wash. in 1894, and then four years later, shortly after the Klondike gold rush began, he relocated again to Bennett, British Columbia. Here he ran the \u201cActic Restaurant and Hotel\u201d. He would next build the \u201cWhite Horse restaurant and Inn\u201d in Whitehorse, Yukon. \\nAn article published this year by Politico, explains that Frederick Trump sold off his investments and returned to Germany in 1901, as he sensed the end of the gold rush and a subsequent end to prostitution. The following year, he married his former neighbor, Elizabeth Christ in his native German town of Kallstadt. Then he came under heavy scrutiny by the German government, \\nThe country had compulsory military service for men which had to be fulfilled by the age of 35. Donald Trump\u2019s grandfather waited until he was 35 to go back to Germany. He had already amassed great wealth worth well more than half a million US dollars, or 80,000 marks. While his town council was eager to keep Trump and his money, who billed himself as a man who \u201cavoided bars\u201d and led \u201ca quiet life\u201d, other German authorities had a different plan, the Politico article explains. In their view, Trump had relocated to Germany in order to avoid both tax and military-service obligations. \\n\u201c\u2026the regional authorities refused to let Trump off the hook. Unlike his grandson, who would become too big to fail in business and, more recently, to ignore in politics, Friedrich Trump was not big enough to get away with being a draft-dodger. He and his wife, then pregnant with Fred, Donald\u2019s father, would not be allowed to resume their German citizenship and it would not be extended to their daughter; instead, they were deported\u2014the same fate that Donald would like to impose on undocumented immigrants in the U.S. today.\u201d \\nThe fact that Donald Trump has done so well in the Republican polls is quite amazing, as the party that we think of as conservative, would be expected to shun a man who created exploitative beauty pageants and was born rich strictly because of the nefarious activities of his ancestors. \\nTrump\u2019s Father: a Lifetime of Racist Practices \\nDonald Trump has often said he made his money \u201cthe old-fashioned way,\u201d and this is true, in that he prospered from racism. \\nA New York Times article published 01 June 1927, related Donald Trump\u2019s father Fred Trump\u2019s role in a Ku Klux Klan brawl that pitted 1,000 klansmen against 100 New York City Police in Queens. Though he wasn\u2019t officially charged, Fred Trump was one of seven klansmen arrested during the incident. It probably wasn\u2019t very shocking at the time as America\u2019s racist practices were in full swing generations after Abe Lincoln freed the country\u2019s African-American slaves. In fact the mid-20\u2019s saw a peak in KKK activity. Donald Trump would later deny his father\u2019s involvement in the KKK brawl in spite of the fact that it happened two decades before he was born. Fred Trump\u2019s enthusiasm for racist practices never changed until he was forced to do so by the law. \\nPresidential Candidate Donald Trump joined his father\u2019s real estate company in New York in 1971, and only two years later, the company was served with a civil rights lawsuit that was filed against the Trump organization because it refused to rent to Black people. The Urban League got wind of the racist rental policy and actually sent both Black and White people in to apply for apartments that belonged to complexes owned by the Trumps. What they proved, was that Black people were denied rentals across the board, and only Whites were approved. A Village Voice article by Wayne Barrett, published in 1979, blew the lid off the Trump organization\u2019s brewing pot of racist practices. \\n\u201cThree doormen were told to discourage blacks who came seeking apartments when the manager was out, either by claiming no vacancies or hiking up the rents. A super said he was instructed to send black applicants to the central office but to accept white applications on site. Another rental agent said that Fred Trump had instructed him not to rent to blacks. Further, the agent said Trump wanted \u2018to decrease the number of black tenants\u2019 already in the development \u2018by encouraging them to locate housing elsewhere.'\u201d \\nThe article explains that Trump\u2019s reaction was to claim that the suit was a, \u201cnationwide drive to force owners of moderate and luxury apartments to rent to welfare recipients.\u201d \\n\u201c\u2018We are not going to be forced by anyone to put people\u2026in our buildings to the detriment of tenants who have, for many years, lived in these buildings, raised families in them, and who plan to continue to live there. That would be reverse discrimination,\u2019 he said. \u2018The government is not going to experiment with our buildings to the detriment of ourselves and the thousands who live in them now.'\u201d \\nIndeed, Trump\u2019s wild, largely uninformed and unintelligent rants are the legacy of men who walked over the backs of other Americans to gain and secure their wealth. This may be symbolic to the American capitalist way, but it falls short of any form of greatness or real human success. As they say, the apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree.
