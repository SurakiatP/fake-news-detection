But the truth is much more complicated.\\nWhile she underperformed relative to Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2012 totals in several Midwestern states \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Ohio, Michigan, Iowa, and Wisconsin \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Clinton ran virtually even with Obama in the battlegrounds of Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Virginia, Nevada, and New Hampshire. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, she far surpassed Obama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2012 vote total in Florida, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest swing state. Yet somehow, while Obama carried Florida, Clinton lost it.\\nWhich brings us to an important question: Was Donald Trump just good enough to beat a bad Democratic opponent on Tuesday, or does he deserve far more credit? Could he, for instance, have competed with the vaunted Obama machine? The answer, somewhat shockingly, is yes. A review of vote totals in the past two elections reveals that Trump 2016 would have defeated Obama 2012 in the electoral college.\\nThe math might seem impossible. After all, Obama won nearly 66 million votes in 2012; Trump is currently at 59.5 million and should finish around 60 million, which will actually be one million fewer votes than Mitt Romney won. How, then, could Trump have topped Obama in the electoral college? The answer: Republican turnout lagged in certain parts of the country but shot through the roof in the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most critical battleground states.\\nLet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s look at them individually, in descending order by population, and do the electoral-vote math. The 2016 totals aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet final because not all precincts have reported.\\nFLORIDA \u00e2\u20ac\u201d 29 EVs \u00e2\u20ac\u201d 98 percent reporting \\nObama 2012: 4,235,270\\nClinton 2016: 4,485,745\\nRomney 2012: 4,162,081\\nTrump 2016: 4,605,515\\nConclusion: Trump beats Obama by some 370,000 votes and wins Florida. (Note: Clinton herself won 250,000 more votes in Florida than Obama did in 2012.)\\nPENNSYLVANIA \u00e2\u20ac\u201d 20 EVs \u00e2\u20ac\u201d 97 percent reporting \\nObama 2012: 2,907,448\\nClinton 2016: 2,844,705\\nRomney 2012: 2,619,583\\nTrump 2016: 2,912,941\\nConclusion: Trump squeezes past Obama by a margin of some 5,000 votes and wins Pennsylvania. (Note: Clinton runs about 60,000 votes behind Obama, but would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had more than enough to defeat Romney in 2012.)\\nOHIO \u00e2\u20ac\u201d 18 EVs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 94 percent reporting \\nObama 2012: 2,697,260\\nClinton 2016: 2,317,001\\nRomney 2012: 2,593,779\\nTrump 2016: 2,771,984\\nConclusion: Trump edges Obama by roughly 75,000 votes and wins Ohio. (Note: Clinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst battleground state showing was Ohio, winning 380,000 [!] fewer votes than Obama.)\\nStop right there and crunch the numbers: Florida (29) + Pennsylvania (20) + Ohio (18) = 67 EVs.\\nRomney finished with 206 EVs. By protecting all of those, and then taking 67 from Obama, Trump would hit 273 and win the presidency.\\nThe question: Did Trump 2016 defeat Obama 2012 in all of the states Romney won? Yes. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a look at the competitive ones:\\n\u00e2\u20ac\u201c NORTH CAROLINA (98 percent reporting): Trump 2,339,603 \u00e2\u20ac\u015a Obama 2,178,388\\n\u00e2\u20ac\u201c ARIZONA (73 percent reporting): Trump 947,284 \u00e2\u20ac\u015a Obama 930,669\\n\u00e2\u20ac\u201c GEORGIA (93 percent reporting): Trump 2,068,623 \u00e2\u20ac\u015a Obama 1,761,761\\n\u00e2\u20ac\u201c UTAH (78 percent reporting): Trump 360,634 \u00e2\u20ac\u015a Obama 229,463\\nA review of the Romney 2012 states confirms that Trump, in this hypothetical matchup, would have carried every single one against Obama.\\nIt doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter that Obama would have trounced Trump by nearly 300,000 votes in Michigan; by more than 200,000 in Wisconsin; by 175,000 in Virginia; and by 160,000 in Colorado. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s similarly meaningless that Obama would have narrowly defeated Trump in Iowa, Nevada, and New Hampshire. The 44th president carried all of those states in 2012, and in this hypothetical contest, he would successfully defend all of them. But it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be enough.\\nThe electoral college would produce a razor-thin margin: Trump 273, Obama 265.\\nAgain, this is an apples-to-oranges exercise. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impossible to know how the Obama campaign might have targeted certain voters in a contest against Trump, or whether Trump would have the same success in the three big battleground states against a more formidable opponent. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the point here; the point is that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not entirely fair to blame Clinton for depressing Democratic turnout when she ran even with him in five of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most competitive states and ahead of him in a sixth, Florida, the single biggest swing state \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and still lost the electoral college.\\nSource \\n'"}, "time": 1742628493.635124}
