And faced with the unsavory prospect of women receiving fair pay or having their sexual assault claims taken seriously, Americans went to the polls today and made their voices heard loud and clear. This is a bright new day for America.\u201d In a similar finding, political scientists asserted that Trump\u2019s election also represented a decisive move by the people of this country to shake off the brutal fetters of half-hearted attempts at racial tolerance.
