Gorsuch: \u25a0 Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, pressed Judge Gorsuch on a central question: Can he hold President Trump accountable? \u201cNo man is above the law,\u201d he said. \u25a0 Judge Gorsuch said no one from the White House had asked him to make any commitments on legal issues. \u201cI have offered no promises on how I\u2019d rule to anyone on any case,\u201d he said. \u25a0 The nominee refused to say how he would rule on many issues, including abortion, gun rights and Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban. \u25a0 Judge Gorsuch praised Judge Merrick B. Garland, but declined to wade into the partisan fight. \u201cI can\u2019t get involved in politics,\u201d he said. \u25a0 He sidestepped many efforts by Democrats to offer his views on previous Supreme Court rulings. Democrats could cite his answers later as evasive responses that persuaded them to vote against him. \u25a0 Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, asked Judge Gorsuch about his participation in defending the George W. Bush administration\u2019s policies in the war on terror, like torture, when the judge was a Justice Department official in  . Judge Gorsuch said he was a lawyer and not a policy maker then. \u25a0 Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said he was comforted that President Trump had chosen Judge Gorsuch. \u201cQuite frankly, I was quite worried about who he\u2019d pick. Maybe somebody on TV. \u201d Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, was perhaps the most aggressive questioner so far. He turned first to the case of a truck driver who abandoned his broken rig in frigid conditions and was fired. He asked Judge Gorsuch, who in a dissent said the dismissal should be upheld, what he would have done if he were faced with the same situation as the driver. \u201cI\u2019m asking you a question, please answer the question,\u201d Mr. Franken said, as the nominee demurred. When Judge Gorsuch began to defend his vote again, the senator cut in. \u201cThat\u2019s absurd,\u201d said Mr. Franken, a veteran of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d in a previous life. \u201cNow, I had a career in identifying absurdity. And I know it when I see it. \u201d Judge Gorsuch said earlier that the case of the truck driver was \u201cone of those that you take home at night. \u201d But the law, he argued on Tuesday, was clear: \u201cThe law said the man is protected and can\u2019t be fired if he refuses to operate an unsafe vehicle. \u201d In fact, Judge Gorsuch said, the driver had unhitched his vehicle from the trailing cargo to get to safety in frigid weather. \u201cHe chose to operate,\u201d Judge Gorsuch said, adding, \u201cI think by any plain understanding, he operated the vehicle. \u201d The nominee expressed no fondness for this particular law  \u2014   \u201cI\u2019ve been stuck on a highway in Wyoming in a snowstorm,\u201d he noted  \u2014   but said it was his duty to observe it. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, said shadowy groups had spent millions of dollars in \u201cdark money\u201d to support Judge Gorsuch\u2019s nomination. The senator asked the judge to urge his supporters to disclose what they had spent. Judge Gorsuch declined, saying that would be a political move. He noted that the Supreme Court had allowed Congress to require disclosure of political spending. \u201cWith all respect, the ball\u2019s in your court,\u201d Judge Gorsuch said. Judge Gorsuch has called himself an originalist, meaning that he tries to interpret the Constitution as it was understood by the people who drafted and ratified it. On Tuesday, he said his approach could keep pace with contemporary realities. \u201cThe Constitution doesn\u2019t change,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world around us changes. \u201d Judge Gorsuch said that the principles in the Constitution can adapt to the modern world, citing a Supreme Court ruling on GPS tracking devices. \u201cI\u2019m not looking to take us back to quill pens and the horse and buggy,\u201d he said. Outside the hearing room, Democrats are trying to weigh down the Gorsuch nomination with the baggage of investigations into the president\u2019s orbit and Russia. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said it was \u201cthe height of irony\u201d for Republicans to press for Judge Gorsuch\u2019s elevation to the court after holding the seat open last year. \u201cRepublicans held this Supreme Court seat open for nearly a calendar year while President Obama was in office,\u201d he said from the Senate floor, \u201cbut are now rushing to fill the seat for a president whose campaign is under investigation by the F. B. I. \u201d Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, brought up letters submitted to the committee by two former students in a legal ethics class Judge Gorsuch taught in the spring of 2016 at the University of Colorado Law School. The two students  \u2014   one of whom signed her name  \u2014   complained about comments they recalled Judge Gorsuch made in a class session about ethical issues that arose in the practice of the law profession. In the comments, the students claimed that Judge Gorsuch told them that employers needed to ask female job applicants about their intentions regarding pregnancy to protect their firms from women who were simply seeking maternity benefits. Judge Gorsuch said that misrepresented the discussion, citing instructions in a teaching manual to explore the subject. Judge Gorsuch also said he believed that it would be \u201cinappropriate\u201d for a prospective employer to ask such a question, and that he was \u201cshocked\u201d that every year when he asked his students whether they had been asked such a thing, many female students raised their hands. Judge Gorsuch was asked to address the nominee who never had his hearing, Judge Garland. \u201cWhenever I see his name attached to an opinion, it\u2019s one I read with special care,\u201d Judge Gorsuch said, praising his peer as \u201can outstanding judge. \u201d But when Senator Leahy asked whether Judge Garland had been treated fairly, Judge Gorsuch demurred. \u201cI can\u2019t get involved in politics,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s judicial canons that prevent me from doing that. And I think it would be very imprudent of judges to start commenting on political disputes. \u201d Mr. Leahy had no such qualms. \u201cI can express an opinion,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it was shameful. \u201d During the campaign, Mr. Trump said he would seek to appoint justices ready to vote to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision establishing a constitutional right to abortion. But Judge Gorsuch said that no one from the White House asked him to make any commitments on legal issues that could come before him on the Supreme Court. \u201cI have offered no promises on how I\u2019d rule to anyone on any case,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in litmus tests for judges,\u201d he said. Asked about Roe v. Wade, Judge Gorsuch said, \u201cI would tell you that Roe vs. Wade, decided in 1973, is the precedent of the United States Supreme Court,\u201d saying that \u201call of the other factors that go into analyzing precedent have to be considered. \u201d Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who is chairman of the committee, also pressed Judge Gorsuch for his views on precedent generally, naming a few cases, including a Second Amendment case and the matter of Bush v. Gore. \u201cI know some people in this room have some opinions on that,\u201d Judge Gorsuch joked, declining to outline firm positions. The nominee likened precedents to \u201cour shared family history as judges. \u201d \u201cAs a good judge, you don\u2019t approach that question anew as if it has never been decided,\u201d he added. Mr. Leahy brought up Judge Gorsuch\u2019s connections with the Colorado billionaire Phil Anschutz, whom Judge Gorsuch formerly represented in private practice. The senator noted that on Jan. 10, 2006, The Denver Post reported that there were three finalists for an appeals court vacancy  \u2014   and none were Judge Gorsuch. Two days later, a lawyer for Mr. Anschutz wrote on the billionaire\u2019s behalf to the White House counsel at the time, Harriet Miers, to suggest that President George W. Bush consider nominating Judge Gorsuch. She gave him an interview in early February and he ended up getting the nomination. Mr. Leahy also noted that Mr. Anschutz finances conservative groups including the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation, which put Judge Gorsuch on the list of candidates President Trump promised to use in selecting a Supreme Court nominee. \u201cAre these areas of concern?\u201d Mr. Leahy asked. Judge Gorsuch replied that he thought his service at the Justice Department, where he had worked about seven months, was the most important issue, noting many of his former clients had said \u201cnice things\u201d about him when he was up for an appeals court judgeship, including the owner of a gravel pit. Mr. Leahy scoffed, \u201cWhich one do you think the White House listened to the most, Mr. Anschutz or a gravel pit owner? I mean, let\u2019s be realistic. \u201d Mr. Leahy did not ask whether Judge Gorsuch would recuse himself from cases involving Mr. Anschutz\u2019s interests. The judge did recuse himself from such cases on the appeals court, but so far has left the door open to participating in them on the Supreme Court. Judge Gorsuch, who had criticized liberals for preferring litigation to the political process in an article written before he became a judge, distanced himself from his earlier statements on Tuesday. \u201cAmerican liberals,\u201d he wrote in a 2005 essay in National Review, \u201chave become addicted to the courtroom, relying on judges and lawyers rather than elected leaders and the ballot box, as the primary means of effecting their social agenda on everything from gay marriage to assisted suicide to the use of vouchers for   education. This overweening addiction to the courtroom as the place to debate social policy is bad for the country and bad for the judiciary. \u201d On Tuesday, he said he had been wrong to single out liberals. \u201cThe problem lies on both sides of the aisle,\u201d he said. He added that \u201cthe courts are a very important place for the vindication of civil rights. \u201d The top Democrat on the committee, Senator Feinstein pressed Judge Gorsuch on his involvement in several      disputes in which he was involved as a Justice Department official: torture, the habeas corpus rights of Guant\u00e1namo detainees, warrantless surveillance, and the scope of the president\u2019s power as    to defy statutes. In December 2005, she noted, when Congress passed the Detainee Treatment Act, which barred cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment of detainees, Judge Gorsuch advocated a signing statement that would say the new statute only codified existing Bush administration interrogation practices. The context, she noted, was that the Justice Department had issued a secret memo earlier that year saying techniques like waterboarding and prolonged sleep deprivation were not cruel, inhuman or degrading. She asked whether Judge Gorsuch believed such torture techniques were lawful. Judge Gorsuch declined to answer that question. Ms. Feinstein indicated she would return to the torture issue in a second round of questioning. She also pointed out that after it emerged that Mr. Bush had authorized the National Security Agency to wiretap without warrants, despite a 1978 law requiring warrants, Judge Gorsuch had drafted a statement for Alberto Gonzales, the attorney general at the time, to deliver at a congressional hearing. His initial draft suggested that Congress lacked the authority to enact a law limiting a president\u2019s power to conduct surveillance without warrants for national security purposes. \u201cGoodness no, Senator, and I didn\u2019t believe it at the time,\u201d Judge Gorsuch replied. He said he had been only \u201cacting in the capacity as a speechwriter\u201d in bringing together materials submitted by colleagues in the administration. \u201cI was the scribe. \u201d Under questioning from Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, about how to apply new technologies to constitutional principles written two centuries ago, Judge Gorsuch brought up the issue of whether police officers needed a warrant to attach a GPS tracker to a suspect\u2019s car in order to monitor his movements. He spoke admiringly of a 2012 Supreme Court decision that applied the original Constitution in concluding that warrants were required. \u201cTechnology changes, but the principles don\u2019t,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cit can\u2019t be the case the U. S. Constitution is any less protective\u201d of people\u2019s privacy than it was at the time it was written. On the appeals court, Judge Gorsuch sometimes sided with plaintiffs in Fourth Amendment search issues even when colleagues voted for the police. Notably, though, after the Supreme Court issued its landmark GPS tracker ruling, Judge Gorsuch voted to let prosecutors in other cases use evidence that police had gathered with such a tracker in 2011, before the Supreme Court handed down that ruling, because the rule had not been clear at the time. Mr. Grassley opened his questioning by asking if Judge Gorsuch would have \u201cany trouble ruling against the president who appointed you. \u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a softball, Mr. Chairman,\u201d Judge Gorsuch replied, in what seemed to be a scripted response. He said he would have \u201cno difficulty\u201d ruling for or against any party. He spoke of his legal hero and former boss, Justice Byron R. White, saying he embraced his \u201cfierce, rugged independence. \u201d \u201cI have offered no promises on how I would rule on any case to anyone,\u201d Judge Gorsuch said. Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, likes doing bits. His presidential run last year was full of them  \u2014   from a recurring set of impressions from \u201cThe Princess Bride\u201d to an elaborate   of a scene from \u201cHoosiers\u201d before the Indiana primary. (His plans were felled by an   reference to a \u201cbasketball ring\u201d instead of a rim.) His questioning of Judge Gorsuch was no exception. Mr. Cruz began by asking the nominee, \u201cWhat is the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything?\u201d \u201c\u201d Judge Gorsuch replied instantly. (The two explained that that was a reference to \u201cThe Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy. \u201d) Mr. Cruz went on to ask Judge Gorsuch about the basketball skills of the nominee\u2019s former boss, Justice Byron R. White, and to defend the Federalist Society, the conservative group that pushed for Judge Gorsuch\u2019s nomination. Ms. Feinstein got to the heart of Democrats\u2019 early criticisms of Judge Gorsuch: his record on workers\u2019 rights. \u201cHow do we have confidence in you that you won\u2019t just be for the big corporations?\u201d she asked. \u201cThose of us, I think on both sides, care very much about workers\u2019 rights. But the record is such that one questions whether the court is capable in its current composition to give a worker a fair shot. \u201d She was, she added, \u201cjust looking for something\u201d in his record to give her confidence. Judge Gorsuch ticked off past cases in which he ruled for the little guy, calling himself \u201ca fair judge\u201d and noting that members of both parties have said as much.'"}, "time": 1742562093.22683}
