It is an unforgiving place, choked by swirling sandstorms and baked by summer temperatures that can reach 122 degrees Fahrenheit. Home to just 100 people, it has one primary school with six students, one tiny hospital and one police station, which are staffed by one nurse and one policeman. But every year, thousands of people descend on the town for the Big Red Bash, which its organizers claim is the remotest music festival on earth. \u201cThis is the ultimate Australian country gig,\u201d said Jimmy Barnes, one of Australia\u2019s   rock musicians, as he lounged backstage at the festival in July. The Big Red Bash, named for the towering    sand dune on which it is usually held, just outside Birdsville, is what Mr. Barnes called \u201ca celebration of the bush. \u201d The event was first held in 2013 with an audience of just 600 this year\u2019s   festival had 7, 000 attendees. The influx of visitors is critical for the survival of the community that has built its recent fortunes on tourism. The town also hosts the annual Birdsville Races, a renowned horse racing event that was first held in 1882 and now attracts thousands of people each year. \u201cOnce upon a time, Birdsville depended on local ringers, stockman, drovers,\u201d said Don Rowlands, an Aboriginal elder of the local Wangkangurru and Yarluyandi nations and a ranger of the nearby   National Park, referring to the workers on the cattle ranches that surround the town. Now, he said, \u201cit would not survive without tourism  \u2014   not a chance in hell. \u201d For many, the attraction of the Big Red Bash is its remoteness. Fresh vegetables are delivered twice a week by truck (\u201croad mail,\u201d as locals call it) some residents fly their own small planes (the airfield, conveniently, is a   walk from the pub) and if the lights go out, electricians must be booked from the closest city, Mount Isa, which is a   drive away. \u201cYou don\u2019t go through Birdsville, you come to Birdsville, and that makes the difference,\u201d Nell Brook said. She and her husband, David, whose family settled in Birdsville in 1885, farm on an enormous scale. They own 40, 000 cattle on five properties that span 32, 000 square kilometers. \u201cIt\u2019s an effort to get here,\u201d said Ross McGregor, 51, a laundry worker who drove for two days from his home in Townsville for the Big Red Bash. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge. \u201d Sporting a bushy    beard, a black pirate hat and   Mr. McGregor, like many attendees, is a \u201cgray nomad,\u201d a movement of retirees and older citizens who traverse the country in trailers. The prevalence of    vehicles, in particular, has opened up tourism in the outback. And Birdsville, Mr. McGregor said, has become a destination in itself, a \u201cbeacon in the desert. \u201d Established in the 1880s to collect tolls for cattle drovers moving across the borders of   Australia, Birdsville was once a thriving frontier town. When the tolls were abolished with the federation of six   colonies that united under the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901, the town, which sits on the Diamantina River, fell into decline. Those who stayed worked on cattle ranches. While the coastal areas of Australia developed, Birdsville\u2019s remote inland location ensured its isolation. \u201cYou can\u2019t just go down to the shop and buy things,\u201d Mrs. Brook said. \u201cYou always have to plan what you need for the next two months. \u201d She said that in the 1970s, the telegraph was the only way to connect with the outside world. A   flight brought fruit, vegetables, mail and a movie that residents would gather together at the Brook home to watch. The town\u2019s first telephone line was installed in 1986, and the first cell tower in 2011. Birdsville is expected to get broadband internet access next year. To travel to Birdsville, visitors had to fly or take the dangerous, dusty Birdsville Track, a   dirt road from Marree, in South Australia, which crosses three deserts. Mailmen willing to risk the hazardous, weekslong journey on the Birdsville Track became heroes. Tom Kruse, who delivered letters to outback properties from the 1930s to the 1950s in his Leyland Badger truck, was immortalized in the 1954 documentary \u201cThe Back of Beyond. \u201d In the 1960s, the perils of crossing the desert made national headlines when five members of the Page family  \u2014   Ernest Page his wife, Emma and their three children  \u2014   ran out of gas and water and died from dehydration after abandoning their car. Their partly decomposed bodies were found near Deadman\u2019s Sandhill under a coolibah tree on New Year\u2019s Day in 1964. Their brutal deaths, combined with Mr. Kruse\u2019s expeditions, helped cement the town in national legend. \u201cIt\u2019s become a bucket list for people,\u201d said Greg Donovan, founder of the Big Red Bash and its sister event, the Big Red Run, a   ultramarathon through the Simpson Desert. Tourism has become a mainstay. Visitors flock to the Birdsville Hotel, which has quenched thirsty travelers since 1884, and the Birdsville Bakery, celebrated for its curried camel pies, with meat from feral camels that roam the desert. \u201cI could have built a bakery in Marree to the south, Bedourie to the north, Quilpie to the east,\u201d said Robert \u201cDusty\u201d John Miller, the owner of the bakery. \u201cI would have failed in the first year because they don\u2019t have the iconic status this town\u2019s got. \u201d Even so, tourism, along with cattle rearing, has taken its toll on the desert. As a boy, Mr. Rowlands, the park ranger, hunted for \u201cbush tucker\u201d after school, catching wild goanna, the native monitor lizards, and snakes to cook over a pit of hot ash like his Aboriginal ancestors. \u201cNow, you can go down with a magnifying glass and find nothing,\u201d said Mr. Rowlands, 58. \u201cAnd here we have Birdsville full of people, but nobody really knows what has happened to the land. \u201d The town\u2019s infrastructure can also buckle under the pressure. During last year\u2019s Big Red Bash, the Birdsville Hotel ran out of food. This year, the Birdsville Bakery ran out of bread, and the town\u2019s power grid failed. \u201cWe\u2019re building our own little minicity with facilities, sanitations, rubbish,\u201d said Mr. Donovan, noting that almost everything needed to be transported for hundreds of miles on dirt roads. \u201cIf you have a bit of rain, those roads get closed. There are no shortcuts. \u201d Mr. Donovan, who is from Sydney, applauded the \u201cshe\u2019  \u201d optimism of the residents. \u201cIn the bush, you have your good years and your bad years, and people roll with that. \u201d Yet, with meager employment opportunities, few young people stay. Tourism is limited to the winter months, when temperatures are more temperate. In summer, \u201cit\u2019s back to the old days,\u201d said Lucas Trihey, who organizes events at the Big Red Bash. \u201cThere\u2019s no one around. You can\u2019t go outside and eat a sandwich. It will end up full of sand. There\u2019s a real frontier feel. \u201d Recreation in the summer shrinks to barbecues, swimming in the billabong, and drinking stubbies, or bottles of beer, on Big Red under the stars. But, Mr. Miller said, the lack of diversions has helped foster real community spirit in the town. \u201cWe need one another,\u201d he said as he as he got up to dispense another curried camel pie to a hungry customer.'"}, "time": 1742562112.1647081}
