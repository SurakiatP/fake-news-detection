[\u201cAudi, new champion of women\u2019s equity at work, has no women on their board,\u201d editor Judd Legum wrote on Twitter:  Audi, new champion of women\u2019s equity at work, has no women on their board pic. twitter.   \u2014   Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) February 6, 2017,  No women sit on Audi\u2019s Management Board, but its   team of American executives includes two women. Legum was not alone in his criticism of the ad 25 percent of the comments on the ad across social media were negative, Business Insider reports. The ad begins with a father watching his daughter in a race, asking himself, \u201cWhat do I tell my daughter?\u201d \u201cDo I tell her that her grandpa is worth more than her grandma? That her dad is worth more than her mom?\u201d the narrator asks. The father wonders how he can tell his daughter that despite \u201cher education, her drive, her skills, her intelligence,\u201d she still runs the risk of \u201cbeing valued less than every man she ever meets. \u201d At the end, his daughter wins the race, and she and her father walk to an Audi right before the slogan \u201cprogress is for everyone\u201d flashes across the screen. The company decided to make a statement about gender pay equality on Twitter by saying, \u201cAt Audi, we are committed to equal pay for equal work. \u201d Despite what Audi claims in the ad, the gender pay gap is not wide. According to the Daily Beast, the   gender pay gap is merely the difference between the average earnings of all men and women working fulltime. The statistic does not take into account factors such as differences in occupations, positions, education, job tenure, or hours worked per week. Once those factors are included, the wage gap is only a   difference, and no one knows whether the cause is discrimination or some other    difference between the genders.'"}, "time": 1742562551.8795843}
