[\u201cIt\u2019s a very, very important day an absolutely monumental day for Western civilisation for democracy for the will of the people,\u201d he began. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly important day for my country, and for the future of the Western world.  \u201cToday is the day the British government will formally advise the European Union that we intend to leave the EU, after a tumultuous   relationship that culminated in that shock victory for the ordinary man and woman on June 23rd last year. \u201d Believe in Britain. Vote to Leave EU. https:  .   \u2014   Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) June 23, 2016,  \u201cIt is a day I will never forget from voting in the same polling station as the Prime Minister, to touring across the   of England and around London  \u2014   my car speakers were blaring \u2018The Final Countdown\u2019 by the band Europe  \u2014   to later that night, when the votes began to trickle in, into the early hours when we realised, \u2018Oh my God. We might have actually done it\u2019,\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd honestly, I couldn\u2019t believe it. I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes, nor my ears, as I stood next to Nigel Farage and the news anchors gulped with trepidation: \u2018Ladies and gentlemen, Britain has voted out of the European Union\u2019  \u2014   I get chills just thinking about it. \u201d We\u2019ve only gone and bloody done it! !! pic. twitter.   \u2014   Raheem Kassam (@RaheemKassam) June 24, 2016,  \u201cWe now set off on an exciting road, full of possibilities, as a once again sovereign nation in a world desperate for change. \u201cToday marks a day not just for the United Kingdom, but for our great allies and trading partners around the world, who we so churlishly turned our backs on when the European Union came knocking, claiming to have a trade deal we couldn\u2019t refuse. \u201cBut the situation today has changed,\u201d Kassam declared. \u201cEmerging markets, as found in the Commonwealth, are growing faster than our European partners. The Continent turned its back on controlled migration and effective borders European leaders decided to pursue political, financial, and military union as a new kind of empire, dominated by Germany, with a single currency, a flag and an anthem  \u2014   so utterly foreign and devoid of all meaning to we British that we found ourselves with no other option but to say \u2018Nope, not for us. Not anymore.\u2019 \u201cIn short, our Prime Minister\u2019s letter to the European Union today will say, \u2018Thanks for the memories, even though they weren\u2019t so great\u2019. \u201d Kassam also looked forward to a renaissance for the historic   friendship, and a renewal of the bonds of loyalty which bind Great Britain to its kith and kin in the Commonwealth of Nations. \u201cA new dawn has broken for our pioneering nation and our allies around the world: American, India, Australia, Canada  \u2026     \u201cWe still want to be good neighbours with our European friends, but we don\u2019t want to live in the same cramped apartment with them, treading on each other\u2019s toes and arguing about what to watch on the television  \u2014   no. \u201cInstead, Britannia and Uncle Sam will be able to stand shoulder to shoulder once again, unimpeded, unencumbered, and free to project the pioneering values we always have throughout modern history: liberty, the will of people, the rule of law, and importantly, alongside all these things, pride. \u201cPride in who we are as a people, pride in who we are as a nation, pride in what both we can achieve independently and in free and open relationships that we are not forced to be a part of, but that we choose to be a part of. \u201d Addressing listeners in the U. S. directly, Kassam emphasised: \u201cOur great nations both underwent major seismic changes last year, ladies and gentlemen, and today, on Article 50 day in Britain, I say this to you: Now marks our greatest opportunity to deliver a better world for our children, and our children\u2019s children, than we will ever get again in our lifetimes. \u201cHappy Article 50 Day, ladies and gentlemen!\u201d  '"}, "time": 1742561937.186971}
