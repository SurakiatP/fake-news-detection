Why, Gen. Kelly? When POTUS has repeatedly  aggressively attacked the press? https:  .   \u2014   Jim Sciutto (@jimsciutto) May 17, 2017,  I fought with John Kelly in Iraq. This is shocking to me, and it\u2019s not a funny joke. Professionals don\u2019t say these kinds of things. https:  .   \u2014   Mark Hertling (@MarkHertling) May 17, 2017,  Here\u2019s a shitty thing to say to in front of hundreds of JOs who just swore to defend the Constitution of the US https:  .   \u2014   Adam Weinstein (@AdamWeinstein) May 17, 2017,  If it wasn\u2019t already clear, DHS John   about killing the   not the champion of democratic norms he once appeared to be. https:  .   \u2014   Katherine Eban (@KatherineEban) May 17, 2017,  But, Gen.

No politician in history, and I say this with great surety, has been treated worse or more unfairly,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t get elected to serve the Washington media or special interests. I got elected to serve the forgotten men and women of our country, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing,\u201d he added.'"}, "time": 1742562351.797697}
