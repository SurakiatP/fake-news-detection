Until recently, that view worked quite well. Over the past decade, through its own products and the many copycats that piled on, Apple\u2019s   aestheticism has made computers easier to use and more accessible to more people around the world  \u2014   and raked in   profits while doing so. Yet Apple\u2019s view increasingly feels like an outdated way of thinking about tech. Many of its competitors have been moving beyond devices toward experiences that transcend them. These new technologies exist not on distinct pieces of hardware, but above and within them. They are things like Alexa, Amazon\u2019s ambient assistant, which lives on the internet and is ready to help you on the Amazon Echo but also on any other device that a programmer adds it to. In an era of flat iPhone sales, Apple, too, has been talking up the importance of online services, which it sees as a crucial part of its future growth. So the primary question Apple had to answer at its annual developer conference this week was whether it could expand its worldview. Could it break free from the limiting perspective of individual devices? The answer: Yes, but slowly  \u2014   and it\u2019s hard to tell if Apple is thinking big enough. What was obvious in the hurricane of new features unveiled by Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, and his lieutenants was that they understood the importance of   services. Many of Apple\u2019s announcements featured some role for the internet to integrate people\u2019s experiences on disparate Apple devices, often with the help of artificial intelligence. But a lot of these features felt small bore. Apple still seems to view online services as   to its devices  \u2014   not as products or platforms that rise above them. The best way to see the shortcomings of this position is through Siri, the voice assistant that is Apple\u2019s best chance to create the kind of transcendent,   experience that its competitors are now pushing. Analysts and developers were expecting big improvements to Siri. Apple did show off a way for some apps to integrate with Siri and for Siri to perform a few new functions on Apple TV Siri also found a new home on Macintosh computers. But the way Apple presented the changes, with each Siri advance positioned as a feature of one of Apple\u2019s devices, left unclear what Apple\u2019s ultimate aims were for the voice assistant. The new features fall short of remaking Siri into something fundamentally different from what it is today. Siri, as Apple is positioning it, is becoming a better app launcher for your phone  \u2014   you can use it to call for an Uber ride or to respond to a message. But it\u2019s not clear that it\u2019s becoming a truly intelligent assistant, one that understands you across your devices, that can comprehend complex queries and get things done for you regardless of which apps you happen to have installed on any particular machine. These shortcomings are not terrible. Though many competitors have shown off some interesting demos, at the moment no rival voice assistant approaches the accuracy and ease of use of an actual human assistant. Siri is hardly behind, and there is still room for it to become the leader. Yet the way Apple approaches Siri is a proxy for the way it plans to approach online services generally. Before we get to the limitations, here are the details on what\u2019s new with Siri: First, the voice assistant can now control some   apps on your phone. You can send text messages through apps like WhatsApp or Slack using your voice  \u2014   in the past, you could do so only with Apple\u2019s own messaging app. Depending on which developers add Siri to their apps, you might also be able to use your voice to call a ride from Uber or Lyft, to pay someone through Venmo or to tell a fitness app to start tracking your workout. Siri\u2019s other new trick is Mac compatibility. You can now ask your desktop or laptop to search through your files or email, for instance. These are all fine improvements. But I am struck by the deliberate way Apple is rolling them out. One problem is that the new Siri will not integrate with all kinds of apps. It will be able to control only a handful of app types, including messaging apps,   apps, payment apps and fitness apps. Yet Siri won\u2019t let you control music apps, for example  \u2014   you can\u2019t ask Siri to play a song on Spotify, a feature reserved for use with Apple\u2019s own music subscription service. This limitation could be relaxed with time. Apple reps told me the   integrations they had outlined so far were the start of a new effort  \u2014   one that could be expanded to new app types in the future. Still, the lack of music support was a letdown. It\u2019s hard to shake the suspicion that Apple is using Siri to give its own apps a leg up. Another problem is that Siri is still hopelessly tied to each Apple device. Siri on your iPhone doesn\u2019t really know anything about Siri on your Mac or Apple TV. On each device, Siri has different capabilities: On your iPhone it can call an Uber, if you have the Uber app installed, but Siri on your Mac can\u2019t. Siri on your Apple TV can search YouTube for clips of Stephen Curry, but Siri on your iPhone can\u2019t. For now, this isn\u2019t a big problem  \u2014   you will learn what Siri can do on each device and adjust your queries accordingly. But that\u2019s a curious thing to have to do. If Siri is an intelligent assistant, why does she need to be tied to apps you have installed on your device? Why can\u2019t she call Uber from the cloud, regardless of which device you happen to be using? The   view gets particularly limiting when you think about asking your assistant complicated questions. For instance, what if you ask, \u201cCan you see if there\u2019s a room at my favorite Seattle hotel for my wedding anniversary weekend  \u2014   and can you book it if it\u2019s less than $200 a night?\u201d Google, in its demo for Home, a forthcoming voice assistant device meant to rival Amazon\u2019s Echo, seemed to be able to handle such questions. Two    \u2014   Viv, which was founded by members of the team that created the original Siri app that Apple bought in 2010, and SoundHound have also unveiled systems that can tackle such complex queries. To handle these questions, an assistant would need to pull information from multiple online services. For instance, booking that Seattle hotel would involve knowing your favorite place to stay, your wedding anniversary date and current hotel prices. It wouldn\u2019t make sense if that question worked only on certain devices or only if you had certain apps installed ideally, it should work on any device. And that would be very useful. One of the frustrations of the era ushered in by the iPhone is app overload  \u2014   there are too many apps to download, install and switch between to get anything done. A lot of these apps are of little use: You might tap that   app once a year, so why does it have to sit there on your phone? Voice interfaces could usher in a new paradigm in computing, one that would break free of the tyranny of apps on devices. They could get a lot done for us without much tapping and switching. Google, Amazon and several   seem to be rushing headlong to build such a system. But based on its developer conference, I\u2019m not sure Apple is. It\u2019s taking a more moderate     path. Many of its voice features will be fine  \u2014   useful, even. But it sure isn\u2019t pushing for a revolution.'"}, "time": 1742563316.8772507}
