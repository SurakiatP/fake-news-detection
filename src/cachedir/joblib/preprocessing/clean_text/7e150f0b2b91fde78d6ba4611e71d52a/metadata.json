[McDonough would only say that President Barack Obama considered Donald Trump\u2019s election \u201cfreely elected. \u201d  He added that the Democrats that are boycotting Trump\u2019s inauguration on Friday have \u201csignificant\u201d concerns. Specifically, McDonough suggested that Trump\u2019s election was influenced by Russia. He also suggested Trump could allay those concerns by \u201creaching out\u201d to Democrats who refused to attend the ceremony. The following exchange took place: Tapper: There are now at least eighteen House democrats who are boycotting the Trump inauguration. Does President Obama think that\u2019s appropriate, or do they think, does he think they should follow his lead and attend for the sake of honoring the office and the peaceful transfer of power? McDonough: Well, the president has made very clear since the election that we should do everything in our power in this transition period to make sure that the next president and his team are up and ready to go. In fact, on Tuesday night in a speech he called him the \u201cfreely elected\u201d President of the United States. So that\u2019s the charge that we have taken. By the same token these Democrats and others have pointed out that they\u2019ve got a significant concerns. And we found some of those concerns  \u2014   the intelligence shows that the Russians did intervene, and they did intervene with the purpose of helping one candidate, and hurting the other. So these are by no means, uh, trivial concerns. So my hope would be that the   will reach out to somebody as consequential and somebody who is such a leader as John Lewis, who has done so many things over the course of his life, to try to work this out. And hopefully it\u2019s not just reach out to him, but pursue some of the policies that Mr. Lewis has literally fought, bled, and gone to jail for over the course of his remarkable life. And that would be that kind of thing that would not only send a message to the American people that we\u2019re prepared to work together, but would also sent a message to the Russians that we are united, their efforts to divide us, to weaken us, to advance their own interest at the expense of ours, are going to fail. McDonough was referring to the spat between Trump and Rep. John Lewis ( ) who recently called Trump \u201cillegitimate\u201d because of a \u201cconspiracy\u201d by Russia. (Trump responded by questioning Lewis\u2019s commitment to his district.) Tapper followed up to clarify whether President Obama considered Trump \u201clegitimate\u201d: Tapper: Just to be clear though, President Obama thinks that   Trump is legitimate. McDonough: The President has made very clear that he believes that he is the \u201cfreely elected\u201d president. He will be inaugurated on Friday, and he will come into office hopefully strengthened by the kind of transition that we\u2019ve tried to run in this White House. Tapper followed up by asking McDonough whether, given Trump\u2019s own efforts to question Obama\u2019s legitimacy with the \u201cBirther\u201d theory, \u201cshould put this away, this whole idea of legitimate, illegitimate. \u201d McDonough declined: \u201cThe president\u2019s not going to get into the middle of this right now. \u201d Joel B.
