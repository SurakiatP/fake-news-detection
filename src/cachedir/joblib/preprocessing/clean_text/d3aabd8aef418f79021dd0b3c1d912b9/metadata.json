That\u2019s not cool \u2014 if anyone\u2019s going to doctor the footage in a Michael Moore movie, its going to be Michael Moore. \\nObviously Moore\u2019s not a Donald Trump fan, and like many other liberals this weekend, he\u2019s not an Anthony Weiner fan. Setting aside Judicial Watch\u2019s lawsuit against the State Department, Hillary Clinton almost looked to be in the clear a few months back, but now her email shenanigans have returned to the front pages, all because of Weiner\u2019s compulsion to send vulgar selfies online. Unbelievable that once again Hillary has to suffer the abuse of men & their dickish behavior. Bubba, Weiner, Trump, Newt, Comey. Sick of it. \\n\u2014 Michael Moore (@MMFlint) October 29, 2016 \\nWhat did Bill Clinton do that was so wrong? Hillary long ago established that he was the victim of a vast right-wing conspiracy. And Weiner? Sure, be angry at him for the way he\u2019s treated his wife and the women he\u2019s sexted, but there would be no sensitive emails on his laptop if Hillary and company had simply used the secure government email accounts provided to them. \\nMoore was just getting started on his misandrist rant, and when he\u2019s on a roll, it\u2019s best to step away until he\u2019s finished it. The day can\\'t come soon enough when women will take charge. Public policy will not be decided by dick pix, Tic Tacs, grab-assers or the GOP. \\n\u2014 Michael Moore (@MMFlint) October 29, 2016 No women ever invented an atomic bomb, built a smoke stack, initiated a Holocaust, melted the polar ice caps or organized a school shooting. \\n\u2014 Michael Moore (@MMFlint) October 29, 2016 @MMFlint wowwww? Women can\\'t do ANYTHING\u2026\u2026 \\n\u2014 Nitro Rad (@NitroRad) October 29, 2016 \\nWhat about all those soccer moms tooling around in minivans and SUVs? The ones manufactured in Michigan, by union workers, in factories with smokestacks? And don\u2019t be so quick to count out women   atomic bomb, either. @MMFlint You might to do a little reading on that atom bomb thingie. You could not be more wrong. \\n\u2014 Terry O\\' (@IrishTea1) October 29, 2016 @MMFlint lots of women were on the Manhattan Project. You just demeaned them and belittled their efforts to support a warmonger\u2026 \\n\u2014 Charlie Reed (@CharlieReed2004) October 29, 2016 RT @MMFlint \" No women ever invented an atomic bomb\" \\nLeona Woods among others worked on the Manhattan Project. https://t.co/fay4GNLAzy'"}, "time": 1742628323.0936186}
