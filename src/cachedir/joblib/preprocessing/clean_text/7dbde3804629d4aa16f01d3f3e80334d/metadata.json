Soldiers stand watch over bakeries. The police fire rubber bullets at desperate mobs storming grocery stores, pharmacies and butcher shops. A    girl was shot to death as street gangs fought over food. Venezuela is convulsing from hunger. Hundreds of people here in the city of Cuman\u00e1, home to one of the region\u2019s independence heroes, marched on a supermarket in recent days, screaming for food. They forced open a large metal gate and poured inside. They snatched water, flour, cornmeal, salt, sugar, potatoes, anything they could find, leaving behind only broken freezers and overturned shelves. And they showed that even in a country with the largest oil reserves in the world, it is possible for people to riot because there is not enough food. In the last two weeks alone, more than 50 food riots, protests and mass looting have erupted around the country. Scores of businesses have been stripped bare or destroyed. At least five people have been killed. This is precisely the Venezuela its leaders vowed to prevent. In one of the nation\u2019s worst moments,  riots spread from Caracas, the capital, in 1989, leaving hundreds dead at the hands of security forces. Known as the \u201cCaracazo,\u201d or the \u201cCaracas clash,\u201d they were set off by low oil prices, cuts in subsidies and a population that was suddenly impoverished. The event seared the memory of a future president, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who said the country\u2019s inability to provide for its people, and the state\u2019s repression of the uprising, were the reasons Venezuela needed a socialist revolution. Now his successors find themselves in a similar bind  \u2014   or maybe even worse. The nation is anxiously searching for ways to feed itself. The economic collapse of recent years has left it unable to produce enough food on its own or import what it needs from abroad. Cities have been militarized under an emergency decree from President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, the man Mr. Ch\u00e1vez picked to carry on with his revolution before he died three years ago. \u201cIf there is no food, there will be more riots,\u201d said Raibelis Henriquez, 19, who waited all day for bread in Cuman\u00e1, where at least 22 businesses were attacked in a single day last week. But while the riots and clashes punctuate the country with alarm, it is the hunger that remains the constant source of unease. A staggering 87 percent of Venezuelans say they do not have money to buy enough food, the most recent assessment of living standards by Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar University found. About 72 percent of monthly wages are being spent just to buy food, according to the Center for Documentation and Social Analysis, a research group associated with the Venezuelan Teachers Federation. In April, it found that a family would need the equivalent of 16   salaries to properly feed itself. Ask people in this city when they last ate a meal, and many will respond that it was not today. Among them are Leidy Cordova, 37, and her five children  \u2014   Abran, Deliannys, Eliannys, Milianny and Javier Luis  \u2014   ages 1 to 11. On Thursday evening, the entire family had not eaten since lunchtime the day before, when Ms. Cordova made a soup by boiling chicken skin and fat that she had found for a cheap price at the butcher. \u201cMy kids tell me they\u2019re hungry,\u201d Ms. Cordova said as her family looked on. \u201cAnd all I can say to them is to grin and bear it. \u201d Other families have to choose who eats. Lucila Fonseca, 69, has lymphatic cancer, and her    daughter, Vanessa Furtado, has a brain tumor. Despite also being ill, Ms. Furtado gives up the little food she has on many days so her mother does not skip meals. \u201cI used to be very fat, but no longer,\u201d the daughter said. \u201cWe are dying as we live. \u201d Her mother added, \u201cWe are now living on Maduro\u2019s diet: no food, no nothing. \u201d Economists say years of economic mismanagement  \u2014   worsened by low prices for oil, the nation\u2019s main source of revenue  \u2014   have shattered the food supply. Sugar fields in the country\u2019s agricultural center lie fallow for lack of fertilizers. Unused machinery rots in shuttered   factories. Staples like corn and rice, once exported, now must be imported and arrive in amounts that do not meet the need. In response, Mr. Maduro has tightened his grip over the food supply. Using emergency decrees he signed this year, the president put most food distribution in the hands of a group of citizen brigades loyal to leftists, a measure critics say is reminiscent of food rationing in Cuba. \u201cThey\u2019re saying, in other words, you get food if you\u2019re my friend, if you\u2019re my sympathizer,\u201d said Roberto   the director of the Venezuelan Violence Observatory, a human rights group. It was all a new reality for Gabriel M\u00e1rquez, 24, who grew up in the boom years when Venezuela was rich and empty shelves were unimaginable. He stood in front of the destroyed supermarket where the mob had arrived at Cuman\u00e1, an endless expanse of smashed bottles, boxes and scattered shelves. A few people, including a policeman, were searching the wreckage for leftovers to take. \u201cDuring Carnival, we used to throw eggs at each other just to have some fun,\u201d he said. \u201cNow an egg is like gold. \u201d Down the coastal road in a small fishing town called Boca de Uchire, hundreds gathered on a bridge this month to protest because the food deliveries were not arriving. Residents demanded to meet the mayor, but when he did not come they sacked a Chinese bodega. Residents hacked open the door with pickaxes and pillaged the shop, venting their anger at a global power that has lent billions of dollars to prop up Venezuela in recent years. \u201cThe Chinese won\u2019t sell to us,\u201d said a taxi driver who watched the crowd haul away all that was inside. \u201cSo we burn their stores instead. \u201d Mr. Maduro, who is fighting a push for a referendum to recall him this year over the country\u2019s declines, said it was the political opposition that was behind the attacks on the stores. \u201cThey paid a group of criminals, brought them in trucks,\u201d he said on Saturday on television, promising compensation to those who lost property. At the same time, the government also blames an \u201ceconomic war\u201d for the shortages. It accuses wealthy business owners of hoarding food and charging exorbitant prices, creating artificial shortages to profit from the country\u2019s misery. It has left shop owners feeling under siege, particularly those who do not have Spanish names. \u201cLook how we are working today,\u201d said Maria Basmagi, whose family immigrated from Syria a generation ago, pointing to the metal grate pulled over the window of her shoe store. Her shop was on the commercial boulevard in Barcelona, another coastal town racked by unrest last week. At 11 a. m. the day before, someone screamed that there was an attack on a   kitchen nearby. Every shop on Ms. Basmagi\u2019s street closed down in fear. Other shops stay open, like the bakery in Cuman\u00e1 where a line of 100 people snaked around a corner. Each person was allowed to buy about a pound of bread. Robert Astudillo, a    father of two, was not sure there would be any left once his turn came. He said he still had corn flour to make arepas, a Venezuelan staple, for his children. They had not eaten meat in months. \u201cWe make the arepas small,\u201d he said. In the refrigerator of Araselis Rodriguez and Nestor Daniel Reina, the parents of four small children, there was not even corn flour  \u2014   just a few limes and some bottles of water. The family had eaten bread for breakfast and soup for lunch made from fish that Mr. Reina had managed to catch. The family had nothing for dinner. It has not always been clear what provokes the riots. Is it hunger alone? Or is it some larger anger that has built up in a country that has crumbled? In\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez was not sure. She remembered calling out to the crowd of people who had come to sack her restaurant on Tuesday night, offering them all the chicken and rice the restaurant had if they would only leave the furniture and cash register behind. They balked at the offer and simply pushed her aside, Ms. Rodr\u00edguez said. \u201cIt is the meeting of hunger and crime now,\u201d she said. As she spoke, three trucks with armed patrols drove by, each emblazoned with photos of Mr. Ch\u00e1vez and Mr. Maduro. The trucks were carrying food. \u201cFinally they come here,\u201d Ms. Rodr\u00edguez said. \u201cAnd look what it took to get them. It took this riot to get us something to eat. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563289.7008262}
