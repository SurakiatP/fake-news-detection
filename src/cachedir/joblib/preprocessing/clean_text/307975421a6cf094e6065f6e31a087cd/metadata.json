Saturday are \u201cmostly white\u201d and experiencing \u201ctherapy\u201d for their anxiety over Hillary Clinton\u2019s election loss to Donald Trump in November, the Washington Post reports. [Planned Parenthood tweeted:  We stand shoulder to shoulder with all women in the struggle for equality  justice. #WhyIMarch   @womensmarch pic. twitter.   \u2014   Planned Parenthood (@PPFA) January 21, 2017,  According to the Post: Marchers  \u2014   mostly women and mostly white  \u2014   said they came to take the most public possible stand against Trump, a candidate and now president whom they said routinely insults women and the issues they care about. But the gathering also provided therapy for many, the balm of immersing themselves in a   sea of citizens who had shared their anxiety and disappointment after Democrat Hillary Clinton\u2019s historic bid for the presidency ended in defeat. The report notes some of the women are \u201csometimes sleeping on the couches of people they had never met before\u201d due to the vast crowd participating in the march. \u201cOrganizers, who originally sought a permit for a gathering of 200, 000, said Saturday they now expect as many as a half million participants  \u2014   potentially dwarfing Friday\u2019s inaugural crowd,\u201d the report says: 12 Ways You Can Fight Back Against All This Oppressive Crap In 2017: https:  .  via @buzzfeed #IDEFY,  \u2014   Planned Parenthood (@PPFA) January 20, 2017,  The march\u2019s central focus appears to be to protect abortion chain Planned Parenthood from taxpayer defunding, one of the stated goals of the Trump administration. Though cast as a \u201cwomen\u2019s rights\u201d march,   women who attempted to register for the march were refused. \u201cIf you want to come to the march you are coming with the understanding that you respect a woman\u2019s right to choose,\u201d Linda Sarsour, a   Muslim racial justice and civil rights activist, and a chairwoman of the event, told the New York Times. Feminist Gloria Steinem and Planned Parenthood have partnered for the event, providing it with its decidedly   tone. On her website, Steinem says to her fans: We have all the powers we had [before Trump was elected] of lobbying and pressuring and making clear that the political consequences are great. We may look up and feel powerless and think there\u2019s nothing we can do, but it\u2019s not true. There are things we can do at each level. And there\u2019s always civil disobedience. Trump is not my president. Steinem also recently said she would refuse to pay the full amount of her federal income tax if Planned Parenthood\u2019s taxpayer funds were eliminated. Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards said about the march: We will send a strong message to the incoming administration that millions of people across this country are prepared to fight attacks on reproductive health care, abortion services, and access to Planned Parenthood, as they intersect with the rights of young people, people of color, immigrants, and people of all faiths, backgrounds, and incomes. According to the march\u2019s website, its mission is to \u201csend a bold message to our new government on their first day in office, and to the world that women\u2019s rights are human rights. \u201d Democrat Sens. Patty Murray (WA) and Elizabeth Warren (MA) are supporting Planned Parenthood: Today, we stood with Planned Parenthood and the millions of women  men who don\u2019t want to see their health care taken away.   pic. twitter.   \u2014   Senator Patty Murray (@PattyMurray) January 20, 2017,  Despite its message of unity among all the left\u2019s political identity groups, the Times previously reported the \u201cWomen\u2019s March\u201d has been anything but unified from its inception: On the march group\u2019s Facebook page, it is easy to see how complicated the idea of the \u201cwomen\u2019s vote,\u201d an already mythological concept, has become, and how difficult it might be for organizers to fulfill their aim of gathering women who remain fiercely divided on reproductive rights, gun control,   marriage and immigration, among other issues. Not everyone on the page believes, for instance, that Hillary Clinton would have made a good president, or that Stephen K. Bannon, a chief strategist under Mr. Trump, holds divisive views about minorities. Debates over both have sprung up in recent days. Bob Bland, one of the march\u2019s organizers, said in an email that organizers in Maryland had to change a Facebook page from public to private to protect the safety of women who want to attend. Writing at the Week, abortion rights supporter Shikha Dalmia asserts the demonstration has already failed in its mission. \u201cDemonstrations serve a useful function in a democracy  \u2014   but only when they have clarity of purpose,\u201d she writes, adding that the march is \u201cshaping up to be a   exercise in search of a cause. \u201d Dalmia writes some of the \u201cabsurdity\u201d related to the event stems from \u201cthe fact that they are billing this event as the voice of women when 42 percent of women (and 62 percent of   educated white women) actually voted for Trump. \u201d She also observes \u201cthe   progressive hysteria over the event\u2019s name. \u201d The initial plan by the \u201cthree white women\u201d organizers, she says, was to call the event the \u201cMillion Women March,\u201d but the women were criticized for \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d for \u201callegedly poaching the heritage of the 1997 Million Woman March for black women. \u201d \u201cFeminists are confusing the issue by making Trump\u2019s threat about themselves,\u201d Dalmia concludes. \u201cIf they really wanted to help, they would have kept their powder dry for now, rather than embark on this confused and pointless march. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564154.338537}
