Higgins taking an elaborate detour from his official tour of South East Asia and ending up in a field in Laois, WWN can exclusively report. \\nAfter an historic visit to Vietnam, President Higgins was expected to then head to the neighbouring nation of Laos, but a GPS entry mishap on board Ireland\u2019s presidential jet sent the travelling party several thousand miles in the wrong direction. \\nDisembarking from the plane and unaware of his true location, the President was heard remarking \u201cI know it isn\u2019t a well off country but fuckin\u2019 hell this kip looks like Laois\u201d. The President then greeted a bewildered Portlaoise farmer, whose field the plane had landed in, by speaking fluent Thai. \\nThe President was said to livid after discovering that someone had erroneously typed \u2018Laois\u2019 into the plane\u2019s on-board GPS. \\n\u201cOne fuckin\u2019 holiday I wanted this year, just one fuckin\u2019 holiday and some eejit pilot has bollocks\u2019d it,\u201d the normally articulate leader shouted. \\n\u201cNow myself and Sabina are definitely going to miss that full moon party in Thailand,\u201d he angrily added.'"}, "time": 1742628373.5742562}
