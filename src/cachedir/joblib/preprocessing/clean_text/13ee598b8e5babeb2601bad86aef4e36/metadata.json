It was 57 years overdue. In her retirement, Ms. Roston, 72, decided to reread the book, which she had kept on her bookshelf for years, when she noticed the library\u2019s markings. On the last page, stuck to the paper pocket, was a sticker explaining the library\u2019s policy: \u201cGive your NEIGHBOR a chance to borrow this book. Return it on or before DUE DATE SHOWN ABOVE. The fee is 5\u00a2 per calendar day for each book kept overdue. \u201d This volume was due back on Nov. 18, 1959. After 20, 842 days since, Ms. Roston would owe the library $1, 042. 10. Ms. Roston, a Brooklyn native, checked out the book when she was 15. At the time she was a sales audit clerk at Macy\u2019s, making $1 an hour. Since then, she has lived in Massachusetts and Illinois, was married (her first wedding dance was to \u201cTara\u2019s Theme\u201d from the film version of \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d) raised four children and got divorced. All the while, the book had been with her. Until that Saturday this month, when she returned it. Ms. Roston is hardly the first New Yorker to have a really, really overdue book. In 2013, a guide to divorce was returned to the New York Public Library 36 years late. That same year, the New York library system received a copy of \u201cThe Fire of Francis Xavier,\u201d which had been checked out in 1958. Today, the Brooklyn Public Library charges 15 cents for each day that a piece of print material is overdue. After a patron racks up a $25 balance, and after 60 days, the library may report the borrower to a collections agency. The Crown Heights branch of the Brooklyn Public Library is a squat building topped with a large clock on New York Avenue. When Ms. Roston entered, she grabbed the nearest librarian and began whispering. She slowly pulled the book out of a tote bag. What followed was a lot of hushed giggling. \u201cOh, wow, this looks like, from a really long time ago,\u201d said Stefanie Sinn, a children\u2019s librarian. \u201cThis is, like, a relic. \u201d \u201cWell, I\u2019m kind of a relic, too,\u201d Ms. Roston said. The book was quickly shuttled to circulation. \u201cWe have a return, from the \u201950s,\u201d Ms. Sinn said. Fortunately for Ms. Roston, the book was not registered in the library\u2019s computer system, so she did not have to pay a late fee. \u201cI\u2019ve seen books returned late, but never one this old,\u201d said Lisa Rosenblum, the chief librarian of the Brooklyn Public Library, who later said she was delighted to have the book back in the library, \u201cfor its geeky, historical perspective. \u201d \u201cI showed my younger colleagues how you used to have to stamp a card, and what an accession number is,\u201d she said. \u201cThey just looked at me blankly. \u201d For her part, Ms. Roston made a $50 donation to the library. But the book will not be joining the library\u2019s 59 other \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d copies. It\u2019s too old and fragile. Instead, the library plans to put it on display, Ms. Rosenblum said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great reminder that it\u2019s always important to return your books,\u201d she said. \u201cEven 60 years late. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562003.5179565}
