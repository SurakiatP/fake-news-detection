The proof was perhaps more surreal than Thursday night\u2019s payoff: Instagram posts from LeBron James and Serena Williams. Manuel\u2019s friend and fellow trailblazer Lia Neal had forwarded the messages after stumbling across them on Twitter. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh my God, I wish I could see her reaction right now,\u2019\u201d Neal said. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t need to hear from anyone else. Those are like her two favorite athletes. \u201d Manuel\u2019s popularity got an emphatic spike after she became the first   woman to win an individual swimming event at the Olympics. Manuel, a    Texan, shared the gold medal with    Penny Oleksiak, who also made history, becoming the youngest gold medalist from Canada. James wrote that he watched the race with his daughter. Williams posted a picture of Manuel and Simone Biles, who won the gymnastics   gold medal, and called them  \u201camazing. \u201d One mother posted a photograph on Twitter of her exuberant young black daughter posing in front of a television screen that showed Manuel being interviewed. By early Friday evening, it had more than 12, 000 likes. \u201cI saw that picture,\u201d Neal said. \u201cI retweeted it. I was tearing up again. \u201d The top of the medals podium at Olympic Aquatics Stadium was crowded Thursday night, and not because there were   medalists for the first time in the Olympics since 2000, when Anthony Ervin, whose father is   and American Indian, tied his teammate Gary Hall Jr. in the 50 freestyle. Standing on the podium with her, Manuel said, were Neal, Ervin, Maritza Correira, Cullen Jones and all the black swimmers whose success shaped Manuel\u2019s dreams. \u201cThis medal is not just for me, it\u2019s for some of the   that have come before me, have been inspirations and mentors to me,\u201d Manuel said. In 2012, Neal became the second   woman to make a United States Olympic swim team, after Correia in 2004. Neal was 17 and a rising senior in high school. Neal and Correia earned medals as members of 4x100 freestyle relays in their first Olympics. Correia won a silver, Neal a bronze. On Saturday, Neal raced in the morning heat for the American 4x100 relay team, which later took the silver. Neal, a rising senior at Stanford who grew up in Brooklyn, was asked which medal she considers more precious, her silver or the gold that Manuel earned in an upset. \u201cI think Simone\u2019s gold,\u201d Neal said. \u201cI just felt more when she touched the wall and saw that she won. I knew exactly what went into winning that gold medal. \u201d Neal feels a sisterly bond to Manuel, who is one year behind her at Stanford. In the   to the Olympics, they often felt as if people saw their stories as being only skin deep. On the way to becoming the first two black women to grace the same United States Olympic swimming team, Neal and Manuel often compared notes after news media interviews. To their growing frustration, race was often discussed more than their races. \u201cWe talk about it and acknowledge that other people talk about it,\u201d Neal said, \u201cbut we\u2019re like \u2018O. K. we\u2019re here, like everyone else here we\u2019re training toward winning, toward representing their country in the best way possible. History comes along with that. \u201d She added, \u201cIt\u2019s cool because we\u2019re not seeking to make history or change lives, we\u2019re just doing what we love. \u201d Neal sat with Manuel roughly two hours before Thursday\u2019s final. They listened to music, including the song \u201c1, 2 Step\u201d by Ciara and Missy Elliott. Neal\u2019s parting words were \u201cPipe It Up,\u201d from Migos. Neal said she was shaking before Manuel\u2019s race and started crying during the last 10 meters when it dawned on her that Manuel might win. The prerace favorites were Cate Campbell of Australia, who lowered the world record to 52. 08 in July, and her sister, Bronte, who had clocked a 52. 58 in April. Manuel posted a 53. 32 in the heats, a 53. 11 in the semifinals and a 52. 70 in the final. \u201cI was super surprised,\u201d Manuel said after the race. \u201cI don\u2019t think there was a definitive point where I thought I had the race. \u201d How shocking was the outcome? Sarah Sjostrom, the Swede who finished third, said, \u201cPenny and the American girl winning, I think that was the biggest surprise of the meet. \u201d (Never mind that \u201cthe American girl\u201d had finished sixth, four places behind Sjostrom, in the   freestyle final at last summer\u2019s World Championships in Kazan, Russia). After Manuel finished giving interviews in the mixed zone, she fell into the arms of Neal and another Stanford teammate, Maya DiRado. \u201cShe was just bawling,\u201d Neal said. \u201cShe was like: \u2018I\u2019m so happy you guys are my teammates. I couldn\u2019t have done this without you guys. I love you. \u2019\u201d Manuel\u2019s sentiments meant the world to Neal, who was disappointed when she did not qualify for these Games in an individual event. \u201cWhy I broke down in tears and why I felt so much emotion when she won was because I was there with her every step of the way,\u201d Neal said. \u201cI knew exactly what it took to get to that point and win a gold medal firsthand. \u201d How long will it take for swimming in the United States to become colorblind? Is one gold enough to change the questions Manuel and Neal face? \u201cI think this definitely catapults us many steps forward,\u201d Neal said, adding, \u201cI think just that one medal will bring so many different people into the sport and inspire so many different people. \u201d Manuel, who on Friday qualified for Saturday\u2019s   freestyle final, said she looked forward to the day when she is known simply as a champion. After the 100 final, she said, \u201cI would like there to be a day where there are more of us and it\u2019s not Simone, the black swimmer, because the title \u2018black swimmer\u2019 makes it seem like I\u2019m not supposed to be able to win a gold medal or I\u2019m not supposed to be able to break records. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561701.4821358}
