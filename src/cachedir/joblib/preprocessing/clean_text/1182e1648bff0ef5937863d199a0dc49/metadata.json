[The leaders of France, Germany, Italy, and Spain have all snubbed this year\u2019s forum, as has the Commission leadership, preferring instead to send finance ministers, in the case of the four nations, and five commissioners.  Their decision not to attend means they will not play a role in what is set to be a   between China and the incoming Trump administration on how to address the popular opposition to globalisation. Their absence will also deny Britain\u2019s prime minister, Theresa May, an opportunity to sound out her counterparts on issues surrounding Brexit, just weeks before she is due to enact Article 50 and begin the process of withdrawing Britain from the EU. Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected to dominate this year\u2019s World Economic Forum (WEF) held annually at the Swiss ski resort of Davos. The first Chinese president to attend the Forum, Xi is expected to take on   Donald Trump\u2019s   rhetoric during his keynote speech, by putting forward his views on steering \u201ceconomic globalization towards greater inclusiveness\u201d. As the Forum runs between   January, with the closing ceremony due to take place just hours before Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration as president, he will be represented by Anthony Scaramucci, a member of his transition team. The Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Li Baodong has told reporters that \u201cchannels of communication\u201d will be open between the Chinese delegation and Trump\u2019s transition team at the forum, although no formal meeting has yet been scheduled. The U. S. will also be represented by a strong delegation led by outgoing   Joe Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry. So far, Britain\u2019s Theresa May, Ireland\u2019s Enda Kenny, Mark Rutte of The Netherlands, and Sweden\u2019s Stefan L\u00f6fven, among other European leaders, are expected to attend. WEF founder Klaus Shwab has said that this year\u2019s meeting must make progress on the problems facing the world, and has argued that populism isn\u2019t the answer. At a   press conference, Shwab said: \u201cEvery simplified approach to deal with the global complex agenda is condemned to fail. \u201cWe cannot just have populist solutions. \u201cThe problems we face technologically, economically, socially and politically are so tremendous, such that sustainable solutions requite a systemic, holistic approach [  \u2026    ] and particularly the collaboration of all global stakeholders, united in one mission  \u2014   improving the state of the world. \u201d In total, aproximately 3, 000 participants will attend the event, including 1, 800 business leaders and around 50 heads of state, including the leaders of Paraguay, Afghanistan, Rwanda, Pakistan, Ukraine, and South Africa, among others. Hollywood stars Matt Damon and Forest Whittaker and the singer Shakira are also set to make an appearance.'"}, "time": 1742564229.668456}
