They work in an area also known as Red Light Zone, where women can sell sex between 7pm and 7am without being arrested. \\nSammi Jo, who had to be taken from her parents as a child due to abuse, said she turned to drugs and drink \u201cas a comfort.\u201d \\nMother-of-three Kayleigh recounted how despite her family\u2019s attempts to help her get clean she would quickly relapse. \\n\u201cI came off of it and within two days I robbed my brother\u2019s PlayStation games to go sell for money, and that just led into a routine of, I\u2019d have heroin, go work, and I\u2019d have heroin to forget about working,\u201d she told the program. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a total vicious cycle.\u201d \\nBut sex workers union English Collective of Prostitutes (ECP) believes the show is \u201cbiased\u201d and shows only the darker side of the industry. \\n\u201cThis BBC3 film is yet another biased piece on the sex industry,\u201d a spokeswoman for the group told RT. \\n\u201cMost street-based sex workers are not drug users yet the film chooses to focuses only on women on drugs. It ignores the truth that in many areas around the UK the majority of sex workers are on the streets because of benefit cuts and sanctions. \\n\u201cIf the press ignore that they are colluding with the government in hiding the devastating consequences of their austerity policies, 80 percent of which have targeted women.\u201d \\nThe group said the Red Light Zone provides Leeds sex workers with a safe environment to operate. \\nAccording to local police, prostitutes have been three times more likely to report violent incidents since decriminalization came into place in Holbeck. In the first year, between 2014 and 2015, 61 violent incidents were reported to the police. The previous year only 49 cases of assault were reported. \\n\u201cSome women were glad to work in the Leeds \u2018no arrest zone\u2019 because it meant they weren\u2019t being constantly harassed by the police,\u201d the ECP spokeswoman added. Immigration raids \\nThe ECP said it is the police themselves who are endangering the lives of sex workers. \\n\u201cSince the immigration crackdown everyone is on edge and hiding from officials. Women feel that once again the police are prioritizing criminalization over protection and this is deterring them from reporting violence,\u201d the group complained. \\nLast week the London Metropolitan Police raided six massage parlors in Soho and Chinatown, arresting 24 people \u2013 17 of whom were seized on \u201csuspicion of immigration offenses.\u201d \\nThe Met released a statement saying the operation was \u201caimed at bringing to justice those who seek to profit from the exploitation of vulnerable people.\u201d \\nThe ECP, however, claims the swoops are \u201cpart of a racist witch-hunt against migrant sex workers, which has got worse since Brexit, even though women have the right to be here under EU law.\u201d \\nVia RT .
