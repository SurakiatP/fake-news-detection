But back when the economy shrank considerably during the first quarter of the Obama administration, there was no attempt to link the contraction to the president. [The Commerce Department reported last week that Gross Domestic Product only grew 0. 7 percent during the first quarter of 2017, following a gain of 2. 1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016.  The Associated Press claimed that the slow GDP growth in the beginning of 2017 \u201cmarks the first quarterly economic report card for President Donald Trump, who has vowed to rev up the U. S. economy. \u201d \u201cAmericans say they feel more optimistic about the economy since President Trump was elected,\u201d The New York Times wrote on April 28, \u201cbut they certainly are not acting that way, and that is shaping up to be a challenge for his administration. \u201d Bloomberg added to the chorus of outlets that expressed pessimism about the economy under President Trump\u2019s first 100 days. \u201cThe U. S. economy is in better shape than Friday\u2019s   figures will probably indicate,\u201d Sho Chandra and Patricia Laya wrote, \u201cbut getting the growth that President Donald Trump wants is becoming even more difficult. \u201d But the media was singing a different tune during President Obama\u2019s first 100 days. Despite the slow growth that occurred at the outset of 2009, the outlets that linked President Trump to poor GDP performance failed to hold President Obama to the same standard. \u201cThe Commerce Department reported last week that Gross Domestic Product only grew 0. 7 percent during the first quarter of 2017, following a gain of 2. 1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016,\u201d the New York Times reported in 2009. The only mention of President Obama in the article was a reference to Paul Volcker that identified him as an adviser to the president. In early 2009, Associated Press reporter Liz Sidoti, and likely in response to concerns over less than desirable economic performance, heaped lavish but meaningless praise on President Obama. \u201cIt didn\u2019t take long for Barack Obama  \u2014   for all his youth and inexperience  \u2014   to get acclimated to his new role as the calming leader of a country in crisis,\u201d she wrote. \u201cRookie jitters? Far from it. \u201d He spoke in \u201cfirm, yet soothing tones. \u201d He used a \u201c  approach. \u201d He \u201cdisplayed wonkish tendencies, too,\u201d and \u201cengaged in witty batter,\u201d and on foreign policy, he \u201cstruck a statesmanlike stance. \u201d On April 29, 2009, The Washington Post, without mention of the slow GDP growth, said Obama had \u201cmoved quickly to strengthen the U. S. economy, refine the American strategy in two foreign wars and reverse   detention and interrogation policies that have drawn condemnation at home and abroad. \u201d An extensive blog prepared by The New York Times that covered President Obama\u2019s first 100 days in office failed to mention GDP growth even once. The blog, which was written by five presidential biographers, covers a wide range of topics including foreign policy, the economy, and the president\u2019s interactions with congress. Investor\u2019s Business Daily was unable to \u201cfind mainstream media critiques of Obama\u2019s policies early in 2009,\u201d claiming that \u201cthere were virtually none. \u201d Although the economy was contracting in the early months of Obama\u2019s presidency,  \u201cno one blamed him for that. Instead, there was lavish praise, even as he stumbled from error to error. They blamed Bush. \u201d If anything, \u201clavish praise\u201d  may be an understatement. On February 20, 2009, ABC Nightline   Terry Moran argued that \u201cin some ways, Barack Obama is the first President since George Washington to be taking a step down into the Oval office. \u201d Katie Couric came out in full support of Barack Obama\u2019s early stimulus package proposal, citing a survey that claimed that slightly more than half of Americans supported the proposal. Couric used this survey to ask   Leader John Boehner why congressional Republicans wouldn\u2019t support the policy. \u201cA recent CBS News poll shows that 53 percent of the American people fully backs the stimulus package, 63 percent of people we polled thought the Republican opposition to the stimulus package was for political reasons. So, are you out of touch with the American people?  \u2026    Do you think the Republicans are digging themselves in a hole by not being more supportive of the President\u2019s proposals?\u201d Couric asked. The policies enacted in President Obama\u2019s first 100 days cost a whopping 141 times what President Trump\u2019s first new policies have cost. According to an analysis from the American Action Forum, President Trump\u2019s new regulations have cost a mere $28 million in comparison the $4 billion enacted by President Obama in the same period.
