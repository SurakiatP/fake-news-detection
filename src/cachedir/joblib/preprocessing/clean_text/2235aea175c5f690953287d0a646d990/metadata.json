It\u2019s the people who draw the red line. What importance does your line have. We draw another red line on top of yours,\u201d Yildirim told members of his ruling AK Party in a parliament speech. \\nImplying that its only the people of Turkey who can hold the government \u201caccountable\u201d for its actions, Yildirim said Ankara would not be intimidated by EU\u2019s \u201cthreats\u201d. \\nCrowds gathered by the Cumhuriyet offices during the night, to express their support for the media, Reuters reported. According to Turkey\u2019s journalists\u2019 association, 170 media outlets have been shut down following the attempted coup. \\n\u201cWe are not going to learn from you what press freedom is. We support it all the way,\u201d Reuters quoted Yildirim as saying. \\nThe new wave of arrests and investigations of the Cumhuriyet staff come under accusations that the media \u2013 which has been critical of President Tayyip Erdogan, had assisted a failed military coup in July. Alleging that the journalists played their part in the coup by publishing \u201csubliminal messages\u201d in their columns, according to Turkish Anadolu agency, prosecutors accused them of supporting Kurdish militants and US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen. The latter is blamed by the government for orchestrating the coup. \\n\u201c[Our European friends] always bring up press freedom when we take steps in our fight against terrorism,\u201d the prime minister said, adding that Turkey has \u201cno problem with press freedom.\u201d \\n[embedded content] '"}, "time": 1742564487.7199683}
