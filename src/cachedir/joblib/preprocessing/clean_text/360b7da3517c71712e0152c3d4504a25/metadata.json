[As Breitbart News reported, \u201cThe U. S. Secret Service will reportedly open an investigation into Madonna after the singer told demonstrators at the Women\u2019s March on Washington Saturday that she has often thought of \u2018blowing up the White House. \u2019\u201d  Byrne told host Marlow, \u201cWhen she says that the White House should be blown up, do I think that Madonna\u2019s going to do it? Not necessarily. But it\u2019s about this: meaning, motive, opportunity, and intent. \u201d Byrne\u2019s larger point was that the issue has more to do with Madonna\u2019s influence and the potential for her remarks to motivate others, as opposed to her taking any action herself. The Secret Service knows, added Byrne, \u201cfrom years and years of experience that people with issues can be motivated by hate and anger speech. \u201d Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.
