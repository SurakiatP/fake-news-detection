Four top Democrats sent Comey and Attorney General Loretta Lynch a letter demanding details on the emails that the FBI is investigating by Monday. In the letter, Sens. Carper, Leahy, Feinstein, and Cardin wrote: \\nSenate Democrats aren\u2019t fooling around. They want answers, and they want them right now. As more details become known, FBI Director Comey\u2019s motives have come under criticism. Comey was advised by Attorney General Lynch not to send his letter until after the election, but he sent it anyway. \\nComey worried to FBI employees that his letter would be misunderstood, but he could have easily avoided any misunderstanding by either being specific in his letter or not sending the letter at all. It is becoming difficult to look at Comey\u2019s actions in an objective manner and not see partisan political motivations. \\nThe FBI Director has interfered in a presidential election with new emails that have nothing to do with the Democratic nominee, but can be used by her opponents for political purposes. \\nDemocrats are demanding answers, and if James Comey doesn\u2019t answer their questions by Monday, he will be forced to under oath if the Democratic Party wins a majority of seats in the Senate. \\nEither way, Comey\u2019s October surprise has blown up in his own face.'"}, "time": 1742562240.059795}
