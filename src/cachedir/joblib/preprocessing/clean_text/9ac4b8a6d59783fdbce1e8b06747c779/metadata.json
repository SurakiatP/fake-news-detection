Members of the State Duma passed the controversial amendment to the Russian criminal code in its second reading, which essentially assures it will go to President Vladimir V. Putin for his signature. The amendment treats a first conviction for domestic battery as an administrative offense, carrying a penalty of a $500 fine or 15 days in jail. If Mr. Putin signs the measure into law, only injuries like concussions or broken bones, or repeated offenses committed in a family setting, would lead to criminal charges. Defenders of the measure say it will protect parents\u2019 rights to discipline their children and generally reduce the state\u2019s role in domestic life. \u201cIn the traditional Russian family culture, relations between \u2018fathers and sons\u2019 are built upon the authority of parents\u2019 power, mutual love and personal indispensability as the basis for children\u2019s upbringing,\u201d said Yelena B. Mizulina, one of the initiators of the new legislation and author of a law that banned \u201cgay propaganda\u201d aimed at minors. Opponents called it a step back to medieval times and a license for violent behavior by domestic tyrants. \u201cIt is clear that lawmakers recognized violence as a norm of family life,\u201d said Svetlana G. Aivazova, a Russian specialist in gender studies. \u201cThis shows that Duma deputies are not simply conservative or traditional, it shows that they are archaic. \u201d Ms. Aivazova and other experts say that Russia has a serious problem with domestic violence. Citing data provided by Russia\u2019s Interior Ministry, Ms. Aivazova told Mr. Putin in 2015 that \u201c40 percent of all grave violent crimes are committed in families. \u201d In 2013, she said, more than 9, 000 women died in criminal assaults and more than 11, 000 were badly injured. In 2014, she said, \u201cmore than 25 percent of all murders were committed in families. \u201d In the United States, by comparison, 11, 766 women were killed by a husband or boyfriend in the years 2001 to 2012, an average of about 1, 000 a year in a country with about twice the population of Russia. Ms. Aivazova asked Mr. Putin to support a special law on the prevention of domestic violence that had already been passed in 143 countries, including Russia\u2019s   neighbors Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. Mr. Putin thanked her, but the law remained in the State Duma, and Ms. Aivazova said she was not optimistic about its prospects. In the past, Mr. Putin has expressed concern about domestic violence, even in the absence of serious injury. \u201cI think we should not slap children and justify it based on some old traditions,\u201d he told journalists at his last news conference in December. \u201cThere is a short distance from slaps to beating. \u201d The new legislation was pushed by conservative members of the Russian parliament and the Russian Orthodox Church, who were incensed last summer when lawmakers criminalized domestic violence, acting upon a recommendation by the Supreme Court. The Russian Orthodox Church, which has steadily increased its influence in social policy in recent years, said in a statement last year that physical punishment was a Russian tradition and thus should be protected as \u201can essential right given to parents by God. \u201d \u201cThere is absolutely no doubt that children should be defended against true criminal activities,\u201d the church said. \u201cBut you cannot equate such criminal assaults with rational and moderate use of physical punishment by loving parents. \u201d Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the State Duma, said the new legislation was a sign of the state\u2019s determination to \u201cmake conditions for strong families to emerge. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628298.3598325}
