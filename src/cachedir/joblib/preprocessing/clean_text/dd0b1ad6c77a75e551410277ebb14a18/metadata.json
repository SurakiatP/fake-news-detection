It hasn\u2019t been easy. Ever since health officials in July announced four cases of Zika transmission by local mosquitoes detected in a   neighborhood, Mrs. Paradiz and her husband, Alex, have largely secluded themselves in their Broward County home. They canceled a vacation, and stopped taking evening strolls around the lake and swimming in the neighborhood pool. To walk the dog, Mrs. Paradiz, 35, throws on long pants and a hoodie, even though it\u2019s 90 degrees outside. She\u2019s debating quitting her job as a sales rep, to avoid coming into contact with a mosquito that might carry the Zika virus, which can lead to devastating birth defects, including an abnormally small head, called microcephaly. \u201cAll it takes is one mosquito bite to change the entire course of our lives,\u201d Mrs. Paradiz said. In the past three weeks, the number of confirmed Zika infections in the greater Miami area has increased to 36, including 25 linked to the    neighborhood of Wynwood considered the Zika zone, as well as isolated cases outside   County in Broward and Palm Beach counties. Since Thursday, the number has included a small cluster in Miami Beach, suggesting that there is at least one other location where mosquitoes may be transmitting the virus locally. Federal health officials now are advising pregnant women to avoid traveling to the   County area. Public health officials have emphasized they do not expect the virus to spread here as it has in other countries because many homes have screened windows and   which keeps mosquitoes at bay. But pregnant women still are worried. Some expectant mothers are choosing confinement indoors to avoid mosquitoes. Women who wouldn\u2019t dream of drinking coffee while pregnant now are coating exposed limbs in bug spray, a tactic recommended by health officials. Some women even are considering temporary moves, leaving their homes, families and doctors to stay with relatives or friends far away from a Zika zone until they give birth. \u201cPatients are very anxious, and they bring up the subject of Zika with me before I even get a chance,\u201d said Dr. Elizabeth   an   who is a past president of the Dade County Medical Association. \u201cBefore, this was an ocean away. Now it\u2019s in their backyard. \u201d While the Zika epidemic has been sweeping across Latin and South America and the Caribbean since last year, in the United States it is still relatively new. So far, some 2, 260 infections have been confirmed, including 529 pregnant women, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But those cases involved people who are believed to have been infected while traveling, as well as 22 who contracted it by having sex with an infected person. Now that the virus has been transmitted through local mosquitoes, pregnant women say they feel vulnerable and frightened, and wonder how they can keep mosquitoes at bay during an entire pregnancy while living in a state that is swarming with the insects. At a regional meeting of obstetricians and gynecologists in Orlando last week, Zika was the main topic of conversation, said Dr. Karen Harris, an   in Gainesville who heads the Florida arm of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. \u201cIt\u2019s hard on the patients, but it\u2019s also hard on the staff, because we don\u2019t have anything to offer but prevention,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t answer their questions. If you get Zika a month before you\u2019re due, does that affect the baby? We don\u2019t know. There\u2019s total uncertainty. \u201d The    Aedes aegypti mosquito, which carries the Zika virus, doesn\u2019t normally fly more than about 500 feet in its lifetime. Health officials assume that   mosquitoes picked up the infection from someone who had just returned from Latin America or the Caribbean with the virus in his or her blood. The latest guidelines direct obstetricians to assess every pregnant patient for exposure to Zika at each prenatal visit, and counsel them to use condoms and insect repellent to lower their risk for exposure. Dr. Aaron Elkin, a Broward County   who treats a diverse group of patients from Miami and surrounding areas, keeps a basket of free condoms on the counter in the reception area, along with containers of Off bug spray. Dr. Elkin, a past president of the Broward County Medical Association, spent every visit last week discussing Zika precautions, assuring women that bug spray would not harm the fetus, taking blood and urine samples for tests and doing ultrasounds. \u201cEvery pregnant woman who comes in for prenatal care wants Zika testing,\u201d Dr. Elkin said. \u201cYou can\u2019t say no to them. They\u2019re very frightened. I\u2019m doing 15 tests a day. \u201d One patient, Idit Zalouf, a    who lives in Sunny Isles Beach just north of Miami Beach, is five months pregnant. She showed Dr. Elkin a bracelet she bought that she thinks will protect her from mosquitoes. Dr. Elkin advised her to use insect repellent with DEET. \u201cDo you think it would be good for me to go to New York for a while?\u201d she asked him. \u201cIf a pregnant woman gets the Zika, what does she do?\u201d Dr. Elkin tried reassuring her that preventing mosquito bites and other forms of Zika transmission should be her focus, and that it would be difficult to manage her care from afar. Later Ms. Zalouf said she may move anyway. \u201cI think it\u2019s better to be away from here,\u201d said Ms. Zalouf. \u201cI\u2019m stressed about it. It\u2019s very frightening. \u201c Another patient, Unique Robinson, a    licensed practical nurse who is not working now and lives in Broward County, said she is terrified. She rarely ventures outside her home, except to go to the mall or the movies. \u201cI\u2019ve looked it up and seen the babies, how they come out. I don\u2019t think I could handle that,\u201d she said, her voice breaking. She often goes online to look up information. \u201cThe internet makes it worse. \u201d Some patients are worried about Zika, but find it difficult to take precautions. Malorie Fitzgerald, a      secretary who is 33 weeks pregnant with her third child, has separated from the father and has been living in a homeless shelter in an area of Miami adjacent to Wynwood. While most patients came to the office wearing long pants and long sleeves, Mrs. Fitzgerald, who caught a bus, was wearing an   dress with a halter top. At the shelter she shares a room with 25 people, and they are lax about leaving doors open. She hangs blankets around her bunk bed to keep flies and mosquitoes out, to no avail. \u201cI get bit a couple of times a day,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little less since the doctor gave me a can of Off. But the mosquitoes and flies are horrible there. \u201d Dr. Elkin runs an ultrasound, and reassures Ms. Fitzgerald that the measurements are normal. It\u2019s not a perfect guarantee, however. Infections can occur at later stages of pregnancy, and the scan won\u2019t pick up more subtle abnormalities caused by Zika that are not visible, like stiff joints and eye damage. \u201cThat is the head of the baby, see? It\u2019s completely normal,\u201d Dr. Elkin said. Ms. Fitzgerald smiled with relief. But he repeated his advice about prevention. \u201cWear long clothes and use the Off!\u201d But even the most vigilant efforts to prevent mosquito bites are not always successful. Lori Tabachnikoff, 36, who is 24 weeks pregnant with her first child and lives in South Miami, said she was fortunate because her employer, the Greater Miami Jewish Federation, located just outside Wynwood, has allowed her to work from home to minimize her time outdoors. Even so, mosquitoes sneak in. She recently let a plumber into her home and was soon bitten by a mosquito that must have slipped in at the same time. She has been bitten five times so far this summer, and she and her husband recently went to the health department at 4 a. m. to get in line to be tested. There were already four couples ahead of them. They are waiting for the results.'"}, "time": 1742628575.6494884}
