Tel Aviv has defied calls to stop the settlement expansion in the occupied Palestinian territories. \\nGuaranteeing enmity with Tehran \\nSome 150 people, including extremist Israelis and evangelical Christians, took part in the Trump rally in on Wednesday. \\nFriedman echoed previous remarks by Trump, saying the real estate mogul would recognize East Jerusalem al-Quds as the capital of Israel if he wins the White House in the US 2016 presidential election. \\nA short video message by Trump was also played at the event, in which he said, \u201cTogether we will stand up to the enemies like Iran, bent on destroying Israel and her people. Together we will make America and Israel safe again.\u201d \\nAccording to leaked emails from March 2015 by former US secretary of state Colin Powell, the regime has pointed 200 nuclear weapons at the Iranian capital.
