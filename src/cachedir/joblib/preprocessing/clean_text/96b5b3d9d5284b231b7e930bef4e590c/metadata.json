[Jackie\u2019s back this week with a brand new exclusive clip for Breitbart News, and a warning: \u201cIf I were you, I wouldn\u2019t go into any Russian restaurant. Because for all I know, the blintzes could be bugged. \u201d  \u201cDo you hear all the conversation about the Russians? Somebody would think that the Russians left Russia and that they\u2019re all living in Pittsburgh now because no matter where you go, that\u2019s all you hear, about what the Russians did to us. \u201d Of course Trump, Jackie drolly explains, would never have won the election without Russia\u2019s help. As for Trump accusing former President Obama of wiretapping his office at Trump Tower  \u2014   Jackie finds it laughable that Democrats have now suddenly begun demanding proof for the allegations. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest about it. Do the Democrats need proof about any claims that they make?\u201d he asks. \u201cEvery accusation they make is just invented out of nothing, out of nowhere. They\u2019re claiming that Trump is involved with the Russians, the Russians influenced the whole election. \u2018What proof do you have?\u2019 We don\u2019t need proof, we just announce it. \u201d Nevertheless, Jackie offers up his own proof for how Democrats could make the Russian accusations. Watch the full clip above, and the rest of Jackie Mason\u2019s weekly exclusive clips for Breitbart News here.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum,  '"}, "time": 1742563939.756407}
