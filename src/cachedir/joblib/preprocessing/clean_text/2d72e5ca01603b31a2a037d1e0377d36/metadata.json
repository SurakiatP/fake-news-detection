Share on Twitter Print This Post \\nGabriel Sherman writes at New York Mag that when Donald Trump attacked the Khan family over Khizr Khan\u2019s speech at the Democratic National Convention, he had no idea what a Gold Star family was. \\nYou will remember that Khizr Khan stood up in front of the entire world and said to Donald Trump, \u201cLet me ask you, \u2018Have you even read the United States Consitution?\u2019 I will gladly lend you my copy. In this document, look for the words \u2018liberty\u2019 and \u2018equal protection of the law.\u2019\u201d \\nThe fallout was predictable. Donald Trump, openly criticized, lost it. He attacked the Khan\u2019s religious beliefs, saying \u201cIf you look at his wife, she was standing there. She had nothing to say. She probably, maybe she wasn\u2019t allowed to have anything to say.\u201d \\nNow it turns out that he had no idea what he was doing. Because he is ignorant, and because, as Mark Cuban has observed, he isn\u2019t interested in learning anything. Gabriel Sherman explains: \\n\u201cYou do know you just attacked a Gold Star family?\u201d one adviser warned Trump. Trump didn\u2019t know what a Gold Star family was: \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he asked. To Trump, Khizr Khan and his wife, Ghazala, were enemies who had said something mean about him, just like Rosie O\u2019Donnell and any number of people who had gotten under his skin over the years. Wasn\u2019t it his right to respond? \u201c\\u2005\u2018The election is about the American people, it\u2019s not about you,\u2019\\u2005\u201d Manafort told Trump, according to a person briefed on the conversation. Trump countered with Breitbart\u2019s report on Khan\u2019s purported belief in Sharia. \u201c\\u2005\u2018He\u2019s not running for president,\u2019\\u2005\u201d Manafort shot back. \u201c\\u2005\u2018The Clintons did this to us to waste our time getting off message.\u2019\\u2005\u201d \\nOf course, Trump could not and would not admit his own ignorance and he certainly wasn\u2019t prepared to take the blame. Instead, as Sherman reveals, he \u201ctook it out on Manafort in front of his senior advisors, including Ailes.\u201d According to Trump, Manafort wasn\u2019t \u201cable to get the media to focus on the right stuff.\u201d \\nNo wonder, when Trump refuses to take Manafort\u2019s advice and focus on the right stuff. This is not to defend Manafort, who is at least as despicable as his boss, but it serves as an example of how Trump\u2019s first reaction each and every time is to get back at his critic. \\nIt was one of Donald Trump\u2019s most visible Joe McCarthy moments, and his response to Khizr Khan actually reinforced the point Khan was trying to make. \\nStopping and thinking are foreign to him. And if you are not astonished by the appalling ignorance on display here, you should not be. This is all in keeping with a party that prides itself on ignorance rather than facts.'"}, "time": 1742563713.3418283}
