But when Rudy began trying to filibuster, Cuomo interrupted him and said he while he might not agree with the decision the FBI made to not charge Clinton with any wrongdoing when it came to her email server, Giuliani wasn\u2019t entitled to make things up: \\nNext, Giuliani began ranting about some \u201cbribe\u201d that predated the email controversy, and that was when Cuomo shut him down with one line : \u201cMy entire life because you\u2019re so accurate and all of a sudden, you\u2019re in Trumpland and the facts are all over the place.\u201d \\nAs if he hadn\u2019t been embarrassed enough, Giuliani then attempted to start talking about the recent announcement that Obamacare premiums will rise by as much as 25 percent in 2017: \u201cAs a result, because the Democrats forced this down the Republicans\u2019 throat, the ACA, they decided to punish them. And they won\u2019t work with the Democrats to fix any of the problems that they could fix.\u201d \\nCuomo was ready for that line, too, and again lit into his guest : \u201cOh, that\u2019s a bunch of nonsense. They created it themselves. They cut out bipartisan support.\u201d \\nWhen it was over with, you could tell by the look on Rudy\u2019s face that he knew he had just been bested. Maybe Trump should rethink letting the unhinged Giuliani be one of his main surrogates. He really stinks at it. \\nHere\u2019s both parts of the interview: \\nFeatured Image Via YouTube Screengrab About Andrew Bradford \\nAndrew Bradford is a single father who lives in Atlanta.
