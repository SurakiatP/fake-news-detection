Thursday at the National Prayer Breakfast, President Donald Trump opened his remarks with a joke about the ratings of NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d with Arnold Schwarzenegger as the host.  \u201cWhen I ran for president, I had to leave the show,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat\u2019s when for sure I knew I was doing it. And they hired a big movie star, Arnold Schwarzenegger to take my place. And we know how that turned out. The ratings went right down the tubes. It\u2019s been a total disaster.
