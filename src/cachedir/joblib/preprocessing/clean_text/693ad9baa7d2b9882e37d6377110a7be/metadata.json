Additionally, Ms. Davidson recommended that novice skiers sign up for a few lessons to learn how to ski safely  \u2014   these can run $50 an hour for group lessons and $100 or more for private sessions. FACTOR IN TERRAIN AND CROWDS For beginners, Ms. Davidson said, a successful ski getaway means picking a resort with manageable terrain and minimal crowds, because packed slopes can be daunting for newcomers. Aspen, Colo. for example, isn\u2019t the ideal destination for inexperienced skiers because Aspen Mountain is full of challenging terrain. And although an area like Mammoth Mountain in California has plenty of beginner terrain, it is usually crowded, whereas June Mountain, about 30 minutes away, sees fewer skiers but also has gentle terrain. Ms. Davidson said new skiers could also buy an   ski trip from a reliable ski operator such as Ski. com these trips take factors into consideration that are relevant to novices. CONSIDER YOUR GROUP When choosing a ski destination, the needs of your fellow travelers matter. If children are in tow, for example, you will probably want a resort with a day care or a ski school for children. Also, if you\u2019re with young children or older travelers, it\u2019s smart to pick a resort where the walk from the resort to the ski area is no more than five minutes. \u201cKids and older skiers may find it challenging to carry bulky and heavy ski equipment too far,\u201d Ms. Davidson said. PLAN ALTERNATIVE ACTIVITIES You may plan your ski vacation months in advance, but you won\u2019t know what the conditions at your destination will be until just before your trip. \u201cSome areas like Whistler in Canada can go from great snow one day to rain the next, which means that skiing is out,\u201d Ms. Davidson said. To avoid disappointment, have nonskiing activities planned as backups such as snowmobiling, dog sledding and ice skating. Also, some popular destinations have a vibrant cultural scene such as Beaver Creek, Colo. which is home to the Vilar Performing Arts Center, which hosts   plays and music performances.
