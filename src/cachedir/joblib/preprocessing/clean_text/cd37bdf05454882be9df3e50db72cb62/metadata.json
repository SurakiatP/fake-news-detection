[Sources close to the network told the New York\u2019s Post\u2018s Page Six that Kelly  \u2014   who announced she would join NBC this month after more than a decade at Fox  \u2014   is expected to take over either the 9 a. m. Today hour, currently hosted by Tamron Hall and Al Roker, or else the 10 a. m. hour, currently hosted by Hoda Kotb and Kathie Lee Gifford.  An insider told the paper that staffers at the network are upset that NBC would make significant changes to its Today lineup, given the show\u2019s strong ratings over the last several months. Today producers were reportedly informed of the changes Friday morning, one day after Al Roker tweeted a celebratory message about the show\u2019s ratings. \u201cPeople are pissed. The third hour was beating every syndicated show across the board,\u201d the insider told Page Six. \u201cThey were in over their head and bit off more than they can chew when they hired Megyn. \u201d Another insider told the paper that \u201ceveryone has been left in the dark\u201d regarding the changes. Page Six also reported that Hall is expected to leave NBC next month when her contract expires. Kelly turned down a reported $100 million,   offer to remain at Fox News to jump to NBC, where she is set to headline both a daytime news show and a Sunday night \u201c \u201d newsmagazine show. In the absence of The Kelly File, Fox News moved Tucker Carlson into Kelly\u2019s old 9 p. m. primetime slot and gave Martha McCallum the 7 p. m. slot with a new show, The First 100 Days. In its first two weeks, Tucker Carlson Tonight has averaged nearly double the ratings for The Kelly File over the same time period last year in the     demographic.
