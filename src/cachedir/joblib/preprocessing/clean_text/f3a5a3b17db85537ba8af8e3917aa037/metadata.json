Ms. Kian, 23, is not the first person to add such a clause to a quest for a roommate. A steady trickle of posts like hers have shown up, one or two at a time, on Craigslist since President Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20. As anyone who has started out in the Washington area with few contacts and an   salary knows, finding a roommate (or three) to share a high rent is common practice. The median cost for a   apartment is around $1, 990 a month, according to Zumper, a rental aggregator. But for some, it\u2019s becoming more important to make sure that political views align before they split the cost with a stranger. On Twitter, Reddit and Craigslist and in Facebook groups, people have been screening for Trump supporters since at least last fall. Such ads, more than a dozen of which have been posted on Craigslist since Inauguration Day, are only a tiny fraction of the thousands of posts on the site, but they nonetheless represent a small act of defiance in an area that heavily favored Hillary Clinton and where residents have remained politically active since the election. \u201cI can\u2019t live with someone who supports a \u2018leader\u2019 with those types of ideals,\u201d Jessica, 32, a teacher who did not want her last name used because she feared harassment online, wrote in an email. She posted an ad on Craiglist for a room share shortly after the inauguration. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m going to a protest every single day. \u201d In one recent ad, a couple in the area who identified themselves as \u201c \u201d and liberal advertised a $500 room in their home: \u201cIf you\u2019re racist, sexist, homophobic or a Trump supporter please don\u2019t respond. We won\u2019t get along. \u201d In another, two women in their 20s were searching for a roommate to take over a   room in their Columbia Heights apartment for $550. The women detailed their love of happy hours, a \u201cgood Netflix sesh,\u201d pho and tacos. \u201cWe\u2019re open to any    \u201d they added, \u201cso long as you didn\u2019t vote for Trump. In the same neighborhood, a woman posted an ad searching for someone to take over her room: \u201cTrump supporters this is not the house for you (no, seriously),\u201d she wrote. For her part, Ms. Kian, who works at Amideast, a nonprofit that focuses on educational opportunities for Middle Eastern and African students, is fine with taking the extra step to make sure her political filter extends to her home. Ms. Kian, who has American and Iranian citizenship and was raised Muslim, said the idea of the   clause started out as a joke. But it grew serious, she said, after the president signed an executive order that barred people from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States. \u201cAnybody who is on board with that kind of thinking is not welcome,\u201d she said. Whoever ends up living with her will pay $1, 300 to share the top floor of the house. (Her parents live downstairs.) People who support Mr. Trump, she said, would not be interested in living in her \u201craging liberal\u201d house. \u201cFrankly, it would not work out,\u201d Ms. Kian said in an interview. \u201cThat person would not be comfortable here because we bash Trump nightly. \u201d People like Ms. Kian may be closing themselves off to others, but their actions are legal, according to Sheila C. Salmon, a Washington lawyer who specializes in housing law. Political views are not protected under the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination based on such factors as race, religion, national origin and disability. \u201cI don\u2019t see anything illegal about it,\u201d Ms. Salmon said. \u201cIt\u2019s like saying you don\u2019t want any nonsmokers. \u201d Washington has a set of expanded protections that include political affiliation, but Ms. Salmon said it was unclear whether a person\u2019s support of Mr. Trump would fall into this category. \u201cWould it truly be rejection or discrimination on political affiliation?\u201d she said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a reasonable argument to be made that it\u2019s not. \u201d Kevin Kemp, 29, who works in advertising at Education Week, is another resident who is screening out Trump supporters. Mr. Kemp said he used to subtly gauge the politics of potential roommates by making jokes and seeing how they responded. But about a month ago, when he was searching for a roommate to share a   apartment in Silver Spring, Md. he found himself going a step further as he drafted a post on Reddit. \u201cPlease no Imperial Sympathizers, Borg, Vogons, Lannisters (some exceptions) Sith or Trump supporters,\u201d he wrote in a post for a roommate, invoking some of fiction\u2019s most notorious villains. His joke, he said, reflected a deeper frustration. \u201cAs a black man, Black Lives Matter is sort of important to me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Trump supporters aren\u2019t known for their fondness of that movement. \u201d On the other end of the spectrum, people who identify as conservative and support Mr. Trump are navigating difficult terrain. Cole Lyle, a Marine veteran who recently moved here to lobby for funding to provide wounded veterans with service dogs, is using Craigslist and    among his friends to find roommates. He said he was open to living with anyone, but added that the pool of potential roommates who share his political beliefs was small. \u201cD. C. is a small town,\u201d Mr. Lyle said. \u201cRepublican D. C. is a smaller town, and conservative Republican D. C. is tiny. \u201d Mr. Lyle, 27, a former intern with the conservative Heritage Foundation, is for the moment staying in the think tank\u2019s intern residence. He said that he hoped that he and his service dog, Kaya, would eventually live in a place where he could find common ground with someone  \u2014   \u201cdogs are the key to bipartisanship\u201d  \u2014   but that he did not want to live with anyone who would reject him because of his political views. \u201cIf somebody\u2019s going to put that in an ad, they\u2019re not the type of person I\u2019d want to associate with,\u201d he said. \u201cIf someone said, \u2018I will not live with a liberal,\u2019 I would probably be equally as likely not to engage with that person. \u201d But Ms. Kian, who has lived in Washington only since the Obama era, said she was likely to keep screening out Trump supporters. \u201cI\u2019m not quite sure what this city is going to look like,\u201d Ms. Kian said. \u201cThat\u2019s even more reason for me to keep that   supporters clause in there. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563259.8663013}
