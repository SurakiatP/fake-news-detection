Trump\u2019s economic policies, Hillary Clinton on Thursday accused him of feigning a connection to the working man, while advocating policies that would \u201cwork for him and his friends, at the expense of everyone else. \u201d Seeking to chip away at the perception among   white voters that Mr. Trump is the economic populist in the race, Mrs. Clinton said the Republican nominee merely paid \u201clip service\u201d to being on the side of average Americans. She repeatedly contrasted his personal wealth with her own   upbringing. \u201cThere is a myth out there that he\u2019ll stick it to the rich and powerful because, somehow, at heart, he\u2019s really on the side of the little guy,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cDon\u2019t believe it. \u201d Mrs. Clinton referred to the tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations that Mr. Trump presented in a speech in Detroit on Monday, saying he \u201cwants to give trillions in tax breaks to people like himself,\u201d which would lead to broad cuts in spending on education, health care and environmental protection. Although she has attacked Mr. Trump\u2019s business record for months, her address on Thursday presented the first opportunity for Mrs. Clinton to deliver a detailed    rebuttal to the economic proposals Mr. Trump unveiled this week. The nearly    addresses on the economy put into sharp relief the candidates\u2019 contrasting positions on an issue that has preoccupied voters throughout the lengthy presidential contest, with Mr. Trump seizing on economic dislocation in mixing populist   positions with traditionally Republican tax cutting, and Mrs. Clinton seeing a strong government hand in creating jobs and driving up wages. Mrs. Clinton called for making the biggest infrastructure investment  \u2014   $275 billion  \u2014   since World War II, and urged aggressive spending on green energy to counter China and Germany. And she repeated her plans to make public colleges and universities   for     families. And she sharply criticized important elements of Mr. Trump\u2019s tax cut plans, particularly the elimination of the estate tax and his plan to cut the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent she said his plan for business owners included what she called the \u201cTrump loophole,\u201d which would \u201callow him to pay less than half the current tax rate on income from many of his own companies. \u201d She characterized her opponent\u2019s economic doctrine as a \u201cmore extreme version of the failed theory of   economics\u201d mixed with his own \u201coutlandish Trumpian ideas that even Republicans reject. \u201d And she rejected Mr. Trump\u2019s promises to ease financial regulation and do away with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which he calls detrimental to average Americans. \u201cEven conservative experts say Trump\u2019s agenda will pull our economy back into recession,\u201d and cause the loss of 3. 4 million jobs, Mrs. Clinton said, pointing to an analysis for Moody\u2019s Analytics led by Mark Zandi, who advised Senator John McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s remarks often transcended policy, as she sought to portray Mr. Trump as an    businessman who would squash the working class. She talked about her grandfather\u2019s years of labor in a lace mill in Scranton, Pa. and her father\u2019s small   business in Chicago. \u201cThis is personal for me,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cI am the product of the American middle class. \u201d But for all of her efforts, Mr. Trump remains a difficult opponent to critique in traditional ideological terms. Although some of his policies align with those of congressional Republicans, others, like his promise to rip up global trade agreements, break with Republican orthodoxy. And unlike Mitt Romney, whom President Obama effectively portrayed as a cold corporate titan in the 2012 race, Mr. Trump enjoys some of his strongest support among   white voters who believe he cares about people like them. The issue of trade particularly hurt Mrs. Clinton in the primary in Michigan, which is heavily reliant on manufacturing jobs. She narrowly lost the state to Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who, like Mr. Trump, sharply criticized Mrs. Clinton for her previous support for the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta, which her husband signed into law, and the   Partnership, which she supported as secretary of state. Before Mrs. Clinton\u2019s speech, Mr. Trump used an address to the National Association of Home Builders in Miami Beach to assail former President Bill Clinton for signing Nafta into law, which Mr. Trump said devastated upstate New York, and he hammered Mrs. Clinton for failing to deliver on a promise she made in her 2000 Senate campaign to bring 200, 000 jobs to the state. \u201cShe passed no legislation that helped,\u201d he said. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t get out of her own way. \u201d Mrs. Clinton gave her address after touring the Futuramic Tool  Engineering factory in Warren, which made automotive parts in the past but has diversified to supply parts to the aerospace industry. Praising the company for being at the front line of a potential \u201cmanufacturing renaissance,\u201d Mrs. Clinton criticized Mr. Trump for taking a dark view of America\u2019s potential. \u201cWhen Donald Trump visited Detroit on Monday, he talked only of failure, poverty and crime,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s missing so much. \u201d Mrs. Clinton has spent over a year explaining her main economic proposals and did not propose anything new on Thursday. But she did contrast her specific promises with those Mr. Trump offered on Monday. She mocked Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to give tax breaks for child care  \u2014   the brainchild of his daughter Ivanka and intended to appeal to   mothers  \u2014   as a boon to rich families with nannies. And, in contrast to Mr. Trump\u2019s corporate tax reductions, she said she would impose an \u201cexit tax\u201d to penalize companies that move jobs overseas and offer tax incentives to companies that share profits with employees. \u201cThen there\u2019s the estate tax, which Trump wants to eliminate altogether,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you believe that he\u2019s as wealthy as he says, that alone would save the Trump family $4 billion. \u201d But on one issue that has resonated with   voters, Mrs. Clinton played defense on Thursday. Halfway through the speech, she paused. The crowd grew quiet. \u201cI\u2019m sure some of you are thinking, well, that all sounds good, but what about trade?\u201d she said. \u201cAfter all, Trump talks about it all the time. \u201d While reiterating her opposition to the   Partnership, she belittled Mr. Trump\u2019s tough talk on trade as empty, noting how he makes   products overseas. \u201cBefore he tweets about how he\u2019s really one who\u2019ll put \u2018America First\u2019 in trade, let\u2019s remember where Trump makes many of his own products,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause it is sure not America. \u201d Outside the factory setting, a scattering of   protesters held \u201cHillary for Prison\u201d signs and criticized Mrs. Clinton\u2019s connections to Wall Street. And more than 1, 000 miles away in Florida, Mr. Trump echoed that critique. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have the talent\u201d to   the economy, Mr. Trump said. \u201cIf she wanted to do it, she couldn\u2019t because her donors won\u2019t let her. \u201d Wielding a chart, Mr. Trump said the Obama administration\u2019s policies that Mrs. Clinton wants to continue have led to plummeting home ownership rates and anemic economic growth. He also suggested that Mrs. Clinton wanted to raise taxes by $1. 3 trillion and place more of that burden on the middle class  \u2014   something that she  has not proposed. \u201cMany workers are earning less money in real dollars than they were in 1970,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd then you wonder why they\u2019re angry. \u201d In her speech, Mrs. Clinton tried to address voters\u2019 anger over income inequality, but she also tried to frame her plans as the optimistic flip side of Mr. Trump\u2019s pessimistic assessment of the country\u2019s economic prospects, pointing to two Olympic gold medalists. \u201cIf Team U. S. A. was as fearful as Trump,\u201d she said, \u201cMichael Phelps and Simone Biles would be cowering in the locker room. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628503.5410588}
