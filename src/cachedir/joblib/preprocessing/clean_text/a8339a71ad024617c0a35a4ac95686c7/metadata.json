Leslie Driscoll, 55, sells hot cross buns in an English bakery in London and addresses her customers with \u201clove\u201d or \u201cdarling\u201d her husband, Peter, 54, works as a floor layer their daughter, Louise, a    with dyed blue hair, is a barista in a hip coffee shop. But last week, the Driscolls fell out. Badly. They had an argument so big they did not speak to one another for days, Ms. Driscoll said. Shortly afterward, her husband went off in a huff to see friends up north, in Derby. The source of the family drama: whether Britain should exit the European Union, a process often referred to as \u201cBrexit. \u201d With only days to go until the referendum on membership in the bloc on Thursday, polls suggest that the country is deeply split along socioeconomic and regional lines, with many older and   voters in England favoring leaving, and younger and   Britons, and a majority of those in Scotland and Northern Ireland, favoring staying. As the consequences of the choice come into focus for voters, tensions are bubbling. In the case of the Driscoll family, they are boiling over. \u201cI completely disagree with her,\u201d Louise said on a recent afternoon, looking her mother squarely in the face as they sat in a cafe. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be leaving, like, an organization that has helped us more than we could ever help ourselves if we were to go it alone. \u201d Louise is the only one in her family who wants Britain to remain. Her parents and her    grandfather want out. \u201cThis is a little island,\u201d her mother said    lighting up a cigarette and letting the ash fall on her glittery sneakers. \u201cWe should look after our own first. Charity begins at home. \u201d \u201cBut we are all people!\u201d Louise said. \u201cWe should help each other. \u201d \u201cIt don\u2019t work that way, darling,\u201d her mother replied, shaking her head. \u201cIf you\u2019re born here, you pass as English. I don\u2019t care whether you\u2019re black, white, green or blue, or purple with pink spots on  \u2014   you\u2019re English. \u201d Those born abroad, Ms. Driscoll said, \u201chave got their own governments, their own parliaments, whatever. \u201d Up and down the country, the debate is pitting husband against wife, children against parents, sisters against brothers. The divisions are unlikely to heal easily after the referendum is decided. Even the family of Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London and the most prominent face of the campaign for leaving the bloc, has not been immune to disputes: His father, Stanley sister, Rachel and brother Jo, who is a member of Parliament and who worked closely with Prime Minister David Cameron, favor remaining in the union. Boris Johnson\u2019s mother, Charlotte Johnson Wahl, wants to leave. (Rachel Johnson reportedly tried, without success, to dissuade the former mayor from backing a British exit over a soggy game of tennis.) In Islington, the neighborhood in London where members of the Driscoll family have lived for eight generations, residents are increasingly going public with their voting intentions, which is a rarity in Britain. Rows of houses on some streets have \u201cRemain\u201d posters in their windows. On a thoroughfare filled with butchers, bakeries and     tradespeople nodded their head vigorously when asked if they were planning to vote out. The clash over Britain\u2019s continued membership in Europe has touched on issues as varied as immigration, terrorism, the economy, London\u2019s housing shortage and the fate of the National Health Service. Some of these issues, like immigration, are directly related to the European Union. Others, like the shortage of affordable housing, have little to do with it. Yet those distinctions are blurring. For many, the referendum is as much a chance to register displeasure with the country\u2019s direction as it is an opportunity to reject or embrace Europe. The stance of some voters is being shaped by personal experience and anecdote. There is, for example, a widespread perception that European citizens are flocking to Britain, especially from Eastern Europe, to take advantage of its social welfare system. But Britain\u2019s welfare system is not as generous as those of many other European nations, and fewer than 7 percent of immigrants receive benefits. In Ms. Driscoll\u2019s case, she remembers her grandfather pawning and   his suit to get by. That memory was revived, she said, with the discovery a few years ago that a newly arrived Polish family in her neighborhood had received money to buy a car and move into a   house. \u201cYears ago, we never had social security or anything like that,\u201d Ms. Driscoll said. \u201cYou sold your own. \u201d Her grandmother would get her \u201cgranddad\u2019s suit out of pawn when he got paid on Friday, put it back in pawn on Monday,\u201d Ms. Driscoll said. \u201cThat\u2019s how they lived. \u201d Having different cultures and communities is \u201cfantastic,\u201d she said, \u201cbut what I don\u2019t like is the fact that, through having that, we\u2019ve now left ourselves open. I feel like a   citizen in my own country. \u201d Ms. Driscoll is proudly English (not, in her mind, British  \u2014   she crossed out the word on her passport and replaced it with \u201cEnglish\u201d). Her father fought in World War II, and her grandfather in World War I. She has lived all her life in this area of London. Louise grew up in the same area but in a more prosperous, multicultural Britain than earlier generations had experienced. In school, she was one of only two white students. Her friends are Eritrean, Nigerian and South African. Louise voted for the Green Party in last year\u2019s general election and was appalled that her mother, traditionally a Labour voter, had opted for the     U. K. Independence Party. (\u201cSorry, I know I\u2019m a bit antiquated  \u2014   can\u2019t help it, love,\u201d Ms. Driscoll replied, somewhat sheepishly, after Louise uttered an expletive.) Louise said she understood the pressures that immigration placed on schools and hospitals. But leaving the European Union worried her, she said, because it risked wrecking the economy and making it hard for young people to secure employment. It took her eight months to find work as a barista, she said. \u201cIf I wanted to work abroad, it would be a lot easier if England was in the E. U.,\u201d Louise said. Her mother suggested that Louise move to New York, possibly unaware of the paradox that this would make her an immigrant herself. Almost inevitably, the debate over immigration veered into an argument about terrorism. Britain\u2019s porous borders were letting terrorists slip through, Ms. Driscoll said, repeating a message the camp to leave the European Union has relentlessly pushed on voters. Louise asked why she wanted to shut immigrants out of England. \u201cIt ain\u2019t the nice ones I\u2019m worried about,\u201d her mother replied. \u201cIt\u2019s the nasty ones. \u201d \u201cTo have opened the floodgates, it\u2019s like saying, \u2018Come, and come and kill us,\u2019 \u201d she said, adding that members of the Irish Republican Army had at least notified the public before setting off bombs across Britain during the 1970s and 1980s. \u201cWe can get on a bus tomorrow with a bloke with a backpack, and   boom,\u201d Ms. Driscoll said. \u201cYeah? Nothing to do with what they call their beliefs. \u201d Louise rolled her eyes. In what sounded like a final plea, she said: \u201cAt the end of the day, the E. U. is going to affect my generation more than it will affect your generation. So shouldn\u2019t it be down to us to decide whether or not to stay?\u201d Her mother fell silent and was thoughtful. \u201cI am 55 years of age,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cI know  \u2014   I appreciate that in 50 years\u2019 time, you\u2019ll be here and I won\u2019t, and you\u2019ll have to put up with whatever\u2019s happened. \u201d She paused. \u201cBut I still want out,\u201d she said. \u201cSorry. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628546.428674}
