Allen West told baseball pitching great Curt Schilling, the host of Whatever It Takes, that it is important to take care of our veterans and the warriors down range in a Thursday interview. [\u201cI know that we are not taking care of our veterans,\u201d said Schilling, whose show broadcasts weekdays from 9:00 a. m. to 11:00 a. m. at Breitbart. com, with replays available at Soundcloud. . \u201cI am embarrassed that my country does not take care of its veterans. \u201d  West, a former Republican congressman from Florida, said, \u201cThat is why we need more veterans serving in the House and Senate. \u201d The former battalion commander in Iraq told Schilling if there were more veterans in Congress, they would stop programs like the $17 million program to decide which handgun should replace the Beretta 9mm. Schilling asked West, as someone who deployed overseas, how does a democracy like the United States that accepts the Law of Warfare prepare its soldiers to combat an enemy that plays by no rules? \u201cThis is what I told my soldiers before we deployed in 2003 to Iraq: \u2018The person that you are here in the United States of America in this environment, you have to leave that person here,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you get on the airplane, the person that lands over there has to be a different person,\u201d he said. \u201cThe person who lands over there in a combat theater of operations needs to understand their task and purpose,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have to understand they have to protect themselves and they have to protect the soldiers to their left and to their right \u2014  and they have to realize that they are in an environment where any man, woman, or child can potentially be the enemy. \u201d West said before going into a combat zone, at some point the soldier\u2019s training must be supplemented by the soldier\u2019s own will to fight and survive. Given that the Rules of Engagement are so restrictive and the penalties so severe, soldiers must make   decisions under an unfair duress, he said. \u201cWe cannot have our men and women   themselves because they are concerned about any type of legal ramifications. \u201d West said we need to do a better job preparing the American people for war so that they understand the enemy we are facing and what our soldiers need to do to defeat that enemy. It is sickening that Army 1st Lt. Chris Lorance was sentenced to 20 years at Fort Leavenworth for firing upon the enemy, but Army Pvt. Chelsea Manning had her sentence commuted by President Barack Obama and Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl still has not been   for deserting his post in Afghanistan, the colonel said.
