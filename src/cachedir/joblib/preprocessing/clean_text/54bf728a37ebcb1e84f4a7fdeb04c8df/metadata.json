He has done a great deal of what he said he would do, and promises to do more. (The White House is planning a new set of executive orders this week to beat the 100 day deadline.)   \u2026     But it is precisely in the legislative area that the 100 day mark is such an unrealistic measure. Congress acts on its own schedule. Truth be told, next January, on the occasion of Trump\u2019s first year in office, if he has passed either a   Obamacare repeal and replace measure or a major tax reform measure, that would be a reasonably good legislative record for a first year. This is not the New Deal or the Great Society, when there are huge   majorities in Congress and giant bills coming one after another. In today\u2019s atmosphere and party alignments, Trump will do well to get one big thing passed. So on the 100 days, call the president an executive success.
