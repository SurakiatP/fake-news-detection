She also accused the canoers of cultural appropriation because they are primarily white men and have a privileged place in society. \\nIn a radio interview for CBC Radio , which wasn\u2019t picked up by the Internet until several months later, she claimed \u201cwe have a whole set of narratives that make the canoe into a kind of morally untouchable symbol, something that seems natural, that seems ordinary, and seems to promote values that we ascribe to.\u201d \\n\u201cBut I think if you look a little further that narrative obscures or erases another narrative\u2013and that narrative is about, to be blunt, it\u2019s about theft and genocide\u201d, the professor said. \\n{snip} \\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a coincidence that it was white men of a certain age . . . Certainly the majority of wilderness canoers are people who have a very privileged place in society. They\u2019re frequently highly educated people. They\u2019re almost completely white,\u201d she said. \\nCBC Radio host Jim Brown then asked a question: \u201cShould we look at the canoe as a non-controversial symbol or should we look at it as a symbol of colonialism?\u201d \\nTo which the academic replied: \u201cAbsolutely a symbol of colonialism. It seems to me that this narrative we tell ourselves about the canoe about how canoeing makes us in touch with nature, how canoeing makes us in some way guiltless of the terrible things that the Canadian government and Canadians in general did to First Nations people.\u201d \\n{snip} \\nEither way, somebody should break the news to Canada\u2019s woke Prime Minister Justin Trudeau about this. It\u2019s 2016, after all. Thrilled to let you know we\u2019re going to need another seat in our canoe: Sophie is pregnant! #threeisthenewtwo pic.twitter.com/gm76BwAe4p'"}, "time": 1742561702.9200232}
