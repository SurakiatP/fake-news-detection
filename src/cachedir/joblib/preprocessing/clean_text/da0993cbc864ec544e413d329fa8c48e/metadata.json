Despite politicians assuming he is fuelled by rage and probably quite racist, warehouse operative Wayne Hayes explained that he enjoys playing badminton and listening to radio documentaries about the Middle Ages. Hayes said: \u201cAfter Trump and Brexit, everyone seems to want to understand me, which is flattering but I\u2019m not sure what to tell them. \u201cI\u2019ve had four Guardian journalists on the phone already this morning, and explained to them that my life is much the same as theirs if you just swap \u2018Waitrose\u2019 for \u2018Asda\u2019 and remember that because I don\u2019t live in London I have a larger home. \u201cThey wanted to know if grammar schools were somehow responsible for making me into a disenfranchised political powder keg. At that point I said I needed to get back to work because I have a job where you actually have to do stuff.\u201d Theresa May plans to visit Hayes\u2019s workplace tomorrow, to personally ask him if there\u2019s anything she can do to stop him being a frothing swamp of hate and resentment. Hayes added: \u201cI\u2019m fine to talk to her as long as I don\u2019t have to stay late to make up the lost work time. Now that would piss me off.\u201d \\nShare:'"}, "time": 1742564469.0830982}
