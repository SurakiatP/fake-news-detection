The bureau told Congress on Friday that it had uncovered new emails related to the Clinton case \u2014 one federal official said they numbered in the thousands \u2014 potentially reigniting an issue that has weighed on the presidential campaign and offering a lifeline to Donald J. Trump less than two weeks before the election. \u201c \\nHuma Abedin, Hillary\u2019s closest aide, separated from her husband Weiner recently after it was revealed he conducted an online affair with an underage girl \u2013 the latest in a long line of scandals for the former congressman. \\nThe FBI informed Congress that while analyzing Weiner\u2019s phone agents had uncovered new Hillary Clinton emails related to the investigation into whether Clinton and her aides mishandled classified information. \\nThe announcement has breathed new life into the Trump campaign \u2013 and proved the Republican nominee was eerily accurate with an old prediction. In a statement on his website immediately after the Abedin-Weiner split, Trump questioned Hillary\u2019s judgement in allowing someone like Weiner into her circle of trust: \\nDONALD J. TRUMP STATEMENT ON HILLARY CLINTON\u2019S BAD JUDGMENT \u201c Huma is making a very wise decision. I know Anthony Weiner well, and she will be far better off without him. I only worry for the country in that Hillary Clinton was careless and negligent in allowing Weiner to have such close proximity to highly classified information. Who knows what he learned and who he told? It\u2019s just another example of Hillary Clinton\u2019s bad judgment. It is possible that our country and its security have been greatly compromised by this.\u201d \u2013 Donald J. Trump \\nAnd previously, in an Aug. 3 tweet: It came out that Huma Abedin knows all about Hillary\u2019s private illegal emails. Huma\u2019s PR husband, Anthony Weiner, will tell the world.'"}, "time": 1742561679.7358508}
