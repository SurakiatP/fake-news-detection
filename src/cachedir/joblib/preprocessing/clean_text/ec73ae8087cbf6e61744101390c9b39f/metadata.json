Trump. There are the fast walkers  \u2014   like Senator Patrick J. Toomey, the endangered Republican from Pennsylvania  \u2014   who try to run briskly away from questions about the party\u2019s presumed nominee for president. Mr. Toomey  \u2014   never the most loquacious lawmaker  \u2014   has mastered the art of twisting his face into a grimace and racing away from reporters before they can ask him about Mr. Trump\u2019s latest statements about instituting a ban on Muslim immigration. Another senator in a tight   bid, Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, also tries to avoid talking about Mr. Trump, whom she supports, as she makes her way through the halls of Congress. (To be in this category, it is very useful to have Ms. Ayotte\u2019s long legs.) Then there are lawmakers best described as grumps, like Senator John McCain of Arizona, who appears decidedly downbeat about his party, and Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, who offered early support to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign but said this week, \u201cI don\u2019t know that I really have a lot to say,\u201d adding that he had tried to advise Mr. Trump and was \u201cdiscouraged by the results. \u201d Add to that list Senator Dan Coats, Republican of Indiana, who has struggled to find a single policy position he shares with Mr. Trump. Another group are doing \u201cthe McConnell,\u201d taking a cue from their majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz  \u2014   as well a number of House members  \u2014   rotely repeat that they are supporting Mr. Trump, and refuse to engage on his specific statements most days. Mr. McConnell preemptively cuts off discussion by saying things like, \u201cI\u2019m not going to be commenting on the presidential candidates today. \u201d A smaller group are the free speakers, including Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Jeff Flake of Arizona, who openly heap scorn on Mr. Trump. Mr. Flake called Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks suggesting that President Obama somehow had inside information about the Orlando massacre \u201cparticularly disgusting,\u201d and, like Mr. Graham, said he would not be voting for him. The final category is the       . \u201cAm I offended sometimes at the comments? Yes I am,\u201d said Representative Mark Walker of North Carolina. \u201cHowever, what offends me more are Hillary Clinton\u2019s actions. \u201d Then there is Speaker Paul D. Ryan. He is perhaps the most prominent critic of Mr. Trump on his proposed Muslim ban, but has nonetheless fully endorsed him. That is a category of one. Mr. Trump has created a feedback loop in which he says increasingly outrageous and at times incoherent things about national security, immigration and other issues and Republicans are forced to answer for it. On Wednesday during a rally in Atlanta, Mr. Trump addressed Republican criticism by basically telling lawmakers to shut up. \u201cDon\u2019t talk. Please, be quiet,\u201d he said. \u201cJust be quiet, to the leaders, because they have to get tougher, they have to get sharper, they have to get smarter, and we have to have our Republicans either stick together or let me just do it by myself. \u201d While it is not clear how much support Mr. Trump is actually losing  \u2014   House Republicans continue to hide behind Mr. Ryan\u2019s embrace of the live wire as proof of their party unity  \u2014   it is clear that he is not gaining support either. His top surrogates remain Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama and Representative Lee Zeldin of New York, with no sign of newcomers to the list. The toxic combination of Mr. Trump\u2019s statements and his falling poll numbers has given signs of life to the Never Trump movement, whose members cling to the hope that they can prevent Mr. Trump from becoming the nominee next month. \u201cIf Donald Trump continues to conduct himself in a way that\u2019s unbecoming of a nominee, let alone a president,\u201d said Rory Cooper, a senior adviser to the #NeverTrump PAC, \u201cthen delegates and party leaders in Cleveland should be empowered to open the convention, just as Democrats are able to do. If there is no such mechanism, then you are essentially saying there is no unacceptable line Trump can cross. \u201d However, there is a big division among   Republicans over whether a change in convention rules, which would essentially unbind delegates from the candidate, or a   option is the best way to go. Many Republicans, even those who appear in need of a box of chocolates or a bourbon to get through each day of Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks, oppose a rules changes. \u201cThat\u2019s like saying in baseball that you\u2019re a run behind and now you want to add three innings,\u201d said Mr. Coats, after conceding that the process has been a slog. Representative Robert Dold, an Illinois Republican who has long been outspoken against Mr. Trump, said the will of the voters ought to be respected, even as he openly derides Mr. Trump. \u201cWe\u2019ve been explicit,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not supporting Donald Trump. \u201d Mr. Dold, like some other Republicans, said he would likely write in a candidate\u2019s name. Representative Don Young, Republican of Alaska, who straddles the line of the free speaker and    camps, has a more novel strategy. \u201cI don\u2019t listen to him and never have,\u201d Mr. Young said. \u201cI may vote for myself. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561778.8242173}
