Four straight times, the United States men\u2019s soccer team faced Mexico in a home World Cup qualifying game here, and four straight times the Americans won by the same score  \u2014     or, as it became known to everyone on both sides, Dos a Cero. The fans chanted it. The players talked about it. The television commercials plastered it all over their advertisements. But no more. Dos a Cero was officially put to rest only 20 minutes into Friday\u2019s game when Mexico\u2019s Miguel Lay\u00fan scored with a deflected shot from outside the penalty area, and the visitors put a complete damper on the lively atmosphere at Mapfre Stadium with a late winner from the seemingly ageless Rafael M\u00e1rquez to seal a    \u2014   call it Dos a Uno?  \u2014   defeat for the Americans. It was the first home World Cup qualifier setback for the United States since a loss to Honduras in 2001  \u2014   a stretch of 32 games  \u2014   and Mexico\u2019s first win in a qualifier in the United States since 1972. The United States still has nine games left in this   final round of qualifying  \u2014   the top three teams advance to Russia in 2018  \u2014   but things are now difficult right from the start. The Americans travel to San Jose, Costa Rica, for what should be a tricky match against the host country on Tuesday. Before then, they will have a chance to review what was, as Coach Jurgen Klinsmann put it, a \u201cvery disappointing\u201d loss to their biggest rivals. After a stunted start to the game, the United States played significantly better in the second half and had openings to win, only to switch off completely on a corner kick that allowed M\u00e1rquez to flick in a header in the 89th minute. \u201cIt\u2019s soft,\u201d forward Jozy Altidore said. \u201cIt\u2019s really soft, and we have to be better than that. \u201d Klinsmann singled out defender John Brooks as having failed to pick up M\u00e1rquez, who is 37 and has been a Mexican mainstay for so long that he played in the first Dos a Cero game back in 2001. Brooks appeared to think that Altidore was going to run with M\u00e1rquez, but either way it was a critical mistake at a most inopportune time. \u201cWe\u2019ll let ourselves hurt tonight,\u201d goalkeeper Tim Howard said. \u201cThen we\u2019ve got to move on. There\u2019s a lot of games left. \u201d Howard is unlikely to take part in at least the next match. The longtime American goalkeeper injured his groin while taking a goal kick in the first half. He was replaced by Brad Guzan, who is expected to start against Costa Rica, about five minutes before halftime. Klinsmann started Friday\u2019s game in a    alignment that was designed to give the wunderkind Christian Pulisic freedom \u201cto roam,\u201d the coach said. Pulisic was active enough, but other midfielders like Michael Bradley and Jermaine Jones did not challenge the Mexican players in the way Klinsmann had hoped. So, after Mexico hit the post, the crossbar and  \u2014   on Lay\u00fan\u2019s shot  \u2014   the back of the net, the Americans went into a more classic   . That \u201ccalmed things down,\u201d Klinsmann said, and the United States pushed the ball well after halftime and tied the score at   in the 49th minute when Brooks passed to Altidore, who bulled toward the goal and laid the ball in front of Bobby Wood for a sharp finish. That sent the crowd of 24, 650 into delirium, but their glee was dulled as the United States failed to crack the Mexican defense again while M\u00e1rquez took his chance with aplomb. Dos a Cero was over. The American dominance of Mexico in Columbus was over. The magic, after 15 years, was over. \u201cWe had enough chances to put it away,\u201d Klinsmann said. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628484.1771948}
