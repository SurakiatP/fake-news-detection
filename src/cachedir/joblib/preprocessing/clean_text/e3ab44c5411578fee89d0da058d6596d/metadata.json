Even worse, Italy has been rescuing them near Libya, not even waiting until they get within spitting distance of Italy. So, where are all the women and children? @moas_eu the taxi service just outside of Libya is part of the pull factor \\n\u2014 The Champ (@audioexpression) November 5, 2016 Breitbart Minister Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re said Sunday that those \u201csaved in the Mediterranean should be sent back to Africa\u201d instead of taking them to Europe. According to a spokeswoman for the minister, this measure would serve a twofold purpose: discouraging new migrants from coming while also demolishing the organizations of human traffickers that organize the crossings. Germany\u2019s interior minister Thomas de Maiziere threatened to close Italy\u2019s border with Austria if Rome starts sending migrants north. With the migrant route through the Balkans from Greece closed, migrants are instead crossing the Mediterranean from North African countries such as Libya and arriving in Italy. De Maizi\u00e8re is not alone in his approach. \u201cThe prevention of illegal migration does not start at our internal borders,\u201d said Helmut Teichmann, director of the Germany\u2019s Federal Police. \u201cThe aim of the federal government is to stop the refugees before they reach Europe,\u201d he said. On Saturday, 2,200 more people tried to cross the Strait of Sicily in 16 different vessels, and were rescued in a series of operations coordinated by the Italian Coast Guard who later brought them to Italy. Rescuers also recovered ten bodies of migrants who drowned during the attempt. Critics were quick to remark that part of the incentive for attempting the crossing in the first place is the knowledge that migrant rescuers are providing a free \u201ctaxi service\u201d to Italy. Protesters have raised their voices in opposition to De Maizi\u00e8re\u2019s plan, claiming it was a \u201cscandal\u201d that would effectively deny potential refugees the right of asylum, but the Minister did not back down. \u201cEliminating the prospect of reaching Europe could keep them from risking their lives in a dangerous journey.\u201d In point of fact, this year has seen the deaths of a record number of migrants during the perilous trip. On Thursday, some 240 migrants drowned in two shipwrecks off the coast of Libya, bringing the year\u2019s death toll in the Mediterranean to 4,220, compared with 3,777 in the whole of 2015. The Minister suggested that once the migrants were returned to Tunisia, Egypt or other North African countries, they could submit their asylum applications which, if approved, would allow them to reach Europe safely. \\nAs of 2 November, 159,496 people had reached Italy by sea so far in 2016, according to the International Organization of Migrants (IOM).'"}, "time": 1742564133.898727}
