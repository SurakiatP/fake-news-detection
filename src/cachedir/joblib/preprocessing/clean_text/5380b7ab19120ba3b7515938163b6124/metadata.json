It warned that someone in Ukraine had obtained Podesta\u2019s personal Gmail password and tried unsuccessfully to log in, and it directed him to a website where he should \u201cchange your password immediately.\u201d \\nPodesta\u2019s chief of staff, Sara Latham, forwarded the email to the operations help desk of Clinton\u2019s campaign, where staffer Charles Delavan in Brooklyn, New York, wrote back 25 minutes later, \u201cThis is a legitimate email. John needs to change his password immediately.\u201d \\nBut that \u201clegitimate\u201d email, wasn\u2019t so authentic. \\nThey were later leaked to WikiLeaks, and are being put on public display one email dump at a time. \\nNYPost continues: \\nThe link to the website where Podesta was encouraged to change his Gmail password actually directed him instead to a computer in the Netherlands with a web address associated with Tokelau, a territory of New Zealand located in the South Pacific. The hackers carefully disguised the link using a service that shortens lengthy online addresses. But even for anyone checking more diligently, the address \u2014 \u201c google.com-securitysettingpage \u201d \u2014 was crafted to appear genuine. \\n[\u2026] It is not immediately clear how Podesta responded to the threat, but five months later hackers successfully downloaded tens of thousands of emails from Podesta\u2019s accounts that have now been posted online. The Clinton campaign declined to discuss the incident. Podesta has previously confirmed his emails were hacked and said the FBI was investigating \\nClinton staffers should be more careful about what is a legitimate link and what is not. \\nAnd Hillary herself should be more careful about what she says in them. \\nFor Hillary, nothing\u2019s worse on public display than the truth.'"}, "time": 1742562994.7991927}
