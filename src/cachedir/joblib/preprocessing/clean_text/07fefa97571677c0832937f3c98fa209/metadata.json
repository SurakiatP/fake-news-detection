State Department warns against travel to Mexico. [Popular resort destinations like Acapulco, Cabo San Lucas, Guadalajara, La Paz, Mazatlan, Puerto Vallarta, and even Tijuana are among the locations the feds caution travel to because of violence attributed to the \u201cactivities of criminal organizations. \u201d  As Breitbart Texas reported, the tourist hotspot of Acapulco, Guerrero, has become the scene of of a fierce turf war as rival drug cartels continue to fight for control of the region. In December, the State Department named Guerrero \u201cthe most violent state in Mexico in 2015 for a third year in a row, and   groups operate independently of the government in many areas,\u201d noting that armed members of these groups in Guerrero maintain roadblocks which \u201calthough not considered hostile to foreigners or tourists, are suspicious of outsiders and should be considered volatile and unpredictable. \u201d Officials also urge spring break travelers to exercise caution in Baja California Sur getaways like Cabo San Lucas and La Paz because of homicides, many of which happened in La Paz \u201cwhere there have been ongoing public acts of violence between rival criminal organizations. \u201d Guadalajara and Puerto Vallarta in Jalisco are subject to travel restrictions related to \u201ccontinued instability\u201d in the bordering states of Michoac\u00e1n and Zacatecas. Baja California, home to Tijuana, Rosarito, Ensenada, Tecate, and Mexicali, experienced increased homicide rates last year because of \u201ctargeted criminal organization assassinations\u201d and \u201cturf battles between criminal groups. \u201d This \u201cspring break\u201d alert stems from the State Department\u2019s December 2016 Mexico Travel Warning. It classified Mexico as a country with a high potential for kidnapping, carjacking, homicide, robbery, and other crimes because of a lack of security measures in place for travelers. Fourteen of Mexico\u2019s 31 states were flagged as dangerous after Americans became victims of these and other violent crimes. The State Department says there is \u201cno evidence that criminal organizations have targeted U. S. citizens based on their nationality\u201d and the Mexican government devotes \u201csubstantial resources\u201d to keep tourists safe. Still, the department underscores \u201cgun battles between rival criminal organizations or with Mexican authorities have taken place on streets and in public places during broad daylight\u201d in areas where visiting Americans traverse. Mexican resorts and tourist attractions \u201cdo not see the level of   violence and crime that are reported in the border region or in areas along major trafficking routes,\u201d according to the advisory. Still, the State Department issued   spring break safety tips online for students to traveling to Mexico and the Caribbean. They suggest remaining aware of one\u2019s surroundings, leaving valuables at home, and not participating in political protests. They also advise students to hail licensed and regulated taxis only, warning \u201csome illegitimate taxi drivers are, in fact, criminals in search of victims. \u201d The pamphlet points out some travelers who rode in unlicensed taxis were robbed, kidnapped,   raped. Tamaulipas, which sits just across from the U. S.  Border, and the nearby Coahuila are areas where \u201cviolence and criminal activity, including homicide, armed robbery, carjacking, kidnapping, extortion, and sexual assault, pose significant and continuing security concerns,\u201d Breitbart Texas reported. Even though the State Department singled out this region among those with the highest kidnapping rate, Nuevo Progreso in Tamaulipas attracts another spring break demographic  \u2014   retirees, according to KENS. They spoke to a group of Canadians who said they have been coming to the border town for 20 years. One of them said: \u201cAll of the negative reporting and fear reporting, and I guess these is something to some of it, but maybe too much. \u201d Breitbart Texas reported Playa Del Carmen and Cancun have largely avoided most of the violence that has taken hold in other Mexican tourist areas. Cozumel, Riviera Maya, and Tulum are other popular spots not under a travel warning. Follow Merrill Hope, a member of the original Breitbart Texas team, on Twitter.'"}, "time": 1742563068.0730598}
