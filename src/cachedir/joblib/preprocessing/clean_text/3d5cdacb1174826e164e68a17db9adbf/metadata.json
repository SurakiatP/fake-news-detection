But that can\u2019t be the case, because if this kind of thing was really happening to these people, we\u2019d be talking about it more than we\u2019re talking about a viral game that serves only to fill our timelines with nonsense so we don\u2019t have to cope with the realities of this world. In fact, it\u2019s the best viral video to come out of the country since the ice-bucket challenge they filmed in the Mediterranean last year\u201d. \\nIt is really up there with the best we\u2019ve seen, to view the epic video, click HERE.'"}, "time": 1742562970.0817866}
