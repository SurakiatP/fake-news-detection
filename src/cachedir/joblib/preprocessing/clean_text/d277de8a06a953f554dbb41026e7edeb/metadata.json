[The negative responses ranged from the staid and stoic expression of \u201cprincipled\u201d outrage from members of the business community like Tesla and SpaceX\u2019s Elon Musk and Disney\u2019s Bob Iger  \u2026      As a matter of principle, I\u2019ve resigned from the President\u2019s Council over the  #ParisAgreement withdrawal.  \u2014   Robert Iger (@RobertIger) June 1, 2017,    \u2026    to poignant   by the likes of Sen.

This disastrous decision threatens the world our children and children\u2019s children will live in. #ParisAgreement,  \u2014   Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) June 1, 2017,  Shame on you @realDonaldTrump as people lose their lives, homes and economic opportunities to your childish refusal to honor #ParisAgreement,  \u2014   Mark Ruffalo (@MarkRuffalo) June 1, 2017,    \u2026    to the truly bizarre resonses of certain   like UNICEF, who implied Trump\u2019s decision to pull the U. S. out of this agreement would harm children, presumably by placing those of them who live on small icebergs in immediate danger of drowning.

S.  \u2014   ACLU National (@ACLU) June 1, 2017,  The post quickly racked up thousands of reply and retweets from bewildered Twitter users. In response, the ACLU account explained in a series of tweets that \u201cblack and brown people\u201d are more likely to live near coal plants and also more likely to have asthma. Black and brown people are more likely to live near coal plants, and have higher asthma rates than white Americans do.  \u2014   ACLU National (@ACLU) June 1, 2017,  The exact connection between these statements, which were unsourced, and the Paris Climate Agreement was not explained. The ACLU account stopped tweeting about the Paris Agreement and switched back to another ACLU campaign, the apparent overbreadth of federal child pornography laws and teens\u2019 right to \u201csext\u201d each other.   did, however, come from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, who supported the validity of the ACLU\u2019s claim, extolling readers to #StayWoke: Climate impacts real people and real communities =that\u2019s not an \u201d ! \u201d#staywoke@ACLU. @JacquiPatt. @ECJPNAACP1. @IndianaNAACPECJ. https:  .   \u2014   NAACP (@NAACP) June 1, 2017, '"}, "time": 1742562248.973202}
