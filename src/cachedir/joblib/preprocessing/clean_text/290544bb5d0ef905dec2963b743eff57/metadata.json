When asked by host Jake Tapper if   Barack Obama could have done more to strike back against Russia, who is widely believed to be responsible for the WikiLeaks material, Pelosi called the press \u201caccomplices. \u201d \u201cWell, I think that President Obama handled it as he received information of that  \u2014   of the highest confidence,\u201d she said. \u201cI do think, with all due respect in the world for the press, that the press could have done a better job, instead of printing every email that came out, and saying this comes to you from Vladimir Putin, they were, hah, hah, hah, John Podesta said this or that. I think the press were accomplices in the undermining of our election by the Russians by not pointing out this stuff is worthless because it comes from an undermining of our election, or at least reminding the public where this  \u2014   these emails, the leaking of these emails came from. So, I can\u2019t speak to the timing of what President Obama said. I wish he  \u2014   it had all happened in a time where the public could know that this had an impact on the election. A lot of things have an impact on the election. This certainly was one of them. \u201cSo, I can\u2019t speak to the timing of what President Obama said.

But what\u2019s important to note is that it doesn\u2019t happen again and that people in other countries are  \u2014   realize what they are going to be susceptible to when the Russians come in to undermine their elections. \u201d Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor'"}, "time": 1742561825.2849317}
