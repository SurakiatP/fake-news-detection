But our committees that write these bills are working very, very closely with the administration, are   the legislation.   \u2026     When they\u2019re done with their   they\u2019ll make that announcement and then they\u2019ll tell us when they\u2019re ready to go and move on the legislation. So, they\u2019ll make that announcement pretty soon I think. \u201d When asked about critics who say that he\u2019s doing what the Democrats did and jamming legislation through without transparency, Ryan responded, \u201cAre you kidding me, Bret? Give me a break. Seriously?\u201d He elaborated, \u201cLast year, in early 2016, we rolled out an Obamacare repeal and replace plan. We called it A Better Way. You can go on the Internet and read it. We ran on that plan. That plan resembled Tom Price\u2019s legislation, that so many people in Congress were   of. Then, after the election came, and we won the election, we started putting that plan into legislative text, having hearings, all these hearings on repealing and replacing Obamacare were in the Congressional committees. So, we\u2019ve been doing hearings all year long. Now, we\u2019re translating the findings of those hearings, that plan into legislative text. That\u2019s the    \u2026    that\u2019s occurring. And then guess what? This bill\u2019s not being written in my office like it was in Harry Reid\u2019s office on Christmas Eve in 2009. This bill is written  \u2014   being written by the committees that are in charge of healthcare, which is the regular order process. This bill will go through the committee process, go through the Budget Committee, then go to the floor of Congress, under what we call regular order. That is precisely the most transparent, and normal way of doing business, which is the opposite of what the Democrats did when they crammed Obamacare through. \u201d After being played Rand Paul\u2019s criticism of the   process and his accusation that he thinks there\u2019s \u201ca lot of Obamacare light\u201d in the replacement, Ryan countered that Rand\u2019s accusations weren\u2019t true. He added, \u201cI like Rand, but I think he\u2019s looking for a publicity stunt here. What\u2019s happening is, the committees of jurisdiction are drafting legislation and getting feedback from their members. That\u2019s exactly how legislation is supposed to be written. The things he described are just not accurate, and like I said, when the committees write their bills and put their bills out there to mark up, everybody will see what they\u2019ve done. \u201d Ryan further described \u201cin general\u201d what the replacement would look like. He said, \u201cWe\u2019re talking about giving the states control of the Medicaid program, which is something that conservatives have been fighting for for years.   \u2026     And then on the tax fraud, we\u2019ve long been saying that we need equalize the tax treatment of healthcare for everybody in America. Right now, the tax code discriminates against people who do not get healthcare from their jobs. There\u2019s a huge tax benefit if you get taxpayer  \u2014   if you get healthcare at work. If you\u2019ve got to go buy your health insurance, there\u2019s no tax benefit for you. So, what conservatives have long said is, let\u2019s equalize the tax treatment for healthcare, so that if you  \u2014   it doesn\u2019t matter whether you get it  \u2014   healthcare at work, or not at work, let\u2019s give you the same kind of tax benefit. So, that you can go buy what you want to buy. You go into a free market as a consumer, and buy the plan of your choosing, with health savings accounts as well. This is what we have long stood on as conservatives. It is the plan that we ran on in all of 2016, that we said, if we get the chance of having a Republican president, a Republican House, and a Republican Senate, we\u2019re going to repeal and replace Obamacare and this is what we\u2019re going to replace it with. Well, guess what? We are keeping that promise, and that is exactly what we are doing here. \u201d Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742562342.4541852}
