Bill McKay, 56, usually sings Born in the USA while greeting passers-by but locals claim he doesn\u2019t quite seem his usual jolly self. Local Barista, Julian Cook said, \u201cHe\u2019s usually so full of life. Dancing about the place, proposing to every girl who walks past him and then laughing when they walk off. But today he\u2019s just sat there looking bloody depressed. \u201cI wonder why he\u2019s in such a mood? \u201c Usually I\u2019d give him a cup of coffee and a bit of cake for being so entertaining but if he\u2019s going to just sit there looking like he wants to cry then he can sod off.\u201d When asked why he was so down, McKay simply shook his head, muttered something about the government and then looked off down the street with a heavy sigh. Cook added: \u201cSee. What\u2019s funny about that?\u201d \\nShare:'"}, "time": 1742562925.765497}
