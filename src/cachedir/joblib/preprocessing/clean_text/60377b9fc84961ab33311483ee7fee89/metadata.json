[Organized by Reddit community member \u201cjbaayoun,\u201d the For Honor gameplay blackout will begin at 5 AM and last for a minimum of 24 hours. Players are protesting the game\u2019s ongoing balance issues, some so grievous that tournament organizers have been forced to ban at least one class from competitive play.  The participants are seeking greater transparency from the game\u2019s developer and publisher around issues that have plagued the title since release. First, they want clearer communication between Ubisoft and For Honor fans. This should include a more informative version of the ongoing \u201cWarrior\u2019s Den\u201d livestreams that the developers have been promoting. Second, they want a clearly defined roadmap for the game\u2019s future. If players are going to stick around for the literal years needed to fully unlock the game\u2019s content, they want a plan of future content that will give them a good reason to do so. Third, boycotters want a solution to the aforementioned glacial pace of earning the game\u2019s \u201cSteel\u201d currency to make the grind for unlocking content a bit less punishing. Finally, players want to see a solution for the game\u2019s ongoing matchmaking woes. Of note, Ubisoft has recently posted patch notes in the official forums that address a few of the game\u2019s issues, including a sizeable boost to Steel income. It\u2019s a welcome first step to addressing one problem among many in a game that is robbed of its potential for greatness by clumsy execution. Will a community boycott draw the publishing giant\u2019s attention to make a difference? We\u2019ll find out on April 3rd, unless either the publisher or development team deign to respond sooner.
