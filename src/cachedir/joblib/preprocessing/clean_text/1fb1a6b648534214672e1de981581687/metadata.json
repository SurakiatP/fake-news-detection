But while the markets panicked  \u2014   an estimated $2 trillion was wiped off world markets the day after the vote  \u2014   the decline of the currency has proved a boon for Britain\u2019s luxury watch retailers. With watches priced in pounds  \u2014   particularly those at the high end  \u2014   suddenly much more attractive to the international market, customers from all over the world have been buying in Britain. London has felt the biggest \u201cBrexit\u201d boom. According to the global market research company GfK, sales of watches priced at more than 10, 000 pounds, or about $12, 320, were up 67 percent in the British capital in September, compared with the same period last year. And the figure was almost as high outside London, up 56 percent. The Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry reported that exports to Britain were up 32. 4 percent year over year in September, making the country the world\u2019s   importer of Swiss watches. In 2015, it was eighth. \u201cBrexit has been hugely beneficial,\u201d said Brian Duffy, chief executive of Aurum Group, which he said accounts for 46 percent of all British watch sales through its network of Watches of Switzerland, Mappin  Webb and Goldsmiths stores. \u201cThere are undoubtedly more tourists, and they\u2019re looking to spend, because they\u2019re confident in the value they\u2019re getting. Luxury watch sales across the group are up by 40 percent, end of June to Week 1 of October. \u201d David Coleridge, chairman of The Watch Gallery, which operates showrooms in Selfridges on Oxford Street and in Manchester, as well as a Rolex boutique in the ultraluxury apartment building One Hyde Park in Knightsbridge, said Brexit had created \u201cthe perfect storm. \u201d \u201cIn July,   Arab customers arrived after Ramadan and discovered that London was almost free,\u201d he said. \u201cThen there was publicity around the world that the pound had slid and it was cheap to go to London, and visitor numbers leapt up. And then terrorism in Europe meant more people coming here. \u201d Sales by a rival retailer in Paris are down 50 percent, Mr. Coleridge noted, adding that even the highly publicized Oct. 2 robbery of Kim Kardashian West, in which jewelry worth millions was stolen while she was visiting Paris, has had an effect. Brands agree that Britain\u2019s market has improved. Vacheron Constantin opened its Bond Street boutique in 2013 and while it had a slow start, the company\u2019s brand manager in Britain, Celine Larose, said sales are picking up  . \u201cOur clients are very \u201d she said. \u201cBut they are no longer waiting. \u201d And those sales increases have come despite what brands, including all the   houses such as Cartier and Montblanc, are calling inevitable price increases as they try to offset the global imbalance caused by the falling pound. \u201cWe put our prices up by 10 percent at the beginning of August,\u201d said Mark Hearn, Patek Philippe\u2019s managing director for Britain. \u201cWe try to ensure the playing field is level all around the world. If you have one market that is dramatically cheaper than everywhere else, there are customers who will gravitate to whichever market is significantly cheaper. \u201d In Britain, for example, Cartier announced a 10 percent rise after the June vote. Roger Dubuis followed an 8 percent price rise in August with a further 6 percent increase taking effect Nov. 1, the same day that Rolex, which had not increased prices in Britain for three years, announced a 10 percent rise. Now the challenge that brands face is convincing the domestic market that it is still a good time to buy. \u201cWhile increasing U. K. retail prices will mean that a fine watch purchase needs to be even more considered by a domestic client than usual,\u201d said Helen David, Harrods\u2019s chief merchant, \u201cgenerally, watch purchases, particularly at the higher end, are investment purchases, and as such we continue to see upward movement. \u201d She added that Harrods\u2019s luxury watch division is experiencing high   growth this year. Richard Mille, whose watches frequently sell for six figures, takes a different approach. \u201cWe have a price list in Swiss francs, and we sell at the spot rate on the day,\u201d said Peter Harrison, the company\u2019s chief executive for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. \u201cIt\u2019s the fairest way for our customers  \u2014   that way, whether they\u2019re spending in pounds, euros or dollars, it\u2019s up to them when they spend. \u201d Not all brands are bowing to the pressures created by the weakening of the pound: Swatch Group and LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton brands such as TAG Heuer and Hublot have held prices stable, absorbing shrinking margins in a bid to protect local business. Retailers, however, are expecting LVMH\u2019s watch division to raise prices in the new year. \u201cOmega and Swatch Group are not opportunistic,\u201d said Raynald Aeschlimann, Omega\u2019s president and chief executive. \u201cTo increase sales would go against our domestic market. For British customers, nothing has changed and we want to keep momentum with those local customers. Raising prices would send a wrong signal. \u201d Mr. Hearn said Patek Philippe\u2019s price increase had not affected local business and said that despite the increase, Britons would continue to buy at home. \u201cIf it\u2019s cheaper in the U. K. for tourists, it\u2019s also cheaper for U. K. customers to buy here, as opposed to buying abroad,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly, there are Patek Philippe owners in the U. K. who would have been interested in shopping in Hong Kong, the U. S. or Switzerland who choose to buy in the U. K. now. \u201d The question that brands and retailers are asking themselves is how long the Brexit boom will last. Sales of luxury watches in Britain were on an upward curve before the vote, plumped up by London\u2019s improved reputation as a tourist destination over the past decade and by investment by brands and retailers in retail experience in the city, as well as by redirected sales because of security issues on the Continent. GfK\u2019s figures indicate British sales of watches that cost more than \u00a31, 000 grew 19. 5 percent between January and August, with significant growth even before the departure vote. \u201cWithout considering Brexit, our business has dramatically increased in the U. K.,\u201d said Ricardo Guadalupe, Hublot\u2019s chief executive. \u201cBrexit was the icing on the cake, but other geopolitical variables such as terrorist attacks and the current feeling of insecurity have more severely jeopardized business in Europe. \u201d London also benefits from the variety of its tourist customers. \u201cCompare London to Hong Kong  \u2014   it\u2019s suffering because it\u2019s so reliant on Chinese customers,\u201d Mr. Coleridge said. \u201cLondon has a mix. We\u2019re even selling to Americans, now. Rolexes are 35 percent cheaper here than in New York. \u201d Many experts predict a further fall in the value of the pound, posing a continuing problem for brands looking to manage a balanced global pricing strategy. But confidence among British retailers is high. \u201cThe U. K. will remain advantaged for the future,\u201d Mr. Duffy said. \u201cWe were doing well before Brexit, despite being disadvantaged by a strong pound and visa restrictions. The consumer has confidence in the U. K. market. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562222.1522467}
