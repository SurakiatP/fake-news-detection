Brooks stated, \u201c[I]t may be a witchhunt, but he\u2019s acting like a witch. You know, to me, we\u2019ve had this  \u2014   the idea that there\u2019s been collusion between the Russians and the Trump campaign has been investigated for a long time. And so far, we\u2019ve had no really serious evidence that they did collude, and everything else seems to be leaking out. So, I begin to be a little suspicious \u2014  and maybe I\u2019m wrong \u2014  we\u2019ll see over the long term whether there was any actual act of collusion. There were certainly conversations maybe about some building and some investment, but so far, no evidence of an underlying crime. \u201d He continued, \u201cBut this, to me, is not a criminal story. It\u2019s a psychological story. And it\u2019s a story about a president who seems to feel under more pressure, under more threat, lashing out in ways that are painfully   but also extremely disturbing to anybody around him. And so, whether it\u2019s the North Korean Cabinet hearing that he held recently, where they all had to praise him, or the tweets as late as this morning, this is not a president who\u2019s projecting mental stability. And the idea that he\u2019ll fire somebody, whether it\u2019s Mueller or anybody else, seems very plausible. And so, to me, if there\u2019s something really damaging here, it\u2019s something that has not yet happened caused by the psychological pressure that he apparently feels. \u201d Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742564370.9273257}
