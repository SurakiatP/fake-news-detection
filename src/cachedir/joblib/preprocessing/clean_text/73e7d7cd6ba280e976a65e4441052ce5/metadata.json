Trump just keeps growing \u2014 and a new cringe-inducing video from a 2011 corporate speech adds yet another . In the video, Trump not only sexually assaults, but humiliates, the 2004 Miss Universe winner on stage, in front of thousands. \u201cShe\u2019s not very bright\u201d \\nBoth candidates have had cringe-inducing moments this election cycle, but by-the-by, Clinton\u2019s have been significantly less than Trump\u2019s have and Trump\u2019s have come in rapid succession of horrible moments; a parade of everything wrong with the masculine idea in the United States. A new video posted by the Huffington Post on Saturday added yet another horrible moment to the raft of them \u2014 a raft that, in any decent society, would have already sunk. \\nA few weeks ago, a tape of Donald Trump emerged into the popular conscious. The tape contained two things: Trump admitting that he sexually assaulted women and Trump using the word \u201cpussy.\u201d No points for guessing which one pissed off more of his evangelical supporters. Since then, a huge number of women have come forward and leveled accusations of sexual assault at Donald Trump. \\nMake no mistake, Trump is having his Bill Cosby moment right now. \\nAmong the list of accusations against Trump include claims that Trump told a group of 10-year-olds that he\u2019d date them in 10 years, a telling a group of 14-year-olds he\u2019d date them in a few years, groping women, sexually assaulting women, and we can\u2019t forget that he\u2019s been accused of raping a 13-year-old at a party hosted by infamous American financier and level three sex offender Jeffery Epstein (who served three months of an 18 month prison sentence for soliciting sex from an underage prostitute, because we don\u2019t have a two-tier justice system at all in the United States). \\nThus, this new footage that shows Trump forcing 2004 Miss Universe winner Jennifer Hawkins into a nonconsensual kiss and then humiliating her on stage isn\u2019t an aberration. It\u2019s a continuation of the skeevy behavior that a huge number of men are not only okay with, not only think is normal, but believe is something that\u2019s worth preserving and perpetuating instead of stamping out like an intellectual scabies infection. \\nThe video shows Trump calling Hawkins on stage to join him after telling the audience his philosophy of using revenge to succeed in business: \u201cGet even with people,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they screw you, screw them back 10 times as hard. I really believe that.\u201d \\nThere are a few quotes from the Bible that are relevant here, but I\u2019m pretty sure that Biblical literalists and right-wing evangelicals don\u2019t know what those quotes are. They\u2019re too busy agreeing with Trump. \\nTrump was apparently mad at Hawkins the day before because he thought she\u2019d slighted him by declining to introduce him at an event in Sydney \u2014 Hawkins, it should be noted, is Australian. Once she was onstage with Trump, Hawkings laughed apologetically and said it was a \u201cmiscommunication with my management,\u201d which left her, \u201c[feeling] really bad.\u201d \\nTrump seemed to accept this, saying: \u201cWhen she found out, she got in her car and she got her ass over here, and I love her.\u201d \\nSpray-tan Hitler has a well-known vindictive streak. He at least entertained the possibility of forming a PAC to sink the political careers of Ted Cruz \u2014 voted second most punchable face in the world after Trump superfan and Breitbart personality Milo Yiannopoulos \u2014 and John Kasich after the two of them refused to show up at the Republican national convention and kiss his ring. He\u2019s threatened to use his power as president to arrest people he disagrees with. To say he\u2019s vindictive may well be a British-level understatement (and if he\u2019s elected, it\u2019ll definitely be a British-level mistake). \\nThat vindictive streak is probably what led to the sequence of bizarre events that followed, culminating ultimately with Trump forcing a nonconsensual kiss on Hawkins. \\nFirst, he described how he would have embarrassed Hawkin if she\u2019d really slighted him: \u201cI was actually going to get up and tell you that Jennifer is a beautiful girl on the outside, but she\u2019s not very bright. That wouldn\u2019t have been true, but I would have said it anyway.\u201d \\nTrump then made a sexual pun, and of course lingered on it until the audience got it or laughed out of awkwardness, I can\u2019t be sure which: \u201cAnd you know what? She came tonight, she came \u2014 came, she came, she came.\u201d Once the audience laughed, Trump added: \u201cSee, so they have the same filthy minds in Australia.\u201d \\nThen he grabbed her around the waist and forced a kiss on her. This is pretty much on par with what others have accused Trump of doing \u2014 according to Cathy Heller, who claims that Trump assaulted her at a Mother\u2019s Day brunch at Mar-a-Lago : \u201cHe took my hand, and grabbed me, and went for the lips,\u201d she claimed. Alarmed, she said she leaned backwards to avoid him and almost lost her balance. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018Oh, come on.\u2019 He was strong. And he grabbed me and went for my mouth and went for my lips.\u201d She turned her head, she claims, and Trump planted a kiss on the side of her mouth. \u201cHe kept me there for a little too long,\u201d Heller said. \u201cAnd then he just walked away.\u201d \\nIf you feel like you need a shower after this, just remember: you probably have a relative who thinks voting for this man is a good idea. \\nPhoto by Ethan Miller/Getty Images Share this Article!'"}, "time": 1742562769.5731657}
