Not only could the rich get richer, writes the author, but it is \u201cperfectly plausible\u201d that they could choose to eliminate the poor. [From the article:  Meanwhile, robotic capital would enable elites to completely secede from society. From private jets to private islands, the rich already devote a great deal of time and expense to insulating themselves from other people. But even the best fortified luxury bunker is tethered to the outside world, so long as capital needs labor to reproduce itself. Mass automation would make it possible to sever this link. Equipped with an infinite supply of workerless wealth, elites could seal themselves off in a gated paradise, leaving the unemployed masses to rot. If that scenario isn\u2019t bleak enough, consider the possibility that mass automation could lead not only to the impoverishment of working people, but to their annihilation. In his book Four Futures, Peter Frase speculates that the economically redundant hordes outside the gates would only be tolerated for so long. After all, they might get restless  \u2014   and that\u2019s a lot of possible pitchforks. \u201cWhat happens if the masses are dangerous but are no longer a working class, and hence of no value to the rulers?\u201d Frase writes. \u201cSomeone will eventually get the idea that it would be better to get rid of them. \u201d He gives this future an appropriately frightening name: \u201cexterminism\u201d a world defined by the \u201cgenocidal war of the rich against the poor\u201d. The author argues that without \u201csubstantive political change,\u201d such a scenario is \u201cperfectly plausible. \u201d He also argues that a robot tax, an idea recently endorsed by Bill Gates, ought to be considered. These dystopias may sound like science fiction, but they\u2019re perfectly plausible given our current trajectory. The technology around robotics and artificial intelligence will continue to improve  \u2014   but without substantive political change, the outcome will range from bad to apocalyptic for most people. That\u2019s why the recent rumblings about a robot tax are worth taking seriously. They offer an opportunity to develop the political response to mass automation now, before it\u2019s too late.
