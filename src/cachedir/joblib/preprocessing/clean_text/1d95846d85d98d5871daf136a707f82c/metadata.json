(Photo: Shutterstock) \\nEmployees were expected to load each customer with at least eight accounts, and employees were monitored constantly on meeting their quota \u2014 fail and you\u2019d be fired. \\nThat\u2019s why the bosses\u2019 sales culture turned employees into a syndicate of bank robbers. The thievery was systemic, and it wasn\u2019t subtle. \\nHalf a million customers were secretly issued credit and debit cards they didn\u2019t request, fake email accounts for online services were set up without customers\u2019 knowledge, depositors\u2019 money was moved from one account to another, signatures were forged, and \u2014 of course \u2014 Wells Fargo collected fees for all of these bogus transactions, boosting its profits. \\nCEO John Stumpf was recently forced out because of the scandal, but what about the other top executives and the board of directors \u2014 all of whom were highly paid partners in this crime? \\nStumpf wasn\u2019t the only rotten apple at Wells Fargo. This isn\u2019t a case of a few bankers gone rogue, but of a whole bank gone rogue, rotting from the head down.'"}, "time": 1742564219.5543258}
