Chand, then 18 and one of India\u2019s fastest runners, was preparing for the coming Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, her first big international event as an adult. Earlier that month, Chand won gold in both the   sprint and the     relay at the Asian Junior Athletics Championships in Taipei, Taiwan, so her hopes for Scotland were high. Chand was raised in Gopalpur, a rural village in eastern India with only intermittent electricity. The family home was a small mud hut, with no running water or toilet. Her parents, weavers who earned less than $8 a week laboring on a   loom, were illiterate. They had not imagined a different life for their seven children, but Chand had other ideas. Now, as she took the   bus ride to Delhi from a training center in Punjab, she thought about her impending move to Bangalore for a new training program. She wondered if she would make friends, and how she\u2019d manage there without her beloved coach, who had long been by her side, strategizing about how best to run each race and joking to help her relax whenever she was nervous. She thought little of the meeting in Delhi, because she assumed it was for a doping test. But when Chand arrived in Delhi, she says, she was sent to a clinic to meet a doctor from the Athletics Federation of India  \u2014   the Indian affiliate of the International Association of Athletics Federations (I. A. A. F.) which governs track and field. He told her he would forgo the usual urine and blood tests because no nurse was available, and would order an ultrasound instead. That confused Chand, but when she asked him about it, she recalls, he said it was routine. Chand had no idea that her extraordinary showing in Taipei and at a national championship earlier that month had prompted competitors and coaches to tell the federation that her physique seemed suspiciously masculine: Her muscles were too pronounced, her stride was too impressive for someone who was only five feet tall. The doctor would later deny that the ultrasound was a response to those reports, saying he ordered the scan only because Chand had previously complained of chronic abdominal pain. She contends she never had any such pain. Three days after the ultrasound, the federation sent a letter titled \u201cSubject: Gender Verification Issue\u201d to the Indian government\u2019s sports author ity. \u201cIt has been brought to the notice of the undersigned that there are definite doubts regarding the gender of an Athlete Ms. Dutee Chand,\u201d the letter read. It also noted that in the past, such cases \u201chave brought embarrassment to the fair name of sports in India. \u201d The letter requested the author ities perform a \u201cgender verification test\u201d on Chand. Shortly after, Chand says, she was sent to a private hospital in Bangalore, where a curt woman drew her blood to measure her level of natural testosterone, though Chand had no idea that was what was being measured. Chand also underwent a chromosome analysis, an M. R. I. and a gynecological exam that she found mortifying. To evaluate the effects of high testosterone, the international athletic association\u2019s protocol involves measuring and palpating the clitoris, vagina and labia, as well as evaluating breast size and pubic hair scored on an illustrated   scale. The tests were meant to identify competitors whose chromosomes, hormones, genitalia, reproductive organs or secondary sex characteristics don\u2019t develop or align in the typical way. The word \u201chermaphrodite\u201d is considered stigmatizing, so physicians and advocates instead use the term \u201cintersex\u201d or refer to the condition as D. S. D. which stands for either a disorder or a difference of sex development. Estimates of the number of intersex people vary widely, ranging from one in 5, 000 to one in 60, because experts dispute which of the myriad conditions to include and how to tally them accurately. Some intersex women, for instance, have XX chromosomes and ovaries, but because of a genetic quirk are born with ambiguous genitalia, neither male nor female. Others have XY chromosomes and undescended testes, but a mutation affecting a key enzyme makes them appear female at birth they\u2019re raised as girls, though at puberty, rising testosterone levels spur a deeper voice, an elongated clitoris and increased muscle mass. Still other intersex women have XY chromosomes and internal testes but appear female their whole lives, developing rounded hips and breasts, because their cells are insensitive to testosterone. They, like others, may never know their sex development was unusual, unless they\u2019re tested for infertility  \u2014   or to compete in   sports. When Chand\u2019s results came in a few days later, the doctor said her \u201cmale hormone\u201d levels were too high, meaning she produced more androgens, mostly testosterone, than most women did. The typical female range is roughly 1. 0 to 3. 3 nanomoles of testosterone per liter of blood, about   that of typical males. Chand\u2019s level is not publicly known, but it was above the     threshold that the I. A. A. F. set for female competitors because that level is within the \u201cmale range. \u201d As a result, officials said, she could no longer race. In the two years since, Chand has been at the center of a legal case that contests not only her disqualification but also the international policy her lawyers say discriminates against athletes with atypical sex development. For Chand, who had never heard the words \u201ctestosterone\u201d or \u201cintersex,\u201d it has been a slow and painful education. When she was first told she was being barred because of her testosterone level, she didn\u2019t understand anything the officials were saying. \u201cI said, \u2018What have I done that is wrong? \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d she told me by phone in May through a Hindi translator. \u201cThen the media got my phone number and started calling me and asking about an androgen test, and I had no idea what an androgen test was. The media asked, \u2018Did you have a gender test?\u2019 And I said, \u2018What is a gender test? \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d No governing body has so tenaciously tried to determine who counts as a woman for the purpose of sports as the I. A. A. F. and the International Olympic Committee (I. O. C. ). Those two influential organizations have spent a   vigorously policing gender boundaries. Their rationale for decades was to catch male athletes masquerading as women, though they never once discovered an impostor. Instead, the athletes snagged in those efforts have been intersex women  \u2014   scores of them. The treatment of female athletes, and intersex women in particular, has a long and sordid his tory. For centuries, sport was the exclusive province of males, the competitive arena where masculinity was cultivated and proven. Sport endowed men with the physical and psychological strength that \u201cmanhood\u201d required. As women in the late 19th century encroached on explicitly male domains  \u2014   sport, education, paid labor  \u2014   many in society became increasingly anxious if a woman\u2019s place wasn\u2019t immutable, maybe a man\u2019s role, and the power it entailed, were not secure either. Well into the 20th century, women were discouraged from participating in sports. Some medical experts claimed that vigorous exercise would damage women\u2019s reproductive capacity and their fragile emotional state and would make them muscular, \u201cmannish\u201d and unattractive to men. Critics fretted that athletics would unbind women from femininity\u2019s modesty and  . As women athletes\u2019 strength and confidence grew, some observers began to wonder if fast, powerful athletes could even be women. In the 1936 Berlin Olympics, the runners Stella Walsh of Poland and Helen Stephens of the United States were rumored to be male impostors because of their remarkable athleticism, \u201c \u201d muscles and angular faces. After Stephens narrowly beat Walsh in the   dash and posted a world record, Stephens was publicly accused of being a man, by Walsh or Polish journalists  \u2014   accounts vary. German Olympics officials had examined Stephens\u2019s genitals before the event and declared her female. Four decades later, in an unexpected twist, an autopsy of Walsh revealed she had ambiguous genitalia. In 1938, the gender of an athlete was again in dispute. The German   Dora Ratjen, a former   Olympian who won a gold medal at the European Athletics Championship, was suddenly identified as male, prompting Germany to quietly return the medal. When Ratjen\u2019s case became public years later  \u2014   he claimed that the Nazis pressured him to pose as a woman for three years  \u2014   it vali dated the growing anxiety about gender fraud in athletics. But in 2009, the magazine Der Spiegel investigated medical and police records and found Ratjen had been born with ambiguous genitals but, at the midwife\u2019s suggestion, was raised as a girl, dressed in girls\u2019 clothes and sent to girls\u2019 schools. Dora lived as a female until two years after the 1936 Olympics, when police were alerted to a train traveler in women\u2019s clothes who looked suspiciously masculine. With relief so apparent that the police noted it in their report, Ratjen told them that despite his parents\u2019 claims, he had long suspected he was male. A police physician examined him and agreed, but reported that Ratjen\u2019s genitals were atypical. Ratjen changed his first name from Dora to Heinrich. But those details were unknown until recently, so for decades, Ratjen was considered a gender cheat. By the   international sports administrators began requiring female competitors to bring medical \u201cfemininity certificates\u201d to verify their sex. In the 1950s, many Olympics officials were so uneasy about women\u2019s participation that Prince Franz Josef of Liechtenstein, a member of the International Olympic Committee, spoke for many when he said he wanted to \u201cbe spared the unesthetic spectacle of women trying to look and act like men,\u201d writes Susan K. Cahn, a his tory professor at the University at Buffalo, in her book \u201cComing On Strong: Gender and Sexuality in   Women\u2019s Sports. \u201d Others were particularly bothered by women in track and field because of the strained expressions on their faces during competition. Such female exertion violated the white   ideal of femininity, as did the athletes\u2019 \u201cmasculinized\u201d physiques, prompting Olympic leaders to consider eliminating those events for women. In 1952, the Soviet Union joined the Olympics, stunning the world with the success and brawn of its female athletes. That year, women accounted for 23 of the Soviet Union\u2019s 71 medals, compared with eight of America\u2019s 76 medals. As the Olympics became another front in the Cold War, rumors spread in the 1960s that   female athletes were men who bound their genitals to rake in more wins. Though those claims were never substantiated, in 1966 international sports officials decided they couldn\u2019t trust individual nations to certify femininity, and instead implemented a mandatory genital check of every woman competing at international games. In some cases, this involved what came to be called the \u201cnude parade,\u201d as each woman appeared, underpants down, before a panel of doctors in others, it involved women\u2019s lying on their backs and pulling their knees to their chest for closer inspection. Several Soviet women who had dominated international athletics abruptly dropped out, cementing popular conviction that the Soviets had been tricking authorities. (More recently, some researchers have speculated that those athletes may have been intersex.) Amid complaints about the genital checks, the I. A. A. F. and the I. O. C. introduced a new \u201cgender verification\u201d strategy in the late \u201960s: a chromosome test. Officials considered that a more dignified, objective way to root out not only impostors but also intersex athletes, who, Olympic officials said, needed to be barred to ensure fair play. Ewa Klobukowska, a Polish sprinter, was among the first to be ousted because of that test she was reportedly found to have both XX and XXY chromosomes. An editorial in the I. O. C. magazine in 1968 insisted the chromosome test \u201cindicates quite definitely the sex of a person,\u201d but many geneticists and endocrinologists disagreed, pointing out that sex was determined by a confluence of genetic, hormonal and physiological factors, not any one alone. Relying on science to arbitrate the   divide in sports is fruitless, they said, because science could not draw a line that nature itself refused to draw. They also argued that the tests discriminated against those whose anomalies provided little or no competitive edge and traumatized women who had spent their whole lives certain they were female, only to be told they were not female enough to participate. One of those competitors was Maria Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez Pati\u00f1o, a    Spanish hurdler who was to run at the 1985 World University Games in Japan. The night before the race, a team official told her that her chromosome test results were abnormal. A more detailed investigation showed that although the outside of her body was fully female, Pati\u00f1o had XY chromosomes and internal testes. But because of a genetic mutation, her cells completely resisted the testosterone she produced, so her body actually had access to less testosterone than a typical woman. Just before the Spanish national championships began, Spanish athletic officials told her she should feign an injury and withdraw from athletics permanently and without fuss. She refused. Instead, she ran the   hurdles and won, at which point someone leaked her test results to the press. Pati\u00f1o was thrown off the national team, expelled from the athletes\u2019 resi dence and denied her scholarship. Her boyfriend and many friends and fellow athletes abandoned her. Her medals and records were revoked. Pati\u00f1o became the first athlete to formally protest the chromosome test and to argue that disqualification was unjustified. After nearly three years, the I. A. A. F. agreed that without being able to use testosterone, her body had no advantage, and it reinstated Pati\u00f1o. But by then, her hopes for making the Olympics were dashed. Dutee Chand was only 4 when she started running, tagging along with her sister, Saraswati, a competitive runner who liked to practice sprints along the local Brahmani River. Saraswati found training boring, so she recruited Dutee, 10 years her junior, to keep her company. For years, Dutee ran in bare feet  \u2014   even on the village\u2019s    streets  \u2014   because she had to protect the only shoes she owned: flimsy rubber   that she knew her parents could not afford to replace. When Dutee was about 7, her parents pressed her to stop running and learn to weave instead. But Saraswati argued that with Dutee\u2019s speed, she could earn more as a sprinter. Saraswati, who has since become a police officer, reminded her parents of the benefits her own running had brought to the family. Once the district government realized Saraswati\u2019s athletic potential, she, like other athletes, was given meat and chicken and eggs, food her family had not been able to afford. And she reminded them of the prize money she brought home whenever she did well in marathons. They agreed to let Dutee run. Not long after, Saraswati used a string to measure Dutee\u2019s foot and took a bus to the nearest city, about 60 miles away, to find an affordable pair of sturdy sneakers for her sister. The ride took three hours, frequently picking up passengers carrying goats or chickens and large bundles. When Saraswati gave Dutee the sneakers the next morning, Saraswati told me over the phone through a translator, Dutee yelped. \u201cShe asked me what can happen if she runs wholeheartedly. She asked if she would go abroad like me, and said she had never sat in a bus or a train, and asked where the money will come from for her to go abroad. I said that \u2018if, with these shoes, you run well, you will be sent abroad from the money that will come to you, and not just that, but you\u2019ll also get a tracksuit. So run! \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d In 2006,    Dutee was accepted into a   sports program more than two hours from the family\u2019s home. Food, lodging and training were covered. She missed home but appreciated the dorm\u2019s electricity, running water and indoor toilets. And she was happy she could send prize money to her parents. That same year, though Dutee didn\u2019t know it, a catastrophe was unfolding for another Indian sprinter. Santhi Soundarajan, a    from southern India, finished second in the 800 meters at the 2006 Asian Games in Doha, Qatar, all the more impressive given her roots as a member of India\u2019s impoverished \u201cuntouchable\u201d caste. The previous decade, the I. O. C. and I. A. A. F. yielded to pressure by the medical and scientific community and stopped   every female athlete. But the groups retained the right to test an athlete\u2019s chromosomes when questions about her sex arose and to follow that with a hormone test, a gynecological exam and a psychological evaluation. In Soundarajan\u2019s case, the media noted that she wasn\u2019t just fast she also had a deep voice and a flat chest. The day after Soundarajan\u2019s race, the Athletics Federation of India drew her blood and examined her body. Some of her results were leaked to the media. Shortly after, Soundarajan was watching TV when she saw a news report that she had \u201cfailed\u201d a sex test. Rejected by the local sports federations, stripped of her silver medal, tormented by ongoing scrutiny and unbearably embarrassed, she attempted suicide, reportedly by swallowing poison. As Chand began competing in national athletics, another runner from a poor rural village, this time in South Africa, burst onto the interna tional athletic stage. When Caster Semenya blew by her opponents in the   race at the 2009 African Junior Championships, her performance raised suspicions. Shortly after, sports officials tested her as she prepared for the World Athletics Championship. Unconcerned  \u2014   she assumed the investigation was for doping  \u2014   Semenya won gold again. Almost immediately, the fact that Semenya had been   was leaked to the press. Instead of attending what is normally the celebratory news conference, Semenya went into hiding. The I. A. A. F. spokesman Nick Davies announced that if Semenya was an impostor, she could be stripped of her medal. He added: \u201cHowever, if it\u2019s a natural thing, and the athlete has always thought she\u2019s a woman or been a woman, it\u2019s not exactly cheating. \u201d Fellow athletes, the press and commenters on social media scrutinized Semenya\u2019s body and made much of her supposed gender transgressions: her muscular physique, her deep voice, her   pose, her unshaved armpits, the long shorts she ran in instead of bikini shorts, in addition to her extraordinary speed. A story on Time magazine\u2019s website was headlined \u201cCould This Women\u2019s World Champ Be a Man?\u201d One of Semenya\u2019s competitors, Elisa Cusma of Italy, who came in sixth, said: \u201cThese kind of people should not run with us. For me, she is not a woman. She is a man. \u201d The Russian star runner Mariya Savinova reportedly sneered, \u201cJust look at her. \u201d (The World   Agency would later accuse Savinova of using   drugs and recommend a lifetime ban.) The I. A. A. F. general secretary, Pierre Weiss, said of Semenya, \u201cShe is a woman, but maybe not 100 percent. \u201d Unlike India, South Africa filed a human rights complaint with the United Nations arguing that the I. A. A. F.\u2019s testing of Semenya was \u201cboth sexist and racist. \u201d Semenya herself would later write in a statement, \u201cI have been subjected to unwarranted and invasive scrutiny of the most intimate and private details of my being. \u201d After nearly a year of negotiations (the details of which are not public) the I. A. A. F. cleared Semenya to run in 2010, and she went on to win the silver medal in the 2012 Olympics. She will be running in Rio. But the federation still faced condemnation over leaks, public smears and the very idea of a sex test. The I. A. A. F. maintained it was obliged to protect female athletes from having \u201cto compete against athletes with   performance advantages commonly associated with men. \u201d In 2011, the association announced that it would abandon all references to \u201cgender verification\u201d or \u201cgender policy. \u201d Instead, it would institute a test for \u201chyperandrogenism\u201d (high testosterone) when there are \u201creasonable grounds for believing\u201d that a woman may have the condition. Women whose testosterone level was \u201cwithin the male range\u201d would be barred. There were two exceptions: If a woman like Maria Pati\u00f1o was resistant to testosterone\u2019s effects  \u2014   or if a woman reduced her testosterone. This entails having her undescended testes surgically removed or taking   drugs. Not long after the policy went into effect, sports officials referred four female athletes from \u201crural or mountainous regions of developing countries\u201d to a French hospital to reduce their high testosterone, according to a 2013 article in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology  Metabolism. The authors, many of whom were physicians who treated the women, describe telling them that leaving in their internal testes \u201ccarries no health risk,\u201d but that removing them would allow the athletes to resume competition, though possibly hurt their performance. The women, who were between 18 and 21, agreed to the procedure. The physicians treating them also recommended surgically reducing their large clitorises to make them look more typical. The article doesn\u2019t mention whether they told their patients that altering their clitorises might impair sexual sensation, but it does say the women agreed to that surgery too. Chand was unaware of any controversy surrounding Semenya or other intersex athletes. Her gender concerns were much more immediate: She saw other    girls becoming curvier and heard them talk about getting their periods. She asked her mother why her body wasn\u2019t doing the same thing, and trusted her answer: Chand\u2019s body would change when it was good and ready. In 2012, Chand advanced to a   athletic training program, which in addition to food and lodging provided a stipend. At 16, she also became a national champion in the   category, winning the 100 meters in 11. 8 seconds. The next year, she won gold in the 100 meters and the 200 meters. In June 2014, she won gold yet again at the Asian championships in Taipei. Not long after that, she received the call to go to Delhi and was tested. After her results came in, officials told her she could return to the national team only if she reduced her testosterone level  \u2014   and that she wouldn\u2019t be allowed to compete for a year. The particulars of her results were not made public, but the media learned, and announced, that Chand had \u201cfailed\u201d a \u201cgender test\u201d and wasn\u2019t a \u201cnormal\u201d woman. For days, Chand cried inconsolably and refused to eat or drink. \u201cSome in the news were saying I was a boy, and some said that maybe I was a transsexual,\u201d Chand told me. \u201cI felt naked. I am a human being, but I felt I was an animal. I wondered how I would live with so much humiliation. \u201d As news spread that Chand had been dropped from the national team, advocates encouraged her to fight back. Payoshni Mitra, an Indian researcher with a doctorate in gender issues in sport who had advocated on behalf of other intersex athletes, suggested Chand send a letter to the Athletics Federation of India, requesting her disqualification be reversed. \u201cI have not doped or cheated,\u201d Chand said in Hindi, and Mitra, who would become Chand\u2019s   adviser, translated to English. \u201cI am unable to understand why I am asked to fix my body in a certain way simply for participation as a woman. I was born a woman, reared up as a woman, I identify as a woman and I believe I should be allowed to compete with other women, many of whom are either taller than me or come from more privileged backgrounds, things that most certainly give them an edge over me. \u201d Mitra and others also urged Chand to take her case to the international Court of Arbitration for Sport  \u2014   the Supreme Court for sports disputes  \u2014   arguing that the I. A. A. F.\u2019s testosterone policy was discriminatory and should be rescinded. She agreed. Over four days in March 2015, a   panel heard Chand\u2019s appeal, as a total of 16 witnesses, including scientists, sports officials and athletes, testified. Female athletes, intersex and not, wondered just how this case would affect their lives. At the hearing, Paula Radcliffe, the British runner who holds the women\u2019s world record for the marathon, testified for the I. A. A. F. saying elevated testosterone levels \u201cmake the competition unequal in a way greater than simple natural talent and dedication. \u201d She added, \u201cThe concern remains that their bodies respond in different, stronger ways to training and racing than women with normal testosterone levels, and that this renders the competition fundamentally unfair. \u201d Madeleine Pape, a 2008 Olympian from Aus tra lia, testified for Chand. Pape lost to Caster Semenya in the 2009 World Championships, Semenya\u2019s last race before her   results were made public. Pape had heard runners complain that Semenya was a man or had   advantages, and she was angry that Semenya seemed to win so easily. \u201cAt the time, I felt that people like Caster shouldn\u2019t be allowed to compete,\u201d Pape told me. But in 2012, Pape began work on a sociology Ph. D. focusing on women in sport. \u201cWith my running days behind me, I had the space to think more critically about all that,\u201d she says. \u201cUntil that point, I had no idea that the science of sex differences is extremely contested and has shifted over time, as have the regulations in sports, which change but don\u2019t improve as they try to get at the same questions. \u201d Just what role testosterone plays in improving athletic performance is still being debated. At the hearing, both sides agreed that synthetic testosterone  \u2014   doping with anabolic steroids  \u2014   does ramp up performance, helping male and female athletes jump higher and run faster. But they disagreed vehemently about whether the body\u2019s own testosterone has the same effect. I. A. A. F. witnesses testified that logic suggests that natural testosterone is likely to work the way its synthetic twin does. They pointed to decades of I. A. A. F. and I. O. C. testing showing that a disproportionate number of elite female athletes, particularly in track and field, have XY chromosomes by their estimates, the presence of the Y chromosome in this group is more than 140 times higher than it is among the general female population. Surely, witnesses for the I. A. A. F. argued, that overrepresentation indicated that natural testosterone has an outsize influence on athletic prowess. Chand\u2019s witnesses countered that even if natural testosterone turns out to play a role in improving performance, testosterone alone can\u2019t explain the overrepresentation of intersex elite athletes after all, many of those XY female athletes had low testosterone or had cells that lacked androgen receptors. At the Atlanta Games in 1996, one of the few times the I. O. C. allowed detailed   data to be released, seven of the eight women who were found to have a Y chromosome turned out to be androgen insensitive: Their bodies couldn\u2019t use the testosterone they made. Some geneticists speculate that the overrepresentation might be because of a gene on the Y chromosome that increases stature height is clearly beneficial in several sports, though that certainly isn\u2019t a factor for Chand. In court, the I. A. A. F. acknowledged that men\u2019s natural testosterone levels, no matter how high, were not regulated the rationale, it said, was that there was no evidence that men with exceptionally high testosterone have a competitive advantage. Pressed by Chand\u2019s lawyer, the I. A. A. F. also conceded that no research had actually proved that unusually high levels of natural testosterone lead to unusually impressive sports performance in women either. Nor has any study proved that natural testosterone in the \u201cmale range\u201d provides women with a competitive advantage commensurate with the 10 to 12 percent advantage that elite male athletes typically have over elite female athletes in comparable events. In fact, the I. A. A. F.\u2019s own witnesses estimated the performance advantage of women with high testosterone to be between 1 and 3 percent, and the court played down the 3 percent figure, because it was based on limited, unpublished data. Chand\u2019s witnesses also pointed out that researchers had identified more than 200 biological abnormalities that offer specific competitive advantages, among them increased aerobic capacity, resistance to fatigue, exceptionally long limbs, flexible joints, large hands and feet and increased numbers of   muscle fibers  \u2014   all of which make the idea of a level playing field illusory, and not one of which is regulated if it is innate. Bruce Kidd, a former   Olympic runner, told me in May that Olympians themselves sometimes joke that they\u2019re all freaks of nature, with one or another genetic abnormality that makes them great at what they do. Kidd, a Canadian who has long pushed for gender equity in sports, noted that there are also many external variables that influence performance: access to excellent coaching, training facilities, healthy nutrition and so on. \u201cIf athletic officials really want to address the significant factors affecting advantage, they should require all athletes to live in the same place, in the same level of wealth, with access to the same resources,\u201d he says. \u201cBoy, oh, boy, there are so many unfair advantages many Olympians have, starting with who their parents are. \u201d But the I. A. A. F. argued that testosterone is different from other factors, because it is responsible for the performance gap between the sexes. That gap is the very reason sports is divided by sex, the I. A. A. F. says, so regulating testosterone is therefore justified. Chand\u2019s hearing, though, was about more than just testosterone. Implicitly, it questioned the decades of relentless scrutiny of female athletes  \u2014   especially the most successful ones. Veronica Brenner, a Canadian who won a silver medal in freestyle skiing in 2002, told me she first learned that female Olympians had to pass a sex test when she arrived at the \u201998 Games in Nagano, Japan. \u201cI said: \u2018Are you kidding?\u2019 I\u2019d been competing my whole life, and my gender has never been questioned!\u201d Brenner\u2019s test confirmed that she had XX chromosomes, and she was given what was commonly called a \u201cfemininity card\u201d to prove she was the gender she claimed to be. But she was irked that despite the many advances of female athletes in the last   powerful male athletes are celebrated and powerful female ones are suspect. \u201cWe\u2019d hear comments all the time: \u2018She\u2019s really strong  \u2014   she must be part guy. \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d Other critics see testosterone testing as simply the old \u201cgender verification,\u201d the latest effort to keep out women who don\u2019t adhere to gender norms or have a standard female body. Katrina Karkazis, a bioethicist at Stanford University who is a leader of the international campaign against banning intersex athletes and who testified in Chand\u2019s case, says that if an athlete\u2019s androgen test shows she has high testosterone, she must undergo the same gynecological exam that has existed for decades. \u201cThe rationale behind the I. A. A. F.\u2019s \u2018hyperandrogenism regulation\u2019 is to make it sound more scientifically justifiable and less discriminatory, but nothing in those exams has changed from the old policy except the name,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s still based on very rigid binary ideas about sex and gender. \u201d Critics of the I. A. A. F. policy argue that if sports officials were truly concerned about fairness, they would quit policing a handful of women with naturally high testosterone and instead rigorously investigate athletes suspected of taking drugs that indisputably enhance performance. They note that in the last year, the I. A. A. F. has faced bribery and blackmail charges and widespread allegations that it intentionally ignored hundreds of suspicious blood tests. St\u00e9phane Bermon, an I. A. A. F. witness who took part in the efforts to identify females with high testosterone, acknowledged that doping was a significant threat to fairness but said that didn\u2019t negate the need to also regulate the participation of women with naturally high testosterone who may have an advantage. He offered an analogy: \u201cAir pollution, like tobacco smoking, contributes to lung cancer, but one should never have to choose between these two before implementing prevention measures,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cAs a governing body, I. A. A. F. has to do its best to ensure a level playing field. . .. These two topics are different but can lead to the same consequence, which is the impossibility for a dedi cated athlete to compete and succeed against an opponent who benefits from an unfair advantage. \u201d Last July, the Court of Arbitration for Sport issued its ruling in Dutee Chand\u2019s case. The   panel concluded that although natural testosterone may play some role in athleticism, just what that role is, and how influential it is, remains unknown. As a result, the judges said that the I. A. A. F.\u2019s policy was not justified by current scien tific research: \u201cWhile the evidence indicates that higher levels of naturally occurring testosterone may increase athletic performance, the Panel is not satisfied that the degree of that advantage is more significant than the advantage derived from the numerous other variables which the parties acknowledge also affect female athletic performance: for example, nutrition, access to specialist training facilities and coaching and other genetic and biological variations. \u201d The judges concluded that requiring women like Chand to change their bodies in order to compete was unjustifiably discriminatory. The panel sus pended the policy until July 2017 to give the I. A. A. F. time to prove that the degree of competitive advantage conferred by naturally high testosterone in women was comparable to men\u2019s advantage. If the I. A. A. F. doesn\u2019t supply that evidence, the court said, the regulation \u201cshall be declared void. \u201d It was the first time the court had ever overruled a   body\u2019s entire policy. Chand was thrilled. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t just about me,\u201d she said, \u201cbut about all women like me, who come from difficult backgrounds. It is mostly people from poor backgrounds who come into running  \u2014   people who know they will get food, housing, a job, if they run well. Richer people can pay their way to become doctors, engineers poor people don\u2019t even know about their own medical challenges. \u201d Chand hoped that the ruling would prompt the I. O. C. to suspend its testosterone policy, too, so she would be eligible to try to qualify for the Rio Games. After all, the I. O. C. policy  \u2014   which also called on national Olympic committees to \u201cinvestigate any perceived deviation in sex characteristics\u201d  \u2014   was based on the same science that the court deemed inadequate. In November 2015, the I. O. C. established new parameters for dealing with gender. But it never actually addressed whether it would suspend its testosterone policy, as the I. A. A. F. was forced to do. That ambiguity left intersex athletes in limbo. Finally, in late February, the I. O. C. said it would not regulate women\u2019s natural testosterone levels \u201cuntil the issues of the case are resolved. \u201d It urged the I. A. A. F. to come up with the evidence by the court\u2019s deadline so the suspended policy could be resurrected. It also said that to avoid discrimination,   women who are ineligible to compete against women should be eligible to compete against men. Advocates for intersex women were dismayed. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d says Payoshni Mitra, the Indian researcher. \u201cThey say the policy is not for testing gender  \u2014   but saying that a hyperandrogenic woman can compete as a man, not a woman, inherently means they think she really is a man, not a woman. It brings back the debate around an athlete\u2019s gender, publicly humiliating her in the process. \u201d Emmanuelle Moreau, head of media relations for the I. O. C. disagreed, writing in an email, \u201cIt is a question of eligibility, not gender or (biological) sex. \u201d A separate section of the I. O. C. gender guidelines addressed a different group of atypical women (and atypical men): transgender athletes. Unlike the intersex section, the transgender section stresses the importance of human rights, nondiscrimination and inclusion. It eschews most of the I. O. C. \u2019s former requirements, including that trans competitors have their ovaries or testicles removed and undergo surgery so their external genitalia matches their gender identity. In the new guidelines,    athletes face no restrictions of any kind    athletes have some restrictions, including suppressing their testosterone levels below the typi cal male range. And once they\u2019ve declared their gender as female, they can\u2019t change it again for four years if they want to compete in sports. Reactions among trans advocates ran the gamut. Many trans advocates viewed the liberalized regulations as a victory. But some trans women athletes who long ago had their testicles removed (and as a result, make virtually no testosterone) were unhappy with the policy they argued that lifting the surgery requirement gave transwomen who still had   testicles an unfair advantage over trans women who didn\u2019t. And still other advocates said that requiring transwomen to suppress their testosterone below 10 nanomoles is premised on the very same claim about testosterone that the court rejected  \u2014   that naturally made testosterone is the primary cause of men\u2019s competitive advantage over women. Without evidence that \u201cmale range\u201d testosterone levels really do provide that advantage, some say it\u2019s premature to base a policy on speculation  \u2014   especially one that requires people to transform their bodies. In May, the Canadian Center for Ethics in Sports, which manages the country\u2019s antidoping program and recommends ethics standards, issued   guidelines for all Canadian sports organizations. The statement says policies that regulate eligibility, like those related to hormones, should be backed by defensible science. It adds, \u201cThere is simply not the evidence to suggest whether, or to what degree, hormone levels consistently confer competitive advantage. \u201d And yet it\u2019s hard to imagine that many female athletes would easily accept the idea of competing against transwomen athletes without those regulations in place. Those debates are far from Chand\u2019s thoughts. Her focus now is on making the most of the window the ruling provides: allowing her to try to qualify for next month\u2019s Olympics without having to change her body. In the miserable months after her test results were revealed, Chand\u2019s training time and concentration were interrupted, and her hope of ever competing seemed out of reach. Once the ruling was issued, though, she returned to the Indian national team, and intensified her training for the 100 meters, the 200 meters and the   relay. In addition to working out six hours a day, she tries to relax with naps and Facebook. She has made frequent trips to nations holding qualifying competitions. In May, she competed in India, China and Taiwan in June, in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. She has until July 11 to meet the I. O. C. time requirement. She is painfully aware that if she doesn\u2019t make this summer\u2019s Olympics, she may not have an  other chance. The I. A. A. F. may still come up with evidence that satisfies the court and would exclude women like her from competing without altering their bodies. Chand\u2019s best shot to qualify for Rio is in the 100 meters, which she must complete in 11. 32 seconds or less. She remains   of a second short. Note: On June 25, Dutee Chand qualified for the Rio Olympics, running the 100 meters in 11. 30 seconds in Almaty, Kazakhstan, and breaking a national record for India. Later that day, she posted an even faster time of 11. 24 seconds. She will be the first Indian woman to run the 100 meters in the Olympics since 1980.'"}, "time": 1742628351.0846548}
