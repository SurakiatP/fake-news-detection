Those subsidies have helped make home solar affordable and are the best incentive to push the fast-growing energy source to widespread use.\u201d \\nSupport for the measure fell markedly after an audio recording leaked to the public last month in which a lobbyist working for electric companies bragged about the measure to industry insiders. \\nThe Miami Herald/Times , which released the recording, reported : \\nSal Nuzzo, a vice president at the James Madison Institute in Tallahassee, [ . . . ] called the amendment, which has received more than $21 million in utility industry financing, \u201can incredibly savvy maneuver\u201d that \u201cwould completely negate anything they [pro-solar interests] would try to do either legislatively or constitutionally down the road,\u201d according to an audio recording of the event supplied to the Herald/Times . \\nHe offered others a recommendation: \u201cAs you guys look at policy in your state, or constitutional ballot initiatives in your state, remember this: Solar polls very well,\u201d he said. \\n\u201cTo the degree that we can use a little bit of political jiu-jitsu and take what they\u2019re kind of pinning us on and use it to our benefit either in policy, in legislation or in constitutional referendums\u2014if that\u2019s the direction you want to take\u2014use the language of promoting solar, and kind of, kind of put in these protections for consumers that choose not to install rooftop. \\n\u201cI\u2019m discouraged as a citizen how far we have slipped and see Amendment 1 as a means of accelerating that decline in solar in Florida,\u201d Graham said, according to the Miami Herald \\nAnd Graham\u2019s far from the only prominent voice to condemn the measure: \u201cFormer Vice President Al Gore, speaking at a rally for Hillary Clinton, described the amendment as \u2018 phony baloney. \u2018 Carl Hiassen, Florida\u2019s best-known opinion journalist, has called the proposal a \u2018 slick, oily fraud, \u2018 and even the usually apolitical Jimmy Buffett has urged a no vote, noted \\nSuch statements from opponents of the initiative have gone far to quell support, according to a new poll \\nOne of those voters was \u201cBarbara Waks, a retiree who had already mailed in her early-voting ballot when the Herald story appeared. She said that she thought she was supporting renewable energy,\u201d the New York Times reported \\n\u201cI felt so stupid,\u201d she told the Times. \u201cI\u2019m familiar with the political arena and the garbage that exists, but this is beyond the pale. \\nNika Knight is a Common Dreams\""}, "time": 1742628607.3910053}
