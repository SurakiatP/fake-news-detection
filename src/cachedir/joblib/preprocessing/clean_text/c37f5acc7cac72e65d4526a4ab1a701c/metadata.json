He specializes in children\u2019s birthday parties but has the skill set to perform at kindergarten graduations as well. \u201cLeaving the hospital was the best thing I\u2019ve ever done. Can I say that again?\u201d said an elated Dr. Jim Smith. \\nDr. Jim Smith first became interested in becoming a Clown after suffering from extreme burnout. Catalysts included helicopter Moms, antivax Jenny Mccarthy supporters, and the general stress of saving the world. After dealing with one particularly overbearing soccer mom, he stormed out of the office ranting, \u201c**** this noise; I can\u2019t take this horse**** anymore!\u201d and never returned. Using obscenities for the first time felt nothing short of liberating. \\nDr. Jim Smith\u2019s new lifestyle is entirely different from the clinic he used to work at. Previously, he woke up at 6am sharp but now he rolls out of bed in the neighborhood of 11:30am to ensure he is prompt for lunchtime birthday contracts. \u201cI take my responsibilities very seriously,\u201d said Dr. Jim Smith proudly. After a solid hour of challenging work, he practices his Downward Dog poses. \\nIn spite of all the Clown perks, Jim has admittedly taken a rather large pay cut. As a pediatrician, the Doctor made $200,000.00 per year. Now he makes $17,500.00 a year if fully booked and tipped generously. However, Dr. Jim Smith says that eating Ramen noodles with his wife and kids is definitely worth the consistent joy he experiences performing slapstick routines. \u201cFreedom really has no price tag,\u201d said Clown Jim Smith. \\nDr. Jim Smith\u2019s favorite part of the job is showcasing his balloon skills. \u201cEven though the kids cry sometimes, they don\u2019t die,\u201d he stated enthusiastically. Creating these balloon animals has proved to be significantly more meaningful than diagnosing heart defects. \\nDr. Jim Smith sleeps soundly knowing the nurses aren\u2019t \u201chunting (him) down like cattle.\u201d Instead, parents and children alike watch him smile and laugh as if he\u2019s the greatest entertainer in the world. He even gets to wear a red nose! And doing mime is endlessly entertaining and unpredictable too. \\nDr. Jim Smith\u2019s old colleagues have inquired what degree is needed to become a Clown. They\u2019ve also expressed curiosity as to whether it is a high demand skill. \\nDr. Jim Smith\u2019s only regret is that he didn\u2019t become a Clown sooner. 315 Shares '"}, "time": 1742564570.923911}
