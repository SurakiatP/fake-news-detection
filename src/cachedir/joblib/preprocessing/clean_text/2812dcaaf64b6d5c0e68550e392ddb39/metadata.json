Plus I think [FBI Director] Comey had to inform congress of his incomplete testimony to them or else he could be charged with perjury to congress and impeached. \\n*** \\nAny way you look at it, FBI has a black black eye over this. I have been saying for a long time that when you couple secret intelligence agencies with the police, you get a secret police. In German, that\u2019s a GESTAPO (meaning \u201cState Secret Police\u201d). Plus, when you add to that what the DOJ has been doing relative to this, you have a Department of \u201cJust Us.\u201d Not good for the citizens of this or any other country. \\nSimilarly, one of the two reporters who broke the Watergate story \u2013 Carl Bernstein \u2013 said : \\nWe don\u2019t know what this means yet except that it\u2019s a real bombshell . And it is unthinkable that the Director of the FBI would take this action lightly , that he would put this letter forth to the Congress of the United States saying there is more information out there about classified e-mails and call it to the attention of congress unless it was something requiring serious investigation .'"}, "time": 1742562973.0526896}
