Schumer said, \u201cThey need 60 votes. And I believe  \u2014   if Gorsuch keeps it up he\u2019ll have a rough road to hoe to get those 60 on votes. \u201d When asked about the Democrats power, he added, \u201cWe have enough to block to Gorsuch   \u2026     People ask, do the Democrats have power? Are we in charge? No which means we can\u2019t set the agenda, McConnell can do that but we can block a lot of things. Like for instance, the Affordable Care Act which originally everyone wanted to get rid of it. Now when they see what they are getting, 20 million people covered,   conditions  \u2014   a mom or dad has a kid with cancer the insurance companies said we\u2019re not going to cover your kid has cancer. \u201cAnd they watch their kid suffer \u2014   all these things people want. And so, now, people  \u2014  because no Democrat has cooperated with the Republicans from the most liberal like Bernie Sanders to the most conservative like Joe Manchin,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019re stuck. They\u2019re not going to be able to repeal it in my opinion. So we have some power. We have to use it smartly and wisely. We do. And I tell people, I\u2019m ready for the fight. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742564378.114312}
