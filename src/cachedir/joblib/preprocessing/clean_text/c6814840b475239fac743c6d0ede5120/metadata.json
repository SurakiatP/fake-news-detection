Thousands of Cubans bid farewell to Fidel Castro on Monday, filing into a plaza where he often railed against American imperialism. The same morning, the first regularly scheduled flight from the United States in more than 50 years landed in Havana, a potent example of the newly opened doors between the former rivals. But   Donald J. Trump warned on Monday that the push to build ties with Cuba after decades of animosity could quickly be wiped away. \u201cIf Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the   people and the U. S. as a whole, I will terminate deal,\u201d he said on Twitter. Mr. Trump\u2019s message threatened to end one of President Obama\u2019s signature foreign policy initiatives. Mr. Obama\u2019s moves to relax restrictions on commerce, trade and financial transactions with Cuba were never part of a single \u201cdeal,\u201d but rather a decision that engagement with the island nation would bring more change than decades of isolation. \u201cChange is going to come to Cuba,\u201d Mr. Obama said shortly after announcing the thaw in December 2014. \u201cIt has to. \u201d Since then, the number of American visitors to Cuba has risen quickly, with hotels in Havana sometimes being booked nearly a year in advance, often with large American tour groups. Billions of dollars in goods from American stores like Walmart and Best Buy, financed on American credit cards, make their way to Cuba every year, experts estimate. Restaurants, cellphones and the internet have changed the rhythms and expectations of Cuban life. But critics have long attacked Mr. Obama, saying he gave too much to the Cubans too soon, without first demanding that they open up their society and usher in an era of political freedom. Now, after two years of presidential directives by Mr. Obama to strengthen ties with Cuba, and millions of dollars in American investments, a question remains: Can the d\u00e9tente be rolled back? Even some Obama administration officials concede that the thaw is highly vulnerable to reversal because much of it has been accomplished through executive action. Mr. Trump could, for example, order the State Department to review its decision last year to remove Cuba from the list of state sponsors of terrorism, or suspend diplomatic relations that were resumed last summer with the opening of embassies in Havana and Washington. But Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, argued on Monday that Mr. Trump would have a hard time reversing a policy that had already yielded business deals and benefited the people of both countries. There will soon be 110 daily flights from the United States to Cuba, he noted, not to mention the investments by cruise, tour and hotel operators to prepare for those visits. \u201cUnrolling all of that is much more complicated than just the stroke of a pen,\u201d Mr. Earnest said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s just not as simple as one tweet might make it seem. \u201d The Cuban government remained uncharacteristically silent on similar threats Mr. Trump made during the campaign, choosing instead to issue a congratulatory note after his election. But when Mr. Trump takes office, and his words become policy, \u201cthe Cuban government will have to respond, but hopefully with moderation,\u201d said Ricardo Torres, a professor of economics at the University of Havana. Professor Torres said that there was much to be lost if the concessions were reversed, and that Havana would exercise restraint in its dealings with the Trump administration. But Mr. Trump\u2019s antagonistic posture could embolden those in the Cuban government who have always been suspicious of the Americans and were against the warming relations brokered by President Ra\u00fal Castro, Fidel\u2019s brother. \u201cThere\u2019s no question this is a bad start to things,\u201d Professor Torres said as thousands of students streamed by to bid goodbye to Fidel Castro, adding that Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cbelligerent attitude and animosity gives more reasons for suspicion and confirms the belief that this warming of relations wasn\u2019t real. \u201d Mr. Trump has placed Mauricio   a lobbyist who has been a harsh critic of Mr. Obama\u2019s opening to Cuba, on his transition team for the Treasury Department. Under Mr. Obama, the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, which handles sanctions, has issued several rounds of regulations to remove impediments for American companies and individuals seeking to do business with Cuba and to travel there. In an opinion piece in The Miami Herald this month, Mr.   argued that Mr. Obama\u2019s \u201cnew course for Cuba has made a bad situation worse. \u201d Human rights activists have long complained that the Cuban government simply shifted its strategy regarding political prisoners after Mr. Obama\u2019s d\u00e9tente. No longer are Cuban dissidents jailed for prolonged sentences, activists say. Instead, they are now rounded up for a few hours or a few days, according to the Cuban Human Rights and National Reconciliation Commission, which logs every detention. There were 9, 125 detentions from January through October this year, the commission said  \u2014   more than four times as many as in all of 2010. The highest number of arrests, 1, 416, occurred in March, when Mr. Obama made his historic visit to Cuba, becoming the first sitting American president to do so in 88 years. \u201cTo be clear, the   wants to see freedom in Cuba for Cubans,\u201d said Jason Miller, a spokesman for Mr. Trump. Still, Elizardo S\u00e1nchez, who runs the commission, said Mr. Obama\u2019s more open policy had helped more than it had hurt. \u201cThe personal contact that comes from all the travel has a huge impact in terms of fighting propaganda,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a closed society, the door can only be opened a bit at a time. It\u2019s going very slowly, but it\u2019s happening. \u201d Others took Mr. Trump\u2019s words as an assault that threatened to restart the kind of hostilities that the thaw was meant to end. \u201cFor a lot of people, it is an open threat to our sovereignty and history,\u201d said Juan Alejandro Triana, also a professor at the University of Havana. \u201cIf the government of the   threatens these things, we will respond. \u201d And yet, with the loss of Mr. Castro, Cuba\u2019s response would most likely be muted, and easier for the world to ignore. Without their leader, for many, Mr. Trump\u2019s comments seemed reminiscent of the longstanding policy of confrontation between the two nations. \u201cWe don\u2019t have anyone else like him right now,\u201d Randy Calderon, a biology student at Havana University, said of Mr. Castro as he stood in a crowd of thousands paying tribute on university grounds. Inside the law school, where Mr. Castro studied, a small shrine had been set up showing him as a student leader, with posters filled with comments from students, many expressing a desire for Mr. Castro to live forever as the country\u2019s \u201ceternal comandante. \u201d Even Cubans who challenge the ideology of \u201cFidelismo\u201d express support for some of the revolution\u2019s achievements, especially universal health care, and they often call for exactly the kind of hybrid of socialism and capitalism that the recent d\u00e9tente with the United States has expanded. Carlos Alzugaray Treto, a former Cuban diplomat, said the urgency to lock those changes into place had only intensified with Mr. Trump\u2019s victory. \u201cThat type of bullying won\u2019t work with Cuba,\u201d he said. \u201cMr. Trump should remember the main reason President Obama changed the policy and made the agreement with Ra\u00fal Castro: The previous policy had failed. \u201d Financially speaking, the biggest and most immediate impact of reversing d\u00e9tente would be in the travel and hospitality sector in Cuba. The surge in American visitors to Cuba since the easing of travel restrictions has been a boon to hotels, transportation and the restaurant scene in Havana. Reversing some of Mr. Obama\u2019s decisions could be legally difficult. Companies like JetBlue, Starwood and Airbnb have invested millions of dollars in time and resources to enter the Cuban market, and did so with the American government\u2019s blessing. \u201cIn theory, Donald Trump has the ability to reverse almost everything Obama has done,\u201d said Matthew D. Aho, an adviser on Cuba at the New York office of the Akerman law firm. \u201cIn practice, that reversal would be far more complicated from a legal process than most observers realize. \u201d Niuris Ysabel Higueras Mart\u00ednez runs Atelier, a popular restaurant in Havana where Michelle Obama dined with her daughters during the president\u2019s trip this year. Ms. Mart\u00ednez is one of the nearly 500, 000   businesspeople who have entered the work force since the government began loosening employment restrictions in 2008. In 2015, she saw her business increase by 50 percent, she said, the largest rise since she opened in 2010. For the most part, the increase was a result of American visitors, who now make up some 85 percent of her clientele. \u201cIt would be a major blow to us,\u201d Ms. Mart\u00ednez said of Mr. Trump\u2019s threats to reverse the d\u00e9tente. \u201cStill, while we really need the American market, it won\u2019t be the end of the world. We aren\u2019t going to die. \u201d The debate is unfolding amid a fight among influential   who are vying for the  \u2019s ear. On one side are   who advocate clamping down on the relationship and insisting on concessions in exchange for any United States engagement. On the other is a growing group that is pressing for further opening. \u201cHe\u2019s surrounded by people who are only giving him one point of view  \u2014   a very straight,   approach that says we need to go back to the old approach  \u2014   and it would be wise for him to be hearing the other side and the benefits of continuing to engage Cuba,\u201d said Carlos Gutierrez, a Republican former commerce secretary who heads the U. S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s business council on Cuba. \u201cTo just get rid of that strikes me as going well overboard. \u201d After Mr. Castro\u2019s death, he added, Cubans \u201cwould feel like when they needed us most, we turned our backs on them. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562358.7881753}
