Iranians had every right to take over US embassy By Kevin Barrett on November 3, 2016 The \u201cDen of Espionage\u201d \u2013 the former US Embassy whose top floor was a maze of wiring that tapped every phone call in Iran (click HERE to watch The Debate) \\nI think Americans ought to storm and occupy our own NSA, FBI, CIA and Pentagon (as well as the Federal Reserve, CFR, Trilateral Commission, Goldman Sachs and other corporate HQs etc. etc.) just like the Iranian students did to the Den of Espionage in 1979. Does that make me an Iranian stooge or an American patriot? Watch The Debate and make up your own mind. \u2013Kevin Barrett \\nPress TV Debate , featuring Kevin Barrett , Veterans Today Editor \\nThe 13th day of the Iranian calendar month of Aban, which falls on November 3, is known as the Student Day in Iran, marking the National Day of Fight against Global Arrogance. On this day 37 years ago, a group of Iranian university students took over the US embassy in Tehran, which had turned into a center of espionage aimed at overthrowing the Islamic Republic following the country\u2019s Islamic Revolution earlier in 1979. \\nPress TV has spoken to Kevin Barrett, an author and Middle East expert, as well as Maxine Dovere, a journalist and political commentator, to get their take on this issue. \\nBarrett believes the US embassy in Iran was a \u201cCIA station\u201d which was used to \u201crun the country\u201d before the revolution, adding that Iranian students had every right to take it over. \\nHe also said the United States was using its embassy to essentially \u201cdominate\u201d and \u201cexploit\u201d Iran through the puppet government of the Shah whose \u201ctorturers were trained by the CIA.\u201d \\nThe analyst further stated the US is an \u201caggressive imperial power\u201d which has been waging wars of \u201cdisguised aggression\u201d throughout the world. \\nHe also opined that the United States is \u201ctoday\u2019s supreme war criminal\u201d which has been using the word \u201cpreemptive war\u201d to legitimize its \u201cnaked undisguised aggressions\u201d after the \u201cneoconservative-Zionist coup d\u2019\u00e9tat of September 11, 2001.\u201d \\n\u201cThe neoconservatives in particular after their coup d\u2019\u00e9tat on September 11, 2001 made it clear that any country in the world that seeks parity with the United States must be destroyed preemptively and that is essentially the situation we have today as the US Empire is out there crushing the Middle East, destroying all of Israel\u2019s enemies through balkanization, through Oded Yinon Plan to break up these countries into smaller units along ethnic and sectarian lines, getting ready for a war with China and provoking a war with Russia through aggressive actions in Ukraine and through the destruction of Syria and threats against Russia when Russia comes to the defense of Syria,\u201d he said. \\nElsewhere in his remarks, Barrett noted that both US presidential candidates are \u201cquite horrific\u201d in their policies toward the Middle East \u2013 namely Iran. \\nHe also asserted that Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei is \u201cabsolutely right\u201d in saying that he cannot trust the United States and that Tehran has to \u201crethink\u201d the opening it has had towards Washington. \\nAyatollah Khamenei has warned that compromise with the United States will not resolve Iran\u2019s problems as Washington has not set aside its hostilities towards the Iranian nation. \\nMeanwhile the other panelist on Press TV\u2019s program, Maxine Dovere, mentioned that taking over an embassy is not \u201can acceptable diplomatic action\u201d anywhere in the world. \\n\u201cAn embassy is sacred ground for any country in any other country. Having a diplomatic dispute is certainly one of the things that happens in political and diplomatic life but taking over an embassy and holding diplomats hostage is not within the realm of normal political behavior,\u201d she said. \\nAccording to the commentator, the United States and Iran need to come to \u201ca civil understanding\u201d and \u201ca trust,\u201d adding that part of this process is eliminating the shaky foundations that have existed until 2016. \\nElsewhere in her remarks, she dismissed the US election campaign as a \u201cnegative personality cult\u201d which has not concentrated on policy, economics, and foreign relations. \\nShe also said all the important issues that a president eventually has to deal with seem to have gotten lost in this election campaign.
