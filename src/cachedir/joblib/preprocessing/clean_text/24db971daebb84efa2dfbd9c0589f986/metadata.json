President Trump\u2019s latest meeting with a foreign leader, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, went smoothly. They pledged cooperation on trade, investment and border security. And, joined by Ivanka Trump, they met with female executives and announced an initiative to assist women in business. In private talks, Mr. Trudeau was expected to welcome the prospect of renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement, a move that could test his commitment to internationalist principles. _____ 2. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan was greeted with higher approval ratings when he returned home from his weekend golf outing with Mr. Trump in Florida. But there was surprise in the United States as it became clear that the two leaders discussed their response to North Korea\u2019s missile test in full view of diners at Mr. Trump\u2019s    resort, with aides pointing the lights from their smartphones at briefing documents. North Korea claims its launch shows progress toward   capabilities. The National Security Council, normally the president\u2019s main arm to develop foreign policy, is in turmoil from top to bottom. Michael Flynn was said to have resigned as national security adviser following reports that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence over his contacts with Russia. _____ 3. On the homefront, Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for Treasury Secretary, the financier Steven Mnuchin, was confirmed by the Senate. And Republicans are hitting a roadblock in their quest to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d the Affordable Care Act: Constituents upset that there is no plan to replace it have made themselves heard at public meetings in California, Utah and Wisconsin. \u201cI\u2019d be lying to you if I told you it was fun,\u201d said Representative Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, who faced a frustrated crowd on Saturday. _____ 4. Inside Trump Tower, the president\u2019s sons talked to The Times about pressing on with global deals  \u2014   and rebutting waves of criticism over ethical concerns. \u201cHis DNA will always be in the company in a big way,\u201d Eric Trump said during nearly five hours of interviews over two days last week. \u201cHis DNA built the company. His DNA also built us. We\u2019re extensions of him in so many ways. \u201d _____ 5. More harrowing details about the suffering of civilians in the Syrian city of Aleppo: Canisters of chlorine gas, a banned weapon, were dumped on residential areas at least eight times in the final weeks of the battle to retake the city from rebels, Human Rights Watch reported. And a separate analysis drawing on satellite images, security videos, social media and TV footage indicates that Russia, contrary to its repeated claims, bombed a major hospital in the city multiple times. _____ 6. A California dam\u2019s spillway appears to have stabilized, but evacuation orders remain in place for more than 180, 000 people as state authorities try to make emergency repairs before more rains come. Emergency shelters filled with residents while workers and experts swarmed the Oroville Dam, the tallest in the United States. \u201cThe big fear, again, is that potential for catastrophic failure,\u201d one official said. _____ 7. Modern goddesses ruled the Grammys: Adele and Beyonc\u00e9 brought dramatic spectacles. The big story after the show, though, was the   of Beyonc\u00e9 in the top categories. \u201cIt was #GrammysSoWhite come to life,\u201d our critic writes. We rounded up the best and worst of the performances, and here\u2019s the red carpet. _____ 8. The American College of Physicians offers a new way to take care of your lower back pain: Wait it out. Take some aspirin if you really need it. Concerned about the epidemic of opioid addiction, the group says patients should try exercise, acupuncture, massage or yoga before resorting to prescription drugs. _____ 9. The dairy industry wants us to call almond, soy and coconut milk   \u2026     something else. Dairy farmers are calling on Congress to stop makers of increasingly popular   alternatives from labeling them yogurt, milk or cheese, saying consumers could mistakenly equate their nutritional profiles. Our reporter wonders: \u201cWhat about other nondairy products with dairy names? Will milk of magnesia, cocoa butter, cream of wheat and peanut butter have to change their names as well?\u201d _____ 10. Finally, a reminder you may not need: Tomorrow is Valentine\u2019s Day. We\u2019d like to draw your attention to one of our most popular articles ever: \u201cThe 36 Questions That Lead to Love. \u201d In our latest Modern Love podcast, the actor David Oyelowo reads \u201cSeeing the World Through My Wife\u2019s Eyes,\u201d about a man whose spouse helps him cope when he loses his sight. And our \u201cCommitted\u201d series explores the   history of wedding announcements in The Times, with updates on noteworthy couples, milestones like the first gay wedding announcements and some pretty amazing wedding fashions, like those big pouffy \u201980s gowns. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.
