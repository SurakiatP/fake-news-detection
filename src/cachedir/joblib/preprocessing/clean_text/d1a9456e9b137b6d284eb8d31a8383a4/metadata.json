They have heard the mantra \u201cAmerica First\u201d from the new president, divining a Trump doctrine: global cooperation last. Europeans have taken note of Mr. Trump\u2019s denigration of the European Union and his apparent esteem for the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. In Asia and Latin America, leaders have absorbed the deepening possibility that Mr. Trump will deliver on threats to impose punitive tariffs on Mexican and Chinese imports, provoking a trade war that will damage economic growth and eliminate jobs around the world. Some allies are shifting focus to other potential partners for new sources of trade and investment, relationships that could influence political, diplomatic and military ties. Many are looking to China, which has adroitly capitalized on a leadership vacuum in world affairs by offering itself  \u2014   ironies notwithstanding  \u2014   as a champion for global engagement. \u201cWe\u2019ve always said that America is our best friend,\u201d Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the Eurogroup  \u2014   comprising finance ministers from countries sharing the euro currency  \u2014   said in an interview with The New York Times on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this month. \u201cIf that\u2019s no longer the case, if that\u2019s what we need to understand from Donald Trump, then of course Europe will look for new friends. \u201d \u201cChina is a very strong candidate for that,\u201d he added. \u201cThe Chinese involvement in Europe in terms of investment is already very high and expanding. If you push away your friends, you mustn\u2019t be surprised if the friends start looking for new friends. \u201d On Wednesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany spoke by telephone with Premier Li Keqiang of China. \u201cThe two spoke in favor of free trade and a stable world trade order,\u201d a German government spokesman later said in a written statement. The swift reassessment of trade relations  \u2014   a realm in which Mr. Trump is directly threatening the order that has prevailed since the end of World War II  \u2014   only amplifies the potential for a   of the broader geopolitical framework. Mr. Trump has already criticized NATO as obsolete while demanding that member states pay more, calling into question the alliance that has maintained security across much of Europe for more than six decades. He has provoked fears of a clash with China beyond issues of commerce by taking a congratulatory call from the president of Taiwan, the   island that Beijing claims as part of its territory. In shutting American borders to people from predominantly Muslim countries, Mr. Trump risks inflaming tensions with Middle Eastern nations while widening a void with democratic allies over basic values. Through the fractious campaign, weary sophisticates dismissed the extreme talk from the Trump camp as political bluster. Even if he won, he would never follow through on his threats, particularly in trade where his business sensibilities would prevail. But that conventional wisdom looks to be crumbling. First, Mr. Trump delivered on a promise to withdraw from the   Partnership, a trade agreement forged by the Obama administration in part as a counter to China\u2019s growing influence. Then, on Thursday, his administration appeared to embrace a Republican proposal to impose a 20 percent tax on all imported goods while asserting the proceeds would pay for a wall along the Mexican border. Word of the tax emerged as President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico canceled a visit to Washington to protest the promised wall  \u2014   resonating as the potential first salvo in a trade war. \u201cI\u2019m incredibly concerned that the Trump people mean what they say,\u201d said Chad P. Bown, a trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cOne would hope that they are using this as a negotiating tactic. But even if you are, that\u2019s an extraordinarily dangerous game to play, because, right now, the communication to the world is not flowing clearly. \u201d The communication on Thursday came through Mr. Trump\u2019s press secretary, Sean Spicer, who during the administration of George W. Bush, promoted the   magic of free trade as a spokesman for the United States Trade Representative. Pressed to explain how Mr. Trump would force Mexico to pay for the wall, Mr. Spicer said an import tax would do the trick. He soon clarified the tax was merely one option on a crowded buffet table. At a news conference on Friday, Mr. Trump reported having had \u201ca very good call\u201d with the Mexican president. But he did not sound conciliatory. Mexico \u201chas outnegotiated us and beat us to a pulp through our past leaders,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let that happen. \u201d Within the business world, the prospect of substantial tariffs seems so damaging that many assume it will never happen. Three decades ago, Alan Russell, a former commercial airline pilot, set up the Tecma Group of Companies, which runs factory operations for multinationals in Mexico. Today, the company employs some 7, 000 Mexican laborers, most of them in factories clustered around Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. They make components for the automotive, electronics, aerospace and medical device industries. Mr. Trump\u2019s words have provoked fear among the members of Mr. Russell\u2019s work force. \u201cThey hear the administration is going to shut down Nafta and deport everyone, and it scares them,\u201d he said, referring to the North American Free Trade Agreement. But in the end, he said, business will carry on. \u201cIn 31 years, I\u2019ve been through rapid inflation, devaluations, three major recessions, the violence period and multiple presidential administrations, and every year trade has increased,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through worse. Trade is like life itself. It will figure a way. \u201d Most experts have similarly assumed the responsibilities of governance would temper Mr. Trump\u2019s trade posture. Given that nearly   of all American trade is conducted with China and Mexico, a rupture risks severe economic damage. The three countries are intertwined in the global supply chain. China makes components that go into auto parts manufactured in the United States. Those parts are delivered to factories in Mexico that produce finished vehicles sold to Americans. Calling such vehicles Mexican imports misses that much of the value is produced in the United States, employing American labor. \u201cThe idea of trade wars these days, what politicians have in mind is really a   or early   conception of trade,\u201d said Gianmarco I. P. Ottaviano, a trade economist at the London School of Economics. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know who you\u2019re going to hurt with these kind of things. You\u2019re probably going to destroy American jobs in the end. \u201d Mr. Trump owes his office in no small measure to factory workers who have come to view global trade as a mortal threat to their livelihoods. But their sentiments are grounded not in ideology, but in a desire for jobs at decent wages. If Mr. Trump impedes imports, he could put some of these voters out of work. Beyond the economic effects, Mr. Trump\u2019s refashioning of trade has already altered global alignments. In emphasizing \u201cAmerica First,\u201d Mr. Trump has generated a widespread sense that the country is surrendering its global leadership position. Britain\u2019s abandonment of the European Union has enhanced the view that a period of international integration has devolved to a new era in which nationalist concerns are paramount. On Friday, as Mr. Trump hosted British Prime Minister Theresa May, he only increased the sense that he disdains Europe. \u201cBrexit\u2019s going to be a wonderful thing for your country,\u201d he told Ms. May at a news conference, before recounting his frustrations with the union\u2019s bureaucracy. \u201cGetting the approvals from Europe was very, very tough. \u201d With both countries pursuing nationalist aspirations and multilateral institutions seemingly endangered, the world suddenly seems short of responsible supervision. China is working to assume the mantle. President Xi Jinping of China last week used an address in Davos, to submit his nation\u2019s bid as a reliable champion of expanded trade. China does not have free elections. China jails labor organizers, while lavishing credit on   enterprises. All of this makes Mr. Xi an ironic choice as an icon for free trade. Yet Mr. Xi\u2019s speech was so successful that it won the embrace of business people and world leaders alike. At a lunch in Davos two days after Mr. Xi\u2019s address, a   private equity fund manager, Andr\u00e9   stood in a dining room full of more than 100 people and predicted the dawning of a new era. \u201cWe heard a Chinese president becoming the leader of the free world,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742562301.319352}
