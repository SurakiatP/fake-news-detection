As we take a closer look at the 17 voter initiatives on the ballot this November, one of the less prominent measures with a lot of money at stake is Proposition 51. Though it will likely get overshadowed by flashier topics like marijuana and the death penalty, a yes vote would allow the state to issue $9 billion in bonds for school construction projects. Backers have raised more than $9 million to fight for its passage, according to The Sacramento Bee\u2019s Data Tracker. Most of the proceeds from Proposition 51 would go toward upgrading the state\u2019s   buildings, with another $2 billion set aside for community colleges. Those bankrolling the effort are mostly   construction groups that have a profit motive to see it pass. Supporters say the measure comes at a time of dire need. It\u2019s been 10 years since the last statewide school bond measure and many of California\u2019s roughly 10, 000 public schools are outdated and crumbling. A couple weeks ago, for example, a school in Daly City canceled classes after its aging sewer system backed up into the bathrooms. Dozens of school districts, state lawmakers and business groups have endorsed Proposition 51. Last week, the editorial board of The San Francisco Chronicle did too, calling it \u201ca statewide commitment to the success of local schools. \u201d While many opponents acknowledge a need to upgrade infrastructure, they say Proposition 51 is the wrong way to go about it. In February, Gov. Jerry Brown called it a \u201cdevelopers\u2019 $9 billion bond\u201d that would deepen school inequity. The funding process favors schools that apply for projects early, meaning affluent districts with more seasoned administrators could muscle out poorer ones. \u201cIt\u2019s a blunderbuss effort that promotes sprawl and squanders money that would be far better spent in   communities,\u201d Mr. Brown said. Critics argue that local districts are more than capable of issuing bonds of their own for schools and housing developers should shoulder more of the costs. The editorial boards of The Mercury News in San Jose and The San Diego   have opposed the initiative. The bond would cost Californians roughly $8. 6 billion in interest by the time it is paid off in 35 years. They would pay that bill through taxes, reductions in services or both. Californians tend to approve bonds for school upgrades, and a poll conducted in April suggested that they were likely to favor a statewide measure in November. If opponents hope to turn that tide, they have work to do. Want to go deeper? Dive into analyses by the Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office and the League of Women Voters of California.
