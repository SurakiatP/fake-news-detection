Apparently reacting to synthetic marijuana he took days earlier, he bit his girlfriend and tried to jump out of the back seat of the car as the family drove through Georgia toward Florida. About an hour outside Atlanta, at Mile Marker 55 on Interstate 85, his fianc\u00e9e pulled over the car and his mother called the police, hoping they would help calm Mr. Sherman, 32. Less than a   later, Mr. Sherman, who worked at a   parasailing business on the Gulf Coast, was dead. He was stunned numerous times with Taser guns carried by two sheriff\u2019s deputies, while handcuffed in the back seat of a rental car. Like other recent episodes involving the police, this one was captured on video, in this case by body cameras worn by the sheriff\u2019s deputies as they tried to subdue Mr. Sherman. The video, a copy of which was obtained in recent days by The New York Times, is similar to recordings of fatal encounters involving law enforcement officers in Chicago North Charleston, S. C. and Staten Island. Each one depicts in stark terms a response from officers that resulted in a death. In this instance, there are no racial overtones: Both Mr. Sherman and the deputy sheriffs are white. The footage from Georgia was released Friday by prosecutors in Coweta County in response to requests from the family and the news media. It shows the sheriff\u2019s deputies struggling to subdue Mr. Sherman as he tried to get out of the car, stunning him repeatedly with their Taser guns while he was handcuffed, and reacting frantically after realizing he was dead. Mr. Sherman\u2019s death was a homicide due to \u201can altercation with law enforcement with several trigger pulls of an electronic control device,\u201d according to his death certificate, which said that he had been shoved to the floor of the car and that his torso was compressed \u201cby the body weight of another individual. \u201d \u201cHow can they do this when they know someone is having a breakdown?\u201d said L. Chris Stewart, a lawyer for the Sherman family. \u201cOnce they started shocking him, how can someone comply when they\u2019re being electrocuted over and over again?\u201d Kevin and Mary Ann Sherman, Chase Sherman\u2019s parents, said they were not sure what had caused their son\u2019s odd behavior. They said they first became concerned when he began acting erratically while they were in the Dominican Republic for the wedding. Chase told his mother that he had taken the synthetic marijuana the day before they traveled there. \u201cHe was scared when we were down there,\u201d Ms. Sherman said. \u201cHe said he heard different bad things were happening in different countries. He would see a couple of things that weren\u2019t there. He thought people were watching him, and he didn\u2019t want to go anywhere without his mom and dad or brother. \u201d But his parents said he had seemed fine on the flight back to Atlanta, where they were to change planes and continue their trip home to Destin, Fla. Then, as they waited at the Atlanta airport, Mr. Sherman grew agitated. The family decided it would be better to drive the rest of the way, so they rented a car. Not long into the drive, Mr. Sherman began trying to jump out of the car. \u201cI couldn\u2019t keep him in the car  \u2014   he didn\u2019t know where he was and was disoriented,\u201d Kevin Sherman said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t keep him in the car by myself, so we needed to call for medical assistance. \u201d A body camera worn by one of the deputies started recording while en route to assist the Shermans. By the time he reached their car, parked on the shoulder of the highway, another deputy was already grappling with Mr. Sherman, who was handcuffed, in the car\u2019s back seat. On the video, Mr. Sherman seemed alternately calm and desperate to get out of the car. To try to stop him, one of the deputies took out a Taser gun and pointed it at him, telling him to stop moving. Mr. Sherman grabbed the Taser gun, and a fight for it ensued. With Mr. Sherman\u2019s mother and his fianc\u00e9e, Patti Galloway, watching from the front of the car, the deputy shot him several times with the Taser, and the second deputy punched him in the head. The deputies then told the two women to get out of the car, and Ms. Sherman pointed her finger at the two deputies, pleading with them not to stun her son. Mr. Sherman was stunned again, and then he appeared to wrestle away control of the Taser despite still being handcuffed. Moments later, an emergency medical technician who had arrived at the scene tried to help subdue Mr. Sherman. \u201cO. K. I\u2019m dead, I\u2019m dead,\u201d Mr. Sherman said as he was shoved to the floor and wedged between the front and back seats. \u201cI quit, I quit,\u201d he could be heard saying. The medical technician pushed down on Mr. Sherman\u2019s body. \u201cI got all the weight of the world on him now,\u201d he could be heard saying before Mr. Sherman was shocked again. But suddenly realizing that Mr. Sherman was not breathing, the deputy sheriffs and the medical technician pulled him out of the car and began performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation while his parents and Ms. Galloway watched. \u201cThere was no way for him to resist,\u201d said the lawyer, Mr. Stewart. \u201cFor four minutes and 10 seconds after he said \u2018I quit,\u2019 they still tased him and kept him on the ground. That\u2019s torture, and they killed him. \u201d Mr. Sherman\u2019s death was initially investigated by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, which made the evidence it collected available to the district attorney of Coweta County, Peter J. Skandalakis. Mr. Skandalakis said Friday that his office\u2019s investigation into Mr. Sherman\u2019s death was continuing. \u201cI really haven\u2019t formed a final opinion about it,\u201d he said, adding that his office had planned to release the video before the inquiry\u2019s conclusion because of \u201cpublic interest in the case. \u201d He said he hoped to meet eventually with the Sherman family. In the meantime, the deputies who responded to the family\u2019s request for help have not been suspended, according to Mr. Stewart, and are still working.'"}, "time": 1742563095.9335403}
