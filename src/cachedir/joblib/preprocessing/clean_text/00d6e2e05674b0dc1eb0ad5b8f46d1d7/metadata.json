[\u201cIt\u2019s deeply humbling for me to participate in the 172nd commencement in Notre Dame\u2019s 175th year,\u201d Pence said, as students booed, turned their backs, and walked out of the ceremony.   The walkout was organized by the   student group WeStaNDFor, who began planning the protest after Pence was announced as the speaker in March. In a statement, the group said they opposed Pence\u2019s positions on gay rights, his opposition to the Syrian refugee program, and the administration\u2019s crack down on sanctuary cities. One of the persons involved was Bryan Ricketts, the former president of Notre Dame\u2019s student body. Talking to the Indy Star, Ricketts said he was \u201cupset and hurt\u201d by the school\u2019s decision to invite Pence, who was formally the state\u2019s governor, as the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cpolicies have impacted the humanity of certain graduates. \u201d During the speech at the Catholic university, Pence discussed the importance of religious freedom, lauding Donald Trump\u2019s recent executive order protecting religious liberties and freedom of speech. The university\u2019s administrator also praised Pence for his public service to Indiana and his new role as vice president. \u201cAs vice president, Mike Pence has been a voice of balance, reason, and continuity,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has played a critical role in shaping the domestic agenda and traveled the globe to reassure allies and show to foes his steady resolve. Even those who disagree with Mike Pence recognize him as a man of principle. \u201d Earlier this month, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was loudly booed as students turned their backs while she gave the commencement speech at   University.
