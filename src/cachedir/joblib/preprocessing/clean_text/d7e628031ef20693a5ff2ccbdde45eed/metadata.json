[In the wake of MILO\u2019s departure from Breitbart News, a number of instances have come to light where those on the left have discussed or joked openly about pedophilia. Unlike in MILO\u2019s case, the media has been largely silent in response.  1: George Takei, In a 2006 interview on The Howard Stern Show, actor George Takei spoke about being molested by an    camp counselor as a    at summer camp. In the excerpt, what many seem to find most shocking about Takei\u2019s comments is that he insists he wasn\u2019t molested because he found the perpetrator \u201cattractive. \u201d At 2:20 mark @GeorgeTakei promotes pedophilia with 13 year old boys to Howard Stern. #tcot #Milohttps:  .   \u2014   John Cardillo (@johncardillo) February 21, 2017,  George Takei Amazing how this doesn\u2019t trend.  No liberal outrage!  Nothing from #pizzahut or #tacobell,  \u2014   gab.  \ud83d\udc38 (@HillaryNo1sPres) February 22, 2017,  2: Bill Maher, HBO host and comedian Bill Maher can be seen in a clip from 1998 on Maher\u2019s previous TV show Politically Incorrect defending an adult teacher who had sexual relations with her    student. \u201cBasically, they\u2019re having a family and they\u2019re keeping the mother in jail because she won\u2019t conform to the perfect American family,\u201d he says. Later in the clip, Maher asks, \u201cHow can a woman rape a man?\u201d if bill maher thinks sunlight is the best disinfectant then here\u2019s him saying the same shit as milo, that it\u2019s ok for adults to fuck kids pic. twitter.   \u2014   warrior cop (@wyatt_privilege) February 22, 2017,  In 2016 Maher once again defended the relationship between an adult and a minor when he called out \u201csocial justice warriors\u201d for attacking a relationship between singer David Bowie and    Lori Mattix. \u201cIf there\u2019s a victim here, it\u2019s the guy who had to fuck Lori Mattix next,\u201d said Maher. \u201cHow do you follow David Bowie in a kimono?\u201d 3: Roman Polanksi, Roman Polanski, the acclaimed liberal director of films such as Rosemary\u2019s Baby and Chinatown, pled guilty to engaging in unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor after being accused of drugging and raping   old Samantha Geimer in 1977. Polanski fled the United States before he could be sentenced and has been living in France ever since. Since then Hollywood celebrities such as Meryl Streep have openly defended Polanski, with Streep stating that she\u2019s \u201cvery sorry that he\u2019s in jail\u201d and Polanski receiving a standing ovation from Hollywood stars following his Oscar win in absentia for Best Director for The Pianist.  4: Lena Dunham, Lena Dunham, writer and star of HBO TV show Girls, wrote in her memoir Not That Kind Of Girl of inappropriate sexual activity with her younger sister.  Dunham writes in her autobiography of \u201ccasually masturbating\u201d while in bed next to her younger sister and bribing her with \u201cthree pieces of candy if I could kiss her on the lips for five seconds  \u2026     anything a sexual predator might do to woo a small suburban girl I was trying. \u201d Dunham also spoke of touching her sister\u2019s genitals, saying, \u201cGrace was sitting up, babbling and smiling, and I leaned down between her legs and carefully spread open her vagina. She didn\u2019t resist,\u201d Dunham wrote. \u201cThis was within the spectrum of things I did,\u201d she added. Dunham also admitted to sharing the same bed with Grace until she was seventeen, and that sometimes she \u201cslipped my hand into my underwear to figure some stuff out\u201d while sleeping next to her. Rather than experiencing outrage and anger from fans and the media for these actions, Dunham was instead invited to speak at the Democratic National Convention on the topic of women\u2019s rights. At the DNC, Dunham introduced herself saying: \u201cI am a   feminist, sexual assault survivor with a chronic reproductive illness. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563309.231917}
