You see people on telly filling a glass from the tap and drinking it and I want to shout \u2018yuck, put that fucking poison down!\u2019\u2026 you forget that other people don\u2019t have to boil their water, you know?\u201d \\nWWN are speaking to one of the 86,000 and rising people who are currently under a \u2018boil water\u2019 notice, an increase of over double from last year\u2019s 40,000 people living in an area where the water has been deemed unfit for human consumption. \\nWhile Irish Water continue to work hard on whether or not they\u2019re going to get paid, homes across the country continue to receive a supply of water that is above the acceptable EPA levels of pesticides and contaminants, forcing thousands of homes to boil their water before they consume it. \\nBut as we found out, these homes have long since given up any hope of the government sorting out the problem, and have \u2018kinda gotten used to it\u2019. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of like being on holiday, you know the way you\u2019re not supposed to drink from the tap in Lanzarote?\u201d said O\u2019Gravan, enjoying a nice scalding glass of Mi-Wadi. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of like that, except you\u2019re in Roscommon\u201d.'"}, "time": 1742564051.41418}
