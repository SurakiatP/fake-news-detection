For instance, he can withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement, as he has threatened to do, by simply notifying the U.S.\u2019 Nafta partners, Mexico and Canada, and waiting six months. Withdrawing from the World Trade Organization, which sets rules for global trading and enforces tariffs, has a similar provision\u201d [ Wall Street Journal , \u201cDonald Trump Will Need to Leverage Size, Power of U.S. Economy to Remake Global Trading System\u201d]. \u201c\u2018Our major trading partners are far more likely to cooperate with an America resolute about balancing its trade than they are likely to provoke a trade war,\u2019 wrote Trump economic advisers Peter Navarro [ here ] of the University of California-Irvine and investor Wilbur Ross in September. \u2018This is true for one very simple reason: America\u2019s major trading partners are far more dependent on American markets than America is on their markets.'\u201d \\nTPP: \u201cTo take effect, TPP must be ratified by February 2018 by at least six countries that account for 85 percent of the 12 members\u2019 aggregate economic output. This effectively means that the U.S. and Japan, the world\u2019s third-largest economy and the second-largest that is a signatory nation, must both be on board\u201d [ DC Velocity ]. \\nTPP: \u201cMr. Trump\u2019s win also seals the fate of President Barack Obama\u2019s 12-nation trade agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP. The president-elect blamed the TPP on special interests who want to \u201crape\u201d the country\u201d [ Wall Street Journal , \u201cDonald Trump Win to Upend Trade Policy\u201d]. \u201cMr. Obama had hoped to work with Republican lawmakers to pass the TPP during the \u2018lame duck\u2019 session of Congress after the election, where they faced an uphill battle even if Tuesday\u2019s vote had favored Hillary Clinton, who previously backed the TPP negotiations. Now Republicans have little incentive to bring the TPP to a vote, since Mr. Trump could easily threaten to unravel the deal when he takes office and block its implementation, as well as punish lawmakers who vote for it.\u201d \\nTPP: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s historic victory Tuesday has killed any chance of Congress voting on President Barack Obama\u2019s signature Asia-Pacific trade agreement while raising the odds of a damaging trade confrontation with China \u2014 just two ways a Trump presidency could upend the global trading system and usher in a new era of U.S. protectionism, analysts say\u201d [ Politico ]. \u201c\u2018This is the end of globalization is we knew it \u2026 because what the U.S. is going to do is certainly going to impact other countries\u2019 and their decisions on negotiations,\u2019 Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told Politico. \u2018TPP is now in the history dustbin for sure,\u2019 Hufbauer said.\u201d \\nTPP: \u201cHouse GOP election outcomes will be key as House Speaker Paul Ryan decides whether to bring the TPP to a vote in the lame-duck session with GOP voters strongly against and the GOP \u2018s high-donor base demanding action. With an eye to conservative GOP threats to withhold support for his speakership and a possible 2020 presidential run, Ryan\u2019s decision is complicated. Whether the TPP will get a lame-duck vote is his call. Beyond whether he can muster the votes of representatives who weathered the wrath of trade voters in this cycle and worry about the 2018 primaries lies the longer-term implications of his even trying to do so with the GOP voter base so intensely against the pact\u201d [Lori Wallach, Eyes on Trade ]. \\n2016 \\nThe Rending of Garments and Gnashing of Teeth \\n\u201cPeople\u2019s net worth has been crippled, if you were directly, in a 401K, through a mutual fund, or through a pension, invested in capital markets\u201d [TeacherKen, Daily Kos ]. Bathos. \\nMoney \\n\u201cAllies on the ground complained for weeks that they weren\u2019t getting the resources they needed\u201d [ The Hill ]. \u201c\u2018The big question is \u2018How much money did you spend? And what\u2019s left in the bank?\u2019 said one Clinton surrogate. \u2018Because there were states like Michigan that kept sounding the alarm and no one was taking it seriously until the very end. They never really got everything they wanted.\u2019\u2026\u201cRuss Feingold sent a flare up and said \u2018I need help,\u2019 [Democratic strategist Jim Manley] said, but it went largely ignored.\u201d Huh? Clinton spent the month of August fundraising. The Clinton Victory Fund scam turned the state parties into a money laundries for cash passed through to the Clinton campaign. Clinton raised $154 million in September for her campaign and the party. And people \u201cgetting the resources they needed\u201d? Seems odd. \\nPolicy \\n\u201cMajority Leader Mitch McConnell signaled the Senate would move swiftly to repeal Obamacare now that the GOP Congress will have a Republican president next year\u201d [ Politico ]. \\nPolling Debacle \\n\u201cWhile the [Trump] campaign had expressed confidence in public, their own data showed only a narrow path to the 270 electorates needed to win the White House\u201d [ NBC ]. And: \u201cRNC staffers thought Trump would win 240 Electoral College votes, 30 short of the 270 needed to win. They cautioned reporters that these numbers could change. And it was noteworthy that their projections were more optimistic than much of the public polling. But Trump was down 2 points in Florida, down 2 points in Iowa, down 2 points in New Hampshire and down 3 points in Wisconsin. Trump won Florida, won Iowa, won Wisconsin, and as of the publishing of this story was in a tight race for New Hampshire\u201d [ Yahoo News ]. Which, interestingly, is what I kept saying. When I cut through the triumphalism and looked at the polling, and threw those numbers against the \u201cpaths to victory,\u201d it was always (except for one week) a horse race. So I seem to have channeled the Trump team\u2019s thinking on the data. It\u2019s been an interesting year, and I\u2019ll critique my approach tomorrow. An interesting data point: \u201cThe best data inside the Trump campaign was just as pessimistic. Even the most optimistic models run by Cambridge Analytica for Trump showed him losing. But as Cambridge\u2019s Matt Oczkowski tweeted late Tuesday, Trump\u2019s support and turnout among rural voters was 10 percentage points higher than they had expected .\u201d Ten points is rather a lot. \\n\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s win was predicted by Allan Lichtman \u2014 the US election expert who has called every result since 1984\u201d [ Independent ]. \u201c\u2018[The 13 keys method] is a historically based prediction system. I derived the system by looking at every American presidential election from 1860 to 1980,\u2019 Professor Lichtman has said.\u201d And: \u201cLichtman believes election analysts err by studying campaign as a series of battlefields \u2014 northern versus southern Florida, western versus eastern Pennsylvania, and so on. He prefers likening it to dominoes, toppling one way or the other. He says U.S. campaigns are contests of momentum. In the early 1980s, he and a colleague examined election results dating back to the Civil War and found a pattern. They drew up 13 true-false statements, and if the answer to six or more was \u201dFalse,\u201d the incumbent party always lost the White House\u201d [ HuffPo ]. And: \u201cLICHTMAN: I don\u2019t call [the 13 keys] data-driven. I have no problem with data. My prediction system is based on a huge amount of data, you know. But I do object to poll-and-pundit-driven analysis, which is not meaningful because it\u2019s not based on any kind of systematic assessment of how elections work\u201d [ NPR ]. \\n\u201cI Answer Your Questions About Predicting President Trump\u201d [ Scott Adams Blog ]. \u201cClinton\u2019s team of cognitive scientists and professional persuaders did a terrific job of framing Trump as scary. The illusion will wear off \u2013 albeit slowly \u2013 as you observe Trump going about the job of President and taking it seriously. You can expect him to adjust his tone and language going forward. You can expect foreign leaders to say they can work with him. You can expect him to focus on unifying an exhausted and nervous country. And you can expect him to succeed in doing so. (He\u2019s persuasive.) Watch as Trump turns to healing. You\u2019re going to be surprised how well he does it. But give it time.\u201d Scott Adams is looking pretty good right now. But is he only as good as his last trade? \\n\u201cSilver is just guessing. And, in the run-up to this election, he made so many guesses that at least one of them has to be correct\u201d [ WaPo ]. \\nDownballot \\n\u201cThe 2018 election cycle has started and Republicans find themselves in an interesting place. On the one hand, the tables are turned as they will get to play offense. There are 33 races in 2018 and Democrats will defend 25 of those seats while Republicans will defend just eight of them\u201d [ Cook Political Report ]. \\nThe Voters \\nAnecdotes but well-chosen: \u201cIt was never enough to say that the Trump phenomenon rested only on whites without a college degree. They were part of Trump\u2019s surprise, but not all of it. The real shocks were the fence-sitters, the late-breakers, the Bush-family types, and the suburban women. They would, we were so often told, recoil from Trump. Outside the Silverbrook Elementary School, a polling station in the affluent community of Fairfax Station, I encountered Jaclyn Miller, a genial tax accountant in her mid-thirties. I asked how she voted. She winced and laughed. \u2018I voted for Trump, begrudgingly,\u2019 she said\u201d [ The New Yorker ]. \u201c\u2018It was the lesser of two evils, in my mind. I\u2019m definitely a fiscal conservative, and the corruption and everything from Hillary, just, I couldn\u2019t do it,\u2019 she said. \u201cShe\u2019s not trustworthy.\u2019 The \u2018Access Hollywood\u2019 tape did not matter much to her. After all, she said, Bill Clinton was \u2018with an intern in the Oval Office.; Of Trump, she added, \u2018I\u2019m sure there\u2019s things that I\u2019ve said that I would never want public.\u2019 Miller went on, \u2018A couple weeks ago, I had decided, at that moment, that I was going third party. And I really wish that there was a valid third-party option. I think a lot of Americans don\u2019t fall into one category.'\u201d Amen to that last comment. \\n\u201cThe Democratic Party Deserved To Die\u201d [Krystal Ball, HuffPo ]. \u201cWell, those jobs are actually gone for good, we knowingly told them. And we offered a fantastical non-solution. We will retrain you for good jobs! Never mind that these \u2018good jobs\u2019 didn\u2019t exist in East Kentucky or Cleveland. And as a final insult, we lectured a struggling people watching their kids die of drug overdoses about their white privilege. Can you blame them for calling bullshit? \u201d \\n\u201cThe \u2018Deplorables\u2019 Got the Last Laugh\u201d [David Dayen, The New Republic ]. \u201c[T]he lesson for Democrats is ultimately clear enough: You cannot write off half the country, much less spend an election cycle deriding it, and expect success.\u201d \\n\u201cDespite the unexpected triumph of Donald Trump, Democratic state legislative candidates held their own Tuesday in their efforts to close the gap on Republicans in the nation\u2019s statehouses\u201d [ RealClearPolitics ]. But: \u201cOverall, after netting more than 800 state legislative seats during the Obama years, Republicans are hugely dominant in the nation\u2019s statehouses, controlling 66 of the nation\u2019s 98 partisan legislative chambers. Democrats control 30. There are two ties, pending the outcome in the New York Senate. (Nebraska has a nominally non-partisan unicameral legislature.) \u201d \\nOur Famously Free Press \\n\u201cBut I\u2019ve come to think that the rise of fake news \u2014 and of the cheap-to-run, ideologically driven aggregator sites that are only a few steps up from fake \u2014 has weaponized those filter bubbles. There were just too many people voting in this election because they were infuriated by made-up things they read online\u201d [ Nieman Labs ]. Dunno about that (see below). But this rings true: \u201cOne thread running through the countless profiles of Trump voters this cycle was the loss of community institutions. The factories shut down; the church pews were emptier than they used to be; the braided fabric of their towns had unraveled. Don\u2019t forget that, particularly in smaller communities, the local newspaper was one of those key institutions \u2014 the daily or weekly package of stories that connected you to your neighbors.\u201d \\n\u201cFacebook\u2019s algorithm and whatever \u2018echo chamber\u2019 or \u2018filter bubble\u2019 or whatever it may have created did not lead to this result. This was the result of a very large group of people who are quite clearly \u2014 and reasonably \u2014 pissed off at the status quo\u2026. This was a \u201cthrow the bums out\u201d vote, and many of the bums deserved to be thrown out\u201d [ Tech Dirt ]. \u201cBut that\u2019s not Facebook\u2019s fault. And the idea that a better or different algorithm on Facebook would have made the results any different is just as ridiculous as the idea that newspaper endorsements or \u2018fact checking\u2019 mattered one bit. People are angry because the system has failed them in many, many ways, and it\u2019s not because they\u2019re idiots who believed all the fake news Facebook pushed on them (even if some of them did believe it). Many people don\u2019t think Trump will be any good, but they voted for him anyway, because the status quo is broken.\u201d \\nLegitimacy \\nTrump meets with Obama: \u201c\u2018We discussed a lot of different situations, some wonderful and some difficulties. I very much look forward to dealing with the president in the future, including counsel,\u2019 Trump said. \u2018Mr. President, it was a great honor meeting with you. And I look forward to meeting with you many, many more times in the future'\u201d [Olivier Knox, Yahoo News ]. \\nSanders: \u201cTo the degree that Mr. Trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country, I and other progressives are prepared to work with him. To the degree that he pursues racist, sexist, xenophobic, and anti-environment policies, we will vigorously oppose him\u201d [ Variety ]. \\n\u201cSupreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg appeared to be wearing her infamous \u201cdissent jabot\u201d on the bench Wednesday morning. The move is being widely interpreted as a repudiation of Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the presidential election a night earlier\u201d [ The Hill ]. \u201cGinsburg typically wears the collar when issuing dissenting opinions in the court, as she explained to Yahoo News in 2014. But no opinions were read Wednesday.\u201d This isn\u2019t like Kremlinology. It is Kremlinology. \\n\u201cThe audience for our glib analysis and contempt for much of the electorate, it turned out, was rather limited. This was particularly true when it came to voters, the ones who turned out by the millions to deliver not only a rebuke to the political system but also the people who cover it. Trump knew what he was doing when he invited his crowds to jeer and hiss the reporters covering him. They hate us, and have for some time\u201d [ CBS ]. \u201cWhat\u2019s worse, we don\u2019t make much of an effort to really understand, and with too few exceptions, treat the economic grievances of Middle America like they\u2019re some sort of punchline. Sometimes quite literally so, such as when reporters tweet out a photo of racist-looking Trump supporters and jokingly suggest that they must be upset about free trade or low wages.\u201d Yglesias being a prime offender. \\n\u201cMy mom-in-law was watching CBS all night, so that\u2019s what we watched. All the pundits/anchors spoke in the hushed tones of a funeral. For two hours, the only images of campaign workers shown were the sad faces of Clinton supporters; not one image of jubilant Trump supporters was broadcast until Trump gave his acceptance speech\u201d [ Of Two Minds ]. \u201cWhen one of the talking heads noted that Hillary never generated the enthusiasm of the Sanders or Trump campaigns, his comment was followed by a stony silence. That he had given voice to a self-evident truth was not welcome. \\n\u201cThe White House on Wednesday refused to rule out the possibility that Obama would pardon Clinton to prevent Trump from prosecuting her when he takes office\u201d [ The Hill ]. And: \u201c\u2018There are deep and disturbing issues there,\u2019 [Rudy] Giuliani, a top Donald Trump adviser and former federal prosecutor, said Thursday on Fox News\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends,\u2019 citing the Clinton Foundation. \u2018That\u2019s why I don\u2019t think President Obama should pardon her,\u2019 Giuliani added. \u2018I think President Obama should leave it to the system that we all believe in to determine is she innocent or is she guilty?'\u201d \\n\u201cWithin a few weeks of winning the White House, President-elect Donald Trump could face another group of U.S. citizens, a federal jury in California, courtesy of a lawsuit by former students of his now-defunct Trump University who claim they were defrauded by a series of real-estate seminars\u201d [ Reuters ]. \\nStats Watch \\nJobless Claims, week of November 5, 2016: \u201cEmployers are holding tightly onto their employees as jobless claims remain steady at or near record lows\u201d [ Econoday ].

That was the fewest job gains to kick off the holiday hiring season since 2012\u201d [ Econintersect ]. \\nBloomberg Consumer Comfort Index, week of November 6, 2016: \u201cThe consumer comfort index, at 45.1 in the November 6 week, is accelerating\u201d [ Econoday ]. \u201cStrength in consumer confidence is tied closely to strength in the labor market. \u201d \\nShipping: \u201c[\u201cSmart containers\u201d] can be tracked, managed and monitored remotely using special hardware such as relay antennas which allows the lines to collect, store and analyse data even while the ship is in high seas.. Based on this data, lines can take relevant remedial action where required, especially with regards to reefer cargo\u201d [ Shipping & Freight Resource ]. \u201cIn a lot of the cases digital technology has become a USP (Unique Selling Proposition) and shipping lines while competing on price have also started competing on ease of UX (User Experience) and through this have managed to transfer a lot of the work from their desks to the customers desks\u2026. Of course there are humans involved in these processes in the background, but the fact remains that in a lot of the cases you don\u2019t have any visible human interaction as the system takes care of everything.\u201d \\nShipping: \u201cCargo transportation by sea in 2015 saw its slowest rate of growth since 2009 amid the prolonged slowdown in global trade.Figures from the UN Conference on Trade and Development indicated that seaborne shipping had risen 2.1% year on year to exceed 10bn tons\u201d [ Lloyd\u2019s List ]. \\nThe Bezzle: \u201d Yahoo describes massive data breach, doesn\u2019t explain two-year disclosure gap\u201d [ FCPA Blog ]. \u201cYahoo said in a securities filing Wednesday that employees knew in late 2014 a state-sponsored hacker entered its network and stole names, birth dates, and encrypted passwords for more than 500 million accounts\u2026 Wednesday\u2019s disclosure didn\u2019t say which employees knew about the attack or who they informed. Yahoo first disclosed the 2014 data breach in September this year. The board is now investigating the attack with the help of forensic experts, Yahoo said Wednesday. The company didn\u2019t say when the board first learned about the attack or which executives, if any, knew about the attack when it happened. Yahoo disclosed the attack in September, two months after entering into an agreement to sell itself to Verizon for $4.8 billion.\u201d \\nThe Bezzle: \u201c\u030cRepublican Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the U.S. presidential race puts a new rule on retirement advice in limbo, even after Wall Street\u2019s biggest wealth management firms have spent millions preparing for it, lawyers and analysts said this week. The U.S. Department of Labor fiduciary rule, which is set to start taking effect in April, is meant to promote the best interests of retirement savers by eliminating conflicts of interest for brokers\u201d [ Reuters ]. \u201cOn the campaign trail, Trump has said that \u201970 percent of regulations can go,\u2019 and an adviser, Anthony Scaramucci [ here ], told Reuters the fiduciary rule \u2018would likely be stopped.'\u201d \\nThe Bezzle: \u201cWe decided to examine the descriptions of [thousands of companies that received venture capital investment since 2010] to get a better look into the ever-changing startup landscape.

By and large, startup descriptions are tech-heavy, featuring words like \u2018app,\u2019\u2018cloud,\u2019 and \u2018network.\u2019 Our data also shows that no word has seen a bigger jump in usage than \u2018virtual reality\u2019 and no word a bigger decline than \u2018electronics.'\u201d \\nPolitical Risk: \u201c\u2018The rapid rise of political and social populism and accelerating global migration are causes of concern,\u2019 [AG CEO Joe] Kaeser said.

It imposes a huge cost on a species, and that cost is called \u201cmales.\u201d If roughly 50 percent of a species is made up of males who are incapable of producing babies, it is at a serious reproductive disadvantage relative to another species made up mostly of females capable of reproducing on their own\u201d [ Nautilus ]. \u201cDespite its drawbacks, sex does seem to offer a species an incontrovertible advantage.
