We are of course referring to the love shared between local man Graham Kenny and the sound of his own voice. \\nKenny, 37, admits that it was \u2018love at first hearing\u2019 when he learned how to talk over three decades ago, and the love he has for his own opinions, bravado and general nonsense grows stronger each and every year. \\nThe pair spend a lot of time socialising with Kenny\u2019s friends, who have admitted that they while Graham is alright in small doses, when he\u2019s out with his voice the pair can be \u2018quite obnoxious\u2019. \\n\u201cLike any overbearing couple, when Graham and his voice get going, you don\u2019t know where to look,\u201d said one of Mr. Kenny\u2019s co-workers. \\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be there, making everyone feel uncomfortable, completely unaware of how overbearing and embarrassing they\u2019re being. If you could have one without the other, that\u2019d be great. Unfortunately, where one goes, the other is always there\u201d. \\nThe love affair between Kenny and the sound of his own voice has shown no signs of slowing down, with many expecting a marriage announcement any day now.'"}, "time": 1742561776.962521}
