Pat McCrory of North Carolina said Monday that an urgent rescue effort was underway in Lumberton, where a levee breach in the wake of Hurricane Matthew forced people to their rooftops. \u25a0 The storm\u2019s death toll in the United States has climbed to about two dozen, and with some residents still missing, that number could rise. Officials said it could be days before they are sure of the figures. \u25a0 The toll in Haiti, which took a direct hit, has been hard to measure. As many as 1, 000 people have died, according to a Reuters report based on information from civil protection and local officials. Along with hundreds of lives, the storm wiped out much of the progress that an isolated city, J\u00e9r\u00e9mie, had been making. Read more from Azam Ahmed \u00bb \u25a0 Bands of heavy rain produced   flooding in parts of eastern North Carolina, according to the National Hurricane Center, resulting in   flooding and flash flooding across the region. Governor McCrory, addressing reporters in Raleigh on Monday, said a levee breach before dawn had endangered about 1, 500 residents in Lumberton. \u201cFloodwaters are rising very quickly,\u201d said Mr. McCrory, who added that water was   in many places. \u201cWe do have people on the roofs as we speak, and we have a lot of helicopters and boats that have been deployed that are, at this point in time, rescuing them. \u201d Mr. McCrory also reported 10 fatalities in North Carolina, raising Hurricane Matthew\u2019s death toll in the United States to at least 21. At least 1, 400 people have been rescued since Hurricane Matthew struck the state.  \u2014   ALAN BLINDER A federal judge on Monday extended Florida\u2019s voter registration deadline by one day, delivering a quick legal victory to Democrats who argued that the storm had upended plans to draw more people into the political process in one of the nation\u2019s most closely contested states. In a harshly worded ruling, Judge Mark E. Walker of the Federal District Court in Tallahassee said residents would be allowed to join the voter rolls until 5 p. m. Wednesday. \u201cThis case pits the fundamental right to vote against administrative convenience,\u201d Judge Walker wrote. \u201cOf course, the State of Florida has the ability to set its own deadlines and has an interest in maintaining those deadlines. But it would be nonsensical to prioritize those deadlines over the right to vote, especially given the circumstances here. \u201d Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican and one of the named defendants in the lawsuit, has resisted calls from Democrats that he extend the voter registration period, which was scheduled to end on Tuesday. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.  \u2014   ALAN BLINDER Several rivers in eastern North Carolina broke out of their banks on Monday, after weekend rainfalls of up to 16 inches in places, the National Weather Service reported. Some rivers reached record heights, while on others, waters are expected to keep rising for days in some areas, as the floods move downstream. The Cape Fear River south of Fayetteville crested Monday at more than 26 feet above flood stage farther downstream, near Chinquapin, the same river was forecast to rise into Wednesday. To the northeast, the Neuse River reached more than 8 feet above flood stage near Goldsboro on Monday, and was projected to rise another 2 feet, peaking on Tuesday near its record. Downstream, near Kinston, the Neuse rose more than 7 feet above flood stage, and was expected to climb 5 feet more, not cresting until Saturday. The Lumber River at Lumberton rose 4 feet higher than it had ever been measured before. The Little River at Manchester broke its previous record by 3 feet. Several South Carolina rivers also reached moderate or major flood stage, the Weather Service reported, but conditions there were not as severe.  \u2014   RICHARD   Storm surge and battering waves can devastate coastal beaches and the dunes behind them. So when Hurricane Matthew raked the coasts of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina, it carved away some beaches  \u2014   though it left others relatively untouched. Brevard County, Fla. home to Cocoa Beach, the Kennedy Space Center and other famous tourist attractions, lost about one million cubic yards of sand from the county\u2019s 72 miles of beaches, said Virginia Barker, the county\u2019s natural resources management director. While the number is large, the damage was less than that caused by Hurricane Sandy, or the storms that passed through in 2004 and 2005. Matthew \u201cwas more of a glancing blow,\u201d she said. It helped that the storm hit at a very low spot in the tide cycle, she said, and that the storm moved quickly. Also, she said, it was especially fortunate that \u201cour beaches were in really good shape before the storm,\u201d with beach and dune replenishment programs in place since 2000. \u201cWe talk about them being \u2018sacrificial sands,\u2019\u201d she said, a kind of environmental crumple zone to blunt storm damage. Farther north, many shorelines were reshaped by the storm after a helicopter tour, Gov. Rick Scott told reporters in Jacksonville that he had seen \u201can unbelievable amount of beach erosion,\u201d but that the state was \u201cblessed\u201d that Matthew stayed offshore. Environmental officials in states farther north said their coastal evaluations were still underway.   Craft, a spokeswoman for the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control, said that early reports indicated \u201cerosion is rather extensive throughout the coast,\u201d and that many state beaches \u201cwere already experiencing significant sand deficits and chronic erosion. \u201d The state had been working on replenishment projects. Since the storm, the agency has also collaborated with local governments and citizens to post reports through its MyCoast app, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has posted aerial photos.  \u2014   JOHN SCHWARTZ \u201cReturning residents are encouraged to exercise patience and expect lengthy travel times, blocked roadways and detours back to evacuated areas and are asked not to drive around barricades or use emergency lanes that are needed for first responders,\u201d the governor\u2019s office said in a statement. The authorities in South Carolina have attributed three deaths to the storm, including two in Florence County, northwest of Myrtle Beach.  \u2014   JESS BIDGOOD, in Charleston The American Red Cross has published a list of safety tips for homeowners returning to property damaged in hurricanes. Once cleanup begins, taking photographs of damaged or destroyed property before it is discarded provides a record for use in making insurance claims, says Ann Carrns, who writes the Your Money Adviser consumer finance column for The Times. In Haiti, the Bahamas and Florida, the storm left behind stories of disaster and of disaster narrowly averted. Here are some of them \u00bb On Monday, Matthew broke up and headed northeast into the North Atlantic as a diffuse   system, passing the northeastern United States, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. After dropping some rain on the Northeast, it pushed out to sea with   winds and heavy seas, but continued to weaken.'"}, "time": 1742628506.8681343}
