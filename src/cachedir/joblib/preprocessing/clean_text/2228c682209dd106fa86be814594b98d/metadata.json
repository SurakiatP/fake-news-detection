And hubris is a notoriously positive trait with no negative consequences. That must be why Hillary Clinton is down in the polls and facing yet another investigation while feuding with the FBI. \\nCops and firefighters were blown away by Clinton\u2019s hubris in planning the fireworks display, which would eclipse the shower of blazing sparkles that preceded the balloon drop at July\u2019s Democratic National Convention. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little presumptuous of her to plan on winning. I guess she put in for this before Friday,\u201d one NYPD detective said. \\nOthers said the actual election results could put a damper on things, but one firefighter raised the specter of a 2000-style recount and added, \u201cSo what\u2019s she going to do, put the fireworks on ice?\u201d \\nThe arrogance is truly unchecked.'"}, "time": 1742628411.087539}
