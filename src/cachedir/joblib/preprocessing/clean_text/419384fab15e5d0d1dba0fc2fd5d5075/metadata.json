This is just one man\u2019s account, and for all we know, Melker could have made the whole thing up. But Melker\u2019s account doesn\u2019t come across as exaggerated, the alleged interaction, while disturbing, seems very understated. \\nAnd here\u2019s what we do know about Trump. \\nHe has bragged on video about how he felt his \u201cstar\u201d status gave him permission to routinely sexually assault random women by kissing them and grabbing their genitalia against their will. \\nTrump has also been accused of committing numerous sexual assaults against women, including raping two young teenage girls. \\nAnd according to his first wife, Trump did not have the best of relationships with his three oldest children. During a benefit a few weeks ago, Ivana Trump told the crowd that she \u201cbrought up the children singlehandedly. Donald wasn\u2019t really interested in children until he could talk business with them.\u201d \\nWith so many deep character flaws, it\u2019s not exactly a stretch of the imagination that he would physically lash out as well. \\nIf this story turns out to be true, it could explain a lot about why Trump\u2019s two oldest sons are the way they are, and it could foretell a very troubling future for Trump\u2019s youngest son Barron, who is only 10 years old. \\nFeatured image via YouTube /Alex Wong/Getty Images) Share this Article!'"}, "time": 1742563563.7331853}
