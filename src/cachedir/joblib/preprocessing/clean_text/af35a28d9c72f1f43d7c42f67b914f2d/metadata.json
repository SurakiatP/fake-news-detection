[The shooter, an outspoken Bernie Sanders supporter and activist for liberal causes, wounded five people, including House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, who remains in critical condition following multiple surgeries.  \u201cWe encourage everyone to keep Rep. Scalise in your prayers for a speedy recovery and the other victims,\u201d Debbie Dooley of Main Street Patriots, organizer of the rally, told Breitbart News. \u201cWe will have a moment of silence at the protest to pray for the victims of the leftist assassin. \u201d The gunman,    James T. Hodgkinson of Illinois, died from his injuries after Capitol Police on security detail for Scalise engaged him in a gun battle. Organizers of Saturday\u2019s event say they want to show support not only for President Donald Trump but now for Republicans  \u2014   like Scalise, a longtime Trump supporter  \u2014   and speak out against the \u201c  rhetoric\u201d and fake news from CNN and other media outlets.  \u201cI am very encouraged by the interest in the CNN fake news protest,\u201d Dooley told Breitbart News. \u201c I\u2019ve noticed a big uptick in the intensity level of folks interested in attending the protest after the cowardly assassination attempt of Republican Congressmen by someone on the radical left in Alexandria, Virginia on Wednesday. \u201d Dooley said she is not concerned about the safety of protesters. \u201cOne big reason is that Georgia is an open carry state and violent thugs would be insane to attempt violence at our peaceful protest,\u201d Dooley said. \u201cThis hate filled rhetoric against President Trump has permeated many media outlets like CNN, the Washington Post and the New York Times,\u201d Dooley said. \u201cSome of CNN\u2019s hosts engage in   hysteria in their attempt to bring down the   President of the United States. \u201d \u201cThey helped create the toxic atmosphere that Hodgkinson would believe it is \u2018open season\u2019 on Republicans,\u201d Dooley said. \u201cIt is time for Trump supporters to rise up and say with a loud voice, enough. \u201d Bikers for Trump 2020 will also take part in the protest. \u201cBikers for Trump will be at CNN headquarters on Saturday because in our opinion there is no way to measure this level of journalistic malpractice,\u201d Founder Chris Cox told Breitbart News. \u201cCNN exemplifies vigilante journalism. \u201d Tim Selaty, president of Citizens for Trump, will also bring supporters to Saturday\u2019s rally. \u201cWe the American citizenry, who dutifully elected Donald J. Trump as our president, are completely fed up and disgusted with CNN and other liberal media outlets continually launching malicious fabricated propaganda (aka fake news) attacks on our P. O. T. U. S. ,\u201d Selaty told Breitbart News. He went on: We believe this fake news media movement to destroy our president is not only hurting the credibility of mainstream media and undermining our election process but is equally impacting our American society in a very negative way as we\u2019ve seen by the recent attack in Virginia on our elected Republican officials. We demand that CNN and all media outlets have ethics and truth in their reporting or we will continue to mass protest at their headquarters and express our discontent with their sponsors. We ask all of our fellow patriots to stand with us this Saturday at CNN\u2019s headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia and send a clear message to CNN and all other media outlets guilty of spreading unsubstantiated stories to hurt our president and fellow Americans. \u201cNo more fake news,\u201d Selaty said. The protest will take place from 11:00 a. m. to 12:30 p. m. Saturday at CNN, located at 190 Marietta St. NW, Atlanta, Georgia. Cox\u2019s group will also hold a rally on Sunday in Marietta, GA. in support of Republican congressional candidate Karen Handel. \u201cThe Bikers for Trump phenomenon will continue to support congressional races across the country for the Republican candidates that pledge support for Trump and we will hold them accountable to that pledge,\u201d Cox said. \u201cWe\u2019re encouraging people to come out and support our president,\u201d said Dooley, who is also one of 22 national   of the Tea Party. \u201cAnd to condemn the extreme biased coverage at CNN. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628400.0805807}
