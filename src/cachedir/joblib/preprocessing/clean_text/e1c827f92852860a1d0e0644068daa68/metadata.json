M5.9 #earthquake ( #terremoto ) strikes 135 km NE of #Roma ( #Italy ) 13 min ago.

It is important to remain calm.\u201d \\nThe official said that the emergency is exacerbated by a downpour, and intermittent problems with mobile phone communication. \\n\u201cIt was a very strong, apocalyptic earthquake \u2013 people were screaming in the street, and now the lights are cut off,\u201d said Marco Rinaldi, the mayor of Ussita, a community of 400 that was also affected by the initial earthquake. \\nA video posted by a Huffington Post journalist shows rubble strewn through the streets of Visso, a commune less than 10 km from the epicenter. \\n\u2014 Claudio Paudice (@clapaudice) October 26, 2016 \\nThe Civil Protection agency, the centralized service which is receiving infromation from dozens of tiny settlements scattered across the area, say that older buildings have been damaged, or collapsed entirely, but that no injuries have been reported. #Italy Civil Prot Agency says so far no reports of injuries following 5.4M #earthquake in central Apennines. Panicked people in streets. \\n\u2014 Daniele Pinto (@DanielePinto) October 26, 2016 \\nEyewitnesses also reported a powerful tremor in the capital on the western side of the country, more than 150 km away, saying that centuries-old buildings were shaking. It\u2019s been almost a hour since the earthquake and my heart is still racing. I hope nothing else will happen over night or tomorrow\u2026'"}, "time": 1742561722.7404912}
