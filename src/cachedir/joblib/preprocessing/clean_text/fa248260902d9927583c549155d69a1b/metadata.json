A coalition of US-led countries has been reportedly providing air support to the operation. \\n\u201cIt's been long a part of our plan that the Mosul operation would kick off when it did. This was a plan that goes back many months now and that Raqqah would follow soon behind,\u201d Carter added. Iraqi forces gather in the al-Shura area, south of Mosul, October 24, 2016.

Washington and its allies have come under fire for openly seeking to remove President Bashar al-Assad from power. \\nAmnesty International, a UK-based rights group, said Wednesday that the US-led airstrikes have killed hundreds of civilians across Syria. \\nCarter\u2019s remarks came only a day after British Defense Secretary Michael Fallon said UK special forces will soon resume training \u201cmoderate\u201d militants in Syria to bolster the fight against Daesh. \\nThe new effort would be an extension of a failed $500 million program by the Pentagon that was supposed to \u201ctrain and equip\u201d up to 5,000 militants every year, but was discontinued in November last year, after failing to attract enough volunteers. \\nRussia, which has been pounding Daesh across Syria upon a request from Damascus, says the Western-trained militants\u2019 only use is to oust Assad.
