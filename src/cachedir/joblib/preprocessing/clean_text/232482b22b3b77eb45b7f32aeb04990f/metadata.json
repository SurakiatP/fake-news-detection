Rod Blum ( ) ended an interview with a reporter on Monday in which he was questioned about requiring identification for people taking part in his town hall meetings.   activists across the country have systematically disrupted these events  \u2014   sometimes people who are not constituents. [Josh Scheinblum, a reporter with the   TV9 in Cedar Rapids, asked Blum \u201cwhy the decision was made\u201d to require identification.  \u201cBecause we want people from the first district to be at our town halls,\u201d Blum said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want people from outside of the first district. \u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t need people from Chicago there or Des Moines there or Minneapolis there,\u201d Blum said. \u201cI don\u2019t represent them. \u201cThey should go talk to their representatives at their town hall meetings,\u201d Blum said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why they would want to be at my town hall meetings to start with. \u201d Instead of moving on to issues that face Iowans in Blum\u2019s first district, the reporter said the Congressman \u201crepresents all Iowans\u201d and shouldn\u2019t they have a \u201cvoice at the table?\u201d After Blum explained that, like voting, people should participate in town halls based on where they live, the reporter asked him if he would take a donation from a Republican in Iowa City, which is not in Blum\u2019s district. At that point, Blum ended the interview, calling the questions \u201cridiculous\u201d and saying that the he wouldn\u2019t stand by and let the reporter \u201cbadger\u201d him. As Blum left the room, children who accompanied him seemed to punctuate his departure with funny moves as the reporter tried to continue the interview. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about the issues here,\u201d the reporter said to the empty chair.
