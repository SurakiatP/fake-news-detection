Was it the federal government\u2019s fault, for not being attentive enough? Or was state government to blame, for rejecting proposals to raise the dam and spending money on   rail instead? [The San Jose Mercury News has an answer: both are to blame, for ignoring a warning raised in 2005 that the emergency spillway could fail in heavy rain.  The paper reported Monday: Three environmental groups  \u2014   the Friends of the River, the Sierra Club and the South Yuba Citizens League  \u2014   filed a motion with the federal government on Oct. 17, 2005, as part of Oroville Dam\u2019s relicensing process, urging federal officials to require that the dam\u2019s emergency spillway be armored with concrete, rather than remain as an earthen hillside. The groups filed the motion with FERC, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. They said that the dam, built and owned by the state of California, and finished in 1968, did not meet modern safety standards because in the event of extreme rain and flooding,   water would overwhelm the main concrete spillway, then flow down the emergency spillway, and that could cause heavy erosion that would create flooding for communities downstream, but also could cause a failure, known as \u201closs of crest control. \u201d   \u2026     FERC rejected that request, however, after the state Department of Water Resources, and the water agencies that would likely have had to pay the bill for the upgrades, said they were unnecessary. There will be plenty of   in the days to come. For officials dealing with an emergency situation on Sunday evening, however, it was more important to work together. For now. Joel B.
