The percentage of the working age population in the United States that had a job in March 2013 was exactly the same as it was all the way back in March 2010. In addition, as you will see below, there are now more than 101 million working age Americans that do not have a job. But even though the employment level in the United States has consistently remained very low over the past three years, the Obama administration keeps telling us that unemployment is actually going down. In fact, they tell us that the unemployment rate has declined from a peak of 10.0% all the way down to 7.6%. And they tell us that in March the unemployment rate fell by 0.1% even though only 88,000 jobs were added to the U.S. economy. But it takes at least 125,000 new jobs a month just to keep up with population growth. So how in the world are they coming up with these numbers? Well, the reality is that the entire decline in the unemployment rate over the past three years can be accounted for by the reduction in size of the labor force. In other words, the Obama administration is getting unemployment to go down by pretending that millions upon millions of unemployed Americans simply do not want jobs anymore. We saw this once again in March. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, more than 600,000 Americans dropped out of the labor market during that month alone. That pushed the labor force participation rate down to 63.3%, which is the lowest it has been in more than 30 years. So please don\u2019t believe the hype. The sad truth is that there has been no jobs recovery whatsoever. \\nIf things were getting better, there would not be more than 101 million working age Americans without a job. \\nSo exactly where does that statistic come from? Well, the following explains where I got that number\u2026 \\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are 11,742,000 working age Americans that are officially unemployed. \\nIn addition, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics says that there are 89,967,000 working age Americans that are \u201cnot in the labor force\u201d. That is a new all-time record, and that number increased by a whopping 663,000 during the month of March alone. \\nWhen you add 11,742,000 working age Americans that are officially unemployed to the 89,967,000 working age Americans that are \u201cnot in the labor force\u201d, you come up with a grand total of 101,709,000 working age Americans that do not have a job. \\nWhen you stop and think about it, that is an absolutely staggering statistic. \\nAnd anyone that tells you that \u201ca higher percentage of Americans are working today\u201d is telling you a complete and total lie. During the last recession the percentage of working age Americans with a job fell dramatically, and since then we have not seen that number bounce back at all. In fact, this is the very first time in the post-World War II era that we have not seen the employment-population ratio bounce back after a recession. At this point, the employment-population ratio has been under 60 percent for 49 months in a row\u2026 \\nSince the end of 2009, the employment-population ratio has been remarkably steady. Just check out these numbers\u2026 \\nMarch 2008: 62.7 percent \\nMarch 2012: 58.5 percent \\nMarch 2013: 58.5 percent \\nWe should be thankful that the percentage of working age Americans with a job did not continue to decline, but we should also be quite alarmed that it has not bounced back at all. \\nIf there was going to be a recovery, there would have been one by now. The next major economic downturn is rapidly approaching, and that is going to push the employment-population ratio down even farther. \\nSo why is the U.S. economy not producing as many jobs as it used to? Well, certainly the overall decline of the economy has a lot to do with it. We are a nation that is drowning in debt and that is getting poorer by the day. \\nBut since the end of the last recession, corporate profits have bounced back in a big way and are now at an all-time high . So you would figure that the big corporations should be able to hire a lot more workers by now. \\nUnfortunately, that is not the way things work anymore. Big corporations are trying to minimize the number of expensive American workers that they have on their payrolls as much as possible these days. \\nOne way that they are doing this is through the use of technology. Thanks to robots, computers and other forms of technology, big corporations simply do not need as many human workers as they used to. In future years, this trend is only going to accelerate. I wrote about how this is changing the world of employment in one of my previous articles entitled \u201c Rise Of The Droids: Will Robots Eventually Steal All Of Our Jobs? \u201d \\nAnother way that big corporations are replacing expensive American workers is by shipping their jobs off to the other side of the globe. Big corporations know that they can make bigger profits by making stuff in foreign countries where they can pay workers less than a dollar an hour with no benefits. How in the world are American workers supposed to compete with that? \\nFor much more on how U.S. jobs are being killed by offshoring, please see this article: \u201c 55 Reasons Why You Should Buy Products That Are Made In America \u201c. \\nAnd of course immigration is having a dramatic impact on the labor market in some areas of the country as well. Cheap labor has dramatically driven down wages in a lot of professions. For example, once upon a time you could live a very nice middle class lifestyle as a roofer. But now many roofers really struggle to make a living. \\nWhen you add everything up, it paints a very bleak picture for the future of the American worker. \\nThe cost of living keeps rising much faster than wages do, and the competition for good jobs has become incredibly fierce. \\nMeanwhile, the government continues to make things even easier for those that are not working. This has caused some Americans to give up completely and to be content with letting the government take care of them. The following is from a recent article by Monty Pelerin \u2026 \\nAs we make it easier to get unemployment benefits for longer time periods, more people take advantage of the system. So too with food stamps and disability. All programs are at or near record levels in what is supposed to be four years into an economic recovery. For many, the benefits of becoming a government dependent exceed what they can earn. One study reported that a family of four, collecting all the benefits for which they were entitled, would have to earn $65,000 per annum to have the same after-tax purchasing power. \\nIf you are a product of the government schools and are legal to work (i.e., have skills enough that you are affordable at the minimum wage or higher), at what point do you realize that there is no need to go through the hassle of actual work. You can live pretty well by staying home and taking advantage of the entitlements available to you. That is exactly what a larger and larger percentage of the population are realizing. In many cases, it is economically irrational to work. \\nThis behavior creates a social pathology that only worsens over time. Kids learn from their parents that work is not necessary and the many ways to game the system. In this regard, look for this problem to become worse over time unless these programs are cut back. \\nIn some areas of the country, it actually pays not to work very hard. According to Gary Alexander , the Secretary of Public Welfare for the state of Pennsylvania, a \u201csingle mom is better off earnings gross income of $29,000 with $57,327 in net income & benefits than to earn gross income of $69,000 with net income and benefits of $57,045.\u201d \\nBut the truth is that most Americans still want to work hard and would gladly take a good job if they could just find one. The following is one example that was featured in a recent Fox News article \u2026 \\nAfter a full year of fruitless job hunting, Natasha Baebler just gave up. \\nShe\u2019d already abandoned hope of getting work in her field, working with the disabled. But she couldn\u2019t land anything else, either \u2014 not even a job interview at a telephone call center. \\nUntil she feels confident enough to send out resumes again, she\u2019ll get by on food stamps and disability checks from Social Security and live with her parents in St. Louis. \\n\u201cI\u2019m not proud of it,\u201d says Baebler, who is in her mid-30s and is blind. \u201cThe only way I\u2019m able to sustain any semblance of self-preservation is to rely on government programs that I have no desire to be on.\u201d \\nAnd that is how most Americans feel. \\nMost Americans do not want to be dependent on the government . \\nMost Americans want to work hard and take care of themselves. \\nUnfortunately, our economy is not producing nearly enough jobs for everyone and it never will again. \\nSo there will continue to be millions upon millions of Americans that find that they cannot take care of themselves and their families without government assistance no matter how hard they try. \\nAnd this is just the beginning \u2013 things are going to get much worse during the next major wave of the economic collapse. \\nYes, at the moment there are more than 101 million working age Americans that do not have a job, but that number is actually going to go much higher in the years ahead. The anger and frustration caused by a lack of employment opportunities is going to shake this nation. \\nThat is why it is important to try to become less dependent on your own job. In this economic environment, a job can disappear at literally any moment. Anything that you can do to become less dependent on the system would be a good thing. 21 Statistics About The Explosive Growth Of Poverty In America That Everyone Should Know \u00bb Rodster \\nThe best advice is to try and start your own business. It\u2019s funny how just prior to the crash of 2008 I always felt at a disadvantage not earning a regular paycheck and was tempted to give up my business and get a full time job. \\nAfter 2008 I thank my lucky stars I continued on with my business and now I feel i\u2019m at an advantage because I can earn a living fixing cars. RICHARD \\nWhy would any one want to go out and get a job when they can sit on there duff and make more money drawing unemployment and food stamps, plus I am sure there working on the side to. Syrin \\nThis is EXACTLY the point. FunkYou FunkMe \\nHeck yeah, why work full-time with a company that covers their part of taxes and might offer benefits further bettering my compensation when I can work for myself without a guarantee of getting anything tomorrow. I mean sure it works for some, but we all can\u2019t run our own businesses. More power to the people that do, but again it isn\u2019t for everyone. LifeandLiberty \\nObama\u2019s transformation of America is working as planned. charlie \\nThis is WAY bigger than Obama. He\u2019s pushing the agenda, but he\u2019s not the one giving the ques. Look to the secretary General of the United Nations if you want a clear path to start from. Jack White \\nNo\u2026.. Even farther back\u2026 Think creation of Fed Reserve, then you are gettin to the root/heart of the problem\u2026 \\nWell, Bernanke has no wiggle room to accommodate higher rates for savings. \\nThe Fed will have to quit printing $85 billion per month or finance such expansion through sales of treasuries if the fed rate is to rise and lift saving rates. The printing continues under the folly of needing to continue monetary expansion until unemployment gets down to a certain level. \\nThe next big delay in change will be based on \u201cwe gotta keep printing until the unemployment figures are solid\u201d!

Cheap labor is available all over the place, both overseas, and inside the USA itself (imported from south of the border). Ralfine \\nYes, replace Obama with a white supremacist and everything will be well. Put the women back in the kitchen and you suddenly have zero unemployment. As you have now more jobs than workers, get in some mexican slaves, but without their families. Return them when they are worn out. Cut all welfare. But only the welfare to the poor. Cut all taxes to the rich. Force unemployed to work for free to get necessary work experience. Promote wars for American-style democracy and let the soldiers get their spoils directly on-site. Billy G \\nYour ideas are intriguing to me, I\u2019d like to subscribe to your newsletter. Ralfine \\nHistory repeats itself. Read some books about the Third Reich. The BBC also has made some good documentaries. And dont forget to read Mein Kampf, which was mandatory reading, so every German should have known what was happening. \\nRead some American history, maybe Howard Zinn: A people\u2019s history of the United States. jaxon64 \\nYou forget\u2013Obama is a member of the party which created white supremacists in the USA, started the KKK, were the southern democrat slave holders, voted against the civil rights act 4 times from the 1860\u2019s until the 1960\u2019s and were even willing to die and have their sons die so that they could keep their slaves\u2026.etc. \\nI think the most surreal moment of 2011 was watching Obama give such a moving eulogy at WV senator (D) Byrd\u2019s funeral. I still can\u2019t figure out which was more mind-boggling. Having a man who is 1/8th black/african as the honored speaker at a KKK Grand Dragon\u2019s funeral or.. vice versa- that a man who stirs the racial pot every chance he gets saying such glowing things about an ignorant Dem who hated blacks\u2026. \\nPS: I\u2019m not a supporter of the neo-cons like bush, mcCan\u2019t or Obamney either so don\u2019t waste your time with an attack as you defend \u201cyour blue team\u201d Ralfine \\nYes, America is a strange place on earth. \\nI also found this on wikipedia: \\n\u201cIn 1997, Byrd told an interviewer he would encourage young people to become involved in politics but also: \u201cBe sure you avoid the Ku Klux Klan. Don\u2019t get that albatross around your neck. Once you\u2019ve made that mistake, you inhibit your operations in the political arena.\u201d[20] In his last autobiography, Byrd explained that he was a KKK member because he \u201cwas sorely afflicted with tunnel vision\u2014a jejune and immature outlook\u2014seeing only what I wanted to see because I thought the Klan could provide an outlet for my talents and ambitions.\u201d[21] Byrd also said, in 2005, \u201cI know now I was wrong. Intolerance had no place in America. I apologized a thousand times \u2026 and I don\u2019t mind apologizing over and over again. I can\u2019t erase what happened.\u201d[10]\u201d markthetruth \\nMr Bill : Mrs Obama is rich. Hope Your in DC Plenty of move where that one comes from. \\nthe end\u2026 \\nCan we do worse than Bush?

I enjoy reading your articles. MichaelfromTheEconomicCollapse \\nThat is a good suggestion. Certainly Obamacare is not going to help things one bit. \\nMichael Stacey \\nMichael , alot of people are already feeling the effects of Obamacare. Workers are being reduced to part time. Under 30 hrs due to a provision in Obamacare which states employers have to provide health coverage to employees who work full time, 30 hours or more a week. \\nObamacare is already bending over the elderly even thou that was one of the arguements of the stupidcrats\u2026 They say it isn\u2019t, but the boots on the ground say a different story\u2026. markthetruth \\nOnly 1/3 of the 315 + 25(illegal) 340 million People in the U kfilly \\nWe know what it will look like.

These devices aren\u2019t making humans fat, lazy, and dumb. It\u2019s our society that does that. If our society geared these technological advances to be mainly the pathway to higher knowledge and productivity then we would be in a better position. In some ways it\u2019s an individual thing for different people. I know some people that grew up loathing to read, but found joy in reading once they discovered eBooks. There are so many apps and potential apps that can help better organization and motivate people better, but it does no good if people don\u2019t care. Simple fact is people just don\u2019t care. This isn\u2019t to generalize everyone. Some people care, but the majority of people don\u2019t care. James \\nHow many of those people are stay at home moms or people in college etc\u2026 MichaelfromTheEconomicCollapse \\nJames: \\nYes, those are certainly included in the working age population, so we will never have a time when all of them are working. \\nBut what is alarming is that the percentage of the working age population that is working has not gone back up at all after falling so dramatically during the last recession. \\nMichael razorbacks \\nIts easy to get caught up in keeping up with the Jones\u2019 and chasing the dollar.

I live on a small farm (paid for) and have a garden spot, springs on the farm, nickels, ammo and guns\u2026Problem is my work requires being gone for months at a time. My biggest concern is getting home if it gets very bad. So how much money stashed away is enough? That\u2019s the million dollar question. K \\nMichael, once again you have touched on every major point. I believe you are totally correct. It is just another case of the numbers being rigged. Whether it is unemployment or the stock market, or the cost of living. All the numbers are rigged anymore. If more people were capable of critical thinking, the rigging of numbers, would have stopped working a long time ago. Remember, what is now called normalcy bias. We used to call, not being in contact with reality. And it was considered a mental disability. Jodi \\nThings are about to get much, much worse for those counting on unemployment benefits. This morning I logged onto my unemployment account & noticed a message saying that after April 1st unemployment benefits will be reduced to a certain percentage due to sequestration. Luckily, I found a job in November but anybody else who hasn\u2019t been fortunate enough to find a job yet is going to feel the pain even more now. But interestingly enough no reduction in Obama\u2019s golf outings & he doesn\u2019t seem to care much. Mondobeyondo \\nYes Jodi, things are about to get very bad. Obamacare is going to be a job killer, for those who are still employed. For the long term unemployed, like moi\u2026 well\u2026 Jodi \\nMondo, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve been unemployed for a long time. It took me 14 mos to find work after I lost my good paying job for 13 years. God Bless you, I hope you find work soon. \\nI feel fortunate to have found a job but I only work 30 hrs a week & $5.00 less per hour than my old job. The reason why I\u2019m working 30hrs\u2026Bingo, that\u2019s right Obamacare. Annoynimus \\nAnd because you continue to collect unemployment while working? Jodi \\nI know longer collect unemployment, I still have an account with the unemployment office. JackWms \\nShe didn\u2019t say she was still collecting, prehaps you need to learn to read.

LazyIke \\nWhen a person runs out of unemployment, unless they register with the useless unemployment off, they are considered by the BLS as not looking for a job. Not necessarily true! charlie \\nThings are far worse than many know. We live in the rural area\u2019s & we are being attacked at every turn by Agenda 21 AKA: Corporate farmers & others. Had 2 UN soldiers on our property. animals poisoned and slaughter as early as yesterday 2 calves killed in the same night, They have tried to burn down our place & attempted to kill us by running us off the road. We are very much on our own, as it is apparent the law enforcement is protecting them. It is very sad that people think this is a thing to save the environment because if they were out here in the war zone they would see it is exactly the opposite. Fact is it is a HUGE reason everyone\u2019s standard of living is dropping and America is falling into a very dark abyss. Unless people wake up and get the UN out of the US it is going to get even worse real fast. I have been fighting these monsters for many years. AMERICA! WAKE UP! They are NOT your friends! If you have a problem, you isolate it and then resolve it. Everytime people isolate it, they push out a distraction to get minds on something else, but fact is Agenda 21 IS the problem & Americans need to get focused and stop them. Tex May \\ncharlie\u2026 make an appointment to see your Doctor. You need help man! charlie \\nYou do realize that those involved in this agenda all do the same things & say the same things, right, TEX? For the past 40 years it has been repetitious. The crazy card has been played to death to cover all this up. Fact is when people educate themselves on the happenings you are all very easy to spot. I find it amazing that so many Americans are willing to assist in the overthrow of their own country on a premise of a Utopia that will never exist the way you all think it will. charlie \\nHey Tex, I woke up to DEAD ANIMALS all over my farm this morning along with a bunch stolen again. I wake up EVERY DAY with trucks reving their engines all the way around my house, now let me tell you something if I wasn\u2019t TRAUMA BASED RAISED BY SATANISTS & COMMUNISDTS this would drive me absolutely in sane, but FACT IS it is just another day for me because it is the ONLY LIFE I personally know. I am a CHRISTIAN. I KNOW why I am being stalked and tormented. These people have killed everything I love my entire life. I grew up in your so called Utopia and used to just watch your lives and became happy in doing so. My point is the actions happening in my life is NORMAL so though I may cry and be sad about what\u2019s happening, being trauma based raised it\u2019s not as traumatizing to ,me any longer what is sad for me is watching so many others enduring what I had screamed my bloody head off for years warning about and being called crazy which hurt my feelings at first but now I see what so called sane is and being crazy is an honor. Well, I have more dead animals to bury, so here I go again. Just another day, same thing over and over again. Euhill \\nAgenda 21 is just the tip of the ice berge. What is happening is a whole lot worse than that.

Makati1 \\nDidn\u2019t mention that those 101 million also do not have money to spend to increase demand so that corporations need to hire. And the others that are employed are getting shrinking paychecks and buy less and less. No corporation is going to hire and increase production when there is no market for their product. That is the \u2018Catch 22\u2032 of the current situation. But, then the other mentioned reasons also fed the collapse in jobs. Welcome to \u2018for profit\u2019 capitalism. Do you have your food stamps card? You soon may. quercus454 \\nI have talked that same point over and over again with my more liberal family members. Some 30 plus years ago corporate American found it was cheaper and easier to cut labor, rather then build a better mouse trap. They pushed the idea of free trade to increase profits and because of that today we have lost millions of well paying jobs. At first the effect was not so noticeable. Families with declining incomes borrowed on their homes and credit cards to try to keep their standard of living at the same level it was. Now the effects are really kicking in. Those who tried to keep up their standard of living by increasing their debt, lost on that gamble, the economy never picked up. \\nBy essentially destroying most of the middle class, corporate America killed the goose that laid the golden egg. As more and more people lost their jobs or had their wages decline because of foreign competition, their ability to purchase good and services also declined. Credit is no longer viable for many. Factor in Obamacare cutting employee hours and inflation and it is no surprise that many of America\u2019s biggest and oldest retailers are closing stores. In order to prosper and be successful businesses need customers. If you remove a large segment of your customer base either by unemploying them, reducing their wages or displacing them with low wage foreign labor, you are going to fail. \\nCorporate American brought this on themselves by being greedy and short sighted. Congress hasn\u2019t a clue as they still think increasing the population thru immigration will some how solve or negate their previous bad decisions. Adding more low income consumers will not replace the millions of middle class incomes that have been lost. Fred Montgomery \\nPeople want to work for a living; a man does not want a handout. The problem is there are no jobs and the few jobs out there don\u2019t pay anything. No one can live off of nothing. Now, we are now promoting welfare and food stamps over hard work and perserverance. Meanwhile, the robber barons who started all of the economic misery keep robbing us blind. Syrin \\nTo quote Monty Perelin, \u201cIf you are a product of the government schools and are legal to work (i.e., have skills enough that you are affordable at the minimum wage or higher), at what point do you realize that there is no need to go through the hassle of actual work.

Kids learn from their parents that work is not necessary and the many ways to game the system. In this regard, look for this problem to become worse over time unless these programs are cut back.\u201d Syrin \\nFrom zerohedge, \u201d Now we finally know that the very bottom of the entitlement food chain also makes out like a bandit compared to that idiot American who actually works and pays their taxes. One can only also hope that in addition to seeing their disposable income be eaten away by a kleptocratic entitlement state, that the disappearing middle class is also selling off its weaponry. Because if it isn\u2019t, and if it finally decides it has had enough, the outcome will not be surprising at all: it will be the same old that has occurred in virtually every revolution in the history of the world to date.\u201d Syrin \\nMichael, why do you say most people don\u2019t want to be dependent on gov\u2019t? This is the age of the GARYs. Back in the 30\u2019s, one would get gov\u2019t assistance as a last resort with one\u2019s head hung low in shame. Now it\u2019s a career decision.

If you receive gov\u2019t assistance in the form of welfare, food stamps or medicaid, YOU LOSE THE RIGHT TO VOTE BECAUSE IT\u2019S A CONFLICT OF INTEREST. That way those who PAY for all these leeches get to decide how much they are willing to surrender. Two YEARS of unemployment? I don\u2019t think so. Hank Kingsley \\nSo anyone who works for these parasitic Wall Street scumbanks shouldn\u2019t be allowed to vote? I quite agree. Not American \\nI love your profile picture, it fits you! FunkYou FunkMe \\nConflict of interest?! We vote so that our voices (THE PEOPLE) are heard. Whether you like it or not, they are just as much part of the people as you are. Colin \\nI am reading Aristotle. He speaks of a continuum. On one end, there is excess, and,. on the other, there is deficiency. In the middle, there is the intermediate. Now applying this to the job market \u2013 there are people who are unemployed (the deficiency), who aren\u2019t fully unemployed nor employed (the intermediate), and who are fully employed (the excess). For many on government dependence, they are attempting to reach the intermediate, but are not succeeding. \\nMy mother is deficient \u2013 she has no job. She wants to be employed, she wants to be on the other side of the continuum. She receives unemployment assistance. The state says, \u201cYou want money from us, look for a job.\u201d She does, but hasn\u2019t got a job. \\nThere was a belief in Aristotle\u2019s time that the wealthy had an obligation to the city-state (the polis). They paid for the city\u2019s defenses, for the construction of public works, and so on. It seems to me that we as a nation have failed to persuade the wealthy that they have an obligation to their homeland. I am not speaking of taxes solely, as Gary2 does; I am thinking of construction projects that could rebuild this country\u2019s infrastructure and get people to work. \\nAristotle considered munificence to be a intermediate between vulgarity and shabbiness. Far too many of our wealthy are shabby. \\nThere are Senators and Representatives in the Congress who recognize that this country\u2019s poor have become \u201cInvisible\u201d. However, they are few in numbers, and the majority opinion dominates the political discussion. Mondobeyondo \\nA sad commentary of America, circa 2013. \\nThe ONLY reason why the \u201cunemployment rate\u201ddropped one tenth of a percentage point for March, is that so many people have given up looking for work. \\nObamacare will certainly not help matters. It makes an already bad business environment downright horrific. kfilly \\nObamacare might help with the unemployment numbers as every full-time job is likely to become 2 part-time jobs. Boy, those job number will be looking better once it goes into full effect. Sigh! chilller \\nIt was all Obama\u2019s hope to change us into a subservient nation under the thumb of big gov\u2026without all of the extensive entitlements, the masses of unemployed would have overthrown the system by now, hence the gub-mint has bought time to put itself into a defensive posture for when the music stops and there\u2019s 101M+ people trying to find 10 chairs. Mondobeyondo \\n101 million working age Americans, are 101 million working age Americans who are not able to contribute to the economy. \\nThey can not buy furniture. They can\u2019t afford cable TV, so they\u2019re stuck watching \u201cThe Voice\u201d on network television. They can\u2019t afford new clothes, a new car, jewelry, or a professional sports game. What are these people concerned about the most? Food. A roof over their heads. Keeping their children (if they have children) educated and healthy, and keeping themselves sane in spite of the Mess we\u2019re all stuck in. \\nThere will be NO real economic recovery, unless and until our nation\u2019s manufacturing base is rebuilt and restored \u2013 and there are serious doubts about that happening soon, if ever. Everything else \u2013 the stock market, low wage service jobs, etc \u2013 is just chasing after rainbows. El Pollo de Oro \\nMondobeyondo: Excellent points. There will be no economic recovery in the BRA if the only jobs being created are crap service jobs. When millions and millions of people are working 50 or 60 hours a week and still cannot make ends meet, what you have is a Third World economy. There are plenty of low-paying jobs in Guatemala and Bolivia, but not nearly enough jobs that pay a decent wage. And good luck starting a small business in the BRA. The deck is totally stacked against legal small businesses in this banana republic. \\nSo what happens when you have millions of people who have a strong work ethic, realize that the game is totally rigged and are sick of their miserable, desperate, hopeless circumstances? They join the underground economy, which (as we\u2019ve seen in M\u00e9xico) can have horrifying consequences. Unless this country rejects corporatism, returns to true capitalism and free enterprise, rebuilds its manufacturing base and becomes friendly to small businesses, the only growth areas will be: (1) dead-end crap service jobs, and (2) crime and the underground economy. I\u2019m not optimistic. Mondobeyondo \\nOne final observation, before having my fourth can of \u201cRed Bull\u201d energy enhancing beverage: \\nIllegal immigration. It has a huge affect of the legal working American. It\u2019s a huge topic here in Arizona (and frankly I\u2019m sick of hearing about it every day, but nevertheless\u2026) \\nIf you\u2019re unemployed, you are competing with illegal immigrants who are willing to work for $3, $4/day. They don\u2019t mind a bit. It\u2019s far more money than they made in their homeland. Perhaps YOU can\u2019t live on that, but they\u2019re fine with it. \\nSo your professional American roofer guy who maybe earns $20 or $25 an hour, is getting replaced by some guy from Michoacan or Guadalajara, maybe Honduras, who\u2019s willing to work for $5/hour. His employer does not have to pay licence/bonding fees, nor insurance, nor health care, nor Social Security, nor TAXES!! \\nDon\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 I\u2019m all for LEGAL immigration. But not ILLEGAL immigration! quiet_forest \\nUh, I wouldn\u2019t be so keen on legal immigration anymore either. The Federal government runs four work visa programs. Three of those programs do not require the employer to pay any taxes or benefits. \\nSo, who do you think businesses hire first? The American that the government makes them pay taxes on, or the foreign worker who, because of his status, can\u2019t quit? They can treat him like an indentured servant, cheat him on wages, pay no taxes for him, and it\u2019s (mostly) legal. \\nEverything that is happening now is deliberate, top down bottom up. Government regulation crushes small business and stifles competition, while welfare programs demolish the work ethic, creating a defeated, compliant population. We are literally being turned into sharecrop tenants in our own country. If this next amnesty goes through, we are finished. The future of the whole country is already being showcased in California. We were never the land of fruits and nuts. It only looks that way. The reality is that, thanks to the machinations of people such as George Soros, California was the first state to become the land of rigged elections. FounderChurch \\nDEMOCRAT GOVERNMENT TRAINED BUMS: \\nWhere we started to go wrong was back in the Great Depression. Our moral center broke and we put everyone on welfare that whined for it, and it ruined the country permanently. \\nIt taught the people they didn\u2019t need to fend for themselves and that the government would provide for them, if they would just sit on their rear ends and yelp like dogs waiting to be fed. \\nWhat those unemployed workers needed in the depression was to be kicked in the rear end, and told to \u201croot hog, or die.\u201d \\nAt the same time we were putting these bums on relief, we had millions of acres of good land laying unplanted, and people\u2019s yards surrounding their houses just laying there. Why should people even plant a garden in their backyard when the government will feed them? CitizenS \\nThings are starting to really hit here in WV. My misses was laid off 2 weeks ago and she was the person that put miners for certain coal companies to work. Guess if they don\u2019t need miners, they don\u2019t need someone to call them in. but I met a friend the other evening (Friday night) to drop some things off to him @ the local movie house. The place was a ghost town! The entire strip was near vacant. This included multiple resteraunts, the big box stores, and multiple small shops. Batten down the hatches because when the poor state starts to see it, its gettin rough. Lucy Goldstein \\nCoal mining is such a source of contamination to our planet it needs to be eliminated! CitizenS \\nLucy I won\u2019t argue that coal is dirty. However, the power plants in our area have upgraded to the point that the only byproduct of firing with coal is gypsum, which they make drywall mud with and water vapor. Done correctly most of the land mined is reclaimed into something useful instead of an area that was previously all but inaccessible. That being said, yes its dangerous and dirty, but its a livelyhood for the men that work in the coal fields. billy \\nHomeless Bill lives in Anchorage, AK.

Congratulations. none \\nThank God President Obama has expanded the immigration numbers! \\nAlso now, they will be able to get government guaranteed loans to buy up all the small business that they own!

Jagrick \\nStuff like this tells me that a lot more (deemed) illegal activity will go on in the future. Euhill \\nYes it will until the end game has been achieved.

By any definition Obama is an abject failure. His problem is that he is a moderate republican posing as a dem. Before everyone starts calling me names stop and think of what Obama has done and compare it to Nixon/Ford. Robert (qslv) \\nGary, are you getting gun-shy? Oops, politically incorrect choice of words, lol\u2026\u2026.I actually agree with you that Nixon Ford was a bad choice \u2026off the silver standard, dollar devaluation, stagflation, the phony oil crisis.

Bruce \\nI have read all the comments and it is obvious that NO PRESIDENT is responsible. NO MATTER who is in office or gets into office they are nothing but puppets. Listen, the economy has NO way of recovering, PERIOD!!! Manufacturing is in shambles, wages have dropped to slave levels for many. What company wants to pay 10-15 bucks an hour when they can get the assembly or machining done for pennies on the dollar? Not to mention not having to pay unemployment taxes, matching Social Security, holiday pay, sick pay or vacation plus higher corporate taxes within the US. Employment will NEVER come back. It can\u2019t come back. Unless and until we place significant tariffs on all overseas products we are DONE. No other way will we ever be competitive or even hope to be. Who amongst you will work for 1.25 an hour with no benefits? Now is the time to prepare seriously to avoid hungry bellies in your family. I don\u2019t think ANY commentator, politician, or genius can dispute the fact that we are in a perfect storm. The truth in the matter is Clinton started all this with NAFTA and other free trade agreements. We are screwed, with NO WAY OUT!!! \\nBruce, Bush Sr allowed NAFTA to go through, but it was a Democrat strictly sponsored bill. Clinton unleashed the real monster. The WTO. Mondobeyondo \\nThis is a brief excerpt from Jon Talton\u2019s excellent blog (he was a former economic columnist for the \u201cArizona Republic\u201d newspaper, until management forced him out. He now lives in Seattle.) \\n\u201c\u2026Some macro realities will not go away: most Americans are much poorer after the recession; wages are stagnant and have been falling on average for years; unemployment remains high and many may never find work again; \u201cconsumers\u201d are still carrying more debt than historic norms; changing tastes and demographics, with talented young people and many boomers preferring real cities, not Sun City; Phoenix still has a low-wage economy\u2026\u201d \\nThe same thing can be said for the entire country. Don_in_Odessa \\nNow, this is the way to write a story on the internet. References posted with links to the actual dot Gov web sites. Little good it does these days though.

Alasha Tim Mullins \\nIt\u2019s good that somebody has the knowledge to mention the Third Reich. America is no longer the America of my youth. But any of the comments slamming capitalism, supremacism, or anything else from an earlier era is off base. \\nCheck the voting records of congress, as well as what was being passed, what it meant, and what riders were attached to the legislation. After that thoroughly confounds you, look up the definition of political far left, political far right, observe the real world results, and ask yourself why there is no real difference between the two. \\nThe problem is government period. We need less of it. Politicians need to learn that their job descriptions cover far more than simply passing laws. We don\u2019t want our nation changed, we want it fixed. \\nThe American People have spoken, but President Obama has not listened. And who comes next?

FunkYou FunkMe \\nI honestly believe the government needs to create more jobs. You can nag and complain about it all you want, but let\u2019s think about it. Sales Revenue in US soon will reach $5 trillion/year if it hasn\u2019t already. I remember looking that up. I\u2019m not sure if this is just in retail alone, but if it is then the numbers alone help my case. $50 billion plan to job 1.25 million Americans. This can be accomplished by a 1% federal sales tax. Pay could range from 30,000-50,000. 2% sales tax to extend the number of workers or including cost beyond labor. \\nAs a developed country we should pride ourselves in having a nation where a larger percentage of working age people are working, the community are clean, and advancements are made to better our communities. All my life I\u2019ve gone up and down streets acknowledging trash littered throughout the sides of roads and even in creek/river areas. I never could understand how we let ourselves become so filthy. Growing up I was always told that people volunteer and serve community service through their probation officer after doing a crime. With that said I always remember seeing the same trash stay in specific spots for weeks. To this day I continue to see trash remain in spots for days. I never make an uproar about it because I know I could very well spend a day off from work to walk down my community and clean it up. Honestly I keep telling myself I\u2019m going to do it, but after working a full week sometimes I don\u2019t feel like doing anything. So I talk myself out of doing anything. \\nThis probably seems like a small insignificant task to consider a job, but it\u2019s not much different than places that have janitor/maintenance workers/contractors. This is only one example. There are probably way more ideas to better our nation in multiple ways. I just know that creating that many jobs in a short period of time would be an immediate benefit to the economy and help it continue to grow. Now that we are working on getting out of a recession it is absolutely necessary that we figure ways to improve the economy. 1.25 million jobs added means 1.25 million potential more people to turn back around, pay taxes through income and sales, and contribute to businesses(big and small). The better business becomes for businesses the better their able to provide for their workers and themselves create more jobs. If I\u2019m a small business owner gaining a lot of business with my one location open, eventually that would lead to opening more locations, this would involve creating more jobs. This problem with no jobs actually created is the result of many jobs disappearing. Tons of layoffs result in the image and reality of job growth not occurring. That is sadly the case of what we\u2019ve experienced over these years. We need to let our voice be heard to move forward. \\nBTW looking at federal sales tax wasn\u2019t to necessarily say it\u2019s the way to go. I\u2019m a fan of the idea that our high sales in America can do wonderful things for our economy and our future. With that said I\u2019m not naive enough to say it could replace the income (personal/corporate) altogether with what our current spending is. peggie gor \\nLoan Application @ 2% (Serious Inquiry Only) \\nHello, do you need financial loan assistant, then your prayer has been answered, please contact us at: with Name,Amount,Duration and Phone Number.
