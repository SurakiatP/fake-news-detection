This is understandable, since the people of this war-torn regio n are kin to know what the White House is going to do in the next four years and in which way this will affect the Middle East . As for Barack Obama that is going to leave office pretty soon, it\u2019s hardly a secret that local media sources w ere criticizing his polic ies in strong language. \u201c Obama\u2019s legacy in the Middle East \u2014 is a complete disaster, as the conflict in Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Libya continue, while being unaddressed. \u201d Al Jazeera would often write, quoting a speech delivered by the famous professor of international affairs at Harvard, Stephen Walt. T errorist attacks are shaking Turkey, Tunisia, Lebanon, while the situation in Palestine remains unclear , since the prospect s of a n actual settlement between Israelis and Palestinians are becoming increasingly remote. The steps that the US has taken in Libya and Yemen have led to their complete collapse as states . At the same time, all Obama ever did was to repeat his mantra that \u201cAssad should leave\u201d, which only aggravated the war in Syria. The only achievement that Obama can somehow put on his scoreboard \u2014 is the the Iran nuclear deal . According to the Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram, \u201c this campaign has been so scandalous , it is unlikely that the US will be able to recover from it in the near future .\u201d \u201c If America was perceived as a beacon of democracy, its lights have considerably dimmed recently. \u201d \u2013 says the Lebanese Daily Star. The remarks of Haed Al Maena, a Saudi journalist writing for the Saudi Gazette were particularly bold. \u201c Th is election campaign was the most polarized one in the U S history, \u201d\u2013 he would note . Analyzing the course of the election campaign, the author concludes that \u201c the Arabs have to rely on themselves, instead of expecting anything from America .\u201d The journalist subjected Hillary Clinton to particularly harsh criticism by claiming that \u201c she\u2019s been kissing ground the Israelis walk on , going as far as promis ing to invite Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu as the first foreign visitor to the White House in case of her victory . She announced strong support for the Israeli government, which occupies other peoples\u2019 land, murdering children and carrying on the worst form of apartheid known to men\u2026 This woman does not feel any remorse \u2014 we can just remember her insulting remarks about her husband\u2019s rape victims . The recent revelations released by the WikiLeaks show that she believes that the destruction of Syria will be beneficial to Israel .\u201d The Middle Eastern ruling and media elites alike resided on the assumption t hat Hillary Clinton would win. That is why Trump\u2019s success was rather unexpected, which in turn created a massive confusion. Now all the attention is paid to the detailed study and analysis of all the statements the next president of the United States has ever made . One may remember T ru mp \u2018s remarks about him being o n the same side with Russia and the Syrian regime in the fight against ISIS, instead of creating a no-fly zone that Hillary Clinton was advocating. Many Arab journalist are stressing the part of Trump\u2019s speech at the National Convention of the Republican Party in July 2016, where he accused the Obama administration of forcing America to bow to China, Mexico, Russia and the Islamic state. However, an increasing amount of attention is being paid to Trump\u2019s attitude towards Islam and the Muslim refugees. The Al Jazeera has already pu blished an article under the title President of Islamophobia, which stated that Trump rose to the heights of power due to his Islamophobic campaign, and now Islamophobia has b ecome the US official policy. It was noted that at first, when in one of the speeches Trump proposed a ban against Muslims entering the United States, this position received no approval. However, in March 2016, according to the survey, a significant portion of the US population fully supported this approach . One must note that Trump\u2019s position on the Arab-Israeli conflict is also rather sensitive for the Arab world . Trump, notes the above mentioned journalist Khalid Al Maena, would bring no good for the Arab s, since he\u2019s naive and un experienced and will only do what he believes is good for himself. And really \u2013 Al Maena concludes \u2014 \u201c how can one treat Arabs with sympathy, if they are at each other\u2019s throats.\u201d A number of Arab commentators have already noted that Trump \u2018s positiv e remarks about Israel, as some of them claim that he promise d to move the US embassy to Jerusalem \u2014 the declared but not recognized c apital of the Israeli state. The Jerusalem Post would stress that t he victory of pro- Israeli right-wing Trump would be \u201d the end of the P alestinian state. \u201c Vladimir Mashin, Ph.D. in History and a political commentator, exclusively for the online magazine \u201cNew Eastern Outlook\u201d .
