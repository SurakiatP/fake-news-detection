[\u201cI am really looking forward to seeing the new administration deliver on the promises they made, that we\u2019re going to defund Planned Parenthood and stop forcing taxpayers to subsidize the biggest abortion business in our country,\u201d the journalist says.  Following more than a year of being targeted by Planned Parenthood for his undercover videos revealing their alleged practice of selling the body parts of babies aborted in their clinics for a profit, Daleiden says being at March for Life 2017 with a new,   administration in office \u201cmeans a lot. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s cool coming full circle to see Vice President Pence speaking here  \u2014   it\u2019s historic for a sitting vice president to be speaking at the March for Life  \u2014   and for this vice president in particular,\u201d he explains. \u201cNone of us would be talking about defunding Planned Parenthood had it not been for Congressman Mike Pence 10 years ago raising this issue and talking about it when nobody else was at the time. \u201d \u201cI\u2019m personally looking forward to a new Department of Justice, hoping that Planned Parenthood is finally going to be held accountable to the law for their numerous barbaric crimes against women, children, and families,\u201d he adds. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to seeing a   Congress and a   administration working together on enacting the significant policy changes that the majority of Americans tell us they want when it comes to abortion policy and increased protections for our unborn brothers and sisters. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628454.6683779}
