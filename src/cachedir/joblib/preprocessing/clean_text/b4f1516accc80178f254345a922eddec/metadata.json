Last month this offbeat real estate show on the FYI network began its third season of cramming homeowners into trailers, bungalows and other mini abodes. The homes are little. The season premiere was not. The running time was nearly 65 minutes uninterrupted  \u2014   a full hour and a half with ads. There\u2019s been a lot of talk in the business about \u201cToo Much TV\u201d  \u2014   the surfeit of hundreds of original scripted series every year. But there\u2019s a corollary issue:   TV. Even as viewers\u2019 time becomes more precious, individual episodes are bloating. Television has come down with a case of gigantism. HBO\u2019s   drama, \u201cVinyl,\u201d began with a   pilot, directed by Martin Scorsese, that vamped on like the coda to \u201cFreebird. \u201d The series premiere of FX\u2019s drama \u201cFargo\u201d ran around 97 minutes with ads. \u201cFargo,\u201d the Coen brothers movie it was based on, ran 98. Episodes of Netflix\u2019s romantic comedy \u201cLove\u201d ambled up to 40 minutes. As a critic, I\u2019m used to championing greater options for artists. We\u2019re lucky to live in a time when TV creators have freedom from arbitrary constraints. But more and more of my TV watching these days involves starting an episode, looking at the number of minutes on the playback bar and silently cursing. Historically, network television was like a container ship the product had to fit standard boxes for ease of shipping. Networks needed predictable schedules and had to turn over specific time slots to affiliates. It was a process  \u2014     episodes were a presence in the early days of television  \u2014   but 30 minutes generally came to mean comedy, and 60, drama. Episodes used to be longer, in that commercial breaks were shorter, but the journey from beginning to end stayed the same. And networks occasionally tinkered with length. NBC supersized its popular Thursday night sitcoms in the early aughts Fox inflated \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d like a Macy\u2019s parade balloon. But those stunts were exceptions. Today\u2019s great fattening, like so many trends in TV now, is in part the influence of streaming TV. The only thing limiting the length of a Netflix or Amazon binge show is your ability to sit without cramping. The menu is bigger, and so are the portions. Meanwhile, basic cable channels realized that there was no reason their \u201chourlong\u201d series needed to end on the hour. If they pushed a 10 p. m. drama\u2019s end to, say, 11:17, they could give their creators the kind of narrative real estate available on   HBO and Showtime. The most dramatic early claimer of elbow room was FX\u2019s   drama, \u201cSons of Anarchy,\u201d which piled on plot and ended its   episodes with music montages. Now it\u2019s common for cable hits to plump up. The most recent season finale of \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d ran 90 minutes, though I have rarely seen an episode of \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d that needed its full 60. Like its zombies, it could be hacked down by a third and shamble along just as well. At best, extended episodes can make room for complexity. But focus and showmanship still matter. In a   era, being able to hook an audience is more important, not less. The best examples of Big TV make the most of each moment, instead of padding them out. Take Louis C. K. \u2019s   barroom drama \u201cHorace and Pete,\u201d whose first episode ran almost 68 minutes and played like live theater. Its third episode  \u2014   essentially a long dramatic monologue about infidelity by Laurie Metcalf  \u2014   is 43 minutes of regret and catharsis, the camera holding tight to Ms. Metcalf\u2019s face. I did not look at my watch once. Louis C. K. may have earned the right to go long by proving he could also go short his FX comedy, \u201cLouie,\u201d included stories that would run only a few minutes if that was all they needed. AMC\u2019s \u201cBetter Call Saul,\u201d a more conventional drama, regularly overstays its   slot by a few minutes. But it uses its time mindfully, to suspend tension and let character moments play out. There\u2019s a certain       aspect to longer episodes, even with great shows. When the sixth season of the sitcom \u201cCommunity\u201d moved to Yahoo from NBC, it was finally free of   constraints  \u2014   and something was off. The pacing was sluggish the jokes were less crystalline. Maybe \u201cCommunity\u201d  \u2014   a product of the fractious   compromise between art and business  \u2014   needed limits in order to transcend them. Those time constraints and network scissors, much as writers love to bash them, can be the Marie Kondo method of comedy. The first season of Netflix\u2019s \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u201d was originally made for NBC, and like its spiritual forebear \u201c30 Rock,\u201d it was packed like a diamond. The second season, made for streaming, is still funny, but you can feel the drag in some of its    episodes. TV was raised with rules, the product of technology and business models that had little to do with art. It\u2019s shedding those strictures as it grows up, which is good  \u2014   that\u2019s given us anarchic comedies like \u201cBroad City\u201d and    dramas like \u201cRectify. \u201d But freedom also proves the values of the discipline you learn under restrictions. I appreciate ambitious storytelling. But I also appreciate getting a full night\u2019s sleep.'"}, "time": 1742564260.421028}
