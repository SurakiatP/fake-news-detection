Coulter said if everyone were banned, that would eliminate the religious aspects that are preventing Trump from enacting his policy on immigration. \u201cI mean, what Trump, for example, suggested in his immigration policy paper, the greatest document since the Magna Carta, was a temporary ban on all immigration,\u201d Coulter said. \u201cYou have no religious problem then. Why doesn\u2019t he go back to that? It\u2019s both more aggressive  \u2014   be very careful. Let in a few a year. We\u2019re letting in 2 million people a year  \u2014   illegal, legal, guest workers. Probably more than 2 million. And The New York Times writes, \u2018Well, it\u2019s just impossible to vet that many people coming in.\u2019 Well, don\u2019t let in that many people then.

In Germany, it\u2019s a crime to support the Nazi Party. Are you worried about the Nazis today? No, but we are worried about ISIS. We are worried about Islamic terrorism. It ought to be a crime not merely to communicate, but to advocate that ideology and they ought to be thrown out of the country. \u201d Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor'"}, "time": 1742564319.916341}
