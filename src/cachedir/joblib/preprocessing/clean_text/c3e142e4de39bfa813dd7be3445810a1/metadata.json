Yahoo News reported that the FBI had not yet attained a warrant to see the emails, but this should be a moot point for two reasons \u2013 first, Anthony Weiner (the subject of the investigation that dug up the new Abedin/Clinton emails) has been cooperating and gave investigators clearance to all of his devices and electronic material. Secondly, Abedin previously swore to investigators that she had turned over all of her devices and all of her recorded emails. The discovery of a new device and thousands of new emails proves she lied to investigators and could be facing prison for doing so. (UPDATE: The FBI\u2019s warrant finally came through Sunday evening and they should begin combing through every email on the laptop soon.) \\nWhile the DOJ may be stonewalling the FBI for now, Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier explained that the FBI doesn\u2019t need a warrant because Weiner has already given them permission to search the computer. I emailed that 2 sources say Weiner is cooperating w/ FBI- & co-owned laptop. Also NY FBI had info 4 a few weeks- pressure was building https://t.co/AHbQVtvQzg \\nMore from the Daily Caller : \\nAdditionally, the U.S. Attorneys offices and local law enforcement have access to the FBI laboratory , for example, to conduct \u201cscientific examinations of evidence for any federal, state, and/or local law enforcement organization in the United States.\u201d \\n\u201cWith all of these law enforcement agencies, both local and federal, now looking into this case, it\u2019s a sign that they\u2019re really going after him,\u201d a law enforcement source told The NY Post back in September. \u201cThey want to nail him.\u201d \\nLess than two weeks ago, The Daily Mail reported that a federal grand jury was expected to hear the allegations against Weiner in the coming weeks. Weiner, as a result of the grand jury convening, already received a federal subpoena for his devices, as reported by CNN in September. The FBI confiscated Weiner\u2019s electronic devices on October 3, The New York Times reported . \\nWhat does it all mean? \\nThe FBI is going to get those emails, each and every one, the DOJ knows this, which means the only possible reason for belaboring the handoff to the FBI is to slow the course of the investigation ensuring that any new information is held until AFTER Election Day. This is corruption and election fraud of the highest order, coordinated by Obama\u2019s DOJ and executed by Attorney General Loretta Lynch. \\nArticle reposted with permission from Constitution.com Don't forget to Like Freedom Outpost on Facebook , Google Plus , & Twitter .
