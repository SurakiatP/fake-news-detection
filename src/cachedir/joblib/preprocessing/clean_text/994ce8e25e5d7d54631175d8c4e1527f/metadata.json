Trump on Wednesday called for the broad use of the contentious    policing strategy in America\u2019s cities, embracing an aggressive tactic whose legality has been challenged and whose enforcement has been abandoned in New York. His support for the polarizing   policy  \u2014   which involves officers\u2019 questioning and searching pedestrians  \u2014   collides with his highly visible courtship of   who have been disproportionately singled out by the tactic, data show. For Mr. Trump, the timing was especially inauspicious: It came as police shootings of black people were once again drawing scrutiny and protest. Mr. Trump has long championed    as a   tool in his hometown, New York, but on Wednesday he recommended that it be deployed in cities across the country that are struggling to control violence. It was the latest twist in Mr. Trump\u2019s awkward, and at times counterproductive, outreach to black voters, who polls suggest remain deeply skeptical of him  \u2014   and it occurred right after a prominent black supporter, Don King, used a racial epithet as he introduced Mr. Trump at a church in Cleveland Heights, Ohio. As Mr. King, the retired boxing promoter, sought to explain how society unfairly categorizes   he referred to a \u201cdancing and sliding and gliding nigger,\u201d before quickly correcting himself. \u201cI mean Negro,\u201d he said as Mr. Trump looked on a few feet behind him, grinning. Mr. Trump described his enthusiasm for    during a town   discussion, also in Cleveland Heights, after a voter pressed him on how he would reduce violence in black communities. \u201cOne of the things I\u2019d do,\u201d he said, \u201cis I would do   . I think you have to. We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive. \u201d The largely white audience erupted into applause.  During the event, hosted by Fox News, Mr. Trump suggested that    would work well in cities like Chicago, which has been convulsed by gun violence, and Cleveland. \u201cI see what\u2019s going on here, I see what\u2019s going on in Chicago,\u201d Mr. Trump said before praising the technique again as \u201cincredible. \u201d Black leaders reacted swiftly and harshly. \u201cThe idea of creating a national    policy is the equivalent of advancing martial law and is beyond the constitutional power of the presidency,\u201d Marc H. Morial, president of the National Urban League, said in an email. In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has overseen the dismantling of    as official police policy, said what Mr. Trump was proposing \u201cwill simply alienate the very people who we need to be partners in the fight against crime. \u201d \u201cHe does not understand how policing works,\u201d added Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat who is supporting Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump\u2019s Democratic rival for president.    has become a source of enormous tension between police officers and black residents in the cities that have deployed it as a   tool. Once credited with significantly reducing murders in urban centers like New York by removing weapons and drugs from the street, it has drawn protests and legal challenges. A federal judge in New York, Shira A. Scheindlin, struck down the tactic as unconstitutional in 2013, saying the way the city was using it violated the rights of minorities. About 83 percent of the stops in New York from 2004 to 2012 involved blacks and Hispanics, even though those two groups make up just slightly more than 50 percent of the city\u2019s residents. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg appealed the judge\u2019s ruling, but after Mr. de Blasio took office the Police Department repudiated the strategy and stopped using it. Mr. de Blasio, who dropped the appeal, has called it a \u201cbroken policy. \u201d Similar complaints dogged the use of    in Chicago, prompting the Police Department to make an unusual concession: It now allows an independent third party to monitor its use. Mr. Trump remains an unabashed fan of the tactic and has glossed over the legal and racial objections to its use for years. In 2013, after Judge Scheindlin\u2019s ruling, Mr. Trump took issue with those who would end the strategy. \u201cNYC politicians better stop pandering  \u2014   ending stop  frisk would be a disaster,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. As a presidential candidate, Mr. Trump has repeatedly praised the procedure as a proven approach for reducing crime, holding up New York City\u2019s experience as an example. \u201c   is a very positive thing,\u201d he said a few weeks ago. Mr. Trump is drawing historically low support from   according to several polls, and he has repeatedly stumbled in his attempts to appeal to them. He earned ridicule a few weeks ago when he told blacks that \u201cyou\u2019re living in your poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58 percent of your youth is unemployed  \u2014   what the hell do you have to lose?\u201d Wednesday was a chance for Mr. Trump to try a different approach, by speaking to black pastors. When asked about recent police shootings of black people in Tulsa, Okla. and Charlotte, N. C. he even seemed to fault the officer in the Tulsa case, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know what she was thinking, but I\u2019m very, very troubled by that. \u201d But Mr. Trump\u2019s choice of the    Mr. King to introduce him was unusual: Mr. King was convicted of manslaughter in 1966, though he was later pardoned he has been investigated for possible connections to organized crime and he has no political experience. He is best known for promoting many of boxing\u2019s   matches, like the 1974 \u201cRumble in the Jungle\u201d between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman in Zaire. Standing at the pulpit in the New Spirit Revival Center in Cleveland Heights on Wednesday morning, Mr. King quickly veered off course as he recalled conversations in which he counseled black celebrities about the realities of race in America. \u201cI told Michael Jackson, I said, \u2018If you are poor, you are a poor Negro  \u2014   I would use the N word  \u2014   if you are rich, you are a rich Negro,\u2019 \u201d Mr. King said. It was then that he seemed to slip up. \u201cIf you are a talented intellectual, you are an intellectual Negro. If you are a dancing and sliding and gliding nigger, I mean Negro,\u201d he said, as he chuckled briefly and those in the racially mixed crowd laughed nervously around him. A smile remained fixed on Mr. Trump\u2019s face. Beyond the walls of the church, reaction to the use of such an offensive word was quick and unforgiving. Barbara J. Holloway, 70, from Decatur, Ga. who is black, said Mr. King was \u201cjust playing into stereotypes and things that have hurt us in the past. \u201d \u201cInstead of him trying to bring us forward and be positive in front of Trump, he is trying to take us back,\u201d she said. It was, she added, \u201cout of line completely. \u201d A few hours later, Mrs. Holloway was frustrated but not surprised to hear what Mr. Trump had said about   . \u201cTo me, it\u2019s like you would be losing your freedom,\u201d she said. \u201cWe already don\u2019t have much value, it seems, and then now they want to say: \u2018O. K. ma\u2019am. Put your purse down. I think you got dope.\u2019 They would have no reason to stop and frisk me. \u201d She added, \u201cI expect nothing from Donald Trump that is really going to help me as a black American. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563564.2125874}
