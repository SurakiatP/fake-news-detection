Trump said in an interview broadcast on Sunday that he did not believe American intelligence assessments that Russia had intervened to help his candidacy, casting blame for the reports on Democrats, who he said were embarrassed about losing to him. \u201cI think it\u2019s ridiculous. I think it\u2019s just another excuse,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the interview, on \u201cFox News Sunday. \u201d \u201cI don\u2019t believe it. \u201d He also indicated that as president, he would not take the daily intelligence briefing that President Obama and his predecessors have received. Mr. Trump, who has received the briefing sparingly as   said that it was often repetitive and that he would take it \u201cwhen I need it. \u201d He said his vice president, Mike Pence, would receive the daily briefing. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m, like, a smart person,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have to be told the same thing in the same words every single day for the next eight years. \u201d He added that he had instructed the officials who give the briefing: \u201c\u2018If something should change from this point, immediately call me. I\u2019m available on a  \u2019s notice. \u2019\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s seeming dismissal of the importance of that daily interaction with intelligence agencies, as well as his claims of politically tainted intelligence reports on Russia, widened a breach between a   and the agencies he will have to rely on to carry out priorities like fighting terrorism and deterring cyberattacks. His stance on the issue is also putting him increasingly at odds with senior lawmakers on Capitol Hill, including members of his own party, who say that the evidence of Russian interference is clear and warrants a congressional investigation. The Obama administration reached a consensus months ago that Russia was trying to meddle in the election. After initially believing that Russia\u2019s goal was to undermine American democratic processes, the intelligence agencies concluded a week after the vote that the Russian efforts had been intended, at least in their latter stages, to help Mr. Trump. The   said those new reports were politically motivated. \u201cI think the Democrats are putting it out because they suffered one of the greatest defeats in the history of politics in this country,\u201d he said in the interview, recorded on Saturday. During the campaign, he also dismissed suggestions of Russian meddling. Pressed about why he did not believe the intelligence agencies\u2019 conclusions, Mr. Trump said there was disagreement among intelligence agencies about the extent and the origin of the hacking. \u201cThey\u2019re fighting among themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not sure. \u201d The Washington Post and The New York Times reported on Friday that American intelligence agencies had concluded that Russia took covert action during the campaign to harm the candidacy of Hillary Clinton. The new conclusion, The Times reported, was based in part on evidence found by the C. I. A. that Russian hackers had penetrated the Republican National Committee\u2019s computer system, as well as that of the Democrats and several of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s senior aides, but had leaked only Democratic correspondence. Mr. Trump\u2019s transition office responded to those reports with a statement on Friday night dismissing the intelligence agencies as \u201cthe same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. \u201d The office said it was time to \u201cmove on\u201d from the election. The Iraq case has been the subject of a   debate over whether the intelligence was tainted or whether the Bush White House read it selectively to support its decision to go to war. On the subject of Russian interference, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said Sunday that it would be dangerous to dismiss the issue as a matter of partisan politics. He urged Mr. Trump to accept the agencies\u2019 conclusions, and called on his colleagues to move forward with an investigation. \u201cYou can\u2019t make this issue partisan it\u2019s too important,\u201d Mr. McCain said on the CBS program \u201cFace the Nation. \u201d \u201cA fundamental of democracy is a free and fair election. \u201d Referring to the hacking, Mr. McCain added, \u201cThe Russians have been using it as a tool as part of Vladimir Putin\u2019s ambition to regain Russian prominence and dominance in some parts of the world. \u201d Mr. McCain was among a bipartisan group of four senior lawmakers, including the coming minority leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, who issued a statement Sunday pledging to work to respond to the incursions. The statement adds pressure to Republicans, who control Congress, to investigate the hacking. \u201cDemocrats and Republicans must work together, and across the jurisdictional lines of the Congress, to examine these recent incidents thoroughly and devise comprehensive solutions to deter and defend against further cyberattacks,\u201d the statement said. Several senators, including Rand Paul of Kentucky and James Lankford of Oklahoma, both Republicans, expressed support for such an investigation on Sunday. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, did not comment on the issue over the weekend, but he was expected to address it in a news conference scheduled for Monday morning. Mr. McCain said on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that he would like to see a select committee formed to look into the C. I. A. \u2019s conclusions, but that in the meantime, an armed services subcommittee under his control would \u201cgo to work on it. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564568.8373618}
