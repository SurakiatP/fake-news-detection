The petition reached well over 100,000 signatures as of Friday night.\\nThe petition\u2019s supporters want to make sure Congress convenes to ban those machines by November. Lifezette first reported that the machines could be linked to Soros, by asserting the man that owns that sold the machines serves the board of the Open Societies Foundation, a board led by Soros.\\n\u201cThis man has been linked to a person\u2019s campaign who is running in the election and has a clear bias to one candidate. His ownership of voting machines in 16 states is a clear breach of integrity of our electoral system,\u201d the petition states. The machines were tied to Soros by The Epoch Times, which reported the company that sold the machines is owned by a Soros ally.\\nBusiness Insider reported Tuesday, that notions of Soros controlling the machines is false, because Soros doesn\u2019t have a controlling interest in the company that sold the machines, claiming that the 16 states to purchase the machines don\u2019t plan to use them in the 2016 general election.\\nThis amount of signatures make it clear that a large amount of people have a lot distrust in the current election system.\\nRELATED BREAKING: The NEW Election FEC Violation That Should End Clinton\u2019s Campaign .
