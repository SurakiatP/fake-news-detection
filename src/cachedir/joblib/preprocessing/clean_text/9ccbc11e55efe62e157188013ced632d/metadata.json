The Cubs have not won the World Series since 1908, nor have they qualified for one since 1945. In Chicago and beyond, by the legions, people think the explanation must come from the supernatural. There is talk of a certain billy goat. You might have to live here to understand. Once again, the Cubs are in the playoffs. They had the best   record in the major leagues, which has made them the talk of the baseball world as well as the favorites to win this year\u2019s World Series. This might make other teams and their fans ecstatic. Yet in Chicago, there is a thinly veiled, repressed gloom that comes with having had your heart broken so often. People cope with the postseason tension in different ways. Carol Haddon, a lifelong fan, offered perspective. \u201cMy basement has flooded way too often  \u2014   that\u2019s sad,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Cubs failing to win the World Series when I sense an honest effort? No, I\u2019m not going be overly dejected about that. \u201d Jon Lester, a Cubs pitcher, has sought to own the curse, insisting his teammates confront it and talk about it. \u201cThere is nothing for us to run from,\u201d he said. A beer vendor at Chicago\u2019s Wrigley Field looks around and notices some   no longer occupying their seats. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d the vendor, Rocco Caputo, said. \u201cThey passed away, and I know they never got to see a World Series win. \u201d Will this be the year? A sampling of the people caught up in the exhilaration and strain of the 2016 season: Carol Haddon, a Cubs   holder for 45 years, has a transistor radio affixed to the wall of the home dugout in front of her   seat. She keeps score of every game and lauds Cubs fans for weathering more than a century of postseason futility. \u201cWe are not loser fans,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are optimistic fans. I choose not to carry the losses on my back. I choose to look at the bright side of things. That\u2019s an attribute. \u201d Haddon first bought her season tickets when they cost $3. 50 a game, or roughly $285 for the season. That was in 1971, when the Cubs drew only about 10, 000 fans to most games. (This year, they have averaged nearly 40, 000 a game.) Haddon remembers the ballpark was sometimes so quiet that a fan could hear the infielders chatting in the middle of an inning. And fans would routinely join in on those conversations. Haddon, a former schoolteacher who said she is in her early 70s, has attended at least 2, 000 games at Wrigley Field and become so close to Cubs players that they have been houseguests and accompanied her to high school softball games to root for her daughter. \u201cIt was all so informal then  \u2014   that was before the WGN effect,\u201d Haddon said. WGN, a division of the Tribune Company, which owned the Cubs at the time, was one of cable television\u2019s first superstations, making its debut in 1978 on fledgling cable systems nationwide. Cubs games  \u2014   including 81 played in the daytime at Wrigley, which did not have lights until 1988  \u2014   were beamed across the country, making the Cubs a kind of second home team for some. In places without major league teams, the Cubs were adopted as the home team. Nearly 40 years later, the Cubs can genuinely say they have a nation of fans. And hundreds of thousands of them make frequent pilgrimages to Wrigley Field, where tickets are in high demand. Haddon, who last week wore Cubs earrings, a Cubs pullover and white shoes decorated with the kind of red stitching used on a baseball, never puts her two tickets for sale on secondary ticket markets like StubHub. Her two children and various friends come to games with her. Saturday night games are always date nights with her husband, Jimmy. There has been plenty to despair, but the one time Haddon struggled to keep her sunny disposition was during the 1984 National League Championship Series, when the Cubs were one victory from making it to the World Series, then were eliminated with three consecutive defeats in San Diego. An error by the star Cubs first baseman Leon Durham  \u2014   the ball trickled under his glove and through his legs  \u2014   led to San Diego\u2019s surprising comeback in the final game. As usual for a Cubs postseason defeat, there were shadowy circumstances that led to the last, crushing loss. Before the game, Durham\u2019s first baseman\u2019s mitt was accidentally doused with Gatorade, making it sticky and gluey. Flustered, he considered using another glove but decided against it, a decision Cubs fans have lamented ever since. Durham\u2019s mitt may have, in essence, been stuck shut as he was trying to snare a crucial ground ball. Haddon was at the game in San Diego. \u201cThat\u2019s the only time the Cubs really, really made me cry,\u201d she said last week. \u201cWhen I got off the plane coming home and saw my husband, I started crying. \u201d But Haddon has been confident approaching this year\u2019s playoffs. Even if she feels the fear around her, especially because the Cubs have the best record in the majors. \u201cEveryone is a little afraid to be so excited,\u201d she said, sitting in her princely seats with her feet propped on the Cubs\u2019 dugout during a   weekend day game. \u201cWe\u2019re all afraid. Well, I\u2019m not afraid, because I believe we will win. We should win. We\u2019re the best team in baseball. \u201d Pitcher Jon Lester spent nine seasons with the Boston Red Sox, watching as a city and a region burdened by decades of dispiriting postseason losses had its championship renaissance. In his second season as a Cub, Lester cannot help seeing the similarities between Chicago and Boston. \u201cIn Boston, no matter how good the Patriots, Celtics or Bruins are, it\u2019s sort of a Red Sox town,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel the same thing is true in Chicago. No matter how good any other team is, it always comes back to the Cubs. \u201d Lester has also assessed the two fan bases and sees considerable differences. \u201cEast Coast versus the Midwest,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the full,       type of city and fan as you get in Boston. Here, everybody is a little slower, a little more  . But the passion is still there. Both ballparks are packed every night, and everybody is yelling. \u201d While much of the Cubs\u2019 roster was built with shrewd acquisitions of young talent, Lester was perhaps the final pivotal piece added when he spurned multiple other suitors, most notably the Red Sox, to sign a   contract before the 2015 season worth $155 million. He was rejoining the architects of Boston\u2019s multiple championships: the Cubs\u2019 president for baseball operations, Theo Epstein, and General Manager Jed Hoyer. Lester brought with him the gravitas of a   World Series pitching record and a 0. 43 earned run average in those games. There were other bonds to his Boston days. Lester is one of two cancer survivors in the Cubs\u2019 clubhouse. In 2006, he was told he had a form of  \u2019s lymphoma, but returned to win the game that clinched the World Series for the Red Sox in 2007. Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo was told he had Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma in 2008, when he was an    Red Sox minor leaguer. Lester and Rizzo first met in the Boston clubhouse shortly after Rizzo received the diagnosis, with Lester offering his counsel on how to approach the chemotherapy and the mental challenges of confronting the disease. Eight years later, they have been reunited as Cubs and have developed a     bond. Lester had a   record this season, the best winning percentage for a National League pitcher. Rizzo is a leading candidate for the league\u2019s Most Valuable Player Award after slugging 31 home runs and driving in 101 runs. All around the Cubs\u2019 clubhouse, Lester has become a seasoned, valued voice, perhaps because of his Boston experiences or maybe because Lester had to overcome so much more off the field. But he is not reluctant to discuss the subject that never goes away in Chicago: the Cubs\u2019 curse. \u201cI\u2019ve told the guys we have to talk about it, because you can\u2019t stick it in the back corner of a dark room and never acknowledge it,\u201d Lester said, standing at his locker. \u201cThat\u2019s how bad things creep in. This city has waited a long, long time. For whatever reason  \u2014   a goat or a black cat  \u2014   things haven\u2019t worked out. \u201cBut we\u2019ve talked about wanting to be the team that wins the World Series  \u2014   a Cubs World Series. \u201d Lester looked across the team\u2019s clubhouse, toward the long, serpentine footpath that leads to the home dugout and the cozy grounds of Wrigley Field, built six years after the Cubs\u2019 last World Series victory. \u201cThere is a reality that we are facing,\u201d Lester said. \u201cIt is the team\u2019s history. But history gets updated all the time. \u201d A mime once came to lead the Cubs\u2019 pregame stretching drills. A player rode his bike from his home to the ballpark like a Little Leaguer, in complete uniform. Another day, the team stepped onto the field to find live bear cubs frolicking in the grass. All the shenanigans came from the fertile, experimental mind of Cubs Manager Joe Maddon, a grizzled and usually   former scout, minor league hitting coach and manager and   coach who waited 31 years to be put at the helm of a   club. Before the 2015 season, when he was 60 years old, Maddon agreed to become the Cubs\u2019 manager and shoulder the weight of history that came with the job. The new sheriff in town gave his team a set of nonmarching orders. As he described them last week: \u201cI don\u2019t have any rules or regulations other than I want you to run hard to first base and I want the pitchers to work on their defense. There are no dress codes I think they\u2019re nonsensical. The concept of being late is overblown. You can\u2019t really be late for anything. \u201d In less than two years, Maddon\u2019s freethinking philosophy has elevated him to   status in Chicago, where his   preachings are emblazoned on   sold all over the city. John Baranowski, a    longtime Cubs fan, was wearing one of Maddon\u2019s signature   that read \u201cDo Simple Better\u201d as he prepared to enter Wrigley Field last week. Baranowski likened Maddon to a baseball swami delivered to Wrigley by divine intervention to reverse the Cubs\u2019 curse. \u201cIs there anyone better to fix an insanely      situation than a guy who lives to defy what people say is supposed to happen?\u201d Baranowski said. \u201cThis is the perfect guy. He doesn\u2019t care about the stupid curse. \u201d Maddon, whose   record with the Cubs is   may have saved his most important, if atypical, managerial ploy when it comes to the famed curse. He refuses to shy from it. At Wrigley Field, he had a wall leading from the team\u2019s clubhouse to the dugout inscribed with this Maddon maxim: \u201cDon\u2019t let the pressure exceed the pleasure. \u201d Maddon is not going to allow more than a century of postseason despair to ruin his good time. \u201cFor me, the word \u2018pressure\u2019 should be an absolute positive and not a negative, because if people are throwing that pressure out at you, that means there\u2019s really something good attached to whatever you\u2019re trying to accomplish,\u201d he said. \u201cPressure lives in the future, not the present tense. If you can live in the moment, then you can enjoy the pleasure of it. \u201d Sitting at his office desk beneath the Wrigley Field grandstand, Maddon shook his head. \u201cListen, I\u2019ve wanted to do this since I was 6 years old, and now I\u2019m going to get here and be miserable?\u201d he said. \u201cNo, man, I don\u2019t get that way of thinking at all. \u201d Rocco Caputo has tramped up and down the stairs at Cubs games for 33 years, a smiling, wisecracking fixture at Wrigley Field, a place called \u201cthe friendly confines\u201d for its cheery atmosphere. But there is a hidden melancholy, like a family secret never discussed. It reveals itself when the Cubs are in the postseason. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of crying that nobody likes to talk about,\u201d Caputo said as he stood in a narrow aisle in Wrigley\u2019s lower deck last week. \u201cIt\u2019s there in the stands. \u201d Caputo was selling beer behind home plate in 2003 during what was probably the most tormenting bad break in a Cubs playoff run. In the eighth inning of Game 6 during that year\u2019s National League Championship Series, the Cubs had a   lead and were five outs from a victory that would send them to the World Series when Steve Bartman, a longtime fan of the team sitting along the railing of the   stands, interfered with a foul fly ball that might have been caught by a Cubs outfielder. The incident set in motion a series of   misplays and quirky bounces that could only happen to the Cubs, who lost that game and Game 7 the next day. Caputo looked into the eyes of his customers that night. \u201cI saw the hurt,\u201d he said. With the Cubs eliminated, Caputo finished counting his beer sales cash and dashed from Wrigley Field to begin the   walk home. Instead, he walked for miles in the opposite direction. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to go home,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know where I was going. I felt like jumping in Lake Michigan. I just walked for like an hour. \u201d Unlike some Cubs fans, he does not blame Bartman, but unlike some Cubs fans, he is willing to admit to some kind of Cubs hex. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a curse and we\u2019ve got to get rid of it,\u201d Caputo said. \u201cA lot of people have been coming here for years, and it\u2019s getting hard. \u201cMost of us have been waiting our whole lives. I\u2019m 49. I\u2019m helping all I can. I cheer my heart out. I sell the beer. \u201d In 2009, when the Ricketts family was getting ready to buy the Cubs, occasionally someone would ask Tom Ricketts: Aren\u2019t you worried about aligning yourself with a franchise best known for not winning the World Series? Ricketts had a much bigger fear. He was nervous that the Cubs, who had decent teams back then, might win the World Series before he could buy the team. Ricketts, who was making the bid for the Cubs along with his two brothers, sister and parents, wondered if his family would want to own the Cubs without the World Series drought. \u201cIt\u2019s much better to be part of the quest for a championship than to be coming in after the goal has been accomplished,\u201d Ricketts said last week. \u201cOur question was: If they win the World Series, do we care anymore?\u201d The Ricketts family, whose fortune derives from TD Ameritrade, the brokerage founded by the patriarch Joseph Ricketts, need not have worried that the Cubs would shatter its hopes. As soon as the Rickettses took charge, the Cubs fell apart, losing an average of about 93 games during the next five seasons. Ricketts, the ownership\u2019s public face, was nearly an everyday presence at Wrigley Field during those seasons, as he is now, making himself available to fans as he walks through the concourses at almost every home game. He often rides a commuter train to his downtown Chicago office, where he also runs an investment banking company he created in 1999. Raised in Nebraska and a Cubs fan since he went to college in Chicago  \u2014   he and his brother once lived across the street from Wrigley Field  \u2014   he is one of the most accessible team owners in American sports. \u201cWhen we were losing 101 games one season, everyone assumes I walked through Wrigley and had everyone yelling at me,\u201d he said. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the case at all. Every once in a while, there would be somebody who didn\u2019t understand our plan, but we could buy them a beer and try to explain. \u201d The plan was to turn all the baseball decisions over to Epstein, the president for baseball operations, who gutted the Cubs, several times trading away most of the team\u2019s older starting pitchers for young, undeveloped talent, to build a sustainable core for the future. With the Cubs now the favorites to win World Series, Ricketts hears fans saying they wished the Cubs were backing into the playoffs instead  \u2014   there is less pressure that way. Ricketts snickered and said, \u201cThere are a lot of people here who have a lot of time to overthink all those angles. \u201d Never mind that no team has ever been so vexed by so many curious setbacks and omens, many with such rich, colorful names and narratives. A fan, Billy Sianis, and his pet goat were ejected from Wrigley Field during the 1945 World Series. Sianis vowed that the Cubs would never again win baseball\u2019s championship because of the insult. The Cubs lost in seven games and have yet to return to the World Series. Hence, the celebrated curse of the billy goat. There was also a prancing black cat preceding a 1969   collapse. Ricketts would not hear any of it. He shook his head side to side when the Cubs\u2019 many bizarre postseason outcomes were recounted to him. \u201cWe had a lot of bad teams, and when we had good teams, we had a lot of bad luck,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we just have to accept that. That\u2019s the truth. But there is no curse. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564262.4760692}
