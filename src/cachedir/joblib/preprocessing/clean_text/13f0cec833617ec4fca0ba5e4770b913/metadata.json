The Jan. 18, 2015, email was included in Wikileaks\u2019 latest batch of communications to and from Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign chairman, John Podesta. \\nThe email from Huma Abedin, Clinton\u2019s Deputy Chief of Staff at the State Department, was addressed to Podesta and campaign manager Robby Mook. Hillary Clinton was a director of the foundation at the time. \\nSingapore and Hong Kong officials reportedly were also vying to convene the CGI meeting in their countries, but the North African nation ultimately hosted it in a five-star hotel in Marrakesh, Morocco, in 2015. Abedin told Podesta and Mook that Morocco was not CGI\u2019s \u201cfirst choice.\u201d \\nThe actual meeting was paid for by OCP, the Moroccan-government-owned mining company that has been accused of serious human rights violations. Clinton vigorously supported the Moroccan King when she was Secretary of State and the U.S.-financed Export-Import Bank gave OCP a $92 million loan guarantee during her tenure as Secretary of State. \\nThe mining company also contributed between $5 million to $10 million to the Clinton Foundation, according to the charity\u2019s web site.Abedin described the arrangement in the email as having been organized by her boss. Hillary Clinton \u201ccreated this mess and she knows it,\u201d she told Podesta and Mook.She said the Moroccan deal was entirely dreamed up by her boss. \u201cThis was HRC\u2019s idea, our office approached the Moroccans and they 100 percent believe they are doing this at her request. The King has personally committed approx. $12 million both for the endowment and to support the meeting.\u201d HRC stands for Hillary Rodham Clinton. \\nAbedin said Clinton\u2019s attendance at the CGI event was a condition of the $12 million contribution. \u201cJust to give you some context, the condition upon which the Moroccans agreed to host the meeting was her participation. If hrc was not part if it, meeting was a non-starter,\u201d Abedin said. \\nPolitico in 2015 reported that Clinton \u201cwas seen by Rabat as among its most ardent supporters in the Obama administration.\u201d Rabat is the capital of Morocco. \\nThe Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice charged OCP with \u201cserious human rights violations,\u201d including exploitation of workers by not \u201cadequately compensating the impoverished people who live there.\u201d \\nMohamed Yeslem Beisat, the Washington envoy for the Polisaro Front, as reported by AL-Monitor, a Middle East news site in 2015 that \u201cOCP is the first beneficiary of the war and the first beneficiary of the occupation \u2014 it is the one that is cashing in on the misery of thousands of refugees and hundreds of political detainees for the past 40 years.\u201d \\nPolisaro claims to lead a Moroccan government-in-exile based in Tindouf, Algeria. \\n\u201cThey\u2019re doing this because they know Hillary has some chances of being president of the United States. And they want her to support their brutal occupation of Western Sahara,\u201d Beisat charged. \\nThe Moroccan firm mines phosphates. Human rights critics have called OCP\u2019s mining product \u201cblood phosphates,\u201d appropriating the term \u201cblood diamonds\u201d for gems mined in operations that kill and injure local workers \\nOCP is not the only mining company linked to human rights violations that has donated to the Clinton Foundation. The foundation accepted a $100 million pledge from Lukas Lundin, who owns mining and oil drilling operations in North Africa and in the Congo.

He was also President Bill Clinton\u2019s ambassador to the European Union, a Deputy Secretary of the Treasury and Under Secretary at the Department of Commerce. \\nEizenstat specialized in foreign trade issues at Commerce where he worked in the International Trade Administration. \\nHillary Clinton officially visited Morocco twice, in November 2009 and in February 2012, meeting with the King on both occasions. The two also met in New York in December 2013 where it was believed the two discussed Morocco\u2019s bid to host the CGI meeting and the King\u2019s $12 million donation. \\nThe Moroccan World News described the meeting as showing \u201crenewed friendship between the royal family and the Clinton family, as well as Hillary Clinton\u2019s esteem for Morocco and its people.\u201d \\nAbedin warned both campaign executives that if CGI decided to renege on the agreement, it would hurt Clinton\u2019s relationship with the King. \u201cIt will break a lot of china to back out now,\u201d she wrote. \\nUltimately, Clinton did not attend the meeting because it was close to the launch of her presidential campaign, but the former president and daughter Chelsea were present and during the conference were guests at one of the Moroccan King\u2019s palaces.'"}, "time": 1742563763.4710426}
