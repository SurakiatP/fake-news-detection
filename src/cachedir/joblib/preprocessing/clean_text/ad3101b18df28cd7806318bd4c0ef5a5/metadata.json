Just when you start to think that there is nothing more Obama could say to become more a dirt bag than he\u2019s already proven himself to be, he goes and pulls something OFF THE CHARTS stupid! \\nIn his efforts to push Hillary into the White House he spoke at a recent rally for her. What he had to say, was an insult to American men. \\nSee for yourself! \\nHe says he wants to be honest? He lacks the integrity to do so. So basically when men don\u2019t vote for Hillary, it\u2019s not because they are intelligent enough to recognize she is a corrupt snake whose greed and hunger for money and power will leave our country hanging by a string. It\u2019s not because they have a mind to think for themselves and decide whether she\u2019s the person for the job or not. \\nNope\u2026according to Obama, it\u2019s because American men are racist. \\nInfuriating..isn\u2019t it? \\nIt\u2019s just too much stupid, and we all know we shouldn\u2019t engage with it because it will drag us down to its\u2019 level and destroy us with experience in stupidity\u2026but still. \\nSometimes I wish we could mute the stupid. Just long enough to regain our sanity back to endure through it. \\nWhat an idiot.'"}, "time": 1742562001.5265443}
