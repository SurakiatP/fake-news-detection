Tom Booker met church-goer Wayne Hayes when he started working in his office, and has expressed his surprise that he \u2018really couldn\u2019t tell\u2019. Booker said: \u201cWe often end up in the kitchen at the same time to make a cup of tea, so we started exchanging pleasantries and worked up to longer conversations. \u201cHe was always nice enough and talked about his family and allotment and stuff, so I presumed he was just a normal person. However, a few weeks later he mentioned something about believing in God. \u201cI was really shocked, but he seemed very cool about it. I asked if he thought it was just a phase and he said no, he\u2019d been feeling this way since he was about nine. \u201cI wanted to ask him what Christians actually do in church, but I got worried that he might think I\u2019m secretly into it and try to recruit me. He hasn\u2019t mentioned it since. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if it\u2019s a perfectly acceptable way to live your life, which has really given me pause for thought. \u201cJust because you expect someone to be a massively judgemental dickhead, it doesn\u2019t mean they will be.\u201d \\nShare:'"}, "time": 1742561741.8527348}
