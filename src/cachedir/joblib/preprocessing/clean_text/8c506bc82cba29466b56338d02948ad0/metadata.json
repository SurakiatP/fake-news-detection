In the end, in a strange and profoundly American collision of polarized politics,   sports, commerce and the culture wars, North Carolina\u2019s notorious House Bill 2 was finally laid to rest on Thursday  \u2014   though many were left wondering if some of its negative effects might linger. Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, signed legislation repealing the law after it was approved by the   legislature. House Bill 2 had restricted the ability of municipalities to enact   policies and required transgender people in government and public buildings to use the bathroom that corresponds with the gender on their birth certificate. In addition to repealing House Bill 2, the new law gives the General Assembly the sole power to regulate access to \u201cmultiple occupancy restrooms, showers or changing facilities. \u201d It also creates a moratorium on local nondiscrimination ordinances through 2020. The compromise agreement came amid a looming threat that the N. C. A. A. which had already relocated a year\u2019s worth of championship tournament games from the state, was planning to eliminate more, including future men\u2019s Division I basketball tournaments. It was met with bitter criticism from gay rights groups, which said it was barely a repeal at all, and from conservatives, who said it backtracked on protecting public safety and traditional values. In a news conference on Thursday, Mr. Cooper said that the agreement would begin undoing the economic damage and that both sports events and economic development would begin coming back to the state. This week, The Associated Press calculated that North Carolina stood to lose more than $3. 7 billion over the next dozen years if House Bill 2 were not repealed. \u201cThis is not a perfect deal and it is not my preferred solution it stops short of many things we need to do as a state,\u201d Mr. Cooper said. \u201cIn a perfect world, with a good General Assembly, we would have repealed HB2 fully today, and added full statewide protections for L. G. B. T. North Carolinians. \u201d Still, it remained to be seen if the deal would now lift what Mr. Cooper has called \u201cthe dark cloud hanging over our state. \u201d The N. C. A. A. president, Mark Emmert, said on Thursday that the league\u2019s governing board would soon determine whether the changed law was \u201csufficient\u201d for \u201cthe board to feel comfortable going back to North Carolina. \u201d The National Basketball Association, which relocated its most recent   Game to New Orleans to protest House Bill 2, did not reply to a request seeking comment. The Atlantic Coast Conference, which pulled recent league championships out of the state, indicated that it would take a fresh look at North Carolina. \u201cThe recently passed legislation allows the opportunity to reopen the discussion with the A. C. C. Council of Presidents regarding neutral site conference championships being held in the State of North Carolina,\u201d John Swofford, the commissioner, said. PayPal, which in April had canceled an expansion in Charlotte over its concerns about the law, did not respond to a request for comment. A number of celebrities and organizations that had announced they were boycotting the state since the law\u2019s passage one year ago had not commented on the repeal on social media. Pope McCorkle III, a public policy professor at Duke, called the deal an \u201cawkward compromise. \u201d He said it would ultimately be judged by how many of the sports events, entertainers and businesses who had turned on the state would eventually change their minds. \u201cThere could be a split among the outside arbiters about whether this is good enough,\u201d he said. \u201cThe deal is only as good as what it achieves in terms of the change in economic development perceptions nationally. \u201d It appeared that the threat of losing even more   basketball games had much to do with the breakthrough. The agreement comes on the eve of basketball\u2019s Final Four weekend, with the University of North Carolina men\u2019s team facing off against Oregon on Saturday night in Glendale, Ariz. Looming even larger, perhaps, was the broader threat of sustained business boycotts. Yet despite these stakes, and in a sign of the deep fissures that continue to run through both the state and the nation, there was little celebration when the law finally died. On Thursday, the American Civil Liberties Union and Lambda Legal, a gay rights group, called the compromise a \u201cfake\u201d repeal bill that \u201ckeeps in place the most harmful parts of the law. \u201d The Human Rights Campaign and other gay rights groups called the deal \u201cshameful\u201d and accused the governor and the legislature of engaging in a \u201csell out\u201d of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. Some religious and cultural conservatives denounced the removal of transgender bathroom provisions. Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, based in Washington, said the compromise showed that \u201celected officials are ultimately willing to surrender to the courts and the N. C. A. A. on matters of safety and public policy. \u201d Others argued that girls and women would be robbed of privacy and dignity if forced to confront biological men in restrooms. Gay rights advocates said that the moratorium on local   ordinances, combined with the absence of a statewide   law addressing sexual orientation and gender identity, would leave lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people at risk of continued discrimination. \u201cThat, to me, is astonishing, that we\u2019re going to make L. G. B. T. people wait another four years to be protected from being fired because they\u2019re gay,\u201d said Chris Fitzsimon, director of NC Policy Watch, a liberal group. There appeared to be some disagreement about the freedom that local governments would have to pass protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people under the new law. Mr. Cooper said that local governments were now free to \u201cpass protections for their L. G. B. T. employees. \u201d Cathryn Oakley, senior legislative counsel for the Human Rights Campaign, said she did not believe that was the case. \u201cI don\u2019t think the language supports that,\u201d she said. Under the new law, transgender people in state government buildings will not be prohibited from using a bathroom that does not match the gender on their birth certificate. Mr. Cooper emphasized the impact on school children. \u201cNow transgender kids aren\u2019t subject to the horrible requirement and embarrassment that could put them in more danger of being bullied or preyed on,\u201d he said. The   Justice Department had issued guidelines to public schools stating that denying students the ability to use the restrooms of their choice violated Title IX, the 1972 federal law that prohibits sex discrimination in education. A Virginia case that might have settled the matter was scheduled to be heard by the United States Supreme Court, but when President Trump\u2019s Justice Department rescinded the guidelines, the justices in March sent it back to a lower court to decide. Jane Wettach, a law professor at Duke, said that beyond schools, few institutions had ever policed people\u2019s bathroom choices. \u201cWhich is what made the law sort of symbolic,\u201d she said, referring to House Bill 2. House Bill 2 has already dealt a major political blow to the Republican Party in North Carolina, with the backlash helping Mr. Cooper defeat former Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican, by a   margin in November. Time will tell if Mr. Cooper retains the support of disappointed gay rights advocates on the left wing of his coalition. National gay rights groups could also see a perceived loss of clout if the N. C. A. A. and other sports organizations ignore their continued protests and decide to play ball in the state. If the costly drama in North Carolina serves as a cautionary tale to other   states looking to take up such volatile social issues, only some appear to have heeded it. On Thursday in Texas, some conservatives reiterated their support for a bill that would revise the laws regulating bathroom use in government buildings. The bill has been approved by the State Senate. But according to The Texas Tribune, it may not survive in the House. The Tribune reported that Texas businesses were worried the proposal could cost them \u201chundreds of millions of dollars\u201d in revenue.'"}, "time": 1742562690.9312773}
