Speaking in Warsaw at the conclusion of a security summit meeting with European leaders, Mr. Obama said the United States had suffered \u201ca tough week,\u201d but he pledged to try to build upon good will among protesters and police officers alike. \u201cThere is sorrow, there is anger, there is confusion about next steps,\u201d Mr. Obama said at the start of a news conference. \u201cBut there is unity in recognizing that this is not how we want our communities to operate. This is not who we want to be as Americans. \u201d The president said he would visit Dallas early next week to pay homage to the police officers who were killed there. And he said he would invite activists, police officials and others to the White House next week to seek \u201cconstructive actions that are actually going to make a difference. \u201d Mr. Obama acknowledged that the killings had unleashed some harsh speech, and he urged people of all points of view to be careful in how they express their opinions. But he said he believed that most people were simply saddened by the lives lost. \u201cWhen we start suggesting that somehow there is this enormous polarization and we\u2019re back to the situation in the 1960s  \u2014   that\u2019s just not true,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cYou\u2019re not seeing riots, and you\u2019re not seeing police going after people who are protesting peacefully. \u201d Asked to comment on how he will be remembered for dealing with racial issues, Mr. Obama said he would prefer to leave that question to historians. But he then continued to discuss, with some emotion, how he has sought to confront the divisive issue. He said he has tried to speak honestly about race in ways that he hoped would help people reach solutions. \u201cMore than anything, what I hope is that my voice has tried to get all of us as Americans to understand the difficult legacy of race,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cIf my voice has been true, and positive, then my hope would be that it may not fix everything right away, but it surfaces problems, it frames them, it allows us to wrestle with these issues,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019d like to think that, as best as I could, I have been true in speaking about these issues. \u201d Mr. Obama deflected questions about the motives of the man who shot the police officers in Dallas. But he said whatever the motive might have been, people should not assume that the gunman speaks for Americans protesting police killings or anyone else. He said that the white individual who is charged in the shooting of nine black parishioners in South Carolina did not represent the views of all white Americans. And Mr. Obama said that people should not make the assumption that a \u201ctroubled Muslim individual\u201d who engages in a shooting represents all Muslims. \u201cI think the danger is that we somehow suggest that the act of a troubled individual speaks to some larger political statement across the country,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t. \u201d The president also defended his mention of the need for new gun laws in the hours after the shooting in Dallas. He said the easy availability of guns in America was \u201ca contributing factor\u201d to the country\u2019s gun violence. Critics have charged that Mr. Obama should not have raised what they say is a political issue in the moments after the shooting, calling it an insult to the memory of those killed and to the families of the dead who were still in the early stages of mourning. The president rejected that accusation and vowed to continue talking about the issue. \u201cPart of what\u2019s creating tensions between communities and police is the fact that police have a really difficult time in communities where they know guns are everywhere,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to stop talking about it. \u201d The president noted that violent crime in the United States is significantly lower now than it has been in decades. But he acknowledged that people\u2019s fears are understandable, especially in the wake of a terrorist attack or a gruesome killing captured on video. \u201cWe should never be satisfied when any innocent person is killed,\u201d he said, \u201cbut that is not something that should be driving our anxieties, relative to where we have been in the past. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564536.5987556}
