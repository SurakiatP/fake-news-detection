Trump, who said last week that a judge\u2019s Mexican heritage should disqualify him from a lawsuit against Mr. Trump, expressed doubt on Sunday that a Muslim judge could remain neutral in the case, comments that are unlikely to ease concerns among his fellow Republicans who fear his controversial remarks could hurt the party in November. Mr. Trump\u2019s comments, made in an interview with John Dickerson, the host of CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d followed his criticism of Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel, a federal judge in California overseeing a suit against the defunct Trump University. Mr. Trump said Judge Curiel had a \u201cconflict of interest\u201d in the case because of Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed border wall with Mexico. Republicans, concerned about how his contentious statements could harm their ability to retain control of the Senate and have a detrimental effect in   races, have struggled with how to distance themselves from Mr. Trump\u2019s language without alienating his   voters. In a series of interviews on Sunday television news shows, Republicans repudiated Mr. Trump\u2019s comments about Judge Curiel. But instead of softening his stance, Mr. Trump intensified it. Mr. Dickerson asked Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, if a Muslim judge would be similarly biased because of Mr. Trump\u2019s call for a ban on Muslim immigrants. \u201cIt\u2019s possible, yes,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cYeah. That would be possible. Absolutely. \u201d When Mr. Dickerson said there was a tradition in the United States, a nation of immigrants, against judging people based on heritage, Mr. Trump replied, \u201cI\u2019m not talking about tradition, I\u2019m talking about common sense, O. K.?\u201d In his interview with Mr. Dickerson, and in a separate discussion with Jake Tapper on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d Mr. Trump refused to retreat from his comments on Judge Curiel\u2019s background. \u201cHe is a member of a club or society, very strongly   which is all fine,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cBut I say he\u2019s got bias. I want to build a wall. I\u2019m going to build a wall. I\u2019m doing very well with the Latinos, with the Hispanics, with the Mexicans, I\u2019m doing very well with them, in my opinion. \u201d Judge Curiel, 62, was born in East Chicago, Ind. to parents who had emigrated from Mexico. He graduated from Indiana University\u2019s law school and worked as an assistant United States attorney in the Southern District of California before being appointed in 2007 to the bench in San Diego by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican. President Obama nominated Judge Curiel to the federal bench in late 2011, and he was confirmed by the Senate in 2012. Mr. Trump\u2019s broadside against Judge Curiel was one of the most overtly racial remarks he had made in the presidential race, and it exacerbated the tension between some Republicans and their nominee. White, older,   voters make up a large portion of the party\u2019s base, and Republicans need to keep the presidential campaign close in order to hold their majority in the Senate. But Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks have offended wide blocs of voters to whom the party must appeal amid national demographic shifts. And the critiques have raised concerns about how, as president, Mr. Trump would handle the separation of powers between the executive and judicial branches of government. That issue is sacred to conservatives, who have railed against what they see as an abuse of power by Mr. Obama. Republicans have tried to mitigate the potential damage of Mr. Trump\u2019s language by rejecting it in one moment, but embracing his candidacy in the next. On NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, did not directly answer a question about whether Mr. Trump\u2019s remark had been racist, but said he completely disagreed with it. \u201cAll of us came here from somewhere else,\u201d Mr. McConnell said, referring to Judge Curiel\u2019s heritage. \u201cThat\u2019s an important part of what makes America work. \u201d Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, a Republican whose name had been floated as a potential   nominee, said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d of Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior, \u201cI think that he\u2019s going to have to change. \u201d And Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, who has been among Mr. Trump\u2019s most vocal supporters, called the Curiel remarks \u201cinexcusable\u201d on \u201cFox News Sunday. \u201d \u201cThis is one of the worst mistakes Trump has made,\u201d said Mr. Gingrich, who has also been mentioned as a potential   candidate. But none of the three men rejected Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy outright. Mr. Gingrich praised Mr. Trump moments later as a quick learner. Mr. Corker suggested that Mr. Trump \u201chas an opportunity to really change the trajectory of our country, and it\u2019s my sense that he will take advantage of that. \u201d Those defenses are becoming more strained as Mr. Trump has reversed his suggestions that he knows he must grow into the role of nominee. And Republicans were mostly silent after Hillary Clinton assailed Mr. Trump in a speech on Thursday about the stakes of the election. Mr. Trump led his defense on Twitter and at a rally, but his campaign and its surrogates had no uniform response. In the weeks since he vanquished his remaining two primary opponents, Mr. Trump has repeatedly turned his campaign\u2019s focus inward  \u2014   toward his businesses, the Trump University lawsuit, his fights with other Republicans  \u2014   and obscured the hopes Republicans had of keeping a spotlight on Mrs. Clinton and her email controversy, or on a jobs report suggesting a slowdown in job creation. Mr. McConnell, who endorsed Mr. Trump quickly after Mr. Trump became the presumptive nominee early last month, has been vocal in his concern that the remarks on Hispanics will have a historic effect along the lines of the remarks Barry Goldwater made on the party\u2019s ability to woo black voters after he declined to support the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Mr. McConnell said the alternative to Mr. Trump  \u2014   a second Clinton presidency  \u2014   was worse. But he also urged Mr. Trump to stop focusing on the recent past and to look toward the future. \u201cThis is a good time, it seems to me, to begin to try to unify the party,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cAnd you unify the party by not settling scores and grudges against people you\u2019ve been competing with,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re all behind him now. And I\u2019d like to see him reach out and pull us all together and give us a real shot at winning this November. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563915.5035772}
