Suffice it to say, Obama had the best reaction to a protester ever. Hands down. So, of course, Trump had to start lying about what happened. \\nSpeaking to a crowd in Hershey, PA, Trump said that the president had done quite literally the exact opposite of what he actually did . \\n\u201cYou saw it today on television, right?

He became \u2013\u201cYou have to go back and look and study. And see what happened. They never moved the camera.
