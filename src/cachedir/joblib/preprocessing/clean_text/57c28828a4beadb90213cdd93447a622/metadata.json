THROW A GLASS OF WATER AT THE FACE OF HER ASSISTANT DURING RAGE AT MATT LAUER\u2019S UNAPPROVED EMAIL QUESTION DURING NBC PRESIDENTIAL FORUM \\nby Paul Craig Roberts \\nUntil I viewed the video in the URL below, I had concluded from my time spent with Republicans that the Republican Party was more corrupt than the Democratic Party. But after watching this 16 minute video report, which seems too much to be faked, the Democratic political establishment \u2014not necessarily the Americans who vote Democrat\u2014seem to be corrupt beyond the meaning of the word. Make up your own mind. \\n\u201cIn this explosive new video from Project Veritas Action \u2014 a Democratic dirty tricks operative unwittingly provides a dark money trail to the DNC and Clinton campaign. The video documents violence at Trump rallies that is traced to the Clinton campaign and the DNC through a process called birddogging.\u201d \\nPublished on Oct 17, 2016 Matt Lauer , NBC \\nThis second video report \u2014 purports to be based on reports by the NBC TV crew that filmed Hillary\u2019s September 7 interview by Matt Lauer. \\nLauer departed from the pre-agreed script, and the result was a meltdown by Hillary following the interview. \\nThis 8 minute report confirms Secret Service agent Gary Byrne\u2019s account of Hillary\u2019s explosive, uncontrollable temper in his book Crisis of Character. \\nEx-Secret Service Agent: \u201cPeople Need to Know The Real Hillary Clinton And How Dangerous She Is\u201d \\nFormer Secret Service officer Gary Byrne, author of the new book Crisis of Character , which examines Hillary Clinton\u2019s conduct under his watch, appeared on FOX News Channel\u2019s Hannity. \\nIf these reports are true, at this time of heightened tensions between Washington and the two other major nuclear powers, it would be extremely dangerous to have in the White House a person susceptible to uncontrollable rage, especially a person who would be staffed with neoconservative warmongers. Architects of \u201cRegime Change\u201d wars \\nA vote for Hillary could be a vote for nuclear war and the end of life on earth. \\nSee: Hannity Published on Oct 17, 2016. \\nJames O\u2019Keefe video exposes Democrats inciting Violence at Donald Trump Rallies, Newt Gingrich interview with Sean Hannity as a Reaction to James O\u2019Keefe Video: \\nAlso see:'"}, "time": 1742564353.8128254}
