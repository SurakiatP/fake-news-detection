J.  \u2014   A careening commuter train plowed through the barrier at the end of the tracks and crashed into a wall at a terminal here during the morning rush on Thursday, killing one person, injuring more than 100 others and unleashing chaos as part of the station\u2019s roof came tumbling down in a jumble of metal. The startling impact tossed commuters around on the crowded train and created enough force to knock bystanders to their knees, transforming a historic station  \u2014   one of the busiest in the New York region  \u2014   into a disaster area around 8:45 a. m. The person who died was a woman standing on the platform, who was hit by falling debris. Officials said they had not determined why the train, which was carrying an estimated 250 passengers, was traveling at a high speed and failed to halt on the track. \u201cI remember thinking, Why aren\u2019t we stopping?\u201d said Jamie   who was standing between the first and second cars on the train. \u201cBut we just kept going and going, no braking, no nothing. \u201d \u201cPeople were screaming to stay calm, but how do you stay calm in a moment like that?\u201d she added. The crash sent passengers flying out of their seats in a violent tumble. Then the lights cut out. Shouts and cries underscored the sense of panic. And after passengers managed to escape from the train, many crawling through its windows, they emerged to find the station a mess of metal beams, smoke and treacherously hanging wires. Water poured from ruptured pipes. The most seriously injured were carried out. Others emerged on their own with blood staining their clothes. A New Jersey Transit worker said a train is typically supposed to come to a stop about 10 to 20 feet in front of the bumper. Its speed limit while entering the station is 10 miles per hour. Instead, this train barreled over the bumper and onto a concourse, coming to rest at a wall near the station\u2019s waiting area. The train\u2019s engineer, who was released from the hospital, was Thomas Gallagher, 48, according to Nancy Snyder, a spokeswoman for New Jersey Transit. Mr. Gallagher has worked for New Jersey Transit for 29 years, Ms. Snyder said. Officials said the terminal, housed in a   building dating to 1907, would remain closed until engineers could assess whether the significant damage had affected the building\u2019s structural integrity. The terminal serves about 60, 000 people a day on commuter trains, light rail and buses, and is one of the largest transportation hubs for New Jersey Transit, the country\u2019s   commuter railroad. It was severely damaged by Hurricane Sandy in 2012 after being swamped by five feet of water and remained closed for months. The woman who died was identified as Fabiola Bittar de Kroon, 34, of Hoboken, who was killed when the crash caused a portion of the station\u2019s ceiling and supporting structure to collapse, officials said. \u201cAn extraordinary tragedy,\u201d Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey said, flanked by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York and transportation officials at a news conference near the station on Thursday afternoon. In all, at least 114 people were injured in the crash, a flood of victims sent to hospitals that forced at least one to set up a triage area for some patients in its cafeteria. That hospital, the Jersey City Medical Center, treated 66 patients from the crash, releasing all but 13 of the more seriously injured by Thursday afternoon. They remained in \u201cguarded condition,\u201d a spokesman said. Elisa Rosario, 33, who was sitting in the hospital\u2019s emergency room, said she was in the station when the crash occurred. She said she felt a strong wind at her back, which pushed her onto her knees. \u201cEverything was dark and all of a sudden I start seeing things flying through the air,\u201d she said. She felt pain in her head and knees and felt blood dripping down her face onto her lips. \u201cIt was my worst nightmare,\u201d Ms. Rosario said.   other patients were taken to Hoboken University Medical Center, and one to Christ Hospital, a spokesman for CarePoint Health said. All but two had been released by Thursday night, the spokesman said. The crash\u2019s impact was magnified by its timing  \u2014   in the midst of one of the fundamental daily routines, the morning commute to work. Many passengers, emerging from local hospitals with blood still on their clothes and skin, said the psychological toll rivaled the impact of their injuries. \u201cThe injury is nothing,\u201d said one passenger, Mike Scelzo, who had a black eye and a facial cut. His striped   shirt was splattered with blood. \u201cIt\u2019s more just the shock of what happened,\u201d he said. Alexis Valle, 24, a commuter from Bergenfield, N. J. who is five months pregnant, was in the first car. She walked out of Hoboken University Hospital with a large bandage and four staples on her head. \u201cThe baby\u2019s fine, but the ceiling of the train fell on my head,\u201d she said. \u201cSomebody picked me up and passed me through the window to someone else. I told them, so I was the first one out. \u201d She is still struggling to understand what happened. \u201cThe train just didn\u2019t stop,\u201d she said. \u201cIt kind of picked up speed and crashed. \u201d The train started its journey shortly around 7:30 a. m. in Spring Valley, N. Y. and traveled south to Hoboken along the Pascack Valley line. The National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Railroad Administration said they were investigating the crash. They planned to interview the engineer, Mr. Gallagher, and to examine another crash at the Hoboken Terminal in 2011 involving a PATH train, which carries New Jersey commuters to Manhattan. After that crash, in which a PATH train hit a post at the end of the tracks and 30 people were injured, the safety board determined that the engineer had failed to control the train\u2019s speed as it entered the station. The last fatal train crash involving New Jersey Transit was in 1996. Two recent train crashes in the Northeast have prompted federal officials to push for the expansion of a technology, known as positive train control, that can automatically stop or slow a train. An Amtrak train derailed in Philadelphia last year, killing eight people and injuring nearly 200 others, when the engineer became distracted and accelerated to more than twice the speed limit. In 2013, when a   Railroad train derailed in New York, killing four people, the safety board said the engineer had fallen asleep as a result of undiagnosed sleep apnea. In both derailments, the safety board cited the absence of the technology to stop or slow a train as contributing to the crashes. The crash on Thursday also rekindled anxiety in a region where less than two weeks ago bombs were set off in Manhattan and a town on the Jersey Shore. The suspect in the bombings was also accused of leaving five pipe bombs inside a backpack at a New Jersey Transit train station in Elizabeth, forcing the shutdown of a major line. The suspect, Ahmad Khan Rahami, was arrested nearby the next day. \u201cBetween terrorist attacks, natural disasters, we\u2019ve had our hands full in this country,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said. The victim\u2019s mother, Sueli Bittar, was   on Thursday at her home in Santos, Brazil. Ms. de Kroon was a lawyer who was married to a Dutch man and had a    daughter. \u201cShe was very, very happy,\u201d Ms. Bittar said in a telephone interview. Ms. de Kroon had worked in Brazil for the software company SAP before moving earlier this year to New Jersey, and the family was looking for a new apartment. Ms. Bittar said that her daughter wanted a little garden. Ms. Bittar was making plans on Thursday to travel to New Jersey to bring her daughter\u2019s body home to Brazil. A friend of Ms. de Kroon\u2019s, Sarah Alvarado, said they met when they were both studying in an M. B. A. program at Florida International University. They became fast friends, and when Ms. de Kroon moved to S\u00e3o Paulo before coming to the New York area, Ms. Alvarado visited her in Brazil. \u201cShe was very smart, a \u201d Ms. Alvarado said in a telephone interview. \u201cShe was accomplished in her career. A dynamic woman. \u201d Stephen Wang, 35, who usually transfers to a train at the Hoboken station, said the rerouting will probably add an hour to his normally   commute  \u2014   \u201cfor days or weeks or months, who knows. \u201d Ms. Rosario, who sustained a concussion, was still shaken hours after the crash. \u201cI barely made it,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to go home, and kiss my kids and pray and thank God that I made it out. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628476.6878684}
