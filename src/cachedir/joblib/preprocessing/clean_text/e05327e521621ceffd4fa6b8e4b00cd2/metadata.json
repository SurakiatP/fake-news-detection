Hours into his presidency he made it harder for   homebuyers to buy a home. A few days later he tried to make it harder for people to save for retirement. He nominates someone to head the Labor Department who wants to gut overtime pay. He is continually talking one way, but I judge people by their actions. Look at the   and frankly, racist executive action against Muslims. He has governed from the far right in everything he has done. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742563783.5953305}
