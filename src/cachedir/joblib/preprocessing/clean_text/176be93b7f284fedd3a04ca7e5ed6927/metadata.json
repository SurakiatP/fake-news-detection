She is a true professional who is a tenacious and effective advocate for Democrats.\u201d \\n\u201cShe uses that skill regularly on television, she has been using that skill regularly as a party official, and I for one am pretty excited about the fact that we\u2019ve got her on our team,\u201d he added. \\nCorke asked, \u201cWhat do you say to those Bernie Sanders backers who feel like the fix was in from the very outset. \u2026 If it turns out that she did tip the scales or put her hand on the scale for Secretary Clinton, and didn\u2019t handle it evenly as a member of the leadership of the DNC, that\u2019s OK with you?\u201d Post navigation'"}, "time": 1742628293.2776349}
