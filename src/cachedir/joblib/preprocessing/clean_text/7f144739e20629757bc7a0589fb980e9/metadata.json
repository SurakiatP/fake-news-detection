[According to Deadline, Murdoch is set to host two meetings at the network\u2019s new studio, Studio F, where he will discuss both the company\u2019s plans for a new newsroom and its overall direction and future. The meetings will reportedly be held in two shifts to accommodate all staff.  The meetings come as the network has been rocked by a series of sexual harassment and racial discrimination lawsuits in recent months, culminating in last month\u2019s departure of star anchor and   cable news ratings king Bill O\u2019Reilly. Following O\u2019Reilly\u2019s departure, the network\u2019s primetime schedule underwent perhaps its most significant reshuffling  in years, with Tucker Carlson taking over O\u2019Reilly\u2019s 8 p. m. time slot and the panel show The Five moving to 9 p. m. But the network faces an early test of its new lineup from MSNBC, which has benefitted greatly from star anchor Rachel Maddow and its lineup\u2019s breathless coverage of the Trump administration. Last week, MSNBC won the key demo ( ) during weeknights for the first time in seven years, with The Rachel Maddow Show, The Last Word with Lawrence O\u2019Donnell and The 11th Hour with Brian Williams all finishing first in their respective time slots, according to Adweek. Fox News finished first in total viewership, with an average 2. 6 million viewers, but MSNBC was right on its heels with 2. 4 million. CNN lagged far behind with 1. 3 million. It was the 19th straight week that Fox News led all competitors in total viewers. But the network\u2019s hold on total viewership could soon be in jeopardy as well. On Monday, MSNBC came within two thousand viewers of surpassing Fox News in that category, and Fox slipped to third in the news demo with 499, 000 viewers to CNN\u2019s 608, 000 and MSNBC\u2019s 662, 000. Murdoch\u2019s Wednesdays meetings are reportedly meant to \u201crally the troops\u201d in the face of the challenges. Meanwhile, the network\u2019s former talent is moving on. On Monday, Bill O\u2019Reilly announced he would be a guest on radio host and the Blaze founder Glenn Beck\u2019s program on Fridays. Update: Fox News was the   cable network in total day viewership for the 19th consecutive week, according to Nielsen data. \u201cIn primetime, FNC also ranked #1 in all of basic cable with P2+ including NBA   TNT, with 2. 3 million viewers,\u201d the network noted in a Tuesday email to reporters.
