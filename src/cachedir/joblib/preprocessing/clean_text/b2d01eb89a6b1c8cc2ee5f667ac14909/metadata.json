Nickelodeon has always had its share of magical kingdoms, but this   cable network has tended to leave the princess business to Disney. (And what a business it is, generating an estimated $5. 5 billion a year in merchandise revenue alone.) But here comes \u201cNella the Princess Knight,\u201d which Nickelodeon will introduce on Monday in a programming block for preschoolers. The   Princess Police, mostly academics who use Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and their slender ilk to make  points about their negative impact on young girls, have been a perennial thorn in Disney\u2019s side, even as the company has introduced black and Latina royals, along with a preschool one, \u201cSofia the First. \u201d Will Nickelodeon now find itself in a similar position? Maybe not. The   Nella pushes boundaries, at least for television aimed at    in the areas of race and gender. She is biracial, with a black father and a white mother, a decision informed by Nickelodeon research indicating that most children under 12 will be nonwhite by 2020 and that already 17 percent are biracial. The character also mashes together traditional boy and girl gender norms. Nella may ride a unicorn with a pink mane (\u00e0 la My Little Pony) but she does it while brandishing a sword and wearing knight gear, a bit like a preschool version of Brienne of Tarth from \u201cGame of Thrones. \u201d She is a girlie girl but does traditional boy activities (battling a dragon) and does not spend the majority of her time in a ball gown. Nickelodeon\u2019s princess may strike some adults as subversive, particularly given the surge of conservatism that helped push Donald J. Trump into office. But children see   families and the blurring of gender lines as normal, said Cyma Zarghami, Nickelodeon\u2019s longtime chief. \u201cAdults might say, \u2018Oh, look  \u2014   she\u2019s biracial,\u2019 but our viewers just say, \u2018That looks like my friend,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAn older generation was taught tolerance, and this audience is demanding difference,\u201d said Ms. Zarghami. She led Nickelodeon to ratings strength in 2016 among total viewers and children ages 2 to 11, even as competitors like Disney Channel and Cartoon Network recorded sharp    drops. (According to Nielsen, Disney still has a big lead among viewers 6 to 14.) She added, \u201cThis series seems to be taking on a life of its own, which is incredibly exciting. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628500.907646}
