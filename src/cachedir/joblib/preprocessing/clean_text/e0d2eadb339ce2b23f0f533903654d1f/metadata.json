[Some of the administration\u2019s most popular positions have seen their popularity decline, according to CNBC\u2019s quarterly \u201cAll American Survey. \u201d The share of Americans who say they somewhat or strongly support the administration\u2019s plans to rebuild American infrastructure, for example, has declined to 62 percent from 75 percent three months earlier. Support for individual tax cuts has fallen to 59 percent from 64 percent, while support for cuts to business taxes fell to 50 percent from 54 percent.  Renegotiating trade deals has lost support, falling to 50 percent from 58 percent. Support for regulatory relief has declined to 44 percent from 47 percent. Public support for repealing Obamacare very nearly held steady, losing just one percentage point of support from 45 percent to 44 percent. But the public remains strongly divided on healthcare, with opposition to the administration\u2019s repeal and replace plans edging up to 38 percent from 37 percent in April. So which issue has gained popularity? Banning immigration from specific Middle Eastern and African countries. Public support for the ban rose by a percentage point, with 44 percent of Americans now saying the strongly or somewhat support the ban. That slight rise was due to a one percentage point gain in the \u201cstrongly support\u201d category. Opposition to the ban has slightly declined, falling to 49 percent from 50 percent. The share of respondents who said they \u201cstrongly oppose\u201d the plan, however, saw a steeper decline, to 32 percent from 36 percent.    '"}, "time": 1742561692.185616}
