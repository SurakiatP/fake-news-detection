According to the latest batch of Podesta\u2019s hacked emails, Podesta writes, \u201cNot to sound like Lanny, but we are going to have to dump all those emails so better to do so sooner than later.\u201d Mills responded, \u201cThink you just got your new nick name.\u201d The \u201cLanny\u201d reference is to lawyer Lanny Davis, who served as special counsel to former President, Bill Clinton. Lawyers, unfortunately, are not always the most honest individuals and have been known to cover up for their guilty clients. Hillary Clinton is one of these lawyers. Cheryl Mills is the same woman who oversaw the controversial construction of a South Korean sweat shop being built in Haiti. A week after this email exchange took place, Hillary Clinton announced that she would love nothing more than to share her emails with the general public, claiming she had nothing to hide. At least, she didn\u2019t think she did. After being subpoenaed by federal court, Hillary Clinton acid-washed her private server, deleting thousands of emails. She denied, under oath, that classified information was ever on the server or sent/discussed via her private email address. Acid-washing a server costs a pretty penny. If she truly had nothing to hide, why did she completely bleach her server free of everything? Thanks to leaked emails from WikiLeaks, it has been proven that Hillary lied when she said no classified information had ever been involved with her private server- Not only was there classified information stored and talked about, but hackers were able to intercept the data and correspondence. New York Post comments, \u201cDemocrats on the House Oversight Committee point to Clinton tweeting on March 4, 2015, calling on the State Department to release her 55,000 pages of work files.\u201d \u201cI want the public to see my email,\u201d Hillary wrote two days after the Podesta message. At the time, the real Lanny Davis was in support of Clinton addressing her emails. Another WikiLeaks email displays members of the Clinton Organization getting frustrated with Davis\u2019 public voicing. \u201cWe gotta zap Lanny out of our universe,\u201d campaign manager Robby Mook wrote Podesta March 8, 2015. \u201cCan\u2019t believe he committed her to a private review of her hard drive on TV.\u201d Good thing for Lanny Davis, \u201czap\u201d doesn\u2019t equate to \u201cwet-work.\u201d Although Davis may have been rash to announce and support Hillary Clinton\u2019s innocence, the DNC had major issues with it. Davis told Fox News host Chris Wallace, during a televised interview, about Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server- \u201cthere can be a neutral party to review all these records \u2013 nothing unlawful.\u201d Apparently, Davis wasn\u2019t given the memo by Hillary Clinton\u2019s team regarding her bleached server and it\u2019s true contents. \u201cI think it is a reasonable idea if anybody has any doubts that there\u2019s a delete on a hard drive- to have an independent go inspect her private e-mail?\u201d Davis added. Hillary Clinton is known for lying, her own chairman doesn\u2019t even believe her when she claims she \u201cforgets\u201d things. \\nEVEN PODESTA KNOWS SHE IS A LIAR! Hillary Clinton wouldn\u2019t know honesty if it slapped her in the face. She is a psychopathic liar that thirsts for ways to obscenely scam on a global spectrum. She calls out Donald Trump for \u201cusing the system\u201d but in no way has he abused the system in the grand scale that the Clintons have. He\u2019s a business man, he was simply following the laws that government had implemented. Floods of emails and documents are being leaked every day by Anonymous, WikiLeaks and the FBI. These are desperate cries for help mostly from whistle blowers who have been intimately involved with the government, trying to warn American citizens of certain madness and despair that awaits us if Hillary Clinton wins presidency. Donald J. Trump genuinely cares for the American people. He is a natural leader, he enjoys helping people because he believes in bettering America, not policies that encourage \u2018pay for play\u2019. Hillary Clintons transparency is starting to become blurred. Shatter the busted deception and lock everyone involved with the Clinton scandals in prison. Donald Trump recognizes the need for America to rebuild, which starts with depleting government corruption and replacing government officials. This is something Hillary could never accomplish. Hillary Clinton would just hire her friends and abuse her position of power, as she\u2019s done for nearly four decades. John Podesta suggested that Hillary Clinton delete her emails- he must believe she is capable of worse than sharing classified information and as president of the United States, who would stop her from committing even more crime? She would put each and every one of our lives on the line and not think twice. Do you think Hillary Clinton ever gets tired of lying, each lie covering up the next? And even Podesta don\u2019t believe her! Why should America? \\nIf you haven\u2019t checked out and liked our Facebook page, please go here and do so. Leave a comment...
