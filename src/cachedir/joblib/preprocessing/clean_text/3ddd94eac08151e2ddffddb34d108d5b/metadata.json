Dave Brat ( ) talked with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Friday regarding the Freedom Caucus endorsement of the GOP\u2019s Obamacare repeal plan, his evaluation of  President Donald Trump\u2019s first 100 days, and the budget deal. [While discussing the details of the Republican House and White House debate about the Obamacare repeal, Brat said, \u201cIn the conference, we\u2019ve moved the thing as far as we can move it in the free market direction without losing the votes. \u201d  Asked if the latest tax bill is \u201cfor show or the real thing,\u201d Brat said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s both. It\u2019s    trillion in tax deductions and possible increases in the deficit  \u2014   in that neighborhood. That\u2019s a whopper. So they\u2019ve got to find that repatriation. There\u2019s two trillion dollars overseas they can bring back to lessen the pain on the deficit side. So they\u2019ve got to do some of that movement, too. We can\u2019t sustain deficits that big. \u201d Brat also said he gives Trump \u201can A\u201d for his first 100 days.
