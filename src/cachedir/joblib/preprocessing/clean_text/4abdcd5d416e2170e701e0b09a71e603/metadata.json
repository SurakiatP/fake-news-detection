[She was especially concerned about the push for \u201cconcealed carry reciprocity,\u201d which she described as \u201cextremely dangerous. \u201d  For anyone not familiar with national reciprocity for concealed carry, the goal is to replace the current patchwork of concealed carry laws with a recognition that a concealed permit from one state is valid in every state. This would allow concealed permit holders to drive from one state to the next and keep their handgun with them for   just as they do in their home state. This is what Watts described as \u201cextremely dangerous. \u201d She said national reciprocity is \u201cthe NRA\u2019s dream but it is a nightmare for public safety. \u201d She did not provide any data substantiating her suggestion that concealed carry permit holders endanger public safety. Watts also mentioned \u201csilencer legislation\u201d and \u201ctalk of executive orders to put guns in schools. \u201d She then spoke to the fact that President Trump will be speaking at the NRA\u2019s Annual Meetings on April 28, and said, \u201cI would like to see Donald Trump say something about where he stands on these dangerous laws. \u201d It is important to note that Trump actually led the charge for national reciprocity during his presidential campaign, so there is no need for him to clarify his stance. On September 18, 2015, Breitbart News quoted Trump: The right of   doesn\u2019t stop at the end of your driveway. That\u2019s why I have a concealed carry permit and why tens of millions of Americans do too. That permit should be valid in all 50 states. A driver\u2019s license works in every state, so it\u2019s common sense that a concealed carry permit should work in every state. If we can do that for driving  \u2014   which is a privilege, not a right  \u2014   then surely we can do that for concealed carry, which is a right, not a privilege. Trump\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr. also spoke plainly during the campaign when he explained that his father would support firearm suppressor deregulation. And Trump was very clear in numerous statements about the dangers posed by   zones, like the ones at Orlando Pulse (June 12, 2106) Umpqua Community College (October 1, 2015) and Sandy Hook Elementary (December 14, 2012). In fact, following the Umpqua Community College attack, The Hill quoted Trump saying, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you, if you had a couple of the teachers or someone with guns in that room, you would have been a hell of a lot better off. \u201d On April 16, Breitbart News reported Watts\u2019 claim that \u201ccaring Americans\u201d support gun control.
