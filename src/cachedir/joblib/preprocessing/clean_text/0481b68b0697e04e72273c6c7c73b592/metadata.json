In Egyptian mythology the planets and stars are shown in hieroglyphs as moving about on boats. In the film IPet Goat II, there is a figure riding on a boat which has been called Messianic by some viewers. However, I think this figure is a representation of the sun, he is very yellow, like the Simp(suns), he appears to be covered in flames and his hair looks distinctly like flames. He also seems to have sunspots on his face. Sunspots are quite distinct from ordinary spots.The reason I mention the Simp(suns) is that their eyes are designed to look like the circumpunct, a circle with a dot in the centre which represents the sun. [ link to en.wikipedia.org (secure) ] Also in the simpsons, Homer is obsessed with doughnuts and the torus is a doughnut shape that is seen throughout nature and space and has been the subject of much theorising by physicists such as Nassim Harramein.Sorry, back to IPet Goat II. The II in the title suggests it could be the symbol of Gemini. In the celestial realm the sun is currently moving through the sign of Gemini and will be moving to Wasat, a fixed star in the constellation and which appears to be where you might locate the phallus part of the constellation.You can see the phallus around the 4 min mark [ link to en.wikipedia.org (secure) ] This area is where the water signs are located in the sky. The sun moved through this area over the past few months.A little further in the video, just after the phallus scene, you see the sun produce either a massive solar flare or possibly an EMP which knocks out the grey men in the suits.Now I know there is much speculation about a possible celestial event and/or a financial collapse happening soon, perhaps these events have been foreshadowed by this video.The sun reaches the phallus around 11th July and if the video is prophetic, then we can expect some solar related event to happen very soon after that.This is the sun\\'s position on 11th July Re: IPet Goat And The Solar Flare \"The more you know, the crazier you look\" Report Copyright Violation Re: IPet Goat And The Solar Flare Maybe the Christ figure is a representation of you and your journey through this reality.
