The question has become vexing enough in the United States that a plea from one Twitter user for the country to \u201cget on the same page\u201d has become the unofficial, albeit vulgar, mantra of the nation\u2019s consumers, with tens of thousands of retweets and likes. Ten months into the transition to chip cards, it\u2019s clear there\u2019s no going back. But as the national frustration grows, here are answers to some burning questions. There is reason to hope. About 75 percent of credit cards are  . If all businesses upgraded their terminals  \u2014   which they are not required to do by law  \u2014   at least the confusion over whether to swipe or insert would be settled. So far, about   of the nation\u2019s merchants have made the transition, said Jason Oxman, chief executive of Electronic Transactions Association, a trade group for companies that deal with payment products and services. But while many of them have the terminals, they are waiting to get them certified for use, said Jared Drieling, the business intelligence manager for the Strawhecker Group, a consulting company for the industry. Technological improvements generally make things easier, but that\u2019s not what this change is about. The longer wait times at checkout occur because of all  these steps in the process: \u2022 The chip creates a   code. \u2022 The payment terminal sends it to the bank. \u2022 The bank matches it to an identical   code. \u2022 The bank then sends back verification. Voil\u00e0! The good news: New software is being developed to allow chip cards to be inserted and quickly removed, speeding up the process, Mr. Drieling said. Security. \u201cYou can\u2019t counterfeit a chip card,\u201d Mr. Oxman said. \u201cYou can very easily counterfeit a strip card. \u201d Financial institutions changed the rules attached to their terminals last year. Now, if a counterfeit card is used because a merchant doesn\u2019t have the technology to process   cards, the merchant is responsible for paying the fraudulent charges. Businesses that sell goods, like electronics, that can be easily resold on the black market are often targeted by people with fraudulent cards. Because of that, they have a lot of motivation to upgrade. If they don\u2019t, they must pay the bill for all those purchases. \u201cBut the local coffee shop might not be getting a lot of fraud activity,\u201d Mr. Oxman said, so there\u2019s less motivation to get the new terminals. There is a chance, then, that at the onset of a purchase, you\u2019ll never really know whether to swipe or dip. Get used to it. \u201cThe loud, annoying beep that you\u2019re referring to is to remind you to take the card out,\u201d Mr. Oxman said. \u201cThe goal of the noise is to get your attention, and it sounds like it\u2019s working. \u201d But as Kathleen Dunn, 27, of Nashville pointed out, the sound rings of rejection. \u201cI hate the noise. It makes me feel like my card got declined, and I panic every time,\u201d Ms. Dunn said via a message on Twitter. Dieter Bohn, the executive editor of The Verge, a technology site, characterized the situation as a \u201ccheckout dance\u201d in an article. That dance is caused in part by the fact that many places that have the new terminals can\u2019t use the chip reader technology yet. They\u2019re not broken  \u2014   they\u2019re just waiting to be certified, and that process can sometimes take months. Until then, retailers are responsible for any fraudulent charges, and they\u2019re not happy about it. It\u2019s likely, but their transition is long in the past now. \u201cWe\u2019re really one of the last G20 nations to adopt E. M. V. ,\u201d said Mr. Drieling, referring to the chip technology by an acronym for Europay, MasterCard and Visa, the technology\u2019s early advocates. The chips work a little differently in the 150 other countries using them: The cardholder also enters a PIN at the terminal, which lets the verification process happen offline, Mr. Oxman said. Banks and retailers are at odds over why the United States isn\u2019t adopting the PIN system. Why it has taken so long to adopt the chip technology in the United States has a lot to do with its bigger and more complex market. \u201cChanging it is a huge undertaking,\u201d Mr. Oxman said. Probably not much longer. Most of the new terminals that accept the   cards are also equipped with the technology to accept contactless payments, like Apple Pay or Android Pay. And while there is disagreement about whether mobile wallets are  faster than chip cards, mobile payment makes it feel as if the transaction is moving more quickly. \u201cThere is a perfect storm brewing for mobile wallets,\u201d Mr. Drieling said. Until then, perhaps you can use that extra time at the checkout counter to commiserate with the cashier. \u201cI always bring it up during the awkward silence caused by the amount of time the chip takes to read,\u201d Ross Schickler, 19, of Springfield, N. J. said in a Twitter message. \u201cThey always laugh and agree. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561653.7229087}
