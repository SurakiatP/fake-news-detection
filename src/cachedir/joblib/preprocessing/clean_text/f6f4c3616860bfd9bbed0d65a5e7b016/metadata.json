Trump to visit Mexico for a dialogue in the interest of democracy, the message has fallen on deaf ears. Instead, the predominant feeling here in the Mexican capital is one of betrayal. \u201cIt\u2019s a historic error,\u201d said Enrique Krauze, a   historian. \u201cYou confront tyrants. You don\u2019t appease them. \u201d On Mexico\u2019s most popular morning television show on Wednesday, a livid Mr. Krauze likened the president\u2019s meeting with Mr. Trump to the decision by Neville Chamberlain, then the British prime minister, to sit down with Hitler in Munich in 1938. \u201cIt isn\u2019t brave to meet in private with somebody who has insulted and denigrated\u201d Mexicans, Mr. Krauze said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t dignified to simply have a dialogue. \u201d Yes, many Mexicans say, it was Mr. Trump who offended the people of Mexico with his disparaging comments about migrants and his promises to build a border wall paid for by Mexico. But for many Mexicans, the surprising invitation from Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto  \u2014   who has likened Mr. Trump\u2019s language to that of Hitler and Mussolini in the past  \u2014   is even worse. Newspapers, television stations, social media and all manner of national communications were awash in vitriol at the idea of a meeting between the two men, while political analysts on both sides of the border said they were mystified about why Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto invited Mr. Trump. \u201cIt is Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s worst mistake so far and one we still don\u2019t understand,\u201d said Vidal Romero, the head of the political science department at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico, a university in Mexico City. \u201cThis would only hurt him. \u201d But as others pointed out, Mr. Trump is the Republican presidential candidate, and not the first to visit a Mexican president. John McCain came to Mexico when he was running against Barack Obama. \u201cAt the end of the day, this is the Republican candidate,\u201d said Rafael Fern\u00e1ndez de Castro, a professor at Syracuse University and former foreign policy adviser to Felipe Calder\u00f3n, the previous Mexican president. \u201cThe U. S. electorate put him in this position, and Pe\u00f1a is respecting that. \u201d Ultimately, he said, foreign policy cannot always be guided by public opinion, no matter the political consequences. \u201cHe has everything to lose in the media, but this is about governing,\u201d Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez de Castro said. \u201cHe had no other choice  \u2014   a good relationship with the U. S. is essential for the   of Mexico. \u201d From that perspective, with his approval ratings already low, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto may have less to lose than is commonly thought. If the goal was to ensure national interests in the event Mr. Trump wins, then the furor over the visit seemed a political cost the government was willing to take. Still, there is \u201cunanimity that this is a giant farce,\u201d said Jes\u00fas   M\u00e1rquez, a professor at the Tecn\u00f3logico de Monterrey in Mexico City and columnist for Reforma, a Mexico City newspaper. Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto \u201ccompared Mr. Trump to Mussolini and Hitler,\u201d he added, \u201cand now we invite Mussolini, we are going to negotiate with Hitler when he hasn\u2019t even won the election. \u201d After the men met, in what Mr. Trump described as an \u201cexcellent\u201d occasion, they spoke at a very civil news conference. Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto promised to work with whichever candidate was elected and emphasized the importance of ties with the United States. \u201cI shared with him the fact that there have been misunderstandings or affirmations that hurt and affected Mexicans in their perception of his candidacy,\u201d Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto said he told Mr. Trump. \u201cThe Mexican people felt aggravated for comments that were formulated, but I am certain that he has a genuine interest in building a relationship that would lead us to provide better conditions for our people. \u201d While Mr. Trump hardly offered Mexicans the sort of apology many had hoped for, he was a far more chastened candidate than they had come to expect. He repeatedly lauded their hard work, and spoke of his \u201ctremendous feeling\u201d for Mexicans. \u201cThey are amazing people,\u201d he noted. In the end, he called Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto a friend. Citing Mr. Trump\u2019s more respectful tone, the government described the meeting as a success. \u201cIt was a different Trump,\u201d said Eduardo S\u00e1nchez, the president\u2019s spokesman. \u201cThe attitude of this Trump is different from the ones we have seen before today. \u201d But Shannon K. O\u2019Neil, a Mexico expert at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, said: \u201cI don\u2019t see how that helped Pe\u00f1a Nieto. If the reason Pe\u00f1a was inviting Trump was to stand up to him and show his strength in front of somebody who has attacked Mexicans, then he failed. \u201d Other critics were less kind. \u201cTo put it mildly, I think it was the biggest humiliation a Mexican president has suffered on his own territory in the last 50 years,\u201d said Esteban Illades, editor of Nexos, a magazine in Mexico. \u201cHe not only managed to make Donald Trump look presidential, which is an incredibly hard thing to do, he managed to forgive Donald Trump even though he didn\u2019t actually offer an apology in the first place. \u201d Mexican officials did not clearly articulate the reasons for the visit at first. Later, in a news release, the president explained the rationale for the meeting as being in the interest of democracy and to create a dialogue. In his remarks, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto suggested that he wanted to fortify the nation\u2019s ties with its most important global partner, while standing up for Mexico. \u201cI also made him notice and feel the great responsibility I have as president of Mexico, to defend the Mexican people, both those who are here and abroad,\u201d Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto said after the meeting. Some argued that the invitation was a distraction from the domestic problems that have gnawed at the president. Violence is rising, new scandals seem to emerge regularly and the impunity that lies at the heart of discord in Mexico remains undisturbed. Most recently, the president was accused of plagiarizing a third of his law school thesis, which his office explained as an error in citation. Others were not convinced by that explanation, contending meeting with Mr. Trump hardly made the other problems go away. \u201cI do not see this as a distraction to his problems the visit will only add to the problems he faces in Mexico,\u201d said Jason Marczak, a director in the Atlantic Council\u2019s Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center, a research center. \u201cDonald Trump will come out of this meeting carrying the message of the meeting. \u201d \u201cHe will use Pe\u00f1a Nieto as a political pawn in his campaign,\u201d he added.'"}, "time": 1742562105.1863503}
