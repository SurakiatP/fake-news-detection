Trump said on Tuesday that he had no intention of pressing for an investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server or the financial operations of her family\u2019s foundation, dropping the \u201clock her up\u201d pledge that became a rallying cry for his campaign for the White House. Mr. Trump, who branded his rival \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d and said she would go to jail if he were president, said in an interview with reporters and editors at The New York Times that he was no longer interested in pursuing Mrs. Clinton, in part because he wanted to heal the wounds of a divisive campaign. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt the Clintons, I really don\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Trump said during the interview. \u201cShe went through a lot and suffered greatly in many different ways, and I am not looking to hurt them at all. The campaign was vicious. \u201d His reversal on prosecuting Mrs. Clinton was particularly striking given the outsize role the issue played during the presidential campaign, in which her use of a private email server as secretary of state became a prominent theme, and one she has blamed for her loss to Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump said he wanted to \u201cmove forward\u201d from the subject. Without elaborating, he said that \u201cwe\u2019ll have people that do things,\u201d perhaps a reference to the F. B. I. or Republicans who might continue to press for prosecutions in the email or foundation cases. But the   made clear that he would not seek to pursue an investigation himself nor make it a priority after he assumes office. The decision angered some of his most fervent supporters, who immediately criticized his seeming change of heart. \u201cBroken Promise,\u201d blared the headline on Breitbart News, a conservative news site that has strongly backed Mr. Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that I feel very strongly about,\u201d Mr. Trump said at The Times, unlike health care or immigration. \u201cThis has been a very painful period of time. \u201d Clinton aides did not respond to a request for comment about Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks. During their second debate, Mr. Trump turned to Mrs. Clinton and vowed, \u201cIf I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there\u2019s never been so many lies, so much deception. \u201d After Mr. Trump\u2019s turnaround on Tuesday, the conservative commentator Ann Coulter, one of his staunchest supporters during the campaign, suggested on Twitter that Mr. Trump was overstepping his role. \u201cWhoa! I thought we elected @realDonaldTrump president,\u201d she wrote. \u201cDid we make him the FBI,  DOJ? His job is to pick those guys, not do their jobs. \u201d Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, a conservative advocacy group that has been a relentless critic of Mrs. Clinton, said on Tuesday that it would be a mistake for Mr. Trump to drop the threat of appointing a special counsel to look into her email use. Mr. Fitton said that although the F. B. I. had already investigated the matter twice, that inquiry was flawed. His group has gained access to thousands of pages of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s State Department emails through lawsuits and is pressing its case in court even after her defeat. Representative Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican who leads the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said last week on Fox News that his committee would continue to investigate the matter as well because \u201cwe\u2019ve got to get to the truth. \u201d Mr. Chaffetz\u2019s office said on Tuesday he was unavailable for comment about Mr. Trump\u2019s statements. Although the F. B. I. \u2019s email investigation is closed, the agency still has an open inquiry into the Clinton Foundation. That inquiry began after the 2015 publication of \u201cClinton Cash,\u201d a book by Peter Schweizer that asserted that some foreign entities had given money to the foundation in return for State Department favors when Mrs. Clinton was there. The Clintons have denied the assertions. The F. B. I. and Justice Department conduct their criminal investigations largely independently from the White House, so Mr. Trump cannot tell agents to close their cases. A president ordering the F. B. I. to stop a politically sensitive case would be a major scandal. \u201cIt does seem like an extraordinary breach of protocol for him to get involved in that decision,\u201d Glen A. Kopp, a former federal prosecutor in New York, said of the  . \u201cI know of no recent circumstances when the president ordered an attorney general not to pursue a criminal matter. \u201d If, as president, Mr. Trump were to order the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, to close the foundation inquiry, Mr. Comey could choose to rebuff him. F. B. I. directors are given   terms to insulate them from political pressure, but the president still has the power to fire a director, as President Bill Clinton did with William S. Sessions in 1993 after a Justice Department investigation uncovered ethical abuses by Mr. Sessions. In an interview last week with CBS News\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d Mr. Trump said he had not yet decided whether to dismiss Mr. Comey over his handling of the Clinton email investigation, saying the director \u201cmay have had very good reasons for doing what he did. \u201d As a practical matter, though, Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks will probably have little impact. The investigation into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails is already closed and, while the one into her family\u2019s foundation remains open, senior F. B. I. officials and career Justice Department officials have said there is little evidence justifying moving forward with a case. When the case comes up for review, senior agents and prosecutors may decide to shut it down, but it will not be because of Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks. While the  \u2019s decision is likely to frustrate investigators at the F. B. I. who are fiercely protective of their independence to follow the facts they uncover, some legal experts applauded Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to not pursue investigations into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails or her family foundation. Rory K. Little, a professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law, said he was inclined to support both moves by Mr. Trump. A decision to shut down an investigation, he said, \u201cis not out of step with constitutional constraints,\u201d as the Constitution gives the president the power to issue pardons for federal crimes.'"}, "time": 1742564262.0892265}
