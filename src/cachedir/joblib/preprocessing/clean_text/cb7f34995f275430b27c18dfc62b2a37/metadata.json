Once an indisputable sex symbol of the   era, Mr. Michael appeared overweight and nearly unrecognizable in photographs, reportedly from September, that the website TMZ published on Monday. News media attention also fell on a 2015 tabloid interview with a relative claiming that Mr. Michael was abusing drugs and putting his life at risk. And after years of arrests related to drug use, as well as confessional interviews and health scares, the singer had largely retreated from the public eye, while his creative output had all but ceased. [ Why George Michael mattered | Read the obituary ] Paul Gambaccini, a radio and television presenter who had known Mr. Michael since youth and represented him during a 2011 tour, said in an interview that he was not surprised by the singer\u2019s death because Mr. Michael was \u201cnot completely well\u201d and had a \u201cclose brush with death\u201d five years ago when he nearly succumbed to a bout of pneumonia. Doctors had to perform a tracheotomy. Police officials, who had announced that Mr. Michael died in \u201cunexplained but not suspicious\u201d circumstances at his home in    England, could not be reached for further details on Monday because of Boxing Day. The singer\u2019s manager, Michael Lippman, on Monday declined to elaborate on his statement that Mr. Michael had died of heart failure, \u201cin bed, lying peacefully. \u201d Forensic experts said an autopsy report could be ready in a couple of days. While admirers sought to focus on Mr. Michael\u2019s previously unreported donations and philanthropy, and neighbors remembered his charm as a   celebrity in their midst, a more complicated image of Mr. Michael\u2019s life in recent years loomed, as well. Several friends and associates, while declining to discuss details of his health, noted that Mr. Michael had a long history of hard living. In 2007, he was sentenced to community service and barred from driving for two years after he had been found asleep at the wheel and under the influence of drugs. The next year, he was arrested in London on suspicion of possessing crack cocaine. \u201cI\u2019ve done different things at different times that I shouldn\u2019t have done, once or twice, you know,\u201d Mr. Michael said in a 2009 interview with The Guardian, in which he discussed his ups and downs with sex, sleeping pills, marijuana and crack. \u201cPeople want to see me as tragic,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t even see them as weaknesses anymore. It\u2019s just who I am. \u201d In the summer of 2015, Mr. Michael and his publicists denied that he was facing serious drug addiction after a report published in a British tabloid, The Sun, quoted the wife of a family member saying, \u201cI\u2019m petrified he will die. \u201d Mr. Michael responded on Twitter, \u201cTo my lovelies, do not believe this rubbish in the papers today by someone I don\u2019t know anymore and haven\u2019t seen for nearly 18 years. \u201d He added, \u201cI am perfectly fine. \u201d Rather than dwell on Mr. Michael\u2019s difficulties, some close friends on Monday highlighted another dimension of the man they knew, describing him as a generous benefactor given to quiet and spontaneous acts of kindness. \u201cHe was a closet philanthropist,\u201d Mr. Gambaccini said. Mr. Gambaccini recalled how in 1994 the British government cut aid to the Terrence Higgins Trust, an AIDS charity. To make up for the shortfall, Mr. Gambaccini, a patron of the trust, said he had sought to raise 300, 000 pounds. But in the end, he did not have to try too hard, he said. Mr. Michael donated most of the money. \u201cHe never wanted public recognition,\u201d Mr. Gambaccini said. The television presenter Richard Osman wrote on Twitter on Monday that Mr. Michael had secretly contacted a woman who appeared on \u201cDeal or No Deal,\u201d a British game show, to give her \u00a315, 000 needed for an in vitro fertilization treatment. Sali Hughes, an author, wrote on Twitter that Mr. Michael had once tipped a waitress \u00a35, 000 \u201cbecause she was a student nurse in debt. \u201d And Emilyne Mondo, a volunteer at a shelter for homeless people, posted that Mr. Michael had worked there anonymously. \u201cI\u2019ve never told anyone,\u201d she said. \u201cHe asked we didn\u2019t. That\u2019s who he was. \u201d For some neighbors of Mr. Michael, his turn away from the spotlight and toward personal privacy made him just another member of the community. Amanda Holland, 56, a neighbor of Mr. Michael in    in Oxfordshire, and an amateur actor, once invited him to a play in which she was performing. \u201cHe\u2019s an international superstar  \u2014   I thought, \u2018There\u2019s no way he would come to a local thing,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cBut he did, and he was fabulous, and he was kind and he was generous. \u201d Mr. Michael, whose legal name was Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou, was born in 1963, the youngest of three children of Kyriacos Panayiotou, a Greek Cypriot immigrant, and the former Lesley Angold Harrison. He formed Wham! with a schoolmate, Andrew Ridgeley, who wrote on Twitter on Sunday that he was \u201ccleft with grief. \u201d Mr. Michael was famous by age 20. \u201cI\u2019m not stupid enough to think that I can deal with another 10 or 15 years of major exposure,\u201d Mr. Michael told The Los Angeles Times in a 1990 interview. \u201cI think that is the ultimate tragedy of fame.   \u2026     People who are simply out of control, who are lost. I\u2019ve seen so many of them, and I don\u2019t want to be another clich\u00e9. \u201d (The interview prompted a retort from Frank Sinatra, who wrote to him in an open letter: \u201cBe grateful to carry the baggage we\u2019ve all had to carry since those lean nights of sleeping on buses and helping the driver unload the instruments. \u201d) Mr. Michael  \u2014   known for hits like \u201cWake Me Up Before You \u201d \u201cFaith\u201d and \u201cCareless Whisper\u201d  \u2014   famously came out as gay in 1998, after the end of a protracted legal battle with Sony Music, and shortly after he had been arrested on charges of lewd conduct in a men\u2019s room in Beverly Hills, Calif. In a 2004 interview with the British edition of GQ, Mr. Michael spoke frankly about losing his partner, Anselmo Feleppa, a Brazilian, to AIDS in 1993. At the time of Mr. Feleppa\u2019s death, Mr. Michael was still in the closet, and the antiretroviral drugs that helped AIDS become a manageable disease, and not necessarily a fatal one, had yet to become widely available. \u201cI\u2019m still convinced that had he been in the U. S. A. or London, he would have survived, because just six months later everyone was on combination therapy,\u201d Mr. Michael said in the interview. \u201cI think he went to Brazil because he feared what my fame would do to him and his family if he got treatment elsewhere. I was devastated by that. \u201d Mr. Michael\u2019s mother died a few years later, leading to depression, he said. \u201cLosing your mother and your lover in the space of three years is a tough one. \u201d His final tour, \u201cSymphonica,\u201d ended in the fall of 2012, and a live album drawn from those performances, released in 2014, represented his most recent commercial output. (\u201cPatience,\u201d his previous album of original songs, was released in 2004.) There was some potential movement in his career of late. This year, Mr. Michael received a bump in   relevance when the film \u201cKeanu,\u201d a comedy from   Key and Jordan Peele, featured his music prominently in its plot  \u2014   and not as the butt of a joke, as Mr. Michael had come to be treated by some, especially after his 1998 arrest in Beverly Hills. The filmmakers assured Mr. Michael\u2019s manager, Mr. Lippman, that they would use his music respectfully. \u201cA golden opportunity dropped in our laps,\u201d Mr. Lippman told Billboard, and then went on to tease the rerelease of Mr. Michael\u2019s 1990 solo album, \u201cListen Without Prejudice Vol. 1,\u201d which had been expected this fall. \u201cWe were trying to find as much exposure as possible. \u201d (That reissue was subsequently pushed back to March 2017, to coincide with a documentary, \u201cFreedom,\u201d about Mr. Michael\u2019s life.) The producer Naughty Boy, who has worked with Beyonc\u00e9 and Sam Smith, told the BBC this month that new music from Mr. Michael was also a possibility. \u201cHe\u2019s got an album coming out next year, and he\u2019s going to be doing something for my album as well,\u201d Naughty Boy said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to expect. And, to be honest, he\u2019s more mysterious than anyone else, so I\u2019m actually excited. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628510.8043594}
