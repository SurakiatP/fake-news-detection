[\u201cI happen to believe that the Democratic Party has been not doing a good job in terms of communicating with people in cities, in towns and in rural America, all over this country,\u201d Sanders said in an interview on NPR\u2019s Morning Edition.  The Vermont senator, who ran for president on the Democratic ticket and then switched back to Independent after losing the primary to defeated former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, added, \u201cLook, you can\u2019t simply go around to wealthy people\u2019s homes raising money and expect to win elections. You\u2019ve got to go out and mix it up and be with ordinary people. \u201d Sanders and Trump both ran on a platform that pushed against the political establishment, and both were successful at tapping into the   base. However, it was arguably Clinton\u2019s decision to ignore her husband\u2019s advice that contributed most to her loss in the general election. Former President Bill Clinton suggested that Hillary court   white men, a demographic that has long been ignored by the Democratic Party. Sanders told NPR that Trump has a choice: \u201cEither he can have the courage and get up in front of the American people, or do it through a Tweet, and say, \u2018You know what? Hey, I was just kidding. I was really lying. \u2019\u201d Or, he suggested, Trump can tell his fellow Republicans that \u201cthe right thing to do\u201d is stop wasting their time on legislation that cuts programs. \u201cAnd I look forward to Trump telling the American people that that is what he intends to do,\u201d Sanders said. It is unlikely Trump will take up either of Sanders\u2019 suggestions. Sanders and other Democratic leaders have called for a \u201cDay of Action\u201d on January 15  \u2014   ahead of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day  \u2014   \u201cto vigorously oppose the Republican plan to end Medicare as we know it and throw our health care system into chaos,\u201d according to a December 28 letter addressed to colleagues and signed by Sanders, Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer ( ) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( ). The letter adds, \u201cMillions of Americans voted for Donald Trump after he promised not to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. He must be held to his promises and should veto any legislation which cuts these vital and necessary health programs. \u201d Follow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter and Periscope @AdelleNaz'"}, "time": 1742628584.6874554}
