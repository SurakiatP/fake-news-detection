Trump told Larry King that he had been paid more than $1 million to give a speech about his business acumen when in fact he was paid $400, 000. Or the time he sought a bank loan claiming a net worth of $3. 5 billion in 2004, four times as much as what the bank found when it checked his math. Or the time he boasted that membership to Trump National Golf Club in Westchester County, N. Y. cost $300, 000 when the actual initiation fee was $200, 000. Or the time he bragged on CNBC about his new Trump International Hotel and Tower in Las Vegas, claiming, \u201cWe have 1, 282 units, and they sold out in less than a week. \u201d As Mr. Trump knew, more than 300 units had not been sold. Confronted in a court case about this last untruth, Mr. Trump was anything but chagrined. \u201cI\u2019m talking to a television station,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do want to put the best spin on the property. \u201d As Mr. Trump prepares to claim the Republican nomination for president this week, he and his supporters are sure to laud his main calling card  \u2014   his long, operatic record as a swaggering business tycoon. And without question, there will be successes aplenty to highlight, from his gleaming golden   to his   golf resorts, hit TV shows and   books. But a survey of Mr. Trump\u2019s four decades of wheeling and dealing also reveals an equally operatic record of dissembling and deception, some of it unabashedly confirmed by Mr. Trump himself, who nearly 30 years ago first extolled the business advantages of \u201ctruthful hyperbole. \u201d Indeed, based on the mountain of court records churned out over the span of Mr. Trump\u2019s career, it is hard to find a project he touched that did not produce allegations of broken promises, blatant lies or outright fraud. Under the intense scrutiny of a presidential election, many of those allegations have already become familiar campaign fodder: the Trump University students and Trump condo buyers who say they were fleeced the public servants from New Jersey to Scotland who now say they rue the zoning approvals, licenses or tax breaks they gave based on Mr. Trump\u2019s promises the   contractors who say Mr. Trump concocted complaints about their work to avoid paying them the infuriated business partners who say Mr. Trump concealed profits or ignored contractual obligations the business journalists and stock analysts who say Mr. Trump smeared them for critical coverage. Taken as a whole, though, an examination of Mr. Trump\u2019s business career reveals persistent patterns in the way Mr. Trump bends or breaks the truth  \u2014   patterns that may already feel familiar to those watching his campaign. First and foremost is Mr. Trump\u2019s tendency toward the   fib  \u2014   as if it were not impressive enough to be paid $400, 000 for a speech. What also emerges is a nearly reflexive habit of telling his target audience precisely what he thinks it wants to hear  \u2014   such as promising Trump University students they will learn all his real estate secrets from his \u201chandpicked\u201d instructors. And finally, there is the pattern already deeply familiar to his political opponents  \u2014   making spurious claims against adversaries under Mr. Trump\u2019s   theory that the best defense is a   offense. Equally striking is his Houdiniesque ability to wiggle away from all but the most skilled and determined efforts to corner him in an apparent lie. In interviews, lawyers who have tangled with Mr. Trump in court cases are sometimes reduced to sputtering, astonished rage, calling him \u201cborderline pathological\u201d and \u201cthe Michelangelo of deception\u201d as they attempt to describe the ease with which Mr. Trump weaves his own versions of reality. \u201cHe\u2019s a bully, and bullies aren\u2019t known for their veracity,\u201d said Richard C. Seltzer, a retired senior partner at the law firm Kaye Scholer who confronted Mr. Trump in three real estate lawsuits. In a telephone interview on Friday, Mr. Trump defended his integrity as a businessman  \u2014   \u201cI shoot very straight\u201d  \u2014   and argued that those who accuse him of acting in bad faith are often the same people he has outmaneuvered in deals. \u201cWhat, you\u2019re going to quote people that I\u2019ve beat? Are you going to quote people that I  ?\u201d he asked, adding, \u201cI\u2019ll give you hundreds of names of people that have dealt with me that say I\u2019m very honest. \u201d Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, is already hard at work making the case that Mr. Trump\u2019s   business record is a harbinger of how he would mislead from the Oval Office. Her campaign has even put up a    website: www. artofthesteal. biz. Mr. Trump\u2019s business record may help explain why various   have barely been able to keep pace with his false claims on the campaign trail. PolitiFact has labeled 34 of Mr. Trump\u2019s assertions \u201cPants on Fire\u201d lies. As of July 1, The Washington Post had   46 statements by Mr. Trump. It gave 70 percent of them its worst rating, four Pinocchios  \u2014   a record so abysmal that the newspaper recently compiled a video of what it called \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s most outrageous   claims. \u201d The taxonomy of Mr. Trump\u2019s business deceptions has been the subject of legal and journalistic scrutiny for decades. A Fortune magazine article from 2000 memorably described Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201castonishing ability to prevaricate\u201d this way: \u201cBut when Trump says he owns 10 percent of the Plaza Hotel, understand that what he actually means is that he has the right to 10 percent of the profit if it\u2019s ever sold. When he says he\u2019s building a \u2018  building\u2019 next to the U. N. he means a   building that has   ceilings. And when he says his casino company is the \u2018largest employer in the state of New Jersey,\u2019 he actually means to say it is the eighth largest. \u201d The casino magnate Steve Wynn, a sometimes friend and sometimes foe of Mr. Trump\u2019s, took up the subject of Mr. Trump\u2019s honesty in an interview with New York magazine. \u201cHis statements to people like you, whether they concern us and our projects or our motivations or his own reality or his own future or his own present you have seen over the years have no relation to truth or fact,\u201d Mr. Wynn said. Some of the earliest documented examples of Mr. Trump\u2019s deceptive business tactics come from none other than Mr. Trump, who in books and in interviews sometimes seems to delight in describing the brazen bluffs and   trickery he used to claw his way to the upper echelons of New York City\u2019s cutthroat real estate world. \u201cYou have to understand where I was coming from,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote in his 1987    \u201cThe Art of the Deal. \u201d \u201cWhile there are certainly honorable people in the real estate business, I was more accustomed to the sort of people with whom you don\u2019t want to waste the effort of a handshake because you know it\u2019s meaningless. \u201d Mr. Trump was particularly proud of a stratagem he employed in 1982, when he was trying to entice Holiday Inn to invest in a casino he was building in Atlantic City. The board of directors decided to visit Atlantic City, which worried Mr. Trump because he had precious little actual construction to show off. So Mr. Trump ordered his construction supervisor to cram every bulldozer and dump truck he could find into the nearly vacant construction site. \u201cWhat the bulldozers and dump trucks did wasn\u2019t important, I said, so long as they did a lot of it. If they got some actual work accomplished, all the better, but if necessary, he should have the bulldozers dig up dirt from one side of the site and dump it on the other. \u201d A week later, when Mr. Trump escorted the Holiday Inn executives to the site, one board member wanted to know why a worker was filling a hole he had just dug. \u201cThis was difficult for me to answer, but fortunately, this board member was more curious than he was skeptical,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote, boasting that weeks later Holiday Inn agreed to invest in his casino. \u201cThat\u2019s called \u2018business,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump said on Friday of the episode. In court cases against Mr. Trump  \u2014   USA Today counted 3, 500 lawsuits involving Mr. Trump, and Mr. Trump estimates he has testified more than 100 times  \u2014   plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers frequently return to the same two paragraphs from \u201cThe Art of the Deal. \u201d \u201cI call it truthful hyperbole. It\u2019s an innocent form of exaggeration  \u2014   and a very effective form of promotion. \u201d In depositions, lawyers have repeatedly probed for the limits of Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201ctruthful hyperbole,\u201d or, as one lawyer framed it, the distinction Mr. Trump makes between \u201cinnocent exaggeration\u201d and \u201cguilty exaggeration. \u201d For example, in the   Trump University litigation, Mr. Trump was asked in a deposition about a script that had been prepared for Trump University instructors. According to the script, the instructors were supposed to tell their students the following: \u201cI remember one time Mr. Trump said to us over dinner, he said, \u2018Real estate is the only market that, when there\u2019s a sale going on, people run from the store.\u2019 You don\u2019t want to run from the store. \u201d No such dinners ever took place, Mr. Trump acknowledged. In fact, Mr. Trump struggled to identify a single one of the instructors he claimed to have handpicked, even after he was shown their photographs. Nonetheless, Mr. Trump was not bothered by the script\u2019s false insinuation of real estate secrets shared over chummy dinners. Asked if this example constituted \u201cinnocent exaggeration,\u201d Mr. Trump replied, \u201cYes, I\u2019d say that\u2019s an innocent exaggeration. \u201d On Friday, Mr. Trump argued that the script might fall under the legal concept of \u201cpuffery\u201d  \u2014   which many legal dictionaries define as an exaggeration or statement that \u201cno reasonable person\u201d would take as factual. And in any event, he continued, the true sinners in the Trump University case are the students who sued him even after giving rave reviews in their written evaluations of the seminars. \u201cI think that\u2019s dishonest,\u201d he said. Mr. Trump has been repeatedly accused of bringing false legal claims to avoid paying debts and evade contractual obligations. As far back as 1983, a New York City housing court judge ruled that Mr. Trump filed a \u201cspurious\u201d lawsuit to harass a tenant into vacating a Trump building. Then there was the case Mr. Trump brought against Barbara Corcoran, the real estate broker best known for her appearances on \u201cShark Tank. \u201d In the   Mr. Trump owed millions of dollars to Ms. Corcoran for helping him secure financing for a development. But when New York magazine published a cover story about the troubled project  \u2014   \u201cTrump\u2019s   Experience\u201d  \u2014   Mr. Trump sued Ms. Corcoran, accusing her and her associates of sharing damaging information with the magazine and thus violating a confidentiality agreement. He refused to pay her the millions he owed, claiming her breach had gravely damaged his business. At trial, Mr. Trump was unable to produce a single document showing harm to his business. But his certitude never wavered, even after Ms. Corcoran\u2019s lawyer, Mr. Seltzer, confronted him with article after article in which Mr. Trump himself had discussed with reporters much of the same \u201cconfidential\u201d information he accused Ms. Corcoran\u2019s team of divulging. \u201cThere is something very belligerent about the way he presents facts, as if he thinks nobody will have the balls to stand up to him,\u201d Mr. Seltzer said in an interview. (In dismissing Mr. Trump\u2019s suit against Ms. Corcoran, the judge said the only damages he could identify were to Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cbruised ego. \u201d) In Friday\u2019s interview, Mr. Trump denied filing frivolous court cases, insisting, \u201cI\u2019ve won a massive majority of the litigation I\u2019ve been involved in. \u201d He pointed to the USA Today survey of his 3, 500 legal cases. Although the newspaper could not determine who had prevailed in the vast majority of the cases, it did find Mr. Trump the clear winner in 450 suits and the clear loser in 38. And, indeed, for all of the litigation Mr. Trump has attracted or spawned, for all of the times he has been accused of ruinous dishonesty, the legal and regulatory record is surprisingly bare of official findings by judges, juries or regulators that Mr. Trump engaged in perjury or improper deception or actual fraud. A rare exception came after Mr. Trump decided to demolish a department store to make way for his Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan. Mr. Trump\u2019s demolition contractor hired about 200 unauthorized Polish laborers, paying them as little as $4 an hour to work 12 hours a day, seven days a week. The case ended up in federal court after some workers were shortchanged even these wages. Mr. Trump protested that he knew nothing about the use of unauthorized workers  \u2014   even though workers testified that they saw him visiting the site and some witnesses said that Mr. Trump and the executive he assigned to oversee the demolition were well aware of what was going on. In 1991, a federal judge, Charles E. Stewart Jr. ruled that despite Mr. Trump\u2019s denials, there was \u201cstrong evidence\u201d that he and his subordinates and his contractor had conspired to hire the Polish workers and deprive them of employment benefits. He awarded them $325, 415 in damages. But in case after case, Mr. Trump has displayed a special talent for turning what should be cold hard facts into semantic mush. Perhaps the most famous example of this skill came when Mr. Trump was asked under oath a seemingly straightforward question: Had he ever lied about his net worth? Mr. Trump responded, \u201cMy net worth fluctuates and it goes up and down with markets and with attitudes and with feelings, even my own feelings. \u201d So, he explained in a deposition, when he said membership costs $300, 000 to his Westchester golf club, that included the $200, 000 initiation fee plus every cent he guessed that a member might spend on annual dues over the next 20 or 30 years. In other words, \u201cThe way I say it is more accurate. \u201d And when he told Larry King he was paid more than $1 million for a speech, it was not his fault if viewers failed to realize he was including not just his $400, 000 speaking fee but also the hundreds of thousands of dollars he assumed must have been spent promoting his appearance. Part of what makes Mr. Trump such an elusive target is that his paper trail is often minimal. Mr. Trump has repeatedly testified that he does not use computers. He says he also throws away his day planner each month, and just last year he testified that he did not own a smartphone. \u201cUnlike Hillary Clinton, I\u2019m not a big email fan,\u201d he said, leaving open the question of how he posts to Twitter. Mr. Trump is also adept at deflecting blame to his staff. In two of his books, Mr. Trump made the startling and, as it turned out, bogus claim that he had once performed the remarkable feat of climbing out from under more than $9 billion in debt. Mr. Trump blamed his ghostwriter for the mistake. Asked if he reads his books before publication, Mr. Trump said, \u201cI read it as quickly as I can because of time constraints. \u201d Mr. Trump is also the beneficiary of miraculously   memory lapses. In suit after suit, the man who claims to possess one of world\u2019s best memories suddenly seems to have chronic memory loss when asked about critical facts or events. Such was the case when Mr. Trump filed a libel lawsuit against Timothy L. O\u2019Brien, the author of \u201cTrumpNation: The Art of Being the Donald. \u201d Among other things, Mr. Trump asserted that \u201cTrumpNation\u201d cost him a \u201cdeal made in heaven\u201d with a group of Italian investors, men he had met and who were on the brink of signing a business partnership that would have made him hundreds of millions of dollars. Their names? He could not recall. \u201cTrumpNation\u201d also cost him a hotel deal with Russian investors, he said. He could not remember their names, either. He was certain the book also ruined a deal with Turkish investors. Again, he could not recall any names. Polish investors also got cold feet after they read Mr. O\u2019Brien\u2019s book. Their names escaped him, too. The book also scared off investors from Ukraine. Alas, he could not think of their names either. Mr. Trump\u2019s lawsuit was dismissed.'"}, "time": 1742562196.5275533}
