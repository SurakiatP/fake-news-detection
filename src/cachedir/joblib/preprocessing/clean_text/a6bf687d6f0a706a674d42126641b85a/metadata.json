Smith 21st Century Wire \\nThe election campaign might be over, but the mainstream media\u2019s campaign against President Elect Donald Trump is in full swing. \\nBetween all of the fake polling, intentionally pro-Clinton partisan coverage, and mainstream media collusion with the Democratic National Party and the Clinton Campaign exposed through WikiLeaks\u2019 Podesta email dump \u2013 nearly the entire US mainstream media is now in full damage-limitation mode desperately trying to preserve any crumb of credibility and perceived authority they might have left. \\nIt\u2019s now become clear that the media is guilty on multiple fronts, as more proof has emerged of how they are helping to stoke violence, while promoting unfounded fears \u2013 and all the while pushing fictional \u2018hate crime\u2019 hoaxes. \\nCBS News flagship investigative program 60 Minutes conducted a recorded interview with Trump on Friday in which he made a direct plea on camera to any possible supporters to \u201cStop it,\u201d in reference to anyone that may have written racist slogans or abusive language in public, or at schools. In light of the numerous pockets of protests and outbreaks of partisan violence which have racked America since the election results were announced last week, it would have been in the public interest to release this powerful appeal by Trump, but instead mainstream CBS buried it for 3 days until 60 Minutes was scheduled to air later on Sunday evening nationwide. If CBS had any credibility remaining, this certainly will have finished it off. \\nWhen told about alleged reports of a \u2018Trump supporter\u2019 who were said to have been harassing Latinos and Muslims following his presidential win, Trump told interviewer Leslie Stahl , \u201cI am so saddened to hear that.\u201d He then added, \u201cAnd I say, \u2018Stop it.\u2019 If it helps, I will say this \u2013 and I will say right to the cameras: \u2018Stop it.\\'\u201d \\nOne big thing in this incident that many mainstream media observers did not pick up is that at no time did Stahl give any specifics on these alleged \u201cabuses\u201d by Trump supporters against Muslims and Latinos, and even though it\u2019s obvious that Trump was not responsible for directing any alleged abuses \u2013 Stahl still demanded an apology on their behalf \u2013 without offering any evidence to support her claim. This was \u2018drive-by\u2019 media at its worst. In fact, not one of these said accusations of abuse have been properly investigated by the media, and some may end up actually being media-generated rumors, or even hoaxes. \\nNow, it\u2019s perfectly understandable that Trump\u2019s victory over the establishment\u2019s heavily inflated candidate Hillary Clinton has left many Democrats, especially millennial college-aged students upset, angry and feeling more than a little delicate due to their bruised collective egos (they are not upset that Trump won, as much as they are upset that \u2018they\u2019 lost). The real problem exists far beyond the learned immaturity of America\u2019s politically correct-obsessed young adults. The real danger is that Democratic Party gutter operatives and their liberal media cohorts are actually staging, and fabricating \u201chate crime\u201d incidents in order to propagate the idea that the President Elect and his supporters are somehow \u201ccausing many minorities fearful about the future\u201d. In reality, much of this hype is being generated through these same liberal media outlets. \\nIn fact, one Muslim female from Louisiana has since been forced to apologize for inventing her alleged \u2018hate crime\u2019 incident \u2013 one designed to discredit Trump, and to help stoke more nationwide protests. \\nBuzzfeed reported, via Religion of Peace : \\nA woman who claimed she was attacked and robbed by two men near the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, including one wearing a Donald Trump hat, made up the story, police said in a statement. \\nThe woman had alleged the men yelled obscenities at her and took away her wallet and hijab, a scarf sometimes worn by Muslim women, The Advertiser reported. \\nLafayette Police officials said in a statement the incident is no longer under investigation, the paper reported. \\n\u201cDuring the course of the investigation, the female complainant admitted that she fabricated the story about her physical attack as well as the removal of her hijab and wallet by two white males,\u201d the statement reportedly read. \\nNOTE: This story made national headlines and was not questioned or challenged by the hordes of self-described \u201cjournalists\u201d who populate the news and editorial newsrooms of America\u2019s corrupt liberal mainstream media. \\nThat\u2019s right \u2013 this was just another hoax: \\nViolent Democratic-Affiliated Street Gangs \\nWhat Leslie Stahl and the rest of the gatekeepers at CBS and 60 Minutes have obscured is the fact since Tuesday\u2019s election, nearly all of the so-called \u2018violent hate crimes\u2019 have been carried out against Trump supporters \u2013 by street gangs who are most clearly Democrat Party supporters. \\nHere are just a few examples: @michellemalkin Even high school kids are not spared. Student Trump supporter attacked at Woodside High School https://t.co/e7tVvDJ6O8 \\n\u2014 Mama Angel (@Mommysaurus75) November 11, 2016 \\nWatch this clip taken from the radical leftist Portland protests this weekend, where Democratic Party supports attack a single woman in her car because they believed that she was a \u2018Trump supporter.\u2019 These violent incidents reveal the flavor of anarchy which the Democratic Party and the sitting President of the United States, Barack Obama \u2013 are condoning through their deaf silence over the multiple reports of street violence unleashed with the help of the Democratic Party\u2019s online \u2018community organizer\u2019 network MoveOn.org \u2013 a digital platform partly funded by leading Clinton donor and billionaire George Soros . Watch this stunning clip: \\n. Here is a video of clip of a white male in Chicago, 49 yr old David Wilcox, who was driving and scraped another vehicle. When the two parties stopped at the intersection to exchange insurance information, Wilcox was greeted by a gang of African-Americans, presumably Democratic Party supporters, who began pointing and shouting, \u201cYou voted for Donald Trump!\u201d before beating and robbing the man in the middle of the street. Wilcox was then dragged hundreds of yards as he tried to keep the gang from stealing his car in broad daylight. He was treated for multiple wounds at a local hospital. \\nFrom reports we learned that at no time before the attack took place did Wilcox display any support for Donald Trump. It appears as if they attacked him because he was white. So could one call this a case of black on white racism? Regardless, it\u2019s political intimidation done on the street \u2013 which could also be defined as pure political fascism. In this instance, the violence was partisan, and carried out by what could be classed as unofficial Democrat foot soldiers \u2013 enforcing a type of radical political regime on the streets of America. Watch this disturbing video: . Agitator and Chief: Where is Obama? \\nThese incidents have been mostly blacked out by a national US media who are obviously still working to discredit the Trump Presidency. \\nAmidst all this violence, however, where is the current President Obama, or the Democratic Party\u2019s losing candidate Hillary Clinton \u2013 to help calm street thugs and violent \u2018progressives\u2019? It\u2019s almost as if Obama and Clinton are enjoying the unrest. Most certainly though, Obama, Clinton and the Democratic Party are hoping to use this week\u2019s media-generated liberal angst as future political leverage. \\nWhat used to be regarded as a reputable investigative news program, 60 minutes, has gradually become a joke. It seems disinterested in covering anything of genuine interest, opting instead for running bland People Magazine and Time Magazine-style \u2018safe\u2019 segments. Judging by its plummeting ratings, and its predictable cast of \u2018job for life\u2019 government-approved media gatekeeper-cum-commentators like Anderson Cooper and Lesley Stahl, there is little hope for this institution. You might even say it\u2019s irredeemable . \\nOne of the corporate mainstream\u2019s worst offenders during the election was CNN host Brian Stelter (photo, left), whose own show is ironically titled \u201cReliable Sources.\u201d Stelter is meant to be CNN\u2019s media watchdog person, laughably given the lofty title as \u201csenior media analyst.\u201d After leading CNN\u2019s own exposed efforts to obscure and derail Trump\u2019s Presidential run, while working to cover for a hugely unpopular (even among Democrats) Hillary Clinton candidacy, Stelter has now taken it upon himself to revamp his network\u2019s horrible reputation as an establishment gatekeeper and manipulator of US elections. But it\u2019s too late. The damage has already been done, and CNN will not regain the hanging facade of credibility it once struggled to retain. They are a dirty media outlet, and now everyone knows it. \\nNow CBS News has been exposed in public view, but their crime is even worse than CNN\u2019s which was just dirty politics in comparison. CBS News took it upon itself to compromise public safety, and put lives at risk \u2013 all for its own selfish institutional political position. Twenty years ago, this might have been considered shameful, but in today\u2019s toxic liberal media establishment ruled by an unhealthy feeling of superiority over the unwashed masses \u2013 they are all way past shameless at this stage. \\nNone of them can be trusted anymore \u2013 only tolerated, in the hope that they might actually report some useful news in the coming years. \\nMore on the CBS 60 Minutes scandal from The Hill\u2026 \\nCOSMETIC: CBS\u2019s Stahl represents the shallow, bland irrelevance of the mainstream gatekeeping media. \\nJoe Concha The Hill \\nCBS News is under fire for holding a videotaped clip from a Friday interview with President-elect Donald Trump urging supporters not to attack minorities until a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d broadcast on Sunday night. \\n\u201cI am very surprised to hear that. I hate to hear it,\u201d Trump told interviewer Lesley Stahl when told of some attacks on minorities that have reportedly occurred since his election victory Tuesday. \\n\u201cI am so sorry to hear it, and I say stop it,\u201d Trump said before looking directly into the camera. \u201cAnd I say right to the camera, stop it.\u201d \\n\u201c60 Minutes\u201d did release quotes from the Friday interview in advance, but only a statement by Trump on the Affordable Care Act. \\n\u201cWe chose to release a quote on the issue that affects the most Americans & that was his statement on Obamacare,\u201d a spokesperson for CBS told CNN Monday. \\nKai Ryssdal, host of \u201cMarketplace,\u201d called that reasoning \u201ccompletely underwhelming.\u201d CBS\\'s underwhelming answer: \"We chose to release a quote on the issue that affects the most Americans & that was his statement on Obamacare\" \\n\u2014 Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) November 14, 2016 \\nProtests have grown in the wake of Trump\u2019s victory in major cities across the country. \\nNot all protests have been peaceful. A protester was shot in Portland last Thursday and hospitalized. Hundreds of arrests have been made, property has been damaged and traffic has snarled due to roads being blocked by protesters chanting \u201cImpeach Trump\u201d and \u201cNot my president.\u201d\u2026 \\nREAD MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files \\nSUPPORT 21WIRE \u2013 SUBSCRIBE NOW & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV'"}, "time": 1742563168.975234}
