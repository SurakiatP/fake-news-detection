Ted Cruz ( ) dismissed the seriousness of a Washington Post report from a day earlier that alleged Attorney General Jeff Sessions failed to disclose meeting with Russian officials in his AG confirmation hearing as \u201cpolitical theater. \u201d  Cruz, Sessions\u2019 former colleague on the Senate Armed Services Committee,  called the underlying meeting a \u201cnothing burger\u201d and argued against an investigation into the matter. Transcript as follows: MIKA BRZEZINSKI, MSNBC HOST: Joining us now from Capitol Hill, member of the Judiciary and Armed Services Committees, Republican senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Senator, thank you for being on. JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC HOST: Senator, great to have you here. SEN. TED CRUZ (R) TEXAS: Good morning. SCARBOROUGH: Great to have you here. You are an attorney and certainly can read testimony. I was saying this morning that the Leahy question and answer wasn\u2019t as troubling because, of course, it was about the campaign. Are you concerned, though, about the Al Franken questioning and answering, where Sessions seemed to volunteer that he had never spoken with any Russian officials? CRUZ: You know, Joe, I\u2019m not concerned about that. I think what we are seeing is a lot of political theater. Could Jeff have been more clear in what he said? Yes. I think it  \u2014   that was unfortunate. But I think context matters a lot. Jeff was being asked about the Trump campaign communicating with the Russians. I think he understood that he was answering in that capacity. And that is perfectly understandable. And the reason I say it\u2019s political theater is the underlying meeting, you know, this morning, everyone is in high dungeon about the meeting. The underlying meeting is a nothing burger. It\u2019s what senators do every day, meeting with foreign ambassadors that\u2019s part of the job. And Jeff is a  \u2014   was a very   senator he will be a   attorney general. And so I think everyone is getting all worked up because it\u2019s a chance to beat up the attorney general and beat up the president. But I think the underlying meeting is simply doing his job. WILLIE GEIST, MSNBC HOST: Senator Cruz, it\u2019s Willie Geist. It\u2019s good to see you. You also are  \u2014   sit on the Armed Services Committee with Senator Sessions. Did you meet with the Russian ambassador last summer? CRUZ: You know, I didn\u2019t. But it\u2019s interesting, when this story broke last night, I asked my team to just pull up the calendar for January and February of this year. And I met with six different ambassadors in the last two months. That\u2019s part of being a senator. And you know, a minute ago, Joe was asking, well, gosh, when Al Franken was questioning Jeff Sessions and he  \u2014   and Jeff Sessions was saying, that, as the Trump campaign, as a surrogate, he didn\u2019t meet with Russia, you know, I\u2019m willing to bet Al Franken has met with a great number of ambassadors. I\u2019m also willing to bet that when Al Franken meets with foreign ambassadors, he didn\u2019t consider it the Hillary campaign meeting with them. Al Franken was supporting Hillary Clinton, he was a surrogate for Hillary Clinton. But when he\u2019s doing his job as a senator, he\u2019s not a representative of the campaign. I think the same was exactly true for Jeff Sessions when he was doing his job as a senator. GEIST: But, Senator, we are talking about the Russian ambassador in the middle of all these questions surrounding links between the Trump campaign and the government of Russia. Why, specifically, did you and, according to all the reporting, no other member of the Armed Service Committee not seek a meeting with the Russian ambassador? CRUZ: Well, listen, by and large, I haven\u2019t sought meetings with ambassadors. Typically, they call the office and want to talk with me. And you know, if the Russian ambassador had called and asked for a meeting, I imagine I probably would have taken the meeting. And that\u2019s part of the job. But it\u2019s  \u2014   I can\u2019t recall an instance where I\u2019ve reached out to an ambassador and said, let\u2019s do a meeting. But different countries want to come by. They want to discuss different issues. They\u2019re concerned about  \u2014   that\u2019s part of doing your job when you are on the Armed Services Committee. I\u2019m on the Armed Services Committee. I served with Jeff. I\u2019m on the Judiciary Committee. I served with Jeff. And you know, one of the things that\u2019s important, you know, you see Democratic politicians this morning coming out and blasting Jeff and saying things like that this was misleading. You know, many of  \u2014   many of us have served with Jeff for years, sometimes decades in the Senate. Jeff Sessions is a man of integrity, he\u2019s a man of candor. I don\u2019t know any senator who served with Jeff Sessions, Democrat or Republican, who would say that Jeff has been anything less than totally honest. Now they don\u2019t like that he\u2019s a conservative. You know, the Democrats don\u2019t like Jeff as a conservative. But he is very open and honest about his views. And, by the way, Jeff has been a serious critic of Russia. He\u2019s not been shy calling out Putin. So the notion that there was something somehow wrong with a senior senator on the Armed Services Committee meeting with a foreign ambassador, I think that\u2019s a nothing burger. And the testimony Jeff should have been more clear. I think he said that he wished he was more clear. But, at the end of the day, I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s any there there. GEIST: So do you  \u2014   you\u2019ve said repeatedly now that the meeting that Senator Sessions had with the Russian ambassador is a, quote, \u201cnothing burger. \u201d Do you have information, Senator, about what they talked about in that meeting? How do you know it\u2019s a nothing burger? CRUZ: I know that meeting with a foreign ambassador is part of the routine responsibilities of serving in the Senate. I have no idea what was talked about in that meeting or any other meeting that  \u2014   you know, my understanding is Jeff met with 25 different ambassadors last year. And I don\u2019t know what was discussed in those meetings. I don\u2019t know what was discussed  \u2014   GEIST: But not the Russian ambassador, right, Senator? CRUZ: Well, among the 25 that Sessions met with last year was the Russian ambassador. GEIST: But you haven\u2019t met nor have any of the other members of Armed Services with the Russian ambassador? CRUZ: Well, my understanding of \u201cThe Washington Post\u201d reporting is they asked  \u2014   six didn\u2019t respond. So we don\u2019t know that none have. Of those that responded, they said they hadn\u2019t met last year. But you know, I was watching on another show, Mike Rogers, who was chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, he said, sure he\u2019d met with the Russian ambassador. If you are doing your job, you meet with ambassadors and foreign leaders. And that\u2019s part of the job. HALPERIN: Senator, it\u2019s been reported, I don\u2019t have it confirmed myself, that this meeting is being investigated by federal investigators. There\u2019s clearly now an appearance issue, even if, as you\u2019ve suggested, that thing\u2019s a nothing burger. Stipulating all you said about your former colleague, is it still possible that recusal is the right thing in your mind? CRUZ: Well, I think earlier on the show, you played Jeff Sessions this morning, saying that he would recuse himself where appropriate. I mean, obviously, if there were an investigation into himself, recusal would be appropriate. I don\u2019t have any indication that there would be an investigation because I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any credible allegation that Jeff did anything wrong in meeting with the Russian ambassador. He was  \u2014   he didn\u2019t speak as clearly as he should. Although I will note, Jeff had an   marathon hearing, where he was getting hammered. And Jeff is  \u2014   was answering as candidly, as directly as possible. And I think in context, he was answering no as part of the Trump campaign he wasn\u2019t meeting with the Russians. And my understanding is he wasn\u2019t thinking about his role as a senator. But I don\u2019t see anything for there to be an investigation. But of course there, if there was into him directly, any official would recuse themselves from an investigation into their own conduct.
