The actor says   activists are wrong to think putting an end to abortion will save lives.  \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of disinformation about Planned Parenthood and the focus of the lifesaving work that they do for women\u2019s health care,\u201d the actor told Glamour magazine in an interview, adding: \u201cI saw a   image of all those white men sitting around in a room at the White House talking about what should be done about women\u2019s health care, and I thought I would step up [by wearing this and speaking out]. If Planned Parenthood is defunded, millions of women, particularly women struggling economically, are going to be in serious trouble. And the truth is, there will be far more abortions performed \u2014  and unsafe ones as a result. The people that are antiabortion actually are sabotaging their own moral stance by taking this position. \u201d Glamour writer Jessica Radloff praised Goldwyn for his support of the abortion giant, and also cited Planned Parenthood\u2019s already debunked \u201c3 percent\u201d statistic: \u201cAs we\u2019ve pointed out numerous times, abortion constitutes just 3 percent of Planned Parenthood\u2019s services, and except in cases of rape, incest, or severe threat to a mother\u2019s life, no federal money is used to fund abortion services. But cutting federal funding for PP would put access to breast exams, Pap tests, colposcopy procedures, HPV vaccines, reversible contraception procedures, pregnancy tests, STI tests, and HIV tests at risk. \u201d Live Action\u2019s   video demonstrates how the abortion chain calculates its deceptive \u201c3 percent statistic\u201d by dividing the number of abortions it performs by the total number of services it provides, counting a $10 pregnancy test or a package of condoms as equivalent to a $500 abortion.  \u201cTo justify its half billion dollars in taxpayer funding, Planned Parenthood downplays abortion  \u2014   falsely claiming that it only makes up three percent of its business  \u2014   and instead plays up its cancer screenings and   \u2018women\u2019s health care,\u2019\u201d explains Lila Rose, president of Live Action. Rose adds: According to its own annual reports, Planned Parenthood does less than one percent of all Pap tests in the United States, less than two percent of all clinical breast exams, zero mammograms, and virtually no prenatal care, yet it does 34. 9 percent of all U. S. abortions, killing over 320, 000 preborn children every year. Former Planned Parenthood managers have provided testimonials about how the abortion giant uses quotas to push   abortions, doesn\u2019t provide the health care it claims it does, and \u201ctreats women like cattle. \u201d In fact, when President Donald Trump offered Planned Parenthood the opportunity to keep its taxpayer funding if it would stop performing abortions, the group\u2019s officials rejected the offer. Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards even tweeted that its abortion services were \u201cas vital to our mission as birth control or cancer screenings. \u201d Planned Parenthood is proud to provide abortion \u2014  a necessary service that\u2019s as vital to our mission as birth control or cancer screenings. https:  .   \u2014   Cecile Richards (@CecileRichards) March 6, 2017,    activists are urging Congress and Trump to eliminate Planned Parenthood\u2019s taxpayer funding and redirect it to other community health care centers that provide more comprehensive healthcare services than Planned Parenthood. These community facilities outnumber the abortion business\u2019s clinics by at least 20 to 1.'"}, "time": 1742561801.6533465}
