Divisions deepened  over President Trump\u2019s order barring entry to refugees and citizens from seven   countries. Some of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters applauded the order, but other citizens organized on social networks, business leaders registered objections, and State Department diplomats circulated a   dissent cable. The White House press secretary said government workers should \u201cget with the program\u201d or go. Donations poured into the A. C. L. U. and other rights groups, lawsuits proliferated and acting Attorney General Sally Yates, a holdover from the Obama administration, was fired after she ordered the Justice Department not to defend the order in court. President Obama   saying through a spokesman that the order was discriminatory and that he was \u201cheartened by the level of engagement taking place in communities around the country. \u201d You can see more of our coverage here  \u2014   including Iran\u2019s missile launch, a test of Mr. Trump. Above, Syrian families at a U. N. office in Beirut, Lebanon. _____ 2. We took a look at why the order sparked such chaos. It received little or no legal review. The secretary of homeland security, above, was not asked for guidance, and Customs and Border Protection officers were unaware of it. And we collected the stories of people covered by the ban, which delayed families from reuniting and students returning to universities in the U. S. The U. N. estimates 20, 000 refugees wouldn\u2019t be able to be resettled during the   suspension. Here\u2019s a look at the rigorous vetting process refugees already face the debate over whether the ban is legal and our updated explainer about the executive order. _____ 3. President Trump appeared to try to shift the public\u2019s focus to another hot topic, by tweeting that he would announce his pick for the Supreme Court on Tuesday at 8 p. m. Our legal reporter says abortion rights and affirmative action appear secure for now, but unions and environmentalists have cause for concern. And this may not be Mr. Trump\u2019s only appointment during his term. _____ 4. Messages of solidarity poured into Canada from around the world after a shooting at a Quebec mosque that left six dead. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau assailed what he called \u201cthis terrorist attack on Muslims in a center of worship and refuge,\u201d and issued a statement saying: \u201cIt is   to see such senseless violence. Diversity is our strength, and religious tolerance is a value that we, as Canadians, hold dear. \u201d Local media reported that the    suspect had a history of provocative views and antisocial behavior. _____ 5. The   \u201cnerd prom\u201d that is normally the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner has some competition. The comedian Samantha Bee promises to \u201cproperly roast the president\u201d at \u201cNot the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner\u201d the same night, April 29. The lineup has not been finalized but she says there are \u201cbinders full\u201d of possibilities. _____ 6. The Ringling Bros. and Barnum  Bailey Circus is shutting down, after dwindling attendance and criticism from animal rights\u2019 groups. Some extreme fans are extremely upset. They include a Queens man who has created a scale model of the circus at Madison Square Garden, above. The president of the Circus Fans Association of America got existential, saying, \u201cTo me, the circus has always been the elixir of youth. When I visit the circus, I\u2019m 5 years old again and I have no life span. That immortality has been destroyed. \u201d _____ 7. The personal stenographer of the Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels died in Munich at 106. Brunhilde Pomsel was one of the last surviving members of the group that hid in a Berlin bunker with Hitler in his final days. \u201cWe tried to make sure we didn\u2019t run out of alcohol,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was urgently needed in order to retain the numbness. \u201d _____ 8. The ground cracks underfoot, and   pools of acidic water bubble between odd formations of rocks and minerals. Sulfur and chlorine create neon patches. In fact, the Danakil Depression in Ethiopia, an oppressively hot and dry volcanic region, might as well be Mars. That\u2019s precisely why scientists visited, hoping to learn about the possibility of life on other planets. _____ 9. When the Falcons and the Patriots  meet in the Super Bowl this Sunday, the average cost of a   ad will be in the vicinity of $5 million. One novelty: Snickers aims to do the game\u2019s first live commercial, starring Adam Driver (above in cardboard form) from the HBO series \u201cGirls. \u201d _____ 10. A new documentary, \u201cBecoming Warren Buffett,\u201d looks at the personal relationships of America\u2019s most famous investor, the    tycoon said to be worth $74 billion. \u201cPeople watching it expecting to learn how to buy cheap stocks will be disappointed,\u201d Mr. Buffett said with a chuckle during a telephone interview. (10 p. m. Eastern, HBO and streaming) _____ 11. Finally, a note about apologies. Most times when we say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d it\u2019s for something trivial. But when it matters, watch your wording. Psychologists and other experts say the best apologies are short and don\u2019t include rationalizations or requests for forgiveness. And \u201cI\u2019m sorry you feel that way\u201d really means \u201cI\u2019m not really sorry at all. \u201d Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.
