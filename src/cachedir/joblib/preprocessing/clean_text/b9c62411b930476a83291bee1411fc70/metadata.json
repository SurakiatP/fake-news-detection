Gorsuch had delivered the institution to this moment. It was the eve of two seminal votes for the Capitol\u2019s upper chamber: an expected Democratic filibuster of Judge Gorsuch on Thursday and a likely rule change pushed by Republicans  \u2014   the   nuclear option  \u2014   to bypass the filibuster and confirm President Trump\u2019s selection with a simple majority vote. On a few points, at least, bipartisan consensus seemed to have congealed: This is terrible for the Senate. This is terrible for the country. And this is happening. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, spoke of the \u201cfurther and perhaps irreparable damage it will do to the United States Senate. \u201d Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, suggested it was a trying time to be a lawmaker who prides herself \u201cas one who believes in the traditions of the Senate. \u201d Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, held forth wistfully on a bygone era in these halls. \u201cWe need to get back,\u201d he said, \u201cto the comity that we\u2019ve had. \u201d And these were the \u201cyes\u201d votes on the nuclear option. Yet as they have argued all week, from the moment Democrats secured the votes to block the nomination under current rules, Republicans insisted on Wednesday that they had no choice but to pursue this course. \u201cDemocrats would filibuster Ruth Bader Ginsburg if President Trump nominated her,\u201d the Republican majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said from the Senate floor. \u201cWe all know why. Democrats are bowing to   special interests that can\u2019t get over the results of the election. \u201d The minority party has framed its opposition differently. Democrats have cited concerns over Judge Gorsuch\u2019s record on workers\u2019 rights and his degree of independence from Mr. Trump, among other issues. They have also reminded the public of the treatment last year of Judge Merrick B. Garland, President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee for the seat left vacant with the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. Republicans, led by Mr. McConnell, refused to even consider Judge Garland during a presidential election year. \u201cThe truth is, each side can blame the other,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, making clear which side he blamed more. \u201cWe believe they\u2019re more in the wrong. They believe we\u2019re more in the wrong. The game of pointing fingers and    can go back and back and back to the very founding of the republic. \u201d But the remedy, Mr. Schumer argued, was not to bulldoze longstanding rules and traditions it was to find a compromise nominee who could earn 60 votes. \u201cIf the majority leader breaks the rules tomorrow  \u2014   and that\u2019s his choice,\u201d Mr. Schumer began, warning that Mr. McConnell would be \u201cerasing the last shred of bipartisanship in the Senate confirmation process. \u201d No senator logged more speaking hours on Wednesday (and Tuesday) than Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, who held the floor until midmorning after a more than   overnight    to protest the nomination. It was not technically a proper filibuster, as no Senate business was being delayed. But it was certainly a feat of congressional stamina and   content enhancement, with rousing flourishes, meandering detours and encouragement from his Democratic peers on social media. \u201cI\u2019m here on the floor at 4:20 in the morning,\u201d he said at one point, nearing 10 hours in, \u201cbecause so much is at stake. \u201d In his remarks, Mr. Merkley argued that Judge Gorsuch\u2019s rulings had disproportionately favored the privileged. He suggested that the Senate should not confirm a lifetime appointee of Mr. Trump\u2019s amid investigations into ties between the president\u2019s orbit and Russia. He quoted George Washington and lamented creeping commercialism and an erosion of civic participation. Republicans have pointed to assorted moments of Democratic escalation, including attempts to block judicial nominees under President George W. Bush and the party\u2019s choice in 2013, when Democrats controlled the Senate, to bar filibusters on lower judgeships and executive branch nominees. Senator Tim Scott, Republican of South Carolina, said the week\u2019s events owed to the \u201cphysics of politics,\u201d framing the rule change as an inevitable outgrowth of a rare partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court pick whom conservatives view as plainly qualified and uncontroversial. \u201cFor every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cAn unprecedented action is going to provoke an unprecedented reaction. \u201d Still, several lawmakers sought to present themselves as pained, fueling an unusual dynamic on Capitol Hill. At least a handful of Republicans predicted that their votes would damage the country and the future of the judiciary, but described the alternative  \u2014   letting Judge Gorsuch\u2019s nomination die  \u2014   as even less palatable. \u201cNow that we\u2019re entering into an era where a simple majority decides all judicial nominations, we will see more and more nominees from the extremes of both left and right,\u201d Mr. McCain said. \u201cI do not see how that will ensure a fair and impartial judiciary. \u201d Republicans have vowed that Judge Gorsuch will be confirmed on Friday.'"}, "time": 1742628427.2821407}
