There\u2019s no evidence to support the Republican nominee\u2019s claims of election fraud, but some cities are moving to expand voting rights to include noncitizens.   29, 2016 Some Democrat-Run Cities Want Their Illegal Alien Population to Vote \\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE: Yesterday, FBI director James Comey announced that they have reopened the investigation into Crooked Hillary\u2019s illegal email server. Yay! But even before that, Democrat operatives are working around the clock to skew the election results in any way they can. Today we present to you Democrat-run cities in America allowing illegal immigrants to vote in the upcoming election. Should illegal immigrant voting be legal? Wha\u2026??? \\n\u2018Look at illegal immigrants voting all over the country,\u2019 Donald Trump recently claimed in a Fox News interview, part of his ongoing effort to cast doubt on the integrity of the presidential election. There\u2019s no evidence to support the Republican nominee\u2019s claims of election fraud, but some cities are moving to expand voting rights to include non-citizens (illegal immigrants) . Trump Opposes Same-Day Voter Registration to Prevent Illegal Immigrants from Voting: \\nThe latest is San Francisco , where the Nov. 8 ballot will include a measure allowing the parents or legal guardians of any student in the city\u2019s public schools to vote in school board elections. The right would be extended to those with green cards, visas, or no documentation at all. \u201cOne out of three kids in the San Francisco unified school system has a parent who is an immigrant, who is disenfranchised and doesn\u2019t have a voice,\u201d says San Francisco Assemblyman David Chiu, the son of Taiwanese immigrants. \u201cWe\u2019ve had legal immigrants who\u2019ve had children go through the entire K-12 system without having a say.\u201d Undocumented immigrants should also have the right, Chiu adds, to bypass the \u201cbroken immigration system in this country.\u201d Should Illegal Immigrants Be Allowed to Vote in US Elections? \\nToday there are six jurisdictions in Maryland that let non-citizens (illegal immigrants) vote in local elections. Chicago allows them to take part in elected parent advisory councils but not to vote in school board elections. Four towns in Massachusetts have moved to allow noncitizen voting and are awaiting state approval. And in New York City, where non-citizens (illegal immigrants) make up 21 percent of the voting-age population, the city council is drafting legislation that would allow more than 1.3 million legal residents to take part in municipal elections. The city previously allowed non-citizens (illegal immigrants) to vote in school board elections, but that ended when New York\u2019s school boards were dissolved in 2002. Liberals Sign Petition to Allow Illegal Immigrants to Vote in 2016 Presidential Election: \\nSan Francisco has tried in the past to grant noncitizens access to school board elections. A 2004 measure narrowly failed, with 51 percent voting against it. \u201cThere was an opposition campaign at that time,\u201d Chiu says. He sponsored another ballot measure in 2010, which also failed. This time, Chiu says, he\u2019s hoping for a victory. So far he\u2019s seen no organized opposition: \u201cI think that\u2019s because of the ugly, anti-immigrant statements expressed by Donald Trump and his supporters.\u201d SHARE THIS ARTICLE  \""}, "time": 1742562181.703887}
