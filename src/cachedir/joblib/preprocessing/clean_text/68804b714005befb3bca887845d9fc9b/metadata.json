What the establishment didn\u2019t do was adjust the GOP\u2019s economic approach to match the populist impulses\u2014or even seem to consider such a shift necessary. \u2026\u201d\\nRich Lowry put it well here :\\n\u201cOur basic argument about Trump is simple and unassailable: He is a populist, not a conservative. Conservatism has always had a populist element, but it has been tethered to conservatism\u2019s animating causes of liberty, limited government and the Constitution. Trump inveighs against elites and tramples on political pieties, but these causes are afterthoughts to him, at best.\u201d\\nRoss Douthat put it better here:\\n\u201cSometimes this interdependency has worked out well. At its peaks of political success, the conservative intelligentsia has channeled and directed populism, responding to grass-roots passions without being ruled by them.\u201d\\nThe goal of the conservative intelligentsia has always been to CUCK the populist vote so that all of its anger and energy can be \u201ctethered\u201d or \u201cchanneled\u201d into advancing the conservative agenda (read: classical liberal agenda) of the \u201cgoverning wing\u201d of the Republican Party. The role of populist voters in the GOP is to show up on election day and vote for a handpicked establishment candidate like Mitt Romney or \u00a1Jeb!\\nIn this way, the conservatives can pass new free-trade deals for their corporate backers in the US Chamber of Commerce, start massive new destructive, unending wars in the Middle East, and keep the border wide open so that an endless influx of Third World cheap labor can further enrich the plutocracy. They figured all those yokels would just keep voting for them indefinitely because Democrats want to abort babies and seize guns.\\nGive them lip service! Give them token gestures! Give them round after round of failure theater! You know, it kind of worked too until their whole signaling structure broke down. That\u2019s what happens when an elite loses its legitimacy. To borrow an analogy, the falcon doesn\u2019t respond to the Falconer anymore and the elite falls.\\nIt is only a matter of time.\""}, "time": 1742628585.7370803}
