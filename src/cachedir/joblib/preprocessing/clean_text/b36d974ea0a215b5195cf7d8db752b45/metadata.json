The members were a group of older students at Tulsa Community College who served as mentors to younger black men with troubled pasts. Delores Taylor told Mr. Crutcher he was the perfect candidate: He had turned 40 in August, and he was turning his life around after struggling with drugs by taking classes at the community college and pursuing a music career. He was nearly six feet tall and weighed 244 pounds  \u2014   some called him \u201cBig Crutch\u201d  \u2014   but often carried his size to quiet comedic effect. \u201cYou looked at his size, and I just said, \u2018Whoo! \u2019\u201d said Ms. Taylor, a former president of the college\u2019s black student association. \u201cBut he was just a big teddy bear. Terence knew where he wanted to go. He knew his goals, and I wanted to use him as an example. \u201d Ms. Taylor asked Mr. Crutcher to join the student association\u2019s Dream Team, and on Sept. 12, he agreed. Four days later, Mr. Crutcher was shot and killed by a Tulsa police officer, a shooting captured on video that stoked outrage throughout Tulsa and around the country. Mr. Crutcher was outside his S. U. V. in the middle of a street when he was shot by a white officer. He was unarmed and had his hands in the air for much of the confrontation. The officer, Betty Jo Shelby, 42, was charged by prosecutors with   manslaughter, and she was accused of overreacting to his refusal to follow her commands. On Saturday evening at his funeral, Mr. Crutcher\u2019s relatives and friends, joined by city and Oklahoma officials and black community leaders, filled a Baptist church four miles from where he was shot. Music defined Mr. Crutcher\u2019s life, and it defined his farewell  \u2014   a rollicking, nearly   funeral that his pastor called a \u201c  celebration\u201d that was led by a gospel band and a   choir, dozens strong. The program was interrupted for more singing, more dancing. It was through song that mourners heard Mr. Crutcher\u2019s voice, as a gospel ballad that his late brother wrote and that he recorded and sang echoed through Antioch Baptist Church. And it was yet another song that filled the church at the end as Mr. Crutcher\u2019s blue coffin was slowly pushed down the aisle, sung by one of the men who pulled the coffin forward. \u201cTerence is free,\u201d the man sang. \u201cRest on, Big Crutch. \u201d Throughout the funeral, one phrase kept coming up, as a way to heal their anger and to take the sting out of an insult. As the confrontation with the police unfolded, an unidentified officer in a police helicopter overhead can be heard in a video of the shooting saying, \u201cThat looks like a bad dude, too. \u201d Speaker after speaker disputed the description. \u201cTerence was not a bad dude. Terence was a great dude,\u201d one of the family\u2019s lawyers, Damario   told the crowd, adding, \u201cWhen they encountered Terence they didn\u2019t know. They didn\u2019t know who he was. They didn\u2019t know he had a family that loved him. They didn\u2019t know he had a community that loved him. \u201d Mr. Crutcher was a choir singer, a father, a quoter of Proverbs. He was a native of Tulsa, born three minutes before his twin sister, Tiffany Crutcher. He was the father of four children, ages 4 to 16, and a    stepson. A GoFundMe page created to support Mr. Crutcher\u2019s children raised more than $160, 000 in three days. Mr. Crutcher\u2019s father and mother  \u2014   the Rev. Joey Crutcher and his wife, Leanna  \u2014   first learned of their son\u2019s death while inside the church. They were leading a rehearsal for a concert to celebrate Antioch\u2019s 57th anniversary. His father was playing the organ, and his mother was directing a choir when two of Mr. Crutcher\u2019s sisters walked in and put their arms around the couple and broke the news. \u201cI speak for the entirety of our city,\u201d said Mayor Dewey F. Bartlett Jr. who is white and who has been praised by black leaders for helping to calm racial tensions. \u201cTo the Crutcher family, I am so very sorry. The sympathies of this community is with you. \u201d Mr. Crutcher had a record of   with law enforcement dating to the 1990s, including charges for public intoxication and resisting arrest, according to court and prison records. In 2007, he was sentenced to state prison after being convicted of trafficking in illegal drugs. He served nearly four years and was released on parole in 2011. Officials said the police discovered PCP in the front seat of his vehicle after he was shot. The drug, which is highly addictive and sometimes called angel dust, can cause hallucinations and paranoia. He told a woman who had called 911 to report the abandoned vehicle that he thought his S. U. V. was going to blow up. Some of those who knew him said Mr. Crutcher acknowledged his problems and turned to God for help. \u201cI did a lot of talking with Terence,\u201d said Barbara Shannon, pastor of New Heights Christian Center, which Mr. Crutcher attended for more than 25 years, adding, \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Yeah, you\u2019re struggling. I know your struggles, baby. We all got struggles.\u2019 \u201d She said, \u201cI\u2019m not commending Terence for his bad mistakes. I\u2019m not commending me, either. But what I\u2019m commending him for is that he owned up to it. He never stopped. He kept trying. He kept going. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562244.3529565}
