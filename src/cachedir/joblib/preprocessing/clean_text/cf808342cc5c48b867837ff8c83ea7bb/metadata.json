Live Satellite News posted the video and noted that Clinton appeared to be \u201cmumbling to herself.\u201d \\nClinton almost missed a stair, and as The American Mirror pointed out, from the time she left her motorcade all the way up the plane stairs, Clinton seemed \u201cwobbly and unsteady.\u201d \\nWatch the video below yourself where Clinton appeared to be pained as she climbed the campaign plane stairs: \\nThe American Mirror posted another video, this time from The Last Stand, in which Clinton couldn\u2019t tackle an approximately 18-inch step without assistance. The title of the video referenced Clinton\u2019s \u201cStronger Together\u201d campaign slogan \u2014 one that she apparently has taken literally thanks to her clearly failing health. \\nAs you can see in the second video, the man who assisted Clinton didn\u2019t just happen to be there and thought it would be nice to extend a hand to the elderly woman. No, he bounded over to Clinton when she neared the step. He stood nearby in what looked like an effort to be ready to help her descend the single step or steady her on the platform. \\nNow, some who haven\u2019t followed the campaign closely may think that this is nit-picky, but it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s a little odd on its own, but when you add it to the mountain of evidence over the years of Clinton\u2019s failing health, it says a great deal. \\nCan you imagine the media uproar if Donald Trump exhibited a tenth of the issues Clinton has on the campaign trail? You don\u2019t have to \u2014 just this week Trump took 90 minutes \u201coff\u201d of the campaign trail to open his new Washington hotel, Washington Trump International, and CNN\u2019s Dana Bash managed to ask a question that served as a dig. \\n\u201cFor people who say you\u2019re taking time out of swing states to go do this,\u201d Bash asked. Trump, with his hectic schedule that more than puts Clinton to shame, wasn\u2019t having it: \u201cFor you to ask me that question is actually very insulting, because Hillary Clinton does one stop and then goes home and sleeps. Yet you\u2019ll ask me that question.\u201d \\nHe\u2019s right. There have been numerous examples of Clinton\u2019s failing health that have barely gained media attention aside from her collapse at a Sept. 11 memorial this year that forced the biased media to reluctantly cover it. \\nThe media is in the bag for Clinton, there\u2019s no doubt about it . They may not note her clear health issues that she refuses to disclose the public, but we will.'"}, "time": 1742563902.2680054}
