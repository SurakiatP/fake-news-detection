Actually not bad. \\nDonald Trump Ran on Protecting Social Security But Transition Team Includes Privatizers / Intercept (martha r). Looks like the answer as to whether Trump was getting rolled by the Republican establishment is coming pretty quickly. Remember that Trump doesn\u2019t owe Wall Street anything; this appears to be the result of turning to Republican \u201cexperts\u201d. \\nTrump Recruiting Among the Lobbyists He Once Denounced New York Times. \\nDonald Trump: JPMorgan\u2019s Jamie Dimon Being Considered for Treasury Fortune (resilc). Wonder if Trump is running this trial balloon to make Elizabeth Warren see red and make Trump\u2019s good buddy Carl Ichan look good by comparison. \\nTrump\u2019s Transition Team Works to Form Cabinet Wall Street Journal. Story flogs Hensarling as a possible Treasury Secretary candidate (gah!) along with other scary ideas. But I tend to discount this because Hensarling is a buddy of Pence, and so far, Trump\u2019s interactions with Pence have featured lots of friction. And Hensarling is plenty useful to Trump right where he is now. Let\u2019s hope this reading proves to be correct. \\nU.S. consumer financial agency could be defanged under Trump Reuters \\nTrump Ascends to the Cherry Blossom Throne \u2013 Tyler Sic Semper Tyrannis (Kfathi). A contrary view to the links above, and today\u2019s must read. Bear in mind that he exaggerates the role of Soros in US politics (Eastern Europe is a completely different kettle of fish). Too many other squillionaires throwing $ at candidates and think tanks. See his comment about John Bolton in particular (mind you I don\u2019t see how anyone can think Bolton is a good idea), and his warning: \u201cInstead, my friends on the Left, worry that he will not only do what he said he would, but he\u2019ll go above and beyond, and the people will love him for it.\u201d But this cheery reading discounts the difficulty Trump will have in securing the ability to govern. Saboteurs on what is nominally your side are a tougher obstacle than external opponents. \\nBlankfein Says Trump Infrastructure Commitment Good for Growth Bloomberg (resilc) \\nBefore Taking the White House, Trump Due in Court over Fraud Vanity Fair. A President\u2019s power of pardon is absolute save for impeachment, so Trump could pardon himself. But would he dare? And I\u2019m not an expert on immigration law, but it\u2019s hard to see how Trump is on shaky legal ground in deporting undocumented aliens. Other countries do it all the time. Try overstaying your visa and watch what happens if you get caught out. \\nTrump Shows Every Sign of Carrying Out Sweeping Immigration Crackdown Bloomberg. If Trump moves too fast on deportations, as opposed to policy changes (as in relying on loud noises, including warnings to employers, to induce many undocumented workers to leave of their own accord), Trump could precipitate sustained and serious protests. But the Feds may lack the staffing to increase deportations all that much near term. \\nRecord Numbers of Undocumented Immigrants Being Detained in U.S. Bloomberg. Resilc: \u201cLast I checked a demo has been in control since 2008.\u201d \\nTrump bucks protocol on press access Associated Press.

As Keynes said: \\nA sound banker, alas, is not one who foresees danger and avoids it, but one who, when he is ruined, is ruined in a conventional way along with his fellows, so that no one can really blame him.'"}, "time": 1742628609.006139}
