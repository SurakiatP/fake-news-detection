[Thank you for standing with Planned Parenthood, Mr. President. #ObamaFarewell pic. twitter.   \u2014   Planned Parenthood (@PPIAction) January 11, 2017,   In 2013, Barack Obama was the first sitting president to deliver an address to the nation\u2019s largest abortion chain. At its annual gala, Obama praised the group\u2019s century of service to women and condemned those who \u201ctry to turn Planned Parenthood into a punching bag. \u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve also got a president who is going to be right there with you, fighting every step of the way,\u201d the president said. \u201cThank you. God bless you. \u201d . @POTUS: Thank you for your eight years of support for Planned Parenthood and reproductive freedom! #ObamaFarewell #IStandWithPP \u2764\ud83d\udc4f  \u2014   Planned Parenthood (@PPact) January 11, 2017,  Planned Parenthood\u2019s president, Cecile Richards, has enjoyed significant access to the White House during the Obama presidency. CNSNews. com reported that, as of July of 2015, Richards had already made 39 visits to the White House since 2009, when she first was a guest on Obama\u2019s inauguration day. We didn\u2019t do it all, but we accomplished so much. Thank you, @POTUS  @FLOTUS. It\u2019s been the honor of a lifetime. #ObamaFarewell pic. twitter.   \u2014   Cecile Richards (@CecileRichards) January 11, 2017,  Thank you @FLOTUS.

The abortion business received more than $1 million in the form of grants even as the group was embroiled in a scandal alleging its practice of harvesting the body parts of babies aborted in its clinics and selling them for a profit. As the \u201cbaby parts\u201d scandal erupted, the Obama administration came to Planned Parenthood\u2019s defense by threatening states that passed laws that eliminated the group\u2019s taxpayer funding and redirected it to other federally qualified health care centers that do not perform abortions. In October of 2016, Obama celebrated Planned Parenthood\u2019s centennial anniversary with a wish, \u201cHere\u2019s to another #100YearsStrong\u201d: For a century, Planned Parenthood has made it possible for women to determine their own lives. Here\u2019s to another #100YearsStrong.  \u2014   President Obama (@POTUS) October 16, 2016,  The \u201cnonprofit\u201d abortion chain\u2019s IRS form 990 for 2014 shows that Richards\u2019 salary and compensation jumped to $957, 952, double the salary she made just three years prior, in 2011, when her reported income was $420, 153. Despite a significant increase in Richards\u2019 pay, Planned Parenthood\u2019s annual reports show a consistent decline in legitimate health care services, such as pap smears and sexually transmitted disease treatment. Its 2014 tax return also shows that Planned Parenthood\u2019s 12 highest paid employees all earn   salaries amounting to almost half a billion dollars. Planned Parenthood receives over a half billion dollars annually in taxpayer funding  \u2014   as well as some $186 million in private and corporate donations  \u2014   and performs over 300, 000 abortions per year.
