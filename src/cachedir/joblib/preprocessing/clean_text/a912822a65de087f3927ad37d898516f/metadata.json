[The bill is sponsored by state Missouri Representative Mike Moon (  Grove) and \u201cwould cover employees as well as customers. \u201d In effect, it puts the onus on the business owner, so that when he decides   customers and employees must be disarmed on premises, he also accepts full responsibility for their safety.  The Joplin Globe reported the bill this way: Moon\u2019s bill would hold private businesses that prohibit guns liable for the safety of anyone who is legally permitted to carry a concealed weapon but is prevented from doing so by the business and who suffers injury or other \u201ccompensable\u201d damage in an attack in which the permit holder could theoretically have defended himself if he had been allowed to keep his weapon on him. The bill is directed toward \u201cprivate, commercial businesses. \u201d Moon believes the legislation is necessary because an unarmed concealed carry permit holder has no \u201cpromise of success\u201d should he or she be inside a   business when an attack occurs. Moon explained: Kind of where this thing started was with business owners who were adamantly opposed to those who carry firearms. What would happen if a third party came on and committed a crime and there was bodily injuries sustained to the patrons? Who is liable? And as I\u2019m talking to legal minds  \u2014   attorneys particularly  \u2014   apparently there\u2019s still a lot of gray area there on who\u2019s actually responsible. I believe that the third party is responsible but apparently there are some unanswered questions and so hopefully this bill will reveal some of those.
