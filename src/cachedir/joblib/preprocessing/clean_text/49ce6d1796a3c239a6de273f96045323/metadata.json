Now, here\u2019s former New York Times entertainment industry reporter Michael Cieply with some interesting observations on The Narrative at the NYT . From Deadline : \\nby Michael Cieply November 10, 2016 12:59pm \\nIt\u2019s been a moment for soul-searching, and to some extent repentance, at the New York Times. In much-discussed remarks to his own media columnist James Rutenberg, executive editor Dean Baquet offered a mea culpa for having missed the Donald Trump surprise, though he spoke less for the paper than for journalists in general. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do a much better job of being on the road, out in the country, talking to different kinds of people than we talk to \u2014 especially if you happen to be a New York-based news organization \u2014 and remind ourselves that New York is not the real world,\u201d Baquet said. \\n\u2026 \u201cAs The Times begins a period of self-reflection, I hope its editors will think hard about the half of America the paper too seldom covers,\u201d wrote Spayd. \\nShe continued: \u201cThe red state America campaign coverage that rang the loudest in news coverage grew out of Trump rallies, and it often amplified the voices of the most hateful. One especially compelling video produced with footage collected over months on the campaign trail, captured the ugly vitriol like few others. That\u2019s important coverage. \\nOr it\u2019s intentionally misleading. \\nBut it and pieces like it drowned out the kind of agenda-free, deep narratives that could have taken Times readers deeper into the lives and values of the people who just elected the next president.\u201d \\nHaving left the Times on July 25, after almost 12 years as an editor and correspondent, I missed the main heat of the presidential campaign; so I can\u2019t add a word to those self-assessments of the recent political coverage. But these recent mornings-after leave me with some hard-earned thoughts about the Times\u2019 drift from its moorings in the nation at-large. \\nFor starters, it\u2019s important to accept that the New York Times has always \u2014 or at least for many decades \u2014 been a far more editor-driven, and self-conscious, publication than many of those with which it competes. Historically, the Los Angeles Times, where I worked twice, for instance, was a reporter-driven, bottom-up newspaper. Most editors wanted to know, every day, before the first morning meeting: \u201cWhat are you hearing? What have you got?\u201d \\nIt was a shock on arriving at the New York Times in 2004, as the paper\u2019s movie editor, to realize that its editorial dynamic was essentially the reverse. By and large, talented reporters scrambled to match stories with what internally was often called \u201cthe narrative.\u201d We were occasionally asked to map a narrative for our various beats a year in advance, square the plan with editors, then generate stories that fit the pre-designated line. \\nReality usually had a way of intervening. But I knew one senior reporter who would play solitaire on his computer in the mornings, waiting for his editors to come through with marching orders. Once, in the Los Angeles bureau, I listened to a visiting National staff reporter tell a contact, more or less: \u201cMy editor needs someone to say such-and-such, could you say that?\u201d \\nThe bigger shock came on being told, at least twice, by Times editors who were describing the paper\u2019s daily Page One meeting: \u201cWe set the agenda for the country in that room.\u201d \\nYou can see this in agenda-driven stuff like World War T and the Military / Campus Rape Culture hysterics. These are not news, they are planned campaigns of psychological warfare. \""}, "time": 1742561940.2594142}
