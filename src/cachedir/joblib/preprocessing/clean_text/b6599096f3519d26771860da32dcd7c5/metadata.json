Kirk Goes Low \u2026 Again \\nSen. Kirk is battling to retain his Senate seat, and his chances of doing so get slimmer by the day. In last night\u2019s debate, he made a racist comment to Rep. Duckworth that may put the final nail in the coffin of his re-election bid. \\nBoth candidates in the race are military veterans, and Rep. Duckworth was speaking about her own service as well as that of her family. She said : \u201cMy family has served this nation in uniform going back to the Revolution. I am a daughter of the American Revolution. I\u2019ve bled for this nation. But I still want to be there in the Senate when the drums of war sound \u2014 because people are quick to sound the drums of war \u2014 and I want to be there to say, \u2018This is what it costs. This is what you\u2019re asking us to do. And if that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll go.\u2019 Families like mine are the ones that lead first. But let\u2019s make sure the American people understand what we are engaging in. And let\u2019s hold our allies accountable because we can\u2019t do it all.\u201d \\nSen. Kirk was given the customary 30 seconds to respond. However, rather than respond with dignity and grace, he chose to take the low road, saying: \u201cI had forgotten that your parents came all the way from Thailand to serve George Washington.\u201d \\nRep. Duckworth was born in Bangkok to a mother of Thai-Chinese descent and an American father. \\nAnd yes, her family\u2019s military service on her father\u2019s side can indeed be traced back to the American Revolution. \\nKirk\u2019s comment, made to a woman who lost both her legs and nearly lost her right arm in Iraq, was racist and indefensible. I find myself wondering what he possibly thought he could gain by making it. His campaign has come forward to say that Kirk \u201chonors her family\u2019s service.\u201d If that\u2019s true, he has a strange way of showing it. \\nThe junior senator has come under fire in the past for lying about his own military service. \\nAs for Rep. Duckworth, she simply smiled and let the moderator move on. My guess is she was thinking of how nice \u201cSenator Tammy Duckworth\u201d sounds, because Kirk may as well just bow out gracefully now. \\nWatch the exchange here, and remember to vote on November 8: \\nFeatured Images by Lance Cheung and Daniel X.
