Trump is heard boasting about foisting himself on women. \u201cThis is the first time I ever publicly talked about this,\u201d Ms.   said on Thursday, speaking to reporters at City Hall and appearing at times to hold back tears. \u201cTwenty percent of young girls unfortunately experience some form of sex abuse and molestation. \u201d \u201cAnd,\u201d she added, pausing as her words caught in her throat, \u201cI fall in that category. \u201cBetween the ages of 5 and 8, I was molested by two different individuals at two different points in time, and it\u2019s a reality that you live with every day. \u201d Ms.   47, a Democrat, said she decided to speak out about her experience after watching the video of Mr. Trump that emerged last Friday, in which he is heard bragging of being able to kiss and grope women and get away with it because he was famous. Mr. Trump, now the Republican nominee for president, was speaking on the tape, recorded in 2005, with Billy Bush, a host of the NBC program \u201cAccess Hollywood,\u201d who was heard laughing and egging him on. \u201cWhen you have an individual who is boasting about violating, and taking from, a woman something without her consent, I just couldn\u2019t anymore,\u201d Ms.   said, adding that her public role gave her a responsibility to speak out. \u201cAnd to have someone laughing and goading it and enabling it is just, it was very painful for me and it triggered things that I hadn\u2019t felt in a long time. \u201d Ms.   first revealed her personal trauma on Wednesday evening on Twitter, writing that one in five girls are \u201cvictims of child sex abuse. \u201d She added, \u201cI\u2019m that   5. Trump\u2019s misogyny  sexual violence has reopened wounds I\u2019ve tried to heal. \u201d She followed it with \u201c#Basta,\u201d which is Spanish for \u201cenough. \u201d Many people, including other elected officials, responded on Twitter by calling her courageous and offered their support. A few minutes later, Ms.   posted on Twitter again: \u201c#NoMoreSilence I am empowered. And Strong. #FearMe. \u201d While she did not provide further details at the news conference of the abuse, she spoke in anguished terms of her ordeal and the difficulty of discussing it publicly. \u201cIt\u2019s a struggle that you go through and it never ends,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not something you forget or you move on in life. It\u2019s part of your life. \u201d She added: \u201cI didn\u2019t start dealing with my abuse until I was in my 20s. I mean that\u2019s what trauma does to you. In some ways you create, there\u2019s spots that are a little sketchy, right, and you try to block it out and it was, it takes time. Some people never are able to process it. \u201d Laura Palumbo, a spokeswoman for the National Sexual Violence Resource Center, an independent organization partly funded by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said research had found that one in four girls experienced sexual assault before age 18 over all, one in five women experience sexual assault at some point in their lifetime. Ms.   called on Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters to repudiate him and said that by continuing to support him, \u201cin essence you are condoning that type of behavior where you think it\u2019s O. K. to violate a woman. \u201d At one point, a reporter for Telemundo, the Spanish language network, asked Ms.   who is Puerto Rican, to discuss her experience in Spanish. Appearing close to tears, she replied in Spanish, \u201cI prefer not to. I\u2019m a little emotional right now. \u201d She later gave a Spanish language interview following the news conference.'"}, "time": 1742564120.902716}
