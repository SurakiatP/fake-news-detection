Sarah Palin, the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee and the first major GOP figure to endorse President Donald Trump, is calling out House Speaker Paul Ryan for what she says is \u201c . \u201d[Ryan introduced what he calls the \u201cAmerican Health Care Act,\u201d a bill that does not repeal Obamacare but only amends it. For the last several days, senior Republicans ranging from members of the House Freedom Caucus to other House Republicans to Sens. Tom Cotton ( ) Rand Paul ( ) Mike Lee ( ) and more have raised serious concerns with the bill. Some call it Obamacare 2. 0, others call it Obamacare Lite or   and now Palin \u2014  in her first interview on the topic, coming on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel this weekend \u2014  calls it \u201c . \u201d  \u201cI do want to speak about this, but I am tempted to say not another word from our fearless leaders about this new form of Obamacare that I\u2019m going to call   \u2014  not another word from them until we are definitively told that there is no provision whatsoever allowing Congress to exempt itself whatsoever with this law,\u201d Palin said. \u201cAs with anything else mandated by Congress, every single dotted I and crossed T better apply to them, too, and not just the people who they are lording this thing over because remember this is   health care, the system that requires enrollment in an unaffordable, unsustainable, unwanted, unconstitutional continuation of   medicine, and even in this new   proposal, there is still an aspect of socialism. That\u2019s the whole premise here. \u201d Palin expressed serious concern with the fact that Ryan\u2019s healthcare bill does not eliminate Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate. It just shifts the mandate \u2014  which requires all Americans to purchase a health insurance plan even if they do not want one. Under Obamacare, those who do not comply, pay a tax to the federal government. Under Ryan\u2019s plan, those who not comply, pay a fee to the insurance companies. \u201cThis 30 percent additional fee will be collected by some in the private sector, which will mean politicians are allowed again to pick the winners and losers, and it makes you wonder who\u2019s lobbying hardest for aspects of this new bill because obviously there are special interests involved. Otherwise, certain private sector segments of our economy wouldn\u2019t be rewarded as they will be with this fee, instead of going to the IRS going to private companies,\u201d Palin said. \u201cIt would be really helpful if every single one of these politicians would do like the NASCAR drivers do \u2014  and it\u2019s been said before \u2014  but let them wear their sponsors plastered all over their   suits when they show up so we know what side they\u2019re on and who they\u2019re actually doing their bidding for. \u201d At this time, House GOP leadership officials are refusing to answer which lobbyists specifically were involved in writing the bill and which lobbyists wrote which parts of the legislation. Palin told Breitbart News that it\u2019s a \u201cgreat question\u201d for leadership officials that they should answer because the public deserves to know. \u201cThat\u2019s a great question. That\u2019s a great question,\u201d Palin said when informed of the fact that House GOP leaders have refused to answer which lobbyists were involved in writing the legislation. \u201cThe people want to know with this   we know that it helps Big pharma and big lobbyists who need big government to stay in business. We want to and have the right to know who\u2019s actually putting pen to paper and writing this because we know the politicians don\u2019t write the laws. \u201d Palin also praised Cotton and Paul and Rep. Dave Brat ( ) among others, who are standing up and pushing back on this rush from leadership on this bill. She says that they are \u201cright\u201d in pushing to make sure the process is not rushed in the way that Ryan has been rushing it through the House so far. In fact, this past week, the House Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means Committees stayed in session all night to ram the bill down to the next stages, rather than taking input from the American people and slowly deliberating the process of healthcare reform. \u201cCotton is right. Dr. Rand Paul is right. Dave Brat is right. Some of these public servants are right in saying, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right this time\u2019 because, remember, the rush job under Obamacare gave us what we\u2019re having to deal with today, which is the devastating system that is again lorded over us,\u201d Palin said. \u201cThey passed it with their   process of theirs. It\u2019s very important that the people are allowed to see what\u2019s in the bill before its first draft so we know what their thinking is, so we know what the difference is between Obamacare and  . \u201d \u201cBut we can\u2019t lose sight of the entire premise between the whole   and the    arguments,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt\u2019s so wrong because it\u2019s still so unconstitutional. It\u2019s still taxation without representation. It still picks winners and losers because some corporations get to opt out of the requirements that hit everyone else. It still infringes on states\u2019 rights, and it still weaponizes the IRS against Americans who just simply seek freedom and choices and sensibility in their families\u2019 health care. The IRS will be taxing aspects of this without representation because we have no choice. We\u2019re shackled to politicians\u2019 whims and special interests\u2019 bullying interests, which does violate the Constitution, and it actually allows government to have a lien on our health. \u201d \u201cPeople need to know it\u2019s the foundation, it\u2019s the premise,\u201d Palin said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why we\u2019re still even giving an inch on aspects of socialized medicine via this new   proposal. Is that okay with conservatives, with Republicans in office? They say they want the patient first. They say they want freedom. They say they want a free market to drive the insurance system that we have in America. But no, government is still in control. Government actually has a lien on our health because they lord over us penalties if we want to opt out of a big government mandate. \u201d When asked what she would say to Ryan if he were on Breitbart News Saturday with her this weekend \u2014  Ryan has refused to come on the program to discuss these matters and will not answer Breitbart News\u2019s questions about the bill  \u2014  Palin said she has lots for Ryan to explain here. But she also noted that Republicans   agree that Obamacare is awful and needs to be repealed. \u201cThere is much that we agree on,\u201d Palin said. \u201cThank the Lord, we all agree that Obamacare is devastating   of our economy. That\u2019s what health care encompasses. Once the government took it over \u2014  it obviously is unaffordable, unsustainable and unwanted. So, from the   thank the Lord we all have that in common, and we want to do away with Obamacare. I would ask Paul Ryan\u2019s forgiveness if I come across sounding like I\u2019m just whining and complaining about a problem without proposing a solution. Like Teddy Roosevelt said, that is the definition of whining. So I want to propose solutions, and I want Paul Ryan to listen to the people who are suggesting that, okay, if government is going to be this involved in our healthcare system and choices, then allow the states to take this over. Get it out of big government\u2019s hands. The most responsive level of government is that which is closest to the people. If you\u2019re not going to allow individuals to have the freedoms and the autonomy and the choices provided in their health care, at least let it be a states\u2019 rights issue. So that\u2019s one. \u201d \u201cAnd then let\u2019s talk about the tort reform that I still don\u2019t see in the new proposal,\u201d Palin continued. \u201cI\u2019d like Paul Ryan to address that more clearly. I\u2019d like him to really talk about how he proposes to tackle the waste and the fraud in the healthcare system. I\u2019d really like him to talk about the interstate commerce allowance now because we know that that has caused a lack of competition, and I really want him to address just that good old American freedom of choice. How can he convince the American people that this isn\u2019t just still big government in bed with big pharma and big Wall Street and sticking it to the people with all its globaloney that was part of Obamacare. How is this   any different?\u201d Palin concluded the interview by noting that she has the utmost confidence that President Trump will move to scrap Ryan\u2019s bill and fix this whole process before this gets out of hand. \u201cHe will step in and fix it,\u201d Palin said. \u201cI have great faith that President Trump is one who will fulfill campaign promises. He already has a track record of doing so well in these first months, I\u2019m just really proud to have been part of the constituency that wanted him in there and worked hard to get him in there. So, yeah, I\u2019m sure that President Trump is going to do the right thing and listen to all sides, of course, but understand, especially, that as a businessman, he\u2019s going to understand whether this makes sense in his vision of how to grow businesses and how to get government off our back and back on our side. How will we create a smaller, smarter government with a proposal like this that basically allows for the continuation of a growth of government? That\u2019s what any aspect of Obamacare or   does. So asking President Trump specifically about how running a business, not a Wall Street business, but    main street business, how does   help their business get to grow and drive and survive in this economy?\u201d LISTEN TO FORMER ALASKA GOV.
