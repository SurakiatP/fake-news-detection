Other key states that both nominees have invested in included Pennsylvania, Ohio and North Carolina.   \\nTrump has pondered why he hasn\u2019t gotten more credit for hanging tough while the polls show him consistently behind Clinton. That\u2019s a good question, but the answer could be tied up in the fact that liberals have worked tirelessly to skew polls in favor of Clinton. \\nTrump also appeared to have a healthy amount of self-confidence \u2014 so much so that he invests his own money in him campaign \u2014 something we haven\u2019t seen from Clinton. Ever. \\nMost voters have become painfully aware of how Democrats lie and cheat about almost everything , and having Clinton in the White House would mean that absolutely no one could trust our commander in chief. \\nThat\u2019s a sobering thought that should make the choice of who to vote for crystal clear.
