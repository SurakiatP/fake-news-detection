(Photo by AFP) \\nThousands of Britons have signed a petition to express their outrage over Queen Elizabeth\u2019s use of \u00a3369 million in taxpayers' money to repair the Buckingham Palace. \\nMore than 94,000 people had signed the petition as of Sunday, two days after the government of Prime Minister Theresa May allowed the royal family to repair the palace with public funds. \\nThe UK Parliament should discuss the petition when it hits the 100,000 mark. \\nOn Friday, the Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond granted the 90-year-old Queen a 66-percent rise in funding required for the palace\u2019s refurbishment over the next 10 years. \\nThe money would be used to replace cables, pipes and boilers installed 60 years ago to prevent a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d event that might destroy the palace, according to Master of the Queen\u2019s Household Tony Johnstone-Burt. \\nPetitioners argued that the royals should foot the massive bill themselves given the vast extent of their wealth. \\n\u201cThe Crown and its estates should be made to fund its own renovations,\u201d wrote Mark Johnson, who posted the petition. \\nProtesters said the money could be used to mend the faltering National Health Service (NHS) or help families get more affordable homes amid a housing crisis.

Now the annual grant would be inflated by two-thirds, rising to \u00a376 million in 2017. \\nThe grant is financed by the profit coming from the royal family\u2019s 350,000 acres of land across the UK.
