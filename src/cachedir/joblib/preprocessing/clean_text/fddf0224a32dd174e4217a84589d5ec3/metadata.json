He still keeps a copy of it  \u2014   one that\u2019s creased and copiously underlined  \u2014   in a library with the rest of his favorites at his father\u2019s house in Richmond, Va. The book, \u201cThe Fourth Turning,\u201d a 1997 work by two amateur historians, Neil Howe and William Strauss, lays out a theory that American history unfurls in predictable,   cycles of prosperity and catastrophe. And it foresees catastrophe right around the corner. The book delineates history into four seasonal cycles, or \u201cturnings\u201d: growth, maturation, decay and destruction. It is the kind of wild, provocative idea that Mr. Bannon loves. But it is also just the kind of thinking that his opponents see as evidence that he is too Machiavellian and idiosyncratic for the job of President Trump\u2019s chief strategist. The basis of his worldview  \u2014   which has been described as everything from Leninist to   an extremist fringe movement associated with white nationalism  \u2014   is still shrouded in mystery and conjecture. But by his own telling, much of the foundation for his political beliefs can be found in the book, which predicts that America is hurtling toward a crisis on par with the American Revolution, the Civil War and the Great Depression. And the grim future that the book foresees helps explain the underpinnings of the president\u2019s conservative, nationalist \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda, one that Mr. Bannon has played a large role in shaping. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt that the world is in the beginning state of a crisis that it can\u2019t avoid,\u201d Mr. Bannon said in a recent interview, before Mr. Trump removed him from the National Security Council and started contemplating a broader White House   that could further marginalize him. But Mr. Bannon, choosing his words carefully, allowed that while he did not believe a cataclysm like global war was inevitable, failing to prepare as if one might happen would be foolish. \u201cEverything President Trump is doing  \u2014   all of it  \u2014   is to get ahead of or stop any potential crisis,\u201d Mr. Bannon added. But those who question Mr. Trump and Mr. Bannon\u2019s motives say the central premise of \u201cThe Fourth Turning,\u201d with its religious subtext and dark premonitions, is a convenient excuse to sow fear and justify extreme action. Many academic historians dismiss the book as about as scientific as astrology or a Nostradamus text. And many will find reason for alarm in its conclusion that the coming crisis will demand loyalty and conformity from citizens. It also leads to unavoidable questions about war and whether Mr. Bannon, who has recommended the book to countless friends and made a film about it in 2010, is resigned to catastrophic global conflict. He says he is not. And he remains unconvinced that the United States can effectively intervene in overseas conflicts like the one unfolding in Syria. As one of the voices in the administration who expressed skepticism about a military strike in response to the Assad regime\u2019s chemical attack on its own citizens, Mr. Bannon insists he is no warmonger. In the interview, Mr. Bannon rattled off a list of White House policies that he said fit with the larger goal of strengthening the country for whatever calamity might await just over the horizon. They included starting the process of building a wall on the southern border, barring foreigners from seven predominantly Muslim nations, and taking steps that he said were meant \u201cto empower the secretary of defense, the C. I. A. to step up the war\u201d against radical Islam. \u201cI think it\u2019s very simple: You\u2019ve got to take care of the country,\u201d Mr. Bannon said. Ultimately, he added, America could reclaim its position as a keeper of peace and stability throughout the world. \u201cAmerica has to be strong  \u2014   economically strong and militarily strong. And a strong America could be ultimately a provider of Pax Americana. \u201d But to those who see Mr. Trump as someone who instigates crises, rather than defuses them, the knowledge that his senior strategist is an evangelist for a theory that forecasts the destruction of society as we know it is alarming. \u201cIf you frame everything as a crisis, then the right response to crisis is action, not deliberation,\u201d said Alexander Livingston, an assistant professor of political theory at Cornell who has written critically about \u201cThe Fourth Turning\u201d and Mr. Bannon. \u201cIt puts the people who say \u2018hold on\u2019 in a position of failing to see the crisis but also of being responsible for the crisis. \u201d In their book, Mr. Howe and Mr. Strauss note the roughly   intervals between catalytic events in American history like the Declaration of Independence (1776) the attack on Fort Sumter (1861) and the bombing of Pearl Harbor (1941). They predicted the next crisis would begin around 2005 and reach its climax sometime before 2025. \u201cHistory is seasonal, and winter is coming,\u201d they warn. Precipitating each fourth turning, the authors wrote, is a breakdown of the existing civic order and the institutions that prop it up. Mr. Bannon, who has said the Trump administration will see to the \u201cdeconstruction of the administrative state,\u201d believes these institutions are already crumbling, and he seems more than happy to pilot the wrecking ball that demolishes them entirely. In an interview, Mr. Howe recalls getting an email about 10 years ago from Mr. Bannon, whom he had never heard of at the time, asking if he would participate in a film about the book. \u201cWe kind of blew him off,\u201d Mr. Howe, who is now a demographer at the investment firm Hedgeye Risk Management, said recently. Mr. Howe, who eventually agreed to be interviewed for the film, said that Mr. Bannon seemed to have no qualms about the destruction part of the cycle. \u201cThere is something beneficial about the creative destruction that comes with a fourth turning,\u201d Mr. Howe said. \u201cThere has to be a period in which we tear down everything that is no longer functional. \u201d Mr. Bannon\u2019s suspicion of powerful institutions and the men and women who run them might seem at odds with his personal conservatism. He is a Catholic, a former Navy officer and a traditionalist in many ways. But Peter Schweizer, an author and frequent collaborator with Mr. Bannon on films and books, said Mr. Bannon believes the nation\u2019s elites arrogantly underestimate their own role in creating crises and then overestimate their ability to solve them. \u201cI do think the reason this theory is so powerful in Steve\u2019s mind is it kind of goes to the heart of his problem with elites,\u201d Mr. Schweizer said. \u201cHe does have a skeptical view of the limitations of human intellect. This notion that a few smart guys know how to quote unquote run a global economy is just laughable to him. \u201d In the 2010 film, \u201cGeneration Zero,\u201d which was produced by Citizens United, whose films often attack favorite conservative targets like the Clintons, the screen flashes with foreboding imagery: a mushroom cloud from an atomic bomb, a shark fin skimming above the water, a guillotine blade falling. The film\u2019s thesis is that the financial collapse of 2009 was the beginning of the modern fourth turning. But Mr. Bannon sees not just a financial crisis unfolding. A deeper cultural crisis  \u2014   selfishness, excessive political correctness and a lack of civic responsibility  \u2014   has infected the country\u2019s political and economic institutions, which must be purged. Today Mr. Bannon is much more prudent about tossing out predictions of imminent catastrophe and conflict. But some who spoke with him for the film said he was not always so reticent. \u201cIf we were in an international crisis that might lead to a major war, I don\u2019t think that would frighten him at all,\u201d said David Kaiser, a former professor at the Naval War College and a historian who subscribes to the Strauss and Howe theories. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go so far as to say Bannon wants it,\u201d Mr. Kaiser added. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s a possibility he willingly accepts it. \u201d Mr. Bannon insisted that was not his view. \u201cYou\u2019re not inexorably pulled into this,\u201d he said. But it seemed undeniable to him that the book got a lot right about the general direction that America is headed. \u201cIn the \u2018Fourth Turning\u2019 theory you\u2019ve got a country that believes it\u2019s off course,\u201d he said. \u201c  of Americans now think we\u2019re on the wrong track. That\u2019s an extraordinary number. \u201d He added, \u201cCertainly they feel the country is in some sort of crisis. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563614.5301814}
