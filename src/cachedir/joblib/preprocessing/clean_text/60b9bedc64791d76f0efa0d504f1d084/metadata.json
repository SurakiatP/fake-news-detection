[Sydney Allan Markland, 68, was arrested Friday and charged with sexual battery on a victim under 12 years old after police conducted an investigation that lasted several months, WESH reported.  Police said the girl lived in the same neighborhood as Markland and was walking to a friend\u2019s house in July 2016 when he asked her to help carry some fried chicken into his home. The girl told police that she helped Markland because he appeared to be injured. While she was inside the house, Markland allegedly raped the girl and told her not to tell anyone. The Tampa Bay Times reports that the girl told one of her parents, who then called police. Investigators say that Markland\u2019s DNA matched DNA samples taken from the victim\u2019s clothing. Detectives state that Markland told them that his actions are permissible in his culture and that the victim\u2019s \u201cprovocative clothing\u201d and \u201cactions\u201d suggested that she consented to \u201csexual contact,\u201d WKMG reported. \u201cShe was wearing provocative clothing,\u201d Markland said, according to the detectives\u2019 report. \u201cHer actions suggested that she was consenting to sexual contact. \u201d Detectives say Markland admitted to \u201csexually battering\u201d the child after they ate chicken wings and prayed together. Markland is being held without bail at the Marion County Jail. Investigators say Markland may have sexually assaulted others because he knows a lot of the children in the neighborhood, and neighbors reportedly say they saw children stop by Markland\u2019s home regularly. \u201cKids will go in there, and he will give them candy and stuff,\u201d said neighbor Steve Sarju. \u201cNot to go inside, he will stay on his porch and say \u2018Have a candy. \u2019\u201d'"}, "time": 1742628489.0170317}
