Trump taunted North Korea over its ballistic missile capabilities, North Korea has said that it could conduct its first test of an intercontinental missile \u201canytime and anywhere\u201d in a rebuke to the incoming president. Although North Korea has vowed to develop the ability to attack the United States with nuclear warheads and has tested missiles that can reach throughout the Korean Peninsula and its vicinity, it has never tested a   missile that could fly over the Pacific. In a New Year\u2019s Day speech, Kim   North Korea\u2019s leader, said his country had reached a \u201cfinal stage\u201d in preparing to test an intercontinental ballistic missile. That drew a Twitter post the next day from Mr. Trump that said, \u201cIt won\u2019t happen!\u201d On Sunday, an unidentified spokesman of the North Korean Foreign Ministry told the North\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency, \u201cThe ICBM will be launched anytime and anywhere determined by our supreme leadership. \u201d The spokesman\u2019s remarks, made public on the KCNA website Monday, were in response to comments last Thursday by Antony J. Blinken, the United States deputy secretary of state, that North Korea had made \u201ca qualitative improvement\u201d in its missile capabilities over the past year. And he said Washington and its allies would continue \u201ccomprehensive, sustained pressure and sanctions\u201d against the North. On NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday, Ashton B. Carter, the departing secretary of defense, said the United States would shoot down a North Korean missile \u201cif it were coming towards our territory or the territory of our friends and allies. \u201d It remains unclear how close North Korea has come to building a reliable ICBM. Although it has displayed the     believed to be its first ICBM, during military parades in recent years, it has never   that system. In the past year, however, North Korea has boasted of successfully testing key technologies, such as   missile engines and heat shields for an ICBM. Last Tuesday, John Kirby, a spokesman for the State Department, said Washington did not believe that North Korea had achieved its goal of tipping   missiles with nuclear warheads, though it continued to \u201cmarch in that direction. \u201d North Korea has sought to develop by early 2018 miniaturized nuclear weapons that can fit atop a missile capable of reaching the United States, Thae   a former North Korean diplomat who defected, told the Yonhap news agency of South Korea on Sunday.'"}, "time": 1742562086.1790957}
