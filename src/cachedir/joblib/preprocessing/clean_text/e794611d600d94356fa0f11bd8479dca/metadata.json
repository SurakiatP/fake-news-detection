Jeff Sessions stated Tuesday he will recuse himself from investigations concerning failed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton if confirmed as Attorney General. [Asked by Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley how he planned to address concerns about his possible handling of an investigation involving Clinton, Sessions said: \u201cMr. Chairman, it was a highly contentious campaign. I, like a lot of people, made comments about the issues in that campaign with regard to Secretary Clinton. And some of the comments I made, I do believe that could place my objectivity in question. \u201d  \u201cI\u2019ve given that thought. I believe the proper thing to do would be to recuse myself from any questions involving those kind of investigations that involved Secretary Clinton and that were raised during the campaign, or could be otherwise connected to it,\u201d he said. \u201cTo be very clear, you intend to recuse yourself from both the Clinton email investigation and any matters involving the Clinton Foundation if there are any?\u201d Grassley asked. \u201cYes,\u201d Sessions said firmly. \u201cLet me follow up again, because it\u2019s important. When you say you\u2019ll recuse, you mean you\u2019ll actually recuse, and the decision will therefore fall to I assume a deputy attorney general?\u201d Grassley asked. \u201cI ask because after Attorney General Lynch met with President Clinton in Phoenix, she said she would \u2018defer\u2019 to the FBI, but she never officially recused. \u201d \u201cNo, she did not officially recuse and there\u2019s a procedure for that I would follow. And I believe that would be the best approach for the country, because we can never have a political dispute turn into a criminal dispute, in any way that would suggest anything other than absolute objectivity,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cThis country does not punish its political enemies, but this country ensures no one is above the law. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562047.2259095}
