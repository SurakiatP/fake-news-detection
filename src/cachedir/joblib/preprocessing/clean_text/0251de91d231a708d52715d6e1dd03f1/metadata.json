Here are some examples. BEFORE Prime Minister David Cameron, who led the \u201cRemain\u201d campaign, said that if the country voted to leave, he would begin the formal process of leaving the union immediately by sending what is called an Article 50 notification to Brussels. He also said he would try to remain as prime minister. AFTER The morning after the referendum, Mr. Cameron said he would resign once a successor could be chosen and would leave it to his successor to issue the notification. BEFORE The \u201cLeave\u201d campaign promised that Britain would be  able to save 350 million pounds a week, or about $462 million as of Monday, that could be spent on the National Health Service, schools and housing. A slogan on the Leave campaign bus went further, promising explicitly to use that money to \u201cfund our N. H. S. instead. \u201d (The savings figure was widely disputed by economists, Remain campaigners and the Office for National Statistics.) AFTER Leave leaders, including Nigel Farage of the U. K. Independence Party, and Boris Johnson and Iain Duncan Smith of the Conservative Party, maintained that they had never promised that \u00a3350 million a week would be given to the N. H. S. Mr. Duncan Smith called the figure \u201can extrapolation. \u201d Mr. Farage said that the \u00a3350 million claim was \u201cone of the mistakes that, I think, the Leave campaign has made\u201d and that anyone who voted to leave because of the promise \u201cmade a mistake doing that. \u201d BEFORE George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, warned that a vote to leave would touch off an economic crisis that would require the government to adopt an emergency budget with spending cuts and tax increases. AFTER In an effort to calm the financial markets, which plunged after the referendum, Mr. Osborne said on Monday that Britain had the resources to weather the immediate crisis and that an emergency budget could wait until Mr. Cameron\u2019s successor had taken office and assembled a new cabinet. BEFORE Leave campaigners promised to swiftly reduce the number of immigrants coming to Britain from other parts of Europe, which Mr. Johnson said could not happen while Britain remained in the union. Michael Gove, the justice secretary and an ally of Mr. Johnson\u2019s, said a vote to leave would \u201cbring down the numbers\u201d by 2020. AFTER \u201cFrankly, if people watching think that they have voted and there is now going to be zero immigration from the E. U. they are going to be disappointed,\u201d said Daniel Hannan, a prominent Leave advocate and member of the European Parliament. To keep vital access to the European single market after leaving the union, Mr. Hannan acknowledged to the BBC, Britain would have to accept free movement of workers, as Norway and other nonmember states have.'"}, "time": 1742563293.5170598}
