In return she and Bill received vast amounts of payoffs from the Kremlin and related interests \u2014 most notably a $500,000 speaker fee for Bill from a Moscow-based investment bank, which works out at about $250,000 net of tax.\\n(Money also went to the Clinton Foundation charity, from which the Clintons personally steal money through a channel so clever and cynical that it remains hidden). \\nThe deal is a perfect example of \u201cClinton Corruption,\u201d says Donald Trump. \u201cAs secretary of state, Hillary Clinton signed off on a deal allowing Russians to take\u2026 control of about 20% of America\u2019s uranium supply to the Russians.\u201d\\nIt shows the \u201clong and lucrative history of financial deals with the Russians, particularly with the Russian government,\u201d says Peter Schweizer, author of the book \u201cClinton Cash,\u201d director of the film of the same name, and an editor at large for the always-reliable Breitbart website. Uranium is \u201ca fundamental issue of national security,\u201d Schweizer told Lou Dobbs Tonight on Fox Business. \u201cIt\u2019s not like oil and gas that you can find all sorts of places. They are precious few places you can mine for uranium, in the United States is one of those areas.\u201d\\nEven the New York Times \u2014 a wholly owned subsidiary of the Worldwide Clinton-Illuminati-Spectre Cabal \u2014 was critical. \u201cCash Flowed to Clinton Foundation Amid Russian Uranium Deal,\u201d it reported in a big expose published earlier this year, in which it even floated the prospect of a Putin \u201cmonopoly\u201d of uranium down the road.\\nIt\u2019s all very, very troubling. Apart from just one teensy weeny little problem.\\nUranium isn\u2019t a scarce resource that Vladimir Putin, or anyone else, is about to control.\\nUranium is a massive drug on the international commodity markets. There is a worldwide glut. It is produced all around the world, and there is so much of it washing around that the price is in free-fall \u2014 and has been for almost 10 years. Right now the world\u2019s uranium miners are so desperate that they are actually giving it away for less \u2014 literally \u2014 than it costs them to dig it out of the ground.\\nUranium prices have collapsed by a staggering 88% since their peak in the summer of 2007. They are down about three quarters since the February 2011 Fukushima nuclear reactor disaster in Japan, which caused that country to switch off most of its reactors and caused everyone else to review their nuclear-energy production.\\nAs it happens, the price of this allegedly precious commodity just hit a new low of $20 a ton (In 2007 it was $160). It\u2019s now half the price it was when the Russians took control of Uranium One. According to the World Nuclear Association, the miners\u2019 trade body, that\u2019s about 20% below the average cost of digging it out of the ground. Two thirds of the world\u2019s uranium costs more than $20 a pound to mine.\\nThe problem is that while lots of mines are producing it, hardly anyone wants it. Nearly all of the commercial use for uranium is for nuclear energy. Nuclear reactors are being mothballed. Plans for massive nuclear expansion are being shelved or reconsidered. Fukushima caused a massive political backlash against nuclear energy.\\nEven countries that still plan on building many more reactors \u2014 such as China and India \u2014 started slow-walking their plans and rethinking. And then the price of other sources of energy, such as oil and gas, collapsed. So there is even less demand for new reactors.\\nMeanwhile, despite the panic, U.S. uranium output isn\u2019t very important anyway. According to the World Nuclear Association, the U.S. ranks ninth among global producers. Our production is less than one quarter of Australia\u2019s and less than one tenth of Canada\u2019s. The U.S. accounts for about 2% of total uranium production worldwide \u2014 meaning that the U.S. mines now in Putin\u2019s hands account for about 0.4% of world output.\\nWhoa! You can really see why Vladimir Putin wanted \u201ccontrol\u201d of it \u2014 and why the Clintons were able to charge him in return a stratospheric $250,000 net (plus, of course, the secret funds stolen from the Clinton Foundation) in return.\\nWhy hasn\u2019t there been an investigation? Where is the FBI when you really need it?\\nOK, maybe \u201ctechnically,\u201d Hillary didn\u2019t personally actually \u201capprove\u201d the deal. Turns out she had no actual veto power over it. But she was one of many people who could have referred it to the president, who could have blocked it. There are lots of others who also approved it, including multiple regulators and stock exchanges around the world (Uranium One is actually a Canadian company). The fact that they all waved it through just shows how wide the Clintons\u2019 tentacles really stretch.\\nBut I always like to end on a positive note, and I have one now. If uranium really is a scarce and precious resource and Vladimir Putin is secretly trying to corner the market, as so many of these sources allege, then obviously sooner or later the price is going to explode. And if that\u2019s true, I know an easy way you can guarantee yourself a fortune.\\nJust go out and buy stock in Uranium Participation Corp. URPTF, -0.36% a publicly traded Canadian company that functions effectively as a uranium trust. It simply owns a lot of uranium on behalf of investors. Its price has, of course, absolutely collapsed along with the underlying price of the uranium in its vaults, and the stock is now at record lows.\\nAlthough it is a Canadian stock, and its primary exchange is in Toronto, the stock also trades freely over the counter in the U.S.\\nI assume that all those people raging against Hillary\u2019s evil uranium \u201csell out\u201d to Putin, and warning about the coming uranium apocalypse, have plunged tons of their own money into the stock. Right?\\nAnd if they haven\u2019t \u2014 what does that tell you?\\nVia.
