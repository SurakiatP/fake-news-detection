S. Attorney General, Sen. Jeff Sessions ( ) should not be confirmed for the post. [From Variety:  Last Wednesday the U. S. Senate held four confirmation hearings on Donald Trump\u2019s cabinet nominees. It also scheduled his   press conference  \u2014   largely devoted to Trump\u2019s   \u2026     intimate relationship with Russia  \u2014   and a critical vote on the Affordable Care Act budget. Sometimes we, as progressives, aren\u2019t able to be   because we acknowledge complexity  \u2014   we address the intersections and breadth of policies and positions. Sometimes, perhaps we try to do too much. So let me be perfectly clear: Sen. Jeff Sessions should never be attorney general of the United States. While the Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings on Sessions\u2019 nomination, around Capitol Hill other committees moved forward on a host of other outrageous nominees. The American public may never hear about the number of serious conflicts each of these nominees pose  \u2014   to our democracy, to our rights  \u2014   because there is simply too much to process.   \u2026     Read Leguizamo\u2019s full column at Variety.'"}, "time": 1742628588.3761208}
