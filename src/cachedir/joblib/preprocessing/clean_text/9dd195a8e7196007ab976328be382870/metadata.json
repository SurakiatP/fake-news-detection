Trump\u2019s rally in Virginia on Tuesday, for various reasons. The silent protesters were escorted out by staff members midway through his speech, and they went silently, with peace signs over their heads. The   group left in a similar fashion. But the crying baby was initially welcome in the event, or so the crowd was led to believe. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that baby. I love babies,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI hear that baby crying, I like it. What a baby, what a beautiful baby. Don\u2019t worry, don\u2019t worry. \u201d But the platitudes did nothing to comfort the infant, whose persistent wails seemed to be getting on the candidate\u2019s nerves. \u201cActually, I was only kidding. You can get that baby out of here,\u201d Mr. Trump said a few beats later with a slight smirk as laughs and a few gasps escaped from the crowd. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I think she really believed me that I love having a baby crying while I\u2019m speaking. That\u2019s O. K. People don\u2019t understand. That\u2019s O. K. \u201d Later in the rally, another baby cried, daring a rebuke from the candidate. But eventually the child calmed down. Senator Tim Kaine, the Democratic   nominee, was swift to pick up on Mr. Trump\u2019s baby episode, taking a jab at him as he brought up the issue of prekindergarten at a rally in Daytona Beach, Fla. on Tuesday. \u201cI saw that Donald Trump kicked a crying baby out of an event earlier today,\u201d Mr. Kaine said, \u201cso as I\u2019m thinking about   sometimes you wonder who the baby is. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563281.3751144}
