Trump tried out several lines of attack against Hillary Clinton, at one point calling her \u201cunfit to be president,\u201d as he delivered an otherwise noticeably restrained speech to an audience of evangelical activists here Friday. Appearing before the Faith and Freedom Coalition\u2019s Road to Majority conference, Mr. Trump promised to \u201cuphold the sanctity and dignity of life\u201d and to \u201crestore respect for people of faith. \u201d But he also used the opportunity to press his case against Mrs. Clinton, portraying her as arrogant, attacking her economic policies and willingness to admit Syrian refugees into the country and questioning her judgment as secretary of state. \u201cShe\u2019ll appoint radical judges who will legislate from the bench, overriding Congress, and I\u2019ll tell you, the will of the people will mean nothing  \u2014   nothing,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cShe will undermine the wages of working people with uncontrolled immigration, creating poverty and income insecurity. Hillary Clinton\u2019s Wall Street agenda will crush working families. She\u2019ll put bureaucrats, not parents, in charge of our lives, and our children\u2019s education. \u201d Referring to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s call for Mr. Obama to take in 65, 000 Syrian refugees, Mr. Trump also challenged her to instead \u201creplace her support for increased refugee admissions\u201d with \u201ca new jobs program for our inner cities. \u201d \u201cWe have to temporarily stop this whole thing with what\u2019s going on with refugees where we don\u2019t know where they come from,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe have to take a timeout. We have to use the money to take care of our poorest Americans and work with them so they can come out of this horrible situation that they\u2019re in. \u201d Mrs. Clinton has been calling Mr. Trump temperamentally unsuited for the White House, and he tried to turn the tables. Mrs. Clinton \u201crefuses to even say the words radical Islam  \u2014   refuses to say it,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThis alone makes her unfit to be president. \u201d He has vowed to deliver a major speech Monday attacking both Mrs. Clinton and her husband as personally corrupt, and on Friday Mr. Trump asserted that the email scandal that has overshadowed Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign for months had its origins in such venality. \u201cHillary Clinton has jeopardized  \u2014   totally jeopardized  \u2014   national security by putting her emails on a private server, all to hide her corrupt dealings,\u201d he said. The claim appeared to refer to concerns that the private server Mrs. Clinton used as secretary of state may have been more vulnerable to being hacked by foreign adversaries than the State Department\u2019s email system. (Although the emails were supposed to contain only unclassified information, the department has retroactively withheld some of their contents as classified when reviewing them for release in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit.) But Mr. Trump offered no backup for his claim that the private server was used to hide \u201ccorrupt dealings. \u201d Noting that President Obama had officially endorsed Mrs. Clinton on Thursday, Mr. Trump added, \u201cFirst time ever, by the way, a president of the United States endorsed somebody under criminal investigation. \u201d But that assertion also goes beyond the known facts. The FBI is investigating Mrs. Clinton\u2019s use of a private server, but agents have not yet interviewed her and it is not clear if she herself is a target of a criminal inquiry. A few young protesters interrupted Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks, shouting \u201cDump Trump\u201d and other slogans. After they were muscled out by security guards, Mr. Trump called them \u201cprofessional agitators\u201d who were \u201csent in by the other party  \u2014   believe me. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s speech Friday came as he is battling to regain his footing after weeks of missteps, none more damaging than his questioning whether a federal judge could preside fairly over a case against Trump University because the judge is of Mexican heritage. With party leaders expressing outrage and voicing doubts that he can unify Republicans and defeat Mrs. Clinton in November, Mr. Trump noticeably curbed his impulsiveness Tuesday night, promising in a prepared speech not to let his supporters down. Still, in a Bloomberg Politics podcast published Friday morning, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell raised the possibility of rescinding his endorsement if Mr. Trump did not \u201cchange directions. \u201d Alluding to what he called Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cobvious shortcomings,\u201d Mr. McConnell said, \u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious he doesn\u2019t know a lot about the issues. \u201d Before the Faith and Freedom Coalition Friday afternoon, Mr. Trump again stuck mainly to a script, reading from teleprompter screens. But he still   in his characteristically clipped syntax. \u201cWe want to uphold the sanctity and dignity of life, marriage and family as the building block of happiness and success,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd by the way, I know many, many very successful people. The happiest people are the people that have had great religious feel and that  \u2014   incredible marriage, children. It\u2019s more important than the money, folks. Believe me. \u201d Mr. Trump  \u2014   who has been married three times  \u2014   does not hew to traditional conservative orthodoxy. He previously supported abortion rights, and he said earlier this year that Planned Parenthood has done \u201csome very good work\u201d for millions of women. And in response to North Carolina\u2019s controversial new bathroom law, Mr. Trump said that transgender people should be able to use whatever bathroom where they feel most comfortable. But he nonetheless won the early endorsement of leaders like Jerry Falwell Jr. president of Liberty University, and successfully wooed evangelical voters during the primary, exit polls showed. Hogan Gidley, a former aide to Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, said that while evangelicals \u201cwould love to have a true evangelical in the White House,\u201d they understood that Republicans required a broader coalition to win in November. \u201cRepublicans cannot win without getting evangelicals, and they can\u2019t win only getting evangelicals,\u201d Mr. Gidley said. \u201cThey have to expand the voter universe and so far, Trump has done an amazing job with that. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564579.3830013}
