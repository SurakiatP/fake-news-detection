In one email dated February 29, 2016, an article sent by Hillary advisor Sara Solow to Podesta and Hillary\u2019s foreign policy advisor Jake Sullivan indicates that the Clinton campaign is considering House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s relative for the Supreme Court . \\nKetanji Brown is the subject of the article. She is related to Paul Ryan by marriage and is a judge on the US District Court for the District of Columbia. \\nThe email reads, \u201cShe was confirmed by without any Republican opposition in the Senate not once, but *twice*. She was confirmed to her current position in 2013 by unanimous consent \u2013 that is, without any stated opposition. She was also previously confirmed unanimously to a seat on the U.S. Sentencing Commission (where she became vice chair).\u201d \\n\u201cHer family is impressive. She is married to a surgeon and has two young daughters. Her father is a retired lawyer and her mother a retired school principal. Her brother was a police officer (in the unit that was the basis for the television show * The Wire *) and is now a law student, and she is related by marriage to Congressman (and Speaker of the House) Paul Ryan.\u201d \\nEarlier this month, he even said he would not campaign for nor support his party\u2019s nominee, Donald Trump . In fact, some supporters of Trump have theorized that Ryan was somehow behind or involved in the leak of the tape in which Trump made sexually crude comments about women. \\nIf you claim this is merely circumstantial, then I think there is no hope for you understanding just how corrupt DC has gotten, and this is the very Paul Ryan I warned you about in 2012, which everyone said was \u201cso conservative.\u201d Sadly, many didn\u2019t listen and voted for liberal Mitt Romney and him. Perhaps Paul Ryan\u2019s records and emails should be leaked and maybe we just might see that he\u2019s willing to engage Hillary in a pay-to-play scheme . \\nCourtesy of Freedom Outpost \\nTim Brown is an author and Editor at FreedomOutpost.com , SonsOfLibertyMedia.com , GunsInTheNews.com and TheWashingtonStandard.com .
