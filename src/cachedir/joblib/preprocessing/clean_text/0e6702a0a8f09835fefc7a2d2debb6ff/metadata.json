However, in an email sent by Neera Tanden, the think tank\u2019s president, she defends the decision to welcome Netanyahu with open arms.\\nThe email was published in the latest batch of \u201cPodesta Emails\u201d from WikiLeaks. It offers a glimpse at how Tanden, an adviser to Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign and moderator of CAP\u2019s Netanyahu event, dealt with the controversy.\\nJohn Podesta, Clinton campaign chairman, sent her an email the day after the event. \u201cAs a bloodied Jack Nicholson said in Hoffa, \u2018What has been gained and what has been lost?\u2019 How did the Bibi event score on that scale?\u201d\\nIn Tanden\u2019s reply, she clearly outlined the pros and cons of hosting Netanyahu.\\n\u201cThings gained: We will never be called anti-Semitic again. No matter what anyone writes,\u201d Tanden asserted. \u201cMainstream press and people think we handled it just right \u2013 tough questions. I think for any dismissers, not that I think there were a lot, but we have definitely proven we\u2019re a think tank. And it may have sealed the deal with a new board member.\u201d\\nTanden continued, \u201cThings lost: Staff is riven. On both sides. We are holding a lot of meetings on that. Worse thing \u2013 someone leaked staff statement. That kind of thing really changes the culture.\u201d\\n\u201cHow to keep that culture with that kind of leaking is going to be hard, but need to navigate. And far left hates me. We do have a broader issue of expectations in the organization. I had an intern tell me that she was upset we did not tell her ahead of time.\u201d\\nWhat was lost and gained is expressed purely in institutional terms. Tanden writes nothing about what CAP may have done to give Netanyahu cover for the crimes the Israeli government commits against Palestinians through its occupation. She has no words for what this may mean for the people of Gaza, who endure poverty and face humanitarian disaster as a result of an economic blockade.\\nOverall, Tanden concludes, \u201cNothing we have done has pitted being a think tank and being ideologically action oriented against each other more harshly. At the end of the day, we had to choose.\u201d\\n\u201cSo answer is complicated. If I could have the whole thing not happen, would definitely have it not happen. But it happened to us.\u201d\\nInviting a world leader is not something that just happens , like a branch breaking a car\u2019s windshield when it falls out of a tree. Tanden and other leaders of CAP actively sought to host Netanyahu, and they were proud of the prestige it could garner for them.\\nWhen she introduced Netanyahu, Tanden said, \u201cThank you for taking questions because the choices you make matter profoundly to Israel\u2019s future and the future of the region. And we believe that matters profoundly to America.\u201d Notably, she said nothing about the future of Palestinians.\\nJournalist Rania Khalek pointed out that Tanden let Netanyahu lie repeatedly during the event about the construction of new settlements, settler violence, land theft, and ethnic cleansing.\\nTanden and other Clinton appointees served on the Democratic Platform Committee, and during the process, they blocked language that would have acknowledged there is, in fact, an Israeli occupation. They also refused to remove language suggesting the boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) movement \u201cdelegitimizes\u201d Israel.\\nA coalition of Clinton Democrats and other liberal Democrats blocked a resolution to support the rebuilding of Gaza during the full Democratic platform committee meeting in July.\\nClinton has distinguished herself as a pro-Israel Democrat and will aggressively challenge the BDS movement as president. With the support of Democratic mega-donor Haim Saban, who has pledged to invest billions to fight BDS, Clinton celebrated college students on the \u201cfront lines of the battle to oppose the alarming boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement known as BDS\u201d during her speech at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) conference.\\nAdditionally, emails previously published by WikiLeaks already have shown that the letter Clinton wrote to Saban, where she pledged to fight BDS, was written to help the campaign attract more pro-Israel donors.\\nReturning to the CAP event for Netanyahu, in the week before the event, The Intercept published a story on leaked emails showing the lengths to which CAP was willing to go to \u201cplacate AIPAC.\u201d The think tank censored \u201cits own writers on the topic of Israel.\u201d\\nTanden may seem exasperated in the email. \u201cI need to clear my head on this and then would love to get your advice on a few things in the coming days,\u201d she shared in the email. However, it is not as if there was any kind of an about-face or open display of regret in the aftermath. Tanden and CAP served the interests of AIPAC, also known as the Israel lobby, and if called upon to hold a similar event as a service to a Clinton White House, they will be loyal soldiers and help whitewash the policies of Israel again.\\nThe post Email Reveals What Progressive Think Tank Gained By Hosting Netanyahu appeared first on Shadowproof .'"}, "time": 1742564301.528182}
