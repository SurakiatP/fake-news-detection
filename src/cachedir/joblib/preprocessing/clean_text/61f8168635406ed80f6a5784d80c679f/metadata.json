Revving motorcycle engines and honking horns drowned out the cheers of the swelling crowds that lined a   route that started in Midtown Manhattan and reached down to the West Village. But soon, the jubilant procession gave way to what looked like an apparition: a shuffling contingent of figures dressed in all white, veiled in gauzy fabric and wearing placards with names and faces. They represented the 49 people gunned down this month at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla. The New York City gay pride march on Sunday reflected the event\u2019s evolution over more than four decades from a defiant protest by a marginalized community into a freewheeling day that included a presidential candidate and other political leaders, floats from major corporations and a diverse crowd that extended beyond members of the city\u2019s lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. (The New York Police Department\u2019s marching band was there, too, and played \u201cY. M. C. A.,\u201d by the Village People.) But the numerous tributes to the shooting victims in Orlando, including a float at the front of the march carrying the owner of the club, served as a reminder of the parade\u2019s history as a moment each year for the gay community to celebrate its identity in the face of violence and adversity. \u201cIt\u2019s a much more emotional day for me than just a parade,\u201d said Michael Leb, 76, who teared up as he reflected on a time, not that long ago, when there was less acceptance of gay people and some companies would not hire them, much less march with them. \u201cIt\u2019s just that everybody is with us,\u201d Mr. Leb said. \u201cI remember when we were treated as less than   citizens. It\u2019s a young world, and those who are young will bring even greater change. \u201d Officials believed the crowds surpassed the 1. 6 million who attended last year, and 30, 000 of them were marchers, making up 484 contingents. The Police Department also had stepped up its presence, with thousands of officers stationed at barricades and directing traffic, watching from the rooftops above and in plainclothes on the ground. \u201cWhenever we talk about New York values, we\u2019re talking about respect and inclusion of all people,\u201d Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, told reporters before the parade. \u201cThis will not just be a celebration of love but a rejection of hatred. This is New York saying, \u2018We believe in tolerance for everyone. \u2019\u201d The theme this year was \u201cEquality Needs You. \u201d The world now is different from the one in which the first march took place, in 1970, called Christopher Street Liberation Day and held a year after the rebellion prompted by police harassment at the Stonewall Inn. (In a signal of that evolution, President Obama declared the bar, in Greenwich Village, and the area surrounding it a national monument and, with it, created a unit of the National Park Service dedicated to the gay rights movement.) But advocates said that the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community in the United States still faced discrimination and violence and that gay people in other countries faced far dire circumstances. \u201cI am one of the few lucky ones who made it here to safety,\u201d said Subhi Nahas, one of the march\u2019s three grand marshals and a refugee from Syria who has testified at the United Nations about the Islamic State\u2019s persecution of gay people. The march also included a group that called itself Gays Against Guns, whose members lay on the pavement at various points along the route for a    . The group urged stricter gun control laws and condemned the National Rifle Association, which, according to one poster, the group said should \u201csashay away,\u201d borrowing a catchphrase from \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race. \u201d Poot Rojamasiri opted for an outfit more muted than what some others were wearing: a tan polo and green shorts, with a small rainbow sticker on his arm. He said he had considered dressing in drag, but decided against it. \u201cI have fear to express myself,\u201d said Mr. Rojamasiri, who is from Bangkok. \u201cMy mom back home told me, \u2018Just do not go crazy. \u201d But others said the event was a rare place where they felt enveloped in acceptance. \u201cToday, I feel just really proud of who I am,\u201d said Logan, a    transgender man who has been transitioning for the past two years. (He declined to give his surname because his family was not supportive of his transitioning.) Katie Graubart, 17, and Helaina Ross, 16, stood on the corner of Fifth Avenue and East Ninth Street waving rainbow flags. \u201dLove overpowers all,\u201d Helaina said. \u201cJust look at the streets  \u2014   they\u2019re lined with people who all support love and being who you are. \u201d John Burris, 74, has attended about 30 Pride marches over the years. He came out at 18 and moved to New York around the time of the Stonewall uprising. \u201cThis acceptance may be too late for me,\u201d Mr. Burris said. \u201cBut I\u2019m so grateful that it\u2019s available to all these young people. \u201d He became emotional as he recalled the turbulence that had to be endured before reaching the point where the community is now. He said he had lost 75 friends to AIDS. \u201cAfter they died, we had to decide what to do with the bodies,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019d call the parents, and some of them just hung up on us. I put their ashes in the Hudson River and the Grand Canyon. \u201d Mr. Burris used to come to the march with his partner, who died 12 years ago. He imagined that his partner could not have fathomed what the parade had become and how the world had changed. \u201cWe had no idea the beauty that would be here today,\u201d Mr. Burris said, rubbing the goose bumps on his arms.'"}, "time": 1742562962.0185509}
