H.  \u2014   The Saco River flows lazily here, from New Hampshire into Maine, ridged with sandy banks and lush forests, luring eager families in canoes and rowdy flotillas of young adults. But after a hot, dry summer, a   canoe trip to Fryeburg, Me. from Center Conway, N. H. this month was interrupted, time and again, by the scrape of boat on sandy riverbed, and the grudging acceptance that the only way to get the canoe across certain stretches of shallow river would be to drag it. The low river is one of countless signs of dry weather that has settled over much of New England. Conditions are even worse south of the Saco, with the United States Drought Monitor observing \u201cextreme drought\u201d conditions in much of the eastern half of Massachusetts, southeastern New Hampshire and the southern part of Maine. Some private wells have dried up. Farmers face millions of dollars in lost crops, and federal agricultural officials have declared much of New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Connecticut a natural disaster area. Parts of rivers have withered into a series of ponds or wide stretches of stone, harming the ecosystems that depend on them. Bears and other wild animals are venturing into human habitats in search of food because there is little in their own. \u201cWe are not used to this in New England,\u201d said Maggie Hassan, the Democratic governor of New Hampshire. Officials in her state and in Massachusetts have issued dire warnings, urging an end to outdoor watering. Many cities and towns have issued restrictions, although not all are mandatory. Some rain is forecast this week, but the dry summer has taken its toll. A trip through the affected area shows how the region is coping with a dry spell that climatologists say is not expected to fully abate before the end of the year. KINGSTON, N. H.  \u2014   One day in August, Roxy Moore, 70, went to the faucet to make coffee, and the water trickled to nothing. Her well had gone dry for the first time in the 33 years she had lived here. Ms. Moore said she did not have the money to dig a new one. So she has lived without running water for more than a month, subsisting on the good will of friends and neighbors. She has perfected a series of small rituals to help her get by. \u201cYou get up. You boil water in the microwave to take your sink bath. You sometimes want to save that water to use it to flush it in the toilet,\u201d said Ms. Moore, who keeps antibacterial hand wipes by the sink and gives her laundry to her nephew. \u201cIt is what it is,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to learn to live this way until God gives us rain. \u201d Kingston, a town of about 6, 000 in this parched stretch of southeastern New Hampshire, has no public water supply. Residents who rely on private wells are strongly encouraged to conserve, but the town\u2019s selectmen, in a state that places a premium on individual rights, have not instituted a mandatory ban. The town has a spigot outside the fire station for families who no longer have running water. No one is tracking how many people use it, but over an hour on Wednesday night, three people came. Harry Fairbrother, 53, an engineer, filled a   tank that he hooks up to his home. Samuel Mauro, 33, a toy salesman, filled up a few   water jugs. And Sherri Todd, 63, a cancer survivor with three jobs, filled up plastic buckets for the toilet, and big plastic bottles for drinking. \u201cTomorrow will be three weeks\u201d without water, Ms. Todd said, running her hands through her hair. \u201cI just came from my friend\u2019s house to shower, it felt so good. \u201d GREENLAND, N. H.  \u2014   Allen Smith is a   dairy farmer, who names some of his cows after pasta shapes and has a propensity for saying, \u201cHeck yeah!\u201d But months of drought are weighing on the farm, already reeling from the low price of milk. Mr. Smith, 55, typically feeds roughly 160 cows with hay and corn from his fields. The corn has grown, but his hayfields  \u2014   so dry \u201cit sounds like you\u2019re walking in potato chips,\u201d he said  \u2014   have produced a small fraction of what he needs to get through the winter, and he guesses he will need to spend $300 or $400 per day on feed. \u201cThe expense of that is just astronomical,\u201d said Mr. Smith, who said he would consider selling some cows if he had to. Nineteen of New Hampshire\u2019s 120 dairy farms have already gone out of business this year, mostly because of low milk prices, and the drought has made it harder for those that survive. \u201cI know that there are several more farms that are kind of on the edge of the cliff right now,\u201d the state\u2019s agriculture commissioner, Lorraine Merrill, said. IPSWICH, Mass.  \u2014   Joyce Kippin has two passions: water conservation and gardening. Ms. Kippin, 75, is a retired microbiologist who ran the water system in this old coastal town from 1988 to 2008. She is the president of the Ipswich Garden Club, and when the town banned outdoor watering this summer, Ms. Kippin had a problem. \u201cI am in conflict as to whether I water my garden, or, if I\u2019m a responsible citizen, conserve water,\u201d Ms. Kippin said, but she decided she had to set an example. \u201cI had to let my garden go,\u201d Ms. Kippin said. Last summer, Ms. Kippin had blankets of   Susans, billowing hydrangeas and an   tumble of tall flowers along the edge of the lawn. This year, most of those flowers are crunchy dead heads. Her   cherry tree is dying. There are no azaleas to speak of. \u201cMost importantly was my rare, South African,   rhododendron that I\u2019ve had in the ground for 45 years,\u201d Ms. Kippin said. It died. ON THE IPSWICH RIVER  \u2014   This waterway, a haven for fishing and paddling, and a crucial artery for drinking water that flows through the drought hot spot in northeastern Massachusetts, seems distinctly unlike a river, in parts. There is no flow over the dam near downtown Ipswich, and much of the riverbed below is exposed, a ribbon of dry rocks and brittle plants mottled with standing pools. \u201cThe river\u2019s now just a series of ponds and puddles,\u201d said Wayne Castonguay, the executive director of the Ipswich River Watershed Association, which measured record low flows in the river all summer. \u201cIt\u2019s been absolutely devastating,\u201d he said. \u201cVirtually all the larger fish in the river have died. \u201d He added that he had counted 1, 000 dead fish in a tributary this summer. Upriver, a popular canoeing area is now a pool of standing water  \u2014   though outfitters say paddling is still possible on some stretches  \u2014   with exposed, sandy riverbanks and empty shells of mussels that have long since died. \u201cFor people, there\u2019s less water to use and the water is of poorer quality,\u201d Mr. Castonguay said, adding that better conservation might have kept the river flowing. ACTON, Mass.  \u2014   Take a   drive through a lush Boston suburb like this one, and something looks different from other years. Some leaves are dropping earlier than usual, and those on some trees, like birch and beech, are turning to dull colors, not their usual brilliant hues. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be that \u201d Bob Allen, an arborist, said. \u201cIt should be more of a vibrant  . \u201d Mr. Allen is in charge of vegetation management at Eversource, the local power company, whose crews are looking for   trees as they trim branches around power lines. He pulled over next to a sweet birch tree, and looked at its pale green leaves, ringed with dry brown. \u201cThese leaves are showing a scorching effect from the drought,\u201d he said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t really been able to be their full self this year, because of lack of water. \u201d Fall foliage is a boon to New England\u2019s tourism economy, and while many trees are free of   any hint of trouble with foliage brings economic anxiety. And   trees are more likely to topple during storms, Mr. Allen said. SUDBURY, Mass.  \u2014   At Siena Farms, on rich river valley soil west of Boston, many shelling peas and fava beans have not survived. Beets dried out while they were still the size of Tic Tacs. Two surface ponds dried up, and farm managers held daily discussions about what to water and what to let go. \u201cThis year was three months, basically all summer long with no rain, and it caught us off guard,\u201d said Chris Kurth, the owner, during an interview at a farmer\u2019s market in Boston. \u201cAll told, we\u2019re looking at about a 50 percent crop loss. \u201d In August, farmers in the state reported $13. 6 million in lost crops since April that number has most likely grown. Mr. Kurth, like many farmers in New England, does not always have to irrigate. Over the summer in nearby Lincoln, Mass. volunteers at Mass Audubon\u2019s Drumlin Farm Wildlife Sanctuary took to the fields with buckets to nourish some plants. Last week, Matt Celona, the crops manager, worried that the carrots would not size up. \u201cIt would be sort of shocking to go into winter without carrots,\u201d said Mr. Celona, who managed to go most of the summer without irrigation thanks to intensive soil management techniques. Some crops, however, have done fairly well, and both farms\u2019 vibrant stands belie the challenge: At the Drumlin Farm, spinach, watermelon and winter squash did well, while tomatoes did well at Siena Farms. Some fields at Siena Farms sit empty because there is no way to irrigate and there is uncertainty about the forecast. Mr. Kurth is planning to scale back his planting next year, and he has taken the unusual step of asking his regular customers to contribute more to help the farm if they can. \u201cPlants have an amazing ability to survive in extreme conditions and not just give up and die,\u201d Mr. Kurth said. \u201cHopefully, us farmers have the same strength in us. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628455.6263452}
