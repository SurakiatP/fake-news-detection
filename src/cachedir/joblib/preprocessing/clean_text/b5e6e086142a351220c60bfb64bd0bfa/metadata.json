Robinson \\nThis article previously appeared in Global Research and Current Affairs . \\n\u201cShe intended to \u2018make Haiti the proving ground for her vision of American power.\u2019\u201d \\nBill and Hillary Clinton had long shared a personal interest in Haiti, dating back to the time of their honeymoon, part of which was spent in Port-au-Prince. In his autobiography, Bill says that his understanding of God and human nature were profoundly transformed when they witnessed a voodoo ceremony in which a woman bit the head off a live chicken. Hillary Clinton says the two of them \u201cfell in love\u201d with Haiti and they had developed a \u201cdeep connection\u201d to the country. So when Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State in 2009, she consciously made the redevelopment of Haiti one of her top priorities. The country, she announced, would be a laboratory where the United States could \u201croad-test new approaches to development,\u201d taking advantage of what she termed \u201cthe power of proximity.\u201d She intended to \u201cmake Haiti the proving ground for her vision of American power.\u201d Hillary Clinton selected her own chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, to run the Haiti project. \\nMills would be joined by Bill Clinton, who had been deputized by the U.N. as a \u201cspecial envoy\u201d to Haiti. Bill\u2019s role was not well-defined, and Haitians were curious about what was in store. Mills wrote in an email to Hillary Clinton that Haitians saw Bill\u2019s appointment as \u201ca step toward putting Haiti in a protectorate or trusteeship status.\u201d Soon, \u201cjoking that he must be coming back to lead a new colonial regime,\u201d the Haitian media \u201c dubbed him Le Gouverneur.\u201d \\nThe project was heavily focused on increasing Haiti\u2019s appeal to foreign corporations. As Politico reported , Clinton\u2019s experiment \u201chad business at its center: Aid would be replaced by investment, the growth of which would in turn benefit the United States.\u201d \\n\u201cClinton announced that Haiti would be a laboratory where the United States could road-test new approaches to development, taking advantage of \u2018the power of proximity.\u2019\u201d \\nOne of the first acts in the new \u201cbusiness-centered\u201d Haiti policy involved suppressing Haiti\u2019s minimum wage. A 2009 Haitian law raised the minimum wage to 61 cents an hour, from 24 cents an hour previously. Haitian garment manufacturers, including contractors for Hanes and Levi Strauss, were furious, insisting that they were only willing to agree to a seven-cent increase. The manufacturers approached the U.S. State Department, who brought intense pressure to bear against Haitian President Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val, working to \u201caggressively block\u201d the 37-cent increase. The U.S. Deputy Mission Chief said a minimum-wage increase \u201cdid not take economic reality into account\u201d and simply \u201cappealed to the unemployed and underpaid masses.\u201d But as Ryan Chittum of the Columbia Journalism Review explained , the proposed wage increase would have been only the most trivial additional expense for the American garment manufacturers: \\n\u201cAs of last year Hanes had 3,200 Haitians making t-shirts for it. Paying each of them two bucks a day more would cost it about $1.6 million a year. Hanesbrands Incorporated made $211 million on $4.3 billion in sales last year, and presumably it would pass on at least some of its higher labor costs to consumers. Or better yet, Hanesbrands CEO Richard Noll could forego some of his rich compensation package. He could pay for the raises for those 3,200 t-shirt makers with just one-sixth of the $10 million in salary and bonus he raked in last year.\u201d \\n\u201cU.S. Deputy Mission Chief said a minimum-wage increase \u2018did not take economic reality into account\u201d and simply \u2018appealed to the unemployed and underpaid masses.\u2019\u201d \\nThe truth of the \u201ceconomic reality\u201d was that the Haitian undergarment sector was hardly likely to become wildly less competitive as a result of the increase. The effort to suppress the minimum wage was not solely a Clinton project. It was also a \u201cconcerted effort on the part of Haitian elites, factory owners, free trade proponents, U.S. politicians, economists, and American companies.\u201d But it was in keeping with the State Department\u2019s priorities under Clinton, which prioritized creating a favorable business climate. It was that same familiar Clinton move \u201cfrom aid to trade.\u201d Bill Clinton\u2019s program for Haitian development, designed by Oxford University economist Paul Collier, \u201c had garment exports at its center.\u201d Collier wrote that because of \u201cpropitious\u201d factors like \u201cpoverty and [a] relatively unregulated labor market, Haiti has labor costs that are fully competitive with China.\u201d But the Clintons\u2019 role in Haiti would soon expand even further. In 2010, the country was struck by the worst earthquake in its history. The disaster killed 160,000 people and displaced over 1.5 million more. (The consequences of the earthquake were exacerbated by the ruined state of the Haitian food economy, plus the concentration of unemployed Haitian farmers in Port-au-Prince.) Bill Clinton was soon put in charge of the U.S.-led recovery effort. He was appointed to head the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission (IHRC), which would oversee a wide range of rebuilding projects. At President Obama\u2019s request, Clinton and George W. Bush created the \u201cClinton-Bush Haiti Fund,\u201d and began aggressively fundraising around the world to support Haiti in the earthquake\u2019s aftermath. (With Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State overseeing the efforts of USAID, the Clintons\u2019 importance to the recovery could not be overstated; Bill\u2019s appointment meant that \u201cat every stage of Haiti\u2019s reconstruction\u2014fundraising, oversight and allocation\u2014a Clinton was now involved.\u201d \\nDespite appearances, the Clinton-Bush fund was not focused on providing traditional relief. As they wrote , \u201c[w]hile other organizations in Haiti are using their resources to deliver immediate humanitarian aid, we are using our resources to focus on long-term development.\u201d While the fund would advertise that \u201c100% of donations go directly to relief efforts,\u201d Clinton and Bush adopted an expansive definition of \u201crelief\u201d efforts, treating luring foreign investment and jobs as a crucial part of earthquake recovery. On their website, they spoke proudly of what the New York Daily News characterized as a program of \u201csupporting longterm programs to develop Haiti\u2019s business class.\u201d \\n\u201cAt every stage of Haiti\u2019s reconstruction\u2014fundraising, oversight and allocation\u2014a Clinton was now involved.\u201d \\nThe strategy was an odd one. Port-au-Prince had been reduced to ruin, and Haitians were crowded into filthy tent cities, where many were dying of a cholera outbreak (which had itself been caused by the negligence of the United Nations). Whatever value building new garment factories may have had as a longterm economic plan, Haitians were faced with somewhat more pressing concerns like the basic provision of shelter and medicine, as well as the clearing of the thousands of tons of rubble that filled their streets. \\nThe Clinton-led recovery was a disaster. A year after the earthquake, a stinging report from Oxfam singled out Clinton\u2019s IHRC as creating a \u201cquagmire of indecision and delay\u201d that had made little progress toward successful earthquake recovery. Oxfam found that: \\n\u201c\u2026less than half of the reconstruction aid promised by international donors has been disbursed. And while some of that money has been put toward temporary housing, almost none of the funds have been used for rubble removal.\u201d \\nInstead, the Clinton Foundation, IHRC, and State Department created what a Wall Street Journal writer called \u201ca mishmash of low quality, poorly thought-out development experiments and half-finished projects.\u201d Haitian IHRC members lamented that the commission had produced \u201ca disparate bunch of approved projects. . . [that] do not address as a whole either the emergency situation or the recovery, let alone the development, of Haiti.\u201d A 2013 investigation by the Government Accountability Office found that most money for the recovery was not being dispersed, and that the projects that were being worked on were plagued by delays and cost overruns. Many Clinton projects were extravagant public relations affairs that quickly fizzled. For example, The Washington Post reported that : \\n\u201c\u2026[a] 2011 housing expo that cost more than $2 million, including $500,000 from the Clinton Foundation, was supposed to be a model for thousands of new units but instead has resulted in little more than a few dozen abandoned model homes occupied by squatters.\u201d \\n\u201c A stinging report from Oxfam singled out Clinton\u2019s IHRC as creating a \u2018quagmire of indecision and delay.\u2019\u201d \\nOther Clinton ventures were seen as \u201cdisconnected from the realities of most people in the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere.\u201d Politico reported that many Clinton projects \u201chave primarily benefited wealthy foreigners and the island\u2019s ruling elite, who needed little help to begin with.\u201d For example, \u201cthe Clinton Bush Haiti Fund invested more than $2 million in the Royal Oasis Hotel, where a sleek suite with hardwood floors costs more than $200 a night and the shops sell $150 designer purses and $120 men\u2019s dress shirts.\u201d \\nPredictably, the Royal Oasis didn\u2019t do an especially roaring trade; The Washington Post reported that \u201c[o]ne recent afternoon, the hotel appeared largely empty, and with tourism hardly booming five years after the quake, locals fear it may be failing.\u201d In a country with a 30-cent minimum wage, investing recovery dollars in a luxury hotel was not just offensive, but economically daft. Sometimes the recovery projects were accused not only of being pointless, but of being downright harmful. For instance, Bill Clinton had proudly announced that the Clinton Foundation would be funding the \u201cconstruction of emergency storm shelters in L\u00e9og\u00e2ne.\u201d But an investigation of the shelters that the Foundation had actually built found that they were \u201cshoddy and dangerous\u201d and full of toxic mold. The Nation discovered , among other things, that the temperature in the shelters reached over 100 degrees, causing children to experience headaches and eye irritations (which may have been compounded by the mold), and that the trailers showed high levels of carcinogenic formaldehyde, linked to asthma and other lung diseases. The Clinton Foundation had subcontracted the building of the shelters to Clayton Homes, a firm that had already been sued in the United States by the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) for \u201chaving provided formaldehyde-laced trailers to Hurricane Katrina victims.\u201d (Clayton Homes was owned by Warren Buffett \u2019s Berkshire Hathaway, and Buffett had been a longstanding major donor to the Clinton Foundation.) The Nation \u2019s investigation reported on children whose classes were being held in Clinton Foundation trailers. Their semester had just been cut short, and the students sent home, because the temperature in the classrooms had grown unbearable. The misery of the students in the Clinton trailers was described: \\n\u201cJudith Seide, a student in Lubert\u2019s sixth-grade class [explained that] she and her classmates regularly suffer from painful headaches in their new Clinton Foundation classroom. Every day, she said, her \u2018head hurts and I feel it spinning and have to stop moving, otherwise I\u2019d fall.\u2019 Her vision goes dark, as is the case with her classmate Judel, who sometimes can\u2019t open his eyes because, said Seide, \u2018he\u2019s allergic to the heat.\u2019 Their teacher regularly relocates the class outside into the shade of the trailer because the swelter inside is insufferable. Sitting in the sixth-grade classroom, student Mondialie Cineas, who dreams of becoming a nurse, said that three times a week the teacher gives her and her classmates painkillers so that they can make it through the school day. \u2018At noon, the class gets so hot, kids get headaches,\u2019 the 12-year-old said, wiping beads of sweat from her brow. She is worried because \u2018the kids feel sick, can\u2019t work, can\u2019t advance to succeed.\u2019\u201d \\n\u201cThree times a week the teacher gives her and her classmates painkillers so that they can make it through the school day.\u201d \\nThe most notorious post-earthquake development project, however, was the Caracol industrial park . The park was pitched as a major job creator, part of the goal of helping Haiti \u201cbuild back better\u201d than it was before. The State Department touted the prospect of 100,000 new jobs for Haitians, with Hillary Clinton promising 65,000 jobs within five years. The industrial park followed the Clintons\u2019 preexisting development model for Haiti: public/private partnerships with a heavy emphasis on the garment industry. Even though there were still hundreds of thousands of evacuees living in tents, the project was based on \u201cthe more expansive view that, in a desperately poor country where traditional foreign aid has chronically failed, fostering economic development is as important as replacing what fell down.\u201d Much of the planning was focused on trying to lure a South Korean clothing manufacturer to set up shop there, by plying them with U.S. taxpayer funding. The Caracol project was \u201cthe centerpiece\u201d of the U.S.\u2019s recovery effort. A gala celebrating its opening featured the Clintons and Sean Penn, and it was treated as the emblem of the new, \u201cbetter\u201d Haiti, that would demonstrate the country\u2019s commitment to being \u201copen for business.\u201d In order to build the park, hundreds of poor farmers were evicted from their land, so that millions of dollars could be spent transforming it. \\nBut the project was a terrible disappointment. After four years, it was only operating at 10% capacity , and the jobs had failed to materialize : \\nFar from 100,000 jobs\u2014or even the 60,000 promised within five years of the park\u2019s opening\u2014 \u201cCaracol currently employs just 5,479 people full time. That comes out to roughly $55,000 in investment per job created so far; or, to put it another way, about 30 times more per job than the average [Caracol] worker makes per year. The park, built on the site of a former U.S. Marine-run slave labor camp during the 1915-1934 U.S. occupation, has the best-paved roads and manicured sidewalks in the country, but most of the land remains vacant.\u201d \\nMost of the seized farmland went unused, then, and even for the remaining farmers, \u201c surges of wastewater have caused floods and spoiled crops.\u201d Huge queues of unemployed Haitians stood daily in front of the factory, awaiting jobs that did not exist. The Washington Post described the scene: \\n\u201cEach morning, crowds line up outside the park\u2019s big front gate, which is guarded by four men in crisp khaki uniforms carrying shotguns. They wait in a sliver of shade next to a cinder-block wall, many holding r\u00e9sum\u00e9s in envelopes. Most said they have been coming every day for months, waiting for jobs that pay about $5 a day. From his envelope, Jean Mito Palvetus, 27, pulled out a diploma attesting that he had completed 200 hours of training with the U.S. Agency for International Development on an industrial sewing machine. \u2018I have three kids and a wife, and I can\u2019t support them,\u2019 he said, sweating in the hot morning sun. \u2018I have a diploma, but I still can\u2019t get a job here. I still have nothing.\u2019\u201d \\n\u201c The interests of the market, the interest of foreigners are prioritized over the majority of people who are impoverished in Haiti.\u201d \\nFor some , the Caracol project perfectly symbolized the Clinton approach: big promises, an emphasis on sweatshops, incompetent management, and little concern for the actual impact on Haitians. \u201cCaracol is a prime example of bad help,\u201d as one Haiti scholar put it . \u201cThe interests of the market, the interest of foreigners are prioritized over the majority of people who are impoverished in Haiti.\u201d \\nBut, failure as it may have been, the Caracol factory was among the more successful of the projects, insofar as it actually came into existence. A large amount of the money raised by Bill Clinton after the earthquake, and pledged by the U.S. under Hillary Clinton, simply disappeared without a trace, its whereabouts unknown. As Politico explained : \\n\u201cEven Bill\u2019s U.N. Office of the Special Envoy couldn\u2019t track where all of [it] went\u2014and the truth is that still today no one really knows how much money was spent \u2018rebuilding\u2019 Haiti. Many initial pledges never materialized. A whopping $465 million of the relief money went through the Pentagon, which spent it on deployment of U.S. troops\u201420,000 at the high water mark, many of whom never set foot on Haitian soil. That money included fuel for ships and planes, helicopter repairs and inscrutables such as an $18,000 contract for a jungle gym\u2026 Huge contracts were doled out to the usual array of major contractors, including a $16.7 million logistics contract whose partners included Agility Public Warehousing KSC, a Kuwaiti firm that was supposed to have been blacklisted from doing business with Washington after a 2009 indictment alleging a conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government during the Iraq War.\u201d \\nThe recovery under the Clintons became notorious for its mismanagement. Clinton staffers \u201c had no idea what Haiti was like and had no sensitivity to the Haitians.\u201d They were reportedly rude and condescending toward Haitians, even refusing to admit Haitian government ministers to meetings about recovery plans. While the Clintons called in high-profile consulting firms like McKinsey to draw up plans, they had little interest in listening to Haitians themselves. The former Haitian prime minister spoke of a \u201cweak\u201d American staff who were \u201cmore interested in supporting Clinton than helping Haiti.\u201d \\n\u201cA large amount of the money raised by Bill Clinton after the earthquake, and pledged by the U.S. under Hillary Clinton, simply disappeared without a trace, its whereabouts unknown.\u201d \\nOne of those shocked by the failure of the recovery effort was Chelsea Clinton, who wrote a detailed email to her parents in which she said that while Haitians were trying to help themselves, every part of the international aid effort, both governmental and nongovernmental, was falling short. \u201cThe incompetence is mind numbing,\u201d she wrote . Chelsea produced a detailed memorandum recommending drastic steps that needed to be taken in order to get the recovery on track. But the memo was kept within the Clinton family, released only later under a Freedom of Information Act disclosure of Hillary\u2019s State Department correspondence. If it had come out at the time, as Haiti journalist Jonathan Katz writes , it \u201cwould have obliterated the public narrative of helpful outsiders saving grateful earthquake survivors that her mother\u2019s State Department was working so hard to promote.\u201d \\nThe Clintons\u2019 Haiti recovery ended with a whimper. The Clinton-Bush Haiti Fund distributed the last of its funds in 2012 and disbanded, without any attempt at further fundraising. The IHRC \u201c quietly closed their doors\u201d in October of 2011, even though little progress had been made. As the Boston Review \u2019s Jake Johnston explained , though hundreds of thousands remained displaced, the IHRC wiped its hands of the housing situation: \\n\u201c[L]ittle remained of the grand plans to build thousands of new homes. Instead, those left homeless would be given a small, one-time rental subsidy of about $500. These subsidies, funded by a number of different aid agencies, were meant to give private companies the incentive to invest in building houses. As efforts to rebuild whole neighborhoods faltered, the rental subsidies turned Haitians into consumers, and the housing problem was handed over to the private sector.\u201d \\nThe Clintons themselves simply stopped speaking about Haiti. After the first two years, they were \u201cnowhere to be seen\u201d there, despite Hillary\u2019s having promised that her commitment to Haiti would long outlast her tenure as Secretary of State. Haiti has been given little attention during Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, even though the Haiti project was ostensibly one of great pride for both Clintons. \\n\u201cOne of those shocked by the failure of the recovery effort was Chelsea Clinton.\u201d \\nThe widespread consensus among observers is that the Haiti recovery, which TIME called the U.S.\u2019s \u201ccompassionate invasion,\u201d was a catastrophically mismanaged disappointment. Jonathan Katz writes that \u201cit\u2019s hard to find anyone these days who looks back on the U.S.-led response to the January 12, 2010, Haiti earthquake as a success.\u201d While plenty of money was channeled into the country, it largely went to what were \u201clittle more than small pilot projects\u2014a new set of basketball hoops and a model elementary school here, a functioning factory there.\u201d \\nThe end result has been that little has changed for Haiti. \u201cHaitians find themselves in a social and economic situation that is worse than before the earthquake,\u201d reports a Belgian photojournalist who has spent 10 years in Haiti: \\n\u201cEveryone says that they\u2019re living in worse conditions than before\u2026 When you look at the history of humanitarian relief, there\u2019s never been a situation when such a small country has been the target of such a massive influx of money and assistance in such a short span of time\u2026 On paper, with that much money in a territory the size of Haiti, we should have witnessed miracles; there should have been results.\u201d \\n\u201cIf anything, they appear worse off,\u201d says Foreign Policy of Haiti\u2019s farmers. \u201cI really cannot understand how you could raise so much money, put a former U.S. president in charge, and get this outcome,\u201d said one Haitian official. Indeed, the money donated and invested was extraordinary. But nobody seems to know where it has gone. \\nHaitians direct much of the blame toward the Clintons. As a former Haitian government official who worked on the recovery said , \u201c[t]here is a lot of resentment about Clinton here. People have not seen results. . .. They say that Clinton used Haiti.\u201d Haitians \u201c increasingly complain that Clinton-backed projects have often helped the country\u2019s elite and international business investors more than they have helped poor \u2018Haitians.\u201d There is a \u201csuspicion that their motives are more to make a profit in Haiti than to help it.\u201d And that while \u201cstriking a populist pose, in practice they were attracted to power in Haiti.\u201d \\nBut perhaps we should be more forgiving of the Clintons\u2019 conduct during the Haitian recovery. After all, instead of doing true harm, the Clintons simply failed to do much good. And perhaps it\u2019s better to have a luxury hotel than not to have one, better to have a few jobs than none at all. Thanks to Bill Clinton, there\u2019s a gleaming new industrial park, albeit one operating at a fraction of its capacity. \\nYet it\u2019s a mistake to measure Clinton against what would have happened if the United States had done nothing at all for Haiti. The question is what would have happened if a capable, nonfamous administrator, rather than a globetrotting narcissist, had been placed in charge. Tens of millions of dollars were donated toward the Haiti recovery by people across the world; it was an incredible outpouring of generosity. The squandering of that money on half-baked development schemes (mainly led by cronies ), and the ignoring of Haitians\u2019 own demands, mean that Clinton may have caused considerable harm through his failure. Plenty of people died in tent cities that would not have died if the world\u2019s donations had been used effectively. \\n\u201cDefending the Clintons\u2019 Haiti record is an impossible endeavor.\u201d \\nDemocrats have bristled at recent attempts by Donald Trump to criticize Hillary Clinton over her record in Haiti. Jonathan Katz, whose in-depth reporting from Haiti was stingingly critical of the Clintons, has now changed his tune , insisting that we all bear the responsibility for the failed recovery effort. When Trump accused the Clintons of squandering millions building \u201ca sweatshop\u201d in Haiti in the form of the Caracol park, media fact-checkers quickly insisted he was spewing Pinocchios. The Washington Post said that while Clinton Foundation donors may have financially benefited from the factory-building project, they benefited \u201cwrit large\u201d rather than \u201cdirectly.\u201d The Post cited the words of the factory\u2019s spokesman as evidence that the factory was not a sweatshop, and pointed out that Caracol workers earned at least \u201cminimum wage\u201d (failing to mention that minimum wage in Haiti remains well under a dollar). PolitiFact also rated the sweatshop claim \u201cmostly false,\u201d even though Katz notes \u201clong hours, tough conditions, and low pay\u201d at the factory and PolitiFact acknowledges the \u201congoing theft of legally-earned wages.\u201d \\nDefending the Clintons\u2019 Haiti record is an impossible endeavor, one Democrats should probably not bother attempting. As the Center for Economic and Policy Research, which has studied the recovery, noted , when it comes to the Clinton-led recovery mission, \u201cit\u2019s hard to say it\u2019s been anything other than a failure.\u201d Haitians are not delusional in their resentment of the Clintons; they have good reason to feel as if they were used for publicity, and discarded by the Clintons when they became inconvenient. \\nNone of this means that one should vote for Donald Trump for president. His tears for Haiti are those of a highly opportunistic crocodile, and his interest in the country\u2019s wellbeing began at the precise moment that it could be used a bludgeon with which to beat his political opponent. As we have previously noted in this publication , one does not need to be convinced that Hillary Clinton is an honorable person in order to be convinced that she is the preferable candidate. It is important, however, not to maintain any illusions, not to stifle or massage the truth in the service of short-term electoral concerns. It remains simultaneously true that a Clinton presidency is our present least-worst option and that what the Clintons did to Haiti was callous, selfish, and indefensible.'"}, "time": 1742561640.0574298}
