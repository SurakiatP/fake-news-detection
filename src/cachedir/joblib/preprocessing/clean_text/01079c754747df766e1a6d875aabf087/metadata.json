While he\u2019s campaigning for Hillary Clinton, the FBI is investigating clear evidence that indicates he is guilty of treason. These idiots, Obama and Hillary, are in denial, running around the country and droning on about \u201chope and change\u201d when the cat\u2019s out of the bag. New evidence could put Obama in prison right next to Hillary, and Americans couldn\u2019t be happier. \\nNo one is above the law, but Hillary and her crime cartel thought that they were. Now, Obama is facing his worst nightmare as the FBI is also gunning for him. Shocking new revelations came from Fox News\u2019 Catherine Herridge, who reports that Huma Abedin spilled the beans on Obama: \\n\u201cOne of the key things we\u2019ve learned in the FBI interviews, known as 302s, came from Clinton aide Huma Abedin . She told the FBI investigators that every time Hillary Clinton\u2019s personal [email] address changed, they would update the White House so that the president could continue receiving Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails on his high security devices, including his Blackberry.\u201d \\nListen to the shocking report below: \\nHerridge went on to explain , \u201cThe reason that matters is that that is evidence that goes to knowledge of the White House [Obama] of this personal system [Hillary\u2019s home-based server] and the changing addresses. So, this is something where the president and the White House clearly have a horse in the race and a stake in the outcome [FBI investigation].\u201d \\nThis is exactly what happened to former president Richard Nixon in the Watergate scandal , except no one made money and there was never any risk to national security. So, as far as degree of damage done, Hillary and Obama put American lives at risk and allowed our enemies access to our top secrets \u2014 and that\u2019s treason. '"}, "time": 1742564286.2710414}
