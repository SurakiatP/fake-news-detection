But it did recently when a judge there sentenced a man to just 60 days in jail after he repeatedly raped his    daughter. In the three weeks since the sentence was issued, over 80, 000 people have signed an initiative seeking to have the judge impeached. The New York Times\u2019s Express desk caught up to the news on Friday, but it put a headline on its story that drew its own protests: \u201cMontana Judge Criticized for   Sentence for Man Who Has Sex With His Preteen Daughter. \u201d In the view of many Times readers, that was a poor attempt to sum up the story. Among them was Elizabeth DeHoff, who homed in on the problem with the headline: DeHoff, of Littleton, Colo. articulates well the concerns of many of the readers who emailed me on Friday. Editors were clearly struggling with the headline, changing it five times over the course of the day. About three hours after the initial headline went up, a new one was put on the story, getting a little closer to the mark, but clunky: \u201cMontana Judge Criticized for   Sentence for Man for Incest With Daughter, 12. \u201d Finally, after three more tries, the headline read: \u201cMontana Judge Is Criticized for   Incest Sentence. \u201d (Still later, the headline was changed again, to \u201cOutrage Follows   Sentence in Incest Case Against Father of Girl, 12. \u201d) Those were improvements but, in my view, they still fell short of the mark. To understand the thinking behind the headline changes, I spoke with Patrick LaForge, the editor who oversees the Express desk, which aims to get news from around the country up on the Times site quickly. \u201cAfter the story was published early this morning, a number of editors and readers rightly objected to that language,\u201d LaForge said. \u201cAfter some discussion, the headline and lead paragraphs were revised to more clearly specify the charge. Please offer apologies and thanks to the readers who pointed this out. We\u2019ve had a thorough conversation with the editors who were involved. \u201d I appreciate, and suspect readers appreciate, LaForge\u2019s acknowledgment of a mistake in judgment and the effort to rectify it. But while the headline improved when it backed off the idea that this was simply \u201csex,\u201d in my view the final headline still didn\u2019t go far enough by merely referring to \u201cincest. \u201d After all, the word incest to many readers might imply sex with a blood relative that is quite possibly consensual. Several other news sites didn\u2019t hesitate to label this \u201crape\u201d in their headline, among them CBS News, Time, The Washington Post and New York magazine. The challenge for headline writers in this case was that the man sentenced pleaded guilty to a charge of incest. So the safe thing to do is just stick to that word. But there should come a point in the   process when common sense kicks in. People are enraged because by any reasonable reading of the news story, a man raped a preteen girl, repeatedly, and he\u2019ll spend two months in jail for it. The prosecutor used the word \u201crape\u201d in court. The Times should have, too.'"}, "time": 1742564224.7046165}
