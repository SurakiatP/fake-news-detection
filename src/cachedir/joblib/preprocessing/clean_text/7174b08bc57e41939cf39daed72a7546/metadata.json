As David reported, he\u2019s ready to fund, advise recruit talent, etc. He was more deferential on structure than I expected. Wasn\u2019t pushing to run through one of his existing firms.

He\u2019s still in DC tomorrow and would like to meet with you if you are in DC in the afternoon. I think it\u2019s worth doing. You around?
