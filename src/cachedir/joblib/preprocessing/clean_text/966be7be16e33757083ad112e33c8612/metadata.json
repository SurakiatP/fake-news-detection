Eisenach, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, was hard to miss. He wrote   articles, including for The New York Times, that were critical of the rules. He filed formal comments with the Federal Communications Commission, where he also met privately with senior lawyers. He appeared before Congress and issued reports detailing how destructive the new rules would be. \u201cNet neutrality would not improve consumer welfare or protect the public interest,\u201d Mr. Eisenach testified in September 2014 before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Intense advocacy by a think tank scholar is not notable in itself, but Mr. Eisenach, 58, a former aide at the Federal Trade Commission, has held another job: as a paid consultant for Verizon and its trade association. And he has plenty of company. An examination of 75 think tanks found an array of researchers who had simultaneously worked as registered lobbyists, members of corporate boards or outside consultants in litigation and regulatory disputes, with only intermittent disclosure of their dual roles. With their expertise and authority, think tank scholars offer themselves as independent arbiters, playing a vital role in Washington\u2019s political economy. Their imprimatur helps shape government decisions that can be lucrative to corporations. But the examination identified dozens of examples of scholars conducting research at think tanks while corporations were paying them to help shape government policy. Many think tanks also readily confer \u201cnonresident scholar\u201d status on lobbyists, former government officials and others who earn their primary living working for private clients, with few restrictions on such outside work. Largely free from disclosure requirements, the researchers\u2019 work is often woven into elaborate corporate lobbying campaigns. \u201cA report authored by an academic is going to have more credibility in the eyes of the regulator who is reading it,\u201d said Michael J. Copps, a former F. C. C. commissioner who is a special adviser for the Media and Democracy Reform Initiative at Common Cause, a liberal group. \u201cThey are seeking to build credibility where none exists. \u201d And it is a decidedly bipartisan practice. Roger Zakheim, a visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, has used research to push for greater spending for new military equipment while working as a lobbyist for Pentagon suppliers like Northrop Grumman and BAE Systems, lobbying records show. At the   Brookings Institution, Dr. Mark B. McClellan led a health care studies program as he served on the board of directors at Johnson  Johnson, where he was paid $264, 899 last fiscal year. The company sells a   hepatitis C treatment, an approach that Dr. McClellan defended from his Brookings perch. Carol M. Browner, a former top environmental adviser to President Obama, works as a paid consultant to the nuclear power industry, pushing for government policies that help keep nuclear power plants online. Until recently, she also served as an unpaid senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. The overlapping roles are often not made clear, and even members of Congress say they are frequently unaware of the financial ties between industries and the witnesses with think tank titles appearing before them at hearings. \u201cThey can make a very deceptive and false claim to credibility that is totally lacking,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, who said he had become increasingly disturbed by the role of think tank experts on Capitol Hill. \u201cI think about it every time there is a witness now from a \u2018think tank,\u2019 putting that term in very boldface quotes. \u201d Scholars sometimes include general references to their   work in their official biographies. Mr. Eisenach, for example, notes that he is an executive at NERA Economic Consulting in addition to his position at the American Enterprise Institute. And when a private company pays him or his consulting firm to publish a study, he discloses the name of the corporate sponsor on the study. But there is no way for the public or policy makers to know Mr. Eisenach\u2019s full roster of NERA clients. And there is no comprehensive disclosure of these clients when he writes his think tank reports or academic papers, testifies before Congress, or meets with F. C. C. members or staff. Mr. Eisenach declined repeated requests to comment in detail. But a spokeswoman for the American Enterprise Institute, Judy Mayka Stecker, said she saw no conflict in his roles. \u201cWe believe in the open competition of ideas and encourage our scholars to engage with experts from all sectors and viewpoints,\u201d she said. Yet even as The Times was making inquiries about the potential for conflicts of interest among some think tank researchers, officials at a number of the nation\u2019s most prominent institutions  \u2014   including Brookings and the Peterson Institute for International Economics  \u2014   acknowledged that they were revising    policies. \u201cI think we have too much influence of funded research with clear interests at stake that is treated as though it is independent and academic research,\u201d said Yochai Benkler, a professor at Harvard Law School and   of its Berkman Klein Center for Internet  Society. \u201cThere is no culture in the discipline to mark funded research clearly, or systematically treat it as less reliable. \u201d Several weeks after Tom Wheeler was sworn in as the F. C. C. chairman in 2013, he received a letter signed by more than a dozen prominent economists and scholars identified by their affiliations with Washington think tanks or academic institutions. The economic evidence, they declared, showed that the internet should not be regulated as a public utility. They urged Mr. Wheeler to reject \u201cnet neutrality\u201d regulations that would give the federal government additional powers to oversee the $100 billion market for internet services, dominated by ATT, Verizon and Comcast. A footnote on the first page of the letter indicated that none of the scholars who signed had been compensated by stakeholder companies. But of the dozen studies they submitted as evidence, more than half had been funded by telecommunications giants or based on other work for the companies, industry ties that were disclosed only in footnotes in the original studies. No federal rules required broader disclosure. Yet on many highly technical policy issues like telecommunications regulation, scholarship is dominated by   research, according to a review of hundreds of studies, regulatory filings and other documents. \u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019re in legal and you want to have a paper that says what you want it to say,\u201d said Dennis Weller, a former Verizon economist who occasionally consults for telecommunications companies and international organizations. \u201cYou could have a bunch of economists in house and ask them if they agree with you. How much easier would it be to go to an outside economist and say, \u2018How about if I pay you $100, 000 to write this? \u2019\u201d Few policy battles have had higher stakes in recent years than the debate over net neutrality  \u2014   a catchall term for proposals to restrict internet service providers from blocking websites or regulating speed. To bolster their claims that the regulations would hurt consumers, companies have financed research that contends the rules would reduce investment in new services and raise prices. That work is used to shape the public debate and to build an   narrative in the regulatory record, one that the F. C. C. is required by law to evaluate.   research has also figured prominently in court battles over F. C. C. efforts to regulate the internet. When Verizon successfully opposed an earlier F. C. C. rule on net neutrality, more than half of the 23 studies or expert declarations cited in court filings had been sponsored directly by telecommunications companies or trade associations, according to an analysis by The Times. Other studies had been published under the banner of think tanks but written by scholars who consulted extensively for companies. The attacks began to grow particularly heated nearly two years ago, when Mr. Obama called on Mr. Wheeler and his fellow F. C. C. commissioners to regulate the internet like traditional phone lines. In December 2014, Robert Litan, then a senior fellow at Brookings, and Hal Singer, then a senior fellow at the   Progressive Policy Institute, released a \u201cpolicy brief\u201d claiming that such a proposal could cost $15 billion in new fees. (They later revised the figure to $11 billion.) The study mentioned their employment at Economists Incorporated, a consulting firm in Washington. But a reader would have had to do more research to learn that Economists Incorporated\u2019s clients included ATT and Verizon, companies leading the industry\u2019s charge against the commission proposal. That was disclosed on a \u201cselect client list\u201d on the Economists Incorporated website. Mr. Singer and Mr. Litan\u2019s study quickly became central to the industry\u2019s lobbying campaign. The National Cable and Telecommunications Association, a trade group that is listed as an Economists Incorporated client, began an advertising campaign, based on the study, that ran in Washington and beyond. When debate on the proposal started in Congress, the study was repeatedly cited by lawmakers who wanted to block Mr. Wheeler\u2019s plan. \u201cPeople who are running advertisements are not going to say, \u2018In a study we paid for,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Litan, now an adjunct senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cIn the public discourse, the disclaimers often do get dropped. \u201d Mr. Singer, in a Twitter post directed at critics of the study, was a bit more blunt. \u201cNone of us works for free,\u201d Mr. Singer wrote. \u201cSo let\u2019s focus on the merits  be nice to each other!\u201d In an interview, Mr. Singer said he  \u2014   like most scholars  \u2014   disclosed when a client commissioned a particular study published through his consulting firm. Most specialists in the telecommunications field, he suggested, are well aware of his business connections and views on regulatory issues. \u201cEverybody is on different teams,\u201d Mr. Singer said. \u201cSo long as you tell the audience what team you are on, you can then offer the opinions. Disclosure is the antidote to all of this. \u201d Few scholars have been as active in the net neutrality debate as Mr. Eisenach. At least a dozen times between 2007 and 2016, Mr. Eisenach published studies  \u2014   including one analysis later released under the American Enterprise Institute\u2019s banner  \u2014   that were underwritten by Verizon or a   trade association. (He also wrote two papers last year for Facebook, which has declared its support for net neutrality.) In the fall of 2013, he became the director of the think tank\u2019s new center on media and internet policy. A few months later, he joined NERA, one of the country\u2019s oldest and   economic consultancies, as a senior vice president of the firm\u2019s telecommunications practice, the latest in a string of jobs at industry consulting firms. \u201cJeff is good at linking big theoretical ideas to policy, and he\u2019s been good at making money doing that,\u201d said Mr. Weller, the former Verizon economist. \u201cHe\u2019s been good at moving from think tank to think tank and company to company, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever lost money doing it. \u201d Mr. Eisenach has testified before Congress, filed comment letters to the F. C. C. that mention his status as an American Enterprise Institute scholar, and met privately with F. C. C. commissioners, according to emails obtained through an open records request. He has also organized public briefings featuring, among others, Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, the chairman of the Senate commerce committee, which oversees the F. C. C. Mr. Eisenach used his position as a think tank researcher to help rally opposition to net neutrality regulations. At a given moment, it can be difficult to determine which hat Mr. Eisenach is wearing. In September 2014, at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on net neutrality, the formal meeting agenda listed Mr. Eisenach as a visiting scholar at the institute. His written testimony mentioned that he also served as \u201c  of NERA Economic Consulting\u2019s Communications, Media and Internet Practice,\u201d but included no explicit reference to clients like Verizon. As he opened his testimony, Mr. Eisenach suggested that his opposition was based purely on his personal views. \u201cWhile I am here in my capacity as a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, the views I express are my own, should not be attributed to A. E. I. or to any of the organizations with which I am affiliated,\u201d he said. He then detailed his vehement opposition to further federal regulation of the internet. \u201cThe potential costs of net neutrality regulation are both sweeping and severe,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is best understood as an effort by one set of private interests to enrich itself by using the power of the state. \u201d Both the institute and his consulting firm posted his testimony on their websites. Mr. Eisenach was similarly ambiguous when he interacted with members of the F. C. C. according to dozens of emails obtained by The Times, all but one of which was sent from Mr. Eisenach\u2019s email address at the American Enterprise Institute. On behalf of the think tank, he sought meetings with F. C. C. commissioners and lawyers to discuss the rules, and briefed the commission\u2019s Republican members on what its general counsel was telling him about Mr. Wheeler\u2019s thinking. Mr. Eisenach offered speaking slots at American Enterprise Institute events to the two Republican members on the commission, urging one to use a January 2015 forum to speak out against the proposed regulations. \u201cNet neutrality is obviously top of mind,\u201d he said in an email to that commissioner, Michael O\u2019Rielly. \u201cI\u2019d be delighted if you would use the opportunity to lay out the case against. \u201d Ms. Stecker, the institute spokeswoman, said it should be no surprise that the opinions of experts like Mr. Eisenach were in demand. The think tank requires scholars to submit an annual report on any \u201coutside activities,\u201d she added, and A. E. I. has \u201cnot as an institution sought to influence or constrain\u201d this work. Other technology companies like Google and Comcast have also underwritten research by think tank scholars, whose findings typically dovetail with the companies\u2019 lobbying agenda. Geoffrey Manne, for example, who runs the   International Center for Law and Economics and is a senior fellow at the   think tank TechFreedom, has frequently written pieces questioning federal antitrust investigations of Google while accepting financial support from the company. While private consulting arrangements can leave scholars\u2019 ties to corporate interests murky, the conflict is more apparent when think tank researchers do double duty as registered lobbyists. C. Stewart Verdery Jr. as a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, one of Washington\u2019s most influential think tanks, hosted a panel of experts in December to discuss a federal program  \u2014   now being expanded  \u2014   that tightens border security by having the American authorities conduct passport checks in foreign airports. Mr. Verdery made clear that he favored the preclearance effort, which speeds the arrival of travelers in the United States. \u201cIt provides unmatched benefits to our security, travel facilitation and passenger convenience,\u201d Mr. Verdery said as he introduced the other speakers, including Howard Eng, the president and chief executive of the Greater Toronto Airports Authority, during an event that was broadcast on  . Mr. Verdery, a former senior official at the Department of Homeland Security whose office helped run the inspection program at foreign airports, briefly mentioned that in addition to his status as a scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, he was the founder of the Monument Policy Group. Left unsaid: Mr. Eng\u2019s airports authority is one of Mr. Verdery\u2019s regular lobbying clients, paying his firm $130, 000 last year to influence the Obama administration and Congress. Officials at the Toronto airport, with Mr. Verdery\u2019s help, have been trying to persuade the American authorities to increase staff and equipment to reduce bottlenecks sometimes created by the preclearance program. Asked whether it was appropriate for a lobbyist to host his clients at a think tank event, Mr. Verdery said, \u201cIt is fairly typical. \u201d Mr. Verdery is not paid by the think tank, he noted. He does benefit from the C. S. I. S. title, however, when laying out a client\u2019s case. As of late last year, at least 70 unpaid senior advisers and associates listed on the think tank\u2019s website had simultaneously worked as consultants. Seven others listed as C. S. I. S. senior advisers or associates during the past five years had worked as registered corporate lobbyists while holding the positions. Officials at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, when asked about Mr. Verdery, said his December presentation should not have occurred. \u201cThis event did not meet our standards of transparency and integrity,\u201d the think tank said in a statement in response to questions. \u201cThis constituted a lapse in oversight from C. S. I. S. \u201d Mr. Verdery is no longer listed among the think tank\u2019s senior associates. Bruce Bartlett, a scholar who has worked at the Cato Institute and the Heritage Foundation, said it was becoming the norm in Washington for lobbyists and consultants like Mr. Verdery to vie for nonresident scholar posts to help them burnish sales pitches to corporate clients. \u201cClients prefer it that way,\u201d Mr. Bartlett said. \u201cThey get a chance to have their work done by scholars. \u201d Christopher Miller, a former policy adviser to Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, has worked as a paid senior visiting fellow on energy and environmental issues at Third Way, a centrist think tank, while also a registered lobbyist for Covanta Energy, which owns    facilities that burn municipal trash. Mr. Miller acknowledged in an interview that his clients could benefit from the work he had done briefing members of Congress on behalf of his think tank. \u201cI don\u2019t think they see any downside,\u201d Mr. Miller said of his corporate clients and the think tank. While Mr. Miller is not well known, he has   company. Within three months of leaving Congress in January 2011, Byron L. Dorgan, a former Democratic senator from North Dakota, had been named a   of government relations and a senior policy adviser for the energy industry lobbying team at the Washington offices at Arent Fox  \u2014   as well as a senior fellow, specializing in energy issues, at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington think tank. Mr. Dorgan did not immediately register as a lobbyist, but his firm has oil and gas industry clients. Using his post at the Bipartisan Policy Center, Mr. Dorgan urged Congress and the Obama administration to do more to promote oil and gas production in the United States. He was often joined by Trent Lott, a former Republican senator from Mississippi and another Bipartisan Policy Center fellow working simultaneously as a lobbyist. Together, they sent letters under think tank letterhead to Congress, and Mr. Dorgan testified before the House Subcommittee on Energy and Power in favor of expanded oil and gas production in the United States. Mr. Dorgan\u2019s most aggressive efforts relate to the National Biodiesel Board, which he has represented as a lobbyist since 2014, earning his firm $240, 000 a year. He has written   pieces, given speeches and set up meetings with top officials at the Environmental Protection Agency on behalf of the biodiesel board, emails obtained by the New England Center for Investigative Reporting show. Mr. Dorgan generally does identify himself as both a think tank scholar and an Arent Fox senior policy adviser representing the biodiesel industry. Asked if his dual role represented a conflict of interest, Mr. Dorgan said that the premise of the Bipartisan Policy Center was \u201cto bring interested parties together to find solutions to difficult problems,\u201d and that he was proud to work there. Mr. Zakheim, of the American Enterprise Institute, is also a lobbyist at Covington  Burling L. L. P. where, on behalf of BAE Systems, he is urging Congress and the Defense Department to increase spending on ground combat vehicles that the company manufactures. Other clients include Northrop Grumman, which is building a new   Air Force bomber. In October, as a \u201cvisiting fellow,\u201d Mr. Zakheim contributed to an   American Enterprise Institute report, \u201cTo Rebuild America\u2019s Military,\u201d which concluded that strengthening the military\u2019s ground forces and land combat vehicles would be an \u201cessential key to deterrence in Europe and success in the greater Middle East. \u201d The report did not mention that Mr. Zakheim was a paid lobbyist. His client, BAE, recently won a contract to supply the vehicles. Some scholars add another twist: They serve on corporate boards directly related to their areas of expertise at think tanks. Dr. McClellan, a former commissioner at the Food and Drug Administration who until January was a senior fellow at Brookings, has been a   expert for the federal government as it debates how to cope with surging costs of prescription drugs. At public events, Dr. McClellan emphasized the extraordinary progress by the pharmaceutical industry in coming up with treatments for diseases like diabetes, H. I. V. and hepatitis C. \u201cLots of diseases have been transformed,\u201d Dr. McClellan said at a hearing in November sponsored by the Department of Health and Human Services. He ran through a series of slides prominently stamped with Brookings\u2019s name. He also argued that even though these drugs were very expensive, they were worth it given the improvement in a patient\u2019s quality of life. \u201cThey are, over all, a pretty good deal,\u201d Dr. McClellan said, referring to treatments for hepatitis C. One such drug, manufactured by Johnson  Johnson, generated $2. 3 billion in sales in its first full year, representing about 7 percent of the company\u2019s overall drug sales in 2014. The pills cost $66, 000 for a standard   regimen. There was no mention in a video of the event that Dr. McClellan joined Johnson  Johnson\u2019s board of directors in October 2013, or that he earned nearly $530, 000 over the past two years in overall compensation from the company. That is in addition to his salary at Brookings, where he is one of the   scholars, with $353, 145 in wages and other compensation from the think tank in 2014, tax records show. Dr. McClellan, in a statement, disputed any suggestion that he might have had a conflict. \u201cMy entire career in academics, government and public policy has focused on   ways to improve health and restrain costs for consumers, and my extensive track record speaks for itself,\u201d he said. Ms. Browner, a former E. P. A. administrator under President Bill Clinton, has traveled to cities around the world  \u2014   including Chicago and Davos, Switzerland  \u2014   where introductions of her included her credential as a distinguished senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. But she is also a member of the leadership council of Nuclear Matters, an   group that pays her to promote nuclear energy. At these stops, she has argued that any solution to climate change must include nuclear energy because it generates power without producing emissions that are blamed for global warming, even though, as an environmentalist, she was once a critic of nuclear power. She said that her change of heart on nuclear power had predated her engagement with Nuclear Matters, and was motivated by her desire to combat climate change, not by payment from the industry. \u201cObviously, the single most important thing any individual has is their reputation,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cI have worked really hard to be forthcoming about what I stand for and believe in. I am who I am. \u201d Ms. Browner has since resigned as a senior fellow at the center, but she remains on the board. Adam S. Posen, the president of the Peterson Institute, considered the world\u2019s   think tank on global economics, has a commanding view of the construction of the new headquarters for the American Enterprise Institute, as well as the main office of Brookings. In his office, he recently had a series of uncomfortable conversations with three scholars he had decided to let go. After much internal debate, Mr. Posen decided to formally prohibit Peterson\u2019s scholars from holding outside jobs that directly related to the field they wrote about on behalf of the think tank. The three who had such outside engagements were terminated. Mr. Posen noted that the change did not imply the researchers had done anything wrong. But tighter rules are needed, he said, to respond to a growing sense he shares with the Peterson board that the think tank industry must reassert its commitment to impartiality. \u201cI live in a glass house,\u201d said Mr. Posen, a   economist who previously served on the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England, gesturing toward the    glass that provides him stunning views. \u201cOur reputation is built on our credibility,\u201d Mr. Posen said. \u201cWithout being perceived as credible and objective, our studies just get thrown on the scrap heap. \u201d The Urban Institute, a   think tank that focuses on issues confronting cities, has decided to require that its scholars with any outside jobs detail the relationship in their writings. \u201cUrban\u2019s greatest asset is its reputation for objective research that is based upon rigorous academic and ethical standards,\u201d the institute\u2019s president, Sarah Rosen Wartell, said in a December memo to her staff. And at Brookings, executives imposed new rules in December requiring that unpaid nonresident scholars use their title from any paying job, not from Brookings, if they testify before Congress. They are also prohibited from using their affiliation with Brookings in any research report they publish under contract with an outside party. \u201cThese are designed to avoid not just conflicts of interests, but the appearance of conflicts of interests,\u201d said Martin S. Indyk, the executive vice president at Brookings. Separately, Brookings terminated its relationship with Mr. Litan in September after he failed to make clear that testimony he provided to a Senate committee last year, based on a study he had done as a private consultant, \u201cleft the false impression that Brookings was connected with the report and the testimony,\u201d Strobe Talbott, the Brookings president, said in a letter explaining the matter. Mr. Eisenach, for reasons he would not specify, said he was no longer working on issues related to net neutrality  \u2014   even though he had taken up the topic on behalf of the American Enterprise Institute as recently as January and published an   report through his consulting firm in February that discussed it. \u201cI\u2019ve moved on to other issues,\u201d Mr. Eisenach said. Such steps are long overdue, said Thomas Medvetz, the author of the 2012 book \u201cThink Tanks in America\u201d and an associate professor of sociology at the University of California, San Diego. \u201cIt has gotten to the point where everyone in Washington has their own expert,\u201d Mr. Medvetz said. \u201cIt is yet another reflection of the tremendous influence of economic power in American politics  \u2014   as with money, you can create your own vehicles of political influence. \u201d Still, not everyone is worried about the multiple roles played by think tank scholars. Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon, oversaw a House hearing on the F. C. C. \u2019s net neutrality rule early last year. Among the evidence he submitted into the congressional record was a Wall Street Journal   article   by Robert M. McDowell, a Hudson Institute scholar who also serves as a telecommunications industry lawyer at a firm retained by ATT to lobby on net neutrality. \u201cEveryone\u2019s got their point of view,\u201d Mr. Walden said in an interview last year. \u201cAnd some of them get paid to have that point of view. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628427.0824182}
