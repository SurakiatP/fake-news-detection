Partisanship was strongly correlated with the poll\u2019s respondents\u2019 responses: 95% of Trump voters said they were more confident in presidential capacity after the election, with 75% of Clinton voters saying they were now less confident. The same question was put to Americans by Gallup following the 1992 and 2000 presidential elections. Five weeks after the 1992 election, 84% of Bill Clinton voters said they were more confident in his presidential capability as opposed to 23% of George H. Bush voters and 37% of Ross Perot voters. In 2000, 85% of George W. Bush voters were more confident in his ability to be president as opposed to 29% of Al Gore voters. H/T Kaitlyn Scallhorn at The Blaze '"}, "time": 1742563408.2726638}
