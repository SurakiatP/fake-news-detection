Political activists discovered a hidden web site for WRCB out of Chattanooga, Tenn. showing election results with Hillary Clinton securing 343 electoral votes and 42% of the popular vote. The web site originated from the FTP server of WorldNow, a media software company that provides real-time data \u2013 such as election results \u2013 and other media assets to local news stations. The activist who found the page pointed out that the results align well with the \u201cfractional vote\u201d method used by voting machines to rig elections to a predetermined outcome. \u201cOn election day, you will see the same percentages overall, with only the numbers that claim to equal them different,\u201d the activist reported. \u201cThe difference in total votes shown on the station pages, with the same overall final percentages proves the election theft is automated to hit desired percentages, no one has to lift a finger during the election itself to accomplish the steal.\u201d Election fraud expert Bev Harris was the first to uncover this method, which is also known as \u201cvote shaving.\u201d \u201cYou need to have votes counted as fractions,\u201d Harris said on The Alex Jones Show Monday. \u201cYou need the votes to be counted with decimal places, like you count money.\u201d \u201cIf a vote is a dollar, you also need to have cents with it. That will not show. It\u2019s hidden.\u201d Vote shaving works by treating votes as decimals rather than whole numbers, which allows the machines to allocate the remaining fractional percentages elsewhere to sway election outcomes. \u201cThere\u2019s this one central computer, which at the end of the day, all the votes come to it,\u201d Harris pointed out. \u201cThat\u2019s where you take it. You don\u2019t run around to 5,000 different precincts. You wait until the votes come to you, and then you have your way with them.\u201d And, interestingly, it appears the majority of the local news stations get their election results from the same software company. Skeptics suggested the WorldNow page was part of a code test to ensure the software would post the actual results, but surprisingly, the data on the page was typed in \u2013 with no apparent code tabulating anything. And it\u2019s revealing that, more often than not, when the mainstream media \u201ctests\u201d election result software, it shows the establishment candidate winning the election. At the very least, the results page shows obvious media bias towards Hillary, and it follows a pattern by the mainstream media to claim Hillary has already won the election weeks before Nov. 8 in an attempt to suppress voter enthusiasm for Trump, which is one of his major advantages. This discovery comes amid Project Veritas\u2019 damning videos exposing Democrat operatives discussing how they\u2019ve been rigging elections for the last 50 years, as well as Wikileaks\u2019 relentless data dumping of John Podesta\u2019s emails revealing more collusion and corruption between the Clinton campaign and the mainstream media.
