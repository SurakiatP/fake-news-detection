November 1, 2016 \\nBruce Thornton is a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the David Horowitz Freedom Center. \\nThe chorus of NeverTrumpers is wailing ever louder as election day and Hillary\u2019s supposed victory approach. After more than a year of complaining about Trump crashing their political soiree, the Republicans attacking Trump still don\u2019t seem to get how their own behavior contributed to the perception that they are out-of-touch elites disdainful of the Republican masses. \\nA recent example comes from premier NeverTrumper Bret Stephens of the Wall Street Journal . In his column Stephens bids farewell to a Republican Party stupid enough to nominate Trump, contrasting it with his imagined Golden Age of Republican policy excellence that Trump and his followers have destroyed. One policy in particular, immigration, reveals the distance between the political and pundit elite and the voting masses that helped make Trump the nominee: \\nAt a 1980 Republican primary debate in Houston, candidates George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan were asked whether the children of illegal immigrants should be allowed to attend public schools for free. Mr. Bush said they should. \u201cWe\u2019re creating a whole society of really honorable, decent, family-loving people that are in violation of the law,\u201d he lamented. \\nReagan agreed. Instead of \u201cputting up a fence,\u201d he asked, \u201cwhy don\u2019t we . . . make it possible for them to come here legally with a work permit, and then, while they\u2019re working and earning here, they pay taxes here.\u201d For good measure, Reagan suggested we should \u201copen the border both ways.\u201d \\nWhere, in the populist fervor to build a wall with Mexico and deport millions of human beings, is that Republican Party today? \\nTake Bush senior\u2019s statement first. It repeats basically the same clich\u00e9s that the bipartisan Gang of Eight recycled in 2013 during their push for Comprehensive Immigration Reform, another euphemism for amnesty. All those hard-working, family-values illegal immigrants are embryonic conservatives, we were told, who just need legal status and social recognition so they can \u201ccome out of the shadows,\u201d as John McCain said, and start voting Republican. The political apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree: son Jeb ended his presidential ambitions by calling illegal immigration an \u201cact of love.\u201d \\nThis stance on illegal immigration by Republican politicos and pundits is obviously light-years from the experience and position of many ordinary people. Take McCain\u2019s oft-repeated trope of \u201cliving in the shadows.\u201d Seriously? Illegal alien young people openly protest on live television, knowing they are not going to be deported. Millions visit emergency rooms for free, and wrangle food stamps, welfare transfers, school lunches, and all sorts of largess, all the while they live protected by \u201csanctuary cities.\u201d And \u201cliving in the shadows\u201d doesn\u2019t deter them from committing felonies, given that even if caught, convicted, and deported, they\u2019ll soon be back. Remember Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, the illegal alien deported five times, who murdered Kate Steinle? Or Angel Gilberto Garcia-Avalos, another five-time deportee who just this month started a $61 million fire in Sequoia National Park? He had just been released from the Kern County Jail, but could not be deported because of California\u2019s lunatic sanctuary city law, which prohibits a sheriff from contacting federal agents. \\nSimply repeating the \u201chard-working, family values, religious\u201d mantra doesn\u2019t address the problems of illegal immigration. There are such illegal immigrants, as I know from over sixty years of personal experience living in the San Joaquin Valley, one of the largest concentrations of illegal aliens in the country. I grew up with Mexican-Americans, they\u2019re members of my immediate family, they\u2019re my friends, students, and colleagues. They\u2019re also the victims of the crimes and disorder caused by our porous border. \\nSome illegals do transition into these sort of immigrants, but many do not. A rigorous vetting process might sort out the wheat from the chaff. But Bush, McCain, and Stephens have not proposed a workable, rigorous mechanism for determining who should stay and who should go. That means with any form of amnesty, citizenship will likely be granted indiscriminately, with only the most egregious felons sifted out, if any are stupid enough to apply for citizenship rather than continuing to \u201clive in the shadows.\u201d But all those guilty of DUIs, hit-and-runs, or defrauding the welfare system with fake IDs will stay\u2013\u2013and then bring their extended families under the provisions of the disastrous 1965 Immigration Act, which enshrined \u201cfamily reunification,\u201d with no limits on relatives of U.S. citizens. \\nEqually tone-deaf is Stephens\u2019s bringing up Ronald Reagan\u2019s \u201copen the border both ways.\u201d That\u2019s exactly what he did in 1986 when he signed the Simpson-Mazzoli Act, which granted amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants, with promises of \u201cborder enforcement\u201d that never materialized. Stephens doesn\u2019t mention that as a result, the number of illegal immigrants increased from about 3 million to 11 million, creating today\u2019s crisis. The obvious lesson is secure the border first, then figure out what to do with the 11 million. It would be governmental malfeasance to repeat Reagan\u2019s mistake. \\nThe problem with politicians and pundits like Stephens is they don\u2019t live with the consequences of indiscriminately letting in people from very different cultures and mores. People like Stephens don\u2019t live daily with the disorder and crime that results. They\u2019re not aware of the extensive damage to quality of life, the illegal immigration version of \u201cbroken windows,\u201d such as dogs without rabies shots running free, health and safety codes ignored, building codes shrugged off, garbage and refuse dumped everywhere, copper wire stolen from pumps and street lights, and chronic petty theft\u2013\u2013and that\u2019s on top of stolen cars, hit-and-runs, driving without insurance, gang-banging, and dealing drugs. \\nAnd if Mr. Stephens thinks I\u2019m just a nativist or xenophobe or racist, I dare him to visit the San Joaquin Valley. Better yet, let him bring his wife and children to live there for a month. Come and tour a hospital emergency room, a Social Security disability office, a public school, a county jail, and then wax lyrical about these \u201chonorable, decent, family-loving people.\u201d It would take just a week for Mr. Stephens to develop a \u201cfervor\u201d for a five-foot high wall around his house, and buy four or five pit bulls and a shotgun. Then again, he wouldn\u2019t last that long. Within a day he\u2019d scurry back to his nice, white, secure tony neighborhood where he doesn\u2019t have to pay the cost of his moral preening. \\nAnd that hypocrisy is where Trump came from. In the perception of millions of voters\u2013\u2013perceptions NeverTrumpers have fed so incessantly that they look a lot like reality\u2013\u2013the conservative politicians and pundits care more about their privileged status and purity of principle than they do about the welfare and interests of their party\u2019s voters. And so they would rather see a venal, perjurious, corrupt mediocrity become Obama 2.0 and continue the progressive destruction of the Constitutional order, than see elected the nominee of their own party. What sort of \u201cprinciple\u201d is that?'"}, "time": 1742561733.0516489}
