The capper came on Monday, when in response to the FBI ending its investigation of Hillary Clintons email transgressions, the Dow magically rallied back to 18,200, a level which had been defended for months by the powers that be\u2026 Continue reading the John Embry interview below\u2026 Advertisement To hear what billionaire Eric Sprott & Rick Rule are doing with their own money and which $7 billion company John Embry & Dr. Marc Faber oversee click on the logo: \\nJohn Embry continues: \u201c Simultaneously gold and silver were viciously attacked, while virtually every other asset category, including oil and copper, which incidentally have terrible fundamentals, rose in price. This represents business as usual as the \u2018Deep State\u2019 pulls out all stops to have their candidate Hillary Clinton elected. \\nI suspect that in the fullness of time Monday will be seen as one of the most ridiculous days in market history, irrespective of who wins the election. The sad fact is that the U.S. problems now run so deep that no president has any ability at this stage to address the situation and bring back the good old days of sustainable growth and containable inflation. I believe that we are going to see rising inflation in conjunction with a steadily weakening economy as the staggering debt load takes its inevitable toll. \\nI laughed when I saw the headlines in the New York Times and the London Financial Times in the wake of last week\u2019s lousy jobs numbers, which incidentally would have been a whole lot worse if they weren\u2019t so heavily doctored. The New York Times headline screamed, \u2018Unemployment Hits 2008 Low, Wages Increase.\u2019 The FT stated, \u2018Wage Data Underlines Solid Jobs Market As Poll Nears.\u2019 These newspapers are now so compromised that they shouldn\u2019t be referred to as newspapers, but rather government propaganda machines. The old Soviet Pravda operation would be green with envy. In reality, U.S. federal government tax withholdings are now falling, giving a much better indication of the true state of the U.S. economy. \\nThe sharp fall in gold and silver on Monday provided yet another excellent buying opportunity. But irrespective of who is the next U.S. president, both metals will be heading sharply higher as financial reality overtakes the present pre-election fantasy. I would echo James Turk\u2019s excellent advice on KWN yesterday when he said, \u2018Own   assets.\u2019 I believe he is dead right, and as I\u2019ve said many times, before this saga is over we are going to witness the greatest wealth transfer in history and one best be on the right side of that transaction.\u201d \\n  As The World Awaits The U.S. Election Outcome, Buckle Up For Some Rough Times  '"}, "time": 1742562249.3594186}
