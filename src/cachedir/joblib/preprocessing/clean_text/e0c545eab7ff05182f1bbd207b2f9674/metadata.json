Steve Scalise ( ) to what he described as an \u201cincreasing intensity of hostility on the left. \u201d  \u201cIt certainly was a shock this morning,\u201d Gingrich said. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us expected today to take this turn. But it\u2019s part of a pattern, as you saw the sign this guy was holding. You\u2019ve had an increasing intensity of hostility on the left. Look, I talk to college students regularly who say to me if they are openly for Trump, they get threatened. \u201d \u201cThe intensity on the left is very real,\u201d he added. \u201cWhether it is somebody, as   comedian, holding up the president\u2019s head in blood or it\u2019s right here in New York City, a play that shows the president being assassinated, or it\u2019s Democratic leading national politicians who are so angry they have to use vulgarity because they can find any common language to talk. This intensity I think has been building since election night. \u201d Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor'"}, "time": 1742563141.393947}
