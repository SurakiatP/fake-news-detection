But the commander, Lt. Gen. Stephen J. Townsend, indicated that an investigation would also examine whether the attack might have set off a larger blast from explosives set by militants inside the building or nearby. It was the fullest acceptance of responsibility by an American commander since the March 17 airstrike. \u201cMy initial assessment is that we probably had a role in these casualties,\u201d said General Townsend, who commands the   task force that is fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. But he asserted that \u201cthe munition that we used should not have collapsed an entire building. \u201d \u201cThat is something we have got to figure out,\u201d he added. With an increase in reports of civilian casualties from the American bombing of Islamic State targets in Iraq and Syria, some human rights groups have questioned whether the rules of engagement have been loosened since President Trump took office. Pentagon officials said this week that the rules had not changed. But General Townsend said on Tuesday that he had won approval for \u201cminor adjustments\u201d to rules for the use of combat power, although he insisted they were not a factor in the Mosul attack. General Townsend acknowledged, however, that steps had been taken to speed up the process of providing air power to support Iraqi troops and their American Special Operations advisers at the leading edge of the offensive to recapture Mosul from the Islamic State. The goal, he said, was to \u201cdecentralize\u201d  . General Townsend did not describe the changes in detail, but he cast them as a return to the military\u2019s standard offensive doctrine, in contrast to the \u201cvery centralized\u201d approach he said was initially put in place after President Barack Obama sent American forces back to Iraq to combat the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. Maj. Gen. Maan   an Iraqi special forces commander, has said that his men called in a coalition airstrike to take out snipers on the roofs of three houses in a Mosul neighborhood called Mosul Jidideh. The Iraqi forces, General Saadi said, were unaware that at least some of the houses were filled with civilians. General Townsend said he did not have information on the Iraqi commander\u2019s specific role, but explained that the United States had been training Iraqi military officers how to call in airstrikes that are carried out by Iraqi aircraft. Any American airstrike requested by the Iraqis, General Townsend said, would need to be approved by American officers. \u201cIf he said his guy was calling for fire, he could have been,\u201d he said. \u201cNow how that works is that they don\u2019t call directly to a U. S. fighter overhead and suddenly a U. S. fighter is rolling in on their grid coordinates. \u201d Iraqi forces have been eager for the help of American air power as they take on the toughest phase of the more than   battle to retake Mosul. American officials have said that 500 Iraqi troops were killed and about 3, 000 wounded in taking the eastern half of the city. General Townsend said the battle for the western half of the city was even more difficult because of what he called its \u201cclaustrophobically close terrain\u201d of narrow streets and buildings. He repeated several times that the    fighting was the most intense urban combat since World War II. Adding to the challenge is a factor he did not mention: the decision by Iraq\u2019s governments to urge Mosul\u2019s residents to shelter in place instead of trying to flee. When American troops retook Falluja in 2004, the fierce urban fighting took place in a city that had already been abandoned by most civilians. Though the Iraqis are doing the main fighting on the ground in Mosul, American and coalition forces have been playing an essential role. United States Army Paladin howitzers have been firing rounds into Mosul from their positions outside the city. Task Force Thor, which is based at Qayyarah West Airfield 40 miles south of Mosul, has been firing Himars   rockets into the city. American Apache attack helicopters have added to the firepower. This year, the United States increased the number of soldiers who have been advising Iraqi troops as they have pushed into the city. While the mission of the advisers is not to directly engage in combat, many are in harm\u2019s way as they advise Iraqi units carrying out the fight. On Monday, American military officials said that two infantry companies from the 82nd Airborne Division were being sent to help protect those United States advisers and that a \u201croute clearance\u201d platoon was also being deployed to clear away roadside bombs. Together, the deployment adds about 240 troops to the mission. The troop cap that the Obama administration established for the operation in Iraq  \u2014   what the Pentagon calls the \u201cforce manning level\u201d \u2014   is 5, 260. But that formal limit, which the Trump administration is likely to eliminate, does not count temporary deployments. The actual number of troops in Iraq is certainly higher. With more American forces in Iraq, and more United States advisers near the front lines, the need for timely airstrikes is much greater. Brig. Gen. Matthew C. Isler, an Air Force officer who serves as deputy to General Townsend, is in charge of the investigation into the Mosul airstrike. A team of American experts has visited the site to collect evidence to determine what caused the significant loss of civilian life. American officials said they were investigating a number of possibilities, including whether the militants herded the civilians into the building to use as human shields whether the building was rigged with explosives or whether a nearby car bomb exploded. \u201cMy initial impression is the enemy had a hand in this, and there\u2019s also a fair chance that our strike had some role in it,\u201d General Townsend said in a briefing broadcast to the Pentagon from Iraq. \u201cI think it\u2019s probably going to play out to be some sort of combination. But you know what, I can\u2019t really say for sure, and we\u2019ve just got to let the investigation play out. \u201d General Townsend said the results of the investigation would be reported publicly, \u201cunlike our enemy. \u201d While General Townsend acknowledged an American role in the Mosul strike, he said the allegations that the United States had bombed a school full of refugees in Syria were not credible. That airstrike, which has garnered considerable attention, occurred during an operation in which   Syrian fighters were trying to seal off the western approaches to Raqqa, the Islamic State\u2019s   capital. But General Townsend said that the evidence he had seen indicated that it was about 30 Islamic State fighters who were killed in that attack. \u201cI think that was a clean strike,\u201d he said. He also dismissed reports, publicized by the Islamic State, that an American airstrike had endangered the Tabqa Dam west of Raqqa, saying that the structure was not in imminent danger. \u201cIf something happens to the Tabqa Dam, it will be at the hands of ISIS, not the coalition,\u201d he said. Still, the reports of desperate civilians in Mosul prompted Zeid Ra\u2019ad   the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, to urge on Tuesday that the   coalition reconsider its tactics. The United Nations has said that at least 61 people were killed in the March 17 strike in Mosul. Amnesty International said as many as 150 might have died. \u201cThe fact that Iraqi authorities repeatedly advised civilians to remain at home, instead of fleeing the area, indicates that coalition forces should have known that these strikes were likely to result in a significant number of civilian casualties,\u201d Donatella Rovera of Amnesty International said in a statement.'"}, "time": 1742562482.8645833}
