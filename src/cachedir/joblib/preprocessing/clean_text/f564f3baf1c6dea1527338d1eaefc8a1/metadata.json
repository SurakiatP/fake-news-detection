Congress has ignored the problem for years. \\nVeterans who had risked their lives received letters stating they would face \"debt collection action\" if they did not re-pay. \\nHow this problem has affected mental health amongst veterans is now under study. \\nMr. Carter is reported already troubled with the \"confusion\" of Syria and now Mosul, as to which group of allies he is supposed to be coordinating. \\nBoth battle scenes, specifically in Aleppo and Mosul, are currently causing \"dizziness\" in Secretary Carter at this time, an ongoing problem. \\n\"I have trouble standing up straight,\" he said yesterday. \\nThis additional veterans\\' problem, finally sinking in to Mr. Carter and the Military Establishment, with the news of this veterans abuse spreading, was \"the last straw\" in his confusion-dizziness problem. \\nA spokesperson for Mr. Carter stated that what with al qaeda, al nusra, ISIS, and other militant groups fighting Assad and supporting the US position, his confusion over Syria keeps growing. \\nThen there\\'s Turkey involved with a lot of bitterness over the Kurds who are effectively fighting ISIS but wanting their own territory in northern Syria. \\nAnd generally the problems in the middle east not only involve the US but Russia, Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Yemen, Israel and who knows who else. \\nTo throw this veterans abuse on top of the overall chaos of US foreign policy has nearly overwhelmed the Secretary. \\nAccordingly, a session in the bowels of an aircraft carrier, with top psychiatrists smoothing the way on top of the noises of aircraft and machinery screaming here and there, will be just the ticket to put the Secretary back to his right mind. \\nHe could also be bunked just below the flight deck if he needs to stay on a day or so as part of his treatment.
