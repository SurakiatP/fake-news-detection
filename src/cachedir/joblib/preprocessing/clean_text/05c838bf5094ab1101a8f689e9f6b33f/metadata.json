Captagon is the addictive drug used by some of the numerous terrorists, jihadis, mercenaries and Western-backed rebels in Syria \u2013 including Al-Nusra and ISIS . Captagon (aka fenethylline, Biocapton or Fitton) was first produced in 1961 as a mix of amphetamine and theophylline. It became illegal in most countries in 1986 due to WHO pressure. Being a stimulant, it fuels feelings of euphoria, fearlessness and power, gives you an energy rush before the crash, and numbs emotions and empathy.These are of course all qualities which are ideal for soldiers who want to kill and not feel the pain. Apparently, captagon is playing a significant role in the Syrian War , both economically and in terms of its mood-altering ability. Multiple drug busts have occurred since 2010. Last year in November 2015, Turkish authorities confiscated 11 million Captagon pills (1800 kg and worth an estimated US$220 million) that were destined for Syria . Last month in October, Lebanese police seized 3.5 million Captagon pills that were headed for Saudi Arabia. Is the drug another avenue by which the Western alliance (NATO-US-UK) is trying to influence and control the outcome of the Syrian War ? Drugs and Soldiers: A Connection Old as Humanity Itself There is long history of tyrants, monarchs, despots, army generals and military leaders feeding drugs to their soldiers to enhance their performance. A very early example is Alexander the Great, whose army relied on the opium poppy plant for its morphine (and from which modern heroin is made). The morphine allowed his soldiers to walk and fight with grave injuries and achieve astonishing feats of endurance. In more recent history, in both world wars, American and German soldiers used amphetamines during battle. Historian Norman Ohler recently released a book \u201cDer totale Rausch\u201d (which literally translates as \u201cTotal Rush\u201d) which exposes the Nazi use of drugs during WWII. This article quotes Norman:\u201c\u2026 the (German) soldiers used Pervitin, a German product patented in 1937 that contains methamphetamine, which is known today as crystal meth. It was freely available as a medicine until 1939. \u201cIn Berlin, it became a drug of choice, like people drink coffee to boost their energy. People took loads of Pervitin, across the board. The company wanted Pervitin to rival Coca Cola. So people took it, it worked and they were euphoric \u2026\u201dThe Nazi rise to power was fueled by their military industrial complex (funded by Americans and Wall St.), including IG Farben , their powerful pharmaceutical conglomerate which was the ancestor of Big Pharma today. Hitler himself was said to be addicted to opiates:\u201cThe first thing I wanted to see were the personal notes of Hitler\u2019s personal physician Dr Theodor Morell \u2013\u2026 these notes were quite elaborate, describing how he treated Hitler over the years, including things like \u201cinjection as always\u201d and \u201cEukodal,\u201d which is a strong opiate.\u201d The opium poppy, source of morphine and heroin, used by Alexander the Great for his soldiers Captagon: The Force Behind Crazed ISIS Fighters Can captagon explain, at least to some degree, the crazed attitude of ISIS fighters? We don\u2019t have definitive proof, but we do have a collation of many anecdotes and quotes indicating that the amphetamine-based drug is a factor. The Washington Post collected these ones:\u201cYou can\u2019t sleep or even close your eyes, forget about it,\u201d said a Lebanese user (featured in this BBC documentary ) \u201cand whatever you take to stop it, nothing can stop it.\u201d\u201cI felt like I own the world high.\u201d\u201cLike I have power nobody has. A really nice feeling.\u201d\u201cThere was no fear anymore after I took Captagon.\u201d\u201cSo the brigade leader came and told us, \u2018this pill gives you energy, try it,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cSo we took it the first time. We felt physically fit. And if there were 10 people in front of you, you could catch them and kill them. \u201cYou\u2019re awake all the time. You don\u2019t have any problems, you don\u2019t even think about sleeping, you don\u2019t think to leave the checkpoint. \u201cIt gives you great courage and power. If the leader told you to go break into a military barracks, I will break in with a brave heart and without any feeling of fear at all \u2014 you\u2019re not even tired.\u201dThe world was first horrified by the cruelty of mercenaries like ISIS who were defiling historic sites and beheading prisoners. Was some of that barbarism due to drug-induced states? Where is the Captagon Being Made? The Cuban based website Prensa Latina released a short article in 2015 claiming that \u201caccording to experts, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) began production of Captagon in 2011 in a laboratory in Bulgaria and it is now manufactured elsewhere in the world. \u201cPart of the profits from the illegal trade in Captagon, experts say, is used to finance armed extremist groups that are trying to overthrow the Syrian government led by President Bashar al-Assad.\u201dThe article, however, does not mention which \u201cexperts\u201d it got its information from. While this fits in with what we know of NATO \u2013 a US-controlled, aggressive military organization which invades sovereign nations like Libya on the flimsiest of pretexts to gain territory and control for the New World Order \u2013 there still needs to be more research done to determine the source of captagon. Other sources suggest it is being produced in Sunni rebel areas. Captivated by Captagon The word captagon, coincidentally, is a mix of the words \u201ccaptivate\u201d and \u201cPentagon\u201d\u2013 interesting given the addictive nature of the drug and the potential US role in providing it. War and drugs have a long history together, whether it be because the soldiers are been fed drugs by their commanders, or because the war itself is being fought over the land and fields that grow the drug-producing plants (Vietnamese and Afghani heroin, Latin American cocaine). In his article CIA Drug Wars Could Explain Why Syrian \u2018Rebels\u2019, ISIS Violence Fuelled by Captagon Pills , journalist Patrick Henningsen writes that:\u201cthe deliberate strategic dispensing of potent narcotics in a paramilitary, insurgency theater \u2026 is a common technique employed by US intelligence agencies \u2026 more often than not, these drugs are the X-factor which fuels the extreme violence we see, and it\u2019s used to terrorize local populations and produces more extreme graphic imagery for western media consumption.\u201cThe result: it aids in the generation of western fear, and public calls for Washington & Co to \u201cstep-up\u201d its military activity in the region \u2013 in order to \u201ckeep us safe\u201d in cozy America. A vicious cycle. Isn\u2019t this what we\u2019ve seen in Syria so far?\u201d By Makia Freeman Dear Friends, HumansAreFree is and will always be free to access and use.
