I had to inject money into it,\u201d Clinton said. She then compared it to the Republican National Committee operation, which under   Chair Reince Priebus had bumped up its tech operation after its 2012 defeat. \u201cSo Trump becomes the nominee and he is basically handed this tried and true, effective foundation,\u201d she added. Her remarks add the DNC to a seemingly endless set of people and groups she blames for her defeat, including Russia, the FBI, misogynists and the New York Times. But some Democrats are pushing back. Former DNC Data Director Andrew Therriault tweeted that Clinton\u2019s accusations are \u201cfucking bullshit. \u201d \u201cDNC data folks: today\u2019s accusations are fucking bullshit, and I hope you understand the good you did despite that nonsense,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cPrivate mode be damned, this is too important,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m not willing to let my people be thrown under the bus without a fight. \u201d Therriault apparently deleted his tweets, but they were published by The Washington Examiner. However, he left up his retweets of tweets by Democratic strategist Tom Bonier  \u2014   who also criticized Clinton\u2019s remarks. One more: Clinton literally inherited some of the most   staffers I\u2019ve seen, who moved from the DNC to Brooklyn after June.  \u2014   Tom Bonier (@tbonier) June 1, 2017,  Therriault and Bonier aren\u2019t the only Democrats upset with Clinton\u2019s remarks. NBC host Andrea Mitchell accused Clinton Wednesday of \u201cdrawing a conspiracy theory\u201d over her claims. Adam Shaw is a politics reporter for Breitbart News based in New York.
