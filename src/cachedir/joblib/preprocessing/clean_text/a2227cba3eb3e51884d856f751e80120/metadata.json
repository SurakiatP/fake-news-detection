Kerry and the new Russia probe special counsel Robert Mueller  \u2014   has just issued a scandalous,     report outlining four decades of   sexual abuse of students by faculty and administrators. [St. Paul\u2019s School in Concord, NH, this week named 13 former faculty and staffers and also listed, without naming them, more than a dozen other former teachers and staffers who allegedly assaulted and raped various male and female students between 1948 and 1988.  The report was signed by Luther Scott Harshbarger, a former attorney general of Massachusetts, and was commissioned by the school\u2019s board of trustees, whose chairman is Archibald Cox. Cox\u2019s father was the late Watergate special counsel who was fired by   Richard Nixon in the   Saturday Night Massacre of 1973. Both Coxs are graduates of the school. Other famous Democrats who have graduated from the posh school with Episcopal roots include Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse ( ) and the late Michael Kennedy, son of Robert F. Kennedy. Jr. Kennedy was accused of having an affair with his family\u2019s    babysitter before dying by skiing into a tree in Aspen in 1997. Other famous St. Paul\u2019s alumni include former NYC Mayor John V. Lindsay and the late TV actor Efrem Zimbalist Jr. The late U. S. Rep. Gerry Studds ( ) the first openly homosexual member of Congress, taught at the school for years before abruptly resigning from the faculty in the early 1970s. A decade later Studds was censured by Congress for having an affair with a    male page after plying him with vodka and cranberry juice while on a foreign trip. Two years ago, a 2014 graduate of the elite prep school was convicted of sexually assaulting a then    female student. Owen Labrie\u2019s appeal for a new trial was recently denied.  Other exclusive New England prep schools have in recent years admitted to decades of   sex scandals, including the Choate School in Wallingford, CT, from which President John F. Kennedy graduated. Last year, Philips Exeter Academy in Exeter, NH, was roiled by a sex scandal involving a former English teacher that came to light after the resignation of the headmaster, who was married to  . now Sen. Maggie Hasson.  But the new St. Paul\u2019s report dwarfs all of the earlier accounts in its volume of detail, which includes accounts from dozens of former students, who are often quoted as describing the school as either \u201cstrange,\u201d \u201ccreepy\u201d or \u201cvery creepy. \u201d During his lifetime, Studds was unapologetic about his behavior with young males, including the    page with whom he had what he described as a \u201cconsensual\u201d relationship. Studds was censured in the House by a vote of   after reading a statement defending his conduct with his back turned to his Congressional colleagues. A heterosexual Republican from downstate Illinois censured at the same time quickly resigned from Congress in shame. But Studds adamantly refused to quit and was subsequently reelected by his Massachusetts constituents. He died in 2006. One, Faculty 20, who taught there in \u201cthe late 1960\u2019s,\u201d once \u201cmolested\u201d a male student in the front seat of his car and also reportedly held \u201cdorm meetings in the nude with \u2018all of the boys\u2019 also nude in his   apartment. \u201d Another predatory homosexual teacher \u201cin the late 1960\u2019s and early 1970\u2019s\u201d was called Faculty 23. According to one account, an alumnus only identified as \u201cStudent 69\u201d reported that this gay teacher \u201cwas in another male student\u2019s dorm room and rubbed Vaseline on the student\u2019s testicles. The male student was offended and requested that Faculty 23 stop. Faculty 23 allegedly threatened the student and said, \u2018You can\u2019t tell me what to do, I\u2019m a teacher. \u2019\u201d St. Paul\u2019s often wrote glowing recommendations for the faculty perverts it wanted to get rid of. In one case listed in the report, one of the former teachers dismissed for \u201cboundary issues with boys\u201d was later fired from his new school for \u201cinappropriate relationships\u201d with his new male charges. A former vice rector at the school recalled getting a phone call from an administrator at the new school asking why St. Paul\u2019s hadn\u2019t accurately informed them of the educator\u2019s record. The St. Paul\u2019s administrator said he replied, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you contact us about him?\u201d \u201cWe didn\u2019t check his references,\u201d the administrator said, \u201cbecause he was coming from St. Paul\u2019s. \u201d Howie Carr is a New York Times   author of Kennedy Babylon: A Century of Scandal and Depravity and a   talk radio host.
