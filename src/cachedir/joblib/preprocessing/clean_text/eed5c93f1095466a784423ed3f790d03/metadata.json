The Indonesian government believes the Islamic State was responsible. [The attack was carried out in the Kampung Melayu area of Indonesia\u2019s capital by a pair of suicide bombers who detonated themselves about five minutes apart, according to Reuters.  The New York Times noted that the large police presence at the bus station was due to a parade, part of Jakarta\u2019s festivities leading up to the beginning of the Muslim holiday of Ramadan on Saturday. Another possible factor in the timing of the attack was the formal resignation of Jakarta governor Basuki \u201cAhok\u201d Tjahaja Purnama, a Christian of Chinese heritage who is currently serving a   jail sentence for blasphemy against Islam. Ahok\u2019s trial and conviction inflamed both racial and religious tensions. He abandoned his appeal against the blasphemy sentence on Tuesday and resigned his office on Wednesday. In addition to the Ramadan parade, the New York Times noted that \u201cthousands of   Muslims\u201d celebrated the governor\u2019s resignation on the streets in the hours leading up to the suicide bomb attack. Another theory, advanced on Indonesian television by National Police spokesman Awi Setyono, is that Indonesian extremists might have been \u201ctriggered\u201d by the ongoing clash between ISIS forces and the government of the Philippines, and by the bombing of the Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England. \u201cThese victims are known to us. They are police. They are bus drivers. They are motorcycle taxi drivers and grocers. I have ordered the police to hunt the terrorists and get to the root of this attack,\u201d declared Indonesian President Joko Widodo. Widodo advised citizens to \u201ckeep calm and keep cool\u201d because \u201cwe Muslims are preparing to enter the month of Ramadan for fasting. \u201d He ordered police to \u201cthoroughly investigate the networks of the perpetrators and hunt them to the roots. \u201d Although no group has made a formal claim of responsibility, ISIS involvement is suspected by both Indonesian officials and analysts. \u201cThe Islamic State remains the main driver of attacks in Indonesia, and the threat posed by militants linked to the group is likely to escalate in the country,\u201d Jane\u2019s Terrorism and Insurgency Center analyst Otso Iho told CNN. Iho noted that \u201cexperienced militants\u201d who fought for ISIS in Iraq and Syria are returning to their home countries, increasing the threat level dramatically. Only a few hundred Indonesians are believed to have traveled to the \u201ccaliphate\u201d to fight for ISIS, but the terror state\u2019s recruiting efforts in the world\u2019s largest Muslim nation have been disturbingly effective with potential homegrown operatives. Indonesian police said the weapons appeared to be   bombs carried in backpacks. A police inspector said that \u201caluminum, nails, buckshot, and receipts for purchasing rice cookers\u201d were found at the scene of the attack. The Associated Press reports that Indonesian   squads raided two houses believed to be owned by the bombers, identified as Ichwanul Nurul Salam, 40, and Ahmad Sukri, 32. Several of their relatives were also taken in for \u201cquestioning and DNA tests,\u201d according to the chief of the   squad. Salam\u2019s wife reportedly told investigators that the bombs were assembled by another militant known as \u201cAgus,\u201d who is now sought by police and considered \u201cat large and dangerous. \u201d A similar bomb, also believed to have been designed by Agus, was detonated in February by a member of an Indonesian extremist network called Jemaah Anshorut Daulah that has pledged allegiance to ISIS.'"}, "time": 1742564623.4805925}
