Mrs. May, who wants to start the formal process of leaving the bloc by the end of March, now has a serious fight on her hands, after several months of facing relatively little challenge over her plans for British withdrawal, known as \u201cBrexit. \u201d Judges on Britain\u2019s High Court ruled last week that she could not start exit negotiations by invoking Article 50 of the European Union\u2019s treaty without first consulting Parliament, where the government\u2019s majority is slim. The government is appealing the case to the Supreme Court, but if it loses, and then finds itself constrained by lawmakers, the temptation to seek an early general election may become overwhelming for Mrs. May. For now, the government is playing down that prospect. Mrs. May insisted on Sunday that she had a mandate to pursue Britain\u2019s exit without consulting Parliament. In a referendum in June, about 52 percent of voters elected to quit the bloc. \u201cThe British people, the majority of the British people, voted to leave the European Union,\u201d Mrs. May said at Heathrow Airport as she left for a trade mission to India. \u201cThe government is now getting on with that. \u201d After the court ruling, however, Mrs. May now knows there is a good chance that she may not be able to do so with the free hand that she wants. So far she has specified almost no detail about her objectives, arguing that she wants to keep her negotiating position as strong as possible. At the heart of the dispute lies an ambiguity inherent in a referendum that asked voters to say whether they wanted to quit the European Union but that did not seek their views on what relationship should replace it. Supporters of Brexit contend that opponents now want to thwart the will of the people as expressed in the referendum. Critics fear that the government has no coherent Brexit strategy, and worry that the country may lurch into a damaging economic rupture with the bloc, which voters did not endorse. On Sunday, Gina Miller, the founder of an investment management firm who was the lead claimant in the legal case against the government, told the BBC that Mrs. May must take the decision to Parliament \u201cbecause we do not live in a   dictatorship. \u201d Ms. Miller said she had faced online death and rape threats over the case. Nigel Farage, the interim leader of the U. K. Independence Party, which campaigned for British withdrawal, warned of protests in the streets if the decision in favor of Brexit was ignored. \u201cBelieve you me, if the people in this country think they\u2019re going to be cheated, they\u2019re going to be betrayed, then we will see political anger the likes of which none of us in our lifetimes have ever witnessed in this country,\u201d he said. The court ruling has unleashed an ugly political discourse, with one tabloid newspaper that supported Brexit describing the judges who delivered the verdict as \u201cEnemies of the People. \u201d While the government has said it defends the independence of the judiciary, it has not rushed to condemn the newspaper coverage, prompting criticism from some senior legal figures. More worrisome for Mrs. May is the parliamentary math should she be forced to take her case for British withdrawal to lawmakers. Last week, David Davis, the secretary of state for exiting the European Union, conceded that if the appeal to the Supreme Court failed, the government would probably have to put forward legislation to trigger Article 50. That could give opponents the possibility to amend it, and tie down its negotiating stance. In an interview with The Sunday Mirror, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, said he would push for Mrs. May to adopt his \u201cBrexit bottom lines. \u201d \u201cWe are not challenging the referendum,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not calling for a second referendum. We\u2019re calling for market access for British industry to Europe. \u201d The party\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, took a more lenient position. He told the BBC that Labour was \u201cnot going to hold this up,\u201d and that \u201cArticle 50 will be triggered when it comes to Westminster. \u201d Asked about the possibility of a general election, the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, told the BBC on Sunday that it was \u201cthe last thing the government wants\u201d  \u2014   a formulation that does not specifically exclude it happening.'"}, "time": 1742563891.5694215}
