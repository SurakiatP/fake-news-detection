News of his departure comes after months of speculation. On Sunday, Mr. Osgood, who is 83, used a part of the \u201cSunday Morning\u201d broadcast to tell his viewers that the rumors were true. \u201cFor years now, people, even friends and family, have been asking me why I keep doing this, considering my age,\u201d Mr. Osgood said. \u201cI am pushing 84. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s been a joy doing it. \u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s been a great run, but after nearly 50 years at CBS, including the last 22 years here on \u2018Sunday Morning,\u2019 the time has come, and a date is set for me to do my farewell \u2018Sunday Morning. \u2019\u201d The farewell broadcast will be on Sept. 25. Since he joined the network in 1971, Mr. Osgood had been a reporter and anchor for every broadcast on CBS, according to the network. He took over \u201cSunday Morning\u201d from Charles Kuralt in 1994. His comforting, almost folksy approach to the news (and trademark bow ties) quickly eliminated any early doubts that he could successfully replace Mr. Kuralt, who had spent 15 years developing the show. With Mr. Osgood in the anchor chair, the program has won three daytime Emmys for outstanding morning program. His voice, velvety and gravelly at once, made him well known to radio, television and movie listeners. In 2008, he was the narrator of the animated film \u201cHorton Hears a Who!\u201d \u201cCharles Osgood has one of the most distinctive voices in broadcasting, guiding each broadcast, making sure the words were just right and being a calming, reassuring presence to our viewers,\u201d David Rhodes, president of CBS News, said in a statement. \u201cHis impeccable commitment to quality inspires all of us at CBS News. \u201d On Sunday, Mr. Osgood assured viewers that they could still find him on the radio. He will contribute to his   program \u201cThe Osgood File,\u201d where he has been known to read vignettes and poems about the day\u2019s news. He ended his farewell announcement by singing a folk song, written by Woody Guthrie, to his viewers: \u201cSo long, it\u2019s been good to know   long it\u2019s been good to know   long it\u2019s been good to know   long time since I\u2019ve been   I\u2019ve got to be drifting along. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563918.8030457}
