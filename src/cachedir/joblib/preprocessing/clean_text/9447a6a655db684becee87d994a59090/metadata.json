[Without citing any hard evidence that the team won\u2019t be supported \u2014  like organized protests or decline in ticket sales \u2014  Wilder instead provides some anecdotal stories about some liberal friends not being able to enjoy the games because they were upset with Trump\u2019s message. She also says Brady\u2019s facebook page was inundated by negative remarks from alleged fans.   But Wilder doesn\u2019t really make a very good case that the fans will be bailing on Tommy and the boys. Significantly, she fails to point out that Boston Red Sox fans didn\u2019t have any problems supporting conservative pitcher Curt Schilling when their team, which sits in the hub of New England\u2019s liberal leaning swath of America, helped upend the   curse of the Bambino by sweeping the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2004 World Series. Now Wilder contends that although Pats fans never lost faith and were able to endure   and   \u201crecently, that blind faith has faced its greatest test in the form of the team\u2019s connection to Republican   Donald Trump. \u201d Wilder, who hails from Lincoln Mass where 77. 7 % of the population voted for the failed   ticket, argues, \u201cThe trouble began when Patriots reporters spotted Brady with a Make America Great Again hat in his locker in Foxboro in the fall of 2015. \u201d Wilder points out that the New England legend donned the hat \u201csoon after Trump announced his candidacy and called Mexicans rapists in the same speech. \u201d Wilder\u2019s bias intentionally mischaracterizes Trump\u2019s comment. As Breitbart News reported in June, Trump was not referring to all Mexicans as Wilder implies but \u201cwas referring to illegal aliens coming over the U. S.  border who commit additional crimes, such as rape. \u201d  Wilder demonstrates that she\u2019s the one with the Trump problem when she calls the    \u201cone of the most divisive and   figures in the history of American politics.\u2019  When Brady said back in 2015 that it would be \u201cgreat\u201d if his \u201cfriend\u201d Trump won the election, and Trump responded by saying \u201cTom Brady is a great friend of mine. He\u2019s a winner and he likes winners,\u201d Wilder claims that shock permeated the internet. Brady never went on record saying who he actually voted for. The SB Nation writer goes on to characterize the man who will be President of the United States on January 20th as one who ran \u201cwith the most   (and racist, misogynistic,   Islamaphobic, etc.) rhetoric. \u201d  To support her case that the Patriots have a \u201cTrump Problem,\u201d the author cites a story that her mom told her about one of her friends, who once was a   fan but can no longer watch Pats games. Wilder\u2019s mom said, \u201cShe used to watch every Sunday with her family, and now she just can\u2019t do it. \u201d Wilder called the friend soon after she was told the story and asked her if she can no longer support the team. \u201cYeah, I just will not watch,\u201d Susan Pease said:  I really enjoy watching the game with my family. I like what it means for my family to sit down and talk and laugh and watch and snack and now   \u2026     I just, it\u2019s just ruined for me. It\u2019s not the worst thing about this, of course  \u2014   this whole thing stems from my tremendous disappointment over this election and country. But it will forever color my opinion of the team. I will not watch, I will not buy any more jerseys. I\u2019m done. But Pease is not alone,  Wilders claims \u201cat least 6\u201d other people she knows can\u2019t watch the games either. I\u2019m sure that will make a big dent in the ratings for the playoff game at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, where the Patriots will host the Houston Texans in the NFL Divisional Round on Saturday.
