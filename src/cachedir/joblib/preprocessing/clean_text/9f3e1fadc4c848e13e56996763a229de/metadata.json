The owner of the club, Jonathan Paiz, said Brodie got his nickname because he would \u201ccrush\u201d it when at bat. \u201cBasically he would get up there and hit the ball hard,\u201d Mr. Paiz said in a telephone interview. Brodie and his father, Sean Copeland, 51, were two of the victims of the attack, which killed at least 82 others, including nine other children and teenagers, and wounded 202 people. Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, noting that the attack occurred less than a year after the attacks in and around Paris, said that for the second time in nine months, the French flag was being flown over the Texas Governor\u2019s Mansion in remembrance. \u201cWhile every heinous attack like this is tragic,\u201d he said in a statement, \u201cthis latest one hits close to home. \u201d The Copelands were the only two Americans who had been confirmed dead as of Friday night. Three students from the University of California, Berkeley, were among the wounded, according to a statement issued Friday by the university. Two of the students, Vladyslav Kostiuk, 23, and Diane Huang, 20, were discharged after medical treatment and returned to their summer dormitories in Nice, the university said. Daryus Medora, 21, whose leg was broken, remained in the hospital. A fourth student, Nicolas Leslie, 20, was unaccounted for on Friday. They were among 85 students who were on a study abroad program with the university. The Copeland family lives in Lakeway, Tex. near Austin. They were on a vacation that began in Pamplona and Barcelona, Spain, before moving on to southern France. Mr. Copeland was traveling with his wife, Kim, whose 40th birthday celebration on Monday was part of the reason they went on the trip. In addition to Brodie, Mr. Copeland\u2019s other children, his son Austin, 22, and daughter, Maegan, 29, from a previous marriage accompanied them, said Jess Davis, a family representative. On Friday in Lakeway, an affluent Hill Country community, many neighbors of the Copelands were stunned that an act of violence in Europe could reach thousands of miles across the Atlantic to invade their peaceful town. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking for everybody,\u201d said Dianne Wood, who lives a few houses up the street from the Copelands and knows the family well. \u201cThe Copelands are a sweet family, and we just want to respect their privacy. \u201d She described Brodie Copeland as \u201can incredible boy  \u2014   so much life, so much personality. \u201d Coleen Serfoss, Brodie\u2019s   teacher, remembered him as a \u201csuperstar\u201d who stood out in class, on the baseball field and on stage. He aspired to become an actor and had performed in   productions of \u201cCinderella\u201d and \u201cPeter Pan. \u201d He was also in the school\u2019s honor choir. As they said their goodbyes on the last day of class, Ms. Serfoss recalled, she told Brodie, \u201cWhen you get your Academy Award, I hope you remember me. \u201d Her principal called her Thursday night to tell her that Brodie had died. \u201cWhen I woke up, I was hoping it was a dream until I turned the TV on,\u201d she said at a news conference outside Lakeway Elementary School. Grief over Brodie\u2019s death was palpable among Lakeway teachers. \u201cHe was just a very sweet, kind young man,\u201d said Joy Crenshaw, a   teacher who often saw Brodie in the school cafeteria. \u201cHe always had a smile on his face. \u201d A tribute to the father and son was set up on the Facebook page of the Hill Country team, where Brodie had been playing baseball since 2014. It shows Brodie frolicking in the French Riviera waters. \u201cImmediately, he made an impact on all of the coaches at HC,\u201d said a   page set up by Mr. Paiz, the baseball club\u2019s owner. Mr. Copeland worked at Lexmark, the printing and software company, which issued a statement after his death: \u201cSean was not only a terrific leader in the company, but a phenomenal person who will be dearly missed. Our hearts go out to Sean and his family, and for everyone who is suffering in France and elsewhere from this senseless violent act. \u201d Two of Mr. Copeland\u2019s brothers are set to fly to Nice with the State Department to pick up the family and bring everyone home, according to a statement provided by Ms. Davis. The baseball group\u2019s Facebook page became a forum for remembrance and mourning. \u201cNo words can describe how we feel,\u201d wrote Jeff Petry. \u201cSean and Brodie touched our lives in so many ways. Such a good man and a great kid and teammate. \u201d \u201cWe will miss you #8,\u201d wrote another man, Bill Bishop, referring to Brodie\u2019s jersey number. \u201cYou will be missed but we know you were needed for bigger and better things. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628333.7030988}
