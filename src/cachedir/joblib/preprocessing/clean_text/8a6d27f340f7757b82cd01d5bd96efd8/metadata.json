Trump, aided by two teleprompters, presented the version of himself on Tuesday evening that Republican Party officials had desperately craved  \u2014   softer, serious and sophisticated. \u201cI understand the responsibility of carrying the mantle and I will never ever let you down,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a speech at his golf club here. \u201cI will make you proud of your party and our movement. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s disciplined performance was geared at soothing nervous voters and at stopping the flight of   Republicans. And it came just hours after Mr. Trump reminded them why they had been concerned in the first place. A series of missteps and vicious attacks  \u2014   with targets that included former rivals, entire nationalities and religious groups  \u2014   has led to fears that Mr. Trump has doomed Republican chances of taking back the White House and keeping the party\u2019s hold on the Senate. It was the type of calm performance that Mr. Trump has delivered before, only to revert to form within days. \u201cTonight\u2019s speech doesn\u2019t change much,\u201d said Dan Senor, who supported Senator Marco Rubio of Florida in the primaries and who has been an adviser to Speaker Paul D. Ryan. \u201cEven tonight, there are conversations that maybe, just maybe, he says these offensive things because he actually believes them. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s challenges culminated in a series of destructive episodes over the last two weeks: He insinuated that the federal judge presiding over a lawsuit against Trump University was biased against him because of the judge\u2019s Mexican heritage he belittled members of his staff on a conference call and he left his aides scrambling  \u2014   yet again  \u2014   to impose discipline on an operation characterized for months by its chaotic, freewheeling ethos. On Tuesday, after Mr. Ryan said the remarks about the judge were \u201cracist,\u201d Mr. Trump released a statement saying, \u201cI do not feel that one\u2019s heritage makes them incapable of being impartial. \u201d But he did not apologize, as many Republican leaders had asked him to do. Mr. Ryan maintained his endorsement of Mr. Trump, but Senator Mark S. Kirk of Illinois withdrew his. And Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who never publicly endorsed Mr. Trump, urged Republicans who had endorsed the candidate to withdraw their support. On Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump tweeted tauntingly at MSNBC host Joe Scarborough after he said Mr. Trump was \u201cacting like a racist. \u201d His top policy adviser, Sam Clovis, told a Republican group in Iowa that the judge in the Trump University case belongs to an \u201c \u201d Hispanic group, according to The Des Moines Register. \u201cThey are waiting for him to change, and he is not going to change,\u201d Vin Weber, a former Republican congressman from Minnesota who supported Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio in the primaries, said on Tuesday. \u201cThis is like the old story of the scorpion and the frog  \u2014   the Republican Party is the frog and Donald Trump is the scorpion, and we want these assurances he\u2019s going to stop doing these things but he can\u2019t, because it\u2019s in his nature. \u201d Tim Pawlenty, a Republican and the former governor of Minnesota, was not quite as pessimistic, saying he still had \u201chope for at least some improvement. \u201d \u201cEven modest changes would help,\u201d he said. Though Mr. Trump vanquished a legion of primary opponents without much change in demeanor or strategy, he is entering a race in which he is trailing in polls. His support among   suburban voters in battleground states is especially low, according to polling conducted by Republican groups. Aides are discussing ways to keep Mr. Trump focused during the next few weeks. Among the options is deploying his three oldest children, who have urged him in the past to act \u201cmore presidential,\u201d as well as his    Jared Kushner, to travel with him in a rotation. At the same time, the Trump operation is relying on the Republican National Committee, as well as on several \u201csuper PACs\u201d that support him, to handle tasks typically overseen by a presidential campaign. But the party has had its own defections because of Mr. Trump, including by the woman who led efforts for Hispanic media outreach and who is said to have told colleagues she could not stomach defending him on television. The Trump campaign is also working to ramp up its   operations, with the candidate holding at least four events this week. On Thursday, 70 donors are to meet at Trump Tower in New York, followed by lunch at the Four Seasons hotel. Mr. Trump is expected to attend both the meeting and the lunch. And on Friday evening, Mr. Trump is to attend a   in Richmond, Va. though the invitation that went out just over a week before the event did not specify where it would be held. It also did not have host names, tiers of donors or even a request for a specific dollar amount  \u2014   all basics of most political  . Mr. Trump has complicated matters by resisting efforts to engage in routine telephone calls to donors and to make gentle requests of people to write checks. Some donors who have been approached have given tepid responses, worried about their names showing up in a public   filing. Some aides have also grumbled privately about a trip Mr. Trump has planned for the end of the month to Scotland and Ireland, to tour his golf courses. Three aides, speaking anonymously to discuss internal frustrations, said they worried that the trip would distract him from his campaign. The team has spent weeks working on hiring new members of staff, including  Jim Murphy, a longtime Republican operative, as the national political director. Mr. Murphy\u2019s predecessor lasted six weeks in the job. The Trump team has had trouble filling positions, in part because some Republicans they tried to recruit turned down their offers, worried about how a Trump line on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 could affect their job prospects. The campaign has spent two months searching for a communications director, after an early prospect fell through, according to one of the three aides and two people who were approached about possible jobs. Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, said that the candidate was always planning for a progression. \u201cThe campaign evolves, as it always does, from a primary strategy to a   strategy, and there are very different issues,\u201d Mr. Lewandowski said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to refocus on jobs and the economy. \u201d Mr. Trump made clear on Monday that regardless of his campaign staff members\u2019 job titles, he was his own chief strategist. On a conference call first reported by Bloomberg Politics, Mr. Trump belittled his aides for having sent a memo urging surrogates to stop talking about the judge in the Trump University case. Instead, Mr. Trump said, his supporters should keep criticizing the jurist, Gonzalo P. Curiel, and should suggest the reporters asking questions about his comments are \u201cracists. \u201d Ben Carson, a former 2016 hopeful now supporting Mr. Trump, said party leaders and voters should not expect a different version of Mr. Trump for the general election. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to change somebody,\u201d he said. Mr. Carson said he believed that Mr. Trump could be perfectly suited for the moment. \u201cWe\u2019re in more of a W. W. E. brawl stage as a nation right now,\u201d Mr. Carson said, referring to World Wrestling Entertainment, \u201cand the people who tend to appeal to that group tend to do better. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628535.1005428}
