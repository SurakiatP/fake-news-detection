And Sirota is a busy lad\u2013 \\n\u201cHow Donald Trump Used Fine Print To Make It Harder To Sue Wall Street For Fraud\u201d [David Sirota, International Business Times ]. In Links this morning, but amplifying: \\nAccording to hundreds of pages of court documents reviewed by International Business Times, Trump notched a victory for himself and the financial industry by convincing judges that his own fine print warnings meant he had not deceived investors when he lured them to bet \u2014 and ultimately lose \u2014 hundreds of millions of dollars on one of his riskiest development projects. The real estate mogul known for his litigiousness helped Corporate America secure a ruling making it harder for investors to file lawsuits. Unlike his other past business moves that appeared to affect only Trump\u2019s business partners, vendors and customers, this Trump case helped set a court precedent that was soon codified into law. \\nTrump, in essence, argued \u201cit\u2019s my nature\u201d: \\nTrump did not explicitly challenge the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that his prospectus contained misleading or inaccurate information. Instead, his lawyer argued that \u201cthe cautionary language in this prospectus was so complete, so repetitive, so obvious and so well designed\u201d that it could not have misled investors. The court concurred. \\n\u201cLet\u2019s set aside Hillary Clinton as an individual and consider her as the perfection of a corrupt political system. As I noted yesterday, Politics As Usual Is Dead, and Hillary Clinton is the ultimate product of the political system that is disintegrating before our eyes\u201d [ Of Two Minds ]. \u201cAll the Clintons did is assemble the parts more effectively than anyone else. Now that the machine has scooped up hundreds of millions of dollars in \u2018contributions\u2019 and other loot, vested interests and corrupted loyalists within the federal government will do anything to protect the machine and its vast flow of funds.\u201d Which is why Clinton\u2019s public promises on policy are meaningless; we don\u2019t know who her silent partners are. And that ties rather neatly into her incrementalism, which she frames as \u201cI don\u2019t want to promise what I can\u2019t deliver\u201d (but to whom were the promises really made?) More: \u201cCobble together a multi-million dollar private foundation, millions of dollars in speaking fees from big-money contributors, conflicts of interest, the secrecy of private email servers, pay-to-play schemes and corrupted loyalists planted in the Department of Justice, and the inevitable result is a politics as usual money-harvesting machine that lays waste to the nation, supporters and critics alike.\u201d \\nThe Voters \\n\u201cThe Daily 202: College-educated white women are Hillary Clinton\u2019s firewall\u201d [ WaPo ]. \u201cIf the Republican nominee was anywhere close to Romney\u2019s 52 percent support level among this traditionally Republican-leaning constituency, he would likely win the election.\u201d From what I read on the Twitter \u2014 admittedly an idiosyncratic sample \u2014 Clinton\u2019s previous firewall feels like she used and abandoned them. So\u2026 \\n\u201cThe End of Black-Checking for Hillary\u201d [ Progressive Army ]. \u201cMichelle Alexander [author of The New Jim Crow went on MSNBC with Chris Hayes to discuss her concerns about the Clintons. She spoke her truth, our truth. Many in America turned on her. They lined up to tell her she was wrong about the very same things we applauded just a year ago.\u201d Predictably, the Democrat nomenklatura went nuts. One Kossack: And now Michelle Alexander comes to lecture other black folks abt voting for Hillary. Ugh what an awful show from Hayes tonight. Just awful. \\n&mdash; Armando (@armandodkos) April 2, 2016 \\n(I think \u201cblack folks\u201d is a particularly nice touch.) The writer concludes: \u201cThrowing Michelle Alexander to the wolves to defend the Clintons, of all couples, was far too much for me.\u201d \\n\u201cBlack voters sue North Carolina over last-minute purges\u201d [ Bloomberg ]. In a last-minute lawsuit. As I keep saying, if the Democrats saw voter registration as a core party function, we wouldn\u2019t be seeing shenanigains like this in the first place. \\n\u201cIdentity and the Election: How Groups of Voters Have Changed Their Minds\u201d [ Bloomberg ]. Here is a breakdown of Clinton\u2019s margin before and after the Comey bombshell: \\nClinton support among white college voters increased the most . I suppose they actually bought the idea that Comey, like Trump, is a Russian agent of influence? Who are the \u201cstupid\u201d voters now, pray tell? \\nPolicy \\n\u201cMemo to the Next President: Avoid the \u2018Vision Thing\u2019 in the Mideast\u201d [ Foreign Policy ]. Internal disagreements in The Blob! And \u201cold-fashioned GOP realism\u201d looks pretty good compared to crazypants neo-con adventurism (or Clinton\u2019s debacle in Libya). \\n\u201cMarijuana ballot initiatives 2016: Five more states may make pot legal\u201d [ Yahoo News ]. \u201cThe vote to watch is in California, where polls suggest the \u201cAdult Use of Marijuana\u201d referendum has a substantial lead.\u201d I just hope marijuana doesn\u2019t go corporate\u2026 \\n\u201cYounger voters overwhelmingly favor marijuana measure, which is likely to pass, poll finds\u201d [ Los Angeles Times ]. \\nDownballot \\n\u201cDemocrats have a good chance to take control of the Senate just two years after losing it. A friendly map with seven Republican-held seats in states President Obama won has opened the door, and now Republicans are hoping Donald Trump doesn\u2019t drag them down in the many tough states they have to defend\u201d [ WaPo ]. Thing is, if you look at the chart, \u201c50\u201d is smack dab in middle of \u201ctoss-up.\u201d RCP agrees , with 46 Democrats, 46 Republicans, and 8 toss-ups. These are RCP\u2019s toss-ups: PA: Toomey (R), IN: Open (R), WI: Johnson (R), NV: Open (D), MO: Blunt (R), NH: Ayotte (R), FL: Rubio (R), NC: Burr (R). Note that WI, NH, FL, and NC are swing states, too! \\nThe Trail \\n\u201c\u2018We\u2019ve got to be nice and cool, nice and calm. All right, stay on point Donald, stay on point,\u2019 Trump said in Pensacola, Fla\u201d [ CNN ]. \u201c\u2018No sidetracks, Donald. Nice and easy,\u2019 Trump said.\u201d So Conway is doing her job. \\n\u201cPut another way, as Clinton has focused her time and money primarily on swing and Republican-leaning states, the question looming over her campaign is whether she has left herself open to a flanking maneuver from Trump in any of the seemingly safe Democratic states that he is now targeting\u2014key among them Colorado, Michigan, and Wisconsin\u201d [Ron Brownstein, The Atlantic ]. \u201cClinton and her allies are responding with a new wave of advertising and more surrogate appearances in those blue-leaning states, and most dramatically, a visit by Clinton herself to Detroit on Friday. But overall they see Trump\u2019s late push into these Democratic-leaning places as a sign of weakness, not strength\u2014an admission that at this late date he needs new options for reaching an Electoral College majority because he cannot feel secure of capturing enough of the states both sides consider true battlegrounds.\u201d \\n\u201cA tightening race nationally has also translated into tightening at the state level. States that were trending Trump\u2019s way in September started to slip away from him in early October. Now, with the focus more on Clinton\u2019s emails than on Trump\u2019s debate performances or his Twitter spats, states like Iowa and Ohio are moving back in Trump\u2019s direction\u201d [ Cook Political Report ]. Republicans \u201ccoming home.\u201d \\n\u201cTwo things to look for in the exits: First, how is Mr. Trump doing among white voters? His strategy requires grabbing a higher percentage of whites than Mitt Romney\u2019s 59% and boosting their share of the turnout above 2012\u2019s 72%. College-educated whites traditionally vote Republican, but Mr. Trump has struggled with them. Will he match Mr. Romney\u2019s 51% among all college grads?\u201d [Karl Rove, Wall Street Journal , \u201cWhat to Watch for on Election Night\u201d]. \u201cSecond, how is Mrs. Clinton doing among minorities and millennials? Her strategy calls for replicating President Obama\u2019s 2012 coalition. That year African-Americans were 13% of turnout, and 93% went for Mr. Obama; Hispanics were 10% of turnout, and 71% voted for him; and millennials were 19% of turnout, 60% of whom supported the president.\u201d \\n\u201cOnly voters in six states: Connecticut, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New York, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are allowed to void their early or absentee ballots and cast a new vote\u201d [ Daily Dot ]. \\nDemocrat Email Hairball \\n\u201cHere\u2019s the updated list of all Podesta docs published by @WikiLeaks that have been proven, or claimed, to be fake\u201d [ Glenn Greenwald ]. \\nStats Watch \\nBig stats day today! Incidentally, I quote Econoday first, but \u2014 and this is one Maine bear\u2019s purely subjective opinion \u2014 the tone of the Econoday blurbs is noticeably happier than other commentary. I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to say \u201chappy talk,\u201d but\u2026 \\nProductivity and Costs, Q3 2016: \u201cProductivity has burst out of its slump, rising at a better-than-expected annualized pace of 3.1 percent in the third quarter\u201d [ Econoday ]. \u201cThe third-quarter breakdown shows a surge in output, more than doubling to a 3.4 percent growth rate at the same time that growth in hours worked slowed sharply, to a 0.3 percent rate vs the second-quarter\u2019s 1.7 percent. Greater efficiency between output and hours worked holds down labor costs which rose only 0.3 percent which is much better than expectations.\u201d And: \u201cThe driving force for third-quarter productivity was a surge in output coupled by the lower labor cost gain\u201d [ 247 Wall Street ]. But: \u201cAlthough many times the data is significantly revised between releases \u2013 it did not happen in this release. But IF I believed this data, costs are rising significantly whilst productivity is in the toilet (as I only look at year-over-year data \u2013 the headline compounding distorts the view)\u201d [ Econintersect ]. \u201cIf data is analyzed in year-over-year fashion, non-farm business productivity was unchanged year-over-year, and unit labor costs were up 2.3 % year-over-year. Bottom line: the year-over-year data is saying that costs are rising faster than productivity.\u201d And but: \u201c[T]he broader trend remains consistent with a decade-long decline\u201d [ Wall Street Journal , \u201cU.S. Productivity Jumps in Third Quarter, Trend Remains Soft\u201d]. \\nJobless Claims, week of October 29, 2016: \u201c[H]olding at or near record lows\u201d [ Econoday ]. \u201c[S]trength in the labor market and suggest that employers are holding tightly onto their employees.\u201d Or jobless claims are hard to file and/or people are terrified of leaving. But: \u201cThe trend of the 4 week moving average is continuing to marginally worsened \u2013 and catch up to the rolling averages of a year ago \u2013 and this trend historically indicates a weakening GDP\u201d [ Econintersect ]. \\nChallenger Job-Cut Report, October 2016: \u201cChallenger\u2019s October layoff count is low,\u201d and lower than the third quarter average [ Econoday ]. \u201c[A] positive signal for tomorrow\u2019s employment report.\u201d \\nFactory Orders, September 2016: \u201cGood news is hard to find in the September factory orders report which is best described as flat\u201d [ Econoday ]. And: \u201c[T]he data in this series is noisy so I would rely on the unadjusted 3 month rolling averages which say there was a moderate improvement this month \u2013 but this series remains in contraction year-over-year\u201d [ Econintersect ]. \\nGallup Good Jobs Rate, October 2016: Up, in a typical seasonal pattern, and \u201chigher than any GGJ rate recorded for the month of October since Gallup began tracking this measure in 2010\u201d [ Econoday ]. \u201cThe percentage of U.S. adults who participated in the workforce in October in any capacity \u2014 by working full time, working part time or not working but actively seeking and being available for work \u2014 was 68.4 percent, up almost a full percentage point from 67.5 percent in September.\u201d \\nISM Non-Manufacturing Index, October 2016: \u201cMuch of the ISM non-manufacturing report, at a composite of 54.8, is strong with employment, however, an exception,\u201d [ Econoday ]. \u201cEmployment growth may be down, but this report, like the services PMI earlier this morning, is pointing to a solid fourth-quarter start for the bulk of the economy.\u201d But: \u201d This was below the consensus forecast of 56.1, and suggests slower expansion in October than in September\u201d [ Calculated Risk ]. And but: \u201cNew orders were solid at 57.7 in October, but while they were above the net reading they were still down from September\u2019s 60.6 reading\u201d [ 247 Wall Street ]. \u201cBusiness activity was the same reading at a strong 57.7. But like the new orders component, the net business activity was slower growth than what was seen in September.\u201d \\nPurchasing Managers\u2019 Index Service Index, October 2016 (final): \u201cGrowth in the nation\u2019s service sector accelerated sharply in October based on Markit Economics\u2019 U.S. sample\u201d [ Econoday ]. \u201cStrength in consumer spending is what respondents reported as well as a rise in both input costs and selling prices. New orders are at an 11-month high as is business activity while year-ahead expectations are at their best level in a year-and-a-half. Backlogs are also piling up. This report points to a very solid fourth-quarter start for the bulk of the economy.\u201d \\nBloomberg Consumer Comfort Index, October 20, 2016: \u201cThe sharp gain in the prior week was no fluke for the consumer comfort index which, unlike other readings on confidence, has been picking up steam going into next week\u2019s presidential election\u201d [ Econoday ]. \\nChain Store Sales, October 2016: \u201cChain stores are reporting mixed sales in October, results that offer little guidance for monthly change in core retail sales (ex-food ex-gas)\u201d [ Econoday ]. \\nShipping: \u201cTop North America TEU negative performance worsened through September\u201d [James Sands, Seeking Alpha ]. \u201cThe marginal decline was impacted by top ten North America seaport laden imports, while laden exports improved. The Hanjin bankruptcy impacted seaports broadly, most notably the Port of Long Beach. Class I rail container traffic has continued to mirror these trends with mixed results.\u201d \\nShipping: \u201c[Freignt forwarder] Panalpina has reported signs of an earlier-than-normal start to the end-of-year peak season in air freight partly as a result of the disruption to supply chains caused by the collapse of Korean container carrier Hanjin Shipping [ Lloyd\u2019s Loading List ]. \u201c\u2018Obviously, not all of the Hanjin ships have arrived at port and there is cargo meant to reach stores for Christmas is still \u2018floating\u2019,\u2019 said CEO Stefan Karlen. \u2018So some customers are getting concerned and because of that switching containers to air freight, and that\u2019s where the pick-up (in demand) is coming from.'\u201d \\nShipping: \u201cWith the ocean cargo sector effectively going from 4 alliances to 3, when the Ocean Alliance takes effect in April 2017, the further concentration should enable the alliances, within themselves, to better control capacity as a means to improving revenue\u201d [ Logistics Management ]. One thing cartels are for\u2026 \\nShipping: \u201cWe will behave ourselves, say Ocean Alliance members\u201d [ Lloyd\u2019s List ]. \u201cOcean Alliance members have vowed to be more disciplined in the area of new tonnage in an effort to tackle the overcapacity that has depressed the container shipping market.\u201d \\nShipping: \u201cDire safety conditions revealed in wake of Gadani fire as death toll feared to surpass 100\u201d [ Splash 247 ]. \u201cA fire, which has now killed at least 21 people, is still raging at Pakistan\u2019s Gadani ship recycling area with fears the eventual death toll could hit triple figures. An explosion occurred on Tuesday as a welder worked on a gas cylinder in a beached oil tanker. The explosion rapidly became an inferno with many workers trapped in the ship.\u201d That is like a war, isn\u2019t it? From John Keegan\u2019s description, in The Price of Admiralty , of the battle of Jutland (\u201cthe last major battle fought primarily by battleships in world history\u201d): \\nAlthough not a war between states: \\nNasir Mansoor, deputy-general secretary of the National Trade Union Federation (NTUF), hit out at the absence of safety procedures at Gadani yesterday, saying the Indonesian ship\u2019s tanks had not been cleaned ahead of the scrapping starting. Moreover, Mansoor alleged the yard had just one ambulance, which was being actually used for transporting the officials\u2019 children to and from school. Mansoor said a total of 250 workers were working on the tanker when the explosion occurred. \\n\u201cWe demand that a murder case be registered right away against the Ship Breakers\u2019 Association,\u201d he said, calling for Rs3m compensation for each of the dead victims\u2019 families. \\nOf course, given the givens, the explosion and the deaths follow from over-capacity as the night the day. And it\u2019s not as if the conditions at Gadani weren\u2019t common knowledge among elites. I remember reading this article in The Atlantic in 2014, and here\u2019s an image from it: \\nSo, in the beached tanker, ka-boom! Whenever you hear the word \u201caccident,\u201d think to yourself: \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018accident\u2019?\u201d Oh, and there\u2019s this little detail: \\nThe floating oil production tanker, ACES (IMO # 8021830), was sold to the Gadani shipbreaker by Jakarta-based PT Sinar Mentari Prima and was used in the Jabung Batanghari terminal owned by the Indonesian government company BPMIGAS and operated by PetroChina. The change of flag and name of the ship happened just weeks before it reached the beach of Gadani, which strongly point towards the use of a cash buyer for the sale of the end-of-life vessel. \\nHmm. An unnamed \u201ccash buyer.\u201d Seems like Richard Smith territory\u2026 \\nRail: \u201cU.S. rail traffic slump continued in October\u201d [ Progressive Railroading ]. \u201cU.S. railroads logged a 3.2 percent decrease in carload and intermodal traffic last month compared with October 2015, the Association of American Railroads (AAR) reported yesterday\u2026 Excluding coal, carloads fell 3.8 percent last month compared with a year ago.\u201d \\nCommodities: \u201cCobalt is the element found within lithium-ion batteries that allows them to generate more power over a longer time-period than normal batteries and it has already powered a consumer tech revolution over the last decade. It is the catalyst for the imminent commercialisation of electric cars, the reason your smartphone doesn\u2019t need charging every half hour, and the reason you can read your kindle cable free during that long plane journey\u201d [ FCPA Blog ]. \u201cBut cobalt raises several compliance challenges. it is overwhelmingly found in one country \u2014 the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Around 60% of global supply of cobalt comes from the DRC. Cobalt doesn\u2019t currently fall under the SEC\u2019s Dodd-Frank section 1502 covering conflict minerals and there is no specific compliance regulations attached to the sourcing of the mineral. But the lack of scrutiny by regulators seems likely to change in the near future as demand for cobalt and understanding of its sourcing increases.\u201d \\nETFs: \u201cThis Year\u2019s Most Innovative New ETFs\u201d [ETFs.com]. \u201cInnovative\u201d? Uh-oh\u2026. \u201cSome of this year\u2019s most innovative exchange-traded funds are ones that look at gender diversity as a way to boost corporate performance, generic drugs and even using crowdsourcing to make bets on which stocks will outperform from month to month.\u201d Seems frothy. \\nToday\u2019s Fear & Greed Index: 17 Fear (previous close: 18, Fear) [ CNN ].

As a result, not only does British imperialism receive exaltation and eulogy, but the postcolonial melancholia that afflicts public political culture is premised on the idea it was built on virtue and the diligence, strength, and courage of British people.\u201d \\nClass Warfare \\n\u201c\u2018I WANT MY COUNTRY BACK'\u201d [ Pandaemonium ].

Following the Leave vote there had been a spike in people googling \u2018What is the EU?\u2019. Many Remainers took this to be proof of the ignorance of those voting Leave. In fact fewer than 1000 people googled \u2018What is the EU?\u2019 and there was no evidence that that a single person who had googled the question had voted Leave. Yet supporters of the EU continued to propagate this as evidence of the ignorance of Leave voters. If it was evidence of anything it was, perhaps, that an education is no insurance against cognitive bias, no protection against a willingness to be swayed by one\u2019s prejudices, no shield against a tendency to jump to conclusions not warranted by the facts. \\nWell worth a read.\""}, "time": 1742628575.0679817}
