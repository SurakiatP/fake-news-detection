Except that the resolution never uses that term for Judaism\u2019s holiest shrine. It refers to and treats it as an exclusively Muslim site, a deliberate attempt to eradicate its connection \u2014 let alone its centrality \u2014 to the Jewish people and Jewish history. \\nThis Orwellian absurdity is an insult not just to Judaism but to Christianity. It makes a mockery of the Gospels, which chronicle the story of a Galilean Jew whose life and ministry unfolded throughout the Holy Land, most especially in Jerusalem and the Temple. If this is nothing but a Muslim site, what happens to the very foundation of Christianity, which occurred 600 years before Islam even came into being? \\nThis UNESCO resolution is merely the surreal extreme of the worldwide campaign to delegitimize Israel. It features the BDS movement (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions), now growing on Western university campuses and some mainline Protestant churches. And it extends even into some precincts of the Democratic Party.'"}, "time": 1742561798.1850927}
