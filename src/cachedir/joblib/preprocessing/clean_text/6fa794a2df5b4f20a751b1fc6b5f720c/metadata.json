Brock wants his unregistered solicitor, the Bonner Group, to keep its client list hidden for a very specific reason.\\nDavid Brock is laundering money \\n \\nRelated Stories Consumers Need Protection From New Consumer Protection Bureau Rule Here\u2019s What The Markets Are Telling Us\u2026 Exposed: Profiteers Of Governing \u2013 And These Are The Ones Who Got Caught! Brock has seven nonprofits, three super PACs, one 527 committee, one LLC, one joint fundraising committee and one unregistered solicitor crammed into his office in Washington .\\nUncovered records expose a constant flow of money between these organizations.\\nThe Bonner Group, his professional solicitor, works off a commission. Every time money gets passed around, Bonner receives a 12.5 percent cut.\\n \\nFollow the money \\nNonprofits are required to disclose to whom they give cash grants.\\nBut they aren\u2019t required to disclose who gives them cash grants.\\nThis weak system of one-way verification is being abused by Brock. He\u2019s been cycling money between his organizations for years, and the Bonner Group\u2019s 12.5 percent commission gets triggered after every pass.\\n \\nTrending Stories Frustrated With Media Bias, Trump Campaign Takes Its Case Directly To Voters With Nightly Show On Facebook RNC Official Takes CNN Host To Task For Claiming There Is No Media Bias Hannity Proposes A Sendoff For Obama In The Event Of A Trump Presidency In 2014, Media Matters for America raised more than $10 million.\\nThe Bonner Group was credited for raising these funds. Media Matters paid it a $1.1 million commission.\\n\\nThat same year, Media Matters gave a $930,000 cash grant to Brock\u2019s Franklin Education Forum , an organization that shares office space with Media Matters.\\n\\nIn 2014, the Franklin Education Forum reported $994,000 in total contributions, and 93.6 percent of that total came from Media Matters.\\nSurprisingly, though, the Franklin Education Forum gave full credit to Bonner for raising that money. It paid the fundraiser a $124,250 commission in 2014.\\n\\nNotice what happened? \\nBrock\u2019s Media Matters gave a $930,000 cash grant to Brock\u2019s Franklin Education Forum. Brock\u2019s Franklin Education Forum credited the Bonner Group for raising those funds, triggering the 12.5 percent commission. Brock paid the Bonner Group a $124,250 commission to solicit a cash grant \u2026 from himself! It doesn\u2019t stop there \\nAfter the Franklin Education Forum retained $869,750, it sent a $816,224 cash grant to Brock\u2019s Franklin Forum . \\n\\nNote: The Franklin Education Forum is a 501(c)3, and The Franklin Forum is a 501(c)4. They are not the same company. \\nThe Franklin Forum 501(c)4 paid Bonner a commission in 2013 , so it\u2019s safe to assume the fundraiser received a $102,028 commission in 2014. Unfortunately, it\u2019s hard to tell for sure. It still hasn\u2019t filed its taxes for 2014!\\nLet\u2019s recap \\nSay, for example, you donate $1,062,857 to Media Matters for America. This is how David Brock would have used your charitable donation in 2014:\\nMedia Matters would receive your $1,062,857 donation. The Bonner Group would earn a $132,857 commission. Media Matters would retain $930,000. Next, Media Matters would give what\u2019s left of your entire donation , $930,000, to the Franklin Education Forum. The Bonner Group would \u201cearn\u201d a $116,250 commission. The Franklin Education Forum would retain $813,750. The Franklin Education Forum would then forward the remaining $813,750 to The Franklin Forum. The Bonner Group would \u201cearn\u201d a $101,718 commission. The Franklin Forum would retain $712,031. In the end, Brock\u2019s solicitor would have pocketed $350,825, almost a third of your initial donation. That\u2019s a far cry from the advertised 12.5 percent commission.\\nAs bizarre as that scenario may sound, this is exactly what Brock did in 2014.\\nHow can we be sure this is intentional? \\nBrock is the chairman for each of these organizations. How could he not know what\u2019s going on?\\nHe\u2019s a hands-on chairman. According to their tax returns, Brock allocates time, weekly, to his organizations:\\nMedia Matters: 31.50 hours per week Franklin Education Forum: three hours per week The Franklin Forum: one hour per week Furthermore, The New York Times reports that Brock shares a summer rental in the Hamptons with Mary Pat Bonner, the president of the Bonner Group.\\nBrock would have a hard time claiming ignorance on this. These transfers are intentional. He vacations with his solicitor. Case closed.\\nStill not convinced? \\nBrock didn\u2019t even bother to give his organizations different phone numbers. They all share the same number.\\n\\nWhat if \u2026? \\nWe even located the Bonner Group\u2019s solicitation agreement with Media Matters on Florida\u2019s Gift Givers\u2019 Guide . Clarification on the commission can be found on page 2:\\n\\nIn English: Contractually, Brock has the option to exclude certain contributions from triggering the commission. In spite of this option, he intentionally chooses to trigger the 12.5 percent commission for money grants between his organizations.\\nNote: Yes, we are making the assumption that all of Brock\u2019s organizations have the same solicitation agreement with the Bonner Group. Given that his organizations share the same address, board members and telephone number, we feel it\u2019s safe to assume they also share the same solicitation agreement. \\nThis barely scratches the surface \\nUtilizing public-facing tax returns, along with records submitted to the Federal Election Commission, we mapped out all the significant money transfers from 2014 that took place in Brock\u2019s office:\\n\\nSummary \\nThis is all from just one year! No further commentary required.\\nWe understand this may be hard to believe. We first came across this in July, and are still having a hard time wrapping our heads around it.\\nAll of the data referenced in this article originated from publicly accessible sources. Check for yourself \u2014 we provided links to the source material in our article exposing the organizations operating in Brock\u2019s office. These data have been sitting out in the open, gathering dust for years. \\nIf it looks like a duck, swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.\\nWe\u2019ve spent months trying to find some sort of loophole to justify this activity. But there aren\u2019t any loopholes. David Brock has something to hide. Just last month, The Daily Caller reported the following:\\n\u201cBrock\u2019s former long-time live-in boyfriend William Grey (whom Brock has thanked in several of his books) threatened to go to the IRS with damaging information about how Brock was running his Media Matters empire. What did Brock do? He paid Grey $850,000 to keep quiet. Brock reportedly had to sell his home in Rehoboth, Delaware, to come up with the money. This certainly seems to indicate that Brock was terrified about what the authorities would uncover.\u201d\\nAdding to this, Fox News reported the following:\\n\u201cGrey accused Brock of \u2018financial malfeasance\u2019 and threatened to undermine Brock\u2019s fundraising efforts.\\n\u201c\u2018Next step is I contact all your donors and the IRS,\u2019 Grey wrote in an email dated May 19, 2010. \u2018This is going to stink for you if you do not resolve this now.'\u201d\\nWe believe that the information presented in this article is what has Brock so terrified. We feel confident in saying, with close to absolute certainty, that David Brock is laundering money through his Media Matters conglomerate.\\nThis article first appeared at The Citizens Audit . \\n\\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by the owners of this website. \\nWhat do you think?\""}, "time": 1742564327.7912033}
