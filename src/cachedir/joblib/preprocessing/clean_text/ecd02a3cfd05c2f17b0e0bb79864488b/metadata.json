There is a mind-boggling connection among ancient structures that is indicative of a far greater meaning than we were aware of. \\n\\n\\nThere have been numerous theories that ancient structures around the globe were specifically positioned by its ancient builder\u2019s thousands of years ago. Perhaps one of the best examples \u2013according to many\u2014 is the Great Pyramid of Giza and its curious position on Earth. For those of you who didn\u2019t know, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the most accurately aligned structure in existence and faces true north with only 3/60th of a degree of error. Furthermore, the weight of the pyramid is estimated at 5,955,000 tons. Multiplied by 10^8 gives a reasonable estimate of the earth\u2019s mass. As you can see, ancient structures were built with a mind-boggling precision.\\n\\nBut the Pyramids at the Giza plateau do not stand solitary on Earth. In fact, there are countless other sites that seem to be connected somehow. If you take a look at other ancient sites like the Nazca Lines, Machu Picchu, Easter Island, Mohenjo Daro, and Tassili n\u2019Ajjer among others and draw down their position on a map, you will notice a connection that points perhaps towards an ancient \u2018code\u2019 embedded within these structures.\\n\\nAs is noted by world-mysteries.com , ancient sites like Giza, Siwa, Tassili n\u2019Ajjer, Paratoari, Ollantaytambo, Machupicchu, Nazca, Easter Island, Aneityum Island, Preah Vihear, Sukhothai, Pyay, Khajuraho, Mohenjo Daro, Persepolis, Ur, Petra are shown clockwise from Giza on the equal azimuthal projection. The projection is centered on the axis point in southeastern Alaska. Distances to any location from the center of an equal azimuthal projection are equally scaled. Since all of the sites on the great circle alignment are equally distant from the axis point at one-quarter of the circumference of the earth, the alignment forms a perfect circle halfway between the center and the outer edge of the projection.\\n\\nCheck out the image below to understand the complexity of this mysterious alignment. \\n\\n\\nJim Alison goes on to explain even further in a very intriguing chart: \\nThe chart below lists the distance of each site from the great circle and the distance of each site from the northern axis point. There are slight variations in the distance from the axis point to the great circle depending on whether the route from the axis point to different locations along the great circle crosses over the equator or Polar Regions. The mean distance from the axis point to the great circle is 6,218 miles. \\n\\nFurthermore, the alignment of these sites is easily observable on a globe of the Earth with a horizon ring. If you line up any two of these sites on the horizon ring, all of the sites will be right on the horizon ring:\\n\\nStart on the Equator, at the mouth of the Amazon River, at 49\u00b0 17\u2032 West Longitude; go to 30\u00b0 18\u2032 North Latitude, 40\u00b0 43\u2032 East Longitude, in the Middle East, which is the maximum latitude the line touches; then go to the Equator at 130\u00b0 43\u2032 East Longitude, near the Northwest tip of New Guinea; then to 30\u00b0 18\u2032 South Latitude, 139\u00b0 17\u2032 West Longitude, in the South Pacific; and then back to 49\u00b0 17\u2032 West Longitude, at the Equator.\\n\\nAs you can see, there seems to be a connection among all of the above structures that form \u2013to the surprise of many\u2014 a massive circle encompassing all major archaeological site son planet Earth. How this is possible remains a profound enigma.\\n\\nWhat are your thoughts? Were te ancient\u2019s trying to tell future generations something? Or, is it possible that this fascinating connection is nothing more than another bizarre coincidence?\\n\\nAncient-Code \\nSOURCE '"}, "time": 1742561900.9149022}
