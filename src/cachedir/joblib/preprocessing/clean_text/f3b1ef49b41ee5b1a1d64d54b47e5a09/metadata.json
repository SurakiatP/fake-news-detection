The investigation, undertaken by two prominent law firms in 2015, drew on millions of documents and interviews with current and former employees. Among those interviewed was Sepp Blatter, FIFA\u2019s longtime president who stepped down amid scandal, his lawyer confirmed. In recent days, FIFA said, the organization turned over the last in a series of inquiry reports  \u2014   totaling 1, 300 pages, with an additional 20, 000 pages of supplementary evidence  \u2014   to Switzerland\u2019s office of the attorney general. Swiss prosecutors, who have named Mr. Blatter and his former top deputy, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Valcke, as subjects of a criminal investigation, are expected to share the information with the United States Justice Department, which led international scrutiny of FIFA by charging dozens of soccer officials, businessmen and companies with racketeering, money laundering, wire fraud and bribery in 2015. In its announcement, FIFA\u2019s president, Gianni Infantino, seemed eager to turn the page on one of the darkest chapters in its history. \u201cFIFA committed to conducting a thorough and comprehensive investigation of the facts so we could hold wrongdoers within football accountable and cooperate with the authorities,\u201d Mr. Infantino said. \u201cFIFA will now return its focus to the game. \u201d The American and Swiss investigations are, however, continuing  \u2014   deconstructing schemes spanning decades to which more than a dozen have confessed. So, too, is an investigation in France, where Mr. Valcke lives. That inquiry is being conducted by France\u2019s national financial prosecutor\u2019s office, which, like the American investigators\u2019 has relied on cooperation from Switzerland\u2019s attorney general. Swiss privacy laws dictate that FIFA\u2019s information must be funneled through Swiss authorities. FIFA, based in Zurich, is forbidden to deliver documents directly to other governments, which frustrated FIFA\u2019s lawyers during early stages of the United States\u2019 case, as they sought to telegraph their cooperation and to solidify FIFA\u2019s place as a victim in the eyes of the authorities. \u201cThe office of the attorney general of Switzerland appreciates the preliminary exchange of information and FIFA\u2019s close and consistent cooperation,\u201d Ladina Gapp, a spokeswoman for that office, wrote in an email on Friday. \u201cSince the criminal proceedings are ongoing, FIFA is restricted from releasing or commenting on the findings from its investigation. \u201d The narrative reports and corresponding evidence newly turned over by FIFA might not be revelatory for government authorities, who have obtained voluminous information through their own interviews, raids and specific document requests, to which FIFA has responded on a rolling basis over the last two years. But the reports, produced by the American law firm Quinn Emanuel and the Swiss law firm Niederer Kraft  Frey, catalog FIFA\u2019s insight into its leadership\u2019s possible crimes and signal a symbolic moment as the organization seeks to emerge from the scandal. The United States has charged more than 40 defendants in its case. Of those, 19 people have so far publicly pleaded guilty, along with multiple companies. As recently as December 2016, a new guilty plea was unsealed. Five soccer officials are actively fighting charges in the United States and set to stand trial in the fall, while numerous others remain abroad and have not answered to the charges against them. The investigations have been dizzying  \u2014   and expensive  \u2014   for FIFA, which has asked the United States government for tens of millions of dollars, a portion of the money that the convicted defendants have pledged to pay the Justice Department in restitution. The scandal has unseated dozens of international and national soccer officials, predominantly from South and Central America, some with deep roots in the sport and their names emblazoned on administration buildings. At least one implicated leader remains in power: Marco Polo Del Nero, the president of Brazil\u2019s soccer association, who was indicted by the United States in 2015. Mr. Infantino, who succeeded Mr. Blatter as FIFA\u2019s president last year, has broadly condemned the disfiguring corruption and advocated change, but he has not called for Mr. Del Nero\u2019s resignation and met with him in Rio de Janeiro last summer as part of a routine visit.'"}, "time": 1742562453.843183}
