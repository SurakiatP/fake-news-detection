So, that\u2019s going to be legal problem one, potentially. \u201d He continued, \u201cSecondly, think about this, Wolf. This is extraordinary. This is the official government document of a meeting of the president of the United States and Russian officials inside the Oval Office, and it\u2019s being read to a New York Times reporter. They have a point about leaks. It\u2019s not going to save them from their real legal and political troubles, but it is extraordinary to see and another warning sign to Donald Trump that there are people in this government who seem pretty committed to taking him down. \u201d Later on, Chalian added that Trump has \u201cgone back and forth\u201d about his rationale for firing Comey.
