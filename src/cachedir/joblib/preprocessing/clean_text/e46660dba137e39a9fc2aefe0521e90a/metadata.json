Human Rights Council, blames Israel in part for Palestinian men beating their wives  \u2014   offering more fuel to those in the Trump administration seeking to leave the council over its   bias. [The document, first reported by U. N. Watch, which monitors the international body, was written by Dubravka \u0160imonovi\u0107  \u2014   the Special Rapporteur on violence against women  \u2014   who filed dual reports based on her trips to the region in 2016. The report in question focuses on the \u201ccauses and consequences\u201d of violence against women in the region.  In her filing on Israel, \u0160imonovi\u0107 highlights what she claims is a \u201cclear linkage\u201d between the \u201cIsraeli occupation\u201d and Palestinian domestic abuse: While recognizing the imperatives related to security and stability in the region, the Rapporteur highlights the clear linkage between the prolonged occupation and [violence against women] and she notes, like her predecessor, that the occupation does not exonerate the State of Palestine from its due human rights obligation to prevent, investigate, punish and provide remedies for acts of   violence (GBV) in the areas and for persons under its jurisdiction or effective control. The report states:  Several testimonies the Rapporteur collected highlighted that the economic situation, the level of unemployment and the pressure of the occupation have a greater impact on women\u2019s and children\u2019s lives, making them more vulnerable to domestic violence, in particular in Gaza, due to the constant pressure felt by the blockade and the recurring cycles of conflict, and the overcrowding that limits their mobility and privacy. While \u0160imonovi\u0107 does partly blame traditions and culture within Palestinian society, her report still fingered Israel in those sections. For instance, the report claims that \u201cdecades of Israeli occupation in parallel with the continuation of patriarchal attitude in Palestinian society expose women to subordination and continuing violence. \u201d However, while in some places the report does state that what it calls \u201cthe State of Palestine\u201d has a responsibility, it also mitigates that responsibility in other sections, at one point claiming: \u201cthe occupation is a real obstacle to the State\u2019s due diligence obligation to prevent violence against women in areas where it does not have full jurisdiction  \u2026    \u201d  \u201cIsraeli occupation\u201d refers to Israel\u2019s presence in the West Bank, which is dotted with historic Jewish towns and Jewish holy sites and eastern Jersualem, home of the Western Wall and Temple Mount. The Human Rights Council has long been accused of   bias. U. S. Ambassador Nikki Haley has repeatedly called the council out on its bias, and threatened that the U. S. may leave that body if it does not reform its membership and focus less on Israel. At a debate on the report at the Human Rights Council in Geneva, U. N. Watch representative Hillel Neuer criticized \u0160imonovi\u0107 and accused her of \u201cinfantilizing\u201d Palestinian men, and questioned why she did not spend more time on the issue of \u201ctradition and culture,\u201d arguing that Palestinian TV gives advice to husbands on how to hit their wives. \u0160imonovi\u0107 responded by clarifying that \u201cany man who is beating his wife is responsible  \u2014   he is a perpetrator of violence. \u201d  \u201cBut when we are speaking about human rights responsibility and due diligence responsibility, then we are at a different level, because states have due diligence responsibility to prevent violence against women and to establish measures to prevent such violence to punish perpetrators of violence and to provide compensation to victims,\u201d she said.
