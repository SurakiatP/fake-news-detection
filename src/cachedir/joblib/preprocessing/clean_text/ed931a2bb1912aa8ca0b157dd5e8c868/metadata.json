[Reagan\u2019s answer was to send in the National Guard, armed with buckshot and batons. Contrast this with Berkeley\u2019s more recent approach, which was to give professor and former Labor Secretary Robert Reich a platform to spew a hysterical conspiracy theory in which Breitbart and I hired domestic terrorists to beat up my own fans and the residents of Berkeley and smash up Bank of America ATMs, Starbucks and trashcans.  But back to Reagan. He then gave a news conference, where, in Daddyesque fashion, he slapped down members of the media for encouraging the lawlessness. GOAT. Reagan knew how to handle lawless rioters. \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 pic. twitter.   \u2014   Rita Panahi (@RitaPanahi) November 12, 2016,  The good news for President Trump and others interested in maintaining law and order in the face of leftist anarchy is that police   has advanced since the 1960s, and there is no need to send in the National Guard with shotguns, as Reagan did, which ended up killing one student. In the   century, pepper spray and foam cannons can accomplish the same job without fatalities. And there\u2019s even better news. There\u2019s a way to defeat protests without buckshot, foam cannons, or pepper spray. A way to beat them before they even begin. It\u2019s simple: defund UC Berkeley, and any other campus that encourages the mad, radical politics that is now causing violence on America\u2019s streets on a daily basis. The Department of Education largely controls the   of American colleges. At UC Berkeley last year, federal funding came to $370 million  \u2014   more than half the university\u2019s budget. Colleges fear the withdrawal of federal funds so much that when the Obama administration merely hinted at doing so in 2011 over the largely fabricated \u201ccampus rape epidemic,\u201d it led to one of the greatest outbreaks of panic and miscarriages of justice in American history, as colleges set up kangaroo courts which frequently expelled students for sexual assault based on threadbare evidence. The left are well aware of the existential threat they face. That\u2019s why it\u2019s Betsy DeVos  \u2014   and not, say, Jeff Sessions  \u2014   who is facing the toughest confirmation hearing. Jeff Sessions is important, of course, and will no doubt do extraordinary work in foiling the mad globalist dream of open borders, but it\u2019s what Trump might do in education that really strikes terror into the hearts of the left. Higher education is their ideological breeding ground the mad leftist displays that you see in Hollywood and Silicon Valley start on college campuses. Sessions is a problem for the left on a number of fronts, notably law and order and immigration. But if DeVos is bold and aggressive enough, she could tear out the beating heart of leftist power  \u2014   college ideological indoctrination. If colleges were effectively   by DeVos, the left would take generations to recover. At this point, some libertarians  \u2014   like the American party\u2019s cretinous chairman  \u2014   will be clutching their pearls at the thought of using the federal government to influence colleges. Once again (and this is why the right and why libertarians so often lose) they fail to grasp the cultural libertarian argument  \u2014   libertarian ideals will come to nothing in a culture that doesn\u2019t respect liberty. This is what the \u2018do what you want, just leave me in peace to mine bitcoin and smoke weed\u2019 faction of libertarianism  \u2014   I. e. most libertarians  \u2014   don\u2019t understand. A similar argument obtains when talking about protecting the first amendment from sources of hostility to free speech, such as Islam, feminism and most of the media. And where are cultural values incubated? Colleges, of course! As long as campuses are churning out students who hate free speech and free markets, what hope is there for libertarian policy priorities? If libertarians want to live in a free society, they\u2019d better get ready to tread on their opponents. At my UC Berkeley show last week,   set college property on fire, smashed up bank windows and ATMs, jumped on people\u2019s cars, and looted downtown stores, including the   liberal Starbucks. They also assaulted dozens of my fans, who were falsely accused of being \u201cNazis. \u201d The San Francisco Chronicle reports that   rioters caused around $600, 000 in damages that night, with the riot starting at the college before spreading to downtown Berkeley. $600, 000. That\u2019s an awful lot of money for a communist tantrum. The day after, my tour bus was tracked and my hotel location was leaked online.   Berkeley activists took out the remainder of their frustration on the bus, which was vandalized with spray paint. Following the chaos, only one suspect was arrested, and celebrities, the mainstream media, the Mayor of Berkeley, and UC Berkeley administrators blamed the damage on me \u2014   a homosexual conservative who was unable to deliver a speech because students, brainwashed by their Marxist professors, decided to set their campus on fire. For decades, the university campus has been a hotbed of dogma, brainwashing generation after generation in the most fashionable and foolhardy leftist ideas of the day. From professors offering extra credit to attend   rallies to courses on \u201cThe Problem of Whiteness,\u201d leftists on campus are teaching younger generations how to hate. Is it any wonder that they then go around smashing windows and punching people in the face? And if that isn\u2019t bad enough, these thugs are absolutely terrible at identifying their ideological enemies  \u2014   according to the account of Malini Ramaiyer in the New York Times, one person called a \u201cNazi\u201d and assaulted was a Syrian Muslim student. Oops! Who could have predicted training young people to attack instead of argue could turn out badly? And by the way, if you\u2019re a NYT or Buzzfeed or CNN journalist \\u200ereading this, you\u2019re to blame too, for creating an environment in which it\u2019s okay to call conservatives Nazis and white supremacists. What did you think was going to happen? The current atmosphere is also terrible for college students themselves. They\u2019re paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to attend what are effectively progressive madrasas, turning them into little more than brainwashed street fighters. Today, a gender studies graduate seems more likely to end up in jail for destruction of property than in a stable job. Perhaps that is part of the plan  \u2014   striking fear into the patriarchy one load of prison laundry at a time. It can end, and it must end, or America will face eight years of violence on its streets, and who knows what state the country will be in after that? all because public universities refuse to honor their first amendment responsibilities.
