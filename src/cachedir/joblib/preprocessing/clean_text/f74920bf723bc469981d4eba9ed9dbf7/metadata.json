Elizabeth Warren\u2019s   tenure in public service is rife with contradictions, as an examination of her current positions juxtaposed with her past behavior reveals. [Warren\u2019s latest book, \u201cThis Fight Is Our Fight: The Battle to Save America\u2019s Middle Class\u201d is her 11th. Rumors have been swirling that the progressive Democrat and Harvard law professor could be positioning herself for a run in the 2020 presidential elections.  When digging into her very near past though, Warren\u2019s hypocritical position as a champion of \u201cequal pay for equal work,\u201d her phony war on big business, her   stance on a   health care system, and her hypocrisy on school choice quickly come into question. In her 2014 book \u201cA Fighting Chance,\u201d she criticized her 2012 opponent Scott Brown for voting against equal pay for equal work. In the book, she said of Brown, \u201cHe\u2019s had exactly one chance to vote for equal pay for equal work, and he voted no.   \u2026     Those were bad votes for women, and it felt right to say so. \u201d However, a Washington Free Beacon article titled \u201cElizabeth Warren\u2019s Female Staffers Made 71% of Male Staffers\u2019 Salaries in 2016\u201d reported that the gender pay gap in Warren\u2019s own Senate office is \u201cnearly 10 percent wider than the national average. \u201d Warren has also contradicted herself with her claims that she fights against big business  \u2014   failing to mention that she worked \u201con behalf of a big business\u201d and got paid over $200, 000 in a matter of three years.  In 2012, the Boston Globe reported that Warren, in her sole appearance in the U. S. Supreme Court, helped represent Travelers Insurance in a case that involved dozens of lawyers and thousands of asbestos victims. \u201cThe 2009 appearance was the only time Warren helped represent a party before the nation\u2019s highest court. And it provides a rare window into a   aspect of the Harvard Law professor\u2019s career, her time as a working attorney in the courts,\u201d wrote the Boston Globe. The publication adds that the case  \u2014   Travelers v. Bailey  \u2014   was particularly \u201cnotable because Warren, who has gained fame for defending consumers against big business, was in this case working on behalf of a big business. For her contribution, Warren was paid $212, 000 over three years by Travelers, the nation\u2019s largest insurer. \u201d Warren\u2019s contradictory reputation with fighting against big business is also brought to the fore when examining her support for Massachusetts defense contractors. \u201cElizabeth Warren\u2019s standing as a liberal warrior immune to the influence of Big Business hasn\u2019t stopped her from pushing the interests of major defense contractors back home,\u201d Politico wrote in 2015.  Warren has fought to stop the Army from shifting funds away from a   communications network to pay for unanticipated costs associated with the war in Afghanistan. She\u2019s lobbied for   General   tactical radios. And she\u2019s pledged to protect Westover Air Reserve Base from the budget ax  \u2014   all while saying she supports \u2018targeted\u2019 cuts elsewhere. In the same piece, Politico further notes that Warren\u2019s potential presidential candidacy would subject her to \u201cscrutiny over the way she\u2019s balanced her populist views with her   for pursuing the   practice of   politics. \u201d Health care has proven to be one of the biggest obstacles in recent political history. In the 2008 book \u201cHealth At Risk,\u201d edited by Jacob Hacker, Warren   an essay with Deborah Thorne, titled \u201cGet Sick, Go Broke,\u201d where she claimed that   health care was \u201cthe most obvious\u201d solution to America\u2019s healthcare problems.  \u201cWe approach the health care debates from a single perspective: maintaining the financial stability of families confronting illness or injury,\u201d Warren wrote. \u201cThe most obvious solution would be universal   health care. This would allow people to get the care they need  \u2014   without risking bankruptcy to pay for it. No more credit card debt at 29. 9 percent interest to pay for drugs no more second mortgages to pay for a hospital admission no more dealing with debt collectors who garnish wages and threaten to put liens on homes.   care would also free families from dependence on an employer\u2019s plan and make certain that everyone is covered whether or not they are employed. \u201d However, in 2012, Warren told a local TV host that she did not support a   health care system. Asked by former NECN reporter Jim Braude if she supports   healthcare, Warren said, \u201cNo, [I support] what I\u2019ve got right now  \u2026    \u201d Braude went on to remind Warren that she \u201cwrote repeatedly\u201d that she does support it to which Warren responded, \u201cOh! I think you need to go back and take a look. \u201d Braude then referenced the paragraph Warren   with Thorne. \u201cI have a paragraph: \u2018The most obvious solution would be universal,   health care.   care would also free families from dependents on an employers\u2019 plan and make certain that everyone is covered whether or not.\u2019 You wrote that with a   from Ohio. \u201d Warren shot back, \u201cI wrote that with two. Actually, with two [ ] I think. That\u2019s exactly right. But the point is, what we\u2019ve got to do is we\u2019ve got to keep moving in the direction of getting more families covered and bringing down the costs of healthcare, and I think we\u2019ve taken a big step in that direction. \u201d Just last month, during remarks she delivered at the New England Council, Warren said, \u201cI think every option needs to be on the table, and single payer sure ought to be at the top of the list. \u201d Asked by a reporter to clarify where she stands on single payer, considering her past inconsistency on the matter, Warren said: It depends on where we want to go next and what we can do next. If the question is, \u2018can we make the Affordable Care Act better, and we can find some Republicans colleagues to do that,\u2019 then absolutely. We should do what we can to improve it. But I want to be clear. We built a whole health care system in the hopes that it was going to be bipartisan when we built the Affordable Care Act, right? It came out of the Heritage Foundation, it had Republican ideas in it, we built it off of what Mitt Romney had done here in Massachusetts, took amendments from Republicans  \u2014   how much Republican support did we get for that? None. So if we\u2019re talking about tearing down the health care system and starting over, then I think every option needs to be on the table, and single payer sure ought to be at the top of the list. As for school choice, Warren is also hypocritical. In her 2003 book, \u201cThe   Trap: Why   Parents are Going Broke,\u201d which she   with her daughter Amelia Warren Tyagi, Warren endorsed and emphasized the importance of school vouchers.  \u201cA   voucher program would fit the bill neatly,\u201d Warren and Tyagi wrote. \u201cA    voucher that paid the entire cost of educating a child (not just a partial subsidy) would open a range of opportunities to all children. With fully funded vouchers, parents of all income levels could send their children  \u2014   and the accompanying financial support  \u2014   to the schools of their choice. \u201d They added, \u201cFully funded vouchers would relieve parents from the terrible choice of leaving their kids in lousy schools or bankrupting themselves to escape those schools. \u201d However, this past January, Warren took a complete turn from her original statement when she wrote in a letter to   for Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos that private voucher programs \u201cin many cases\u201d are \u201cexpensive and dangerous failures. \u201d She also wrote that \u201cThese private voucher programs have a   history. Historically, private school vouchers have been used by some states to further racial and socioeconomic segregation. \u201d Warren added, \u201cFor decades, you have been one of the nation\u2019s strongest advocates for radically transforming the public education system through the use of   vouchers that steer public dollars away from traditional public schools to private and religious schools.   \u2026     But the actual evidence on how private voucher programs affect educational outcomes is mixed at best, and in many cases reveals these programs to be expensive and dangerous failures that cost taxpayers billions of dollars while destroying public education systems. \u201d Follow Adelle Nazarian on Facebook and Twitter.'"}, "time": 1742564353.2532053}
