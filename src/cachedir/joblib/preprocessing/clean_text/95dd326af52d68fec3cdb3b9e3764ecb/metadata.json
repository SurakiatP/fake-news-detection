[After reports confirmed the news that President Trump had visited Scalise at MedStar Washington Hospital Center on Wednesday evening, Acosta tweeted the exact opposite per a White official, \u201cWH official on hospital visit: \u201cPresident Trump did not meet with Scalise and did not go into the room where Scalise is being treated. \u201d  Acosta quickly deleted his original Tweet but not before it was captured by several Twitter users many of them accusing the CNN reporter of spreading fake news. Fake news @CNN reporter, @Acosta tweets a complete lie   @POTUS that gets almost 1200 more RT\u2019s than the correction. #ScaliseShooting pic. twitter.   \u2014   No One \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@tweettruth2me) June 15, 2017,  Jim Acosta. CNN you people are truely FAKENEWS  first you tweet President Trump did not go to see Rep Sclease and then you re make a tweet,  \u2014   michelle (@mibashful) June 16, 2017,  CNN should fire you for reporting fake news. A regular person gets fired if they mess up at the level that you did.  \u2014   Ross Johansen (@rossjohansen) June 15, 2017,  CNN and Jim Acosta are Very Fake News! \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffb  \u2014   Paula Ikerd (@IkerdPaula) June 16, 2017,  The never ending joke known as @CNN  \u2026     #FakeNews #KneepadJournalism #AcostaStooge pic. twitter.   \u2014   James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) June 15, 2017,  Acosta tweeted a White House Press Corps email, where he says he based his original tweet on. Here\u2019s a screen grab of the TV pool report that incorrectly stated that POTUS did not see Scalise at the hospital. WH later said POTUS did. pic. twitter.   \u2014   Jim Acosta (@Acosta) June 15, 2017,  But social media users were, again, quick to point out that Acosta had originally based his report on word from a White House official and not a TV pool report. Stop making excuses! You had wrong info. Delete the original tweet and stop trying to justify the error! This is why I don\u2019t follow you.  \u2014   Jen Smith (@JenSmith230) June 15, 2017,  Your original tweet said \u201dWH official\u201d. It didn\u2019t reference WH pool. But once caught out, oh, well, it\u2019s the pool\u2019s fault. pic. twitter.   \u2014   Jeff Dobbs (@jeffdobbs) June 15, 2017,  The entire episode dredged up memories of a February exchange between Acosta and Trump that saw the president changing his previous description of CNN from \u201cfake news\u201d to \u201cvery fake news. \u201d \u201cReal news, Mr. President, real news,\u201d Acosta replied. Indeed, President Trump did visit at his hospital bedside, after he and three others were shot Wednesday morning practice for the annual Congressional Baseball Game. Scalise\u2019s Capitol Hill Police officer detail shot the attacker James T. Hodgkinson, who later died of his injuries. The congressman, who has undergone three  surgeries, remains in critical condition. Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson'"}, "time": 1742562902.3173292}
