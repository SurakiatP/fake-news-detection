Footage of the camerawoman, Petra Laszlo, who was filming migrants as they were being chased by police officers, spread quickly on social media, adding to Hungary\u2019s reputation for hostility toward the thousands of people fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and Asia. The charge, breach of peace, is defined in Hungarian law as antisocial, violent behavior capable of inciting indignation or alarm, and it carries a maximum sentence of two years in prison unless there are aggravating circumstances. Ms. Laszlo was carrying a camera and wearing a surgical mask in September 2015 when she kicked two migrants and then awkwardly threw out her leg toward a man later identified as Osama Abdul Mohsen, a Syrian refugee, who was holding his child. According to an indictment released by the chief prosecutor in the county of Csongrad in southern Hungary, however, she did not make contact with Mr. Mohsen and he fell as he \u201cwrenched himself out from the grip\u201d of a police officer. The evidence did not suggest that Ms. Laszlo could have caused injury, the indictment said, and there was nothing to indicate that she was motivated by \u201cethnic considerations\u201d or \u201cby the migrant status of the victims. \u201d Ms. Laszlo apologized but has maintained that she was used as a tool to vilify Hungary\u2019s attitude toward migrants. She was also immediately fired by her employer, N1TV, a channel affiliated with the far right. \u201cWe are faced with a modern European folk tale,\u201d she told the weekly Heti Valasz after the incident. \u201cOn one side is the Nazi witch, on the other the anguished asylum seeker, who has a furnished home waiting for him in Spain and whose child is passing with Cristiano Ronaldo,\u201d she said, referring to the welcome Mr. Mohsen received in Spain after the story spread. Ms. Laszlo also repeated unfounded accusations that Mr. Mohsen was a member of a terrorist organization. It was unclear whether Ms. Laszlo, who has been avoiding publicity since the episode, would appear in court. A date for the trial has not yet been established.'"}, "time": 1742563261.2529604}
