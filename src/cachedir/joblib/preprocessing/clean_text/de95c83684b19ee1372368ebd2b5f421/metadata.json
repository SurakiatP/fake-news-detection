S. will \u201cmoderate its commitment\u201d to the organization. [\u201cI owe it to you all to give you clarity on the political reality in the United States, and to state the fair demand from my country\u2019s people in concrete terms,\u201d he said during a   meeting, according to remarks provided to reporters traveling with him. \u201cAmerica will meet its responsibilities, but if your nations do not want to see America moderate its commitment to the alliance, each of your capitals needs to show its support for our common defense. \u201d  During his presidential campaign, President Donald Trump had repeatedly called on NATO members to pay more for their   in Europe. Only five of 28 member nations had met a requirement to spend at least two percent of their GDP on defense: the United States, the United Kingdom, Estonia, Poland, and Greece. NATO members France and Germany currently spend 1. 78 percent and 1. 19 percent respectively, according to the NATO figures. According to the Washington Post, Mattis recalled that when he was NATO\u2019s supreme allied commander of transformation from November 2007 to September 2009,   Secretary Robert Gates warned NATO nations that America \u201cwould lose their patience for carrying a disproportionate burden\u201d of the defense of allies. Mattis said that impatience is now a \u201cgovernmental reality. \u201d \u201cNo longer can the American taxpayer carry a disproportionate share of the defense of Western values,\u201d he added. \u201cAmericans cannot care more for your children\u2019s security than you do. Disregard for military readiness demonstrates a lack of respect for ourselves, for the alliance and for the freedoms we inherited, which are now clearly threatened. \u201d The meeting comes ahead of a visit to NATO by Vice President Michael Pence on Monday. Before the   meeting, Mattis called NATO a \u201cfundamental bedrock. \u201d \u201cThe alliance remains a fundamental bedrock for the United States and for all the   community,\u201d he said. During his confirmation hearing, Mattis called the alliance \u201cthe most successful military alliance, probably in modern history, maybe ever. \u201d His first calls to foreign counterparts included NATO members, as well as NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. But he also said in responses provided to the Senate Armed Services Committee in advance of the hearing, \u201cmember states must share the burden of common defense, and meet or exceed the commitment to reach the two percent defense spending goal that their leaders set at the NATO summit in 2014. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564330.8084095}
