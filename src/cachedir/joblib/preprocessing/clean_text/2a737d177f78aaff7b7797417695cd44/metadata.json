When she has a difficult time sleeping, the queen will put on a raincoat and walk around the palace grounds, The Times reported, quoting a former guardsman. He was on patrol inside the palace walls at 3 a. m. on an unspecified day several years ago when he saw a figure in the darkness, according to reports. Thinking he had spotted an intruder, The Times said, he called out, \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cTo his surprise, it was the queen,\u201d according to the account. \u201c\u2018Bloody hell, Your Majesty, I nearly shot you,\u2019 he blurted out. \u201d Realizing his remarks were inappropriate, the guard expected to be rebuked. Instead, The Times reported, Her Majesty replied: \u201cThat\u2019s quite all right. Next time I\u2019ll ring through beforehand so you don\u2019t have to shoot me. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563858.898507}
