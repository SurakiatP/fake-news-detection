They might even be right! But Planned Parenthood, Big Abortion, is worse,\u201d proclaimed MILO. \u201cWe were all shocked when undercover tapes came out showing they are in the business of selling baby parts to the medical industry. Can you imagine, and I don\u2019t think this is a stretch, the senior leaders of Planned Parenthood sitting in a conference room discussing the best timing for an abortion, to maximize their profits from the dead baby\u2019s body? It\u2019s horrifying, and it\u2019s what feminists want more of. \u201d \u201cPlanned Parenthood can attribute a good portion of their boffo   business to their president since 2006, Cecile Richards,\u201d he continued. \u201cRichards is well on her way to personally matching Hitler\u2019s body count. We\u2019ve done the grim maths so you don\u2019t have to. \u201d \u201cUsing a conservative estimate of 300, 000 abortions a year  \u2014   or 300 kiloscrapes, using the technical metric measure  \u2014   Cecile Richards has presided over three million abortions, or three megascrapes in her ten years as president of the organisation,\u201d MILO stated. \u201cThis has earned her \u2018half Holocaust\u2019 status. Full Holocaust seems eminently reachable given Planned Parenthood\u2019s growing hegemony in the abortion industry. \u201d MILO continued to add that these statistics were just since \u201cRichards took charge,\u201d and didn\u2019t include abortions performed prior to 2006. \u201cPlanned Parenthood has since 1970 performed 7 million abortions, comfortably surpassing Hitler according to its own annual reports,\u201d added MILO. \u201cYou have to admire the chutzpah, if you\u2019ll forgive my terminology: Planned Parenthood has amassed a Third   death count completely legally and while pocketing half a billion dollars a year to do so. But under Richards the numbers have skyrocketed such that in just the last ten years, at least 3 million young lives were ended. \u201d \u201cIf Cecile stays in her post another decade, she will reach \u2018full Hitler,\u2019 by matching the six million deaths of the Holocaust. In fact it\u2019ll probably be sooner than that, given the acceleration in procedures during her reign,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe road ahead may be rocky. Besides the undercover videos still being released, some media sources are starting to cover the revolting practices of these sociopathic monsters. Nice normal people, whatever their views on abortion, have no stomach for these unashamed   activities. And perhaps President Trump will defund them. \u201d \u201cIf you need to hear more about Margaret Sanger, here\u2019s something she once said. She was inarguably racist,\u201d MILO explained. \u201cShe spoke glowingly about a presentation to a group of KKK women in New Jersey, and they loved her messaging about the black race. Messaging like this, in a letter to Dr. Clarence Gamble:\u201d We do not want word to get out that we want to exterminate the Negro population and the minister is the man who can straighten out the idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members. \u201cMargaret Sanger\u2019s goal was to diminish the black race, and one can argue she was at least partially successful. Stats about abortion by race are not always easy to find, but nonetheless paint a compelling picture about the race reality of abortion,\u201d proclaimed MILO. \u201cIn 2012, there were more black children aborted in New York City than born alive. More than 31, 000 compared to just under 25, 000 live births. Blacks accounted for 42% of the abortions in the city, with Hispanic women accounting for another 31%. That\u2019s 73% of all abortions in the city killing black and Hispanic youth. \u201d \u201cOther national data from the Center for   Reform asserts that black women are 3 times more likely to have an abortion than white women,\u201d he concluded. \u201cSo isn\u2019t it fascinating that intersectional   feminists fighting for abortion and so often    with Black Lives Matter? To any BLM members tucked away in the audience, I can conclusively say that feminists are one group that do not believe black lives matter at all. \u201d Written from prepared remarks.'"}, "time": 1742562696.9587512}
