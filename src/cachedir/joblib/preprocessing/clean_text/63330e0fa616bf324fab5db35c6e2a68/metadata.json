If you\u2019re at a wedding in the Philadelphia area, for instance, and hear the opening keyboard blasts of \u201cBefore I Let Go\u201d by Maze featuring Frankie Beverly, the secular spirit might compel you to the dance floor, spilling the \u201c   \u201d of the first few seconds behind you as you sprint. For more than a century,   children have had a hard time escaping \u201cThis Little Light of Mine. \u201d And then there\u2019s James Weldon Johnson and John Rosamond Johnson\u2019s \u201cLift Ev\u2019ry Voice and Sing,\u201d regarded as the black national anthem and so beautifully deceptive in its uplift that it makes you think you can sing even when you can\u2019t. But the blackest anthem that doesn\u2019t seem all that obviously black might be the one that opens \u201cThe Greatest,\u201d the biopic from 1977 of Muhammad Ali starring Muhammad Ali. It\u2019s \u201cThe Greatest Love of All,\u201d a song of such earnestness and fulgent   that under no circumstances could it also be cool, under no circumstances could it be \u201cBefore I Let Go. \u201d Its sense of hope borders on the axiomatic  \u2014   who doesn\u2019t believe that children are the future? If you were young, black and near a classroom in the late \u201970s or the \u201980s, this was the song you sang, especially to commemorate a matriculation benchmark. I sang it at least twice going from one grade to the next. George Benson recorded the original, which twinkled. In 1985, Whitney Houston recorded the astronomical,   version everybody knows  \u2014   a comet wrapped in cheese. That was the version my class had to sing. But I didn\u2019t feel particularly black when I did it. For one thing, there were a few white kids at my school. But when you\u2019re 9 or 10 and into lyrics, you notice how empowering  \u2014   and how fun  \u2014   these are to belt: \u201cLearning to love   is the greatest love of all. \u201d That\u2019s so Ali. He didn\u2019t write the song. That was Michael Masser and Linda Creed, two white people, two weeks after she underwent a mastectomy. Its nondenominational radiance is the reason for its longevity: We should all be loving ourselves. But I\u2019ve been hung up on what, for me, is the operative word. \u201cLearning. \u201d That\u2019s the black part: overcoming the institutional myth that there\u2019s less  \u2014   or nothing  \u2014   to love. Ali overcame it. He learned. Then he taught. We\u2019ve come some way since both 1977 and 1985. Now American culture is as much black culture as it\u2019s ever been: from handshakes and slang to the embrace of the booty. We\u2019ve learned to love it, and sometimes that\u2019s a problem. Other races refract themselves through the predominant prism of black culture. But in the years between Barack Obama\u2019s election and Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidential candidacy, with the concentrated accretion of seemingly wrongful   deaths, with outspoken activist movements, with more black people speaking so blackly  \u2014   influentially  \u2014   on   platforms, artists have put their blackness at the center of American popular culture. And yet it\u2019s a change from simply having just the artists there. They\u2019re learning to explore the politics of their blackness. There\u2019s too much going on at the moment for them not to. Things have taken such a turn into this sort of   that the charisma and racial stratagems of the flamboyantly ideological Johnnie Cochran have reappeared in two different O. J. Simpson television events. The black people shaping the culture have grown not just comfortable in their blackness but also defiant in its depiction, insistent in its inextricability from their art. They\u2019re investigating blackness, not exclusively in terms of racism but as a matter of ontology: What is it? That\u2019s the question that   Key and Jordan Peele transferred from their old Comedy Central show to \u201cKeanu,\u201d a disposable but slyly deep action comedy in which a black stoner and his preppy friend impersonate gangstas to rescue a cat. ABC\u2019s \u201c \u201d took its black existentialism into current events and   criticism for its most recent season. Black creators are making work that follows and reflects black life on the ground: the protests over the deaths of black Americans, often involving the police the demands for reforming prisons and changing the way the justice system treats black and Hispanic men the fury over Hollywood\u2019s indifference to sectors of the populace that straight white men don\u2019t exclusively inhabit. The visual side of \u201cLemonade,\u201d Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s    \u201cvisual album,\u201d steeps the songs in  : from the attire of the antebellum South to the legacies of black female struggle and strength. \u201cHey! I\u2019m a keep running,\u201d she sings. \u201c\u2019Cause a winner don\u2019t quit on themselves. \u201d That\u2019s Ali, too. In that same song, \u201cFreedom,\u201d Kendrick Lamar raps about himself as an object of persecution, by the news media and consequently by law enforcement. There\u2019s blackness  \u2014   the mere state of one\u2019s racial self  \u2014   and there\u2019s being politically black, which amounts to the degree to which one wields or weaponizes or calls attention to one\u2019s blackness. \u201cFreedom\u201d constitutes a wielding. This kind of blatant statement is new for Beyonc\u00e9, who before the advent of the Black Lives Matter movement was thoughtful about the politics of the beauty of black women\u2019s bodies, and since its arrival has wed the complexities of feminism and the vicissitudes of marriage with political blackness. She\u2019s learned. And people are listening. \u201cLemonade\u201d is the No. 2 album in the country. George C. Wolfe\u2019s new musical, \u201cShuffle Along,\u201d centers on that sort of wielding. But he wants you to do the learning. The musical rebuilds one of the first black shows to make it to Broadway, a forgotten pageant of song, dance and romantic comedy that ran for 484 performances 95 years ago and was also called \u201cShuffle Along. \u201d Mr. Wolfe works from the inside out, making his show about the making of the original show. His ambition gives the new musical a   quality. It\u2019s set entirely in its era. Yet every mouth that begins to sing  \u2014   and the singing here is astounding  \u2014   seems to open a portal that whisks 2016 back to 1921, bringing with it several eras in between. The history here lives, breathes and tap dances. And at its best, it cagily uses the pride of the present against the prejudice of the past. There\u2019s some suspense among the     show\u2019s creative team about whether white audiences will tolerate seeing two of the musical\u2019s stars embrace during a number. Mr. Wolfe casually juxtaposes that question with an affair between one of the stars, Lottie Gee (Audra McDonald) and Eubie Blake (Brandon Victor Dixon) the married half of the show\u2019s songwriting duo. The only person who\u2019d be offended by this nowadays would be Mrs. Blake. The tensions in the show are entirely  . Black people performing in blackface is the one thing that everyone in both periods would agree is a problem. And Mr. Wolfe doesn\u2019t overthink that. It is what it was, and what it was is  . Mr. Wolfe is after something sophisticatedly didactic if less immediately rousing  \u2014   the show\u2019s subtitle is \u201cOr, the Making of the Musical Sensation of 1921 and All That Followed. \u201d He wants the   of the old show to inform his winking reproduction. It also presumes the core ticket buyer is white, as was the case in the previous century. To that end, the 2016 show critiques, celebrates and speculates about the 1921 version while also finding the elated white audiences on both ends of the timeline inevitable. Instead of rage, you get affectionate hindsight that cuts the pervasive melancholy. The show\u2019s   creative team ended their collaboration more over money than racism. If it had managed to stay together, Mr. Wolfe wonders, imagine what it could have done for blacks in the American theater. That\u2019s a question more or less asked during the encyclopedia entry of a finale, but a poignant one. The historical irony (look at all the people of color on Broadway now!) cries out for the emotional pragmatism that closes \u201cThe Greatest Love of All\u201d: It\u2019s a low note for a soaring   anthem. (Houston sang it as if she were taking us to the moon.) But it\u2019s also black in that, like Mr. Wolfe\u2019s musical, it\u2019s got a touch of the blues. The matter that\u2019s also got Mr. Wolfe bummed out  \u2014   downright angry  \u2014   is the question of appropriation. It insinuates that George Gershwin stole from \u201cShuffle Along. \u201d It\u2019s a spurious charge but one meant to address the wider historical swamp of race, influence and theft. In the show\u2019s most chilling wink, he makes the white Harlem Renaissance gadfly Carl Van Vechten into a villainous scold who attacks the show while damning it to irrelevance. Maybe Van Vechten is right. Yet his condescension feels wrong. Black parlance has a word for all of this waking up: \u201cwoke. \u201d The meaning has expanded from black people\u2019s discovery and maintained awareness of trouble (\u201cStay woke! \u201d) to white people\u2019s acknowledgment of black trouble and also their awareness that sometimes the trouble lies with them. There\u2019s a symbiosis at work. At the same time that black artists are coming into a sharper phase of their blackness, white Americans are coming into their whiteness, reckoning with it and embracing it. Part of what\u2019s brought them to this identification of politicized whiteness is what\u2019s brought   minorities to their racial politics: oppression and injustice and anger. Earlier this week, Louis C. K. told the writer David Marchese, in a long, illuminating Q. and A. on Vulture, that white guys are doing fine. He was responding to a question about the sense of oppression coursing through the white male electorate. These guys feel they can\u2019t speak their mind anymore. So they\u2019re glad that Bernie Sanders and Mr. Trump are speaking for them. But Louis C. K. suspects cultural hypochondria. \u201cNobody\u2019s turning us down for a job,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that\u2019s being taken away from us. \u201d Of course, that\u2019s not entirely true. Some of the stuff being taken away from white people is stuff they previously took. Some of that stuff is being challenged, by the likes of Macklemore and Ryan Lewis, who in February released a brick of an album that, in part, atones for white privilege by incorporating white guilt. But that reclaiming is being done by filmmakers as well. Ava DuVernay\u2019s \u201cSelma\u201d shouldn\u2019t have seemed all that subversive. But the movies so frequently favor black stories from white perspectives that placing a crucial moment of the civil rights movement in the hands of black leadership constituted revolt. The actor Nate Parker has directed a film, due in the fall, about Nat Turner\u2019s slave rebellion that sets up a contrast with William Styron\u2019s novel \u201cThe Confession of Nat Turner\u201d from 1967 and implicitly rebukes D. W. Griffith\u2019s racist landmark, from 1915, which seduces you to root for the Ku Klux Klan. They\u2019re both called \u201cThe Birth of a Nation. \u201d There\u2019s even a revisionist version of \u201cRoots\u201d that isn\u2019t more than serviceable but is remarkably more handsome and better acted than the original. It\u2019s as much about black power as the original was concerned with narrative racial balance. Hey, Beyonc\u00e9, Kunta Kinte now breaks chains all by himself, too. The gist of some of this rethinking is defensive. Some of it\u2019s tentative, even the very best of it.  ? It does also feel, however, like artists learning  \u2014   how to be politically black and commercial, entertaining and listenable. And some of the country is learning with them. But having to learn also feels weirdly new. In the 1970s, when Ali owned American culture, and black movies and music weren\u2019t shy about black politics, there was nothing to be \u201cish\u201d about.'"}, "time": 1742561904.9159918}
