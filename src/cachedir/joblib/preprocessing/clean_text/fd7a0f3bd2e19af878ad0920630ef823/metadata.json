Prior to the election, I described the period of time ending on January 20th as \u201cthe danger zone\u201d, and my outlook has not changed just because Donald Trump was victorious on election night. As you will see, the next two months are an absolutely critical time, and if we can get through January 20th without something major happening perhaps we can breathe a little bit easier (at least for a while). On the other hand, the events of the next two months could easily plunge this country into a period of unprecedented chaos. A lot of people are feeling really good about things right now because of Trump\u2019s victory, but now is definitely not a time to relax and let down our guard. \\nAnd the truth is that Donald Trump has not even won the presidency yet. As I detailed shortly before election night , the next president will not be determined until December 19th when the Electoral College meets. \\nOn Monday, December 19th the members of the Electoral College will gather in all 50 state capitals to cast their votes for president. It is then, and only then, that the next president of the United States will be elected. \\nThroughout our history, electors have followed the will of the people more than 99 perfect of the time, but there have been \u201cfaithless electors\u201d before, and if Democrats can get enough of them to switch sides in December it is still possible (though not probable) that Hillary Clinton could win the election. \\nOne petition that is asking electors to switch their votes has already been signed by more than 4 million people. The petition claims that Donald Trump is \u201cunfit to serve\u201d as president, and that since Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by a wide margin she should be elected president instead. The following comes from a USA Today article entitled \u201c Could the Electoral College elect Hillary Clinton instead of Donald Trump? \u201c\u2026 \\nA Change.org petition, now signed by more than 4.3 million people, encourages members of the Electoral College to cast their votes for Hillary Clinton when the college meets on Dec. 19. The petition argues that Donald Trump is \u201cunfit to serve\u201d and that \u201cSecretary Clinton WON THE POPULAR VOTE and should be President.\u201d \\n\u201cIf they all vote the way their states voted, Donald Trump will win,\u201d the petition states. \u201cHowever, they can vote for Hillary Clinton if they choose. Even in states where that is not allowed, their vote would still be counted, they would simply pay a small fine \u2013 which we can be sure Clinton supporters will be glad to pay! We are calling on the Electors to ignore their states\u2019 votes and cast their ballots for Secretary Clinton.\u201d \\nPersonally, I don\u2019t believe that this is going to happen. They may be able to flip a few electors, but the gap in electoral votes is almost certainly too wide for the Democrats to overcome. \\nHowever, that is not the only concern we are facing. Ever since his victory on November 8th, there have been a multitude of violent threats against Donald Trump and his family. And without a doubt, there are a lot of very powerful people that would be very interested in finding a way to keep Donald Trump from getting to Inauguration Day. So let us pray for his safety and for the safety of his family. \\nIf Donald Trump were to be incapacitated after he wins the Electoral College vote on December 19th, Mike Pence would take his place. \\nBut if something were to happen to him before December 19th, his electors would be free to vote for another candidate \u2013 including Hillary Clinton. \\nIf everything goes smoothly and Donald Trump successfully makes it to Inauguration Day, he could be facing one of the biggest political protests in United States history. \\nIn an article for The Most Important News , I showed that the far left is calling for thousands upon thousands of protesters to descend upon Washington D.C. on January 20th in order to disrupt the Inauguration festivities as much as possible. \\nThis giant protest is being organized by the usual suspects, and they have already put up Facebook pages , websites , and the hashtag \u201c#DisruptJ20\u2033 is being widely used all over social media. \\nTraditionally Inauguration Day is a day of joy and celebration, but the far left seems intent on transforming it into a massive riot. \\nLet us hope that they are not successful. \\nAnother reason why we will be in \u201cthe danger zone\u201d over the next two months is because of what Barack Obama may choose to do at the United Nations. \\nNow that it looks like Donald Trump is going to be our next president, the international pressure on Barack Obama to do something at the United Nations regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict before the end of his term has become even more intense. \\nAnd this is something that Trump and his advisers are actively concerned about. In fact, I came across an article earlier today that discussed the fact that the Trump team is warning Obama \u201cagainst making moves on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in his last months in office\u201d \u2026 \\nSaying that pushing agendas \u201ccontrary to the president-elect\u2019s position\u201d would not be in the \u201cspirit of the transition\u201d, Trump national security advisor for Donald Trump last week warned the Obama administration against making moves on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in his last months in office. \\n\u201cOn big, transformative issues where President Obama and President-elect Trump are not in alignment, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in keeping with the spirit of the transition\u2026to try to push through agenda items that are contrary to the president-elect\u2019s positions,\u201d the advisor told Politico . \\nSpecifically, the concern is that Obama may decide to support a UN Security Council resolution that would officially recognize a Palestinian state, set the parameters for a \u201ctwo state solution\u201d, and establish East Jerusalem as the capital for the new Palestinian state. \\nJust a few weeks ago, an article in the Wall Street Journal entitled \u201c Obama\u2019s Israel Surprise? \u201d reported that this is one of the options that the Obama administration is strongly considering right now. A UN Security Council resolution would be legally binding on both Israel and the Palestinians, and it would be something that President Trump would not be able to undo. \\nThe rest of the UN Security Council is eager to support such a resolution, and so the decision about whether this resolution is going to happen or not sits in the hands of Barack Obama, and at this moment we do not know what he is going to do. The following comes from an article by Leo Hohmann \u2026 \\nThe Wall Street Journal reported one week before Tuesday\u2019s election that Obama had requested his aides provide him with a list of options to deal with the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. \\nIsraeli diplomats, according to the WSJ story, are preparing for the possibility that a lame-duck President Obama \u201cmay try to force a diplomatic resolution for Israel and the Palestinians at the United Nations.\u201d \\nThe president is presumably now reviewing those options, which number about half a dozen. \\nHe may be preparing to recognize a Palestinian state at the U.N. before he leaves office , WSJ reported. \\nIf Barack Obama decides to divide the land of Israel at the United Nations, it will be the worst decision of his entire presidency. I have warned repeatedly that all hell will break loose in America if it happens, and it will also mean that many of the events that I warn about in my latest book are much closer than many had been anticipating. \\nBut if we can get to January 20th and the land of Israel has not been divided yet, we may be able to rest easy for at least a little while, because Trump has already said that he would not support a UN Security Council resolution that forces a solution on the Israelis and Palestinians. \\nWhen politicians are going to do something that they know people won\u2019t like, they tend to try to sneak it through around the holidays when a lot of people aren\u2019t paying attention. For example, yesterday I discussed how the legislation that created the Federal Reserve was rushed through Congress right before Christmas in 1913 . \\nSo keep an eye on the period around Thanksgiving and the period around Christmas. If Barack Obama is going to stab Israel in the back, it may happen during one of those times. \\nMy hope is that we can get through January 20th without anything going seriously wrong. If that happens, I know that I will be very thankful. \\nAnd as I detailed in a previous article , Donald Trump will be 70 years, 7 months and 7 days old on his first full day in office on January 21st, and that will happen in year 5777 on the Hebrew calendar. \\nCould that be a sign of better things ahead as many believe? \\nOr will the next two months set off a chain of events that will be absolutely disastrous for this nation? \\nI believe that this is an absolutely critical moment in our history, and let us hope that our leaders make the right decisions. \\n\u201cDanger Zone\u201d Brings back memories of Kenny Loggins and Top Gun. anonymous \\nListen to her howlin\u2019 roar Metal under tension Beggin\u2019 you to touch and go Highway to the Danger Zone Ride into the Danger Zone Headin\u2019 into twilight Spreadin\u2019 out her wings tonight She got you jumpin\u2019 off the deck And shovin\u2019 into overdrive Highway to the Danger Zone I\u2019ll take you Right into the Danger Zone William Lutz \\nI will not celebrate the holidays this year!

You are painting with a broad religious brush. What is God? Isn\u2019t God a Spirit? What do you know of death? Have you died? You are clearly biased. df NJ \\nGod is unknowable force that motivates the electrons to move and have charge. Without God, time would cease to exist. Paul Benson \\nWrong again df NJ (Dumb Friend from New Jersey?) God has gone to great extremes to make himself knowable. When Jesus died on the Cross the veil of the Temple was torn by god from top to bottom as a sign the way into his presence had been given. Put your faith in Jesus, follow his teaching, and that path will lead you to the Father and eternal life. YOU CAN KNOW GOD! Mondobeyondo \\nMerry Hallothanksmaskwanzaanewyear! nick \\nI am a political atheist, just to set the record straight. Although I visit this site fairly often, it is showing signs of paranoia and provoking fear. When George W. as elected, there were many protesters, they were just hidden away in \u201cfree speech\u201d zones. Of course there are many unhappy people, as there were in 2000, and every election. Trumps votes were less than 19% of the 325 million people in the country. Will Trump bring jobs. No, not unless they are gov\u2019t employees, or funded by taxes. There is only one way jobs are created, and that is when there is demand for products and services. A lot of people with their low paying jobs can hardly afford the basic necessities, let alone keep playing the consumerism game. I cannot see Obama doing anything that requires legislation, as he is lame duck status now. Perhaps this site needs to focus on the swamp getting filled with more careerists, especially lobbyists I have been an expat for over 6 years, it is a lovely peaceful warm day here. Think I will go for a bicycle ride, then a dip in 86 degree seawater. I do have faith that not much will change and the sun will continue to rise, even when it is obscured by clouds. Peace and Love\u2026it is the only way df NJ \\nObama\u2019s big political move will be to appoint an ultra liberal judge to the bench during the recess. I just can\u2019t imagine that he doesn\u2019t leave office without punishing the Republicans for not taking Garland. And given all the threats to taking away all of Obama\u2019s legacy this is the only thing left he has to make his mark on history. Rick \\nI don\u2019t think he can do that with a phone and pen. Sorry. HeyAHuman \\nCould you imagine the pandemonium that would ensue if the Electoral College were to vote Hillary in? Then we\u2019d be in a REAL danger zone\u2026 Mondobeyondo \\nYes, it would be. It would be like the Krakatoa volcano erupting again. df NJ \\nThat is not going to happen because the electors hate Hillary as much as you do. It would be like cutting off one of your own fingers with a kitchen knife. I think we are okay. anonymous \\nIt always amazes me that people will look for signs in anything. Remember the world was going to end in the year 2000? Then again in 2012 with the end of the Mayan Calendar. \\n\u201cUncertainty is the only certainty there is, and knowing how to live with insecurity is the only security.\u201d \\n-John Allen Paulos df NJ \\nIt\u2019s 11/18 and still no second coming of Jesus.

By the way, 2000 & 2012 were LSM saying it was ending. I guess for you the fact Trump will be 70 years 7 months 7 days old on his first full day of office is coincidence? You see coincidence; believers see signs.

As a crook himself, he has received a free pass because of his so called \u201creligious\u201d connections. Bull caca! Occult religions maybe. Mondobeyondo \\nYes, there is still a possibility that Hillary Clinton could still get in the Oval Office. But a Trump presidency is pretty much a done deal (knock on wood). The Secret Service had better guard him and his family VERY closely. From what I\u2019ve seen and heard, President Obama is trying to make Trump\u2019s transition to the presidency very peaceful and orderly (even though they hate each other). Let\u2019s hope that Trump\u2019s presidency will be a successful one, and that it heals the many divisions and other issues that plague our country. Back in 1985, I bought a brand new book called \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d at my college bookstore. It was written by some guy named Donald Trump. Yes, I actually did read it. df NJ \\nNot a chance. Hillary is dead and gone. Mondobeyondo \\nBarack Obama is actually liberal enough to sign a resolution that would divide the land of Israel. Donald Trump would have to be pressured by outside forces to make such a decision. Would he do it? Don\u2019t know.

You criticize the left but you just don\u2019t understand it. Here\u2019s how the left thinks: \\n\u201cAn old English judge once said: \u2018Necessitous men are not free men.\u2019 Liberty requires opportunity to make a living \u2013 a living decent according to the standard of the time, a living which gives man not only enough to live by, but something to live for. \\n\u201cFor too many of us the political equality we once had won was meaningless in the face of economic inequality. A small group had concentrated into their own hands an almost complete control over other people\u2019s property, other people\u2019s money, other people\u2019s labor \u2013 other people\u2019s lives. For too many of us life was no longer free; liberty no longer real; men could no longer follow the pursuit of happiness. \\nAgainst economic tyranny such as this, the American citizen could appeal only to the organized power of government. \u201d \\nYou many not agree with this approach but ALL the evidence shows wealth inequality is at all time highs. Most of you right wingers claim we have too much socialism and communism in this country. The sad fact is we cannot be further way from communism and still have a currency with any shred of value. \\nBut do not fear. Every year the top 1% become richer and richer. Every year the middle class is driven deeper and deeper into poverty wages. Marx said laissez faire capitialism is always followed by communism because unfettered greed would result in a government\u2019s currency collapse. Once the currency collapses people in bread lines will DEMAND more government not less. \\nSee you in the breadlines comrades! \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0434\u043d\u044f JC Teecher \\nIt is fairly evident that B Hussein Odrama is spewing his NWO rhetoric and propaganda overseas, as he attempts to assume the role of the world\u2019s authoritarian.
