There are lots of Tims. \\n\u201cBut when I asked what he did for a living, he replied \u2018Aside from the obvious?\u2019 and told me actually it\u2019s a very demanding position despite what happened last year, which left me no nearer. \\n\u201cHe does know Nick Clegg. Still, I suppose so do lots of people.\u201d \\nSusan Traherne, who hosted the party, admitted she has known Tim since university but has never really been sure of his occupation. \\nShe said: \u201cHe was planning to go into politics but I never heard anything else about it so assumed he\u2019d given up on the idea.
