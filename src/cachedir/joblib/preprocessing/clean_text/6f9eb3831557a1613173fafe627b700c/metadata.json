Posted on Oct 28, 2016 Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton argued over foreign policy during the third presidential debate. (Screen shot via YouTube ) \\nWe are only 10 days away from Election Day, and the two mainstream candidates are steamrolling through the swing states in an effort to court votes. Over the past week, WikiLeaks provided some revelations on how Clinton and her husband used the Clinton Foundation to their advantage. Donald Trump, meanwhile, continued to close in on Clinton in the polls. \\nThe week began on a somber note, when news broke that longtime peace activist and California legislator Tom Hayden died at age 76. His original Truthdig reports , which have been reposted throughout the week, reinforce the importance of an anti-war foreign policy. \u201cOur systems\u2014politics, media, culture\u2014are totally out of balance today because of our collective refusal to admit that the Vietnam War was wrong and that the peace movement was right,\u201d he said in 2016 . \\nMany of his reports written back in 2006 focus on American foreign policy in the Middle East. Although written over a decade ago, Hayden\u2019s words of caution still ring true, as in this piece on a potential U.S. withdrawal from Iraq : \\nMany activists are learning for the first time, or perhaps all over again, what it means to be winter soldiers in a long war. All the wasted lives can never be brought back, all those squandered tax dollars will never be redistributed, true enough. But if the war itself was never going to be a cakewalk, why should ending it be any different? It may still be far from over, with the simmering question of Iran on the immediate horizon. \\nAs Hayden warned, U.S. involvement in the Middle East is far from over, and throughout this election season a new player has entered the arena: Russia. \\nEarlier this week, Trump stated that Clinton, if elected, would cause World War III with Russia. Truthdig contributor Juan Cole argued that \u201c[s]uperpowers don\u2019t fight one another in the nuclear age\u2026[they] fight proxy wars like Vietnam and Afghanistan.\u201d Cole asserts that Clinton\u2019s experience as secretary of state will make it easy for her to communicate with the Russian government and the Pentagon alike. \\nOthers, however, don\u2019t feel too positive about a potential Clinton administration\u2019s foreign policy. Clinton has proposed a \u201cno-fly\u201d zone over Syria as part of her foreign policy plan, alarming security experts . \\nAs Lauren McCauley writes, reports also surfaced this week showing how a Clinton administration \u201cwill likely usher in a more aggressive, bipartisan foreign policy in the Middle East and beyond.\u201d She quotes Greg Jaffe: \\nThe Republicans and Democrats who make up the foreign policy elite are laying the groundwork for a more assertive American foreign policy via a flurry of reports shaped by officials who are likely to play senior roles in a potential Clinton White House,\u201d the Washington Post\u2019s White House correspondent Greg Jaffe reports. \\nOne such study, published Wednesday by the Center for American Progress (CAP)\u2014which is run by president Neera Tanden, policy director for Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign\u2014recommends the next administration step up its \u201cmilitary engagement\u201d amid a more \u201cproactive and long-term approach to the Middle East.\u201d \\nBut what of Trump\u2019s foreign policy? Juan Cole also argued earlier this week that when it comes to Trump\u2019s assertions on the U.S. presence in the Middle East, \u201che doesn\u2019t have the slightest idea of what he is talking about.\u201d \\nTruthdig\u2019s own Bill Boyarsky expressed a similar concern in his column this week, labeling Trump \u201ca threat to democracy.\u201d \\n\u201cTrump\u2019s scorn for the electoral system and democratic institutions is reason enough to fear a Trump presidency,\u201d Boyarsky writes. \u201cAdded to that is his racist rabble-rousing against Muslims, those of Mexican descent and other immigrants.\u201d \\nAnd of course, the discussion on foreign policy doesn\u2019t solely revolve around just two presidential nominees. This week, NATO urged \u201call allies to deploy more troops and military equipment to Russia\u2019s borders\u201d in a move that Common Dreams staff writer Nika Knight called \u201cshortsighted.\u201d \\nThere is also an inherent problem with the American military spending, says William D. Hartung, director of the Arms and Security Project at the Center for International Policy. \u201cThrough good times and bad, regardless of what\u2019s actually happening in the world, one thing is certain: in the long run, the Pentagon budget won\u2019t go down,\u201d he writes. \u201cAs long as fear, greed, and hubris are the dominant factors driving Pentagon spending, no matter who is in the White House, substantial and enduring budget reductions are essentially inconceivable.\u201d \\nSo although there are broader, deeply embedded institutional factors responsible for American foreign policy, whoever wins on November 8 will certainly make an impact. Given the events of the past week\u2014the focus on increased tensions with Russia, and the tightening race between Clinton and Trump\u2014we turn to you, our readers. Which candidate has a foreign policy position worth pursuing? Will Clinton\u2019s experience, although \u201cwar hawkish,\u201d serve in her favor, or will Trump\u2019s business acumen serve him better as Commander in Chief? \\nLet us know in the poll below.
