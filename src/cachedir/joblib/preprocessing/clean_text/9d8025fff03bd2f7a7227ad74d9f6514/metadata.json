He suggested that that Obamacare would have been rejected if the penalties for going without health insurance were interpreted as taxes.\\n\u201cIf CBO scored the (individual) mandate as taxes, the bill dies,\u201d Gruber said.\\n\u201cIf you had a law that made it explicit that healthy people are going to pay in and sick people are going to get subsidies, it would not have passed,\u201d he added.\\nAs the AP reported yesterday, the Obama Administration has confirmed that premiums will sharply rise under the Obamacare law, with many consumers left with only one insurer to choose from.\\nPremiums for a midlevel benchmark plan will increase on average 25% across 39 states served by the federally run online market, according to a report from the Department of Health and Human Services.\\n\u201cConsumers will be faced this year with not only big premium increases but also with a declining number of insurers participating, and that will lead to a tumultuous open enrollment period,\u201d Larry Levitt, who tracks the health care law for the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, told the Associated Press .
