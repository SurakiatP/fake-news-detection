It\u2019s mostly the hair. On a recent Saturday, following a dayslong spate of promotional appearances and photo shoots, the    internet supernova, who found fame online and beyond this year with a series of catchy mixtapes and goofy viral moments, hoped to do a little shopping in the heart of Brooklyn. But before he could peacefully enter Kith, the streetwear store that specializes in sneakers and sugary cereal, Lil Yachty needed to hide his trademark accessory: his   skinny braids adorned with clear plastic beads. As his chauffeured S. U. V. approached the buzzing shop, the Atlanta rapper grabbed a knit cap from the head of a friend, who assented without a word, seemingly familiar with the routine. It worked. Locks tucked atop his head, Lil Yachty, whose face is usually obscured by the clacking tentacles, proved unrecognizable even to those who may have binged on his whimsical music videos or Instagram account. Like a millennial Clark Kent, he went unbothered in the maw of his target demographic, drawing stares only as he stacked five pairs of shoes and two art books (\u201cPharrell,\u201d \u201cKAWS\u201d) by the register. As with the   spree, there was still some thrill in needing to go undercover. \u201cAt the beginning of this year, I used to walk through the local mall and say, \u2018One day, I\u2019m not going to be able to walk through this mall,\u2019\u201d Lil Yachty said later in the privacy of a Caribbean restaurant, his hair since released. \u201cNo way I could walk through the mall now. Unless I\u2019m hiding. \u201d Last winter, the teenager born Miles McCollum, who had recently dropped out of college and had been arrested in a Florida mall for credit card fraud, was hoping to shake his anonymity. Rapping was a relatively new pastime (it still is) though striving for fame came naturally to a diligent student of social networks. \u201cI always knew I was going to be something,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what. \u201d Now, at the end of a   2016, Lil Yachty seems more certain. \u201cI\u2019m not a rapper, I\u2019m an artist,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m more than an artist. I\u2019m a brand. \u201d The stats back him up. In addition to releasing the popular \u201cLil Boat\u201d and \u201cSummer Songs 2\u201d mixtapes, filled with his taffylike digital wails and cartoon melodies, and reaching No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 with his    guest verse on D. R. A. M.\u2019s \u201cBroccoli,\u201d Lil Yachty has modeled Kanye West\u2019s Yeezy line at Madison Square Garden, starred in a Sprite commercial with LeBron James and teamed up with Nautica on a capsule collection for Urban Outfitters. An official debut album with Capitol Records is planned for early 2017. Yet even among the bevy of singular voices in the new Atlanta   scene, where male rappers can wear dresses and carry designer bags, moan about their feelings and dance with their hips, Lil Yachty is demonstrably odd, flaunting his indifference to rap traditionalism and aiming to remain somewhat wholesome: more schoolyard than trap house. \u201cRappers don\u2019t have endorsements because of their images,\u201d he said. \u201cEndorsement money is huge. And I care about my character. \u201d He added: \u201cI don\u2019t rap about drinking or smoking, ever, because I don\u2019t do it. I don\u2019t rap about anything I don\u2019t do. \u201d Instead, Lil Yachty preaches an   positivity fueled by timeless adolescent ambitions: chasing girls, looking cool and hanging out with friends. (Lil Yachty\u2019s crew is known as the Sailing Team: \u201cIf you\u2019re a fan of me, then you know my friends, because I push them just as hard. \u201d) His most menacing raps can feel playful, his sexuality disarmingly juvenile and his boasts betray his age: \u201cParents mad at my ass \u2019cause their kids sing my song in class,\u201d he taunts while proclaiming himself the King of the Teens. \u201cWe are the youth!\u201d goes another battle cry. As with his breakout viral hits \u201c1 Night\u201d and \u201cMinnesota,\u201d Lil Yachty\u2019s music relies less on technical rapping than on simple melodies that invoke warped nursery rhymes, with bright, bubbly production and an affecting falsetto smoothed with  . Along with Kanye West and Kid Cudi, both of whom count as elder statesmen to someone born in 1997, his most direct influences include the   outre internet rappers Lil B and Soulja Boy, along with pop acts like Coldplay, Daft Punk and Fall Out Boy. While modeling for Nautica last month to his own personal playlist, Lil Yachty mimed air guitar to \u201cParadise City\u201d by Guns N\u2019 Roses and boogied to Elton John\u2019s \u201cBennie and the Jets\u201d when he wasn\u2019t belting Chris Martin ballads. Between looks, he dined on his preferred menu of Domino\u2019s pepperoni pizza, candy and cookies, head buried in his two Louis   iPhones. (One had a   message: \u201cLETS BE RICH FOREVER. \u201d) At the same time, Lil Yachty\u2019s stated indifference toward the catalogs of Tupac and the Notorious B. I. G. has made him a punching bag for rap purists, the poster child for a    new school dismissively dubbed \u201cmumble rap. \u201d He\u2019s leaned into that mantle, so online schadenfreude bubbles up every time Lil Yachty, say, bombs a freestyle over \u201990s beats or fails miserably at dunking a basketball. \u201cI ask myself all the time, \u2018How do I always go viral? \u2019\u201d Lil Yachty said with a grin. \u201cI\u2019m the face of the youth, the new sound. Nobody likes my truth. \u201d Except the youth, that is. \u201cThey relate to me because I\u2019m so like them,\u201d he said, \u201cbut on a global scale. \u201d Music, it turns out, was something of an afterthought, despite his deep roots in Southern rap. Though he was raised mostly by his mother in the Atlanta suburb Austell, his father, Shannon McCollum, lived in the city and worked as a photographer with local acts such as Outkast, Goodie Mob and Lil Jon. But hanging around stars as a child bolstered Lil Yachty\u2019s sense of style and business acumen more than his sense of   history. \u201cI would let him help direct photo shoots, and I would always show him my invoices so he could see what I made,\u201d Mr. McCollum, 46, said. \u201cI used to photograph Miles every week. By 3 or 4, he was so comfortable in front of a camera. \u201d An obsession with fashion followed. \u201cOnce, when he was about 7, we were picking up his friend, and Miles had on a pink polo shirt,\u201d his father recalled. \u201cThe little boy got in the back seat and started laughing uncontrollably at Miles, calling him a girl. Miles just said, \u2018You don\u2019t know nothing about this, man. \u2019\u201d In high school, influenced by the bright colors favored by Pharrell Williams and Tyler, the Creator, Lil Yachty would spend the money he earned working at McDonald\u2019s or as an assistant to his father at thrift stores. \u201c  cents, 50 cents, I just knew how to put it together,\u201d he said. His mother even taught him to sew. His confidence and originality helped to win over his eventual manager, Coach K, an Atlanta stalwart who has worked with Young Jeezy, Gucci Mane and Migos. \u201cIt was like your first meeting with Marilyn Manson,\u201d Coach K said of encountering Lil Yachty. \u201cYou\u2019ve got this freakish look, but he\u2019s not scared of who he is. He\u2019s wearing it with pride. Instantly I said, \u2018This is it. \u2019\u201d Lil Yachty had already determined that packaging a mystique was his strong suit. After graduating from high school, he traveled repeatedly to New York and Los Angeles  \u2014   his father\u2019s day job at Delta gave him access to free flights  \u2014   where he slept on couches and worked to ingratiate himself with   tastemakers like Ian Connor and Luka Sabbat. \u201cI was simply trying to get people who had an audience to hang out with me, so that I could get that audience,\u201d Lil Yachty said. \u201cI was making music, but I wasn\u2019t really pushing it yet. I knew exactly how it worked. \u201d He corrected himself. \u201cI know exactly how it works. \u201d Still, even he has been surprised by the speed of his ascent. \u201cIt just feels like a dream,\u201d he said, recalling that in January, he couldn\u2019t make it past the door of Kanye\u2019s studio. \u201cI sat in the hallway for hours while ASAP Rocky was in there. They wouldn\u2019t let me in. By August, I was working with him. \u201d Nautica, too, came calling only after a year of Lil Yachty\u2019s attempting to get the maritime brand\u2019s attention via social media. It was backstage among the V. I. P.s at Jay Z\u2019s Made in America festival in September that Lil Yachty\u2019s new reality started to sink in. \u201cObama\u2019s daughters knew who I was,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were huge fans. Jay Z said my name to me before I introduced myself. \u201d And yet, persona aside, a teenager can only be a teenager. At an Urban Outfitters    in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, among decidedly less dazzling guests, the rapper hid once again behind his hair and phone as overeager young fans offered him anything they could find to autograph: $5 bills, laptops, water bottles, purses, coats and, yes, eventually breasts. Not yet immune to such attention at close range, Lil Yachty could only giggle to himself, shaking his head as he mouthed the words to his own music.'"}, "time": 1742564323.3472433}
