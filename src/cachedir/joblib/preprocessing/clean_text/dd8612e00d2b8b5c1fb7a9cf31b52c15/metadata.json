It told her what she surely already knew: she had won gold, her first of the Rio Games, and she had crushed her own world record. \u201cTo see the 56 up there feels really good,\u201d Ledecky said, referring to her time, 3 minutes 56. 46 seconds. Her previous record was 3:58. 37. Jazz Carlin of Britain won silver in 4:01. 23, and Ledecky\u2019s teammate Leah Smith was third in 4:01. 92. It was the 12th world record Ledecky has set since the 2012 London Olympics. She skipped the 3:57s altogether, but that was her plan. She said a 3:56 had been her goal for the past three years. She needed only 28. 92 seconds to cover the final 50 meters, a burst that is not supposed to happen in this event. \u201cI just let it all out,\u201d she said. Only two women have gone under four minutes: Ledecky and Italy\u2019s Federica Pellegrini, who twice accomplished the feat in 2009 while wearing the   buoyant suits that since have been banned. Ledecky, a rising freshman at Stanford, was the first to surpass 3:59 when she set the previous mark, a 3:58. 37 at the 2014 Pan Pacific Championships. She now owns the 10 fastest performances in the 400. Ledecky\u2019s victory is the first gold medal of these Olympics for American swimmers, and it came the day after she made her Olympic sprint debut, anchoring the U. S.   freestyle relay that earned the silver medal and set an American record. Ledecky, who will defend her Olympic title in the 800 freestyle later this week, increased her stroke rate for the   race. Her coach, Bruce Gemmell, had to remind Ledecky to slow her tempo for the   race to avoid, in her words, \u201cspinning my wheels. \u201d A few minutes after Ledecky\u2019s victory, the United States men\u2019s 4x100 relay won gold. The foursome of Caeleb Dressel, Michael Phelps, Ryan Held and Nathan Adrian beat France and the favorites, Australia. Bob Bowman, the men\u2019s coach, credited Ledecky with an assist. \u201cWhen you see an otherworldly swim like that the guys know they have to step up,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cHow can you not be inspired when you see something like that?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742628454.1217215}
