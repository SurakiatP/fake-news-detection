In 2013, Bernardo Bertolucci, the director of the film, confirmed that Ms. Schneider wasn\u2019t told ahead of time that Mr. Brando would use butter as a lubricant for the simulated sex because he \u201cwanted Maria to feel, not to act, the rage and the humiliation. \u201d Mr. Bertolucci\u2019s comments did not receive widespread attention at the time, but rocketed into prominence over the weekend after they resurfaced in media reports about a Spanish nonprofit\u2019s publicity campaign about violence against women. Several prominent figures in Hollywood responded on social media with anger toward Mr. Bertolucci and Mr. Brando, while wondering why Ms. Schneider\u2019s story was not better known. \u201cInexcusable,\u2019\u2019 Ava DuVernay, a filmmaker, said on Twitter. \u201cAs a director, I can barely fathom this. As a woman, I am horrified, disgusted and enraged by it. \u201d Chris Evans, an actor, said on Twitter: \u201cI will never look at this film, Bertolucci or Brando the same way again. This is beyond disgusting. I feel rage. \u201d Ms. Schneider was an unknown    French actress paid $4, 000 for her part in \u201cLast Tango,\u201d in which her torrid affair with an American businessman, played by a    Mr. Brando, included explicit sex scenes that shocked audiences. The scene in which Mr. Brando pins her to the floor and appears to force anal intercourse remains one of the enduring images from the film, and was part of the reason The Motion Picture Association of America gave the film an X rating. It was critically acclaimed Mr. Brando, who died at 80 in 2004, received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor, while Mr. Bertolucci, 76, was nominated for Best Director. Ms. Schneider was not nominated but emerged as a sex symbol she had several leading roles in the 1970s, but her acting career declined later in the decade, while her personal life was marred by drug abuse and at least one suicide attempt. In 2011, she died of cancer at age 58. In an interview with The Daily Mail in 2007, she said the rape scene, which was shot in one take, left her feeling humiliated and attacked by both Mr. Brando and Mr. Bertolucci. \u201cThat scene wasn\u2019t in the original script. The truth is, it was Marlon who came up with the idea,\u201d Ms. Schneider said. \u201cI should have called my agent or had my lawyer come to the set because you can\u2019t force someone to do something that isn\u2019t in the script, but at the time, I didn\u2019t know that. \u201d Mr. Bertolucci said in 2013 that he and Mr. Brando thought of including butter in the scene on the morning it was filmed and purposely kept Ms. Schneider in the dark. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell her what was going on because I wanted her reaction as a girl, not as an actress,\u201d he said. He said that Ms. Schneider hated him until her death, but the tactic was necessary to obtain the effect. \u201cI feel guilty,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u201cbut I do not regret. \u201d While Ms. Schneider\u2019s statements in her 2007 interview did not go unnoticed  \u2014   they figured prominently in her obituary in The New York Times  \u2014   neither it nor Mr. Bertolucci\u2019s 2013 interview instantly received the kind of widespread attention that both gained this weekend. El Mundo de Alycia, a Spanish nonprofit, posted the video of Mr. Bertolucci\u2019s interview to YouTube as part of a protest against violence against women in November. It began appearing in   outlets, including Elle, on Friday, and celebrities soon responded in force. In a statement on Monday, Mr. Bertolucci called the flap \u201ca ridiculous misunderstanding. \u201d \u201cSomebody thought, and thinks, that Maria had not been informed about the violence on her. That is false!\u201d he said in the statement, according to Variety. \u201cMaria knew everything because she had read the script, where it was all described,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe only novelty was the idea of the butter. And that, as I learned many years later, offended Maria. Not the violence that she is subjected to in the scene, which was written in the screenplay. \u201d Those responding on Twitter included several   actors in Hollywood. Others on Twitter wondered why it took so long for the outrage to form.'"}, "time": 1742563942.148275}
