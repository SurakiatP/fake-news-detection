Carrie Monosmith, environmental health chief in the drinking water office, said the DEQ hadn\u2019t received any comments. \\nMany Michigan residents feel Nestle has a lot of nerve asking for the increase, in light of Flint\u2019s years-long nightmare over lead contamination in their drinking water. Many people in Flint still rely on bottled water for cooking, cleaning, and bathing as the government continues to drag its feet in replacing the corroded pipes. \\nNestle representatives defended the company\u2019s efforts to pump more groundwater, saying the \u201cU.S. market for bottled water in general is driving the bid for more Michigan groundwater.\u201d \\nThat\u2019s right, America. Nestle says it\u2019s your fault. \\nIf that\u2019s not infuriating enough, Nestle gets to pump that water for free. Under state law, private property owners may withdraw from the aquifer under their property for free. The only cost is $200 in annual paperwork. \\nThe interstate Great Lakes compact prohibits water diversions outside of the Great Lakes basin, but a loophole in the law allows water to be sold outside the region, so long as it is shipped in bottles smaller than 5.7 gallons. \\nJeff Ostahowski, vice president of the Michigan Citizens for Water Conservation (MCWC), asks: \\n\u201cThe issue is the privatization of a critical resource. How much is too much?\u201d \\nFor years, MCWC has battled against Nestle to prevent it from expanding in the state. \\nAccording to Nestle and the DEQ, an environmental review shows the aquifer can withstand the proposed increase in pumping, and that it won\u2019t hurt its flow, levels, or temperature of nearby surface waters.\""}, "time": 1742562096.1773288}
