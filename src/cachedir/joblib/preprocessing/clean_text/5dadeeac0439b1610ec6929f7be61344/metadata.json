A. titles and been selected for the   Game 11 times. The Miami Heat, however, do not want him to step on the court for them this season, or perhaps ever again. In one of the strangest and most ethically challenging standoffs in sports history, Bosh and the Heat are locked in a dispute over whether he should be deemed medically fit to play after dealing with serious health problems. With training camp scheduled to start this week, Bosh says he is ready to go. The Heat say he is not. Bosh\u2019s last two seasons have been cut short by blood clots. He has indicated that he has worked with a private physician to devise therapies that would allow him to play. The Heat are less certain. Bosh is owed about $76 million over the next three seasons whether he plays or not. So if the team is, in fact, looking out for Bosh\u2019s welfare, it suggests an exception to what is perhaps a more common practice of pro sports franchises: pushing players to compete regardless of medical concerns. The Heat announced their conclusion, citing a medical exam, after Bosh\u2019s recent emergence from a   cocoon of silence to wage a public battle with the team\u2019s medical staff. Bosh has done several interviews with Uninterrupted  \u2014   his former teammate LeBron James\u2019s digital platform for athletes  \u2014   in which he has sought to make his case. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll be there,\u201d he said about training camp on a recent Uninterrupted podcast. \u201cWill I be cleared? I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s out of my hands. I will play basketball in the N. B. A. I\u2019m confident. \u201d People with blood clots typically take   medication, which is probably one of the most daunting hurdles for Bosh. Athletes who are on blood thinners are advised to avoid contact sports because of an increased chance of internal bleeding and other complications. Even an elbow to the ribs could cause significant damage, said Dr. David Forsh, the chief of orthopedic trauma at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in Manhattan. \u201cThere are a lot of risks,\u201d he said. Bosh experienced his first known clotting problem in February 2015. He had cramps, spasms and shortness of breath, although he tried to hide his symptoms, he said. Bosh recalled one particular instance when he was in pain until 3 or 4 in the morning and the Heat were scheduled to face the Dallas Mavericks the next day. Bosh played because the Heat were already  . \u201cNot the best thing to do,\u201d Bosh said on the podcast. He added: \u201cOne thing about athletes  \u2014   and I don\u2019t know what it is about us  \u2014   we ignore pain, or we try our best to ignore pain. And I think that\u2019s one of the worst things you can possibly do. \u201d Bosh was eventually hospitalized, and tests revealed that a blood clot in his calf had traveled to his lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism  \u2014   a problem that can be fatal. Bosh had surgery and spent nine days in a hospital. He lost 20 to 25 pounds, he said, and missed the final 30 games of the   season. Bosh has never publicly articulated his specific course of treatment, but he presumably took   drugs. He appeared in a television commercial for one such medication, Xarelto. Bosh was cleared by the Heat to return for the   season opener. He played well through the first half of the season, averaging 19. 1 points and 7. 4 rebounds per game before the   break. But a few days before the   Game, he awoke with a sore calf. He was soon found to have had a recurrence of blood clots. He met with team doctors, who told him that his season was over and that his career was probably finished, too, he said. \u201cI felt right away that I was written off,\u201d Bosh said in one of his interviews with Uninterrupted. He added, \u201cIf a doctor tells me, \u2018Hey, that\u2019s it, and this is how it is,\u2019 and I don\u2019t buy that, then I think I have the right to disagree with you. \u201d Bosh also alluded to the tension between himself and the Heat\u2019s medical staff. \u201cIf you\u2019re an athlete in this game, you have to protect your own interests, and you have to protect your body and your family,\u201d Bosh said. \u201cIf one doctor is a doctor for 15 guys, who\u2019s paying this guy?\u201d He added, \u201cIf you\u2019re paying a doctor through your pocket, your insurance  \u2014   whatever that case may be  \u2014   that changes their interest. \u201d It has mostly remained a   public tussle. The Heat, aside from sporadic statements, have not spoken in detail about Bosh\u2019s medical situation, nor have team officials said what liability, if any, the franchise might have if something were to happen to Bosh on the court. The Heat\u2019s president, Pat Riley, told reporters on Monday that Bosh\u2019s career with the team \u201cis probably over. \u201d \u201cThere is not a next step for us,\u201d Riley said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty definitive for us in our position. \u201d The Heat declined interview requests for this article. The players\u2019 union did not immediately return a call seeking comment. Samantha Brennan, a philosophy professor at Western University in London, Ontario, teaches a class on sports ethics that touches on the role of team doctors and the conflicts of interest that can arise  \u2014   namely, clearing athletes to return to competition before they are ready. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes the case involving Chris Bosh so unusual,\u201d Brennan said, referring to the urge among teams to send players back onto the field. So what happens if an athlete, fully aware of the medical risks, insists on continuing to play? Does the team have a moral responsibility to look out for the athlete\u2019s  ? In most cases, Brennan said, risk taking is left to the discretion of adults. The challenge with many athletes, she said, is that they have invested so much of themselves in their careers from an early age that it can cloud their judgment. \u201cWhen they need to make a difficult decision, it puts them in a bind,\u201d Brennan said. \u201cIt makes it very hard for them to say, \u2018I\u2019m ready to stop playing. \u2019\u201d Ultimately, Brennan said, an athlete is an employee, and team officials have the power to do what they want. \u201cSo they\u2019re making two kinds of decisions,\u201d Brennan said, referring to the Heat. \u201cOne is an ethical decision about not wanting someone they know and care about  \u2014   imagine if he died playing. They\u2019re also making a   decision because they\u2019re worried about injuries and liability. \u201d Dr. Jack Ansell, a professor of medicine at Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine on Long Island, said he knew of several athletes who had managed   problems by taking blood thinners between games and then allowing the medication to be flushed from their systems before they returned to competition. Ansell, a member and former chairman of the medical and scientific advisory board of the National Blood Clot Alliance, has not examined Bosh and has no specific knowledge of his case. But Ansell said he suspected that Bosh would need     therapy to prevent recurring clots and that the grueling schedule of the N. B. A. would make intermittent treatment difficult. \u201cYou\u2019re playing games every two or three nights,\u201d he said, \u201cso there\u2019s no real time off. \u201d Rebekah Bradford Plath, a speedskater who competed at the 2010 Winter Olympics, developed a pulmonary embolism in 2012. While still on   therapy, she resumed training. The risks were fairly minimal.   speedskating is a noncontact sport, although falls do happen Bradford Plath wore a helmet. \u201cI do know that I probably made some of my teammates nervous when they were skating around me,\u201d she said in a telephone interview. \u201cSome of them understood the significance of what I was doing. But I trusted my ability, I trusted the ability of my teammates, and I felt comfortable and confident. \u201d Last year, after having knee surgery, Bradford Plath had a recurrence of blood clotting even though she was taking blood thinners at the time. After her physician increased the dosage, she said, the clot cleared. Bradford Plath, who still takes blood thinners when she travels on airplanes, continues to train with an eye on the 2018 Winter Olympics.'"}, "time": 1742563677.6386445}
