The IMF were among the institutions that forecast an economic disaster if Britain voted to Brexit \\nEstablishment institutions, as well as global investment banks, issued united and terrifying warnings of economic disaster if Britain opted out of the European Union (EU), in an effort to sway the public into voting to Remain. \\nYet figures released yesterday showed booming Britain\\'s economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the three months after the vote, providing the crowning piece of unarguable evidence that the vote to leave did not negatively impact the UK. \\nThe Treasury, under the leadership of George Osborne, had predicted Britain would fall into immediate recession after a Brexit vote, with GDP coming in at -0.1 per cent in the third quarter of 2016. \\nBut yesterday the Treasury admitted the claim had been based on GUESSWORK which turned out to be wholly ill-informed. \\nDespite the rank amateurism and inaccuracy of almost all forecasts since Brexit a negative report on Britain\u2019s economic competence \u2013 and since Brexit they have almost ALL been negative \u2013 risks serious harm to the welfare of the nation. \\nThe IMF said Brexit could reduce the UK economy by as much as 9.5 per cent, and added that Britain could expect \"sizeable\" long-term losses in income. \\nHead of the IMF Christine Lagarde had the audacity to say she could not see ANYTHING positive to come from leaving the EU and an exit could have \"particularly severe\" consequences. \\nMs Lagarde added that interest rates could also rise sharply in the event of leaving Europe, which would negatively impact on households with high debts.'"}, "time": 1742562304.0307603}
