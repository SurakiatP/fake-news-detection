As for the rest, I present it for those who have the interest and stamina to decipher. To the Memory of Peacocks & the Hyena King by Aloysius Fozdyke \u2014 (henrymakow.com) I\u2019m loving the American presidential election, the Global Election Management System and fractionalized or fictionalized voting. All sizzle and no steak. One of the better smoke and mirrors shows. American presidents are selected not elected! The sheeple are so easy to fool there\u2019s hardly any fun in it any more. Donald is two-faced and adult diaper Hillary is genital-centred and unwell. \u2018Did you just soil yourself?\u2019\u2018Sure! Do you think I smell this bad all the time?\u2019 It doesn\u2019t matter if every American votes for Donald Trump, because the results will give the election to Hilary Clinton. It\u2019s about sizzle without the steak. We let the sheeple vote so that they feel they still have choices that matter. The outcome is irrelevant, provided that the sheeple feel that they\u2019re contributing and that they still have choices. For what it\u2019s worth, have a look at \u2018fractional voting\u2019. We\u2019re so close to conquering and getting the only thing we\u2019ve ever wanted \u2013 everything! And honestly, in return we give the masses what they want, which in truth isn\u2019t much at all, just illusions. We give them choices between two predetermined political outcomes, but allow them to select from a myriad of supermarket junk foods, television programmes and glossy magazines, because that\u2019s what they deserve \u2013 inconsequential options and diversions. The social crash will be after the American presidential elections \u2013 even if Trump wins, which he won\u2019t. The media has conditioned the masses to the predetermined fact that Hilary will win and being placidly obedient, Americans will accept that result. It\u2019s not like our people have to be careful any more. As my mentor used to say, \u2018The Lord is my shepherd and eventually, like all good shepherds he will lead you to the slaughterhouse\u2019. Being herd animals, sheeple want safety, not freedom. They want to work harder and longer for less and less. They already live in fear of their own governments while constructing their own prisons. \u2018We the sheeple\u2026\u2019 Yeah, right! Right hand path spiritualities \u2013 like Xtianity \u2013 are suffering and death centred. So we will give you what you want: suffering and death. The third world war is what\u2019s needed to bring Old Numb-Nuts back, with all his egregious double standards. And remember, he came not to bring peace, but a sword, so essentially we\u2019ll continue giving the masses what they want \u2013 just like we always have. Enjoy!
