Students for Justice in Palestine is a campus organization whose sole purpose is to conduct hateful propaganda against Jews and the Jewish state for the terrorist organization Hamas. The explicit goals of Hamas are the destruction of the world\u2019s only Jewish state and genocide against its Jewish population. For these reasons, among others, three campuses of the University of California\u2014Irvine, Los Angeles, and Berkeley\u2014have been named among the \u201cTop Ten Schools Supporting Terrorists\u201d by the David Horowitz Freedom Center. You may read the full report here: http://www.stopthejewhatredoncampus.org/news/top-ten-schools-supporting-terrorists-fall-2016-report \\nWhile it masquerades as a typical campus cultural group, SJP is an integral part of Hamas\u2019s efforts to annihilate Israel through the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign. This is an insidious effort that attempts to delegitimize Israel, and smear it as a rogue \u201capartheid\u201d nation. These claims are ludicrous. More than a million Palestinians enjoy Israeli citizenship including the rights to vote and to sit on the Israeli courts and parliament. Harvard Professor Alan Dershowitz has said of the BDS movement, \u201cIt is anti-Semitic, anti-Zionist, anti-human rights, anti-intellectual, anti-science, anti-negotiation, anti-peace, anti-compromise, and anti-Palestinian workers when they are denied opportunities to work.\u201d Both Larry Summers and Hillary Clinton have denounced BDS as anti-Semitic Jew hatred. Yet your school provides a platform and funding for its sponsors. \\nWith university support, SJP also conducts \u201cIsraeli apartheid\u201d hate weeks on campus quads. These events feature pro-Hamas advocates, the construction of \u201capartheid walls\u201d featuring pro-Hamas, anti-Semitic propaganda, and the creation of mock checkpoints and die-ins that disrupt student movements on campus. SJP actively disrupts pro-Israel campus events\u2014a threat to free speech and a violation of your university\u2019s stated values and rules of conduct. \\nIn addition to being scripted by Hamas terrorists, SJPs pro-terror campaign is funded and guided through a Hamas front called American Muslims for Palestine. In recent testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Jonathan Schanzer, who worked as a terrorism finance analyst for the United States Department of the Treasury from 2004-2007, described how Hamas funnels large sums of money and provides material assistance to Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) through the Hamas front group American Muslims for Palestine (AMP) for the purpose of promoting BDS campaigns on American campuses. AMP was created by SJP co-founder Hatem Bazian, a pro-terrorist lecturer at UC Berkeley who called for a suicide bombing \u201cIntifada\u201d inside the United States. It employs high-ranking officials from other Muslim \u201ccharities\u201d that were previously shut down for providing material assistance to terrorists. \\nSchanzer described AMP as \u201carguably the most important sponsor and organizer for Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), which is the most visible arm of the BDS campaign on campuses in the United States.\u201d He detailed how AMP \u201cprovides speakers, training, printed materials, a so-called \u2018Apartheid Wall,\u2019 and grants to SJP activists\u201d and \u201ceven has a campus coordinator on staff whose job is to work directly with SJP and other pro-BDS campus groups across the country.\u201d Furthermore, \u201caccording to an email it sent to subscribers, AMP spent $100,000 on campus activities in 2014 alone.\u201d \\nStudents for Justice in Palestine continues to accept funding and aid through the Hamas front group American Muslims for Palestine. Despite its links to terrorist organizations and agendas, Students for Justice in Palestine continues to receive campus funds and campus privileges, including university offices, and the right to hold events preaching the genocidal values of Hamas on university property. These privileges would normally be denied to groups that preach hatred of any other ethnic group, let alone one that supports barbaric terrorists who slaughter men, women and children with the goal of cleansing the earth of people who disagree with them. \\nIn light of these facts, we ask that you withdraw all university privileges granted to SJP and other campus groups who promote the genocidal Hamas agenda, and that you put an end to the terrorist influences which have infiltrated your campus and which threaten the security not only of Jewish students on your campus, but of all Americans. \\nDavid Horowitz ceo The David Horowitz Freedom Center Sherman Oaks, California'"}, "time": 1742562294.9764311}
