And in a split second, as the matador lays vulnerable, the bull slams its horn into the prone tormentor. The bull pushes Romero several feet and only pulls back when the other matadors jump in to distract the beast. The video is shocking.  The matador was rushed to the hospital with horrific injuries to his rectum.
