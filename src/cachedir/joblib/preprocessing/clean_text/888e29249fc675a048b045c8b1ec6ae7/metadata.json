The Donald\u2019s Deplorables were out in force after the First Lady posed for the cover of Vogue. \\n\u201cI could have spent eight years doing anything , and at some level, it would have been fine,\u201d Obama told the magazine . \u201cI could have focused on flowers. I could have focused on decor. I could have focused on entertainment. Because any first lady, rightfully, gets to define her role. There\u2019s no legislative authority; you\u2019re not elected. And that\u2019s a wonderful gift of freedom.\u201d \\nIn exercising her freedom, Michelle Obama has done quite a bit to push education, healthy eating, and support for our veterans \u2014 and in exercising their freedom, the Right has responded with nothing but hate. The reaction to the First Lady appearing in elegant clothing was typical. Readers of Yahoo News showered Obama with racist remarks, calling her an \u201cape\u201d and a \u201cmonkey\u201d and even wishing death upon her for the horrific crime of wearing pretty clothes. \\nIf you thought this behavior would stop after the election, you were wrong. Trump fans are not done by a long shot \u2014 and now they have been emboldened by America electing its first official KKK candidate. \\nIt will get worse before it gets better. \\nFeatured image via Vogue /screengrabs Share this Article!
