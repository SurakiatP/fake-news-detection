Christian Adams, author of Injustice: Exposing the Racial Agenda of the Obama Justice Department, was a guest on Wednesday\u2019s Breitbart News Daily with SiriusXM host Alex Marlow. [Marlow asked Adams to clarify the new immigration guidelines coming from President Trump\u2019s administration.  LISTEN: \u201cThe president and DHS have really issued some bold new rules that I think are designed to protect the country,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThey\u2019re doing things the Obama administration refused to do but should have. \u201d For example, he said the Trump administration would be \u201cremoving people quickly, without any nonsense rigamarole. \u201d \u201cThese are people who haven\u2019t been here very long. The Obama administration used to confine it to just two weeks. So if you could manage to get past two weeks under Obama, you can stay,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut under Trump, they\u2019re going to make it two years. So if you\u2019ve been here within two years, in the country illegally, you\u2019re gone quickly. Expedited removal. Outta here. \u201d \u201cObama used to confine it to 100 miles within the border  \u2014   only if you were caught within a hundred miles would you be removed immediately, on an expedited basis,\u201d he continued. \u201cAll you had to do is get past the   line, and you were safe under Obama. What Trump did was extend it to the entire country. If you\u2019re caught illegally, and you\u2019ve been here less than two years, you\u2019re going to be immediately removed. \u201d Adams said there was no chance the Left would refrain from \u201cmelting down\u201d over these changes. \u201cAs you know, Alex, the Left is all about changing the demographics of the country so they can win elections,\u201d he charged. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what this has all been about from the beginning. The open borders crowd is finding a way to undermine mainstream America, middle American values, political views, to inject the country with a foreign influence  \u2014   that\u2019s right, I said that  \u2014   foreign influence  \u2014   so the demographic of the electorate changes. \u201d  \u201cIt helps them win the White House. It helps them win the Senate in places like Florida, California, Arizona, Virginia, another great example, Pennsylvania, Illinois  \u2014   places with high immigration and illegal immigration. So I think the Left will go crazy. It\u2019s what they do. They can\u2019t help themselves. So expect more of it,\u201d he said. Marlow characterized the longstanding \u201cbizarre and terrible\u201d approach to immigration enforcement as an implicit promise that \u201call you have to do is not commit another crime, and then you can stay. \u201d \u201cI think that the decision to focus on criminal behavior  \u2014   and we can talk about what that means because that\u2019s important  \u2014   but the decision to focus on criminal behavior is a first step. It\u2019s a starting point that most Americans would agree with. It makes the Left look utterly crazy. It gaslights them,\u201d Adams said. \u201cBut you know, it\u2019s not just convicted criminals,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cIt\u2019s people who get picked up for like driving without a license, which is a huge problem when it comes to illegal aliens. And so it\u2019s not just those who were convicted it\u2019s those who were charged, those who were picked up on a minor infraction. \u201d Marlow asked when construction of the border wall President Trump promised might begin and whether it\u2019s truly politically feasible. Adams insisted the wall was quite feasible, pointing to the Great Wall of China as an example of   wall construction technology from ages past. However, he warned that \u201cthe entire bureaucracy inside the Beltway is going to   this. \u201d \u201cEvery chance they get to sabotage and interfere, they\u2019re going to do it. Folks who think that just because Trump is the president that that stuff is over with are wrong. Contracts being let, lawsuits being filed over some lizard in Arizona that might be affected by the wall  \u2026    you\u2019re going to see the entire apparatus of the   institution activate to stop this because they know, again Alex, getting people here illegally helps them win elections ten, fifteen years down the road. I\u2019m afraid that this is going to be a wicked experience for the country when you have bureaucrats opposing this. \u201d Adams agreed with Marlow that construction of the wall was politically dicey, warning that \u201cevery day counts. \u201d \u201cWe are one day worse than we were yesterday of Trump being president. Speed is of the essence. When Obama came in, he realized that every day counted, and so they radicalized the government as fast as possible. That has to be undone just as quickly,\u201d he urged. Marlow cited a new poll that shows 80 percent of Americans oppose the concept of \u201csanctuary cities\u201d where federal officials are not notified after illegal aliens come into contact with local law enforcement. \u201cHow come this is the only law in America you can break where you have a sanctuary city for it?\u201d he asked. \u201cThis is a culture that\u2019s permitting lawlessness to be out in the open in these urban areas like San Francisco, Los Angeles, Houston,\u201d Adams replied. \u201cThese sanctuary cities are openly saying, \u2018We don\u2019t care about the law, and we\u2019re going to provide a haven for lawlessness because we believe in changing the culture, changing the demographics of elections. \u201d \u201cHow can it happen? How does it exist? Look, those cities are run by lunatics,\u201d he said. \u201cSan Francisco is run by lunatics. What is the political backstop? Trump may have figured it out. If you say, \u201cHey, okay, dear lunatics, if you still want your federal money, then you\u2019re going to stop this\u2019  \u2014   but you can see Alex, in some cases, the lunacy is more important to them than the dollars. We\u2019ll see what happens there. \u201d Adams portrayed the assault on immigration law as an attack on \u201cthe fundamental notion that the West, that America, has the power to set off a piece of the earth and say, \u2018We are different from the rest of you. We believe in individual liberty, the role of limited government, of the separation of powers, of the rule of law, and we are allowed to do borders to protect those ideas. \u2019\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s under attack, Alex. Around the world is this notion that the West should be able to survive as the West. That\u2019s why people like Trudeau, who\u2019s also a nut, are part of this globalist open borders ideology that really is a   effort to undermine Western values,\u201d he added, referring to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. A caller asked how it would be possible to determine that any given illegal alien had been present in the United States for two years or less to remove them with expedited deportation, given that illegal aliens have little documentation of their movements. \u201cThat\u2019s a great question,\u201d said Adams. \u201cThat\u2019s where the lawyers working at DHS and immigration judges  \u2014   you know, we have rules of evidence, Alex. I can figure out, pretty much, if you give me subpoena power, how long somebody\u2019s been in the country. I could talk to people. I could look at bank records. I could look at job histories. I could look at a variety of evidence that will inform the question of how long they\u2019ve been here. Sometimes you get an admission, right? That\u2019s the best kind of evidence, an admission against interest. So it\u2019s not impossible to figure out who\u2019s been here less than two years.
