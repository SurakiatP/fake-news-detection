In an interview with the radio station Hot 97 posted online on Monday, Mr. Jackson questioned the casting of the black British actor Daniel Kaluuya in the   film \u201cGet Out,\u201d about a black American\u2019s encounter with his white girlfriend\u2019s creepy family. Mr. Jackson suggested that \u201can American brother\u201d might have brought a deeper perspective to the role, and suggested that black Britons had endured less racism than  . He noted that British actors often secured American roles because they are less well known and therefore paid less, and because many of them are valued for their classical training. Jordan Peele, the writer and director of \u201cGet Out,\u201d has acknowledged that he was hesitant to cast a British actor, given that the film focuses on the   experience. Mr. Jackson said on Wednesday that his intention had been to comment on Hollywood, not to \u201cslam\u201d Mr. Kaluuya. And while his comments have been criticized by many black commentators  \u2014   American and British  \u2014   some British performers do seem to find it easier to get roles in the United States than at home. Here is what some British minority actors who have worked in the United States have said about the issue. Mr. Boyega, who is from South London, plays Finn in \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens. \u201d While the role is not American per se, given that the film unfolds in a distant galaxy, Finn speaks with an entirely convincing American accent. In a tweet on Tuesday, Mr. Boyega appeared to dismiss Mr. Jackson\u2019s comments: \u201cBlack brits vs African American,\u201d he wrote, saying that the conflict was \u201cstupid\u201d and one \u201cwe don\u2019t have time for. \u201d It\u2019s not just black British actors who have found success in the United States. Mr. Ahmed, a British actor of Pakistani descent, has slipped into several American roles, including the lead character, Nasir, on HBO\u2019s series \u201cThe Night Of,\u201d and a philandering surfing instructor on \u201cGirls,\u201d also on HBO. He recently addressed Parliament about a lack and misrepresentation of minority characters in the arts, suggesting that the problem might even be driving young Britons toward extremist beliefs. \u201cWe end up going to America to find work,\u201d Mr. Ahmed said. \u201cI meet with producers and directors here and they say, \u2018We don\u2019t have anything for you all our stories are set in Cornwall in the 1600s. \u2019\u201d Ms. Harris, who plays Paula, the   mother of the lead character, Chiron, in the   \u201cMoonlight,\u201d is from London. She had to film her scenes in the movie in just three days, because of issues securing a visa to the United States. \u201cI definitely think that for my career to have continued I definitely had to go to America, and I\u2019m really glad that I did there is just a lot more material,\u201d Ms. Harris told reporters at the premiere of \u201cMoonlight\u201d at the London Film Festival last year. Mr. Ejiofor portrayed Solomon Northup, a free   who was abducted and enslaved in the   century. He has made an acting career with a foot on both sides of the Atlantic. In a 2015 interview with Time Out, he seemed to shy from discussion of the role race had played in his career, but suggested that the notable success that British actors of all races have enjoyed in the United States may have to do with different career expectations. \u201cWe all wanted to be theater actors,\u201d he said of his fellow Britons. \u201cIt\u2019s less glamorous much more about the work. You have to get on with it. You have to know when something\u2019s not working. And you have to hone your craft. Maybe that gives us an advantage. \u201d Mr. Oyelowo, who is based in the United States, toiled in smaller roles before landing the part of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in the 2014   drama \u201cSelma. \u201d In a speech on diversity in London last year, Mr. Oyelowo pleaded with members of the British film industry to create more roles for minorities in Britain, noting that many actors felt obliged to move to the United States. \u201cPlease stop this talent drain,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to change the demographics of the people who are making these decisions. \u201d Mr. Elba grew up in London and broke into the American market with his starring role as the Baltimore drug lord Stringer Bell on HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Wire. \u201d In an address to Parliament last year, Mr. Elba called on media representatives to make more room for minorities. \u201cThe Britain I come from is the most successful, diverse, multicultural country on Earth,\u201d Mr. Elba said. \u201cBut here\u2019s my point: You wouldn\u2019t know it if you turned on the TV. \u201d Sophie Okonedo described herself as a Jewish, Nigerian Brit when accepting her 2014 Tony Award for playing the   character Ruth Winger in \u201cA Raisin in the Sun\u201d on Broadway. She told The Guardian in 2014 that she saw far more opportunities for roles in the United States than in Britain. \u201cI do notice that  \u2014   over the last year  \u2014   I\u2019ve had maybe two scripts from England and tens and tens from America,\u201d she said. \u201cThe balance is ridiculous. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561848.941032}
