[\u201cTerrible! Just found out that Obama had my \u2018wires tapped\u2019 in Trump Tower just before the victory,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cNothing found. This is McCarthyism!\u201d  Trump questioned whether it was legal for Obama to be wiretapping a presidential candidate while he was still in office. \u201cHow low has President Obama gone to tapp (sic) my phones during the very sacred election process,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis is  . Bad (or sick) guy! Is it legal for a sitting President to be \u2018wire tapping\u2019 a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW!\u201d Trump is likely referring to calls from talk radio hosts Mark Levin and Rush Limbaugh to investigate the nature of the Obama administration\u2019s investigations of his campaign aides for their communications with Russia, as Breitbart News editor Joel Pollak reported.  As former Heat Street editor Louise Mensch reported the day before the election, \u201csources with links to the   community\u201d confirmed that a FISA court had granted a FISA court warrant in October to monitor activities in Trump tower. They were previously denied a request in June, according to the report as well as a report in the Guardian.  The New York Times reported on Wednesday that the Obama team classified the investigation at the lowest possible level, allowing the data gathered from the investigation to be shared and leaked widely within the administration. In January, The New York Times reported that intelligence reports based on some of the wiretapped communications had been provided to the Obama White House even though there was \u201cno conclusive evidence of wrongdoing\u201d between Russian officials and associates of Trump. On Twitter, Trump suggested that he might even have legal options against the former president. \u201cI\u2019d bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election!\u201d he wrote.'"}, "time": 1742562262.6139548}
