Harriet Tubman will appear on the front of a new $20 bill to be unveiled in 2020, and a pair of civil rights scenes, one featuring suffragist leaders, will appear on the backs of redesigned $5 and $10 bills, the Treasury Department said on Wednesday. The old faces will remain. Alexander Hamilton stays on the front of the $10 and Andrew Jackson moves to the back of the $20. But there will be women in American wallets for the first time in more than a century (when Martha Washington appeared) and   for the first time in the nation\u2019s history. Wesley Morris, a    Jennifer Schuessler, a culture reporter, and Binyamin Appelbaum, who covers the economy, talk about what the monetary makeover all means. SCHUESSLER: For all the debate over the past year about the fate of Hamilton, the top news here is really that Harriet Tubman will replace Andrew Jackson on the $20, becoming the first   to appear on the front of a United States bank note. The Treasury won\u2019t release the design until 2020, but people are already sharing Photoshopped Tubman twenties online, and they feel wonderfully jolting and radical. What do you think? Does having her on the bill make a real difference  \u2014   either to how we think about our history, or how we think about our money? APPELBAUM: I think it does make a difference. There were more than 8. 5 billion $20 bills in circulation last year. Our money is right up there with the Golden Arches as an instantly and globally recognizable emblem of America. And our bills are stale. The seven white men on the seven notes in general circulation were all dead by 1885. Ulysses S. Grant is the only one who lived past the end of the Civil War. More than half of American history has happened since. Countries historically have used their currency to make sure everyone knows who\u2019s in charge. The United Kingdom still puts the queen on every single bill, although she always has company. Putting Tubman on the $20 strikes me as a powerful and necessary realignment of our symbols and our professed values. I guess one question on my mind is this: Do these changes go far enough? Tubman isn\u2019t exactly a modern figure she died in 1913. And amazingly, there\u2019s still a Masonic pyramid on the back of the $1 bill. MORRIS: Oooo, Binyamin. You mess with that pyramid, and the Illuminati will hunt you down. Stand down, man! And by \u201cilluminati,\u201d I mean in 100 years we might be talking about Beyonc\u00e9 on all currency. Just kidding. Those meetings started happening last week. Harriet Tubman died in 1913 (  New York Times obituary right here! Two paragraphs.) but her legacy endures. Her legacy is typing a third of this conversation. But ought there be a degree of catching up? For instance, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who died in 1902, is deserving of more than the possible \u201cAvengers\u201d treatment Treasury apparently has planned for suffragists. Having Tubman on cash is not simply reparative, although the idea of seeing her face and hearing her name during the months of the year that aren\u2019t February becomes nourishment in itself. Having her on cash is to me an uncontroversial  . But generally, yes, let\u2019s get some more modern candidates on our moola. SCHUESSLER: Speaking of the \u201cAvengers\u201d treatment, does anyone else find the plans for the new $10 a little awkward? Hamilton will stay on the front, while the picture of the Treasury Department Building on the back will be replaced with an image of a 1913 women\u2019s suffrage march that ended at that building, along with portraits of five suffrage leaders. There\u2019s currently only one bill that features a group scene: the $2 bill, introduced in 1976, which shows Jefferson on the front and the presentation of a draft of the Declaration of Independence on the back. This makes sense, as  \u2014   in a more indirect way  \u2014   does the   plan to add images of Eleanor Roosevelt, Marian Anderson and Martin Luther King Jr. to the back of the $5, which has Abraham Lincoln on the front. The Treasury Building connection aside, does pairing of Hamilton with suffragists make any sense? Or does it simply reflect the strange currency politics of our moment? APPELBAUM: Oh, it\u2019s clearly a political marriage. Jack Lew, the secretary of the Treasury, did something fairly unusual, at least by Washington standards: He changed his mind. Mr. Lew announced last year, to great fanfare, that the government would put a woman on the $10. He apparently had Susan B. Anthony in mind. (There are lots of great women in American history, but somehow Anthony is the one the government always wants to put on money.) Well, it turned out this was the wrong moment to mess with Alexander Hamilton, who as you may have heard is currently starring on Broadway. Lew also was stung by his own peer group. Ben Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve chairman, said publicly that he was \u201cappalled,\u201d which is pretty much the strongest language I\u2019ve ever heard him use about anything. So Treasury needed another bill. Andrew Jackson actually thought the United States shouldn\u2019t print paper money. He was also a bad president. So he gets shunted to the back of the $20, and Hamilton stays on the front of the $10 and women get the balance of the real estate. MORRIS: It\u2019s awkward! It\u2019s also fascinating. The conceptual coups of the show reside in its placing the stress on Hamilton\u2019s being an outsider and having that status align with the modern conversation about who \u201cbelongs\u201d in this country. In the show, that line, \u201cImmigrants, we get the job done\u201d simultaneously brings down the house and electrifies it. It\u2019s exhilaratingly punctual. This is to say that an amazing thing has happened to Hamilton thanks to the success of the show. He\u2019s the subject of Ron Chernow\u2019s book, but now he\u2019s also   Miranda. So to Mr. Miranda\u2019s fans (and to Hamilton\u2019s   partisans) removing him from the $10 bill might feel like apostasy, confirming not only how cool this guy suddenly is, but how he has been recast as nonwhite  \u2014   and, consequently, how protected he is by our current identity politics. SCHUESSLER: Exactly. Am I crazy to think that the show has effectively turned Hamilton  \u2014   a white man born in the British West Indies  \u2014   into our nonwhite founder, or our   founder, in a Bill Clinton \u201cfirst black president\u201d kind of way? It has certainly made Hamilton, an unabashed elitist, into a populist hero, embraced by people who (like me) probably didn\u2019t quite notice until the last year that he was even on our currency. But is it important that the people on our money, and in our history books, are likable and relatable (to use two good   words)? APPELBAUM: I\u2019d like to admire the people on our currency, but it\u2019s unlikely that \u201cwe,\u201d in the sense of all Americans, are going to agree about any given historical figure. The eurozone has skirted this problem by putting bridges on its bank notes. And they\u2019re not even actual bridges: just archetypes of different styles: Classical on the five euro note, Romanesque on the 10 euro note, and so forth. Putting presidents on currency is also a kind of safe harbor. Those are the 43 people who have actually won a national popularity contest. Tubman now joins the shorter list of nonpresidents who have been selected as \u201crepresentative Americans,\u201d alongside Hamilton and Benjamin Franklin. MORRIS: Jenny, I can tell you a story that\u2019s worse than never looking at my money. On Saturdays, I go to the same ATM to withdraw cash for the week. I prefer that particular set of machines because it gives out $10s and $50s, and getting them feels, I don\u2019t know, special. Well, last weekend it gave me a $100 bill that, in the shallow pockets of my sweats, might have as well have been a one, since the money was quickly gone. That\u2019s a little story about why I hate \u201cathleisure. \u201d It\u2019s also a story about why I hate cash. But this Harriet Tubman news will make me reconsider. For one thing, she\u2019s  \u201crepresentative. \u201d For another, $20 bills are the favorite denomination of most ATMs, and I predict I\u2019ll feel scrupulous in spending it. How do I pay for a   of toilet paper with a Tubman? Who knows, my savings game might go through the roof. And even if who\u2019s on what money doesn\u2019t matter to most people, it definitely matters to rebellious rappers, who\u2019ll have to adjust their rhymes to take in what it means to have a great black woman stacked among what \u201cdead presidents\u201d are still standing (Sorry, Mr. Jackson). SCHUESSLER: Speaking of national popularity contests, it\u2019s interesting  \u2014   if surely coincidental  \u2014   that \u201cHamilton\u201d  has helped delay putting a woman on the front of a bill, just at the moment when we may elect an actual woman president. (The Tubman bill won\u2019t circulate until after 2020.) If Hillary Clinton wins the White House, how many decades will it be before she\u2019s on the money? (And don\u2019t you want to still be alive for those arguments?) APPELBAUM: So there\u2019s a legal hurdle: To quote \u201cHamilton,\u201d you have to be \u201csuper dead\u201d before you\u2019re eligible to be portrayed on American currency. There\u2019s also the Mount Rushmore problem. The bar is always lower for initial membership. Once the lineup is full, each decision is doubled: Every addition also requires a subtraction. Which raises an important question: Does Hamilton deserve to keep his spot? SCHUESSLER: Oh man! I\u2019m wary of answering that before I take a course in  . And I\u2019ll leave responding to your sick burn of Jackson as a \u201cbad president\u201d to professional historians and political scientists, who have often ranked him in the top 10  \u2014   well ahead of Ulysses S. Grant, our man on the $50. Sticking just to the founders, I\u2019d venture that Hamilton has as good a claim as anyone after Washington and Jefferson (especially as played by Daveed Diggs). But the changes also raise another question: Should we introduce lots more people on currency? APPELBAUM: The United Kingdom rotates the faces on its currency every few years, so it can honor a range of great Britains. Jane Austen is due for a turn on the   note starting next year. The British chancellor, God save him, tweeted that the choice showed \u201csense and sensibility. \u201d Bad jokes aside, they\u2019re on to something. Rotating the honor would allow recognition for a broader group of notable Americans, and it would take the pressure off each decision. MORRIS: That\u2019s been my whole problem with the stress of this conversation ever since it heated up last summer: the pressure. Just flip these suckers. That would temper the pernicious exasperation of White Male Threat. You can depict white guys and everybody else, opening our currency to a galaxy of history, as opposed to this limiting Rushmore approach we\u2019ve got now  \u2014   sorry, no space for you! Yes, Eleanor Roosevelt and Marian Anderson will be on the back of the $5 bill. But I\u2019m interested in fronts. Why not have stints for folks like Ida B. Wells, Clara Barton, Charles R. Drew, Marian Anderson, Jackie Cochran, Cesar Chavez, Paul Robeson, Frederick Douglass, Sojourner Truth, Shirley Chisholm, Nelly Bly, August Wilson, Amelia Earhart, Richard Pryor and James Wong Howe: Americans who helped make America great before it was deemed in need of being made great again. SCHUESSLER: I\u2019d personally like to see some writers on our currency. Just sticking to the   and     classics, what about Phillis Wheatley, or Emily Dickinson, or Walt Whitman, who after all wrote a lot about the color green? APPELBAUM: You\u2019ll love the new Austen note, which features the \u201cPride and Prejudice\u201d line, \u201cI declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading. \u201d SCHUESSLER: So true, my dear Jane! After, of course, the enjoyment of listening to the \u201cHamilton\u201d album.'"}, "time": 1742562994.1505566}
