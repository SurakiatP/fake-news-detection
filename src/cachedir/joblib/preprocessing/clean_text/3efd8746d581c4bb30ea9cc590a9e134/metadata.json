[The campus carry legislation is contained in House Bill 630, which is sponsored by state Rep. Jered Taylor ( ).  The Missourian reports that HB 630 would remove numerous \u201c  zones\u201d around the state, including those in \u201cchild care centers, public universities and churches. \u201d This means child care workers with concealed carry permits would be able to have a gun at hand to protect children, permit holders would be able to keep a gun with them on campus to defend their lives and the lives of fellow students, and   could be armed to fend off an attack during church services around the state. State Rep. Jon Carpenter (  City) was taken aback by  efforts to roll back \u201c  zones\u201d and asked, \u201cIs this for show or is this for real?\u201d Rep. Taylor responded, \u201cI want individuals to be able to choose whether or not they carry a gun to protect themselves and others if the need were to arise. \u201d He added, \u201cCriminals know where the   zones are. They know they\u2019re going to be able to carry out their rampage and likely won\u2019t be stopped until law enforcement arrives. \u201d State Rep. Nick Schroer ( \u2019Fallon) is sponsoring legislation that would hold \u201c \u201d businesses liable if a customer in the business suffers harm in a situation where they could have defended themselves with a gun. He said, \u201cThis policy of making places   provides a sense of safety to those who engage in magical thinking. These killers are not stopped by a sign on the front door. \u201d Schroer said businesses that advertise their   status with signage highlight \u201cthe dangerous condition we talk about when we talk about premises liability. \u201d AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.
