A fuller picture of the Orlando attack emerged. The city\u2019s mayor explained the decision to send a S. W. A. T. team into the gay club under siege early Sunday, saying that the gunman, Omar Mateen, was threatening to strap bombs to hostages. It was not clear whether he had explosives. The F. B. I. asked the public to help in tracing his history and movements. _____ 2. More Republican politicians were under scrutiny over their attitudes toward gays. On Tuesday, Anderson Cooper, the CNN anchor who has made a point of representing the gay perspective in coverage of the attack, grilled the Florida\u2019s attorney general, above, over her fight against   marriage. Democrats took over the U. S. Senate floor on Wednesday shortly after 11 a. m. and held it into the early hours of Thursday morning, arguing for stricter   measures. Donald Trump set up a meeting with the N. R. A. to discuss an initiative that it has rejected: banning gun sales to people on terrorist watch lists. _____ 3. A few miles southwest of Orlando, a family was in shock after a heartbreaking loss. The remains of a    boy dragged away by an alligator Tuesday night were found. He had been playing by his parents and    sister at an artificial lake at a Disney resort by the Magic Kingdom theme park. _____ 4. Our special report examines the failings of the World   Agency, which has been overwhelmed by doping scandals involving Russia. The agency, hamstrung by conflicting allegiances, has been lax in following up on reports of corruption and doping. When this Olympic medalist wrote to WADA in 2012, offering to reveal details of Russia\u2019s systematic doping, the agency turned the email over to Russian officials, who themselves were said to be implicated in the cheating. _____ 5. What could have been a New York nightmare turned into a lesson in what\u2019s right with the world. A man who fainted in the subway and plummeted to the tracks was rescued by strangers who leaped down to lift him out. \u201cWithout even knowing the person, who he is, no matter what denomination he subscribes to,\u201d said a witness. \u201cIt was beautiful to see. \u201d _____ 6. The Federal Reserve did not raise its benchmark interest rate. Instead, it acknowledged that the U. S. economy remained weak and dialed back forecasts for future increases. \u201cThe labor market appears to have slowed down, and we need to assure ourselves that the underlying momentum in the economy has not diminished,\u201d the Fed chairwoman, Janet Yellen, said. _____ 7. A much anticipated film hits theaters Thursday. Our reviewer says that \u201cFinding Dory\u201d is not at the level of its forerunner, Pixar\u2019s 2003 masterpiece \u201cFinding Nemo. \u201d But, he writes, \u201cwhat \u2018Dory\u2019 lacks in dazzling originality it more than makes up for in warmth, charm and good humor. \u201d Analysts forecast a blockbuster box office for the opening weekend that could top $100 million. _____ 8. One of our   stories today asks whether Netflix can survive the world it created. Networks and studios, once grateful for its streaming fees, now see the company as an existential threat. They\u2019re developing competitive platforms and charging more for streaming rights, forcing Netflix to chase more subscribers and raise fees. Netflix \u201cis caught in an arms race they invented,\u201d as one analyst put it. Above, the company\u2019s C. E. O. Reed Hastings. _____ 9. The U. S. took a major step toward including women in the draft. After intense debate, the Senate approved a broad military bill that included a requirement for young women to register for Selective Service when they turn 18, just as    men must. A struggle with the House lies ahead, since its version of the bill did not include the draft provision. _____ 10. Mayor Bill de Blasio believes ferries can ease New York City\u2019s commuting hassles. He\u2019s putting more than $325 million of the city\u2019s budget surplus into a municipal fleet that he predicts will eventually carry 4. 5 million passengers a year among the five boroughs. \u201cOur aim is to make this thing as big as possible,\u201d a deputy mayor said. \u201cNo guts, no glory. \u201d _____ 11. Finally, good news for the frequently caffeinated. A special panel of the World Health Organization dropped its classification of coffee as a possible carcinogen, saying instead that drinking coffee regularly could help protect against uterine and liver cancer. That accords with a large body of research showing that coffee can have a multitude of benefits, lowering rates of heart disease, Type 2 diabetes and neurological disorders.
