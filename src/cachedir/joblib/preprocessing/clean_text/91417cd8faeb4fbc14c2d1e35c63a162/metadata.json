He is enrolled to vote in Maryland and he will be casting his ballot for Trump. \\n\u201cNow that my brother\u2019s term is ending I can be open about it: I support Donald J. Trump for President. #MAGA #MAGA3X #Africans4Trump,\u201d he says on his Twitter page. \\nA Muslim who spends a lot of time in Africa, Malik has between 3 and 12 wives \u2013 he won\u2019t say how many exactly \u2013 and clearly doesn\u2019t adhere to traditional American values, however you define them. But even he is disappointed with the job his brother has done leading the country. \\nPhotographs exist of Malik celebrating wildly after his brother won the 2008 election, but since then his views have changed. Malik dreads the thought of Hillary Clinton succeeding his brother in the Oval Office, and describes Trump\u2019s proposed shut down on Muslims entering the United States as \u201c common sense .\u201d Trump is for the people. Hillary is for the money \\n\u2014 Malik Obama (@ObamaMalik) October 26, 2016 \\nMalik Obama says he is voting Trump because he has learned that career politicians cannot be trusted to enrich anybody but themselves, and he respects the Republican nominee\u2019s honesty. He also blames his brother and Hillary Clinton for the death of Libya\u2019s Moammar Gaddafi, who Malik describes as \u201c one of my best friends .\u201d \\nMalik blasted Clinton\u2019s performance as secretary of state for creating chaos and violence in the Mideast. \u201c Check out the situation in Libya now ,\u201d he said. Malik Obama, older half brother of the US President pictured with the late Colonel Gaddafi of Libya. \\nMalik Obama might not receive regular phone calls from his younger brother anymore, but Trump called him and invited him to attend the third presidential debate in Las Vegas. \\n\u201c I\u2019m excited to be at the debate. Trump can make America great again ,\u201d Malik told The Post. \\n\u201c I look very much forward to meeting and being with Malik ,\u201d Trump said in return. \u201c He gets it far better than his brother. \u201d \\nMalik agrees with Trump that the mainstream media is corrupt and biased, and he dismisses the women who claim Trump kissed or groped them against their wishes. \\n\u201c I don\u2019t believe them ,\u201d Malik said. \u201c Why didn\u2019t they come forward before? \u201d \\nThe Obama surname means \u201c bent over \u201d or \u201c limping \u201d in the Kenyan Luo language of their tribe \u2013 fittingly, as Malik believes his brother\u2019s presidency got off to a good start but is now limping over the line. And in his opinion, if America is to become great again, the baton must not be passed to Hillary Clinton.'"}, "time": 1742562690.7467353}
