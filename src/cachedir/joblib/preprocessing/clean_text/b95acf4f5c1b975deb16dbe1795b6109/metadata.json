[Speaking to the Algemeiner on Tuesday, Rabbi Marvin Hier  \u2014   the founder and dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center (SWC) in Los Angeles  \u2014   said he believes Trump will reaffirm his stance that \u201cJerusalem is the eternal capital of Israel. \u201d  \u201cTrump is not going to let it stand that the Kotel (Western Wall) is going to be under the sovereignty of another nation, or that it\u2019ll be \u2018internationalized,\u2019 as the Vatican would like,\u201d Hier said. \u201cThose are unworkable suggestions that are never going to be agreed upon by the State of Israel. Trump has made it clear on so many occasions that Jerusalem is the eternal capital of Israel, so it would be quite a reversal for him to state differently on this occasion. \u201d Hier\u2019s remarks came after a press briefing earlier in the day by Trump\u2019s National Security Adviser H. R. McMaster, who declined to give direct answers when pressed as to whether the U. S. regards the Western Wall as part of Israel. McMaster only said that the matter was a \u201cpolicy decision. \u201d On Tuesday, White House Spokesman Sean Spicer affirmed that the holy site is \u201cclearly in Jerusalem. \u201d The debate swirling around the Trump administration\u2019s position on Israel intensified in recent days when it was revealed that a senior member of the U. S. delegation reportedly angrily shouted at his Israeli counterpart that the Western Wall was \u201cpart of the West Bank. \u201d However, it later emerged that the official was David Berns, a political counselor at the U. S. Consulate in Jerusalem who took up the role during the Obama administration. Later that day, the White House said that Bern\u2019s position did not reflect that of the administration or the president. On Tuesday, McMaster confirmed that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s request to accompany the president on his visit to the Western Wall would not be fulfilled, stating that \u201cno Israeli leaders\u201d would be joining the president. Even though Trump will be the first sitting president to go to the Western Wall, the White House said it would be in the framework of \u201ca private visit. \u201d The Western Wall, together with the Temple Mount complex and the eastern part of Jerusalem, was captured during the 1967 Six Day War. Its final status has not been agreed on by the international community, which views it as a core issue in the conflict with the Palestinians. \u201cThe notion that there is a question as to whom the Kotel (Western Wall) belongs to is just preposterous,\u201d Hier said. \u201cThis is an unnecessary blunder on the part of, firstly,   officials, and then McMaster. To leave open the suggestion that the sovereignty of the Kotel is attached to the West Bank is just   to me. \u201d Hier repeated his belief that Trump would clarify matters after he arrived in the country. \u201cWhen President Trump arrives in Israel, I don\u2019t think there will be any doubt over who has title over the Kotel,\u201d he told the Algemeiner. Also on Tuesday, a senior U. S. official said Trump still intends to fulfill his campaign promise of relocation. \u201cWe\u2019ll move the embassy, just give us time,\u201d the official was quoted as saying.'"}, "time": 1742564137.4298744}
