The US made a public statement calling for such a separation, but it never happened, and ultimately, Russia started trying to convince Turkey and Saudi Arabia to try. None have accomplished anything so far. \\nIn the meantime, the US and its allies began angrily condemning Russia and Syria for attacking the Nusra Front, complaining it proved Russia doesn\u2019t want peace. This too is adding to doubts about getting new talks started, with everyone seemingly agreeing Nusra can\u2019t participate in the peace process, but not able to get them split in meaningful ways from the rebel factions that might be welcomed.
