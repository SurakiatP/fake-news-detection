Mark Bittman gave us a recipe for an ultimate clambake a few years ago that is deeply involved but really quite easy, and if you have access to beach, rocks and fire, it may make for a glorious summer feast this weekend. If you partake, please document your work, sending photographs or \u201cstories\u201d to our social accounts on Instagram, Twitter or Facebook. We\u2019ll send \u2019em around proudly. #NYTCooking! #NYTClambake! Less complicated but no less an awesome weekend activity would be to make the recipe for cold lobster with lobster mayonnaise that Mark and I ginned up a while back for a dinner party here in New York. You could grill some pizzas. You could make Kim Severson\u2019s recipe for tamarind shrimp with coconut milk. Or you could just make Florence Fabricant\u2019s recipe for chicken paillards with corn salad and watch the Olympics like a normal person. I\u2019d love to make some pies this weekend. I\u2019d be down to make fried chicken. I think it\u2019d be nice to make David Tanis\u2019s recipe for garbanzos and greens with chorizo. It\u2019d be just as pleasurable to make the recipe for Jordan Marsh\u2019s blueberry muffins, which Marian Burros brought to The Times back in 1987. And, as always, I\u2019ll make a big batch of granola to eat for breakfast all next week with thick yogurt and plenty of fruit. How about you? Take a scroll through Cooking to see what appeals, and save the recipes you\u2019re interested in making to your recipe box. Send them along to family and friends for review, either by emailing them or by posting them to social media, the bustling town square of our age. And then let us know  \u2014   all of us in this growing community of cooks!  \u2014   what you think of them by rating the recipes and leaving notes on them. Of course we\u2019ll be standing by to help if anything goes sideways. Just reach out to cookingcare@nytimes. com. Now, won\u2019t you join me in the wayback machine for this reprise of a road trip I took a decade ago to eat salmon in the Pacific Northwest? In more recent news, check out this promising dispatch from The Boston Globe about a rebound of cod in Newfoundland. (Or read this more depressing one from Outside: 10 normal people on the costs of living in a mountain town.) Finally, it is the Glorious Twelfth in Britain today, the opening of   season and, not incidentally, a day of rage for those who abhor the killings on the moors. Still, those of you who patronize   restaurants may see the birds showing up on menus some time next week. Look out! Have a good weekend.'"}, "time": 1742628531.9406838}
