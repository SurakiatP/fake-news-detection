The message continued, \u201cTerror attacks are part of living in big city, says London Mayor Sadiq Khan. \u201d Mr. Trump, the oldest son of President Trump, was calling attention to an article from September in The Independent, a British newspaper, that described Mr. Khan\u2019s reaction to a bombing then in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York City. Mr. Trump mischaracterized the London mayor\u2019s remarks. Mr. Khan did not describe terrorism as \u201cpart of living in a big city,\u201d as if bombings and shootings were an inescapable fact of life. He said that terrorism preparedness, including providing sufficient support to the police, was \u201cpart and parcel of living in a great global city. \u201d \u201cThat means being vigilant, having a police force that is in touch with communities it means the security services being ready, but it also means exchanging ideas and best practice,\u201d Mr. Khan said in a video interview published by The Evening Standard, another British paper. (For the record, Mr. Khan did say the victims of the Chelsea bombing were in his \u201cthoughts and prayers. \u201d) \u201cNothing is more important to me than keeping Londoners safe,\u201d Mr. Khan added. \u201cI want to be reassured that every single agency and individual involved in protecting our city has the resources and expertise they need to respond in the event that London is attacked. \u201d On Thursday morning, Mr. Khan said in an interview on CNN that he would not respond to Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet because he had \u201cbeen doing far more important things over the last 24 hours. \u201d \u201cWhat I do know is that the threat level in London and across the country is severe,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means an attack is highly likely. I was in New York last year when there was an attack in New York. And terrorists hate the fact that whether it\u2019s New York, whether it\u2019s London, whether it\u2019s Paris, whether its Brussels, whether it\u2019s Istanbul, whether it\u2019s Madrid, we have diverse communities living together peacefully. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet was not well received by Britons, who were still learning details of the attack when he weighed in. On Twitter, Wes Streeting, a member of Parliament from the Labour Party, accused Mr. Trump of capitalizing on the attack in London and called him \u201ca disgrace. \u201d Ciaran Jenkins, a correspondent for Britain\u2019s Channel 4, asked the president\u2019s son on Twitter if he thought his remarks were \u201chelpful. \u201d \u201cDid you even read the article before goading London\u2019s Mayor during a live incident?\u201d he wrote. He added, \u201cHeadline is based on very first sentence, which if you\u2019d bothered to read it could apply to any major city in the world. Key word: \u2018threat.\u2019 \u201d Mr. Trump declined to elaborate later on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m not going to comment on every tweet I send,\u201d he said in an email. Political violence in the United Kingdom is relatively rare. Decades of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland often spilled over, but there had not been a   attack in Britain since 2005, when  more than 50 people died in subway and bus attacks.'"}, "time": 1742563491.0453463}
