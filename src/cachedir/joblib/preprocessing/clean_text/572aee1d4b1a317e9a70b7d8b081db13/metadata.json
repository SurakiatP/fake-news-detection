Credit: VDare. \\nThese two things happened the day after Donald Trump won the election: First, a Washington Post reporter named Peter Holley called the American Renaissance office to ask\u2013in dead seriousness\u2013whether anyone from the Trump team had called us for policy advice. Second, Gloria Gonzalez-Garcia, a Mexican-American explained to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram what a Trump victory meant: \u201cWe were getting the message, \u2018If you are not white, you don\u2019t belong here.\u2019 \u201d \\nSo what\u2019s the connection? Let\u2019s start with the Post \u2019s Mr. Holley . [ ] He is a professional newsman who attended Columbia\u2019s Graduate School of Journalism. He calls himself an \u201cexperienced reporter with a talent for uncovering compelling stories that other people overlook.\u201d It\u2019s his job to find out and report what is going on\u2013and he seriously thought the victorious Trump team would check in with me for instructions. \\nHe\u2019s not alone. The same day, a journalist from the biggest newspaper in Latin America\u2013 Folha de S. Paulo \u2013 wanted to know if I had telephoned my friend Donald Trump to congratulate him on his victory. I told her I have never met him and don\u2019t have his number. \\nWhat we have here is a stupefying delusion: that Donald Trump is a secret \u201cwhite supremacist,\u201d who dances to the tune of the Alt-Right. This delusion has two sources: ignorance and maliciousness . People like Peter Holley are so deeply marinated in liberal ignorance that they can\u2019t tell the difference between American nationalism and racial nationalism\u2013between the desire to put American interests first and white racial consciousness. \\nAs I have explained elsewhere , the maliciousness involved looking for racial dissidents who supported Donald Trump and then arguing that since \u201cracists\u201d backed him, Trump must be a \u201cracist,\u201d too. When Mr. Trump didn\u2019t denounce David Duke and \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d fiercely enough to suit them, they claimed this was proof he is a secret sympathizer. They were wrong. He just doesn\u2019t like being pushed around by journalists who hates him. \\nThe pro-Hillary media therefore created a Frankenstein monster\u2013an imaginary Donald Trump who secretly wants to make America white again. They called him a bigot, a xenophobe, a fascist, a threat to democracy and, of course, the new Hitler. They hoped this would frighten enough voters into the Hillary camp to stop Mr. Trump, but it didn\u2019t work. And now they are stuck with a Frankenstein president elect who, they are convinced, comes running to me for policy tips. \\nYesterday, Senator Harry Reid issued an idiotic press release that included these lines: \\nWhite nationalists, Vladimir Putin and ISIS are celebrating Donald Trump\u2019s victory, while innocent, law-abiding Americans are wracked with fear\u2013especially African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Muslim Americans, LGBT Americans and Asian Americans. \\nIt is because she has heard so many Frankenstein stories that poor Gloria in Fort Worth\u2013a US citizen\u2013thinks the real Trump message is that non-whites don\u2019t belong in America. \\nAnd she\u2019s hardly alone. \\nJason Perez (right) a university student in Hawaii, writes that \u201cthe next four years will be a living nightmare for all Hispanic Americans.\u201d Mercedes Rosales , a high school senior in Homestead, Florida, says Mr. Trump \u201cjust wants to get rid of Mexicans, or Latinos.\u201d Maria Perez , also of Homestead, says, \u201cBecause of the example of Donald Trump . . . now they can look at you and see you are an immigrant and kill you.\u201d Mary Rabago , a Hispanic journalist living in Arizona, explains the election results: \u201cHate won.\u201d \\nThe Muslim reaction is just as nutty. Asaad Alabdulaziz, an Iraqi who recently became a US citizen , asks, \u201cDo I have to go back?\u201d Sahar Aziz , a professor at the Texas A&M University, says that \u201cthe general mood I am seeing among Muslims is concern that a Trump presidency will be open season on them.\u201d \\nNo one\u2013not once in the campaign\u2013ever talked about deporting law-abiding legal residents. So where did people get these deranged ideas? Obviously, from media caricatures. Hispanics are no doubt getting lurid stuff from the Spanish-language press as well. Telesur , a consortium based in Venezuela, reports that under a Trump presidency, \u201cthe rights of black and brown people, immigrants and women will suffer serious setbacks.\u201d \\nPeople like Peter Holley\u2013who created the caricature and believe in it\u2013are on such hair-trigger alert for \u201cracism\u201d that they can\u2019t conceive of a non-racial American nationalism that expresses itself in the ideas that helped Donald Trump win: Illegal immigrants should stay out. Illegals who are here should go home. There should be no sanctuary cities. Birth-right citizenship is crazy. Muslims are potentially troublesome. Legal immigration should be cut. \\nThere is nothing inherently racial about any of these ideas, and they appeal to millions of Americans who don\u2019t think in racial terms. But current dogma demands that we thrill to the idea that every brown-skinned newcomer\u2013whether he has a job or even speaks English\u2013is a precious addition to our \u201cgreatest strength,\u201d which is diversity. Anyone who supports policies that have the effect of slowing the march of diversity is a \u201cracist,\u201d and might as well be a dedicated AmRen reader or even a member of the Ku Klux Klan. That\u2019s why Peter Holley thinks Donald Trump wants my advice. \\nThe notion that Mr. Trump will hurt blacks is especially wrong, but it follows the usual sloppy liberal thinking: If you want to send home illegals it can only be because you hate Hispanics, which means you hate blacks, women, homosexuals, and Jews. Donald Trump wanted Confederate flags taken down in the South, is \u201cfine\u201d with affirmative action , and he blasted Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s critique of race preferences in universities. And only the most fevered imagination could have prompted the Salon headline: \u201c I Am a Gay Jew in Trump\u2019s America. And I Am Afraid for My Life .\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s close professional and family connections to Jews are well known . \\nIt is the widely circulated fantasies about Donald-Trump-the-racist that explain why Mexican-Americans and Muslims who are US citizens are reportedly crying themselves to sleep at night, and why there are violent anti-Trump demonstrations all over the country. Just as reckless anti-police reporting paved the way for the murders of policemen , frothing press coverage of Donald Trump has sent thousands of ignoramuses into the streets to smash store windows and attack cops. \\nThe papers are now full of breathless reports of Trump supporters calling blacks \u201cni**er\u201d and tearing hijabs off Muslim women. Some of these attacks were faked , but some are no doubt real. What do they reflect? What Donald Trump wants or what the Frankenstein wants? If loutish whites are telling Hispanics \u201cwe\u2019ll deport you,\u201d who gave them the idea that a modern-day Hitler is about to move into the White House? \\nThe Trump-is-a-racist idea is so firmly planted in the minds of Hillary supporters that nothing can dislodge it. But they don\u2019t even understand what they, themselves, mean by it. \\nJosh Harkinson of Mother Jones called me after the election to talk about the Alt-Right. I explained to him how the media have painted a dishonest picture of Donald Trump, and he conceded that he was beginning to realize that using his favorite word\u2013\u201cracist\u201d\u2013to describe the president elect and people like me might be a mistake. I congratulated him on this intellectual breakthrough, and then asked what Donald Trump has ever said or done that was \u201cracist,\u201d whatever that word means. \\n\u201cOh, there are so many, I don\u2019t know where to begin.\u201d \\n\u201cThen just tell me one.\u201d \\nThere was a brief silence. \u201cHe retweeted an image of himself as Pepe the frog.\u201d \\n\u201cWhat? Is that the best you can do? You\u2019re really straining.\u201d \\n\u201cYes, I guess I\u2019m straining.\u201d \\nMr. Harkinson later brought up Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion that Judge Gonazlo Curiel\u2019s Mexican ancestry meant he could not try the Trump University case fairly. I pointed out that Judge Curiel is a member of La Raza [the race] Lawyers, which gave Mr. Trump grounds to doubt his impartiality. \u201cBesides,\u201d I said, \u201cif a white police officer is in an altercation with a black criminal and ends up shooting him, you\u2019d be the first to say the officer was biased on account of his race.\u201d \\n\u201cNot the first.\u201d \\n\u201cThen the second.\u201d \\nWe live in a world of malicious fantasy. If members of that priestly class known as journalists\u2013everyone knows they are sternly objective\u2013call someone a \u201cracist\u201d that\u2019s what he is. And once you\u2019re a \u201cracist,\u201d you might as well be a sexist, xenophobe, anti-Semite, homophobe, and who knows what else. This is what we get when reporters slant the news and then believe what they read in the papers. And the media can\u2019t understand why no one trusts them anymore. \\nJared Taylor [ Email him ] is editor of American Renaissance and the author of Paved With Good Intentions: The Failure of Race Relations in Contemporary America .
