After mocking her, he argued her detractors should relent and allow her to speak, but also said that she didn\u2019t actually want to speak at Berkeley. \u201c[L]ook man, she\u2019s right about the free speech thing, but here\u2019s my opinion,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though Ann Coulter is clearly trolling and doing this for the publicity of not letting her speak, they should just let her speak. Because you realize, she doesn\u2019t actually want to speak. She wants to be stopped from speaking. \u201d \u201cThe truth is, a side effect of free speech is that there will always be hate speech,\u201d Noah added. \u201cIf you ban one, you risk banning the other. Like you might call Ann Coulter \u2018hate speech,\u2019 but then what\u2019s to stop Jeff Sessions from calling Black Lives Matter \u2018hate speech?\u2019 If there is one idea America has given the world, it\u2019s the idea of absolute free speech. \u201d (  Daily Beast) Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor'"}, "time": 1742561783.0226731}
