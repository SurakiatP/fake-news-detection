When Mr. Ali, whose father died last year, arrived at Reagan National Airport in Washington on Friday for a flight to Fort Lauderdale, Fla. he gave his Illinois identification card to a JetBlue agent to get his boarding pass, said his lawyer, Chris Mancini, who was traveling with him and witnessed the episode. Almost immediately, Mr. Ali was told that there was a problem and that the agent needed to call the Department of Homeland Security, Mr. Mancini said. Mr. Ali, 44, was asked his date of birth, where he was born and his Social Security number, Mr. Mancini said. After answering the questions, he was told that his   identification card, which expires in 2019 but is not a driver\u2019s license, was invalid for flying. \u201cThe same state ID from Illinois that he traveled to Washington on was rejected,\u201d Mr. Mancini said in an interview on Friday night. Mr. Ali then produced his United States passport, which was accepted, and went through security and boarded the flight with his mother, Khalilah   the second wife of Muhammad Ali, and Mr. Mancini. Mr. Mancini said that the episode lasted between 20 and 25 minutes. \u201cThis whole thing smacks of some sort of retaliation for his testimony,\u201d he said. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Democrat of Florida, was on the same flight, and posted about the episode on Twitter, saying that Mr. Ali had been \u201cdetained again. \u201d In a statement, the Transportation Security Administration disputed that the holdup at the ticket counter lasted long and said that Mr. Ali\u2019s jewelry caused a   delay at the security checkpoint. The agency said that it did not have the authority to detain passengers. \u201cUpon arriving at the airline   counter, a call was made to confirm Mr. Ali\u2019s identity with T. S. A. officials,\u201d the agency said. \u201cWhen Mr. Ali arrived at the checkpoint, his large jewelry alarmed the checkpoint scanner. He received a targeted   in the area of his jewelry to clear the alarm and was cleared to catch his flight. \u201d An agency spokesman did not immediately respond to a question about what prompted the additional scrutiny of Mr. Ali\u2019s identification. Mr. Mancini said he was baffled by the agency\u2019s statement because Mr. Ali did not complain about his treatment at security, only at  . Mr. Mancini said he was helping Ms.   through the checkpoint and did not notice that Mr. Ali had been stopped for additional scrutiny. \u201cThey are making up stories,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have never said anything about anything happening after he left the ticket counter. \u201d He said he planned to file a complaint with the Department of Homeland Security and was \u201cworking toward a lawsuit. \u201d \u201cPeople need to start paying attention to what\u2019s happening in our country,\u201d he said. \u201cOur rights are being eroded. \u201d The dispute between Mr. Ali and the Homeland Security Department, which oversees the T. S. A. follows an episode on Feb. 7 in which he and his mother were stopped for about an hour and a half at Fort   International Airport after returning from Jamaica. Mr. Mancini said then that Customs and Border Protection officials had asked Mr. Ali, \u201cWhere did you get your name from?\u201d and, \u201cAre you Muslim?\u201d Mr. Ali and his mother recounted their ordeal at a forum with House Democrats on Thursday and both spoke out against President Trump\u2019s new travel restrictions. \u201cI believe they were religiously and racially profiling me,\u201d Mr. Ali said of the officials, according to reports. When they arrived at the airport on Friday, Mr. Mancini said, he and Mr. Ali joked about whether they would face additional scrutiny because of his comments.'"}, "time": 1742562440.2532246}
