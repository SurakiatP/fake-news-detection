[The Thelma  Louise star made her prediction during an interview with People magazine that was published Friday.  \u201cI\u2019m excited and encouraged by the idea that maybe if everything\u2019s falling apart so obviously  \u2014   I mean, I don\u2019t think Trump\u2019s gonna make it through his whole term,\u201d Sarandon said. \u201cBut he\u2019s not the first one to have Goldman Sachs in his cabinet, he\u2019s not the one that started fracking wholeheartedly,\u201d she said of Trump\u2019s administration, which includes five people with ties to the Wall Street bank. \u201cSo where have we been? We\u2019ve been asleep. \u201d Sarandon, of course, was a committed supporter of Vermont\u2019s Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 White House bid. She accused what she called the \u201ccompletely corrupt\u201d Democratic National Committee of rigging the primary in favor of Hillary Clinton. The Academy   eventually endorsed Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein in a letter, writing that the \u201cfear of Donald Trump is not enough for me to support Clinton, with her record of corruption. \u201d Now, the    actress, whose cleavage is turning heads on the red carpet at the Cannes Film Festival, says she\u2019s optimistic since average Americans are becoming more politically aware and involved. \u201cI\u2019m actually optimistic because I think we\u2019re seeing an amazing revolution happening,\u201d the star told People. \u201cNot by the people that claim to be political but by Americans, and I have great faith in America. You\u2019re seeing more people running that have never run for offices. \u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re acting and you\u2019re paying attention  \u2014   you have to constantly be calling your representatives,\u201d Sarandon added. \u201cAnd ultimately it could make a difference. \u201d Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @jeromeehudson.'"}, "time": 1742628478.2185864}
