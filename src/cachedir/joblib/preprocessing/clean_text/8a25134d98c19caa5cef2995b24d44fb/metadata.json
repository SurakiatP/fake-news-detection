G. B. T. protections, according to people familiar with the issue. A third, Gary D. Cohn, the chairman of the president\u2019s National Economic Council, a Democrat who was brought to the West Wing by Mr. Kushner and reflects the socially liberal and economically conservative views of many Wall Street power brokers, privately told aides to the president that he was disturbed it was even being considered. The executive order has exposed what is likely to be a persistent schism in Mr. Trump\u2019s paradoxical presidency: He is a cosmopolitan New Yorker who has long operated in an environment where sexual orientation is often an afterthought, but is nonetheless beholden to the social conservatives who backed him overwhelmingly in 2016, despite reports of his crudeness and sexual misdeeds. Mr. Kushner, a lifelong Democrat, and Ms. Trump, an independent, travel in liberal social circles and have long supported L. G. B. T. rights. Neither had seen the order before details were leaked. They expressed their dissatisfaction to Mr. Trump\u2019s other advisers, and then weighed in directly with the president, who opposes   marriage but has spoken out against discrimination. On Monday night, reports had swirled that Mr. Trump would sign some version of the rollback as a concession to social conservatives ahead of the president\u2019s announcement of a United States Supreme Court nominee. As a result, White House officials pushed out a statement asserting that Mr. Trump \u201cis determined to protect the rights of all Americans, including the L. G. B. T. Q. community,\u201d adding that the president \u201ccontinues to be respectful and supportive of L. G. B. T. Q. rights, just as he was throughout the election. \u201d The draft order, circulated by religious conservatives allied with Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, was one of about 250 edicts that have been sent to federal agencies for vetting. Mr. Trump never seriously considered signing the order, and did not need much convincing, people close to him said. Still, conservatives inside the Trump camp pressured the president to consider a version of a \u201creligious freedom\u201d measure, similar to one supported by Mr. Pence in 2015 while he was the governor of Indiana, according to two senior administration officials. Mr. Pence, however, did not personally push for the White House order, according to one of his allies. Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump\u2019s opposition to the draft was first reported by Politico. It came on the heels of an announcement by the Nordstrom department store chain that it will scale back on featuring Ms. Trump\u2019s clothing line from its stores, a public blow to a brand she has spent years cultivating. A day after the White House quashed the religious freedom order, at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, Mr. Trump offered religious conservatives an olive branch by proposing to eliminate a law that bars churches with Internal Revenue Service charity designations from making political endorsements. Some conservative leaders warned Mr. Trump that his decision to retain former President Barack Obama\u2019s order on L. G. B. T. rights could have   political implications. \u201cOur base would want to know who is responsible for what we believe is an issue of religious liberty  \u2014   that would be of concern to us,\u201d said Bob Vander Plaats, the chief executive of The Family Leader, a socially conservative organization. \u201cWe have been consistent,\u201d Mr. Vander Plaats added. \u201cWe\u2019ve cheered President Trump a lot. But on this one, our base is wondering why Obama\u2019s executive order would be allowed to stand?\u201d Tony Perkins, the president of the conservative Family Research Council, backed the draft order and said he believed Mr. Trump\u2019s opposition was only temporary. He pointed out that evangelicals were supportive of Mr. Trump during the campaign, and that there would need to be reconciliation between his support for religious liberty and his decision to uphold the L. G. B. T. order. \u201cHe gets it,\u201d Mr. Perkins said of the president. \u201cThey will have to fix it and they will. I\u2019m confident they will. Am I concerned? No. Not at this point. \u201d The topic of the order was a sensitive one in a West Wing that prides itself on decisiveness and bombast. \u201cThere are a lot of ideas that are being floated out,\u201d Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Thursday. \u201cPart of it is, the president does all the time, he asks for input, he asks for ideas. And on a variety of subjects there are staffing procedures that go on where people have a thought or an idea and it goes through the process. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562101.6655736}
