Just call me and let me check out the situation.\u201d \\nWilliams acknowledged that homeschool children can be mistaken for truants but urged citizens to report them so school authorities can investigate. \\n\u201cSometimes the community will see them around town and they think, \u2018Hey, they\u2019re not being educated.\u2019 Sometimes the community is right,\u201d Williams said. \\nHome School Legal Defense Association attorney TJ Schmidt wrote Williams and the Jackson County superintendent, saying that while truancy is a problem, homeschoolers should not be targeted. \\n\u201cYour statements suggest that everyone should report children they think aren\u2019t being educated,\u201d the letter read. \u201cIn our opinion, this is a threatening practice, and will instill a spirit of suspicion and hostility against homeschoolers in the community.\u201d \\nSchmidt wrote to Williams after a parent saw her on TV and complained to HSDLA. \\n\u00a9 Copyright Off The Grid News'"}, "time": 1742628430.3743496}
