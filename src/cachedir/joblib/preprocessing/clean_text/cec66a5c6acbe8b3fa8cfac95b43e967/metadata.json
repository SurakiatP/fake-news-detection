[The ad, launched by Steyer\u2019s NextGen Climate   group, claims that as CEO of ExxonMobil, Tillerson put his company\u2019s interests first and did business with Russia.   But Steyer, a former hedge fund manager, has his own record of doing business with the Russians. In 2010, Steyer\u2019s hedge fund Farallon Capital Management profited from a sale of its stake in a Russian oil firm to a investment firm owned by Russian billionaire Gennady Timchenko, according to the Free Beacon. Timchenko was later targeted by Treasury Department sanctions in 2014, due to his relationship with Vladimir Putin. Steyer, a committed supporter of environmental causes and Democrats, endorsed Hillary Clinton in June 2016, and hosted a fundraiser for her in 2015. \u201cTell your Senators to reject Rex Tillerson and protect American interests, not corporate interests,\u201d the   ad concludes. Steyer spent more than $75 million in in the 2016 election, as his NextGen Climate action group spent millions to combat Trump with ads including this one: Trump\u2019s transition team should expect environmental groups to unite against Tillerson\u2019s nomination, due to his former position as head of ExxonMobil.'"}, "time": 1742562017.0610888}
