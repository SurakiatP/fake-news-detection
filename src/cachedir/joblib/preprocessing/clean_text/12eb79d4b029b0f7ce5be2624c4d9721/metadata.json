Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017,   The Miami Herald notes that Trump did not appear to have a meeting with Tintori scheduled, but instead a dinner with former Republican primary rival Marco Rubio. The two appeared to agree to cooperate in the interest of helping Tintori and L\u00f3pez. Rubio delivered a speech on the Senate floor Wednesday demanding the United States do more to help L\u00f3pez and other political prisoners in the South American nation, arrested for organizing peaceful assemblies. Rubio delivered a speech on the Senate floor Wednesday in L\u00f3pez\u2019s defense, calling him \u201ca Venezuelan opposition leader who three years ago this week led peaceful demonstrations against the regime of Nicolas Maduro  \u2014   and he was thrown in jail for it. \u201d Of Tintori, he said she \u201cis an incredibly brave woman who does not rest as she continues advocating for her husband\u2019s release and the release of all political prisoners. And continues to fight for a free and democratic Venezuela. \u201d The Venezuelan government arrested L\u00f3pez in 2014 for organizing a peaceful   protest and sentenced him to 13 years in prison. Tintori has since taken on the mantle of advocating for the freedom of Venezuelans worldwide. In December, Tintori chained herself to the walls of the Vatican seeking a meeting with Pope Francis but did not receive an invitation. The Pope met with her once months before that protest. In his meeting with Venezuelan dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, however, Pope Francis vowed to \u201ctake any step that would contribute to resolving open questions and generate greater trust between the parties. \u201d President Trump repeatedly promised Latin Americans from oppressed countries that he would use the Oval Office to advocate for freedom in their homelands. He particularly singled out Venezuela and Cuba, the latter with which President Barack Obama expanded diplomatic relations, as requiring his attention. President Trump has also made empowering women a priority of his administration.  '"}, "time": 1742562137.8432178}
