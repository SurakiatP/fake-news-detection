The bill, titled the \u201cUnborn Child Protection from Dismemberment Abortion Act,\u201d would prohibit \u201cdismemberment\u201d abortions performed primarily during the second trimester of pregnancy.   The dialogue is as follows: Del. Sid Saab (SS) to ACLU attorney Rachelle Yeung (RY): You really think this is unconstitutional? RY: Yes, sir, I wouldn\u2019t have said it if I didn\u2019t believe that. SS: Do you think it\u2019s inhumane? RY: I\u2019m testifying on the legal aspects of this bill. SS: Right, but do you think it\u2019s inhumane? RY: No. SS: You don\u2019t? RY: No, sir. In her full testimony prior to questions, Yeung said: A method ban is essentially a ban on abortion prior to viability, which we\u2019ve already heard, would be unconstitutional. Even if it doesn\u2019t ban all forms of abortion, it would ban the safest, as you\u2019ve heard, and most common method of   abortions, which accounts for 95 percent of   abortions. This does create an undue burden on a woman\u2019s ability to seek an abortion, which would be unconstitutional. Seven other states have passed method bans: Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Kansas, and West Virginia. And in four of those states, the laws have already been challenged, and, in all four, the laws have been  \u2026    are currently blocked, by court order, from taking effect. So, for these reasons, we are due to issue an unfavorable report on H. B. 1167. Michele Hendrickson, eastern regional director for Students for Life of America, who testified in support of the legislation, reported her own observation that Yeung\u2019s response that dismemberment abortion is not \u201cinhumane\u201d was \u201csomething that made the entire room look up from their cell phones and left everyone in shock. Everyone, that is, except for representatives from NARAL, Planned Parenthood, and the ACLU. \u201d Panelists testifying on the legislation were shown a video, produced by   organization Live Action, that features former abortionist Dr. Anthony Levatino using medical animation to demonstrate a   DE surgical abortion. During this procedure, an abortionist uses instruments to dismember an unborn baby between 13 to 24 weeks into a pregnancy, and then extracts the parts from the uterus.  According to Levatino: After the amniotic fluid is removed, the abortionist uses a sopher clamp  \u2014   a grasping instrument with rows of sharp \u201cteeth\u201d  \u2014   to grasp and pull the baby\u2019s arms and legs, tearing the limbs from the child\u2019s body. The abortionist continues to grasp intestines, spine, heart, lungs, and any other limbs or body parts. The most difficult part of the procedure is usually finding, grasping and crushing the baby\u2019s head. After removing pieces of the child\u2019s skull, the abortionist uses a curette to scrape the uterus and remove the placenta and any remaining parts of the baby. Robin Elliott of Planned Parenthood of Maryland, who testified in opposition to the bill, said dismemberment abortion is a \u201cvery safe method\u201d used in abortion.
