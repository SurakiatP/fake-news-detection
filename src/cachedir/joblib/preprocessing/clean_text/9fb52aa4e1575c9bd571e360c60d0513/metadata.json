An aspirational deadline of Jan. 27 for repeal legislation has come and gone. The powerful retirees\u2019 lobby AARP is mobilizing to defend key elements of the Affordable Care Act. Republican leaders who once saw a health law repeal as a quick first strike in the Trump era now must at least consider a worst case: unable to move forward with comprehensive health legislation, even as the uncertainty that they helped foster rattles consumers and insurers. Insurers are threatening to exit the Affordable Care Act\u2019s market unless the Trump administration and Congress can quickly clarify their intentions: Will they support the existing public marketplaces, encourage people to sign up and keep federal assistance flowing to insurers, or not? \u201cWe need some certainty around the rules,\u201d said Dr. J. Mario Molina, chief executive of Molina Healthcare, which has been a stalwart in the Affordable Care Act market and is making money under the system. \u201cWe have a few months, but we don\u2019t have a lot of time,\u201d he said. With the official end on Tuesday of what was supposed to be its final open enrollment season, the Affordable Care Act is looking more resilient than it seemed just a month ago. It will still be several days before final enrollment figures are released, and although a surge of   signups failed to have materialize amid talk of repeal, early indications did not point to a collapse. At their annual retreat last week, in Philadelphia, several congressional Republicans edged away from their powerful promise to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d the Affordable Care Act. It would, they said, be more accurate to say they intend to fix a law that they blame for the cancellation of many insurance policies, soaring premiums and a shrinking choice of health plans in many states. Many Republicans say their resolve to dismantle the law, a central element of President Barack Obama\u2019s legacy, is undiminished. \u201cWe are looking to repeal this law, just like we told the voters we were going to do, just like we promised them we would do,\u201d said Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio and a leader of the House\u2019s most conservative wing. \u201cAfter all, there was an election where that was one of the most important issues. \u201d But after waging and winning many elections with a promise to kill it, Republicans still have no agreement on how to replace it. They will, they say, pursue a piecemeal approach because they have no desire to supplant the giant 2010 health law with a single comprehensive Republican plan cooked up in Washington. When Congress convened this year, Republicans immediately introduced a budget resolution clearing the way for legislation to gut the health law, with strong support from Mr. Trump, who took office 17 days later. But Mr. Trump\u2019s rocky start has slowed the momentum, depleting his political capital and dimming prospects for bipartisan cooperation. In addition, many senators are preoccupied with fights over the confirmation of Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees to the Supreme Court and top jobs in his administration. What was once considered Congress\u2019s Job No. 1 is being eclipsed for some lawmakers by more immediate matters. Insurers say Republicans\u2019 mixed messages and slowing pace could send premiums soaring next year while making the market much less stable. The deadline to file rates for 2018 is this spring, and insurers say they need time to decide what kinds of plans to offer and to set prices. \u201cWe need stability and predictability,\u201d said Marilyn B. Tavenner, the chief executive of America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the main lobby for the industry. Unless Congress continues   subsidies, to reduce    costs for   people, and a reinsurance program, to help pay large claims, she said, more insurers will pull out of the market. Insurers are also concerned about signs that the Trump administration may not enforce the   individual mandate, which requires people to have insurance or face a tax penalty. The penalty, or some way to encourage more participation, is seen as central to having enough young and healthy people sign up to keep premiums low. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to indicate how they are going to stabilize the market,\u201d said Karen M. Ignagni, the chief executive of EmblemHealth, who was instrumental in the development of the current law. At the very least, analysts say the uncertainty for insurers could lead to much higher rates. \u201c2018 is a wild card,\u201d said Deep Banerjee, who follows insurers for Standard  Poor\u2019s. Many insurers could simply end up walking away, warned Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University who recently surveyed insurers about what they might do. \u201cAt a certain point, you can\u2019t price high enough to account for that uncertainty,\u201d she said. The end game is perhaps predictable. In the Senate, Republicans will need help from Democrats to replace the health law because they hold 52 seats but will need 60 votes. Several Republican senators, like Susan Collins of Maine and Bob Corker of Tennessee, say they will not vote to repeal the law unless they have a clear picture of what will replace it. And Democrats will not support any replacement unless Republicans scrap the idea of an outright repeal, which conservatives have been demanding for years. \u201cWe can\u2019t repair the roof while Republicans and the president are burning the house down,\u201d said Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington. Republicans have many ideas about how to shore up insurance markets and lower costs. But it is highly unlikely that any of their proposals would be found by the Congressional Budget Office to insure as many people as the Affordable Care Act. Downbeat assessments from the budget office have doomed many proposals in the past, including the health care plan devised by Bill and Hillary Clinton in 1993. Mr. Trump chose Representative Tom Price, Republican of Georgia, to be his secretary of health and human services, with the expectation that he would work closely with Republicans in Congress on the details of a replacement plan. Democrats have delayed his confirmation, and that in turn has delayed Republican efforts to devise an alternative to the health care law they detest. Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee voted on Wednesday to recommend confirmation of Mr. Price, overriding objections by Democrats, who boycotted the proceedings. All of that turmoil in Washington has left insurers scrambling. \u201cWhile the direction in Washington has been positive, we still need certainty about   fixes in order to determine the extent of our participation,\u201d Joseph R. Swedish, the chief executive of Anthem, one of the nation\u2019s largest insurers and a major player in the market, told investors on Wednesday. Anthem said it expected to break even or make money selling individual coverage this year but said the market continued not to work as well as it could. \u201cWe have weighed in considerably, and continue to do so, with all the leadership in Congress,\u201d Mr. Swedish said.'"}, "time": 1742564043.9504354}
