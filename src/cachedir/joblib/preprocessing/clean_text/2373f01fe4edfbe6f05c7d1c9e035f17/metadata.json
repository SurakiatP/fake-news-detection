Jim is in Sydney this week, armed with his latest book, hot off the press entitled \u2018The Road to Ruin \u2013 The Global Elites\u2019 Secret Plan for the Next Financial Crisis\u2019 and gave an interesting television interview to \u2018The Business\u2019 on ABC Australia. \\nRickards says that Trump \u201cwill probably win\u201d and, if he does, stock markets will crash 10% and gold will rise $100 over night. \\nThe markets and polls believe Clinton will win and t hat is priced into markets in the same way that a \u2018Bremain\u2019 was priced into markets prior to the \u2018Brexit\u2019 vote. \\nKilkenomics 2016 \u2013 Where Comedy Meets Economics \\n\u201cIf Hillary wins nothing happens, if Trump wins you will have an earthquake.\u201d \\nShould Trump win, which looking at the polls is not an impossibility, gold would likely surge $100 per ounce overnight, says Rickards. \\nWhat Hillary did was appalling Rickards says in relation to the Clinton email scandal. There will be \u2018another reckoning on November 8th\u2019 which the market has failed to price in, creating a good scenario for gold. He says you don\u2019t have to agree that Trump will win, but agree that that in reality he could win. \\nFor Rickards, this is an excellent opportunity for investors, particularly those who have an allocation to physical gold which he believes is set to rise in the coming months and years. \\nJim is editor of Strategic Intelligence for Agora Financial as well as the founder of the James Rickards Project: an inquiry into complex dynamics of geopolitics and capital. He is also the author of New York Times bestsellers The New Case for Gold, Currency Wars: The Making of the Next Global Crisis and The Death of Money: The Coming Collapse of the International Financial System. \\nJim\u2019s newest book, The Road to Ruin will be published in November and he is appearing at Kilkenomics 2016 where he will speak at a number of events.'"}, "time": 1742563163.3807802}
