[In the prepared remarks, Comey confirms that he told Trump he was not under FBI investigation multiple times, as Trump has asserted.  Comey said he told the president on January 6, January 27, and on March 30 that he was not under investigation. They also show that Trump had never pressured Comey to drop the FBI\u2019s investigation of whether there was any collusion between his campaign and Russia. In fact, according to Comey, Trump had said it would be \u201cgood\u201d to find out of there were some \u201csatellite\u201d associates of his who did something wrong. In his remarks, Comey clarified conversations with Trump that his \u201cassociates\u201d relayed to the media  \u2014   which showed Trump never \u201cdemanded\u201d loyalty or \u201cpressured\u201d him to drop any investigation on Flynn or the broader Russia. According to a May 11 New York Times report, Trump had told Comey he \u201cneeded his loyalty. \u201d The headline read, \u201cIn a Private Dinner, Trump Demanded Loyalty. Comey Demurred. \u201d However, according to Comey\u2019s account, Trump never asked Comey to pledge his loyalty, and Comey never refused, as the Times reported. Trump had, according to the account, said, \u201cI need loyalty. I expect loyalty. \u201d Comey said he did not respond to the comment. Later in the conversation, he said Trump said again, \u201cI need loyalty,\u201d and that he responded, \u201cYou will always get honesty from me. \u201d He said the president then said, \u201cThat\u2019s what I want, honest loyalty,\u201d to which Comey said, \u201cYou will get that from me. \u201d Comey said he was not sure what the president meant, and he did not ask, leaving it unclear as to what Trump actually wanted from him and what he meant by \u201cloyalty,\u201d and in what context. As the Times also noted in the report, \u201cThroughout his career, Mr. Trump has made loyalty from the people who work for him a key priority, often discharging employees he considers insufficiently reliable. \u201d Comey also provided more context to a conversation he had with Trump on February 14, in which the president reportedly asked him to drop the FBI investigation on his former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, whom he had dismissed the day before. The Washington Post ran an article on May 16 that was headlined, \u201cNotes made by FBI Director Comey say Trump pressured him to end Flynn probe. \u201d However, Comey\u2019s account makes it far from clear that he was ever \u201cpressured. \u201d Comey said the president said, \u201cI hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go. \u201d Comey said the president then turned to the subject of leaks. Comey did not say whether he responded to the president\u2019s comment, which he characterized as a \u201crequest. \u201d A White House statement at the time said, \u201cthe president has never asked Mr. Comey or anyone else to end an investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn. \u201d Comey also clarified that he understood the president\u2019s comment as a request that any investigation of Flynn be dropped  \u2014   but not \u201cthe broader investigation into Russia or possible links to his campaign. \u201d The former FBI director also addressed why he did not tell anyone outside of senior FBI leadership about the President\u2019s comment. He said he did not pass on that information to others in the FBI because he didn\u2019t want to \u201cinfect\u201d the investigative team, and because he did not intend to abide by the request. He also said he had nothing to corroborate his story (which he still does not) and that he didn\u2019t tell Attorney General Jeff Sessions because Sessions was expected to recuse himself from the investigation. They also decided not to tell the deputy attorney general, who would not long be there in that role. \u201cAfter discussing the matter, we decided to keep it very closely held, resolving to figure out what to do with it down the road as our investigation progressed,\u201d he said. Comey said the investigation actually \u201cmoved ahead at full speed. \u201d Comey does not explain why he never told anyone in Congress, including congressional committees that oversee the FBI. He will likely be asked on Thursday why he did not come to Congress. In fact, he told Sen. Mazie Hirono ( ) last month that a situation where the FBI was told to stop something for a political reason has \u201cnot happened in my experience. \u201d Comey said Trump had called him on March 30 and said the Russia investigation was like \u201ca cloud\u201d impairing his ability to act on behalf of the country, and asked what the FBI could do to \u201clift the cloud. \u201d Comey said he told him they were investigating the matter as quickly as they could. He said he again told Trump he was not being personally investigated. He said Trump had repeatedly told him, \u201cWe need to get that fact out. \u201d Comey said he did not tell the president that the FBI and Justice Department were reluctant to do that, since that would create a duty to correct the record if things changed, but that he would \u201csee what we could do\u201d to lift the cloud. \u201cI told him I would see what we could do, and that we would do our investigative work well and as quickly as we could,\u201d he said. Comey also said he called Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente for guidance, but he never received a call back. Trump would call back two weeks later asking what he had done to make it clear that he was not personally under investigation. Comey said Trump said he would \u201chave his people\u201d reach out to Boente, and that he told the President that was the way to go. Comey said Trump said he would do that and added, \u201cBecause I have been very loyal to you, very loyal we had that thing you know. \u201d But Comey said he wasn\u2019t sure what the President meant. \u201cThat was the last time I spoke with President Trump,\u201d Comey said.'"}, "time": 1742563923.9459133}
