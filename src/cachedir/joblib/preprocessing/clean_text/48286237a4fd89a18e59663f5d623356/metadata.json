In the short time he\u2019s held the post, he\u2019s produced one gaffe and embarrassment after another. Basically, he makes the previous ginger-haired smartass spokesgirl representing the United States, Jen Psaki, look like a genius. (Psaki left State to be Hillary\u2019s spokesgirl at the White House, only to find herself in the center of a gaggle of devastated aides as Barack Obama acknowledged Donald Trump as president-elect.) \\nIn State\u2019s latest charade, Kirby callously threw out more tired accusations of Russian aircraft bombing hospitals in Aleppo. The claims came from \u201ccredible relief organizations\u201d \u2014 probably State/CIA fronts created precisely for the sole purpose of making such accusations. Probably a lot like the \u201cSyrian Observatory for Human Rights,\u201d which is still cited by western propagandists even after it was demonstrated to be a western intel op with literally 1 guy sitting in a UK flat making crap up. \\nWhen questioned by RT reporter Gayane Chichakyan to specify which hospitals, Kirby refused, referring to the \u201crelief organizations.\u201d He then demanded Chichakyan ask \u201cher\u201d defense ministry to own up to bombing the apparently fictional hospitals. When Kirby was derided by AP\u2019s Matt Lee for his treatment of Chichakyan, he blustered, \u201c I\u2019m not putting Russia Today on the same level with the rest of you. \u201c \\n[embedded content] \\nUnable to defend his ludicrous claims, Kirby went ad hominem, attacking RT as \u201cstate owned\u201d \u2013 apparently forgetting that BBC, France24, Germany\u2019s ARD and ZDF, and many other western broadcasters are state-owned or controlled. \\nIn summary, the exchange went like this: \\nKirby : Russia has bombed civilian hospitals in Aleppo! \\nRT : Which hospitals were bombed? \\nKirby : I don\u2019t know, ask your defense ministry. \\nRT : If you tell us which ones, we can ask our defense minstry about them. \\nKirby : I don\u2019t know which ones, ask the relief agences. \\nRT : Which relief agencies? \\nKirby : I don\u2019t know which agencies\u2026..and by the way, RT is state-owned! So there! \\nJohnny\u2019s probably got a short fuse now that he knows his days of spinning out Ministry of Truth tripe are numbered. There is little prospect Donald Trump, who seeks rapprochement with Russia, will retain these useless, lying, neocon trained asshats in his administration. If they actually lied well, that would be a different story. But US diplomats are some of the worst fibbers in the business. Y ou almost have to pity the bastards. Maybe it\u2019s because to tell a good lie, you need a least a kernel of truth. They have literally zero facts on their side to work with. \\nAltogether one more pitiful, pathetic performance by the US Department of State, and another disgrace to the United States. And, we hope, while looking forward to the next US administration with guarded optimism, one of the last. Related '"}, "time": 1742561828.3124402}
