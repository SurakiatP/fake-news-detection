What are your thoughts? \\nVia TrueActivist \\n\\nWithout a doubt, religion is one of the more difficult topics to discuss. After all, the majority of wars that have taken place on this planet stem from religious differences. But when a retired bishop speaks out about practices conducted and condoned by the world\u2019s largest religious institution, his thoughts on the matter are worth hearing and considering.\\nVideo Below. Regardless of your opinion on religion, spirituality, and the Catholic church, we implore you to keep an open mind as you listen to the interview between retired Episcopal Bishop John Shelby Spong and Keith Morrison of Dateline NBC. Originally recorded in August of 2006, the clip has gone viral numerous times because it features Spong explaining that the Catholic church invented Hell in order to control the populace through fear.\\nDuring a nationally televised interview, Spong explains why \u2018Hell\u2019 is essential for the church\u2019s survival. He says,\\n\u201cReligion is always in the control business, and that\u2019s something people don\u2019t really understand. It\u2019s in a guilt-producing control business. And if you have Heaven as a place where you\u2019re rewarded for your goodness, and Hell is a place where you\u2019re punished for your evil, then you sort of have control of the population. And so they create this fiery place which has quite literally scared the Hell out of a lot of people, throughout Christian history. And it\u2019s part of a control tactic.\u201d\\n\u201cThe church doesn\u2019t like for people to grow up, because you can\u2019t control grown-ups. That\u2019s why we talk about being born again. When you\u2019re born again, you\u2019re still a child. People don\u2019t need to be born again. They need to grow up. They need to accept their responsibility for themselves and the world,\u201d Spong adds.\\nA partial transcript of the interview follows: Spong: I don\u2019t think Hell exists. I happen to believe in life after death, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s got a thing to do with reward and punishment. Religion is always in the control business, and that\u2019s something people don\u2019t really understand. It\u2019s in a guilt-producing control business. And if you have Heaven as a place where you\u2019re rewarded for you goodness, and Hell is a place where you\u2019re punished for your evil, then you sort of have control of the population. And so they create this fiery place which has quite literally scared the Hell out of a lot of people, throughout Christian history. And it\u2019s part of a control tactic .\\nMorrison: But wait a minute. You\u2019re saying that Hell, the idea of a place under the earth or somewhere you\u2019re tormented for an eternity \u2013 is actually an invention of the church?\\nSpong: I think the church fired its furnaces hotter than anybody else. But I think there\u2019s a sense in most religious life of reward and punishment in some form. The church doesn\u2019t like for people to grow up, because you can\u2019t control grown-ups. That\u2019s why we talk about being born again. When you\u2019re born again, you\u2019re still a child. People don\u2019t need to be born again. They need to grow up. They need to accept their responsibility for themselves and the world.\\nMorrison: What do you make of the theology which is pretty quite prominent these days in America, which is there is one guaranteed way not to go to hell; and that is to accept Jesus as your personal savior.\\nSpong: Yeah, I grew up in that tradition. Every church I know claims that \u2018we are the true church\u2019 \u2013 that they have some ultimate authority, \u2018We have the infallible Pope,\u2019 \u2018We have the Bible.\u2019\u2026 The idea that the truth of God can be bound in any human system, by any human creed, by any human book, is almost beyond imagination for me.\\nI mean, God is not a Christian. God is not a Jew or a Muslim or a Hindi or Buddhist. All of those are human systems, which human beings have created to try to help us walk into the mystery of God. I honor my tradition. I walk through my tradition. But I don\u2019t think my tradition defines God. It only points me to God.\\n'"}, "time": 1742562219.6140442}
