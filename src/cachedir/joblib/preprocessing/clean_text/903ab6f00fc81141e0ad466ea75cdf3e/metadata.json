Among Republicans, 31 percent have at least a college degree, up only slightly from 28 percent in 1992. As a consequence, a greater proportion of Democrats than Republicans now have a college degree or more education. \\nIn the New York Times last week, political sage Thomas Edsall called this process the \u201cGreat Democratic Inversion.\u201d \\nWhat these figures suggest is that the 2016 election will represent a complete inversion of the New Deal order among white voters. From the 1930s into the 1980s and early 1990s, majorities of downscale whites voted Democratic and upscale whites voted Republican. Now, looking at combined male and female vote totals, the opposite is true. \\nA key word in Edsall\u2019s analysis is \u201cwhite.\u201d Stories about the disaffected working-class supporters of Donald Trump apply almost exclusively to white voters. Other working-class voters\u2013blacks and Hispanics \u2013are poised to provide lopsided support to Hillary Clinton. \\n{snip} \\nThere is no expansive, working-class rage in the U.S. There is white conservative rage (along with a more modest left-wing version). While it may burn brightest in deindustrialized America, conservative rage extends across class and educational demarcations, from blue collars to billionaires . \\nThis complicates the story of the parties switching class allegiances. For Democrats, it leaves them managing an increasingly unwieldy coalition extending from white cosmopolitan millionaires who send their kids to private schools to low-paid Hispanic service workers and black factory and office workers facing economic dislocation. {snip} \\nKeeping that coalition pointed in the same general direction might be impossible without the dedicated efforts of the Republican Party. The GOP has proved incapable of breaking out of its racial straitjacket. So it has opted instead to tighten the straps around its torso. \\n{snip} \\nRepublicans\u2019 constant struggle with racism in their ranks, and their recurring failure to resist the temptation to exploit it, eases pressure on the Democrats\u2019 sprawling coalition. The parties won\u2019t fully exchange their class identities for the simple reason that working-class blacks and Hispanics can\u2019t trust the GOP to represent them. \\nIf it doesn\u2019t diversify and become more accommodating to nonwhites, the GOP will only grow crazier and scarier , and its effort to wield power with the support of a shrinking white base will become even more extreme. {snip} \\n{snip}'"}, "time": 1742561699.2890012}
