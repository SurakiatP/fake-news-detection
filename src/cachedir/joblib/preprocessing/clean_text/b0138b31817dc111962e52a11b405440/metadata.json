PT, but Hollywood\u2019s biggest stars have already begun arriving on the red carpet. Jimmy Kimmel hosts this year\u2019s ceremony live from the Dolby Theater in Hollywood.  The storylines to watch:  \u2014   How many wins can the musical La La Land rack up out of its record 14 total nominations? Director Damien Chazelle and leads Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are all hoping for big nights in their respective categories, though Gosling faces stiff competition from Denzel Washington (Fences) and Casey Affleck (Manchester by the Sea).  \u2014   Which stars will use the Oscars stage to launch   Trump tirades? Meryl Streep  \u2014   up for a record 20th Oscar nom for Florence Foster Jenkins  \u2014   is set as a presenter, so there is a decent possibility of a Golden   encore, but it could really come from all angles tonight. Look out for Kimmel to zing Trump in his opening monologue.  \u2014   Mel Gibson\u2019s Hacksaw Ridge is up for six awards, but don\u2019t expect him to win Best Director. Chazelle is the overwhelming favorite in the category, though Kenneth Lonergan (Manchester by the Sea) or Barry Jenkins (Moonlight) could pull it out. Follow along with Breitbart News as the Oscars get underway in Los Angeles. Latest updates at the top. All times Pacific.   9:25 P. M.  \u2014   That\u2019s it for the livewire. Stay tuned for some   coverage, including what just happened with the Best Picture announcement, which was probably the most epic gaffe in Oscars history. So long for now,  . N.  . H. 9:13 P. M.  \u2014   Good god. This has got to be the most surreal ending to an Oscars broadcast ever. Moonlight has won Best Picture. Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway read the wrong title off the card, announcing La La Land as Best Picture. Kimmel blames Steve Harvey. No one in the audience can quite believe it. This is an epic  . More coming shortly. New rule: After that astonishing #Oscars gaffe, no one in Hollywood can make fun of @realDonaldTrump for anything over the next eight years.  \u2014   Joel B. Pollak (@joelpollak) February 27, 2017,  9:03 P. M.  \u2014   Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway appear together on stage to present Best Picture. Awesome. 9:00 P. M.  \u2014   One more big one to go. With 11. 9 seconds left in the fourth, Clippers: 113, Hornets: 113. 8:55 P. M.  \u2014   Emma Stone wins her first Oscar, Best Actress for La La Land. An emotional Stone gives a heartfelt   to the other actresses in the category and thanks her family and the filmmakers. 8:48 P. M.  \u2014   Casey Affleck wins Best Actor for Manchester by the Sea. Wow. I thought Denzel had this one on lock. Looks like Affleck got his   out of the way last night, though, because this acceptance speech is short and sweet. \u201cI wish I had something bigger and more meaningful to say. \u201d We don\u2019t, so thanks for keeping it short. 8:43 P. M.  \u2014   At 32, Damien Chazelle becomes the youngest director ever to win the Best Director prize, for La La Land. 8:34 P. M.  \u2014   Barry Jenkins and Tarrell Alvin McCraney win Best Adapted Screenplay for Moonlight. Both men wear ACLU ribbons, and get slightly political with their speeches. Jenkins vows to work over the next four years to inspire those who feel they\u2019re not represented in films, while McCraney dedicates the award to boys, girls and \u201c  conforming\u201d young people. Barry Jenkins: \u201dFor the next 4 years it will not be you alone. We will not forget you.\u201d #Oscars pic. twitter.   \u2014   Hollywood Reporter (@THR) February 27, 2017,  8:31 P. M.  \u2014   Kenneth Lonergan wins Best Original Screenplay for Manchester by the Sea. Some observers thought this one was a lock for La La Land (Chazelle) or even Hell or High Water (Taylor Sheridan) so this is a big win for Lonergan. 8:28 P. M.  \u2014   Ok, this is great. Kimmel is participating in the celebrity \u201cinspiration\u201d videos, talking about how his nemesis Matt Damon has inspired him. The movie that most inspired him is Damon\u2019s We Bought a Zoo. The Oscars announcer introduces \u201cBen Affleck and Guest,\u201d as Affleck and Damon take the stage. The music guy cuts off Damon every time he tries to speak. The camera pans back and it\u2019s Kimmel directing the orchestra. Probably the funniest bit of the night. 8:26 P. M.  \u2014   With 8:44 to go in the fourth, Charlotte has taken the lead. Clippers: 89, Hornets: 90. 8:20 P. M.  \u2014   Sara Bareilles performs along with the \u201cIn Memoriam\u201d segment. 8:18 P. M.  \u2014   Justin Hurwitz is back onstage along with Benj Pasek and Justin Paul to accept the award for Best Original Song, for \u201cCity of Stars\u201d from La La Land. 8:15 P. M.  \u2014   Justin Hurwitz wins Best Original Score for La La Land. No surprises there. 8:04 P. M.  \u2014   John Legend performs \u201cCity of Stars\u201d and \u201cAudition (The Fools Who Dream)\u201d from La La Land. 8:00 P. M.  \u2014   Linus Sandgren wins Best Cinematography for La La Land. Shouts out Damien Chazelle, who he calls a \u201cpoetic genius. \u201d 7:56 P. M.  \u2014    Javier Bardem talks about how much Meryl Streep has inspired him in a   segment. \u201cMeryl Streep is a goddess,\u201d Bardem says. With 9:08 left in the third, Clippers: 68, Hornets: 53. 7:51 P. M.  \u2014   Another shot at Trump. Kimmel is upset that Trump isn\u2019t tweeting about the Oscars. He tweets Trump directly: \u201cU up?\u201d And then again: \u201c#Merylsayshi. \u201d Jimmy Kimmel tweets at @realDonaldTrump during the #Oscars: \u201dMeryl says hi.\u201d pic. twitter.   \u2014   Hollywood Reporter (@THR) February 27, 2017,  7:49 P. M.  \u2014   Sing wins Best Live Action Short Film. Not that Sing, the other Sing. 7:45 P. M.  \u2014   The White Helmets, a film about aid workers in Syria, wins Best Documentary Short Subject. 7:43 P. M.  \u2014   At the half: Clippers: 57, Hornets: 51. 7:34 P. M.  \u2014   Seth Rogen describes how much he loves Back to the Future in a   segment, before stepping onstage with Michael J. Fox to present Achievement in Film Editing. Winner: John Gilbert, for Hacksaw Ridge. 7:30 P. M.  \u2014   The Jungle Book wins Best Visual Effects. A   win. The CGI animals in that movie looked completely real. 7:18 P. M.  \u2014   This is an interesting bit. A group of tourists on a guided tour of Hollywood are ushered into the Oscars, to their astonishment. The celebrities play along, including Denzel Washington and Mahershala Ali, who lets the tourists touch his Oscar. We\u2019ll get video of the segment up shortly. Watch Denzel Washington marry two of Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s surprise guests at the #Oscars. pic. twitter.   \u2014   Hollywood Reporter (@THR) February 27, 2017,  7:14 P. M.  \u2014   David Wasco and Sandy   win Best Production Design for La La Land. 7:11 P. M.  \u2014   Byron Howard, Rich Moore and Clark Spencer win Best Animated Feature Film for Zootopia. In presenting the award, Mexican actor Gael   makes a political statement: \u201cAs a   as a migrant worker, as a human being, I\u2019m against any form of wall that wants to separate us. \u201d 7:09 P. M.  \u2014   Piper wins Best Animated Short Film. 7:05 P. M.  \u2014   Ah, here\u2019s the New York Times\u2018   Oscars ad, placed right in the middle of the broadcast: 7:02 P. M.  \u2014   Sting performs a portion of his   song \u201cThe Empty Chair,\u201d from the film Jim: The James Foley Story. 6:56 P. M.  \u2014   Charlize Theron and Shirley MacLaine appear together to present Best Foreign Language Film. Winner: The Salesman.   Asghar Farhadi, the director of The Salesman, boycotted the Oscars over Trump\u2019s temporary immigration ban. Instead, someone else accepts the award on his behalf, and reads a statement from the director in which he calls Trump\u2019s executive order \u201cinhumane. \u201d Full statement read on behalf of Asghar Farhadi, winner for Iranian film \u201dThe Salesman.\u201d #Oscars pic. twitter.   \u2014   Washington Examiner (@dcexaminer) February 27, 2017,  \u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m not with you tonight. My access is out of respect for the people of my country and those of six other nations who have been disrespected by the inhumane law that bans entry of immigrants to the U. S.,\u201d the statement read. \u201cDividing the world into us and our enemies categories creates fear. Filmmakers can turn their cameras to create and capture human qualities. They create empathy between us and others. These wars prevent democracy and human rights in countries which have themselves been victims of aggression. \u201d \u201c6:55 P. M.  \u2014   Kimmel jokes that Viola Davis was just nominated for an Emmy for her acceptance speech. Introduces a segment in which current stars talk about the stars of the past that inspired them. First up is Charlize Theron talking about Shirley MacLaine. Seems pretty late into the broadcast to be introducing a segment like this. This show is gonna go on for well over 3 hours. Get comfortable. 6:44 P. M.  \u2014    Viola Davis wins her first Oscar, Best Supporting Actress for Fences. Davis was a lock for this category. An emotional Davis says when people ask her what stories she wants to tell, she points out that dead people in graveyards have stories that are never told. \u201cWe\u2019re the only profession to celebrate what it means to live a life. \u201d Video of Davis\u2019 speech: Viola Davis: \u201dI became an artist because we are the only profession that celebrates what it means to live a life.\u201d #Oscars pic. twitter.   \u2014   Hollywood Reporter (@THR) February 27, 2017,  6:29 P. M.  \u2014   Kevin O\u2019Connell, Andy Wright, Robert MacKenzie and Peter Grace win Best Sound Mixing for Hacksaw Ridge. Go see this movie. #HacksawRidge wins for Best Sound Mixing at the #Oscars! pic. twitter.   \u2014   Entertainment Weekly (@EW) February 27, 2017,  6:28 P. M.  \u2014   Syvain Bellemare wins Best Sound Editing for Arrival. This may be the only award the brainy   movie wins all night. 6:23 P. M.  \u2014   Kimmel roasts Trump again by introducing Academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs, \u201ca president who believes in both arts and sciences. \u201d More Trump shade from Kimmel #Oscars pic. twitter.   \u2014   Mashable (@mashable) February 27, 2017,  Boone Isaacs praises the Academy and the nominees\u2019 increasing diversity in a brief speech. 6:15 P.

J.: Made in America wins Best Documentary Feature. Oscar purists were upset that O. J. was allowed into the category, as it\u2019s essentially an   miniseries. Edelman dedicates his award to \u201cvictims of police violence, police brutality,   violence and criminal injustice. \u201d Oscar winner for \u201dO. J.: Made in America\u201d dedicates award to victims of police brutality #Oscars pic. twitter.   \u2014   Washington Examiner (@dcexaminer) February 27, 2017,  Kimmel: \u201cO. J. you get an extra slice of bologna on your sandwich tonight. \u201d 6:09 P. M.  \u2014   Kimmel gets in a shot at Ben Carson by calling Dr. Strange the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. The political jokes are flying fast and furious tonight. 6:01 P. M.  \u2014   Colleen Atwood wins Best Costume Design for Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. 5:59 P. M.  \u2014   Suicide Squad\u2018s makeup and hair team wins Best Makeup and Hairstyling. \u201cI\u2019m an immigrant. I come from Italy. This is for the immigrants. \u201d 5:56 P.

M.  \u2014   No surprises with the night\u2019s first award as Mahershala Ali wins Best Supporting Actor for Moonlight. 5:35 P. M.  \u2014   Kimmel is on. \u201cThis broadcast is being viewed by millions around the world, and in 225 countries that now hate us. \u201d Kimmel says the country is divided, and that he\u2019s been told he needs to say something to unite us. Says there\u2019s only one \u201cBraveheart\u201d in the room, and he\u2019s not going to unite us. Cue an awkward pan to Mel Gibson. Wow. Kimmel urges the audience to reach out to one person you have a disagreement with, not as a liberal or conservative, and have a positive conversation with them. That would be a way to \u201cmake America great again,\u201d he says. But the moment is   as Kimmel calls President Trump a racist just one minute later. He thanks the president: \u201cRemember last year when we thought the Oscars were racist?\u201d The host also roasts the stars by saying (rightly) that no one came out to see their films. Gives a special   to Meryl Streep, who gets a standing ovation from the Oscars audience: \u201cNice dress. Is that an Ivanka?\u201d Full video of Kimmel\u2019s monologue: Jimmy Kimmel: \u201dI want to say thank you to President Trump   \u2026     last year it seemed like the #Oscars were racist.\u201d pic. twitter.   \u2014   Hollywood Reporter (@THR) February 27, 2017,  5:30 P.
