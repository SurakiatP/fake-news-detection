[\u201cThe call to step down must come from my party, my party at congress, my party at central committee,\u201d Mugabe said in excerpts from a radio broadcast that will air this week and that were printed in the   Sunday Mail newspaper.  \u201cBut then what do you see? It\u2019s the opposite. They want me to stand for elections. \u201d \u201cThe majority of the people feel that there is no replacement, a successor who to them is acceptable, as acceptable as I am,\u201d he added. Mugabe, who has kept an iron grip on power since Zimbabwe declared independence in 1980, has repeatedly denied reports of health problems, fuelled in part by frequent trips to Dubai and Singapore. He once quipped that he would rule until he turned 100. \u201cOf course if I feel that I can\u00b4t do it any more, I will say so to my party so that they relieve me. But for now, I think I can\u00b4t say so,\u201d he said. But Mugabe, long known for his fiery speeches, has appeared unusually subdued in recent public appearances, speaking slowly and keeping his addresses short. In September, he read a speech to parliament, apparently unaware that he had delivered the same address a month earlier. Zimbabwe\u2019s economy has crumbled during Mugabe\u2019s rule, and opponents of his regime are brutally repressed by security forces. Inflation is rampant, and in recent months the country has experienced cash shortages, with the government struggling to pay civil servants. In December, however, Mugabe\u2019s   party endorsed him once again as its candidate for 2018 elections, but rival factions in the party are already jostling to succeed him. He surprised many in the party in 2014 by naming his wife, Grace, head of its influential women\u2019s wing, spurring rumours that she could be nursing her own presidential ambitions. And last week, Grace Mugabe, 51, appeared to dash any opponent\u2019s hopes for succeeding him, saying voters would continue to back Mugabe even when he is dead. \u201cOne day when God decides that Mugabe dies, we will have his corpse appear as a candidate on the ballot paper,\u201d she said. \u201cYou will see people voting for Mugabe as a corpse. \u201d In the broadcast, Mugabe applauded US President Donald Trump for promoting nationalist policies that he said echoed his \u201cZimbabwe for Zimbabweans\u201d stance. \u201cBut he is a radical. I don\u2019t know whether the construction of the wall between America and Mexico is feasible, a feasible proposal. It appears quite nasty. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561761.9589748}
