They had built it over 13 years into an art gallery, bistro, flower shop and framing service. They even rented out the chapel, with its bright stained glass windows, for social events. But three years ago, the Odgaards refused to rent the quaint site to two gay men for a wedding, saying it would violate their religious beliefs about marriage. The men filed a civil rights complaint, and the Odgaards settled, paying a penalty because it is illegal to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. After the controversy, regular customers stopped coming. Friends and family members stopped speaking to them. The Odgaards were vilified as bigots and haters. But it was not long before the Odgaards found themselves cast as heroes as well. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, then a Republican candidate for president, visited the Odgaards\u2019 business and videotaped a sympathetic interview with them. They joined a troupe of business owners upheld as Christian martyrs in the nation\u2019s culture wars: the cake baker, the florist and the photographers who stood up for their religious beliefs and lost legal battles. They received a standing ovation at a Cruz rally and signed on as \u201creligious liberty ambassadors\u201d in his campaign. Now, a year later, the Odgaards and other conservative evangelicals interviewed in central Iowa say they feel as if they have been abandoned. Many say that they have no genuine champion in the presidential race and that the country has turned its back on them. Americans are leaving church,   marriage is the law of the land, and the country has moved on to debating transgender rights. While other Americans are anxious about the economy, jobs and terrorism, conservative Christians say they fear for the nation\u2019s very soul. Some worry that the nation has strayed so far that God\u2019s punishment is imminent. So, in a year when many voters see nothing but bad choices, many evangelicals feel deeply torn. Long part of a reliable Republican voting bloc, many are appalled to find Donald J. Trump their only alternative to Hillary Clinton. They say he has taken positions all over the map on   couples and abortion and does not have the character to be president. Others are still bewildered that Mr. Trump defeated not only Mr. Cruz  \u2014   a pastor\u2019s son who made \u201creligious liberty\u201d a signature issue  \u2014   but also half a dozen other conservative Christian contenders they would have gladly supported. Nevertheless, polls show that the vast majority of evangelicals are now coalescing around Mr. Trump, largely out of fear that a President Clinton will appoint liberal Supreme Court justices. The change in America seemed to happen so quickly that it felt like whiplash, the Odgaards said. One day, they felt comfortably situated in the American majority, as Christians with shared beliefs in God, family and the Bible. They had never even imagined that two people of the same sex could marry. Overnight, it seemed, they discovered that even in   Iowa they were outnumbered, isolated and unpopular. Everyone they knew seemed to have a gay relative or friend. Mr. Odgaard\u2019s daughter from his first marriage disavowed her father\u2019s actions on Facebook, and his gay second cousin will not speak to him. Even their own Mennonite congregation put out a statement saying that while the denomination opposes gay marriage, \u201cnot every congregation\u201d or Mennonite does. Mrs. Odgaard, 64, the daughter of a Mennonite minister, was devastated. \u201cIt all flipped, so fast,\u201d said Mr. Odgaard, a patrician    who favors khakis and boat shoes. \u201cSuddenly, we were in the minority. That was kind of a scary feeling. It makes you wonder where the Christians went. \u201d The beginning of the end of the Odgaards\u2019 familiar life came Aug. 3, 2013, when Lee Stafford and Jared Ellars arrived at the Odgaards\u2019 gallery, G\u00f6rtz Haus. The couple were in a panic because the hotel they had booked for their wedding had gone bankrupt two months before the date, and they had already sent the invitations out. Mr. Odgaard spent about 45 minutes showing them the property and figuring out seating, flowers and how many guests needed   meals. It was only when Mr. Odgaard asked if it was a   wedding that his tone changed, they said. \u201cI\u2019ll remember these words for the rest of my life,\u201d said Mr. Ellars, 35, a database administrator. \u201cHe looked at us and he said, \u2018I can\u2019t take your money, and we don\u2019t do anything for free. \u2019\u201d The couple, together for 13 years, say they never wanted the Odgaards to go out of business. They say they wanted them to stop discriminating against gay people and never put another gay couple through the rejection they experienced. The case was settled in arbitration, and the Odgaards had to pay $5, 000 to Mr. Stafford and Mr. Ellars, which they donated to an   program for gay students. Their wedding was held in a barn, officiated by a minister with the Disciples of Christ church that Mr. Stafford attends. To this day, Mr. Stafford, who is 43 and a business systems analyst, is troubled that the debate over religious liberty appears to be \u201cso \u201d he said. \u201cTheir religious beliefs say they don\u2019t approve of gay marriage, but my religious beliefs say that we can,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy does their religion trump mine?\u201d About a year ago, the Odgaards sold G\u00f6rtz Haus to Harvest Bible Chapel, a church   that had been meeting in rented quarters. Its senior pastor, Ryan Jorgenson, 36, leads Sunday services in sneakers and jeans. He was trained and sent to Des Moines three years ago by a   network of conservative evangelical churches based in Elgin, Ill. that believe the Bible is God\u2019s inerrant word. Mr. Jorgenson jumped at buying the Odgaards\u2019 picturesque property on the busiest street in Grimes, a suburb of Des Moines. He converted the lower floor, where the flower shop once stood, into a children\u2019s ministry, and installed soundproofing to insulate the children\u2019s ruckus downstairs from the electric guitars and drums of the church\u2019s worship band upstairs. He liked the symbolism of converting a landmark site that had represented a defeat for conservative Christians into an outpost for preaching \u201cGod\u2019s word, without apology,\u201d he said. The church now draws up to 300 on a weekend, and is already outgrowing the space. On a recent weekday, the secretary sat working on a stool in a hall closet. The staff was planning a conference to teach Christians how to evangelize to atheists, agnostics and Mormons. It is necessary to train believers to hold their own, the pastor said, because \u201cmainstream biblical Christianity is less and less mainstream. \u201d On Sundays, he notices that half of his neighbors do not even go to church. He expects that more and more Christians will, like the Odgaards, suffer \u201cpersecution\u201d for their beliefs. He regularly visits the Capitol in Des Moines to pray with and lobby legislators with the Family Leader, a conservative Iowa group. Mr. Jorgenson was among many Iowa pastors who publicly supported Mr. Cruz, though not from the pulpit, and he is not sure if he will vote for Mr. Trump in November, even though Mr. Cruz has now said he will vote for Mr. Trump. Mr. Jorgenson would not even consider voting for Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, and said he did not know anyone in his church who would. But asked how much hope he had that Mr. Trump would protect the religious liberty of conservative Christians, Mr. Jorgenson held his two fingers a   apart. \u201cMy hope is not ultimately in the government,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not of this world. Jesus is going to come back. He\u2019s going to bring the perfect government. Until then, we live in a world of sin. \u201d Melissa and Tom Berkheimer started attending Mr. Jorgenson\u2019s church after hearing him interviewed on Christian radio. They had become frustrated that their minister \u201cwatered down\u201d his sermons and never said a word about   marriage even after the Iowa Supreme Court legalized it in 2009. She is an accountant, he a chemist, and they met in a Christian chat room. They had something in common, aside from their faith: Mr. Berkheimer is   and Mrs. Berkheimer had lived in Japan, and her children from her first marriage are  . Over dinner at a steakhouse recently, the Berkheimers said they had nothing against gay people  \u2014   a refrain the Odgaards also repeatedly sounded. \u201cMy brother was a homosexual,\u201d Mrs. Berkheimer said. Her brother became a   Christian before he died of complications from AIDS many years ago, and she named her son after him, she said. She said she became seriously alarmed about the nation in the past year as Congress failed to cut off funding for Planned Parenthood after an   group released videos taken surreptitiously of the organization. The Berkheimers are in the \u201cNever Trump\u201d camp. \u201cI\u2019m worried for America if we don\u2019t turn away from abortion,\u201d said Mrs. Berkheimer, who is 48. \u201cI think our country is going to be punished, with a nuclear weapon. I don\u2019t think you can mock God forever. \u201d She quickly added that she was worried she would sound crazy saying such things. \u201cThe Truth\u201d 99. 3 FM, a Christian station that features daily clips of Mr. Jorgenson\u2019s sermons, broadcasts from a drab office building in a shopping center in Des Moines. In a studio on the sixth floor, the host of a daily afternoon talk show, J. Michael McKoy, known as Mac, sat at a broad table recently facing his three  . Leaning into the microphone, he asked his listeners, \u201cDo you boycott businesses that go against your walk with Jesus?\u201d Should Christians boycott Target for announcing that transgender people could use the restrooms of their choice, he asked, or Ikea for a winsome ad featuring gay families? Callers\u2019 reactions were mixed. A woman said Target \u201conly cares about political correctness. \u201d A man pointed out, \u201cEven gay parents need furniture. \u201d Mr. McKoy steered the conversation to the Odgaards. He had quietly played a part in their story: When Mrs. Odgaard was in the depths of despair over a boycott of G\u00f6rtz Haus, she often called Mr. McKoy, and he prayed with her. He introduced the Odgaards to Mr. Jorgenson, the young pastor looking for a permanent place for his church. On air, the radio hosts suggested that the Odgaards\u2019 story showed that Americans were developing a double standard on the notion of tolerance. \u201cI just wish that this tolerance went across the board for Christian businesses,\u201d said one host, Frank Thomas Holzhauser, who on air calls himself Frank (the Verse) Thomas  \u2014   a nod to his facility with Scripture. When the show ended, the hosts debated the election. Only Mr. Holzhauser said he was certain he would vote for Mr. Trump, but he admitted it had caused him to lose some friends who \u201ccan\u2019t stomach Trump. \u201d The others said they had not decided how they would vote. None had supported Mr. Trump in the Iowa caucuses. Mr. McKoy and Chris Rohloff had supported Senator Marco Rubio, Mr. Holzhauser had favored Ben Carson, and Bob Monserrate had backed Mr. Cruz. Mr. Rohloff said he had thought that Mr. Trump was finished last year, the moment he said at a candidates\u2019 forum in Iowa that he had never asked God for forgiveness. \u201cEveryone in the room just went, \u2018Are you kidding me?\u2019 Even if you\u2019ve never done it, you should at least know the right answer,\u201d Mr. Rohloff said. \u201cThat\u2019s a fundamental thing for Christians. \u201d But by late September, Mr. McKoy said in a telephone interview that he and his   had decided to vote Trump: \u201cIt\u2019s the lesser of two evils. And I don\u2019t know by how much. \u201d Some evangelicals in Iowa said Christians who praised Mr. Trump were giving Christianity a bad name. They blamed evangelicals in the South or \u201cNascar Christians\u201d who go to church only when car races are not on. Some Republicans are working to lift evangelicals\u2019 enthusiasm. Before Mr. Trump\u2019s arrival at Senator Joni Ernst\u2019s annual Roast and Ride in an arena at the Iowa State Fairgrounds in Des Moines last month, Steve Scheffler was working a crowd of bikers and farmers sitting on hay bales near the stage. Mr. Scheffler, the president of the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition, used a line borrowed from the conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly: \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for a perfect candidate, you will not find Jesus Christ\u2019s name on the ballot. \u201d He sounded exasperated with Christians who disparaged Mr. Trump. \u201cI hope the good Lord shows more grace to me as a sinner than these people show to Donald Trump,\u201d he said. On a recent Sunday, the Odgaards walked into the church and sat in the rear, where Mrs. Odgaard, an artist whose paintings once filled the space, used to design frames for customers. The seats  \u2014   stackable banquet chairs that the Odgaards had bought for their wedding business  \u2014   were nearly full of mostly young worshipers. They rested their coffee cups on the hardwood floor that the Odgaards had stripped of carpet and sanded when they bought the place, spending a week on their knees. One Sunday in church, the memories were so raw that Mrs. Odgaard said she began to cry and left for home. \u201cIt\u2019s like losing a child,\u201d Mr. Odgaard said. Mr. Jorgenson asked the congregation to stand, and the worship band struck up a catchy song called \u201cI\u2019m Going Free (Jailbreak),\u201d played with a hoedown lilt. The lyrics were projected onto a screen placed under faded windows that Mrs. Odgaard had painted long ago to resemble stained glass. While the worshipers clapped and pumped fists in the air, the Odgaards gamely sang along: \u201cJesus is my liberty. I\u2019m going free. \u201d Church members were invited to stay afterward for a quarterly meeting. Dylan Knudsen, a   made a major announcement. Harvest Bible Chapel had just been approved for a loan to buy the Odgaards\u2019 tidy red brick house next door. The Odgaards were about to move to another town. But they planned to keep attending Harvest Bible Chapel, Mr. Knudsen said. There was brief applause. \u201cPlease thank them,\u201d Mr. Knudsen said, \u201cfor their sacrificial role. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564330.4652367}
