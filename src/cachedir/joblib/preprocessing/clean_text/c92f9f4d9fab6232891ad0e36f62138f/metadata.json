Sawing the air with his tiny hands in a unmistakeably Hitlerian manner, he spat out a series of undeniably hateful anti-Semitic code words \u2026 like \u201cpolitical establishment,\u201d \u201cglobal elites\u201d and, yes, \u201cinternational banks.\u201d He even went so far as to claim that \u201ccorporations\u201d and their (ahem) \u201clobbyists\u201d have millions of dollars at stake in this election, and are trying to pass the TTP, not to benefit the American people, but simply to enrich themselves. He then went on to accuse the media of collaborating with \u201cthe Clinton machine,\u201d presumably to benefit these \u201cglobal elites\u201d and \u201cinternational banks\u201d and \u201clobbyists.\u201d \\nNow, a lot of folks didn\u2019t immediately recognize the secret meanings of these fascistic code words, and so mistakenly assumed that \u201cglobal elites\u201d referred to the transnational capitalist ruling classes, and that \u201clobbyists\u201d referred to actual lobbyists, and that \u201cbanks\u201d meant \u2026 well \u2026 you know, banks. As it turned out, this was completely wrong. None of these words actually meant what they meant, not in anti-Semitic CodeSpeak. So the mainstream media translated for us. \u201cPolitical establishment\u201d meant \u201cthe Jews.\u201d \u201cGlobal elites\u201d also meant \u201cthe Jews.\u201d \u201cBanks\u201d meant \u201cJews.\u201d \u201cLobbyists\u201d meant \u201cJews.\u201d Even \u201ccorporate\u2026'"}, "time": 1742564270.451069}
