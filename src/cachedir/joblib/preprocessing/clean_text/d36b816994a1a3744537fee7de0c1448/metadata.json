DMT use can often lead to people having deep and profound spiritual experiences and, as in Axwell\u2019s case, can lead to users making extreme lifestyle changing decisions. \\n\u201cI can finally see clearly, all of these years I thought I knew what I was doing but I was clueless, like a snowflake floating in a winter tundra,\u201d explained Axwell calmly. \\n\u201cI delved deep inside my mind and questioned my inner self about the fabric of time, the meaning of life and my purpose on earth,\u201d explained the enlightened DJ, \u201cI looked directly into the eyes of nature and all existence and I knew straight away that I wasn\u2019t a real DJ and I never had been. I\u2019m a fraud and my entire life has been a lie. I\u2019m just glad I found out while I\u2019m still young enough to make a change.\u201d \\n\u201cIm my heart I think I already knew. To be honest I think anyone who\u2019s ever heard Swedish House Mafia or any of my solo work or any of Steve (Angello) or Seb\u2019s (Ingrosso) solo work or any of the music myself and Seb made already knew. It\u2019s pretty obvious really,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut now it\u2019s official, I\u2019ve told the guys and they actually agree that they\u2019re not real DJs either but they\u2019re happy enough to keep living the masquerade because, to be honest, the money is rather good.\u201d \\n\u201cI however am ready to move on, to spread my wing and fly if you will,\u201d continued Axwell. \u201cI\u2019ve heard my new calling and I\u2019m ready to act on it. I\u2019m going to change my name to Acts Well which will be a reflection of all of my future behavior and I\u2019m also going to be opening a chain of fair-trade vegan tofu bars, which will employ only reformed convicts and double up as a shelter for sick animals. It\u2019s the least I can do after the plethora of shit music I\u2019ve inflicted on the world.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742563000.5385687}
