He hung his portrait in the Oval Office, and last spring criticized the Treasury Department\u2019s decision to take Jackson off the front of the $20 bill. And on Wednesday, Jackson\u2019s 250th birthday, Mr. Trump visited the Hermitage, Jackson\u2019s home in Nashville, where he laid a wreath at his tomb and paid tribute to Old Hickory\u2019s populism. \u201cIt was during the Revolution that Jackson first confronted and defied an arrogant elite,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cDoes that sound familiar?\u201d Jackson\u2019s historical reputation has declined sharply in recent decades, especially among Democrats. The party that once celebrated him as a central pillar has rushed to remove his name from symbolic places of honor, distancing itself from his record on slavery and the forced relocation of American Indian nations from the South. But Mr. Trump\u2019s visit, as it happens, came 50 years to the day after Lyndon B. Johnson laid a birthday wreath on Jackson\u2019s grave, one of a stream of presidential visitors including Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan, each of whom used Jackson to bolster his own vision. \u201cJackson was a forceful president who attracts presidents who believe in a forceful presidency,\u201d the Princeton historian Sean Wilentz, the author of the recent book \u201cThe Politicians and the Egalitarians\u201d (and himself a staunch liberal defender of Jackson) said via email. The roster of visitors, Mr. Wilentz added, showed that Jackson was once \u201cfirmly in the progressive pantheon. \u201d Heather Cox Richardson, a historian at Boston College who takes a less admiring view of Jackson than Mr. Wilentz, said the list reflected the   nature of the populism that Jackson injected into American politics. \u201cJackson can be seen in two very different ways, just as Americans look at populism in two different ways,\u201d she said. \u201cWe like it, because we like the idea of people having power over government. And we don\u2019t like it, because it has within it an undercurrent of racism and violence. \u201d Here\u2019s a look at how four presidents have invoked Jackson\u2019s complicated legacy. Roosevelt, a Republican and later a member of the Progressive Party, visited the mansion on Oct. 22, 1907, and reportedly coined the phrase \u201cgood to the last drop\u201d after being served a cup of Maxwell House coffee there. It\u2019s not clear what Roosevelt said about Jackson that day, but in his 1913 autobiography he cited \u201cGood King Andrew,\u201d as he put it, and Lincoln as the progenitors of the modern idea of the president as a strong leader who sets the nation\u2019s agenda. (Roosevelt also admired Alexander Hamilton, another strong nationalist, for the similar reasons.) \u201cRoosevelt really did change the office, and the two people he cites from the 19th century are Jackson and Lincoln,\u201d said David Greenberg, a historian at Rutgers University. \u201cJackson was a slave owner, and his Indian policy was reprehensible, but he definitely was a fighter for the people, against the moneyed interests,\u201d Mr. Greenberg said. \u201cThat\u2019s why Teddy Roosevelt admired him. \u201d Roosevelt, a Democrat, briefly visited the mansion and the grave site on Nov. 17, 1934, with Eleanor Roosevelt, while they were on their way to their retreat in Warm Springs, Ga. Mrs. Roosevelt also visited Alfred\u2019s Cabin, a former slave cabin that still stands on the property, and the couple went together to Fisk University, an   institution. In citing Jackson, Ms. Richardson said, Roosevelt generally spoke not of his racial record and what she called the \u201cincredibly racist version of Manifest Destiny\u201d Jackson promoted, but the idea that the government belong to the people, not the wealthy. \u201cThis was around the time that Jackson had gone on the $20 bill,\u201d Ms. Richardson noted. In 1940, at the annual Jackson Day dinner, Roosevelt paid tribute to a \u201cgreat man\u201d: not \u201cJackson the Democrat,\u201d he said, \u201cbut Jackson the American, who did the big job of his day  \u2014   to save the economic democracy of the Union for its westward expansion into a great nation, strengthened in the ideals and practice of popular Government. \u201d (Roosevelt\u2019s successor, Harry S. Truman, also visited the Hermitage, but before his presidency, when he was the presiding judge of the Jackson County court in Missouri, which was preparing to erect a statue of Jackson. His errand? Truman, a former haberdasher, apparently wanted to measure some of Jackson\u2019s clothes to make sure the statue was the right size, according to information compiled by the Hermitage.) Johnson and his wife, Lady Bird, had breakfast at the Hermitage on March 15, 1967, the 200th anniversary of Jackson\u2019s birth, after a   tour of Appalachia. In a speech, he acknowledged Jackson\u2019s record as a slaveholder but paid tribute to the \u201cpolitical transformation\u201d he had brought to American democracy, bringing power to the people while emphasizing the indivisibility of the Union, a stance Johnson contrasted with the states\u2019 rights ideology of another Southerner, the secessionist John C. Calhoun. Johnson, a Democrat, also painted an inclusive picture of Jackson\u2019s populism, linking it to his own Great Society agenda. \u201cWe are still striving to involve the poor, the deprived, the forgotten American, white and Negro, in the future of their society,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the task Jackson set is still undone. \u201d Julian E. Zelizer, a historian at Princeton, noted that in an address to the Tennessee legislature later that day, Johnson changed tack, talking about the Vietnam War and the need for the kind of \u201crugged confidence\u201d Jackson had. \u201cHe used Jackson the military hawk, not Jackson the populist,\u201d Mr. Zelizer said. \u201cHe used it to send a tough signal that victory was possible. \u201d Reagan visited the Hermitage on March 15, 1982, Jackson\u2019s 215th birthday, and also gave an address to the Tennessee legislature. The country had just fallen into a deep recession, Ms. Richardson said, and Reagan made the case for taking on what he saw as a bloated government. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to defend his idea, which wasn\u2019t popular even when he was elected by running on it, that if you get rid of regulations, cut back unions and cut taxes, you\u2019re going to create a magical return to the past,\u201d Ms. Richardson said. Reagan, a Republican, also cited Jackson as one in a line of western heroes, which Ms. Richardson said was \u201cnot an accident. \u201d \u201cHe is really deliberately trying to use Jackson to say, \u2018Everything I\u2019m trying to do as a movement conservative, I\u2019m doing as someone who is not in step with the Republican Party,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s saying that being an outsider is really just going back to American tradition. He uses Jackson as an avenue to do that. \u201d Ms. Richardson added Mr. Trump\u2019s embrace of Jackson, a man many liberals and progressives now hate, was doing something similar, with even more powerful effect. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of twisting the knife in people\u2019s guts,\u201d she said.'"}, "time": 1742563827.1740415}
