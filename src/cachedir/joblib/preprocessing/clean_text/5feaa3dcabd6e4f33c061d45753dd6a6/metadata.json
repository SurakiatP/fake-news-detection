But his maelstrom of activity  \u2014   the bold executive orders, the fiery Twitter posts, the brazen speeches  \u2014   has also exposed, and perhaps exacerbated, ideological differences. For those devouring news about the administration, the choice of narratives has become starker, with brighter lines drawn around the content. For the readers and viewers, it\u2019s follow the narrative of your choice, and be wary of the great chasm between. Over the weekend, as protesters descended on airports across the country in response to Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration ban, fissures began to emerge even among   news organizations. On Monday, the divide only widened. And not everyone behaved predictably. Bill O\u2019Reilly, the outspoken Fox News host, expressed skepticism about the rollout of Mr. Trump\u2019s plan and called it \u201ca mistake\u201d to rush it. While he did make some effort to defend Mr. Trump, he was also somewhat moderate in one segment. \u201cIt is certainly responsible and logical for a new president to institute updated protections for this country by ordering specific temporary immigration actions,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Reilly said. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s also responsible for a federal judge to order that foreigners with the proper credentials already issued not be punished. There should be room for    decision making. \u201d He even invoked the Statue of Liberty to make his point. Some of Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s guests were also critical. Karl Rove said of Mr. Trump that \u201cthe controversy is hurting him more than the controversy is helping him. \u201d Brit Hume said it was handled \u201cvery clumsily. \u201d And Charles Krauthammer said it was introduced in the \u201cmost amateurish, botched way. \u201d But, in more typical form, Mr. O\u2019Reilly also focused on what he said he perceived to be Mr. Trump\u2019s political calculation, adding that much of the country was \u201cgetting fed up with the   people. \u201d By late Monday, order on Fox News had been fully restored. In his opening monologue, Sean Hannity followed a familiar trope, criticizing the mainstream news media for \u201cfreaking out and completely misrepresenting\u201d the immigration ban. The Trump administration, he said, was trying to \u201cset the record straight, but the media won\u2019t listen. \u201d The Wall Street Journal, part of the Rupert   News Corporation, delivered a scathing editorial on Monday denouncing Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cblunderbuss\u201d policy. But on Tuesday, some journalists at the publication were frustrated after a note from the editor in chief, Gerard Baker, instructed editors to avoid the phrase \u201cseven majority Muslim countries\u201d when writing about the order. \u201cIt\u2019s very loaded,\u201d Mr. Baker wrote Monday night in the note, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times (and reported earlier by BuzzFeed). \u201cThe reason they\u2019ve been chosen is not because they\u2019re majority Muslim but because they\u2019re on the list of countries Obama identified as countries of concern. Would be less loaded to say \u2018seven countries the U. S. has designated as being states that pose significant or elevated risks of terrorism. \u2019\u201d The note caused concern among some editors and reporters in the newsroom as inappropriate interference. In a statement, a spokeswoman for The Journal said Mr. Baker\u2019s note was \u201cpart of a larger conversation discussing   developments as a story was being edited on deadline. \u201d In the same email chain, she said, Mr. Baker also pushed to include more comments from critics of Mr. Trump\u2019s policy. On Tuesday, Mr. Baker sent a memo to employees saying there was \u201cno ban on the phrase \u2018  country\u2019\u201d but that the publication should \u201calways be careful that this term is not offered as the only description of the countries covered under the ban. \u201d The unrest was only the latest manifestation of greater concern among a faction of reporters and editors at The Journal who are dissatisfied with what they view as sympathetic coverage of Mr. Trump. Mr. Baker has maintained that the publication is committed to fair reporting. Elsewhere in the news and entertainment empire of the Murdoch family, there was a more pointed response to Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policy. In a memo to employees of 21st Century Fox on Monday evening, James and Lachlan Murdoch suggested they did not fully support Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order. \u201c21CF is a global company, proudly headquartered in the U. S. founded by  \u2014   and comprising at all levels of the business  \u2014   immigrants,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe deeply value diversity and believe immigration is an essential part of America\u2019s strength. \u201d Among   organizations, the tone in the last few days has been predictably defiant and jubilant, reflecting their position on the conservative spectrum. Several seized on Mr. Trump\u2019s accusation that Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, had shed \u201cfake tears\u201d over the ban. The Federalist, a   web magazine, published an article under the headline, \u201cNo, Trump\u2019s Immigration Order Isn\u2019t Racist or Reminiscent of the Holocaust. \u201d After Mr. Trump fired Sally Q. Yates, the acting attorney general, on Monday night for refusing to carry out his immigration order, Breitbart News went with the spirited headline, \u201cYou\u2019re Fired: Trump Fires AG for \u2018Betrayal. \u2019\u201d The conservative Daily Caller called Ms. Yates\u2019s decision a \u201cbrazen act of defiance that cost her the post. \u201d On Tuesday afternoon, Breitbart readers may have been surprised to see the site covering protests  \u2014   but the blaring headline would have quickly showed the organization\u2019s focus. \u201cTrump Supporter Knocked Unconscious at Portland Airport Protest,\u201d the site wrote.'"}, "time": 1742563013.0634594}
