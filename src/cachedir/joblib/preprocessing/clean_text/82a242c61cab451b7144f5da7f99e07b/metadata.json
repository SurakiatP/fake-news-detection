It begins with, say, a white American man who becomes interested in taking an outspoken stand against racism or misogyny. Maybe he starts by attending a Black Lives Matter demonstration. Or by reading the novels of Elena Ferrante. At some point, he might be asked to \u201ccheck his privilege,\u201d to acknowledge the benefits that accrue to him as a white man. At first, it\u2019s humiliating  \u2014   there\u2019s no script for taking responsibility for advantages that he never asked for and that he can\u2019t actually revoke. But soon, his discomfort is followed by an urge to announce his newfound   awareness to the world. He might even want some public recognition, a social affirmation of the work he has done on himself. These days, it has become almost fashionable for people to telegraph just how aware they have become. And this uneasy performance has increasingly been advertised with one word: \u201cwoke. \u201d Think of \u201cwoke\u201d as the inverse of \u201cpolitically correct. \u201d If \u201cP. C. \u201d is a taunt from the right, a way of calling out hypersensitivity in political discourse, then \u201cwoke\u201d is a   from the left, a way of affirming the sensitive. It means wanting to be considered correct, and wanting everyone to know just how correct you are. In the \u201970s, Americans who styled themselves as \u201cradical chic\u201d communicated their social commitments by going to cocktail parties with Black Panthers. Now they photograph themselves reading the right books and tweet   tuned platitudes in an effort to cultivate an image of themselves as politically engaged. Matt McGorry, the actor who plays a sweetly doofy prison guard in \u201cOrange Is the New Black,\u201d is a helpful case study of this phenomenon. McGorry\u2019s Instagram presence was once blithely     \u2014   yacht shots, tank tops, a tribute to coconut water. Then he watched the actress Emma Watson brief the United Nations on the importance of men\u2019s involvement in the feminist movement, and he took it to heart. Now he presents his muscular selfies and butt jokes alongside iconography of feminism and   racism. In one snap, he holds a copy of \u201cThe New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness,\u201d in bed, shirtless. In December, BuzzFeed nodded at McGorry with a listicle titled: \u201cCan We Talk About How Woke Matt McGorry Was in 2015?\u201d Earning the \u201cwoke\u201d badge is a particularly tantalizing prospect because it implies that you\u2019re down with the historical fight against prejudice. It\u2019s a word that arose from a specific context of black struggle and has recently assumed a new sense of urgency among activists fighting against racial injustices in Ferguson, Sanford, Baltimore and Flint. When Black Lives Matter activists started a website to help recruit volunteers to the cause, they called it StayWoke. org. \u201cWoke\u201d denotes awareness, but it also connotes blackness. It suggests to white allies that if they walk the walk, they get to talk the talk. The most prominent pop touchstone for \u201cstay woke\u201d is Erykah Badu\u2019s 2008 track \u201cMaster Teacher,\u201d in which she sings the refrain \u201cI stay woke. \u201d \u201cErykah brought it alive in popular culture,\u201d says David Stovall, a professor of   American studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago. \u201cShe means not being placated, not being anesthetized. She brought out what her elders and my elders had been saying for hundreds of years. \u201d In turn, the track has helped shepherd the next generation into its own political consciousness. In an interview with NPR last year, the rapper Earl Sweatshirt described listening to \u201cMaster Teacher\u201d in the car with his mother as a teenager. \u201cI was singing the hook, like, \u2018I stay woke,\u2019\u2019u2009\u201d he said. His mother turned down the music, and \u201cshe was like, \u2018No you\u2019re not. \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d Earl Sweatshirt\u2019s mom was cautioning her son against brandishing a word without understanding its history and power. He got the message years later, he said, and called her up and announced: \u201cI\u2019m grown. \u201d Such reflectiveness is often absent from the promiscuous spread of \u201cwoke\u201d online. The word has now been recycled by people hoping to add splashes of drama to their own inconsequential obsessions, tweeting \u201cRaptors will win it all #STAYWOKE\u201d or \u201cnew bio . .. #staywoke. \u201d The new iteration of radical chic is the guy on Tinder who calls himself a \u201cfeminist artist in Brooklyn\u201d and then says he\u2019s \u201clooking for the    in the   \u201d  \u2014   the performance of \u201cwokeness\u201d is so conspicuous that it breeds distrust. In a 2012 paper about race relations on Twitter, Dr. Andr\u00e9 Brock, a University of Michigan communications professor, wrote about how the surfacing of popular hashtags and trending topics \u201cbrought the activities of   literate blacks to mainstream attention,\u201d creating a space where the expressions of black identity are subject to \u201cintense monitoring\u201d by white people  \u2014   a kind of accelerator for cultural appropriation. When black activists used \u201cstay woke\u201d in their Twitter campaigns against police violence, the term appeared alongside a host of trending hashtags  \u2014   #ICantBreathe, #IfTheyGunnedMeDown  \u2014   and was thus flagged for white people who have never listened to a Badu album or joined the crowd at a rally. Defanged of its political connotations, \u201cstay woke\u201d is the new \u201cplugged in. \u201d In January, MTV announced \u201cwoke\u201d as a trendy new slice of teen slang. As Brock said, \u201cThe original cultural meaning of \u2018stay woke\u2019 gets lost in the shuffle. \u201d And so those who try to signal their wokeness by saying \u201cwoke\u201d have revealed themselves to be very unwoke indeed. Now black cultural critics have retooled \u201cwoke\u201d yet again, adding a third layer that claps back at the appropriators. \u201cWoke\u201d now works as a dig against those who claim to be culturally aware and yet are, sadly, lacking in  . In a sharp essay for The Awl, Maya Binyam coined the term \u201cWoke Olympics,\u201d a \u201ckind of contest\u201d in which white players compete to \u201cname racism when it appears\u201d or condemn \u201cfellow white folk who are lagging behind. \u201d The latest revolution of \u201cwoke\u201d doesn\u2019t roll its eyes at white people who care about racial injustice, but it does narrow them at those who seem overeager to identify with the emblems and vernacular of the struggle. For black activists, there is a certain practicality in publicly naming white allies. Being woke, Stovall says, means being \u201caware of the real issues\u201d and willing to speak of them \u201cin ways that are uncomfortable for other white folks. \u201d But identifying allies poses risks, too. \u201cThere are times when people have been given the \u2018black pass,\u2019 and it hasn\u2019t worked out so well,\u201d Stovall says. \u201cLike Clinton in the \u201990s. \u201d A white person who gains a kind of license to use power on behalf of black people can easily wield that power on behalf of themselves. \u201cWoke\u201d feels a little bit like Macklemore rapping in one of his latest tracks about how his whiteness makes his rap music more acceptable to other white people. The conundrum is built in. When white people aspire to get points for consciousness, they walk right into the cross hairs between allyship and appropriation. These two concepts seem at odds with each other, but they\u2019re inextricable. Being an ally means speaking up on behalf of others  \u2014   but it often means amplifying the ally\u2019s own voice, or centering a white person in a movement created by black activists, or celebrating a man who supports women\u2019s rights when feminists themselves are attacked as  . Wokeness has currency, but it\u2019s all too easy to spend it.'"}, "time": 1742563200.006815}
