Be Sociable, Share! \\n\\nIn the aftermath of one of the most memorable October shocks in presidential campaign history, and down the final stretch in the presidential race which has just over one week left, Wikileaks continues its ongoing broadside attack against the Clinton campaign with the relentless Podesta dump, by unveiling another 2,620 emails in the latest, Part 24 of its Podesta release, bringing the total emails released so far to exactly 39,511. \\nThe release comes hours after Wikileaks warned that it was launching its \u201cPhase 3\u201d of election coverage this week.. \\nIn the latest, Sunday set, of emails Doug Band commented on Teneo\u2019s relationship with the Clinton Foundation, saying \u201cif this story gets out, we are screwed,\u201d we learned that Google\u2019s Eric Schmidt wanted to be \u201chead outside advisor\u201d to the Clinton campaign, and a potential conflict of interest with the Clinton Foundation assisting El Salvador in obtaining $50 million in cash.

I really took a shot in the dark here and didn\u2019t know how far we should go on these issues. I remain concerned that email will be forwarded to press and so am against sending an email altogether. If we want to include the broader list of individuals going to the PO (I left a marker in the text for that) then we obviously have to meet with people before any email or staff meeting.\u201d A May 2013 email from Neera Tanden address to John Podesta discussing a WaPo article how a Super PAC plans to coordinated directly with the Clinton campaign leads to the following exchange: That\u2019s fine But skirting if not violating law doesn\u2019t help her INMHO This article originally appeared on ZeroHedge.com .
