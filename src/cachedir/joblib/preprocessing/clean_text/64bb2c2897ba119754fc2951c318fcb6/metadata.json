A Concert for Reproductive Health, Freedom + Justice,\u201d will take place at the 9:30 Club in Washington, D. C. Organizers All Access promise special guests, elected officials and other activists will join in on the concert.  \u201cWe plan to send a clear message to the incoming administration that millions of people across this country are prepared to fight attacks on reproductive health care and abortion services,\u201d Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards said in a statement.  The concert is one of several protest events planned around Trump\u2019s inauguration. On January 21, thousands of demonstrators are expected to participate in the Women\u2019s March on Washington, including celebrities like Katy Perry and Cher. \u201cWomen should be able to make their own decisions regarding their bodies and health,\u201d the National\u2019s frontman Matt Berninger said in a statement. \u201cThis is a basic human right, and we\u2019re at the very beginning of a long and tough battle to defend these basic rights. A concert in D. C. inspiring people to take action, seems like a pretty good way to kick it off. \u201d This isn\u2019t the first   concert hosted by the All Access Coalition. In September, the group planned a concert featuring singer Sia and Ghostbusters actress Leslie Jones in Cleveland, Ohio.
