And say anything to cast a poor light on Trump and Trump supporters. \\nTheir foul play even extends to claims of physical violence towards women. \\nThe bad news for them (as it has been for Hillary) is that the truth always, eventually comes out. \\nAs reported by Breitbart : \\nA woman who accused a Donald Trump supporter of punching her outside a Trump rally in North Carolina is backtracking after James O\u2019Keefe and Project Veritas released video showing Democrat operatives claiming she was a trained activist. \\n69-year-old Shirley Teter of Asheville now says it is possible that 73-year-old Richard L. Campbell merely touched her accidentally, as his attorney had claimed all along. \\nOriginally, Harris told local ABC News affiliate WLOS, \u201cHe stopped in his tracks, and he turned around and just cold-cocked me.\u201d She also added a pointed, rhetorical question \u2014 namely, whether \u201cpeople find a Trump supporter punching her in the face deplorable.\u201d \\nNow, however, Teter is changing her story rather dramatically. She told WLOS on Wednesday that \u201cit\u2019s possible that he could have struck her with his backhand.\u201d \\nO\u2019Keefe\u2019s undercover video showed Democracy Partners consultant Scott Foval \u2014 who has since been fired \u2014 claiming that Teeter was a \u201ctrained\u201d political activist\u2026 \\n\u2026Facebook video of the altercation shows Campbell \u2014 who suffers poor vision as a result of cataracts \u2014 being led through a gauntlet of anti-Trump protesters by his wife. \\nIn the video, Teter then follows Campbell and appears to reach for his shoulder. His attorney told Breitbart News that he turned around after being touched, and Teeter then fell down. \\nYou want to know what is really deplorable, Teter? You serving as a lying minion for your lying queen. \\nAnd the victim? A poor, older man with cataracts who just wanted to peacefully attend a rally. \\nMaybe you weren\u2019t lying. Just confused? \\nI understand how getting \u201ccold cocked\u201d by an intimidating Trump supporter is essentially the same as picking a fight with a quasi- blind man and collapsing like you took a charge in the NBA. \\nBut how can we blame Teter? She teeters around the truth like the Hillz. \\nIf only we could catch all of Clinton\u2019s (and her supporters) lies on video. What a glorious day that would be.'"}, "time": 1742563826.9089398}
