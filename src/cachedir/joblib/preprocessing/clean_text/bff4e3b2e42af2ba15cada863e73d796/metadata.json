[With Planned Parenthood\u2019s annual reports usually published in late December or early January, the delay this year has stirred considerable speculation as to the reason.  The total number of patients seen by Planned Parenthood has dropped since last year. According to the   report, that number was given as 2. 5 million, while the latest report gives the number of patients seen as 2. 4 million. In   Planned Parenthood reports performing 328, 348 abortions  \u2014   an increase of 4, 349 abortions over the 323, 999 abortions the group states it performed in  . The organization also reported 2, 945, 059 contraception services in   and 2, 808, 815 of the same services in its latest report, a drop of 136, 244 within a year. Similarly, Planned Parenthood reports 9, 419 prenatal services in its latest report, a significant drop since a year ago, when the group claimed 17, 419 of the same services. In   the group also reported having performed 682, 208 cancer screening and prevention services. However, in   Planned Parenthood reports 665, 234 of the same services, a drop of 16, 974. With regard to its revenue, the new report shows Planned Parenthood\u2019s total revenue to be $1, 354. 3 million, an increase over the $1, 296. 1 million reported in  . The organization shows an increase in government reimbursement and grants this year, reporting $554. 6 million in taxpayer funding, while in   it reported $553. 7 million. Planned Parenthood reported an \u201cExcess in Revenue Over Expenses\u201d of $58. 8 million in  . That amount rose to $77. 5 million this past year. \u201cPlanned Parenthood\u2019s newly released   annual report reveals that abortion continues to be a big business for the nation\u2019s number one abortion chain, as taxpayer funding rises and other services continue their downward trend,\u201d said Americans United for Life\u2019s president and CEO Catherine Glenn Foster, adding: Despite reports that the number of abortions performed in the United States is declining, Planned Parenthood once again reports an increase in the number of human lives ended in their facilities: 328, 348 abortions last year. Additionally, despite their repeated claims that American women rely on them for   health care services, many of their   services have continued to decrease. The latest report is published only days after the release of a video produced by Center for Medical Progress that revealed members of the National Abortion Federation discussing the difficulties they face in their jobs, such as \u201cthe head that gets stuck that we can\u2019t get out,\u201d and \u201can eyeball just fell into my lap, and that is gross!\u201d YouTube, LiveLeak, and other sites removed the video after U. S. District Judge William Orrick censored it. Part of the newly released annual report is devoted to a narrative about what Planned Parenthood refers to as \u201cattacks\u201d by \u201c  extremists\u201d who \u201cbegan releasing heavily edited undercover videos of Planned Parenthood officials and providers. \u201d The report continues: In investigation after investigation by the media, the medical community, and forensic experts, their allegations were widely and resoundingly discredited. But as we know all too well,  \u2019s health politicians will jump at any opportunity  \u2014   no matter how baseless  \u2014   to attack our organization. However, it has been only Planned Parenthood\u2019s allies in the media and government who have \u201cwidely and resoundingly discredited\u201d the videos. A Democrat opposition research firm named Fusion  \u2014   hired by Planned Parenthood itself to review the videos  \u2014   said while their analysts observed the videos had been edited, \u201cthe analysis did not reveal widespread evidence of substantive video manipulation. \u201d Additionally, Fusion noted, \u201c[A]nalysts found no evidence that CMP inserted dialogue not spoken by Planned Parenthood staff. \u201d An analysis by Coalfire, a   forensics company hired by Alliance Defending Freedom, found that the videos were \u201cnot manipulated\u201d and that they are \u201cauthentic. \u201d \u201cPlanned Parenthood\u2019s new report reveals that abortions, taxpayer funding, and profit have all gone up,\u201d says Family Research Council\u2019s Arina Grossu, director of the Center for Human Dignity. \u201cMeanwhile its cancer screenings, basic breast exams, prenatal services, and even customers have decreased. \u201d \u201cThis sham organization\u2019s focus is increasingly on higher abortion numbers and higher profits,\u201d she added. \u201cWhy are we continuing to hand over half a billion dollars in taxpayer money to an organization that kills America\u2019s unborn children at record rates while lining their pockets with more than $77 million in profit?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742564058.6455371}
