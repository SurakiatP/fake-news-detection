It was a February evening in 2011, and he faced a   audience of   people, whom he was keen to impress. Dressed in a black suit and matching Converse   he instructed an attendee to \u201ctime me for a minute. \u201d As the countdown commenced, he began dealing the cards wordlessly, with such force and rapidity that they soon overspilled the table. He finished off one deck and started on another, then another. When time was up, DelGaudio announced, \u201c184 seconds in one minute  \u2014   thank you very much,\u201d then stood and walked away. Trick, as it were, over. The performance was titled \u201c184 Seconds,\u201d and with it, DelGaudio obscured a virtuosic feat within a pantomime of banality. A \u201csecond deal\u201d  \u2014   a    maneuver, often referred to simply as a \u201csecond\u201d in the world of card magic  \u2014   is when the magician appears to deal from the top of a deck but is in fact dealing the    card. Seconds usually aren\u2019t tricks in themselves but rather are building blocks for more elaborate deceptions. In \u201c184 Seconds,\u201d DelGaudio set himself a daunting challenge: How many seconds could he execute in a minute? The answer to this question became the performance\u2019s punning title. \u201c184 Seconds\u201d was anticlimactic by design, privileging invisible technique while eliminating any perceptible effect  \u2014   all hat, in other words, and no rabbit. In envisioning his work, DelGaudio, who has a fervent fan base among magic aficionados, likes to nod to   conventions (pick a card, any card) only to slyly deconstruct them, in a manner that either heightens or thwarts their payoffs. His animating goal is not for observers to ask, \u201cHow did he do that?\u201d but, \u201cWhy?\u201d For DelGaudio, \u201c184 Seconds\u201d enacted what he calls \u201cone of magic\u2019s defining paradoxes\u201d: that a magician\u2019s slavishly honed talents of subterfuge must by definition remain invisible to others and thus easy for the uninitiated to dismiss as trivial. \u201cThere\u2019s something beautiful about that,\u201d DelGaudio told me, \u201cand there\u2019s something heartbreaking. \u201d DelGaudio, who is 32, has lived in Los Angeles since his 20s. A few years ago, Disney charged him with brainstorming   attractions for its theme parks. He also worked as a consultant on Christopher Nolan\u2019s   film, \u201cThe Prestige,\u201d and, for one stage show, as an assistant to the masterful Ricky Jay, who turned his own prodigious gifts for banter and prestidigitation  \u2014   not to mention an encyclopedic knowledge of magic history  \u2014   into a run of hit shows and beloved books. Jay gave magic a newfound degree of artistic respectability, a feat that DelGaudio wants to achieve, too, in his own way. His admirers have come to include magicians\u2019 magicians, like Eric Mead and Michael Weber, a mentor and business partner of Jay\u2019s who told me, \u201cWhen it comes to a deck of playing cards, I\u2019d put Derek up against almost anyone. \u201d They also include   illusionists like Penn  Teller and David Blaine, who met DelGaudio a decade ago. \u201cI\u2019d heard about this young genius everyone was buzzing about, and we finally met, in a diner, I think,\u201d Blaine recalled. \u201cA lot of magicians show me things, but Derek has move after move that\u2019s just  . There are things he\u2019s shown me, things I can\u2019t tip to the public, that I use everyday. \u201d DelGaudio knows that when many of us think of magic, we summon cartoonish stereotypes: top hats and wands at children\u2019s birthday parties   at   casinos G. O. B. on \u201cArrested Development. \u201d DelGaudio told me, \u201cI daily suffer from the slings and arrows of being \u2018a magician. \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d His conviction  \u2014   one he articulates with winning passion and occasional   grandiosity  \u2014   is that magic offers a means of exploring ideas just as complex, and of provoking emotions just as powerful, as those encountered in any other art form. To this end, DelGaudio devises performances that combine    with more theoretical preoccupations drawn from performance art, conceptual art and what\u2019s known as relational aesthetics: a tributary of the first two in which spectators become indispensable, unpredictable participants in creating an artwork\u2019s meaning. \u201cThe reason Derek\u2019s so incredible is that he\u2019s not trying to fool an audience,\u201d Blaine says. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to capture an emotion that lies deep within them. \u201d In seeking to bridge the disciplines of magic and fine art, DelGaudio has performed at both the Magic Castle (the exclusive conjurers\u2019 club in Los Angeles) and the Kitchen (the   venue in Manhattan). He is as likely to refer in conversation to the legendary magician Dai Vernon as he is to cite Pierre Huyghe, explaining how that artist\u2019s   motivated him to devise a routine illustrating the distorting power of memory. \u201cI want to do for magic what Duchamp did for art  \u2014   break it,\u201d DelGaudio says. I met DelGaudio last spring at the Geffen Playhouse, on the west side of Los Angeles, where he was preparing to unveil \u201cIn  of Itself,\u201d his newest solo performance. It would be his most elaborate attempt yet to realize his vision of magic as art. (The show opens early next month in New York, at the Daryl Roth Theater.) In an alley, members of his crew were cutting blocks of wood for some opaque purpose others   bricks gold. All were politely cagey: Staff members were asked to sign nondisclosure agreements before joining the production. A final dress rehearsal was to start shortly. DelGaudio had put in long days at the theater for weeks, but uncertainties lingered. \u201cThere are effects that we weren\u2019t sure would work until just now,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there are effects that we won\u2019t know whether they work or not until they\u2019re in front of an audience. We\u2019re putting this into the world partially formed, discovering what it is by doing it, which is terrifying. \u201d (I will describe \u201cIn  of Itself\u201d in detail. DelGaudio, who believes that foreknowledge of an effect won\u2019t ruin seeing it live, is O. K. with me doing so. All the same, I include this parenthetical in case readers prefer to go in clean.) Standing nearby were DelGaudio\u2019s wife, Vanessa Lauren, who was one of the show\u2019s producers, and the director and veteran puppeteer Frank Oz, who has advised DelGaudio since he saw him perform in 2013 and who agreed to direct \u201cIn  of Itself. \u201d Oz\u2019s involvement necessitated special security arrangements, including nightly escape plans, thanks to a horde of autograph seekers who, I learned, follow Oz everywhere, carrying Sharpies and \u201cStar Wars\u201d posters. (In addition to his work with the Muppets and on \u201cSesame Street,\u201d Oz is the voice of Yoda.) Oz apologized to DelGaudio for the distraction. \u201cSo this is what it\u2019s like to be a big celebrity,\u201d DelGaudio replied, grinning. Also close at hand was Gil Cates Jr. the Geffen\u2019s executive director, who told me that the playhouse slotted \u201cIn  of Itself\u201d into its 2016 season before DelGaudio could really even describe it. Cates\u2019s faith rested largely on the runaway success of DelGaudio\u2019s last show, \u201cNothing to Hide. \u201d DelGaudio wrote it for two performers, enlisting Helder Guimar\u00e3es, a gifted Portuguese magician, to join him onstage and refine effects behind the scenes. That show generated   lines in an initial run at the Magic Castle and drew notable attendees: Ricky Jay and Penn  Teller, Rick Rubin, Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes. It moved to the Geffen in an expanded version in 2012 directed by Neil Patrick Harris, a lifelong magic enthusiast, and from there to the Pershing Square Signature Center, in Manhattan. In that show, DelGaudio\u2019s conceptualist leanings were on playful display. In one of the moments DelGaudio is happiest with, Guimar\u00e3es performed a trick focused on a folded card secured beneath an   glass. \u201cThis card has the potential to be a moment of astonishment, but if you saw it before I began, it would destroy that moment. . .. \u201d Guimar\u00e3es began, narrating  . A volunteer was chosen to shuffle a deck and pick a card, which was presently revealed, somehow, as the one under the glass. \u201cIt was a fine trick,\u201d DelGaudio told me, but it wasn\u2019t done. Next, DelGaudio stood and performed it a second time. \u201cThis card has the potential. . .. \u201d he intoned, repeating the same spiel verbatim, asking the same volunteer to shuffle and choose again. A different card was picked  \u2014   and discovered beneath the same glass. The trick mutated, through its repetition, into a meditation on the mechanics of surprise. \u201cEvery beat was exactly the same,\u201d DelGaudio recalled. \u201cAll the dialogue was the same. But the ultimate effect wasn\u2019t, because they\u2019d just heard it and seen it. \u201d After one performance, Teller, who came several times, told him, \u201cWe\u2019ve always wondered how to do a    effect, and you did it. \u201d (Penn  Teller have chased goals similar to those of DelGaudio, who saw them perform when he was young: They suffuse performances with metalevel prankishness and unexpected poetry, like Teller\u2019s breathtaking \u201cShadows\u201d effect, in which he cuts the petals from a spotlit rose by taking a knife to its projected silhouette.) Today DelGaudio looks back on \u201cNothing to Hide\u201d with qualified enthusiasm. \u201cIt was a   magic show for people who didn\u2019t know they could like magic,\u201d he told me, \u201cbut the next step, with \u2018In  of Itself,\u2019 is using magic to express real ideas. \u201d When a magician intends not simply to fool his audience but also to engage it intellectually and emotionally, he faces a steep challenge: How do you make a series of thought experiments and cliffhangers add up to a satisfying dramatic whole, much less a powerful work of art? This question hung in my mind as the dress rehearsal began. Before entering, those of us in the audience chose small white cards from a display of 690, each one printed with a unique descriptor: I AM AN ACTIVIST, I AM AN AFICIONADO, down the alphabet past PARALEGAL to ZOOKEEPER. Wall text instructed us to \u201cChoose how you would like to be seen,\u201d and it was up to us to do so  \u2014   cheekily or sincerely. \u201cThe show exists in the gap between you and your image of yourself,\u201d DelGaudio told me, and these cards were among the more baldly theatrical means by which that gap would be explored. We filed into the darkened theater, where   seats were arranged on risers. It was as large a room as DelGaudio is comfortable performing in, because otherwise it\u2019s difficult for everyone to enjoy clear views. On the stage there was a card table behind it were six large dioramas. One featured mail cubbies stuffed with envelopes. Another held a cracked pane of glass with one of the gold bricks lodged in its center: a window midshatter. The significance of these dioramas emerged and shifted during the show, sometimes through magical effects and sometimes simply though stories DelGaudio told, to the accompaniment of an original score by Mark Mothersbaugh. A recurring motif was the way we perceive and identify ourselves and how this does and doesn\u2019t line up with the way that others perceive and identify us. In the penultimate effect, DelGaudio asked those of us who picked I AM cards that we felt accurately described us to stand up. Then, with unwavering eye contact, he addressed us individually by our chosen descriptors, even though he had not once seen our cards. This moment tottered right on the edge of hokey, calling to mind hucksterish traditions of   mentalism. (Was there a hidden earpiece at play, through which an assistant who had somehow kept precise track of our card choices and seat numbers was stealthily tipping off DelGaudio?) And yet, there was also something genuinely unnerving about being identified in this way. A magic trick has much in common with a thriller. The chief ingredients are suspense and resolution, and we tend to regard both forms, exceptions notwithstanding, as unserious entertainments, no matter how well engineered they are. But whereas in the archetypal thriller, our world is upended at the outset and the laws of reality reassert themselves by the end, the archetypal magic trick inverts this structure: Everything appears to be normal until the decisive moment when, inexplicably, it isn\u2019t. Watching a trick to completion, we are not rescued from unreality but rather are marooned in it. DelGaudio takes this unsettled state as his opportunity to rattle people in profound, rather than merely fleeting, ways. DelGaudio also aimed, in the show, to bare himself to us. During an autobiographical passage, he recounted the night he discovered, at the age of 6, that his mother, who had been raising him on her own, was gay. DelGaudio came across her kissing a woman \u201cI cried myself to sleep that night,\u201d he says in the show, \u201cnot because she told me she was gay, but because that was the night I knew I\u2019d never have a father. \u201d The Colorado town they called home was conservative, and tensions grew around his mother\u2019s sexuality until someone hurled a brick into her parked car  \u2014   DelGaudio gestured, at this point in the dress rehearsal, to the   diorama. \u201cI learned the value of a secret,\u201d he said. \u201cHow to keep one, how to protect one, how to create one. I learned to craft language I could hide in. \u201d When the story was over, DelGaudio dislodged the brick from the window and dropped it with a thud. Shortly afterward, he obscured the brick within a painstakingly assembled house of cards, then made it disappear. The cards tumbled gorgeously into the void left behind. Weaving a classic vanishing act into this confessional vignette, DelGaudio scrambled magic and memoir and revealed something of the psychological forces that might drive a boy into a corner of show business defined by obfuscation and control. The monologue, he assured me later, was \u201cfor the first time in a magic show an honest origin story. \u201d He went on: \u201cYou don\u2019t become a magician because \u2018my grandfather bought me a magic kit.\u2019 It\u2019s because your parents fought and told you you were worthless. It\u2019s because you were in circumstances so bad you needed to escape. \u201d DelGaudio says that \u201cIn  of Itself\u201d sprang from an interest in symbolic, rather than illusionistic, transformations. \u201cI was thinking about how you can hold a pen and it means nothing to you,\u201d he told me, \u201cbut if someone tells you the pen once belonged to Hemingway, suddenly this mundane object has a deep meaning and emotional power that you can\u2019t really explain. The question was, How could I achieve that kind of transformation in a magic show?\u201d After the first preview, I followed DelGaudio to his dressing room. The floor was covered with   pads he was housebreaking his new puppy, Chaplin. Our conversation returned to the brick. After making it vanish, DelGaudio asked two audience members to choose the coordinates of a Los Angeles intersection, naming cross streets on the fly. He then declared that the brick was, at that very moment, sitting on that corner  \u2014   unremarkable to   if they even noticed it, and in this way transfigured back to a state of mute mundanity, like a Duchamp   in reverse. \u201cIf you go to that corner, right now, it\u2019s there,\u201d DelGaudio promised me. Pictures of gold bricks since posted to Twitter corroborate this. \u201cI don\u2019t know how they\u2019ll react when they see it. But I like the idea that the show doesn\u2019t stop when the lights go up. \u201d He plopped down on a cot, yanking off his shoes. \u201cThat might not be magic,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut it\u2019s something. \u201d DelGaudio owes his career to a tiny shop called Zeezo\u2019s, in Colorado Springs. When he was 12, he went in, intending to buy a practical joke. The clerks steered him instead toward \u201cThe Expert at the Card Table,\u201d a slender book from 1902 that cataloged techniques for the stealthy manipulation of playing cards. \u201cExpert\u201d was written by an enigmatic cardsharp named S. W. Erdnase. Even the basic facts of Erdnase\u2019s life are unknown, down to his real name: S. W. Erdnase was a pseudonym adopted, maybe, by an E. S. Andrews (read it backward) an E. W. Sanders (shuffle the letters) or someone else entirely. Whoever he was, Erdnase achieved lasting fame: More than 100 years later, no practitioner of    worth his aces is without a copy, and his identity is one of modern magic\u2019s foundational riddles. \u201cHe wrote the bible,\u201d DelGaudio said, \u201cand then he vanished. \u201d At first, DelGaudio didn\u2019t much care about magic. His favorite entertainers were physical dynamos of classic Hollywood, like Chaplin, Keaton and Gene Kelly. But \u201cExpert at the Card Table\u201d pulled back the curtain on a discipline defined by virtuoso physicality of a sneakier sort. DelGaudio suspects that the clerks sold him the Erdnase with low expectations: It\u2019s advanced reading for a kid. If so, \u201cthe joke was on them,\u201d he said, because \u201cthree or four months later, I could do everything in the book. \u201d By ninth grade, DelGaudio was capable not only of exquisite second deals but also of significantly more difficult \u201ccenter deals,\u201d in which the dealt card comes from the middle of a deck. (DelGaudio says the move was once seen as a \u201cunicorn. \u201d) He spent hours refining minuscule gestures: riffling a thumb up a deck until it caught the topmost card riffling again and catching two cards then three and so on. His fixation alienated him from his peers. Bullies took to \u201cthrowing pencils at me,\u201d he recalled, adding: \u201cIt was rare to find someone at school I connected with. I wanted to go hang out at a bar and see a guy deal off the bottom of the deck. I wanted to go to pool halls and watch people shuffle cards or hustle. \u201d Magicians periodically came to Colorado Springs, working a circuit of corporate gigs and club dates. As a teenager, DelGaudio sought out these men (they were invariably men, magic being as enduring a boys\u2019 club as they come) and took pilgrimages by Greyhound to meet others, in Aspen and Las Vegas. Several became his mentors and, as DelGaudio says, surrogates for his absent dad. One was David Williamson, a performer based in Ohio, who appeared yearly in Colorado Springs at the Broadmoor resort and whom DelGaudio met one afternoon at Zeezo\u2019s. \u201cI knew immediately that he was working on a high level,\u201d Williamson told me. \u201cYou can tell if a magician\u2019s any good in 15 seconds. \u201d His social circle came to consist of older magicians and, with them, card cheats, whose talents he was equally interested in absorbing and who \u201csaw me as a novelty,\u201d DelGaudio recalled. He came under the informal tutelage of crooked gamblers with sobriquets like Wolf and Rod the Hop. \u201cI had a guy show me his 17 stab wounds from games he\u2019d cheated in, to deter me,\u201d DelGaudio said. \u201cLike, \u2018This is the life you want? \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d At points, DelGaudio told me, he contemplated abandoning magic altogether and exploiting his facility with cards in other ways. \u201cI seriously considered becoming a gaming consultant for the casino industry, where they would basically hire me to prevent cheating,\u201d he said. \u201cI have friends who do that. \u201d He added that he occasionally put Erdnase\u2019s lessons to more ethically dubious use: Around 2010, before the success of \u201cNothing to Hide,\u201d he worked as a   \u201c  dealer\u201d at   private card games conducted in Beverly Hills residences. \u201cYou\u2019re hired to deal cards and make sure nobody wins but the house,\u201d DelGaudio explained, telling me that he was paid \u201ca percentage of the winnings\u201d for his services. (This milieu provided the backdrop for a pitch for a show that DelGaudio sold a few years ago to HBO.) DelGaudio found his cardsharp mentors inspiring, he told me, for the surprisingly high premium they put on craft. \u201cIn their world, money was the currency, but they still went above and beyond in developing their techniques. \u201d DelGaudio nodded respectfully. \u201cAt that point, it\u2019s pure artistry. \u201d After the first L. A. preview of \u201cIn  of Itself,\u201d DelGaudio, Frank Oz and Amy Levinson  \u2014   the Geffen\u2019s resident dramaturge, whose job is something like a sympathetic   critic  \u2014   gathered for a meeting. The big note for DelGaudio was that the show did not yet feel fully coherent. \u201cA bit more connection throughout feels necessary to me,\u201d Oz said. Levinson agreed: \u201cI think all the materials are in there, but you need to point more forcefully to them. \u201d DelGaudio frowned thoughtfully, sitting   on the floor. \u201cWe\u2019ll want to emphasize it where it\u2019s ambiguous,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I tend to err on the side of not being explicit. \u201d Levinson said, \u201cAs corny as it sounds, I think you might want a sort of catchphrase that recurs throughout the entire show. \u201d \u201cI need help with that, because my background is in \u201d DelGaudio told them. \u201cI work in moments. \u201d I later recounted this exchange to the artist Glenn Kaino, a producer on \u201cIn  of Itself\u201d and DelGaudio\u2019s frequent collaborator. They met nine years ago, when Kaino, whose solo work has been in Whitney and Performa biennials, grew interested in incorporating magic into his practice \u201cto interrogate systems of belief. \u201d The two men formed a   duo, naming it A. Bandit, and Kaino tutored DelGaudio in the history of conceptual art. Of \u201cIn  of Itself,\u201d Kaino told me that \u201cleft to his own devices, part of Derek would be perfectly happy to do a show that is an experimental performance, to not have it be legible. If we were making an art show, we wouldn\u2019t be worried about crafting some   thematic that takes people through the exhibition. But we feel, especially in a theater, that it\u2019s incumbent on us to make our work more accessible, and that\u2019s why Derek brought Frank on. \u201d DelGaudio\u2019s aversion to accessibility can be extreme. He told me that he sometimes bristles at the sound of applause. \u201cI kind of hate it, because it\u2019s like it settles the account,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2019u2009\u2018You did a thing, we clap, now let\u2019s move on to the next thing.\u2019 I\u2019d sort of rather people sat there in confused silence. But Frank will remind me, \u2018You\u2019ve got to entertain people! \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d \u201cIn  of Itself\u201d would go on to prove its appeal. Originally slated to close after six weeks, it ran for more than three months. But DelGaudio\u2019s insistence that his work unfold on his own exacting terms has, in other ways, restricted his career\u2019s growth. He has almost never performed on television, believing that magic is best experienced live. (The only exception to this, on a Spanish variety show, can be found on YouTube.) Similarly, he said, while his performances might travel, they are inherently \u201cnot scalable,\u201d because he believes their power is compromised in bigger venues. Instead, he has augmented his living over the years by consulting on movies and other magicians\u2019 acts and by performing at private functions. (One such gig was for the \u201cLost\u201d   Damon Lindelof, who hired DelGaudio to perform at the 40th birthday party of his wife, Heidi.) \u201cDuring \u2018Nothing to Hide,\u2019 we had offers to go perform on \u2018The Daily Show,\u2019 Fallon, Letterman,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut my interest is in protecting the work, and we\u2019re not famous enough to make demands. Like, we asked Letterman, \u2018Can we have a rehearsal with the cameras and get final cut?\u2019 They said no. In that case, we can\u2019t do it, because cameras flatten the work, and God forbid they see something you don\u2019t want them to see and then the piece is destroyed. So I decided I\u2019d just rather not be famous. \u201d One morning, DelGaudio invited me to join him at the studios he shares with Kaino on the main tourist drag of Hollywood Boulevard, where \u201cIn  of Itself\u201d was devised. A wheeled   board stood   to an aquarium full of coral. \u201cWe have three spaces in this building,\u201d DelGaudio said. \u201cThis one, for prep one for storage one for secret stuff. \u201d He and his collaborators on \u201cIn  of Itself\u201d  \u2014   among them Oz, Kaino and Michael Weber  \u2014   had used the board to diagram successive versions of the show. There were also sketches and printouts that served more abstract functions, like a drawing from 1822 that depicted a striking feature of the Royal Coburg Theater in London: a curtain covered top to bottom in mirrors, reflecting the audience back at itself. \u201cI\u2019d basically just sit here and stare at this board and think,\u201d DelGaudio said. Among the   images was a rendition of the   diorama. Within its shelves, envelopes were arranged to create, in aggregate, the silhouette of an elephant. During the show, as DelGaudio climbs a ladder to retrieve envelopes from the cubby, he recounts the fable of six blind men who encounter an elephant and, each bumping into a different part, mistake the animal for different things: The man at the tail is sure he has found a snake the man at the tusks believes he\u2019s holding spears. Through teamwork, they eventually discover the truth. \u201cBut what if they were wrong?\u201d DelGaudio asks onstage. \u201cWhat if that thing was some sort of magical creature that had a snake for a nose and   legs, and they convinced it it was an elephant? Maybe that\u2019s why you don\u2019t see those things anymore. \u201d When we make pronouncements about others and about ourselves, the subtext went, what do we get right and where do we err? This unlikely take on the elephant story segued into the show\u2019s most astounding moment: an emotionally blindsiding trick that, in its ideal form, will leave a single audience member shocked and quite possibly crying at every performance. DelGaudio was so proud of it that, two weeks before I saw it at the first preview (moving a woman to tear up, as he\u2019d intended) he described it to me: \u201cThere will be hundreds of letters in a mail cubby,\u201d he said. \u201cA person chosen at random will come up and randomly select a letter. I\u2019ll have them imagine a person they know. Now imagine that person wrote you a letter. Now imagine it\u2019s this letter you\u2019re holding right now. Imagine it\u2019s true. Now I have them open the letter, and they\u2019ll begin to weep, because it\u2019s a handwritten letter from that loved one to them. This will happen every night, and it\u2019s impossible. \u201d Most crowd participation at a magic show is fake, a pantomime of audience agency that leaves the magician in full control. The letter trick brought to bear genuine emotions. Sometimes this meant tears (\u201cIt\u2019s from my mother! \u201d) and sometimes it meant more inscrutable reactions: At one performance I witnessed, a woman responded to a letter from her husband with such a bizarrely blank affect that it undid the dramatic wallop. This was the price, DelGaudio told me, of creating an authentic moment onstage. After attending several shows, and after discussing the letter effect with DelGaudio and one of the letter getters, I tried to puzzle it out. My brain quickly overheated imagining the dizzying chain of obstacles and contingencies that DelGaudio and his collaborators must surmount for each performance: identifying attendees with sufficient time to obtain letters from families and friends procuring enough letters to guarantee that, when the attendee picks a letter, it will be addressed to them swearing the letter writers to secrecy making sure, at every show, that an attendee for whom enough such letters arrived would be picked, seemingly \u201cat random,\u201d by another member of the crowd and on and on. As DelGaudio put it, \u201cMy goal is to get you to the point where it\u2019s easier to believe that a miracle happened than the truth of what we actually did. \u201d But the painstaking labor and nested logistical nightmares were not where his interest lay, of course. The point of pride for DelGaudio was that the letter, and the feeling of uncanny   that it ideally inspired in its recipient, were entirely real. \u201cI wanted to make a magic effect that doesn\u2019t end on a falsity,\u201d he told me. \u201cI don\u2019t want to show people something amazing that doesn\u2019t exist. I want to show people something amazing that\u2019s true. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628479.2602375}
