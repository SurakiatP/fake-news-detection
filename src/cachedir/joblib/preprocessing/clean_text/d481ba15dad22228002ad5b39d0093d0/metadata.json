[Some 13   gang members, 10 being illegal immigrants, were indicted for murder charges against Nisa Mickens and Kayla Cuevas, as well as five other individuals who were allegedly murdered by the criminal organization, according to NBC New York.  According to federal prosecutors in the Eastern District of New York, Mickens\u2019 body was found brutally beaten in a   area of the   region of Brentwood. Just a day later, her lifelong best friend Cuevas was found beaten and killed in a wooded area in the same area. New York Attorney Robert Capers said the   gang members noticed the two teenage girls while they were looking for rival gang members to spar with. The gang members had previously known Cuevas from a past altercation and called their gang leader for approval to kill the girls. Capers told the media that the two girls were killed from   gang members \u201cswinging baseball bats and machetes\u201d at them, pointing out that both were running for their lives. Alexi Saenz, 22, Enrique Portillo, 19, and Selvin Chavez, 19, as well as two other   members are accused specifically with the girls\u2019 deaths. The bodies of Oscar Acosta, 19, Miguel   15, and Jose   18, were also found in the same period as the two teenage girls. All victims were students at Brentwood High School.
