A live feed from the crowded steps of the United States Capitol filled a projection screen on the back wall. \u201cThe election of Mr. Trump means \u2018You\u2019re fired!\u2019 to the political elites in America and the world,\u201d declared Boris Angelov, a tabloid editor and a founder of the society, which is strictly Bulgarian at the moment but has wider aspirations. Ilia Lingorski, a former deputy finance minister, shouted from the crowd, \u201cBulgaria desperately needs its own Trump movement. \u201d The inauguration of Donald J. Trump as America\u2019s 45th president, with declarations of \u201cAmerica first,\u201d was met with alarm in many corners of the world. But not everywhere. Pockets of celebration broke out here and there, in places where Mr. Trump\u2019s nationalist message matched local stirrings, and his promise of friendlier relations with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and a harsher approach to Islamic terrorism were eagerly embraced. About 100 Trump supporters gathered around a statue of President Ronald Reagan in Budapest\u2019s Freedom Square for a \u201cBetter World Order Inauguration Party. \u201d The speaker was Zsolt Bayer, a prominent   pundit who once referred to Jews as \u201cstinking excrement. \u201d Standing beneath a banner reading \u201cHungarian Deplorables for Trump,\u201d he called on President Trump to combat political correctness, which Mr. Bayer said had created a world in which \u201conly the white, Christian, heterosexual people do not matter. \u201d \u201cFor decades, we have been waiting for a miracle that will stop our world from running to its demise,\u201d Mr. Bayer said. \u201cNow, we are hopeful that this miracle is in the making. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s support in Hungary rises beyond the small group in Freedom Square. The country\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orban, eagerly congratulated the new president on his victory. In Moscow, a chain of stores selling Russian military gear offered a   10 percent discount on Friday to all United States citizens and embassy workers. A poster advertising the sale featured a   Mr. Trump, fist raised. Several celebratory parties were held in Moscow before and after Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration. At one, the crowd sang, \u201cTrump, Trump, he is a superhuman. \u201d Another featured a triptych of heroic portraits of Mr. Putin, Mr. Trump and the French nationalist leader Marine Le Pen. A group of Russian gunsmiths unveiled a commemorative coin declaring \u201cIn Trump We Trust,\u201d and Life News, a Russian tabloid, reported that Mr. Trump had been declared an honorary Cossack. Political activists, media figures and dozens of foreign journalists gathered on Friday evening at a conference site just outside the Kremlin for a celebration of Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, an event organized by conservative activists and a conservative television channel. Maria Katasonova, one of the organizers, declined to say who had paid for the spacious hall, meat pies and sparkling wine. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the Kremlin,\u201d she said. Although the event pushed a sense of triumphalism, the mood among the audience was more skeptical. Many said they worried that \u201c  elites\u201d in Washington would stymie Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts. \u201cThis is the last day we can celebrate,\u201d said Dmitri Gusev, a Russian political consultant. \u201cBecause tomorrow, real life will begin. \u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s ascent was also cheered by President Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines. His spokesman, Martin Andanar, said the two men had \u201chit it off\u201d in a brief conversation, leading to a likely \u201creboot\u201d in relations between the two nations. Ben Razon, an American of Filipino descent who runs a restaurant in Manila, said of Mr. Trump, \u201cI do hope that he establishes a good working relationship with President Duterte. \u201d \u201cThey understand each other,\u201d Mr. Razon added. \u201cThat should be good. \u201d In India, where the right wing shares a strong political affinity with the American right, Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration was celebrated by Hindu nationalists and business leaders eager for more trade between the two nations. Hindu Sena, a   fringe group, organized a celebration of Mr. Trump\u2019s victory on Nov. 4  \u2014   four days before he actually won  \u2014   and had earlier held a prayer ritual on his behalf. \u201cTrump\u2019s victory is confirmed early due to his thoughts against Islamic terrorism and love for India and Hindus,\u201d the group\u2019s leader, Vishnu Gupta, said, according to Reuters. In Egypt, support for Mr. Trump remained fervent among the country\u2019s   establishment. Hany Assal, a columnist for the     newspaper, sharply criticized American liberals and Democrats for opposing Mr. Trump. \u201cThey are putting obstacles in his way,\u201d he wrote, including \u201ctrying to start fights with Russia for no reason. \u201d On the street,     sentiment seemed to fuel a more subdued attitude toward the new president. \u201cSome people think he is going to be bad because he is openly   but the truth is, America has always been against Islam,\u201d said Bashir Kashta, a Palestinian businessman, as he sipped mint tea on Friday at the historic El Fishawy Cafe in Cairo\u2019s old Islamic district. Samy Abdel Mageed, 56, an engineer smoking a water pipe at an adjacent table, said he had \u201cnot met a single person who is excited about Trump or thinks he will change anything for better or worse. \u201d \u201cAmerica is a country of institutions, and institutions are hard to change,\u201d he said. At the bookstore party in Bulgaria, Borislav Tsekov, another founder of the European Trump Society, proudly surveyed the crowd of about 75 people who had trudged through   slush to attend the event at the Greenwich Book Center. He described the society as a scholarly organization dedicated to studying Mr. Trump\u2019s ideas. Mr. Tsekov, a former lawmaker who has been a member of several political parties, used the gathering to unveil his latest book, \u201cThe Trump Doctrine,\u201d a study of the new president\u2019s speeches and writings. Speaking before Mr. Trump was sworn in, Mr. Tsekov criticized the mainstream news media and the global political establishment, saying that they had unfairly portrayed Mr. Trump as a racist and xenophobe. \u201cWell, isn\u2019t he?\u201d cried a voice from the crowd that was then shouted down. Mr. Tsekov was not able to listen to Mr. Trump\u2019s speech on the big screen. He was too busy giving television interviews. But he said he looked forward to reading it and was certain he would approve. His   Mr. Angelov, was delighted with the turnout and looked forward to fresh branches sprouting across Europe. \u201cTrump is very popular in Bulgaria,\u201d Mr. Angelov said. \u201cHe is a brand, you know? He is an international brand. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562152.2946112}
