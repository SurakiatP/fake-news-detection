From some, it was a moment to switch to rival companies like Lyft, which recently pledged a million dollars to the American Civil Liberties Union. But what does switching from one Silicon Valley corporation to another really accomplish? Aren\u2019t they all basically the same? \u201cIf you\u2019re going to ban Uber, throw your iPhone in the trash, delete your Facebook account, stop using Twitter,\u201d Jenna says on this week\u2019s episode of Still Processing. \u201cAll of these companies are, in some way, supporting this administration. \u201d As Wesley puts it: \u201cIt\u2019s a protest   . \u201d Also, with the final season of \u201cGirls\u201d beginning on Sunday night on HBO, we take a moment to talk about the show\u2019s legacy. And after we talk about the show, we talk to it, with excerpts from Jenna\u2019s recent conversation with the cast: Lena Dunham, Allison Williams, Zosia Mamet and Jemima Kirke. They discuss the show\u2019s early lack of diversity, why \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d gets off easy and what it\u2019s like to have the public completely conflate actors and the characters they play. We\u2019ve got excerpts! Finally, we play a new   game that we hope to come back to. It requires zero expertise, just lots and lots of speculation.
