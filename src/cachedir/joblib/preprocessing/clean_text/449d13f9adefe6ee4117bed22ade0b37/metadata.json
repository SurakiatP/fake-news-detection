[On March 20, the radio talker will host an event at a secret location in L. A. to support his upcoming film, No Safe Spaces, a documentary about the current assault on the First Amendment happening on college campuses and at other institutions across the country.  For a $5, 000 contribution to the film, Prager fans can enjoy a complimentary cigar and refreshments with the man himself, a   photo at the event, a \u201cSpecial Thanks\u201d credit at the end of the film and two VIP passes to a screening once it\u2019s completed. The film just started shooting, and is expected to be completed early next year. \u201cI love cigars. I adore Adam Carolla. And I thrive on good intimate conversation with a small group of people. So this should be quite an evening,\u201d Prager told Breitbart News in an email. Interested fans can learn more about the project and donate here.
