When challenged about the clash between LGBT rights and religious freedom by Henk Jan van Schothorst of the Transatlantic Christian Council, Muntarbhorn said that religious freedom is not absolute and must yield to homosexual rights. \u201cThere are some absolute rights,\u201d he said in apparent reference to LGBT rights, \u201cbut there are some that are not absolute. \u201d He went on to explain that \u201cfreedom of expression and expression of religion\u201d are not absolute rights and that they can be curtailed when necessary. While praising a desire to engage with the \u201cheart of religion,\u201d Muntarbhorn said this should be done \u201cwithout the mythology overriding the heart of the religion. \u201d The independent expert also emphasized the role of education so children can be \u201cborn and bred from a young age\u201d with the right attitudes toward sexual orientation and identity, a practice that some have denounced as indoctrination or even \u201cgender ideology\u201d or \u201cideological colonization. \u201d Last summer, the UN Human Rights Council approved the appointment of an independent expert on the defense of the LGTB collective, and in October the Council chose Vitit Muntarbhorn of Thailand to fill the post. The following month, a coalition of 54 African states challenged the legality of the appointment, asking that his mandate be put on hold. They submitted a resolution calling for the suspension of the UN\u2019s LGBT investigator, noting that gender identity and sexual orientation have no place in international human rights instruments. While Muntarbhorn has been tasked with assessing implementations of existing international human rights law and raising awareness of violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) critics suggest that his very mandate will constitute interference with the laws of many UN countries.   countries worldwide, and almost 40 percent of all UN member states, currently have   laws on their books. In Africa alone, 33 states have laws making homosexual acts a crime, including Uganda, Nigeria, Sudan and Mauritania. Speaking on behalf of the African nations, Botswana\u2019s ambassador told a General Assembly human rights committee in November that African nations \u201care alarmed\u201d that the Human Rights Council is delving into national matters and attempting to focus on people \u201con the grounds of their sexual interests and behaviors. \u201d Ambassador Charles Ntwaagae said that the Council had no business looking into \u201csexual orientation and gender identity,\u201d which are notoriously absent from the United Nations charter document, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. \u201cThose two notions are not and should not be linked to existing international human rights instruments,\u201d said Ntwaagae. The UN has never adopted an official position regarding putative rights of gender identity or sexual orientation, though it does guarantee the rights of life, liberty, security, property and equal protection to all persons without distinction. \u201cWe therefore call for the suspension of the activities of the appointed independent expert pending the determination of this issue,\u201d said Ntwaagae. The Africa group claimed that a focus on homosexual rights also takes attention away from other issues of \u201cparamount importance,\u201d such as racism and the right to development.
