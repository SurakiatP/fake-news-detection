And it's the kind of story that flies under the radar and it's just a small component of the Democratic machine. But it is what the setup looks like . \\nJon Tester didn\u2019t come all the way from Montana for the scrambled eggs and bacon. The US senator, virtually unknown in Boston, was in a conference room at the Thornton Law Firm that June morning to cash in at one of the most reliable stops on the Democratic fund-raising circuit, a law firm that pours millions into the coffers of the party and its politicians. \\nTester, a massive, jovial man who raises livestock on his family farm, was more compelling than many of the other breakfast guests, all of them political candidates the firm hoped would defend the interests of trial attorneys. But the drill was basically the same. The personal injury lawyers listened politely for a few minutes, then returned to their offices. And Tester walked away with $26,400 in checks. \\nBut a striking thing happened the day Tester visited in 2010. Partner David C. Strouss received a payment from the firm labeled as a \u201cbonus\u201d that exactly equaled his $2,400 contribution to Tester\u2019s campaign, the maximum allowed. A few days later, partner Garrett Bradley \u2014 until recently the House assistant majority leader on Beacon Hill \u2014 got a bonus, too, exactly matching his $2,400 gift to Tester. \\nThat's quite a coincidence. \\nFrom 2010 through 2014, Strouss and Bradley, along with founding partner Michael Thornton and his wife, donated nearly $1.6 million to Democratic Party fund-raising committees and a parade of politicians \u2014 from Senate minority leader Harry Reid of Nevada to Hawaii gubernatorial candidate David Ige to Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Over the same span, the lawyers received $1.4 million listed as \u201cbonuses\u201d in Thornton Law Firm records; more than 280 of the contributions precisely matched bonuses that were paid within 10 days. \\nNo corruption to see here. Now let's move on to another fake scandal. \\nThornton\u2019s lawyers were especially generous to Vice President Joe Biden, one of Washington\u2019s strongest advocates for trial lawyers, contributing more than $78,000 to his campaigns from 2003 to 2008. \\nDuring President Obama and Biden\u2019s reelection campaign in 2012, Michael Thornton hosted a fund-raiser for the Obama Victory Fund at his house in Cambridge, where Biden was the guest of honor. Some of the biggest donors \u2014 some Thornton partners gave $20,000 \u2014 were escorted into a private room and offered the chance to be photographed with Biden, said someone who was there. Thornton records show the lawyers were reimbursed for those donations. \\nHope and change.\""}, "time": 1742628464.105079}
