It\u2019s the highest since early January and here is a chart giving the visual of the rapidity of the move\u2026 IMPORTANT\u2026 To find out which company is set to become one of the highest grade producing gold mines on the planet CLICK HERE OR BELOW: Sponsored \\nI look forward to seeing mortgage applications tomorrow to see the initial response. To quantify, at last Monday\u2019s 30 yr rate of 3.47%, a $300k mortgage would have a monthly payment of $1,342.12. At the 3.88% rate, the monthly payment would increase by about $70 to $1,411.57, a 5.2% increase. \\nThe cost of capital is of course going up across the board and while I\u2019m optimistic about growth initiatives to come, we\u2019ve got to get past the move higher in rates because business activity and asset price gains have been built on the foundation of low rates over the past 7 years (as in the prior expansion). The US and the world also have an extraordinary amount of debt that has accumulated which has created the dangerous tinder for this rise in interest rates. \\nKing World News note: Mortgage rates based on the 10-Year Treasury have been headed dramatically higher as bonds plunge (see crashing chart below). 10-Year Treasuries Continue To Plunge As Interest Rates Rise \\nKing World News note: To illustrate how dramatically this has impacted mortgage rates, Wells Fargo\u2019s posted rates for a 30-year conforming loan have risen in the past couple of weeks from 3.5% to 4.25%! That\u2019s 3/4 of a point higher in just a couple of weeks. This will not bode well for the real estate market if the trend in higher interest rates continues. \\n***   Hi-Yo Silver!
