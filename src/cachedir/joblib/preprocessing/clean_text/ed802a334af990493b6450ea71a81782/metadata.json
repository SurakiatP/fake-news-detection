But we\u2019re always beaten to it\u2026 so we\u2019ve decided to try something new\u201d. \\nGernon and Wilson, both 27, are speaking exclusively to WWN about their difficulties in securing a one bedroom flat in Dublin city centre, and have decided to offer potential landlords a daily sex video broadcast live over a webcam in a bid to give them the \u2018edge\u2019 over other renters. \\n\u201cThe minute a flat goes up on Daft, we mail the landlord and put on a bit of a show for them, letting them know there\u2019s more where that came from,\u201d said Wilson, undressing quickly in a bid to secure a bedsit above a butcher\u2019s shop which just got listed at \u20ac1,800 a month. \\n\u201cIf you think you\u2019re going to just show up and get the place, forget it. It\u2019s like trying to get bread in Russia in the 80s. We don\u2019t even bother going to viewings now, we just send over a sexy clip and take it from there\u201d. \\nWhile landlords are open to webcam shows as part of their letting packages, people looking to buy a house rather than rent in Dublin must agree to sign up for a 24-hour Truman Show style existence with cameras in every room of the house.'"}, "time": 1742562133.0737758}
