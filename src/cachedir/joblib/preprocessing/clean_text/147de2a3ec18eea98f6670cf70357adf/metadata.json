While Hillary\u2019s previous scandals have had little effect to deter her presidential bid,\u00c2 that doesn\u2019t appear to be the case this time. In a\u00c2 stunning turn of events, new\u00c2 evidence is revealing that Democrats are now turning on Hillary by the droves. \\nImmediately after the news hit of the FBI\u2019s new investigation, Hillary held a press conference where she urged Americans to \u201cget out and vote early,\u201d apparently realizing her supporters would change their minds once whatever\u2019s in those emails leaks to the public. But unfortunately for Hillary, her evil scheming is not going to get her off so easy this time around. These same \u201cearly voters\u201d she was targeting in her speech have now begun to jump ship, as a devastating new poll reveals. \\nVoting is indeed underway. But in several states, not only has the FBI announcement changed their mind or persuaded them not to vote for Clinton, there are many going to the polls to change their votes,\u00c2 The Independent Journal revealed.\u00c2 \\nStates allowing voters to change their early votes include many key battleground\u00c2 states such as Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. Reports are revealing that many early\u00c2 voters are flocking to the polling offices to switch their votes, proving that the fallout from the reopened investigation is devastating Hillary\u2019s presidential bid. Here's a list of States that will allow early voters to change their early vote following the reopening of the FBI probe. #HillarysEmails pic.twitter.com/ggPZDmgBNw \\n\u2014 Jared Wyand \u0111\\x9f\\x87\u015f\u0111\\x9f\\x87\u00b8 (@JaredWyand) October 29, 2016 \\nEven liberal-biased polls are revealing\u00c2 a shattering\u00c2 impact on Hillary\u2019s previous lead. The same\u00c2 ABC/WaPo poll that had Hillary Clinton up four points \u00c2 over Trump early last week now shows them in almost a dead heat.\u00c2 As of Saturday, only two points separate the candidates now. \\nSo just how many voters are switching their ballots to Trump? According to one poll conducted by\u00c2 NJ.com, 24% of the\u00c2 18,029 people polled\u00c2 said they would be ditching Hillary in the light of recent events.\u00c2 While some might argue that the online poll is unscientific, even if half that percentage switches sides, it would guarantee a landslide win for Trump. \\nFor months, we\u2019ve been patiently waiting\u00c2 for WikiLeaks to drop a bombshell that would end Hillary. How ironic would it be that in the end, a slime-ball from\u00c2 Hilary\u2019s own party in the form of Anthony Weiner would be the one to destroy her\u00c2 chance of becoming president? It\u2019s poetic justice if you ask me.\""}, "time": 1742562730.2738614}
