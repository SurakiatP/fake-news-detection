Trump\u2019s nominee to replace Justice Antonin G. Scalia on the Supreme Court, who died Feb. 13, creating the current vacancy. [\u201cIt is obviously a great pick by the president,\u201d said Sen. Benjamin E. \u201cBen\u201d Sasse (R. .) who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee and was one of the guests invited to the White House for the announcement.  \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be really hard for people, who are serious about the Constitution to oppose this guy,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you read Judge Gorsuch\u2019s opinions, what you are going to find his policy preferences,\u201d he said. Gorsuch believes in the courts protecting rights and not in courts trying to remake society, said the senator. \u201cHe says the constitutional system allows the Congress to write the laws, not the courts and the judges, who think about they are  . \u201d In a statement released by his office, the senator said that when Gorsuch was confirmed to his current bench at the Tenth Circuit of the U. S. Court of Appeals in Colorado, the vote was unanimous from Republicans and Democrats, including Minority Leader Charles E. \u201cChuck\u201d SChumer (D. . Y.). \u201cSenator Schumer is about to tell Americans that Judge Gorsuch kicks puppies and heckles piano recitals,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s hogwash. Democrats are working overtime to cast Judge Gorsuch as a reflexive partisan but, as I said when Justice Scalia died, there are no Republican or Democratic seats on the Supreme Court. \u201d Sasse said the confirmation of Gorsuch is a teachable moment. \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be a partisan debate but an opportunity to teach our kids civics,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the coming weeks, everyone who loves the Constitution should celebrate the uniquely American idea that government power must be limited and that those in power must be checked and balanced. \u201d Sasse told Breitbart News that he, along with other members of the Judiciary Committee, participated in the selection process with Trump\u2019s staff. \u201cThey had been reaching out to us in the course of the past two weeks \u2014  honoring the \u2018advice and consent\u2019 clause of the Constitution. \u201d The Nebraskan said the Trump team did a good job seeking out suggestions from others as well as they put together the nomination for the president. Sasse\u2019s praise for the president\u2019s pick for the Supreme Court and for Trump\u2019s process stands in sharp contrast to the senator\u2019s posture during the 2016 campaign cycle. Then, the senator was one of the Republican Party\u2019s most adamant critics of Trump and the poster boy for the #NeverTrump movement. In a May 4 open letter Sasse posted on Facebook, he said he was voting for neither Trump nor his Democratic rival Hillary R. Clinton: \u201cIf you are one of those rare souls who genuinely believe Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are honorable people  \u2014   if they are the role models you want for your kids  \u2014   then this letter is not for you. Instead, this letter is for the majority of Americans who wonder why the nation that put a man on the moon can\u2019t find a healthy leader who can take us forward together. \u201d Although the senator resisted calls for him to run as an independent, he was critical of his party\u2019s nominee for president throughout the campaign, so much so that Clinton used tape of Sasse talking about Trump in one of her attack ads against the New York City developer. \u201cI have never met him before, but the president went through a very transparent process,\u201d Sasse said. \u201cAll through the campaign, he had 21 names that he talked about and he said he would try his best to pick the best jurist,\u201d he said. \u201cOur Founders envisioned people serving on the Supreme Court with a lifetime appointment, not a term. The American people want to hire and fire the people, who write policies, when you read the judge\u2019s opinion \u2014  he is the kind of judge the Founders envisioned,\u201d he said. \u201c\u201dHe is a super guy and this is a tremendous pick by the president. \u201d Gorsuch did not waste any time visiting Capitol Hill for courtesy calls with senators Wednesday morning. No confirmation hearings are yet scheduled.'"}, "time": 1742628537.2971513}
