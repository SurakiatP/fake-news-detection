Partisan divisions are 36-27-31 percent, Democrats-Republicans-independents,\u201d ABC said near the bottom of the poll. \\nOf course Hillary will be ahead in polls dominated by Democrats, but ABC and other mainstream media outlets are betting that voters won\u2019t bother to look at a poll\u2019s methodology to find the bias. \\nEven if there\u2019s more registered Democrats than Republicans nationally, they don\u2019t outnumber them by nearly 10% because otherwise Republicans wouldn\u2019t be winning national races. \\n\u201cThese kind of misleading polls really strike at their credibility as pollsters,\u201d wrote media analyst Aaron Rossiter. \u201cThey seem to want the big Hillary lead, probably to throw off the poll averages and suppress Republican voter turnout.\u201d \\nAnd if the fact that mainstream polls are \u201cadjusted\u201d to manufacture a Hillary lead still sounds doubtful to you, just read this leaked email from Democratic consultant Tom Matzzie: \\n\u201cI also want to get your Atlas folks to recommend oversamples for our polling before we start in February. By market, regions, etc. I want to get this all compiled into one set of recommendations so we can maximize what we get out of our media polling.\u201d \\nThe email also includes this report from The Atlas Project on how to rig polls to get the desired result: \\nFor example, in Florida, a key battleground state, Democratic consultants recommended oversampling African-American and Hispanic voters who lean Democratic so the polls favor Democrat candidates: \\n\u2013 General election benchmark, 800 sample, with potential over samples in key districts/regions \\n\u2013 Benchmark polling in targeted races, with ethnic over samples as needed \\n\u2013 Targeting tracking polls in key races, with ethnic over samples as needed'"}, "time": 1742562016.871073}
