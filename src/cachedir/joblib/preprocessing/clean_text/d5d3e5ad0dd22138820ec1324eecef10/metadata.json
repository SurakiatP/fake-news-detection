After the season, the quarterback declared his free agency but with the announcement also announced an abrupt end to his refusal to stand for the anthem. But, with the league\u2019s free agents signing to teams at a quickening pace, Kaepernick has thus far gone unsigned.  Only last week, Bleacher Report\u2019s Mike Freeman took a look at Kaepernick\u2019s inability to find a new team and noted that many executives don\u2019t want his type of disruption in their locker rooms. Over the weekend, a Fox News article revealed that \u201c70 percent of NFL managers genuinely hate\u201d Colin Kaepernick. Many reasons have been listed. Some analysts criticize Kaepernick\u2019s throwing accuracy, others think he isn\u2019t much of a team player because he is a moody loner, and still others say he seems out of his depth when asked to learn new plays and plans. Rumors circled early in the season that Kaepernick only began his protests to raise his profile as a race activist to head off being traded by the 49ers. This rumor charged that Kaepernick meant use his activism as a weapon against the team, so that in case they tried to trade him he could claim racism. And in that vein, it appears that some in the media fell right into line with that tactic. TV One host and former CNN personality Roland Martin is a case in point. Martin made just that very charge in a March 17 tweet. If not a single @NFL team signs @Kaepernick7, it shows their hatred of a Black man taking a social stand. These execs are pathetic.  \u2014   rolandsmartin (@rolandsmartin) March 17, 2017,  By not signing @Kaepernick7, these @NFL teams are sending a signal to their players: Don\u2019t you dare use your voice.
