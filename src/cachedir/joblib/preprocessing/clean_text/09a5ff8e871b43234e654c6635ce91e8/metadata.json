To his left sat Carine Roitfeld, a former Tom Ford collaborator and former editor of French Vogue, and the creator of CR Fashion Book. To his right was his girlfriend, the Romanian model Andreea Sasu, whom he calls \u201cPoof. \u201d Members of his inner circle, like the photographer Dylan Don, the publicist Karla Otto, and Mr. Plein\u2019s sister Gloria Dieth, rotated through the chairs behind them over the course of several hours, chatting quietly or observing. Everyone\u2019s attention was on the fit models who stood patiently as Mr. Plein and Ms. Roitfeld debated how to style each of the show\u2019s 80 or so looks. Ms. Roitfeld\u2019s two assistants, the label\u2019s heads of design for men and women, and various others also offered opinions. The stakes, after all, were high. Mr. Plein would have to top the increasingly ostentatious shows he has thrown in Milan since 2011 (with Jet Skis, swimming pools, roller coasters and performers like Snoop Dogg and Rita Ora). The decision to swap cities was part of the brand\u2019s expansion into the United States, a new frontier for the label, which counts Asia and Eastern Europe as its top markets. As part of the push, last year Mr. Plein hired Graziano de Boni, who had previously held   positions at Giorgio Armani and Prada USA, to be his chief executive of North and South America. \u201cI tried to avoid it for a very long time because the American market is very developed and the consumer is very spoiled,\u201d Mr. Plein said. \u201cMarkets like Russia and China are much more open to new brands and much easier to enter. They\u2019re hungry to consume. \u201d But after 18 years in the business and 120 store openings, Mr. Plein decided it was time. \u201dWe didn\u2019t want to lose money,\u201d Mr. Plein said. His company has no investors and he owns it  . \u201cWe had to wait until we were a little bit more mature, and I had some gray hair, as you can see, to come here and start this experience. \u201d Experience is one way to put it. Mr. de Boni began looking for a show venue in August and considered both the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center and the Statue of Liberty, but the New York Public Library won out. Next, Mr. Plein recruited Ms. Roitfeld to help him style the show. Their partnership was in some ways an unlikely one: Ms. Roitfeld is the consummate fashion insider, and Mr. Plein considers himself an outsider, in part thanks to the refusal of Milan\u2019s Camera Nazionale della Moda to include him on its official fashion week calendar until 2013. Still, they agreed on the show. Mostly. Ms. Roitfeld was not persuaded about a top, arguing that it looked too much like a dress. \u201cThe long sweater is more European,\u201d Mr. Plein countered. \u201cO. K. put it long,\u201d Ms. Roitfeld said. \u201cCan you walk? Maybe it is good. \u201d The model strode across the room. \u201cThat\u2019s lit,\u201d Mr. Plein said. \u201cI learned one word today,\u201d Ms. Roitfeld said, referring to Mr. Plein\u2019s frequent use of \u201clit,\u201d the slang term for something amazing. \u201cThat\u2019s a rapper look,\u201d Mr. Plein said. \u201cLike for Desiigner or something. Have you ever styled Desiigner?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Ms. Roitfeld answered, seemingly confused by the reference. \u201c\u2018Panda, Panda, Panda,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Plein said, chanting the lyrics of the rapper\u2019s hit song. \u201cHe\u2019s going to walk the show. It was the song of summer. I wore a panda mask in the club, in Jimmy\u2019z in Monte Carlo. \u201d Mr. Plein began scrolling through his Instagram account in search of an image to illustrate what he meant. As she waited, Ms. Roitfeld considered the concept, then said: \u201cNext time I go with you and I wear a mask, too. I love a masked ball. \u201d Before Mr. Plein was able to find the photo  \u2014   he sometimes posts as many as 20 Instagram photos in one day, so there were hundreds to get through  \u2014   the two forgot the topic and returned to the outfit. \u201cI like the long sweater because it\u2019s more new,\u201d Mr. Plein said. \u201cIt\u2019s fresh. \u201d Ms. Roitfeld nodded in agreement, and the model headed off to have the look photographed. Ms. Roitfeld and Mr. Plein continued forth, often requesting that the seamstresses, most of them     women working diligently in a quiet room a few feet away (lryna Velychko, the head seamstress, is from Ukraine and speaks only Italian and Russian) alter one detail or another. Around midday, the rapper Willie Maxwell II, known as Fetty Wap, swept in with his entourage. Fetty Wap will be walking in Monday\u2019s show along with the rappers Young Thug and Desiigner the singer Pete Wentz of Fall Out Boy and Jeremy Meeks, the model who was referred to as \u201cthe hot felon\u201d after his mug shot, taken after he was arrested on federal weapons charges, went viral in 2014. Their casting is the third crucial component of Mr. Plein\u2019s big New York show, and is in large part the work of Eli Mizrahi, a    man about town who counts the models Sofia Richie and Irina Shayk among his friends. \u201cWe want you to look like a king,\u201d Mr. Plein told Fetty Wap. He pulled out a long    fur coat covered with the Philipp Plein logo and skulls. \u201cI call it the   coat. \u201d As his hit song \u201cTrap Queen\u201d played in the background, Fetty Wap tried on the outfit, took a quick walk to show it off and posed for photos. Before leaving, he made a promise: \u201cI\u2019ll bring my bling bling. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564444.223379}
