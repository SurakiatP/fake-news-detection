C.  \u2014   A federal judge on Monday upheld sweeping   changes to election rules, including a voter identification provision, that civil rights groups say unfairly targeted   and other minorities. The ruling could have serious political repercussions in a state that is closely contested in presidential elections. The opinion, by Judge Thomas D. Schroeder of Federal District Court in   upheld the repeal of a provision that allowed people to register and vote on the same day. It also upheld a   reduction in the   period the end of preregistration, which allowed some people to sign up before their 18th birthdays and the repeal of a provision that allowed for the counting of ballots cast outside voters\u2019 home precinct. It also left intact North Carolina\u2019s voter identification requirement, which legislators softened last year to permit residents to cast ballots, even if they lack the required documentation, if they submit affidavits. The ruling could have significant repercussions in North Carolina, a state that Barack Obama barely won in 2008, and that the Republican Mitt Romney barely won four years later. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which sits in Richmond, Va. will be the first to consider an appeal, which the law\u2019s opponents said they would pursue. If the Fourth Circuit or the Supreme Court does not intervene, the changes will be in force when voters go to the polls this autumn. North Carolina voters will also elect a governor in what is expected to be one of this year\u2019s most competitive state races. The ruling is an early signal of how federal judges might regard changes and challenges to voting laws in the aftermath of a 2013 Supreme Court decision that effectively eliminated a portion of the Voting Rights Act that had forced nine states, mostly in the South, to obtain advance federal approval before changing their election laws. \u201cNorth Carolina has provided legitimate state interests for its voter ID requirement and electoral system,\u201d Judge Schroeder said near the end of his   opinion. The judge, an appointee of President George W. Bush, found that North Carolina\u2019s system was not beyond \u201cthe mainstream of other states. \u201d Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican, who signed the bill scaling back the voter access provisions in August 2013, welcomed the decision. He said in a statement that \u201cthis ruling further affirms that requiring a photo ID in order to vote is not only common sense, it\u2019s constitutional. \u201d But critics vowed to appeal the ruling, and charged, as they often have, that the legislature sought to eliminate tools that made it easier for everyone, but particularly minority voters, to get to the polls. \u201cBy meticulously targeting measures that were most used by people of color  \u2014   in addition to imposing a restrictive photo ID requirement  \u2014   the legislature sought to disturb the levers of power in North Carolina, ensuring only a select few could participate in the democratic process,\u201d Penda D. Hair,   of the Advancement Project and a critic of the law, said in a statement. \u201cThis fight is not over. \u201d In his ruling, the judge suggested that past discrimination had abated. \u201cThere is significant, shameful past discrimination,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn North Carolina\u2019s recent history, however, certainly for the last quarter century, there is little official discrimination to consider. \u201d The law, which originally included a much stricter voter ID provision, was passed by the   legislature in summer 2013, shortly after the Supreme Court\u2019s    ruling in Shelby County v. Holder. The ruling effectively eliminated what was known as the \u201cpreclearance\u201d process, in which certain states and local governments had to submit proposed voting changes to the Justice Department or to a federal court in Washington. Judge Schroeder\u2019s decision capped a trial court record that stretched more than 23, 000 pages and included weeks of testimony about the General Assembly\u2019s revisions to the election laws here. The voter identification standard, which required voters to display one of six forms of documentation, was central to an overhaul that supporters described as a bulwark against fraud. But opponents of the changes said they were intended to disenfranchise black and Hispanic voters, an assertion they repeated on Monday. \u201cThrough widespread actions, rallies, marches and protests, we have said all along that we would accept no less than unabridged access to the ballot for all eligible voters,\u201d said the Rev. William J. Barber II, the president of the North Carolina N. A. A. C. P. \u201cJust like those who carried on before us, we will continue our movement challenging regressive and discriminatory voter suppression tactics on behalf of   Latinos, seniors, students and all those for whom democracy has been denied. \u201d Such comments surfaced occasionally on Monday here in the state capital, where Mr. Barber led demonstrations against the state\u2019s new law about gay and transgender rights and, occasionally, veered into other issues that have propelled his Moral Monday movement of activism. The N. A. A. C. P. the League of Women Voters and the Justice Department were among the plaintiffs challenging the 2013 law. A lawyer for the plaintiffs, Daniel T. Donovan, said he expected a higher court to block the changes from being enforced this year. \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed in the ruling, reviewing the decision carefully and evaluating our options,\u201d said Dena Iverson, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department. The plaintiffs may have reason to be optimistic about their chances at the Fourth Circuit. In fall 2014, a   panel of the appellate court issued a preliminary injunction forcing the state to temporarily restore two ballot access provisions: one that allows   registration and another that allows for the counting of provisional ballots filed outside voters\u2019 home precincts. The panel ruled that the elimination of those two provisions probably violated another section of the Voting Rights Act that remains intact, known as Section 2, which prohibits racially discriminatory voting rules. Judge James A. Wynn Jr. wrote at the time that there was \u201cundisputed evidence\u201d that those two provisions \u201cwere enacted to increase voter participation, that   voters disproportionately used those electoral mechanisms and that House Bill 589 restricted those mechanisms and thus disproportionately impacts   voters. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564316.6849062}
