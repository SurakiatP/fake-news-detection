Paul Ryan ( ) said of the Obama administration\u2019s nuclear agreement with Iran, \u201ca lot of that toothpaste is already out of the tube,\u201d so now \u201cthe key\u201d was to \u201crigorously enforce\u201d the deal.  Partial transcript as follows: TODD: Would you like to see the beginnings of trying to get out of the nuclear deal ? RYAN: A lot of that toothpaste is already out of the tube. I never supported the deal in the first place. I thought it was a huge mistake. But the multilateral sanctions are done. So \u2014   TODD: Done meaning you\u2019re not going to be able to put that back together \u2014   SPEAKER PAUL RYAN: Yeah, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to go back and reconstitute the multilateral sanctions that were in place. TODD: Should we try, though? RYAN: So, I don\u2019t think we \u2014   I think we should expend our effort where it can pay off the most. And that\u2019s why I think what they\u2019re doing now does make a lot of sense. So I think the key is to rigorously enforce this deal. But also, remember, they\u2019re testing ballistic missiles. They\u2019re still the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world. Human rights abuses galore. And so those are where I think we also need to ratchet up sanctions. I think what this administration is doing, which I agree with, is saying, \u201cWe have a new administration, and we\u2019re going to hold you, Iran, to account. \u201d This last administration did not do that. This new administration needs to do that. And I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting here. TODD: Where is the line here? Are you concerned that Iran might retaliate, and suddenly we\u2019re a part of the proxy war in Yemen? I mean \u2014   RYAN:But look what they were doing, we\u2019re appeasing them already. So it couldn\u2019t get worse \u2014   TODD: You thought too much appeasement \u2014   RYAN: Yeah, it couldn\u2019t get any worse than what we already had. So I think they need to know that they\u2019re going to be held to account. Because if left \u2014   If we don\u2019t do that, then they\u2019re going to go off and do all these other things. Remember, they are a belligerent force in the Middle East. Look at what they\u2019re trying to do to destabilize the region with all their proxies. Look at what they\u2019re doing to finance terrorism, their human rights abuses, testing ballistic missiles. You see they write on the side of their ballistic missiles in Hebrew, Farsi and English, \u201cDeath to Israel and death to America. \u201d This is not a peaceful nation.
