The Times obtained documents that show that Donald J. Trump avoided reporting hundreds of millions of dollars in taxable income in the early 1990s by using a maneuver that his lawyers warned would most likely be deemed improper by an I. R. S. audit. \u201cWhatever loophole existed was not \u2018exploited\u2019 here, but stretched beyond any recognition,\u201d said one of the tax experts who reviewed the documents. Here\u2019s how Mr. Trump structured his companies to gain personal tax advantages. \u2022 Clinton and emails. The F. B. I. is using a special computer program to see if recently discovered emails belonging to a top aide to Hillary Clinton contained classified information. The software should show whether the messages were already examined during the inquiry into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s private server, officials said. James B. Comey\u2019s decision to start the new review so close to Election Day has led some historians to draw parallels between the F. B. I. director and an infamous predecessor: J. Edgar Hoover, who ordered the bureau to wiretap the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. \u2022 Interview with Bashar  . The Syrian president rejected any personal responsibility for the war raging in his country, and placed all the blame on the U. S. and on Islamic militants, during a recent interview with our reporter. Mr. Assad also said he will remain in office until at least 2021, when his third   term ends. \u2022 North Dakota oil pipeline protests. Demonstrators in the monthslong fight against the $3. 7 billion Dakota Access project say it will threaten water supplies, and members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe say it violates their right to sacred land. The protests have led to numerous clashes with local law enforcement. We interviewed a protester and a sheriff\u2019s deputy to explore both sides of the debate. \u2022 Pope attempts to heal religious rift. Pope Francis was in Sweden on Monday to observe the 499th anniversary of Martin Luther\u2019s protest of the sale of indulgences, which set off more than a century of religious warfare and forever changed the practice of Christianity. The pope noted the positive impact of Luther\u2019s actions on Catholicism. \u201cThe Protestant Reformation helped give greater centrality to sacred Scripture in the church\u2019s life,\u201d he said. \u2022 Physical triumphs. \u201cHaving something foreign in my body after a cancer diagnosis is the last thing I wanted,\u201d said Debbie Bowers, a breast cancer survivor. \u201cI just wanted to heal. \u201d She is one of a growing number of women \u201cgoing flat\u201d rather than having additional surgery to reconstruct their breasts. Separately, we spent time with competitors in a megatriathlon race that requires 703 miles of swimming, biking and running over five days. \u201cThis is not good for my body,\u201d one participant said, \u201cbut it is good for my soul. \u201d \u2022 The yogurt company Chobani and its founder, Hamdi Ulukaya, have been criticized for hiring refugees and are being targeted by racist attacks on social media. \u201cHe\u2019s the xenophobe\u2019s nightmare,\u201d the executive director of Human Rights Watch said. \u201cHere\u2019s an immigrant who isn\u2019t competing for jobs, but is creating jobs big time. \u201d \u2022 The tech billionaire Peter Thiel defended his support of Mr. Trump in a speech on Monday, and said that Silicon Valley was out of touch with most of the country. \u201cI think the truth has been more one of specific success but more general failure,\u201d he said, suggesting that the tech industry had not done much for people outside of Silicon Valley. \u2022 What happens to all the leftover Halloween candy? Buyback programs and donation drives for charities help absorb the surplus. \u2022 U. S. stocks were slightly down on Monday. Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets. \u2022 Be transported. We\u2019re introducing a series of immersive 360 videos that let you experience Times journalism in a powerful new way. The first offers a rare glimpse of   Yemen after a deadly airstrike. Watch it here. \u2022 New to read. The ranks of the literary detective are getting a new member. His name is Isaiah Quintabe (the book is titled \u201cIQ\u201d) and he\u2019s from the same part of Long Beach, Calif. as Snoop Dogg. Our reviewer calls Quintabe a \u201cfine, durable character for the long run. \u201d We also recently reviewed the latest horror novels, and six new thrillers for fall. \u2022 World Series, Game 6. The Cleveland Indians can win their first title since 1948 tonight (8 p. m. Eastern, Fox) or the Chicago Cubs can force a    Game 7. Either way, relief pitching has been the dominant story of the series, our columnist writes. \u2022 Recipes of the day. Learn how to master two   side dishes: roasted vegetables and fried rice. Halloween may be over in the United States, but Mexico and Central America are celebrating D\u00eda de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead. Hundreds of years ago, the Aztecs of that region honored their dead with elaborate rituals in the summer. The invading Spanish could not stamp out the tradition, and it was eventually merged with the Roman Catholic holidays of All Saints Day (Nov. 1) and All Souls Day the next day. Decorative skulls made of sugar are the most famous symbols of the holiday. They\u2019re sometimes eaten or used on masks and dolls to represent the sweetness of life. People honoring Day of the Dead also visit the graves of their relatives and build ofrendas, or small altars with flowers and gifts, inside their homes. On Saturday, Mexico City hosted its first official D\u00eda de los Muertos parade. The inspiration: last year\u2019s James Bond movie. \u201cSpectre\u201d begins with a chase through a Day of the Dead parade, and Mexican officials saw an opportunity to promote the capital city. Tens of thousands of people attended the parade. Among the marchers was a troupe dressed as Aztec warriors on   skates. \u201cIt would be hard to conserve these traditions without any changes,\u201d its leader said.
