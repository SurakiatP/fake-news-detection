And supporters of Bernie Sanders packed up their signs, some of his admirers still unmoved by Mrs. Clinton as the clock ran out on the Democratic National Convention. Our takeaways from the convention\u2019s final night: Bill Clinton took pains this week to cast his wife as a \u201cchange maker. \u201d You will not hear Mrs. Clinton object. But under the brightest spotlight of an election brimming with outsider fervor  \u2014   powering Donald J. Trump to the Republican nomination and Mr. Sanders to unexpected success  \u2014   Mrs. Clinton presented herself as something different. She is a creature of the system and unapologetic about her r\u00e9sum\u00e9. \u201cSometimes the people at this podium are new to the national stage,\u201d she said, preparing to tick off her many titles. \u201cI am not one of those people. \u201d It is a gambit premised in part on her atypical Republican opponent  \u2014   and a hope that promises of incremental change might sound more palatable when the alternative is viewed as truly dangerous. \u201cI sweat the details,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. Voters might not. But she is betting, at least, that they think someone should. Demonstrations inside and outside the convention hall this week made clear that Mrs. Clinton had some work to do to persuade at least some   supporters of Mr. Sanders. On Thursday, she seemed to acknowledge as much, quickly addressing them directly with a simple message: I hear you. \u201cYour cause is our cause,\u201d she said, thanking Mr. Sanders for placing issues of economic and social justice \u201cfront and center, where they belong. \u201d Total unity has been elusive, and could remain so. As Mrs. Clinton accepted the nomination, some Sanders delegates stood   occasionally booing or silently protesting. During the Republican primary race, Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed ban on Muslim immigration appeared to do nothing but help at the polls, even as rivals objected with varying degrees of outrage. Democrats appear convinced they can win the argument among the wider electorate. And they may have found their most potent voice: Khizr Khan, an American Muslim whose son, Humayun S. M. Khan, was killed in Iraq. In a stirring address, his stoicism building to a controlled simmer, Mr. Khan challenged Mr. Trump on behalf of \u201cpatriotic American Muslims\u201d everywhere. \u201cYou have sacrificed nothing,\u201d Mr. Khan said, his wife standing silently beside him, \u201cand no one. \u201d For organizers, the choice to showcase Mr. Khan amounted to a pointed dare: Are these people not American enough for you, Mr. Trump? Mr. Trump has presented himself as something of a     plan, arguing that he is the lone force standing between the United States and   dystopia. Republican leaders have accused Democrats of giving terrorism issues short shrift in Philadelphia. But as Thursday\u2019s slate made clear, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s team believes that Mr. Trump, with his scattershot defense policies and often erratic statements, has supplied an opportunity. For much of the evening, matters of public safety took center stage, with testimony from a retired Marine general  \u2014   to chants of \u201cU. S. A. !\u201d  \u2014   a Texas sheriff and the relatives of fallen officers. It was consistent with a theme of the week: No presumed Republican motif  \u2014   from an emphasis on national defense to conspicuous invocations of faith to warm quotations of Ronald Reagan  \u2014   is safe from Democratic encroachment in the age of Trump. In her presidential runs, Mrs. Clinton has at times struggled with how, and how often, to highlight her gender. No more. First Chelsea Clinton paid tribute to her maternal compassion, saying that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s own mother would be proud. Then Mrs. Clinton, calling herself \u201cmy mother\u2019s daughter and my daughter\u2019s mother,\u201d stopped to cheer her nomination as \u201ca milestone in our nation\u2019s march toward a more perfect union. \u201d There is a risk in turning off male voters, with whom she has fared poorly in surveys. Mrs. Clinton argued explicitly that they, too, had a stake in her success, whether or not they recognized it. \u201cWhen any barrier falls in America,\u201d she said, \u201cit clears the way for everyone. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563898.5011413}
