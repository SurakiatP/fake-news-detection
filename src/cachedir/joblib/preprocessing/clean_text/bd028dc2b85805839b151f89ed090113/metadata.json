But senior Democratic officials concede that the blueprint has already been chosen for them  \u2014   by an incensed army of liberals demanding no less than total war against President Trump. Immediately after the November election, Democrats were divided over how to handle Mr. Trump, with one camp favoring   confrontation and another backing a seemingly less risky approach of coaxing him to the center with offers of compromise. Now, spurred by explosive protests and a torrent of angry phone calls and emails from constituents  \u2014   and outraged themselves by Mr. Trump\u2019s swift moves to enact a   agenda  \u2014   Democrats have all but cast aside any notion of conciliation with the White House. Instead, they are mimicking the Republican approach of the last eight years  \u2014   the \u201cparty of no\u201d  \u2014   and wagering that brash obstruction will pay similar dividends. Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, vice chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, said there had been a \u201ctornado of support\u201d for    resistance to Mr. Trump. Mr. Inslee, who backed a lawsuit against the president\u2019s executive order banning refugee admissions and travel from seven   countries, said Democrats intended to send a stern message to Mr. Trump during a conference of governors in the nation\u2019s capital. \u201cMy belief is, we have to resist every way and everywhere, every time we can,\u201d when Mr. Trump offends core American values, Mr. Inslee said. By undermining Mr. Trump across the board, he said, Democrats hope to split Republicans away from a president of their own party. \u201cUltimately, we\u2019d like to have a few Republicans stand up to rein him in,\u201d Mr. Inslee said. \u201cThe more air goes out of his balloon, the earlier and likelier that is to happen. \u201d Yet Democrats acknowledge there is a wide gulf between the party\u2019s desire to fight Mr. Trump and its power to thwart him, quietly worrying that the expectations of the party\u2019s activist base may outpace what Democratic lawmakers can achieve. \u201cThey want us to impeach him immediately,\u201d said Representative John Yarmuth, Democrat of Kentucky. \u201cAnd of course we can\u2019t do that by ourselves. \u201d Some in the party also fret that a posture of unremitting hostility to the president could imperil lawmakers in red states that Mr. Trump won last year, or compromise efforts for Democrats to present themselves to moderate voters as an inoffensive alternative to the polarizing president. Rarely have Democrats been so weakened. Republicans control the White House, both chambers of Congress and 33 governorships, and they are preparing to install a fifth conservative, Neil M. Gorsuch, on the Supreme Court. Further, because of changes to Senate rules that were enacted under Democratic control, the party has been unable to block Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet nominees from being confirmed by a simple majority vote. Democrats, in other words, have few instruments at the moment to wound Mr. Trump\u2019s administration in the manner their core voters are demanding. Still, a mood of stiff opposition has taken hold on Capitol Hill, with Democrats besieged by constituents enraged by Mr. Trump\u2019s actions  \u2014   and lawmakers sharing their alarm. \u201cWe have to fight like hell to stop him and hopefully save our country,\u201d said Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, echoing the   stakes liberal voters are giving voice to at crowded town hall meetings. Senator Thomas R. Carper of Delaware, a     Democrat up for   in 2018, cautioned that loathing Mr. Trump, on its own, was not a governing strategy. He said he still hoped for compromise with Republicans on infrastructure funding and perhaps on a plan to improve or \u201crepair\u201d the Affordable Care Act. \u201cThere is this vitriol and dislike for our new president,\u201d Mr. Carper said. \u201cThe challenge for us is to harness it in a productive way and a constructive way, and I think we will. \u201d But Mr. Carper said the deliberations over Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet appointments had woken up Democrats, recalling that he had heard from thousands of voters about Scott Pruitt, Mr. Trump\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency administrator, and Betsy DeVos, his education secretary. Virtually every message expressed seething opposition, he said. At times, Democratic frustration with Mr. Trump has already flared well beyond the normal range of opposition discourse: In Virginia, Tom Perriello, a former congressman seeking his party\u2019s nomination for governor, apologized after calling Mr. Trump\u2019s election a \u201cpolitical and constitutional Sept. 11. \u201d And in New Jersey, Phil Murphy, a former Goldman Sachs banker and ambassador to Germany, drew criticism in his campaign for governor after likening the current political moment in America to the rise of Adolf Hitler. Among    Democrats, however, it is far from clear that the rhetoric of heated opposition is unwelcome. A survey published on Wednesday by the Pew Research Center found that nearly   of Democrats said they were concerned the party would not do enough to oppose Mr. Trump only 20 percent were concerned Democrats would go too far in opposition. A handful of liberal groups have already sprung up threatening to wage primary challenges against incumbent Democrats whom they see as insufficiently militant against Mr. Trump, raising the prospect of the same internecine wars that plagued Republicans during President Barack Obama\u2019s administration. In the race for the chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee, which concludes with a vote in Atlanta on Saturday, the restive mood of liberal activists has buoyed a pair of insurgents, Representative Keith Ellison of Minnesota and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. against the perceived   Thomas E. Perez. Mr. Perez, who was Mr. Obama\u2019s labor secretary, is still viewed as a favorite in the race, and he has been backed by former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. But he has struggled to dispel the impression that he is an anointed favorite of Washington power brokers. And Mr. Ellison and Mr. Buttigieg have continued to collect   endorsements: Mr. Ellison won the support of Representative John Lewis of Georgia, the civil rights leader, on Tuesday, and Mr. Buttigieg was endorsed Wednesday by Howard Dean, the former party chairman who remains admired on the left. In a sign of how little heed Democrats are paying to traditional forces, Mr. Ellison remains viable despite being bluntly attacked as \u201can  \u201d by Haim Saban, one of the most prolific donors to the party and its candidates. Christine C. Quinn, a vice chairwoman of the New York State Democratic Committee, who was a prominent surrogate for Hillary Clinton last year, said she backed Mr. Ellison, who was the first Muslim elected to Congress, in part because of the forcefulness of his criticism of the White House. \u201cThis is not a normal Republican president, and these are not normal times,\u201d said Ms. Quinn, a former speaker of the New York City Council. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a time for polite parties anymore. This is a time to take a different posture of true aggressiveness. \u201d Martin O\u2019Malley, a former Maryland governor who has endorsed Mr. Buttigieg, said impatient Democrats might challenge even members of their own party in their enthusiasm to take on Mr. Trump. Mr. O\u2019Malley said the party base plainly wanted leaders who would be \u201cwilling to fight the fight and where necessary filibuster and otherwise obstruct. \u201d He said he expected younger,   liberals to run against some Democratic incumbents as well as Republicans. \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing, and it\u2019s overdue,\u201d he said. So far, the most prominent leaders of the Democratic Party\u2019s activist wing, including Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have not encouraged challenges to sitting Democratic lawmakers who have accommodated Mr. Trump. Mr. Merkley, an ally of Mr. Sanders, suggested liberals seeking scalps would get no help from progressive senators if they try to unseat Democratic senators from conservative Missouri, Montana, North Dakota and West Virginia, calling those lawmakers \u201cperfectly suited to those states. \u201d Two mayors in Democratic cities, however, have gotten a taste of what awaits those who do not bow completely to the demands of the   forces: When Carolyn Goodman of Las Vegas, a Democrat turned independent, and Levar Stoney of Richmond, Va. a Democrat, resisted deeming their municipalities \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d each was met with anger from supporters of expanding protection against deportation for undocumented immigrants. \u201cThey want change to happen overnight,\u201d Mr. Stoney said of the newly energized activists. Nowhere is it more clear, however, that the protesters are leading the politicians than on Capitol Hill. Senate Democratic leaders had hoped to capitalize on Mr. Trump\u2019s nomination of Tom Price as health secretary by assailing Republicans for wanting to trim Medicare, an issue Democrats aim to run on in 2018. But Mr. Price was vastly overshadowed by the nomination of Ms. DeVos, who galvanized the new activists like no other cabinet pick. \u201cPart of what I think the Bernie campaign taught us, even the Trump campaign taught us, and now the resistance is teaching us, is just ditch the consultants and consult with your conscience and constituents first,\u201d said Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii, warning his fellow Democrats that \u201cit\u2019s a fool\u2019s errand to try to plan this out like it\u2019s a traditional political operation. \u201d Mr. Merkley boasted that \u201cwe\u2019re doing things in the Senate that are less conventional,\u201d efforts he said were aimed at conveying to   voters that \u201chey, we\u2019re here and we\u2019re fighting. \u201d Those efforts have included tactics like walking out on nomination hearings and opposing even less controversial cabinet appointments, such as that of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, the wife of the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell. The fear factor is real, said Adam Jentleson, a former Senate Democratic aide. Images of angry constituents jeering Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a reliable liberal from Rhode Island, at a town   meeting in late January for supporting the selection of Mike Pompeo as C. I. A. director quickly circulated among other Democratic senators, he said. \u201cIt was \u201d Mr. Jentleson said, \u201cbecause it made clear that the base is not going to let them off the hook. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563760.49736}
