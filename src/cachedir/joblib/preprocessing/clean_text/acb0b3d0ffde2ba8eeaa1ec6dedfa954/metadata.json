I think a lot of Muslims around the world are afraid. But many of us, especially opposed to radical Islam, are welcoming it. We don\u2019t want to prohibit refugees here forever. We, as Americans, want to help those in need, but we do think we have to make assessments based on the regions that are identified. Libya, the third front of ISIS. Somalia, beyond failed. It\u2019s own government cannot travel outside its capital, let alone govern it. Iraq, we\u2019re fighting ISIS, but special exception must be made for Iraqis helping US forces. So, we see it as very pragmatic. Muslim minorities that are persecuted badly in Pakistan and other places were thrilled that this draft wording includes penalizing those that commit honor violence or persecution of minorities. A lot of Muslims are subject to that. So, I think there is a positive feeling. \u201d She added that Trump\u2019s proposal to build safe zones in Syria is a \u201cfantastic move, and one the last administration failed for years, when Muslim leaders asked President Obama to do the same. I think any Syrian that\u2019s been displaced from their country would rather prefer to live there, if it was safe for them to do. That\u2019s a strong move. Look at what\u2019s happened, these people protesting in our city and around the world. Where were those protests when those babies were washed up? Nobody was carrying about the neglect of Syria for this  \u2014   for the last six years. So these tears are rather hollow, in my opinion. It is a powerful move to argue for   zone. \u201d Ahmed concluded that she didn\u2019t think Saudi Arabia should be on the list of countries that are under travel restrictions, because while the country is \u201ccomplicated,\u201d the US \u201cneeds it geopolitically. \u201d She further stated that since Saudi Arabia is where Mecca is, if the US \u201cprohibits American Muslims from visiting Mecca coming backwould be appalling. \u201d Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742563539.9111173}
