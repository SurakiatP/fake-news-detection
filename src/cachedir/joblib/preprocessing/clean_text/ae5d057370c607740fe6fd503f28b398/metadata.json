Trump, \u201cBrexit\u201d and the resurgent French far right, a thin, aging career politician with an ironic smile is being called  \u2014   by him and his supporters  \u2014   France\u2019s best defense against raging global populism. A first test for Alain Jupp\u00e9, 71, comes Sunday as France\u2019s mainstream   Republican party holds a primary ahead of next spring\u2019s presidential election. Mr. Jupp\u00e9 is favored to come out on top, for now. His ascendance is all the more improbable because, in a previous post, he was considered one of France\u2019s most unpopular prime ministers ever. And he was once convicted in a Paris City Hall corruption scheme. But the election of Mr. Trump has upended French politics and given new momentum to the   leader Marine Le Pen. As a result, mainstream conservatives are far from delighted. The candidacy of the   Mr. Jupp\u00e9 is seen by his supporters as a bulwark at a time when the postelection United States is now routinely depicted as one leg of a global tripartite menace, along with China and Russia, bearing down on fragile Western democracies. Mr. Jupp\u00e9 doesn\u2019t shout, wave his arms or make grandiose promises  \u2014   seen as a plus by his supporters. His professorial bearing stands in contrast to his sometimes bombastic and offending party rival, Nicolas Sarkozy, the former president who has redefined himself as a tough guy for uncertain times. But while other contenders for the presidency are adopting Mr. Trump\u2019s depiction of Muslims as an inherent threat, Mr. Jupp\u00e9\u2019s soothing message of French unity has, so far, helped him to lead opinion polls. Still, Mr. Jupp\u00e9\u2019s tenure as prime minister during the 1990s was one of the most divisive in modern French history, marked by proposed cutbacks to generous   pensions that brought thousands into the streets in protest. Mr. Jupp\u00e9\u2019s plan ultimately failed. This time around, he has promised more   reforms and has vowed not to back down in the face of inevitable protests. In that regard, the technocratic Mr. Jupp\u00e9, of all the contenders, may present the biggest challenge to France\u2019s social protections and labor rules. The governing Socialists, saddled with a poor economic record and an unpopular incumbent president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, are already being written off. The race is considered the right\u2019s to lose. Just behind Mr. Sarkozy in the polls, nipping at his heels, is another former prime minister, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon. The winner of Sunday\u2019s Republican primary  \u2014   there will be a runoff on Nov. 27  \u2014   is considered likely to face Ms. Le Pen in April\u2019s presidential election. If previous patterns hold, Ms. Le Pen will be defeated, which would make Mr. Jupp\u00e9 the likeliest of all those now running to become the next French president. The announcement on Wednesday by Emmanuel Macron, a popular former economy minister in the Socialist government, that he, too, will enter the presidential race is unlikely to change the right and   dynamic, in the eyes of many observers. At 38, Mr. Macron has the image of a youthful reformer, but analysts have noted his thin record, lack of a party base, and absence of heft  \u2014   he has never held elected office  \u2014   in a universe of surging populism. Mr. Jupp\u00e9, on the other hand, has won and lost numerous elections and has served for many years as the mayor of Bordeaux, where he has been credited with transforming the city. But, with   high unemployment, an injection of energy from Mr. Trump\u2019s victory into Ms. Le Pen\u2019s campaign  \u2014   xenophobic nationalism is her core theme  \u2014   and the same social and economic fractures as in the United States, there are no guarantees. The warning signs from across the Atlantic were evident in a campaign swing through Lower Burgundy on Wednesday, as Mr. Jupp\u00e9 met with disgruntled farmers and rural officials. The French news media has noted that the American election results have colored the former prime minister\u2019s message with concern about the existence of two Frances: one benefiting from globalization, and the other left behind. There are the large, vibrant cities  \u2014   Paris, Lyon, Mr. Jupp\u00e9\u2019s Bordeaux  \u2014   and then there are the shuttered main streets of sleepy provincial capitals and rural towns like those he visited on Wednesday. Wearing the coat and tie he appears never to shed, Mr. Jupp\u00e9 got his shoes muddy at a grain and dairy farm whose owner complained of crushing debt. \u201cPeople have talked about suffering,\u201d Mr. Jupp\u00e9 told a roomful in the tiny village of St.  \u2019Ordon, \u201cand it is true,\u201d he said, speaking in a knowing, weary tone, careful never to exaggerate. With his eyebrows slightly arched, he listened patiently to the complaints. Rural France feels \u201cabandoned\u201d and \u201cdisdained\u201d by Paris, Mr. Jupp\u00e9 said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t accept this gulf between the big cities and rural France. \u201d Promising a \u201cstrong state,\u201d he had a warning for his audience deep in the Burgundian countryside at St.   : \u201cThe world is becoming more and more dangerous. Nationalism is on the rise. \u201d Similarly, at a rally this week in northern Paris, the perceived menace of rising populism was a common theme in the speeches and comments of Mr. Jupp\u00e9\u2019s supporters. From Mr. Jupp\u00e9 himself and the other   speakers who preceded him, Mr. Trump\u2019s name came up often. Each time, it was met with loud boos from the crowd of around 6, 000. Mr. Jupp\u00e9  \u2014   \u201ca man of culture,\u201d one speaker called him  \u2014   was depicted as the antithesis of Mr. Trump. \u201cAfter the election of Donald Trump, after Brexit, will populism triumph in our country? No!\u201d shouted Patrick Devedjian, a former minister, who introduced Mr. Jupp\u00e9 at the rally. The crowd  \u2014   mostly   or older,   and carefully dressed, like Mr. Jupp\u00e9  \u2014   roared approval. \u201cWe\u2019ve had it up to here with populist baseness!\u201d Mr. Devedjian said. Another supporter,   Lagarde, a prominent centrist politician, told the crowd, \u201cFrance doesn\u2019t need a   in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e!\u201d  \u2014   referring to the presidential palace in Paris. Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse, president of the Paris region\u2019s council, was equally scathing. \u201cPopulism is about not telling the truth,\u201d she said. \u201cAlain,\u201d she added, turning to Mr. Jupp\u00e9, seated in the front row, \u201cyou are the antidote to populism. \u201d Mr. Jupp\u00e9, who spoke in pithy bullet points, promised to stand up to enemies and rivals  \u2014   both internal and external. In a brisk speech that reflected his classical education at France\u2019s top schools, he brought up Mr. Trump in the context of threats to France. \u201cI don\u2019t know what Donald Trump\u2019s foreign policy will be,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cHe has said contradictory things. What I know is, there will be an aggressive commercial policy. So we must be aggressive, too. \u201d Setting himself up as a defender of European unity  \u2014   Ms. Le Pen is fiercely opposed to the European Union  \u2014   Mr. Jupp\u00e9 said: \u201cFrance can be a world power, in thrall to nobody. But separated, we will be vassals of the big empires all around us: Russia, China and the U. S. \u201d Afterward, encountered on the boulevard outside the rally, he wondered whether his comments about Mr. Trump had been too \u201coffensive. \u201d Mr. Jupp\u00e9 has served twice as France\u2019s foreign minister and chooses his words carefully. But then he shrugged his shoulders, saying about Mr. Trump, \u201cWe\u2019ll see. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562744.3634462}
