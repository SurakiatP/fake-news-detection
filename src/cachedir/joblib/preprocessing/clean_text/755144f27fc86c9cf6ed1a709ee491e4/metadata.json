Because President Obama announced his decision to free Oscar Lopez Rivera, a Puerto Rican domestic terrorist serving 55 years in prison. [Rivera was a leader of the FALN   Puerto Rico terrorist group who claimed responsibility for more than 120 bombings, including the bombing of a New York bar that killed four people in 1975 and wounded 60 others.  Rivera\u2019s freedom is a cause for leftist Latinos, something that Senator Bernie Sanders seized during his presidential campaign to rally Latino activists. \u201cOscar Lopez Rivera has served 34 years in prison for his commitment to Puerto Rico\u2019s independence,\u201d Sanders wrote on Twitter in May 2016. \u201cI say to President Obama: let him out. \u201d New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio also celebrated Rivera\u2019s freedom on Twitter. \u201cThank you @POTUS for freeing #OscarLopezRivera,\u201d he wrote in English and Spanish. \u201cCongratulations to all who fought for this day. \u201d Rep. Luis Gutierrez was also emotional about the news. \u201cI am overjoyed and overwhelmed with emotion,\u201d he said in a statement calling Rivera a \u201cnational hero. \u201d \u201cIt will be a blessed day when I can walk and talk with my friend in the fresh air, far from prison walls, and I am so looking forward to that day,\u201d Gutierrez continued. According to the White House, Rivera was serving prison time for the following crimes after FBI officials discovered dynamite and blasting caps in his apartment: \u201cI have no regrets for what I\u2019ve done in the Puerto Rico independence movement,\u201d Rivera said in 1998. \u201cThe onus is not on us. The crime is colonialism. \u201d Thanks to Obama, Rivera\u2019s prison term will expire on May 17, 2017, allowing him to walk free.'"}, "time": 1742564239.1587055}
