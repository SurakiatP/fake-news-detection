It\u2019s just one of the revelations from the latest Wikileaks dump of emails hacked from the Clinton presidential campaign. WikiLeaks has dumped yet another batch of emails from the account of Hillary Clinton\u2019s beleaguered campaign chair, John Podesta. This is the 21st batch of messages to be published by the whistleblowing site.\\nRELEASE: The Podesta Emails Part 21 #PodestaEmails #PodestaEmails21 #HillaryClinton https://t.co/wzxeh70oUm pic.twitter.com/kkdyFXmTLD \\n\u2014 WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) October 28, 2016 \\n\\nThe damage to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign can not be underestimated and there is still more to come. WikiLeaks have said there will be a total of 50,000 emails released in the lead up to the November 8 US presidential election. Friday\u2019s batch brings the total so far to 35,594.\\nIn them, an email from leading US attorney Erika Rottenberg to Clinton staffers reveals that many US lawyers had serious doubts over the legality of Hillary Clinton using a private server for her emails, when she was the US Secretary of State. In an exchange dating to June 2015, Rottenberg suggests that Clinton\u2019s actions are both suspicious and hypocritical. \u201cI know when I talk to my friends who are attorneys we are all struggling with what happened to the emails and aren\u2019t satisfied with answers to date.\\n\\n\u201cWhile we all know of the occasional use of personal email addresses for business, none of my friends circle can understand how it was viewed as ok/secure/appropriate to use a private server for secure documents AND why further Hillary took it upon herself to review them and delete documents without providing anyone outside her circle a chance to weigh in.\u201d\\nRottenberg goes on to imply that Clinton may be guilty of illegal activity.\\n\u201cIt smacks of acting above the law and it smacks of the type of thing I\u2019ve either gotten discovery sanctions for, fired people for.\u201d\\nHillary Clinton has never been able to shake the specter of her emails scandal and while questions of legality, as well as of potential security breaches, remain unanswered, the debacle continues to wound her campaign\u2019s chances. In an effort to redirect the US public\u2019s attention, other Clinton staffers urged their candidate to better pander to \u201cdumb\u201d millennials to get them \u201cto fall in line.\u201d In February 2016, marketing executive Wendy Bronfein told Clinton insiders that Bernie Sanders was appealing to young voters, and that Clinton needed to do so too. \u201cShe may not be the best face of it so maybe it\u2019s trending figures to advocate for her b/c that\u2019s the crap that young people pay attention to. I hate to generalize a generation but by social media nature, they \u2018follow\u2019. So if someone they identify as cool endorses \u2014 they will likely fall in line with that.\u201d In a dismissive aside, she ended: \u201cDon\u2019t forget Bill had \u2018don\u2019t stop\u2019 campaign song, that was a pop culture play and had his Saxophone moments. It\u2019s f$*king dumb but being \u2018cool\u2019 counts for more than it maybe should.\u201d\\n\\nThe patronizing tone of such exchanges has enraged many voters, who have take to social media to protest.\\n\\nEarlier in January 2015, another campaign insider urged Clinton to pander to ethnic minorities.\\nNeera Tanden is a long standing Clinton insider, at the same time as being the president of the think tank, the Center for American Progress. One email from Friday\u2019s WikiLeaks batch shows Tanden challenging Clinton\u2019s campaign chair, John Podesta himself.\\n\\n\u201cI\u2019m not the diversity police but there is grumbling on the 4 white boys running next presidential cycle. So I recommend rolling out some people who look like the rest of America soon!\u201d\\nPodesta\u2019s response: \u201cReally, don\u2019t you think I know that?\u201d If only Podesta had known then that tens of thousands of his emails were soon to be hacked\u2026\\nSource: Sputnik News \\n'"}, "time": 1742563822.9752889}
