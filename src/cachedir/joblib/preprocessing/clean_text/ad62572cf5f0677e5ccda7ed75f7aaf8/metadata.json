I\u2019m going to do everything that I can to keep my colleagues interested enough to want to fight to see exactly what happened. Because I believe that there was a connection between Donald Trump\u2019s campaign and the Russians and the Kremlin. And I do believe that those connections are there for a reason. And I think that the work that has already been discovered, that was done, in order to have Trump, should be followed up. We shouldn\u2019t say  \u2014   let our intelligence agency say, yes we discovered that the DNC was hacked, and that efforts were made to help Trump in this campaign and to undermine Hillary Clinton, and that\u2019s it. We don\u2019t have to do anything else. No, this is serious and I think that we must continue this struggle to dig deeper, to drill deeper. \u201d She continued, \u201cI think there is a trail, and I think that the Obama administration has done everything that it can possibly do, and that\u2019s probably been verified somewhat by the New York Times, to make sure that enough people have seen some of the meetings and some of the connections, so that they have something to go on when the investigations are really underway. \u201d Waters added, \u201cWhat we know is that, we can\u2019t trust the AG. We can\u2019t trust the FBI. We can\u2019t trust Comey. We can\u2019t trust Sessions, and so, we\u2019ve got to get an independent overseer of some kind in here to get going with these investigations. \u201d (  Grabien) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742561773.9460242}
