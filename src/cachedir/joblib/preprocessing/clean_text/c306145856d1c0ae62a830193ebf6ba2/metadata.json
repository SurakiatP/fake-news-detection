Things that make you go hmmmm\u2026.,\u201d responded another Twitter user. The African-American voter said he complained that the polling station appeared to be using old machines. \u201cI just thought about it, I didn\u2019t have to show ID to vote either,\u201d he subsequently tweeted. \\nCBS News reports that Trump voters in Pennsylvania are seeing their votes switched to Hillary Clinton. \\n\u201cI went back, pressed Trump again. Three times I did this, so then I called one of the women that were working the polls over. And she said you must be doing it wrong. She did it three times and it defaulted to Hillary every time,\u201d Bobbie Lee Hawranko said. As we reported earlier , Trump supporters are also seeing voting machines change their votes in Philadelphia while others have been harassed. \\nIf you haven\u2019t checked out and liked our Facebook page, please go here and do so.
