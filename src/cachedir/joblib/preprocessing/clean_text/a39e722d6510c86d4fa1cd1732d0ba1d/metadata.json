While it never mentions Trump by name, the memo says the Beverly   company\u2019s PAC will focus on \u201cconvening internal and external forums with politicians and allied stakeholders, connecting our clients with elected officials, introducing   matching policies to support donations of time and money, and developing actionable public policy solutions. \u201d \u201cThis company\u2019s greatest asset is the diversity of our backgrounds and beliefs. Please know that we will do everything in our power to support and protect this diversity now and in the months and years ahead,\u201d the email concludes. Emanuel has deep ties to both Republicans and Democrats. He donated to Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign and his brother, Rahm Emanuel, served as President Barack Obama\u2019s chief of staff and is now the mayor of Chicago. President Trump called Ari Emanuel the \u201cKing of Hollywood\u201d during a meeting between the two at his New Jersey golf club two weeks after the election. News of   forming a federal PAC comes on the heels of reports that United Talent Agency, another major talent agency in Hollywood, has canceled its annual Oscar party and will instead host a rally in support of refugees at its Los Angeles office.
