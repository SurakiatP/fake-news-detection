President Donald Trump\u2019s dismissal of FBI Director James Comey as \u201chighly suspicious\u201d running several articles and bulletins drawing comparisons with the Watergate scandal which brought down President Richard Nixon in 1974. [In an article on the BBC News website, titled \u201cDid President Trump fire James Comey as part of a  ?\u201d the corporation\u2019s senior North America reporter Anthony Zurcher speculates that \u201cthe abruptness and timing of Mr Comey\u2019s dismissal, to put it mildly, is highly suspicious\u201d.  \u201cWhile the White House has said that the move is based on concerns over how Mr Comey handled last year\u2019s investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server, not many people   \u2026     are buying that line,\u201d he writes, with little further elaboration. \u201cIf the dismissal was because of the email investigation, why act now?\u201d he asks. Zurcher does, however, acknowledge that many of the Democrat politicians \u201chowling\u201d over Comey\u2019s dismissal, such as Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, had previously called for the director to be axed when he announced an investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s leaked emails was being reopened during the 2016 presidential election. Democrats were calling for Comey\u2019s firing until Trump actually did it. pic. twitter.   \u2014   Josh Jordan (@NumbersMuncher) May 10, 2017,  In another article from 6 March, with the provocative title, \u201cEchoes of Watergate resurface as   links probed\u201d the BBC provided a space for a number of individuals to cast aspersions at President Trump and his   Jeff Sessions. The article quotes former Nixon lawyer John Dean as a \u201cprominent voice\u201d who believes he has \u201cbeen hearing echoes of Watergate ever since this presidency started\u201d accusing the   of \u201cdissembling\u201d. It also states that \u201cRussia is believed to have wanted Mr Trump to win the election [and an] unverified report apparently compiled by a private intelligence firm claimed Russia had compromising information on Mr Trump and was in a position to blackmail him\u201d providing little in the way of explanation. It immediately follows up by pointing out that \u201csome commentators\u201d such as George W. Bush\u2019s ethics lawyer Richard Painter \u201cnow fear the Russian connection could make Watergate seem trivial\u201d. FUN FACT: President Nixon never fired the Director of the FBI #FBIDirector #notNixonian pic. twitter.   \u2014   RichardNixonLibrary (@NixonLibrary) May 9, 2017,  The article offers nothing in the way of countervailing opinion until its conclusion, in which it briefly discusses a tweet from President Trump in which he accuses Barack Obama of having tapped his phones. However, in contrast to its coverage of individuals speculating negatively on the president\u2019s motives for dismissing Comey, the BBC is quick to point out that the   claims are only an \u201callegation\u201d for which \u201cMr Trump has not provided evidence\u201d.'"}, "time": 1742628309.0776377}
