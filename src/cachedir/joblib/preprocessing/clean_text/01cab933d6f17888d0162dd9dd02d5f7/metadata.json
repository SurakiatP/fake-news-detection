{"duration": 0.10112428665161133, "input_args": {"text": "'Through nearly five seasons of \u201cVeep,\u201d we\u2019ve seen Selina Meyer suffer embarrassments galore and absorb loss after loss, to the point that some may wonder how anyone so   and ineffectual ever wound up in the Oval Office. This week\u2019s episode answers that question: It\u2019s because Selina can be vicious. \u201cVeep\u201d can rarely be called triumphant, but toward the end of this episode, when a dazzlingly attired President Meyer is demolishing her enemies with devastating words and a killer smile   \u2026     well, for a few moments she actually is the most powerful person in the free world. She\u2019s stunning, in every sense of the word. Selina\u2019s ballroom blitz is especially satisfying given that \u201cCongressional Ball\u201d lines it up alongside the spectacular flameout of congressional candidate Jonah Ryan. Most of this episode cuts between the annual White House nondenominational holiday party and a typical New Hampshire campaign stop for Jonah, where his quick temper results in a possible   blunder. Riding high in the polls after essentially making \u201cJonah Ryan: He\u2019ll Yell at Women for You\u201d into his slogan, the hulking   lashes out at his old bully Teddy Sykes, not realizing that his opponents have angled their camera phones to make it look like he\u2019s hollering insults at a bowling alley employee with Down syndrome. Without making too big of a deal about it, this episode delivers a cogent point about using rage as a political weapon. In Selina\u2019s experienced hands, anger is a live grenade. The difference between her and the wannabes is that she knows when and where to throw it. Once again, kudos go to the \u201cVeep\u201d writers who came up with the idea to have Jonah run for Congress. Nothing in \u201cCongressional Ball\u201d measures up to last week\u2019s brilliant campaign ad  \u2014   with Jonah chasing a child around a playground in super creepy slow motion  \u2014   but even before his alley accident, this episode spins a lot of gold from his   stump speeches, each ending with an instrumental version of \u201cI Won\u2019t Back Down. \u201d (According to Richard Splett, they\u2019ve been getting increasingly angry letters from Tom Petty. But, hey, who hasn\u2019t?) The highlight of the Jonah half of this episode  \u2014   aside from the little Howard Dean scream he gives at the end of the list of New Hampshire towns he hopes to win  \u2014   comes early, in his mock debate with Richard. Dan Egan and uncle Jeff try to keep Jonah from relying too much on his trademark \u201czingers,\u201d like when he answers a question about the debt ceiling by quoting \u201cthe late Lionel Richie\u201d (who\u2019s not actually dead). The   Mr. Ryan responds by saying it\u2019s not fair that Richard \u201cgets to be the easier person, and I have to be me. \u201d So yes, it\u2019s fun to see Jonah get knocked down hard yet again at the end of this episode, even if its at the hands of political operatives as odious as Teddy and Bill Ericsson. On the flip side, in classic \u201cVeep\u201d style, multiple characters get comeuppances they don\u2019t deserve. Poor Mike McLintock drops awkward hockey metaphors into his news conferences, in hopes of schmoozing his way into a gig as a director of communications with the N. H. L.  \u2014   thus escaping the toxic White House atmosphere before he and his wife start their family. Instead, he finds out at the ball that a former Meyer administration scapegoat has already landed the job. Meanwhile, when Gary\u2019s unexpectedly included on the list of Washington\u2019s \u201c50 Hottest Staffers\u201d (at No. 21!) he lords it over his colleagues, only to find out later that the publication confused him with another Gary. As viewers, is the abject humiliation of two basically decent guys mitigated by Selina\u2019s success? That\u2019s always the question with \u201cVeep. \u201d Make no mistake: Selina is not a good person, something we again see in the way she treats her daughter, Catherine: first by asking if she\u2019s planning to be \u201cEllen or Jodie Foster\u201d in her level of openness about her new lesbian relationship, then by constantly insulting her hair at the ball. (Nothing better encapsulates Selina\u2019s casual cruelty to Catherine than the way she criticizes her daughter\u2019s loose hair \u201ctentacles\u201d in one scene, and after the strands are secured, gripes, \u201cExcept it\u2019s still just a rat\u2019s nest in the back. \u201d) The brilliance of \u201cVeep,\u201d though, rests in how it elicits sympathy for Selina simply by showing what she has to deal with every day. In \u201cCongressional Ball\u201d she spends an evening sucking up to congressmen and congresswomen, who all make dopey demands in exchange for their support in the tiebreaking presidential vote. She promises the same cabinet appointments to multiple people, and has to nod approvingly when one Montanan makes his pitch for a Sept. 11 memorial in Bozeman (to salute the local first responders who were traumatized by what happened to the first responders in New York). And while she\u2019s   this bunch, she\u2019s always keeping one eye on Tom James, her presumptive vice president who\u2019s also working the room, trying to get those backing Selina to abstain from the vote. His plan is to manipulate the House vote into another tie, which would throw the election to the Senate, where procedural arcana could catapult him to the presidency. That\u2019s what sets up the episode\u2019s thrilling bit of political jujitsu as Selina sidles up to each of her backstabbers one by one, letting them know just how badly she could hurt them if they disappoint her. She saves her most savage takedown for Tom, whom she literally dances with in front of the news media while quietly whispering in his ear all the dirt she has. Then she takes him back to her office, yells at him some more and has sex with him. The speed, fury and totality of Selina\u2019s power move is a joy to watch, even though  \u2014   if we\u2019re being honest  \u2014   Tom would probably make a better president. This series toys with our sympathies in that way, pushing us to root for the undeserving and all because when the narrative of politics gets reduced to a horse race, we can\u2019t help but cheer a win. A lot has been written about what \u201cVeep\u201d has to say about the destructiveness and pettiness of American governance. But in episodes like this one, the show is just as revealing about our basest instincts as voters.'"}, "time": 1742561680.723526}
