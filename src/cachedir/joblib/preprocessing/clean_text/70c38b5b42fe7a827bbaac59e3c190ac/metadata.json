As you may know, I\u2019m an American who was born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio, although I made a life decision four years ago to permanently leave the US and move to the Russian Federation. If you\u2019re interested in my specific background and what motivated me to take that step, I suggest that you check out the interview that I gave to Serbian-American journalist Stephen Karganovic about this last spring when I visited him in Belgrade. \\nI\u2019m addressing you all directly in a form which I never use in my articles, and that\u2019s the first-person. I know that so many of you guys are confused and struggling to understand why Trump won, and I totally understand what you\u2019re feeling because it\u2019s very difficult for any foreigner to truly comprehend what just happened in the US. The best way for me to convey this to you all is to talk on a personal level in the hopes that my delivery will get through to you. I\u2019m not expecting anyone to agree with the points that I make, but just to understand what motivated Trump supporters to get out to the polls and shake up The Establishment. \\nAlthough I don\u2019t live in the US anymore, I was born and raised in one of the most quintessential representations of what constitutes modern-day \u201caverage America\u201d, and that\u2019s Cleveland, Ohio. Despite being nearly halfway across the world, I never lost touch with where I came from and will always remember the formative experiences which shaped my worldview. I still stay in contact with my American family and several close friends so I remain up to date on what\u2019s going on \u201cback home\u201d, and as they say, \u201cyou can take someone out of their homeland, but you can\u2019t take the homeland out of the person\u201d. \\nFor better or for worse, I\u2019ll always embody certain \u201cAmerican\u201d characteristics forged from my upbringing in Cleveland, and given that these idiosyncrasies are now representative of the prevailing political zeitgeist in the US as evidenced by Trump\u2019s Triumph, I want to share some of them with you all in the hopes that everyone can get a better grasp on the fundamental changes that are taking place in the US today. A man who I call \u201cUncle Vinny\u201d once inspiringly advised me when I was younger that \u201cthe difference between genius and crazy is in getting others to understand you\u201d, so with that wisdom in mind, here\u2019s the best that I can do in trying to help all my foreign friends understand the mentality of the typical Trump supporter. \\nSo many toxic individuals said that I and tens of millions of other people were \u201cracists\u201d, \u201cfascists\u201d, and \u201cwhite supremacists\u201d just because we\u2019ve been publicly sharing our observations over the past year and a half that Trump\u2019s rhetoric and platform represent the desires of many Americans, but we held our ground and doubled down because we knew that we were right and that the American People would ultimately choose Donald J. Trump to be the next President of the United States. \\nThis is why \u201coutsiders\u201d such as myself and everyone else who rallied behind Trump are so valuable to the larger conversations taking place because we consistently break through the narrow-minded groupthink of The Establishment and express what\u2019s really going on, \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d be damned. No foreigner can ever fully understand what happened yesterday, not even if they lived in the US for years unless they experienced what the middle class (not the academic-governmental-business class) experienced for their entire lives. \\nMichael Moore, who\u2019s also a native of the \u201cRust Belt\u201d like myself and understands the mentality of the millions of Americans who revolted against The Establishment and historically broke through Hillary\u2019s Midwest \u201cfirewall\u201d, conveyed the reason why voters in this dilapidated and socio-economically \u201cbackward/forgotten\u201d corner of the US would flock towards Trump in an address which was ironically supposed to be against the future President-elect. Trump supporters, however, decided to turn the most relevant and motivational part of Moore\u2019s speech into a YouTube video filled with dramatic images and music, and I strongly suggest that everyone take five minutes out of their day to listen to what he had to say. \\nWhen you live a life surrounded by drugs, poverty, crime, potholes, and hopelessness, the only thing that you feel that you have going for you are the sexual, alcoholic, and musical distractions that The Establishment shoves down everyone\u2019s throat each and every day in order to placate the masses by \u201cmaking it all better\u201d just for a little bit of (\u201cfun\u201d) time. Turn off the TV or go to sleep after the party, and the same problems that people sought to escape from are still there the very next morning and not a damned thing has tangibly changed for the better, except that some people have now found a socially acceptable \u201cgo-to medicine\u201d for dealing with the repulsive reality that they feel they have to put up with each and every day for the rest of their lives. \\nA lot of Americans where I\u2019m from don\u2019t know what a \u201creal vacation\u201d is, in that they don\u2019t go globetrotting around the world like the Europeans do on what they call their \u201cholidays\u201d. Many Midwesterners even have a hard time going from one part of the country to another just for fun because it\u2019s a huge financial burden for the average Clevelander in our cheap and low-wage economy to gather up the funds necessary to jet set out to costly California just to take in some sunshine, for example. Another thing that most foreigners don\u2019t realize is that people from my part of the country don\u2019t even have the vacation/holiday days like the rest of the world does. If you\u2019re working a low-wage service-sector job or are in a low-level office position, then you might never receive two back-to-back weeks of vacation in your life. If you get married, the best that you can dream for is a honeymoon to Niagara Falls for a week and that\u2019s it, just because it\u2019s conveniently nearby and not overly expensive. \\nWe grew up our whole lives hearing from The Establishment and its media shills how \u201cgreat\u201d and \u201cpowerful\u201d the US is, how it\u2019s the \u201cbest country in the history of the world\u201d, yet all that we see around us is socio-economic devastation and we can\u2019t imagine how it could ever be any different. So many factories have closed up shop and moved to Mexico, China, and countries that the average American in my part of the US never heard of or can even pronounce, and it\u2019s all because of the post-Cold War globalization that started under Bill Clinton and NAFTA. But at the same time, however, we see that there are indeed some people around us who seem to be living a pretty good life but haven\u2019t had to do much to achieve it. \\n\\nYou foreigners might be shocked to hear this, but a lot of Clevelanders can\u2019t believe that \u201crefugees\u201d, some minorities, and illegal immigrants are able to live \u2018high off the hog\u2019 as we say just because of the huge amounts of tax-payer-provided government assistance that they receive for not really doing a lot of anything other than being the \u201cpolitically correct\u201d category of people that they are. I don\u2019t expect people outside of the US to understand this, and even many Americans who don\u2019t live in the \u201cRust Belt\u201d (and even some who do) will probably find this to be inconceivable, but so many of these types of folks who I just mentioned \u2013 and including a lot of whites, too \u2013 abuse the \u201cbenefits\u201d system just so that they can get the most amount of free stuff as they can for the absolute least amount of work and effort. \\nIn the \u201cpolitically correct\u201d dystopian society that the \u201cliberal-progressives\u201d and Cultural Marxists of the Democratic Party have strove to create for decades, the state will house, feed, and pay people just because of their race and class, and while this might have been \u201coriginally intended\u201d to temporarily help those who fell on hard times and couldn\u2019t properly help themselves, it has been abused by so many people and turned into a slush fund for paying off loyal leftists who willingly choose to remain indefinitely dependent on The Establishment. These people have made a conscious choice to \u201csettle for less\u201d than they could ever hope to achieve if they worked hard and stayed focused because \u201cThe American Dream\u201d is out of reach for many of them in this part of the country and they figured out how easy it is to scheme the system and have other Americans subsidize the less-than-ideal lifestyles that they\u2019ve settled for. \\nRemember, I\u2019m not asking you guys to agree with any of what I\u2019ve written, but I\u2019m just telling you as a \u201cvoice from the inside\u201d about why so many people in Ohio and the \u201cRust Belt\u201d support Trump and are drawn to his promises to smash The Establishment that they\u2019ve spent their whole lives seeing steal from them, neglect them, and unjustly help others who pledge their loyalty to the existing state of affairs. Don\u2019t forget that it was people who think the way that I just described who decisively changed the course of American history on Election Day, and they take pride in being \u201cpolitically incorrect\u201d and rebelling against the system that they feel has held them down their entire lives. Be it through the abovementioned examples of unfairness and injustice, or through the incessant attempts to dismantle their identity by suppressing and trashing their religious liberties and traditions, people in the \u201cRust Belt\u201d have had enough. \\nSee, that\u2019s the thing that foreigners don\u2019t realize, and it\u2019s that Americans in this part of the country feel that they\u2019re living under the boot of a tyrannical and totalitarian ideology which censors their dissent with \u201cracist\u201d, \u201cfascist\u201d, and \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d reputation-killing accusations and works 24/7/365 to brainwash them into thinking that they \u2013 and not the system \u2013 are the problem. Imagine George Orwell\u2019s 1984 and you\u2019ll have an idea about how a lot people view the ideology of \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d. It is so pervasive, so controlling, that those who are suffering under it were bound to eventually revolt once the time was ripe. All of these anti-\u201cpolitical correctness\u201d dissidents thought that they were alone and were the \u201ccrazy outlier\u201d amongst their brainwashed compatriots, but then Donald Trump came along and gave them all the signal that this was the historic moment that they had been waiting their entire lives for to finally rebel against this totalitarian ideology. If there was no \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d, then there would never have risen a Donald Trump to save the hard-working blue collar folks of the USA. \\nThe majority-blue collar inhabitants of the \u201cRust Belt\u201d have been voiceless for decades and were seething with rage this whole time. They couldn\u2019t speak out against the majority-black crime that ravages their neighborhoods because otherwise they\u2019d be tarred and feathered as \u201cracists\u201d. They couldn\u2019t condemn globalization and the outsourcing of their livelihoods to Mexico, China, and other countries or else they\u2019d be mercilessly attacked as \u201cfascists\u201d. God forbid these people ever spoke publicly about building a wall with Mexico to stop the tens of millions of illegal immigrants and uncountable tons of deadly narcotics that have flooded the US since NAFTA, since then they\u2019d be called the ultimate insult and accused of being \u201cwhite supremacists\u201d. These people thought that they were largely alone with their feelings because the system did such an effective job of self-censoring them and thus separating them from the silent majority of likeminded Americans, but then Donald Trump emerged on the scene and millions of people were finally united via his rallies and social-alternative medias to finally muster up the courage to collectively resist The Establishment and its allied social-pop culture-academic-political elite\u2019s intimidation. \\nWhen Election Day came, these dispossessed Americans didn\u2019t back down and buy into The Establishment\u2019s propaganda that Hillary was going to trounce Trump with an historic landslide but instead went to vote anyhow, knowing that this was the only hope left for them to ever possibly change their inescapably dismal life situations. \\nThe most intense psychological warfare operation ever conducted against Americans was a complete failure. The Establishment\u2019s War on the People sought to convince them that Trump didn\u2019t stand a chance to win and that voting for him just showed how \u201cracist\u201d, \u201cfascist\u201d, and \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d you were. \u201cPolitical correctness\u201d, globalization, and the unfettered illegal immigration and unvetted \u201crefugee\u201d resettlement of millions of people who staunchly refuse to assimilate and integrate into American Society or even speak English is just a fact of life that these \u201cdeplorable\u201d citizens will be forced to put up and deal with until they die (or are killed by some of the \u201cnew arrivals\u201d who flocked into their hometowns). But The Establishment and its social-pop culture-academic-political shills were wrong and Trump supporters knew it because they had finally connected with one another and were convinced that they truly embodied the silent majority, and the frustration, hopelessness, and pain that comes every single day living in a \u201cpolitically correct\u201d system is what sent millions of Americans into a rage against the system which was so widespread that it became impossible for Hillary to steal the election. \\nThe War on the People was waged by Americans, on Americans, and against everything that the silent majority believes that America stands for, which is why it was totally unprecedented in American history. Not even the divide-and-rule Color Revolution tactics that The Establishment dangerously and irresponsibly relied on with the help of George Soros and his \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d urban extremists could succeed in intimidating the Trump Movement and compelling them to stop, which testifies to the deep conviction that Trump supporters have in their beliefs and the hope that they have that their candidate of choice will finally free them from the misery that has come to define their lives. \\nDear foreign friends, forget everything that you may have ever thought about the US system, national ideology, and the American People \u2013 from here on out, you and 99% of all other non-American observers begin at Day 1 in working to understand the inner nuances of Trump Country and Trump\u2019s America. My state of Ohio had the highest honor of being the biggest upset to Hillary Clinton by 9%, something which has shocked The Establishment. We, the people of Ohio, are the heart of Trumpland. He didn\u2019t win by a few percentage points like in every other swing state, but by almost double digits. This should be more than enough proof that everything that I, as a born-and-raised Clevelander, am revealing to you about how and why Trump won the \u201cRust Belt\u201d and broke through Hillary\u2019s firewall. Where I\u2019m from, people don\u2019t just have 1 or 2 Trump signs in their yard \u2013 they have 5, 10, or 20 of them, especially if they live in the farmland right outside of the city. \\nI\u2019m not expecting you to understand everything that I wrote, let alone to agree with it, but I felt obligated to do the best that I can to inform you all about why Trump won and the reasons behind the \u201cRust Belt\u201d revolt against The Establishment which handed him the Presidency. For all of what you might think are their personal and ideological faults, Trump supporters feel validated by this election because it proved that the system and all of its shills were lying about Hillary\u2019s \u201cimminent landslide\u201d this entire time. What had been derided for over a year and a half as the \u201cconspiratorial thinking\u201d of a \u201cvast right-wing conspiracy\u201d (one with phantasmal and invented links to the Russian secret services) was exposed as a fact \u2013 The Establishment was indeed lying this entire time and desperately waged what amounts to the most intense psychological operation against Americans ever conducted in history, and that\u2019s the War on the People. Nobody can deny it any longer, the facts are the facts and all the \u201cofficial\u201d \u201cthinkers\u201d, pundits, and \u201cexperts\u201d were wrong because they either deliberately refused to recognize the reality that was before their eyes or were complicit in siding with the system out of the self-interested expectation that they\u2019ll somehow end up benefiting from its perpetuation. \\nTough times are ahead, and the nation is more divided and polarized than ever before, though this is largely due to the lingering psychological effects of The Establishment\u2019s War on the People than anything else. The Second American Revolution was indeed a victory of the American People over The Establishment, but it\u2019s now under threat from the Clintonian Counter-Revolution that\u2019s broken out in the streets of many pro-Democrat American cities. It\u2019s the height of irony that the people who just a few days ago criticized Trump for not pledging to blindly respect the results of the vote are now the ones who don\u2019t recognize its outcome and are poised to tear America\u2019s inner cities apart just because they couldn\u2019t pull off stealing the election of our lifetime. \\nI don\u2019t think anybody knows how far the rioters will be directed/misled by their Hillary-Soros-neoconservative handlers to go, nor how President-elect Trump will respond to their unrest once he takes office in mid-January, but what I can in fact tell each and every one of you without an inkling of doubt in my mind is that the Trump supporters of the Midwestern \u201cRust Belt\u201d who helped hand him his victory in the first place will form the vanguard Second Amendment-wielding citizens leading the Reverse-Color Revolution movement to legally safeguard the 45th President\u2019s constitutional legitimacy if things disastrously get out of control.
