The nephew of Sigmund Freud, the pioneer of psycho-analysis, it was Bernays who coined the term \\x93public relations\\x94 as a euphemism for spin and its deceptions.\\nIn 1929, he persuaded feminists to promote cigarettes for women by smoking in the New York Easter Parade \\x96 behaviour then considered outlandish. One feminist, Ruth Booth, declared, \\x93Women! Light another torch of freedom! Fight another sex taboo!\\x94 Bernays\\x92 influence extended far beyond advertising. His greatest success was his role in convincing the American public to join the slaughter of the First World War.\\nThe secret, he said, was \\x93engineering the consent\\x94 of people in order to \\x93control and regiment [them] according to our will without their knowing about it\\x94.\\nHe described this as \\x93the true ruling power in our society\\x94 and called it an \\x93invisible government\\x94.\\nToday, the invisible government has never been more powerful and less understood. In my career as a journalist and film-maker, I have never known propaganda to insinuate our lives and as it does now and to go unchallenged.\\nImagine two cities. Both are under siege by the forces of the government of that country. Both cities are occupied by fanatics, who commit terrible atrocities, such as beheading people. But there is a vital difference. In one siege, the government soldiers are described as liberators by Western reporters embedded with them, who enthusiastically report their battles and air strikes. There are front page pictures of these heroic soldiers giving a V-sign for victory. There is scant mention of civilian casualties.\\nIn the second city \\x96 in another country nearby \\x96 almost exactly the same is happening. Government forces are laying siege to a city controlled by the same breed of fanatics. The difference is that these fanatics are supported, supplied and armed by \\x93us\\x94 \\x96 by the United States and Britain. They even have a media centre that is funded by Britain and America. Another difference is that the government soldiers laying siege to this city are the bad guys, condemned for assaulting and bombing the city \\x96 which is exactly what the good soldiers do in the first city.\\nConfusing? Not really. Such is the basic double standard that is the essence of propaganda. I am referring, of course, to the current siege of the city of Mosul by the government forces of Iraq, who are backed by the United States and Britain and to the siege of Aleppo by the government forces of Syria, backed by Russia. One is good; the other is bad.\\nWhat is seldom reported is that both cities would not be occupied by fanatics and ravaged by war if Britain and the United States had not invaded Iraq in 2003. That criminal enterprise was launched on lies strikingly similar to the propaganda that now distorts our understanding of the civil war in Syria. Without this drumbeat of propaganda dressed up as news, the monstrous ISIS and Al-Qaida and al-Nusra and the rest of the jihadist gang might not exist, and the people of Syria might not be fighting for their lives today.\\nSome may remember in 2003 a succession of BBC reporters turning to the camera and telling us that Blair was \\x93vindicated\\x94 for what turned out to be the crime of the century. The US television networks produced the same validation for George W. Bush. Fox News brought on Henry Kissinger to effuse over Colin Powell\\x92s fabrications. The same year, soon after the invasion, I filmed an interview in Washington with Charles Lewis, the renowned American investigative journalist. I asked him, \\x93What would have happened if the freest media in the world had seriously challenged what turned out to be crude propaganda?\\x94\\nHe replied that if journalists had done their job, \\x93there is a very, very good chance we would not have gone to war in Iraq\\x94.\\nIt was a shocking statement, and one supported by other famous journalists to whom I put the same question \\x97 Dan Rather of CBS, David Rose of the Observer and journalists and producers in the BBC, who wished to remain anonymous. In other words, had journalists done their job, had they challenged and investigated the propaganda instead of amplifying it, hundreds of thousands of men, women and children would be alive today, and there would be no ISIS and no siege of Aleppo or Mosul. There would have been no atrocity on the London Underground on 7 th July 2005. There would have been no flight of millions of refugees; there would be no miserable camps.\\nWhen the terrorist atrocity happened in Paris last November, President Francoi Hollande immediately sent planes to bomb Syria \\x96 and more terrorism followed, predictably, the product of Hollande\\x92s bombast about France being \\x93at war\\x94 and \\x93showing no mercy\\x94. That state violence and jihadist violence feed off each other is the truth that no national leader has the courage to speak.\\n\\x93When the truth is replaced by silence,\\x94 said the Soviet dissident Yevtushenko, \\x93the silence is a lie.\\x94\\nThe attack on Iraq, the attack on Libya, the attack on Syria happened because the leader in each of these countries was not a puppet of the West. The human rights record of a Saddam or a Gaddafi was irrelevant. They did not obey orders and surrender control of their country.\\nThe same fate awaited Slobodan Milosevic once he had refused to sign an \\x93agreement\\x94 that demanded the occupation of Serbia and its conversion to a market economy. His people were bombed, and he was prosecuted in The Hague. Independence of this kind is intolerable. As WikLeaks has revealed, it was only when the Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad in 2009 rejected an oil pipeline, running through his country from Qatar to Europe, that he was attacked.\\nFrom that moment, the CIA planned to destroy the government of Syria with jihadist fanatics \\x96 the same fanatics currently holding the people of Mosul and eastern Aleppo hostage. Why is this not news? The former British Foreign Office official Carne Ross, who was responsible for operating sanctions against Iraq, told me: \\x93We would feed journalists factoids of sanitised intelligence, or we would freeze them out. That is how it worked.\\x94\\nThe West\\x92s medieval client, Saudi Arabia \\x96 to which the US and Britain sell billions of dollars\\x92 worth of arms \\x96 is at present destroying Yemen, a country so poor that in the best of times, half the children are malnourished. Look on YouTube and you will see the kind of massive bombs \\x96 \\x93our\\x94 bombs \\x96 that the Saudis use against dirt-poor villages, and against weddings, and funerals. The explosions look like small atomic bombs. The bomb aimers in Saudi Arabia work side-by-side with British officers. This fact is not on the evening news.\\nPropaganda is most effective when our consent is engineered by those with a fine education \\x96 Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard, Columbia \\x97 and with careers on the BBC, the Guardia n, the New York Times , the Washington Post . These organisations are known as the liberal media. They present themselves as enlightened, progressive tribunes of the moral zeitgeist. They are anti-racist, pro-feminist and pro-LGBT.\\nAnd they love war.\\nWhile they speak up for feminism, they support rapacious wars that deny the rights of countless women, including the right to life. In 2011, Libya, then a modern state, was destroyed on the pretext that Muammar Gaddafi was about to commit genocide on his own people. That was the incessant news; and there was no evidence. It was a lie.\\nIn fact, Britain, Europe and the United States wanted what they like to call \\x93regime change\\x94 in Libya, the biggest oil producer in Africa. Gaddafi\\x92s influence in the continent and, above all, his independence were intolerable. So he was murdered with a knife in his rear by fanatics, backed by America, Britain and France. Hillary Clinton cheered his gruesome death for the camera, declaring, \\x93We came, we saw, he died!\\x94\\nThe destruction of Libya was a media triumph. As the war drums were beaten, Jonathan Freedland wrote in the Guardian : \\x93Though the risks are very real, the case for intervention remains strong.\\x94 Intervention \\x97 what a polite, benign, Guardian word, whose real meaning, for Libya, was death and destruction.\\nAccording to its own records, Nato launched 9,700 \\x93strike sorties\\x94 against Libya, of which more than a third were aimed at civilian targets. They included missiles with uranium warheads. Look at the photographs of the rubble of Misurata and Sirte, and the mass graves identified by the Red Cross. The Unicef report on the children killed says, \\x93most [of them] under the age of ten\\x94. As a direct consequence, Sirte became the capital of ISIS.\\nUkraine is another media triumph. Respectable liberal newspapers such as the New York Times , the Washington Post and the Guardian , and mainstream broadcasters such as the BBC, NBC, CBS, CNN have played a critical role in conditioning their viewers to accept a new and dangerous cold war. All have misrepresented events in Ukraine as a malign act by Russia when, in fact, the coup in Ukraine in 2014 was the work of the United States, aided by Germany and Nato.\\n This inversion of reality is so pervasive that Washington\\x92s military intimidation of Russia is not news; it is suppressed behind a smear and scare campaign of the kind I grew up withduring the first cold war. Once again, the Ruskies are coming to get us, led by another Stalin, whom The Economist depicts as the devil.\\nThe suppression of the truth about Ukraine is one of the most complete news blackouts I can remember. The fascists who engineered the coup in Kiev are the same breed that backed the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Of all the scares about the rise of fascist anti-Semitism in Europe, no leader ever mentions the fascists in Ukraine \\x96 except Vladimir Putin, but he does not count.\\nMany in the Western media have worked hard to present the ethnic Russian-speaking population of Ukraine as outsiders in their own country, as agents of Moscow, almost never as Ukrainians seeking a federation within Ukraine and as Ukrainian citizens resisting a foreign-orchestrated coup against their elected government.\\nThere is almost the joie d\\x92esprit of a class reunion of warmongers. The drum-beaters of the Washington Post inciting war with Russia are the very same editorial writers who published the lie that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.\\n To most of us, the American presidential campaign is a media freak show, in which Donald Trump is the arch villain. But Trump is loathed by those with power in the United States for reasons that have little to do with his obnoxious behaviour and opinions. To the invisible government in Washington, the unpredictable Trump is an obstacle to America\\x92s design for the 21 st century.\\nThis is to maintain the dominance of the United States and to subjugate Russia, and, if possible, China.\\nTo the militarists in Washington, the real problem with Trump is that, in his lucid moments, he seems not to want a war with Russia; he wants to talk with the Russian president, not fight him; he says he wants to talk with the president of China. In the first debate with Hillary Clinton, Trump promised not to be the first to introduce nuclear weapons into a conflict. He said, \\x93I would certainly not do first strike. Once the nuclear alternative happens, it\\x92s over.\\x94 That was not news.\\nDid he really mean it? Who knows? He often contradicts himself. But what is clear is that Trump is considered a serious threat to the status quo maintained by the vast national security machine that runs the United States, regardless of who is in the White House. The CIA wants him beaten. The Pentagon wants him beaten. The media wants him beaten. Even his own party wants him beaten. He is a threat to the rulers of the world \\x96 unlike Clinton who has left no doubt she is prepared to go to war with nuclear-armed Russia and China.\\nClinton has the form, as she often boasts. Indeed, her record is proven. As a senator, she backed the bloodbath in Iraq. When she ran against Obama in 2008, she threatened to \\x93totally obliterate\\x94 Iran. As Secretary of State, she colluded in the destruction of governments in Libya and Honduras and set in train the baiting of China. She has now pledged to support a No Fly Zone in Syria \\x97 a direct provocation for war with Russia. Clinton may well become the most dangerous president of the United States in my lifetime \\x96a distinction for which the competition is fierce.\\nWithout a shred of evidence, she has accused Russia of supporting Trump and hacking her emails. Released by WikiLeaks, these emails tell us that what Clinton says in private, in speeches to the rich and powerful, is the opposite of what she says in public. That is why silencing and threatening Julian Assange is so important. As the editor of WikiLeaks, Assange knows the truth. And let me assure those who are concerned, he is well, and WikiLeaks is operating on all cylinders.\\nToday, the greatest build-up of American-led forces since World War Two is under way \\x96 in the Caucasus and eastern Europe, on the border with Russia, and in Asia and the Pacific, where China is the target. Keep that in mind when the presidential election circus reaches its finale on November 8 th, If the winner is Clinton, a Greek chorus of witless commentators will celebrate her coronation as a great step forward for women. None will mention Clinton\\x92s victims: the women of Syria, the women of Iraq, the women of Libya. None will mention the civil defence drills being conducted in Russia. None will recall Edward Bernays\\x92 \\x93torches of freedom\\x94.\\nGeorge Bush\\x92s press spokesman once called the media \\x93complicit enablers\\x94.\\nComing from a senior official in an administration whose lies, enabled by the media, caused such suffering, that description is a warning from history.\\nIn 1946, the Nuremberg Tribunal prosecutor said of the German media: \\x93Before every major aggression, they initiated a press campaign calculated to weaken their victims and to prepare the German people psychologically for the attack. In the propaganda system, it was the daily press and the radio that were the most important weapons.\\x94\\n This text is adapted from an address to the Sheffield Festival of Words, Sheffield, England , On 27 October 2016. http://johnpilger.com'"}, "time": 1742563142.6029658}
