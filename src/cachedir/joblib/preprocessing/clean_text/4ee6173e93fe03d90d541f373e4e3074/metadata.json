Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week With George Stephanopoulos,\u201d while discussing former FBI Director James Comey testifying to Congress next week, Trump critic and National Review senior editor Jonah Goldberg said, \u201cIf it\u2019s a contest between James Comey\u2019s credibility and Donald Trump\u2019s credibility,\u201d Comey wins \u201c10 out of 10 times. \u201d  Goldberg said, \u201cI know. But I mean, everything in Washington is sort of a hot mess right now. And I think that, you know, the fact that the Trump White House couldn\u2019t give anybody to come on here and talk about terrorism is a sign of the disarray that they\u2019re in. \u201d He continued, \u201cAnyway, so their actual attack mode, I think all it does is please the people who are already in Donald Trump\u2019s column. And if it\u2019s a contest between James Comey\u2019s credibility and Donald Trump\u2019s, I think Comey\u2019s brand wins that, you know, 10 out of 10 times. \u201d Follow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742628337.5519388}
