{"duration": 0.0992128849029541, "input_args": {"text": "'Around this time last year, when Kanye West was griping about the Grammys, he took to Twitter and asked, incredulously, \u201cHas anyone at the Grammys ever heard March Madness? ??\u201d That would be one of several hits by Future, who in a spectacular run beginning in late 2014 and lasting through the end of 2015, released a cluster of outstanding mixtapes and albums that somehow landed out of the reach of mainstream awareness, even as they set the agenda, again and again, within  . That Future wouldn\u2019t be lauded by the Grammys  \u2014   the same thing happened this year, for what it\u2019s worth  \u2014   reflects his precarious relationship to the old   establishment (loosely welcome, but held at arm\u2019s length) as well as the way the new   establishment has little need for the old rule makers, either within the genre or outside. Whether he\u2019s accepted or not, Future persists. He\u2019s perhaps the only rapper working who has successfully mimicked the samizdat, sub rosa feel of the mixtape era and parlayed it into a sustainable   career. He is both ubiquitous and obscure, a cipher who pops up in the most unexpected places. He is always on the horizon, and always in the shadows. Accordingly, he\u2019s put out a pair of new albums in quick succession: \u201cFuture,\u201d which was released two weeks ago and topped the Billboard album chart, and \u201cHndrxx,\u201d which followed last week and is expected to topple its predecessor. (If that happens, he will become the first artist in Billboard history to pull off that feat.) This rainstorm of music is purposeful  \u2014   as much as any aesthetic choice, excess is Future\u2019s art. Most artists try their best to skip from peak to peak, knowing that the valleys in between can be deep and unforgiving. But Future\u2019s consistency has tremendous value  \u2014   he\u2019s as much high plateau as peak, and better off for it. As has become clear over the past three years, Future is telling one long, wide, deep story, rather than dozens of discrete ones. His boasts are built with creatine, his voice soaked in acid. He\u2019s a cryptic storyteller, in so much as his stories have beginnings, middles or ends. Typically, he strings together a few fragments with wild impact, covering the same thin topical range. A good example is the intro of \u201cHallucinating\u201d: \u201cI seduce you with this Aston Martin I bought   you done did more drugs than me? You must be hallucinating. \u201d He\u2019s not preoccupied with crafting songs  \u2014   though when he relaxes, he makes some of the most thrilling ones. Rather, he is submerged in a lifestyle, and his lyrics are quick, impressionistic smears. Taken in sum, his music verges on ambient, a   sound without edges or direction. In this way, Future is surprisingly   to the album format  \u2014   he\u2019s best consumed in wide gulps. Others use albums to shape coherent narratives for Future, they\u2019re meant as floods. Total absorption is the thing. Most striking is how \u201cFuture\u201d and \u201cHndrxx\u201d tell two different stories while feeling like part of the same formless narrative. \u201cFuture\u201d is closer to his earlier work, with barked brags (the excellent \u201cSuper Trapper\u201d) and ruminative   that veers toward the psychedelic (\u201cI don\u2019t ever walk on   float off Earth, always float off Earth\u201d). Antagonism is here, too: There\u2019s a song called \u201cPOA,\u201d as in power of attorney, as in what kind of life must you be living that legal terminology is so close to the fore of your creativity? The final two songs on \u201cFuture\u201d  \u2014   \u201cWhen I Was Broke\u201d and \u201cFeds Did a Sweep\u201d  \u2014   strike a tone of deep melancholy that\u2019s picked up on \u201cHndrxx\u201d and used as a foundation. \u201cHndrxx\u201d is almost wholly devoted to affairs of the heart  \u2014   how his is fragile, and how he treats others\u2019 carelessly. Several songs are strikingly personal, seemingly inspired by his publicly troubled relationship with the RB singer Ciara, with whom he has a son. \u201cI told you from the start you was gonna turn on me,\u201d he sings at the beginning of \u201cTurn on Me,\u201d then castigates himself for the relationship\u2019s mistakes and its fallout: On both albums, the reference points are the same  \u2014   glistening, wet diamonds Range Rovers purchased with pocket money women from all parts of the globe getting celebrated and mistreated, often in the same breath. Because these albums are best taken in their totality, it doesn\u2019t quite matter if there are duds sprinkled throughout, and of course there are. Instead, it\u2019s more revealing to focus on the technical rules Future revises, or ignores: He long ago melted the line between singing and rapping, but sometimes, he changes the rhyming syllable   as if he\u2019s forgotten, or doesn\u2019t care he raps in abstracted fragments and yet manages to sing a heartfelt duet with Rihanna (\u201cSelfish\u201d). The ocean is far more important than any one wave. On both albums, the rapping is more literal and direct than it has been in recent years  \u2014   the enunciation is stronger (and therefore less intriguing) and often he\u2019s emphasizing the final syllable in each line as a way of planting a flag. That directness hasn\u2019t always been central to his work, but it\u2019s reflective of the slightly more exalted position he holds in pop right now, a level of success where he\u2019s guesting on Ariana Grande and Maroon 5 songs (which come as slightly less of a shock than when he teamed up with the early adopter Miley Cyrus a few years ago). One of the upsides of releasing so much music is that it\u2019s easier to hide an occasional bizarre misstep. But even if Future continues to flirt with pop attention, it\u2019s unlikely to be his dominant narrative. He\u2019s more a state of mind than a set of songs. \u201cFuture\u201d and \u201cHndrxx,\u201d though very good, aren\u2019t his best work, but they\u2019re part of a story that\u2019s still unfolding. Whether anyone\u2019s listening or not, the Future story has no end.'"}, "time": 1742562157.0010273}
