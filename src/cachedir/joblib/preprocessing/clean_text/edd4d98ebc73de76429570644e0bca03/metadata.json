A day after his secretive chief strategist laid out a   new definition of conservatism animated by attacks on \u201cthe administrative state,\u201d globalism and the \u201ccorporatist media,\u201d Mr. Trump delivered a visceral gut punch of a speech that executed almost all of the tactics that define the   philosophy of the   West Wing. Speaking to the Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday, Mr. Trump launched what was easily the most blistering attack on the media and corporate elites of his already bellicose and eventful presidency. His speech also included a promise to throw undocumented immigrants \u201cthe hell out of the country\u201d and a recitation of his    campaign promises. It represented a   friendly takeover of CPAC, an establishment Republican group whose leadership once viewed the party\u2019s surprise   as a noisy interloper. Mr. Bannon, the former Breitbart chief executive who has a hand in nearly every scripted public Trump utterance, had expressed a similar sentiment at the conference the day before. \u201cIf you think they\u2019re going to give you your country back without a fight, you are sadly mistaken,\u201d he said during an appearance with Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff. \u201cEvery day, it is going to be a fight. \u201d His onstage discussion, it turned out, was a   preview of Mr. Trump\u2019s populist broadsides, with an admonition to anyone who continues to underestimate the determination of the Trump White House to disrupt the Washington establishment. Mr. Trump\u2019s less restrained approach energized CPAC attendees who had once viewed the     as a   celebrity curiosity  \u2014   they serenaded him with chants of \u201cTrump\u201d and \u201cU. S. A. \u201d And his message is resonating with Republican voters, over 80 percent of whom approve of his job performance, despite historically low levels of support among all voters. But Mr. Trump is intensifying his assault on his enemies on the eve of his first national address before a joint session of Congress, a time when most new presidents are moving in the opposite direction, pivoting from martial campaign rhetoric to the more positive, inclusive language of governance needed to build the coalition necessary to pass major legislation. On an operational level, Mr. Trump\u2019s inexperienced but confident White House staff members  \u2014   dominated by Mr. Bannon  \u2014   are leaning on Hill Republicans to draft tax overhaul measures and a replacement bill for the Affordable Care Act. In the meantime, they have focused on enacting a series of   executive orders, an approach often adopted by presidents at the end of their terms when their legislative leverage has been exhausted. As they did during the campaign, Mr. Trump and Mr. Bannon believe they are tapping into an American public less interested in the standard optimistic tropes of presidential politics and more interested in someone who speaks truth to their anxieties. Moreover, aides to Mr. Trump say he fares best when he\u2019s able to target  \u2014   and nickname  \u2014   an opponent, whether it is \u201cLittle Marco\u201d Rubio, \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d Clinton or the \u201cFake News\u201d media. Mr. Bannon, bookish and prone to surrounding himself with   young acolytes, previewed Mr. Trump\u2019s   during the Thursday session. \u201cThey\u2019re corporatist, globalist media that are adamantly opposed  \u2014   adamantly opposed to an economic nationalist agenda like Donald Trump has,\u201d he said. \u201cI think if you look at the opposition party and how they portray the campaign, how they portrayed the transition and now they\u2019re portraying the administration, it\u2019s always wrong. \u201d The attacks on the news media come at a time when the press has been reporting on the Trump campaign\u2019s apparent connections to Russia, the botched rollout of Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration and the forced resignation of Michael T. Flynn, the national security adviser, after less than a month on the job. \u201cThey\u2019re very smart, they\u2019re very cunning and they\u2019re very dishonest,\u201d Mr. Trump said on a day when his press secretary scrapped his daily briefing for an     gaggle for selected reporters. The move, people familiar with the situation said, was enthusiastically backed by Mr. Bannon. The symbiotic political and personal relationship between the two men  \u2014   the rumpled   and the compulsively public and   president  \u2014   is driving much of the momentum and dysfunction of the White House, aides say. For all his talk of creating a blueprint for a Trumpian conservatism that outlasts the president\u2019s career, Mr. Bannon is not regarded as a   manager, and he let slip during his CPAC appearance that things in the White House have gone well  \u2014   but only \u201cto the degree we were planning\u201d them. There is not a lot of daylight between Mr. Trump and Mr. Bannon on the issues, although the president often jokes that Mr. Bannon\u2019s economic populist agenda makes it hard to tell if the former Naval officer and Goldman Sachs executive is \u201c  or \u201d according to a Trump associate friendly with both. The biggest difference between the president and his chief strategist is that Mr. Trump is far less constrained by the dictates of any single philosophy  \u2014   even Mr. Bannon\u2019s vision of Trumpism  \u2014   than Mr. Bannon, who sees history as a succession of movements and power struggles. And while Mr. Bannon described the president as \u201cmaniacally focused\u201d on fulfilling his campaign promises, Mr. Trump often loses focus, as he did during numerous digressions from his scripted remarks on Friday. He unleashed the latest in a succession of surprise rhetorical attacks on longstanding American allies, extemporizing about a friend named Jim who had told him to avoid the \u201cCity of Lights\u201d because after several terrorist attacks, \u201cParis is no longer Paris. \u201d Clearly reveling in the adulation of a room that had once been hard to win, the president alternated between a theme of dark days  \u2014   once again singling out violence on the streets of Chicago  \u2014   and light comedy. Speaking of a meeting with business leaders this week that included food producers, he quipped, \u201cI like Campbell\u2019s soup. \u201d He also joked about his first appearance at this annual conservative conclave. \u201cIf you remember, it was my first major speech. They said he didn\u2019t get a standing ovation  \u2014   because everybody stood,\u201d Mr. Trump said of the speech, in 2011. \u201cI had very little notes and even less preparation,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then you leave, and everybody is thrilled, and I say, \u2018I like this business. \u2019\u201d'"}, "time": 1742563976.5203595}
