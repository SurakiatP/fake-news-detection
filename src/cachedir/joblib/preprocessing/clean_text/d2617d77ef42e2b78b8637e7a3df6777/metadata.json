So, I would depend on this investigation that we\u2019re talking about, that would bring forward any criminal activity, and, of course, has the right and the ability to charge people, select targets, look at them, bring about an indictment. And so, it\u2019s a very big investigation, and I think somebody that\u2019s as sophisticated as Bob Mueller is really the one to carry it out and see that it does not go awry, it does not overeach, but it\u2019s what it should be. \u201d Blitzer followed up, \u201c[S]o far, you have not seen any evidence of collusion, is that right?\u201d Feinstein responded, \u201cWell, evidence that would establish that there\u2019s collusion. There are all kinds of rumors around. there are newspaper stories, but that\u2019s not necessarily evidence. And so, you\u2019ve got the Intelligence Committee looking at it, and you will have the Mueller investigation going on, and it\u2019s the Mueller investigation that would bring forward solid evidence on which you could base a criminal case and indict someone. \u201d (  Grabien) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742561786.3382971}
