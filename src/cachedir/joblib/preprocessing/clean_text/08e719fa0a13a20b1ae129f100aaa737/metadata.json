Here\u2019s what you need to know: \u2022 Israel said  it would move ahead with thousands of new homes in East Jerusalem, undeterred by the United Nations Security Council\u2019s vote last week to condemn its settlement construction. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has curbed diplomatic contacts with Security Council countries, said \u201cwe do not turn the other cheek. \u201d The Israeli right is pushing Mr. Netanyahu to abandon the idea of a Palestinian state alongside Israel. _____ \u2022 Russia is cultivating an array of   extremist groups across Europe in an effort to destabilize or simply disorient the European Union.

Our reporter went on an Air Force jet that hunts for Islamic State targets in Syria. _____ \u2022 We also visited Diyarbakir, the informal Kurdish capital in Turkey, where resentment against the state lingers after fighting this year and recent moves to curb Kurdish power. Asylum applications from Turkey in Germany tripled this year, as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s crackdown continues after a failed coup in July.

Trump has said that he is formulating plans to extricate himself from his family\u2019s business. Yet an examination of the company shows what a complex task that would be. President Obama said he would have defeated Mr. Trump had he run for a third term (which the Constitution does not permit). \u201cNO WAY!\u201d the   responded on Twitter. _____ \u2022 \u201cI don\u2019t want to be another clich\u00e9. \u201d The death of the pop superstar George Michael stunned both fans and the many people who knew him in England, where he spent most of his life. Mr. Michael \u201csang about wanting to be free often enough to make you wonder whether he thought any freedom was ever attainable,\u201d our critic writes. _____ \u2022 The European Medicines Agency is likely to leave Britain  \u2014   another casualty of the vote to leave the European Union, and one with worrying implications for the country\u2019s vibrant biotech and pharmaceuticals sector. \u2022 The troubled Italian lender  Monte dei Paschi di Siena has a capital shortfall of 8. 8 billion euros, higher than previously estimated, the European Central Bank said. \u2022 The year\u2019s best apps.

Moscow said it considered it unlikely that terrorism caused the crash.

S. was the world\u2019s leader in weapons sales last year, accounting for half of the entire global market. France was second.

[Associated Press] \u2022 In just over 49 days,  Thomas Coville, a Frenchman, sailed around the world alone. French officials call it a world record. [Associated Press] \u2022 In Catalonia,  people climb on top of one another to create towers called castells, sometimes up to 10 tiers high.

There\u2019s just one snag: It is all but unknown in Germany. Christmas is over, but reminders of the holiday are most likely scattered around your home and office, or perhaps hiding inside a coat pocket. We\u2019re talking about candy canes, whose ubiquity is matched by the legends surrounding their creation. One tale dates the candy to 1670, when a choirmaster at a cathedral in Cologne, Germany, needed a way to keep children entertained during long Christmas services. He asked a local confectioner to bend hard candy into the shape of a shepherd\u2019s cane. About 200 years later, a   immigrant is said to have brought the tradition to America, decorating his Christmas tree with the canes, which were all white. In 1920, a Georgia candy maker developed a way to   colors into the canes, giving them their traditional red and white look, according to one account. The sweets were already popular then, and today they are part of a seasonal candy juggernaut that rakes in over $7 billion a year, according to an industry trade group. So what to do with the extra peppermint sticks? Perhaps crush them to use on ice cream or cookies. Or save them: Not only has the candy been around for centuries, it can last up to three years.
