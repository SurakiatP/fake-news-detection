At last Americans can \u2018grab pussies\u2019 with impunity and give global warming the chance it deserves. \\nWith a sympathetic House and Supreme Court, Trump looks set to secure his vision of a gun in every cereal box, deporting California and \u2018waterboarding for fun\u2019. The US itself will naturally be rebranded as \u2018Trump States\u2122\u2019; with a topless golf resort covering most of the mid-west. This will be followed by criminal charges against Hilary Clinton, Megan \u2018Fox\u2019 Kelly and all menstruators refusing to compete in his compulsory swimwear contest. \\nTrump promised to unify a deeply divided country by imprisoning all pollsters \u2013 a decision warmly greeted by a confused electorate. In his first few days he is expected to repeal Obama-care, replacing it with the less socially inclusive \u2018Who Cares?\u2019 He will also eliminate debt, cut taxes and increase military spending \u2013 by simply redefining basic arithmetic. \\nWith Brexit now a dumb and distant memory, US voters confirmed that there is something worse than an Adam Sandler movie. Many await to see if Trump will keep his grandiose promises \u2013 such as free Trump-Steak for all, an end to billionaire-shaming and his long term commitment to \u2018teabaging\u2019 the Chinese President.
