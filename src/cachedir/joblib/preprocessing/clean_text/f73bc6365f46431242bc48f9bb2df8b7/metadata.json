The incident has reportedly   talks surrounding the use of gender pronouns, particularly in a city seen as the bastion of liberalism and progressive   in America. Emile Inman, 27, was reportedly found dead in her home this past January after allegedly being stabbed by Gomez, Jr. Another woman, Kiana Schmitt, 24, was rushed to the hospital after Gomez allegedly stabbed her hours earlier. However, Berkeleyside, which first reported on Gomez\u2019s pronoun preference, began referring to the   campus activists as \u201cthey\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d once the publication learned of that preference from one of his friends. Berkeleyside updated its January 6 article to read, \u201cAccording to Gomez Jr. \u2019s Facebook page, they are a UC Berkeley student who lives in Berkeley. [A friend contacted Berkeleyside after publication to say that Gomez Jr. uses the pronoun \u201cthey. \u201d This story has been updated. ]\u201d Popular conservative columnist Ann Coulter reacted to Berkeleyside\u2019s decision to satisfy the murderer\u2019s pronoun request over social media: Berkeley student arrested https:  . .

Breitbart. com and other conservative political websites picked up the story. \u201d Breitbart\u2019s article can be found here. Frances Dinkelspiel,   of Berkeleyside, told Heat Street, \u201cWe decided to use \u2018they\u2019 for Pablo Gomez Jr because that is Gomez\u2019s preferred gender pronoun. It\u2019s as simple as that. We have used \u2018they\u2019 in other stories about    people. \u201d Similarly, Heat Street pointed out that Andrea Platten, managing editor of the Daily Californian, also adopted \u201cthey\u201d as a singular pronoun at the publication last February. \u201cWe believe that any person\u2019s preferred pronoun should be honored, regardless of whether they are accused of committing a crime,\u201d Platten told Heat Street. Not everyone agreed that Gomez should have the right to decide which pronoun is used to describe him. \u201cI think you give away your right to make a demand like that when you are arrested for killing somebody,\u201d UC Berkeley junior and College Republicans member Jonothan Chow told the AP.
