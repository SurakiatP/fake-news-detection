[In an interview Saturday at the Tribeca Film Festival, the    singer and actress said she was snubbed by Academy voters for her directorial efforts on Yentl and The Prince of Tides because   Academy voters did not want to see a \u201cwoman director. \u201d  \u201cThere were a lot of older people. They don\u2019t want to see a woman director,\u201d Streisand told director Robert Rodriguez at the festival on Saturday, according to Variety. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many women wanted to see a woman director. \u201d 1983\u2019s Yentl, about a Jewish woman (Streisand) who dresses as a man so she can study Torah in a yeshiva  \u2014   was nominated for five Oscars and won one, for Best Original Score. 1991\u2019s The Prince of Tides  \u2014   in which she also starred as a New York therapist who becomes unwillingly involved in a client\u2019s messy personal life  \u2014   was nominated for seven Oscars, including Best Picture for Streisand, but came away  . According to Variety, Streisand appeared to still be bothered by a 1983 review of Yentl by New York Times critic Janet Maslin, who wrote, among other things, that the film used a \u201c  designer yarmulke. \u201d \u201cNone of [the female critics] talked about what the movie was trying to say,\u201d Streisand told Rodriguez, according to the outlet. \u201cIt was not about what the movie was about  \u2014   a celebration of women and all they could be. \u201d When Rodriguez told Streisand that she had paved the way for contemporary female directors, including The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty helmer Kathryn Bigelow, Streisand disagreed. \u201cNot enough women are directing now,\u201d she said. \u201cI love when I see a woman\u2019s name on the film, and then I want to see it be good. \u201d Streisand  \u2014   who has also won ten Grammys, nine Golden Globes, five Emmys, a Tony award, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom  \u2014   spoke out against rampant sexism in an interview with WNYC Wednesday, telling the outlet\u2019s Leonard Lopate that misogyny cost former Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton the White House. \u201cWomen are still so underestimated it\u2019s incredible to watch even this last election with Hillary, the kind of strong woman, the powerful woman, the educated woman, the experienced woman, being thought of as the other, or too elite, or too educated,\u201d Streisand said then, adding: \u201cStrong women have always been suspect in this country. \u201d   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum'"}, "time": 1742563687.1893704}
