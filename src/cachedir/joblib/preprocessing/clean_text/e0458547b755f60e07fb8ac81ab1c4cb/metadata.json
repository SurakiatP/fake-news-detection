Comey testified about why the intelligence community purportedly believed that Russia favored Donald Trump for U. S. president over Hillary Clinton. [Comey confirmed that the basis for the intelligence community\u2019s assessment that Russian President Vladimir Putin allegedly wanted Trump in office was not because the billionaire was, as Sen. Al Franken claimed without citing any evidence, \u201censnared in\u201d Russia\u2019s \u201cweb of patronage. \u201d  Instead, the FBI chief provided two primary reasons for Russia allegedly favoring Trump over Clinton during the 2016 presidential race. One reason, according to Comey, was that Putin \u201chated\u201d Clinton and would have favored any Republican opponent. The second reason, Comey explained, was that Putin made an assessment that it would be easier to make a deal with a businessman than someone from the political class. Comey\u2019s statements provide a rare window into the intelligence community\u2019s assessments about Russia and Trump. The comments are a far cry from the conspiracies alleging Putin held blackmail information over the billionaire.  In fact, in the exchange, Comey refused to lend any weight to those claims. Those conspiracies were fueled by a controversial   dossier alleging collusion between Russia and Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. The dossier contains wild and unproven claims about Trump and sordid sexual acts, including the   claim that Trump hired prostitutes and had them urinate on a hotel room bed. In today\u2019s exchange, Franken stated that \u201cthe FBI, CIA and the NSA all concluded that Russia did in fact interfere in the 2016 election in order to, quote, help   Trump\u2019s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton. And the agencies concluded that the Russians had a clear preference for President Trump. \u201d Franken asked, \u201cWhat is your assessment of why the Russian government had a clear preference for President Trump?\u201d Comey replied: The intelligence communities\u2019 assessment had a couple of parts with respect to that. One is he wasn\u2019t Hillary Clinton, who Putin hated and wanted to harm in any possible way, and so he was her opponent, so necessarily they supported him. And then also this second notion that the intelligence community assessed that Putin believed he would be more able to make deals, reach agreements with someone with a business background than with someone who\u2019d grown up in more of a government environment. Not satisfied with Comey\u2019s response, Franken further probed whether the intelligence community believed Russia wanted Trump in office because of Trump\u2019s business interests, claiming that Trump \u201chad already been ensnared in their web of patronage. \u201d Franken asked: OK, well, I\u2019m curious about just how closely Russia followed the Kremlin playbook when it meld (ph) in our democracy, specifically whether the Russians had a preference for President Trump because he had already been ensnared in their web of patronage  \u2014   web of patronage is a quote from the report. Is it possible that in the Russian\u2019s views  \u2014   view Trump\u2019s business interests would make him more amenable to cooperating with them, quote, more disposed to deal with Russia as the I. C. report says? Comey replied, \u201cThat was not the basis for the I. C.\u2019s assessment. \u201d Aaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.
