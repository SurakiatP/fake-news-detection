S. boots on the ground in Syria as the fight against the Islamic State in the city of Raqqa is intensifying, including the recent deployment of U. S. Marines and Army Rangers. [\u201cThe bill I am introducing today prohibits the Department of Defense from funding any attempt by the administration to expand our presence in Syria by putting U. S. combat boots on the ground,\u201d Rep. Barbara Lee ( .) explained in a statement to The Hill.  \u201cIt is our constitutional duty as members of Congress to place a check on the executive branch in matters of war and peace,\u201d Lee said. Lee was the only lawmaker who voted against the authorization for the use of military force (AUMF) in the days following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks that killed 3, 000 people. The AUMF has given ongoing authority to the U. S. military to continue to fight radical Islamic terror around the globe in all of its incarnations, including the Islamic State in Syria. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, a retired United States Marine Corps General who served as the 11th Commander of the United States Central Command and has experience in the Middle East, Northeast Africa, and Central Asia, said during his confirmation hearing that the campaign to retake Raqqa should be accelerated. On Thursday, Gen. Joseph Votel, commander of U. S. Central Command, confirmed the deployment in a hearing with the Senate Armed Services Committee, The Hill reported. \u201cOur intention here with this  \u2014   and this fell within the authorities that are provided to me right now  \u2014   was to ensure that we had redundant capable fighters support on the ground to support our partners and ensure that we could take advantage of opportunities and ensure the continuing progress that we\u2019ve been seeing,\u201d Votel said. U. S. forces in Syria total 400 in addition to the 500 U. S. military personnel deployed during the Obama administration. Lee\u2019s bill would bar the Pentagon from funding ground combat operations in Syria or hire a private security firm to do the same. The bill includes exceptions to \u201cprotect, rescue or remove\u201d U. S. personnel, The Hill reported. Lee also attempted to impose these restrictions in the form of an amendment to the defense spending bill passed by the House on Wednesday, but the House Rules Committee blocked the amendment, The Hill reported.'"}, "time": 1742562650.1083357}
