And because they now have the conservative puppet president they have always wanted, they want to make sure that nominee is a conservative extremist. \\nSouth Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham told WYFF-TV that Trump should pick Texas Senator Ted Cruz as the nominee and warned Democrats not to block him, which is hypocritical considering how Republicans have treated President Obama\u2019s nominee and threatened to block any nominees Hillary Clinton would have made had she won the election. \\n\u201cI\u2019m here to tell my Democratic colleagues that I voted for Obama\u2019s nominees. I expect them to give Trump\u2019s nominees a fair shake. He won this election. He will pick a conservative. I would put Ted Cruz on that list. If they try to block this pick, they will regret it. If you don\u2019t honor Trump\u2019s nominee, you\u2019re making a huge mistake.\u201d \\nDemocrats should stand up and give Graham a collective middle finger. \\nSince Antonin Scalia died in February, there has been a vacancy on the Supreme Court bench that has yet to be filled. The body wasn\u2019t even cold yet before Republicans vowed to block any nominee President Obama picked to replace him, going so far as to even deny Garland a confirmation hearing. That\u2019s far from the \u201cfair shake\u201d Graham is asking Democrats to give to a man as dangerous as Ted Cruz. \\nPutting Cruz on the Supreme Court would guarantee rulings against women\u2019s rights and LGBT rights as well as putting laws like the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act in further peril. In no uncertain terms should Democrats grant Cruz a hearing, nor should they respect any of Trump\u2019s conservative choices for the court. Republicans should have thought about \u201cfair shakes\u201d before taking the totally unprecedented step of being complete assholes toward the Supreme Court nominee of a sitting president who also won an election and s far more popular than Trump. Again, Senate Republicans didn\u2019t even give Garland a hearing or a vote. They refused to do their jobs entirely out of disrespect towards President Obama. And so that\u2019s exactly what Democrats should do to Trump. Turnabout is fair play and Republicans only have themselves to blame. \\nFeatured Image: Ethan Miller/Getty Images Share this Article!'"}, "time": 1742561859.7546518}
