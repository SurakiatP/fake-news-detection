Trump talked \u201clife\u201d with Kanye West at Trump Tower  \u2014   and Kanye puts off a White House run? \u25a0 A Hill press aide vaults to the White House. In an interview on \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d President Obama drew a red line on \u201ccore issues\u201d that might lead him to speak out against his successor in the first year of his  . If Mr. Trump sought to create a Muslim registry or sought to round up those brought illegally to the United States as children, \u201cI might have to say something about that. \u201d \u201cBut it\u2019s not my intention to be, I\u2019ve said this before, the old guy at the bar who\u2019s just kind of hanging on,\u201d he said. \u201cI need to take some time. \u201d That reluctance to speak out is beginning to anger some fellow Democrats. He also told Trevor Noah, the \u201cDaily Show\u201d host, \u201cWhen the D. N. C. got hacked, we immediately assigned our intelligence community, our law enforcement, to investigate what had happened. \u201d \u201cThis was not a secret,\u201d the president said. The rapper and music impresario Kanye West, who told an audience that he would have cast his ballot for Mr. Trump if he had bothered to vote, dropped by Trump Tower to discuss   issues with the  . And the moment wasn\u2019t going to slip by Mr. Trump, who came down to the lobby to greet the \u201cNew Kanye\u201d in front of the cameras. \u201cJust friends, just friends. He\u2019s a good man. Long time. Friends for a long time,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters about the meeting. He added: \u201cLife. We discussed life. \u201d Mr. West took to Twitter after the meeting to explain. He then suggested cryptically that his own promise to run for the presidency in 2020 would be delayed  \u2014   presumably so as not to challenge Mr. Trump\u2019s second term. Some of his fans may be saying they miss the old Kanye. For congressional reporters of even a moderately long vintage, Stephen Miller was known as an eager press aide to Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, eager to talk . .. and talk . .. and talk about policy, especially his views on immigration. Mr. Miller hit it big when he left the Senate for the Trump campaign when few gave Mr. Trump much of a shot to win the Republican nomination. On Tuesday, he was named assistant to the president and senior adviser to the president for policy. Before Mr. Trump is even inaugurated, the first poll of his potential Democratic opponents in 2020 is now out. Not surprisingly, it looks a bit premature. The survey of 400 Democratic primary voters, conducted last week by Public Policy Polling, drops off precipitously from there, with Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey coming in at 4 percent, Senators Al Franken of Minnesota and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York at 3 percent, Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York at 2 percent, and Juli\u00e1n Castro, President Obama\u2019s housing secretary, at less than 1 percent. In other words, the field is wide open  \u2014   though Mr. Biden did keep his options open. \u201cFour years is a lifetime in American politics. And I think that nominees are determined by their parties based mostly on what skill set is most needed at that time,\u201d the departing vice president said Sunday. \u201cAnd who knows where we\u2019re going to be two years from now when people really start looking seriously at what they are going to do. \u201d Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, perhaps the most conservative Democrat in the Senate, discussed the post of energy secretary, but in the end, his appointment would have only let his state\u2019s new Democratic governor appoint a successor. Mr. Manchin still may be the  \u2019s best Democratic partner as he tries to enact his agenda. His statement after Rick Perry got the energy job: The Trump transition team announced early Tuesday that Rex W. Tillerson, the chairman and chief executive of Exxon Mobil, was the  \u2019s choice for secretary of state, despite concerns over Mr. Tillerson\u2019s close ties to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Those \u201crelationships with leaders all over the world\u201d are what has both Democrats and Republicans worried. Democratic interest groups are happily providing visual evidence. And: But the concern is bipartisan.'"}, "time": 1742628520.3918784}
