C.  \u2014   Vice President Mike Pence honored veterans this Memorial Day from his residence at the Naval Observatory, where about 200 vets attended and Project Hero launched its 10th Annual Memorial Day bike ride to Virginia Beach. [Pence stepped out and greeted the close to 100 riders to cheers from the crowd. He was joined by Karen Pence and Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin.  Project Hero President John Wordin addressed the crowd, noting it was the fourth year in a row the ride began at the Vice President\u2019s residence. He pointed out the problem of suicide among veterans and Shulkin\u2019s work in partnership with Project Hero to address it. Shulkin told the crowd, \u201cIf it\u2019s for veterans, they\u2019re going to be there for us. \u201d He continued, \u201cBoth he and Karen are passionate and relentless when it comes to veterans\u2019 issues. \u201d Pence then took to the podium saying, \u201cThis is a day we remember those who served and did not come home  \u2026    To be able to welcome you here on this most hallowed of days is profoundly humbling to Karen and I. \u201d The Vice President thanked the veterans in attendance for their service and thanked Project Hero. \u201cWe\u2019ll be joining the president in just a few moments at Arlington National Cemetery,\u201d said Pence, adding that he and Karen, as avid cyclists themselves, were slightly jealous of the riders who would be setting out for Virginia Beach shortly.

She encouraged the riders to take oranges and bananas that were set out for them.
