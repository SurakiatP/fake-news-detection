[CNN intimated that the GOP wants to get rid of the \u201clengthy background check\u201d associated with suppressors as well.  In fact, the tax is $200 dollars \u2014  not $200, 000 \u2014  and the background check is one of the only current requirements that the GOP plans to keep in place for suppressors. What they want to get rid of is the bureaucracy of the purchase, whereby   citizens are required to be photographed, fingerprinted, and then to register their suppressor with the government. And yes, the GOP also wants to get rid of the $200 tax. CNN referenced the tax correctly later in the segment, but the mention of a \u201c$200, 000 tax\u201d was how they launched it. Representatives Jeff Duncan (  ) and John Carter (  ) introduced legislation on January 9 that will accomplish all these things. Their bill is the Hearing Protection Act and it is focused on the hearing benefits shooters and outdoorsmen receive from suppressed firearms. CNN\u2019s Victor Blackwell addressed the Hearing Protection Act and said opponents of suppressors see any hearing benefits claims as a \u201cfacade. \u201d He then showed movie clips from Casino Royale and No Country for Old Men and a narrator said, \u201cA gun silencer, shooting enthusiasts call it a suppressor. It\u2019s an assassin\u2019s must have in movies. \u201d The narrator says that opponents of the Hearing Protection Act say the real goal is \u201cabout militarizing weapons, not about hearing,\u201d and that suppressor ownership \u201cwill allow mass shooters to kill stealthily. \u201d In reporting this way, CNN shows the Democrats\u2019 hand \u2014  as far as opposition to suppressors is concerned. They plan to fight against them the same way they fight against   stocks, flash hiders, and collapsible stocks via \u201cassault weapons\u201d bans. And they will try to shame   lawmakers into inaction by suggesting that suppressors make it possible to attack innocents without detection. Americans who are paying attention will quickly realize that the people making these arguments need to quit forming their opinions on suppressors from Hollywood films.
