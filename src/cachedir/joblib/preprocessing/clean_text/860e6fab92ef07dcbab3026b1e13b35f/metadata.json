She shouted his name: Prince. She shook him. But he didn\u2019t come to. Her swift reaction may have helped save Prince\u2019s life that night, six days before he died of an accidental overdose of the opioid painkiller fentanyl. \u201cHis eyes fixed,\u201d just before he nodded off across a table from her, Ms. Hill, 32, recalled in an interview here, speaking for the first time about her presence on the April 15 flight from Atlanta, after Prince\u2019s two shows there. Only one other passenger was on the private jet, Prince\u2019s longtime friend and aide Kirk Johnson. They were bound for Paisley Park, Prince\u2019s estate outside Minneapolis. Over vegetables and pasta, Prince and Ms. Hill discussed his performances that night, which turned out to be his last public concerts other musicians like the funk singer Betty Davis and photography, one of Prince\u2019s hobbies. According to   reports, the chartered 1988 Dassault Falcon 900 took off at 12:51 a. m. from   Atlanta International Airport and was near Chicago, less than an hour from its destination, when Ms. Hill witnessed Prince fall unconscious. If she had glanced away in that instant, down at her phone or purse, she might have thought he had simply dozed off. \u201cThankfully, I happened to be looking into his face,\u201d she said. She immediately got Mr. Johnson, who was near the front of the plane. And when they couldn\u2019t rouse Prince, they alerted the pilot, who called air traffic controllers in Chicago for help at 1:12 a. m. reporting an unresponsive man on board. \u201cWe knew it was only a matter of time we had to get down,\u201d Ms. Hill said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have anything on the plane to help him. \u201d Ms. Hill was \u201cvery freaked out,\u201d she said, as they kept trying to wake him, shaking him and calling his name, while the plane descended. At 1:17 a. m. it made an emergency landing in Moline, Ill. where an ambulance met them. Paramedics and Mr. Johnson carried Prince, 57, into the vehicle, and he was revived on the tarmac with a shot of Narcan, which is typically used to treat opioid overdoses. Eighteen minutes after landing, the ambulance took him to nearby Trinity Moline Hospital. By the time they arrived, he was awake and talking, Ms. Hill said, \u201cwhich was such a relief to me, because I thought he was gone. \u201d She had never seen anything like that happen to him and had no idea what caused his condition. Mr. Johnson\u2019s lawyer declined to comment. For the world, Prince\u2019s sudden emergency landing, initially attributed to the flu but later revealed to have been related to a painkiller overdose, was the first real sign of his abrupt decline. He was an extremely private star who had hidden his pain  \u2014   and his addiction to prescription drugs to treat it  \u2014   from even his inner circle. Ms. Hill, a rising,   artist in her own right, was an intimate and trusted collaborator. \u201cI was with Prince the last two years of my life,\u201d she said. She recorded and performed with him at Paisley Park, leaving her home near Los Angeles to spend half of most months there, and opened for him in concert, in Baltimore, Detroit and Washington. He   her 2015 debut album, \u201cBack in Time\u201d advised her as she disentangled herself from a   record contract and was helping plan her tour. When Prince introduced Ms. Hill to an audience at a private Paisley Park event in March 2015, he announced: \u201cAsk your questions now. She\u2019s going to be a superstar, and you won\u2019t be able to talk to her,\u201d according to The Star Tribune. He even arranged for her album to be sold at the Minneapolis record shop Electric Fetus. \u201cHe asked that we treat her album like we would treat his,\u201d said Jim Novak, the store\u2019s music buyer, who had known Ms. Hill to be around town regularly. She was photographed at the small, private memorial gathering of family and friends there for Prince. \u201cNow he\u2019s gone, and I realize I was leaning on him a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what\u2019s scary. I\u2019m on my own. \u201d She is leaning on his lessons still, she said, as she begins a short East Coast tour this week, with a show at the Highline Ballroom in Manhattan on Wednesday. \u201cHe was such a warrior, and it\u2019s inspiring me to be that person,\u201d she said. Ms. Hill has experienced the loss of a musical superstar before: Working as a background vocalist in 2009, she was chosen to duet with Michael Jackson on \u201cThis Is It,\u201d his planned concert series in London. He died less than three weeks before its start. Ms. Hill performed an emotional rendition of \u201cHeal the World\u201d with a children\u2019s choir at his televised memorial service. But \u201cMichael was different,\u201d she said in another interview late one night, after a rehearsal with her band in Pasadena, Calif. \u201cI didn\u2019t know Michael,\u201d she continued, except \u201cas a fan and as someone that worked for him. \u201d Her grief for Prince was much more personal. Asked if their connection was romantic, Ms. Hill said only: \u201cThere was a very intense relationship. I deeply cared for him. \u201d In a conversation not long before he died, Ms. Hill said, \u201cHe told me that he loved me and that he would always be there for me. \u201d Her parents, also musicians, met him in January, when they went to Paisley Park and performed alongside their daughter, in a bill with Morris Day and the Time. Ms. Hill\u2019s father, the bassist Robert Hill, known as PeeWee, and mother, the keyboardist Michiko Hill, are part of her touring band, which she said had delighted Prince. The couple had played with Sly and the Family Stone and Chaka Khan. Judith wrote her first song, a gospel number, at the age of 4. Ms. Hill appeared on the 2013 season of \u201cThe Voice,\u201d the TV singing competition, and, the same year, in the   documentary about backup singers, \u201c20 Feet from Stardom,\u201d earning a Grammy for her work. In an interview around that time, she was asked about her dream collaborator: \u201cPrince,\u201d she replied. By chance, he saw the interview and called her up, soon inviting her to jam at Paisley Park. By the winter of 2014, they were busy arranging and recording the funky, soulful album she\u2019d written, \u201cBack in Time. \u201d He played guitar, bass and drums, and sang. \u201cHe was my background vocalist for a lot of the songs,\u201d she said, smiling. While they were establishing their professional rapport, they were also creating a routine at Paisley Park, rehearsing on the soundstage into the wee hours. He made her omelets (good) and smoothies (not so good) and beat her at   often. And \u201che was always dressed up, always, always,\u201d she said, even if they were just going to the   at Dairy Queen. Marcus Anderson, a horn player for Prince who also backed Ms. Hill, said Prince had held her musical sensibilities in uniquely high esteem. \u201cHe respected her opinion a lot,\u201d he said. She would come into the recording studio and make suggestions, which were often heeded. \u201cThat was kind of a first,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. Yet Ms. Hill said that Prince had never revealed to her that he was in pain, after decades of   performance and hip surgery. \u201cI only know what everyone knows about his pain  \u2014   I read about it,\u201d she said. In person, \u201che was quick on his feet. Never said anything, that this is hurting, never a sign of struggle. That\u2019s why it\u2019s all very shocking. \u201d Prince had a reputation for clean living, largely followed a vegan diet and frowned on musicians who worked with him using any recreational drugs. But other friends have acknowledged that Prince apparently became dependent on painkillers. Investigators are looking into where he obtained the fentanyl that resulted in his death. They have not discussed whether it was legally prescribed or perhaps bought on the street or online. Ms. Hill did not want to discuss the details of Prince\u2019s medical treatment in Moline. It was, she said, the first time she had ever seen him in distress, and she felt overwhelmed and panicked. He wanted to leave the hospital, but at the urging of his companions, he remained there until morning. Mr. Johnson stayed close, and Ms. Hill said she, too, was at his side, comforting him through the night. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t dreary or drowsy, or anything,\u201d she said. The mood was peaceful, and Prince seemed like his old self. \u201cHe wanted to watch \u2018Zootopia,\u2019\u201d the animated movie. \u201cHe loved those films. I was going to pull it up on my phone. He said: \u2018No, no, no, not here. We\u2019re going to pick a special time and place to watch that. \u2019\u201d Ms. Hill felt that Prince had suffered a close call, one that wouldn\u2019t be repeated. \u201cHe was very cooperative that whole night,\u201d she said, \u201cserious about getting help. \u201d By 10:57 that same morning, the ordeal was over, and the plane took off for Paisley Park once again. Ms. Hill returned to Los Angeles soon after. Still, Prince initially played down the hospital incident to his camp, Ms. Hill said. Worried, she helped tip off others that he was in a serious situation. Friends ultimately reached out to an addiction specialist in California, Dr. Howard Kornfeld. Prince also came around to the notion that he needed help. As he\u2019d promised Ms. Hill, he began taking steps to heal himself. He underwent tests administered by Dr. Michael Schulenberg, a local physician he had seen earlier. \u201cHe did it because he was concerned, and he wanted to do the right thing for his own body,\u201d Ms. Hill said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the part that breaks my heart, because he was trying. He was trying. \u201d Dr. Schulenberg arrived at Paisley Park with the results of some tests, officials have said, just after Prince had been declared dead. Back in California, Ms. Hill learned the news when she woke up to texts from friends. She drove straight to her parents\u2019 house. \u201cThat was definitely the worst day of my life,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe anything that painful could happen. \u201d Onstage, singing the songs they created, Ms. Hill said she will be buoyed by his creativity, and his spirit in their last moments together. In the hospital, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s only by God\u2019s grace that I\u2019m even here,\u201d she recalled. He told her: \u201c\u2018I had to fight for my life. I remember hearing your voices from afar and saying to myself, \u2018Follow the voices, follow the voices, get back in your body, you gotta to do this.\u2019 And he said it was the hardest thing he\u2019d ever done, to get back into his body like that. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628481.8148081}
