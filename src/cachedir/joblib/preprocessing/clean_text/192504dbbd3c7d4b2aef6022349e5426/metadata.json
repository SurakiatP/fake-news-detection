Six of the victims were taken to hospitals, one in critical condition and another in serious condition, the police said. Three others were treated at the scene. At a news conference on Monday afternoon, Capt. Dwayne W. Ready of the Houston Police Department described a tense episode that began about 6:30 a. m. local time. The first reports of gunfire began to trickle in when children were being driven to school, workers were setting off for their jobs and it was still dark on Law Street, where the shooting took place. The street is part of West University Place, an upscale area in southwest Houston. Police officers from several departments converged on the neighborhood, engaging the gunman while trying to protect people in the neighborhood and keep others away. The suspect exchanged gunfire with officers from about 25 yards, Captain Ready said, and was forced to take cover behind a tree close to his parked car. One officer went to the aid of a person who had been shot in a vehicle while other officers provided cover. \u201cOne of the more complex issues was tending to both the injured citizens who were still in the line of fire while engaging the suspect,\u201d Captain Ready said. The police would not identify the suspect at the afternoon news conference or speculate on his motive. But earlier in the day, the department\u2019s interim chief, Martha Montalvo, \u201cHe is a lawyer, and there were issues concerning his law firm. \u201d The authorities believe the suspect acted alone, and at the news conference, Mark Webster, an assistant special agent in charge of F. B. I. special operations, said they were not aware of any connection to a terrorist organization. He said the investigation was still preliminary. Captain Ready said that the gunman was wearing   apparel, and that there were \u201csome old Nazi emblems about his personal effects\u201d and where he lived, along with \u201cvintage military stuff\u201d dating to the Civil War. He would not speculate on whether it was Nazi apparel, but Chief Montalvo said later that \u201can old Nazi emblem\u201d was on his uniform. The gunman also carried an \u201cedged weapon,\u201d something like a knife, which was in a sheath, Captain Ready said. The suspect had a .  Tommy gun and a .  semiautomatic handgun. Both were purchased legally, a spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said. The local TV station ABC 13 showed images of a Porsche Boxster parked on the street and being searched. Jennifer Molleda, whose husband\u2019s car was struck while he was driving, told ABC 13, \u201cThe shooter was literally pointing the gun at windshields. \u201d She said her husband had spoken to her by telephone after he pulled into the parking lot of a Petco store at a strip mall nearby. \u201cHe was screaming: \u2018I am shot. I am shot,\u2019 \u201d she said. The mayor of Houston, Sylvester Turner, who was in Cuba on a trade trip, told ABC 13 by telephone that the investigation was looking into whether a relationship at the lawyer\u2019s workplace had gone \u201cawry. \u201d Witnesses told local television stations that they had heard several gunshots. \u201cSteady shooting back and forth  \u2014   it was a lot,\u201d said Antoine Wilson, who told ABC 13 that he was driving in the area and heard multiple gunshots. An unidentified woman told the TV station that she had been driving to work when she heard the gunfire. Her car was struck from the front and side, she said, but she kept driving, pulling around a corner until she came to a stop. \u201cI could still hear shots being fired on the streets,\u201d she said, her arm bloody from broken glass. Lee Williams, who said he lives near the site of the gunfire, told ABC 13 that he was outside and tried to direct traffic away. \u201cOnce the police got here, they made me go back to my house,\u201d he said. \u201cI heard a lot of back and forth,\u201d he said, adding that he had counted about 50 shots. Mr. Williams retreated to his front porch but was close enough to hear the police radios say, \u201cHe is down. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564218.294752}
