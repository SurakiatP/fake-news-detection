It may have less to do with your mood than your birth control pills, high blood pressure pills, antibiotics or even anti-hair-loss drug according to new research. New risks have also emerged with popular gastroesophageal reflux disease medicines and even the top-selling painkiller Tylenol. \\nThere are two reasons the risks associated with popular drugs seem to trail their aggressive promotion. Certainly, as millions use brand name drugs, dangerous side effects and adverse events are seen that did not emerge in much smaller clinical trials. Who knew? But also, as AlterNet has noted before, dangerous side effects that might be considered major drawbacks to prescribing the drugs often emerge only when drugs have gone \u201coff patent\u201d and all their profit potential is realized. For both reasons, drug safety activists recommend waiting five years before taking a \u201cnew\u201d drug\u2014until it is not \u201cnew\u201d anymore. \\nAdvertisement \\nHere are drugs and drug classes that have raised new concerns. \\n1. Proton Pump Inhibitors \\nOne of Pharma\u2019s most successful gambits has been its proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) like Nexium (the \u201cPurple Pill\u201d) and Prilosec that reduce stomach acid. To sell the drugs, Pharma aggressively raised \u201cawareness\u201d of gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD a rare condition which, over time, can change the lining of the esophagus and lead to cancer. Actually, most PPI users have simple heartburn. Even babies are now given PPIs for \u201cbaby reflux\u201d because they spit up 71 times a day\u2014a normal occurrence that has been pathologized. \\nThe medical establishment has deplored PPI overuse, pointing out that heartburn can exist without esophageal damage and vice verse and calling PPIs \u201cpurple crack.\u201d Now it turns out they are right\u2014acid reducers are addictive. \u201cOnce a patient has taken a PPI for longer than a few weeks, acid hypersecretion can occur on discontinuation,\u201d says a recent article in Pharmaceutical Journal. \u201cThis causes rebound symptoms, and frequently establishes a vicious cycle of drug reinitiation and long-term continuation.\u201d \\nAdverse effects of long-term PPI use are well documented from the risks of the dread intestinal infection Clostridium difficile (\u201cC Diff\u201d), bone thinning and fractures and vitamin and mineral deficiencies to chronic kidney disease and heart attacks. Now there is a new reported risk: dementia. \\nA study earlier this year in JAMA Neurology of 73,?679 people 75 or older with no dementia and taking PPIs found the patients \u201chad a significantly increased risk of incident dementia compared with the patients not receiving PPI.\u201d Other studies have also found a link. \\n2. Antibiotics \\nAlterNet has frequently written about underreported antibiotic dangers, most recently of the fluoroquinolone class which includes Cipro and Levaquin. Even as the FDA tries to curtail use of antibiotics on the nation\u2019s farms to make animals grow faster (a use which accounts for most U.S. antibiotic sales) drug use on the farm is actually increasing. The FDA\u2019s 2014 Summary Report on Antimicrobials Sold or Distributed for Use in Food Producing Animals reveals that cephalosporin sales increased by 57 percent between 2009 through 2014, sales of antibiotics like clindamycin increased by 150 percent and sales of antibiotics like gentamicin, a dangerous drug class, increased by 36 percent. \\nAntibiotics have a probable role in obesity\u2014why wouldn\u2019t they when they add pounds to livestock? In 1974, Navy recruits were given antibiotics to see if they would gain weight, and after only seven weeks, they did. Similar results were seen in children in Guatemala and in babies . But making people fat or encouraging antibiotic resistant microbes like MRSA are the least of the risks, it turns out. \\nWe now know that the bacteria in our gut, the microbiome, which antibiotics compromise as they kill the \u201cbad\u201d bacteria, are responsible for much more than good digestion. Antibiotics also affect the brain and \u201cinfluence our mood and temperament,\u201d says food expert Michael Pollan. \u201cIf you transplant the gut microbiota of relaxed and adventurous mice into the guts of timid and anxious mice they become less stressed and more adventurous.\u201d Antibiotic-affected microbiomes may also be behind asthma and autoimmune diseases, acne and even autism, say published reports. \\n3. Birth Control Pills You know the long list of side effects and warnings at the end of drug ads? Telling you the drug may cause you to bleed to death or have a stroke while you look at images of sunsets and puppies? We have women\u2019s health advocates to thank for the disclosures. Fifty years ago when the Pill first became available, there was no \u201cdisclosure.\u201d Women did not know what effects birth control pills would have on their bodies\u2014or even think it was theirright to know\u2014and were supposed to take them anyway.\\nBy 1970, after The Doctors\u2019 Case Against the Pill by Barbara Seaman was published, Wisconsin senator Gaylord Nelson held hearings about clear links between the Pill and depression, blood clots and decrease in libido cited nowhere on the label. No women were asked to speak at the hearings, moving Alice Wolfson, a co-founder of the National Women\u2019s Health Network, to say, \u201cIt must be admitted that women make superb guinea pigs. They don\u2019t cost anything, they feed themselves, they clean their own cages, pay for their own pills, and remunerate the clinical observer. We will no longer tolerate intimidation by white-coated gods antiseptically directing our lives.\u201d \\nWhy were feminists so angry about a drug that let them control their reproduction? Because the Pill caused 50 additional physiological changes besides stopping pregnancy, some of which were and are life-threatening. Women were told by the the male-dominated medical establishment not to worry their pretty heads about what the drugs were doing to their bodies, while men were spared any responsibility or medical risks. \\nFast-forward to this year, when medical studies again confirmed links between birth control pills and depression. A Danish study of more than a million women found links between birth control pills and depression, especially in young women, and corresponding higher use of antidepressant drugs. \\nWomen\u2019s health advocates were finally vindicated. \u201cThe risk of depression has been recognized since women were able to get their hands on oral contraceptives,\u201d says Cindy Pearson of the National Women\u2019s Health Network. \u201cIt\u2019s been reported by women for 50 years.\u201d \\nA 2013 book called Sweetening the Pill: or How We Got Hooked on Hormonal Birth Control might also be vindicated, writes Lara Prendergast. The book was called \u201ca dishonest anti-Pill treatise\u201d because the author \u201cdared to point out that hormonal contraceptives are ranked by the World Health Organization as a class-one carcinogen alongside tobacco and asbestos,\u201d she writes. \\n4. Propecia \\nTwo years ago, AlterNet told readers about Propecia, a popular treatment for male pattern baldness linked to disturbing side effects in men including sexual dysfunction and actual reduction in penis size. At the time, Propecia\u2019s label assured users that sexual side effects \u201cwent away in men who stopped taking Propecia\u201d; however, the current label warns about sexual dysfunction like \u201cerectile dysfunction, libido disorders, ejaculation disorders, and orgasm disorders; male infertility and/or poor seminal quality\u201d that continues after discontinuation of treatment. \\nA September study in BMJ found \u201cthe risk of erectile dysfunction was not increased for users of finasteride 1mg compared with unexposed men with alopecia [hair loss],\u201d but reports of the disturbing side effects abound in medical j ournals and popular magazines. \\n\u201cEmerging research and a slew of lawsuits suggest that finasteride may be more dangerous than previously believed, with side effects \u2014 inability to orgasm, painful erections, chronic depression, insomnia, brain fog, and suicidal thoughts \u2014 that can last long after patients stop taking the pill,\u201d wrote Men\u2019s Journal last year. \\nDespite the life-changing side effects, Propecia/finasteride is still aggressively sold with warnings about its use downplayed and hard to find. In fact, \u201cAs of Sept. 26, the World Health Organization Program for International Drug Monitoring\u2019s database of adverse drug reactions contained 13,546 finasteride ADRs [adverse drug reactions], including 3,577 sexual function and fertility disorders, 1,526 depressed mood disorders and disturbances, and 67 completed suicides,\u201d writes the Post-Finasteride Syndrome Foundation . \\n5. Tylenol \\nTylenol may be one of the most widely used pain relieving drugs in the world but new safety concerns continue to emerge. The risk of liver damage with Tylenol (acetaminophen) that can occur from taking even a slightly higher dose than directed moved Tylenol maker, Johnson & Johnson to increase warnings in 2014. Unintentional acetaminophen overdoses cause as many as 26,000 hospitalizations and 458 deaths per year reported the FDA. \\nSoon after the increased warnings, medical journals linked acetaminophen to birth defects in the children of women taking the drug such as poor motor development, behavior problems and language delays. A study in JAMA Pediatrics identified an increased occurrence of ADHD by the age of seven in children whose mothers took acetaminophen. A study in the International Journal of Epidemiology found children more likely to have behavior problems and slow motor development by the age of three if their mothers had taken acetaminophen. Not all medical voices concur. Some said the studies were poorly designed or that fevers , for which the mother presumably took acetaminophen, are responsible for the birth defects. \\nIn recent years, acetaminophen has been found to have psychological and mental effects not before described. The pain reliever may \u201cblunt individuals\u2019 reactivity to a range of negative stimuli in addition to physical pain,\u201d says one study. Another study found acetaminophen reduced the psychological pain caused by social rejection. \\n6. Beta Blockers \\nOne out of three American has high blood pressure and beta-blockers like atenolol (Tenormin), carvedilol (Coreg), metoprolol, propranolol (Inderal), sotalol (Betapace) and timolol (Timoptic) which treat the condition have been linked to depression for many years. \\nAs early as 1967, the British Medical Journal reported that hypertensive patients treated with propranolol for cardiac arrhythmias experienced a rise in the incidence of depression. Still, it has not been known if patients\u2019 depressions were caused by the actual actions of beta blockers (like blocking the effects of epinephrine/adrenaline and slowing heart rate) or mood conditions associated with the diseases for which beta blockers are prescribed such as hypertension and congestive heart failure. \\nNow, the evidence is tipping toward the drugs. An October study in the journal Hypertension found that beta blockers \u201cmay have a role in the pathogenesis or course of mood disorders\u201d and increased hospital admissions for mood disorders. A \u201cbidirectional relationship between depression and cardiovascular disease\u201d exists, says the study , \u201cbecause of the overlapping pathophysiological processes that underlie both conditions.\u201d \\n\u201cThere is a lot of data that depression and cardiovascular disease are related ... but current hypertensive practices do not consider depression,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author Sandosh Padmanabhan. \u201cThere could be some people who are predisposed to depression who we should not be giving these drugs.\u201d \\n'"}, "time": 1742628599.211883}
