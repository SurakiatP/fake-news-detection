It had taken him a year to arrange a postdoctoral research post at the University of Pittsburgh. When he sat down in Seat 19E, on a Boeing 777 operated by KLM out of Tehran early Saturday, he felt that he had finally fulfilled his dream. \u201cIt\u2019s the excitement you feel when you make a long trip to an unknown destination,\u201d Mr. Paragomi said. It was not to be. Mr. Paragomi and six other Iranians remained stranded at Schiphol Airport outside Amsterdam on Tuesday, as their travel ordeal stretched into its fourth day. They were among thousands of people affected by President Trump\u2019s executive order barring from the United States, for 90 days, travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The largely spontaneous and spirited protests at American airports over the weekend focused on several aspects of Mr. Trump\u2019s order, including a   ban on all refugees, an indefinite ban on Syrian refugees and an attempt  \u2014   later blocked by judges  \u2014   to deport people with valid visas or refugee status who had already arrived in the United States. But many travelers were stuck in various states of limbo abroad  \u2014   far from the sightlines of American protesters  \u2014   and their plight has only slowly come to light, in many cases through the efforts of volunteer lawyers who have been working on their cases. A    Syrian man said that he had been blocked from flying from Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates, to the United States, where he had a research position lined up at a university in North Dakota. He said Mr. Trump\u2019s order would affect his career. In an email to The New York Times, he shared a copy of his United States visa  \u2014   the word CANCELED was written over it  \u2014   but asked that his name not be used because he did not want to jeopardize his residency status in the United Arab Emirates. In Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, a group of Somali refugees remained at an airport on Tuesday. Ethiopian officials ejected a journalist who tried to speak with them, citing unspecified national security concerns. The seven Iranians stuck in Amsterdam were pulled aside on Saturday by United States agents stationed at the airport. They could not leave the airport because they did not have European visas. Mr. Paragomi likened their plight to that of the character played by Tom Hanks in the 2004 film \u201cThe Terminal,\u201d about a man stuck at an airport for nearly a year after a coup in his country made it impossible for him to fly back home. Among the Iranians stuck there were Esaghi Abolghasem and his wife, Kobra Alizadeh, who had left Iran on the same flight as Mr. Paragomi. They were heading for Washington to visit their daughter, whom they had not seen in five years. \u201cMy heart was filled with joy,\u201d Mr. Abolghasem said. He was stunned when he heard the news that he could not travel to the United States because of Mr. Trump\u2019s order. \u201cI thought I would get a heart attack,\u201d Mr. Abolghasem said. From Amsterdam, Mr. Paragomi, the medical student, called his cousin in California, who was fast asleep. \u201cHe didn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Mr. Paragomi recalled. \u201cHe thought I had made a mistake with my papers. He said: \u2018Such things don\u2019t happen in the United States. Of course you can travel. \u2019\u201d Nobody knew what to do with the stranded Iranians. After hours of wandering through the immense airport, they met at a transfer point. All had cash, as Iranians generally do not possess international credit cards. \u201cWe sat there,\u201d Mr. Abolghasem said. \u201cNobody did anything. \u201d After a day they started looking for places to showers, but the two airport hotels were expensive. One man in the group went to pray at the airport\u2019s meditation center, where he met an airport official who introduced the group to a Dutch pastor who offered to help. \u201cIt\u2019s a very sad situation,\u201d said the pastor, Nico Sarot. \u201cWe should be uniting people. Some are building walls, where we should be tearing them down. I\u2019m trying to help them out with the airlines and with lawyers, and also just to be there to listen to their stories, but there is just not so much we can do. \u201d Night after night, they slept in the chairs at the airport. \u201cIt was cold, we had no blankets,\u201d Mrs. Alizadeh said. \u201cI felt so sad to suddenly be in this situation. \u201d But there was hope, too. When they saw on the news that across the United States people had started to gather at airports in protest, they told each other to wait. \u201cI was hoping there would be people outside of Amsterdam airport too,\u201d Mr. Paragomi said. \u201cWe thought if we stick it out, maybe we can travel to the U. S. as well. \u201d By the time a federal judge in Brooklyn blocked part of Mr. Trump\u2019s order on Saturday night, other Iranians had already given up and flown back home. But the group of seven decided to stay, hoping to be admitted. \u201cDutch immigration officers started coming over, asking what our plans were,\u201d Mr. Paragomi recalled. \u201cAirline representatives spoke to us, warning that if we didn\u2019t go back, our tickets would become invalid. \u201d On Monday they were all taken to a business class lounge to have showers. They were given food, too. Lawyers from the United States got in touch with them by WhatsApp and email to help out. But by Tuesday afternoon, their resistance had started to crumble. A KLM flight heading for Tehran was leaving, and Mr. Paragomi said on Tuesday morning that he did not know what to do. \u201cI worked so hard for this,\u201d he said of his research post in Pittsburgh. \u201cIf there is a slight chance I can go and study in the U. S. I will stay. \u201d Eventually, Mr. Paragomi and four other Iranians took a plane back to Tehran, while two Iranians stayed behind, having received help from an American lawyer based in the Netherlands. As he gathered his belongings for the flight home, Mr. Paragomi asked: \u201cI\u2019m only a student. What did I do wrong?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742628474.2218115}
