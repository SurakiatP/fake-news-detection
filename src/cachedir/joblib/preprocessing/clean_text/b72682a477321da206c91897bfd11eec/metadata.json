Judging by much of the media reaction, he would have done better to save his breath. \u201cA Monster of Delusion,\u201d read the headline over a picture of Mr. Blair in The Daily Mail on Thursday. The Sun, another British tabloid, described him as a \u201cWeapon of Mass Deception,\u201d a reference to the incorrect assertions by Mr. Blair and President George W. Bush before the invasion that Iraq had an arsenal of unconventional weapons. Nine years after stepping down from office, Mr. Blair  \u2014   the most successful politician of his generation, who led the Labour Party to three consecutive general election victories with a centrist message  \u2014   is widely loathed in Britain, his legacy defined overwhelmingly by the Iraq war and its bloody aftermath. He has few defenders, especially within his own party, which was split at the time by his support for the war and has since shifted leftward again, repudiating much of what he stood for. Mr. Blair is such a pariah on the left, said Steven Fielding, director of the Center for British Politics at the University of Nottingham, that \u201cif he says \u2018black,\u2019 almost everyone else will say \u2018white.\u2019 \u201d Mr. Fielding added, \u201cIn the party he once led, to be described as Blairite is the greatest insult that can be leveled. \u201d More broadly, Mr. Blair has failed to rehabilitate his image since leaving office, and in some ways has added to his problems. Though he set up the Tony Blair Faith Foundation, intended to counter religious conflict and extremism, its work has been overshadowed by his business interests. Mr. Blair\u2019s wealth, and his willingness to advise nations with poor human rights records such as Kazakhstan, has fueled another strand of criticism: that he was always too impressed by those with power and money. And his diplomatic work, trying to bring peace to the Middle East, ran up against the intractability of the conflicts in that region. \u201cThere will not be a day of my life where I do not relive and rethink what happened,\u201d Mr. Blair said, referring to the Iraq war. \u201cPeople ask me why I spend so much time in the Middle East today. This is why. This is why I work on Middle East peace, on the dialogue between faiths on how we can prevent young people growing up with hatred in their hearts towards those who look, think or believe differently from them. \u201d The 2.   report released on Wednesday was a savage indictment of Britain\u2019s involvement in Iraq, condemning it as ill prepared and poorly executed, and concluding that it was based on flawed and unchallenged intelligence. In confronting the charges against him, Mr. Blair spoke sometimes in confessional terms, acknowledging those failings with \u201cmore sorrow, regret and apology and in greater measure than you can know or may believe. \u201d But what he did not do was to accept the fundamental premise of many of his critics: that he had been wrong to sanction military action against Saddam Hussein. The view of many of the protesters who gathered on Wednesday waving placards reading \u201cBLIAR,\u201d and of relatives of some of those who died in the conflict, is that he is culpable for taking Britain into a disastrous war on false pretenses. There have been attempted citizens\u2019 arrests of him on war crimes charges. As one of his Labour Party critics, Diane Abbott, said on Thursday, Mr. Blair\u2019s reputation had \u201cbled to death in the sands of Iraq. \u201d Mr. Blair was always unpopular among the left of the party, who felt he had gone too far in abandoning core principles for the center ground while embracing central elements of Thatcherism. Even they would admit that he was good at winning elections: He scored his third victory in 2005, after the invasion of Iraq. Mr. Blair presided over a generally healthy economy and helped build peace in Northern Ireland. But many Britons found it inexplicable that he chose to go to war alongside Mr. Bush. In 2003, Mr. Bush was unpopular in Britain, and so was going to war in Iraq. Mr. Blair has sought to address his critics previously, but not at such length and with such public emotion as he has since the publication of the new report on Wednesday. The gist of his response was that his job as prime minister was to make tough decisions and that while he regretted many of the consequences of this one, he stood by it as the best available option at the time. \u201cThe world is better off without Saddam,\u201d Mr. Blair told reporters in London, adding that had the Iraqi leader been left alone, he would have remained a threat to peace. And, had Mr. Hussein survived until the Arab Spring of 2011, he would have clung to power \u201cwith the same deadly consequences as we see in the carnage of Syria,\u201d Mr. Blair suggested. \u201cI will never agree that those who died or who were injured made their sacrifice in vain,\u201d said Mr. Blair, while acknowledging that some of the families of those casualties \u201ccannot and do not accept this is so. \u201d In that he is correct. After the report\u2019s publication, Sarah O\u2019Connor, the relative of one victim, called Mr. Blair \u201cthe world\u2019s worst terrorist. \u201d Reg Keys, another victim\u2019s relative, described Mr. Blair as a \u201cconsummate actor\u201d and said that his long public statement resembled \u201cthe ramblings of a madman. \u201d While the report, seven years in the making, provides a damning indictment of sloppy   cataloging a host of policy and other failings, it does not accuse Mr. Blair of lying  \u2014   a point to which the former prime minister returned frequently. Over the years, Mr. Blair has been accused by critics of deceiving Parliament and the public, and on Wednesday he said accusations of \u201cbad faith, of lying or deceit or deliberate misrepresentation\u201d should be laid to rest. \u201cI did not mislead this country,\u201d Mr. Blair said. \u201cI made the decision in good faith on the information that I had at the time. \u201d His unequivocal support for Mr. Bush was essential to prevent the United States from pursuing a unilateral foreign policy, Mr. Blair argued, rejecting the characterization of himself as the president\u2019s \u201cpoodle. \u201d He defended a message sent to Mr. Bush, before the decision to invade, including the phrase: \u201cI will be with you, whatever. \u201d That statement was, Mr. Blair said, \u201cnot a blank check. \u201d Yet 13 years after Mr. Blair ordered British troops into action, his response to the latest inquiry is unlikely to bring closure because he is not budging on one central point. \u201cWhat I cannot do and will not do,\u201d Mr. Blair said, \u201cis say we took the wrong decision. \u201d Mr. Fielding said history\u2019s judgment on Mr. Blair\u2019s premiership may be more positive, but that Mr. Blair has refused to do the one thing that might soften the damning verdict of his contemporaries. \u201cIf he was ever going to, this was the moment for him to apologize and say, \u2018We should not have done this,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Fielding said. \u201cIf he isn\u2019t going to say this now, he will take this to his grave. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562261.6642644}
