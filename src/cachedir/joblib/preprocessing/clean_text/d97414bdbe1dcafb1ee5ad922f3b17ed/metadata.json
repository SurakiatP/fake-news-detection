Is Usain Bolt still the world\u2019s fastest man? And what sort of cushy digs will the United States basketball players find for themselves? The Games are underway, Bolt is back to defend his sprinting titles, and once again, the men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball players from the United States are avoiding the athletes\u2019 village. Carmelo Anthony, Kevin Durant, Diana Taurasi and the rest of their   teammates are staying on a luxury cruise ship, docked at a pier on the other side of the city. If the team\u2019s lodging seems standoffish, that is by design. U. S. A. Basketball, the organization that oversees the national men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams, has shunned the athletes\u2019 village since 1992. The team stayed on a ship at the 2004 Games in Athens, then used hotels in Beijing in 2008 and London in 2012. \u201cThe boat we\u2019re staying on is very nice, very secluded,\u201d said Angel McCoughtry, who is playing in her second Olympics. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest  \u2014   how can our men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams stay in the village? They would get bombarded, especially the men\u2019s team. They won\u2019t have peace. \u201d The players, particularly the men, are exceedingly well paid as professionals. But other highly compensated athletes seemingly have no qualms about mixing with the other Olympians in the village. Bolt, probably the biggest star of these Games, checked into the village the other day. Michael Phelps, the world\u2019s most famous swimmer, ran into Novak Djokovic, the   men\u2019s tennis player in the world, in the village and asked for a selfie. The United States women\u2019s gymnastics team, the showpiece of the American delegation, is also in the village. In fact, a majority of the 554 American athletes stay there. Jerry Colangelo, the director of U. S. A. Basketball, said keeping the basketball players in seclusion was a matter of security. \u201cOur players are probably the most recognizable athletes in the world,\u201d he said, explaining the \u201cextra precaution\u201d being taken. \u201cWe have our own idea of how to do that,\u201d Colangelo said. \u201cWe can\u2019t just throw them in with  \u2014   once the International Olympic Committee decided they wanted pro players, to allow pro players to play, we have to protect them. They\u2019re very valuable assets. \u201d Fans are kept at a distance behind a guarded fence with metal detectors, but they have been sticking their cellphones through the fencing to take photographs of the ship  \u2014   the Silver Cloud, part of the Silversea Cruises fleet, which can accommodate 296 people. U. S. A. Basketball officials are circumspect when asked about the accommodations. Reporters are invited to tour the athletes\u2019 village, but not the ship, bobbing in place at the Pier Mau\u00e1. There are 46 N. B. A. players and 26 W. N. B. A. players at these Games representing many countries. Several who do not play for the United States seemed to be enjoying life at the village last week. Andrew Bogut, a couple of months removed from playing in the N. B. A. finals with the Golden State Warriors, was sitting in the village on Thursday, decked in a Team Australia   suit, eating food from McDonald\u2019s with two teammates. Leandro Barbosa and Nene are staying there, too, along with all the other Brazilian Olympians. Manu Ginobili of Argentina posted on Twitter a view from his room in the village. Pau Gasol, Ricky Rubio, Jose Calderon and the other players of Spain snapped photographs around the village grounds all week. Tina Charles, who won a gold medal with the United States women\u2019s team in 2012, said the team\u2019s accommodations meant that \u201cyou\u2019re not able to interact with athletes, you\u2019re not able to see them every day, build relationships, build friendships that way. \u201d Maya Moore, appearing at her second Games, said she understood the pros and cons, but she said the ship made it easier to focus. \u201cThere is a level of socialization that happens in the village that takes energy,\u201d she said. \u201cOver the course of two weeks, it can wear on you, even if it\u2019s a little bit. \u201d The Plaza Mau\u00e1, on the city\u2019s eastern waterfront, where the ship is docked, was revamped as one of the legacy projects of these Games, with new museums and areas for outdoor activities. Warehouses along the pier are now used as event and party spaces. Taurasi, one of the women\u2019s team captains, lightheartedly described the ship as having \u201ca nice,   Russian d\u00e9cor. \u201d Jimmy Butler, a member of the men\u2019s team, said there were a pool, a gym, social rooms and conference rooms. Players can order room service anytime. \u201cSame thing we\u2019d do in a hotel,\u201d Butler said. \u201cIt just floats. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628537.3998978}
