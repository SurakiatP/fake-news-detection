[The judge\u2019s cry of outrage came when he could not block the orderly repatriation of an illegal immigrant who has two drunk driving convictions, plus a U. S. wife and three children.   \u201cWe are unable to prevent [Andres] Magana Ortiz\u2019s removal, yet it is contrary to the values of this nation and its legal system,\u201d complained Judge Stephen Reinhardt, who wishes to extend citizens\u2019 rights to illegal foreign migrants. He said:  We are compelled to deny Mr. Magana Ortiz\u2019s request for a stay of removal because we do not have the authority to grant it. We are not, however, compelled to find the government\u2019s action in this case fair or just.   \u2026      The government\u2019s decision to remove Magana Ortiz diminishes not only our country but our courts, which are supposedly dedicated to the pursuit of justice. Magana Ortiz and his family are in truth not the only victims. Among the others are judges who, forced to participate in such inhumane acts, suffer a loss of dignity and humanity as well. I concur as a judge, but as a citizen I do not. The judge, who was appointed  \u2014   not elected  \u2014   in 1980 and is married to a former top leader in the ACLU, also lamented the authority of ordinary DHS agents to enforce the law despite protests from     \u201ccivil rights\u201d lawyers: On January 25, 2017, the President [Donald Trump] signed a series of executive orders dismantling the system of priorities that had previously guided Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol in determining whom to deport. The orders also gave far greater authority to individual agents and officers, who are now removing   simply because they are here illegally, regardless of whether they have committed any offense. In light of the breadth of these orders and the lack of any apparent limit on agents\u2019 discretion, the undocumented must now choose between going to work, school, hospitals, and even court, and the risk of being seized.  In contrast, the new Supreme Court Justice appointed by Trump, Neil Gorsuch, has a more humble vision of his job as a judicial referee, saying in a 2013 award ceremony that: As my daughters remind me, donning a [judicial] robe doesn\u2019t make me any smarter   \u2026     It serves as a reminder of what\u2019s expected of us \u2014  what [Irish philosopher Edmund] Burke called the \u201ccold neutrality of an impartial judge. \u201d It serves, too, as a reminder of the relatively modest station we\u2019re meant to occupy in a democratic society. In other places, judges wear scarlet and ermine. Here, we\u2019re told to buy our own plain black robes  \u2014   and I can attest the standard choir outfit at the local uniform supply store is a good deal. Ours is a judiciary of honest black polyester. The judges on Reinhardt\u2019s Ninth Circuit are expected to release soon a decision blocking Trump\u2019s Executive Orders limiting the entry of people from six   Muslim countries. The decision is based on a Hawaiian case, in which an   Islamic cleric claimed his constitutional rights were infringed by Trump\u2019s efforts to reduce Islamic jihad in the United States. The court\u2019s decision may have been delayed by the   bloody attacks in Manchester and London, at least one of which was conducted by the sons of Muslim refugees and migrants from Libya.  Reinhardt\u2019s intemperate language, said Andrew Arthur, a former immigration judge, suggests that the court\u2019s decisions are political biased. \u201cThere is no \u2018cold neutrality\u2019 in the Ninth Circuit\u2019s ruling,\u201d Arthur wrote about the court\u2019s preliminary ruling in the Hawaii case. \u201cIt is personal, visceral, and vindictive. \u201d '"}, "time": 1742564617.3934948}
