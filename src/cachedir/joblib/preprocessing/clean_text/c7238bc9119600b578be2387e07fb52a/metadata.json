You save it for when you really need it. \\n\u201cAnd when it\u2019s cast-iron bolted-on that you\u2019ll win the next election at a walk, no matter what you do to the NHS or the public finances or whatever, then you take your time. \\n\u201cThe Brexit court thing is annoying \u2013 I have dinner plans for April 2019 I don\u2019t want to change \u2013 but the last thing I need is the Labour party coming to their senses and getting in my way. \\n\u201cI\u2019ve got free licence to do whatever I want to Britain for the next nine years and I can\u2019t do any of it without Jeremy. He\u2019s not going anywhere until 2020.\u201d \\nCorbyn said: \u201cThank Christ for that, I thought I was going to be out of a job.\u201d \\nShare:'"}, "time": 1742562219.3159704}
