[\u201cIt appears that unknown subjects are trying to create a public panic and we want our community to be assured that this is a complete hoax,\u201d the Fontana Police Department said in a statement, according to the Los Angeles Times. \u201cWe understand that fake news can spread quickly via social media and encourage you to always fact check things you read or hear. \u201d  U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Spokeswoman Virginia Kice told the Daily Bulletin, \u201cWe don\u2019t do checkpoints. \u201d According to the San Gabriel Valley Tribune, the rumors about the immigration checkpoint were traced to the Mr Checkpoint account on Twitter, which tweeted, \u201cNOW #InlandEmpire Immigration Checkpoint #Ontario near Euclid Ave  60 Freeway. \u201d @jr1224_ it was on Mr. Checkpoint. They usually get DUI checkpoints correct  they use police scanners. Haven\u2019t passed by personally though.  \u2014   jaime (@himay3000) February 3, 2017,  However, once Mr Checkpoint discovered those rumors were fake news, it posted on Facebook: \u201c[]Looks like we have false reports of Immigration Checkpoints. Many people had messaged this and it looks like intentional misinformation that was meant to spread confusion  negativity. \u201d It added, \u201cPlease move past this so we can shift back to positive energy. \u201d It\u2019s all about love! pic. twitter.   \u2014   Mr. Checkpoint (@MrCheckpoint) February 3, 2017,  Trying to figure out this whole immigration checkpoint thing going on in Ontario right now. I\u2019m hoping we don\u2019t see more of these.. \ud83d\ude2b  \u2014   Mr. Checkpoint (@MrCheckpoint) February 2, 2017,  We received several reports of an immigration checkpoint that were found to not have occurred. Deleting that tweet and will keep you posted.  \u2014   Mr. Checkpoint (@MrCheckpoint) February 3, 2017,  Some social media users reportedly stated that the brief detentions of some individuals in airports this past weekend, coupled with protests that wound up backing up traffic for hours, amplified concerns. \u201cRumors currently being circulated  \u2014   primarily on social media, claiming the agency has set up checkpoints at multiple locations in Los Angeles  \u2014   or that the agency is conducting random \u2018raids\u2019 are completely baseless,\u201d Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Virginia Kice told the Times. \u201cThe agency is working diligently to address these false reports, and we urge the media not to give them credence. It only encourages   people to act irresponsibly. \u201d Follow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter and Periscope @AdelleNaz'"}, "time": 1742563400.955738}
