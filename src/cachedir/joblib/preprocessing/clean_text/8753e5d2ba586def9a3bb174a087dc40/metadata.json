But the recent wave of toppled tombstones and threats against Jewish centers in the United States has at least as many worrying that his rise may also not be good for Jews. \u201cJews in America, that\u2019s supposed to work,\u201d said Einat Wilf, a former member of the Knesset for the   Labor Party. \u201cTo have these instances, is that an aberration? Or has the American president unleashed forces  \u2014   willingly, unwillingly, consciously, unconsciously  \u2014   but maybe he has unleashed forces that will challenge the place of Jews in America?\u201d Israelis have grown used to rising nationalism in Europe that has fed  . But many have looked to the United States, home to the largest number of Jews outside Israel, as a relative refuge from   not another front for it. Few here suggest that has permanently changed (though the Labor Party leader, Isaac Herzog, recently said Israel should prepare for a wave of American immigrants). But worry spans left and right, even if they disagree on exactly how much to blame Mr. Trump, who is seen here as growing more confusing by the day. What to make of a president who, on the same day, denounced the   attacks but also suggested  \u2014   in remarks widely covered here  \u2014   that they might have been carried out by his own enemies? There is the Mr. Trump whom Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described in their meeting in February: \u201cThere is no greater supporter of the Jewish people and the Jewish state than President Donald Trump,\u201d he said, citing personal ties of decades and agreement on many policies, including the perils of Iran and of Islamic extremism. There is also the Mr. Trump in the photograph on the front page of Israel\u2019s leading newspaper. \u201cLiving in Fear in His Country,\u201d read the headline in the newspaper, Yediot Aharonot, previewing a   special section to Friday\u2019s weekend supplement on \u201cthe new America\u201d with \u201cswastikas, desecration of tombstones, curses and threats. \u201d Reuven and Negina Abrahamov, grocery owners outside Tel Aviv, are Trump supporters and disturbed by what they see in United States. \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of racism and violence, and I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s directly related to Trump,\u201d said Mr. Abrahamov, 43. \u201cThis could be just what America is. \u201d \u201cOf course it\u2019s related to Trump,\u201d Ms. Abrahamov, 40, answered. \u201cNow that Trump came into power, all he does is support Israel. And I do not think Trump is someone who plays a double game. He just goes with his truth the whole way. \u201d \u201cBut in this case, his truth screws over Jews, and it also might screw over Israel,\u201d she said. It is causing a particular quandary for Mr. Netanyahu, who is charged with guiding the relationship, always deep and complicated, with Israel\u2019s closest ally. \u201cThe unenviable challenge facing the Israeli government is how to express its visceral horror over the resurgence of   in the U. S. without becoming a pawn in America\u2019s partisan debate or jeopardizing its critical working relationship with the administration,\u201d said Shalom Lipner, a former Israeli official and now a nonresident senior fellow with the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution. At a time of weakness for Mr. Netanyahu, amid several corruption investigations, he has found both political renewal and common cause with Mr. Trump. Many who share Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s politics thought that, finally, Israel had an American president who was an unconditional friend. Mr. Trump initially promised to move the American Embassy to Jerusalem, long a dream of many Israelis but opposed by Palestinians as a de facto recognition of Israel\u2019s annexation of East Jerusalem after the 1967 war. And Mr. Trump at first remained conspicuously silent as Mr. Netanyahu announced thousands of new Israeli settler units in the occupied West Bank and pushed through a contentious law granting retroactive legality to thousands of Israeli houses built on Palestinian property. But the president has distanced himself somewhat since then, raising questions about whether he would ultimately toe a more traditional American line on critical Israeli issues. The embassy move has been postponed at a minimum. At a news conference during their meeting, Mr. Trump publicly asked Mr. Netanyahu to \u201chold back on the settlements. \u201d At that same news conference, other apparent divisions rose: Mr. Trump pointedly refused to denounce   sentiment among some of his supporters  \u2014   and the next day he similarly refused, as he berated a religious Jewish reporter who asked a question about it. In turn, the prime minister faced much criticism here for being reluctant to take his own public stand against   in the United States  \u2014   apparently not wishing to anger Mr. Trump, or perhaps willing to give a pass, of sorts, to a sympathetic conservative. Mr. Netanyahu did, however, speak out on Wednesday, after Mr. Trump used the opening of his speech in Congress to denounce the attacks and threats. \u201c  certainly has not disappeared. But there is much we can do to fight back,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said in a videotaped address, praising Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, who has also spoken out against the attacks. Still, this has been a jarring time for Israelis of all political beliefs. Natan Sharansky, the former Soviet dissident and head of the Jewish Agency, said he did not blame Mr. Trump for the attacks, even if, he said, the president is \u201cclearly a reflection\u201d of rising nationalism generally. And while Mr. Sharansky said he was also troubled by the White House\u2019s failure to mention Jews in its statement this year on Holocaust Remembrance Day, he repeated his contention that   was not solely a problem of the right. \u201cWe saw a lot of this     feelings in the last 15 to 20 years,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd a lot of people were trying to separate it from the   of the right. In fact, this difference is erasing itself. \u201d Joni   61, moved here nearly 40 years ago from the United States and does not recall   as a problem, she said. Now vandals have toppled graves in the cemetery in St. Louis where her grandparents and many other members of her family are buried. \u201cIt validates that there should be an Israel, if these things can happen in the States,\u201d she said. Otherwise, she described her emotions as \u201cvery complicated. \u201d She has maintained her American passport and cast her ballot for Hillary Clinton. Yet she hopes Mr. Trump will fulfill his promises to broker a deal between the Israelis and the Palestinians. \u201cHowever,\u201d she added, \u201cI am still shocked by what he says every day. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561752.6367793}
