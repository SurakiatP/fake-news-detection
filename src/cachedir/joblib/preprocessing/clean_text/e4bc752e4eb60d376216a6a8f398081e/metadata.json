Although the court ruled in the opponents of the Trump order\u2019s favor, the law still was on Trump\u2019s side and that the Trump administration was using the \u201cvirtually the identical arguments\u201d the Obama administration had used in defense of its immigration policy. \u201cWell, it was a poorly crafted executive order, and it was a terrible rollout,\u201d Turley said. \u201cBut I still think that the law favors the administration once you get to the merits. I don\u2019t agree with many of those, some of those cases. But the courts have been highly deferential to the president, and they generally don\u2019t  . I think the people also have to acknowledge that the Trump administration here is making virtually the identical argument to the Obama administration. \u201d \u201cThe Obama administration argued the president\u2019s judgment on administration was largely unreviewable,\u201d he continued. \u201cHe argued that he could even refuse or order the failure to enforce immigration laws. But the arguments were very, very similar. And for all the Democrats objecting now, I didn\u2019t hear a peep of objection from them when just last year these arguments were being made by the same Justice Department. \u201d Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor'"}, "time": 1742561818.248086}
