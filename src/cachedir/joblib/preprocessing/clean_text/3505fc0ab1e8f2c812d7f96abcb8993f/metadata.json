[A Facebook post on the Black Lives Matter sponsored page titled \u201cStockton Police Department, Corruption Reporting Page,\u201d announced that a Stockton police officer was given a coffee order laced with spit.  \u201cWe are very happy to report that today this officer from Stockton Police Department got to have coffee at Starbucks with the public,\u201d The post reads, \u201cit was hot coffee according to our supporters served with a side of spit they even gave it to him with a smile and a nice comment. \u201d The post is accompanied by a photo of an officer and his wife and child and was posted on December 28 on a page that also features a banner that reads, \u201cThe thin blue line is a terrorist symbol. \u201d Many commenters at the page criticized the Black Lives Matter group for its cowardly and disgusting action, but the admin of the page replied to many stating they are proud of what they claimed happened. For instance, to one commenter who said, \u201cThat\u2019s wrong\u201d the admin replied, \u201cBut it feels so good. \u201d After the Facebook post made a stir, though, the local Starbucks said it investigated the incident and later reported saying they can find no evidence and no employee who perpetrated the spitting. \u201cWe are proud of our relationship with the Stockton Police Department, who initially notified us of this rumor. We can confirm there is absolutely no truth to this post, and we are disappointed with the suggestion,\u201d the local Starbucks said in a statement released to Fox 40 Sacramento. After the store\u2019s denial, the Black Lives Matter group insisted that store managers are lying and that the incident did, indeed, take place, but they won\u2019t say which employee did it so the employee won\u2019t face any repercussions. The group also claimed that another restaurant in the area does the same thing to orders by police officers, but the group refused to name the place. Commenters on the story were mostly negative toward the BLM group. Typical of the comments is the one from Kevin Dunleavy who said the BLM group is \u201cchildish. \u201d In another one, Richard Steinberg insisted the BLM group\u2019s smugness over the incident is \u201cfurther proof the BLM is full of haters. \u201d Meanwhile Carol Anderson said the incident made BLM out to be the terrorists and not the police.
