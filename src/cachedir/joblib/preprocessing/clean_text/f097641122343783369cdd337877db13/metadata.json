Though long forgotten, \u201cThe Jane Pauley Show\u201d was a program NBC spent millions on, and executives had very high hopes for it. Instead, it was a bust, and was yanked off the air after one season. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to have a career in television after that,\u201d Ms. Pauley said in a recent interview. For a while, it looked like she might be right. All anchors of a certain age  \u2014   particularly women  \u2014   are confronted with the reality of diminished opportunity, and even with a distinguished broadcasting career, Ms. Pauley was no exception. Over the course of the next several years, there were some work with PBS, the irregular appearance on \u201cToday\u201d where she profiled aging baby boomers, and little else. And then came an unexpected comeback. She signed on with CBS two years ago and started doing features for its popular \u201cSunday Morning\u201d program and filling in for various anchors, including on \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d and \u201cThe Evening News. \u201d And on Sunday she will triumphantly return to the spotlight: A couple weeks shy of 66, Ms. Pauley will formally succeed Charles Osgood as the anchor of \u201cSunday Morning. \u201d \u201cThere have been high points in my career, and low points as well,\u201d she said. \u201cBut even at the low points there have always been these rebounds. Like those trick birthday candles: It flickers off, and comes on again!\u201d Ms. Pauley was sitting on a couch at the CBS Broadcast Center, nursing a cup of tea to help her stave off a coughing fit. (She said she got a cold from her grandchildren by way of her husband, the \u201cDoonesbury\u201d creator Garry Trudeau.) She was quick to point out the fairly incredible timing of her \u201cSunday Morning\u201d debut: It will occur almost 40 years after her first day as a   on \u201cToday\u201d where, at 25, she followed Barbara Walters. Her first day at \u201cToday\u201d was Oct. 11, 1976. But as much as Ms. Pauley will be remembered for her broadcast accomplishments, it is her departures that have prompted more sensational headlines. \u201cI always make news by leaving,\u201d she said, laughing. Well before Ann Curry\u2019s disastrous departure from \u201cToday,\u201d in 2012, Ms. Pauley also left the show in acrimonious circumstances. NBC had brought in Deborah Norville to join Ms. Pauley and Bryant Gumbel in 1989. Ms. Pauley figured NBC had hired her replacement, and decided to act first: She announced shortly after Ms. Norville\u2019s arrival that she was leaving the show. The damage to NBC was significant. Viewers were repelled by what they perceived as Ms. Pauley being pushed out, and fled \u201cToday\u201d for \u201cGood Morning America\u201d on ABC. The magazine editor Michael Kinsley once said Ms. Pauley was \u201cthe first baby boomer they tried to put out to pasture   \u2026     and failed. \u201d Ms. Pauley stayed with NBC and moved onto a successful   run as   of the newsmagazine show \u201cDateline. \u201d But Ms. Pauley decided it was time to do something different, and in 2003 announced she would leave that show. NBC was caught off guard by her decision and what followed was yet another wave of warm publicity for her. NBC\u2019s parent company found a way to get her to stay. \u201cI think NBC noticed I\u2019m getting all this attention and then came to me with the offer of a daytime show,\u201d she said. Ms. Pauley has long been praised for exuding normalness on camera (\u201cShe\u2019s as skilled a prompter reader as anyone I\u2019ve worked with in 40 years in the business,\u201d said Michael Weisman, the producer of her daytime show). That skill set did not carry over for her talk show. \u201cPeople respected her and liked her, but she wasn\u2019t relatable to the typical daytime audience,\u201d Mr. Weisman said. \u201cShe was somebody who you would go to for career advice, not the girlfriend who you\u2019d go to for cooking tips or weight loss tips or who\u2019s dating who. \u201d Ms. Pauley said she was proud of the show, but even she acknowledged that it was a failure. And that is when she entered what she describes as her \u201cfallow period. \u201d She returned to \u201cToday\u2019\u2019 with a    segment about baby boomers. In 2014, she published a book, \u201cYour Life Calling: Reimagining the Rest of Your Life,\u201d that was inspired by those spots. The AARP paid for and sponsored the segment  \u2014   which is why Ms. Pauley says she believes \u201cToday\u201d broadcast it  \u2014   but just as she was beginning her book tour, the AARP said it was ending its commitment. Once again, Ms. Pauley was a television personality without a television job. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a tremendous disappointment but it was a little awkward in that I was on book tour talking about the future and I didn\u2019t have one,\u201d she said. Until she did again. While promoting her book, she was featured on \u201cSunday Morning. \u201d That is when CBS producers noticed something unusual: Emails were pouring in from viewers about how much they enjoyed the segment. CBS signed her as a contributor. Ms. Pauley leapt at the chance, and what was a modest commitment soon turned into steady work. When Mr. Osgood, the      host of \u201cSunday Morning,\u201d was ready to step aside after more than two decades, CBS turned to Ms. Pauley. David Rhodes, the CBS News president, said that Ms. Pauley\u2019s range, reputation and warmth made her the right steward for the job. \u201cSunday Morning\u201d is the highest rated show on Sunday mornings, and CBS needs it to stay that way. \u201cAs much as you always want to bring new viewers to a program, this broadcast has a very dedicated audience,\u201d Mr. Rhodes said. \u201cYou can\u2019t chase them away. \u201d Ms. Pauley said that there would be few changes to the quirky show and that she was confident of one thing: she would be a good fit as anchor, she said repeatedly during the interview. And after a stretch where TV work was hard to come by, she said she\u2019s soaking it all in now. \u201cWhere I come from  \u2014   which is Indiana, and I\u2019m a Hoosier five generations both sides  \u2014   you do not boast or brag,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s an old joke of mine that the only thing we\u2019re entitled to brag about is our humility. I\u2019ve been dragging that around my whole career by apologizing, or saying \u2018Oh, I\u2019m so lucky. \u2019\u201d She started laughing and added, \u201cI seem to be over that. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561713.3253512}
