We can\u2019t beat George Bush unless we appeal to a broad cross-section of Democrats.\u201d Of course, such a gross violation of liberal class and cultural markers could not be permitted, and Dean was forced to grovel and apologize by the dominant identitarian wing of the Democrat Party and then, when his fifty-state strategy won Democrats control of Congress in 2006, instantly defenestrated by Rahm Emanuel, among others, and his organization gutted by Tim Kaine . When Chomsky asks \u201cWhy are we failing to organize these people?\u201d he\u2019s asking a question to which Dean already gave the answer. \\nClinton, of course, thinks that organizing \u201cthese people\u201d is a bad idea, which is why she called them \u201cdeplorable\u201d and \u201cirredeemable\u201d (and if you\u2019re a Christian, as Clinton purports to be, \u201cirredeemable\u201d means irredeemable). So do many of her supporters, who seem to labor under the twin delusions that (a) \u201cthese people\u201d will go away on the morning of November 9, and that (b) calling them, in various ways, stupid is, as a strategy, full of #win. If Clinton wishes to fail during a legitimacy crisis, she and her supporters should go on exactly as they have begun. Personally, I\u2019m not a \u201cworse is better\u201d guy (too much suffering), but I confess I see little prospect of the dominant faction in the Democrat Party changing its ways, Dean, Chomsky, or no. \\nBy Alexandra Rosenmann, AlterNet associate editor. Originally published in Alternet . \\nIn the past 15 months, Noam Chomsky has weighed in on the U.S. presidential race often. \\n\u201cThere are differences in the parties,\u201d he said in February, when asked if he\u2019d even consider a Republican over Hillary Clinton. \u201cSmall differences [coupled with] great power can have enormous consequences.\u201d \\nChomsky initally favored Sanders over Clinton, but insisted Democrats must win at all costs. Because according to Chomsky , if Trump wins \u201cthe human species is in very deep trouble. \\nBut as for Trump\u2019s supporters, Chomsky\u2019s not counting them out just yet. \\n\u201cI\u2019m basically judging by what I see and read about them listening to talk radio and so on,\u201d Chomsky admitted of the protests on the right. \u201cBut my strong impression is that these [right-wing protesters] are people with very real grievances.\u201d \\n\u201cThey give the impression of being a hard-working serious people who think they\u2019ve been doing everything right. They\u2019ve been doing what they\u2019re \u2018supposed\u2019 to do [as] god-fearing hard-working, gun-carrying, you know patriotic, Americans,\u201d Chomsky continued. \\n\u201cWhat are they doing wrong and how come their lives are so crummy?\u201d Chomsky asked. \\nIt\u2019s a question that has plagued the election. \\n\u201cThey\u2019re not getting answers,\u201d Chomsky insisted. \u201cThe answers they are getting are not only crazy, but extremely dangerous, so the right response is to ask ourselves, why are we failing to organize these people?\u201d \\nThere\u2019s nothing partisan about losing money to Wall Street or lacking health insurance; issues at the forefront of protests from both sides for nearly a decade. \\n\u201cWe have not succeeded in unifying people,\u201d Chomsky noted. \u201cIt\u2019s our fault.\u201d \\nWatch:'"}, "time": 1742564283.7738266}
