She was the eighth and penultimate child of Joseph and Rose Kennedy, shyer than most of the others, a sidekick to her siblings. Now, as Jean Kennedy Smith notes in her wistful memoir, \u201cThe Nine of Us: Growing Up Kennedy,\u201d she\u2019s the only one left. That\u2019s reason enough to dip into this graceful if gossamer book. Her   grandfathers who rose to power in Boston politics get their due, but \u201cThe Nine of Us\u201d really begins in Hyannis Port, the playground and testament to Joe Kennedy\u2019s great success, first as a banker and stock picker, then as a Hollywood financier, and above all as an investor who knew when to get out: right about the time Jean was born in 1928. Jean is too proper, of course, to address her parents\u2019 marriage in any but the most reverent terms. The patriarch rarely at home in his striving days, romancing Gloria Swanson among so many others, is only the wise and devoted father here. Rose\u2019s unconcern at their long times apart  \u2014   their separate vacations, even  \u2014   is no less a mystery than before. This is the   story of children who made their beds, did chores, came to dinner at exactly quarter past 7 and endured both parents\u2019 endless interrogatories about global events of the day. Jean\u2019s brother Teddy, in his far weightier memoir \u201cTrue Compass,\u201d has already worked this ground, as have scores of biographers, but Jean has a few new stories of her own. Locked one day in a closet for stealing a cookie, she waited  \u2014   and waited. Suddenly the door opened and in rolled Teddy, youngest of the nine, for some infraction of his own. Once again, the door was shut and locked. Her mother, Jean realized, had forgotten she was there. To dry their tears, Jean started playing  . \u201cTeddy,\u201d I said, \u201cdo you think we will ever get out of this closet? Or do you think we\u2019ll be like Amelia Earhart, stuck here forever?\u201d Teddy giggled, she reports, and off they sailed to the isle where Earhart awaited them. When their mother at last let Teddy out, she did a   at seeing Jean, too, but nothing more. \u201cMother,\u201d she writes, \u201cwas not about to admit her mistake. \u201d It\u2019s fun, too, to see statecraft through the eyes of an    girl. By l935, Joe Kennedy had worn out his welcome with President Roosevelt, despite his brilliance in building the Securities and Exchange Commission: To Roosevelt, the Boston banker was a braggart. Still, Kennedy held some sway over the Irish Catholic vote best to keep him in thrall. When Kennedy mentioned to the president his son Bobby\u2019s stamp collection, Roosevelt knew just what to do. \u201cRoosevelt was himself an avid collector,\u201d Jean explains, \u201cand he found a moment . \u2019u2008. \u2019u2008. to dictate a note to Bobby. \u201d Later, when Roosevelt invited all the Kennedys to the Oval Office, Bobby walked in clutching his album. \u201cPresident Roosevelt was delighted,\u201d Jean recalls. \u201cThe two of them moved to the large desk, where the leader of the free world brought out his stamp collection, too. There they lingered, the president and the boy, necks craned over their albums. \u201d For his good offices, Kennedy asked to be named ambassador to the Court of St. \u2019u202fJames\u2019s. Roosevelt reportedly laughed at the thought: No one was less diplomatic than Joe Kennedy. But fine, let him hang himself. And so, in l938, the Kennedys arrived in London to a roaring welcome. No one had ever seen such a large and dazzling brood. The eldest son, Joe Jr. and Jack stayed back at Harvard, but the rest of the children became social stars there, including Jean, who at age 10 attended a boarding school outside London. (The choice seems stern, but Jean never complained: No whining was the family rule.) Even Rosemary, third of the nine, managed at age 20 to get through her social debut despite a mental handicap that left her ever further behind her siblings. Jean, unsurprisingly, says nothing about the circumstances surrounding the end of her father\u2019s ambassadorship  \u2014   that his pleas for appeasement with Hitler had outlasted even Chamberlain\u2019s. She does note that Rosemary stayed on with her father when Britain declared war on Germany and the rest of the family went home. \u201cDad felt he needed to stay in England, . \u2019u2008. \u2019u2008. and she was doing so well at a school there, better than she ever had before. \u201d Yet two years later, Papa Kennedy decided that Rosemary should have a new and promising but radical treatment: a frontal lobotomy. Jean omits any mention of it in her narrative. Only in an epilogue  \u2014   could it have been at an editor\u2019s insistence?  \u2014   does she acknowledge that the operation went \u201ctragically wrong,\u201d leaving Rosemary with difficulties walking or communicating. In the Kennedy clan, each older sibling was made guardian of a younger one. Jean\u2019s guardian was Joe Jr. oldest and most promising of the lot. Vividly, she recalls the summer day in l944 when two priests came up the driveway with news that Joe, a Navy pilot, had been killed in action. Jean recalls riding her bike to church to cry and pray, then going to the local hospital where she worked as a volunteer. \u201cWhat else could I do?\u201d Four years later, death took a second of the nine: Kathleen, or Kick, whose small plane went down over France. Kick\u2019s lover, a dashing (and married) Brit, was with her, having pushed the pilot to brave an oncoming storm. Greater depths, for all these tragedies, simply go unplumbed. The Kennedys have never been ones for public expressions of grief. Jean ends her memoir on the high note of Jack\u2019s presidency, after introducing her college roommate Ethel Skakel to Bobby (\u201cThe rest is history\u201d) marrying the businessman and political strategist Stephen Smith, and doing all she can with her siblings to get Jack elected. Left to the epilogue are the assassinations, along with Joe\u2019s devastating stroke. Of later painful episodes  \u2014   Chappaquiddick, her son William Kennedy Smith\u2019s rape trial, Teddy\u2019s brain cancer, her sister Patricia Lawford\u2019s fight with cancer and more  \u2014   there is no mention. We can rue how much goes unsaid here, even about those Hyannis Port summers of the l930s and l940s. Or we can concede that the last Kennedy of her generation has the right to tell the story she wishes, and let it go at that. Slim as this volume is, it still makes for engaging reading  \u2014   say, on a front porch by the sea, in that quiet time after lunch when the Kennedy children, at their parents\u2019 insistence, read in their rooms every day, before the years when they lit up the sky.'"}, "time": 1742563514.4487321}
