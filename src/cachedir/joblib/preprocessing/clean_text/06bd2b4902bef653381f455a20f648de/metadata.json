That dream is turning out mostly to be a mirage. This week, Mr. Choi\u2019s company, WrkRiot, began unraveling in a highly public fashion. Its former head of marketing revealed that the   had been mired in internal chaos and had sometimes paid employees in cashier\u2019s checks before delaying payment altogether. She also alleged that Mr. Choi had forged wire transfer documents to make it look as if compensation were on the way. By late Tuesday, WrkRiot had taken itself offline. The veracity of Mr. Choi\u2019s credentials are now also in question. While WrkRiot is not widely known, the  \u2019s collapse has gripped Silicon Valley. Mr. Choi\u2019s situation may be extreme, but the company\u2019s implosion has a familiar ring to many who came west to be the next Mark Zuckerberg  \u2014   but ended up instead at the next WrkRiot. Silicon Valley is always eager to celebrate its success stories, but the reality is that numerous tiny   that few ever hear about form the tech industry\u2019s dysfunctional underbelly. \u201cWith the exception of the alleged fraud, almost anyone who has worked at a   has experienced most everything that went wrong at WrkRiot,\u201d said Semil Shah, a   investor based in Menlo Park, Calif. \u201cPeople don\u2019t realize the word   is a broad concept that includes everything from a proven entrepreneur raising $15 million to a guy with money from friends and family. \u201d To an outsider, he said, \u201cthey\u2019re both the same. \u201d On Hacker News, an online forum for techies, WrkRiot\u2019s tale has exploded into one of the most popular threads, attracting more than 500 comments, including one from a poster who said that the  \u2019s experience \u201cis pretty much a rite of passage here. \u201d Tech blogs have also seized the tale one called it \u201cone of the ugliest   stories we\u2019ve ever heard. \u201d Penny Kim, the former head of marketing at WrkRiot who wrote about her experience at the company, including the forgery allegations, said, \u201cI\u2019d heard stories about late paychecks or   failing, but who expects fraud in Silicon Valley?\u201d WrkRiot terminated Ms. Kim\u2019s employment in   after she filed a wage claim. She has since filed a retaliation complaint against the company and moved to Dallas, where she previously lived. In an interview this week, Mr. Choi, 35, said WrkRiot, which is based in Santa Clara, Calif. near where Intel has its headquarters, was \u201clike any company. If you want to talk   all   have problems. \u201d When asked about the forgery claims, Mr. Choi said Ms. Kim was a disgruntled employee who was fired for cause and that the accusations were \u201cunfair to my guys. \u201d Along with the   Mr. Choi\u2019s personal credibility is on the line. As he built WrkRiot, the entrepreneur said that he graduated from the Stern School of Business at New York University and that he worked at J. P. Morgan for nearly four years as an analyst. N. Y. U. and J. P. Morgan both said they had no record of Mr. Choi. At least one company listed on his LinkedIn profile also could not be found. Mr. Choi, whose LinkedIn profile has since been wiped clean, did not respond to questions about his r\u00e9sum\u00e9. His lawyer, Bernard Fishman, said he was not aware of the allegations against WrkRiot until contacted by The New York Times. Mr. Choi set up his   in June 2015 under the name 1For. One, with a mission of helping people find the perfect job online. He brought in advisers with expertise in recruiting and data science and eventually hired nearly 20 employees, including Chinese nationals under work visas. The company later changed its name to JobSonic with a tagline, \u201cFinally, a lightning fast job platform that cares. \u201d Eventually, the   settled on the   name of WrkRiot. Mr. Choi said the company had not raised any money from venture capital firms but that he had \u201ca bunch of private investors who are    individuals who believe in the company. \u201d He said one investor was related to him and one was not, but would not say how much money the company had. WrkRiot\u2019s former chief technology officer and   Al Brown, said Mr. Choi had intended to put $2 million of his own money into the company, but that only $400, 000 materialized. \u201cI did not find out till the beginning of August that the money for the last payroll came from one of the employees,\u201d Mr. Brown wrote in online comments this week. In Ms. Kim\u2019s post about her experience at the company, which she did not initially identify but later confirmed was WrkRiot, she wrote that the   without consulting her, hired someone who would report to her, did not plan ahead on its business  \u2014   and had no idea what its business really was  \u2014   and was repeatedly turned down by investors. The chief executive, later identified as Mr. Choi, also borrowed money from employees, she said. \u201cNothing about that   surprises me anymore and it all seems like a horrible nightmare I was lucky enough to wake up from,\u201d she wrote. Since Ms. Kim\u2019s disclosures, others have told her they were also shortchanged by  . Michelle Young, the founder of the online travel guide Untapped Cities, reached out to Ms. Kim to tell her about an undisclosed   that bought ad space from her company  \u2014   but then stopped paying. Ms. Young was eventually offered $40, 000 in guaranteed business by the   if she agreed to a nondisparagement clause. She did not sign and is still waiting for some of the money she is owed. \u201cAt some point the checks stopped coming,\u201d said Ms. Young. \u201cThere were warning signs. Offers that seemed too good to be true. \u201d After Ms. Kim\u2019s post, several of WrkRiot\u2019s advisers and former employees moved to distance themselves from the company. Daniel Tunkelang, a former WrkRiot adviser who has worked at LinkedIn and been a consultant at Pinterest, terminated his relationship with the company and wrote in a blog post, \u201cI should have gotten to know the company and its leadership better before associating myself with them and lending them my credibility. \u201d At WrkRiot, a handful of the  \u2019s remaining 10 or so employees gathered on Tuesday night to discuss their situation, according to a person who attended the gathering and spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was concerned about retaliation. A few were hopeful that Mr. Choi could save the company. Some of the Chinese nationals whose work visas are tied to their employment said their visa extensions were in limbo, partly because WrkRiot had missed a payment to the   company ADP, making it impossible for the government to verify their employment through ADP. By then, WrkRiot had shut down its website, its Facebook page and its Twitter account. Many of the employees are now hunting for other Silicon Valley   jobs.'"}, "time": 1742561858.7768402}
