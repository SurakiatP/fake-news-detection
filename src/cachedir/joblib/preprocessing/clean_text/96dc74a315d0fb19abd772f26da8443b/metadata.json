[The posters, which declare that some girls have penises and some boys have vulvas, have appeared at bus stops and metro stations across the Basque Country and Navarre.  Created by transgender advocacy group Chrysallis Euskal Herria, the images have appeared in major cities such as Pamplona, San Sebasti\u00e1n, Bilbao and Vitoria, with the backing of local government. They show four naked children holding hands, including one boy with female genitalia and one girl with male genitalia. Underneath, a slogan reads: \u201cThere are girls with penises and boys with vulvas. It\u2019s as simple as that. \u201d Beatriz Sever, the group\u2019s press officer, said they were designed to \u201craise social awareness about transgender children and for these children to feel represented\u201d. \u201cThere is an evident gap in society\u2019s ability to approach the issue of transgender children in a normal way,\u201d she told El Pa\u00eds. \u201cThe more we talk, the easier it will be for some parents to detect what is happening to their own children. Many of them deny their kids\u2019 real identity simply out of ignorance. \u201d The poster campaign was made possible by a 28, 000 euro donation from an anonymous New York businessman. The organisation said he donated the money after reading about an earlier campaign where they handed out educational material in eight different languages. Ms. Sever defended the group\u2019s depiction of naked children, saying: \u201cIt makes all the difference between children either being accepted or not. We need to make people understand that nature is not a photocopying machine. Those who deny their identity typically use genitals as an excuse. I myself, as a mother, once used that same argument, until I finally understood what was going on. \u201d The ongoing drive to push transgender ideology onto children is causing concern from some quarters. A report by two   psychiatrists last August found most children and teenagers who claim to be transgender change their minds as they grow up. It also warned parents and officials not to impose   surgery or treatment on children, saying: \u201cThere is no evidence that all children who express   thoughts or behavior should be encouraged to become transgender. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561889.9046752}
