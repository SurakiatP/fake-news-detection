He spent 16 hours in a Baton Rouge jail cell until he was released Sunday afternoon, vowing to continue demonstrating because he was convinced that the authorities want activists to be \u201ctoo afraid to protest. \u201d Mr. Mckesson, in a telephone interview shortly after his release, said he believed that his arrest was unlawful and that the police unfairly conducted mass arrests while people were peacefully assembled and out of the way of traffic along a highway. In a booking record, Baton Rouge authorities said Mr. Mckesson ignored a police officer\u2019s order to stay out of the road and as a result was charged with simple obstruction of a highway of commerce. He was released on his own recognizance. On Sunday night, he was at the Triple S convenience store, where Mr Sterling was shot a week ago, and which on this night was distinctly devoid of police officers after tense protests downtown hours earlier. \u201cThe police want protesters to be too afraid to protest, which is why they intentionally created a context of conflict, and I\u2019ll never be afraid to tell the truth,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we saw in Baton Rouge was a police department that chose to provoke protesters to create, like, a context of conflict they could exploit. \u201d He said that officers chased several protesters and that he had retained a lawyer. He added that he and others jailed remain committed to the Black Lives Matter movement and would continue to use civil disobedience to make their points. Mr. Mckesson and several others traveled to Baton Rouge to protest the death of Alton Sterling, who was fatally shot early Tuesday. The authorities arrested more than 100 people in connection with a protest outside the city\u2019s police headquarters, charging most of them with obstructing the road. Eight firearms were confiscated and one officer lost several teeth after he was struck by a projectile, the police said. At a news conference in Baton Rouge, law enforcement officials defended arresting people who had stepped onto a highway against police commands, saying that streets had been closed for marches elsewhere but that this was a major thoroughfare and needed to remain open. \u201cWe certainly respect the right people have to gather peacefully, to protest peacefully and we\u2019re going to protect that right,\u201d said Sheriff Sid J. Gautreaux III of East Baton Rouge Parish. \u201cAt the same time we\u2019re not going to tolerate any violence, we\u2019re not going to tolerate any lawlessness, we\u2019re not going to tolerate any destruction of property. \u201d Mr. Mckesson filmed his encounter with the police using the   app Periscope. On camera, he told viewers that there was no sidewalk where they were walking. An officer could be heard shouting, \u201cYou with them loud shoes, I see you in the road. If I get close to you, you\u2019re going to jail. \u201d \u201cI think he\u2019s talking to me, y\u2019all,\u201d said Mr. Mckesson, who often wears red sneakers to demonstrations. Later, Mr. Mckesson said, \u201cWatch the police, they are just literally provoking people. \u201d Then, about five minutes into the broadcast, the video becomes shaky and a police officer can be heard saying: \u201cCity police. You\u2019re under arrest. Don\u2019t fight me. Don\u2019t fight me. \u201d Sunday night, Mr. Mckesson said once he was taken into custody he was put in a van with dozens of others and was able to use another person\u2019s phone to text people about what happened. He was eventually taken to East Baton Rouge Parish Prison. There he was at times housed with some 50 other men who took turns sitting on packed benches and sleeping on the floor. \u201cNot everybody could fit,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of us had to stand. I, like many other people, slept on the floor or didn\u2019t sleep at all because there just wasn\u2019t enough room. \u201d After hours, Mr. Mckesson and others were then told to change into   jumpsuits and were fed a breakfast of orange juice, oatmeal and pastries. While inside, Mr. Mckesson was able to make several calls to his lawyers and friends to strategize how to be released. Mr. Mckesson, 31, a public school administrator turned activist, first gained national notice with his blunt critiques on Twitter of the police response in Ferguson, Mo. after the death of Michael Brown in 2014. He ran for mayor of Baltimore, his hometown, this year, ultimately losing the Democratic primary in April to Catherine E. Pugh.'"}, "time": 1742628293.612555}
