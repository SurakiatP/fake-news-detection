The spring 2017 men\u2019s wear shows are almost over, for goodness sake, and women\u2019s wear is still in the middle of cruise  . \u201cCruise?\u201d you ask. \u201cHuh?\u201d Exactly. Cruise  \u2014   a. k. a. prespring, a. k. a. resort  \u2014   are the clothes that arrive in November and stay on shelves through March and sometimes even April. The shows began May 3 with Chanel, an extravaganza in Havana that included 86 looks, some tourism and some controversy, and they extend through next month  \u2014   yes, into the couture fall   season. There is no cohesion to the cruise collections. They include   clothes as well as fur   (Chanel, Vuitton, Dior, Gucci) as well as small presentations some brands (Chanel, among others) that want to publicize and some (Proenza Schouler, C\u00e9line) that don\u2019t, at least until it hits stores. So I gave up trying to make sense of it. Instead, I thought I\u2019d take you along for what is necessarily a somewhat arbitrary ride. After all, in the end we each pack our own bags. May 11   which I watched via livestream (the concept of traveling to an exotic destination for a single show being the kind of seduction that best serves clients, not critics) the emails are starting to pile up, listing presentations in   corners of New York. I feel like Tippi Hedren being swarmed by the birds. May 19 Today is Oscar de la Renta day. The label does a series of minishows in its showroom with the creative director Peter Copping, in front of 20 to 30 people at a time. This season, there were 33 looks, which Mr. Copping says were inspired by the idea of \u201cpatchwork,\u201d translated through a very luxe lens. Think of baby florals and tweeds and jacquards lace and feathers. That contrast, between a casual idea and an elaborate expression, pretty much summed up the mood of the collection: classic (and classy) de la Rentaisms with the stuffing taken out. May 23 Trying to keep track of who is doing what, I email Burberry, which has had small presentations in the past. The company says it is not doing anything this year because it is jettisoning the idea of seasons altogether and has rejiggered its schedule to show men\u2019s wear and women\u2019s wear together in September and sell the clothes immediately after it shows them. Stella McCartney, who used to be famous for her cruise   has decided to show the collection in November in London, before it goes on sale. Mary Katrantzou is taking her collection on the road to New York, but they are not allowing me to tell you about the clothes before they are in stores on pain of Great Brand Excommunication. (Spoiler: they are cheerful.) Diane von Furstenberg\u2019s office calls to tell me that because it just hired Jonathan Saunders as its first chief creative officer, it isn\u2019t having a resort presentation, because he won\u2019t have had a chance to put his stamp on the collection. May 28 This is the week of the  . Today, Louis Vuitton is in Rio Zika and political unrest be damned! The brand rules the social media waves. On May 31 and June 2, Dior and Gucci hold their shows in Britain (in Blenheim Palace and Westminster Abbey, respectively). I watch them all on my computer and try to run the numbers on what it costs to bring an entire fashion show to an exotic locale. I am boggled. The brands say it is worth it. June 6 Back in New York, Narciso Rodriguez is at 9:30 a. m.: Lexington and 16th Street. He is interested in \u201csplicing\u201d  \u2014   i. e. cutting in ever more deceptively simple, but actually highly complicated, ways. See, for example, a   gown in heavy silk satin with the weft running in two different directions, so some of the fabric looks glossy and other bits matte. If Veronica Lake had a Modernist moment, she\u2019d be in heaven. Or this dress. Across town on 11th Avenue, some Brits have touched down: Christopher Kane (  pansies, including big lace mitochondrial petal \u201cblobs\u201d inset randomly on iridescent pleated skirts) and Peter Pilotto (haute peasant, with technical taffeta and Peruvian rug embroidery). June 7 \u201cCalling this \u2018cruise\u2019 is an error. It should be called \u2018destination. \u2019\u201d Michael Kors is doing his version of    \u2014   the cruise collection explanation monologue. The destinations he has in mind? \u201cGstaad, Mustique, Palm Beach, Palm Springs or destination \u2018God forbid it\u2019s snowing and I need a new wool coat. \u2019\u201d Some more of his morsels: \u201cA fox wellie is the kind of basic boot every girl needs. \u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t sell bathing suits people swim in. These are bathing suits people wear in party situations. It\u2019s the new cocktail dress. \u201d He is feeling graphics, especially polka dots and grommets. \u201cHow do you cut through the winter doldrums? Graphic is the way to go. \u201d Marc Jacobs, fresh from his CFDA women\u2019s wear designer of the year award, thinks 1980s MTV is the way to go, in 54 superbright,   looks. (Can this be a coincidence? 54 looks? Studio 54?) The show was supposed to start at 9 a. m. sharp, but during the awards ceremony the night before, we kept getting emailed updates: maybe 9:30, actually 10. Guess you can do that when you win one for the sixth time. At Suno, Erin Beatty and Max Osterweis went on a trip around Africa with a nod to Edwardiana via plaid linen and eyelet, denim and shirting overembroidered with florals, big    ruffles paired with generous trousers and full skirts. At Coach, Stuart Vevers was feeling Felix the Cat (the brand made a deal with DreamWorks to use the image) adding him to the rest of the label\u2019s building blocks: prairie dresses, motorcycle jackets, shearling and dinosaurs, used this time instead of Izod alligators on cardigans. What\u2019s up with that? \u201cIt\u2019s actually not that \u201d Mr. Vevers said. \u201cI like that it\u2019s kind of random. \u201d That\u2019s the thing about cruise: Ask most designers what it is about and they say: \u201cClothes you wear. \u201d That sounds absurd, since all clothes are theoretically clothes you wear. But what they actually mean is: not clothes you pose in, clothes you depend on. Think of it that way. Public School is not actually doing cruise: It is combining men\u2019s and women\u2019s wear, and spring and   respectively. It is making a statement about the fashion system and the political system. \u201cWe need leaders\u201d is   on a wall at the end of the show. The wall is apparently supposed to represent \u201cfalse monuments. \u201d The show is presumably supposed to represent the future, or the clothes of the rebelling masses. Mostly it feels confused, though the pieces themselves were pretty simple: dystopian tailoring and designer anoraks, accessorized with slashes and asymmetry, accented with   yellow and a melting flower photo print. June 9: \u201cIt\u2019s good not to always do something new,\u201d says Joseph Altuzarra, in his studio during his  . \u201cSometimes you want to speak a language that you\u2019ve already established. \u201d His vernacular has to do with pencil skirts,   plaid shirtdresses, trompe l\u2019oeil lingerie knits, pastel lace and ribbed stretch cardigans laced with faux leather. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to clean that way,\u201d he says. June 13: It\u2019s the Monday after the Friday before, which is to say: after the Moschino show in Los Angeles, which was a combined  \u2019s wear show (with tickets sold to the public for up to $400, list price) along with models (Miranda Kerr, Chanel Iman) celebrities (Katy Perry, Caitlyn Jenner) and 1960s cartoon psychedelia (miniskirts, mirror mosaics, flower power and animal print). Now Valentino is in the former Warhol Factory on Union Square. Like Chanel, it is having a Cuba moment, though its Cuba is a Cuba of the mind. The designers Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pierpaolo Piccioli were thinking about the way Cuba is frozen in the imagination, which led them to their own past, which led them to red, a nod to the favorite color of the label\u2019s founder, but in washed brocade and silk to give the clothes the soft focus of age, plus Tropicana bomber jackets and skirts and dresses encrusted in wooden   and, well, a lot more. The Factory is jammed with jersey and lace and camouflage and khaki. The work is eye boggling. Designers spend a lot of time complaining these days about their lack of time, but these two seem exhilarated by it. Rag  Bone is in its studio in the meatpacking district. Marcus Wainwright, the     is there, waxing laconic on the stripy knits, tuxedo track pants, airy   and shearlings that are the label\u2019s signatures. David Neville, the   executive, is not there. This doesn\u2019t seem odd, since Marcus is in charge of the design studio. But when they announce two days later that Mr. Neville is leaving the company, it suddenly seems full of portent. June 16 Carolina Herrera, in her 35th year in business, is living the fairy tale. Her resort collection is an enchanting confection of sparkling tulle cocktail and evening gowns in shades from nude to graphic     \u2014   plus a few denim numbers for day and a terrific pair of wide peach taffeta trousers to wear with a white cashmere sweater striped in sequins. Coincidentally, or probably not, Mrs. Herrera has a new design team  \u2014   Fernando Garcia and Laura Kim of Monse  \u2014   and they did even   trousers in their own collection, as well as khaki coat dresses and bandanna frocks twisted, pulled and otherwise chopped up in unexpected angles. In any case, Mrs. Herrera isn\u2019t around to discuss her role as resort\u2019s fairy godmother because she\u2019s at a spa in Austria with her husband. Too bad. I could have used a magic wand to transport me to different shores: On June 29, Creatures of the Wind, based in New York, is having a resort show at Spencer House in London. July 3 I know we haven\u2019t actually gotten here yet in real time, but it\u2019s already on my calendar: Miu Miu is unveiling its cruise line in Paris with a   event. Later this week, C\u00e9line will be showing its line. I can see it, though no pictures will be released until it goes into stores in November. Ditto Proenza Schouler and Chlo\u00e9. But at that point I\u2019ll be cycling back in fashion time (though forward in real time) to fall 2016, with couture. Enough is enough. I know this is a time of unpredictable weather patterns, but it seems to me that when a new season begins, it\u2019s time for the old one to end.'"}, "time": 1742564529.0510314}
