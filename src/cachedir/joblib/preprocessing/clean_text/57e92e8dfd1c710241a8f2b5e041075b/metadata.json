One of the states she leads in is Arizona \u2013 a red state before Republicans nominated Trump. \\nTo put things in perspective, Barack Obama was leading Mitt Romney by just a single percentage point on this day in 2012. That is what you call a close presidential contest, and Obama still went on to easily win. \\nYet, as I write, CNN and other cable news networks continue to plaster the \u201cclose race\u201d chyron all over their networks, claiming Donald Trump is making it a race again. \\nHere\u2019s the thing: the contest between Clinton and Trump may be naturally tightening in a few polls, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s becoming a close race. It\u2019s clear that, despite any one poll showing Trump gaining ground, Clinton still has a pretty durable lead. | @FiveThirtyEight tackles question everyone is asking: Is the Presidential race tightening? (Answer: Not by much.) https://t.co/XoMxzleajd pic.twitter.com/Gq5O47rNsv \\n\u2014 Jim Roberts (@nycjim) October 26, 2016 \\nWhile the media looks silly for trying to make the Clinton-Trump race seem like a nail-biter for the ages, there is also some good that can come of it \u2013 besides high TV ratings. \\nClinton supporters who may have previously assumed the race was in the bag for their candidate and were becoming complacent now may recognize, at least if they watch cable news, that the \u201crace is becoming close again.\u201d \\nThis should provide a last-minute boost of energy among voters who fear a Trump presidency.'"}, "time": 1742561862.5905354}
