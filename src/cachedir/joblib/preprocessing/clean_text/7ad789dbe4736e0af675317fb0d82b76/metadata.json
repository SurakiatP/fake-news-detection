[According to a press release from CBS, \u201cThe Big Bang Theory,\u201d the brainy sitcom which references pyramids and autotrophs in its theme song, beat out NBC\u2019s Sunday Night Football as the   live, primetime same day show. For the past five years Sunday Night Football had owned that coveted, top spot.  Now, there\u2019s a caveat to this. According to The Comeback, \u201c  \u2026    this data factors in live+3 and live+7 viewings (from later in the week) so given how close it is and how sports are typically watched more live than scripted TV, SNF is probably ahead in live+sameday still. That\u2019s important for advertisers, so it may still pull in more per spot. However, it\u2019s worth mentioning that SNF won the overall crown last year even with live+7 factored in, and TBBT has passed it there now. \u201d \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d has at drawn statistically even with the NFL, if not surpassed it, which represents a clear change from the past   where SNF dominated thoroughly. Steven Perlberg of The Wall Street Journal wrote about this trend in November, \u201cA pair of CBS programs were the   shows of 2016, dethroning NBC\u2019s \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d as the     primetime program on television, according to a new report from Nielsen. \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d averaged 19. 94 million viewers this year, followed by 19. 89 million for \u201cNCIS\u201d and 19. 28 million for \u201cSunday Night Football,\u201d which last year topped the list with an average of 23. 29 million people tuning in. The report measured live viewing plus seven days of delayed viewing. \u201cNBC said that \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d is averaging 20. 08 million viewers this year when factoring in live and same day viewing for games through Dec. 12, while the Nielsen report only covered contests through Nov. 6. \u201d Even if \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d wasn\u2019t breathing down SNF\u2019s neck, the fact that one of the NFL\u2019s premier television offerings has lost over three million viewers from last year should cause major concern for the league. In fairness, it\u2019s not like Sunday Night Football lost to \u201cThe Real Housewives of Sheboygan,\u201d or whatever. \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d has consistently been one of the most watched shows on television. Given that, the NFL should not feel ashamed by any of this. However, what the league absolutely should freak out about is the clear loss of their \u201cfavored nation\u201d status among viewers. In 2016, the NFL got taught the lesson that they can\u2019t just wheel out a bad product, court   player activists, and expect people to salivate over watching their games. That\u2019s the lesson, will the jocks learn from it? Well, that\u2019s another question entirely. For now though, it appears the nerds have gotten their revenge.
