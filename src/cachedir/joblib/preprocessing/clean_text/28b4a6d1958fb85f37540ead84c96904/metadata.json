Below is what Sperandeo had to say . \\nVictor Sperandeo: \u201cThe days of low interest rates are over. This is very important for people to understand, Eric. There will be no more lowering of interest rates and QEs\u2026 IMPORTANT: To find out which company the richest man in China has invested in, one that Rick Rule and Sprott Asset Management are pounding the table on that is quickly being recognized as one of the greatest investment opportunities in the world \u2013 CLICK HERE OR BELOW: Sponsored \\nVictor Sperandeo continues: \u201cThere is still some leftover QE. England and the EU still have some but once that is over, that\u2019s it. That game is finished. It didn\u2019t work. So they are now going to fiscal policy and infrastructure spending because they believe this will keep them in power. \\nWith that said, last week Larry Summers said the Fed has to give up their independence. He said the Treasury has to effectively sell to the Fed and the Fed will print the money and return it to the Treasury. And so he backed up what Rosenberg was saying about the multi-trillion dollar scheme. Eric, this is pure printing of money, but t he theory is that because people don\u2019t directly get that money, it won\u2019t create hyperinflation. But when this begins, this will be the beginning of when serious inflation will come back. \\nThe Beginning Of The End Of The U.S. Dollar I don\u2019t believe this will work in the United States if Trump wins. If Hillary wins it is 100 percent guaranteed that it is going to be implemented. If this does happen you will get a huge amount of government spending that is going to juice the economy. But it will be the prelude to hyperinflation. So that is going to be the coming world event that will be the beginning of the end for the U.S. dollar. \\nAnd if you remember, gold was the hedge against serious inflation in the 1970s (see remarkable chart below). \\nIn fact, from 1970 to 1980 gold compounded at a staggering 31.5 percent a year! I have never seen anything compound over a 10-year period at that rate. That\u2019s astronomical. Just to put that in perspective, if gold went to $10,000 today it would only have compounded 22 percent over that same time frame. \\nA World In Total Chaos And yet when you look at what is happening today, we have a global depression with the banking system blowing up. Look at Deutsche Bank, it has $46 trillion in derivatives and the bank is only valued at $18 billion. That is insane (laughter). Regardless, gold will act as a hedge and the price of gold will skyrocket because paper will be printed to the point where it\u2019s worthless. And as the hyperinflation unfolds, it will send the world into total chaos and people need to be prepared for that.\u201d \\n  Look At What Is Unfolding In China And Other Key Regions Right Now  '"}, "time": 1742563117.2362134}
