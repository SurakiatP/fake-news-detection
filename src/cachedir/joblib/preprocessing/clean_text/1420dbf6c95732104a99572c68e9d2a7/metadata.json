[When the interviewer proposed that the retaliatory missile strike marked a drastic change in Trump\u2019s position on Syria, Assad insisted the U. S. and Syria could still be partners in fighting terrorism, once Trump wrested control of Washington away from the   complex.  \u201cIf they are serious in fighting terrorists, we\u2019re going to be partners, and I said not only the United States. Whoever wants to fight the terrorists, we are partners,\u201d said Assad, in the transcript provided by Syria\u2019s SANA news service. \u201cThis is basic for us, basic principle, let\u2019s say,\u201d he continued: Actually, what has been proven recently, as I said earlier, that they are hand in glove with those terrorists, the United States and the West, they\u2019re not serious in fighting the terrorists, and yesterday some of their statesmen were defending ISIS. They were saying that ISIS doesn\u2019t have chemical weapons. They are defending ISIS against the Syrian government and the Syrian Army. So, actually, you cannot talk about partnership between us who work against the terrorists and who fight the terrorism and the others who are supporting explicitly the terrorists. Assad said the American missile strike was \u201cthe first proof that it\u2019s not about the President of the United States  \u2014   it\u2019s about the regime and the Deep State, or the deep regime in the United States. \u201d He said the Deep State \u201cis still the same, it doesn\u2019t change. \u201d \u201cThe president is only one of the performers on their theatre, if he wants to be a leader, he cannot, because as some say he wanted to be a leader, Trump wanted to be a leader, but every president there, if he wants to be a real leader, later he\u2019s going to eat his words, swallow his pride if he has pride at all, and make a 180 degree   otherwise he would pay the price politically,\u201d said Assad. Asked if he anticipated another U. S. attack, Assad replied: As long as the United States is being governed by this   complex, the financial companies, banks, and what you call deep regime, and works for the vested interest of those groups, of course. It could happen anytime, anywhere, not only in Syria. Assad lamented that his military could not retaliate against the American ships that fired cruise missiles at Syria but expressed hope the Russians might do it for him. \u201cFor us, as a small country, yeah, of course it is, everybody knows that. It\u2019s out of reach. I mean, they can have missiles from another continent. We all know that. They are a great power, we\u2019re not a great power. Talking about the Russians, this is another issue,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742562987.9922733}
