We live in a very divided country, and I will be your greatest champion.\u201d \\n{snip} \\n\u201cAfrican-American citizens have sacrificed so much for our nation. They fought and died in every war since the Revolution and from the pews and the picket lines, they\u2019ve lifted up the conscience of our country in the long march for civil rights. Yet too many African-Americans have been left behind.\u201d \\nTrump called for incentives to move companies into blighted neighborhoods to bolster employment, help African-Americans get better access to credit and push cities to declare \u201cblighted communities\u201d disaster areas to help rebuild infrastructure. \\nHe also said he\u2019d support increasing the number of police officers in such areas, connecting a lack of officers to a rise in murder rate in major cities. \\nBut while Trump\u2019s call focused on removing \u201cgang members and criminal cartels,\u201d he blamed Clinton for promoting a \u201cwar on police.\u201d He did not mention the accusations of police brutality by minorities who feel that they are disproportionately targeted. \\n{snip}'"}, "time": 1742562231.0454814}
