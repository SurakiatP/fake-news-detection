That is the language of the brochures and websites of the city\u2019s safe dealers, a small but longstanding industry that manages fears in and around the diamond district not only of disasters like fires or explosions, but also of hypothetical supervillains. When a safe is breached, word travels quickly. What happened? Whose safe was it? How did they get in? Those were the sorts of questions raised last week after a team of burglars broke into a jeweler\u2019s office on West 36th Street on New Year\u2019s Eve. The crime was widely reported for its scope  \u2014   the thieves made off with $6 million in diamonds and other gems  \u2014   and its brazen timing, occurring as the ball dropped six blocks away in a neighborhood teeming with police officers. Surveillance video showing two people hitting a   door with hammers was taken immediately after midnight, the police said, when the sound of cheers would have most likely drowned out any banging. But what happened next is, to many in the safe industry, more important than the forced entry. The two safes that held the valuables, the police said, showed no sign of forced entry. The police have not provided further details on the safes. News reports have suggested investigators are looking into whether someone working for the dealer who provided the safes gave the thieves the combinations. A man answering the telephone at the office of the dealer, Lacka Safe in New Jersey, said on Friday that the owners declined to comment. As that investigation unfolds, the burglary  \u2014   or \u201cattack,\u201d in   security parlance  \u2014   draws attention to the last line of defense for the city\u2019s many jewelers, an object that, for all the advances in technology over the years, remains a box with three sides, a top, a bottom and a door.   safes evoke exciting scenes from the movies, with steely safecrackers listening for clicks or drilling into dense steel with lasers. In reality, though, making safes is a hushed trade built on discretion and trust. \u201cI get calls all the time, \u2018Are your people O. K.?\u2019\u201d said Richard Krasilovsky of Empire Safe in Midtown. \u201cHow safe is it  \u2014   all puns intended  \u2014   for your people to do the work? The people know where the safe is going. I say it\u2019s a legitimate question to ask. \u201d Dealers carry an array of safes and locks, including digital locks with keypads and time locks that prevent anyone from opening the door, with or without the combination, while they\u2019re activated. The jewelers of Manhattan historically prefer more traditional designs for their safes, dealers said last week, with mechanical combination locks. \u201cIt\u2019s an older industry,\u201d said Dov Israeli of Precision Lock and Safe in Floral Park, N. Y. \u201cThey\u2019re focused on price and less on what\u2019s new. \u201d A jeweler typically requires a certain level of protection to satisfy its insurance company. These levels shown in ratings by Underwriters Laboratories, such as   or   indicate that safecrackers at the lab, using tools and torches, were unable to breach any of the six sides of the safe in 60 or 30 minutes. That is probably a greater margin of safety than the standard jeweler needs. \u201c  point nine nine nine percent of burglars out there can\u2019t penetrate a properly made \u201d Mr. Krasilovsky said. A brochure for a line of safes at Empire states that they are made of \u201c  and   armor\u201d for \u201cgreater protection against attack,\u201d and that they protect against everything from \u201chammers and simple drills, to thermal and electrical equipment, such as oxyacetylene torches and disk cutters. \u201d Mr. Krasilovsky said he met potential clients to offer a risk assessment based on what they were protecting and other factors, looking for what he called \u201can Achilles\u2019 heel. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to sell somebody protection, which is a safe,\u201d he said. \u201cI try to sell prevention. Protection is a science. I don\u2019t want the schmucks coming onto the premises. \u201d A cheaper safe may meet the requirements of an insurance company, while appearing to a burglar to be vulnerable. A technician sets the combination for a safe\u2019s lock for the first time. \u201cWe have you write it on a piece of paper,\u201d and hand it to the technician, Mr. Israeli said. Some dealers may keep a copy for a period of time, in case the safe\u2019s owner should need it. \u201cWe tear it up  \u2014   we won\u2019t keep a combination for you,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not even a service we will provide. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628381.9537644}
