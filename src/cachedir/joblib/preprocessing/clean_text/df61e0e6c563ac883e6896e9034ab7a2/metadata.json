[Speaking to ITV News, the SkyBridge Capital founder confirmed that the current plan is to \u201cget in the White House and get the president inaugurated and then take the steps necessary to make sure the UK is at the front of the line, as opposed to at the back the line, on trade deals\u201d.  Scaramucci\u2019s reference to \u201cthe back of the line\u201d was a call back to outgoing president Barack Obama threatening that the British would be at the back of the queue for a trade deal if they voted to leave the European Union (EU) which does not allow its members to strike trade deals on their own. Obama\u2019s use of the word \u201cqueue\u201d which is uncommon in   raised suspicions that he had been fed lines by the   former prime minister, David Cameron, and Scaramucci\u2019s decision to use the more traditional \u201cline\u201d may have been significant. Scaramucci\u2019s positive comments come shortly after the   himself pledged to get a trade deal \u201cdone quickly and done properly\u201d after Brexit in an interview with The Times of London, while congratulation the British public on their decision to leave an EU which is \u201cbasically a vehicle for Germany\u201c. \u201cWe see the unique, special relationship bond and love that these countries and people have for each other,\u201d Scaramucci told ITN, echoing sentiments expressed by Trump himself. \u201cI\u2019m a big fan of the UK\u201d said the Republican leader, reminiscing about his Scottish mother\u2019s pride in the Queen. Asked how he thought the   would get on with the EU in office, Scaramucci was upbeat. \u201cWay better than the EU thinks. I know him very, very well, and I understand exactly what he\u2019s thinking, and I understand his kindness and his gregarious nature and his charm  \u2014   he really wants to get along with the rest of the world. \u201d Earlier in the week, however, Scaramucci warned attendees of the ongoing Davos conference in Switzerland that \u201cthe European leadership and the European elites   \u2026     had better pay much closer attention to the working class families and the middle class\u201d. He also reiterated the  \u2019s view that European NATO members must start \u201cpaying their bills\u201d and refocus their efforts on \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d rather than the former Soviet Union.'"}, "time": 1742564444.2748358}
