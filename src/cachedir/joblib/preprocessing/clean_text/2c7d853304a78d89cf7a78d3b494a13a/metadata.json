President Trump, in his fourth tumultuous week in office, boasted that his new administration was a \u201c  machine. \u201d A news conference to announce his new nominee for labor secretary, R. Alexander Acosta, a former assistant attorney general for civil rights, turned into an extraordinarily raw and angry  . \u201cThe tone is such hatred,\u201d he said of cable TV commentary. \u201cI\u2019m really not a bad person. \u201d _____ 2. Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina was confirmed as budget director. He is a fiscal hawk who will play a central role in the administration\u2019s plans to reshape the federal government. But Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, heads to a confirmation vote Friday amid an extraordinary wave of protest from former E. P. A. staff members. Such   confirmation battles have helped make Republican lawmakers unable to deliver on their promises of sweeping legislation on health care, overhauling the tax code or upgrading the nation\u2019s infrastructure. They are particularly fractured on how to repeal and replace Obamacare. _____ 3. An uncounted number of immigrants across the country  \u2014   carpenters and cooks, students, cleaners and grocery store owners  \u2014   stayed home in protest of the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies. \u201cWe\u2019re at a stage where we\u2019re like, what else is there to do except organize and boycott?\u201d said an activist in New York. The Justice Department said it would not seek a rehearing on the president\u2019s targeted travel ban in a federal appeals court, saying a new order was in the works. _____ 4. Intelligence officials, on edge over Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism of leaks related to his associates\u2019   contacts with Russian intelligence agents, are resisting his plans to assign Stephen A. Feinberg, a New York billionaire, to review intelligence agencies. That Russian naval intelligence ship hanging off the East Coast? For some, it\u2019s a symbol of current tensions, but the Coast Guard says there\u2019s nothing all that unusual about it. Today\u2019s episode of the podcast The Daily asks, did the Trump campaign collude with Russia? Listen from a computer, on an iOS device or on an Android device. _____ 5. In environmental news, a Greenpeace report tied the toxic waves of air pollution sweeping northern China to an increase in already excessive steel production last year, made counter to promised cuts. Scientists are also coming to understand the crucial importance of the vast, and endangered, seagrass meadows that surround every continent except Antarctica. _____ 6. The Islamic State has destroyed many of the prized antiquities and ruins in the Syrian city of Palmyra. But a new digital exhibition is helping preserve its legacy. The Getty has gathered   etchings of Palmyra and the oldest known photographs of the city. Most have not been seen widely before. \u201cMore than just testaments to a threatened archaeological inheritance,\u201d our critic writes, they are \u201ctraces of explorations and crosscultural exchange too many now seek to shut down. \u201d _____ 7. Mark Zuckerberg updated Facebook\u2019s mission statement in a   letter that was close to a political statement from the    executive. He expressed alarm over growing rejections of globalism and argued that \u201cprogress now requires humanity coming together not just as cities or nations, but also as a global community. \u201d And Snap Inc. Snapchat\u2019s parent company, is aiming for a valuation of more than $20 billion as it nears what\u2019s expected to be the biggest initial public offering in the tech world since Alibaba and Facebook. _____ 8. You don\u2019t need us to tell you the world is full of paradoxes. But one of our sports reporters found a special case: Hunts for bighorn sheep  \u2014   prized as challenging, and prohibitively expensive  \u2014   are helping revive wild sheep populations and expand their territory. A permit sold for a record $480, 000 in 2013. _____ 9.   TV continues to showcase jokes about the White House and Russia. Stephen Colbert took particular aim at Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to blame the leakers who revealed Trump associates\u2019 contacts with Russian intelligence over the last year. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing,\u201d Mr. Colbert said. \u201cIt can\u2019t be both fake news and an illegal leak of classified information. \u2018Your honor, I did not murder that man. The real criminal is whoever filmed me strangling him. \u2019\u201d _____ 10. Finally, the announcement of a double jailhouse wedding more than a century ago got Lena Dunham thinking about what it means to love and to be a \u201cgood woman. \u201d The notice is part of our review of 165 years of Times wedding announcements. In a turnabout, it was the women who were incarcerated. They were serving short sentences, but the 1912 article made no mention of their infractions. The grooms, the creator of HBO\u2019s \u201cGirls\u201d writes, were able to get beyond societal expectations of the brides\u2019 behavior: \u201cThey didn\u2019t need them to be good girls. They were their girls. \u201d Photographs may appear out of order for some readers. Viewing this version of the briefing should help. Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern.
