They have taken pride in their status as the United States\u2019 most faithful proxy in the fight against the militant group, and they have hoped their effectiveness as warriors would lead to American support for Kurdish political gains inside Syria. So, many Kurds shuddered when Turkish tanks and soldiers recently rolled into northern Syria, with American support, to push back against Kurdish gains. They saw it, perhaps prematurely, as a replay of a century of betrayal by world powers, going back to the end of World War I, when they were promised, then denied, their own state in the postwar settlement. \u201cThe Kurds are going to scream betrayal at every turn when they think things are not going to go their way, because they\u2019ve had a century of it,\u201d said Joost Hiltermann, the program director for the Middle East and North Africa at the International Crisis Group, and a longtime expert on the Kurds. The Syrian Kurds say their aim is to establish an autonomous region, not their own state, where their rights are protected, in whatever settlement comes from the long Syrian civil war. And they say they hope that the United States will support them in that desire. To accomplish that, though, they need to connect two of their territories: Afrin, in the west, and Kobani, in the east, an effort that Turkey sees as a national security threat to be thwarted at virtually any cost. So, while the first aim of Turkey\u2019s incursion last month into northern Syria was to push the Islamic State from the border town of Jarabulus, many believe Turkey\u2019s primary goal was to thwart Kurdish territorial ambitions. That the United States supported the move by Turkey, a NATO ally, reverberated among ethnic Kurds across the region, where they are spread across four countries  \u2014   Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey  \u2014   and have long dreamed of their own state, while being oppressed by autocratic governments that have denied them basic political rights. \u201cThese operations by Turkey are obviously more against the Kurds than Daesh,\u201d said Mahmoud Othman, a prominent Iraqi Kurdish politician, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State. He added: \u201cPeople are afraid now. People are really afraid of what could happen in the end. \u201d Drawing on history, Kurds see themselves as the playthings of world powers, used in proxy fights when it serves someone\u2019s interest and then discarded. The United States, on balance, has arguably been a great friend to the Kurds, coming to their aid after the Persian Gulf war in the early 1990s and helping to establish an autonomous region for them in Iraq, safe from Saddam Hussein\u2019s brutality. However, the United States also figures prominently in that historical memory of betrayal. In 1975, after the C. I. A. worked with Iran to supply weapons to the Kurds to fight Mr. Hussein\u2019s regime, Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger abruptly pulled the plug after a reconciliation between Tehran and Baghdad. \u201cIn 1975, the same betrayal of the Kurds happened,\u201d said Hasos Hard, a Kurdish journalist in northern Iraq, when asked about his reaction to the American support for Turkey\u2019s Syria incursion. Many analysts, though, as well as Syrian Kurdish fighters on the ground, say the accusations of betrayal are not quite right  \u2014   at least not yet. There is little sign that the United States has abandoned the Syrian Kurds. American officials have worked to negotiate a truce on the ground between the rebels backed by Turkey and the Kurdish militia, known as the People\u2019s Protection Units, and fighting has calmed in recent days. But many Kurds say they now see the writing on the wall and worry that once the Islamic State is driven from its capital in the Syrian city of Raqqa, the United States will sell them out. Mr. Hiltermann said that when he traveled to northern Syria this year, he was asked this question, over and over, by the Kurds: \u201cWhat do you think the Americans will do when Raqqa is taken?\u201d The question highlights the conundrum that the increasingly complicated Syrian battlefield presents the United States, which has tried to balance its relations with Turkey and the Syrian Kurds  \u2014   a primary Turkish enemy because of their ties to militants inside the country. Even though the United States has funneled weapons to the Syrian Kurds and provided them with military training, it has not established ties to the militia\u2019s political wing, the Democratic Union Party, because of Turkish concerns. Nor has it promised them anything beyond military support in the fight against the Islamic State, other than expressions of support for a Kurdish role at the negotiating table when, or if, serious peace talks get underway. Aliza Marcus, an author and expert on the Kurds, said, \u201cIt seems crass by the U. S. \u201d to provide military support without any steps to establish political ties. This seems especially true now, she said, after the Kurds took heavy casualties in pushing the Islamic State out of Manbij, a city in northern Syria they recently liberated, and are now being asked to leave because Turkey does not want them there. Lacking United States support, the Democratic Union Party has been shut out of Syrian peace talks that have been held in Geneva, and now there are increasing worries that Washington will eventually distance itself from the Syrian Kurds in a bid to improve relations with Turkey. \u201cThe U. S. themselves, they say, these are the best fighters against Daesh,\u201d said Mr. Othman, referring to the People\u2019s Protection Units. \u201cThese are the best allies. Hopefully they will stick to that, and help them, and not leave them in the end. \u201d The recent events stand in marked contrast to a year ago, when it seemed that the Kurds were capitalizing on the turmoil in the Middle East to make historic gains. In Syria, they had secured land and found a powerful benefactor in the United States. In Turkey, for the first time, a Kurdish political party entered Parliament after elections. In Iraq, amid the fight against the Islamic State, they took control of Kirkuk, a city historically divided between Arabs and Kurds. A year later, though, those prospects have dimmed. Iraq\u2019s Kurds, somewhat insulated from the Syrian crisis, are pushing forward with their ambitions for independence, undaunted by an economic crisis. But in Turkey a   war has resumed between the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party and the Turkish state, and the main Kurdish political party has been isolated from national politics. In Syria, the Turkish military has quashed the Kurds\u2019 efforts to link their two territories. Further complicating matters, the Syrian conflict has become intertwined with Turkey\u2019s domestic turmoil. Turkey now sees itself as fighting the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party on three fronts: in Turkey, in northern Syria and in northern Iraq, where its members hide out in the mountains. As a result, analysts now say that there can be no final settlement of the Syrian civil war without the resumption of peace talks between Turkey and the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, of which the Democratic Union Party is its Syrian affiliate. For now, the Kurds are still counting on the Americans to preserve them a place in a future Syrian state. \u201cThey should help them politically, to have rights in Syria,\u201d Mr. Othman said. The Kurds, he said, \u201cwant a new Syria to be established, with them having a say in it. \u201d If nothing else, the American military support, even without any promises on the political front, has legitimized the Syrian Kurds\u2019 ambitions. It has helped them to secure a large section of territory they say they will never give up, no matter what their patrons do. \u201cThroughout history, the Kurds were abandoned,\u201d said Ahmad Haj Mansour, a Democratic Union Party official who lives in Britain. \u201cBut now, the time and place is different. We don\u2019t need world powers to survive. We are in charge of our land, and we have fighters. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561923.717089}
