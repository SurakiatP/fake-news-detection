Jamie Santora ( ) is pushing a ban on private gun sales nearly identical to the ones Michael   Moms Demand Action pushed in Washington state, Maine, and Nevada. [Santora\u2019s bill would bar the private sales that Americans have enjoyed since the Second Amendment was ratified in 1791 and would require that every sale be processed in front of an agent of the government via a background check.  This means that   Pennsylvanians selling a gun to a fellow hunter, lifelong   or childhood friend would have to seek out a Federal Firearms License (FFL) holder and the   buyer would have to pass a background check just as the Orlando Pulse attacker (June 12, 2016) the Aurora movie theater attacker (July 20, 2012) Gabby Giffords\u2019 attacker (January 8, 2011) the Fort Hood attacker (November 5, 2009) and the Virginia Tech attacker (April 16, 2007) did. According to the Delaware County News Network, Santora says his attempt to expand the frequency of background checks is \u201ccommon sense. \u201d He said, \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to take away Second Amendment rights.
