[All 11 people standing for the French presidency took part in the epic debate, including less well known candidates polling barely above one per cent.  Front National leader Marine Le Pen was able to paint herself as a moderate against the words of her smaller rivals, telling Fran\u00e7ois Asselineau, president of the obscure Popular Republican Union, her position was \u201cless brutal\u201d than his policy of unilaterally withdrawing from the EU. Mr. Asselineau responded by accusing Ms. Le Pen of not really wanting \u2018Frexit\u2019 to which she responded: \u201cThe French will decide. \u201d The only candidate to passionately support the EU was independent Emmanuel Macron, Ms. Le Pen\u2019s main rival for the presidency, who accused her of wanting to cause \u201ceconomic war\u201d. \u201cWhat you are proposing, Ms. Le Pen, is a reduction in French people\u2019s purchasing power, because for savers and for workers, withdrawing from the euro will be a reduction in spending power,\u201d he said. The Front National leader accused Mr. Macron of pretending \u201cto be something new when you are speaking like old fossils that are at least 50 years old\u201d. French daily Le Figaro called the debate a \u201ccacophony\u201d as the 11 candidates shouted at and interrupted one another for four hours. The paper said things soon turned to confusion as the candidates debated \u201cwithout much coherence\u201d with different candidates seeming to ally with others and then oppose them later. Broadcaster France 24 also called the debate \u201cmore surreal than enlightening\u201d and criticised the decision to allow all 11 candidates to debate. \u201cThe open contest on the BFM TV and CNEWS networks, while laudable in principle, was absurd in effect with so much on the line. And the top candidates, many of whom have been openly lukewarm about contesting a similar third broadcast on April 20, might be wise to stay away. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563037.1617136}
