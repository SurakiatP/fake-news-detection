A teacher in Wisconsin sued the city of Janesville after she showed up to a field trip drunk. She claimed that she was emotionally distressed after the police released her blood alcohol level test results. \\nFox News reported : \\nA former elementary school teacher who passed out after showing up drunk to a bowling alley field trip is getting a $75,000 settlement from the Wisconsin city she sued. \\nThe ex-teacher, Maria Caya, filed a $5.5 million lawsuit against the city of Janesville last year claiming police improperly released her blood alcohol tests, Fox 6 reported . The city council approved the settlement Monday night. \\nInvestigators said her blood alcohol percentage was 0.27 percent on the day of the field trip in June 2013. The legal limit for driving in Wisconsin is 0.08 percent. \\nAnother staff member took Caya to the hospital after finding her passed out in the bowling alley bathroom, WKOW reported . As many as eight other adults were chaperoning the group of 4th graders. \\nAside from the teacher\u2019s $75,000 settlement, she also received $18,000 to resign because district officials noted that it would have cost more in legal fees to actually fire her. \\nFor that you can thank the teachers\u2019 unions, who have a stranglehold on the American educational system. Forget protecting the kids, let\u2019s make it difficult for the school district to fire a teacher who allegedly passed out drunk on a field trip. \\nFox News reported that despite the settlement, it\u2019s not clear whether or not she actually broke any laws. \\nJens Jorgensen, one of seven Janesville City Council members who opposed the settlement, told Fox 6: \u201cI think that there\u2019s a lot of things that happened that day and I would think that a judge and jury of her peers would be able to see through all of that and make the correct decision on that.\u201d \\nChristine Nimmo, a parent, said of the situation: \u201cShe put our children in jeopardy.\u201d \\nIf Maya did what she is alleged to have done, then she absolutely put the children in jeopardy, and this story is a prime example of why our schools are failing. Thanks to the teachers\u2019 unions, bad teachers stick around because schools are afraid of expensive legal action. \\nOn the flip side, good teachers are chased out and can\u2019t do their job effectively because of fear of legal action in our overly-litigious, politically-correct society. \\nSomething has to change.'"}, "time": 1742564603.8480635}
