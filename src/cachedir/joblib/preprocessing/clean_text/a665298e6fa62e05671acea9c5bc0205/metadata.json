Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter said on Sunday that he welcomed the start of the militia\u2019s operation. \u201cThe effort to isolate, and ultimately liberate, Raqqa marks the next step in our coalition campaign plan,\u201d Mr. Carter said in a statement. American warplanes are flying bombing missions against the Islamic State\u2019s \u201cleadership, command and control, and resources\u201d in Raqqa and outside the city in support of the militia, the Syrian Democratic Forces, said Col. John Dorrian, a military spokesman in Baghdad. Colonel Dorrian said in an email that it might be some time before the   to   force reached Raqqa, and that the   coalition would continue to train and recruit more forces  \u2014   especially Arab troops  \u2014   for an eventual attack on the city. By supporting the advance on Raqqa, American officials are sweeping aside objections from Turkey and moving forward with plans to rely on a ground fighting force that includes Kurdish militia fighters in Syria. The Turkish government, which has become a complicated ally in the fight against the Islamic State, fears that aspirations for autonomy will spread among its own Kurdish population. In a move to assuage Turkish concerns, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr. the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made a previously unannounced visit to Ankara, the Turkish capital, on Sunday for talks with his Turkish counterpart, Hulusi Akar, in part to consult on battle plans for Raqqa, according to General Dunford\u2019s spokesman, Capt. Greg Hicks. The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs could not be reached for comment on Sunday, but last month Ankara asked Washington to exclude the Syrian Kurdish militias from the operation to liberate Raqqa, saying Turkey was ready to provide military support. Last month, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he had told President Obama in a phone call that Turkey was capable of ridding Raqqa of the Islamic State by itself. Turkey wants to start the push on Raqqa after operations in Iraq, including the offensive against Mosul, have been completed, the deputy prime minister, Numan Kurtulmus, said at a news conference last week. France on Sunday supported the decision to begin the battle against the Islamic State\u2019s headquarters in Raqqa while the   offensive on Mosul is underway. \u201cI believe it will be necessary,\u201d the defense minister,   Le Drian, said on Europe 1 radio. United States military officials said the Raqqa operation was being undertaken in roughly three phases. Phase 1 is what the   coalition has been doing for months: conducting scores of preparatory airstrikes in and around Raqqa to knock out    and fighting positions and other assets of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the ability to move large troop formations, large convoys, but they do have the ability to move into and out of the area,\u201d Colonel Dorrian told reporters in Washington last week. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done to try to limit that is we\u2019ve conducted a lot of strikes on their favored supply routes and infiltration routes. \u201d Phase 2, which the Syrian Democratic Forces announced on Sunday, is the campaign to isolate Raqqa. The aim is to cut it off from resupply with the available forces  \u2014   about   of them Syrian Kurds and   Syrian Arabs, Pentagon officials say. \u201cThe intent, though, is to intensify that effort, to move closer to the city, to envelop the city and then once everything is in place, to liberate it,\u201d Colonel Dorrian said last week. Phase 3 will be a fight for Raqqa itself, which American officials say they hope will be conducted mostly by Syrian Arabs, given that the city is majority Sunni Arab. But Colonel Dorrian said that might not happen for some time. \u201cRight now, I don\u2019t think that all the forces that\u2019ll be involved in that liberation campaign for Raqqa are yet trained,\u201d he said. Colonel Dorrian said that providing additional training to militia members who had already been involved in the fighting would take about two weeks. \u201cWe\u2019ll let that play out, and we\u2019ll see how long that takes, and we\u2019ll see how many forces will be generated,\u201d he said. More than 300 members of the United States Special Operations Forces are in Syria advising the   coalition forces, but Colonel Dorrian said the Syrian opposition forces would dictate the timing of the ground operations and training, and the recruitment of additional Arab troops for the recapture of Raqqa. \u201cThere is an intent to enlarge the force, and in particular the Arab contingent of the force, because we do understand that Raqqa is primarily an Arab city,\u201d Colonel Dorrian said. \u201cWe do understand that there is a political dimension and a local acceptance dimension to this fight. \u201d Senior Pentagon officials have stressed for weeks that the fight to retake Raqqa should begin soon  \u2014   within weeks  \u2014   to disrupt planning believed to be underway there to stage terrorist attacks on the West. Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, the top American military commander in Iraq, has declined to name a specific threat emanating from Raqqa against Western targets but described a general \u201csense of urgency. \u201d He told reporters at the Pentagon two weeks ago that it was imperative that operations to isolate the city began soon to prevent attacks on the West that could be launched or planned from the militants\u2019 capital. General Townsend stressed that Kurdish militia fighters would be a major part of the ground force used to isolate Raqqa, despite Turkish objections. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go with who can go, who\u2019s willing to go soon,\u201d he told reporters during a video news briefing from Baghdad. \u201cAnd then, once we get the initial isolation in position, we\u2019ll look at how we prosecute the operation further. \u201d While the Kurdish militia will make up the bulk of the operation, General Townsend said, many of the United States Special Forces troops in Syria would help recruit, train and equip local forces in and around Raqqa, predominantly Syrian Arabs. Gen. Joseph L. Votel, the commander of American forces in the Middle East, has acknowledged the challenges of dealing with two pivotal allies in the fight against the Islamic State in Syria who essentially loathe each other  \u2014   the Turks and the Syrian Kurds. One of his main goals now, he said recently, is to maintain momentum and \u201cto keep everyone moving in the right direction. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628293.3674204}
