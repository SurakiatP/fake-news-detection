[Conway said in a statement on Tuesday:  The hosts of MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe have become virulent critics of the President and those close to him. Ignoring insults and insinuations is a valuable skill. But when sentiments are attributed to me that are not true, it is necessary to respond. My beliefs, commitments and loyalties are plain to see. The notion that I am serving for \u2018the money\u2019 or a \u2018paycheck\u2019 is absurd. As campaign manager, I made a fraction of what other consultants have made on unsuccessful presidential campaigns. Then I walked away from dozens of opportunities for millions of dollars, and instead walked into the White House. I would do it again. It is a privilege to assist President Trump in the White House, just as it was during the campaign. I know him, I respect him, I believe in him, and I am confident in his capacity to be a transformative and successful President. Taking a moment from more important matters to respond   \u2026    . pic. twitter.   \u2014   Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) May 16, 2017,  Conway\u2019s Tuesday statement comes after   attacks from Scarborough and Brzezinski on Monday morning\u2019s program, in which they claimed that Conway \u2014  Trump\u2019s successful general election campaign manager \u2014  is only in it for the money. They even claimed that Conway once said she needed \u201ca shower\u201d after standing up for Trump when the microphones were off during the campaign, something on which they provided no proof. \u201cThis is a woman, by the way, who came on our show during the campaign and would shill for Trump in extensive fashion and then she would get off the air, the camera would be turned off, the microphone would be taken off and she would say \u2018bleeech I need to take a shower\u2019 because she disliked her candidate so much,\u201d Brzezinski said on Monday. \u201cAlso said, that this is just, like my summer in Europe. I\u2019m just doing this for the money, I\u2019ll be off this soon,\u201d Scarborough backed up his    . \u201cI don\u2019t know that she ever said \u2018I\u2019m doing this for the money,\u2019 but this is just my summer vacation, my summer in Europe. And basically, I\u2019m gonna get through this. \u201d Brzezinski then finished Scarborough\u2019s sentence for him. \u201cBut first I have to take a shower because it feels so dirty to be saying what I\u2019m saying,\u201d she said. \u201cI guess she\u2019s just used to it now. \u201d And Scarborough did the same for her: \u201cAnd also, I thought it was very interesting, after the Access Hollywood tape came out, that\u2019s when she started referring to Donald Trump as \u2018my client,\u2019\u201d Scarborough said. Scarborough and Brzezinski have been roundly panned by most for the unsavory and unsubstantiated comments. Fox News\u2019 Tucker Carlson ripped them on Monday for smearing Conway with such comments. \u201cMany journalists believe it\u2019s literally impossible to be unfair to Donald Trump or the people who work for him,\u201d Carlson said in a segment on Monday evening criticizing the media for bias, and particularly ripping Brzezinski and Scarborough for this extreme bias against Conway and Trump. \u201cExtremism in the pursuit of Trump is no vice. That\u2019s the view in newsrooms and you hear it in conversations all around Washington, a city that voted 91 percent for Hillary Clinton last fall  \u2026     They\u2019ve succumbed to Trump hatred that is so intense, it has destroyed their judgment and in some cases affected their character. \u201d What\u2019s more, Brzezinski\u2019s and Scarborough\u2019s implication that Conway was just supporting Trump for the money \u2014  as simply a client, rather than supporting somebody and something she believes in \u2014  is not backed up by the facts. In fact, a piece in The Atlantic of all places, in March, detailed how Conway has spent the better part of her adult life helping build out the intellectual framework of the ideology that propelled Trump to electoral success. Calling her the \u201cunsung architect of Trumpism,\u201d the Atlantic\u2019s Molly Ball detailed how she was not just a television personality or spin artist or generic GOP strategist, but \u201ca principal architect of the theory behind Trump\u2019s winning campaign. \u201d Ball wrote: Years before Conway went to work on Trump\u2019s campaign \u2014  when she was still a midlist conservative pollster and Steve Bannon was still running Breitbart \u2014  the two were charter members, Bannon recently told me, of the \u2018cabal\u2019 he was forming behind the scenes to upend the Republican establishment. And Conway\u2019s ideas were the key to a major shift in the way Trump addressed immigration, which became his signature issue. One Conway poll in particular \u2014  a   2014 messaging memo commissioned by a controversial   group \u2014  Bannon cited as a sort of Rosetta stone of the message that powered Trump\u2019s victory. It was, Bannon told me, a pillar of \u2018the intellectual infrastructure of the populist movement that candidate Trump galvanized\u2019 from the moment he began his candidacy in 2015. Conway, when the rest of Republicans generally speaking were marching to the tune of amnesty in the wake of Mitt Romney\u2019s embarrassing defeat in the 2012 presidential election, went a different route. After the Senate rammed through the   \u201cGang of Eight\u201d amnesty bill in 2013, and a similar push in the House was maintained through 2014, Conway \u2014  a pollster with The Polling Company \u2014  in August 2014 published a poll that proved the opposite of the open borders lobby\u2019s arguments. \u201cThere was, she wrote, \u2018strong consensus on many populist immigration policies,\u2019 including enforcing current immigration law, limiting illegal immigrants\u2019 access to welfare and work, and reducing legal immigrants\u2019 ability to bring family members to the United States,\u201d Ball wrote in the Atlantic. Ball continued: The issue, she wrote, should be framed in terms of \u2018America First,\u2019 and as a matter of \u2018fairness   \u2026     to   workers.\u2019   of likely voters, she pointed out, wanted more enforcement of current immigration laws. (Most economists agree that   immigration displaces some   workers while improving the economy and creating more net jobs overall. And while majorities of voters of both parties consistently oppose deporting the undocumented en masse, majorities generally also oppose increasing the number of legal immigrants.) Conway told me her argument was intended as an explicit rebuttal to the \u2018autopsy\u2019 report. \u2018Candidates had been told after 2012, because Mitt Romney only got 27 percent of the Hispanic vote, that they had to support comprehensive immigration reform,\u2019 she told me. \u2018We were telling them, \u2018That\u2019s not true. \u2019\u2019    white voters, in particular, supported the idea that illegal immigration was hurting their ability to find work, she said. So, in other words, after spending a great deal of her life working on building out the intellectual framework for the ideology that led to Trump\u2019s victory, then personally joining his campaign and helping him across the finish line, somehow to Brzezinski and Scarborough she is not sufficiently committed to the president and his agenda? That does not pass the smell test.'"}, "time": 1742564494.9310775}
