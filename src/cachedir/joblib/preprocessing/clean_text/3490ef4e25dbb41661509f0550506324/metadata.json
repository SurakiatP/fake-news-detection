The memo reveals two main arguments: a sense of obligation to lawmakers and a concern that word of the new email discovery would leak to the media and raise questions of a coverup. \\nThese two arguments prompted the FBI director to release his brief letter to Congress on Friday and has sent the presidential race into a tailspin less than two weeks before Election Day. It placed Comey again at the center of a highly partisan argument over whether the nation\u2019s top law enforcement agency was unfairly influencing the campaign. \\nIn a memo explaining his decision to FBI employees soon after he sent his letter to Congress, Comey said he felt \u201can obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed.\u201d He admitted that he broke with custom in alerting lawmakers that the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server was being reopened because of its political sensitivity. \\nHe further explained to FBI employees that \u201cOf course we don\u2019t ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations, but here I feel an obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed . I also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record.\" \\nWhat made this case special in Comey\\'s eyes is that Clinton is seeking the White House in an election on Nov. 8. In other words, both internal pressure to preempt leaks (from disgruntled employees?) and a sense of \"obligations\" is why Hillary\\'s campaign is in full damage control mode right now. \\n\u201cAt the same time, however, given that we do not know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails, I don\u2019t want to create a misleading impression,\u201d Comey\u2019s letter continued. \u201cIn trying to strike that balance, in a brief letter, and in the middle of an election season, there is significant risk of being misunderstood, but I wanted you to hear directy from me about it.\u201d \\nAs reported previously, the bombshell revelation that newly discovered emails had prompted a new look into whether Clinton or those around her had broken the law my mishandling sensitive information rocked the race for the White House Friday. Comey informed eight Republican lawmakers that new emails had surfaced that were relevant to the investigation, and warranted a new look. \\nComey announced in July that the FBI had wrapped up a year-long investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server for official business and concluded that while she was \u201cextremely careless,\u201d he could not recommend that the Justice Department seek an indictment. The decision was blasted by Republicans, and FoxNews.com reported earlier this month that career DOJ and FBI workers were furious. \\nNow, it is the democrats turn to rage at Comey and the FBI, although Comey likely did not have much choice: had he kept the information secret, it certainly would have leaked as we predicted; as such his best recourse was to come clean, although many have speculated about the cryptic nature of the disclosure. \\nNeedless to say, all Comey would need to do to regain the Demcorats\\' trust and favor is to announce in just a few days that nothing material has been found and that the second probe is also over.'"}, "time": 1742561997.2379794}
