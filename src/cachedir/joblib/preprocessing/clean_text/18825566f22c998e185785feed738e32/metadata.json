Chuck Schumer ( ) describing him as a \u201cbad leader\u201d who is \u201cleading the Democrats to doom. \u201d[Discussing the opposition from Democrats to his plans to build a border wall, Trump said, \u201cUnfortunately, Democrats in Congress have no leadership, they are rudderless. \u201d  \u201cSenator Schumer is a bad leader. I\u2019ve known him a long time, Senator Schumer is a bad leader, not a natural leader at all. He works hard to study leadership   \u2026     Well if you have to study leadership you\u2019ve got problems,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHis policies are hurting innocent Americans and making it easier for drug dealers to enter our country. Schumer is weak on crime and wants to raise your taxes through the roof. He is a poor leader, and he is leading the Democrats to doom,\u201d Trump continued. Trump also criticized Democrats in Congress for opposing his immigration agenda, arguing that \u201cIf the Democrats knew what the hell they were doing, they would approve [the wall] so fast, as we want to stop crime in our country. \u201d He said: Obviously they don\u2019t mind illegals coming in, they don\u2019t mind drugs pouring in, they don\u2019t mind MS13 coming in. Members of Congress who\u2019ll be voting on border security have a simple choice, they can either help to vote drug cartels and criminal aliens trying to enter the United States, like frankly, the Democrats are doing. Or they can vote to help American citizens and American families be safe, that\u2019s the choice. In March, Sen. Chuck Schumer claimed that Trump\u2019s plans to build a wall on the southern border would not get sufficient votes from Democrats or Republicans, as \u201cIt\u2019s not the best way to protect the border\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s very expensive. \u201d You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart. com'"}, "time": 1742628369.041365}
