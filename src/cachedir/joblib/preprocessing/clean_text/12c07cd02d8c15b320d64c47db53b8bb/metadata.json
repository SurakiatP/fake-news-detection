But several recent WikiLeaks emails from John Podesta, chairman of Hillary\u2019s campaign, have revealed that Hillary Clinton\u2019s health problems cannot possibly be branded as \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d any longer.\\n\\nBefore Hillary Clinton announced her run for president, an email sent on March 14th, 2014, by campaign manager Robert Mook to Clinton campaign chairman Podesta asks whether Podesta has discussed Hillary\u2019s \u201ctaxes and health.\u201d The email states that he acknowledges they\u2019re both \u201chyper sensitive\u201d issues, wondering whether \u201cboth are better dealt with very early so we control them\u2013rather than responding to calls for transparency.\u201d \\nIn this thread, Mook stated \u201cYes. We need to kill that baby in the cradle.\u201d (Which perfectly articulates how sadistic the Clinton campaign and agenda is within a single metaphor.)\\nA later email thread from July 31, 2015 , shows Dan Schwerin, Clinton\u2019s director of speech writing, aiming to roll out Hillary\u2019s tax records along with a letter from her physician stating that she is \u201cin excellent health,\u201d and that following this \u201cWe expect the stories that pop at 2 pm to have headlines such as \u201cCLINTON IN \u2018EXCELLENT HEALTH,\u2019 MEDICAL RECORDS SAY\u201d \u2026 \u201cCLINTON RELEASES HEALTH REPORT\u201d \u2026 \u201cCLINTON CAMP AIMS TO ONE-UP BUSH IN DISCLOSING FINANCES\u201d\\nThe emails expose the Clinton campaign\u2019s attempts to suppress any further inquiry into these health problems and control the narrative, and provide them with \u201cthe best possible, \u2018fighting\u2019 chance of promoting the most helpful story lines.\u201d\\nAlso stating that \u201cthe first stories on health won\u2019t pop until 2. 1 pm is just when we will quietly approach the reporters, \u201d the Clinton camp is exposed in the way in which the mainstream media has held complete bias in favor of a Clinton presidency. This has also been revealed through all the recent Podesta email Wikileaks releases. Just one example being an email sent April 30, 2015, by Politico reporter Glenn Thrush, who even called himself a \u201chack\u201d when asking Hillary\u2019s top campaign aide, John Podesta, to check over sections of his report regarding the Democratic presidential candidate before publication. \\n\\nStartlingly, an email exchange between Hillary\u2019s campaign leaders, Tanden and Podesta, even questions if she is aware that we are living on planet Earth. Telling an audience in Ohio that she was \u201cmoderate and center\u201d after previously stating just a few days prior that she was \u201cprogressive\u201d, Tanden asks, \u201cWhy did she call herself a moderate?\u201d\\nPodesta replied \u201c I pushed her on this on Sunday night. She claims she didn\u2019t remember saying it. Not sure I believe her.\u201d \\nIn response, Tanden stated, \u201cI mean it makes my life more difficult after telling every reporter I know she\u2019s actually progressive but that is really the smallest of issues. It worries me more that she doesn\u2019t seem to know what planet we are all living in at the moment. \u201d \\nIt can be speculated as to what this statement is referring to, but it is evident that this proves Hillary\u2019s lack of awareness and mental stability. Perhaps regarding her inability to hold a firm political position, or even more worryingly, her inability to retain even the most basic and fundamental information, due to a medical condition that she is suffering from. Giving credibility to the latter possibility, Hillary\u2019s top aide Huma Abedin admits that the former Secretary of State is \u201cstill not perfect in her head,\u201d in a newly revealed Wikileaks email on Tuesday.\\nCountless incidents capturing Hillary\u2019s poor health and unstable mental state have been brought to light, despite the Clinton campaign and mainstream media\u2019s attempted censoring of this content in the hope that portraying a false narrative regarding these episodes will stray attention away from this issue. For example, after Hillary\u2019s recent fall at a 9/11 memorial event filmed by a bystander, the Clinton campaign tried to cover up by claiming this was due to \u201cpneumonia and dehydration\u201d even though Clinton does not appear limp, as though she has fainted. In contrast, she appears ridged and shaky throughout this episode, as Secret Service agents lift her into the vehicle. However, Hillary\u2019s constant tumbles do not surprise me, as the gravitational force pulling this Democratic nominee towards underworld must be so incredibly strong.\\nThis along with many other recently recorded accounts of Hillary\u2019s severe coughing fits , dangerous falls, recurring eye problems , and the spitting up of a vile yellow substance, have undoubtedly shown that this presidential candidate is scarcely physically fit to perform duties as president. Hillary\u2019s mental state is also a major point of concern, which top aides, Podesta and Abedin, have confirmed through the Wikileaks emails stated in this article.\\nIf Hillary blatantly appears unable to function healthily during her time running for president, we can only expect these issues to increase in severity if she were to take on the stressful position of president.\\nThe post WikiLeaks Podesta Emails Confirm Hillary\u2019s Health Issues appeared first on We Are Change .\\n'"}, "time": 1742564518.5293095}
