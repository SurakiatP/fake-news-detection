It was a tactical approach, designed specifically to take Lionel Messi and the other dangerous Argentine attackers out of the game by applying forward pressure and forcing Argentina to make long, hopeful passes. And it worked for about seven minutes. But in the eighth minute, Messi conjured the kind of technical genius that compels most observers to call him the best soccer player in the world, artfully lifting a perfect pass about 15 yards in to Gonzalo Higua\u00edn. With one striking touch, Higua\u00edn converted it into a goal, the first in Argentina\u2019s   victory on Saturday in a Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario quarterfinal. In that decisive moment, like so many others experienced by opponents hoping to stop Messi, all of Venezuela\u2019s carefully conceived defensive tactics were laid to waste. \u201cThey have that stroke of genius that changes all your schemes,\u201d Venezuela Coach Rafael Dudamel said. \u201cThey had an incredible pass from Messi, and they scored. \u201d Messi has frequently had brilliant strokes like that one, and now it is the United States\u2019 turn to try to find a way to suppress them. The United States earned a spot in Tuesday\u2019s Copa Am\u00e9rica semifinal here at NRG Stadium by beating Ecuador, but the dubious prize awaiting them is Messi, Argentina\u2019s mesmerizing,    dribbling, passing and shooting virtuoso. \u201cThis is special,\u201d United States Coach Jurgen Klinsmann said. \u201cAbsolutely, it\u2019s special to play against these type of players. When you get the opportunity to play against one of the biggest players in the world, you want to raise your game you want to enjoy it. \u201d The United States has had few chances to play a meaningful game against a star of Messi\u2019s caliber who also played on such a quality team. (FIFA has Argentina ranked No. 1 in the world.) Tuesday\u2019s match will be the rough equivalent of taking on Pel\u00e9\u2019s Brazil in 1970 or Ferenc Puskas\u2019s Hungary in 1954 or the team led by that other Argentine soccer genius, Diego Maradona, in 1986. As Klinsmann noted, the United States was seconds from beating Portugal at the 2014 World Cup until Cristiano Ronaldo  \u2014   who has at times been considered Messi\u2019s equal  \u2014   provided a gorgeous cross that enabled Portugal to tie the game. Over the years, the United States has faced the likes of England\u2019s Wayne Rooney at the 2010 World Cup, Brazil\u2019s Ronaldinho at the 1999 Confederations Cup and Italy\u2019s Paolo Maldini, one of the best left backs in history, at the 1990 World Cup, as well as Brazil\u2019s duo of Bebeto and Rom\u00e1rio and Romania\u2019s Gheorghe Hagi, some of the top players of their era, at the 1994 World Cup. At the 1934 World Cup, the United States lost by   to Italy, and one of the goals was scored by Giuseppe Meazza, whom some historians consider the best player Italy has produced. At the 1998 World Cup, Klinsmann scored against the United States toward the end of his prolific career as one of the most dangerous attackers for the world champions West Germany and Germany. But in recent memory, there is nothing that quite resembles Tuesday\u2019s challenge. Two years ago Ronaldo did not enjoy the kind of team support from Portugal that Messi does now with Javier Mascherano, \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda (when healthy) Sergio Ag\u00fcero and particularly Higua\u00edn, Argentina\u2019s penetrating No. 9, who scored twice against Venezuela. Spend too much time focusing on either Messi or Higua\u00edn, and the other could act decisively. \u201cWe have two strikers who are really exceptional,\u201d Gerardo Martino, Argentina\u2019s coach, said after Saturday\u2019s match. \u201cI cannot repeat it enough I really feel this. People in Argentina have a hard time accepting the quality of soccer players that we have. We have two No. 9s, and we proceed with what we feel is best. \u201d Martino watched Venezuela hack down Messi several times in the quarterfinal game and said the United States would certainly use every possible means to stop him. \u201cI just hope that every possible way is a legal way,\u201d he said at a news conference Monday. As superb as Messi is, some believe that he will not have achieved his true potential until he wins a major trophy for Argentina, just as he has numerous times for the club team Barcelona. But after tying Gabriel Batistuta\u2019s record of 54 international goals for Argentina on Saturday, Messi said he felt no pressure. \u201cI\u2019m always going to be in there,\u201d Messi said. \u201cI\u2019m very calm. \u201d In Maradona\u2019s time, Argentina also had strong supporting players like Claudio Caniggia, Jorge Valdano, Jorge Burruchaga and later Batistuta. But like Messi, Maradona was the team\u2019s clear supremo. When the United States beat Argentina,   at the 1995 Copa Am\u00e9rica, Maradona was no longer playing for his country. But Klinsmann had the chance to play against Maradona several times. In the 1990 World Cup, West Germany beat Maradona\u2019s Argentina,   in a dismal final in Rome. \u201cYou are talking about two wonderful players, the best in the world in their time,\u201d Klinsmann said, referring to Maradona and Messi. \u201cIt\u2019s now Messi\u2019s time, and when I had the opportunity to play many games against Maradona, it was Maradona\u2019s time. We all admire these players. But there are also ways to stop them. I am not the type of person who pulls out old stories and tells the players how we did it. That\u2019s not me, but there are ways to play against these wonderful players. \u201d Klinsmann showed his team video scouting reports of Messi and Argentina and said his players needed to give 10 to 15 percent more in order to achieve an upset Tuesday. But the Argentines are not infallible, he added. They have not won a major tournament in over 20 years, and Messi\u2019s team has come up short twice in the last two years. Germany beat La Albiceleste, as Argentina is known, in the final of the 2014 World Cup, and Chile won in the final of last year\u2019s Copa Am\u00e9rica. Both times, it took champions to beat Messi and Argentina. \u201cYou guys are probably worrying more about Messi than we are,\u201d the United States\u2019 captain, Michael Bradley, told reporters. \u201cVery good player. That\u2019s also probably an understatement. It\u2019s still a soccer game with 11 of their guys against 11 of our guys. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562898.8012342}
