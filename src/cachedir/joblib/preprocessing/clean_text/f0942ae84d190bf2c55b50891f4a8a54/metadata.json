Cuomo, a senior state official and six other people, in a blow to the governor\u2019s innermost circle and a repudiation of the way his prized upstate economic development programs were managed. The charges against the former aides, Joseph Percoco and Todd R. Howe, and the state official, Alain Kaloyeros, were the culmination of a   federal investigation into the Cuomo administration\u2019s efforts to lure jobs and businesses to upstate New York\u2019s limping economy by furnishing billions of dollars in state funds to developers from Buffalo to Albany. In doing so, says a   criminal complaint unsealed on Thursday, Mr. Percoco and Mr. Howe sought to enrich themselves through bribes, using their positions to help particular companies receive \u201chundreds of millions of dollars in state contracts and other official state benefits. \u201d The charges mark the second major inquiry of the Cuomo administration by the office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan eight months ago, after investigating Mr. Cuomo\u2019s handling of an anticorruption panel that he had created and abruptly shut down, Mr. Bharara said there was \u201cinsufficient evidence to prove a federal crime. \u201d At a news conference at which he announced the charges, Mr. Bharara was asked if he would essentially give Mr. Cuomo a \u201cclean bill of health\u201d again. \u201cThere are no allegations of any wrongdoing or misconduct by the governor, anywhere in this complaint,\u201d Mr. Bharara replied. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say. \u201d If the charges did not hit Mr. Cuomo directly, they did hit him in a peripheral and personal manner: Mr. Percoco and Mr. Howe were both loyalists of Mr. Cuomo and his father, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, for whom they had also worked. Andrew Cuomo once referred to Mr. Percoco as \u201cmy father\u2019s third son, who I sometimes think he loved the most. \u201d Mr. Cuomo had also spoken highly of Dr. Kaloyeros, depicting him as a visionary in the field of nanotechnology, which Mr. Cuomo has heralded as a potential boon for the state economy. Mr. Bharara\u2019s office and F. B. I. agents in Buffalo had been examining whether state officials awarded lucrative projects to a few favored developers who had donated to the political campaigns of Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat. One major area of interest was the administration\u2019s plan to inject $1 billion in state funds into   factories, research facilities and other projects, known together as the Buffalo Billion. The resulting investigation yielded a rich narrative of three trusted counselors to Mr. Cuomo conspiring to help the favored contractors, rigging bids and doling out other favorable treatment. The complaint also portrayed the defendants as trying to conceal the schemes, sometimes in unusual ways. In emails and other correspondence, Mr. Percoco and Mr. Howe referred to bribe money as \u201cziti,\u201d a term used in \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d the complaint says. Mr. Percoco, Mr. Howe and others also called one another \u201cHerb\u201d as a term of endearment, while discussing the arrangement. Mr. Bharara said at a news conference on Thursday that he hoped the case would go to trial \u201cso that all New Yorkers can see, in gory detail, what their state government has been up to. \u201d Mr. Percoco, who had served as Mr. Cuomo\u2019s executive deputy secretary, is accused of soliciting and taking more than $315, 000 in bribes from 2012 to 2016 from two companies: Competitive Power Ventures, an energy company that was seeking state approval to build a power plant in the Hudson Valley, and COR Development, a major developer in the Syracuse area that ended up with several large   economic development projects. The bribes were arranged by Mr. Howe, who counted both companies among his clients, the complaint said. Mr. Howe is cooperating with the investigation, prosecutors said, and pleaded guilty this week to extortion, wire fraud and related conspiracy charges. His lawyer, Richard J. Morvillo, would say only that his client \u201chas accepted responsibility for his actions and will testify truthfully if called upon. \u201d In one instance cited in the complaint, prosecutors say Mr. Howe sent an email to Dr. Kaloyeros saying he had \u201cvitals for Buffalo and Syracuse friends. \u201d He was working with a prominent corporate donor, LPCiminelli, a builder based in Buffalo, to create a request for proposals that effectively made LPCiminelli the only eligible bidder. Neither the energy company nor the developers in Buffalo and Syracuse are named in the complaint, but several defendants charged are among the companies\u2019 top officials. They include Peter Galbraith Kelly Jr. who oversaw lobbying and public relations for Competitive Power Ventures, which is based in Maryland and Massachusetts Steven Aiello, the president of COR Development and Joseph Gerardi, another executive at COR. The complaint also charges Louis Ciminelli, the founder of LPCiminelli and Michael Laipple and Kevin Schuler, two other LPCiminelli executives. Mr. Kelly is accused of offering and paying Mr. Percoco more than $287, 000 in bribes in exchange for Mr. Percoco\u2019s help. The payments were made to Lisa   Mr. Percoco\u2019s wife, who was ostensibly employed as a consultant to Competitive Power Ventures\u2019s educational outreach arm starting in 2012. Competitive Power Ventures wanted Mr. Percoco\u2019s help obtaining a state contract worth approximately $100 million to finance its power plant in the Hudson Valley, as well as millions of dollars in energy credits for a power plant it was building in New Jersey. The COR executives, Mr. Aiello and Mr. Gerardi, were accused of giving Mr. Percoco about $35, 000 in bribes to use his position in the governor\u2019s office to promote the company\u2019s economic development projects. According to the complaint, they sought Mr. Percoco\u2019s help in reversing a decision by the state\u2019s economic development agency that would have forced COR  \u2014   Mr. Cuomo\u2019s largest donor in central New York  \u2014   to make an expensive labor peace agreement pushing the state to release payments that it owed to COR and getting a $5, 000 raise for Mr. Aiello\u2019s son, who worked for Mr. Percoco at the governor\u2019s office. The charges in the complaint included bribery, extortion under color of official right, and wire fraud and honest services fraud conspiracies. The defendants appeared in federal courts in Manhattan, Syracuse and Buffalo on Thursday and were ordered released on bond. The expected charges against Mr. Percoco were first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Mr. Percoco\u2019s lawyer, Barry A. Bohrer, characterized the prosecution as \u201can overreach of classic proportions,\u201d adding that a Supreme Court decision in June that overturned the corruption conviction of former Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia established that his client\u2019s conduct was lawful. \u201cMr. Percoco performed services honestly and within the bounds of the law at all times,\u201d Mr. Bohrer said. A lawyer for Mr. Aiello and Mr. Gerardi declined to comment. Mr. Kelly\u2019s lawyer, Daniel M. Gitner, said his client was innocent and \u201cwill be exonerated. \u201d LPCiminelli, citing its three executives named in the complaint, said it was \u201cconfident that all company officials acted appropriately and legally\u201d and would be vindicated. Virtually all the   projects were shaped under the umbrella of the State University of New York Polytechnic Institute and its subsidiaries. The institute is headed by Dr. Kaloyeros, a physicist who has become something of an economic development guru in Albany. Dr. Kaloyeros had been given free rein by Mr. Cuomo to conceive of   economic development projects that could create jobs across the state. Michael C. Miller, a lawyer for Dr. Kaloyeros, said his client was innocent and \u201clooks forward to being exonerated. \u201d Dr. Kaloyeros also was hit with separate charges on Thursday filed by the New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman. Dr. Kaloyeros and Joseph Nicolla of Columbia Development, an   firm, were accused of colluding to make sure Columbia was awarded contracts to build multiple SUNY Polytechnic projects. Mr. Cuomo said Dr. Kaloyeros had been suspended without pay. When news of the investigation into the governor\u2019s former aides broke in April, his office quickly cut ties to both men and ordered its own internal investigation. The results of that inquiry have not been released. Mr. Cuomo said in a statement on Thursday that if the allegations were true, he would be \u201csaddened and profoundly disappointed. \u201d \u201cI hold my administration to the highest level of integrity. I have zero tolerance for abuse of the public trust from anyone,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anything, a friend should be held to an even higher standard. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562412.9056842}
