[Miller spoke with ABC News\u2019 Jonathan Karl and Rick Klein on their \u201cPowerhouse Politics\u201d podcast on Thursday.  Asked about the seemingly \u201cdizzying pace\u201d of Trump\u2019s first two weeks in office, Miller made it clear that Trump is merely fulfilling his campaign promises. \u201cWhat you\u2019ve been seeing,\u201d said Miller, \u201cis President Trump is governing based on the promises he made to the American people during his campaign, and I think that that\u2019s one of the things that the American people find most refreshing and most heartening. He campaigned on building a border wall, he campaigned on getting tough on trade, he campaigned on getting tough on refugees, he campaigned on defending America\u2019s interests in dealing with foreign nations. These are all things he campaigned on and really cross party lines. \u201d Miller also emphasized that it\u2019s Trump\u2019s worldview, developed over the last 30 years, that\u2019s now steering the ship of state within the White House. \u201cThe worldview that the President of the United States has been espousing, he\u2019s been espousing for 30 years,\u201d Miller said. \u201cYou can go back and watch interviews of him in the 1980s talking about the emerging economic turmoil that would be caused by Japan\u2019s product dumping and currency cheating. You can see him talking about threats of terrorism before many people around the country were. You can see him talking about China, talking about NAFTA. It\u2019s really remarkable the extent to which he presaged almost everything that\u2019s relevant and pressing in our politics today over the course of three decades in public life. \u201d Asked \u201cwhat\u2019s been the   and the  \u201d of the past two weeks, Miller rejected the \u201c \u201d characterization, saying, \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a  . \u201d Miller addressed the   controversy surrounding Trump\u2019s executive order temporarily suspending the U. S. Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days while the refugee vetting process is being reviewed. \u201cFor folks in the media centered in New York City, Los Angeles, Washington D. C. the idea of having a curtailment of migration from some of the most dangerous regions in the Middle East strikes them as an enormously disruptive event,\u201d Miller said. \u201cBut for the rest of the country who are worried about their jobs, who are worried about their schools, who are worried about their ability to get a pay raise, who are worried about their ability to be safe and to have a country that supports them  \u2014   for them, those kinds of actions are just the first steps in bringing some kind of sanity to how we approach immigration policy in the United States of America. \u201d He continued, \u201cSo the divergence of perspectives in terms of how people who reap the benefits of globalization look at things, versus people for whom it hasn\u2019t been an unalloyed benefit  \u2014   I think that divergence explains a lot of the difference between the polling data which shows the enormous popularity of his actions and the response you\u2019ll see on certain television networks and some newspapers where they\u2019re, I guess, not happy that things aren\u2019t continuing on in the future as they always have in the past. \u201d Miller also strongly condemned the media\u2019s efforts to inflate the role of White House advisors. Said Miller, \u201cI can state this to you categorically   \u2026     the only person who makes decisions here is Donald Trump. The only person whose vision is executed is Donald Trump. The only person who is guiding the strategy of this White House is Donald Trump. It\u2019s his vision, his policies, his insights. Like I said, he\u2019s been laying out this roadmap for thirty years. \u201d \u201cDonald Trump comes up with the policy,\u201d Miller continued. \u201cHe comes up with the words, he comes up with the vision. He is America First to his core. That\u2019s who Donald Trump is. That\u2019s who he\u2019s always been. \u201d Miller placed Trump in the tradition of America\u2019s great populist leaders, comparing him to the nineteenth century firebrand William Jennings Bryan and to the nation\u2019s first populist president Andrew Jackson. \u201cI\u2019d say [Trump] is the best public orator since William Jennings Bryan, and he has a better sense of the pulse of the people than any President at least since Andrew Jackson. \u201d The media, Miller said, \u201chas constantly both gotten [Trump] wrong, underestimated him, failed to give him his due credit, but what he has accomplished and what he has proven is that he understands and sees in this country and has a vision that has eluded the people that the media held up as the most brilliant consultants, and pollsters, and strategists. And he outsmarted them all. And I just hope the media will give the President the credit he really deserves. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563928.2189536}
