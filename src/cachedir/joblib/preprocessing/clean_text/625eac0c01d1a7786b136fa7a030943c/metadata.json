[Brady highlighted congressional Republicans\u2019 proposal to tax foreign imports and end taxes on   products.  \u201cWe\u2019re going to end the tax on \u2018Made in America,\u2019\u201d Brady said at the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Maryland.  The \u201cMade in America\u201d tax gained its nickname from supporters of   products because   products in the U. S. are taxed at a lower rate than products made in the U. S. Brady and House Republicans have proposed a border adjustment tax that would impose a 20 percent tax on imports and is estimated to raise over a trillion dollars in a decade. President Trump has said that the border tax could boost U. S. jobs, but Marlow wondered whether the tax will have any consequences for small businesses that rely on imports, such as job losses. Marlow said that 97 percent of importers are small business and asked Brady whether the tax would make it harder for small businesses to conduct business. Brady said that foreign products receive a lot of special tax breaks, and \u201ccompetition is best for consumers when everyone is taxed the same. \u201d Brady also advocated for a \u201cfairer, simpler tax code\u201d and said Americans will soon be able to file taxes with less paperwork. \u201cThe tax code will be so fair and so simple, nine out of 10 Americans will be able to file on a   system,\u201d Brady said. Marlow brought up the topic of media bias  \u2014   which, as the    of Breitbart News, was his \u201cfavorite topic. \u201d He asked Brady what he thought of the current \u201cmedia environment\u201d surrounding the issue of taxation. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge, \u201d Brady said. Marlow also highlighted how taxation can be viewed as a moral issue, citing \u201cthe confiscation of wealth from the American people,\u201d and asked Brady whether the issue of taxation should be considered through a \u201cmoral lens. \u201d Brady replied that it should be, citing the \u201cwork, innovation, and value\u201d American workers bring to the economy. Marlow closed the interview by asking Brady what would happen to the death tax in the future. \u201cFor the first time since the death tax was created in 1916, House Republicans propose to permanently kill the death tax,\u201d Brady said.'"}, "time": 1742564485.8424275}
