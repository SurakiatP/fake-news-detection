[In an interview with MSNBC\u2019s Chuck Todd this week, Patinkin said that society had \u201cchosen the Muslim community\u201d as a threat, despite the community making \u201ccontributions to the world of a monumental nature. \u201d  Patinkin also said the show, which has been criticized by the left as \u201cIslamophobic\u201d for linking Islam with terrorism, has taken responsibility for this portrayal and has changed its content so they become \u201cpart of the cure rather than part of the problem. \u201d \u201c[Homeland has introduced] a storyline that shows in this case, in this era, in this season, that maybe it is the white men in government and the military establishment that are the bad guys, not the Muslim community,\u201d he continued.  Patinkin, who plays the role of CIA operative Saul Berenson, has previously discussed the need for America to open up its doors to refugees from the Islamic world, as well as Homeland needing to take responsibility for its negative depictions of Muslims. \u201cIn all kinds of entertainment  \u2014   movies, television  \u2014   there are always the bad guys the cowboys and Indians, then the Russians were the bad guys, the Nazis were the bad guys. Now it seems like Muslim \u2018terrorists\u2019 are the bad guys,\u201d he told the Associated Press in an interview this month. \u201cSo, inadvertently, because it\u2019s an action show, it\u2019s an       political drama that Homeland is, unintentionally we were not helping the Muslim community and we take responsibility for it. And I know I can speak for the writers when they want to right that error that happened because of storytelling. \u201d In a 2015 interview with Variety, the actor advised people to take in refugees and \u201cbring them to your home for dinner,\u201d adding that he simply wants \u201cother people to know the kind of joy that I have in my life. \u201d Homeland, which aired its sixth season finale last Sunday, has been renewed by Showtime for a seventh and final eighth season.
