Note: U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra\u2019ad Al Hussein has really hit the nail on the head here. Not only has he correctly pointed out that Trump, Nigel Farage, Marine LePen, Geert Wilders and the rest of the far-right leaders employ the tactics of fear and bigotry but he also correctly identifies their agenda as being the promotion of hatred with the eventual result that \u2018colossal violence\u2019 will ensue.\\nHowever, he does not go far enough in exposing these scumbags, most likely because he knows he would be placing himself in the crosshairs of the Zionists who stand behind these puppets.\\nWhat went unsaid is that all of these people are stooges for the Zionists and Israel, they are tasked with creating horrible divisions in our societies, turning white against brown and black, Christian against Muslim, indigenous against migrant.\\nThis is the Zionist agenda to weaken and enslave via the strategy of divide and conquer, as laid out in the Protocols of Zion. They want to destroy our nations by promoting inter-racial hatred and violence; they want to see the nation states of the west burn down in a wave of racially motivated violence; that is why Trump spouts such hateful and disgusting rhetoric against Mexicans, blacks and Muslims, it is to promote a race war that would devastate America. \u2014 Ian Greenhalgh, Veterans Today \\n\\nTrump and Europe\u2019s Far-Right Fanning Flames of Hate: UN The United Nations human rights chief on Monday accused U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump of spreading \u201chumiliating racial and religious prejudice\u201d and warned of a rise of populist politics that could turn violent.\\nIn comments at a security and justice conference, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra\u2019ad Al Hussein said he was addressing Dutch far-right leader Geert Wilders and other \u201cpopulists, demagogues and political fantasists.\u201d\\nNaming Trump, Nigel Farage in Britain and Marine Le Pen in France, among others, he accused them of using \u201cfear\u201d tactics similar to those of the Islamic State group, also known by its Arabic acronym, Daesh.\\n\u201cMake no mistake, I certainly do not equate the actions of nationalist demagogues with those of Daesh,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in its mode of communication, its use of half-truths and oversimplification, the propaganda of Daesh uses tactics similar to those of the populists.\u201d\\nIn a tweet, Wilders called Zeid \u201can idiot.\u201d\\nZeid labelled Wilders\u2019 March 2017 election platform, which calls for no Muslim immigrants, the closing of mosques and the banning of the Quran, as \u201cgrotesque.\u201d\\n\u201cThe U.N. is grotesque,\u201d Wilders responded. \u201cLet\u2019s get rid of these bureaucrats.\u201d\\nBut Zeid said Wilders\u2019 rhetoric could have terrible consequences.\\n\u201cHistory has perhaps taught Mr. Wilders and his ilk how effectively xenophobia and bigotry can be weaponized,\u201d he said.\\n\u201cThe atmosphere will become thick with hate; at this point it can descend rapidly into colossal violence,\u201d he warned.\\nSource: Telesur \\nVia: Veterans Today \\nMore from Political Insider\u2026 Just 11 Days Before the Election, Israel Sends Incredible Message to Donald Trump! WHOA \\nAmerica is supporting Donald Trump, and his message to clean up the corrupt federal government is winning over millions of voters.\\nIt\u2019s a refreshing message, and Trump\u2019s conservative vision is why he earned more votes than any Republican primary candidate in history!\\nIn fact, Trump is so popular, his support is world-wide.\\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s going on in Jerusalem now. There is a clear message here that Hillary Clinton can\u2019t be happy about.\\nAs Yahoo News reports :\\nOn a rooftop overlooking the walls of Jerusalem\u2019s Old City, around 200 American-Israeli fans of Donald Trump gathered to proclaim their support for the Republican candidate, convinced he will be Israel\u2019s best friend if elected.\\nWearing \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d baseball caps, the small crowd, ranging from Holocaust survivors in their 80s to grinning teenagers in Trump t-shirts, said they didn\u2019t care about the sexual assault allegations against the candidate or the online anti-Semitism of some of his supporters.\\n\u201cTrump will let Israel be itself and make its own decisions, that\u2019s what I like,\u201d David Weissman, a 35-year-old from Queens, New York, who moved to Israel three years ago, said at the event late on Wednesday.\\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a saint, but look at his achievements. He\u2019s not afraid to identify the enemy as radical Islam, and he\u2019s not going to support the two-state solution,\u201d he said, referring to long-standing efforts to forge peace with the Palestinians.\\nClearly, the people of Israel have seen the mess caused in the Middle East by 8 years of weakness from President Barack Obama\u2019s White House.\\n\\nAfter Obama\u2019s devastating and illegal pay-off to the Iranian regime, the Israeli people have a lot riding on the 2016 presidential election. They can\u2019t continue to protect their citizens from harm if liberals in America keep funding their enemies.\\nThis is why Trump is popular in Israel:\\n\\nOn day 1, Trump will have a better relationship with Israel than Obama ever had. Israel is our ally, and they deserve our support.\\nSource: Political Insider \\n'"}, "time": 1742562127.021592}
