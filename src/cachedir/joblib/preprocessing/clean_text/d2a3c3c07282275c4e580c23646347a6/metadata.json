Ron Johnson ( ) concluded a visit to the border on Friday with a tough message for \u201csanctuary city\u201d jurisdictions, including California. [Standing on an access road on the U. S. side of the border, Secretary Kelly began a press briefing by reaffirming the Trump administration\u2019s commitment to border security, including a \u201cphysical barrier\u201d along the southern border.  He also emphasized the importance of stopping human trafficking along the border. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing the Attorney General and I want more than to put human smugglers out of business,\u201d he said. Kelly cited drastic reductions in the number of illegal border crossings, which he said were down 64% from the same period last year. The reason, he said, was that the Trump administration had shown \u201cwe\u2019re serious about border security and enforcing our immigration laws. \u201d Attorney General Sessions spoke about the boost in morale among law enforcement staff, and praised the progress of the Trump administration. \u201cIt\u2019s exceeded what I thought possible so far,\u201d Sessions said. He warned about the danger of infiltration by gangs like   \u201cwhose motto is \u2018murder, rape, and control,\u2019\u201d he said. And then the Attorney General launched a broadside against sanctuary cities  \u2014   and the   \u201csanctuary state\u201d of California. \u201cIt was nearly two years ago that Kate Steinle was shot and killed, dying in her father\u2019s arms, along Pier 14 in San Francisco,\u201d Attorney General Sessions recalled. \u201cThe alleged shooter was an illegal immigrant with seven prior felony convictions who had been deported from this country five times. Only weeks earlier, the city had released him from custody, after being apprehended again, even though the federal immigration authorities had filed a detainer requesting that he be held in custody until they could remove him for deportation proceedings. Even worse, this man admitted he came to San Francisco in part because of its sanctuary policies. \u201cSo today, the Department of Justice sent letters to nine jurisdictions that were identified  \u2014   by the Obama administration  \u2014   as having policies that potentially violate federal law and which receive millions in federal grants. These jurisdictions have until June 30th to send their legal justifications for why they are not in violation of federal law  \u2014   and the state of California is one of these jurisdictions.   \u2026     Sanctuary jurisdictions have put known gang members back on the streets. \u201d He concluded: \u201cI urge New York, California, and other jurisdictions to reconsider. \u201d The California State Senate recently passed a \u201csanctuary state\u201d bill, SB 54, that still awaits passage by the State Assembly before proceeding to Governor Jerry Brown\u2019s desk.  Kelly, Sessions, and Johnson were concluding a   visit to the border, which began in El Paso, Texas on Thursday and concluded in San Diego at the Otai Mesa Detention Facility. The press conference was held in between two existing border fences  \u2014   a thin, rusted corrugated iron fence on the Mexican side, and a tall,    American fence. In the distance, the new pedestrian walkway between Tijuana\u2019s airport and San Diego hovered over the boundary. Johnson, who serves as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, said: \u201cOne of the main reasons we come here, in addition to learning   \u2026     is to thank the men and women\u201d of law enforcement. He reiterated that the Trump administration, in contrast to his predecessor, had prioritized helping border patrol and enforcing the law. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to apologize,\u201d he said, for enforcing the law and keeping the country safe. Asked by a local reporter to respond to the argument by sanctuary cities that enforcing immigration law would hurt local policing, Sessions described that as more of an \u201cexcuse\u201d than a reason, suggesting that it was driven by ideology rather than evidence. He rejected an accusation earlier Friday by California State Senate President pro Tem Kevin De Le\u00f3n (  Angeles) that he and the Department of Justice were basing their law enforcement efforts on \u201cprinciples of white supremacy. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of extremist statement that I totally reject,\u201d Sessions said. He also defended his recent comment about a ruling in a federal court in Hawaii that stopped President Trump\u2019s executive order suspending travel from six   countries from going into effect. Earlier Friday, Secretary Kelly told Kate Bolduan of CNN that President Barack Obama had presided over a \u201cvery, very open border\u201d and that Obama had done \u201cnothing\u201d to secure the border and enforce immigration law internally. Outside the event, about a dozen demonstrators from the Remembrance Project, which commemorates victims killed by illegal aliens, gathered to support the Trump administration\u2019s efforts.  Vaught Becht of Orange County gave the administration an \u201c \u201d for its work on immigration and border security thus far. \u201cI think they\u2019re doing a great job. We\u2019ve got a new era. [Trump] supports the citizens. America first, and jobs first. We\u2019ve got a new sheriff in town. He speaks for the American people, not the swamp in D. C. He speaks for us. \u201d Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News. He was named one of the \u201cmost influential\u201d people in news media in 2016.
