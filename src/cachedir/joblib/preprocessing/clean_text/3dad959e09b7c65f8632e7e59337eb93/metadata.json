Mr Tusk said that once the regional votes had taken place, he will inform Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Any extra concessions given to Wallonia may mean other countries will want to look again at the deal, however.\u201d (The BBC\u2019s headline, then \u2014 \u201cEU-Canada trade deal: Belgians break Ceta deadlock\u201d \u2014 is quite irresponsible. As is\u2013 \\nCETA: \u201cBelgium breaks Ceta deadlock\u201d [ EUObserver ]. Not quite: \\nBelgium\u2019s political entities agreed to a declaration on Thursday (26 October), which gives their government a green light to sign Ceta, the EU-Canada trade pact. \\nThe agreement was promptly sent to EU ambassadors in Brussels, to be discussed later in the afternoon. \\nAfter a week of marathon negotiations, Belgian prime minister Charles Michel said that Thursday\u2019s talks had calmed \u201coutstanding concerns\u201d. \\nAs part of the trade-off, Belgium will ask the European Court of Justice to clarify the proposed investment court system, which was one of the most controversial elements of the trade deal. \\nCeta was due to be signed off by EU leaders and Canada\u2019s prime minister Justin Trudeau at a summit in Brussels on Thursday. Trudeau cancelled the trip during the night as no agreement had been reached in Brussels. \\nIt\u2019s not known when the summit will take place, or whether the Belgian go-ahead was the last hurdle. \\nThe other 27 EU countries must first accept the Belgian deal. \\nAt their meeting on Thursday, EU ambassadors will be accompanied by lawyers and representatives of the EU institutions, who will examine the legality and consequences of the text. \\nThe Walloon parliament will vote on the agreement on Friday. \\nStill, how do we slay these undead deals? The same thing happened with TPP. \\nCETA: \u201cThe great CETA swindle\u201d [ Corporate Europe Observatory ]. \u201cThe latest PR move is a \u201cjoint interpretative declaration\u201d on the trade deal hammered out by Ottawa and Brussels and published by investigative journalist collective Correctiv last Friday. It is designed to alleviate public concerns but in fact does nothing to fix CETA\u2019s flaws. In September, Canada\u2019s Trade Minister, Chrystia Freeland, and her German counterpart, Sigmar Gabriel, had announced such a text to appease Social Democrats, trade unions and the wider public who fear that CETA would threaten public services, labour and environmental standards and undermine governments\u2019 right to regulate in the public interest. Several governments, notably Austria, had linked their \u2018yes\u2019 to CETA to the declaration. [But] According to environmental group Greenpeace, the declaration therefore has the \u2018legal weight of a holiday brochure\u2019.\u201d \\nLegal experts have also warned that the declaration \u201ccould be misleading for non-lawyers, who might think that the Declaration will alter or override the CETA\u201d. But it does not change CETA\u2019s legal terms \u2013 and it is these terms which have raised concerns. As Canadian law Professor Gus van Harten explains: \u201cBased on principles of treaty interpretation, the CETA will be interpreted primarily according to the text of its relevant provisions\u2026. The Declaration would play a subsidiary role, if any, in this interpretative process.\u201d In other words, legally (and thus politically), the CETA text is far more important than the declaration \u2013 and the former could prevail over the latter in case of a conflictive interpretation. \\nThe post then goes on to analyze the provisions of the declaration in detail, comparing them to the text. (Readers may remember that TPP advocates have made the same sort of claim for the TPP Preamble, which the text also over-rides . So, the Belgians are smart to get a court ruling on this. And we might also expect the adminsitration to use similar tactics to (the toothless distraction of) the CETA \u201cresolution\u201d in the upcoming attempt to pass the TPP. \\n\u201cBelgian officials were discussing a working document aimed at addressing Wallonia\u2019s concerns on the trade deal. The document, published by Belgian state media RTBF, shows that Belgium is moving toward requesting additional safeguards for the agricultural sector \u2018in cases of market turbulence.\u2019 It also puts forward a number of requests regarding the investor court system, including \u2018progressing towards hiring judges on a permanent basis'\u201d [ Politico ]. This seems to be a different document from the \u201cdeclaration\u201d; it was leaked by a different source. Here is is; it\u2019s in French . \\nTPP: \u201cEight major financial services industry associations made an appeal to congressional leaders to support passage of the TPP this year, arguing that the deal is \u2018vital to ensuring that the U.S. financial services sector remains a vibrant engine for domestic and global growth'\u201d [ Politico ]. What the heck is a \u201cvibrant engine\u201d? Maybe a screw loose or something? Needs a tightening to stop the shaking and shimmying? \\nTPP: \u201cHealth, labor and consumer groups are warning President Barack Obama to refrain from including a 12-year monopoly period for biological drugs in legislation to implement the TPP as a means for addressing congressional concerns over the pact. The groups argue that such a move could undermine future efforts to shorten that protection period under U.S. law\u201d [ Politico ]. \u201cThe letter, signed by Doctors Without Borders, the AFL-CIO, AARP, Oxfam and Consumers Union, also expresses concern over reports that the administration is prepared to negotiate side letters with TPP countries to reinforce U.S. lawmaker demands that countries respect a 12-year protection period, which reflects U.S. law.\u201d \\n\u201cThe case against free trade \u2013 Part 1\u201d [ Bill Mitchell ]. \\n2016 \\nDays until: 11.

The distinction is illustrated in US polling by the difference between the small share of Americans who believe the country is moving in the right direction (29%) and majority who approve of the job President Obama is doing (52%). \\nSecond. While the polls conducted on the eve of the referendum vote showed \u201cremain\u201d with a 4.6pp lead, in contrast to the 3.8pp actual vote margin in favor of \u201cleave\u201d, an average of polls published by the Economist magazine the day before the election showed a tied race, and showed \u201cleave\u201d leading for much of the prior month. As much as 10% of the public in many of these surveys was also undecided. By contrast, Sec. Clinton has led the average of presidential polls consistently for more than a year, with the exception of one week in late July following the Republican convention, and for most of the last year her lead has been substantial, averaging 4pp since the last primary elections were held. \\nIncludes a wrap-up of polling methodologies as well. \\nThe Trail \\n\u201cWin or lose, the Republican candidate and his inner circle have built a direct marketing operation that could power a TV network\u2014or finish off the GOP\u201d [ Bloomberg ].

This year, however, is the first time in at least six decades that the Democratic nominee is positioned to win a majority of these upscale voters\u201d [ New York Times ]. \u201cWhat these figures suggest is that the 2016 election will represent a complete inversion of the New Deal order among white voters. From the 1930s into the 1980s and early 1990s, majorities of downscale whites voted Democratic and upscale whites voted Republican. Now, looking at combined male and female vote totals, the opposite is true.\u201d \\n\u201cElizabeth Warren, the Democrats\u2019 Madame Defarge, and Bernie Sanders, winner of 22 millennial-fueled primaries, are going to guarantee the revolution\u2019s purity in any Clinton presidency\u201d [ Wall Street Journal , \u201cThe Warren-Sanders Presidency\u201d]. \u201cFor starters, they have a list.

These results should give a boost to the business investment component of tomorrow\u2019s third-quarter GDP report. But the bad news is the indication on future core shipments as orders fell a very steep 1.2 percent. \u2026 A concern in the report is continuing contraction in unfilled orders\u2026.\u201d But: \u201cThis series has wide swings monthly so our primary metric is the three month rolling average which improved but remains in contracton.

But: \u201cThe unadjusted data shows the rate of year-over-year growth slowed this month.
