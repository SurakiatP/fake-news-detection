[Elizabeth Handy and Bilal Walk say that the Georgia Department of Health refused to give a birth certificate to their infant daughter with the last name \u201cAllah,\u201d the Atlanta   reported.  The state of Georgia, on the other hand, says that their daughter\u2019s name, ZalyKha Graceful Lorraina Allah, does not follow state law that requires the child\u2019s last name to be Handy, Walk, or a combination of the two. The American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia has stepped in to represent the couple, who say they cannot get a Social Security number for their daughter because she has no birth certificate and could potentially face issues with traveling, health care access, and enrolling in schools. \u201cWe have to make sure that the state isn\u2019t overstepping their boundaries,\u201d Walk said. \u201cIt is just plainly unfair and a violation of our rights. \u201d Lawyers representing the Department of Public Health say that Georgia state law \u201crequires that a baby\u2019s surname be either that of the father of the mother for purposes of the initial birth record. \u201d Once the birth record is created, the parents can petition the superior court to change ZalyKha\u2019s surname, according to general counsel Sidney Barrett. ACLU Georgia Executive Director Andrea Young argues that the state\u2019s decision is an example of government overreach that violates the First and 14th Amendments. The couple also claims that they were able to get a birth certificate for their    son named Masterful Allah without a problem. Lawyers for Handy and Walk say the couple has been unable to obtain Medicaid coverage and food stamps through the SNAP program. The couple said they wanted to name their child Allah because it was a \u201cnoble\u201d name and denied that it was for religious reasons. \u201cSimply put, we have a personal understanding that we exercise in regards to the names,\u201d Walk said. \u201cIt is nothing that we want to go into detail about, because it is not important. What is important is the language of the statute and our rights as parents. \u201d This is not the first time the state has rejected a request to name a child after a religious figure. A Tennessee judge rejected a family\u2019s request to name their son \u201cMessiah\u201d in 2014 because she believed Messiah could only describe Jesus Christ and placed an \u201cundue burden\u201d on the child that he could not fulfill. That judge was later fired, and the judge\u2019s decision was overturned.'"}, "time": 1742562067.2448287}
