Bannon, the raw and rumpled former chairman of Breitbart News who considers himself a \u201cvirulently  \u201d revolutionary out to destroy the \u201cadministrative state. \u201d But behind the scenes, White House officials said, the ideologist who enjoyed the president\u2019s confidence became increasingly embattled as other advisers, including Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter and    complained about setbacks on health care and immigration. Lately, Mr. Bannon has been conspicuously absent from some meetings. And now he has lost his seat at the national security table. In a move that was widely seen as a sign of changing fortunes, Mr. Trump removed Mr. Bannon, his chief strategist, from the National Security Council\u2019s   \u201cprincipals committee\u201d on Wednesday. The shift was orchestrated by Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, who insisted on purging a political adviser from the Situation Room where decisions about war and peace are made. Mr. Bannon resisted the move, even threatening at one point to quit if it went forward, according to a White House official who, like others, insisted on anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Mr. Bannon\u2019s camp denied that he had threatened to resign and spent the day spreading the word that the shift was a natural evolution, not a signal of any diminution of his outsize influence. His allies said privately that Mr. Bannon had been put on the principals committee to keep an eye on Mr. Trump\u2019s first national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, a retired   general who lasted just 24 days before being forced out for misleading Vice President Mike Pence and other White House officials about what he had discussed with Russia\u2019s ambassador. With Mr. Flynn gone, these allies said, there was no need for Mr. Bannon to remain, but they noted that he had kept his security clearance. \u201cSusan Rice operationalized the N. S. C. during the last administration,\u201d Mr. Bannon said in a statement, referring to President Barack Obama\u2019s national security adviser. \u201cI was put on the N. S. C. with General Flynn to ensure that it was  . General McMaster has returned the N. S. C. to its proper function. \u201d Mr. Bannon did not explain what he meant by \u201coperationalized\u201d or how his presence on the committee had ensured it would not be. It was one more drama in a White House consumed by palace intrigue, where officials jockey for the ear of the president, angle for authority and seek to place blame for political defeats. Even as Mr. Bannon lost a national security credential, Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s    and senior adviser, seems to be acting as a shadow secretary of state, visiting Iraq and taking on China, Mexico and Middle East portfolios. Mr. Bannon\u2019s many enemies, inside and outside the White House, celebrated what they saw as a defeat for his brand of fiery, nationalist politics. \u201cHe didn\u2019t belong on the principals committee to begin with  \u2014   doesn\u2019t really belong in the White House at all,\u201d said Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. \u201cI hope that this is a sign that McMaster is taking control of the National Security Council. \u201d Karl Rove  \u2014   who, as senior adviser to President George W. Bush, was not allowed to join national security meetings  \u2014   said it was a move back to a better process. \u201cIt was wrong for him to be added in the first place, and it was right to take him off,\u201d he said. Even if Mr. Bannon really was removed only because there was no longer a need for someone to mind Mr. Flynn, Mr. Rove added, the end result was a victory for General McMaster. \u201cIt\u2019s either a sign of McMaster\u2019s strength, or the result is it strengthens McMaster,\u201d he said. Still, Mr. Bannon, who has been under attack from outside the administration since the early days of the transition, is a crafty survivor, and insiders warned that it would be a mistake to underestimate him. When General McMaster wanted to fire a staff member, Ezra   Mr. Bannon intervened to save his job. Mr.   had alerted colleagues that Mr. Trump\u2019s associates had been caught up in surveillance of foreigners, information then shown by another White House official to Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, which is investigating Russian meddling in last year\u2019s election. James Jeffrey, a deputy national security adviser to Mr. Bush, said General McMaster appeared to have \u201cscored one on the presumably more powerful Bannon,\u201d but cautioned against reading too much into what it meant for Mr. Bannon. \u201cHe seems to be very close to the president and, by most accounts, still wins many of his battles,\u201d Mr. Jeffrey said. From the start, General McMaster intended to revamp the National Security Council organization that he inherited from Mr. Flynn. The principals committee, which is led by the national security adviser and includes the vice president, secretary of state, defense secretary and others, is the primary   body deciding questions that do not rise to the level of the president and framing those that do. The initial structure approved by Mr. Trump not only gave Mr. Bannon formal membership on the committee, but also downgraded the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the director of national intelligence to occasional participants as issues demanded. In addition to removing Mr. Bannon, the new order issued by Mr. Trump, dated Tuesday and made public on Wednesday, restored the Joint Chiefs chairman and intelligence director and added the energy secretary, C. I. A. director and United Nations ambassador. It also put the Homeland Security Council under General McMaster rather than making it a separate entity, as Mr. Trump\u2019s original order had done. Mr. Trump was angry over the fallout from his first order, feeling that he had not been properly warned about its implications. He briefly considered reversing it the same weekend it was announced, according to a person with direct knowledge, but decided against it for fear of creating more of a public storm. For the first two months of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, Mr. Bannon occupied an unassailable perch at the president\u2019s side  \u2014   ramming through key elements of his eclectic and   populist agenda, including two executive orders on freezing immigration from several predominantly Muslim countries. Mr. Trump viewed Mr. Bannon as a   kindred spirit who favored his own    communications strategy. But blunders by Mr. Bannon\u2019s team  \u2014   especially the first immigration order, which was rejected by multiple courts  \u2014   have undermined his position. His    style was not a winning strategy on Capitol Hill, and Mr. Bannon declined to take a significant part. Experienced politicians, including Mr. Pence and Mr. Trump\u2019s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, stepped into more expansive roles as negotiations over the failed health care overhaul dragged on. Mr. Trump initially supported Mr. Bannon\u2019s      final message to holdouts in the House Freedom Caucus. But, needing a win, the president grew skeptical and authorized Mr. Pence to resume health care talks, with Mr. Bannon playing more of a supporting role, according to three people close to Mr. Trump. Mr. Bannon has also been at odds with Gary Cohn, the president\u2019s national economics adviser. Mr. Cohn is close with Mr. Kushner, who has said privately that he fears that Mr. Bannon plays to the president\u2019s worst impulses, according to people with direct knowledge of such discussions. Moreover, Mr. Bannon\u2019s   reputation has chafed on a president who sees himself as the West Wing\u2019s only leading man. Several associates said the president had quietly expressed annoyance over the credit Mr. Bannon had received for setting the agenda  \u2014   and Mr. Trump was not pleased by the \u201cPresident Bannon\u201d   theme promoted by magazines,   talk shows and Twitter. Yet there is a risk for Mr. Trump in appearing to minimize Mr. Bannon, a hero to the nationalist,   base that helped drive Mr. Trump to an Electoral College victory. With his approval ratings at historic lows for so early in a presidency, he is counting on the same people who see Mr. Bannon as their champion  \u2014   just as Mr. Bannon is counting on Mr. Trump to retain his place in the White House inner circle.'"}, "time": 1742561966.722952}
