Republicans denounced what they said was the Obama administration\u2019s harsh treatment of a steadfast ally and Democrats signaled that they were uneasy with Mr. Kerry\u2019s pressure on Israel, even as they praised the effort to promote Middle East peace. In Europe, however, Mr. Kerry\u2019s speech was greeted warmly, with officials calling it a courageous and thoughtful effort to salvage the idea of a   solution for the Israelis and Palestinians. Still, across the Arab world, his harsh words for Israel were met with a collective shrug, coming at the end of eight years of Obama administration policies that left many in the Middle East frustrated. On Capitol Hill, hours after Mr. Kerry used what may be his last major address to bluntly inform the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, that \u201cfriends need to tell each other the hard truths,\u201d he received a reminder of the deep support Israel enjoys in an otherwise sharply divided Congress. \u201cWhile he may not have intended it, I fear Secretary Kerry, in his speech and action at the U. N. has emboldened extremists on both sides,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer, the incoming Senate Democratic leader. A bipartisan chorus of lawmakers, upset with President Obama\u2019s decision last week to allow the passage of a United Nations resolution condemning Israel\u2019s construction of settlements in disputed territory, made clear that they were looking past the departing administration. Senator Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, said he shared Mr. Kerry\u2019s concerns \u201cwith the lack of forward progress on a   solution. \u201d But Mr. Cardin also said he was unhappy that Mr. Obama had not vetoed the United Nations resolution, instead abstaining from the vote. He pledged to \u201cexplore congressional action that can mitigate the negative implications\u201d of it. The most ardent supporters of Israel in Congress seemed just as liberated as Mr. Kerry was to let loose. \u201cSecretary Kerry\u2019s speech today was at best a pointless tirade in the waning days of an outgoing administration,\u201d said Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. \u201cAt worst, it was another dangerous outburst that will further Israel\u2019s diplomatic isolation and embolden its enemies. \u201d Representative Eliot L. Engel of New York, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called Mr. Kerry\u2019s speech \u201cgratuitous\u201d and \u201cwrong. \u201d \u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem any purpose to this other than to embarrass Israel,\u201d Mr. Engel said. \u201cIt just pained me to watch it. \u201d Democratic members of Congress who are closer to Mr. Kerry, a former senator, and the Obama administration were more measured. Many had been angered by Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s decision last year to accept an invitation from the   House to deliver a speech in the Capitol, where he confronted the president over the Iran nuclear accord. Yet even these Democrats  \u2014   eyeing the arrival of a Republican    that has vowed strong support for Israel  \u2014   left little doubt that they were parting ways with Mr. Obama on the substance of the United Nations resolution. Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, who is facing   in 2018, said he knew why Mr. Kerry was frustrated over the settlements, which he called an \u201cimpediment toward a negotiated   solution. \u201d But he was quick to note that he was among the 88 senators who signed a letter months ago opposing the sort of United Nations resolution on Israel that the Security Council approved last week. In France, Britain and Germany, Mr. Kerry\u2019s speech was greeted with more   support. Senator Nathalie Goulet, vice president of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the French Senate, said Mr. Kerry \u201cis right, he is absolutely right. \u201d \u201cThe more there are settlements,\u201d she said, \u201cthe less it is likely there will be a   solution. But nobody ever dares condemn Israel. There is a double standard that nourishes the propaganda of the terrorists. \u201d In a statement, the German foreign minister,   Steinmeier, praised Mr. Kerry\u2019s speech as a \u201cpassionate and deeply convincing\u201d defense of \u201cthe only credible way\u201d to solve the issue: a   solution. British officials said they regarded Mr. Kerry\u2019s speech as a thoughtful summary of longstanding British and European concerns about the direction of Israeli politics. Britain and France, both members of the Security Council, voted for the resolution on settlements, and France has been extremely active in pressing for a kind of peace conference, to which the Israelis have objected. In the Arab world, analysts said the Obama administration should have spoken out sooner. \u201cAt the last five minutes of the hour, apparently Kerry and Obama are showing some courage to stand up to Israel, but it is coming too late in the game,\u201d said Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a professor of political science in the United Arab Emirates. \u201cIt is after the fact. They should have shown this amount of political courage four years ago, if not eight years ago. \u201d But the Palestinian issue today is not as central as it once was in the wider Arab consciousness. \u201cArab countries have sociopolitical problems that trump the Palestinian cause,\u201d said Ziad A. Akl, a senior researcher at the Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies in Cairo.'"}, "time": 1742628508.4503734}
