A decision made by General Motors years ago to save a few dollars per airbag may have led to the widespread use of the faulty Takata technology that has been blamed in the deaths of 14 people and become the subject of the auto industry\u2019s largest recall. A Times investigation revealed that the automaker switched its supplier to Takata despite signs that ammonium nitrate, a compound used in its devices, was unsafe. Takata continues to manufacture airbags with the compound  \u2014   and automakers continue to buy them. ______ 2. Hillary Clinton\u2019s speech on Thursday found an unusual audience cheering it on: the \u201c \u201d crowd that she denounced in her remarks. Though Donald J. Trump has publicly kept his distance from the   her attack on him for fanning the flames of racism embraced by the community was celebrated by its leaders, who did their best to capitalize on the moment. And in Youngstown, Ohio, above,  \u2014   a   Midwestern stronghold  \u2014   residents are wrestling with whether a Manhattan billionaire can revitalize a struggling Rust Belt town. ______ 3. One of our most read stories examines the ultraconservative strain of Islam known as Wahhabism that is taught in Saudi Arabia, and its effect on Muslim communities around the world. The wealthy nation has spent lavishly on religious outreach for half a century, spreading a view of Islam that many believe has helped to fuel global extremism. Yet Saudi leaders seek good relations with the West and see jihadist violence as a menace. \u201cI\u2019d be careful about blaming the Saudis,\u201d said a former U. S. ambassador to Syria and Algeria. ______ 4. France\u2019s highest administrative court has overturned a town\u2019s ban on   burkinis, the   swimwear used by some Muslim women. The ruling applies only to   above, a seaside resort of about 14, 000, but means that bans enacted by other municipalities  \u2014   there are at least 30 of them  \u2014   could be similarly struck down if challenged in court. ______ 5. The U. S. Open begins Monday in New York, and much attention will be focused on whether the era of the Big Four in the men\u2019s game is over. Roger Federer won\u2019t be playing, Rafael Nadal is often coping with injuries and Novak Djokovic lost at Wimbledon. That leaves Andy Murray as the last of the establishment vanguard. One of our contributors lists some    picks to keep an eye on in both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s fields. ______ 6. It\u2019s likely that the Federal Reserve will raise its benchmark interest rate in the coming months, Janet L. Yellen, above, the Fed chairwoman, said during an annual policy conference. Gains in the job market and the economic outlook have strengthened the case for a rate increase, she said, but analysts think an increase won\u2019t happen before December. ______ 7. America\u2019s new pharmaceutical villain is defending herself and her company from scrutiny over a sharp price increase on the lifesaving EpiPen. \u201cI am running a business. I am a   business. I am not hiding from that,\u201d said Heather Bresch, whose total compensation at Mylan has gone from about $2. 5 million to nearly $19 million during the same time the EpiPen\u2019s price has risen fourfold. But Ms. Bresch moved quickly to reduce the    cost to patients after a public furor over the price increase, though the list price remains at about $600. ______ 8. Frank Ocean\u2019s album release last weekend is delighting fans but also highlighting the tension between artists, record companies and streaming services. Mr. Ocean, above, apparently was able to cut his record company out of the profits for one of the year\u2019s   albums by releasing \u201cBlonde\u201d a day after fulfilling his contractual agreement to the company with a separate \u201cvisual album. \u201d And Kanye West also made waves in the music world with the opening night of his \u201cSaint Pablo\u201d tour, performing the entire show on Thursday from floating platforms instead of a formal stage. ______ 9. Like others before them, they moved to the United States from Italy and made a life for themselves in New York City. And now, many appear to be moving to the suburbs. But these residents are different: They are lizards. A biologist is studying the Italian wall lizard, above, to learn how it\u2019s adapted to a colder and more crowded environment. They appear to be following conventional routes out of the city: the   train tracks. ______ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern.
