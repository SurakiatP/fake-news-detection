The festivities began in the wee hours of April 22 in New Zealand, then followed the sun to circumnavigate the globe. The event\u2019s blog reported 50 celebrants showed up at Antarctic research stations, and 2 very intrepid souls showed up in   degree weather at the North Pole. Although it seemed that the media in many locations outnumbered the demonstrators, San Francisco and Washinton, D. C. both produced about 5, 000 marchers. The March for Science website in January trumpeted, under \u201cDiversity and Inclusion Principles\u201c: \u201cColonization, racism, native rights, sexism, ableism,        econ justice are scientific rights. \u201d But as the event neared, the scientific communism of Marx and Engle\u2019s Das Capital morphed into Principals and Goals: \u201cOur wealth of personal experiences and perspectives is our greatest strength. In putting the people who do science at the forefront of this discussion, we can show that scientists come from all cultural backgrounds, belief systems, orientations, genders, and abilities. \u201d Honorary   Bill Nye the Science Guy said, \u201cWe march forward to ensure a better world for people all over the world. \u201d But he and Senator Bernie Sanders ( ) made it clear in their February Facebook Live \u201cConversation on Climate Change\u201d that they believe all skeptics of climate change are suffering from cognitive dissonance. The most interesting coverage of the event came from Science magazine, which   the events with about 60 posts over 24 hours. Demonstrating the tenuous connection between the \u201cMarch for Science\u201d and actual scientists, the first April 22 speaker at the New Zealand event was leftist Green Party   James Shaw, who is a former accountant with no science background. Shaw said, \u201cWhen politicians use their belief systems to override the facts, the scientific facts, we are all in for a whole world of hurt. \u201d Shaw then droned on about his social justice belief system that New Zealanders needed to stand up against the U. S. political discourse questioning climate change.'"}, "time": 1742564495.3283806}
