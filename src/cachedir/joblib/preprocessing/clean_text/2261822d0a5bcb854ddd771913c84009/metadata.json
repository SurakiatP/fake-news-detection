S. funding of the United Nations Population Fund  \u2014   an agency that human rights activists have linked to the support of population control programs such as China\u2019s coercive abortion \u201c  policy. \u201d[The halt to the funding of the United Nations Population Fund  \u2014   known as UNFPA  \u2014   comes as Trump is scheduled this week to host Chinese President Xi Jinping at the president\u2019s    resort in Florida.  In January, Trump signed an executive order that reinstated the \u201cMexico City Policy,\u201d which concerns U. S. aid for abortions overseas. The president updated the policy by directing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to implement a plan that expands the policy across all global health assistance funding. The directive means that U. S. taxpayer dollars will no longer be supporting organizations that promote or participate in the management of a coercive abortion program, such as that espoused by China. A report by the Associated Press states that as a result of the end of U. S. funding of UNFPA, $32. 5 million will shift to the U. S. Agency for International Development (USAID) which has the goal of reducing maternal deaths and practices such as genital mutilation. As Breitbart News reported in December 2015, Rep. Chris Smith ( )   of the Congressional Executive Committee on China, observed during a hearing, \u201cThe Chinese government is not the only one culpable in these heinous crimes against women and children. The UN Population Fund helped fund birth restrictions, fund forced abortions, and a massive and coercive family planning bureaucracy. \u201d \u201cThe UNFPA whitewashed China\u2019s crimes for decades and continues to do so today,\u201d the congressman continued, adding that on its website UNFPA \u201cjustifies its history in China, saying it was \u2018tasked by the Executive Committee\u2019 to help China and had to \u2018engage with China as a sovereign nation. \u2019\u201d More than a year ago, China announced that it had switched to a \u201c  policy,\u201d one that Smith said only continues the country\u2019s longstanding attempts to control family life: The \u201c  policy\u201d may possibly become a \u201c  policy\u201d but China\u2019s police state population control policies will not end anytime soon. The Chinese government retains the power to tell couples what their families must look like and the power to punish those who disobey birth quotas. For the past 35 years the Chinese government has wasted precious human potential and sanctioned   violence against women and children \u2014  enabled by   groups globally and the United Nations Population Fund. No one should applaud China\u2019s announced \u201c \u201d policy instead we should be insisting they abolish intrusive and abusive birth restrictions forever. Trump\u2019s reinstatement of the Mexico City Policy was criticized in February by Bill and Melinda Gates, whose foundation has as its focus the support of family planning across the globe.  The Gates Foundation is also criticizing Trump\u2019s foreign aid cuts: Foreign aid and access to contraceptives can be smart investments in a more stable and prosperous future. https:  .   \u2014   Gates Foundation (@gatesfoundation) April 3, 2017,  \u201cWe\u2019re concerned that this shift could impact millions of women and girls around the world,\u201d Melinda Gates told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s likely to have a negative effect on a broad range of health programs that provide lifesaving treatment and prevention options to those most in need\u201d: In Indonesia, I saw more proof that when we invest in contraceptives, we invest in a more stable  prosperous future https:  .   \u2014   Melinda Gates (@melindagates) April 2, 2017, '"}, "time": 1742628367.308588}
