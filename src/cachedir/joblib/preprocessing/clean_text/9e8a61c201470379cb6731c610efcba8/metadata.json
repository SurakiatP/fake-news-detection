Many of the accusations are aimed specifically and recognizably at her husband, Shawn Carter, the rapper Jay Z. \u201cTonight I regret the night I put that ring on,\u201d she   in \u201cSorry,\u201d a twitchy, flippant song that\u2019s by no means an apology. It\u2019s a combative, unglossy track on an album full of them. \u201cLemonade\u201d is the kind of album that a star like Beyonc\u00e9 (as well as, lately, Rihanna) can release in the streaming era because she\u2019s already guaranteed attention for her every utterance. The album is not beholden to radio formats or presold by a single fans are likely to explore the whole album, streaming every track and hearing how far afield  \u2014   a brass band, stomping   ultraslow    \u2014   Beyonc\u00e9 is willing to go. As she did with her 2013 album, \u201cBeyonc\u00e9,\u201d she has also paired the music with   video that expands and deepens its impact. On their own, the songs can be taken as one star\u2019s personal, domestic dramas, waiting to be mined by the tabloids. But with the video, they testify to situations and emotions countless women endure. It\u2019s not a divorce announcement the singer, songwriter and director is credited as Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles Carter. Beyonc\u00e9 released \u201cLemonade\u201d online at 10 p. m. on April 23, immediately after the HBO showing of the hourlong \u201cvisual album\u201d version. It\u2019s a   music video that intersperses the songs, and broadens them, with compelling poetry from the   writer Warsan Shire, poems that often extend women\u2019s physicality toward the archetypal. As Beyonc\u00e9 recites them, Ms. Shire\u2019s words radically reframe the songs, so they are no longer one woman\u2019s struggles but tribulations shared through generations of mothers and daughters. The video is filled with images of female solidarity and of family, Southern and African roots, women of all ages and roles and eras. Often, Beyonc\u00e9 is joined by   women in white clothes enacting shared work, gatherings of women or eerie communal rituals. Beyonc\u00e9, in multiple hairstyles and fashions, is shown both alluring and unglamorous:   unhappy, sweaty, harshly lit. For the last few songs she often appears in a     dress remade with fabric patterns derived from African textiles, a rich twist. The album title comes from a family gathering that\u2019s shown in the video and heard on a track: the 90th birthday of Hattie White, Jay Z\u2019s grandmother, who says, \u201cI was served lemons but I made lemonade. \u201d \u201cLemonade\u201d is not necessarily the album listeners might have expected after \u201cFormation,\u201d the song Beyonc\u00e9 performed at the Super Bowl with dancers in Black   outfits and in a video clip using images of New Orleans, of   in a plantation mansion and of Beyonc\u00e9 atop a police car, sinking under a flood. It\u2019s the last song on \u201cLemonade,\u201d almost a postscript it\u2019s not in the extended video. One other song on \u201cLemonade\u201d mixes preaching and a prison song (both collected by John and Alan Lomax) a Kendrick Lamar rap and 1960s   psychedelia (sampling the collectors\u2019 item Puerto Rican band Kaleidoscope) to call for \u201cFreedom\u201d: \u201cI break chains all by  \u2019t let my freedom rot in hell,\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 vows. But most of \u201cLemonade\u201d arrives like a   to \u201cJealous\u201d on the 2013 \u201cBeyonc\u00e9,\u201d a song that moans, \u201cI hate you for your lies. \u201d \u201cJealous\u201d is offset on \u201cBeyonc\u00e9\u201d by songs about ecstatic lust, a topic largely absent on \u201cLemonade. \u201d In most of the new songs, Beyonc\u00e9 has been taken for granted or pushed aside. It\u2019s a situation that, she finds, is both \u201ca wicked way to treat the girl that loves you\u201d and also flabbergasting given that she is, after all, Beyonc\u00e9. Beyonc\u00e9!: \u201cThe baddest woman in the game,\u201d as she sings in \u201cHold Up. \u201d  : She is. Her reactions swing from sorrow to rage to determined loyalty, and she reaches beyond the   of \u201cBeyonc\u00e9\u201d to embrace new influences and collaborators: the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Father John Misty, Vampire Weekend\u2019s Ezra Koenig, Animal Collective and Led Zeppelin. \u201cDon\u2019t Hurt Yourself,\u201d a collaboration with Jack White, is a     that has Beyonc\u00e9 fighting back, declaring, \u201cYou ain\u2019t trying hard   ain\u2019t loving hard enough,\u201d working up to a scream. \u201cPray You Catch Me\u201d is one of two collaborations with the British songwriter James Blake:   ballads of suspicion and longing. During \u201cForward,\u201d the other Blake collaboration, the video has its most moving sequence: family members stoically holding photographs of men who were killed by police. It\u2019s followed by a scene of a New Orleans Mardi Gras Indian in full feathered and beaded costume, shaking a tambourine in posh dining rooms as if to exorcise them. Yet eventually, she makes peace with trying to hold on. \u201cLove Drought,\u201d with whispery vocals amid pillowy synthesizers, points out that \u201c10 times out of nine I know you\u2019re lying,\u201d but strives to reconnect. \u201cSandcastles,\u201d a slow piano hymn that eventually gathers a choir, recalls a   fight but turns a double negative into a positive: \u201cI know I promised that I couldn\u2019t stay,   promise don\u2019t work out that way. \u201d By the time Beyonc\u00e9 reaches \u201cAll Night,\u201d a gospelly ballad roughened with electric guitar, she resolves to \u201cGive you some time to prove I can trust you again. \u201d Will it work out? No one knows. But in the meantime she sings wholeheartedly, encapsulates deep dilemmas in terse singalong lines and touches on ideas and emotions that so many people feel. She is a star whose world is vastly different from that of her listeners. But in matters of the heart, with their complications and paradoxes, Beyonc\u00e9 joins all of us.'"}, "time": 1742561635.7437716}
