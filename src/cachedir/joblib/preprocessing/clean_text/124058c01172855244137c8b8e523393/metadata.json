It\u2019s cowardly. \u201d  Dershowitz said that he\u2019s always liked Comey, but Comey has been \u201cusing his friends to get his point out. It\u2019s cowardly. And I think it\u2019s about time that Comey is confronted directly with  . He was a great director of the FBI, but when the whole Hillary Clinton thing began, he cared more about his reputation and his dignity than about what was good for America. \u201d Dershowitz added, \u201cI\u2019d want to find out if he was the source of the leaks of the memo that he was quoted in. Second, I would ask him why he didn\u2019t talk directly, why he\u2019s using his friends. I would go back to his decisions to speak to the public. \u201d He continued that while he disagreed with President Trump\u2019s reported characterization of Comey as a \u201cnutjob,\u201d calling him a \u201cshowboat\u201d is \u201cnot a bad characterization. \u201d He further stated Comey\u2019s motives are \u201call about preserving his reputation above everything else. \u201d Dershowitz further argued that Comey revealed Clinton investigation because thought Clinton was going to win, and he would be faulted by Trump supporters for not revealing the investigation, and so Comey revealed the Clinton investigation to preserve his reputation. Dershowitz also stated that he believes Trump fired Comey due to Comey\u2019s statement that he felt sick over the prospect that he might have influenced the election. Dershowitz concluded that the Russia investigation should be handled by an independent commission, not a special counsel, \u201cbecause I don\u2019t see any crimes. Let\u2019s take the   scenario, let\u2019s assume that Trump \u2014  which it didn\u2019t happen \u2014  the Trump campaign got together with the Russians and said, let\u2019s make Trump president because he\u2019s better than Hillary Clinton. Terrible politically, what\u2019s the crime?   \u2026     Or he leaks material \u2014  he shouldn\u2019t have \u2014  to the Russians about the Israeli spy. Terrible, he shouldn\u2019t have done it.   \u2026     But there\u2019s no crime. \u201d Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742563524.0151947}
