The highlighted link in the email takes you to an article at National Journal with the intriguing title \u201cEmails May Be a Key to Addressing \u2018Pay-to-Play\u2019 Whispers at Clinton Foundation.\u201d The article is protected by a pay wall which prevents me from providing more information, but I can tell you the subhead: \u201cThere are not two Clinton controversies. There is one big, hairy deal.\u201d \\nHere is Podesta\u2019s response, sent a half-hour later: \\nEric Braverman, the name Podesta throws out as the likely mole, is a former CEO of the Clinton Foundation. \\nTrump campaign adviser Roger Stone has posted a tweet in reaction partly to this exchange in which he advances the claim that Braverman was working with WikiLeaks and now fears assassination by the Clinton machine: Word on the street is Eric Braverman, Clinton Foundation CEO, has fled the USA and is attempting to gain asylum in Russia. Anyone confirm? \\n\u2014 Stone Cold Truth (@StoneColdTruth) October 25, 2016 \\nHow ironic that Braverman, according to the scuttlebutt, is seeking asylum from Russia, of all nations!'"}, "time": 1742628568.9908524}
