The note, which threatened a black female student and used an ethnic slur, was concocted as part of an   attempt at political activism. \u201cThis was not a genuine threat,\u201d St. Olaf President David R. Anderson wrote on Wednesday to students. \u201cWe\u2019re confident that there is no ongoing threat from this incident to individuals or the community as a whole. \u201d The note, Anderson added, was a \u201cstrategy to draw attention to concerns about the campus climate. \u201d Student Samantha Wells, who reported the incident, claimed on social media that she was aware that the note was \u201cfabricated\u201d at the time that she submitted the report. \u201cSo, it looks like something made its way back to me in the investigation,\u201d Wells wrote. \u201cI will be saying it was a hoax.
