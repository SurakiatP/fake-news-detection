S. employees with full benefits to launch its   grocery markets, which are expected to offer drone delivery services. [Amazon. com (OTC: AMZN) currently has about 180, 000   employees in the United States and over 306, 000 full and   employees worldwide. That represents about a 33 percent increase over the 230, 800 at the end of 2015.  With 600 percent employment growth in the last 5 years, Amazon\u2019s employee base is now 3 times Microsoft\u2019s direct workforce and over 4 times Google parent Alphabet\u2019s 70, 000 employees. Unlike other tech companies that are automating away employment or replacing Americans with   foreigners, Amazon is accelerating hiring. Most of Amazon\u2019s U. S. growth has been at its 18 \u201cFulfilment by Amazon\u201d service centers. Although the centers open with   employees, Amazon\u2019s CFO Brian Olsavsky recently stated that due to expansion factors, the company is converting more temporary employees to   positions. The next big phase for Amazon\u2019s growth will be the   of 1, 800   \u201cAmazon Go\u201d grocery stores, which will feature clerkless shopping. The company opened its pilot store at one of Amazon\u2019s downtown Seattle headquarters buildings. Food options include fresh produce, frozen foods, packaged grocery and prepared food options. Only Amazon   \u201cblue badge\u201d staffers can enter right now, but ARS Technica reported that the      stores will be soon be open to Amazon Prime members who download a smartphone app. Through a combination of cameras and sensors powered by machine learning to track users\u2019 activity, Amazon Go users can   and their account will br billed as they walk out of the store. With a huge inventory of     apartments with vacant ground floor retail space dotting most major cities, Amazon Go will have no problem rolling out their concept nationally. In a move apparently timed to the public launch of Go, Amazon filed a Federal Communications Commission application for a Special Temporary Authority permit to use of an indoor and outdoor wireless communications system in Seattle and rural Washington. The application states: \u201cAmazon seeks FCC experimental authority to evaluate prototype equipment and associated software designed to support innovative communications capabilities and functionalities. \u201d It is signed by former NASA astronaut Neil Woodward, who manages of flight test and certification for Amazon Prime Air. Amazon\u2019s application also \u201cseeks to collect sufficient data within that time frame to assess the performance and reliability characteristics of prototype equipment and software to determine if additional research is needed and should be scheduled. \u201d Rumors in the tech world suggest the system will support Amazon Go drone deliveries. Amazon has already started making its first drone package deliveries in the UK, but Federal Aviation Administration regulations have limited the tech giant\u2019s ability to conduct tests in its home market. Amazon patents applications include a \u201ccollective UAV\u201d that would combine a flock of drones to pick up and deliver heavier items.'"}, "time": 1742564089.855639}
