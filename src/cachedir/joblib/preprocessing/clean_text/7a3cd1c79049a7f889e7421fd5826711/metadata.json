[Jes\u00fas Torrealba, the secretary general of Venezuela\u2019s Democratic Unity Roundtable (MUD) tweeted this week that colectivos stormed into Caracas\u2019s San Pedro Claver Church on January 23  . \u201cThe violent government supporters closed the door, prevented the parishioners from leaving, and forced them to listen to a political speech,\u201d Torrealba denounced on Twitter. \u201cThe violent colectivos offended the Venezuelan Episcopal Conference and social leaders in the area in their speech. \u201d  1) GRAVE: La Iglesia San Pedro Claver, Caracas, fue cercada y tomada hoy 29E a la 1pm por paramilitares oficialistas mal llamados colectivos,  \u2014   Jesus Chuo Torrealba (@ChuoTorrealba) January 29, 2017,  3) Los oficialistas violentos cerraron las puertas, impidieron la salida de los feligreses y los obligaron a escuchar un discurso pol\u00edtico,  \u2014   Jesus Chuo Torrealba (@ChuoTorrealba) January 29, 2017,  4) Los violentos mal llamados \u201ccolectivos\u201d ofendieron en su discurso a la Conferencia Episcopal Venezolana y a dirigentes sociales de la zona,  \u2014   Jesus Chuo Torrealba (@ChuoTorrealba) January 29, 2017,  Torrealba concluded, noting that the incident ended after Monsignor Jes\u00fas Gonz\u00e1lez de Z\u00e1rate, an official at the church, pleaded with the gangs to allow the Mass to continue. Following reports of the event, the head of the Venezuelan Episcopal Conference issued a statement condemning the increasingly common attacks on the part of supporters of the socialist government against the Catholic Church. \u201cThese are not isolated occurrences but rather, one gets the impression that these are premeditated events meant to intimidate the Catholic Church,\u201d Monsignor Diego Padr\u00f3n, the head of the conference, said in remarks on an   radio program. The Church, he added, is a target because it \u201chas taken a very clear position before the government, noting its difficulties, problems, and the crisis the nation is currently in. \u201d Padr\u00f3n also listed other events that made him believe these were not isolated incidents, including attacks on the homes of multiple clergy members who had openly objected to the socialist government. While the Vatican has not aided the Venezuelan opposition at its highest level  \u2014   Pope Francis notably met with dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, but not the wives of his political prisoners  \u2014   Venezuelan clergy have vocally opposed the growing infringement on human rights and dire economic situation Maduro\u2019s policies have created. The Episcopal Conference loudly protested Maduro\u2019s edict granting the military full control of the nation\u2019s food supply, objecting to the socialist government\u2019s \u201cconstant preaching of hate, criminalization and punishment of all dissidents. \u201d The Conference also attempted to facilitate talks between the MUD and the government, on Pope Francis\u2019s orders. After months of delays and a refusal by the government to release prisoners of conscience, the bishops sent the head of the government a private letter expressing \u201cpain and concern\u201d over \u201ca disturbing delay in the adoption of necessary measures for the concrete application of the agreements. \u201d The Socialist Party\u2019s    Diosdado Cabello responded by publicly calling the letter \u201cdisrespectful and irresponsible\u201d after it leaked to international outlets. The MUD ultimately backed out of the Vatican talks, objecting to the Maduro government\u2019s \u201carrogant and rude response  \u2026     to the demands formulated in a letter from the Vatican. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563269.136582}
