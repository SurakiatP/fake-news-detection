The programme, Just A Girl, depicts an 11-year-old\u2019s struggle to get hormones that stunt puberty, making it easier to have sex-change surgery in the future . \\nOne mother, writing on the Mumsnet website, said her daughter had become worried after seeing the video . She said her girl, who likes wearing boys\u2019 clothes and playing football, had \u2018asked me, anxiously, if that means she was a boy\u2019. \\nTory MP Peter Bone said: \u2018It beggars belief that the BBC is making this programme freely available to children as young as six. I entirely share the anger of parents who just want to let children be children. \\n\u2018It is completely inappropriate for such material to be on the CBBC website and I shall be writing to BBC bosses to demand they take it down as soon as possible.\u2019 \\nFormer Culture Secretary Maria Miller voiced her concerns over the BBC tackling the subject in \u2018an age-appropriate way\u2019, saying such issues should be raised \u2018where children can have support from parents\u2019. \\nAnd Tory MP Julian Brazier said: \u2018This programme is very disappointing and inappropriate. Children are very impressionable and this is going to confuse and worry them. \u2019 \\nFamily campaigner Norman Wells said: \u2018It is irresponsible of the BBC to introduce impressionable children as young as six to the idea that they can choose to be something other than their biological sex.\u2019 \\nJust A Girl is the fictional video diary of a child who calls herself \u2018Amy\u2019 and dresses as a girl. It is hosted on the CBBC website, aimed at children aged between six and 12 . \\nIn the half-hour programme, Amy \u2013 played by an actress \u2013 reveals she was born a boy called Ben but has already started using puberty-halting drugs. \\nSuch hypothalamic blockers provoked a furore two years ago when The Mail on Sunday revealed an NHS clinic was willing to give them to children as young as nine. \\nCritics cited research claiming that most teenagers confused about their gender never go through with surgery, with many realising they are gay. The BBC row comes amid growing controversy over gender issues, fuelled by a number of high-profile cases. \\nIn one, a Christian couple were threatened with having their 14-year-old daughter taken away because they oppose her plans to become a boy. In another, a seven-year-old boy was ordered to be removed from his mother\u2019s care as \u2018she was raising him as female\u2019, causing him \u2018a great deal of emotional harm\u2019. \\nIn Just A Girl, Amy says: \u2018When I was born, Mum said Dad was so pleased that he had a boy to take to the football. But Mum knew I was different. She realised early on that I was born in the wrong body.\u2019 \\nShe adds: \u2018My Mum supported me when I did a PowerPoint presentation to my class about transitioning and that I wasn\u2019t going to come to school in boys\u2019 clothes any more, but girls\u2019 clothes. I wasn\u2019t Ben, I was Amy.\u2019 \\nLater Amy is shown telling a friend, Josh \u2013 a boy who wants to be recognised as a girl \u2013 that she is on hormone blockers, saying it took \u2018ages\u2019 to get them after \u2018loads of tests and talks at the clinic\u2019. \u2018Once they realised I was trans for real, [I] got them,\u2019 she says. In another entry, Amy tells viewers she has developed a crush on a boy called Liam, but confides: \u2018Liam thinks I\u2019m just a girl, but I\u2019m not. I\u2019m trans. And what\u2019s he going to say if he finds out? Stop being my friend? Why? I\u2019m still me, aren\u2019t I?\u2019 \\nChild psychotherapist Dr. Dilys Daws said the programme could confuse children. She said that, while it was natural for youngsters to wonder what it would be like to be the opposite sex, the BBC was irresponsible to feature the \u2018extreme\u2019 step of gender change for six-year-olds because they were too young to grapple with such issues . \\nThe programme generated hundreds of comments on Mumsnet. One mother, who said her seven-year-old had watched the show, asked: \u2018Am I being unreasonable to think this is an inappropriate topic for a young age group?\u2019 \\nAnother replied: \u2018Don\u2019t think this is remotely suitable for a seven-year-old. To start suggesting that children can be transgender when they\u2019re far too young to actually have a gender is reckless and damaging. A small boy who is told that he can become a girl may take this as meaning that sex changes are possible, that sometime in the future he\u2019ll wake up with a girl\u2019s body.\u2019 \\nAnother user added: \u2018I don\u2019t think hormone therapy should be normalised any more than 12-year-olds drinking or doing recreational drugs should be normalised.\u2019 \\nOther critics slammed the BBC. Mr Wells, director of the Family Education Trust, said: \u2018The more we promote the idea that a boy can be born into a girl\u2019s body and a girl can be born into a boy\u2019s body, and that drugs and surgery can put things right, the more children will become utterly confused. Respecting and preserving a child\u2019s birth sex should be seen as a child protection issue. \u2019 \\nBut some parents on Mumsnet were more positive. One wrote: \u2018I don\u2019t believe there is \u201ctoo young\u201d for stuff like this. The earlier you teach your children that everyone is different and that nobody is \u201cnormal\u201d the better.\u2019 \\nDr .Polly Carmichael, a clinical psychologist specialising in transgender children, said: \u2018Raising awareness of these issues is the best way to challenge stigma and discrimination associated with identity issues. Programmes like Just A Girl can contribute to a healthy and informed public discussion. \u2019 \\nThe BBC said: \u2018Just A Girl is about a fictional transgender character trying to make sense of the world, deal with bullying and work out how to keep her friends, which are universal themes that many children relate to, and which has had a positive response from our audience. CBBC aims to reflect true life, providing content that mirrors the lives of as many UK children as possible. \u2019 \\nDCG'"}, "time": 1742562016.6018584}
