Goodson Jr. the only officer charged with murder in connection with the death and the driver of the police wagon in which Mr. Gray suffered the spinal injury that killed him. The combination of the two unsuccessful prosecutions and the murder charge has raised the stakes substantially in the trial of the third of six officers charged in the death of Mr. Gray, 25, a black man whose death spurred riots, looting and arson. \u201cThese are the most serious charges,\u201d said Warren S. Alperstein, a defense lawyer here who has represented police officers and has been closely following the cases but is not directly involved in them. \u201cThis is, arguably, the    case for the state. It would be a devastating blow if the state was unable to secure a conviction. \u201d The trial comes as prosecutors aim to shift the narrative away from the mistrial of one officer involved in the case and, just over two weeks ago, another one\u2019s acquittal on all charges. But legal experts say it will be exceedingly difficult for prosecutors to secure a conviction for murder. Some activists in Baltimore say their faith in the judicial process is already worn. \u201cThe average person doesn\u2019t really expect anything,\u201d said Dayvon Love, the director of public policy for Leaders of a Beautiful Struggle, an advocacy organization. \u201cThey expect the officers to get acquitted. They don\u2019t expect any accountability. \u201d In addition to the failed prosecutions, the trials have left lingering questions about how Mr. Gray ended up with a functionally severed spine, critics say. \u201cThe world wants to know what happened to Freddie Gray,\u201d said Darlene Cain, a nurse\u2019s assistant whose son was shot and killed by a Baltimore police officer in 2008, and who has urged greater accountability from officers who use force. \u201cHow did a young person, healthy, talking and standing at one moment, and then at the next time, he\u2019s not living?\u201d Officer Goodson, 47, a   Baltimore police veteran who, like Mr. Gray, is black, faces seven charges in total, including three charges of manslaughter, and a charge of   depraved heart murder  \u2014   a rare charge for a police officer, even as scrutiny of law enforcement grows. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a huge increase in trials for officers for any criminal offense, but I\u2019ve never seen a murder trial for an officer without video or eyewitness testimony,\u201d said Geoffrey P. Alpert, a professor of criminology at the University of South Carolina who has focused on the use of force by the police. He added, \u201cIt\u2019s been an uphill battle in the other two trials, and this is going to be the toughest. \u201d The case will be decided not by a jury, but by Judge Barry G. Williams, who acquitted another officer, Edward M. Nero, late last month. Judge Williams, once an attorney in the Department of Justice\u2019s Civil Rights Division, is also black, and he won accolades from members of the legal community  \u2014   including Billy Murphy, the lawyer for Mr. Gray\u2019s family  \u2014   for not bowing to public pressure in deciding Officer Nero\u2019s case. But he has been accused in some quarters of making a narrow ruling that did not reckon with the larger questions of the case. Officer Goodson\u2019s side of the story has never been officially told he is the only charged officer who did not give a statement to police investigators. Court filings have hinted that the prosecution may suggest Mr. Gray was taken for a   rough ride, with Officer Goodson intentionally driving the van in a dangerous fashion. They have indicated plans to call a witness who can discuss the practice. But legal observers say it is not yet clear what, if any, evidence they have to prove that is what happened on April 12, 2015, when Mr. Gray was arrested. \u201cThe open question with regard to the Goodson trial is, will we hear more about the practice of giving rough rides?\u201d said David Jaros, a professor of law at the University of Baltimore, who said that such a theory could explain why prosecutors chose to charge Officer Goodson with murder. \u201cAbsent a rough ride,\u201d Mr. Jaros said, \u201cit is much harder to understand the prosecution\u2019s decision to pursue that particular charge, which requires a wanton and reckless disregard for human life that is so significant that it is akin to intentional murder. \u201d What is known is that Officer Goodson responded to the arrest of Mr. Gray on a bright morning last April. Mr. Gray had fled, apparently unprompted, from police officers in the Sandtown neighborhood of West Baltimore. Mr. Gray was eventually placed  \u2014   in handcuffs and leg shackles but no seatbelt  \u2014   in Officer Goodson\u2019s transport wagon, which made several stops in the neighborhood before arriving at the Western District police station. There, Mr. Gray was found unresponsive. He died of a spinal injury a week later. Protests here grew so violent that Gov. Larry Hogan called in the National Guard. With armored trucks still rolling through the city, the state\u2019s top prosecutor, Marilyn J. Mosby, announced charges against six police officers  \u2014   three black, three white. Late last month, Officer Nero was acquitted on charges of   assault, reckless endangerment and two counts of misconduct connected to his role in Mr. Gray\u2019s arrest. And in December, a jury failed to reach a verdict in the case of Officer William G. Porter, who faced charges including manslaughter and reckless endangerment. Prosecutors eventually secured an unusual ruling from the state\u2019s highest court  \u2014   a procedure that caused delays in all of the trials  \u2014   to let Officer Porter testify against Officer Goodson while his own retrial is pending. \u201cOfficer Porter\u2019s testimony will be crucial,\u201d said Douglas Colbert, a professor of law at the University of Maryland, who has been supportive of the prosecution, adding, \u201cHe minimally suggested going to the hospital. \u201d Regardless of the role of a rough ride, the case may turn on what prosecutors can show about Officer Goodson\u2019s state of mind while he drove Mr. Gray through West Baltimore. They are expected to argue that he had custody of Mr. Gray, and was responsible to keep him safe by using the seatbelt and obtaining medical help when he needed it  \u2014   and knew he could be putting Mr. Gray in danger by not doing so. Defense lawyers are expected to paint Officer Goodson as a veteran with a clean record who acted in line with accepted departmental practice when he did not buckle Mr. Gray in. \u201cThere\u2019s an irony that the officer\u2019s best defense is really an indictment of how people are generally treated in the system,\u201d Mr. Jaros said.'"}, "time": 1742563266.9554656}
