It was a late weekday morning in a troubled, shrinking Rust Belt city that is fed up with being known as a troubled, shrinking Rust Belt city. The man Mr. Wasko was calling an idiot  \u2014   perhaps seriously, or playfully, or both  \u2014   was his friend Vincent Archangelo Strines. Mr. Wasko, 48, had seen Mr. Strines, 55, a beefy blond man with a pack of cigarillos in his breast pocket, sitting behind a folding table and selling raffle tickets to support his nonprofit addiction recovery organization. So Mr. Wasko had parked his big soda truck in the lot and hopped out. He was appalled to learn that his friend, normally a Democratic voter, was now supporting Donald J. Trump. He looked Mr. Strines in the eye. \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot,\u201d he declared. So began a particularly spirited variant of the big argument currently consuming Youngstown: Does Mr. Trump, a Manhattan billionaire, really deserve to be the voice of the beleaguered American working class? It is a question of almost existential importance in a city where the steel industry\u2019s demise was so dramatic that Bruce Springsteen wrote a bitter ballad about it. To many, Mr. Trump\u2019s blunt language and swaggering persona feel familiar and welcome, and ring true. Youngstown is the kind of   Midwestern stronghold where Mr. Trump\u2019s struggling campaign must make a strong showing, particularly among white voters, if he is to have any chance of winning the presidential election. Broaching the topic of Mr. Trump on a street corner or bar stool here  \u2014   and thus delving into matters of race, economics, immigration and the   matter of the city\u2019s disintegration  \u2014   can be a volatile business. \u201cIf you want to punch me in the face, do it,\u201d Mr. Strines dared Mr. Wasko casually, after about 15 minutes of debate that played out under a billboard for a nearby adult novelty store called Sassy Sensations and touched on all of those issues. Cars whooshed up and down Mahoning Avenue, past businesses shuttered or struggling, and past tired residential side streets now considered \u201cfood deserts\u201d since the grocery store, a Sparkle Market, closed down about four years ago. Youngstown, a city of about 65, 000 people, is about 60 percent smaller than it was in 1960. Decades ago, blacks, Irish, Italians and Eastern Europeans came to work among the great blast furnaces of the old mills. When those businesses closed between 1977 and 1982, tens of thousands lost their jobs. Youngstown, as Mr. Springsteen noted in his 1995 song of the same name, once produced the iron and steel to fight America\u2019s wars. It has also produced the boxing great Ray \u201cBoom Boom\u201d Mancini, a passion for high school football that rivals West Texas\u2019 a tradition of political corruption  \u2014   mostly the work of Democrats  \u2014   and a long history, recently somewhat diminished, of mafia control. It is the rare small city whose past is dotted with car bombings, mob hits and characters with names like Moosey, Fats, Big Ernie and Brier Hill Jimmy. Today there are still some metal industry and manufacturing jobs. There is a big General Motors plant north of town that produces the small Chevrolet Cruze sedan. There is a   prison that opened in 1998. There is a business incubator, focused on reimagining Youngstown as a hub for software and   printing. In addition, there are signs of recovery from the Great Recession: The unemployment rate, which peaked at nearly 17 percent in January 2010, stood at 7. 6 percent in June. There is also a widespread belief that Mr. Trump is right when he says that the United States must renegotiate the terms of its trade with the world. Mr. Strines said that he worked for years as a quality assurance superintendent in the aluminum business, making good money until health issues related to his drinking problem forced him to retire. In that time, he said, he saw many businesses go under because China could produce aluminum for a fraction of what it cost American companies. He is hoping Mr. Trump will institute more protective tariffs. \u201cI think he could bring the economy back,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a   kind of guy. \u201d Mr. Wasko huffed. He doubted that Mr. Trump would follow through on any of his promises. What about the border wall? Mr. Trump was never going to get Mexico to pay for that, he said. And anyhow, wasn\u2019t America great already? Mr. Strines said: \u201cYou think America is great? Come look for a job in Youngstown. \u2019\u2019 On a Monday earlier this month, Mr. Trump visited Youngstown State University, where he delivered a foreign policy address in which he promised a more forceful response to what he called \u201cradical Islamic terrorism. \u201d Among those in the   crowd was Donald J. Skowron, a retired police officer active in the local Republican Party. On his phone, Mr. Skowron showed off photos in which he stood beside the road with big signs, meant for Democrats, that read, \u201cCROSS OVER\u201d and \u201cVOTE TRUMP. \u201d He said 19 of 20 drivers responded with a  . \u201cThe last one,\u201d he said, extending his middle finger  \u2014   \u201cI get those. \u201d Wendy Aron, 58, emerged from the speech energized. She was once a supporter of President Obama but was dismayed by the weakness of the   recovery. Her housecleaning business in the Youngstown suburb of Boardman has shrunk, going from a dozen employees to a   operation: her and her daughter. Working people, she said, don\u2019t have the money to pay for maid service anymore. Many of her close friends remain Democrats. \u201cThey just put me down,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to even talk to them. \u201d Gayle Hite, an employee at a hospital, and her husband, Joseph, were not invited to the speech, but got as close to it as they could, waiting outside a campus building with her wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d  . She is a longtime Republican, but her husband, who usually votes Democrat, was planning to vote for Mr. Trump this year. They had watched Mr. Trump slog through a tough couple of weeks, taking criticism for, among other things, his feud with the family of a slain Muslim American soldier. But what some saw as gaffes were, to Mr. Hite, proof that Mr. Trump was a true change agent. \u201cHe\u2019s not bought or sold by anybody,\u201d said Mr. Hite, a retired corrections officer. \u201cHe can say what he wants. \u201d These days Mr. Hite, 64, receives a Social Security check, but he said he worried about the ways in which a volatile world might bankrupt the government. What would it cost to absorb Syrian refugees? And the immigrants coming across the Mexican border? The couple had watched \u201cConspiracy Theory,\u201d the cable television show hosted by the onetime professional wrestler and governor of Minnesota,  Jesse Ventura. They were worried about the Bilderberg conference, the yearly, secretive meeting of bankers and policy makers. \u201cIt shows we\u2019re not really running our country,\u201d Ms. Hite said. \u201cSometimes I don\u2019t believe our vote counts. \u201d In Mr. Springsteen\u2019s song \u201cYoungstown,\u201d the narrator, a   mill worker, wishes for a future not in heaven but in \u201cthe fiery furnaces of hell. \u201d The character was inspired, in part, by a real steelworker, Joe Marshall Jr. whom Mr. Springsteen had read about in a book. Today Mr. Marshall, a small, sturdy man, who turns 63 on Saturday, can be found in Columbus, living in a $500 apartment and drawing a full state pension. After the steel industry fell apart, he pursued a life in law enforcement. He is an ardent Trump supporter. \u201cHe says what the average person is afraid to say because it\u2019s politically incorrect,\u201d Mr. Marshall said about Mr. Trump. Mr. Marshall worked at the Mahoning County Sheriff\u2019s Office for 23 years, at the jail and on patrol  \u2014   a   seat, he said, to the city\u2019s dramatic decline. He watched as the professional classes emptied out, and as the city\u2019s complexion changed: Youngstown, 74 percent white in 1970, is now about evenly divided between blacks and whites. Drugs came in, he said. The murder rate soared. Young people were dropping out of school at 15 years of age, Mr. Marshall said, because they didn\u2019t see what kinds of work a degree would get them. \u201cWhere are they going to go, Taco Bell?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat\u2019s   jobs. \u201d Seven years ago, he moved away, taking a job as a corrections officer. Today, his political views are eclectic. The Democrats, he said, \u201cfailed Youngstown\u201d: During the steel days, they were the party of overbearing regulations, the ones who told management that they couldn\u2019t open a second blast furnace. \u201cThat\u2019s jobs they took away,\u201d he said. But Mr. Marshall also had harsh words for Gov. John R. Kasich, a Republican. During Mr. Kasich\u2019s tenure, he said, \u201cit\u2019s just been cuts and cuts and cuts and cuts\u201d to the benefits of state employees like him. \u201cHe tried to take away our collective bargaining rights,\u201d he said. On Facebook, Mr. Marshall\u2019s posts extol the beauty of   families, and the contributions of   to the country\u2019s culture. But he is wary of the big mosque in his neighborhood and suspects Muslims there of planning an attack. The Democrats, he said, seem indifferent to whites. \u201cBelieve me, as Jesus Christ is my lord and savior, I\u2019m not prejudiced or anything,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it seems if you\u2019re a minority, they help you out a lot more than if you\u2019re white. \u201d In Mr. Trump, Mr. Marshall sees echoes of the man who hired him to be a deputy, James A. Traficant Jr. the sheriff at the time. Mr. Traficant would later become a Democratic congressman and Northeast Ohio\u2019s most emblematic politician, until his expulsion from Congress in 2002 after a bribery conviction. (Mr. Traficant died in 2014 after a tractor fell on him.) \u201cHe was a good guy,\u201d Mr. Marshall said of Mr. Traficant, who had hired him personally. \u201cI remember he told me, \u2018You screw up, Marshall, I\u2019ll kill you. \u2019\u201d Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Traficant, who went by the nickname Jimbo, annoyed and defied members of both parties, dished out scathing personal insults, blasted Washington insiders and purported to speak for the average Joe. He proposed sending troops to secure the Mexican border and criticized free trade. He even sported a flamboyant and   hairdo, though it proved to be a toupee. Back in Youngstown, the fondness for Mr. Traficant lingers despite allegations that he was tied to the mob. \u201cWell, the whole city was like that,\u201d said Kathy Miller, the Trump campaign coordinator for Mahoning County. She said it was difficult to agree with everything Mr. Traficant did, just as it is with Mr. Trump. But she said that Mr. Traficant\u2019s constituent services were unparalleled. \u201cJimbo got it taken care of,\u201d she said. Out in the parking lot, Mr. Strines seconded the praise. \u201cHe just told it the way it was, and I think Trump is the same type of guy as Traficant,\u201d he said. Mr. Strines even asserted that Youngstown had been a better, safer place when the mob was in control. So it would be, he said, in Mr. Trump\u2019s America. Once upon a time, he said, everybody in Youngstown knew that if someone messed up and failed to follow certain rules, \u201cthat\u2019s where the mob would step in. \u201d \u201cThat\u2019s where Trump would step in,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce somebody\u2019s got fear, like Iraq will have, like China will have,\u201d he said, the world will grow calmer. \u201cAll of those illegal aliens better pack up their toothbrushes and start running. \u201d Mr. Wasko wasn\u2019t buying it: \u201cSo let\u2019s instill fear in everyone in America,\u201d he said sarcastically. \u201cNo,\u201d Mr. Strines said, \u201conly the bad ones, man. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562768.3846016}
