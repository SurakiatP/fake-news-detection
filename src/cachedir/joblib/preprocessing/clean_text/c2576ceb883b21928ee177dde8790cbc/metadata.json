Just a few weeks later, large swathes of the internet went down. Coincidence or trial run? \\n\\nSubmitted by Jeff Berwick : \\nWe\u2019ll get into that below. \\nBeforehand, however, there have been a number of new \u201cExecutive Orders\u201d straight from the e-pen of Barack O\u2019Bomber in the last few months of a \u201cvery strange\u201d variety. \\nOver the summer, a number of orders were given for succession plans in the case of multiple deaths in numerous US agencies. \\nAnd now, Obama just signed an executive order mandating preparations for a future \u201cextreme space weather event\u201d that has the ability to cripple or destroy the North American power grid and other major electrical infrastructure. \\nSigned on October 13th, the order states, \u201cSpace weather has the potential to simultaneously affect and disrupt health and safety across entire continents.\u201d \\nWhat is needed, we\u2019re informed, is an \u201call-of-nation\u201d endeavor, that includes the military space agency (NASA), the private sector, academia, and the insurance industry \u2013 among others. Presumably the federal government would \u201ccoordinate\u201d all this \u2013 i.e.: mandate it. \\nThere are some very strange things afoot! Why this? Why now? \\nWith each passing day it seems we\u2019re getting closer to a major event. Maybe it\u2019s one that causes a war or economic collapse. Perhaps it will be an \u201cEMP\u201d attack masquerading as a \u201cspace event.\u201d It\u2019s also possible a long term internet Denial of Service attack could be the cause of collapse. The bankers need a reason to blame for the collapse they\u2019ve engineered. \\nWe\u2019d be less suspicious of what\u2019s going on if the US wasn\u2019t well down the road toward a kind of neo-fascism. It\u2019s one with two kinds of justice (Hillary and the elites versus the rest of us), a state of deepening economic depression and heightened military confrontation with both Russia and China as part of endless serial warfare abroad \u2013 and increased repression and censorship at home. In fact, the amount of censorship of alternative media sources is running at an all-time high. Barely a day goes by where I don\u2019t see one source claiming its post/tweet/video have been removed. \\nObviously, the free flow of information doesn\u2019t fit into this \u201cbrave, new world\u201d and thus the US is jettisoning it. \\nNo coincidence, for instance, that the internet changed hands in the beginning of October when the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN, was handed over to the UN by the US\u2019s own Nobel Peace Prize winner, Barack O\u2019Bomber. \\nJust about a week ago, we witnessed a massive DDOS attack in the US. According to mainstream reports, it was done by \u201chackers\u201d and naturally Killary Clinton took the opportunity to place blame on Russia. These are the same Russians who she says are behind the Wikileaks emails \u2013 which incriminate her \u2013 and the same Russians who, she claims, are propping up Donald Trump. \\nBloomberg reported that the enormous (and underreported) attack was perpetrated via a Chinese security camera maker. In fact, officials at this Chinese firm admitted that its products, which contained malware, were used to launch the cyber-attack which blocked internet access for millions of users. They then highlighted the threat which they claim is posed by \u201cthe global proliferation of connected devices.\u201d \\nWas this all a coincidence or was it a premeditated attack to test the limits of \u201ccontrol\u201d over the internet? Is it possible that Chinese and US authorities are cooperating to probe internet weaknesses in order to further their \u2018net dominance. \\nCould NASA or the North Atlantic Terrorist Organization (NATO) potentially play a future role in staging an electromagnetic disturbance with the help of the Chinese or the US private sector? These are strange and violent times \u2026 \\nAs Franklin D. Roosevelt said, \u201cNothing happens in politics by accident, if it happens, it was planned that way\u201d. \\nAnd, as John Kerry stated, \u201cThis little thing called the internet is making it hard to govern.\u201d \\nThey appear to have their sights set on this little thing called the internet, in one way or another, to make sure these absurd conspiracy theorists and \u201ctruthers\u201d can\u2019t report on what is actually and factually, going on. \\nIt certainly seems like the US is preparing for something big \u2013 maybe a nationwide electro-magnetic catastrophe. One that many reports state would see the population cut by 90% in a matter of months in today\u2019s uber-connected and digitally dependent world. \\nLast year, we reported on the North American Aerospace Defense Command\u2019s plan to re-use the subterranean Cheyenne Mountain bunker in Colorado Springs. NORAD\u2019s Commander Admiral William E. Gortney, explained that the EMP hardened mountain base would serve as protection from future \u201celectromagnetic pulses\u201d. \\nApparently all this arose over concern for NORAD\u2019s supposed vulnerability to a potential North Korean nuclear missile attack. Cartoonish Kim Jong-un, or Lil\u2019 Kim, who couldn\u2019t blow up his own sock drawer if he tried, supposedly has an operational KN-08 nuclear armed missile capable of shutting down the entire North American electrical grid. \\nNow, combine these points with Vladimir Putin\u2019s promise that only Donald Trump can prevent a potential nuclear war between world superpowers. Then add in Russia\u2019s war drills and emergency preparations plus Germany moving its military equipment to the Eastern borders. It\u2019s beginning to look like Putin is aware of something \u201cbig\u201d on the horizon as well \u2013 just like Obama and the Pentagon. \\nFor the record, I don\u2019t enjoy doing these blogs. It seems every day I am warning of some cataclysmic event or nefarious plot. I don\u2019t want to do this. I\u2019d rather live on the beach in Mexico and write about cryptocurrencies or fantastic investment opportunities. \\nBut, I feel an obligation to report on these things. Because hardly anyone else seems to even mention it. \\nNobody seems to notice, nobody seems to care. \\n2017 Gold Pandas and 2017 Silver Pandas Are Now Available!
