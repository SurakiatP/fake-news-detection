Right now, he just wants a podium and a crowd to shout in the general direction of\u201d. \\nTrump took to several hastily assembled rallies as he bid to be as freely racist as possible, calling into question any and every non-white race or group of people he could think of. \\n\u201cGet me an atlas, let\u2019s see who\u2019s next,\u201d Trump said shortly after doing a 12 minute impression of a person from China while pinning back the skin around his eyes. \\n\u201cBelieve me, I will be president, but let me tell you if I\u2019m not, I\u2019m gonna get arrested so quickly if I carry this act on after election day, so ya gotta make the most of it folks, believe me,\u201d the tiny handed reality TV star explained. \\nIt is alleged that aides close to Trump have taken away his phone in recent days for fear he may use Twitter. It is also alleged that they have taken away his make up and fake tan amid fears Trump would attempt \u2018black face\u2019 in order to appeal to white supremacists in an actual attempt to reach out to African Americans voters.'"}, "time": 1742628430.815311}
