EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: As stupid as this seems on the surface, at this point, I am not taking anything for granted. Donald Trump voters across America need to be made aware of this, and even now be working against it. Remember that with the Clintons, it\u2019s never over. Ever. And as Christopher Stevens and Vince Foster will tell you, these people will stop at nothing. And please be forewarned, while this petition strategy is far-fetched, it is not impossible. The petition , launched on Wednesday after Donald Trump was elected President, calls for the Electoral College to \u201cignore their states\u2019 votes and cast their ballots for Secretary Clinton.\u201d Although Trump won over the 270 necessary electoral votes to secure the Presidency, Clinton narrowly earned the nation\u2019s popular vote . The Electoral College \u2013 which was first introduced in 1804 \u2013 is comprised of 538 electors. Each state\u2019s number of electors is decided by its number of members in Congress, which is dependent on the state\u2019s population. So, when American citizens cast their ballots, they aren\u2019t directly voting for president \u2013 they\u2019re voting for electors. This year, Trump took 279, to Clinton\u2019s 228. Petition circulates for Clinton presidency: Most states use a \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d system when it comes to electoral votes, although there is no Constitutional provision or federal law that requires electors to vote a certain way. Twenty-six states and Washington, D.C., do, however, \u201cbind\u201d their electors to vote for the promised candidate on Dec. 19 \u2013 in this case, Trump. In many cases, \u201cfaithless electors\u201d are forced to pay a fine if they vote against the popular choice. Understanding what a \u201cFaithless Elector\u201d is: \\nIn order for Hillary\u2019s supporters to be successful, they will need to sway a significant number of the Electoral College to become \u201cfaithless electors\u201d. This video will make it clear what exactly that is and how the process works. Maine and Nebraska follow a different method , called the congressional district method, which allots two electoral votes to the popular vote winner, and additional votes for each congressional district won by the candidates. Crying Hillary Voters Compilation: Faithless electors have not ever reversed the presidency. The Change.org petition, which was at over 500,000 signatures on Thursday afternoon, said that Clinton supporters would be happy to pay any fees accrued by those who choose to be faithless electors. \u201cMr. Trump is unfit to serve,\u201d the petition claimed. \u201cHis scapegoating of so many Americans, and his impulsivity, bullying, lying, admitted history of sexual assault, and utter lack of experience make him a danger to the Republic. Secretary Clinton WON THE POPULAR VOTE and should be President.\u201d source  '"}, "time": 1742628559.0553813}
