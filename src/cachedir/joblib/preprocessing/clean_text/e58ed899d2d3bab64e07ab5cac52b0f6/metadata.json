I certainly hope so! \\nThe performance of the major news outlets this election cycle has been something to behold. It\u2019s been the worst, most shallow undertaking I can remember. And I remember the treatment Goldwater got. \\nI wrote here on Lew\u2019s blog last week about the hysterical reaction Gloria Borger and others had to Trump\u2019s unwillingness to promise to respect the election results in advance. \\nThey acted like panicked teenage girls in a horror movie. \\nPat Buchanan explains the media\u2019s panic. \u201cThe establishment is terrified that it has lost the country,\u201d he says. \u201cThe country no longer believes in its leadership.\u201d \\nAbout time! \\nNow with the Comey development it won\u2019t be long before Dems start talking about a rigged system. \\nAnother moment of equal media idiocracy: When the Clintonistas blamed Russia for spilling DNC emails that showed its secret collaboration with Hillary and against Bernie Sanders. \\nTrump said \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing!\u201d \\nThe line wasn\u2019t well-delivered. But it was still funny. \\nEven so, the joke was lost on the usual suspects. I watched CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper\u2019s visage grow dark as he expressed grave concern that Trump was inviting the Russians to interfere in our election. \\nThe whole thing brings to mind an old vaudeville comedy routine with, let\u2019s say, Joe and Moe: Joe: I\u2019m offended by the media\u2019s alarmist reaction to Trump\u2019s email joke. Moe: Are you offended as a Trump supporter? Joe: No, I\u2019m offended as a person with a sense of humor! 11:09 am on October 29, 2016'"}, "time": 1742564196.0512087}
