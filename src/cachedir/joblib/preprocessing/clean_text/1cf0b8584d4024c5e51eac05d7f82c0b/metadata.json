October 20th I went to an event organized by the Center for Immigration Studies to hear Professor George Borjas present his new book, We Wanted Workers . Borjas explains the title in his Introduction: \\nReflecting on the European experience with the millions of guest workers [from the 1950s onwards], the Swiss playwright and novelist Max Frisch made perhaps the single most insightful observation about immigration when he quipped: \u201cWe wanted workers, but we got people instead.\u201d \\n(In a footnote, Borjas gives us the German original: \u201c Wir riefen Arbeitskr\u00e4fte, es kamen Menschen .\u201d) \\nBorjas is a lively and engaging speaker. I bought a copy of his book, and stood on line to have him sign it. When I got to him, he immediately recognized me from a chance encounter eight years ago, which I had completely forgotten. \\nThat was of course embarrassing, with a line of secondary emotions coming along behind the embarrassment: gratification (How nice that a bigfoot researcher, a Harvard professor, remembers me after so many years!); annoyance (If he can remember an obscure opinionator, why can\u2019t I remember a serious and important scholar, working in a field that I often write about?); to anxiety (Am I losing my marbles? He\u2019s only five years younger than me \u2026) \\nI recommend the book in any case; and I further recommend Borjas in person, if you get a chance to see him speak. I only regret that he is, to borrow Dr Johnson\u2019s self-description , \u201ca retired and uncourtly scholar,\u201d with no taste at all \u2014 with, in fact, I think, a strong dis -taste \u2014 for political contention. \\nBorjas lays out a solid, factual, quantitative basis for the kinds of arguments we make here, with gentlemanly good humor and scholarly rigor. I\u2019d love to see him make his case in argument with the open borders shills, on TV talking-head shows or the campaign trail \u2026 but that\u2019s not his choice. \\nAll strength to Prof Borjas anyway, and all success to his new book. \\nPermalink \\nTwo essays on race . This month produced two notable essays dealing with race. One was notable for dishonesty and incoherence; the other for its clarity and straightforward good sense. \\nThe dishonesty and incoherence was of course in defense of the No Such Thing As Race dogma, hereinunder NOSTAR. \\nNOSTAR is a key axiom in our state ideology. It is, however, so contrary to everyday experience, common sense, and elementary biology that media outlets feel obliged to publish stern affirmations of it from time to time, rather as state newspapers in communist countries used to publish long editorials, for use in study sessions by the Party faithful, affirming the infallibility of Marxist-Leninism. \\n(The outstanding exhibit here, according to sinologist Simon Leys , was an editorial in the Peking People\u2019s Daily at the time of the Lin Biao affair in 1971 , instructing readers that extreme leftism was a right-wing deviation.) \\nSo here was science journalist Faye Flam [ ] laying down the Party line at Bloomberg News, October 3rd. \\nRace is perhaps the worst idea ever to come out of science. [ Science\u2019s Biggest Blunder by Faye Flam; Bloomberg News , October 3rd 2016.] \\nReally? Worse than phlogiston ? Worse than spontaneous generation ? Worse than the luminiferous ether ? \\n\u201cWe never use the term \u2018race,\u2019\u201d said Harvard geneticist Swapan Mallick, an author on one of the papers revealing the latest DNA-based human story. \\nSo what term do Dr Mallick and his colleagues use when discussing l ocal common-ancestry variations within a species? If \u201crace\u201d was good enough for Darwin , why isn\u2019t it good enough for him? \\n\u201cWe\u2019re all part of the tapestry of humanity, and it\u2019s interesting to see how we got where we are.\u201d \\nIndeed we are, and indeed it is. It is equally true, though, that we are all part of the tapestry of the genus Homo , of the family Hominidae , of the order Primates , of the class Mammalia , of the the phylum Chordata , of the Animal Kingdom . All of that is pretty interesting, too. What\u2019s your point? ORDER IT NOW \\nOne of the world\u2019s most prominent American scientists of the mid-1800s, Samuel Morton, collected skulls from all over the world and attempted to demonstrate that those of European ancestry had the world\u2019s biggest heads and were, so he claimed, intellectually superior. \\nExcept that \u201cthere is no evidence that Morton believed this or was trying to prove it.\u201d [ Scientists Measure the Accuracy of a Racism Claim by Nicholas Wade; New York Times , June 13, 2011] \\nScientists subsequently realized that Morton was wrong \u2014 about whose heads were biggest and the connection between head size and intelligence. \\nLeaving aside the fact that Morton was not much interested in such a connection, brain size (which correlates with head size) does correlate with intelligence. [ Neuroanatomical Correlates of Intelligence by E. Luders, K.K. Narr, P.M. Thompson, and A.W. Toga; National Institutes of Health, 2009.] \\n[Geneticist Joseph] Graves sometimes quizzes his students by showing them an image of a man and asking them to guess where he comes from. It appears to show someone most Americans would identify as a black man, and Graves says people assume he\u2019s from Africa or an African American community in the U.S. But he\u2019s from the Solomon Islands, which are in the South Pacific. \\nAre there really people who don\u2019t know this sort of thing? Fifty years ago, in then-wellnigh-monoracial England, I attended classes at University College, London with a young man whose skin was black. He was from Burma. (I recall his name as Man Man Tin, although the internet records no trace of such a person. In those easy-going days, with no offense intended or taken \u2014 he was a cheerful and sociable fellow \u2014 we gave him the nickname Rin Tin Tin . That would have gotten us permanently rusticated nowadays.) \\nAnd so on. It gets wearisome refuting this mendacious gibberish. \\nHow refreshing, then, a few days later, to see that Jared Taylor had posted the talk he gave to September\u2019s press conference on the Alt Right . \\nGiven the loose nature of the movement [i.e. the Alt Right], there are people who consider themselves \u201cAlt Right\u201d but who disagree on one or more of these points \u2014 except one. The entire Alt Right is united in contempt for the idea that race is only a \u201csocial construct.\u201d This is an idea that is so wrong and stupid that only very intelligent people can convince themselves it is true. \\nRace is a biological fact. Does anyone think that the differences between Danes and Pygmies are a sociological illusion? \u2026 \\nThere are countless race differences in such things as skull structure, twinning rates, and susceptibility to disease. It is even possible to tell a person\u2019s race from the varieties of bacteria that live in his mouth! \\nHuman races have been evolving separately for perhaps as long as 100,000 years, and evolution has marked their temperaments and mental abilities just as it has their physical characteristics. [ What is the Alt Right? by Jared Taylor; American Renaissance , October 11 2016.] \\nAh, the sweet clear wine of truth! \\nPermalink \\nSlow day at the Pentagon . The other zone of our social life in which state ideologues demand that we pretend to believe preposterous things is of course sex \u2014 or, as we are now supposed to say, \u201cgender.\u201d \\nMost of the preposterous things they want us to pretend to believe are in aid of an assault on traditional concepts of manliness. It is therefore not surprising that a key target of the No Such Thing As Sex (NOSTAS) preposterentsia is the military. \\nA friend with military connections passed on to me a document recently published by the Department of Defense. Title: Transgender Service in the U.S. Military: An Implementation Handbook . \\nThe wretched thing has seventy-two pages . Sample, from pages 60-61: \\nScenario 11: Use of Shower Facilities \\nA transgender Service member has expressed privacy concerns regarding the open bay shower configuration. Similarly, several other non-transgender Service members have expressed discomfort when showering in these facilities with individuals who have different genitalia. \\nKey takeaway(s) \\nThis scenario illustrates the importance of open lines of communication between the Service member and the commander. It also depicts steps a commander may take to permit privacy, based on Service policy. \\nService member responsibilities If you have any concerns about privacy in an open bay shower setting, you should discuss this with your chain of command. Consider altering your shower hours. \\nCommander responsibilities \\nYou may employ reasonable accommodations when/if you have a Service member who voices concerns about privacy. This should be done with the intent of avoiding any stigmatizing impact to any Service member. If permitted by Service policies, some of these steps may include: Facility modifications, such as installing shower curtains and placing towel and clothing hooks inside individual shower stalls. In cases where accommodations are not practicable, you may authorize alternative measures to respect personal privacy, such as adjustments to timing of the use of shower or changing facilities Take proactive steps through the chain of command to ensure that expressions of discomfort don\u2019t escalate into harassment or hazing. Consult the SCCC for guidance on how to institute such measures. \\nI repeat, there are 72 pages of this. That\u2019s more than half as many pages as the Seaman\u2019s Pocket Book from which I learned all the essentials of service as a rating in the Royal Navy . \\nOh, and if you\u2019re wondering what an SCCC is, it\u2019s a Service Central Coordination Cell: basically an email address to which you can send queries about policy in your service. \\nThe SCCC e-address for the Army is . If you want to send frivolous or spoof questions to the Army, use that address. Don\u2019t worry that you may be wasting their time; to judge by that 72-page handbook they\u2019ve just put out on servicepersons confused about their sex, time is a thing they have plenty of in today\u2019s military. \\nAntarius, The Planet With 12 Sexes . On a related theme (I guess), Greg Cochran mused on how things might be if there were more than two human sexes. ORDER IT NOW \\nMany species have several different kinds of males (a few have different kinds of females as well). For example, a lizard species in California has three different kinds of males \u2014 aggressive orange-throated guys that successfully dominate blue males, sneaky yellow guys that get past orange males guarding a big territory, and blue mate-guarding males (that are also cooperative \u2014 possibly a green-beard gene) that successful guard females from sneaky yellows. The population frequencies oscillate: scissors, paper, rock. [ The Third Sex by Greg Cochran; West Hunter blog, October 26th 2016.] \\nI\u2019m sorry to say that what this brought to my mind was one of Ed Subitzky\u2019s cartoons from the glory days of National Lampoon forty years ago. Title: \u201c Saturday night on Antarius (The planet with 12 different sexes ) .\u201d \\nI think I\u2019ll send that link to the SCCCs for all the different services. You never know; we may find ourselves at war with Antarius one of these days. \\nPermalink \\nDoes he bill his patients via the web? Just one more on the (approximately) medical beat. \\nMy better half works in Medical Billing, arguing over the phone all day long with doctors, hospitals, patients, and insurance companies. \\nThe other day she reported having dealt with a radiologist named Kwak \u2014 Dr Kwak. My lady is unfailingly truthful, so I did not doubt her story, but I was curious to see that Dr Kwak looks like, so I Googled him. \\nSure enough, there he is: No Bong Kwak, MD \u2014 Specialty : Diagnostic Radiology. No picture, though. Googling further, I find that Kwak is a not-uncommon Korean family name. \\nI am sure that the Kwaks are a proud and noble lineage, and that Dr Kwak discharges his radiological duties at the highest standards of professionalism. And yes, I know it\u2019s childish to make fun of people\u2019s names, which after all they can\u2019t help. For all I know to the contrary, \u201cDerbyshire\u201d sounds screamingly funny to Korean ears. If so, I do not begrudge them their mirth. Still \u2026 Dr Kwak? \\nAnd while we are at the intersection of October with names Korean, let\u2019s pause in respectful silence for a moment to remember the South Korean Secretary of State murdered by the Norks in the Rangoon bombing of October 1983 : Lee Bum Suk. \\nPermalink \\nGalaxies like grains of sand . For the longest time I carried around in my head the easy thumbnail tally of the cosmos: there are a hundred billion stars in our galaxy and a hundred billion galaxies in the observable universe. \\nThat second hundred billion crept up to two hundred billion when I wasn\u2019t looking; and now suddenly it\u2019s increased tenfold. \\nThe scale of the universe, already unfathomable, just became even more so: There are about 10 times as many galaxies as previously thought. \\nThe new number, two trillion galaxies, is the result of work led by Christopher J. Conselice, an astrophysicist at the University of Nottingham in England, published last week in The Astrophysical Journal . [ Two Trillion Galaxies, at the Very Least by Henry Fountain; New York Times , October 17th 2016.] \\nThat\u2019s just the observable universe, mind: the one little bubble of objects whose emitted light has reached us since the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago. The whole shebang is much bigger. It may in fact be infinite: There is an argument for this in Chapter Five of Max Tegmark\u2019s Our Mathematical Universe . \\nThere\u2019s a downside and an upside to knowing stuff like this. \\nThe downside is of course that it further dethrones us. It is only within living memory that we have known there are any other galaxies besides our own, let alone two trillion of the suckers. Not very long before that \u2014 a mere handful of generations \u2014 our little ball of rock was assumed to be the principal place in the cosmos, and its affairs the primary interest of the Creator. \\nThe upside is that our consciousness, our civilization, our accomplishments seem all the more astonishing as it becomes more and more probable that there are no others like them anywhere, or at least anywhere within several billion trillion miles. \\nThe arguments for this cosmic exceptionalism go back at least as far as Michael Hart\u2019s 1975 paper An Explanation for the Absence of Extraterrestrials on Earth . Tegmark recycles them briefly in the last chapter of his book. (He is out at the most skeptical end of the spectrum for belief in extraterrestrial intelligence: \u201cI\u2019ve just argued that we\u2019re probably the most intelligent life-form in our entire universe.\u201d) British science journalist John Gribbin wrote an entire book arguing the skeptical case. \\nSo we are utterly insignificant, but at the same time fantastically unique. There\u2019s something to meditate on, a hundred years on from Einstein\u2019s General Theory of Relativity , which opened the way to serious, informed speculation about these tremendous matters. \\nPermalink \\nWarm happy glow of the month . Home maintenance chore this month has been spackling. I hate spackling. \\nThis is to do with my property\u2019s standalone garage. The garage has a loft. For our first 24 years in this house, we paid no attention to the garage loft. It was a dark, filthy place, clogged with junk from previous homeowners going back to the 1940s. \\nIt didn\u2019t even have a floor , only some random planks thrown across the joists. Nor was there any ceiling. If you went up there \u2014 there was a crude, rotting wooden access ladder from below \u2014 you risked having your scalp ripped open by roofers\u2019 nails. It seems to be a cardinal rule of roofing to use nails two inches longer than necessary when fixing the roof tiles in place. ORDER IT NOW \\nAs the main house silted up with accumulated stuff , though, I began looking for extra storage space. And there it was: a nice unused space, twenty feet square, crammed with the junk of strangers long since passed on to their celestial rewards. \\nI cleaned it out. I installed a proper pull-down access ladder . I laid a proper floor. I hauled up tremendous 8\u2019\u00d74\u2032 panels of drywall and screwed them to the roof beams. I put in windows at each end. \\nThen, to seal up the seams between panels and hide the screw holes, you have to spackle that drywall . \\nIt\u2019s a tiresome business. You can learn the essentials from YouTube; but the instructors all disagree with each other. This one says to use fiber tape on the joints; that one says no, fiber tape is for pros, stick with paper tape. This one wets the paper tape, this one doesn\u2019t. This one says to spread the joint compound like this ; that one says to spread it like that ; a third one says to spread it like that but with a turn of the wrist thus . This one uses a special trowel for inside corners; that one says no, just do one wall, let it dry, then do the other. I was getting flashbacks to my time in Ed School amid those endless tiresome arguments about the best way to teach math. \\nI made all the mistakes amateurs make: used too much mud and ended up sanding three quarters of it off, etc., etc. Still, when I\u2019d finished it didn\u2019t look bad. \\nI called in my neighbor Charlie to do site inspection. Charlie worked for years in construction. He is a scrupulously truthful man (and a Trump supporter!) After looking over my spackling he declared it \u201cNot bad.\u201d \\nNot bad! That was my warm happy glow of the month right there. Bob Dylan is welcome to his Nobel Prize : I\u2019ll take \u201cNot bad\u201d from Charlie. \\nPermalink \\nQuote of the month . \\nFreedom of speech and thought, such as we still more or less have, are very delicate and easily smashed. \\nWatching our current elite\u2019s treatment of liberty is like watching a baboon carrying a priceless Ming vase across a stone-paved floor. [ Trust judges? I\u2019d rather ask a baboon to carry a Ming vase by Peter Hitchens; MailOnline , October 29th 2016.] \\nPermalink \\nThe Americans . The Mrs and I have been binge-watching the TV series The Americans , recommended by a friend. \\nThe premise of the show is that in the late Cold War years of the 1980s, the U.S.S.R. had agents deep embedded in American life, living as ordinary suburban American couples with kids, but on call to carry out espionage missions. Its psychological appeal is to the fantasy we all nurse, from early childhood onward, of living a secret life of excitement and danger while keeping up an outward mask of humdrum social normality. \\nThe plotting and characterization is very good, with a narrative \u201cpull\u201d that keeps you wanting to rent the next clutch of episodes. The storylines teeter on the edge of absurdity without ever quite falling over into the void. \\nUnfortunately I find that I am now in love with Annet Mahendru . When I confessed this to Mrs Derbyshire, she counter-confessed that she is in love with Noah Emmerich . The balance of domestic affections thus remains undisturbed, and we continue to watch The Americans with guiltless pleasure. \\nPermalink \\nMath Corner . The number three doesn\u2019t get the respect it deserves, in my opinion. \\nTwo is all over. We inhabit a universe of pairs: positive and negative, up and down, male and female, liberal and conservative, \u2026 there\u2019s no end to the twos. \\nThree has less of a public profile. Threeness doesn\u2019t have the deep, fundamental quality of twoness. \\nNot that three is altogether neglected. The Christian god is tripartite; heroes in fairy-tales are granted three wishes; and no-one thinks ill of underwear manufacturers marketing their products as small, medium, and large. \\nPatriots of many nations celebrate the fact of their flag having three colors. The French actually name their flag for this feature, which keys to the three ideals of the Revolution: liberty, fraternity, equity. English children used to be taught to sing : \u201cRed, white, and blue / What does it mean to you / \u2026,\u201d although I suppose this would be considered a racist outrage nowadays. I see an opportunity for arbitrage here #TeachEcon pic.twitter.com/lyuzQKFHZz \\n\u2014 Jadrian Wooten (@Wootenomics) October 28, 2016 \\nIn math, one of the most striking objects in elementary Measure Theory (dealing with the lengths, areas, volumes, etc. of mathematical figures) is Cantor \u2018s set, which has uncountably many points in it (i.e. too many to match off one-one with the counting numbers 1, 2, 3, \u2026) yet has measure zero. Cantor\u2019s set is arrived at by repeated division of a line segment into three parts; it is best grasped via ternary (base 3) notation . ORDER IT NOW \\nThere is a dark, negative side to threeness, though. Three is often used to slight and marginalize: third-rate, three\u2019s a crowd, third arm inspection (ask one of the older generation of military veterans), etc. The word \u201ctriage\u201d has positively sinister connotations. The Hound of Hell had three heads. \\nThis dark aspect was explored at length in Chapter Four of Paul Fussell\u2019s fine book The Great War and Modern Memory . Fussell fills seven pages exploring the role played by threeness in the WW1 combat experience as filtered by the human imagination. \\nFor the poet Charles Sorley the transformation of man into corpse is a three-part action. First, man; then, when hit, animal, writhing and thrashing in articulate agony or making horrible snoring noises; then a \u201cthing.\u201d \\nThe under-appreciation of three is best seen in the realm of fractions. It is possible to find a ruler marked off in thirds of an inch \u2014 I own one \u2014 but halves and quarters are far more popular. We say \u201ca quarter of an hour\u201d all the time; when did you last hear someone say \u201ca third of an hour\u201d? \\nIs there a VDARE.com-relevant angle to any of this? Of course there is! \\nLooking at the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s Population Clock the other day, I found myself wondering when the population of our republic will reach a third of a billion. It\u2019s almost there. That day, October 6th, around noon, the clock showed 324,647,530. The rate of increase \u2014 births minus deaths plus net immigration \u2014 was shown as one person every twelve seconds. \\nWith 8,685,803 to go until we reach the magic number of 333,333,333, and assuming linear extrapolation, we get to a third of a billion sometime in the late evening of January 25th, 2020 (assuming I have done my arithmetic correctly, which should by no means be relied on). \\nWill there be national celebration? A public holiday? Street parties? I doubt it. Thirdness gets even less respect than threeness. \\nJohn Derbyshire [ ] writes an incredible amount on all sorts of subjects for all kinds of outlets.
