Trump, who last week secured the delegates needed to clinch the Republican presidential nomination, continues to struggle in his effort to unite the party behind his candidacy. The list of those who have sent regrets includes governors and United States senators  \u2014   almost all facing tough   fights this year  \u2014   and lifelong party devotees who have attended every convention for decades. Some are renouncing their seats like conscientious objectors. \u201cI could not in good conscience attend a coronation and celebration of Donald Trump,\u201d wrote one Indiana delegate, Josh Claybourn, in a blog post resigning his position. The coolness toward Mr. Trump amounts to a remarkable rebuke. A broad range of party leaders are openly rejecting the man who will be their nominee. And the July   convention, usually a moment of public catharsis for political parties after contentious primaries, is shaping up to be another reminder of the disarray and disunity that is still rocking the Republican Party after a bitter   fight for the nomination. Even the two   Republicans in the convention\u2019s host state of Ohio  \u2014   Gov. John Kasich and Senator Rob Portman, who is fighting to hold onto his seat  \u2014   say they do not know if they will set foot in the convention hall. Mr. Kasich, who only four weeks ago quit the presidential campaign  and has not endorsed Mr. Trump, has no idea \u201cwhat role if any he will have,\u201d a spokesman said. He will be in Cleveland that week but has no plans, as of now, to partake in any official convention activities. Several other of Mr. Trump\u2019s former rivals for the nomination have said they will not attend or have not committed. Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida, will not be there. Neither will Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. \u201cI\u2019m sure it will be fun, I\u2019m sure it will be entertaining,\u201d Mr. Graham said last week. \u201cAnd I can watch it on TV. \u201d Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who is a delegate as well as a former presidential candidate, has yet to decide. \u201cT. B. D. ,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cThe schedule is still being firmed up. \u201d At least two former competitors of Mr. Trump\u2019s are expected to attend: Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who last week offered his services as a speaker should they be wanted. Among those staying away include some major corporations like   Microsoft and  . And some who do plan to be there might find the atmosphere somewhat uncomfortable. Mr. Trump has still not fully reconciled with Speaker Paul D. Ryan, the convention\u2019s chairman, who said in early May that he was not ready to support the nominee and would relinquish the role if asked. Mr. Trump is also at odds with the head of the Republican Governors Association, Susana Martinez of New Mexico, who will lead her state\u2019s delegation in Cleveland. Ms. Martinez has also withheld her endorsement, a slight that evidently prompted Mr. Trump to attack her performance in office last week. Scheduling conflicts seem to be a surprisingly common excuse for missing an event that was announced a year and a half ago. Others offered mushy noncommitments. \u201cJust as they\u2019re firming up the schedule, it kind of looks like there\u2019s a lot of stuff for me to do,\u201d said Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, explaining why he probably couldn\u2019t make it. Asked if Mr. Trump had anything to do with his reluctance, Mr. Johnson, who is in a heated   campaign, broke into a big smile and said, \u201cOh, of course not. \u201d Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan, a state Mr. Trump has said he believes the Republicans can wrest from Democrats this year, also might have more important things to do at home. \u201cMichigan has some pressing challenges right now,\u201d a spokeswoman said last week, \u201cand state issues are his foremost priority. \u201d Mr. Snyder is one of at least nine Republican governors who are noncommittal or skipping the convention: Mr. Kasich, Brian Sandoval of Nevada, Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, Bruce Rauner of Illinois, Larry Hogan of Maryland, Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina, Matt Mead of Wyoming and Nathan Deal of Georgia. \u201cI don\u2019t even want to be involved,\u201d Mr. Hogan said in an interview in March. \u201cIt\u2019s a mess. I hate the whole thing. \u201d Just about every Republican senator in a difficult race is staying away, fearful of what the association with Mr. Trump might do to reputations back home. Senator John McCain of Arizona will join four of the five living former Republican nominees in skipping the convention. \u201cI\u2019m in a very tough   campaign,\u201d he said last week, explaining his expected absence. Senators Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Mark S. Kirk of Illinois, two of the most endangered Republican incumbents, will also be nowhere near Cleveland that week. Mr. Portman, another senator in a tight race, said his time would be better spent holding a miniconvention of his own in Cleveland, which he plans to do with events for veterans, the homeless and his volunteers. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken at every convention since 1996,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody listens, nobody covers it. \u201d This mass avoidance might seem, on its surface, to be yet another example of party elites snubbing Mr. Trump in the kind of rejection that he would welcome as a professed political outsider. But it also reflects a deeper and more dangerous problem for him: Mr. Trump\u2019s popularity with Republicans remains uncomfortably low. The candidate\u2019s own party generally delivers support in the 90 percent range. (Mitt Romney won 93 percent of his own party in 2012.) Mr. Trump\u2019s support among Republicans, according to the latest NBC   Street Journal Poll, was 86 percent. And the snubs keep coming from the upper echelons of the party and the rank and file. In New Hampshire, the former senator Judd Gregg was initially a delegate for Mr. Bush. But when Mr. Bush suspended his campaign, Mr. Gregg became unbound. He has instead opted to skip the convention, telling a local television station, \u201cDon\u2019t like large crowds. \u201d The Indiana delegate who renounced his place at the convention, Mr. Claybourn, would have been bound to vote for Mr. Trump on the first ballot, a step he said he simply could not stomach. \u201cDonald J. Trump is the Republican Party\u2019s nominee,\u201d Mr. Claybourn said. \u201cBut he will not be my nominee, and I will not attend a convention celebrating his candidacy. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561641.396156}
