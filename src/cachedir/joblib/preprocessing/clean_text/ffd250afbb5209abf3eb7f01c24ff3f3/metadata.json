Unfortunately for his family, it looks like bad news for the star\u2019s estate as a woman leaked the $900,000 sex secret he had kept quiet for a whopping 30 years \u2013 and she has proof. \\nMost people are aware of Jackson\u2019s depraved past involving children \u2013 specifically, little boys. However, the most recent person to come forward is actually a woman, who states that the deceased star had molested and sexually assaulted her about 3 decades prior. \\nAccording to LA Times , \u201cThe alleged abuse started in 1986 and occurred in such iconic locations as Neverland Ranch, the set of \u2018Moonwalker,\u2019 Jackson\u2019s Encino mansion, and in the back of the singer\u2019s limousine, according to papers filed Tuesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court.\u201d Unfortunately for the family and Jackson\u2019s estate, her word isn\u2019t all the accuser was armed with . Stock image of Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cNeverland\u201d ranch \\nAmong the court filings are scanned copies of checks purportedly paid to her from Jackson or his entertainment companies, which she says were issued to pay her off in exchange for her silence. In all, the checks totaled a whopping $900,000 \u2013 a damning number to say the least. \\nFurthermore, the largest sum, a check for $600,000, was dated in late 1993, which just so happens to be three months after Jackson found himself in yet another lawsuit, that time with a 13-year-old boy saying he had been molested by the King of Pop. Of course, the payment comes at a time where Jackson would have wanted to ensure that all of his other skeletons remained perfectly quiet in his closet. \\nOddly enough, this is the only time a female victim has come forward to allege a Jackson sexual assault. In addition to that, the woman\u2019s lawyer, Vince Finaldi, said the case offers the first evidence that Jackson and his production company \u2014 not an insurance carrier \u2014 made direct payments to an alleged abuse victim. Michael Jackson (Source: LA Times ) \\nThe abuse allegedly lasted for over 3 years, beginning when the girl was merely 12 years old and ending just after her 15 th birthday. LA Times adds: \\nThe woman alleges that for about three years, Jackson fondled her, forced her to orally copulate him, and attempted to have sexual intercourse with her, which caused her to bleed, the lawsuit states. \\nJackson also supplied her with gifts and letters, and two of the notes were attached to the lawsuit. One of the letters ends, \u201cI\u2019m crazy about you. \u2026 All my love, Michael.\u201d \\nOf course, the Jackson family lawyer is saying that the entire ordeal is a made-up claim meant to do nothing more than leech off of the star\u2019s estate. As the woman \u2013 being a sex assault victim \u2013 and her identity are being kept quiet for the time being, it\u2019s hard to say whether she\u2019s looking for a payout or something more. \\nAlthough this man is dead and buried, and under most circumstances should be left to rest in peace, no sex assault victim should ever go without justice. Although money is a good way to buy silence, it certainly does not equate to anything near justice. In fact, it represents the exact opposite as it proves that if you have enough money, you can get away with anything \u2013 even sexually abusing a child. This woman deserves her day in court, and it certainly doesn\u2019t look like the Jackson family is going to like the end result.'"}, "time": 1742561668.7525475}
