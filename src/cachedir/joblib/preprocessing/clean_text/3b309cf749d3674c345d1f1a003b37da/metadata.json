If you saw her resume which is a resume of accomplishing nothing and running from the police three-quarters of her life. She is always either indicted or almost indicted or about to be indicted. Her whole life spent fleeing from the Justice Departments of different countries.

Would you expect to come back and find anything still there?\\nAaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.
