[\u201cI\u2019m not a believer in walls,\u201d Damon said in a recent interview with People to promote his upcoming movie, The Great Wall, a     film that presents an alternate history of The Great Wall of China as providing protection from   creatures and other monsters.  \u201cI believe that history belongs to the cooperators and nor am I of a mind that Mexico is going to pay for our infrastructure anymore than we\u2019re going to pay for their highways, you know what I mean?\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s just not going to happen but, that\u2019s where we are and we\u2019ll see how it all plays out. \u201d Building a border wall and making Mexico pay for it was one of Trump\u2019s first campaign promises. The president took to Twitter on January 26 and said if Mexico refuses to pay for the wall then \u201cit would be better to cancel an upcoming meeting\u201d with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. Damon says he hopes the people of Mexico know that most Americans don\u2019t support building a security wall on the U. S.  border. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to watch, but hopefully the people of Mexico understand that the people of our country, the majority of them don\u2019t believe that we should be putting any walls up. \u201d However, most Americans support Trump\u2019s plan to build a border wall, according to a recent Rasmussen poll. The Great Wall opens in theaters February 17.   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson'"}, "time": 1742562650.974997}
