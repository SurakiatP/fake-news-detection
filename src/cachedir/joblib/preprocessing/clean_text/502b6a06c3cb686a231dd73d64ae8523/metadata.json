Recipient Name Recipient Email => \\nDonald Trump has long campaigned on the promise of running the country the way he\u2019s run his businesses. On that basis, we essentially already know what it would mean if he entered the Oval Office and applied his personal business acumen to this nation (and the rest of the world). There\u2019s a surprisingly full record to cite. Who can forget, for instance, what happened to his signature gambling resorts in Atlantic City? Who can forget their serial failures in what was still relatively good times in that city, including the repeated trips to bankruptcy court and the way he stiffed local contractors and suppliers, running them out of business? As Russ Buettner and Charles Bagli of the New York Times summed it up : \u201cHe put up little of his own money, shifted personal debts to the casinos and collected millions of dollars in salary, bonuses, and other payments. The burden of his failures fell on investors and others who had bet on his business acumen.\u201d \\nIn his pre-political years, he perfected what Kurt Eichenwald of Newsweek dubbed \u201cthe art of the bad deal\u201d: \u201clost contracts, bankruptcies, defaults, deceptions, and indifference to investors.\u201d And from every bad deal for those who supported him, he\u2019s almost always walked away better off. All in all, it\u2019s quite a record (and don\u2019t even mention Trumped Up University ). There is no reason to believe that this pattern of behavior would change in the White House. After all, The Donald\u2019s record shows a remarkable consistency, so it\u2019s possible to imagine with a fair degree of accuracy what you\u2019re going to get. \\nTake election night 2012 when The Donald was still a Mitt Romney supporter. CNN recently reported on his tweets that night and judging by his comment on the Chinese invention of climate change, his complaints about polling violations, his outburst about \u201csham\u201d elections, and in the wake of Romney\u2019s loss his call for \u201crevolution,\u201d there hasn\u2019t been much truly new under the Trumpian sun in 2016 \u2014 not even his last tweet of that night four years ago: \u201cWe have to make America great again!\u201d In other words, his record should be considered remarkably predictive. So count on this: from the Oval Office, he\u2019ll walk away a richer man, leaving the rest of us holding the bag, and his supporters, particularly white working class men, in a striking version of hell. \\nThen, of course, there\u2019s the other candidate. You know who \u2014 the woman who never saw a bank CEO she couldn\u2019t get a couple of hundred thousand dollars from for giving thoroughly unsurprising speeches. Today, TomDispatch regular Nomi Prins, author of All the Presidents\u2019 Bankers , explores what our world might be like if The Donald goes down in flames and Hillary Clinton enters the White House next January. Consider this, economically speaking, the definition of a hold-onto-your-hats election, no matter who wins.
