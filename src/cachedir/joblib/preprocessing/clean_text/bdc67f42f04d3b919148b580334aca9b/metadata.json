K. Independence Party leader in Britain who is credited with leading the Brexit movement months ago. \u201cYou can go out, you can beat the pollsters, you can beat the commentators, you can beat Washington, and you\u2019ll do it by doing what we did for Brexit in Britain. \u201d In a campaign that has staked its reputation on \u201cAmerica First,\u201d the presence of a foreign politician was as unexpected as a Republican presidential candidate campaigning in a deeply conservative state with 11 weeks left in the election, yet Mr. Farage delivered a rousing speech in support of Donald J. Trump, keeping in line with the candidate\u2019s populist message and offering supporters a vision and an example that they can win. He repeatedly referred to how the Brexit vote represented an upstart victory for the \u201clittle people,\u201d how his political effort turned out \u201cpeople who have never voted in their lives\u201d and how \u201canything is possible if enough decent people are prepared to stand up to the establishment. \u201d His remarks offered a salve of optimism as Mr. Trump finds himself behind in many national and swing state polls. Mr. Farage pointed out that the Brexit vote had \u201cbeat the pollsters\u201d and that it could be done again. For Mr. Trump, who stood just to the side of the lectern as Mr. Farage spoke, repeatedly nodding, smiling and applauding, the Brexit vote presented a parallel for his campaign. \u201cI was very supportive of their right to do it and take control of their own future like exactly what we\u2019re going to be voting for on Nov. 8,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding, \u201cNovember is our chance to redeclare American independence. \u201d Initially, Mr. Farage expressed reticence in directly addressing the politics of the election, noting that he himself had criticized President Obama\u2019s speech in Britain before the Brexit vote. \u201cHaving criticized and condemned his behavior, I could not possibly tell you how to vote in this election, but  \u2026    \u201d he said as he let his voice trail off and the crowd whoop itself into a frenzy. Moments later, he reversed course. \u201cIf I was an American citizen, I wouldn\u2019t vote for Hillary Clinton if you paid me,\u201d he said, and urged the crowd to \u201cget your walking boots on\u201d and \u201cget out there campaigning. \u201d For the rest of the rally, Mr. Trump ran through most of his standard stump speech, repeatedly harping on the immigration plan of Mrs. Clinton and accusing her of playing identity politics and delivering his harshest criticism of the candidate\u2019s relationship with minority voters. \u201cHillary Clinton is a bigot who sees people of color only as votes, not as human beings worthy of a better future,\u201d Mr. Trump told the crowd. Mr. Trump and Mr. Farage appeared at a   dinner before the rally, where Mr. Trump had said he was brilliant for championing Brexit and remind the crowd that he predicted the victory, according to an attendee at the dinner. Mr. Farage\u2019s presence seemed to offer Mr. Trump living proof of his   clairvoyance, as Mr. Trump constantly says in his speeches that he is \u201cvery good at predicting. \u201d There was the occasional moment at the rally, however, when the declared parallels between the Brexit vote and the Trump campaign seemed to be lost on the crowd. At one point, Mr. Farage ratcheted his voice up with the gusto normally reserved for an applause line. \u201cThe big coward,\u201d he shouted, referring to   Minister David Cameron, and attacking him for inviting a \u201cforeign visitor\u201d to London. More silence from the crowd. \u201cYes, we were visited by one Barack Obama,\u201d he said. The boos rained down.'"}, "time": 1742562200.8597186}
