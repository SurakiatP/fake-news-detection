From the producers of \u201cAlone Yet Not Alone,\u201d the movie is a powerful tale of restoring and strengthening relationships between fathers and their children. \\nAccording to Dr. Ted Baehr, founder of Movieguide, \u201c \u2018Hero\u2019 is an excellent movie about God turning a man\u2019s heart to his son and a son learning to forgive his father.\u201d \\nDr. Baehr added, \u201cThe opening is powerful. The ending is heartrending. The drama, the acting, the jeopardy work well throughout the whole movie. This is one of the few movies that Movieguide can actually say go see it.\u201d Keith Harris and Nick Edwards as Wynn and Sammy Heller \\n\u201cHero\u201d opens with Joe (played by Burgess Jenkins) coaching his son David\u2019s baseball team, the Gappers, to the state championship. Seven years later, after pursuing his dream job, Joe returns to town. He had left to pursue fame and fortune to support the family. His wife, Hannah, is stricken with cancer, while David is angry that Joe left them. After Hannah\u2019s funeral, Joe moves back into the house, but David remains bitter. Meanwhile, David is coaching the now hapless Gappers; the team loses more than it wins. Joe steps in to get other fathers involved with their sons and turn the team of losers into winners, hoping this gesture will help Joe reconcile with David. Unfortunately, the league rules have softened dramatically, making it nearly impossible to train the team properly: practice times are limited, coaches can\u2019t make players take laps around the field, everyone gets a \u201cparticipation\u201d trophy. The beloved American pastime has become so boring that few parents show up for games, let alone practices. So, Joe starts his own league to turns things around. \\nFrom the director of \u201cIsaiah 9:10 Judgment\u201d and the producer of \u201cAlone Not Yet Alone\u201d comes \u201cHero,\u201d a beautiful tale of the significance of the father-child relationship that\u2019s and set around America\u2019s pastime, baseball. \\nOne of the fathers Joe pursues for the new league is the warden of the local prison, Mr. Redding (played by Gregory Alan Williams). Redding\u2019s career mirrors that of Joe. He\u2019s been offered a big job in Washington, D.C. Like Joe, he\u2019s lured by fame and fortune at the expense of his relationship with his son and family. In contrast, another Gapper teammate has a father who\u2019s actually a prison inmate under Redding. Unlike many of the absent fathers outside the prison walls, the inmate father has a great desire to practice baseball with his son, but he cannot due to prison rules. Justin Miles and Burgess Jenkins as David and Joe Finn in the film, \u201cEvery Boy Needs a Hero\u201d \\nWhat makes \u201cHero\u201d particularly compelling today is that it addresses the growing crisis of absentee fathers and its impact on baseball itself. \\nWatch the trailer: \\nWashington Times reporter Bradford Richardson wrote in his article, \u201cStudy blames absent fathers for decline in black baseball players,\u201d that the Austin Institute, a Texas-based think tank focused on family and societal issues, has commissioned a study titled, \u201cCalled Out at Home,\u201d which shows a correlation between the decline of black fatherhood and the drop in black participation in baseball. \\nFrom the director of \u201cIsaiah 9:10 Judgment\u201d and the producer of \u201cAlone Not Yet Alone\u201d comes \u201cHero,\u201d a beautiful tale of the significance of the father-child relationship that\u2019s and set around America\u2019s pastime, baseball. \\nRichardson writes: \\nKevin Stuart, executive director of the Austin Institute, said fathers are natural teachers of baseball because \u201cit takes two to play catch.\u201d \\nThere is a \u201clong-standing connection between fatherhood and baseball,\u201d Mr. Stuart said, pointing to famous father-son tandems who have played in the Major Leagues and the prominence of father-son relationships in popular baseball movies such as \u201cField of Dreams.\u201d \\nBaseball, he said, was made to be played by fathers and sons. \\n\u201cBaseball seems to fall somewhere in the middle, where what\u2019s really necessary, or what appears to us to be necessary in order to really improve skills, is at least one other person deeply and personally committed on a regular basis to working with you,\u201d Mr. Stuart said. \\nAnecdotal evidence seems to corroborate the study\u2019s connection between fatherhood and baseball. \\nFamous father-son tandems \u2013 including Ken Griffey Sr. and Ken Griffey Jr., Prince Fielder and Cecil Fielder, and Tony Gwynn Sr. and Tony Gwynn Jr. \u2013 have talked about how the game was handed down from one generation to the next. \\n\u201cHero\u201d received a powerful endorsement from renowned Christian author Stormie Omartian: \\n\u201cFor such a time as this, \u2018Hero\u2019 is an important movie about the estranged relationship between a father and his son, who learn how to reconcile using faith and baseball,\u201d Farah said. \\nBaehr concluded, \u201c\u2018Hero\u2019 is a wonderful, faith-filled sports drama. It will touch your heart, your mind and your soul.\u201d Gapper team dads from the film, \u201cEvery Boy Needs a Hero\u201d'"}, "time": 1742561734.5511117}
