But not surprising. I\u2019m thinking of CNN journo Brian Stelter who asserted\u2014they never argue, do they? They only ever assert\u2014that skepticism about voting irregularities in America is \u201cdangerous.\u201d \\nWell, a journalist decrying inquisitiveness and skepticism: Now that\u2019s dangerous. \\nStelter\u2014he\u2019s a danger to journalism\u2014and the rest of the media Idiocracy like to repeat that Russian hackers (never the Stelters of the world) are undermining America\u2019s great electoral system. I ask you: What can the Russians do to us that America\u2019s elites have not already done? \\nWhen broadcaster Lars Larson attempted to find out whether one Arcan Cetin was a citizen of the US, ICE, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told him, essentially, \u201cSorry, our obligation is to protect this migrant\u2019s privacy.\u201d \\n\u201cWho,\u201d you ask, \u201cis Mr. Cetin\u201d? Cetin is a contributor to the phenomenon I term \u201cmurder-by-Muslim-immigrant.\u201d He murdered five innocents, north of Seattle. \\nArcan Cetin voted, reports Mr. Larson. But nobody at ICE was willing to tell a good citizen like our broadcaster if Cetin voted legally or not. \\nAs it turned out, a sigh of relief was in order. The stellar Mr. Cetin, who, like most Muslim immigrants, voted Democrat, violated the Sixth Commandment five times, but, thank G-d, did not appear to have violated the commandment against voter fraud. Rumor has it that the murderer had been awarded citizenship, although it\u2019s impossible to ascertain. \\nThe point I\u2019m making here is that you can rest assured voter fraud is rampant in the US as in any banana republic\u2014and not only because an American is barred from checking whether a Muslim murderer is a fellow-citizen. But because leftists have fought down-and-dirty to bar any proof of citizenship at the time of voting. Yes, the law requires, in my state, as in most of these United States, that you be a citizen, as well as a resident of the state in which you\u2019re voting. But you don\u2019t always have to provide proof of citizenship when voting. \\nTo vote in Washington State, as in most states, what\u2019s needed is a driver\u2019s license or a current State ID card . Essentially, the American voting system, thanks to the triumph of left-liberalism, is based on an honor system. \\nJournalist John Fund\u2019s research has shown that when they vote, \u201c80 percent of non-citizens vote Democratic.\u201d And that \u201c6.4 percent of non-citizens voted illegally in the 2008 election.\u201d Funds\u2019 sources confirm that a significant number of \u201cnon-citizens register as voters\u201d and have voted in sufficient numbers to sway elections. \\nAnd when these efforts fail, the government might just step in to commit indirect voter fraud. \\nFor instance, the Feds recently and wrongly granted citizenship to hundreds facing deportation, an \u201cerror\u201d the culprits where unwilling to correct. The point is that leftists, Obama\u2019s DOJ, in particular, have pursued every legal remedy in the book against states seeking to require proof of citizenship from voters. \\nThe point is that we\u2019re a sprawling country of competing interests, in which raw, ripe democracy has long-since usurped the old constitutional republic, where limits were placed on the power of thumping majorities. In a rank, raw democracy, where might makes right, and almost every vote is a lien against someone\u2019s private property; voter-fraud by default is a big deal. \\nDonald Trump\u2019s supporters might be the losers in something of a rigged electoral system; but they\u2019re certainly not stupid. \\nThat\u2019s another oft-repeated thing. Trump\u2019s base of supporters is referred to as whites without college degrees. Again and again we hear that Mr. Trump is over-performing with white men without college degrees. The reference is intended not only as a demographic marker, but as a Mark of Cain. \\nWorse has been said about this statistical cohort. Quoted in \u201cThe Trump Revolution: The Donald\u2019s Creative Destruction Deconstructed\u201d are Republicans and Democrats alike, maligning Trump\u2019s Middle America as worthy of contempt. \\nYou had writer Kathleen Parker hissing about Trump\u2019s \u201cundereducated\u201d supporters. There was Joan Walsh, Salon editor-in-chief, proclaiming on MSNBC that she looked at those people and felt sad. \u201cThey share such a low common denominator,\u201d groaned Joan about the \u201ccrazy, entertaining, simplistic talk\u201d of the Trumpsters. \u201cThey\u2019re all Republicans. \u2026 they really don\u2019t have a firm grasp on reality,\u201d she sneered. \\nNational Journal\u2019s Ron Brownstein had his own taxonomy for Trumpsters. \u201cUpscale Republicans\u201d (or those on the panel with him), vs. \u201cblue-collar Republicans.\u201d Nothing but \u201cdownscale whites,\u201d derided another Democratic strategist. \\nAnyhow, implicit in tethering a lack of education to Trump support is that the more educated a voter, the smarter. And the smarter the voter, the more likely he or she is to support Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. \\nBut correlation, of course, is not causation. My hypothesis points to a confounding variable or factor\u2014another variable related to both education and voting-patterns that could account for the good sense displayed by Trump supporters without college degrees. \\nVoters without college or university degrees have not been institutionalized during life\u2019s formative years. \\nVoters without college or university degrees have not spent years in the tertiary school asylums. \\nIn other words, many of Trump\u2019s supporters are less likely to have been brainwashed and propagandized by the asphyxiating, postmodern, racial and gender agitprop that makes college-educated kids so insufferable and subject to group-think. \\nSpending protracted time in college or university is almost guaranteed to turn-out individuals whose uniformity of opinion is as scary as its uninformed nature. \\nSome support for my theory, namely that support for Trump is associated with a less propagandized population, is evident from the fact that Trump has an advantage with independents, which, as the label indicates, have a greater propensity to think outside-the-box.'"}, "time": 1742564035.8876624}
