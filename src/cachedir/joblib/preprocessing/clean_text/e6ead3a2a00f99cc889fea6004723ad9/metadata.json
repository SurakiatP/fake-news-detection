Hannity categorized Maddow\u2019s effort as being part of what he called \u201cthe   propaganda media\u201d and offered other examples in addition to Maddow of attacks on Trump. Partial transcript as follows: NBC\u2019s corporate jihad against President Donald Trump continues. Plus, a new report from Circa News shows the investigation into a server connected to Donald Trump was, in fact, a politically motivated hit job pushed by a   Hillary Clinton donor. By the way, that\u2019s tonight\u2019s \u201cOpening Monologue. \u201d All right, NBC has now hit a new low by releasing the president\u2019s tax returns, or a small portion of them, last night. But what we\u2019re seeing from the alt left propaganda destroy Donald Trump media  \u2014   it\u2019s not new. Now that Donald Trump occupies the Oval Office, the opposition party press is going to new extremes and lows to try and take down his presidency, and they won\u2019t stop until he\u2019s out of office. Now, I\u2019ve been saying since 2008 right here on this program journalism is dead. Now it\u2019s in the ground, buried, flowers on top. And last night\u2019s political hit job by NBC is just the latest example in the media\u2019s long list of attacks against the president. Here\u2019s just a small sampling. (END VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Here you have a deranged president, or a pathologically lying president, lying about the operations of the American government and lying about the previous president of the United States. That\u2019s enough to invoke the 25th Amendment, but Mike Pence and the cabinet are not there yet. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When he said today \u201cAmerica first,\u201d it was not just a racial  \u2014   I mean, I shouldn\u2019t say racial, the Hitlerian background to it  \u2026     UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I understand why so many people voted for him. I understand where you were coming from. I understand why you liked him. But this man is lying to you. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Trump\u2019s critics, those who are worried about this president and this White House, saw a live special television event brought to you by narcissism, thin skin, chaos and deeply personal grievances. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This was a whitelash. This was a whitelash against a changing country. It was a whitelash against a black president in part. And that\u2019s the part where the pain comes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is a really sad night. I\u2019m just going to say it. This is a very sad night for the country. You can\u2019t polish this turd. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don\u2019t know  \u2014   are you using the word lie or falsehood? What are you  \u2014   what are you  \u2026     UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I mean, I think you have use  \u2014   the word  \u2014   the word  \u2014   you have to call it what it is. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It was interesting because I saw Sean Spicer on FOX News, and he said that you were rude. And I thought  \u2026     (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What if you had called him a fake president? (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Beyond awful. And when the alt left propaganda media isn\u2019t doing what you just saw and attacking the integrity and mental health of the president, well, they\u2019re running wild all kinds of bizarre conspiracy theories about the Trump campaign colluding with the Russians. Now, what the biased press refuses to tell you  \u2014   there is zero  \u2014   no evidence whatsoever that shows any kind of collusion. Well, that didn\u2019t stop the leader of the   propaganda media, Rachel Maddow herself, from going off the deep end last night, claiming that in 2005, a Russian oligarch knew that Donald Trump was going to be president, so he bought a property from him in Florida and Trump made a huge profit, more than two times what he paid for it! And as I said last night, Maddow thinks that somehow, maybe Russia knew in 2005 that Donald Trump would be elected president in 2016. Unfortunately, NBC News didn\u2019t think that was possible even on election night. Now, that\u2019s pretty pathetic, and the media should know better, but they\u2019d rather put their radical   agenda than telling the truth to the American people. That\u2019s why they never vetted Obama. That\u2019s why they colluded with Hillary. Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor'"}, "time": 1742563278.3537054}
