[The Netherlands AEX benchmark stock index has been rising sharply this year, outpacing impressive gains seen in broader European indexes. Conventional wisdom has it that these gains are a sign that asset managers assign a very low probability to a victory by Wilders and the Party for Freedom.  Here\u2019s a representative sample from CNBC: \u201cThe blase market reaction is because it\u2019s not a core economy like France or Germany, but it does set the table for the rest of the year,\u201d said Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group. \u201cThere\u2019s also a consensus that they won\u2019t be able to form a [coalition]. I think that\u2019s why nobody\u2019s too worried. \u201d \u201cBut even though I don\u2019t see an upset here, I do think markets are underpricing risk here,\u201d he said. This echoes a lot of the commentary about how the market would crash in reaction to a Donald Trump victory. We now know that commentary got it backwards: markets boomed after Trump won in November. Similarly, stocks in the U. K. rallied within days of the Brexit vote that many experts had predicted would bring doom to the British economy. In other words, markets appear to like   nationalism and populism. Instead of underpricing the \u201crisk\u201d of a Wilders victory, markets are more likely pricing in the odds of a Wilders victory as a positive factor. There\u2019s another reason to think Dutch stocks would rise with a Wilders victory. That begins with the observation that Wilders is often described as \u201cthe Dutch Trump. \u201d With 21% of the revenue of the companies in the AEX index derived from the U. S. according to a recent Wall Street Journal report, joining America\u2019s embrace of economic nationalism and populism is likely to lead to improved conditions for the businesses in the index. It\u2019s always dangerous to project future events based on the movements of financial markets. But if there is a message in the Dutch stock market, it is likely that the chances of a Wilders win are stronger than polls and pundits suggest.'"}, "time": 1742563057.7853973}
