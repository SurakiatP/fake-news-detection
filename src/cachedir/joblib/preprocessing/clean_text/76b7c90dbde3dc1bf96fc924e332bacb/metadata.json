C.  \u2014   Vice President Mike Pence addressed a sea of nearly 20, 000 people at the annual American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) conference on Sunday, where he spoke of the \u201cunbreakable\u201d bond between the United States and Israel. [Pence also assured those gathered that his administration would subdue the Iranian regime\u2019s destabilizing efforts in the region, vowing that the atrocities which haunt the Jewish people from the past would never again manifest itself. He also reiterated President Donald Trump\u2019s promise to move the U. S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.  \u201cAfter decades of simply talking about it, the President of the United States is giving serious consideration to moving the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem,\u201d Pence said. Last month, Trump met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and said his administration was looking at the move \u201cvery, very strongly. \u201d He also said, \u201cWe\u2019re looking at it with great care. \u201d Pence noted that while talks between the Israelis and Palestinians would require some compromises, \u201cPresident Trump will never compromise the safety and security of the Jewish State Israel. \u201d The Islamic Republic of Iran\u2019s destabilizing efforts in the Middle East have been a major concern for America\u2019s regional allies. But the threat has not been greater for any nation than for Israel, the subject of   death chants at Iranian schools that attempt to indoctrinate youth against the leader of the free world. The people of Iran, however, are a separate entity from the regime and also suffer under the oppression of the Islamic regime. \u201cThe Ayatollahs in Tehran openly admit their desire to wipe Israel off the map and drive its people into the sea,\u201d Pence said. \u201cAmerica will no longer tolerate Iran\u2019s efforts to destabilize the region and jeopardize Israel\u2019s security,\u201d Pence assured. He told them that \u201cunder President Donald Trump, the United States of America will not allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapon. This is our solemn promise to you, to Israel, and to the world. History attests that enmity toward the Jewish people often turns from evil thought to evil action. \u201d The vice president was moved to tears as he related the gripping story of his meeting with a Holocaust survivor during his visit to the first Nazi concentration camp in Dachau, Germany, last month, after attending a security conference there. His tour guide, Abdi Noor, 93, had been imprisoned in Dachau as a    boy. Pence described the hellish torment Noor had experienced as a slave in the Nazi camp. Then, he described the defining moment of his trip. \u201cThen he stopped, looked up at me with tears in his eyes and said words I\u2019ll never forget. He said, \u2018Then the Americans came.\u2019 I was so proud. Those words underscored the imperative of American strength, and they powerfully remind us of the immutable bond between our people and the people of Israel,\u201d Pence said. He added, \u201cUnder President Trump\u2019s leadership, America will be strong, stronger than ever before. \u201d Before Pence took the stage, virtuoso Hagai Shaham played Israel\u2019s national anthem, the \u201cHatikvah,\u201d on the violin. The Nazis had forced Jews to play violins as they witnessed their fellow Jews march to their deaths in gas chambers. At one point during Shaham\u2019s performance, the crowd lent their voices to the sound of the instrument and sang the words to the song, which means \u201cThe Hope. \u201d Pence finished his speech by telling those gathered, \u201cI know with all of my heart that with your help, with God\u2019s help, and with the strong leadership of President Donald Trump, our nations and our peoples will remain forever friends, and we will go forth together to meet the glorious future that awaits. Thank you. God bless you, God bless Israel, and God bless the United States of America. \u201d Follow Adelle Nazarian on Facebook and Twitter.'"}, "time": 1742563495.218589}
