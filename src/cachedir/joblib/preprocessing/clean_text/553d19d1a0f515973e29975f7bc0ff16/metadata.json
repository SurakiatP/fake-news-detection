'I think that he successfully mobilized a big chunk of the country to vote for him,' Obama told reporters.   Barack Obama delivered a series of patronizing backhanded compliments to President-Elect Donald Trump on Monday during a lengthy White House press conference conducted before his final trip abroad as America\u2019s leader. While he praised Trump for pulling off \u2018one of the biggest political upsets in history,\u2019 Obama scolded his Republican successor for believing he can deliver on his campaign promises . \u2018I think that he successfully mobilized a big chunk of the country to vote for him,\u2019 Obama told reporters. But \u2018regardless of what experience or assumptions he brought to the office, this office has a way of waking you up.\u2019\u2018And those aspects of his positions or predispositions that don\u2019t match up with reality, he will find shaken up pretty quick. Because reality has a way of asserting itself.\u2019 Trump campaigned on an no-holds-barred agenda of dismantling much of Obama\u2019s agenda including immigration reforms put in place without congressional input, a widely criticized Iranian nuclear deal and an Obamacare system whose pilings have grown shaky. But the president suggested the billionaire\u2019s poetic rallies can never jive with Washington\u2019s messier prose. \u2018I think it\u2019ll be important for him to have the room, to staff up, to figure out what his priorities are, to be able to distinguish between what he was campaigning on and what is practical \u2013 what he can actually achieve,\u2019 Obama cautioned. \u2018You know, there are certain things that made for good good soundbites, but don\u2019t always translate into good policy. And that\u2019s something that he and his team will wrestle with in the same way every president wrestles with.\u2019 Ultimately, Obama hinted , he believes Trump is more a realist than a principled conservative \u2013 despite connecting with a previously disengaged voting base on the strength of broad promises.  \""}, "time": 1742564481.7167819}
