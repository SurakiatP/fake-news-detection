Will, who had a   with O\u2019Reilly in November 2015 over some of the details in O\u2019Reilly\u2019s \u201cKilling Reagan\u201d book, said for Fox News to brand itself as something other than \u201ca somewhat stale product\u201d was contingent on moving beyond O\u2019Reilly. \u201cIt\u2019s like being called you ugly by a frog,\u201d Will said. \u201cMr. O\u2019Reilly is, on air is reckless, coarse and bullying. Turns out off the air, he\u2019s reckless, coarse and bullying. So there\u2019s a kind of seamlessness here. I think Fox News has to decide what it wants to be and for whom it wants to be a news source. It seems as long as Bill O\u2019Reilly is the face of Fox News, and let\u2019s face it, he is, their ability to expand their brand and to diversify their audience and become something other than a somewhat stale product depends on moving beyond Bill O\u2019Reilly. \u201d \u201cPower Lunch\u201d   Michelle   asked how that squared with the fact the O\u2019Reilly puts up the biggest numbers in cable news, to which Will said it was based more on brand loyalty than personalities. \u201cWell, the question is, are they loyal to Bill O\u2019Reilly or are they loyal to the Fox brand itself?\u201d Will replied. \u201cWhen Megyn Kelly left, and they put Tucker Carlson in her slot, nothing happened. The ratings stayed strong, and the viewers were happy. I have a feeling that Mr. O\u2019Reilly is replaceable. As Charles de Gaulle once said, the graveyards are full of indispensable men. \u201d Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor'"}, "time": 1742562735.908087}
