Donald is a strong figurehead, his sons are composed, and Ivanka will be the first woman president. Melania just shook the nation with a new, incredible speech (that Michelle Obama cannot claim!) ***Now a new Trump has risen. Earlier today, Melania shook the nation with a new, incredible speech (that Michelle Obama cannot claim!) \\nShe took the stage in Berwyn, PA and began with a simple smile. Then, Melania opened up and told a story. A story of a little girl growing up in the Soviet Union and dreaming of someday being an American. \\nShe told how that little girl made it here. She worked hard and got LEGAL citizenship. And now, that same little girl is about to become our next 1st lady. She is that little girl. \u201cWhen I was 10-years-old we learned that a man named Ronald Reagan was elected president of the United States of America. President Reagan\u2019s \u201cmorning in America\u201d was not just something in the United States, it began to feel like morning around the world, even in my small country. It was a true inspiration to me.\u201d I think Melania Trump is a true inspiration to American immigrants. She is proof that hard work and dedication can pave the way to success in this country. If you agree and wanna help share this amazing speech out, all you gotta do is send it to all your best Facebook friends who love Trump. We can do this together! '"}, "time": 1742628400.5467806}
