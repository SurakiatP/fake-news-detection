Gingrich said, \u201cThe second one is part of the left\u2019s whole mythology. If you show up at a hospital with a brand new baby and the brand new baby has a heart problem, the doctors at the hospital do everything they can to save the baby. They don\u2019t say we will take care of the baby after you write a check, they try to save the baby\u2019s life. That\u2019s true across the board in this country. That is just part of the mythology of the left. The problem you have with humor in America today is that Hollywood is so enraged at Donald Trump that they can\u2019t be funny. All they\u2019ve got is pure anger. And that\u2019s what\u2019s coming out in this stuff. They think it must be funny because they\u2019re called comedians, so they exhibit their anger, as almost a pathology, on   television, and you are supposed to laugh because after all, they are comedians. They ain\u2019t funny \u2019cause they\u2019re too angry to be funny. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742561951.6608233}
