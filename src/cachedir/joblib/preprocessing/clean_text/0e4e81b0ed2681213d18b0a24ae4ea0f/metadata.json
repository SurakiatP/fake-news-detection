[\u201cFrom the [European] Commission\u2019s point of view, success for Marine Le Pen is a disaster and an existential threat to the European project,\u201d a top official from the bloc\u2019s unelected executive told Politico. \u201cWe can survive a Brexit, but not a Frexit. \u201d  Ms. Le Pen has stopped short of openly endorsing French withdrawal from the EU but has pledged a \u201cFrance First\u201d economic policy should she win office, levying taxes on companies which move jobs out of the country and reintroducing the French franc alongside the     euro currency  \u2014   policies which would fall foul of EU law. The economic patriotism which I advocate is impossible within the European Union ! https:  .   \u2014   Marine in English (@Marine2017_EN) March 6, 2017, Following mass casualty terror attacks in Paris, Nice, and elsewhere in France, Ms. Le Pen also pledged to take France out of the EU\u2019s   Schengen area, which former Interpol chief Robert Nobel has described as \u201can international   zone for terrorists\u201d. Politico\u2019s sources inside the European Commission, however, have insisted that \u201cThere is no legal way to leave the euro or Schengen and still remain in the European Union. \u201d By preventing us from having national borders, the European Union condemns us to undergo #mass immigration #Marine2017 https:  .   \u2014   Marine in English (@Marine2017_EN) March 10, 2017, Another top staffer confessed the prospect of a Le Pen presidency \u201cworries us  \u2014   without any doubt   \u2026     After the UK [referendum] and the U. S. election, it would almost be a natural consequence. \u201d Conscious of its unpopularity, the EU as an institution has played only an   role in events like the Brexit referendum, but has intervened far more directly in the French elections. Pierre Moscovici, the European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, Taxation and Customs, has said it would be \u201ca mistake\u201d to avoid confronting politicians like Ms. Le Pen directly, as \u201cFrance leaving Europe   \u2026     would both kill Europe and make France choke severely\u201d. \u201dI am convinced this is not an example to follow\u201d: my remarks on #Brexit to @bbckamal https:  .  #Davos #wef17 pic. twitter.   \u2014   Pierre Moscovici (@pierremoscovici) January 19, 2017,  \u201cThe Commission would vote [Emmanuel] Macron without any doubt,\u201d a top Commission official confessed to Politico, referring to Ms. Le Pen\u2019s main rival for the presidency. Macron, a   independent in the cast of former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, served as economy minister in Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s socialist government.'"}, "time": 1742563932.8426116}
