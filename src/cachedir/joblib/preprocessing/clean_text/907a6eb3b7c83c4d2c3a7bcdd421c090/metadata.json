The minister is in custody and awaiting charges. \\nAlexey Ulyukaev \\n\u201cThe circumstances of the crime are connected with Alexey Ulyukayev, who occupies a public post in the Russian Federation, receiving $2 million on November 14 for the positive assessment provided by the Economic Development Ministry that allowed Rosneft to complete the deal on purchasing the government\u2019s 50 percent stake in Bashneft,\u201d Svetlana Petrenko, deputy head of the Investigative Committee, said in an official statement. \\nPresident Vladimir Putin named Ulyukayev, at the time a first deputy governor of Bank of Russia, economy minister in June 2013; it is unclear what prompted his fall from grace. \\nThe case comes as Rosneft is preparing a mandatory offer to buy out minorities in Bashneft , where it purchased a 50.08 percent stake for 329.69 billion rubles ($5 billion). Rosneft\u2019s Oct. 12 purchase from the government was made at a premium to the market, or 3,706.4 rubles for each common share it bought. Bashneft shares closed at 3,480 rubles in Moscow on Nov. 14, or 6.1 percent below the purchase price \\nThe Bashneft deal, around which the charges against Ulyukayev revolve, is not going to be revised during the probe, Petrenko told RIA Novosti. \\n\u201cThe necessary investigative actions concerning Ulyukayev are under way,\u201d the Investigative Committee\u2019s spokesperson said quoted by RT . Ulyukayev was detained in the act of taking a bribe amid an investigative experiment, Petrenko revealed, as cited by RIA Novosti. \u201cUlyukayev was caught red-handed when receiving a bribe,\u201d she said. According to Petrenko, the minister resorted to threats, attempting to extort the money from Rosneft officials. \\nThe experiment was prompted by evidence law enforcement obtained by wiretapping Ulyukayev\u2019s cell phone and those of his entourage, a source told RIA Novosti. Petrenko said that a criminal case has been opened under part 6 of Article 290 of the Russian Criminal Code, which covers \u201clarge-scale bribery.\u201d \\nUlyukayev has been under investigation by Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service (FSB) for over a year, a source told RIA Novosti. \\n\u201cThe minister has been monitored by FSB agents for more than a year. It is unclear if he was suspected from the beginning of what he is accused now, but he has definitely been observed for more than a year,\u201d he said. \\nPetrenko told RIA Novosti that the Bashneft deal, around which the charges against Ulyukayev revolve, is not going to be revised during the probe. \u201cThe acquisition of Bashneft stock was made in accordance with the law and is not the subject of a criminal investigation,\u201d she said. \\nMore details on the arrest from RT: \\nPursuant to Russian law, Ulyukayev faces a maximum penalty of a fine ranging from 80 to 100 times the sum of the bribe. In addition to this, if found guilty, he would be stripped of the right to serve in certain state positions or engage in certain activities for eight to 15 years. \\nAlternatively, the law says the suspect may face from eight to 15 years behind bars and a fine of 70 times the sum of the bribe, or would have to serve the prison term without paying monetary compensation. \\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the accusations brought against Ulyukayev were \u201cvery serious\u201d and required \u201cvery serious proof.\u201d \\n\u201cIn any case, only a court can decide,\u201d Peskov said, adding that he did not know if President Vladimir Putin was aware of the minister\u2019s arrest. \\nIn October, Russia\u2019s largest oil company, Rosneft, purchased the state-owned stake in a major regional oil company, Bashneft, for about $5.3 billion. The deal was approved by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, although back in September, President Vladimir Putin expressed his concerns over the potential takeover of one state-controlled company by another. \\n\u201cProbably it\u2019s not the best option when one company under state control acquires another purely state company,\u201d Putin said in an interview with Bloomberg. He added however, that the biggest bid would win as Russia \u201ccannot discriminate against market participants, not a single one of them.\u201d As the deal was finalized, Ulyukayev said there was another competitor to acquire the stake, but Rosneft had outbid that offer. \\nIt is unclear who Ulyukayev\u2019s replacement will be during the criminal proceeding.
