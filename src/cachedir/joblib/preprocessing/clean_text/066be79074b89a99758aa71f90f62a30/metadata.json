Trump mischievously began to question President Obama\u2019s birthplace aloud in television interviews. \u201cI\u2019m starting to think that he was not born here,\u201d he said at the time. It was not true in 2012, when he took to Twitter to declare that \u201can \u2018extremely credible source\u2019\u201d had called his office to inform him that Mr. Obama\u2019s birth certificate was \u201ca fraud. \u201d It was not true in 2014, when Mr. Trump invited hackers to \u201cplease hack Obama\u2019s college records (destroyed?) and check \u2018place of birth. \u2019\u201d It was never true, any of it. Mr. Obama\u2019s citizenship was never in question. No credible evidence ever suggested otherwise. Yet it took Mr. Trump five years of dodging, winking and joking to surrender to reality, finally, on Friday, after a remarkable campaign of relentless deception that tried to undermine the legitimacy of the nation\u2019s first black president. In fact, it took Mr. Trump much longer than that: Mr. Obama released his   birth certificate from the Hawaii Department of Health in 2008. Most of the world moved on. But not Mr. Trump. He nurtured the conspiracy like a poisonous flower, watering and feeding it with an ardor that still baffles and embarrasses many around him. Mr. Trump called up   sowers of the same corrosive rumor, asking them for advice on how to take a falsehood and make it mainstream in 2011, as he weighed his own run for the White House. \u201cWhat can we do to get to the bottom of this?\u201d Mr. Trump asked Joseph Farah, an author who has long labored on the fringes of political life. \u201cWhat can we do to turn the tide?\u201d What he could do  \u2014   and what he did do  \u2014   was talk about it, uninhibitedly, on social media, where dark rumors flourish in   bursts and, inevitably, find a home with those who have no need for facts and whose suspicions can never be allayed. And he mused about it on television, where bright lights and sparse editing ensure that millions can hear falsehoods unchallenged by  . \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he show his birth certificate?\u201d Mr. Trump asked on ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View. \u201d \u201cI want to see his birth certificate,\u201d he told Fox News\u2019s \u201cOn the Record. \u201d And so it went. The essential question  \u2014   Why promote a lie?  \u2014   may be unanswerable. Was it sport? Was it his lifelong quest to court media attention? Was it racism? Was it the cynical start of his eventual campaign for president? It might not matter. He kept doing it, even as his most senior aides assured the public that he had long since abandoned the fallacy. He had not. He was disingenuous until the very end, telling a Washington Post reporter just 72 hours before that he was unready to concede the president\u2019s place of birth. But he treated the weighty topic, as he does so much else, like a television cliffhanger, promising a major declaration on Friday. And then, around 11 a. m. Friday in Washington, he gave up the lie. But he conjured up a bizarre new deception, congratulating himself for putting to rest the doubts about Mr. Obama that he had fanned since 2011. \u201cI finished it,\u2019\u2019 he declared, unapologetically. \u201cPresident Obama was born in the United States  \u2014   period. \u2019\u2019 Surrounded by, and in many ways shielded by, decorated veterans in his new Washington hotel, he could not resist indulging in another falsehood  \u2014   that his opponent, Hillary Clinton, had started the   birther movement. She did not. Much has been made of Mr. Trump\u2019s casual elasticity with the truth he has exhausted an army of   with his mischaracterizations, exaggerations and fabrications. But this lie was different from the start, an insidious, calculated calumny that sought to undo the embrace of an   president by the 69 million voters who elected him in 2008. In the end, it seemed, Mr. Trump\u2019s plot to diminish Mr. Obama did not succeed. On Friday, the president of the United States seemed much bigger. \u201cI was pretty confident about where I was born,\u201d Mr. Obama said from the White House, a wry smile crossing his face. \u201cI think most people were as well. \u2019\u2019 And the president had this to say about the myth heedlessly spread by the man seeking to replace him: \u201cMy hope would be that the presidential election reflects more serious issues than that. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563935.5563562}
