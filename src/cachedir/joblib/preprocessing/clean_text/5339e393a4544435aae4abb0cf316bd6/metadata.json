But when she tried to blow the whistle, she was viciously attacked, publicly humiliated, threatened, intimidated, and more. Unfortunately, though, as Warah explains in her new book UNsilenced: UNmasking the United Nations' Culture of Cover-ups, Corruption and Impunity , her case is far from unique. \\nIn fact, the corruption and lawlessness across the UN appears to be systemic. Some of the cases described in the book and the pages of The New American magazine make the scandals she exposed and the retaliation she suffered seem mild by comparison. Indeed, in her book, she actually spends very little time dwelling on her own case, but delves instead into some of the many other known and unknown scandals to rock the global organization. \\nPerhaps the most grotesque whistleblower-related story in recent memory surrounds the now-infamous case of Anders Kompass, the UN human-rights official who exposed child-rape by \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d troops in Africa after the UN refused to act on it. But the book is filled with startling examples of corruption, mismanagement, and more, ranging from brazen theft of taxpayer money to the sexual abuse and exploitation of children by UN \u201cpeace\u201d troops. Just the quotes from the UN whistleblowers exposing the putrid UN culture of impunity make the book worth reading. Apparently the UN did not want a \u201cculture of snitches,\u201d as one whistleblower put it. \\nIt got so bad that in 2015, as Warah explains, a coalition of nine UN whistleblowers got together to raise the matter with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon. \u201cEach of us has blown the whistle on serious wrongdoing, gross misconduct, and even criminal acts at the United Nations,\u201d the group wrote in the letter, which is quoted in the book. \u201cOur collective experience of reporting misconduct in the UN covers sexual exploitation, abuse of power, corruption, and other criminals activity over a period of more than a decade and a half.\u201d \\nInstead of the UN scrambling to make things right, though, it responded in every case by attacking the whistleblower instead of the crimes, abuse, and the people behind the problems. \u201cEach of us has faced retaliation for reporting the wrongdoing,\u201d the whistleblowers continued. \u201cOur cases are well-known, and sadly, deter others from reporting wrongdoing. This must change.\u201d Unfortunately for humanity, despite threats from Congress to cut funding, and increasingly widespread media attention, nothing has changed, as the book documents extensively. \\nWarah's realization that something was very wrong at the UN began while she was serving at UN-Habitat as an editor of various publications, including the important \u201cState of the World's Cities\u201d report. Her troubles began in 2009, when she traveled to Bahrain with Anna Tibaijuka, the executive director of the UN-Habitat agency that focuses on promoting \u201csustainable\u201d cities. During the visit, Warah explained, some Bahrain officials asked how their money was being used. \\n\u201cThe executive director did not provide an adequate response, and thinking that perhaps she had not been briefed about it, I made my own inquiries when I returned to Nairobi,\u201d explained Warah, a Kenyan of Indian heritage. \u201cI discovered that at least $350,000 of the $1 million donation Bahrain had made to UN-Habitat could not be accounted for. When I asked my supervisors if they knew where the money went, they descended on me like a tonne of bricks, even threatening to not talk to me any more.\u201d \\nAt that time, Warah realized that \u201cthe money had probably been used on personal projects or maybe even diverted to individuals within the organization.\u201d In an interesting turn of events, Warah later concluded that the monarchy in Bahrain did not even really care if its money has been used properly. Instead, it seems that the regime was involved in a sort of tit-for-tat agreement. \\n\u201cIn 2007, the Prime Minister of Bahrain, Shaikh Khalifa, had been awarded the UN-Habitat Scroll on Honour award for \u00b4his outstanding efforts in raising the living standards of Bahrainis,\u00b4\u201d Warah added in an e-mail about her experiences. \u201cThis was just before Bahrain experienced its own Arab spring, when the monarchy's legitimacy was being questioned. The huge donation to UN-Habitat was probably how Bahrain's monarchy 'bought' international legitimacy through the UN.\u201d \\nAround that same time, Warah had already started to question how some of the alleged statistics used in the State of the World's Cities reports were actually being computed. \u201cMany UN agencies deliberately exaggerate the scale of a problem or disseminate statistics that are not based on any scientific survey or research,\u201d she wrote in the book. Many also \u201cmanufacture data,\u201d she added, \u201cbecause that is how they remain relevant, how they push their agenda on the international stage, and how they attract donor [taxpayer] funding.\u201d \\nSometimes UN officials and other international bureaucracies make up numbers and lie to coerce governments into changing policies, she explained. The book cites a number of examples of cooked up numbers to justify bigger budgets, more power and prestige, and various policy prescriptions. Some of the alleged \u201cfamines\u201d in Somalia, for example, appear to have been concocted by UN bureaucrats by simply inventing or massaging statistics. Clueless journalists then parrot the invented UN numbers as part of a process that Warah referred to as the \u201cCNN effect.\u201d \\nWarah considers it a crime akin to plagiarism that should be severely punished. \u201cWhen a UN agency publishes inaccurate, misleading, or unscientific statistics, it is even more unforgivable because the world's governments (i.e. member states of the UN) rely on those statistics to determine their national policies, priorities, and programs,\u201d she continued, adding that \u201cmillions of people's lives can be affected by a single misleading or erroneous statistic.\u201d \\nIn particular, during her stint editing the UN world cities report, she was concerned about the \u201cGini coefficient\u201d numbers used for cities, which seek to measure income inequality. She tried to figure out how these were being arrived at. Unsurprisingly, her superiors at the UN office were not pleased with the curiosity and additional scrutiny, Warah explained. \\n\u201cMy questioning resulted in several acts of retaliation, including public humiliation at office meetings, threats of non-renewal of contract, intimidating questioning during an interview for a post I had applied for and petty revenges, like forcing me to share my office with visiting consultants, even though I had made it clear that as editor of this important report I needed privacy and silence to carry out my work,\u201d she explained in an e-mail. \u201cI left the organization soon after due to frustration and a sense that my supervisors were hell-bent on making my life miserable.\u201d \\nIn response to the retaliation, Warah filed an official complaint at the UN \u201cEthics Office,\u201d which is supposed to investigate claims and provide relief to whistleblowers. The office claimed that, \u201cwhile there probably was evidence of wrongdoing at UN-Habitat, they could not establish whether I had experienced any retaliation,\u201d Warah said, adding that determining whether retaliation took place is key to getting justice from the UN's internal systems. \\nThe book also contains a very informative introduction by Beatrice Edwards, the international program director at the whistleblower advocacy group Government Accountability Project. Despite her general acceptance of the UN line regarding why it was founded and its alleged humanitarian purposes, Edwards highlights a number of extremely serious issues. Among those is the fact that UN personnel enjoy immunity from national and local laws, leading to a total lack of accountability that produces lawlessness and impunity. She also blasts the UN's supposed \u201cinternal system of justice\u201d as subject to manipulation, calling its set-up \u201cincreasingly opaque and arbitrary.\u201d \\nAnd indeed, as the book shows, the UN's pseudo-justice system is almost tragically discredited, and totally undeserving of the term \u201cjustice.\u201d According to the book, only between three percent and four percent of whistleblowers who sought assistance from the UN \u201cEthics Office\u201d had the retaliation against them substantiated by the \u201cEthics\u201d people. That means a stunning 96 percent or more of whistleblowers who reported being persecuted for blowing the whistle at the UN received no relief. \\nImagine being a UN worker who has observed criminality, and thinking about those odds. Of course, most people would simply choose to stay silent rather than jeopardize their career and livelihood for such meager odds. And so, with potential whistleblowers terrorized into submission, the widespread corruption, criminality and other horrors that plague the UN go unreported. The UN knows that, too, as it acknowledges in its reports about the drastic under-reporting of sexual exploitation and abuse of women and children by its scandal-plagued \u201cpeace\u201d troops. \\nWhen Warah tried to blow the whistle and seek relief, she witnessed the failures firsthand. \u201cSince the Ethics Office could not determine retaliation, I could not take my case forward,\u201d she explained. \u201cLater I realized that the Ethics Office fails to prove retaliation in about 98 per cent of the whistleblower cases it receives, which suggests that it protects senior UN management rather than UN whistleblowers.\u201d Numerous UN whistleblowers who have spoken to this magazine in recent years have made the exact same charge, and the UN has done little to dispel that notion. \\n\u201cThe UN's culture of impunity ensures that those who do not rock the boat with uncomfortable truths get promoted while those who dare to speak out are castigated, ignored, demoted or fired,\u201d wrote Warah in the book. \u201cThis is especially true in cases where the perpetrators of crimes are from powerful or influential countries that exert political pressure to ensure that their nationals' cases are not brought forward or are buried.\u201d Think about the implications of that. \\nIn the case of Danish UN diplomat Paul Bang-Jensen, who blew the whistle on the deliberate sabotage of a UN probe into Soviet atrocities in Hungary, and tried to protect the identity of witnesses to protect them and their families from torture and murder, the saga ended with his suspicious \u201csuicide.\u201d His death came after he had told his wife and others not to believe any claims that he would commit suicide. The New American magazine will publish an in-depth story on Bang-Jensen in the coming weeks. \\nThere is so much more to learn from the UNsilenced book. For instance, Warah describes how international \u201caid\u201d outfits bring in huge quantities of tax-funded food supplies right around harvest time, flooding the market with basically \u201cfree\u201d food in huge quantities. This crushes prices, thereby destroying the incentive for locals to farm while perpetuating dependence on corrupt agencies funded by Western taxpayers, in addition to ensuring budget increases for global bureaucrats. \\nAnother interesting fact brought out in the book: The British government's tax-funded propaganda arm, the BBC, has an unwritten policy that prevents the \u201cnews\u201d agency from \u201ccoming down too hard\u201d on the UN or its senior bureaucrats. The reason, according to an unnamed BBC journalist cited by Warah, is that exposing UN wrongdoing and crime might be perceived as \u201canti-development.\u201d Other self-styled media organs refuse to expose UN wrongdoing because the left-wing journalists fear being associated with right-of-center individuals who want to shut down the UN, Warah, herself a left-winger, acknowledges in UNsilenced . \\nSome of the ideas proposed in the book to remedy the many problems include reforming the UN's internal justice system, setting up outside independent mechanisms, ensuring protection of whistleblowers, and more. Unfortunately, though, none of those recommendations get to the heart of the problem, which is that the dictator-dominated UN was flawed from the start and cannot be \u201creformed\u201d enough to make it worth keeping. Surely protection for whistleblowers is needed \u2014 if only to ferret out criminals and bring them to justice, and to protect their victims, often children. But it will not solve the broader UN problem. \\nIf there is anything to quibble about with the book, it is that it accepts as true many of the fundamental (and false) premises upon which the UN was established \u2014 the idea that \u201cworld peace\u201d was the goal of leading UN founders such as butcher Joseph Stalin of Moscow and Soviet spy Alger Hiss of the United States, for instance. The book also occasionally treats leftist ideological claims \u2014 the idea that governments are responsible for feeding people, as just one example \u2014 as if they were facts. The ideological lens through which Warah reports, though, is easy to discern, and does not interfere with, or take away from, the excellent and brave work she has done exposing this cesspool of corruption and crime. \\nThe book is well worth reading for anybody seeking information on UN corruption or the persecution of UN whistleblowers who try to do the right thing. For the sake of humanity and liberty, it needs to stop. Photos: Rasna Warah and her book UNsilenced \\nAlex Newman, a foreign correspondent for The New American , is normally based in Europe.
