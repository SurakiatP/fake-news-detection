Dana Bash: Is your DC hotel opening free advertising?Donald Trump: \u201cNo, not at all\u201d https://t.co/6OZtrfIwim https://t.co/9HHqooom8r \\n\u2014 CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 26, 2016 \\n\u201cSo to people who say you\u2019re taking time out of swing states to go do this, you say?\u201d Bash asked. \\n\u201cI say the following: You have been covering me for the last \u2014 long time. I did yesterday eight stops and three major speeches, and I\u2019ve been doing this for weeks straight,\u201d Trump responded. \\n\u201cFor you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because Hillary Clinton does one stop and then she goes home and sleeps. And yet you\u2019ll ask me that question. I think that\u2019s a very rude question, to be honest with you.\u201d Trump exclaimed. \\nTrump added that the opening of the hotel also served to prove a point that he can get things built under budget and ahead of schedule, suggesting that the country needs to be able to follow suit. \\nWhile CNN has continuously run defense for Hillary Clinton amid a myriad of scandals, and even rigged its own polls to suggest she won the debates, the network has been forced to admit that Hillary is running an extremely light campaign schedule. \\nLast month, for example, Hillary went six days without an event except for a short speech she gave in Orlando, Florida. \\nAnd in August, Hillary took seven of the first 14 days of the month off and even went four days without a single campaign appearance. \\n\u201cHer speeches are so short \u2013 they don\u2019t last long, they\u2019re like 10 minutes and \u2018let\u2019s get out of here,\u2019\u201d Donald Trump said about her schedule. \u201cGo back home and go to sleep.\u201d NEWSLETTER SIGN UP Get the latest breaking news & specials from Alex Jones and the Infowars Crew.
