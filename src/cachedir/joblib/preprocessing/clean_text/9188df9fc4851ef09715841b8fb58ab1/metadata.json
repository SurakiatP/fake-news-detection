[Warren explained her rationale for attending the event on Real Time with Bill Maher as she promoted her new book This Fight is Our Fight.  \u201cI went to Trump\u2019s inauguration. I watched. I wanted to see it. I wanted it burned in my eyes,\u201d Warren told Maher. \u201cMy view on this was if there was ever going to be a moment where I was like, \u2018Oh I\u2019m too tired to get up,\u2019 all I had to do is close my eyes and it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh god, I\u2019m up. I\u2019m ready. I\u2019m back in the fight,\u2019\u201d she continued. Warren said it was that event that inspired her to keep up the fight against Trump\u2019s policies. The book This Fight is Our Fight ends with the Women\u2019s Marches that took place the weekend after the inauguration, which Warren said was the day \u201cthe world changed. \u201d That was \u201cthe day we made our voices heard,\u201d she said. The progressive firebrand has been one of Trump\u2019s fiercest critics, giving the president an \u201cF\u201d for his first 100 days for not living up to his promises to help the working class.'"}, "time": 1742562191.9729822}
