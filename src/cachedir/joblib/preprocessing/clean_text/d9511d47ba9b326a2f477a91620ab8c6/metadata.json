Trump\u2019s address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday evening shattered records on social media in terms of engagement with the American public. [On Twitter, for instance, a whopping three million people Tweeted about President Trump\u2019s address \u2014  a record that even former President Barack Obama\u2019s team could not hit. The previous record, under Obama, was 2. 6 million Tweets, according to Twitter per an Associated Press report. Facebook had millions of people engaged as well, a spokesman told Breitbart News. \u201c7. 5 million people on Facebook generated 20. 5 million likes, posts, comments and shares about President Trump\u2019s address to Congress,\u201d Facebook\u2019s Andy Stone said in an email.  None of this surprises Scavino. He said in an emailed statement: President Trump loves communicating with the American people. I was not surprised to see him not break, but shatter the record of most Tweeted Joint Session or State of the Union address ever. Pundits and \u2018experts\u2019 have underestimated President Trump\u2019s social media platforms from day one \u2014  the President\u2019s numbers have outperformed those of Fortune 100 companies since all the way back when we began in the primaries. History in the making for social media has just begun. What\u2019s more, the highly inaccurate network CNN \u2014  which the president has called a \u201cvery fake news\u201d outlet, is attacking President Trump by literally running a countdown clock since the president has criticized someone on his Twitter account. How long has it been since Donald Trump attacked someone on Twitter? https:  .  pic. twitter.   \u2014   CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) March 1, 2017,  CNN is one of the leading \u201cfake news\u201d outlets in the country, and a leader in what the president calls the \u201copposition party\u201d which is an \u201cenemy of the American people. \u201d FAKE NEWS media knowingly doesn\u2019t tell the truth. A great danger to our country. The failing @nytimes has become a joke. Likewise @CNN. Sad!  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 25, 2017,  The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017,  CNN is so bad, in fact, that the administration will not provide Vice President Mike Pence for an interview on the network \u2014  even though the Trump White House is making the vice president available for an interview on other networks. \u201dTrivial fights\u201d should be \u201dbehind us,\u201d but hours later WH offers @VP Pence interviews to every major US TV broadcaster except @CNN https:  .   \u2014   Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) March 1, 2017,  But none of this from CNN will get President Trump down, Scavino says. If anything, the president plans to expand on his success on social media and continue doing what works. \u201cThe President has no plans of changing a thing on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram,\u201d Scavino told Breitbart News. \u201cIn fact we will expand with some other platforms in the near future \u2014  as we begin to build out a great team. We are only just getting started. \u201d President Trump has been a giant on social media platforms, and during the campaign \u2014  Scavino previously detailed for a Breitbart News exclusive back in November \u2014  he generated tens of billions of impressions on various social media networks. Scavino has, after overseeing the president\u2019s social media team during the campaign, taken over as the White House\u2019s director of social media. It\u2019s worth noting too that these   performances during Trump\u2019s speech come with just a   social media team in the White House, much smaller than former President Obama\u2019s   team.'"}, "time": 1742561838.8667252}
