Whereas unlawful aliens traditionally sought to evade border agents in hopes of reaching U.S. cities where they could illegally fill American jobs, reports document how many of these new migrants are now turning themselves in to border patrol agents believing they\u2019ll be allowed to stay permanently. This 2016 influx of migrants from Central America had exceeded 117,000 by Oct. 1, marking a new record, Breitbart News reported . \\n\\nMany additional thousands of illegal aliens continue to pour across the border via smuggling routes that try to bypass the border patrol. In the 12 months up to October 2016, 271,000 illegal immigrants were caught trying to sneak across the border\u2014but many others escaped arrest and made their way to U.S. workplaces and cities. \\n\\nICE is the agency responsible for enforcing federal immigration law by identifying and removing illegal aliens within the interior of the nation, as well as removing aliens apprehended at the border by border patrol. After an alien is apprehended by border patrol, the alien is then turned over to ICE, which processes and detains the alien. \\nAlthough the surge has been largely ignored by corporate media and unacknowledged by the administration, \u201cthe public\u2019s safe is in jeopardy,\u201d the agent warned. Migrants with histories of prior criminal offenses, plus \u201cwould-be perpetrators or terrorists whose intent is to harm Americans or our country as a whole\u201d could be among those being released from ICE\u2019s custody, the agent said. \\n\\nThe officer said he believes the reason corporate media refuse to cover the crisis is because \u201cit\u2019s an election year and [the media] have a politically-driven agenda. I don\u2019t know why else it wouldn\u2019t be covered\u2014this is the worst we\u2019ve ever seen it,\u201d the agent said: \\n\\nThis is a crisis situation that is not being acknowledged by the administration or the media. I know we had a crisis situation in 2014, but this has this by far surpassed that. Our officers are overworked and overrun. We have had to move several officers from our interior enforcement programs in order to address and assist the officers who have to process all of the illegal border crossers and who are getting hammered by the crisis we\u2019re facing down here. \\n\\n\u201cThe safety of the American public is at risk,\u201d the officer warned. \\n\\nWould-be perpetrators have much more of a chance to make it through the system and into our communities. That\u2019s a huge concern for us. I don\u2019t understand why the administration and the media are not recognizing this as a crisis because that\u2019s what it is. By removing officers from enforcement programs, the threat to the American public has increased exponentially\u2026 However many officers we move from enforcement programs to help address this crisis means that there are that many fewer people trying to find criminal aliens, and that poses a threat to public safety. It\u2019s infringing upon our efforts to keep the American public safe. \\n\\n\u201cIn my book, if we miss one criminal alien who goes not to victimize one American citizen, that\u2019s one too many,\u201d the agent said. \u201cBut with the scale we\u2019re talking about here, it\u2019s likely lots of criminal aliens will to be able to slip through the system. So many Americans could potentially be affected by this.\u201d \\n\\nHowever, the agent\u2019s view does not seem to be shared by many lawmakers. For instance, both Tim Kaine and Hillary Clinton have shunned the American victims of illegal alien crime. Similarly, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan, who last year voted to grant federal funding to Sanctuary Cities, literally fled from grieving mothers, who were forced to bury their children as a result of open borders, as they sought to give him a letter begging him to enforce the nation\u2019s immigration laws. \\n\\n\u201cThere are lots of aliens we should be removing, but we can\u2019t do it because we\u2019re handcuffed by policies,\u201d the agent explained. \u201cThe surge is worse than it was in 2014. Our southern border is not secure. It\u2019s so porous. We have people working seven days a week just meet the demand and workload that\u2019s being created by this administration\u2019s policies.\u201d \\n\\n\u201cThe administration\u2019s policies have created the influx and the crisis situation because people overrun our border knowing they have a chance to stay,\u201d the officer said. \u201cThe workload, the number of people, we\u2019ve had to deal with has by far surpassed any amount we\u2019ve ever had to handle before. \\n\\n\u201cThe Office of Refugee Resettlement is at capacity. The continued influx is going to put us way over capacity,\u201d the officer explained. \u201cOnce they\u2019re processed, we have to either find placement for them or release them, and right now we don\u2019t have any place to put them\u2026 If we have nowhere to house them, they\u2019re going to be released into the public\u2014hundreds of bodies will be released.\u201d \\n\\nThe officer continued: \\n\\nIn just the past two days alone we\u2019re talking in the neighborhood of 200 bodies or more that we need to either find placement for or that will be released from our custody. This figure doesn\u2019t include all of the other people that we have yet to process\u2014at ports of entry they have close to 500 aliens to process who have yet to come into our custody. I\u2019m hearing that they\u2019re even pulling border patrol agents to assist them because they don\u2019t have enough to keep up with processing all of the aliens. \\n\\n\u201cAnd mind you,\u201d the officer added, \u201cthat figure is just the number of people that come over as a family unit\u2014this doesn\u2019t include the unaccompanied children or illegal adults who cross the border.\u201d \\n\\nThis is significant because Hillary Clinton has pledged to \u201cend family detention and close private immigrant detention centers.\u201d \\n\\n\u201cHillary believes we should end family detention for parents and children who arrive at our border in desperate situations. We have alternatives to detention for those who pose no flight or public safety risk, such as supervised release,\u201d reads Clinton\u2019s campaign website. \\n\\nThe agent described such a proposal as \u201cridiculous\u201d and dangerous\u2014as her plan could enable criminal aliens to enter the country and victimize innocent Americans. \u201cIf we think we have a mass migration problem now, and she\u2019s trying to propose something like that, it\u2019s only going to further overrun our borders and our officers,\u201d the agent said. \\n\\n\u201cDoes she propose we just release them?\u201d the agent asked. \u201cIt sounds like she wants to create just another avenue for criminal aliens to re-enter the country and commit more crimes, and victimize more people while they\u2019re here\u2026 Her proposal seems pretty far-fetched and seems to lack any knowledge of what the real issues are\u2026 There have been many instances where the men that we\u2019re processing, who arrive with their family unit, have some criminal offenses in their history\u2014is she proposing that we not investigate that?\u201d \\n\\nIn September, the National ICE Council, which represents the nation\u2019s roughly 5,000 frontline ICE officers, agents, and personnel endorsed Donald Trump over Clinton and \u201curged all Americans, especially the millions of lawful immigrants living within our country, to support Donald J. Trump, and to protect American jobs, wages and lives.\u201d The endorsement marked the ICE Council\u2019s first-ever endorsement of any candidate for any elected office. \\n\\nIn a statement announcing the endorsement, the council\u2019s president warned against Clinton\u2019s \u201cradical plan\u201d of \u201ctotal amnesty plus open borders\u201d that \u201cwould result in the loss of innocent American lives, mass victimization and death for many attempting to immigrate to the United States, the total gutting of interior enforcement, the handcuffing of ICE officers, and uncontrollable flood of illegal immigrants across U.S. borders.\u201d The ICE Council president warned that the agenda of non-enforcement, favored by Clinton, \u201cresults in the daily loss of life.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742628559.8355405}
