[\u201cI see no sign that there\u2019s any likelihood that he\u2019ll be impeached,\u201d Podesta, who recently joined the Washington Post as a columnist, told the publication\u2019s Karen Tumulty. Issuing an indirect testament to the loyalty of the GOP, Podesta added:  The Republican leadership has decided we\u2019re in the boat with him, and the boat\u2019s gonna sink, and we\u2019re gonna sink with it. But we can\u2019t really throw him out of the boat. So they\u2019ve decided to, as I\u2019ve said before, velcro their fate to him. I think they must be waking up in a sweat at night thinking about what the prospects of that are, but I think there\u2019s no chance that the House would mount the kind of serious investigation that would lead to impeachment. Rep. Maxine Waters ( ) has been openly leading calls for the president to be impeached. Several Democrats have invoked the 25th Amendment as a springboard to introduce legislation that would allow former presidents and vice presidents to determine if Trump is mentally unfit for office. Addressing Tumulty\u2019s question on the 25th Amendment, Podesta said, \u201cDo you really think Mike Pence and Betsy DeVos are going to sign that paper relieving the president of his duty? I don\u2019t see that either. \u201d In an interview with Breitbart News, Los   cardiologist and internist Dr. Afshine Emrani said he thinks it is wrong for people, and especially politicians, to \u201cbelittle mental illness because they have a political agenda,\u201d adding, \u201cpsychiatric   and bullying is against their professional code. They should be exposed for what they are. I can guarantee an overwhelming majority of them voted against Trump. \u201d Adelle Nazarian is a politics and national security reporter for Breitbart News.
