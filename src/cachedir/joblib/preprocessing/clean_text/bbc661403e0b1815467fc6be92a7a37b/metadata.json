In an interview with Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity, WikLeaks founder Julian Assange doubled down on a claim he had made last month on Hannity\u2019s radio show, which was the Russian government nor any state party of Russia were the source of hacks that exposed thousands of confidential Democratic Party emails.  \u201cWe can say  \u2014   we have said repeatedly over the last two months, our source is not the Russian government and it is not the state party,\u201d Assange said. Assange said the backlash over the hacked emails was nothing more than an effort to \u201cdelegitimize\u201d the incoming Trump administration. \u201cSo why such a dramatic response?\u201d he added. \u201cWell, the answer is obvious  \u2014   they\u2019re trying to delegitimize the Trump administration as it goes into the White House. They\u2019re going to try to say  \u2014   they are trying to say President Trump is not a legitimate president. \u201d Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor'"}, "time": 1742628486.2640543}
