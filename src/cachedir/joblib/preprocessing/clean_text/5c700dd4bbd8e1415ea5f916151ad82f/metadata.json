Here\u2019s what you need to know: \u2022 Electoral map shrinks for Sanders and Cruz. After Donald J. Trump\u2019s sweep of five primaries in Eastern states on Tuesday, and Hillary Clinton\u2019s victories in four of five, there are few chances for Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders to catch up in the delegate count. Here are our takeaways and what the candidates said after the results. Both   are looking ahead to the general election. Mr. Trump is giving a speech on foreign policy in Washington today, while Mrs. Clinton is sharpening her pitch for November. \u2022 On Capitol Hill. The Senate is near a deal for at least $1. 1 billion to fight the Zika virus, but the measure faces resistance from House Republicans. Despite lawmakers\u2019 bickering, Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, can point to some legislative victories, complete with Democratic support. \u2022 Sentencing for former House speaker. J. Dennis Hastert, 74, the   Republican House speaker in history, is expected to be sentenced today in federal court, after pleading guilty last year to a banking violation tied to accusations of sexual abuse. One of his accusers is suing him for $1. 8 million, the money he had been promised as compensation for the abuse. \u2022 Taking their lumps. Apple posted its first quarterly decline in revenue in 13 years, hurt by a drop in iPhone sales in China, the company\u2019s most important market after the U. S. The restaurant chain Chipotle had its first quarterly loss as a public company, and Exxon Mobil was stripped of its top credit rating for the first time since the Great Depression. \u2022 At the Supreme Court. The justices will consider an appeal today from Bob McDonnell, the former Virginia governor who was convicted of public corruption for trading political favors for gifts and loans. The case could produce a major ruling placing limits on bribery laws. In a    decision on Tuesday, they said it was unconstitutional to demote a police officer based on the mistaken assumption that he had engaged in political activity. \u2022 Iraq in turmoil. Iraq\u2019s Parliament has begun voting on a cabinet after protesters demanded government reforms and leaders untainted by corruption or sectarian connections. The political stalemate and the drop in prices of oil, the country\u2019s main source of revenue, aren\u2019t helping the effort to defeat Islamic State militants. \u2022 Police playbook gains a chapter. Police departments around the U. S. are turning to crisis intervention training in response to   shootings of people with mental illnesses.   percent or more of people fatally shot by the police have had a mental disorder. Separately, John R. Kasich often speaks about mental health on the campaign trail, and as his brother, Rick, has struggled with bipolar disorder. Rick Kasich gave us his first extended interview. \u2022  A Volkswagen executive\u2019s 2006 PowerPoint presentation laid out a strategy for rigging pollution tests. \u2022 Comcast is in talks to buy DreamWorks Animation, the boutique studio run by Jeffrey Katzenberg. \u2022 The founder of Chobani, a yogurt maker, surprised his 2, 000   employees with shares worth up to 10 percent of the company. \u2022 Here are snapshots of the U. S. and global markets. \u2022 Prince left no will, sister says. In newly filed court documents, the musician\u2019s sister says that he died without a spouse, children or surviving parents, and that he had no will. That will surely complicate his financial estate and musical legacy, which includes a trove of unreleased songs. \u2022 Gaining new insights. Runners now have an exact schedule that will predict how their performance will decline as they age. Police officers are using artworks in museums to sharpen their ability to notice details. \u2022 Scoreboard. The Toronto Raptors and Atlanta Hawks are each one win away from advancing in the N. B. A. playoffs after their victories on Tuesday night. There were no N. H. L. games, which meant hockey players could work on having a good night\u2019s sleep. \u2022 U. S. math scores decline. The average performance of the nation\u2019s high school seniors dropped in math from 2013 to 2015, but it held steady in reading, according to results of a test released today. \u2022 Recipes of the day. Make a big batch of   oatmeal and you\u2019ll have breakfast for days. Radish sandwiches are great for lunch or   hors d\u2019oeuvres. Or try this classic tuna sandwich. While some Americans may snicker at snooker, it\u2019s one of Britain\u2019s most popular games, with millions who play and who watch live coverage on the BBC, and it\u2019s growing in countries like China. The annual World Snooker Championship continues this week in Sheffield, England. The   winner Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan was eliminated on Tuesday. Like cricket, another British creation, it has complicated rules. Snooker uses a larger table, and narrower pockets than the older game of billiards. It\u2019s played with 15 red balls, a white cue ball and six balls of other colors. In short, once all 15 red balls have been pocketed, the colored balls  \u2014   each worth a different number of points  \u2014   must be sunk in a specific order. A \u201csnooker\u201d occurs when a player\u2019s cue ball gets boxed in and can\u2019t make contact with the ball he is next supposed to sink without fouling. The game was invented in 1875 by a British military officer stationed in India named Neville Chamberlain (no, not that Neville Chamberlain). At the time, the word snooker was a derisive term for a new cadet. The game is believed to have adopted the name because of the cadets\u2019 susceptibility to crafty play.
