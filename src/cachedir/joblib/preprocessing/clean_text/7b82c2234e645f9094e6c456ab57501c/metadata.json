Scott, a black man shot to death in 2015, and Michael T. Slager, the white police officer who killed him as he fled after a traffic stop. And the arguments they heard from lawyers were just as disparate as they pleaded with jurors to settle a bitterly divisive case in their favor: for the government, a rare conviction of a police officer, and for the defense, an acquittal of an officer seen on tape shooting a fleeing man. \u201cOur whole criminal justice system rides on the back of law enforcement,\u201d Scarlett A. Wilson, the chief prosecutor for Charleston County, told the jury of 11 white people and a black man. \u201cThey have to be held accountable when they mess up. It is very, very rare, but it does happen. \u201d But Mr. Slager\u2019s lawyer, Andrew J. Savage III, pressed jurors to resist \u201ca false narrative\u201d  \u2014   that the officer malevolently opened fire toward Mr. Scott\u2019s back on April 4, 2015, when he fled a traffic stop for a broken taillight  \u2014   and to find that Mr. Slager had acted in  . \u201cThis shooting didn\u2019t happen in a vacuum,\u201d Mr. Savage said. \u201cMr. Scott did not get shot because he had a broken taillight. Mr. Scott was shot because of what he did on April 4. \u201d Jurors, who began their deliberations on Wednesday evening, must reach a unanimous decision, and they have three options if they are to avoid a mistrial: a conviction for murder, a conviction for voluntary manslaughter or an acquittal. The difference between murder and manslaughter  \u2014   charges with vastly different potential penalties in this state  \u2014   revolves around whether someone had \u201cmalice\u201d toward the person who was killed. Under South Carolina law, a conviction for murder carries a prison term of 30 years to life the penalty for manslaughter is between two and 30 years in prison. Mr. Slager has also been charged in Federal District Court with violating Mr. Scott\u2019s civil rights. Like the federal case, the state\u2019s case, tried over four grueling weeks in a   courtroom here, turns on a matter of minutes on the Saturday before Easter last year, when Mr. Slager stopped Mr. Scott for an equipment violation. It was a stop, virtually everyone agrees, that began normally. But Mr. Scott soon decided to flee on foot  \u2014   his family and prosecutors believe he did so because of outstanding child support obligations  \u2014   and Mr. Slager chased him. The men became involved in a fight, and, according to Mr. Slager, who testified on Tuesday, Mr. Scott took control of the officer\u2019s Taser, leaving him in \u201ctotal fear. \u201d Near the end of their physical struggle, a   switched on his cellphone\u2019s camera and began to record a video of the moments that soon rocketed into the national consciousness: when Mr. Slager fired eight shots and Mr. Scott, wounded, collapsed to the ground. Mr. Scott was at least 17 feet from Mr. Slager, and running away, when the officer began to shoot. Mr. Savage, during a presentation when he argued that Mr. Slager had been maligned by the news media, failed by his department and victimized by a shoddy investigation, said Mr. Scott had left Mr. Slager with little choice after he \u201cmade decisions to attack a police officer. \u201d \u201cShould he have assumed that an unarmed man would have attacked a police officer?\u201d Mr. Savage said of Mr. Slager, who he complained had been made a \u201cposter boy\u201d of alleged police misconduct because of controversial killings in other parts of the country. Ms. Wilson unambiguously and furiously denied that other cases had affected the prosecution here, and she told jurors that there could not \u201clet your decision be based on things going on elsewhere. \u201d Rather, she contended, investigators had at first sided with Mr. Slager. \u201cThey bought everything he said hook, line and sinker,\u201d she said. \u201cThey believed him until they didn\u2019t, until they knew better. \u201d Winding down a criminal case that has drawn enormous attention here, Ms. Wilson accused Mr. Savage of relying on a    defense strategy she said was intended to confuse jurors and shift blame for Mr. Scott\u2019s death. The defense\u2019s approach, she argued, could be summarized simply: \u201cLook at everything else  \u2014   everybody else  \u2014   but don\u2019t look at that video. \u201d She said that Mr. Slager, who is now 35, had embellished the nature of his confrontation with Mr. Scott, who was 50. She characterized one of Mr. Slager\u2019s wounds, cited by his lawyers as evidence of a   struggle, as \u201ca glorified paper cut,\u201d and she hailed the role that video had played in the case. \u201cThank goodness we have a camera,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s not just memory that matters. \u201d Eventually, as Ms. Wilson neared the end of her argument, she played the video of the shooting again. As the eight shots echoed the courtroom one last time, Mr. Scott\u2019s parents, still in their seats, embraced, looking away from the killing.'"}, "time": 1742562254.3853874}
