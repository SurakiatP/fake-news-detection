At her N. F. L. news conference, she had promised a statement of \u201cinclusion,\u201d an upbeat and uncontroversial stance, and she made good on it as she began her set, singing a few lines each of \u201cGod Bless America\u201d and \u201cThis Land Is Your Land\u201d and reciting the \u201cone nation indivisible\u201d conclusion of the Pledge of Allegiance. Wearing a shiny, silvery,     bodysuit and matching   boots, with a glittery mask painted around her eyes, Lady Gaga was lowered through the air, on suspension cables, into NRG Stadium in Houston, showing off a   flip. And she started belting her hits, with a nod to the local audience: \u201cPoker Face\u201d announced, \u201cI want to hold \u2019em like they do in Texas. \u201d One of those hits was \u201cBorn This Way,\u201d her   anthem of   for all kinds of people. \u201cYou\u2019re black, white, beige, chola  \u2019re Lebanese, you\u2019re orient,\u201d she sang, and later, \u201cNo matter gay, straight, or   transgendered  \u2019m on the right track   was born to survive. \u201d It was doubtless the first time the word \u201ctransgendered\u201d had been sung at a Super Bowl halftime show. Dozens of dancers of multiple skin tones and genders joined her, matching her moves in exultant line dances and embodying her message of empowerment as a shared celebration. But most of the show was simply about   pop fun: songs like \u201cTelephone,\u201d about dancing at clubs, and \u201cBad Romance,\u201d about falling in love and lust. It was a megamix of her songs spanning her career, from her 2008 debut single, \u201cJust Dance,\u201d to \u201cMillion Reasons,\u201d the power ballad from her 2016 album, \u201cJoanne. \u201d She sang \u201cMillion Reasons\u201d from a piano as people waving orange electric torches made patterns that radiated across the football field that was her relatively still point in a fiercely athletic performance. \u201cThe Super Bowl is what champions are made of,\u201d she declared as \u201cBad Romance\u201d revved up. Lady Gaga has proudly presented herself as the continuation of generations of    showbiz troupers, a tradition of fervent effort and   spectacle delivered with joy. She sang with hardworking gusto throughout the set, even as she covered considerable yardage strutting and kicking, prancing and gesticulating, pumping her hips and shaking hands with fans. It was a show of shiny costumes and big smiles, of a huge group of dancers all sharing the same moves, an outpouring of energy that was eager to please everybody. Lady Gaga ended it with one last strut, up a ramp, and a   gesture that has been used by both rappers and an  : a microphone drop, earned with sweat.'"}, "time": 1742562204.4802558}
