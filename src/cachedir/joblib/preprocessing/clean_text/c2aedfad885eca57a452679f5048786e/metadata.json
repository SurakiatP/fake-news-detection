Thankfully, as millions have cast their ballots today, there\u2019s been no shortage of heartwarming stories involving Americans exercising their right to vote. One of those stories centers around lifelong Mississippi resident Helen Karnes, who, although not quite old enough to have been born before women won the right to vote, is still pretty goddam old. \\nWow. What a special woman! \\nWhile Karnes can\u2019t claim that she was alive during a time when women were still politically disenfranchised, it just takes one look at her to tell that she\u2019s fucking old. No, she might not have the inspiring, thematically satisfying story of a 100-year-old, but you get the sense that she\u2019s definitely lived through some shit. She was certainly around in WWII times, and she might\u2019ve even been there for the Depression, too. Who knows? This is no spring chicken we\u2019re talking about here. \\nThough, admittedly, Karnes\u2019 story would be a bit cooler if she\u2019d been alive before 1920, you still have to applaud her for being old on this historic Election Day. Also, her mom and her aunts were definitely alive before women\u2019s suffrage, so you know she\u2019s probably got some good secondhand stories that she heard from them. Maybe one of them was even an important figure in the women\u2019s rights movement or something. Statistically speaking, that\u2019s probably not the case, but you never know! \\nIt\u2019s unclear if Karnes voted today for America\u2019s first female presidential nominee, or if she even voted at all. But what matters is that she\u2019s brittle, stooped-over, and ancient. There are probably lots of dusty ol\u2018 bats out there who are older than Karnes and who have more of a substantial foothold in U.S. women\u2019s history, but this lady is still more or less a living skeleton. And that\u2019s something that should make us all proud to be Americans.'"}, "time": 1742628374.672796}
