Thanks!\u201d\\nThe DNC came up with a lengthy set of questions for CNN :\\n\u2013 Who helped you write the foreign policy speech you\u2019re giving tomorrow? Which advisors specifically did you talk to? What advice did they give you? Did they give you any advice that you chose not to take?\\n\u2013 CIA Director Brennan and former CIA Director Hayden have both said that our military and intelligence officers might refuse to follow some of your orders if you were president. What would you do if the military refused to listen to you? Should they be court-martialed if they refuse to follow orders?\\n\u2013 You\u2019ve said you look to Ambassador John Bolton for military advice and called him \u201cterrific,\u201d but he was one of the architects of the Iraq war. How do you explain your praise for Bolton if you also claim the war was a mistake? What advice have you taken from him?\\nYou can read the rest here , but there\u2019s a few other gems:\\n\u2013 Do you think American victims of 9/11 should be able to sue Saudi Arabia in court? What role, if any, do you think Saudi Arabia had in the 9/11 attacks?\\n\u2013 You\u2019ve said we should have bombed the \u201cright people\u201d after 9/11 and have suggested that the government has evidence Saudi Arabia was involved. Do you think we should have instead bombed Saudi Arabia?\\nThis is smoking gun, undeniable proof that CNN is in the tank for Hillary Clinton \u2013 and the rest of the mainstream media is no different.\\nIn fact, the Clinton campaign is acting as an assignment editor for the establishment media by telling reporters what to cover \u2013 and what to bury from public view that would otherwise hurt Hillary.\\nPrevious Wikileaks emails revealed that campaign staffers are directly working with mainstream \u201cjournalists\u201d to develop news stories favorable to the campaign \u2013 before they\u2019re published!\\n\u201cHuffington Post is doing a piece on our treasurer Jose Villareal \u2014 will likely focus at least partially on him sitting on the Walmart board,\u201d said campaign communications staffer Jesse Lehrich in a 2015 email , which reads like a reporter assignment list at a major newspaper. \u201cOther outstanding stories include: [Buzzfeed correspondent] Ruby Cramer on our grassroots organizing, Anita Kumar (McClatchy) on where we have organizers and how we\u2019ve spent our money during Q2, and [Washington Post reporter] Phil Rucker on HRC talking about gun violence prevention.\u201d\\nSource \\n'"}, "time": 1742562414.2688415}
