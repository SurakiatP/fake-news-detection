[Sources close to the film and rival studio executives told Variety that the film  \u2014   a passion project for Affleck, who wrote, produced, starred in and directed  \u2014  was shaping up to be a bona fide box office bomb for Warners after bad reviews and poor box office crippled the film\u2019s financial prospects.  According to Box Office Mojo, the film has grossed a paltry $10 million in the United States and another $6. 5 million in international receipts since its wide release on January 13, a disappointing result for a film that reportedly cost $65 million to produce, not counting the studio\u2019s marketing and distribution costs. The film couldn\u2019t crack the Top 10 in its opening weekend, opening to just $5. 1 million from 2, 822 theaters for a   average of $1, 809. Live By Night  \u2014   based on the novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane  \u2014   stars Affleck as   gangster Joe Coughlin, who spars with bootleggers and Ku Klux Klan members in 1920s Florida. The film also stars Elle Fanning, Sienna Miller, Brendan Gleeson, Chris Messina, Zoe Saldana and Chris Cooper. Variety reports that Warner Bros. is shielded from some part of its financial liability on the film through its partnership with   Entertainment. Live By Night was Affleck\u2019s directorial   to his 2012 smash hit Argo, which won the Best Picture Oscar. The   is next set to helm a standalone Batman film, tentatively titled The Batman. Affleck played the character in Warner Bros. Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice and will reprise the role in this year\u2019s Justice League.
