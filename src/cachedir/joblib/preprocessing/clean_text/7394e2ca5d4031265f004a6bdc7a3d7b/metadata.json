Y.  \u2014   When the leaves return to the trees outside David Rattray\u2019s office window at The East Hampton Star, it means only one thing: \u201cThe beginning of the mayhem. \u201d And on Thursday morning, with the leaves an adolescent green, Mr. Rattray, The Star\u2019s editor, gathered his staff in the paper\u2019s central newsroom to hash out their coverage plans for this summer\u2019s version of it, which would start in earnest over Memorial Day weekend. The Star newsroom is a tight space, with walls that have cracks from the day a couple of years ago when engineers showed up close to the paper\u2019s deadline to tilt the   house back onto a proper vertical, a vital fix for a building Mr. Rattray\u2019s family built in 1900. (The weekly paper still came out on time the newsroom staff just worked through the righting.) As Mr. Rattray ran through the story lineup for the next issue, the paper\u2019s editor at large, Irene Silverman, who has worked there since 1968, tracked a daddy longlegs\u2019 meandering path across her desk. First, there was the \u201cMemorial Day Mayhem \u201d when the town government\u2019s crackdown on wild partying in the township would be put to the test for the first time. Then there was a   battle royal playing out before zoning officials: Action on a new tennis court at the old Gardiner Estate was threatening to kill the om at the neighbor\u2019s meditation house. But what really caught Mr. Rattray\u2019s ear was word of $18 French fries at Duryea\u2019s, a beloved old lobster shack in Montauk that had just received a St.   makeover from its new owner, the billionaire investor Marc Rowan. \u201cI think there\u2019s an editorial about $18 fries  \u2014   about why, and for whom,\u201d Mr. Rattray said. Some member of the Rattray clan has been running this meeting for 81 years  \u2014   since the family bought the paper from the Boughtons, who bought it from its founder, George Burling, in 1890 for $100. The paper is still extra wide, like the original, and it has resisted the   appeal of shrinking down. But while in 1890 The Star served as a place to announce a local lad\u2019s marriage \u201cto the best girl in the country,\u201d it now covers fights over housing for immigrants the school curriculum and the tensions among the superwealthy, the somewhat wealthy and the     who work for them. And somewhere along the way it picked up a logo under its masthead: \u201cShines for All. \u201d An alternative might be, \u201cIt Endures. \u201d Through the advent of the movie house, the radio, the television, glossy new magazines and now the Internet, The Star has continued to stand. And that\u2019s a   testament to the central role that     newspapers can still play  \u2014   even though, like its   brethren, it faces its worst, and possibly last, threat from the web. The Star, a paid weekly, is luckier than most in its class. Many big real estate brokers still view its great big print spreads as a good way to market their huge Hamptons properties. And Craigslist does not have enough of a presence here to kill off The Star\u2019s classified listings. Advertising has given The Star enough resources to start a new    glossy magazine, East, and enough juice to maintain the paper\u2019s mission, which is to \u201cask hard questions, not be afraid to make public officials angry,\u201d Mr. Rattray said. But new competitors like Curbed. com, owned by Vox Media, and Patch, not to mention Facebook, have exerted pressure. Circulation is down to a maximum of 12, 000 from 16, 000, though many tens of thousands more read it online. \u201cOur gross is about half of what it was at its peak\u201d in 2006, Mr. Rattray told me as we sat in the garden behind the Star headquarters on Thursday, with the first of the holiday traffic trickling by on Main Street. With a shrinking advertising base, Mr. Rattray, a fit 53, has had to pare his staff and take on some of the more menial duties himself: helping with obituaries, letters to the editor (which are published in full, in keeping with a longstanding Star policy) and even the community and government calendars. He still has to find time to write the editorials, the latest of which favored the town\u2019s moves against the \u201cexcesses of the summer bar and party scene\u201d  \u2014   the primary generator of mayhem. The scene has been stoked by what longtime residents see as an invasion of club promoters and developers with sensibilities that can seem more Manhattan than Montauk, a hamlet with a proud   fishing tradition. There were already signs of a public backlash after the town\u2019s strict enforcement of state and local codes pushed one popular  \u2014   and, in some quarters, infamous  \u2014   club, Cyril\u2019s Fish House, to shut down, and another, The Surf Lodge, to at least temporarily halt its concert lineup of big acts. But Mr. Rattray went ahead with his editorial anyway. \u201cWithout a   but fair   newspaper, the forces kind of arrayed against this place, the South Fork, would win,\u201d Mr. Rattray said. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s arrogant to think, but it\u2019s how I was raised. \u201d It\u2019s also how Mr. Rattray is raising his three children  \u2014   the oldest is 15  \u2014   who he hopes will succeed him. But most young people interested in media careers seem drawn not to newspapers but to where the growth and opportunity are: modern   with their use of Instagram and Facebook and their new ways of working more closely with advertisers and making them part of the editorial content. I got to see that firsthand when I visited the young crew running Whalebone Media, who in about a year have built their own    media company. With the stylishly beachy sensibility of its surfer millennial founders, Whalebone publishes a free glossy lifestyle magazine with a circulation of 20, 000, and it tells prospective advertisers that it drew more than two million views through social media in its first several months of operation. Whalebone\u2019s offices are sleek and new, with big windows facing Montauk Harbor. Its publisher, Eddie Berrang, and managing director, Bronson Lamb, began the company in conjunction with their friend Jesse James Joeckel\u2019s   clothing brand, Whalebone. Mr. Joeckel founded the Whalebone Creative label in 2010 after designing   and logos for local surf shops. They went door to door to get enough sponsorship to publish the first issue of Whalebone magazine. Their first major advertiser: Soul Cycle, which had taken over the old   Montauk movie theater where the ticket taker also worked the popcorn machine. When I referred to Whalebone as a publication, Mr. Berrang, 34, corrected me. \u201cThe word \u2018publication,\u2019 it\u2019s an antiquated term,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a dying medium. \u201d Whalebone has a robust web presence that will soon include a new retail site. The whole experience relies on what the company calls \u201csubmersive media\u201d: The Whalebone crew designs sponsors\u2019 ads to run seamlessly, and openly, in the editorial content, such that a gorgeous spread of old Montauk fishing photos in the latest issue of the magazine is prominently \u201cpresented by Chris Coleman with Saunders\u201d real estate. Their young readers are unfazed by that sort of integration, they say. That\u2019s good, because as traditional print advertising dwindles, media organizations everywhere have to come up with new ways to pay for their coverage. Yet newspapers like The Star can change only so much. Hard news missions preclude slow dancing with advertisers. With the more traditional model, Mr. Rattray says, \u201cI can only see out about 18 months. \u201d Regardless of what happens after that, this much is true now: The Star still shines for all after 131 years, it endures. Its new media cousins should be so fortunate.'"}, "time": 1742562587.9012234}
