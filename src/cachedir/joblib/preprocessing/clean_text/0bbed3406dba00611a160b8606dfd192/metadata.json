[\u201cI\u2019m somewhat surprised in terms of the level of interest that I\u2019ve seen from the press corps, one set of developments versus another set of developments,\u201d Spicer said during the White House press briefing on Monday.  Since President Donald Trump accused former President Obama\u2019s administration of spying on his campaign staff, journalists have demanded evidence to back up his claims. Spicer suggested that the media was approaching the issue with a double standard after Rice\u2019s activity was exposed. \u201cI\u2019m somewhat more from a media standpoint somewhat intrigued by the lack of interest that we\u2019ve seen in some of these public revelations and reporting that has gone in that direction that we\u2019ve seen in some of the other directions that we\u2019ve seen,\u201d he said. Spicer declined to comment about the new revelations, citing the ongoing investigation. \u201cThere\u2019s a troubling direction that some of this is going in, but we\u2019re going to let this review go on before we jump to it,\u201d he said. In the aftermath of the news, some reporters suggested that Rice was merely doing her job by unmasking Trump\u2019s National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. \u201cIf victim Flynn hadn\u2019t been \u2018unmasked\u2019  \u2014   would Trump had fired him? Would it be better to have \u2018masked\u2019 man Flynn running NSC?\u201d New York Times reporter Glenn Thrush asked on Twitter. \u201c\u2019Unmasking\u2019 sounds better than \u2018we picked a national security adviser who was on the payroll of 2 other countries. \u2019\u201d Trump has not reacted to questions about the revelations in the press and has not shared his opinion about the news on Twitter. Spicer said that the administration would not try to assign a motive to Rice\u2019s reported behavior, but wait to see the results of the investigation. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to start going down guessing the motives of something that is not assumed in fact yet,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742563646.1845307}
