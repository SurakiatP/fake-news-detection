S service members participating in the ongoing offensive to recapture the Iraqi city of Mosul from the Islamic State \u201chave come under fire,\u201d Col. John Dorrian, a spokesman for the U. S.  coalition, told Pentagon reporters. [\u201cThey have come under fire at different times, our forces that have been in Mosul and other places around Iraq,\u201d revealed Col. Dorrian.  \u201cWhat I would tell you, though, is that they are directed to try and be positioned where that is a rarity and unlikely to occur,\u201d he added. Without providing a specific figure, an unnamed U. S. defense official told some news outlets that American forces taking part in the Mosul operation had suffered injuries. U. S. troops have been providing advice and assistance to an alliance of tens of thousands of Iraqi security forces, Kurdish Peshmerga troops, and   Shiite militiamen fighting to push the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and ISIL, out of Mosul. The day after the Mosul offensive began in   Peter Cook,   secretary for the Pentagon, conceded that U. S. troops participating in the operation would be in \u201charm\u2019s way. \u201d \u201cSome [U. S. troops] will be closer to the front than others  \u2026     but it\u2019s Iraqis in the lead  \u2026     Americans are in harm\u2019s way as part of this fight  \u2026     They\u2019re playing a support role  \u2026     but they are behind the forward line of troops,\u201d Cook told reporters. \u201cU. S. forces remain in a position to be able to provide advice to them,\u201d he added. \u201cA small number will be in a position to provide that advice on the ground. \u201d The U. S.  Iraqi forces and their allies have liberated eastern Mosul. On Sunday, the Iraqi alliance began its mission to retake the western side of the city, considered one of ISIS\u2019s last major strongholds in the country. Since 2014, ISIS has held Mosul, Iraq\u2019s   city. An estimated 2, 000 jihadists are believed to be still fighting to keep Mosul under ISIS\u2019s control. The U. S.  Iraqi forces and their allies have recently recaptured Mosul\u2019s airport.'"}, "time": 1742561642.809266}
