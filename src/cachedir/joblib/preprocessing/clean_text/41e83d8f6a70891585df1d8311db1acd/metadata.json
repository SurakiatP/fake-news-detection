Plus, here are our fact checks and email exchanges with William Weld, the Libertarian   nominee. The second presidential debate between Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton began with explosive attacks and ended with a measure of graciousness, as the two candidates complimented each other at the request of an audience member. Mrs. Clinton said she admired the Trump children, while Mr. Trump called his opponent \u201ca fighter. \u201d But the candidates savaged each other on the way to the finish, with Mr. Trump struggling mightily for much of the evening to address questions about his finances, policy ideas and treatment of women. In several tense exchanges, Mr. Trump acknowledged that he had avoided paying federal income taxes for years, called his taped description of sexual assault \u201clocker  \u201d and accused Mrs. Clinton of victimizing women and carrying \u201chate in her heart. \u201d He also said that as president he would appoint a special prosecutor to pursue Mrs. Clinton. In a comparatively subdued performance, Mrs. Clinton hewed close to the basic arguments of her campaign: That she is an experienced public servant and Mr. Trump is unfit to be president. Mr. Trump, she said, \u201cowes our country an apology. \u201d \u2022 An audience member asked the candidates to name one positive quality in their opponent. Mrs. Clinton jumped in first. \u201cI respect his children,\u201d she said. \u201cHis children are incredibly able and devoted and I think that says a lot about Donald. I don\u2019t agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but I do respect that. \u201d Mr. Trump, expressing gratitude for the compliment, offered his own. \u201cI will say this about Hillary: She doesn\u2019t quit,\u201d he said. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t give up. I respect that. \u201d The debate ended, and the pair shook hands. \u2022 Pressed on the 2005 recording which he seemed to boast of sexually assaulting women, Mr. Trump said he was \u201cnot proud of\u201d the behavior, saying that he had apologized to his family and the American people. But he disputed that the recording amounted to bragging about sexual assault, calling his comments \u201clocker room talk. \u201d \u201cI have great respect for women,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody has more respect for women than I do,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI was embarrassed by it. \u201d \u2022 Mrs. Clinton, responding to Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks about the recording, said that while she disagreed with past Republican nominees, \u201cI never questioned their fitness to serve. \u201d \u201cDonald Trump is different,\u201d she said. She suggested that, despite Mr. Trump\u2019s insistence that the recording did not reflect his character, \u201cIt\u2019s clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is. \u201d \u2022 Mr. Trump turned the discussion of his lewd remarks on Mr. Clinton, arguing that his \u201cwords\u201d did not compare to Mr. Clinton\u2019s history with women. \u201cIf you look at Bill Clinton, far worse,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Mrs. Clinton did not address the attacks on her husband. \u201cHe gets to run his campaign any way he chooses,\u201d she said. She paraphrased Michelle Obama\u2019s speech at the Democratic convention to describe her approach: \u201cWhen they go low, you go high. \u201d \u2022 Addressing Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump said that if he wins, \u201cI am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation,\u201d citing her use of a private email server as secretary of state. Mrs. Clinton pointedly said she could not spend all of her time   Mr. Trump, advising viewers to go to her website to see his falsehoods. She said it was a good thing that Mr. Trump was not in charge of the laws in the country. \u201cBecause you\u2019d be in jail,\u201d Mr. Trump shot back. Cheers could be heard from the crowd. \u2022 Mrs. Clinton said Mr. Trump was plainly trying to divert attention from his own campaign  \u2014   \u201cthe way it\u2019s exploding and the way Republicans are leaving you. \u201d Mr. Trump asked a moderator, Mr. Cooper, why he had not spent more time discussing Mrs. Clinton\u2019s private email server. (The other moderator, Martha Raddatz, had in fact brought it up moments earlier.) Mr. Trump was unmoved. \u201cNice, one on three,\u201d he said, suggesting the moderators were teaming up on him. \u2022 Asked about how to stop Islamophobia, Mr. Trump said, \u201cYou\u2019re right about Islamophobia and that\u2019s a shame. \u201d But he pivoted immediately to a discussion of what he called \u201cradical Islamic terrorists,\u201d citing the mass shooting in Orlando, Fla. and the attacks on the World Trade Center, among other atrocities. Mrs. Clinton suggested Mr. Trump\u2019s statements throughout the campaign had been destructive. \u201cWe are not at war with Islam,\u201d she said. \u201cIt plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are. \u201d \u2022 Pushed repeatedly to answer whether his proposed ban on Muslim immigration still stood, Mr. Trump deflected, saying his plans amounted to \u201cextreme vetting\u201d and accusing a moderator, Ms. Raddatz, of favoring Mrs. Clinton. Mrs. Clinton said it was \u201cimportant for us, as a policy\u201d not to ban people based on religion. \u201cHow do you do that?\u201d she asked. \u201cWe are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty. \u201d \u2022 After Mr. Trump said again that he opposed the war in Iraq, despite past public statements that contradict him, Mrs. Clinton reiterated that \u201cwe have it on tape\u201d that Mr. Trump had not been against the war before it began. \u201cIt\u2019s not been debunked,\u201d he insisted, turning the issue back on Mrs. Clinton. \u201cYou voted for it and you shouldn\u2019t have. \u201d \u2022 A black audience member asked if the candidates could serve as president for \u201call Americans. \u201d Mr. Trump said that he could, before moving quickly to a standard of his stump speech: wondering aloud what some voters \u201chave to lose. \u201d \u201cIt can\u2019t get any worse,\u201d he said. After Mr. Trump again criticized Mrs. Clinton\u2019s Senate tenure, she noted that she won   by a wide margin. She added, \u201cIf you don\u2019t vote for me, I still want to be your president. \u201d \u2022 Mrs. Clinton was asked about a remark, leaked from a private speech, in which she seemed to stress the importance of keeping both a public and a private position on given issues as a political figure. She said she was following the example of Abraham Lincoln as he sought to convince lawmakers to ally with him. \u201cNow she\u2019s blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cHonest Abe never lied. \u201d \u2022 Mrs. Clinton cited the specter of Russian hackers seeking to influence the election with strategic leaks, which she suggested were intended to help Mr. Trump. \u201cBelieve me, they\u2019re not doing it to get me elected,\u201d she said. (She has spoken often of Mr. Trump\u2019s kind words for Vladimir V. Putin, Russia\u2019s president.) Mr. Trump claimed ignorance. \u201cMaybe there is no hacking,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI know nothing about Russia. \u201d \u2022 Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump tussled over taxes, touching on Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to avoid paying them given past losses. He was giving \u201czero for our vets, zero for our military,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is wrong. \u201d Asked directly if Mr. Trump had used a    loss in the   to avoid paying taxes, he replied, \u201cOf course I do. Of course I do. \u201d He accused Mrs. Clinton of not doing enough as a senator to reform the tax code. \u2022 Asked by an audience member about coarseness in the presidential race, Mrs. Clinton said it was \u201cvery important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we\u2019re good. \u201d She reminded the crowd of her campaign slogan, \u201cStronger Together. \u201d Mr. Trump, who before the debate appeared with women who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault, said he broadly agreed with Mrs. Clinton. \u201cI began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country,\u201d he said. \u2022 In response to a question on the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Trump called the program \u201ca disaster. \u201d \u201cYou know it, we all know it,\u201d he said. Mrs. Clinton was asked about recent remarks from her husband, in which he appeared to criticize Mr. Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement. \u201cHe clarified what he meant,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cIf we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we have an   system. \u201d \u2022 Asked about the humanitarian crisis in Syria, Mrs. Clinton called the situation \u201ccatastrophic,\u201d pivoting to criticize Russia and accusing the country\u2019s leadership again of favoring Mr. Trump for president. Asked the same question, Mr. Trump said Mrs. Clinton \u201ctalks tough against Russia, but our nuclear program has fallen way behind. \u201d When Ms. Raddatz, a moderator, brought up the remarks of Mr. Trump\u2019s running mate, Mike Pence, on Syria, Mr. Trump said, \u201cHe and I haven\u2019t spoken and I disagree. \u201d \u2022 Mr. Trump attacked Mrs. Clinton for saying that half of Trump supporters could be placed in a \u201cbasket of deplorables. \u201d \u201cBelieve me, she has tremendous hate in her heart,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Mr. Cooper asked Mr. Trump if he had the discipline to lead, citing a recent \u201cTwitter missive\u201d in which he advised followers, without evidence, to \u201ccheck out\u201d a sex tape featuring a former pageant winner whose weight he had insulted in the 1990s. Mr. Trump denied that he had mentioned a sex tape. He also defended his favored social media practice: \u201cTweeting happens to be a   form of communication,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not   of it. \u201d \u2022 Asked about the Supreme Court, Mrs. Clinton said she wanted \u201ca Supreme Court that will stick with Roe v. Wade and a women\u2019s right to choose. \u201d Mr. Trump said he hoped to find judges \u201cvery much in the mold of Justice Scalia,\u201d citing a list he has compiled of possible selections. \u2022 Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump took the stage without shaking hands.'"}, "time": 1742564155.6051784}
