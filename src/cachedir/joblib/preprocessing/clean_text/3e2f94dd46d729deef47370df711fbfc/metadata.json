[Officers, responding to message that a vehicle hit a tree, later learned that the allegedly drunk driver was state Representative Victoria Neave ( ).  Reportedly, she did not cooperate with law enforcement who arrived on scene. The arrest warrant described Neave, 36, as having a strong odor of alcohol, unsteady, and with bloodshot eyes and slurred speech, WFAA reported. Officers also documented the state lawmaker\u2019s behavior as uncooperative, refusing to perform field sobriety tests, and give breath or blood samples. According to police records, Neave repeatedly told officers in slurred speech: \u201cI love you and I will fight for you and I\u2019m invoking my Fifth Amendment rights. \u201d Officers booked her into the Dallas County Jail at 3:30 a. m. (CDT) on Wednesday where she remained, waiting to see a magistrate. However, on Wednesday, shortly before 2 p. m. Neave took to social media with a public Facebook apology. She stated: \u201cLast night, I disappointed my family, my constituents, and my supporters. I disappointed myself. I\u2019m deeply sorry. I\u2019m so grateful that no one was hurt. I will accept full responsibility for my actions and I will work to make this right. \u201d Ironically, Neave participated in a   event promoting safe driving on Sunday, June 4. The often outspoken freshman representative has maintained a highly visible profile during the state\u2019s 2017 legislative session. In April, she marched in Dallas against Texas sanctuary city legislation, Senate Bill 4, which Governor Abbott since signed into law. Breitbart Texas reported she tweeted: \u201cEleven years ago, I marched   family. This time, I march as a State Representative fighting   legislation at #txlege. \u201d A few weeks later, she led a hunger strike to oppose SB 4, asking other Democrat lawmakers and open border advocates to join her, as was reported by Breitbart Texas. She was also the organizer of the Dallas Women\u2019s March and Texas House Democratic Caucus recently named her \u201cFreshman of the Year. \u201d On Wednesday morning, Dallas County Democratic Party Chair Carol Donovan responded to the news of Neave\u2019s arrest by issuing a statement: We understand, and are thankful, that no other person was involved or injured in the accident. Nevertheless, we look forward to speaking with her regarding the facts of her case and to insure she is alright. We wish her the very best and pray for her swift recovery so that she can resume her strong representation of the citizens of House District 107. Neave\u2019s district encompasses East Dallas, Mesquite, and Garland. By trade, she is a lawyer with a practice in Dallas.
