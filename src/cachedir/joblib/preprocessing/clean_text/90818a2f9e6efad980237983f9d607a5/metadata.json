Throughout the evening, she repeatedly interrupted and shouted down AEI resident scholar Christina Hoff Sommers, who was the guest speaker at the event. \u201cAre you going to keep interrupting our speaker?\u201d asked Ciccotta after the professor repeatedly interrupted. \u201cHow many progressive professors are at Bucknell? I think it\u2019s like eighty percent. \u201d \u201cI could never conduct myself in the classroom the way you\u2019ve conducted yourself tonight,\u201d he continued. When asked for comment, Ciccotta added that, \u201cShe came to our event with the intention of making a scene. She had no genuine interest in respectfully engaging with our speaker. She set a poor example for the students in attendance. \u201d \u201cConsidering that the Bucknell classroom is a safe space for progressivism, it\u2019s disappointing that she felt so threatened by a   departure from the campus\u2019 political orthodoxy,\u201d he concluded.'"}, "time": 1742564365.4408152}
