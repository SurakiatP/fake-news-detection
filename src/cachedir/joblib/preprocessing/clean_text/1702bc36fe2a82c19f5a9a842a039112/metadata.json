[\u201cOn the \u2018fence\u2019 \u2014  it\u2019s not a fence. It\u2019s a wall. You just misreported it. We\u2019re going to build a wall,\u201d Trump said during a Wednesday press conference at Trump Tower in New York City.  \u201cI could wait about a year and a half until we finish our negotiations with Mexico, which will start immediately after we get into office. But I don\u2019t want to wait. Mike Pence is leading an effort to get final approvals through various agencies and through Congress for the wall to begin. \u201d \u201cI don\u2019t feel like waiting a year or year and a half. We\u2019re going to start building,\u201d Trump added. \u201cMexico, in some form, and there are many different forms, will reimburse us. And they will reimburse us for the cost of the wall,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat will happen, whether it\u2019s a tax or whether it\u2019s a payment. Probably less likely that it\u2019s a payment. But it will happen. \u201d \u201cSo remember this: I would say, \u2018We\u2019re going to build a wall.\u2019 And people would go crazy. And then I would say, \u2018Who\u2019s going to pay for the wall?\u2019 And people would all scream out \u2014  25, 000, 30, 000 people \u2019cause nobody has ever had crowds like Trump has had, you know that. You don\u2019t like to report that  \u2026     But I said, \u2018Who\u2019s going to pay for that wall?\u2019 And they will scream out: \u2018Mexico,\u2019\u201d Trump said. \u201cI want to get the wall started,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to wait about a year and a half until I make my deal with Mexico. \u201d The government of Mexico is \u201cterrific,\u201d Trump said, adding he doesn\u2019t \u201cblame them for taking advantage of the United States. I wish our politicians were so smart. Mexico has taken advantage of the United States. \u201d Last April, Trump issued a memo explaining to Mexico he would tax remittances flowing out of the U. S. economy \u2014  or the Mexican government could issue a   payment of up to $10 billion for the wall. \u201cMexico has taken advantage of us in another way as well: gangs, drug traffickers, and cartels have freely exploited our open borders and committed vast numbers of crimes inside the United States,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe United States has borne the extraordinary daily cost of this criminal activity, including the cost of trials and incarcerations. Not to mention the even greater human cost. \u201d \u201cWe have the moral high ground here and all the leverage,\u201d Trump said. Mexicans send roughly $20 billion in remittances back to Mexico every year, according to the World Bank, much of it from the U. S. American taxpayers are also forced to pay for the welfare and schooling of millions of Mexican citizens and their children while enduring the costs of crime (gang activity, drug trafficking) and stagnant wages that unchecked immigration brings while this money is taken out of the U. S. economy every year. After Trump\u2019s election, remittances from Mexicans soared to $2. 4 billion in a single month as immigrant workers and illegal aliens scrambled to send American cash back home. In December, Trump transition team officials also demanded Obama\u2019s Department of Homeland Security report on \u201call assets available for border wall and barrier construction,\u201d along with aerial surveillance, according to Reuters.'"}, "time": 1742561999.02209}
