As We the People of the United States prepare for the election of the 45th President of the republic, with each passing day our country is becoming increasingly more polarized, and tensions continue to build between opposing sides. As evidence of the rising tensions, one needs to look no further than some of biggest stories of this past week, stories that were shockingly underreported by a mainstream media just as corrupt and dishonest as those they cover. Arguably the three largest stories of the week have been the Chairman of the military\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff reminding U.S. troops of the oath they took as members of the United States military, and of their required commitment to the chain of command throughout this election season, a former member of Congress calling for an armed revolt if Hillary Clinton wins (alleging there is no way for her to \u201clegitimately\u201d win without massive fraud), and most recently, the last minute announcement by FBI director James Comey that the FBI has re-opened its investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s email scandal, at a time when people are literally inside voting booths casting their early ballots. One major national news story noticeably absent in the non-stop drip of mindless drivel coming from pundits in the mainstream media, is the very real threat of danger due to violence as a result of whoever the eventual election winner turns out to be. Thankfully, on a more local level, various officials appear to be taking the threats posed by both sides more seriously, and several states have now announced that schools will be closed for the election, specifically citing their concern for students\u2019 safety from the potential for violence. In the video below, I explain why it\u2019s unconscionable that our alleged \u201cnews\u201d outlets would neglect to mention the fact that entire school districts are shutting down out of fear for student safety. We\u2019re not talking \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d here either. We\u2019re talking about actual police chiefs recognizing the danger being presented, various state officials recognizing the threats posed, the highest ranking member of our nation\u2019s military, and now various school districts all saying the same thing: Danger ahead! If you have children, you might want to look into whether your child\u2019s school district has decided to suspend classes yet. If they haven\u2019t, don\u2019t be surprised when they do. Michael Snyder Writes: Will this be the most chaotic election day in modern American history? All across the nation, schools are being closed on election day due to safety fears. Traditionally, schools have been very popular as voting locations because they can accommodate a lot of people, they usually have lots of parking, and everyone in the community knows where they are and can usually get to them fairly easily. But now there is a big movement to remove voting from schools or to shut schools down on election day so that children are not present when voting takes place. According to Fox News , \u201cvoting has been removed or classes have been canceled on Election Day at schools in Illinois, Maine, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and elsewhere.\u201d Just a couple days ago , I shared with you a survey that found that 51 percent of all Americans are concerned about violence happening on election day, and all of these schools closing is just another sign of how on edge much of the population is as we approach November 8th. Many officials are being very honest about the fact that schools are being shut down on election day because they are afraid of election violence. The following comes from Fox News \u2026 Several schools across the nation have decided to close on Election Day over fears of possible violence in the hallways stemming from the fallout from the heated rhetoric that consumed the campaign trail. The fear is the ugliness of the election season could escalate into confrontations and even violence in the school hallways, endangering students. \u201cIf anybody can sit there and say they don\u2019t think this is a contentious election, then they aren\u2019t paying much attention,\u201d Ed Tolan, the Falmouth, Maine police chief, said Tuesday. His community has already called off classes on Nov. 8 and an increased police presence will be felt around town. And without a doubt, voting locations are \u201csoft targets\u201d that often have little or no security. We have been blessed to have had such peaceful elections in the past, but we also need to realize that times have changed. I believe that there is wisdom in what Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp told reporters \u2026 \u201cThere is a concern, just like at a concert, sporting event or other public gathering that we didn\u2019t have 15 or 20 years ago,\u201d said Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, co-chairman of the National Association of Secretaries of State election committee. \u201c What if someone walks in a polling location with a backpack bomb or something? If that happens at a school, then that\u2019s certainly concerning.\u201d All it is going to take is a single incident to change everything. Let us hope that it is not this election day when we see something like that. Another reason why polling locations are under increased scrutiny this election season is because of concerns about election fraud. This is something that Donald Trump has alluded to repeatedly on the campaign trail. For instance, just consider what he told a rally in Pennsylvania \u2026 \u201cWe don\u2019t want to lose an election because you know what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d Trump told an overwhelmingly white crowd in Manheim, Pa., earlier this month. \u201cBecause you know what? That\u2019s a big, big problem, and nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody has the guts to talk about it. So go and watch these polling places .\u201d And of course reports are already pouring in from around the country of big problems with the voting machines. In Illinois this week, one candidate personally experienced a machine switching his votes from Republicans to Democrats\u2026 Early voting in Illinois got off to a rocky start Monday, as votes being cast for Republican candidates were transformed into votes for Democrats. Republican state representative candidate Jim Moynihan went to vote Monday at the Schaumburg Public Library. \u201cI tried to cast a vote for myself and instead it cast the vote for my opponent,\u201d Moynihan said. \u201cYou could imagine my surprise as the same thing happened with a number of races when I tried to vote for a Republican and the machine registered a vote for a Democrat.\u201d In addition, if you keep up with my work on The Economic Collapse Blog , then you already know that a number of voters down in Texas have reported that their votes were switched from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton . Well, it turns out that those voting machines appear to have a link to the Clinton Foundation \u2026 According to OpenSecrets, the company who provided the alleged glitching voting machines is a subsidiary of The McCarthy Group. The McCarthy group is a major donor to the Clinton Foundation \u2013 apparently donating 200,000 dollars in 2007 \u2013 when it was the largest owner of United States voting machines. Or perhaps the 200,000 dollars went to paying Bill Clinton for speeches? Either way, it doesn\u2019t look good. After everything that we saw in 2012 , I am convinced that there is good reason to be concerned about the integrity of our voting machines. But Democrats don\u2019t like poll observers, because they think that having too many poll observers will intimidate their voters\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s un-American, but at the same time we have a long history of doing things like that ,\u201d Ari Berman, author of the 2016 book \u201c Give Us the Ballot: The Modern Struggle for Voting Rights in America ,\u201d previously told The Christian Science Monitor. \u201cVoting was very, very dangerous. I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s suggesting that we\u2019re at the same place today. I just think the loss of the [official poll observers] is going to be really problematic.\u201d Without a doubt, this has been the craziest election season that we have seen in decades, and I have a feeling that it is about to get even crazier. But will the end result be the election of the most corrupt politician in the history of our country ? If that is the outcome after all that we have been through, it will be exceedingly depressing indeed.
