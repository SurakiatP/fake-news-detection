Certainly, Donald Trump is not portraying it as such. It\u2019s a little bit more of these disparate and discrete incidents that have happened, whether the Syria attack or this bomb. In fact, you just said it was a tactical move that the theater commander was able to make, not necessarily the large \u2014  part of a strategic framework here, and I think \u2014  the only thing that I could sort of ascertain in observing what Donald Trump is doing right now is that he\u2019s going mainstream \u2014  a little establishment, which is totally against the brand that he ran on. \u201d \u201cBut he \u2014  I think it shows the power \u2014  and when I say establishment, I don\u2019t mean just Republican establishment \u2014  Democrat \u2014  the Washington establishment \u2014  and it shows the power and the stranglehold that the establishment has,\u201d he continued. \u201cI know he tried to bust it up during the campaign and saying that he was going to be the irritant and destroy it, but when you don\u2019t have ideological moorings \u2014  you\u2019re not moored, that\u2019s guided, then I think you\u2019re susceptible to the power of the establishment and I think that\u2019s what we see playing out right now with Donald Trump. \u201d CNN chief political correspondent Dana Bash added, \u201cHe said the world has changed, and it hasn\u2019t. I mean, things change every day in the world, but the \u2014  but the overall sort of zeitgeist of where these hot spots are is where they were when he took office, so it wasn\u2019t that. It was him, and it is him, and \u2014  and to your point, David, it\u2019s that he\u2019s not a dogmatic guy. He never was. If he was a dogmatic guy, then he would have run for the Democratic nomination because he would still be   and for   health care system but he\u2019s not. He switched, you know, did a complete 180 on those issues and so it\u2019s not surprising that he is willing to \u2014  to use his words, be flexible when it comes to a whole host of issues, as he\u2019s learning a really, really hard, really new job that people who are even ideological and get the job tend to realize, you know, I need to switch a little bit. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742562889.9839947}
