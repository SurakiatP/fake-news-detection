A trade war bubbling up with Mexico. A divisive border wall. A ban on refugees from   countries. Brawls with the news media and national parks. \u201cI\u2019d give him an \u201d Ms. Cottrell, 38, said from her salon, Mane Attraction, on Main Street here in the seat of a conservative Ohio county of pastures and maple groves where Mr. Trump won 70 percent of the vote. \u201cHe\u2019s doing what he said he was going to be doing. \u201d So, about that   week. Mr. Trump drew a torrent of criticism after pressing a series of falsehoods about voter fraud, the size of the crowd at his inauguration and his attacks on the intelligence community. His   executive actions reversing years of policy on immigration, abortion and the environment left his critics seething and fearful and liberal opponents preparing a volley of legal challenges to blunt them. But in more than two dozen interviews this week, voters who helped hand Mr. Trump the presidency  \u2014     and reluctant supporters alike  \u2014   were cheering from their living rooms, offices and diners across America as they saw the outlines of a new conservative era in government fast taking shape, even if they were still a little uneasy about the man doing the shaping. Yes, they said, Mr. Trump should tone down his tweets and rein in what they gently called his impulse toward \u201cexaggeration. \u201d \u201cHonestly, he sometimes needs to shut up,\u201d said Joshua Wade, 24, of Ann Arbor, Mich. a state that had not supported a Republican for president since George Bush in 1988. \u201cJust do what we elected you to do. We won. Drop the inauguration stuff. It\u2019s fine. \u201d Gun rights top Mr. Wade\u2019s wish list for the new administration. He wants Supreme Court nominees friendly to gun owners and laws that extend   rights across state lines. He said he had been encouraged that Mr. Trump took swift action on some campaign promises during his early days in office. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt: He\u2019s good at showmanship,\u201d said Mr. Wade, a registered Republican. \u201cBut I think this first week is proving he\u2019s capable of following through on that with real action. \u201d But what appeals to supporters may be turning off independents. A Quinnipiac University poll released on Thursday gave Mr. Trump only a 36 percent job approval rating and found that majorities of people surveyed said he was neither honest nor levelheaded. Still, Trump voters interviewed said they cared little if the president spouted off on Twitter because he was issuing the kind of executive actions many had long craved  \u2014   freezing federal grant money for environmental research, banning foreign aid for groups that give abortion counseling and cutting off immigration from several   nations. \u201cTrump\u2019s done more in five days than Obama did in eight years,\u201d said Doug Cooperrider, 58, who works in construction repairing bridges and roads around central Ohio. The bar at Boondocks, where Mr. Cooperrider dug into a B. L. T. sandwich on a sleety morning, sits about 1, 900 miles from the Arizona deserts where sections of the   border wall may rise. The Hispanic population is tiny in this overwhelmingly white county of 35, 000, and it has grown only 0. 3 percent in the past five years. Still, people here said they felt as if immigration had undercut wages for construction workers in the area. One man said he was uneasy about the longstanding Somali community in Columbus, about an hour\u2019s drive south. Several embraced Mr. Trump\u2019s directives that limited new refugees, ordered up the border wall and cut off federal grant money to cities labeled sanctuaries for immigrants. \u201cI\u2019m 100 percent behind the wall,\u201d said Ms. Cottrell, the salon owner. \u201cIf he asked me to lay the first brick, I\u2019d sign up. I\u2019m tired of them being here illegally and cutthroating the rest of us. \u201d She and her husband, Andrew, a Navy veteran, said their views of government had been colored by years spent struggling to get a disability claim approved for him by the Department of Veterans Affairs. They were early and enthusiastic Trump supporters, and when they went on road trips this year, they gauged their candidate\u2019s support by counting up his yard signs and Hillary Clinton\u2019s. Mr. Cottrell, 34, said he supported aid to feed and shelter refugees  \u2014   but he blanched at welcoming them here. \u201cIt should be about America first,\u201d Mr. Cottrell said. \u201cWe see way too many vets waiting in line, homeless, while we\u2019re helping refugees and immigrants. \u201d Mr. Cottrell said he had wanted Mr. Trump to gut the   staff of the V. A. and was disappointed when he instead kept on an Obama administration official to oversee the agency. But he said that did not affect his support for Mr. Trump. \u201cI have never seen someone make promises and immediately start keeping them,\u201d he said. Most of those promises are a long way from fulfilled. The Affordable Care Act remains the law of the land. Efforts to build the Keystone XL pipeline or finish the Dakota Access pipeline could become mired in years of litigation. There is no agreement on how to pay for a $20 billion Mexican border wall. But moves like banning funding for overseas health providers who discuss abortion have a more rapid effect. Laura Alexandria, the director of operations for Grand Rapids Right to Life in Michigan, said she hoped to see the federal government soon remove financing for Planned Parenthood in the United States. \u201cWe have a   president back in the White House, and that is very encouraging,\u201d she said. Ms. Alexandria said she had been in Washington for the inauguration, and she was back there this week for Friday\u2019s March for Life by abortion opponents. She said her organization had organized 12 buses to take people from Michigan to the march. If President Obama was a   \u201cRorschach test\u201d for voters in 2008, Mr. Trump\u2019s actions calling for curbing regulations and repealing Obamacare were   sketches. He roughed them out, and his supporters filled in the details. Robert Kersey, 82, the president of an   foundry in Muncie, Ind. said he hoped Mr. Trump would pull back a recent announcement from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration addressing silica dust, which can lead to debilitating and fatal lung diseases. Mr. Kersey said he sees the rule as a burden and does not believe it will make his employees safer. Inside a gift shop in Mount Gilead\u2019s   downtown, Amanda Abdon, 28, said she was eager for a repeal of the health care tax penalty her boyfriend had to pay this year. Eddie Lou Meimer, 70, walking through her family farm south of town, said she wanted the federal government to ease the kind of   regulations that she said had forced her to build a $40, 000 canning room for her   business. \u201cHe\u2019s a    person,\u201d Ms. Meimer said of the president. \u201cI wish somebody would grab his phone. But it seems to take the press\u2019s mind off what he\u2019s really doing. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563186.3336253}
