Please scroll down for video \\nEveryone is familiar with the broadcast images of Neil Armstrong's historic first steps on the moon, and many believe his footsteps to be the first ever on the lunar surface. However, during a documented NASA symposium, Armstrong made comments alluding to the fact that not only had other species visited the moon, but that there were signs of colonization there upon. The Real Reason NASA Refuses a Return to the Moon \\nArmstrong stated in an interview with an unnamed professor at the symposium that their presence on the moon during the Apollo 11 mission was immediately noticed and addressed by an alien race. The beings that occupied the lunar air space made very clear their displeasure of the human's arrival on the moon's surface: \\nArmstrong: It was incredible \u2026 of course, we had always known there was a possibility \u2026 the fact is, we were warned off. There was never any questions then of a space station or a moon city. \\nProfessor: How do you mean \u201cwarned off\u201d?

But it really was a quick scoop and back again. (Above Top Secret, p. 186) \\nAdditionally, there are reports that upon arrival on the moon Armstrong witnessed structures on the surface resembling shops and other buildings obviously not designed by man. It is believed that while footage exists of these findings, the decision was made not to make these films public so as to not incite public panic. \\nNASA's unwillingness to move forward with lunar cities or even stations can easily be explained by the fear of going against the will of a much more advanced race. Armstrong stated that this fear is what lead to the following Apollo missions to only include a quick landing and sample collection. With this limited access to the moon, NASA or any other space exploration organization would be greatly hindered in their efforts to establish surface space stations of any type and lunar colonies would be completely infeasible. \\nCould it be that human's exploration of the cosmos is closely regulated by alien races? What lengths would those races go to prevent space travel advancement by humans? Perhaps in the future, humans will gain the favor of the celestial inhabitants and be privy to the mysteries of beyond. \\nThis article (Neil Armstrong: 'Their Ships Were Far Superior To Ours \u2013 Boy, Where They Big!') is free and open source.
