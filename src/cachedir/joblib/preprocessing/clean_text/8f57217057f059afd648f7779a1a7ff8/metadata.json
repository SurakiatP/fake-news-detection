However, the kid isn\u2019t so fond of his yearly celebration and finally became fed up with it, devising a plan not many would consider. In fact, he came up with a \u201cbirthday surprise\u201d for a local church, and onlookers spotted him doing the unexpected after he walked inside. Ryan Nelson \\nRyan Nelson, 13, had explained to his parents that he didn\u2019t want to celebrate his birthday. Although most kids would like to invite all of their friends, open gifts, and eat some birthday cake, Ryan didn\u2019t want to spend his special day that way. Instead of having a huge ordeal for himself, he devised a plan that not many people would ever consider. He was going to give a \u201cbirthday surprise\u201d to a church. \\nRyan decided to take the money his parents would have spent on a party, as well as all of his birthday money, and he donated it to a local church. \u201cHe also packed up and donated canned soups, ramen noodles and lots of clothes and blankets,\u201d according to WVLT . His donations will go to the M-14 Ministries\u2019 \u201cDry Bones\u201d shelter. \\n\u201cThe community, in my opinion, has given me so much,\u201d Ryan explained. \u201cSo I think this year, on my birthday, it\u2019s time to give back to the community.\u201d Ryan\u2019s donations \\nThe director of the shelter, Dwayne Linger, was overwhelmed by Ryan\u2019s generosity. \u201cI just hope that other kids see what he\u2019s done and follow his lead,\u201d Linger said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a great blessing, what he\u2019s done.\u201d Ryan admitted that he came up with the idea after he watched his mother donate to another church earlier this year. \\nIt\u2019s great to see that some of those in the younger generation can think about someone other than themselves. We need to ensure that our children realize how much of an impact their beliefs and actions will have on our country\u2019s future.'"}, "time": 1742563829.0660248}
