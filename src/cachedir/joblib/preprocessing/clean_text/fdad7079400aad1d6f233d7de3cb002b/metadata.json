The spokesman, David D. Coulson, said that sending additional personnel to the city, where there were more than 3, 500 shootings in 2016, has been \u201cin the works for some time to figure out how to leverage our resources. \u201d CNN reported that the bureau would send 20 additional agents. Mr. Coulson said he was unsure where that figure originated and that \u201ceverything is fluid. \u201d A final decision on the number of additional agents will most likely be made in the next week, he said. The field division, which covers Illinois and parts of Indiana, has more than 100 agents. About 35 are assigned to Chicago, Mr. Coulson said. The news comes as Chicago, the nation\u2019s third largest city, has been reeling from an increase in gun violence, a sharply critical Department of Justice report and a series of remarks and postings on Twitter about the city from President Trump. In a tweet on Jan. 24, Mr. Trump threatened to \u201csend in the Feds!\u201d if the city did not fix the \u201ccarnage. \u201d CNN reported that the agents would be assigned to a \u201cChicago Crime Guns Strike Force. \u201d Mr. Coulson described that as \u201cprobably a good depiction. \u201d He said that agents already assigned to the city work on firearms trafficking cases, cracking down on gangs and those who are prohibited from possessing guns. Adam Collins, a spokesman for Mayor Rahm Emanuel, said on Friday night that city officials had not been told about the plans for additional federal agents but that the mayor would be glad for their help. \u201cWe have received no word from the federal government to confirm these reports, but it would be welcome news if the administration has indeed agreed to one of Mayor Emanuel\u2019s requests for federal resources,\u201d Mr. Collins said. \u201cWe remain hopeful that they will also provide added D. E. A. and F. B. I. agents, that they will boost the prosecution rate for federal gun crimes in Chicago, and that they will provide funding for successful violence prevention efforts. \u201d More than 750 people were   murdered in Chicago in 2016, the police said, a 58 percent increase over 2015, and the highest total since 1997.'"}, "time": 1742563445.1991396}
