[As he wrote in the post, Gaffney stipulated that \u201chealth care is not my field, by any means,\u201d so he did not mean to criticize the substance of the   House bill.   \u201cI think what is of concern is that this was a doomed approach,\u201d he said. \u201cPaul Ryan, who is supposed to be helping President Trump get through his agenda in the House of Representatives and the congress more generally, should have known better. He either didn\u2019t, which justifies removal on the grounds of incompetence, or did  \u2014   in which case I think the argument is that he\u2019s simply not a reliable partner for the president in getting this agenda done. \u201d \u201cOn either grounds, I think that it would be necessary for the country, not just for the Trump presidency but for the country, to have leaders in both the House and the Senate who want to ensure that the president\u2019s projects, the president\u2019s agenda, the president\u2019s promises to the American people  \u2014   which I think were momentous, not just for health care reform but in so many other respects, including the return to the prospect of peace through strength, which if course is near and dear to my heart, and I think yours Raheem  \u2014   is going to be a necessary condition going forward,\u201d he argued.  \u201cFrom a layman\u2019s perspective, from a person who understands as a layman the importance of health care, this seemed to be a statist  \u2014   well, \u2018Obamacare Lite\u2019 it\u2019s been called  \u2014   approach, when a free market approach seems to be called for,\u201d Gaffney said. \u201cI think that\u2019s what Donald Trump set out to do. That\u2019s what he promised the voters. It\u2019s what I think you could get a majority of the Congress behind, if it is clear that in the process, you\u2019re not going to abandon people who genuinely need health care support. \u201d \u201cIt goes back to kind of the fatal flaws of Obamacare, and just making it a little better at the margins, which is I think, at best, what you could say Ryan was up to. It was clearly unsatisfactory and was, as I say, doomed to fail,\u201d he pronounced. Gaffney added compliments to Rep. Mark Meadows ( ) and the House Freedom Caucus for \u201censuring that it did fail. \u201d \u201cI think they\u2019ve done a great service, despite all the brickbats being thrown their way, for President Trump as well as for the country,\u201d he said. Gaffney conceded that choosing a possible replacement for Rep. Ryan as Speaker of the House was a difficult task. \u201cI think there are a number of people who could probably command the support of the majority of the House,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be for me to pick them. Some have been willing to serve in the past. Daniel Webster comes to mind, he seems to be a very presentable guy. It would be obviously up to him or others in the House to stand for this, if in fact Paul Ryan were to create a vacancy  \u2014   which I hope he will do. \u201d Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.
