Sanders also reiterated the necessity of preserving the environment, and pointed out the pipeline\u2019s potentially hazardous effect on the climate.\\n\u201cAccording to one report, burning the oil transported through the pipeline would produce carbon emissions equivalent to 21 million cars or 30 coal plants,\u201d Sanders wrote. \u201cIf we have any hope of avoiding the worst consequences of climate change, we should not be building new oil pipelines that lock us into burning fossil fuels for generations to come.\u201d\\nThe letter comes on the heels of state and local law enforcement, along with national guardsmen and private security forces brutalizing indigenous water protectors on Thursday. Videos widely circulated on social media showed law enforcement officers using pepper spray and LRAD sound cannons on Standing Rock protesters. Approximately 140 water protectors engaging in nonviolent civil disobedience were arrested by police in riot gear following the confrontation.\\nClick here to read Sanders\u2019 full letter.\\nRELATED BREAKING: The NEW Election FEC Violation That Should End Clinton\u2019s Campaign .
