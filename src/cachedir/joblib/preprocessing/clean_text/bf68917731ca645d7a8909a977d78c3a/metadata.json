Laboratory tests underway on airbags collected from recalled vehicles indicate that Takata airbags in certain   Honda and Acura vehicles had \u201cas high as a 50 percent chance of a dangerous airbag inflater rupture in a crash,\u201d the transportation secretary, Anthony Foxx, said in a bulletin. \u201cThese vehicles are unsafe and need to be repaired immediately,\u201d Mr. Foxx said. \u201cFolks should not drive these vehicles unless they are going straight to a dealer to have them repaired immediately, free of charge. \u201d The   vehicles are: \u25a0   Honda Civic\u25a0   Honda Accord\u25a0   Acura TL\u25a0 2002 Honda  \u25a0 2002 Honda Odyssey\u25a0 2003 Acura CL\u25a0 2003 Honda Pilot The bulletin adds new urgency to the effort to recall and replace defective Takata airbags, which have been linked to at least 14 deaths and more than 100 injuries. Problems with the propellant that inflates the airbag can cause a metal part to rupture when the bag is deployed in a crash, shooting metal fragments toward the car\u2019s driver or passengers. In one recent accident, a Texas teenager was killed when a fragment shot out of her airbag in a crash and severed an artery in her neck. She was driving a 2002 Honda Civic. The defect has prompted 14 automakers to recall more than 60 million vehicles in the United States, and millions more overseas. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Thursday repeated previous warnings that drivers in humid regions  \u2014   particularly Florida, Texas, other parts of the Gulf Coast and Southern California  \u2014   were at particular risk. High humidity, as well as high temperatures, causes a compound Takata uses to inflate its airbags to break down over time, and become more explosive. That puts older models at risk. More than 70 percent of the   vehicles, which were recalled between 2008 and 2011, have already been repaired, according to the agency, which has been testing bags that have been replaced. But about 313, 000 of those vehicles remain unrepaired, the agency said. Car owners can check whether a car has been recalled at SaferCar. gov, and those affected should contact the nearest dealer to schedule a repair, the agency said. Replacement parts are available immediately for the   vehicles, it said. Honda said on Thursday that it would more than double the size of its customer service staff to handle calls from car owners. It was also planning a targeted social media campaign to identify, and communicate with, owners of the   cars. Over all, Honda has mailed almost 18 million recall notices and sent almost six million emails to urge car owners to have their vehicles repaired, the automaker said. Senator Bill Nelson, a Democrat from Florida, demanded a more proactive approach. \u201cThese vehicles are death traps, and Takata and Honda have understated the risks for far too long,\u201d Mr. Nelson, ranking member of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cMerely telling people to come to dealers is not enough  \u2014   they need to go out and find these vehicles and get them off the road,\u201d Mr. Nelson said.'"}, "time": 1742563083.8870766}
