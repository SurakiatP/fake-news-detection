The TV execs and anchors went in there thinking they would be discussing the access they would get to the Trump administration By Tyler Durden - 11.22.2016 @1:27 PM EST \\nJust yesterday Trump called a summit of all the major mainstream media executives and anchors at Trump Tower. While many expected the meeting to be an oppotunity to ask questions of the president-elect, the media elites apparently got the surprise of their lives when Trump spent the majority of the meeting attacking they\u2019re blatant biased coverage the 2016 presidential elections referring to the room as a bunch of \u201cdishonest, deceitful liars.\u201d One participant in the meeting described it as a \u201c f\u2014ing firing squad \u201d after \u201c Trump started with Jeff Zucker and said \u201cI hate your network, everyone at CNN is a liar and you should be ashamed \u2026.\u201d We suspect that was rather less cordial than they expected. \\nDespite the conversation being completely off the record, many of the \u201cemotionally fucking pissed\u201d media anchors have decided to blow their embargoes and lash out at Trump. According to one source interviewed by the New Yorker , the meeting at Trump Tower was \u201cfucking outrageous.\u201d The same source also questioned how he could remain impartial after the meeting saying \u201c How can this not influence coverage?\u201d \u2026yes, because coverage was so impartial up until yesterday. Another participant at the meeting said that Trump\u2019s behavior was \u201ctotally inappropriate\u201d and \u201cfucking outrageous.\u201d The television people thought that they were being summoned to ask questions; Trump has not held a press conference since late July. Instead, they were subjected to a stream of insults and complaints\u2014and not everyone absorbed it with pleasure. \u201cI have to tell you, I am emotionally fucking pissed,\u201d another participant said. \u201cHow can this not influence coverage? I am being totally honest with you. Toward the end of the campaign, it got to a point where I thought that the coverage was all about [Trump\u2019s] flaws and problems. And that\u2019s legit. But, I thought, O.K., let\u2019s give them the benefit of the doubt. After the meeting today, though\u2014and I am being human with you here\u2014I think, Fuck him! I know I am being emotional about it. And I know I will get over it in a couple of days after Thanksgiving. But I really am offended. This was unprecedented. Outrageous!\u201d Participants said that Trump did not raise his voice, but that he went on steadily at the start of the meeting about how he had been treated poorly. \u201cIt was all so Trump,\u201d one said. \u201cHe is like this all the time. He\u2019ll freeze you out and then be nice and humble and sort of want you to like him.\u201d \u201cBut he truly doesn\u2019t seem to understand the First Amendment,\u201d the source continued. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t. He thinks we are supposed to say what he says and that\u2019s it.\u201d \\nAnd, as the eloquent Kellyanne Conway pointed out in her opening response last night on the Megyn Kelly show, negative reactions, like the one above, went a long way toward helping Trump win the presidency. \\nWhat are the chances that the mainstream media figures out before 2020 that by relentlessly attacking Trump they\u2019re actually helping him? \\n* * * \\nHere is our full coverage of the Trump \u201cmedia summit\u201d that was described by some as a \u201c f\u2014ing firing squad\u201d: \\nEarlier today we reported that in a \u201csummit\u201d organized by Trump\u2019s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, executives and anchors from the major US media outlets, including CNN president Jeff Zucker, ABC News president James Goldston, Fox News co-presidents Bill Shine and Jack Abernethy, and NBC News president Deborah Turness, visited Donald Trump at his Trump Tower penthouse for an off the record meeting. \\nCourtesy of the Post, we have a complete list of the participants at the Trump media meeting: the hour-long powwow included top execs from network and cable news channels. Among the attendees were NBC\u2019s Deborah Turness, Lester Holt and Chuck Todd, ABC\u2019s James Goldston, George Stephanopoulos, David Muir and Martha Raddatz, CBS\u2019 Norah O\u2019Donnell John Dickerson, Charlie Rose, Christopher Isham and Gayle King, Fox News\u2019 Bill Shine, Jack Abernethy, Jay Wallace, Suzanne Scott, MSNBC\u2019s Phil Griffin and CNN\u2019s Jeff Zucker and Erin Burnett. \\nThe contents of what was discussed were initially unclear. \\nNow, according to the Post and Politico , we learn that the President-elect \u201c exploded at media bigs in an off-the-record Trump Tower powow on Monday .\u201d \\n\u201c It was like a f\u2014ing firing squad ,\u201d one source told the Post. \\nAccording to the Post\u2019s recount of the conversation, \u201c Trump started with Jeff Zucker and said I hate your network, everyone at CNN is a liar and you should be ashamed \u2026.\u201d \\n\u201cThe meeting was a total disaster . The TV execs and anchors went in there thinking they would be discussing the access they would get to the Trump administration, but instead they got a Trump-style dressing down,\u201d the source added. A second source confirmed the encounter. \\nThe Post adds that \u201cthe meeting took place in a big board room and there were about 30 or 40 people, including the big news anchors from all the networks\u2026\u201d \\n\u201cTrump kept saying, \u2018 We\u2019re in a room of liars, the deceitful dishonest media who got it all wrong. He addressed everyone in the room calling the media dishonest, deceitful liars. He called out Jeff Zucker by name and said everyone at CNN was a liar, and CNN was network of liars . \\n\u201cTrump didn\u2019t say Katy Tur by name, but talked about an NBC female correspondent who got it wrong, then he referred to a horrible network correspondent who cried when Hillary lost who hosted a debate \u2013 which was Martha Raddatz who was also in the room. \\n\u201cGayle did not stand up, but asked some question, \u2018How do you propose we the media work with you?\u2019 Chuck Todd asked some pretty pointed questions. David Muir asked how are you going to cope living in DC while your family is in NYC? It was a horrible meeting.\u201d \\nPolitico adds further details, according to which \u201cTrump complained about photos of himself that NBC used that he found unflattering, the source said. Trump turned to NBC News President Deborah Turness at one point, the source said, and told her the network won\u2019t run a nice picture of him, instead choosing \u201cthis picture of me,\u201d as he made a face with a double chin. Turness replied that they had a \u201cvery nice\u201d picture of him on their website at the moment.\u201d \\nAmusingly, since the meeting was off the record, meaning the participants agreed not to talk about the substance of the conversations, it means they will most likely be unable to confirm or deny the Post\u2019s report. \\nPolitco\u2019s recollection of events was slightly less dramatic: The New York Post on Monday afternoon portrayed a much more heated meeting, including a quote from one source who said the encounter was \u201clike a f\u2013ing firing squad.\u201d The Post also said Trump called CNN journalists \u201cliars\u201d and that they should be \u201cashamed.\u201d The source who spoke with POLITICO characterized the meeting as less intense, and said the discussion included Trump expressing the possibility of a \u201creset\u201d of the tumultuous relationship between the president-elect and the media and that all he wants is \u201cfairness.\u201d Asked how he defines fairness by a network executive, Trump said simply, \u201cThe truth.\u201d But aside from the few moments of contention in the beginning, the source said the meeting was largely substantive. \\nPolitico also adds that Trump, flanked by chief of staff Reince Priebus and campaign manager Kellyanne Conway at the table, also expressed annoyance at the protective press pool and the complaints over him ditching the press when he went out to dinner last week with his family after reporters were advised he was in for the night. But Priebus assured the attendees that the protective press pool will be taken care of and it would all work out. \\nOther attendees at the meeting from Trump\u2019s team included chief strategist Stephen Bannon, Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner, spokesman Jason Miller, and Republican National Committee chief strategist and communications director Sean Spicer. Asked for comment, Miller referred POLITICO to Conway\u2019s comments to reporters after the meeting, in which she echoed the sentiments made in the meeting about turning over a new leaf with the media. \u201cThere was no need to mend fences,\u201d Conway said. \u201cIt was very cordial, very genial. But it was very candid and very honest. From my own perspective, it\u2019s great to hit the reset button.\u201d Conway later on Monday hit back at the New York Post report. \u201cHe did not explode in anger,\u201d she said. \\nWhile one can have a subjective interpretation of the nuances at the meeting, one thing was clear: Trump\u2019s attempt at a \u2018reset\u2019 will be frowned at by the media which is not used to this kind of treatment, even if the \u201ckinder, gentler\u201d version of events as reported by Politico is accurate. \\nIt also means that what has already been a conventional war between the various US media organizations and Trump, is likely about to go nuclear.'"}, "time": 1742563503.6968071}
