Speaking at a press conference at the Rossiya Segodnya news agency press center in Moscow, Evseev, the deputy director of Russia\u2019s CIS Institute, pointed out that Washington had only recently considered the possibility of attacking Syrian government forces, using the pretext of a UN report which alleged that Damascus had used chemical weapons. \\n\u201cWe recently lived through a very important milestone which many people did not even notice,\u201d the analyst suggested. \u201cWhy was the question raised of the Syrian Army\u2019s alleged use of chemical weapons? The stage was being set for [US] ship-based cruise missile strikes. According to some reports, such a decision was in play\u2026[Western] public opinion was actively being prepared for it.\u201d \\nAs Russian Ships Complete Passage to Med, Moscow is \u2018Surprised\u2019 by Western Buzz But the entry of a major Russian flotilla, led by the Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier, into the Mediterranean may been the essential element needed to cool the Pentagon\u2019s appetites, Evseev added. \\n\u201cThe presence of our ships [between Algeria and Italy] excludes the possible deployment of a similar NATO naval group in the area. Factually, our ships have closed Syria off. The Russian ships did not appear where they are by accident, and eliminated the possibility of launching cruise missiles from that direction.\u201d \\nThe analyst also recalled that earlier, S-300 systems \u201cwere deployed in Tartus\u201d with similar goals in mind, given that they are \u201ccapable of addressing not only air-based threats, but ballistic targets as well.\u201d Last week, the contents of a leaked report submitted to the UN Security Council blamed the Syrian government for a chemical attack in Idlib in 2015. Damascus vehemently denied the charges, citing the terrorists\u2019 own regular use of poison gas. \\nMoscow, meanwhile, stressed that more serious evidence would need to be presented before such serious accusations could be leveled. Why Does Media Cover Up War Crimes of \u2018Rebels\u2019 in Aleppo? The US and NATO allies, already engaged in a campaign to demonize Syria and Russia over the fight for Aleppo, used the report to pile on to other charges that Damascus and Moscow were responsible for \u2018war crimes\u2019 in their operation to liberate Syria from armed militants and jihadists. \\nCommenting on the military situation in Syria, Evseev suggested that together with the liberation of Aleppo, the Syrian military and their Russian allies must make it a priority to surround Nusra Front terrorists in Idlib. \u201cThe terrorists must be destroyed, but most likely a process of squeezing them out will take place,\u201d he admitted. If forced to leave Idlib, \u201cthe only place for them to go will be Turkey. And here, I would recommend that our Western partners, who currently advise us how to fight in Aleppo, take a moment to think about what will happen to the Idlib militants who end up in Turkey,\u201d the expert noted. \\n\u201cFrom here, it\u2019s likely that they can then be expected to pay a visit to Europe. This is what Western nations should be thinking about, instead of putting a spoke in the wheel and doing everything possible to interfere in the operation to liberate Aleppo and other Syrian territories.\u201d As far as the situation in the city of Aleppo is concerned, Evseev stressed that \u201cif we continue to wait and prolong humanitarian pauses, there will be no people left in Aleppo. Without air support, losses are too high. It\u2019s necessary to free the city quickly, and to think less about the West thinks about it.\u201d Related Posts: No Related Posts The views expressed herein are the views of the author exclusively and not necessarily the views of VT, VT authors, affiliates, advertisers, sponsors, partners, technicians, or the Veterans Today Network and its assigns.
