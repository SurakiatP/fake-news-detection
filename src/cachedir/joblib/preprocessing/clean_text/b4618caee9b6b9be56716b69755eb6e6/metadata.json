It\u2019s unknown if authorities have been alerted, but this display is the end result of months of extremist electioneering by the Trump and Republican Party, who have been hell-bent on dehumanizing   \\nAmerican politics never had a tradition of demanding the jailing of one\u2019s political opponent, nor to encouragement of supporters to engage in political violence, but that\u2019s today\u2019s Republican Party under Donald Trump. His campaign has broken America\u2019s political taboos with open calls for violence, even winding up under Secret Service investigation twice.
