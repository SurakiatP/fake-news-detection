It started in the late 1960s, when my mom asked me to watch \u201cThe Haunting\u201d with her when it played on network television. (My dad was working nights.) I was traumatized but hooked. Martin Scorsese cites the New York TV station WOR\u2019s \u201cMillion Dollar Movie\u201d as the site of his early film education mine was that station\u2019s \u201cChiller Theater\u201d (not to be confused with a similar program on WPIX). It would be a few years before I\u2019d see a horror movie  \u2014   \u201cNight of the Living Dead\u201d  \u2014   in an actual movie house. Things have come full circle in a sense. My favorite American contemporary horror director is Mike Flanagan, and I\u2019ve yet to see any of his movies in a theater. (His latest theatrical release, \u201cOuija: Origin of Evil,\u201d is one I need to catch up with.) His 2011 debut feature, \u201cAbsentia,\u201d is a tense, creepy tale about a woman who registers her husband\u2019s death seven years after his disappearance, only to have him turn up alive, and in very weird state. \u201cOculus,\u201d from 2014, about an evil mirror and the havoc it wreaks on a brother and sister during two distinct periods in their lives, is an ingenious atmospheric shocker with intimations of the 1944 classic \u201cThe Uninvited. \u201d This year\u2019s \u201cHush\u201d is a brisk     exercise, with its deaf heroine terrorized in her cabin in the woods by a sadistic killer. \u201cAbsentia\u201d and \u201cOculus\u201d I saw on Amazon \u201cHush\u201d had its premiere at the 2016 South by Southwest Film Festival, and went to Netflix directly thereafter. Mr. Flanagan just completed shooting a film set for Netflix in 2017, \u201cGerald\u2019s Game,\u201d an adaptation of Stephen King\u2019s very provocative 1992 novel, in which the battle of the sexes takes on a grotesquely Grand Guignol dimension. Mr. Flanagan is, like Mr. King, eclectic in his range: He can do supernatural and   horror with equal conviction. His movies contain violence, sometimes of the grisly kind, but he doesn\u2019t go for the constant semiautomatic,   sadism that distinguishes the \u201cSaw\u201d franchise and other movies. He also doesn\u2019t go for the arguably cheap \u201cjump scares\u201d that are a feature of many contemporary horror pictures. But it won\u2019t do to call him  . He\u2019s doing new things. The parallel editing of \u201cOculus,\u201d portraying his characters as young children and young adults in shifting flashbacks and   that become increasingly complex as the movie progresses, is innovative. In \u201cHush,\u201d the way he uses movie language to change perspectives  \u2014   from the deaf heroine to the hearing outside world  \u2014   is similarly inventive. (\u201cHush\u201d was written by Mr. Flanagan and his lead actress, Kate Siegel, who were married this year.) While he worked with celluloid only briefly while studying film at Towson University in Maryland, Mr. Flanagan said in a phone interview that whatever platform they\u2019re going to be viewed on, he wanted his movies to feel like   \u2026     movies. \u201cWith digital technology there\u2019s a huge spectrum of flexibility in what you can do to manipulate sound and image,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich you can push into a really artificial realm if you aren\u2019t careful. \u201d Mr. Flanagan, who is in his   mentioned \u201cJaws\u201d as a picture that showed him \u201cwhat cinema can do\u201d and also cited horror classics like \u201cThe Changeling,\u201d \u201cThe Exorcist\u201d and \u201cThe Shining\u201d as influences. He said the 1940s movies of the producer Val Lewton (\u201cCat People\u201d) gave him an appreciation of atmosphere. But without the advent of the digital age, Mr. Flanagan acknowledged, he \u201cmight not have a career. \u201d \u201cAbsentia\u201d was financed in part by the crowdfunding website Kickstarter. He admits that when he first envisioned a film career, he didn\u2019t see the internet as a congenial home for his work. When he was studying film, he attended a seminar about broadband at the International Film Festival of Manhattan, \u201cand it seemed insane that you\u2019d be able to watch a movie in high quality on the internet. I never imagined it as a viable outlet. \u201d But working with online production entities has been crucial for Mr. Flanagan. He was frustrated with the troubled movie studio Relativity earlier this year over its handling of his movie \u201cBefore I Wake,\u201d which he made in 2013. His experience with Netflix, which, he notes, \u201ccould release \u2018Gerald\u2019s Game\u2019 the day after I delivered it if they were so inclined,\u201d has been exhilarating. \u201cA movie studio has to answer to a marketing department, and to shareholders, to ensure the broadest audience possible for its product it tends to err on the side of caution as a result,\u201d he said. \u201cNetflix has an incredible bravery about things that just don\u2019t excite a studio anymore. You can feel the excitement they have about just getting a project into production. \u201c\u2018Gerald\u2019s Game,\u2019 we could not have made it at a studio without substantive changes to the story. Working in this way takes away a lot of the red tape that you\u2019d have to machete your way through in the studio system. \u201d Is there any downside? \u201cThe question is how long that attitude can survive the bigger the company becomes, but I haven\u2019t seen any signs of it flagging,\u201d Mr. Flanagan said. Netflix will probably release \u201cGerald\u2019s Game\u201d in the spring. Mr. Flanagan said the service may want to give it some festival exposure before offering it to subscribers.'"}, "time": 1742563602.8845572}
