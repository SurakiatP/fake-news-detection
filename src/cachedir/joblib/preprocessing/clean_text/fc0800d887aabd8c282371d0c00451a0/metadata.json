A killer seeks out a nightclub, a church, an airport, a courthouse, a protest. Someone is shot on video, sometimes by the police, and marchers fill the streets. An attack is carried out in France, America, Turkey, Bangladesh, Lebanon, Tunisia, Nigeria, and then claimed and celebrated by a radical terror group. Our phones vibrate with news alerts. The talking heads fill air over cable news captions that shout \u201cbreaking news\u201d in red. Rumors and misinformation abound. The comments erupt on Twitter, Facebook and news sites. Journalists create multimedia stories that focus on videos, photos and graphic accounts from victims and witnesses. The experts give interviews, and the latest tools of immediacy are put to use. After thedeadly terror attack in Nice, France, The Times invited grief counselors to be interviewed on Facebook Live. Within days, attention had turned to a shooting in Baton Rouge that left three law enforcement officers dead. So, what is this doing to us?  It depends on the individual, but living in a digitally linked world where broadcasts of violence are instantaneous and almost commonplace means that many of us are becoming desensitized, Anita   a psychologist in Washington, said Friday. \u201cWith the frequency of shootings and terror attacks there is a sense of anxiety that\u2019s building in people,\u201d she said, \u201ca sense of vulnerability and powerlessness. \u201d Dr. Smith added: \u201cThere is a heightened alarm, but there can also be some desensitization that\u2019s happening. \u201d The constant stream of news on social media can also be traumatic. A team of researchers at the University of Bradford in England told a British psychology conference last year that exposure to violent imagery on social media can cause symptoms that are similar to   stress disorder, defined as a persistent emotional reaction to a traumatic event that severely impairs one\u2019s life. In an analysis conducted by the Bradford researchers, 189 participants were shown images and provided with stories of violent events, including the Sept. 11 attacks, school shootings and suicide bombings. The researchers\u2019 analysis showed that 22 percent of those who participated were significantly affected by what they saw. The study also found that people who view violent events more often were more affected than people who saw them less frequently, and that people who described themselves as extroverts with outgoing personalities were at a higher risk to be disturbed by the images. What can we do about it?  The   advice hasn\u2019t changed. It is natural to want to follow along with incremental updates on social media and in the news. But it\u2019s important to know that this can heighten your anxiety. Anne Marie Albano, a clinical psychologist and the director of the Columbia University Clinic for Anxiety and Related Disorders, said in an interview after the 2015 Paris attacks that it might be a good idea to limit your exposure to social media. Designating times to plug into the news  \u2014   checking Twitter in the morning over coffee, but not listening to the radio while driving your kids to school, for instance  \u2014   can help you manage anxiety if you are feeling stressed. \u201cThis will help you balance a realistic and credible threat with information that is sensationalized,\u201d Dr. Albano said, \u201cor a rush to report something or talk about something that doesn\u2019t have the impact that you would think it has. \u201d If you\u2019re feeling anxiety about a possible attack, compare your fear with the facts.  When you fear the worst, it\u2019s hard to remember that, say, a flight or a train ride has extraordinarily high odds of being safe. But you have to try. Humans are bad at assessing risk, Martin Seif, a psychologist who specializes in treating anxiety disorders and the fear of flying, said in an interview late last year. \u201cEvery single   technique is based on the premise that your reaction is out of proportion\u201d to the likelihood of danger, Dr. Seif said. Also, remember to take a breath.  A guide to dealing with terrorism released by the Federal Bureau of Investigation encourages closing your eyes and taking deep breaths to feel calmer. Taking a walk or talking to a close friend can also help. The guide also recommends avoiding alcohol and drugs, exercising regularly and eating healthy foods  \u2014   basic   guidelines that help reduce stress. Make sure you have a plan to contact your family if something happens, especially if cellular networks are overloaded or transportation is disrupted, but remember that you most likely will not need it, experts say. If you have children, the American Psychological Association recommends asking them how they are feeling about the news. Keep in mind that it is possible for children to be influenced by news reports and the adult conversations around them. Lastly, keep your daily routine.  Dr. Albano said that a primary worry in the field of psychology is people \u201cgoing out of their way to be so safe that it shrinks their world. \u201d \u201cTerrorists thrive on this kind of thing,\u201d she added. \u201cThey want to see the population change their practices. \u201d Going out of your way to avoid interacting with strangers  \u2014   by refusing to take mass transit, for example  \u2014   can stoke fear and anxiety in children, she said. The best way to help children cope with acts of violence is to start by listening to them, Sean Rogers, a psychotherapist who works with children and teenagers, told The Times on his Facebook Live appearance. \u201dListening is curative,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the basis of all therapies. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563921.1843061}
