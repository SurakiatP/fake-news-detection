You don\u2019t think this is a scale of bias worthy of Pravda and Izvestia?\u201d Gingrich asked. \\n\u201cIf Trump is a sexual predator, that is \u2013\u201d Kelly began to interrupt. \\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a sexual predator,\u201d Gingrich exclaimed. \u201cYou can\u2019t say that, you could not defend that statement. I am sick and tired of people like you using language that is inflammatory that\u2019s not true!\u201d \\nKelly then interrupted again, demanding that Gingrich has no idea if it is true or not, and that she is not taking a position on the issue either way \u2014 despite the fact that she clearly has. \\n\u201cWhen you used those words you took a position,\u201d Gingrich asserted. \\nAfter Kelly reiterated the allegations against Trump, and the fact that he denies it. She demanded that the news needs to cover the allegations, whether they are true or not. \\n\u201cYou are fascinated with sex, and you don\u2019t care about public policy,\u201d Gingrich asserted, as Trump supporters nationwide jumped off their couches to give him a standing ovation. \\nKelly laughed his statement off, and declared that she is \u201cnot fascinated by sex,\u201d but is \u201cfascinated by the protection of women, and understanding what we are getting in the oval office.\u201d \\n\u201cDo you want to comment on whether the Clinton ticket has a relationship to a sexual predator,\u201d Gingrich replied calmly. He then repeatedly asked her to use the words, \u201cBill Clinton sexual predator,\u201d which Kelly refused to do \u2014 asserting that he is not on the ticket. \\nI was 35 years old when Bill Clinton, Ark. Attorney General raped me and Hillary tried to silence me. I am now 73\u2026.it never goes away.\\n\u2014 Juanita Broaddrick (@atensnut) January 6, 2016 \\n\\nAfter the show aired, Juanita Broaddrick, who has asserted and vividly described being raped by the candidate\u2019s husband, tweeted out that Kelly is \u201cugly as hell on the inside.\u201d \\nBeauty is only skin deep. Megyn Kelly is ugly as hell on the inside.\\n\u2014 Juanita Broaddrick (@atensnut) October 26, 2016 \\n\\nBroaddrick also accused Kelly of being biased, after someone tweeted out a reminder that both Kelly and Shep Smith have donated $70,000 each to Clinton\u2019s campaign. \\nYeah she's fair and balanced. Change your slogan FOX https://t.co/BnSNRcFdPr \\n\u2014 Juanita Broaddrick (@atensnut) October 26, 2016 \\n\\nPaula Jones , the former Arkansas state employee who sued President Bill Clinton for sexual harassment, and received a $850,000 settlement, also had harsh words for Kelly. \\n\u201cLets get this straight\u2026Megyn Kelly isn\u2019t for all women\u2026she hates Trump, so she\u2019s only for those so called victims! NEVER for me!\u201d Jones tweeted. \\nLets get this straight\u2026Megyn Kelly isn't for all women\u2026she hates Trump, so she's only for those so called victims! NEVER for me!\\n\u2014 PJGirlie (@ThePaulaJones) October 26, 2016 \\n\\nCheck out Broaddrick\u2019s heartbreaking interview with Breitbart News here:\\nThe post Bill Clinton\u2019s Victims Strike Back at Megyn Kelly appeared first on We Are Change .\\n\""}, "time": 1742564354.6789277}
