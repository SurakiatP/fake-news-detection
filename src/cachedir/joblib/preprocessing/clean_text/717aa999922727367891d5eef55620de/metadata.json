[Daniel Holloway of The Chicago Tribune, attacked Maher for giving MILO the opportunity to \u201crenew attacks on familiar targets,\u201d despite the fact that Maher repeatedly challenged MILO on the show.  Yiannopoulos continued by repeating his assertion that Jones, who has been a writer and cast member on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d for four seasons, is \u201cbarely literate. \u201d His claim went unchallenged by Maher. Neal Broverman of The Advocate argued that Maher \u201ccrossed the line\u201d by having MILO on the show, before criticizing the liberal commentators use of the word \u201cfag. \u201d If it wasn\u2019t bad enough that Bill Maher gave gay troll Milo Yiannopoulos a huge forum by featuring him on his HBO show, the straight TV host thought it appropriate to call him a \u201cfag\u201d during the interview.   \u2026     On top of Maher\u2019s disgusting choice of words, he introduced Yiannopoulos like he was a Hollywood celebrity joking and almost flirting with him like he was having George Clooney, Jennifer Lawrence, or some innocuous actor on his show. Hannah Gold of Jezebel was similarly outraged, claiming Maher is now a \u201cmonster\u201d for his decision to invite MILO on as a guest for Friday night\u2019s show. The thing about Maher is that \u2014  though he\u2019s made too many nasty jokes about minorities and women for me to ever enjoy him \u2014  he is usually pretty good at making fun of everyone. He didn\u2019t do that in his interview with Yiannopoulos. I\u2019m sure Maher of all people can appreciate the truth about how much that fucking sucked. Mary Papenfuss of The Huffington Post, falsely labeling MILO a \u201cwhite nationalist,\u201d criticized Maher for allegedly letting MILO off easy for what she regards as his controversial stances on several issues. The   appearance between Bill Maher and Milo Yiannopoulos on HBO\u2019s \u201cReal Time\u201d came off more like a mutual admiration society. At one point, the host even playfully referred to the white nationalist as an \u201cimpish, British fag. \u201d Black Lives Matter activist DeRay Mckesson slammed Maher, accusing him of helping to amplify MILO\u2019s \u201cbigotry,\u201d while also falsely associating the Dangerous Faggot with \u201cwhite supremacy. \u201d Bill Maher was complicit in amplifying bigotry in that Breitbart interview. He not only allowed it but left it unchecked.  \u2014   deray mckesson (@deray) February 18, 2017,  But the prize for hyperbolic outrage surely goes to Daily Kos blogger \u201cChitown Kev. \u201d \u201cThe gall of Bill Maher to compare Milo to the late, great Christopher Hitchens was stunningly unmitigated,\u201d wrote Kev. \u201cI mean, really? REALLY?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742562012.8126585}
