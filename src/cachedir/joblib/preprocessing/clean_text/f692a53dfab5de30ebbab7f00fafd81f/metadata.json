Change that crooked corrupt judges commandeered by rich business people cannot do. \\nOf course violence and looting is a terrible thing, but so is war, so is injustice, but these are necessary measures for survival, if nothing is done soon, Britain and its people will be no more. Already, we have been inundated, but if there is no Brexit, the numbers will increase tenfold, until the tiny island of Britain is nothing more than a holding prison, a junk filled morose, barren overpopulated garbage dump. \\nBritain fought two world wars and was on the winning side of both, this time, the Germans will take Britain without a single shot being fired, this is the central position of the EU. The European Union is an East German Soviet construct incorporating German Imperial fascist techniques to subjugate other nations through economic means. \\nBy bribing the corrupt judges who are linked to EU centric projects, the EU is seeking to halt Brexit. \\nNo More \\nAre you a fucking fool to take that? Are you going to stand by and let your nation be taken over? Or are you going to fucking stand up and fucking do something about it? \\nWe must do what is necessary. \\n\u201cIt is not enough that we do our best; sometimes we must do what is required .\u201d \u2015 Winston S. Churchill Share on :'"}, "time": 1742628519.785475}
