[In his general audience on Wednesday, the Pope said that when wealth, power, or physical beauty become idols, they \u201clead to death. \u201d  As an example, the Pope spoke of a woman he had known who was willing to \u201csacrifice everything\u201d for physical beauty. Years ago, Francis said, a woman who was very proud of how beautiful she was told him she had had an abortion, as though it were the most natural thing. \u201cYes, I had to get an abortion because my figure is very important,\u201d she told him. \u201cThese are idols, and they lead you down the wrong path, and do not make you happy,\u201d Francis said. Pope Francis has been a vocal critic of abortion, calling it a \u201chorrendous crime,\u201d similar to Mafia murders and the slaughter of the innocents by King Herod 2000 years ago. Reflecting on Psalm Psalm 115 and its depiction of the worship of false gods, Pope Francis remarked that today there are still many forms of idolatry that plague the world, and infect even people of faith when they allow themselves to become \u201cworldly. \u201d These idols include wealth, power, health and physical beauty, he said, as well as practices like consulting   and tarot card readers. \u201cThe message of the psalm is very clear,\u201d Francis said. \u201cIf you put your hope in idols, you become like them: empty images with hands that cannot touch, feet that cannot walk, mouths that cannot speak. \u201d When ideologies such as riches, power, or success, or values such as physical beauty and health become idols, he went on, they \u201cconfuse the mind and the heart, and instead of nurturing life, lead to death. \u201d \u201cThis is why the Sacred Scripture warns against false hopes that the world presents to us, exposing their uselessness and revealing their senselessness,\u201d he said. The Pope said that we often turn to idols when God seems too slow in answering our requests. We become frustrated, and so look elsewhere. \u201cSometimes we look for a God that can bend to our requests and magically take action to change reality and make it as we want,\u201d he said. But these idols are useless, \u201cpowerless and deceptive. \u201d And yet, he said, \u201cwe like idols, we like them very much. \u201d Many times, we can prefer to seek a fleeting hope that a false idol gives us, rather than the \u201cgreat and sure hope that the Lord gives to us,\u201d he said. The difference, Francis said, is that the one, true God is not an idol and therefore \u201cHe never disappoints. \u201d Follow Thomas D.
