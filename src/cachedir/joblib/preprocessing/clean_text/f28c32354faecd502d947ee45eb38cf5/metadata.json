The following tweet from Mr. Nikhil Wagle compounded his confusion further: Don\u2019t like @karanjohar films. But will watch #AeDilHaiMushkil to oppose hyper nationalism n hooliganism.l \\n\u2014 nikhil wagle (@waglenikhil) October 21, 2016 \\nThe aforementioned statement spoke volumes about his commitment to the, um, cause he was supporting but did not shed much light on Mr. Johar\u2019s filmmaking abilities. He realized he needed to wait for the movie release and read the reviews to decide which one to watch first. \\nOn Sunday morning, he recharged his internet data pack for a GB and looked up movie reviews on Google. He first opened NDTV\u2019s website where the reviewer Saibal Chatterjee gave Shivaay a 2 star rating, which was consistent with his usual ratings that range from 1.5 to 2.5. However, he was surprised to see a 4 star rating for ADHM. \\n\u2018How did this miracle happen? Does he have all the keys on his numeric keypad now or has someone at NDTV told him the rating should be done on a 5 point scale?\u2019 Mr. Gupta pondered. \\nHe placed ADHM higher on his priority list, although IMDb ratings of ADHM and Shivaay were 5.4 and 7.6 respectively. When he was about to close the browser, he noticed two contrasting reviews of ADHM on Indian Express. He quickly went through them and was relieved to see the reviews were done by two different individuals and it was not a case of split personality disorder. \\nBy the time he read the final review on the 10th page of Google, he started to lose faith in humanity, and hence decided to read audience reactions instead, only to find comments, such as \u2018boycott ADHM\u2019 and \u2018I love Anushka Sharma.\u2019 He read thousands of comments, which significantly improved his reading skills but did not help him arrive at a conclusion. While going through the comments, he received a notification from his internet service provider that he had zero balance left on his data pack. \\n\u2018Damn, I could\u2019ve watched both the movies online with 1 GB.\u2019 \\nHe had no choice but to watch the movies and find out himself. He went to the nearest theater and watched both the movies back to back. Later when he came back home, he wrote his own review titled \u2013 \u201cBoycott Ae Dil Hai Mushkil and Shivaay.\u2019'"}, "time": 1742562150.8567588}
