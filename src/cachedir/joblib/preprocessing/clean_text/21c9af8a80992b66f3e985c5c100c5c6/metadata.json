The jury\u2019s decision proved no less dramatic and sets up a showdown in the next stage of the land-rights movement.\\nThe Bundy brothers still face prosecution in Nevada with their father, Cliven Bundy, all accused in the 2014 standoff at the patriarch\u2019s ranch over unpaid grazing fees that pitted the family and their supporters against federal Bureau of Land Management agents.\\n'"}, "time": 1742563163.1708388}
