This is what we have to deal with these days and it makes me sick that this is what was on the side of my house.\u201d \\nMaria Daly called police to report someone had robbed her home while she was sleeping and then spray-painted her home with BLM for Black Lives Matter then posted about it on social media. \\nMillbury Police Chief Donald Desourcy told the Herald that Daly called police to report an early morning break-in October 17, claiming someone had made off with thousands of dollars worth of valuables and spray-painting \u201cBLM\u201d on the outside of her house. \\nBut Chief Desourcy stated that as the investigation unfolded, something didn\u2019t feel \u201cquite right\u201d and Daly ended up admitting she fabricated the whole thing, telling the officers her valuables had already been recovered. \\n\u201cIt was pretty obvious. The officers did their due diligence and followed through with the investigation that we had,\u201d he told CBS Boston . \u201cWe came to the conclusion it was all fabricated. There was no intruder, there was no burglary.\u201d \\nThe chief said the hoax was likely motivated by the couple\u2019s financial troubles and that he has empathy for the family. \\n\u201cI\u2019m very familiar with her and it\u2019s an unfortunate set of circumstances that have taken place.\u201d \\nDaly\u2019s neighbors said it wasn\u2019t a very smart thing to do for a woman who is married to a cop. \\n\u201cShe must have tagged the place herself,\u201d said one neighbor. \\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019d do that, if you\u2019re gonna stage a robbery, I mean really come on, you\u2019re a cop\u2019s wife. You should know better.\u201d \\nIn addition to charges for filing a false police report, Daly also faces a charge for misleading a police investigation. Her cases will be heard at Worcester District Court after she is summoned. \\nDaly\u2019s husband, Daniel Daly was not involved or charged in relation to the hoax, according to police.
