[Last week, Breitbart News extensively reported that Indivisible leaders are openly associated with groups financed by billionaire George Soros.  Politico earlier this month profiled Indivisible in an article titled, \u201cInside the protest movement that has Republicans reeling. \u201d  The news agency not only left out the Soros links, but failed to note that the organizations cited in its article as helping to amplify Indivisible\u2019s message are either financed directly by Soros or have close ties to groups funded by the billionaire, as Breitbart News documented. Organizing for Action (OFA) is a   community organizing project that sprung from Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign organization, Organizing for America, becoming a nonprofit described by the Washington Post as \u201cadvocate[ing] for the president\u2019s policies. \u201d In a recent Facebook post titled, \u201cTake a deep breath. Then take action,\u201d OFA called on constituents to lobby particularly hard between now and February 26, when lawmakers will be in their home districts. The post included a link to a guide released by Indivisible on how to organize against Trump. \u201cStay tuned for online trainings and invitations to calls with coalition partners like Indivisible Guide,\u201d the OFA post states. Paul Sperry, writing at the New York Post, relates: The manual, published with OFA partner \u201cIndivisible,\u201d advises protesters to go into halls quietly so as not to raise alarms, and \u201cgrab seats at the front of the room but do not all sit together. \u201d Rather, spread out in pairs to make it seem like the whole room opposes the Republican host\u2019s positions. \u201cThis will help reinforce the impression of broad consensus. \u201d It also urges them to ask \u201chostile\u201d questions  \u2014   while keeping \u201ca firm hold on the mic\u201d  \u2014   and loudly boo the the GOP politician if he isn\u2019t \u201cgiving you real answers. \u201d \u201cExpress your concern [to the event\u2019s hosts] they are giving a platform to   authoritarianism, racism, and corruption,\u201d it says.   \u2026    \u201cEven the safest [Republican] will be deeply alarmed by signs of organized opposition,\u201d the document states, \u201cbecause these actions create the impression that they\u2019re not connected to their district and not listening to their constituents. \u201d Sperry reported OFA \u201cplans to stage 400 rallies across 42 states this year to attack Trump and Republicans over ObamaCare\u2019s repeal. \u201d Earlier this month, NBC News reported on OFA\u2019s new actions and its partnership with Indivisible: OFA has hired 14 field organizers in states home to key senators as part of its campaign to defend Obama\u2019s signature healthcare law. To run that campaign, the group hired Saumya Narechania  \u2014   the former national field director at Enroll America, which worked to sign people up for Obamacare  \u2014   and a deputy campaign manager.   \u2026    OFA says more than 1, 800 people have applied to its Spring Community Engagement Fellowship, a   training program,   of whom have not previously been involved with OFA. And the group has teamed up with Indivisible, a buzzy newcomer to the progressive movement, to offer organizing training that began Thursday night with a video conference. A combined 25, 000 people have registered to participate in those trainings, OFA said. Indivisible\u2019s DC branch was implicated in a scuffle last week that reportedly injured a    staffer for Rep. Dana Rohrabacher ( ) as well as reportedly knocking a    to the ground.  Protesters claimed they were only delivering Valentine\u2019s Day cards. Indivisible is a part of a coalition of activist groups slated to hold a massive   Tax March in Washington and at least 60 other locations on April 15. Unreported by the news media is that most of the listed partners and support organizers of the march are openly financed by Soros or have close links to Soros financing, as Breitbart News documented last week. Meanwhile, earlier this month, Politico profiled Indivisible and reported that \u201cconservatives\u201d are \u201cspreading unfounded rumors\u201d that the group is \u201cbeing driven by wealthy donors like George Soros. \u201d Politico, however, seemingly failed to do even the most minimal research on the Indivisible leaders cited in the news outlet\u2019s own profile.  Some of those personalities are openly associated with groups financed by Soros. Politico further failed to note that the organizations cited in its article as helping to amplify Indivisible\u2019s message are either financed directly by Soros or have close ties to groups funded by the billionaire. Citing Angel Padilla, a   of the group, Politico reported: Dubbed \u201cIndivisible,\u201d the group launched as a way for Padilla and a handful of fellow   aides to channel their   heartbreak into a manual for quashing President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda. They drafted a   protest guide for activists, full of pointers on how to bird dog their members of Congress in the language of Capitol insiders. The manual has since been downloaded over one million times. Indivisible says on its website that over 4, 500 local groups across the nation have \u201csigned up to resist the Trump agenda in nearly every congressional district in the country. \u201d The manual has been utilized to form the basis of a protest movement. The group\u2019s website states: \u201cWhat\u2019s more, you all are putting the guide into action \u2014  showing up en masse to congressional district offices and events, and flooding the congressional phone lines. You\u2019re resisting \u2014  and it\u2019s working. \u201d Politico reported on \u201cunfounded\u201d rumors being spread about Soros\u2019s involvement with Indivisible (emphasis added by this reporter): Its handful of senior leaders count about 100 contributors to their national organizing work but insist that all are working on a volunteer basis. They know conservatives are spreading unfounded rumors that their success is being driven by wealthy donors like George Soros, which they flatly deny. That paragraph was followed by the following quote from   Padilla (emphasis again added by this reporter): \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who we take money from  \u2014   we\u2019re always going to get blamed as a Soros group, even if we don\u2019t take money from Soros,\u201d said Padilla, now an analyst with the National Immigration Law Center. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the attacks and that\u2019s fine. \u201d While \u201cIndivisible\u201d has yet to disclose its donors, Politico failed to inform readers that the National Immigration Law Center where the news outlet reported Padilla serves as an analyst is financed by Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations. The Center has received numerous Open Society grants earmarked for general support. Also unmentioned by Politico is that Padilla previously served as an immigration policy consultant at the radical National Council of La Raza. Soros is a major La Raza donor. Politico went on to detail how Indivisible has been aided by MoveOn. org and the ACLU.  The news website failed to tell readers that MoveOn. org and the ACLU are both financed by Soros, a relevant tidbit given Politico\u2019s claim about \u201cunfounded rumors\u201d that Indivisibles\u2019 success was being driven by Soros .  The news website reported: In addition, MoveOn. org and the Working Families Party joined with Indivisible for its first nationwide call on Jan. 22. Nearly 60, 000 people phoned in that day, according to Levin and MoveOn organizing director Victoria Kaplan. Indivisible estimates that its second national call, on the impact of Trump\u2019s immigration order with assistance from the ACLU and Padilla\u2019s group, drew 35, 000 people. Politico also missed that, according to its Twitter account, another organizer of the conference call with MoveOn. org was the International Refugee Assistance Project, a project of the Urban Justice Center, another recipient of an Open Society grant. Taryn Higashi, executive director of the Center\u2019s International Refugee Assistance Project, currently serves on the Advisory Board of the International Migration Initiative of Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations. Politico further reported on Indivisible\u2019s ties to the organizers of last month\u2019s   Women\u2019s March while failing to mention that Soros reportedly has ties to more than 50 \u201cpartners\u201d of that march. Also, this journalist first reported on the march leaders\u2019 own close associations with Soros. Regarding Indivisible and the Women\u2019s March, Politico reported: Indivisible is also embracing collaboration with other major   protest outlets. Leaders of the group were in communication with Women\u2019s March organizers before their main event on Jan. 21, and that partnership will become official when the March unveils the third in its series of 10 direct actions that attendees have been asked to pursue in their communities. Another Indivisible leader mentioned in the Politico article is Jeremy Haile. Not reported by Politico is that is Haile served as federal advocacy counsel for the Sentencing Project.  The Sentencing Project is reportedly financed by Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations, which has also hosted the Project to promote its cause.
