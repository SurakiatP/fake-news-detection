Barbara Lee ( ) said on Tuesday that she does not agree with states\u2019 rights because President Donald Trump believes in restoring states\u2019 authority on a wide range of issues, including education and health care insurance markets. [Lee made the remarks at the   Center for American Progress in Washington, DC, where she referenced states rights as it applies to Trump\u2019s decision this month to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate change agreement, a move she claims would hurt the U. S. economy.  Moreover, Lee said, California is still committed to fighting global warming. \u201cPulling out of the Paris Accord is also a job killer,\u201d Lee said. \u201cBecause the energy sector  \u2014   the green sector  \u2014   coming from California we\u2019re doing a lot of things  \u2014   I think some other states will follow. \u201cBecause the jobs that are being created will be destroyed now as a result of what this president has done,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with states\u2019 rights because that is kind of this administration\u2019s push but in some instances when we have to just go at it on our own  \u2014   we need to go at it on our own,\u201d Lee said. But according to Robertson Williams, a professor at the University of Maryland and director of academic programs for Resources for the Future, a   group that studied the climate change agreement, it is difficult to know exactly what the economic impacts of withdrawing will be. Williams was interviewed by the Boston public radio station in May where he was asked about the economic impact of leaving the agreement. \u201cOne of the problems we have, we\u2019re much better at modeling the cost of doing something to reduce emissions than we are modeling the cost of doing nothing,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know very well how other countries are gonna react. \u201cIf other countries react by doing less to fight climate change, that has very real costs,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThat unchecked climate change could have very serious costs for the U. S. economy. \u201cBut knowing exactly how big that is is really hard,\u201d Williams said.'"}, "time": 1742562243.576979}
