Reports suggest Trump will limit U. S. travel to the country and restrict the ability of    business interests to exploit the Cuban people in negotiations with the Castro regime.  Speaking to the Spanish newswire service EFE, Antonio Rodiles, the leader of the dissident group Estado de SATS, said he expected the Trump Cuba policy to \u201cpoint in a different direction than what has happened, which has been concessions, concessions with nothing in return, and the result has been more repression and more control on behalf of the regime in Havana. \u201d Rodiles called Trump\u2019s announcement, \u201cwithout a doubt a positive step for us,\u201d expressing confidence that Trump would make the respect for human rights on the island a key provision of any deal with dictator Ra\u00fal Castro. He particularly lauded reports that the Trump administration would make it more difficult for the Castro regime to benefit from American businesses. \u201cIt is tremendously contradictory that the armed forces are to receive most of the benefit of the new relationship with the United States, and at the same time are tasked with repressing those of us who defend human rights and liberties in the country,\u201d he argued. Rodiles had called President Obama\u2019s visit to the island in 2016 a \u201cpat on the back\u201d to the Castro regime and firmly opposed \u201cnormalization. \u201d Rodiles is not alone in his anticipation of the positive results of a Trump era policy that would undo the damage Obama\u2019s \u201cnormalization\u201d has caused. The head of the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU) dissident group, Jos\u00e9 Daniel Ferrer, wrote an open letter to President Trump this week urging an aggressive rejection of Obama\u2019s policies. \u201cIt is the moment to revert as much as possible these policies that only benefit the Castro regime and do not [benefit] the oppressed people at all or very little,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is time to impose strong sanctions on Ra\u00fal Castro\u2019s regime, and on Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s,\u201d he added, noting that the Cuban regime controls the highest levels of the socialist dictatorship in Venezuela and the freedom of one country is directly linked to the freedom of the other. \u201cDue to its outstanding position in the free world, the United States should not remain indifferent before the crimes that both regimes commit against their people,\u201d the letter continued. While noting that UNPACU initially supported the Obama \u201cnormalization\u201d process, the letter concluded that the   implications of the policy, particularly the increase in human rights violations against dissidents, has forced them to rescind their support. Among the specific instances of this mentioned in the letter are \u201cthe tripling of the number of political prisoners on the island,\u201d the beatings dissidents regularly receive from government agents, and robberies of dissident homes. A third prominent dissident, Agust\u00edn L\u00f3pez Canino, told EFE, according to the U. S.  Mart\u00ed news network, that he expects Trump to \u201cbe fair to dissidents and the exile community and condition the situation on human rights in Cuba, that facilitate a true presence of civil society\u201d in the government. L\u00f3pez Canino decried   Cuba as suffering under \u201cferocious capitalism,\u201d where   corporations are getting rich without the existence of a truly free market. The Ladies in White  \u2014   a Cuban dissident group consisting of wives, daughters, sisters, and mothers of political prisoners  \u2014   have not explicitly weighed in on the new Trump policy. This week, however, they sent a letter to the European Union, signed by their leader Berta Soler, calling for Europe to cut the Cuban regime off economically. Soler writes that, in response to the EU seeking a bilateral economic agreement with the Castro regime, \u201cfar from changing its attitude and understanding these negotiations as the beginning of an agreement that would pull it towards becoming a part of the international democratic community, has taken it as a legitimization of its power and since then has acted with total impunity. \u201d The letter requests an EU resolution condemning the Castro regime and a firm stance in favor of respecting human rights on the island. The Ladies in White have received the EU\u2019s Sakharov Prize for Human Rights Advocacy. Few details are currently public about the Trump Cuba policy scheduled for reveal Friday. On Tuesday, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told the U. S. Senate that the policy would undo \u201cconcerning\u201d moves by the Obama administration that had provided \u201cfinancial aid\u201d to the Castro regime. \u201cWe believe that we have achieved very little when it comes to changing the behavior of the regime and its treatment of the people, they have little incentive to change,\u201d he said.
