The statement was puzzling, not least because opening up laws is not a thing. And if it were a thing, it would be done by legislatures or courts, not the president. Read generously, though, Mr. Trump\u2019s statement may have meant that he intended to appoint Supreme Court justices who would vote to overturn precedents that make it hard to sue for libel. On this score, at least, Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, Mr. Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, seems destined to disappoint his patron. Judge Gorsuch\u2019s decisions in libel and related cases show no inclination to cut back on protections for the press. Some plaintiffs, he wrote in a 2011 opinion, have reputations so poor that even serious accusations cannot damage them. Libel law, he said, is \u201cabout protecting a good reputation honestly earned. \u201d Judge Gorsuch added that minor inaccuracies in a news report can never serve as the basis for a libel suit, calling that \u201ca First Amendment imperative. \u201d Press lawyers who have reviewed Judge Gorsuch\u2019s decisions said they liked what they saw. \u201cIn a handful of opinions where he has weighed in on the subject, Judge Gorsuch shows no indication that he will \u2018open up libel laws\u2019 to muzzle the press, as the president appears to hope,\u201d said Gayle C. Sproul, a lawyer with Levine Sullivan Koch  Schulz in Philadelphia. Eugene Volokh, an expert in First Amendment law at the University of California, Los Angeles, said Judge Gorsuch\u2019s commitment to free speech was not guarded or grudging. \u201cSometimes when judges apply the rules, you can see that they\u2019re holding their nose,\u201d Professor Volokh said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t seem to be. \u201d The question in the 2011 case was whether a Colorado prisoner, Jerry Lee Bustos, could sue the makers of a cable television show for calling him a member of the Aryan Brotherhood, a prison gang, when Mr. Bustos had merely conspired with the gang. Judge Gorsuch said there was no reason to think that Mr. Bustos\u2019s \u201cstanding in the public eye would be improved at all by more careful explication of the true particulars of his involvement with the Brotherhood. \u201d A version of this issue arose during Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, when his lawyers asked for a retraction of an article in The New York Times reporting on complaints from two women who said Mr. Trump had touched them inappropriately. Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers called the article libelous and seemed to threaten to sue. David McCraw, a lawyer for The Times, responded much as Judge Gorsuch had. \u201cThe essence of a libel claim, of course, is the protection of one\u2019s reputation,\u201d Mr. McCraw wrote. But Mr. Trump\u2019s reputation in this area, Mr. McCraw said, could not have been harmed by The Times\u2019s report in light of, for instance, Mr. Trump\u2019s own statements about groping women. \u201cNothing in our article has had the slightest effect on the reputation that Mr. Trump, through his own words and actions, has already created for himself,\u201d Mr. McCraw wrote. So far, there has been no lawsuit over the article. Gregg Leslie, the legal defense director for the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said Judge Gorsuch did not have \u201can extensive history of speech and press cases. \u201d But the judge \u201cconsistently applied established First Amendment protections when he did get them,\u201d Mr. Leslie said. \u201cHe also showed a willingness to uphold protections for speech rights even in controversial cases. It\u2019s always good to see a judge do the right thing in tougher circumstances. \u201d Ms. Sproul said Judge Gorsuch had voted in favor of news organizations in    cases, even when they involved \u201cclassically sympathetic plaintiffs, like a victim of sexual assault and by cops cleared of wrongdoing. \u201d In a 2007 case concerning the broadcast of a videotape of a rape, Judge Gorsuch joined an opinion dismissing a lawsuit by the victim. The court ruled that the news report concerned \u201ca matter of legitimate public interest. \u201d He joined a second 2007 decision dismissing a case brought by undercover police officers on similar grounds. \u201cCourts have generally treated allegations of police misconduct as worthy of public interest,\u201d the decision said, refusing to carve out an exception for disclosing the identities of police officers working undercover. \u201cWe can find no precedent for such an exception, and we are not inclined to create one here merely on policy grounds,\u201d the decision said, \u201cdespite our concerns about the safety of undercover officers and the need to avoid disincentives for entering their profession. \u201d Judge Gorsuch has also read other protections of the First Amendment broadly, including the right of citizens \u201cto petition the government for a redress of grievances. \u201d That clause, he wrote in a 2007 case involving an unhappy taxpayer, \u201cdoes not pick and choose its causes. \u201d \u201cThe minor and questionable, along with the mighty and consequential, are all embraced,\u201d Judge Gorsuch wrote. Ronald K. L. Collins, a First Amendment specialist at the University of Washington, said the Supreme Court would benefit from Judge Gorsuch\u2019s \u201c  and informed devotion to free expression. \u201d \u201cIf confirmed,\u201d Mr. Collins said, \u201cNeil Gorsuch will be a   First Amendment player  \u2014   an intellectual and rhetorical force to be reckoned with. \u201d But Judge Gorsuch seems unlikely to use his skills to advance Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda in libel cases, said Professor Volokh, who has known the judge for decades. \u201cTo the extent people are worried that President Trump has an    project,\u201d Professor Volokh said, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing to suggest Neil would share that project. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563505.1213205}
