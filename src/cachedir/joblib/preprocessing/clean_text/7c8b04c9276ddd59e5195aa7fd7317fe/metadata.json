A. team, held then by the   Chicago Bulls, the team\u2019s coach, Steve Kerr, sensed trouble. \u201cI think they want the record,\u201d Kerr said of his players in April, when they were still four wins short of the record of 73 victories. \u201cBut I think what they\u2019ve probably realized is that maybe all the talk and all the focus on the record has gotten us away from our process and what makes us who we are, what makes us pretty good. \u201d His anxiety was so pronounced that over the final weeks of the regular season \u201cslippage\u201d became one of his favorite words. He saw slippage when the Warriors were blown out by the lowly Los Angeles Lakers on March 6. He saw slippage when the Warriors barely outlasted the Philadelphia 76ers on March 27. And he saw slippage when the Warriors lost two of three games at home at the start of April, a rare stretch of futility that imperiled the Warriors\u2019 quest to catch the Bulls of the Michael Jordan era. Kerr attempted to explain away such setbacks as the byproduct of a long season spent in the spotlight. They were lauded as perhaps the best basketball team ever. Stephen Curry and some teammates graced the covers of magazines, or were prominently featured in them, even in Golf Digest. The team\u2019s record for   (1, 077) led by Curry, inspired talk of the game\u2019s being changed forever. Kerr expressed confidence that his players would regain their familiar rhythm once the N. B. A. playoffs began. But their poor habits also nagged him: too many loose passes and missed assignments as they tiptoed toward the playoffs. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can just flip the switch entirely,\u201d Kerr said at the time. \u201cThere is going to be a natural elevation and energy and all that. But it\u2019s the habits you have to clean up, because that stuff doesn\u2019t necessarily turn back on. \u201d It turns out the rhythm did not return, not completely, certainly not enough to stop the runaway freight train that the Cleveland Cavaliers became over the final three games of the N. B. A. finals. The upset  \u2014   if any series won by LeBron James could be called that  \u2014   brought Kerr\u2019s doubts into sharp relief: a record season, yes, but one achieved through a maze of adversity. The worst of it played out on Sunday night. Had Golden State survived in the closing seconds against Cleveland, none of this would matter, of course. The Warriors would have been celebrated for their determination, their moxie, their brilliance. Instead, it is easy to look back now and wonder about the emotional and physical toll of their season. Stalking 73 wins. Going seven games against the Oklahoma City Thunder in the Western Conference finals. Losing Draymond Green to a   suspension against the Cavaliers. How much did the Warriors have left by the bitter end? \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy what we accomplished,\u201d Curry said after losing to Cleveland, \u201cand it\u2019s not an easy pill to swallow what we didn\u2019t accomplish. \u201d Klay Thompson, the other half of the duo known as the Splash Brothers, seemed to cast the season\u2019s achievements aside. \u201cIt feels like a failure right now,\u201d said Thompson, who combined with Curry to shoot 12 of 36 from the field in Game 7. \u201cIt stings more than anything I\u2019ve gone through in my career. \u201d It is difficult to pinpoint one game from the season that said it all, but the defensive shortcomings flared particularly brightly on March 25, when the Warriors escaped with a   victory against the Dallas Mavericks. Kerr described his team\u2019s defense as \u201chorrific. \u201d The Warriors compensated by sinking a preposterous 21 of 45  . For much of the season, the Warriors produced so much offense that they could survive their lapses on defense. But their margin for error narrowed  \u2014   because of fatigue, because of injuries, because of waning focus. Kerr harped on his team to keep things simple instead of trying for the home run all the time. The players did not always listen. \u201cWhen you win, it kind of masks a lot of things,\u201d Harrison Barnes said before the start of the playoffs. At the same time, Kerr chose not to rest any of his stars in the final weeks of the regular season. His players wanted to win 73 games, so he made a pact with them: As long as they were honest about their health, he would let them play. Kerr did so with some trepidation. He would have preferred to find opportunities to sit Curry and others. Instead, the Warriors\u2019 hunt for the record extended to their   finale, which they won. More problems surfaced once the playoffs began. In the first round against the Houston Rockets, Curry injured his right ankle and sprained his right knee. Once he returned, he was spectacular at times  \u2014   he had 40 points in his first game back, against the Portland Trail Blazers in the conference semifinals  \u2014   but he lacked his usual consistency. Questions about his health would linger all the way through the finals. And then there was Green, whose volatile style had so often fueled his teammates. But in the playoffs, he skirted a fine line between being emotional and reckless. It caught up with him. After he collected too many flagrant fouls, he was suspended for Game 5 of the finals  \u2014   a game that the Warriors, with a chance to clinch    titles, lost at home. \u201cIf I don\u2019t put myself in that position and I don\u2019t get suspended for Game 5, are we sitting here champions? Maybe. Maybe not,\u201d Green said late Sunday. \u201cI don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll never know the answer to that question. But the answer that I do know is I won\u2019t put myself in that position again, and that\u2019s all I can really do. \u201d Kerr was asked whether he felt his team had played its best basketball at the start of the season, back when it reeled off 24 straight wins. He dismissed the question. \u201cThat\u2019s really tough to judge how you play and compare November to June,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s totally different. It\u2019s a physical game. You\u2019re playing great teams. \u201d Sure enough, for all their challenges in recent weeks, the Warriors still had a chance against the Cavaliers: Game 7 was tied in the final minute. So close to basketball nirvana. Cleveland fans might see poetic justice in how the Warriors were denied it: a   this one heaved by Kyrie Irving with 53 seconds remaining. It put Cleveland ahead for good. There would be no magical comeback, and not much magic at all from Curry, who was 6 of 19 for 17 points  \u2014   one of his most muted performances of the season. In the waning moments of their final game, with their dream of forever greatness dangling by a thread, the Warriors became the team that could not shoot straight. They missed their final nine   attempts, a stretch of futility that included seven errant  . The Cavaliers were not much better, finishing the game by shooting 1 of 8. But the one they actually made  \u2014   Irving\u2019s  \u2014   well, it was enough. Enough to lift the Cavaliers to a   victory and the first championship in franchise history. Enough to cement James\u2019s rightful place as an   winner. And enough to dismantle much of what Golden State had worked to achieve this season.'"}, "time": 1742563226.8471262}
