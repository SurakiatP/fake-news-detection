Paschn \\nChecking their deposit history, making certain their Israeli accounts are getting their scheduled 30 pieces of silver on time. Think about it; If a father/mother treated their children the way Sewer Nation\u2019s government treats us, they\u2019d be tried for abuse and jailed, the Judas Class in D.C. wins Nobel (payoffs) prizes. Tina Marie Deraco \\nBernie Sanders has been very vocal. What have you done to support his efforts? Paschn \\nThey\u2019re ALL very vocal, until the electronic ballet machines ensconce them in the whor, oops white house. You might ask dual citizen \u201cBernie\u201d why he gutted the \u201cAudit the Fed\u201d bill, it sure as hell wasn\u2019t for his Christian/Muslim constituency. \\nhttp://youtu.be/_Sqoq-lAGO8 Tina Marie Deraco \\nI agree. Once a president takes the Oval Office, we witness them doing 180\u2019s on some of their most passionate and popular platform promises. It\u2019s so bizarre, I find it hard to believe it\u2019s always deliberate on their part. Frankly, it\u2019s scary to wonder what happens behind those closed doors. In Bernie\u2019s case, he\u2019s not taking any big money, so he\u2019d go in without owing any favors to anyone but the American people. If the man who has been saying the same things for decades got in there and suddenly changed, I\u2019d be concerned he\u2019d been \u201creplaced\u201d. As for Bernie, he is not a dual citizen. He\u2019s been asked and he answered. No one has produced any proof to the contrary; so your allegation is falling on deaf ears. Unless you have some means of proving this honest man is lying; I suggest you drop that argument. He\u2019s the ONLY candidate who stood up for the Palestinian people during a Democratic debate (it\u2019s being called \u201chistoric\u201d) and some Israeli officials reacted with nasty verbal assaults. I\u2019m familiar with the ATF bill and Paul eventually appreciated what Bernie did. If you listen to the entire statement by Paul, you\u2019ll hear him explain the tremendous pressure being exerted against it\u2019s passing. What Bernie did was compromise to save it from dying completely. He injected an amendment that even the president went along with and it was voted on and passed. Paul calmed down and realized that Bernie gave them something out of nothing, Sanders wasn\u2019t dubbed the \u201camendment king\u201d for no reason. When Rand Paul presented another ATF bill just a few months ago, Bernie voted with him, against the Democrats and the president\u2019s wishes. Unfortunately it did not pass. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/10/ron-paul-backs-fed-audit_n_570487.html Paschn \\nBernie Sanders is, by virtue of his Jewish heritage, a dual citizen. The \u201cright of Return\u201d automatically extended to all Jews allows him to move about between the U.S. and Israel. As for \u201ccompromise\u201d? Being one who will never accept the 2 party system when it comes to what is or is not good for ALL citizens, perhaps I judge his \u201ccompromise\u201d too harshly. Even as a teenager I wasn\u2019t able to grasp this idiocy of voting along the \u201cparty\u201d lines. It\u2019s either good or not. A person\u2019 voting should have nothing to do with a party affiliation. It cripples the democratic process and benefits those holding title to \u201cour\u201d statesmen. Consider this, what type of honorable legislative branch would argue amongst themselves ending with the private FED RES being, yet again, shielded from transparency? Those foul dogs should be rising up as ONE demanding the FED RES charter be instantly rescinded and they, along with their PRIVATE collection agency, the IRS should be bodily thrown out of our nation right behind the Central Bank owned U.N. It wasn\u2019t a \u201clucky break\u201d which allowed Jackson to be the first and only president to pay the Nat\u2019l debt to zero, it was because he rid us of those stinking Rothschild parasites. How things have changed, no? While we naively think it\u2019s only oil/gas/markets that keep 800 military bases in +/- 130 nations to make things \u201ccozy\u201d for the corporations but no, the Judas Class\u2019s primary reason, (which they\u2019ve accomplished for their masters), is forcing the goddamn City of London Central Banks down the throats of smaller, weaker nations. There are literally only around five nations who are not being sucked dry by those swine. I apologize for the rant but those Central Bank blood-suckers get my ire up\u2026 quickly. Keysbum \\nquit the pussyfooting around\u2026 these criminals control the creation and destruction of money. that means they own, and control the world. Robby Johnson Fox \\nWhich, in turn, means we \u2013 the average people of this world \u2013 are slaves to them that make and destroy money. Paschn \\nEven more frightening than a government so corrupted this succubus continues \u201cwhoring -as-usual\u201d, knowing full well \u201cthe synagogue\u201d has no intention of letting a simple thing like treason allow this year\u2019s favorite member of the Judas Class answer for her crimes, there are literally millions of dead-from-the-neck-up members of this \u201cmutt\u201d culture supporting that demoness Sewer Nation \u2013 Idiot Culture. \\nShe\u2019s owned by global Jewry. peter \\nYou know, Judas has been taking an undeserved rap over these past couple of millenia. According to the church, God offered up Jesus for martyrdom and Judas was a key part of that plan. Jesus even asked God if there was no other way and God said \u201cNope, this is the way it\u2019s gotta be. \\nJudas was just doing what he was supposed to do. Peaver Bogart \\nIt would be very funny if nobody showed up.
