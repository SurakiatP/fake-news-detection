The two women hadn\u2019t spoken in months, after a prolonged breakup, and the ex was now seeing somebody new. Yet there she was, on the day of   romance, \u201cliking\u201d my friend\u2019s Instagram photo   \u2026     from three weeks ago. Which meant she had to have been scrolling through her feed. There was the friend, a digital strategist who, every few days, would receive a \u201csup\u201d from a recruiter, except that the recruiter would never set up a time to meet. Once, my friend returned to his desk to find a \u201cfailed Google hangout\u201d notification from this person, to which the recruiter later messaged to apologize for the \u201cbutt dial. \u201d My friend Victor Pineiro asked: \u201cWas this a new recruiting tactic? Or just specific to this guy?\u201d I\u2019ve had my own share of breadcrumbers: the editor at the publication where I was vying for a job who repeatedly viewed my LinkedIn page (which I could see) but never messaged me the guy I went out with a couple of times who continued to text me every few weeks to \u201ccheck in\u201d months after we stopped seeing each other. Alicia Winokur, a recent graduate of Mount Holyoke College, said: \u201cThe worst type of breadcrumber is the one who resurfaces every six months, and like the Loch Ness monster, you almost can\u2019t believe this creature has come back into your life. But there he is, saying, \u2018Hey, I was just thinking about you. \u2019\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like a meerkat poking its head up,\u201d she added. \u201cBut not nearly as cute. \u201d For anyone who\u2019s ever dated, or maintained any kind of relationship, in the digital age, you have probably known a breadcrumber. They communicate via sporadic noncommittal, but repeated messages  \u2014   or breadcrumbs  \u2014   that are just enough to keep you wondering but not enough to seal the deal (whatever that deal may be). Breadcrumbers check in consistently with a romantic prospect, but never set up a date. They pique your interest, of that prospective job, perhaps, by reminding you repeatedly that it exists, but never set up the interview. Breadcrumbers are one step shy of ghosters, who disappear without a trace, but are in more frequent contact than a person giving you the fade. On the hierarchy of digital communication, the breadcrumber is the lowest form. \u201cIt really is a cousin of the \u2018friend zone,\u2019\u201d said Rachel Simmons, an author and leadership coach at Smith College. \u201cIt\u2019s about relegating a person to a particular dead end, but one that still keeps them hanging on in some way. \u201d One can presume that the term breadcrumbing came from the fairy tale of Hansel and Gretel, at least according to Urban Dictionary. In the tale, Hansel snags a slice of bread in order to leave a trail of breadcrumbs so he and his sister, Gretel, can find their way home. Hansel\u2019s breadcrumbs were a bust (a bird ate them) but the term was adopted by early computer programmers to describe those little navigation tabs that lead you back to home. The breadcrumbs we\u2019re talking about do the opposite. They lead you astray. Among the different types of breadcrumbers:   who try to entice you with a text message of a URL, but without providing any context or setup bitmojiers, or their cousins, snapchatters, who, rather than communicate with actual words, prefer to remain ambiguous with an exaggerated cartoon of themselves holding up a sign that says, \u201cLOL. \u201d (LOL to what, though?) \u201cGod forbid you say \u2018How are you? \u2019\u201d said Hilary Campbell, an illustrator in Brooklyn and the victim of a Bitmoji breadcrumber. There are creepers, who peep your social media pages but never make contact, even when they know that you know they have viewed your page there are zombies, who   from the dead, so to speak, after months of no correspondence and there are text bubblers, or those who type a message, stop, begin typing again and then stop, creating a specific kind of digital hell. \u201cMy brother breadcrumbs me constantly,\u201d said Libby Leffler, a graduate student in Boston. \u201cHe\u2019ll send me random links on Reddit and then disappear. Sometimes in response I am like, \u2018Did you die?\u2019 \u2018Do I need to file a missing person\u2019s report? \u2019\u201d Like most of today\u2019s torturous microcommunications, we have technology to thank for breadcrumbs. Sure, they may have existed a decade ago (a nod on the street, a \u201cwhat\u2019s up\u201d in the hallway  \u2014   these were technically breadcrumbs, right?) but they didn\u2019t have quite the same \u201cdesperate wondering about what someone means,\u201d Ms. Simmons said. \u201cThese are connections, not conversations,\u201d said Sherry Turkle, a professor at M. I. T. who studies how technology shapes modern relationships. \u201cThey can have the paradoxical effect of making the person who receives them feel let down rather than gratified, but then, confused: Is one asking for too much? Should one feel satisfied with a smiley face or a series of exclamation marks or a string of emojis? What constitutes being recognized?\u201d In a dating context, this can be particularly complex. There\u2019s breadcrumbing when you\u2019ve broken up with someone but you don\u2019t want to let them go there\u2019s breadcrumbing as a way of keeping a dating prospect on \u201chold\u201d (what Ms. Turkle calls \u201cactivated but not active\u201d). Or there\u2019s breadcrumbing as a kind of game: when a person is \u201cnot interested in you, but interested in themselves staying relevant to you,\u201d as Ms. Campbell said. \u201cI had a breadcrumber who I\u2019m convinced deliberately tried to use as few characters as possible in his messages so as to not seem too interested,\u201d said Jordana Narin, a rising college senior who wrote a Modern Love column about her generation\u2019s inability to commit. \u201cSo a sample text from him would be \u2018wht are ur plans tmro\u2019 or \u2018are u in city,\u2019 abbreviating some words and writing others out fully. It was like a game of how little effort could he put into it. \u201d Rest assured, though, there are ways to beat breadcrumbers at their own game. Sara Wilson, who works in social media marketing in Los Angeles, said she has developed a methodology for identifying a breadcrumber. It\u2019s centered upon a few key phrases she calls \u201clazy to the power of 100,\u201d which include: \u201cYo\u201d \u201cFun night?\u201d \u201cHa\u201d \u201cSup\u201d \u201cNice\u201d \u201chey stranger\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like the digital equivalent of a sneeze,\u201d she said. Or, one may take the approach of Ms. Leffler. \u201cWhenever people are breadcrumbish to me, I always reply to them with less words than they send me,\u201d she said. \u201cSo if they were like, \u2018sounds good,\u2019 I would respond with \u2018thumbs up. \u2019\u201d'"}, "time": 1742561843.5169783}
