What happened next, in each case, wasn\u2019t pretty. The electronically activated seat crushed the phone, damaging the battery, which began heating uncontrollably. Both times, as other travelers watched in alarm, flight attendants were able to retrieve the devices  \u2014   in one case, already flaming  \u2014   and submerge the phones in water to cool them down. The planes landed without further incident. \u201cIt\u2019s a small number, considering how many flights we have,\u201d said Sharna   a spokeswoman for Qantas. \u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s happening all the time. But we are asking people to be a little bit more aware of where their phones are. \u201d Little wonder, then, that Qantas has imposed a ban on Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, which have a propensity to spontaneously catch fire. Qantas is not the only airline to have had such episodes with reclining   seats. Air France has had three   smoke or fire events that were set off in the same way. And the Qantas and Air France incidents do not fully illustrate the hazard, according to N. Albert Moussa, founder of BlazeTech, a fire safety company. \u201cIf you take the same device and crush it differently in the seat, you could release the energy much faster,\u201d Mr. Moussa said. Economy seats, which are much less complex and do not move on a track, tend not to have the mechanisms that could trap and crush a phone. Qantas and Air France have modified their preflight safety announcements to warn passengers not to move their   seats if their digital devices fall. But some wonder if asking passengers to pay closer attention to the location of their phones is sufficient. In business class, many seats are fitted with a shield meant to prevent items from dropping into the moving parts below. But the shields are not required. Laura Brown, a Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman, said airline seat makers are required to ensure only that body parts  \u2014   not dropped objects  \u2014   cannot be trapped in seat mechanisms. Vern Alg, an aircraft interiors consultant, described it as a case of learning by experience. \u201cYou build a seat with the idea that you\u2019ve thought of everything,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd as the seat goes into service and people test it, you find other avenues for things to get down into the mechanism. \u201d With more passengers carrying more devices onboard, as well as the growth of business class and ever more elaborate seats, the evolution of cabin design ought to be thoroughly investigated, said Merritt Birky, a former fire and explosion specialist at the National Transportation Safety Board who is now a private consultant. \u201cAny fire onboard an aircraft is a serious problem,\u201d Mr. Birky said. \u201cAnd if the seats are involved, if the mechanism of the seat is involved, it should be part of the investigation. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628518.0586903}
