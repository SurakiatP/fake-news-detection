[\u201cHe could say, like President Bush did right after September 11th, \u2018The face of Terror is not the true face of Islam, that\u2019s not what Islam is about, Islam is Peace.\u2019 Instead, we get \u2018Islam hates us\u2019,\u201d Katyal told the bench, answering   Judge Richard Paez\u2019s question on what, if anything, Trump could do to make the executive order acceptable.  Katyal, former President Barack Obama\u2019s   acting Solicitor General, has taken on the representation of the plaintiffs who stopped the executive order\u2019s implementation in March when a federal court in Hawaii ruled in their favor. The Justice Department has appealed the case to the Ninth Circuit, seeking to vacate that injunction. The most controversial element of   district court Judge Derrick Watson\u2019s ruling was its justification of the injunction based not on the text or effect of the executive order, but on statements President Trump made during the 2016 campaign. According to that ruling, speaking about a \u201cMuslim ban\u201d and speaking negatively about the religion\u2019s relationship with the West mean that the plaintiffs had a high enough likelihood of proving a violation of the First Amendment\u2019s Establishment Clause to block the order. This is true even though the actual order does not take any action based on people being Muslim because, \u201c[A] reasonable, objective observer \u2014  enlightened by the specific historical context, contemporaneous public statements, and specific sequence of events leading to its issuance \u2014  would conclude that the Executive Order was issued with a purpose to disfavor a particular religion[. ]\u201d Katyal doubled down on this line of argument Monday, contending, as the district court had, that no reasonable objective observer could not see that the purpose of the order was to disfavor Muslims. As evidence, he rattled off an extensive list of amicus briefs submitted in favor of striking down Trump\u2019s order. Mentioned were the usual bevy of     and liberal religious groups. \u201cEven the Cato Institute,\u201d Katyal finished, referring to the libertarian think tank with a long history of supporting weak immigration laws. The argumentation led naturally to the question of what, if anything, could be done to save such a facially neutral order. \u201cDoes that mean that the President is forever barred from issuing an executive order along these lines?\u201d Judge Paez asked Katyal. \u201cWhat does he have to do to issue an executive order that, in your view, might pass constitutional muster?\u201d Trump might gain more power to issue executive order if he \u201cdisavows,\u201d Katyal argued. \u201cOne example would be what Judge Hawkins said about disavowing formally the stuff before. \u201d \u201cBut that\u2019s not it, he could do a lot of things,\u201d Katyal continued. \u201cI\u2019m just going to throw out some examples, I\u2019m not trying to micromanage the president. \u201d In addition to suggesting Trump could save his order by telling the country \u201cIslam is peace,\u201d Katyal also recommended removing references, in the text of the order, to the unsavory elements of Islamic society. \u201cIt could eliminate the text which refers to honor killings,\u201d he told the court. Katyal, in his work at the Justice Department during the Obama administration, frequentally defended presidential power to govern by executive order. He appeared to recognize the unusual nature of this suit challenging a president\u2019s authority on religious grounds. \u201cOur fundamental point to you is that Presidents generally don\u2019t run into establishment clause problems. This is a very unusual case in which you have these public statements by the President,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742563263.5302753}
