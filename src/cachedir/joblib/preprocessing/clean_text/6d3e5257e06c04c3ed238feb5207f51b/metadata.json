[Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt asked Sessions in an interview if the new attorney general would consider designating an outside counsel \u201cnot connected to politics\u201d to take a second look at Justice Department actions that provoked Republican ire in the last eight years. Those include the Fast and Furious gun scandal and the decisions against bringing criminal charges over Hillary Clinton\u2019s email practices or the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s treatment of conservative groups.  Hewitt contended during his radio interview that the department had become \u201chighly politicized\u201d in the Obama administration and floated the idea of a special review by an attorney with the authority to bring criminal charges and \u201cjust generally to look at how the Department of Justice operated. \u201d Sessions was noncommittal but left the door open, saying he would do everything he could to \u201crestore the independence and professionalism of the Department of Justice. \u201d \u201cSo we would have to consider whether or not some outside special counsel is needed,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cGenerally, a good review of that internally is the first step before any such decision is made. \u201d The exchange reflected the lingering deep partisan anger over the Justice Department\u2019s decision to close without charges the Clinton email investigation and a separate probe into how the IRS processed requests for   applications. Sessions said the outcome of the IRS case, in particular, remained \u201cof real concern. \u201d The Justice Department in 2015 found mismanagement at the tax agency but no evidence that it had targeted a political group based on its viewpoints or obstructed justice. Democrats have called for an outside counsel to probe possible contacts between Russian officials and the Trump campaign. Sessions recused himself last week from any investigation that touches the campaign, and Rod Rosenstein, the prosecutor nominated as his deputy, would not commit at his confirmation hearing this week to step aside from any such investigation. During the campaign, President Donald Trump said he would appoint a special prosecutor to look into Clinton, though he expressed ambivalence about that idea after he won the election. It\u2019s not clear how serious Sessions was about the idea of a special counsel to investigate past Justice Department decisions, or how such an undertaking might work.'"}, "time": 1742564307.3272064}
