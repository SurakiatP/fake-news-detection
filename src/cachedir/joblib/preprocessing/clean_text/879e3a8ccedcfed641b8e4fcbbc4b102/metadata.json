I. and an investigation that was supposed to be closed? In the latest episode of The   we examine the most recent surprise twist in a campaign that never ceases to shock. We break down this development into three parts. First we sift through the essential,   facts of the case with two reporters who have covered the investigation since it emerged, Amy Chozick and Michael S. Schmidt. Second, we examine why the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, decided to make the new findings public, by talking with Carrie Cordero, a former attorney at the Department of Justice who worked closely with the F. B. I. And to close out, we explain what impact this could have on the outcome of next Tuesday\u2019s election, with insight from Nate Cohn of The Upshot. He says that, as with so many of the major news events in this contest, this one is not likely to be a game changer. \u201cAll those things did move the polls, but they didn\u2019t fundamentally reshape the race,\u201d Mr. Cohn says. \u201cThe core underlying dynamic of this election hasn\u2019t ever changed, and that\u2019s that a majority of voters don\u2019t really believe Trump is qualified to be the president, they don\u2019t like either candidate, so when the news is good or bad for their candidate they become more or less likely to indicate their support, but there has never been a time in this race when Trump has been able to assemble a clear path to victory. \u201d COMING UP!
