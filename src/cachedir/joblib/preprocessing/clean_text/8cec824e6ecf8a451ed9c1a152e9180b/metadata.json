[\u201cThe court case involves comments posted to Facebook about the leader of Austria\u2019s Green Party, which the party claims are illegal under the country\u2019s hate speech laws,\u201d reported Fortune. \u201cAn appeals court in Vienna agreed and ordered Facebook to take them down not just in Austria but everywhere else as well. \u201d  According to Reuters, the court also said that \u201cmerely blocking them in Austria without deleting them for users abroad was not sufficient. \u201d The order would mean that citizens of other countries where \u201chate speech\u201d laws are   could have their free speech restricted under Austrian law to stop negative posts being made and shared. \u201cShould Facebook comply globally with Russia\u2019s   laws, or Thailand\u2019s laws against insulting the king, or Saudi Arabia\u2019s blasphemy laws?\u201d asked Daphne Keller, a lawyer at the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford University. \u201cWould Austria want those laws to dictate what speech its citizens can share online? This ruling sends a signal to courts around the world that they, too, can enforce their national laws to ban speech around the world. \u201d Keller also added that since the post was a political comment, the court order is particularly \u201ctroubling,\u201d raising questions as to whether political censorship is being enforced. \u201cThere is no place for hate speech on Facebook and this post was removed from our platform last year as requested,\u201d said a Facebook spokesman to Fortune. \u201cHowever, we will appeal this particular case before the Austrian Supreme Court to have better legal clarity around this specific post and the categorization as \u2018unlawful\u2019 as the new decision substantially reversed the original court decision. \u201d Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
