Also, having disingenuous propagandist commentators on every night like Kayleigh McEnany and Katrina Pierson should be shameful to CNN and Fox, respectively in these 2 cases.\\nI watch some Fox and CNN for details, and for the opinions of just a few of their commentators (Krauthammer, Acosta for the Electoral Map). I used to watch mostly Al Jazeera America, which of course closed shop, and still watch The BBC, which is better than anything American, although not as good as Al Jazeera was. CNN International also is excellent - available only over the Internet - and the much-despised Russia Today has some excellent programming as well - I like The Keiser Report. Thanks for your post.'"}, "time": 1742563039.8796177}
