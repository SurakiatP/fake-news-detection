So when the phone rang with a tip that an enormous freighter loaded with hashish was plying international waters south of Sicily  \u2014   bound for Libya, hundreds of miles to the east of the usual quick drug route to Spain  \u2014   Francesco Amico, a senior investigator, immediately knew something odd was going on. Not just odd, but huge: When two Italian Navy warships eventually stopped the freighter, the Adam, off the Libyan coast on April 12, 2013, agents found a terrified Syrian crew and 15 metric tons of hashish  \u2014   a stash many multiples larger than Italian officials had ever seen. \u201cThere was so much of the drug that we didn\u2019t know where to put it,\u201d said Mr. Amico, who waited in the Sicilian port of Trapani for the escorted ship to arrive. \u201cWe had to go out and rent a warehouse. \u201d The Italian officials had stumbled on a lucrative new trafficking route that stretched far to the east along the coast of Northern Africa  \u2014   and always led to Libya, in an area fought over by competing armed groups that included the Islamic State. The Adam was the first of 20 ships that would be intercepted over the route over the following 32 months, officials say. Their collective cargo amounted to more than 280 tons of hashish valued at 2. 8 billion euros, or about $3. 2 billion  \u2014   roughly half of what was seized in all of continental Europe last year, according to the European Union\u2019s Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug Addiction. Then the tips dried up, and the busts stopped. The Italian investigation, which had expanded to include other European countries and the United States Drug Enforcement Administration, has not seized any ships on the route in 2016, though officials say they believe the traffic continues. Instead, as they have sought to understand what happens to the enormous shipments, they are struggling with a mystery that has prompted intriguing questions but offered few answers. One thing they know is that the drugs were not ending up in Libya. The Moroccan drug producers consistently use individualized branding logos, like a scorpion or a dollar sign. That helped investigators pick up the drug shipments\u2019 trail again after they left Libya, traveling along an overland route through Egypt and then on to Europe through the Balkans. But the investigators are still not sure what happened as the drugs passed through. From interrogations and surveillance, they know the route crossed territory that until a few weeks ago was claimed by the Islamic State  \u2014   which has taxed shipments of drugs and other goods in Syria and Iraq. That, in particular, led the Italian drug investigators to start asking questions they never expected to confront: Could the Islamic State or some other group be profiting from the drug route by taxing it? Was the   chaos in Libya providing an opportunity by drug traffickers to pick a route the authorities wouldn\u2019t suspect, or were the   groups more directly involved? The investigation continues. \u201cOnce it reaches Libya, we lose track of it,\u201d said Lt. Col. Giuseppe Campobasso, who heads the antidrug unit in Sicily of the Guardia di Finanza, the Italian financial police force that led the search for the ships. For years, the Italian investigators had tracked small shipments of Moroccan hashish, around 100 kilograms at a time, coming to Spain in boats that crossed the Strait of Gibraltar  \u2014   a narrow passage that ferries cross in under 35 minutes. In 2007, Spain began installing cameras up and down its southern coastline, but at least at first, the hashish traffic continued in the usual way. With Europe\u2019s eyes trained on   traffic coming from the south, at first no one noticed the cargo ships that were taking a big dogleg to the east. Giacomo Catania, an inspector with the Guardia di Finanza who was in charge of storing the incoming drugs, explained another oddity: The enormous cargo ships they seized  \u2014   some as long as a soccer field and designed to carry fleets of automobiles or cargo containers  \u2014   were empty except for the drugs. \u201cThese are ships that have a capacity to carry thousands of tons, and the cargo in most cases was around 20 tons. Only a minuscule portion of it was used,\u201d Mr. Catania said. That the smugglers were willing to operate so inefficiently  \u2014   Mr. Catania compared it to using an   to transport a single pack of cigarettes  \u2014   is testament to the value of the cargo. Considering that hashish sells for \u20ac10, 000, about $11, 200, per kilogram once it reaches Europe\u2019s streets, the Adam\u2019s cargo alone was worth at least \u20ac150 million. And shipments seized later were even bigger  \u2014   including a load of hashish aboard the freighter Aberdeen, boarded in the summer of 2014, that was estimated to be worth \u20ac420 million  \u2014   or about $472 million. After seizing the Adam, investigators in Italy interrogated its crew members, who insisted that they did not know that hashish was in the 591 plastic bags investigators had found on the ship\u2019s deck. The ship\u2019s captain testified that he believed he was transporting humanitarian aid, brought to the ship by the crew of a speedboat that approached them off the coast of Morocco and insisted that they take the bags, according to a transcript of his statement to investigators. To learn more, the investigators  \u2014   who have decades of experience dealing with the Sicilian Mafia  \u2014   decided to bug the cells where the six crew members were imprisoned. Over months of surveillance, Mr. Amico began to discern the outlines of the trafficking route, and the mystery of the militant stronghold in coastal Libya it passed through. Since the ouster of the Libyan leader Muammar   in 2011, stretches of Libya along the coastline in the eastern region of Cyrenaica had become a battleground for competing militant groups. By 2014, that included the Islamic State\u2019s branch in Libya, which at various times had footholds in the cities of Benghazi, Derna and especially Surt, which has partly fallen to   forces. Italian officials believe that those cities were all destinations for some of the drug ships, although the navigation units of other seized vessels indicate that they were headed to the Libyan port of Tobruk, which is controlled by a rebel group fighting the Islamic State. Investigators say they believe that at least in some cases, the terrorist group would have been able to exact a tax in return for the drugs\u2019 passage. That matches the Islamic State\u2019s business practice in its stronghold in Syria and Iraq, where according to one study by IHS Country Risk, 7 percent of the group\u2019s revenue last year was from the production, taxation and trafficking of drugs. But officials concede that they cannot be certain what role, if any, the Islamic State might play in the hashish shipments. \u201cNo one has eyes on the ground to say that they know for a fact,\u201d said Masood Karimipour, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime\u2019s regional representative for the Middle East and North Africa. \u201cWhat we can offer, or make a reasonable inferences from, is that where the terrorists are holding terrain they are controlling everything that goes through it, including the trafficking of whatever  \u2014   whether it\u2019s weapons or drugs. \u201d Poring over the surveillance tapes of the jailed crew of the freighter Adam, Mr. Amico and the rest of his investigative team started to wonder whether the drugs were part of a bigger scheme, perhaps involving weapons. They learned that the Adam had begun its Mediterranean voyage in Cyprus, where it picked up four containers of \u201cfurniture,\u201d destined for Benghazi. After dropping off the cargo, the vessel continued to Morocco, picking up 15 tons of hashish and returning to Libya. From other comments by the crew, Mr. Amico and his team came to believe that the \u201cfurniture\u201d was a shipment of weapons, he said, an idea supported by two of the prosecutors involved in the case. \u201cLibya is not a land where people consume hashish,\u201d said Deputy Prosecutor Maurizio Agnello. \u201cSo that cargo of drugs is definitely a method of payment, a kind of coin. \u201d In recent months, however, the Italian investigation has stalled. Most of the tips were coming from French officials, who in recent months were scrambling to deal with a wave of terrorist attacks at home, and when the tips ended, so did the busts. No ships have been intercepted along the route in 2016, though investigators say they believe the path is still being used. They expressed unease about the lack of certainty regarding the players controlling the new route. \u201cIf this was controlled by the Mafia, we would know how to deal with it, because we know the Mafia well,\u201d said Mr. Agnello, whose office is in a stately building in Palermo, a stronghold of the Sicilian Mafia, which for years controlled the hashish arriving from Morocco via Spain. When it comes to the possible involvement of terrorist groups, he said, \u201cIt frightens us because they don\u2019t have limits. They do stuff that would be unthinkable for a Mafioso. \u201d '"}, "time": 1742564589.6615815}
