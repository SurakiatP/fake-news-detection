[What\u2019s more, Julia Halberstam, David Halberstam\u2019s daughter, is donating the royalties from the books sold in 2017 to investigative journalism   ProPublica.  \u201cJulia Halberstam told us she was moved to do this by reaction to a story in the New York Times reporting that White House assistant Stephen Bannon was reading the book during the presidential transition and recommending it to colleagues,\u201d the New York   group reports. News of Bannon\u2019s interest in The Best and the Brightest broke after New York Times sports reporter Marc Tracy spotted Trump\u2019s top adviser holding the 1972 book at Atlanta Georgia\u2019s   International Airport. \u201cMr. Bannon was carrying a book, and when an incoming president\u2019s guru is reading a book, you should find out what it is,\u201d Tracy wrote in a Times article titled, \u201cSteve Bannon\u2019s Book Club. \u201d \u201cI walked by and peeked. It was The Best and the Brightest, David Halberstam\u2019s 1972 history of the strategic errors and human foibles that birthed the disastrous American involvement in the Vietnam War. \u201d ProPublica, says \u201cwe agree with Bannon that the book is \u2018great for seeing how little mistakes early on\u2019 in an administration \u2018can lead to big ones later. \u2019\u201d \u201cIf you have not read The Best and the Brightest, or have not read it recently, we join Steve Bannon in urging you to do so. ProPublica will benefit, to be sure, but we believe anyone seeking to be an informed citizen will as well. \u201d Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson'"}, "time": 1742562170.0416238}
