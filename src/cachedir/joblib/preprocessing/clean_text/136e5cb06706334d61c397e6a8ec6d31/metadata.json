Now..guess what is happening? \\nMORE bad news! \\nHowever, bad news for the Clintons means good news for us. \\nWe all knew that Hillary was a scheming snake of corruption who loves nothing but power and money. However with each new hit that came her way in October, many of us were still shocked over the sheer madness of it all. \\nNow, Wikileaks is giving Bill Clinton some time under the microscope of truth. \\nVia The Daily Caller : \\nIra Magaziner, the CEO of the Clinton Health Access Initiative, asked former President Bill Clinton to thank Morocco\u2019s King Mohammed VI for \u201coffering his plane to the conference in Ethiopia.\u201d \\n\u201cCHAI would like to request that President Clinton call Sheik Mohammed to thank him for offering his plane to the conference in Ethiopia,\u201d Magaziner gushed in a November 22, 2011 email released by WikiLeaks. \\nClinton frequently has expected free, luxurious private jet travel during his post-presidential life. Clinton, his wife and daughter have artfully secured free air travel and luxurious accommodations since they left the White House. It\u2019s an effective way to accept gifts of great value without declaring them for the Clinton Foundation. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s highly illegal and it\u2019s likely that the owners of these aircraft took tax deductions as a gift to the Clinton Foundation,\u201d Charles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst and critic of the Clinton Foundation, told The Daily Caller News Foundation. \\nOf course! Classic Clinton crap\u2026 living the life of luxury on the backs of hardworking Americans. \\nThat\u2019s what they do! Related Items'"}, "time": 1742563133.9598362}
