[\u201cIf someone tries to share a photo that Facebook has previously taken down, that person will see a   saying the photo violates Facebook\u2019s policies and that Facebook will not allow the person to share that particular photo on Facebook, Messenger or Instagram,\u201d explained TechCrunch on Wednesday. \u201cFacebook has also partnered with a handful of organizations, like the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative and the Revenge Porn Helpline, to offer support to people who are victims of revenge porn. \u201d  \u201cWe\u2019ve focused in on this because of the unique harm that this kind of sharing has on its victims,\u201d said Facebook Global Head of Safety, Antigone Davis. \u201cIn the newsroom post we refer to a specific piece of research around the unique harm this has for victims. I think that\u2019s where the focus was for this moving forward. \u201d \u201cAt this moment, we\u2019re not using AI to go through this particular content,\u201d Davis continued, pointing out that the issue is currently too complex to cut out human moderators completely. \u201cThere is significant context that\u2019s required for reviewing   sharing. \u201d Revenge porn has proven to be an issue for social media platforms, where disgruntled exes and even hackers have been able to post private and intimate photos of their victims without permission. Last month, a revenge porn victim\u2019s lawyer claimed   site Tumblr had \u201cchosen to ignore\u201d revenge porn images posted on the platform after it allegedly took three weeks to get a video of the     victim removed from the site. \u201cIn my opinion, Tumblr has chosen to ignore valid legal demands because they earn more money using victims\u2019 photographs as clickbait than they do protecting minors,\u201d claimed lawyer Daniel Szalkiewicz, whose firm specializes in Internet defamation and revenge porn cases. Upon investigation, Breitbart Tech also found numerous accounts on Tumblr that specialized in trying to find and shame the victims seen in revenge porn, most of which had been up for numerous weeks without deletion.
