Twitter has previously done little to curb direct threats of violence against the President or his family, allowing \u201cRape Melania\u201d to trend on the site for hours. The website has also allowed as many as 12, 000 tweets calling for the assassination of President Trump. Twitter, which recently reported an extremely poor quarterly earnings report, has not responded to a request for comment on the results at this time.
