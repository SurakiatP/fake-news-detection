[The nastiest opponents to President Trump inside and out of government apparently feel justified in using \u201cany means necessary\u201d to defeat and remove him. Every day sees more evidence of a desire not only to block his policies but to drive him from office. While it does not yet rise to the level of an organized conspiracy, it does raise serious issues of constitutional fidelity.  First, in the weeks following the November election, we saw street protest and marches, followed by lawsuits, then leaks from inside government, and then talk of \u201cimpeachment\u201d over crimes for which no evidence exists. And folks, in the words of Al Jolson, you ain\u2019t seen nothing yet. It\u2019s probably going to get worse. The seeds of this \u201ccultural embarrassment\u201d over Trump\u2019s victory were planted in the days immediately following the November 8 election: These efforts have at least three obvious things in common: desperation born of utter shock at Trump\u2019s election victory   elitist arrogance and the active participation and support from the nation\u2019s major media organizations. Yet, there is another novel element interwoven in these events that is even more dangerous  \u2014   dangerous not simply as a political obstacle to Trump\u2019s agenda, but inherently dangerous to the survival of our country. That novel element is the active, conscious subversion of lawful Presidential orders and initiatives by the permanent civil service apparatus called the \u201csenior bureaucracy. \u201d It is also being called the \u201cDeep State,\u201d meaning the part of the government that is immune to political appointment and political accountability. And most dangerous of all is the involvement of our nation\u2019s intelligence agencies in the leaks aimed at embarrassing the President. The earliest news stories about an alleged \u201cRussian connection\u201d openly named America\u2019s intelligence operations as the source. Now comes this month\u2019s FBI testimony that the agency has been conducting an investigation of the Trump campaign, and yet the FBI still has not cited any evidence of any   that justifies the investigation. This involvement of intelligence agencies and the FBI in   investigations  \u2014   and the subsequent leaking of information gathered in the surveillance \u2014   puts into question the President\u2019s ability to trust the information provided to him by those agencies. And THAT, my friends, can seriously impair his ability to manage national security policy and any international or   crisis that occurs. The theme of an \u201cillegitimate presidency\u201d provides a veneer of moral justification for seemingly disconnected acts of political sabotage.  If resistance to Trump\u2019s policies is resistance to \u201ctyranny\u201d by a \u201cusurper,\u201d then nothing is out of bounds or off limits. This \u201c \u201d arrogance is what makes the   campaign potentially lethal for constitutional government.  The effort to paint President Trump as a usurper who deserves to be thrown out of office is unprecedented in its scope and intensity, and it will have unintended consequences for the Republic. This week there were revelations from the House Intelligence Committee supporting Trump\u2019s allegation of Obama regime surveillance of the Trump campaign and transition. Intelligence gathered by lawful wiretaps of foreign agent activities recorded \u201cincidental\u201d conversations involving persons inside or close to Trump campaign. Those \u201cintercepted\u201d conversations reportedly had nothing to do with alleged \u201cRussian hacking\u201d of the election, nor did they reveal any \u201ccollusion\u201d with Russian agents.  Yet, contrary to law, the conversations were shared with Obama White House staff and then with the media. How do we explain the bizarre obsession of Democrat leaders and the media with the \u201cRussian connection\u201d? Not one tiny shred of evidence has been produced by anyone to show any Trump campaign collusion with Russian activities connected to the 2016 election. And yet, the media and Democrat opponents (sorry, I repeat myself) continue to raise that specter to keep alive the myth of a \u201cstolen election. \u201d In the last days of the Obama administration, new rules were signed into law by Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the NSA Director as administrative amendments to Executive Order 12333, rules allowing the distribution of certain raw intelligence data to 16 additional government agencies at home and abroad. It may have been those new rules which facilitated the leaking of information concerning conversations Trump\u2019s nominee for   Mike Flynn, had with the Russian Ambassador \u2014  conversations which the FBI later said broke no laws. What this week\u2019s revelations show is not any Russian collusion with Trump to influence the election but nearly the exact opposite: elements of the Obama government colluded with intelligence agencies to spy on the Trump campaign \u2014  or at a minimum, to use information gathered by surveillance to attack and undermine the Trump campaign team\u2019s transition plans for an orderly changing of the guard. Opposition to Trump policies is to be expected, and   by hostile bureaucrats was not unknown in the first year of the Reagan administration and other governmental changeovers. But there are legitimate and lawful means of opposition and illegitimate ones \u2014  even illegal ones, like the leaking of classified information. If the   saboteurs inside government expect the American public and tens of millions of Trump supporters to tolerate organized, incipient treason against constitutional government, they are mistaken.'"}, "time": 1742564438.8336768}
