You remember the camera climbing, in black and white, up a rotating pair of torn,   Levis. You remember it seeming to take in the seat of the pants  \u2014   or seeming to let you take that in. You remember the annoying cut to a jukebox, against which leaned two pairs of legs: some lady\u2019s in blue heels, and another in blue denim and   cowboy boots  \u2014   a dude\u2019s. You remember the fade from the jukebox back to the rotating body, and the camera\u2019s revealing a man in a leather jacket and a white   with perfectly trimmed stubble, aviator sunglasses and a cross dangling from his left ear. Today, we\u2019d call that a lot of look. (The pompadour doesn\u2019t even arrive for another couple of shots.) But if you were around in 1987, you just called your friends and said, \u201cOh, my God. \u201d If you missed Elvis or James Dean or the Beatles, if you were immune to what they did to other people\u2019s hormones, maybe George Michael\u2019s \u201cFaith\u201d registered strongly on your superstar Richter scale. Maybe he triggered your gaydar, too. Mr. Michael, who died unexpectedly on Christmas Day, never had to say he was gay for his gayness to seem apparent and unabashed. Three years earlier, this same person could be seen hugging himself while singing into the camera as the   more freshly     blond in a   pop duo (Wham! with Andrew Ridgeley) whose sound was about as close as two white British boys could get to a black girl group from the 1960s. By 1987, Mr. Michael had become just fresh, switching personas from soft to hard, from exuberant cheerleader to butch troubadour. [ Read the obituary | Watch George Michael perform live ] Somehow, wagging his derri\u00e8re and begging for sex  \u2014   and sounding deeply soulful while he did it  \u2014   didn\u2019t make him a novelty act. It made him extremely famous. It was a pose he kept for about a year. By the time you saw him in 1988, swiveling through the video for \u201cMonkey,\u201d in suspenders and a bolero hat, he\u2019d  . Striking a pose is one thing. Holding it is something else. There weren\u2019t many major male pop stars who were openly gay back then. (Scarcely any are now. Elton John said he was bisexual in 1976, and officially stayed there for more than a decade. He could hold a pose.) Lots of men hinted. Lots of men messed around with masculinity, and not just the megastars. For every David Bowie or even Boy George, there was a Jermaine Stewart or a Good Question, many rungs down the fame ladder. And for reasons that make no cosmic sense, a few of those men  \u2014   Prince, David Bowie, Prince Be of P. M. Dawn, and now Mr. Michael  \u2014   died in 2016, a year in which dismaying ambivalence about aggressive, invasive male behavior was matched by the reinstatement of duller performances of masculinity in both our pop music and our politics. The Princes and the George Michaels seem as radical as ever. Some of the shock of seeing \u201cFaith\u201d for the first (or 10th) time was that, just that summer, the man in it was getting all kinds of kids in trouble for singing \u201cI Want Your Sex\u201d not far into the AIDS era. After that, we should have been ready for \u201cFaith. \u201d But \u201cI Want Your Sex\u201d kept to MTV\u2019s gender norms, in which videos objectified sexy women (in that case, the stunning Kathy Jeung). \u201cFaith\u201d seemed exhilaratingly dirty by those standards: Mr. Michael was objectifying himself. \u201cFaith\u201d isn\u2019t as great a video as it is a song or an album. But it\u2019s important. Its hotness gave Mr. Michael this new, macho self to work with: somewhere between leather bar opening act and the boyfriend that girls in teen comedies think they want. He seemed both dangerous and \u201cdangerous. \u201d But the pleading in his voice made you take him more seriously than you would a star whose new look was \u201csexy Village Person. \u201d Mr. Michael\u2019s artistry ensured he would never be received only as camp. He was too good. He was too rueful and needy. Under the jacket and the shades and the stubble and the hair was a human who ached. Mr. Michael had a pretty, plainly textured voice that could quickly flare outward, into regret or shame, just for a few bars, the way it does in the bridge for 1984\u2019s \u201cCareless Whisper,\u201d one of those apologetic slow jams with the evergreen wisdom of a psalm. It\u2019s clarifying to tally up all those excellent songs and discover just how many were about emotional desperation and sexual frustration (\u201cEverything She Wants,\u201d \u201cLast Christmas,\u201d \u201cFaith,\u201d \u201cFather Figure,\u201d \u201cHard Day,\u201d \u201cHand to Mouth,\u201d \u201cSomething to Save,\u201d \u201cToo Funky,\u201d \u201cOutside,\u201d to name just nine). The need for both liberty and intimacy also recur. So does the urge to let go or be released, to be truly seen and to give love. You don\u2019t always notice because Mr. Michael\u2019s singing smooths out any psychological cracks. He was ingenious with melody. There aren\u2019t that many pop stars with as many parts of as many songs that are as exciting to sing as George Michael has  \u2014   bridges, verses, the fillips he adds between the chorus during a  . \u201cFaith\u201d isn\u2019t just an album. It\u2019s a complex city of modern sound: a collection of songs, yes, and a skyline, too. But the psychological always tended to be present. The church organ at the beginning of that \u201cFaith\u201d video is playing the chorus of Wham! \u2019s \u201cFreedom. \u201d He sang about wanting to be free often enough to make you wonder whether he thought any freedom was ever attainable. He seemed to come to resent his fame. David Fincher\u2019s video for another \u201cFreedom\u201d  \u2014   \u201cFreedom! \u201990\u201d  \u2014   amounts to Mr. Michael\u2019s changing his mind about 1987. The stars of the video are Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Christy Turlington, Tatjana Patitz and Linda Evangelista  \u2014   supermodels  \u2014   not Mr. Michael, who\u2019s conspicuous by his absence yet represented by the demolition of that jukebox and the immolation of the leather jacket. He was rejecting \u201cFaith,\u201d and it was heretical. \u201cFreedom! \u201990\u201d appears on \u201cListen Without Prejudice Vol. 1,\u201d the album with Mr. Michael\u2019s strongest singing. There are want, hurt, protest and artistic risk. Prince, Mr. Bowie and Michael Jackson were theatrical performers. This was the first time Mr. Michael allowed himself to sound theatrical, too. The lyrics are explicitly personal, if poetically implicit. The record rejects the perfect pop songwriting of \u201cFaith\u201d and replaces a lot of the danciness of that album with gospel. It holds up as a work of art as well as the previous record holds up as an achievement of commercial intelligence. Those other men who died this year  \u2014   Mr. Bowie and Prince and Prince Be  \u2014   also managed to do interesting stuff with race: to sing black music while white to be a   black guitarist in any genre to be a fat, bohemian rapper who sang. For all Mr. Michael did to make gayness interesting and less threatening, he might have done more to help erase a barrier between who should and should not sing soul music. In his prime, he was a relatively frictionless ambassador among the races. He didn\u2019t cross all the way over, as Teena Marie did. He didn\u2019t \u201csound black. \u201d He sounded like himself  \u2014   and that was enough to land him near the top of the black music charts. \u201cI Knew You Were Waiting for Me,\u201d from 1987, is still the best Aretha Franklin duet. Mr. Michael\u2019s black support was never an exploitative exhortation. It was never \u201cGo, white boy! Go, white boy! Go!\u201d It was: \u201cOh, he gets it. \u201d And by 2016, he wasn\u2019t done mattering. Last spring, Key  Peele\u2019s stoner,    comedy, \u201cKeanu,\u201d came and went. But there\u2019s a running gag that\u2019s stayed with me. It\u2019s just three Los Angeles thugs and one uptight bureaucrat named Clarence (Keegan Michael Key) pretending to be a thug (long story a good one, though) chilling in Clarence\u2019s minivan. To pass the time, they turn to the fake thug\u2019s iPhone for music, and up comes George Michael\u2019s \u201cFreedom! \u201990. \u201d One dude says, \u201cThat sounds kinda white. \u201d And Clarence begins a quick defense of his taste, studded with the   that also makes a flashy British pop star sound like a gangsta from Crenshaw. The sequence culminates with their being oblivious to the shootout in the house they\u2019re parked in front of, belting \u201cOne More Try\u201d like a pack of wolves baying at the moon. For about 25 minutes, \u201cKeanu\u201d is smarter than the bad action comedy it turns out to be. And one thing it\u2019s brilliant about is the partial meaning of George Michael. Who knows if Mr. Michael found that annoying. Who knows if he was aware that \u201cKeanu\u201d existed. But the crush this movie has on him is the crush almost everybody did. At some point, Clarence takes a hit of some hot new street drug, and the first place his high takes him is dancing with Mr. Michael in the \u201cFaith\u201d video. He\u2019s up where even Mr. Michael\u2019s slowest, saddest music could take you. He\u2019s in heaven.'"}, "time": 1742564087.2384672}
