And it\u2019s not an easy task.\u201d \\nNo doubt. Most people are \u201cstuck\u201d believing boys are boys and girls are girls. \\nAdams argues that those who hold to such beliefs are the ones with the problem. She recently helped \u201cMr. Love\u201d \u2014 a female who is \u201ctransitioning\u201d to a male \u2014 become one of the first of these \u201ctransgender\u201d students at Fresno State to change her name on her student ID card. This is considered \u201ca huge victory\u201d by Adams because, she claimed, \u201cYou feel fraudulent as a person, yet no one is allowing you to be who you are. If you can imagine being called the wrong name for the rest of your life, or even for a day.\u2026 If you kept telling them and they refused to acknowledge that, that\u2019s painful.\u201d \\n\u201cMr. Love\u201d is transitioning by taking natural supplements, rather than testosterone injections. But this is not her first \u201ctransition.\u201d In the past, she was, at one time, \u201cbisexual,\u201d and has suffered from anxiety and depression. In fact, Mr. Love (shown) reacted to the tragic news that 49 people were murdered by an Islamic terrorist in Orlando by considering suicide. \\n\u201cIt was all just too much,\u201d Mr. Love recalled. \u201cI wanted to die.\u201d One survey has found that more than 40 percent of transgender people have attempted suicide. In a study conducted by The New Atlantis , sex \u201creassigned individuals were about 5 times more likely to attempt suicide and about 19 times more likely to die by suicide.\u201d Whatever the exact figures, it is obvious that these are deeply mentally disturbed individuals. \\nAfter writing a suicide note to some friends, Mr. Love was forced into an ambulance and transported to a mental health center in Fresno. But what really upset her was when she looked down and saw the name on the plastic medical bracelet. They had use Mr. Love\u2019s birth name, instead of Mr. Love. \\nIt was an Aztec female name, meaning \u201cgoddess of music and dance.\u201d \\nMr. Love explained, \u201cYou have to realize every time you say it, it\u2019s going to be like knives to the heart.\u201d \\nTo those in the \u201ctransgender community,\u201d birth names that identify the person as male, when he wants to be known as a female, or identify the person as female (as in the case of Mr. Love) when a transgender individual wishes to be known as a male, are referred to as \u201cdead names.\u201d \\nSometimes Mr. Love uses the name of Alex, because it is more gender neutral. \\nWhen Mr. Love was a high-school student at Clovis United, the school board refused to adopt a gender-neutral dress code. Boys and girls who supported the transgender students swapped clothes as a protest against school policy. Although no federal statute exists that requires local school districts to allow transgender males into girl\u2019s locker rooms, and vice-versa, the Obama administration has told schools across the country they will either do so, or face the loss of federal funds. \\nThe Charlotte Observer recently editorialized in favor of allowing transgenders to use the bathroom they identify with, and not their biologically appropriate one. The paper dismissed concerns that sexual predators could use trangender-oriented \u201cbathroom laws. Besides, the paper lectured, \u201cThe thought of male genitalia in girls\u2019s locker rooms \u2014 and vice versa \u2014 might be distressing to some. But the battle for equality has always been in part about overcoming discomfort.\u201d \\nSo according to the Charlotte Observer , anyone who opposes a naked boy strolling into a shower full of naked girls is no better than a segregationist. After all, it was discomforting to a white bigot to be around black people, and opposition to transgenders using the bathroom of the opposite sex, well, that is a bigoted stance, too. \\nOf course, a similar opposing argument would have just as much, or more, logical validity: Maybe transgenders should get used to the \"discomfort\" of being naked around their own biological sex and that to do otherwise, and force their nakedness on the unwilling, opposite sex, is akin to sexual assault. \\nAlthough Mr. Love wants to be recognized as a man, she wants to keep her mezzo-soprano voice (considered one of the highest female singing voices). \u201cI\u2019ve come to terms with my voice. My voice is everything, it\u2019s all I have,\u201d Mr. Love said. \\nMr. Love insists that she is a man, trapped in a biological woman\u2019s body, and that she cannot help it. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask for this life. I didn\u2019t choose it. I really didn\u2019t.\u201d \\nBut a recent study in The New Atlantis journal concluded that trangenderism is not supported by the science. The report was co-authored by Dr. Paul McHugh, who is the former Chief of Pyschiatry at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cExamining research from the biological, psychological, and social sciences, this report shows that some of the most frequently heard claims about sexuality and gender are not supported by scientific evidence. The hypothesis that gender identiy is an innate, fixed property of human beings that is independent of biological sex \u2014 that a person might be \u2018a man trapped in a woman\u2019s body\u2019 or \u2018a woman trapped in a man\u2019s body\u2019 \u2014 is not supported by scientific evidence,\u201d insisted the researchers. \\nBut it is not just that the acceptance of transgenderism (one will note that the mainstream media dutifully calls a transgender person by the pronoun that person prefers) is unscientific. The report argues that such enabling is harmful. \u201cAn area of particular concern involves medical interventions for gender-nonconforming youth. They are increasingly receiving therapies that affirm their felt genders, and even hormone treatments or surgical modifications at young ages.\u201d \\nIn a statement released in March by the American College of Pediatricians, a similar conclusion was reached. The report was entitled \u201cGender Ideology Harms Children,\u201d and in it, they assert that taking \u201cgender dysphoria\u201d as anything other than a psychological problem is harmful. \\nOne woman, Cari Stella, took to YouTube to describe how this ideologically driven movement harmed her. \u201cI am a real, live 22-year-old woman, with a scarred chest and a broken voice, and five o\u2019clock shadow because I couldn\u2019t face the idea of growing up to be a woman. That\u2019s my reality.\u2026 When I was transitioning, I felt a strong desire \u2014 what I could have called a \u2018need\u2019 at the time \u2014 to transition.\u201d \\nBut the transition only worsened her mental health. \u201cTestosterone made me even more disassociated than I already was.\u201d \\nStella\u2019s situation is an example of an observation made in The New Atlantis study: \u201cThe potential that patients undergoing medical and surgical sex reassignment may want to return to a gender identity consistent with their biological sex suggests that reassignment carries considerable psychological and physical risk.\u201d The report concluded that the promotion of transgenderism is influenced more by politics and the culture than by science. \\nOn the Carol Burnett Show , Vikki Lawrence once performed a skit where she portrayed a mother with an infant child. When someone asked the common question, \u201cIs the baby a boy or a girl?\u201d Lawrence effected offense, answering, \u201cThis is 1970! The baby can make that decision at age 21.\u201d \\nOf course, the audience predictably guffawed at the absurdity of it all. But that was 1970. Now, in 2016, such a skit on television would probably lead to boycotts and condemnations from our modern \u201cprogressive\u201d society.  '"}, "time": 1742564593.9055967}
