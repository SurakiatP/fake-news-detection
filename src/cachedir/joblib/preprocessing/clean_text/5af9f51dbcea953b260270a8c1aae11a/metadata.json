One of the methods used was a \u201ctelegram\u201d app, an encrypted messaging service that ISIS often uses and is generally the first place the group takes credit for terror attacks.  The terror group named several prominent members of the Muslim community in both Germany and Austria as potential targets for assassination in an article entitled \u201cKill the infidel imams in Germany and Austria. \u201d Among the targets listed is Aiman Mazyek,   of the Central Council of Muslims in Germany. Mazyek has made controversial statements in the past, such as calling for German leaders to limit the number of migrants flowing into the country in late 2015. The Muslim leader has also slammed the   migration Alternative for Germany (AfD) likening them to Nazis after they revealed a platform of   last year. Omar   a Vienna city councilman for the Socialist Party (SP\u00d6) and a member of the Council Committee on European and International Affairs was also listed as a target.   is also no stranger to controversy  \u2014   in 2010 he led an official condemnation of Israel in the Vienna city hall over the Israeli raids on a flotilla heading for Gaza, which Israeli authorities claimed was not the  humanitarian mission activists stated it to be.   also led a protest against Israel in Vienna. Among the demonstrators were members of the Turkish   nationalist group the Grey Wolves who have clashed with Kurds in Germany and have been accused of trying to infiltrate German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party through its diversity program. Killing Imams they don\u2019t agree with is nothing new for the Islamic State. In 2014 ISIS executed 13 clerics in the city of Mosul whom they deemed to be too moderate. Imam Muhammad al Mansuri was one of the victims of the terror group and was the imam in charge of the mosque in which ISIS leader     gave a rare public appearance to lead prayers. Islamic State killed a further six imams in early 2015 after they condemned the group\u2019s actions when they burned Jordanian pilot Mu\u2019ath Kasasbeh alive.
