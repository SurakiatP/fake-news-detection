But late last month, dismayed over the Trump administration\u2019s apparent disdain for evidence on climate change and other issues, Dr. Eisen registered the Twitter handle @SenatorPhD and declared his intention to run in the 2018 election for a seat in the United States Senate from California. His campaign slogan: \u201cLiberty, Equality, Reality. \u201d \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m the best vehicle for this,\u201d said Dr. Eisen, whose professional attire consists of shorts and   bearing mottos supporting open access to scientific literature, a cause he has championed. \u201cBut if we want to defend the role of science in policy making, scientists need to run for office. \u201d Since Mr. Trump\u2019s election, many other scientists have expressed concern about rumors and public statements on the new administration\u2019s views on science, climate change and the role of federal offices like the Environmental Protection Agency. Mr. Trump has called climate change a hoax (although more recently said he would have an \u201copen mind\u201d about it) and appointed some officials to his transition team who dispute mainstream climate science. But there is much that is still unclear about his administration\u2019s attitudes toward science. The president has yet to appoint a science adviser and has not responded to open letters calling on him to do so from science policy groups including the American Association for the Advancement of Science (whose president, Rush D. Holt, is a physicist and former congressman). Few scientists have gone as far as Dr. Eisen, but other researchers are now undergoing a political awakening, contemplating what their role should be for at least the next few years. \u201cThere are many conversations going on right now,\u201d said Naomi Oreskes, a historian of science at Harvard who spoke at one of the first     protests, a rally in San Francisco during the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union in December. \u201cMany scientists do feel that the time for sitting on the sidelines is past. \u201d A political action committee that seeks to get more scientists and engineers to run for elective office, 314 Action, has seen a surge of interest in its programs, with more than 2, 000 people registering at its website. The group is planning a training program for   whether they want to run for local or state offices or Congress. Other scientists have organized demonstrations  \u2014   including a march now set for Earth Day, April 22  \u2014   submitted letters or opinion articles to news organizations or joined efforts to preserve government data that they fear may otherwise disappear. Individuals and groups have also spoken out against Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order restricting travel for citizens of Iran, Iraq and five other countries, an action that has affected some researchers. But an activist role is not an easy fit for many scientists. \u201cI have plenty of colleagues who say, \u2018Leave me alone in my lab,\u2019\u201d said Jonathan Overpeck, director of the Institute for the Environment at the University of Arizona. Still, he has seen more scientists take at least the first steps toward mobilization. \u201cRight now it\u2019s mostly talking about what to do,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re scientists  \u2014   we tend to plan very carefully what we do and then we try to do it well. But certainly there\u2019s an elevated sense that this is very real. \u201d That sense has motivated hundreds of student and faculty volunteers at nearly a dozen universities to participate in \u201cdata rescue\u201d events over the last two months, the most recent of which was held this weekend at New York University. After a brief training session, participants spent six hours archiving environmental data from government websites, including those of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Interior Department. An anonymous donor has provided storage on Amazon servers, and the information can be searched from a website at the University of Pennsylvania called Data Refuge. Though the Federal Records Act theoretically protects government data from deletion, scientists who rely on it say would rather be safe than sorry. \u201cFor a problem like climate change, you can\u2019t understand it if you don\u2019t have data,\u201d said Jerome Whitington, an environmental anthropologist and member of the   group Environmental Data Governance Initiative, which sponsored the N. Y. U. event. Much of the concern among scientists has been centered on the E. P. A. which was a favorite target of Mr. Trump during the campaign. Comments by members of his transition team have led to speculation that the new administration would gut the agency\u2019s science staff. Although he said he was speaking only for himself, Myron Ebell, who headed the E. P. A. transition but left on Jan. 19, said in a recent interview that science within the agency had become too politicized. \u201cI\u2019m a great believer in science,\u201d Mr. Ebell said, \u201cbut I\u2019m not a great believer in politicized science. \u201d Many scientists would argue that it is climate deniers and others who are politicized. The question of whether scientists should take sides politically is an old one, with the widespread and   view among many researchers that they should be quiet and let their data speak for itself. Some scientists have objected to plans for the Washington march, arguing that the event will feed the view among many conservatives that scientists have a political agenda. But the idea that they should be above the fray has been slowly unraveling as researchers realize that their own aloofness may largely be to blame for public disregard for the evidence on issues like climate change or vaccine safety. And in the era of Trump, some say it could finally come completely apart. \u201cI think that many people have moved well beyond that,\u201d said Andrew Rosenberg, director of the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, which is enlisting scientists to monitor what is occurring in federal agencies. \u201cIt\u2019s nonsense  \u2014   you need to follow your own heart. You can do science and still be a good citizen. \u201d Youth is leading the way in rejecting the old view, Mr. Rosenberg said. \u201cEarly career scientists, younger scientists  \u2014   that\u2019s not an answer for them,\u201d he said. Chanda   a cosmologist and particle physicist at the University of Washington, is one of those younger researchers. She has long been politically active  \u2014   she comes from a family of organizers and attended her first demonstration when she was 2 months old  \u2014   but for her the talk and actions of the Trump administration have led to a new level of concern. Dr.   said she was especially incensed by what she and others viewed as efforts by some science organizations to reach out to the Trump administration. Immediately after the election, she took to social media to criticize a news release from the American Physical Society that urged President Trump to strengthen scientific leadership and quoted his campaign slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again. \u201d \u201cWhat history has taught us is that collaboration doesn\u2019t work for science,\u201d Dr.   said. \u201cWhen we work with extremist, racist, Islamophobic or nationalist governments, it doesn\u2019t work for science. \u201d The news release was quickly withdrawn and the society apologized for any \u201coffense it might have caused. \u201d Michael Lubell, a physics professor who was director of public affairs for the society but who was terminated without explanation, said that \u201cinitially people were very worried that if anybody criticized Donald Trump there would be retribution. \u201d \u201cPeople are now getting to the point where they are understanding that this is a guy in the White House who doesn\u2019t have a firm grasp on science policy at all,\u201d Dr. Lubell said. \u201cNow they are mobilizing. But there\u2019s absolutely no strategy. \u201d Dr. Eisen, the Berkeley biologist, would seem to have slim chances of winning a race for the Senate, since it is sure to be joined by several prominent Democrats if Dianne Feinstein, the longtime incumbent, decides not to run. But Jacquelyn Gill, a   at the University of Maine\u2019s Climate Change Institute, has been actively recruited to  \u2014   eventually  \u2014   make a bid for a congressional seat by 314 Action, ever since she was quoted in the journal Nature urging her fellow scientists to \u201cdo more than write letters. \u201d Staff members at 314 Action (which takes its name from the number pi) liked her attitude, and she happens to live in a swing district. Like many academic scientists, Dr. Gill employs several graduate students in her laboratory and has received grant funds for research that is still in progress. But the idea of public service, at what she considers an urgent time for climate science, is tugging at her. \u201cI came into this career wanting to do science that\u2019s in the public good,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd maybe now that means something different than it did before. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563409.0848787}
