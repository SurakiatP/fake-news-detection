[In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph to promote his latest animated film, The Boss Baby, the    actor said that people had approached him after the election to tell him that his impression helped smooth out Trump\u2019s edges and had helped \u201chumanize\u201d him.  \u201cThere were people who came to me after the election and said, \u2018Well, how do you feel that you are, to some degree, responsible for Trump winning the election? \u2019\u201d he told the outlet. \u201cI thought they were kidding, but they said, \u2018You humanised him. You took the edges off and made him more personable. \u2019\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t agree with that,\u201d he added. Baldwin debuted as Trump during the 42nd season premiere of SNL in October last year. The show\u2019s skits initially mocked the debates between Trump and former Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, and after Trump won, they took aim at the president\u2019s penchant for tweeting and for his confrontation with the 9th Circuit Court over his executive orders on immigration. Baldwin has previously said that playing Trump is \u201cnot always fun,\u201d and recently said he planned to retire the impression in the near future. \u201cAs an actor who studies other people, I was completely convinced that when Trump won, he would completely transform himself,\u201d the actor told the Telegraph. \u201cLike in sports, when you beat the hell out of somebody and you win, you shake hands, maybe have a beer together, and you\u2019re a more polite, obliging person. But with Trump, there was none of that. \u201d \u201cHe was as bitter and miserable after he won as he was before. That is a complete mystery to me,\u201d he added. Offscreen, Baldwin has been a fierce critic of the president. On the eve of Trump\u2019s inauguration, the actor appeared at a rally outside Trump Tower in Manhattan alongside other   celebrities including Michael Moore, Robert De Niro and Mark Ruffalo. Baldwin has also teased Trump on Twitter. But the actor says that despite his skewering of the president, he does not see his impression as being part of a larger \u201cresistance\u201d against Trump. \u201cPeople thank me for \u2018the resistance\u2019 that I\u2019m participating in, but I don\u2019t see it that way,\u201d he told the Telegraph. \u201cI don\u2019t mind if people do, but I don\u2019t do it for that reason. I do it to entertain people. It\u2019s purely about entertainment. \u201d   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum'"}, "time": 1742628382.2369719}
