Vance that drew so much traffic it briefly crippled the central nervous system of the magazine\u2019s website. The interviewer\u2019s last line implored readers to have a look at Mr. Vance\u2019s publishing debut, \u201cHillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis. \u201d Ever since, his book has hovered at high altitude on Amazon, seldom dipping below No. 10. After reading \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d you can easily understand why. This is a historically peculiar election cycle, boisterously disrupted by outsiders, one of whom found the perfect host body in the Republican Party and became its presidential nominee. An investigation of voter estrangement has never felt more urgent, and we\u2019re certainly not getting one from the lacquered chatterers on the boob tube. Now, along comes Mr. Vance, offering a compassionate, discerning sociological analysis of the white underclass that has helped drive the politics of rebellion, particularly the ascent of Donald J. Trump. Combining thoughtful inquiry with firsthand experience, Mr. Vance has inadvertently provided a civilized reference guide for an uncivilized election, and he\u2019s done so in a vocabulary intelligible to both Democrats and Republicans. Imagine that. On the checklist of modern privilege, Mr. Vance, 31, has the top four in the bag: He is white, male, straight and Protestant. But his profile is misleading. His people  \u2014   hillbillies, rednecks, white trash, choose your epithet (or term of affection, depending on your point of view)  \u2014   didn\u2019t step off the Mayflower and become part of America\u2019s ascendant class. \u201cPoverty is the family tradition,\u201d he writes. His ancestors and kin were sharecroppers, coal miners, machinists, millworkers  \u2014   all     occupations that over the years have vanished or offered diminished security. Mr. Vance was raised in Middletown, Ohio, a   steel town filled with Kentucky transplants, which at one point included his Mamaw and Papaw  \u2014   in newscaster English, that\u2019s grandma and grandpa  \u2014   who moved there shortly after World War II. Though the couple eventually managed to achieve the material comforts of a   life (house, car) they brought their Appalachian values and habits with them. Some were wonderfully positive, like loyalty and love of country. But others, like a tendency toward violence and verbal abuse, were inimical to family life. Papaw was forever coming home drunk. Mamaw, \u201ca violent nondrunk,\u201d was forever tormenting him, whether by serving him artfully arranged plates of garbage for dinner or dousing him with gasoline. All this guerrilla warfare affected their children. Mr. Vance\u2019s mother was an empress of instability  \u2014   violent, feckless, prone to hysteria. A long stint in rehab couldn\u2019t shake her addiction to prescription narcotics (she\u2019d later move on to heroin). She spun through more boyfriends than this reader could count and at least five husbands. The only reason Mr. Vance made it out in one piece is because his grandparents eventually reconciled, becoming his unofficial guardians. (He also spent a terrifically affirming four years in the Marines.) Mamaw was especially encouraging. She was tough as snakeskin,   as a mobster and filled with love. In a town where many children don\u2019t finish high school, she raised a grandson who managed to graduate from Ohio State University and Yale Law School, defying skyscraping odds. \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d in my mind, divides into two components: the family stories Mr. Vance tells  \u2014   most of which are no doubt better experienced on the page than they were in real life  \u2014   and the questions he raises. Chief among them: How much should he hold his hillbilly kin responsible for their own misfortunes? In Mr. Vance\u2019s estimation, the answer is: a lot. Economic insecurity, he\u2019s convinced, accounts for only a small part of his community\u2019s problems the much larger issue is hillbilly culture itself. Though proud of it in many ways, he\u2019s also convinced that it \u201cincreasingly encourages social decay instead of counteracting it. \u201d His frustration with the nonworking white poor is especially acute. He recalls being a cashier at a Middletown grocery store and watching resentfully as his neighbors, who had creatively gamed the welfare system, jabbered on their cellphones as they were going through the checkout line. He could not afford a cellphone. \u201cPolitical scientists have spent millions of words trying to explain how Appalachia and the South went from staunchly Democratic to staunchly Republican in less than a generation,\u201d Mr. Vance writes. He suspects those cellphones have a lot to do with it. \u201cI could never understand why our lives felt like a struggle while those living off of government largess enjoyed trinkets that I only dreamed about. \u201d Time and again, Mr. Vance preaches a message of tough love and personal responsibility. He has no patience with an old acquaintance who told him he quit his job because he hated waking up early, only to take to Facebook to blame the \u201cObama economy. \u201d Or with a former   at a tile warehouse who missed work once a week though his girlfriend was pregnant. Squint, and you\u2019ll note the incendiary nature of Mr. Vance\u2019s argument. It\u2019s always treacherous business to blame a group for its own misfortunes. Certainly, an outsider cannot say what Mr. Vance is saying to his kin and kind. But he can  \u2014   just as President Obama can say to fellow   \u201cbrothers should pull up their pants,\u201d as he did on MTV. The difference is that President Obama believes poverty, though it may have a cultural component, is largely a structural problem, one the government can play a large role in fixing. Mr. Vance, a conservative, takes a far dimmer view. Whether you agree with Mr. Vance or not, you must admire him for his   confrontation with a taboo subject. And he frames his critique generously, stipulating that it isn\u2019t laziness that\u2019s destroying hillbilly culture but what the psychologist Martin Seligman calls \u201clearned helplessness\u201d  \u2014   the fatalistic belief, born of too much adversity, that nothing can be done to change your lot. What he\u2019s really writing about is despair. Never is Mr. Vance more aware of this pessimism and estrangement than when he leaves for Ohio State University. He\u2019s plumped with hope his neighbors, left behind, feel its opposite. \u201cThere was something almost spiritual,\u201d he writes, \u201cabout the cynicism of the community at large. \u201d His friends and relations are convinced that the media lies. That politicians lie. That the military, an institution they revere, is fighting two fruitless wars. Universities feel \u201crigged\u201d and inaccessible job prospects are slim. For what purpose do you live under such circumstances? When the stanchions of your life have sunk into the muck? Mr. Vance doesn\u2019t have all the answers. But he\u2019s advancing the conversation.'"}, "time": 1742561704.2272806}
