S. citizens are in denial over the true nature of Islam by refusing to acknowledge its inherent ties to violent jihad. [Responding to a recent CBS poll that found that the majority of Democrats believe that Islam is no more violent than Christianity, Sam Rohrer said that many Americans are confused about the Muslim faith and the teachings of the Qur\u2019an.  \u201cThe view for a long time has been that jihadists, wherever they are, are not at all reflective of Islam, and these are only a small number, who don\u2019t speak for Islam,\u201d Rohrer said in an interview with the Christian Post. \u201cThe unfortunate thing about that is that those involved in jihad are the only ones who are really practicing what the Qur\u2019an says,\u201d he said. Last week\u2019s CBS poll found that only 33 percent of respondents believe that the Muslim religion encourages violence more so than other religions, a view that Rohrer described as a \u201cpurposeful denial of facts. \u201d Those who do not recognize that Islam is more prone to terrorism and violence either haven\u2019t \u201cdone their homework,\u201d or are ignoring the truth, he said. Rohrer argued that public opinion on Islam is tied to a religious relativism that assumes that \u201call people worship the same God, or there is no God, or all gods are equal. \u201d It is a \u201cgreat mistake\u201d to believe that Islam is first and foremost a religion, like Christianity or Judaism, he suggested. \u201cThat is totally wrong, because Islam is primarily a political, legal system. It has religious tenets, but it is a political system accompanied by Sharia law,\u201d he said. \u201cBy its very commandments,\u201d he said, Sharia prohibits Islam from peacefully coexisting with others. Rohrer\u2019s remarks echoed statements from the Islamic State terror group itself, which has publicly rejected claims that its war on the   West is not religiously motivated. In an issue of its online propaganda magazine, Dabiq, ISIS criticized Pope Francis last summer for his na\u00efvet\u00e9 in clinging to the conviction that Muslims want peace and that acts of Islamic terror are economically rather than religiously motivated. \u201cThis is a   war between the Muslim nation and the nations of disbelief,\u201d the authors stated in an article titled \u201cBy the Sword. \u201d The Islamic State attacked Francis for claiming that \u201cauthentic Islam and the proper reading of the Quran are opposed to every form of violence. \u201d Pope Francis \u201chas struggled against reality\u201d in his efforts to portray Islam as a religion of peace, the article insists, before going on to urge all Muslims to take up the sword of jihad, the \u201cgreatest obligation\u201d of a true Muslim. Last spring, noted Georgetown University scholar Father James V. Schall SJ published an essay arguing that Islam has consistently advocated violence \u201cfrom its seventh century beginning,\u201d and that the purpose of violent jihad is \u201cultimately, religious and pious. \u201d In his article, Schall contended that Islam has been \u201cviolent throughout its entire history,\u201d and that the motivation for its violence \u201cis obedience to the Law of Allah. \u201d \u201cWhat we see now is little different from what has been seen throughout the centuries wherever Islam is found,\u201d he wrote. Many Westerners mistakenly assume that Islam is not violent, because all religions should be peaceful by their nature, Schall stated. Yet just because Islam is a \u201creligion,\u201d he argued, does not mean that it is therefore not \u201cviolent. \u201d Schall said that \u201cwhile it may be politically incorrect to state these things, they need to be stated and are in fact the truth. \u201d \u201cThe designated and determined goal of the conquest of the world for Allah has been reinvigorated again and again in world history from the time of Mohammed in the seventh century,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThese revivals and expansions, which have only been temporarily halted by superior counterforce, have roots in the Qur\u2019an itself and in its commentaries,\u201d he said.
