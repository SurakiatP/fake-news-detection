[\u201cIn June 2016, Zuckerberg constructed a   wall along part of his property, despite protests from locals, who called it a \u2018monstrosity\u2019 and not neighborly,\u201d wrote McClatchyDC. \u201cNow, more than six months later, around 200 locals are expected to march in protest along the wall this Saturday. \u201d  Numerous locals have also \u201cattempted to use an old trail that passes through the property, only to be harassed and intimidated by security,\u201d according to the site. \u201cSome have even filed police complaints. \u201d \u201cAlthough Zuckerberg owns control over the land, he is not the only one with rights to it,\u201d they continued. \u201cIn particular, several parcels of land, totaling less than eight acres of the 700, belong in part to families who inherited the land through the Kuleana Act, a    Hawaiian law. \u201d \u201cPeople are furious down here with him,\u201d said protest organizer and farmer Joe Hart. \u201cWe just want to bring this issue to light. He\u2019s made his money stealing everyone\u2019s information, which we\u2019ve let him do, but to come down here and start suing everyone, that\u2019s not going to fly down here. \u201d \u201cWe were walking along [a beach] and they tried to say that this was private,\u201d Hart continued. \u201cI\u2019ve been walking on this since I was a little kid. \u201d Zuckerberg defended his Hawaiian estate in a post to Facebook last week, claiming, \u201cThere have been some misleading stories going around today about our plans in Hawaii. \u201d \u201cWe are working with a professor of native Hawaiian studies and long time member of this community, who is participating in this quiet title process with us,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote. \u201cIt is important to us that we respect Hawaiian history and traditions. We love Hawaii and we want to be good members of the community and preserve the environment. We look forward to working closely with the community for years to come. \u201d Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
