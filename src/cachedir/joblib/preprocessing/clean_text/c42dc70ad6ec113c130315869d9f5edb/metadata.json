However, the manner in which he did it has the Department of Justice\u2019s former chief spokesman up in arms . \\nRead part of the letter here, via NBC News\u2019 Bradd Jaffy. FBI Director Comey, in letter to members of Congress, says FBI is investigating additional emails in Clinton private server case pic.twitter.com/Ue0qlhqT5w \\n\u2014 Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) October 28, 2016 \\nWhen Matthew Miller, the head of the DOJ\u2019s office of public affairs from 2008 to 2011, learned about this letter, he hit the ceiling. In an epic tweetstorm, Miller slammed Comey\u2019s decision to make this disclosure in the manner that he did. This is such an inappropriate public disclosure by Comey. And sadly the latest in a long string of them. https://t.co/8MgrH9UKlR \\n\u2014 Matthew Miller (@matthewamiller) October 28, 2016 Comey refused to even tell Congress if FBI was investigating Trump camp for Russia hack, but regular updates on Clinton are apparently A-ok. \\n\u2014 Matthew Miller (@matthewamiller) October 28, 2016 \\nEarlier this summer, Miller had criticized the tone of Comey\u2019s press conference announcing that there was no basis for criminal charges against Hillary. In an op-ed for The Washington Post, Miller said that Comey\u2019s decision to \u201ceditorialize\u201d Hillary\u2019s behavior was \u201cnot grounded in any position in law.\u201d In his Friday tweetstorm, Miller blasted the FBI for sending details of the investigation to Congress. He flagrantly violated DOJ rules with his press conference. Then went on to break new ground discussing details of the case to Congress\u20262/ \\n\u2014 Matthew Miller (@matthewamiller) October 28, 2016 Followed by quickly releasing FBI 302's, something they rarely do, and which I doubt they will do for future high-profile cases. 3/ \\n\u2014 Matthew Miller (@matthewamiller) October 28, 2016 \\nTo Miller\u2019s mind, this paled in comparison to the decision to publicly disclose this latest discovery, given that we are less than two weeks from Election Day. But today's disclosure might be worst abuse yet. DOJ goes out of its way to avoid publicly discussing investigations close to election. 5/ \\n\u2014 Matthew Miller (@matthewamiller) October 28, 2016 Not just public discussion either. Often won't send subpoenas or take other steps that might leak until after an election is over\u20266/ \\n\u2014 Matthew Miller (@matthewamiller) October 28, 2016 Why? Because voters have no way to interpret FBI/DOJ activity in a neutral way. Who is the target of an investigation? What conduct? 7/ \\n\u2014 Matthew Miller (@matthewamiller) October 28, 2016 This might be totally benign & not even involve Clinton. But no way for press or voters to know that. Easy for opponent to make hay over. 8/ \\n\u2014 Matthew Miller (@matthewamiller) October 28, 2016 Which takes us back to the original rule: you don't comment on ongoing investigations. Then multiply that times ten close to an election. 9/ \\n\u2014 Matthew Miller (@matthewamiller) October 28, 2016 \\n\\nMiller\u2019s hunch was confirmed later in the day as more details dribbled out. It turns out that the FBI discovered these emails while investigating former Congressman Anthony Weiner for inappropriate texts with a minor. The emails were found on a device Weiner shared with his estranged wife, longtime Hillary aide Huma Abedin. \\nAccording to NBC News\u2019 Pete Williams, however, there doesn\u2019t appear to be anything that even comes close to a smoking gun\u2013at least for now. Williams discussed his findings on MSNBC on Friday afternoon; watch here, via Jaffy\u2019s Twitter. NBC\u2019s Pete Williams: Sr. officials say\u2014During separate investigation \u201ca device\u201d led to add'l emails\u2013not from Clinton https://t.co/QmmNoxXhOx \\n\u2014 Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) October 28, 2016 \\nWilliams went further in another MSNBC interview later in the afternoon; watch here. \\nWilliams believes that there are two questions\u2013whether the number of emails changed, and whether anyone withheld evidence. His FBI sources tell him that those emails were not withheld by Hillary or her campaign. Moreover, the emails are not from Hillary. That raises the obvious question\u2013was there any defensible reason to make such a disclosure? \\nMiller thinks there wasn\u2019t, and told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper so later that afternoon. Watch here. \\nMiller said that longstanding DOJ practice calls for the department and its various agencies to avoid doing anything that could potentially influence the results of an election within 60 days of Election Day. When Tapper asked Miller if the FBI could have been accused of bias toward Hillary had Comey remained silent, Miller said he didn\u2019t think so in this case because \u201cthere\u2019s no information to be released.\u201d That letter never disclosed what triggered this new review, and thus forces Hillary to \u201cdefend against a negative.\u201d \\nUnderstandably, Hillary\u2019s campaign wants to know that justified this disclosure from the FBI. Campaign chairman John Podesta issued a burning statement demanding answers from the FBI.
