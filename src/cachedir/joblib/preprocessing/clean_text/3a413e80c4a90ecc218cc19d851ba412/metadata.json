The biased media is predictably spinning this as the FBI being in the wrong and Hillary's backers at the DOJ being in the right. \\nBut it also appears that the DOJ was obstructing any investigations of Hillary. Including that of the Clinton Foundation. \\nThe FBI field office in New York had done the most work on the Clinton Foundation case and received help from the FBI field office in Little Rock, the people familiar with the matter said. \\nIn February, FBI officials made a presentation to the Justice Department, according to these people. By all accounts, the meeting didn\u2019t go well. \\nSome said that is because the FBI didn\u2019t present compelling evidence to justify more aggressive pursuit of the Clinton Foundation, and that the career public integrity prosecutors in the room simply believed it wasn\u2019t a very strong case. Others said that from the start, the Justice Department officials were stern, icy and dismissive of the case. \\n\u201cThat was one of the weirdest meetings I\u2019ve ever been to,\u201d one participant told others afterward, according to people familiar with the matter. \\nJustice Department officials told the FBI at the meeting they wouldn\u2019t authorize more aggressive investigative techniques, such as subpoenas, formal witness interviews, or grand-jury activity. But the FBI officials believed they were well within their authority to pursue the leads and methods already under way, these people said. \\nOf course the DOJ wouldn't authorize investigations of the Democratic Party's chosen. That's the type of elemental corruption at work in the system.\""}, "time": 1742564072.4339736}
