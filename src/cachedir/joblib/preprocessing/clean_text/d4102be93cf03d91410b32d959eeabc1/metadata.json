On July 9, 2015, Breitbart News reported that Trump pledged to end the gun-free scenarios for U.S. troops by \u201c[mandating] that soldiers remain armed and on alert at our military bases.\u201d \\nThe immediate institution of this directive probably left President Barack Obama incensed, but he undoubtedly realized that there was nothing he could do to prevent its implementation in a couple of months anyway. And that\u2019s good news because it works to ensure the safety of our troops, which should always be a priority. \\nLet us know what you think about this in the comments below! \\nGod Bless.
