That group turned out to be the Velvet Underground, whose first album sold poorly but whose influence was so profound, as Brian Eno later said, that everyone who bought the record started a band. The same sentiment might be expressed about Mr. Acconci\u2019s influence in the contemporary art world. The genetic impact of his performances, photographs and video works from just an   period  \u2014   1968 to 1976  \u2014   is so pervasive that it is difficult to trace. But Mr. Acconci, who turned 76 this year, has not had a retrospective in the United States in more than three decades, and his most important work can now sometimes seem more like legend than fact. That is set to change on June 19, when MoMA PS1 in Queens opens \u201cVito Acconci: Where We Are Now (Who Are We Anyway?) 1976,\u201d which traces his career from his early days as a poet through his   heyday and around the corner of a radical turn in the   when he abandoned the gallery world and remade himself as a highly unorthodox architect and designer, to the confusion of many. In a series of interviews over the last three months as the PS1 show was being planned, Mr. Acconci spoke about his perpetual unease in the art world, and before that the poetry world, where he said he always felt like an outsider, someone with a relentless creative drive for which a genre had not  \u2014   and still has not  \u2014   been invented. Almost because of this, he has opened bold new avenues over the years for artists as important and widely varied as Laurie Anderson, Martin Kippenberger, Mike Kelley and Tania Bruguera. \u201cI hated the word artist,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, even in the years when I was showing things in galleries, it seemed to me that I didn\u2019t really have anything to do with art. The word itself sounded, and still sounds to me, like \u2018high art,\u2019 and that was never what I saw myself doing. \u201d As far as the art world was concerned, his leap into architecture  \u2014   designs for things like public parks, airport rest areas and a   island  \u2014   was almost as if Mr. Acconci decided to enter the witness protection program. But he disappeared right in the art world\u2019s midst, continuing to teach generations of art students (at Brooklyn College and at Pratt Institute) working in a cluttered,   studio in Dumbo, Brooklyn and lecturing so often over the years that his   presence  \u2014   his long unruly hair, his   wardrobe, his   voice with its distinctive loping stutter and, before he quit, the endless cigarettes he would light and stub out and light again  \u2014   became a kind of ongoing work in itself. Born in the Bronx into a Catholic Italian family, the overprotected only son of a bathrobe manufacturer and a mother who later worked in a   cafeteria, Mr. Acconci came of age in the politically agitated years when artists began trying to find ways around the making and selling of objects. They turned to their bodies, their ideas and their actions as the currency of a new realm. Along with peers like Chris Burden, Adrian Piper, Dan Graham and Valie Export, Mr. Acconci began conceiving and documenting performances  \u2014   at a rate of sometimes one a day in what he called \u201ca kind of fever\u201d in 1969  \u2014   that were conducted on the streets or for audiences so small that they seemed almost not to have happened. In Mr. Acconci\u2019s case, the work grew out of an experience as an aspiring poet and fiction writer whose fascination with the physical space of the page eventually led out into the world. In 1962, in thrall to postmodern writers like Alain   and John Hawkes, he enrolled in the graduate writing program at the University of Iowa, taking along with him a short story he had written, titled \u201c\u201d that when read anonymously in the class provoked a minor riot. Its subject, a horrifying   vision, was a recently limbless man. It began: \u201cThey cut him up and since the chairs had just been varnished for the celebration, he was set down on a giant floor urn. The   jar was   for most people, but not for Rockram, because he had no legs. \u201d \u201cWhen the professor asked for reactions,\u201d Mr. Acconci recalled, \u201cone guy said that whoever wrote it should be chucked out the window into the Iowa River. \u201d Back in New York City after getting his degree, in the wastelands of the Lower East Side, the East Village and SoHo, Mr. Acconci began experimenting with using the city as another means of making literature. In one of his   early works, \u201cFollowing Piece,\u201d from 1969, he spent each day for almost a month following a person picked at random on the street, sometimes with a friend following Mr. Acconci to record the action. The rules were only that he had to keep following the person until he or she entered a private place where Mr. Acconci couldn\u2019t go in. During years when crime and urban paranoia were spiking, the work might be seen as a creepy metaphor for vulnerability, but Mr. Acconci saw it essentially as an   and in many ways optimistic narrative. \u201cIt was sort of a way to get myself off the writer\u2019s desk and into the city  \u2014   it was like I was praying for people to take me somewhere I didn\u2019t know how to go myself,\u201d he once told the musician Thurston Moore. (The band Sonic Youth was formed not long after Mr. Moore first met Mr. Acconci and began playing in various arrangements with Kim Gordon and Mr. Acconci\u2019s girlfriend at the time, Anne DeMarinis.) The dozens of performance pieces that followed through the early 1970s, many of them now   contained varying elements of existential unease, bodily discomfort, exhibitionism and gender play  \u2014   elements he shared with some other artists of the time, particularly with female artists  \u2014   but also a kind of wit and a Svengali aura that were Mr. Acconci\u2019s own. In \u201cTrademarks,\u201d (1970) Mr. Acconci sat naked on a floor and bit himself wherever he could reach, then applied printer\u2019s ink to the marks and stamped them on paper and other surfaces. In \u201cPryings\u201d (1971) Mr. Acconci and Kathy Dillon engaged in a disturbing    in which she clenched her eyes shut as he grabbed her face and tried to force them open. (Ms. Dillon, with whom Mr. Acconci lived for a time, is a powerful presence in his early performances after they separated they fell out of touch. \u201cOr a better way to say it would be that she thought she had to get away from me because I was taking too much of her life, which I guess I was,\u201d he said.) In \u201cSeedbed,\u201d (1972)  \u2014   undoubtedly Mr. Acconci\u2019s   piece, which has in a sense unfairly overshadowed much of his other work  \u2014   he constructed an angled false floor at the Sonnebend Gallery in SoHo and hid himself beneath it with a microphone, speaking luridly to the people who walked above him, masturbating as he spoke. The piece became a touchstone of performance art in part because of its sheer, outlandish audacity. But it also drew a remarkable line through the preoccupations that began Mr. Acconci\u2019s career and carry it up to the present day. The idea for the act under the floor arose linguistically, after he turned to a thesaurus to find synonyms for the word \u201cfoundation\u201d and was struck by the poetry of \u201cseedbed. \u201d And in constructing the floor, he was already beginning to explore his interests in architecture and public space, in this case a space in which he could merge with the building, ceasing to be a discrete human presence and becoming instead a kind of quantum field. \u201cI wanted people to go through space somehow, not to have people in front of space, looking at something, bowing down to something,\u201d Mr. Acconci said of the performance. \u201cI wanted space people could be involved in. \u201d Holly Block, the executive director of the Bronx Museum, which commissioned an architectural environment from him in 2009, said: \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t understand Vito\u2019s turn to architecture, but I think he wanted to be more ambitious and make pieces that lived in the world  \u2014   and in people\u2019s lives  \u2014   in a different way than artworks usually do, and it was a risky and courageous thing to do. \u201d Klaus Biesenbach, the director of PS1 and the organizer of the show, which was conceived as part of the institution\u2019s 40th birthday, said: \u201cHe\u2019s one of the most influential artists of his time because of the way he connects the private with the public sphere, the body with the street, the media space with the personal space. He\u2019s challenging our limits about what we want to be private and what we want to be public, and those questions have only become more important. \u201d The show, which is being designed by Acconci Studios, the firm that Mr. Acconci runs in close collaboration with his wife, Maria, has been a kind of fragile    over the past months, threatening at times to collapse under his unpredictably evolving ideas and inspirations. \u201cYou have to think about him deciding \u2018Maybe I should go to China tomorrow,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Biesenbach. \u201cThat\u2019s just how Vito is. With great artists  \u2014   and Vito is one  \u2014   sometimes you have to have unprecedented flexibility. \u201d But the tension also comes from Mr. Acconci\u2019s longstanding desire not to have his career bifurcated into   and  . \u201cThere are people who like to keep Vito in what I call a prison of a few years, and it\u2019s not right,\u201d said Maria Acconci, 36, a writer who met Mr. Acconci after seeing his work at a retrospective in Barcelona in 2004 and is a fierce defender of his prerogatives. Mr. Biesenbach said he believed the show would strike a delicate balance to reveal the connections between the early work and Acconci Studio  \u2014   the \u201ctwo Vitos,\u201d as he calls it  \u2014   though even as recently as late May he remained uncertain whether the exhibition would open as planned. Mr. Acconci, around the same time, seemed to be leaning toward it actually happening  \u2014   legend becoming fact. \u201cI never liked museums,\u201d he said. \u201cThey always seemed artificially separated from real life. But you have to be seen, and I guess I\u2019ve never cared enough about that. Maybe I should have. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562328.0460603}
