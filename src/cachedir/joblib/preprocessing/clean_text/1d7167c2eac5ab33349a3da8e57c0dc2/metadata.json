October 27, 2016 Matthew Vadum \\nDemocrat Hillary Clinton personally authorized illegal dirty tricks operations against Republican Donald Trump\u2019s campaign, according to top Democrats appearing in undercover video. \\nIn the third Hillary-related video released by ACORN slayer James O\u2019Keefe and his Project Veritas Action Fund this past Sunday (Oct. 23), Clinton is directly implicated in a scheme to use Donald Duck to mock Trump and troll his supporters at Trump campaign rallies. \\nAmong Disney cartoon characters Donald Duck was a natural choice. After all, his name used to appear regularly on voter registration documents when Bill and Hillary Clinton\u2019s favorite community organizing group, the now-defunct ACORN, hired hobos and felons to go on voter-registration drives. \\nEarlier this year Democrats in Donald Duck costumes started appearing at Trump events across America. Costumed individuals would walk around carrying signs. One said, \u201cTrump ducks releasing his tax return.\u201d \\nThis cutesy publicity stunt isn\u2019t necessarily the problem, though. The problem is that Hillary Clinton ordered it and apparently broke the law by coordinating with a tax-exempt nonprofit group. \\nProminent in the video is political organizer Robert Creamer who is very high up in the Democratic Party\u2019s hierarchy. He has reportedly visited the Obama White House 342 times, including 47 meetings with Obama personally. \\nOne of the visits took place in Obama\u2019s personal living quarters. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very big deal that Creamer visited the president\u2019s residence in the White House,\u201d a former senior White House employee told FrontPage in an interview. \u201cWhite House employees can work there for years and never visit the residence.\u201d \\nCreamer, a practitioner of the agitation arts taught by Marxist community organizing guru Saul Alinsky, is husband tof Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), a socialist and advocate of single-payer health care. Creamer is considered by many to be the legislative architect of Obamacare. He also wrote a series of bad checks to cover his salary at a nonprofit and went to prison. Prosecutors wanted to send him up the river for 37 months but he got off with merely five months and 11 months of home confinement from a friendly Democrat judge. \\nCreamer is a founder of the unsavory political consulting firm Democracy Partners . The list of \u201cpartners\u201d on the company\u2019s website is a who\u2019s who of elite Democratic Party power players. \\nIn addition to Creamer, the partners are: \\nMidwest Academy founder Heather Booth ; website developer Marc Cerabona ; organizer Wyatt Closs ; SEIU veteran Mac D\u2019Alessandro ; Maccabee Group founder Brett C. Di Resta ; CrossCurrents Foundation co-founder Ken Grossinger ; former Media Matters for America online organizer David Grossman ; former SEIU national field director for politics John Hennelly ; strategic communications advisor Marilyn Katz ; organizer Jackie Kendall ; strategist Lupe Lopez ; political consultant Mike Lux ; strategic advisor Josie Mooney ; consultant Patrick Pannett ; organizer Christine Pelosi (her mother is House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi); USAction president Khalid Pitts ; former DNC general counsel Joe Sandler ; consultant Linda Saucedo ; fundraiser Renee Schaeffer ; former New Organizing Institute senior fellow Joel Silberman ; and organizer Cheri Whiteman . \\nListed as \u201cassociates\u201d are Lauren Windsor , executive director of American Family Voices, and Aaron Black , who appears in the undercover videos. Black describes himself in the footage as \u201cbasically deputy rapid response director for the DNC on the ground at Trump events,\u201d adding \u201cnobody\u2019s supposed to know about me.\u201d \\n(FrontPage published an article yesterday examining Democracy Partners.) \\nFor a master practitioner of fascistic tactics, Creamer is amazingly lacking in self-awareness (or just plain dishonest). He wrote a fatuous, ahistorical op-ed in the Huffington Post earlier this year titled \u201cCan Fascism Triumph in America?\u201d \\n\u201cLike other fascist movements, Trump says out loud -- and legitimates -- the kind of hateful, violent language that was previously whispered only in the privacy of people's living rooms.\u201d \\nBear in mind that quite apart from his mischaracterization of Trump\u2019s public statements, Creamer is shown in the videos masterminding an elaborate criminal conspiracy involving the use of targeted political violence against political opponents. \\nFomenting and carrying out acts of violence against political opponents was what the fascist Third Reich did, using the Sturmabteiling or S.A., also called brown shirts and storm troopers. Ditto for Mussolini\u2019s Squadristi (black shirts), Mao\u2019s Red Guards, Iran\u2019s Basij , and Haiti\u2019s Tonton Macoute . \\nCreamer explains the Donald Duck action in the third video. \\n\u201cIn the end, it was the candidate, Hillary Clinton, the future president of the United States, who wanted ducks on the ground,\u201d Creamer says in one of several exchanges. \u201cSo, by God, we would get ducks on the ground.\u201d \\nCreamer makes it clear he knows that this coordination between his consulting firm, Democracy Partners, and the campaign was a huge legal landmine when he said: \u201cDon\u2019t repeat that to anybody.\u201d \\n\u201cThe whole duck thing? That came about, the reason we moved it from DNC to [Americans United for Change] was to just do a hopscotch, but the actual idea was hatched way back in May,\u201d Creamer associate Scott Foval said, making a pun. \\n\u201cThe duck has to be an Americans United for Change entity,\u201d Creamer said. \u201cThis had to do only with some problem between [now acting DNC chief] Donna Brazile and ABC, which is owned by Disney, because they were worried about a trademark issue. That\u2019s why. It\u2019s really silly.\u201d \\nWe originally launched this duck because Hillary Clinton wants the duck. In any case, so she really wanted this duck figure out there doing stuff, so that was fine. So, we put all these ducks out there and got a lot of coverage. And Trump taxes. And then ABC/Disney went crazy because they thought our original slogan was \u2018Donald ducks his taxes, releasing his tax returns.\u2019 \\nCreamer is shown in the video hoping Disney would file a lawsuit against Democrats for using Donald Duck in the campaign, likely because such a thing would generate publicity. \\n\u201cLet them sue us. Please God,\u201d he says, looking to the heavens and clasping his hands together as if in prayer. \u201cI doubt they will because we\u2019re paying to rent or buy the suits, that\u2019s where they get their license fees. We\u2019re not using it for commercial purposes.\u201d \\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Aug. 18 that \u2018\u201cDonald ducks\u2019 was the creation of the Democratic National Committee.\u201d Then on Sept. 8 the paper reported the DNC \u201cis no longer associated with the duck \u2026 Americans United for Change is now managing the duck \u2026\u201d \\nBut out of public view the DNC and the Clinton campaign were still controlling the duck operation, breaking federal campaign coordination laws, O\u2019Keefe says in narrating the third video. \\n\u201cWe kind of divvy up responsibilities. So sometimes it will be, like, campaign owned,\u201d said Jenna Price, assistant press secretary at the DNC. \u201cSo sometimes you will see that they advised something, or they are taking credit for things. So, like, we aren\u2019t taking credit for the duck anymore. That\u2019s like, random ally groups. But it\u2019s still something that we\u2019re involved in.\u201d \\nBrad Woodhouse, president of Americans United for Change, expected the presence of the duck at events would spark violence. \u201cI think this duck is going to get roughed up somewhere.\u201d \\nIn one segment, Foval says, \u201cI almost got punched on Monday morning, I mean, I was in a duck costume.\u201d \\nThe nation\u2019s campaign coordination laws were enacted after President Richard Nixon\u2019s Watergate scandal, O\u2019Keefe notes. \\nFor an activity to violate the law it must meet a three-part test, he explains. \\nFirst, there must be payment by someone other than the candidate for election-related activity. Second, a campaign has to be materially involved in shaping communications for a third party group. And third, electoral advocacy has to take place close to an election. \\nO\u2019Keefe continues: \\nThe payment [prong of the test] is complicated but just the fact that Foval, a paid employee of Americans United for Change, was the duck at some events constitutes payment by AUfC. Conduct, based on their own admission the campaign, Creamer, their agent, and AUfC coordinated the duck activities. And finally content. \u2018Donald ducks\u2019 is undeniably political content directed against one candidate for the sole purpose of helping another. \\nThe fourth video, released yesterday, isn\u2019t so much an expose of wrongdoing but it does provide ample evidence of Creamer\u2019s ties to the Clinton campaign and to President Obama himself. \\nIn a phone call Creamer says \u201cI spend most of my time overseeing the Trump events around the country. I mean, that\u2019s what I do for the Clinton campaign, uh, so that\u2019s interesting as well.\u201d \\nIn another scene when an undercover reporter phones saying he needs an immigration lawyer with powerful connections for a wealthy client in Syria, Creamer makes it clear he is happy to help by reaching out to Obama's inner circle. \\nI just need to, I will try and find a couple of good referrals to you and get back to you pretty quick then. Okay? \u2026 On the first, well, I\u2019ll just talk, the guy I\u2019m going to talk to first, to see if this is up his alley, the first thing is up his alley. It\u2019s the guy who ran the campaign for President Obama. He has a firm that\u2019s pretty well connected. \\nIn another setting, Creamer says: \\nHere\u2019s what I do for the Clinton campaign by the way. I\u2019m a consultant to the Clinton campaign. Wherever Trump or Pence go in the country, we make sure that there are press events in the TV market or whatever \u2026 whether they\u2019re big turnouts or little turnouts, whatever, that drive our message wherever the candidate goes to drive his message. So that on any given day they will be between them probably in six places. So our team makes sure there are events in all those six places every day. So it is a lot of events, and we try and help define the other candidate. \\n\u201cEvery morning I am on a call at 10:30 that goes over the message being driven by the campaign headquarters,\u201d added Creamer. \\nHe continued: \\nI\u2019m in this campaign mainly to deal with what, you know, earned media, with the television, radio. With earned media and social media, not with paid media, not with advertising. There would be a whole different advertising \u2026 everybody is driven on the same tracks, though. So then there are a couple, a bunch of people in the Brooklyn office [of the Clinton campaign] that are responsible for possible aspects of communication. Like, we do rapid response and there is a guy there I work with heavily, is the guy that I was just communicating with on that kind of stuff. For instance, we just found, I just sent him a note beforehand when we came here that said, \u2018My understanding is there might be another revelation of another woman talking about Trump this afternoon.\u2019 \\nCreamer bragged again about his ties to President Obama. \\nOh Barack Obama\u2019s was the best campaign in the history of American politics, I mean the second one, I mean the first was good too. I was a consultant to both, the second one, was everything hit on every level and every aspect. \\nObama is \u201ca pro,\u201d Creamer said. \u201cI\u2019ve known the president since he was a community organizer in Chicago.\u201d \\nI was just at an event with him in Chicago actually, on Friday last. He is just as good as ever. I do a lot of work with the White House on their issues, helping to run issue campaigns that they have been involved in. I mean, for immigration reform for the, the health care bill, trying to make America more like Britain when it comes to gun violence issues. \\nThe second video , released Oct. 18, was a primer on how Democrats get away with massive voter fraud. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very easy thing for Republicans to say, well they\u2019re bussing people in,\u201d said Scott Foval, then national field director for Americans United for Change. \\nWell you know what? We\u2019ve been bussing people in to deal with you fuckin\u2019 assholes for 50 years and we\u2019re not going to stop now \u2013 we\u2019re just going to find a different way to do it. So, I mean I grew up with that idea. They used to bus people out to Iowa. If we needed people out there we\u2019d bus people out to Iowa. \\nIn a discussion O\u2019Keefe described as focusing on bringing people from one state to another state to vote illegally, Foval, who also worked as deputy political director at George Soros-funded People for the American Way (PfAW), explains how to get away with voter fraud. \\nInstead of bussing people in, it is better to have them travel in their own personal vehicles, he said. \\nWould they charge each individual of voter fraud? Or are they going to go after the facilitator for conspiracy, which they could prove? It\u2019s one thing if all these people drive up in their personal cars. If there\u2019s a bus involved? That changes the dynamic. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s the legality, because you can prove conspiracy if there\u2019s a bus,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there are cars it\u2019s much harder to prove \u2026 if there\u2019s enough money you have people drive their POVs [personally owned vehicles] or you can have them drive rentals.\u201d \\nFoval says it\u2019s easy to keep the voter fraud operation a secret. \u201cSo you use shells. Use shell companies.\u201d \\nDemocrats are untouchable, he said. \u201cThe question is, whether when you get caught by a reporter, does that matter? Because does it turn into an investigation or not? In this case, this state, the answer is no, because they don\u2019t have any power to do anything.\u201d \\nFoval explained in the first video how pro-Clinton super PACs communicate with each other and how their information finds its way to the DNC, presumably a violation of federal law. \\n\u201cI guaran-damn-tee you that the people who run the super PACs all talk to each other and we and a few other people are the hubs of that communication.\u201d \\n\u201cWe\u2019re consultants,\u201d Foval says, \u201cso we\u2019re not the official entity and so those conversations can be had between consultants who are working for different parts.\u201d \\nHe adds: \\nThe thing that we have to watch is making sure there is a double blind between the actual campaign and the actual DNC and what we\u2019re doing. There\u2019s a double blind there. So they can plausibly deny that they knew anything about it. \\nThe Clinton campaign \u201cis fully in it,\u201d veteran left-wing strategist Robert Creamer confirms on hidden camera. \u201cHillary knows through the chain of command what\u2019s going on.\u201d \\nO\u2019Keefe\u2019s group, Project Veritas Action Fund, filed a formal complaint against the Clinton campaign with the Federal Election Commission last week. \\nThe complaint states that Project Veritas: \\nuncovered a criminal conspiracy where, in the words of Scott Foval, \u2018The way it works is: The [Hillary for America] campaign pays DNC, DNC pays Democracy Partners, Democracy Partners pays The Foval Group, The Foval Group goes and executes \u2026 on the ground.\u2019 This has been done in a manner to evade federal election law and violating coordinated expenditures rules. \\nThe complaint also accuses Priorities USA Action, Alliance for Retired Americans, Americans United for Change, and the Democratic National Committee of accepting \u201cprohibited and excessive contributions in the form of coordinated expenditures\u201d contrary to federal law and regulations. \\nThe first undercover video O\u2019Keefe released sent shock waves through the political community. \\nIn that video , released Oct. 17, we learned that the frequent outbursts of violence at Republican candidate Trump\u2019s campaign rallies have been orchestrated and paid for by Clinton\u2019s campaign. \\nThe idea was to foment violent at Trump rallies in order to create the false impression that his campaign and supporters were violent crazy people and at the same time provide evidence to support the Left\u2019s predetermined narrative that the billionaire businessman is a dangerous fascist. \\nSuch behavior constitutes terrorism, Austin Bay writes at the Observer : \\nCreamer ran what amounts to a domestic U.S. political terror and propaganda operation dedicated to undermining the 2016 U.S. presidential election\u2014\u201crigging the election,\u201d to use the current term. [\u2026] \\nThe election rigging scheme he commanded relies on street thuggery. That means physical fear\u2014terror\u2014is a core component of Americans United for Change\u2019s crooked enterprise. Street thuggery is very low-level terrorism, but it is a type of terrorism nonetheless and it is wrong to call it otherwise. Hardboy muscle, bottles and two by fours are street thuggery\u2019s kinetics. Bottles and baseball bats are not Al Qaeda\u2019s high explosives\u2014but they incite fear and when they crack heads they cause casualties. People bleed. Street thuggery as an arm of politics is violent, criminalized politics on an ugly downward slope to much worse, the worse including lynchings and pogroms. If you don\u2019t think street thuggery is terror then consider Kristalnacht. \\nAnd O\u2019Keefe isn\u2019t finished with the Hillary Clinton campaign yet. \\n\u201cOur lawyers won't let us release all our @HillaryClinton & DNC footage[,]\u201dO'Keefe tweeted Tuesday. \u201cFor those demanding full raw [footage], be VERY careful what you wish for.\u201d\""}, "time": 1742563849.6011636}
