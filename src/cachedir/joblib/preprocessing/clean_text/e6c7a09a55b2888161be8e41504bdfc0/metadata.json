Comey needs to focus on stopping terrorists and protecting America, not investigating our soon to be President-Elect Hillary Clinton.\u201d \\nThe Democratic Coalition Against Trump has filed numerous complaints with federal agencies about figures connected to the 2016 election. \\nOn Monday, the group filed a complaint with the FBI against Donald Trump himself for allegedly violating the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In other words, the group thinks Trump has called for voter intimidation and suppression on a national level. \\nEarlier in October, the group also filed a complaint against the Trump campaign and political strategist Roger Stone, saying both were involved with WikiLeaks and also a \u201cforeign government\u201d behind the hacks that lead to the release of emails from John Podesta, Clinton\u2019s campaign chair. \\nPodesta referred to the FBI\u2019s Friday announcement as \u201cextraordinary.\u201d \\n\u201cIt is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election,\u201d Podesta said . \u201cThe Director owes it to the American people to immediately provide the full details of what he is now examining.\u201d \\nIn July, after the FBI came to a conclusion on Clinton\u2019s private email server and said that no reasonable prosecutor would move forward with criminal charges, the Clinton campaign praised Comey as a \u201cwell-respected Republican who served as George W. Bush\u2019s Deputy Attorney General.\u201d \\nBrian Fallon, press secretary for the Clinton campaign, shamed Republicans in September , particularly GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley, for \u201ctrying to bully the FBI into serving partisan interests.\u201d \\nArticle posted with permission from The Daily Caller Foundation .
