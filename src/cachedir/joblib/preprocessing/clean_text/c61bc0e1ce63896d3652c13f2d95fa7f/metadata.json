Tuesday on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday,\u201d former first daughter Chelsea Clinton explained her new outspokenness, particularly on social media in the months after her mother Hillary Clinton\u2019s loss to Donald Trump for the White House.  Clinton, who was promoting her book \u201cShe Persisted: 13 American Women Who Changed the World,\u201d told   Savannah Guthrie she found a voice during the campaign and thought it was necessary \u201cnot to stay silent now\u201d given the political climate. \u201cWell, last year when I was campaigning for my mom  \u2014   I think really up until my due date with Aidan and then being on the stage at the convention so proud to support her there just a few weeks after he was born  \u2014   I did so many events for my mom,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAnd I had a chance to share my thoughts publicly in those forums. I did lots of interviews. And now I continue to share my views after the inauguration. \u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think what I say today is any different than what I would say had I been asked similar questions or similar issues kind of on the stage,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut certainly, I think we all have a responsibility to not stay silent now. I think we all have to speak up and use whatever platforms we have now and certainly, social media is part of that. \u201d Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor'"}, "time": 1742628422.8914628}
