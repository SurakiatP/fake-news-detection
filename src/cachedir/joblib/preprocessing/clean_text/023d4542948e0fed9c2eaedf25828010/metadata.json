[According to the New York Times,  the FBI director had dinner with Trump in January after the inauguration, citing private details of the meeting that portray Comey as a martyr.  Comey\u2019s people, \u201cwho have heard his account of the dinner\u201d and spoke anonymously, insist that Trump asked the director to pledge his personal loyalty to him, but he declined. They added that Comey was wary about dining with the president, but believed he couldn\u2019t turn him down. The White House, however, disputed the report. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe this to be an accurate account,\u201d said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the deputy press secretary. \u201cThe integrity of our law enforcement agencies and their leadership is of the utmost importance to President Trump. He would never even suggest the expectation of personal loyalty, only loyalty to our country and its great people. \u201d According to the White House, one of the many reasons Comey was fired was because he failed to stop sensitive leaks of information to the media. In an interview with NBC\u2019s Lester Holt, Trump said he asked Comey whether he was under investigation during a dinner with the FBI director and also spoke with him on the phone. \u201cI said, if it\u2019s possible would you let me know, am I under investigation? He said, \u2018You are not under investigation. \u2019\u201d Trump told Holt. Trump said Comey was \u201ca showboat\u201d and \u201ca grandstander. \u201d \u201cYou know that, I know that. Everybody knows that,\u201d he said. \u201cYou take a look at the FBI a year ago, it was in virtual turmoil, less than a year ago. It hasn\u2019t recovered from that. \u201d Trump said that he was anxious for the results of the FBI investigation into Russia\u2019s efforts to disrupt the election. \u201cIf Russia or anybody else is trying to interfere with our elections, I think it\u2019s a horrible thing and I want to get to the bottom of it and I want to make sure it will never ever happen,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742563590.7632053}
