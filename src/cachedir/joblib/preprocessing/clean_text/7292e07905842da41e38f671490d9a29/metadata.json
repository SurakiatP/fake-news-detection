This famously private performer warned the hometown crowd not to always trust the media. A representative had insisted for weeks that it was only the flu. Days later, Prince was dead at 57, discovered not breathing after an emergency call at 9:43 a. m. on Thursday in an elevator at Paisley Park, which houses his estate and studio. While no cause of death has been given, Jason Kamerud, the chief deputy for the Carver County Sheriff\u2019s office, said the local medical examiner would conduct an autopsy. Results are typically not available for a few days, he said. His death has shocked not only the legions of fans who had thought him to be otherworldly and invincible, but also those who had spotted him out and about in recent days: Prince was seen riding his bike, hosting a party and visiting a local record store and jazz club. Despite his enigmatic reputation, he was a familiar presence around Minneapolis. A week ago, Prince was healthy enough to give what would be his final public performance. He played two sets in one night at the Fox Theater in Atlanta, making up for shows canceled earlier this month. Addressing the crowd that evening, Prince said he had been \u201ca little under the weather\u201d on April 7, when the shows were originally scheduled, but added, \u201cWe\u2019re here now. \u201d Nicholas Wolaver, a fan who attended the early performance, said: \u201cYou would not believe that he was singing ill. He sounded true to his talents and it was an amazing performance. \u201d And although he was performing with only a piano, Prince \u201cgot up and danced,\u201d Mr. Wolaver said, adding that even after three encores, \u201che left people wanting a little more. \u201d But by the following day, TMZ reported that Prince\u2019s plane had made an emergency landing in Moline, Ill. en route to Minnesota. After what was reportedly a brief hospital visit, Prince tweeted, \u201cI am #transformed. \u201d On Saturday, there seemed no cause for concern as Prince announced the party at Paisley Park, which also served as a community gathering place. \u201c2 GIVE THANX 4 THE GOOD WEATHER AND 4 ALL THE LOVE AND SUPPORT,\u201d Prince tweeted, attaching a flyer for the night\u2019s festivities. The cover charge was $10. Scott Gregoria was among the few hundred fans to show up. Prince looked \u201ca little more weak, a little more pale than when I had seen him before,\u201d Mr. Gregoria said outside Paisley Park on Thursday. But he noted that Prince was also in a gregarious mood, joking around with the crowd and showing off a new guitar in his trademark shade of purple. In lieu of a performance, he played a recording of the Atlanta show over the speaker system. Prince had been out and about earlier on Saturday as well. Kaitlyn Powell, 17, saw him riding bikes with a companion around a strip mall as she waited for her 3 p. m. shift to start at the local Office Max. \u201cI saw this person biking pretty quickly around the parking lot, but it wasn\u2019t until he got close to my car and I made eye contact with him that I realized it was actually Prince,\u201d she said. \u201cI kind of   myself because he wasn\u2019t wearing purple. \u201d But when she left her car, there he was, just sitting on the sidewalk. \u201cI got my phone out to take a picture and he asked me not to,\u201d Ms. Powell said. \u201cI said, O. K. I respect that, put my phone away and went to work. \u201d That morning, Prince had also noted that it was Record Store Day. \u201cPLEASE SUPPORT UR LOCAL RECORD STORE 2DAY: (THROAT CLEARS 2 ATTRACT ATTENTION): ELECTRIC FETUS,\u201d he tweeted, referring to the south Minneapolis shop he was known to frequent. Sure enough, he stopped in that evening to make a purchase, according to The Star Tribune. On Tuesday night, he was spotted again, this time at the Dakota Jazz Club in downtown Minneapolis, still walking the line, even in his final days, between unknowable cipher and local fixture. \u201cFor the residents of Minneapolis, the loss of Prince is too large to describe,\u201d wrote the city\u2019s mayor, Betsy Hodges, in a statement. \u201cPrince never left us and we never left him. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563746.9462667}
