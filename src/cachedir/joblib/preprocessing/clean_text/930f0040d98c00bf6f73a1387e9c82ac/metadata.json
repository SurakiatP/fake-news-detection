The budget outline will be the first move in a campaign this week to reset the narrative of Mr. Trump\u2019s   White House. A day before delivering a   address on Tuesday to a joint session of Congress, Mr. Trump will demand a budget with tens of billions of dollars in reductions to the Environmental Protection Agency and State Department, according to four senior administration officials with direct knowledge of the plan. Social safety net programs, aside from the big entitlement programs for retirees, would also be hit hard. Preliminary budget outlines are usually   administrative exercises, the first step in negotiations between the White House and federal agencies that usually shave the sharpest edges off the initial request. But this plan  \u2014   a product of a collaboration between the Office of Management and Budget director, Mick Mulvaney the National Economic Council director, Gary Cohn and the White House chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon  \u2014   is intended to make a big splash for a president eager to show that he is a man of action. Mr. Trump\u2019s top advisers huddled in the White House this weekend to work on his Tuesday night   address. They focused on a single, often overlooked message amid the chaos of his first weeks in the White House: the assertion that the   candidate is now a president determined to keep audacious campaign promises on immigration, the economy and the budget, no matter how sloppy or disruptive it looks from the outside. \u201cThey might not agree with everything you do, but people will respect you for doing what you said you were going to do,\u201d said Jason Miller, a top communications strategist on the Trump campaign who remains close to the White House. \u201cHe\u2019s doing something first, and there\u2019s time for talk later,\u201d Mr. Miller added. \u201cThis is ultimately how he\u2019s going to get people who didn\u2019t vote, or people who didn\u2019t vote for him, into the fold. Inside the Beltway and with the media, there\u2019s this focus on the palace intrigue. Out in the rest of the country, they are seeing a guy who is focused on jobs and the economy. \u201d The budget plan, a numerical sketch that will probably be substantially altered by House and Senate Republicans  \u2014   and vociferously opposed by congressional Democrats  \u2014   will be Mr. Trump\u2019s first big step into a legislative fray he has largely avoided during the first 40 days of his administration. Thus far, instead of legislating, he has focused on a succession of executive orders on immigration and deregulation written by Mr. Bannon\u2019s small West Wing team. Resistance from federal agencies could ease some of the deepest cuts in the initial plan before a final budget request is even sent to Congress. And Capitol Hill will have the last word. To meet Mr. Trump\u2019s defense request, lawmakers in both parties would have to agree to raise or end statutory spending caps on defense and domestic programs that were imposed by the 2011 Budget Control Act. Mr. Trump is in a highly unusual position at a time when most presidents are finding their footing or confronting crisis. Despite his lament that he was handed \u201ca mess\u201d by President Barack Obama, Mr. Trump inherited a low unemployment rate, a lack of international crises requiring immediate attention and majorities in both houses of Congress. By contrast, when Mr. Obama took office, the country was losing 700, 000 jobs a month, and the global financial system was teetering on the edge of collapse. By the time he stepped up to the rostrum for his first joint congressional address on Feb. 24, 2009, he had already accrued an impressive string of accomplishments, including the passage of a massive stimulus bill through the   Congress, a gender   act, a children\u2019s health insurance law and executive actions that would ultimately help stabilize the financial and automotive sectors. With the prospect of a second Great Depression still high, Mr. Obama sought to rally the country, vowing, \u201cWe will rebuild, we will recover, and the United States of America will emerge stronger than before. \u201d Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago, who was Mr. Obama\u2019s first chief of staff, said in an interview Sunday night that Mr. Trump was trying to create a \u201csense of urgency, which most people aren\u2019t feeling right now, which was a reality to us\u201d in order to generate support for his unspecified economic agenda, including an infrastructure bill and a tax overhaul. \u201cWhen it comes to all of these executive orders, the question is, does the public view what he\u2019s doing as action or motion?\u201d Mr. Emanuel added. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have real action, you create a sense of motion, so the public views it as progress. \u201d In putting together their budget plans, White House officials are operating under the assumption that the rate of the United States\u2019 economic growth this year will be 2. 4 percent, according to one person who has been briefed on the matter. That is slightly ahead of current projections, but it is well below the 3 percent to 4 percent growth that Mr. Trump promised during the campaign. For next year, the operating assumption is only slightly higher, that person added, a sign that the budget process will not be too out of step with economic reality. The turmoil that has engulfed Mr. Trump\u2019s West Wing is largely of his own devising  \u2014   part of a calculated effort by Mr. Bannon to move boldly despite his team\u2019s lack of experience, and despite the reluctance of many mainstream Republicans to work for a president whom many of them opposed in the party\u2019s brutal primaries. \u201cDuring his first month in office, President Trump has done exactly what he said he was going to do,\u201d said Thomas Barrack Jr. a longtime friend of Mr. Trump\u2019s who ran his inaugural committee. \u201cNo president has worked harder or accomplished as much, even with tremendous political resistance forcing him to operate with a small team of outsiders possessing little government experience. \u201d Lawmakers in both parties have complained that the president\u2019s big words are not yet matched by detailed policy prescriptions or a legislative affairs team capable of executing such undefined promises as repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act or rewriting the tax code. The budget outline will give Mr. Trump an opportunity to add some specifics to an agenda that has been defined by bellicose speech and the broadest possible policy strokes. Still, aides said Mr. Trump did not plan to change his style for Tuesday\u2019s address. The speech, they said, is likely to have more in common with his clipped inaugural address  \u2014   in which he declared, \u201cThe time for empty talk is over\u201d  \u2014   than the   litanies of policy proposals favored by President Bill Clinton or the   invocations of national purpose preferred by President George W. Bush and Mr. Obama. Mr. Trump\u2019s team, conscious of his recent reversals and a   approval rating that is among the lowest ever recorded, has emphasized his determination to break the partisan gridlock and inaction that has kept congressional approval ratings in the 15 to 30 percent range for years. At the start of an interview last week with Sean Hannity of Fox News at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Kellyanne Conway, the president\u2019s counselor, called him \u201cPresident Action, President Impact, Donald J. Trump. \u201d In a   of Sunday show interviews, Stephen Miller, Mr. Trump\u2019s policy adviser, maintained that the president had accomplished more in his first month than most of his predecessors had in their entire administrations. In reality, most of Mr. Trump\u2019s executive actions have had no more effect on actual policy than news releases. And his     order on the   Partnership trade deal came well after the agreement had been put on life support by labor protests and liberal opposition. One West Wing official, who requested anonymity to speak candidly about strategy, said the administration craved the   television images of Mr. Trump at   discussions with business executives every few days on one side, and the vehement protesters of his administration on the other. But his critics say such photo opportunities are all an act, a      rendition of \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d by an ineffective rookie president. \u201cThis man is not a doer,\u201d said Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, who will host a Monday \u201c \u201d of Mr. Trump\u2019s Tuesday speech. \u201cOh, please. He has nothing to show for what he\u2019s been doing in office for 40 days. It\u2019s all been squandered. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561635.8968608}
