The piece she wrote, an editorial reflecting the opinion of about a dozen editors at the paper, said the university \u201cneeded a reality check\u201d after it announced plans to commemorate Paterno at the Penn   football game Saturday, when it will host a celebration of his first game as coach of the Nittany Lions, 50 years earlier. Davis, the opinions editor, wrote that it\u2019s not the right time or the right way to honor Paterno when current students associate him with Jerry Sandusky, a longtime assistant coach who was found to be a serial child molester. \u201cThis is our Penn State. It is a Penn State without Joe Paterno,\u201d she wrote, adding, \u201cThose of us here now are beyond ready to move on. \u201d Davis, a junior from Lancaster, Pa. received hundreds of emails and online reader comments  \u2014   most of them negative, and many that appeared to have been written by alumni. She was called a \u201cclueless treacherous traitor\u201d and told to resign from the paper or transfer to another university. She was accused of hating her university and hating football, and knowing nothing about Penn State history. She was called an idiot  \u2014   by a teaching assistant at a Catholic school, no less  \u2014   and other words that I can\u2019t use here. One man wrote, \u201cI hope God can forgive you for your actions, I sure the hell can\u2019t. \u201d The vitriol threw Davis off, especially because so many of the attacks, including personal ones, came from graduates from the 1950s, \u201960s and \u201970s. This wasn\u2019t educated debate. It was parents and grandparents with pitchforks decrying Davis\u2019s and the newspaper\u2019s thoughtful opinion  \u2014   all to protect a man who may have enabled Sandusky\u2019s crimes by not acting to stop them. Testimony in one lawsuit claimed that Paterno was told as far back as 1976 that Sandusky was abusing a child. It was groupthink at its worst: typical blind allegiance of college sports fans, who so often toss aside reason in the name of   sports at their alma mater. Penn State\u2019s decision to honor Paterno is a manifestation of that. \u201cYou\u2019re bringing up this man who is legendary for what he did for this university, but for good, bad or worse, he is tied to the whole Sandusky situation,\u201d Davis told me. \u201cYou can\u2019t remove him from either sphere, so that puts him in this middle ground. What bothers me the most is that there was no universitywide conversation about how to handle this  \u2014   whether to honor him, or when. \u201d Considering how quietly Penn State announced Saturday\u2019s Paterno day, the university\u2019s officials must have known it wasn\u2019t a great idea. On Sept. 1, in a news release about this year\u2019s football promotions, it listed Sept. 17 as the game when fans wear either blue or white, depending on their seating section, to \u201ccreate a stripe effect\u201d in the stadium. And, oh, by the way, there will be a ceremony celebrating Paterno\u2019s first game, too. It\u2019s the first time he will be publicly honored since he was fired. University officials declined my request to discuss the decision. They\u2019re eager to prop up Paterno on Saturday, but they don\u2019t really want to talk about it. Understandable. If I were planning to celebrate someone who was accused of standing by as dozens of children were sexually abused, I wouldn\u2019t want to say much, either. The university did give me a statement from Sandy Barbour, the athletic director, saying that Saturday\u2019s ceremony would focus on Paterno\u2019s commitment to   and academics. Two players from the 1966 game would toss the game coin. There would be a video presentation. How fans will react to the ceremony, or if there will be any protests, nobody is sure. For last week\u2019s game at Pitt, some Pitt fans wore \u201cJoe Knew\u201d  . Some students and community members here have compartmentalized their feelings, which is probably easier for ardent football fans than for the abuse victims and their families. \u201cWe felt betrayed by what happened with Sandusky and the whole situation, but I think to celebrate Joe\u2019s football career and nothing else seems O. K. to me,\u201d said Tom Rodgers, 55, a laboratory equipment salesman who also works checking in ushers at football games. On Thursday, Rodgers, who lives in nearby Hollidaysburg, and several   stopped to look at a large mural of Penn State and community leaders on the side of the university bookstore downtown. Sandusky\u2019s image was gone. Paterno\u2019s was there, with a halo above his head. Inside the bookstore, there is a cache of Paterno memorabilia tucked into a corner. A   cardboard Paterno sells for $42. 99. One display showed   with 409 on the front, a nod to Paterno\u2019s 409 victories, which put him on top of the   wins list. The N. C. A. A. had wiped away 111 of those victories because of the child abuse scandal, but reinstated them last year. Some alumni don\u2019t want to hear this, but the universal adoration of Paterno here is a thing of the past. Most of these undergraduates arrived after Paterno died of lung cancer in 2012, at 85. Some students are familiar with his name mostly because it\u2019s on one of the university libraries. One young woman who was scooping the controversial \u201cPeachy Paterno\u201d ice cream in the   Berkey Creamery said the flavor was one of the originals. (Impossible: The creamery celebrated its 150th anniversary last year.) Football is still king here, though. More than a dozen tents were pitched outside the    Beaver Stadium on Thursday, not far from the grassy hill that was created to hide the spot where Paterno\u2019s statue stood before it was taken down in 2012. Students were camping out to claim great seats at Saturday\u2019s game. Patrick Shelton, a freshman, was there with his fellow freshman John Peregrim. Shelton is fine with commemorating Paterno. Peregrim says it insults Sandusky\u2019s victims. \u201cWe actually talked about this in my rhetoric class,\u201d Shelton said. \u201cAbout half of the class said it was O. K. to honor him, the other half said it was wrong. I\u2019d say the campus is pretty much split down the middle. \u201d Davis will also be at Saturday\u2019s game. She wouldn\u2019t miss it. Though she has been accused of having no allegiance to Penn State, she comes from a Penn State family. Her father, her grandfather and two uncles are alumni. But her Penn State experience is nothing like her family\u2019s, she said. The outside perception of the university is so much different, the perception of Paterno is different. Last summer, for example, she was on a trip in North Carolina and someone noticed her Penn State  . They yelled, \u201cHow\u2019s Sandusky?\u201d Embarrassing. Just like the reaction to her editorial. Just like Penn State\u2019s inexplicable decision to publicly cheer for a coach only five years after he was fired amid a child abuse scandal, as the facts of the case are still unfolding.'"}, "time": 1742562336.5879142}
