He was 93. His death was confirmed by the office of his agent, Sally   which did not say where he died.   and imposing, Mr. Vaughan was a regular in films and on British television for more than 50 years, long before taking the part of Maester Aemon Targaryen on \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d adapted from George R. R. Martin\u2019s novels. As Maester Aemon, he forsakes his royal heritage, giving up the chance to rule the seven kingdoms of Westeros to serve in the Night\u2019s Watch, a group of warriors and criminals tasked with defending a colossal wall to protect lands to the south from invaders from the north. Maester Aemon was a fatherly figure to Jon Snow, who becomes the Watch\u2019s leader, and unlike many in Mr. Martin\u2019s treacherous, violent world, Maester Aemon dies of old age in Season 5, in 2015. Mr. Vaughan also played a manipulative British spy in \u201cThe Naked Runner\u201d (1967) with Frank Sinatra one of the English villagers who harass Dustin Hoffman and Susan George in Sam Peckinpah\u2019s \u201cStraw Dogs\u201d (1971) and a bureaucrat in Terry Gilliam\u2019s dystopian satire \u201cBrazil\u201d (1985) which starred Jonathan Pryce and featured Robert De Niro. He played other elderly figures, including Anthony Hopkins\u2019s ailing father in James Ivory\u2019s film adaptation of Kazuo Ishiguro\u2019s \u201cThe Remains of the Day\u201d (1993) and a cantankerous old man in the farce \u201cDeath at a Funeral\u201d (2007) which also featured his \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d   Peter Dinklage. He was born Peter Olm on April 4, 1923, in Wem, Shropshire, England. He joined a repertory company at 16, but was drafted into the military in 1942. He continued his stage acting career in England after the war and during the 1950s met and married the actress Billie Whitelaw, who became known for her work with Samuel Beckett. They divorced in the 1960s. On television he appeared in several BBC   based on Charles Dickens novels, including \u201cOliver Twist\u201d (1962) and \u201cBleak House\u201d (1985) and in a television adaptation of Arthur Miller\u2019s \u201cThe Crucible\u201d in 1980. He went on to appear in the 1996 film version of that play, which starred Winona Ryder and Daniel  . Mr. Vaughan later married the actress Lillias Walker, who survives him. Other survivors include a son, David two stepdaughters, Alex and Vikki and four grandchildren. Mr. Vaughan, whose last credited television role was as Maester Aemon, said he was grateful that he had chosen a profession that allowed him to work well into old age. \u201cIt\u2019s not the sort of career where you have to retire at a given age,\u201d he told Shropshire magazine in 2007. \u201cI compare it to being a painter or a professional musician  \u2014   as long as you\u2019re fit and healthy to carry on, and the offers come in, you just keep going. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561829.487257}
