In other words, cannabis has the potential to cure illnesses without the need for pharmaceutical drugs.

(58 mins ago) \\nAnonhq.com reports: \\nObservers say this new development in Britain is a potential milestone that will help marijuana campaigners to press for the country\u2019s lawmakers to legalize the plant based on the available evidence. \\nBefore this good news, some of the country\u2019s politicians had pressed on the government to legalize marijuana for medicinal use. Currently, in the United Kingdom, it is illegal to possess marijuana in any form. Without a so-called appropriate licence, it is also illegal to grow, distribute or sell marijuana in the nation. \\nHowever, over the years, marijuana advocates have been gaining momentum in their quest to have the plant legalized and regulated in the country. In 2015, James Richard Owen, an economics student at Aberystwyth University, started a petition on the country\u2019s official petitions website, calling for the legalization, cultivation, sale and use of the plant. \\nThe petition gathered 218,995 signatures, far exceeding the 100,000 needed for it to be considered for debate in Parliament. On Oct. 12, 2015. the country\u2019s Parliament debated the petition.

(58 mins ago) \\nAccording to the Independent , the latest findings by the MHRA are not directly applicable to the British government\u2019s response to last year\u2019s petition to legalize marijuana. \\nIn a statement on the assessment done by the MHRA, the agency said: \u201cThe MHRA has now completed its review and has considered all information available to it relating to Cannabidiol(CBD) and having taken into account all the scientific advice and evidence, it has come to an opinion that products containing Cannabidiol will satisfy the second limb of the definition of a \u2018medicinal product\u2019 because it may be used by or administered to human beings either with a view to restoring, correcting or modifying physiological functions by exerting a pharmacological, immunological or metabolic action, or to making a medical diagnosis.\u201d \\nThe review of CBD, a cannabinoid accounting for up to 40% of the marijuana plant\u2019s extract that doesn\u2019t contain its psychoactive THC but has immense health benefits, came about following discussions with CBD vaporiser company MediPen. \\nThe Managing Director of MediPen, Jordan Owen was quoted by the Independent as saying: \u201cSince our inception we\u2019ve worked hard to obtain our goal of breaking down the negative connotations surrounding Cannabis to lead to a reform in the law for medicinal use. Now this is finally becoming a reality, which will provide ground-breaking results.\u201d \\nPast studies on marijuana have revealed its CBD helps to control brain and nerve activity, energy metabolism, heart function, the immune system and even reproduction.

Observers predict that the full legalization of the plant is imminent in the United Kingdom. \\nIn all these positive developments regarding marijuana in the United Kingdom, the Mainstream Media (MSM) in the United States have refused to report on them. Despite the news being published by many British media outlets, in the United States, the corporate MSM have pretended not to have heard it. This should tell us that there is a grand agenda to suppress marijuana in the United States, with the help of the corporate media, in order to prevent people from benefiting from the medicinal value of the obviously wonderful plant; pushing the agenda of favor for Big Pharma products.'"}, "time": 1742562069.234979}
