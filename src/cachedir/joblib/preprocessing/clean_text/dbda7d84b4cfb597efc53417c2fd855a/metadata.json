A projectile believed to be a modified version of the North\u2019s   ballistic missile Musudan took off at 7:55 a. m. from Banghyon, a town near North Korea\u2019s northwestern border with China, and flew 310 miles before falling in the sea, the South Korean military said. Earlier, the United States Strategic Command issued a statement identifying the missile as a   or   system that \u201cdid not pose a threat to North America. \u201d South Korea condemned the missile launching, saying that it violated a series of United Nations Security Council resolutions that bar North Korea from developing or testing ballistic missile and nuclear weapons technologies. It also said the North had launched the missile to raise tensions over its weapons programs and to use it as leverage in dealing with the Trump administration. \u201cWe see this as part of an attempt by the North to grab attention by demonstrating its nuclear and missile capabilities and to counter the new United States administration\u2019s strong policy line against North Korea,\u201d the South Korean military said in its statement. The missile launch came as Mr. Trump is hosting Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, on an official visit, but it was unclear if the test was intended as a political message. Mr. Trump and Mr. Abe hastily arranged a joint appearance in response. \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s most recent missile launch is absolutely intolerable,\u201d Mr. Abe said, calling on the country to comply with all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions. Looking grim, Mr. Trump said nothing about the missile launch, but pledged to staunchly back Japan. \u201cI just want everybody to understand and fully know that the United States of America stands behind Japan, its great ally, 100 percent,\u201d he said. The two leaders are at    Mr. Trump\u2019s club in Palm Beach, Fla. where they are meeting over the weekend. The United States Strategic Command statement identified the missile North Korea launched as \u201ca   or   ballistic missile. \u201d \u201cThe missile was tracked over North Korea and into the Sea of Japan,\u201d the statement added. \u201cThe North American Aerospace Defense Command determined the missile launch from North Korea did not pose a threat to North America. \u201d South Korea\u2019s Foreign Ministry said the test, the first by the North this year, demonstrated the \u201cmaniacal obsession\u201d of the North Korean leader, Kim   with developing a   ballistic missile. The test came less than two days after Mr. Trump said on Friday that defending against the nuclear and missile threats from North Korea was a \u201cvery, very high priority. \u201d Mr. Trump made the comment at a news conference with Mr. Abe at the White House. In their joint statement, the two leaders had urged North Korea \u201cto abandon its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and not to take any further provocative actions. \u201d The test of an   system would have been especially provocative because it would mean that North Korea was trying to develop the ability to strike the United States. South Korean officials said they believed that the North has been using the Musudan, its   missile, to develop and test some intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM, technologies. North Korea has deployed and often tested   Scud and midrange Rodong ballistic missiles that can reach most of South Korea and Japan, but it has had a spotty record in   the Musudan, its only missile with a range long enough to reach American military bases in the Pacific, including those on Guam. North Korea\u2019s last Musudan test ended in failure in October. In a New Year\u2019s Day speech, Mr. Kim said his country had reached a \u201cfinal stage\u201d in preparing to conduct its first test of an ICBM. That drew a Twitter post the next day from Mr. Trump that said, \u201cIt won\u2019t happen!\u201d North Korea has since warned that it could   an ICBM \u201canytime and anywhere,\u201d in its first challenge to the new American president. The American defense secretary, Jim Mattis, visited South Korea on his first official trip abroad and agreed with South Korea to boost the allies\u2019 joint defense abilities against North Korea. The two allies also agreed to push ahead with their plan to deploy an advanced American missile defense system known as Thaad in South Korea by the end of the year, despite a strong protest from China. Although North Korea has vowed to develop the ability to attack the United States with nuclear warheads and has tested missiles that can reach throughout the Korean Peninsula and its vicinity, it has never tested a   missile that could fly across the Pacific. It remains unclear how close North Korea has come to building a reliable ICBM, although it has boasted of successfully testing crucial technologies in the past year, such as   missile engines and heat shields for an ICBM.'"}, "time": 1742563315.540688}
