Known as \u201cEspacio Escult\u00f3rico\u201d (\u201cSculptural Space\u201d) the sculpture was inaugurated in 1979 here on the campus of the National Autonomous University of Mexico. It is considered one of the most important pieces of land art in Mexico, a tranquil oasis in a chaotic city. But the recent construction of a white   building nearby has prompted a furious protest that pits the university\u2019s needs against Mexico\u2019s cultural heritage. The campaign against the building, which looms over the   pyramids from less than a   away, has drawn hundreds of artists, architects and intellectuals from Mexico and beyond. A change. org petition to protect the work has gathered more than 30, 000 signatures. Prominent cultural figures, including the writer Elena Poniatowska, have published letters in the press or posted video statements on Facebook defending the sculpture about 300 students and faculty members of the university\u2019s architecture school signed a letter to the head of the department in April calling for the building to be modified or demolished. For the artists, the building, which belongs to the social science faculty, ruins the line of the sky against the flat tops of the pyramids. \u201cAll the great works of land art  \u2014   the horizon is how they function,\u201d the artist Anish Kapoor said in an interview at the site last week. Anything that intrudes on the art, he said, \u201ctakes away some of the poetic, unnameable qualities of the work. \u201d About two dozen artists have said they would be willing to auction works to pay to move the building  \u2014   among them Mr. Kapoor, a show of whose work opened at the University Museum of Contemporary Art here on Saturday. \u201cYou can\u2019t move the lava. You can\u2019t move the landscape,\u201d said Pedro Reyes, a sculptor who is leading the campaign to dismantle Building H, as it is known. \u201cSo you have to move the building. \u201d Some students raised concerns last year about several construction projects on campus, including Building H, but it was not until Mr. Reyes visited the sculpture in February that he saw the finished building and began campaigning. Much land art, in which the landscape is integral to the work, is remote and can be huge, such as Robert Smithson\u2019s \u201cSpiral Jetty,\u201d on the shore of Great Salt Lake in Utah, and Michael Heizer\u2019s vast, unfinished sculpture \u201cCity,\u201d in the Nevada desert. Patricia Mart\u00edn, an independent curator in Mexico City, said Building H was typical of rampant Mexican construction where \u201cpeople do not make the effort to think\u201d what the impact will be. The ruckus \u201craises a public debate about how to think about space, how to think about art, how a building looks,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cThat is healthy. \u201d But the university says it will not destroy a building that it paid over a $1 million for and that is being used for classes and research. Marcos Mazari Hiriart, director of the architecture faculty, said the construction was a \u201cmistake\u201d and had \u201cdamaged\u201d the horizon of \u201cEspacio Escult\u00f3rico. \u201d But the problem could be remedied by camouflaging the building, not demolishing it, he said. Besides, Mr. Mazari said, the artwork, which stands in a nearly   ecological reserve that occupies a third of the university campus, was not intended to be protected in perpetuity from intrusion by other construction. \u201cIs it urban art or land art?\u201d he said. Arguing that the land around the work only became a reserve  \u2014   and a serendipitous buffer  \u2014   a few years after the sculpture was made, he said, \u201cIt became land art over time. \u201d Building H does not break any regulations, said Sergio Boeta Angeles, a lawyer in Mexico City who specializes in cultural heritage. \u201cThere is no legal basis for not building it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a moral question. \u201d The sculpture was a collaboration among six Mexican artists: Helen Escobedo Manuel Felgu\u00e9rez Mathias Goeritz Manuel Hern\u00e1ndez Su\u00e1rez, known as Hers\u00faa Federico Silva and Enrique Carbajal, known as Sebasti\u00e1n. Its centerpiece is a naturally formed, jagged mound of    lava rock that seems still to be bubbling from the earth. Around that stand the pyramids, evenly spaced with a slightly wider gap at the four cardinal points. The work is surrounded by scrubland filled with indigenous plants. Building H is not the only construction that is visible, but it is taller than most and on higher ground. In a city struggling with violence, pollution and chaotic planning, a fuss over one building could seem trivial, Mr. Reyes said. But it is all the more reason to respect the sculpture, he said. \u201cMexico needs peace,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the most peaceful place in Mexico City. \u201d Allowing the building to stay would set a poor precedent, some said. \u201cIf they leave that building there, who knows what else they\u2019ll build,\u201d said Cesar Cervantes, 27, a geography student who was sitting on the edge of the circle last week. Mr. Mazari said that the university would hold a workshop this month to discuss remedies for Building H  \u2014   painting it blue, growing plants over it, planting trees to hide it, covering it with mirrors. The university has formed a committee to monitor campus construction, he said. But the building\u2019s opponents insist the building must go, or its top few floors should be removed so it is no longer visible from the sculpture, a remedy Mr. Mazari calls impractical. If money is the main obstacle, the artists say, they will foot the bill. \u201cWorks like this represent what can be done,\u201d Mr. Kapoor said. \u201cThey must be looked after. \u201d The fight against the building was \u201ca battle for the poetic spirit of the work,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe lose that in our culture, we lose everything. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628568.8982537}
