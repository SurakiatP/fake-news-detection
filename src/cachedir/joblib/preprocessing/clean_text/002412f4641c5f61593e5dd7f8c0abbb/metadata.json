Trump interjected in October as Hillary Clinton pointed out holes in his Social Security plan during their final presidential debate. Madonna and Mrs. Clinton: both trailblazers, both polarizing figures, and both attacked for actions, choices and behavior that are broadly accepted  \u2014   even applauded  \u2014   when done by their male peers. Madonna herself made a connection between the two women before her speech Friday, saying it was \u201creally important to make a stand and speak my mind\u201d about women\u2019s rights after Mrs. Clinton\u2019s loss in November. Our pop music editor, Caryn Ganz, and deputy Culture editor and former political correspondent Patrick Healy looked at how Madonna and her speech put Mrs. Clinton\u2019s candidacy in fresh perspective. PATRICK HEALY: Caryn, I\u2019m coming off 18 months covering the presidential campaign, and frankly I\u2019ve been wondering if Mrs. Clinton would ever give a speech like Madonna\u2019s on Friday  \u2014   calling out sexism in America and the rules that trap women but not men. \u201cIf you\u2019re a girl, you have to play the game,\u201d Madonna said. \u201cDon\u2019t have an opinion that\u2019s out of line with the status quo. \u201d Madonna and Mrs. Clinton have been controversial in part because they didn\u2019t play \u201cthe game. \u201d It\u2019s easy to forget, amid their celebrity and longevity, that Madonna and Mrs. Clinton were once renegades: speaking out and pursuing power in ways that were considered overly ambitious for women. They fought for equality and respect  \u2014   and they sought the kind of influence and money and fame that men have. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s place and legacy in our culture is just starting to be considered and debated. But only after her speech yesterday did I start to think about her and Madonna as sisters in arms. CARYN GANZ: Mrs. Clinton is so buttoned up and Madonna is so, well, unbuttoned, that I think many people have been hesitant to make this connection. And because Madonna has used sexual expressiveness as code for all kinds of liberation, she hasn\u2019t been courted as a political ally. But now that both of them have reached a certain age, the sexism they\u2019ve faced for decades has become something more insidious, paired with ageism. HEALY: A lot of people don\u2019t see sexism hurting Mrs. Clinton  \u2014   after all, she won the Democratic nomination  \u2014   but she and her advisers did. As for the sort of \u201cliberation\u201d that Madonna pioneered, Mrs. Clinton has a complicated relationship with it. She came of age in the era of women\u2019s lib, and yet  \u2014   to help Bill Clinton\u2019s career in Arkansas  \u2014   she changed her last name from Rodham to Clinton and got new hairstyles and glasses. And when she was most visibly liberated, including in her   performances in political debates, she got called \u201clikable enough\u201d by Barack Obama in 2008 and a \u201cnasty woman\u201d by Mr. Trump this fall. Madonna, in her speech Friday, recalled that she got so much abuse after releasing her \u201cErotica\u201d album and \u201cSex\u201d book in 1992 that she felt like \u201cthe most hated person on the planet. \u201d GANZ: In a 2008 \u201cWeekend Update\u201d segment about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s initial presidential run, Tina Fey said: \u201cMaybe what bothers me the most is that people say that Hillary is a bitch. Let me say something about that: Yeah, she is. \u201d (Ms. Fey later proclaimed, \u201cBitch is the new black. \u201d) I thought about this when Madonna put the song \u201cUnapologetic Bitch\u201d on her most recent album, \u201cRebel Heart,\u201d the record where she started to speak openly about the discrimination she\u2019s faced as a female artist over 55. Madonna has referred to herself in many ways in songs over the years, but she waited until 2015, on her 13th album, to reclaim \u201cbitch. \u201d HEALY: Mrs. Clinton knew some people used that word about her. Like Madonna, she answered the haters with a strong work ethic. Mrs. Clinton put in   days, thought deeply about policy, and was a tireless campaigner even if she wasn\u2019t the world\u2019s most natural politician. Madonna is no Adele: She wasn\u2019t born with a     talent and voice. But she succeeded through work, grit and guts. GANZ: But she was born with a     ability to understand and command the power of connecting her voice to her image. Nobody did this the way Madonna did before her, though many have followed her example. Knowing that as a woman, her appearance would be a talking point, Madonna   this scrutiny as a weapon from the beginning of her career, forcing everyone to talk about what she looked like by evolving  \u2014   it was a conversation she essentially started herself. But as she has gotten older, the commentary about her work is almost entirely centered on how she looks rather than how she sounds, and whether what she is wearing or saying is \u201cappropriate for a woman her age\u201d  \u2014   a question that musicians like Mick Jagger, who is 15 years older than Madonna, have never had to answer. And certainly no other candidate was the subject of stories about what he wore to the debate and what his clothes meant. (Continuing investigations into Mr. Trump\u2019s hair aside.) HEALY: I remember Mrs. Clinton telling me during the 2008 race that she probably woke up two hours earlier than Barack Obama each day because she had to do her hair and makeup, and he could just roll out of bed and into a suit. She has had no room for error in what she says or how she looks, her advisers felt, while a candidate like Mr. Trump could sound like a crazy man on Twitter, and many voters shrugged. Then again, Mrs. Clinton is far more of a perfectionist than Mr. Trump, as is Madonna. GANZ: But Madonna and Mrs. Clinton have had their perfectionism interpreted as a pathology. As women cutting a path no woman had traveled before, they had no choice but to be as precise and   as possible, knowing the slightest failure would invite a deluge of criticism. Madonna is known to control every aspect of rooms in which she will appear, down to the color of the lampshades. While Mr. Trump was making brash statements, Mrs. Clinton was tweeting    policy plans and rigorously preparing for the debates. HEALY: But Mrs. Clinton could also take control too far, like keeping her State Department email on a private server. \u201cI don\u2019t want any risk of the personal being accessible,\u201d she wrote in 2010. And in 2008, she rarely talked about being a woman because she wanted to control her image  \u2014   she wanted voters to think she would be as tough as any male commander in chief. GANZ: Trailblazing is a solitary game. They\u2019re both lonely warriors who reached a critical moment this year: the time when they had to speak up for their achievements and call out their haters. HEALY: As Madonna said in her speech, \u201cI remember wishing I had a female peer I could look to for support. \u201d But she and Mrs. Clinton have a mixed record as allies of feminists. Mrs. Clinton put aside her career to support her husband\u2019s, and stood by him during his extramarital affairs, and she supported some policies, like a welfare overhaul, that critics regarded as  . She was also a champion of women\u2019s rights as human rights  \u2014   even as she opposed gay rights like   marriage. Do Mrs. Clinton and Madonna bear any responsibility for being polarizing figures, Caryn? GANZ: Oh, certainly, although Madonna has always been a steadfast supporter of gay rights (something Mrs. Clinton can\u2019t claim). Madonna designed herself to be a polarizing figure, and her breed of feminism has evolved over the years  \u2014   at times she\u2019s been more focused on   than the advancement of womankind. She has defended Sean Penn from accusations of domestic abuse. She wrote one of the most famous songs about not having an abortion. And she\u2019s also often been a covert feminist: On \u201cMaterial Girl,\u201d a song still cited as an ode to consumerism, Madonna is the winner because \u201cexperience has made me rich, and now they\u2019re after me. \u201d It wasn\u2019t the objects she was after, or the men  \u2014   it was the power. And that was in 1984. HEALY: Mrs. Clinton has been labeled   since she was a young woman. And it drove her crazy, advisers said, because Mr. Trump and other men never faced that accusation. She felt held to the double standard that Madonna spoke about on Friday. I can imagine Mrs. Clinton listening to that speech and just saying \u201cYaaaas\u201d over and over.'"}, "time": 1742562351.6434686}
