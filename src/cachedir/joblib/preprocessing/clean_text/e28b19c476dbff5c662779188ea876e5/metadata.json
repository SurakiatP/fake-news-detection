He famously said that he can \u201cgrab them by the p***y\u201d because he is a star. \\nThe Russian band, Pussy Riot, has released a new song in response to Trump\u2019s comment. It is called \u201cStraight Outta Vagina.\u201d It is a very feminist and body-positive song. As women, we should all be proud of our bodies. Perverts like Donald Trump love to abuse us, but we can be stronger. \\nPussy Riot\u2019s Nadya Tolokonnikova told The Guardian : \u201cThis song could be considered an answer to Trump. But I believe the idea of powerful female sexuality is much bigger than any populist megalomaniac man \u2026 Vagina is bigger than Trump.\u201d \\nNSFW: Graphic content. \\nHere are some of the lyrics: \u201cDoes your vagina have a brand? / Let your vagina start a band / If your vagina lands in prison / Then the world is gonna listen \u201cMy vagina is tough and dangerous / Shaking up the major labels / Vagina gonna take the stage / Cuz vagina\u2019s got a lot to say \u201cMy pussy my pussy / Is sweet just like a cookie / It goes to work / It makes the beats / It\u2019s CEO, no rookie / From senator to bookie / We run this shit, go lookie / \u201cY ou can turn any page, any race, any age / From Russia to the states / We tearing up the place.\u201d \\nI\u2019ll warn you, the song is very catchy. Just watch who you sing it around. Rapists and abusers like Trump don\u2019t realize just how strong we women are. This song is a great way to celebrate our bodies. \\nHere is the video : \\nFeatured image via YouTube screenshot . About Natalie Dailey \\nHi, I'm from Huntsville, AL.
