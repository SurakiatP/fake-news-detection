John McCain, the 2008 GOP nominee, each raised more overall in their respective campaigns than Trump has in total contributions.\\nHowever, Trump\u2019s campaign has topped both of the former nominees in small individual contributions, defined as $200 or less.\\n \\nIn this category, Trump has raised more than $78.6 million thus far, based on data from the Federal Election Commission.\\nIn comparison, McCain raised $65.5 million and Romney raised $44.8 million by this point in their election races.\\nWhile McCain and Romney had significant income contributions from other sources, Trump\u2019s small-donor income makes up 58 percent of his overall funds.\\nAccording to OpenSecrets.org, small donations are a key category because for those below $200 mark the campaigns aren\u2019t legally required to register personal information on the donor, whereas if the donation exceeds $200 the campaign must give the donor\u2019s name, occupation, employer and ZIP code.\\n \\nTrending Stories Frustrated With Media Bias, Trump Campaign Takes Its Case Directly To Voters With Nightly Show On Facebook Independent Voters Push Trump To The Front In Florida And Ohio RNC Official Takes CNN Host To Task For Claiming There Is No Media Bias \u201cYou could make an argument that he is the best candidate to refresh the RNC\u2019s online fundraising database because of the different kind of donor that he\u2019s gotten,\u201d said Vincent Harris, a GOP digital strategist who did private digital work for Trump\u2019s campaign.\\nAs of Oct. 19, the Trump campaign ceased all events meant to raise money for the party\u2019s get-out-the-vote effort, electing instead to have Trump focus on getting across his final message to voters.\\n\u201cWe\u2019ve kind of wound down,\u201d said Steven Mnuchin, Trump\u2019s national finance chairman. \u201cBut the online fundraising continues to be strong.\u201d\\n\u201cWe have minimized his fundraising schedule over the last month to emphasize his focus on political [events],\u201d Mnuchin continued. \u201cUnlike [Democratic nominee] Hillary [Clinton], who has been fundraising and not out and about, he has constantly been out and about.\u201d\\nThis decision has been questioned by some given that Clinton\u2019s campaign has raised $445.4 million, according to OpenSecrets, which is $226.6 million more than the $218.8 million Trump has raised.\\nClinton has 41 events lined up before Nov. 4.\\nWhat do you think?'"}, "time": 1742628561.4014585}
