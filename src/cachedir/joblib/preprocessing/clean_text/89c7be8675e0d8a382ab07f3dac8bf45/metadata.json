[Priebus began by declaring that President Trump, who will also speak at CPAC, would become known as \u201cone of the greatest presidents that ever served this country. \u201d   Schlapp noted that Trump will also be the first president to address CPAC during his first year in office since Ronald Reagan in 1981, and he congratulated Trump for assembling \u201cthe most conservative Cabinet we\u2019ve ever seen, according to our CPAC ratings. \u201d When Schlapp asked for the \u201cbiggest misconception about what\u2019s going on in the Donald Trump White House,\u201d Priebus replied: \u201cIn regard to us two, I think the biggest misconception is everything that you\u2019re reading. \u201d Priebus and Bannon said that contrary to media reports about friction between them, they\u2019re working very well together. \u201cIt\u2019s actually something that you all helped build,\u201d Priebus told the audience. \u201cWhen you bring together, and what this election showed, and what President Trump showed  \u2014   and let\u2019s not kid ourselves, I mean I can talk about data and ground game, and Steve can talk about big ideas, but the truth of the matter is, Donald Trump, President Trump brought together the party and the conservative movement. \u201d The President\u2019s chief of staff went on to say, prompting a burst of applause: And I\u2019ve got to tell you, if the party and the conservative movement are together  \u2014   similar to Steve and I  \u2014   it can\u2019t be stopped. And President Trump was the one guy, he was the one person  \u2014   and I can say it after overseeing 16 people kill each other  \u2014   it was Donald Trump that was able to bring this party and this movement together. Steve and I know that, and we live it every day. Our job is to get the agenda of President Trump through the door, and on pen and paper. Bannon, formerly a Breitbart News executive, argued that the mainstream media has been consistently wrong in how it portrayed the Trump campaign, the transition, and now the administration during its first months. \u201cIf you remember, the campaign was the most chaotic, by the media\u2019s description, most chaotic, most disorganized, most unprofessional, had no earthly idea what they were doing  \u2014   and then you saw them all crying and weeping that night on the Eighth,\u201d he recalled. Bannon agreed with Priebus that President Trump\u2019s ideas, energy, and vision were the key to galvanizing a broad coalition of supporters around him. \u201cA lot of people have strong beliefs about different things, but we understand that you can come together to win, and we understood that from August 15th,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cWe never had a doubt, and Donald Trump never had a doubt that he was going to win. \u201d Priebus and Bannon both emphasized how much of Trump\u2019s agenda is clearly laid out in his speeches, going all the way back to his appearance at CPAC 2011. \u201cWhat all of us were starving for the whole time, because we\u2019re so sick of politics and politicians  \u2014   in spite of the fact that we love being here, we actually hate politics  \u2014   but what we were starving for was somebody real,\u201d Priebus contended. \u201cSomebody genuine, somebody that was actually who he said he was. \u201d \u201cIf you want to see the Trump agenda, it\u2019s very simple: it was all in the speeches,\u201d said Bannon. \u201cHe went around to these rallies with those speeches that had a tremendous amount of content in them. I happen to believe, and I think many others do, he\u2019s probably the greatest public speaker in those large arenas since William Jennings Bryan. \u201d \u201cRemember, we didn\u2019t have any money,\u201d Bannon pointed out. \u201cHillary Clinton and these guys had over $2 billion. We had a couple of hundred million dollars. It was those rallies and those speeches. All he\u2019s doing right now is he\u2019s laid out an agenda with those speeches, to the promises he made, and our job every day is just to execute on that, to simply get a path to how those get executed. \u201d Bannon testified that President Trump\u2019s response to advice that he should deviate from his agenda for   political benefit has been, \u201cNo, I promised the American people this, and this is the plan we\u2019re going to execute on. \u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019ve seen the executive orders, the way he\u2019s gone through the Supreme Court, and by the way the other 102 judges that we\u2019re eventually going to pick,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just methodical, and that\u2019s what the mainstream media won\u2019t report. Just like they were dead wrong on the chaos of the campaign, and just like they were dead wrong on the chaos of the transition, they are absolutely dead wrong about what\u2019s going on today, because we have a team that\u2019s just grinding it through on what President Donald Trump promised the American people. The mainstream media had better understand something: all of those promises are going to be implemented,\u201d Bannon promised. Priebus said the most urgent task for the administration was confirming Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. He explained: Number One, we\u2019re not talking about a change over a   period. We\u2019re talking about a change of potentially forty years of law. But more important than that, it established trust. It established that President Trump is a man of his word. We always knew that. But when he said here\u2019s twenty names on a piece of paper back in July, remember, and he said, \u2018I\u2019m going to pick my judge out of these twenty people that are on this piece of paper,\u2019 and he did it  \u2014   that\u2019s number one, because Neil Gorsuch represents a conservative, represents the type of judge that has the vision of Donald Trump, and it fulfills the promise that he made to all of you, and to all Americans across the country. Priebus said the second item on the president\u2019s agenda was deregulation. He argued that Trump hasn\u2019t been given enough credit for imposing a consistent process of deregulation by ordering that \u201cfor every regulation presented for passage, that Cabinet secretary has to identify two that that person would eliminate. \u201d The third priority identified by Priebus was immigration  \u2014   \u201cprotecting the sovereignty of the United States, putting a wall on the southern border, making sure that criminals are not part of our process. \u201d \u201cThese are all things that eight percent of Americans agree with, and these are all things that President Trump is doing within thirty days,\u201d he declared. Bannon divided the White House agenda into three categories: national security, economic nationalism, and the deconstruction of the administrative state. He said: I think one of the most pivotal moments in modern American history was his immediate withdrawal from TPP. Got us out of a trade deal and let our sovereignty come back to ourselves. The people in the mainstream media don\u2019t get this, but we\u2019re already working in consultation with the Hill, people are starting to think through a whole raft of amazing and innovative bilateral relationships, bilateral trading relationships with people that will reposition America in the world as a fair trading nation, and start to bring jobs  \u2014   high value added manufacturing jobs  \u2014   back to the United States of America. \u201cThe rule of law is going to exist, when you talk about our sovereignty and you talk about immigration,\u201d he stated, linking the president\u2019s trade positions with national security. He said the defense budget and Secretary of Defense James Mattis\u2019s plan for defeating ISIS would also be part of that imperative. Bannon made the interesting point that business leaders have been telling the White House that slashing regulations is at least as important as cutting taxes to get the economy moving faster. \u201cIf you look at these Cabinet appointees, they were selected for a reason, and that is the deconstruction  \u2014   the way the progressive left runs is that if they can\u2019t get it passed, they\u2019re just going to put it in some kind of regulation in an agency. That\u2019s all going to be deconstructed, and that\u2019s why I think this regulatory thing is so important,\u201d he said. Schlapp brought the conversation back to media coverage of the new administration. Priebus said he thought there was hope for improvement. \u201cI\u201dm personally so conditioned to hearing about why President Trump isn\u2019t going to win the election, why a controversy in the primary is going to take down President Trump I lived through it as chairman of the party,\u201d he said, recalling his time as chairman of the Republican National Committee during the 2016 election.  \u201cIt really hit me because it was maybe the summer of 2015, and you remember the media was constantly pounding President Trump, and the polling kept getting better and better for President Trump. But it was when I went home and got out of this town, and I went back to Kenosha, and I talked to my neighbor. And I said, \u2018Bob, what do you think?\u2019 He goes, \u2018Man, I really love that Trump.\u2019 I said, \u2018Sandy, what do you think?\u2019 \u2018We\u2019re for Trump. \u2019\u201d \u201cYou all lived through it too, because you all had different people you were for, but you kept running into your neighbors, and you kept running into people that you know, and what did they keep telling you? They kept telling you, \u2018Trump, Trump, Trump,\u2019\u201d he said, unintentionally sparking a chant of the president\u2019s name from the audience. He said it was clear the country was hungry for something much bigger than a single issue campaign, or a modest course correction from the previous administration.  Bannon took his turn at the microphone to disagree with Priebus about whether media coverage of the Trump administration would improve. He argued that it was likely to get worse. \u201cThey\u2019re corporatist, globalist media that are adamantly opposed to an economic nationalist agenda like Donald Trump has,\u201d Bannon argued, recalling how that message resonated everywhere from previous CPAC appearances by Trump to small town hall meetings. He predicted media coverage would therefore get worse as Trump continues to \u201cpress his agenda, and as economic conditions get better, more jobs get better, they\u2019re going to continue to fight. \u201d Bannon warned: If you think they\u2019re going to give you your country back without a fight, you are sadly mistaken. Every day it is going to be a fight, and that is what I\u2019m proudest about Donald Trump. All the opportunities he had to waver off this, all the people who have come to him and said, \u2018Oh, you\u2019ve got to moderate.\u2019 Every day in the Oval Office he tells Reince and I, \u2018I commited this to the American people, I promised this when I ran, and I\u2019m going to deliver on this.\u2019 Priebus stressed the importance of Republicans sticking together through the coming years. \u201cI think what you\u2019ve got is an incredible opportunity to use this victory that President Trump and all of us, and you, and everyone that made this happen put together, and work together, continue to communicate,\u201d he said, adding: Some of the core principles of President Trump are very similar to those of Ronald Reagan. When you look at peace through strength and building up the military  \u2014   I mean, how many times have you heard President Trump say, \u2018I\u2019m going to build up the military, I\u2019m going to take care of the vets, I\u2019m going to make sure that we don\u2019t have a Navy that\u2019s decimated and planes that are nowhere to be found?\u2019 Peace through strength. Deregulation. You think about the economy and the economic boom that was created. Some of it is going to take a little time  \u2014   to get the jobs back, to get more money in people\u2019s pockets. Those things are going to happen. In the meantime, we have to stick together and make sure that we\u2019ve got President Trump for eight years. He\u2019s somebody that we know that we\u2019re going to be very proud of as these things get done. But it\u2019s going to take all of us working together to make it happen. Bannon saw a \u201cnew political order\u201d continuing to take shape, noting that populists,   conservatives, libertarians, and economic nationalists could be found in the CPAC audience. \u201cWe have wide and sometimes divergent opinions, but I think the center core of what we believe  \u2014   that we\u2019re a nation with an economy, not an economy just in some global marketplace with open borders, but we are a nation with a culture and a reason for being,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s what unites us, and I think that is what\u2019s going to unite this movement going forward. \u201d \u201cWe\u2019re at the top of the first inning on this. It\u2019s going to take just as much fight, just as much focus, and just as much determination, and the one thing I\u2019d like to leave you guys today with is that we want you to have our back   \u2026     but more importantly, hold us accountable. Hold us accountable to what we promised, hold us accountable for delivering on what we promised. \u201d Modertor Matt Schlapp, in acknowledgment of the unique nature of their joint appearance, asked the Honorable Gentlemen what they appreciated about one another. Priebus lauded Bannon for being \u201cvery dogged in ensuring that every day, the promises that President Trump has made are the promises that we\u2019re working on,\u201d for being \u201cincredibly loyal,\u201d and for being \u201cextremely consistent. \u201d \u201cAs you can imagine, there are many things hitting the president\u2019s ear and desk every day, different things that come to the president that want to move him off his agenda, and Steve is very consistent and very loyal to the agenda, and is a presence that I think is very important to have in the White House,\u201d he said. He added that he thought of Bannon as a dear and cherished friend. \u201cI can run a little hot on occasions,\u201d Bannon allowed. \u201cAnd Reince is indefatigable. It\u2019s low key, but it\u2019s determination. The thing I respect most, and the only way this thing works, is Reince is always kind of steady   \u2026     his job is by far one of the toughest jobs I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563638.1567583}
