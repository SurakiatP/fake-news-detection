The decision briefly soothed one irritant for Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, whose administration is facing several different investigations at once, including federal and local inquiries into the nonprofit\u2019s   activities. Yet the board appeared to find much that was troublesome, if not illegal, in the behavior of the group, the Campaign for One New York, which has amassed millions of dollars in donations to push for City Hall initiatives, including universal prekindergarten and an affordable housing policy. In a statement at a public meeting, the board said that the nonprofit\u2019s   \u201cplainly raises serious policy and perception issues,\u201d exposing the limitations of the city\u2019s current campaign finance laws, which strictly curb or ban contributions to political candidates to \u201creduce the appearance that influence can be bought or sold. \u201d Calling on the City Council to pass legislation to tighten limits on contributions to nonprofits that are tied to specific politicians, the board added that \u201cit defies common sense that limits that work so well during the campaign should be set aside once the candidate has assumed elected office. \u201d The heavy skepticism that saturated the board\u2019s report reflected the dismay of government watchdogs, who have characterized the Campaign for One New York\u2019s license to operate outside of campaign finance limits as a major intrusion of money into politics  \u2014   an expansion of \u201c   culture,\u201d as Dick Dadey, the executive director of Citizens Union, put it on Wednesday. More than 95 percent of the funds raised by the Campaign for One New York, which shut down in March amid increasing scrutiny of its finances, would have been banned under the city\u2019s normal campaign finance laws for political candidates, the board found. Most of the gifts far outstripped the $4, 950 cap on individual donations to candidates, including a $350, 000 donation from the American Federation of Teachers and $500, 000 in two contributions from 1199 S. E. I. U. United Healthcare Workers East. These were just three among at least a dozen   contributions. Other gifts came from companies or people who did business with the city, including a $100, 000 contribution from Two Trees Management Company, a real estate developer that had negotiated with the de Blasio administration over redeveloping the Domino Sugar Factory site in Brooklyn. Mr. de Blasio, who has raised money for the Campaign for One New York, has argued that the activities of the nonprofits tied to him are aboveboard because they voluntarily disclose all of their contributions, despite not being required to do so. \u201cIt\u2019s not dark money if it\u2019s disclosed,\u201d he said in February. But the board said the nonprofit\u2019s disclosures fell short of being \u201ccomprehensive\u201d and fully accessible to the public. On Wednesday, a spokesman for the mayor, Eric Phillips, said that Mr. de Blasio had been a \u201clifelong advocate\u201d of campaign finance reform, though he did not touch on the specifics of the legislation the Campaign Finance Board and watchdogs have suggested. \u201cHe looks forward to continuing the work to help get big money out of politics and to make sure everyone is playing by the same rules,\u201d Mr. Phillips said. The board\u2019s actions were far more muted than its words. Responding to a February complaint from Common Cause New York, a watchdog group, the board determined that because the nonprofit\u2019s activities on behalf of the mayor had focused on his policy goals and took place more than three years before the election, there was not enough information to conclude that the organization had coordinated with the 2017 campaign. The board also clarified rules governing nonprofit advocacy groups that are affiliated with politicians. If such groups coordinate with a politician\u2019s campaign to promote the politician in the   to an election, anything they spend will be treated as a donation to the candidate and subject to normal campaign finance limits. Run by former advisers to the mayor\u2019s 2013 campaign, the Campaign for One New York functioned as a policy advocacy group, not a shadow   committee. But it checked a few of the other boxes the board outlined on Wednesday: Mr. de Blasio has helped raise funds for the group, and most  of its spending has been on political consultants who routinely advise him. A spokesman for the Campaign for One New York, Dan Levitan  \u2014   who doubles as one of those consultants  \u2014   said the group was \u201cpleased\u201d with the decision. \u201cThe Campaign for One New York was formed to advocate for New York City\u2019s progressive policy agenda,\u201d Mr. Levitan said in a statement. \u201cIt never engaged in any election campaign activity for any candidate and shut down more than a year and a half before next year\u2019s election. \u201d But government watchdogs said the mayor and the nonprofit won a narrow victory on narrow grounds. \u201cI\u2019m looking at the philosophy underlying the campaign finance law, not whether this dollar or that dollar was spent for campaign purposes,\u201d said Susan Lerner, the executive director of Common Cause New York. \u201cDon\u2019t give the appearance that you\u2019re selling out. It doesn\u2019t sit right. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561851.9171495}
