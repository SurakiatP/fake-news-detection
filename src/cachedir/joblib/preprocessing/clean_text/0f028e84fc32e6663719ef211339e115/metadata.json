[Mike Cernovich  \u2014   a lawyer, independent    and a dominant voice on Twitter  \u2014   built up significant buzz for 60 Minutes by revealing on Thursday he had granted Pelley a   interview. In the hours before the live broadcast, Cernovich anticipated that the   conversation would be \u201cselectively edited\u201d and   published a partial transcript.  That concern is based on a long history of network news programs using misleading or downright comical editing to put conservatives in the worst possible light. As the segment aired, Pelley\u2019s opening statement made it clear this story was a smear job: In this last election, the nation was assaulted by impostors masquerading as reporters. They poisoned the conversation with lies on the left and on the right. Many did it to influence the outcome  \u2014   others just to make a buck. The president uses the term \u201cfake news\u201d to discredit responsible reporting that he doesn\u2019t like. But we\u2019re going to show you how con artists insert truly fake news into the national conversation with fraudulent software that scams your social media account. The stories are fake, but the consequences are real. [emphasis added] Later on, Pelley introduced Cernovich with   depicting him, rather unsubtly, like a little boy hunched over his laptop  \u2014   calling him \u201ca magnet for readers with a taste for stories with no basis in fact\u201d: Even with this   setup, Pelley ended up humiliating himself  \u2014   not his target. Watch the key exchange: That story got so much traction, it had to be denied not only by Clinton\u2019s doctor, but by the National Parkinson\u2019s Foundation. ( ) pic. twitter.   \u2014   60 Minutes (@60Minutes) March 27, 2017,  Pelley brought up an article on Cernovich\u2019s website where a physician, who later outed himself as Orlando anesthesiologist Dr. Ted Noel, argued that an explanation for Clinton\u2019s bizarre physical tics could be Parkinson\u2019s disease. While confronting Cernovich about the oversold headline (\u201cHillary Clinton Has Parkinson\u2019s Disease, Physician Confirms\u201d) Pelley exposed his own credulous belief in an unproven claim: Cernovich: She had a seizure and froze up walking into her motorcade that day [September 11, 2016]. Pelley: Well, she had pneumonia. I mean \u2014   Cernovich: How do you know? Who told you that? Pelley: Well, the campaign told us that. Cernovich: Why would you trust the campaign? Pelley: The point is you didn\u2019t talk to anybody who\u2019d ever examined Hillary Clinton. Cernovich: I don\u2019t take anything Hillary Clinton is gonna say at all as true. I\u2019m not gonna take her on her word. The media says we\u2019re not gonna take Donald Trump on his word. And that\u2019s why we are in these different universes. Pelley has no answer for those six words  \u2014   \u201cWhy would you trust the campaign\u201d  \u2014   as his entire profession goes berserk with   fact checks for every tweet from President Trump. Pelley also seems to forget the fakery that Clinton World attempted hours before its pneumonia statement  \u2014   with the candidate smiling and waving outside her daughter\u2019s apartment, greeting a little girl, and assuring reporters everything was  . Clinton just left her daughters apartment. When asked how she was feeling, Clinton said, \u201dGreat. I\u2019m feeling great.\u201d  \u2014   Dan Merica (@danmericaCNN) September 11, 2016,  Cernovich\u2019s followers  \u2014   and even some of his biggest detractors  \u2014   declared the interview a loss for Pelley:   \u2026    and you can see it in the exact moment Cernovich flipped the interview on Pelley pic. twitter.   \u2014   Matt Pearce (@mattdpearce) March 27, 2017,  @mattdpearce pelley was surprisingly unprepared,  \u2014   Will Sommer (@willsommer) March 27, 2017,  Cernovich is a crazy person and a con man but Pelley walked right into that buzzsaw.  \u2014   Stephen Miller (@redsteeze) March 27, 2017,  shamefully stupid piece connecting cernovich to people who buy twitter bots,  \u2014   noah kulwin (@nkulw) March 27, 2017,  @occhipig Pelley\u2019s response sucked but he\u2019s responding to an item WITH NO BASIS IN FACT. But I\u2019m honestly not here to convince you.  \u2014   Richard Deitsch (@richarddeitsch) March 27, 2017,  Charlie Warzel of BuzzFeed said Pelley \u201cdidn\u2019t do his homework on Cernovich  \u2026     And it showed, despite the fact that CBS got to edit down the video [emphasis added]. \u201d Cernovich has since published another partial transcript of his conversation with Pelley and called for CBS to release the full video, crediting his appearance with bumping the show\u2019s recent average of 10. 8 million viewers to somewhere between 14 and 16 million viewers.'"}, "time": 1742561841.9337583}
