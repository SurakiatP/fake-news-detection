He explained that one reporter \u201cfalsely tweeted out that the bust of Martin Luther King, Jr. had been removed form the Oval Office  \u2026     This was just plain wrong. \u201d  The false report, which Spicer described as \u201cirresponsible and reckless,\u201d came from TIME magazine pool reporter Zeke Miller: Tweeting again: wh aide confirms the MLK bust is still there. I looked for it in the oval 2x  didn\u2019t see it. My apologies to my colleagues,  \u2014   Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) January 21, 2017,  Apology accepted https:  .   \u2014   Sean Spicer (@PressSec) January 21, 2017,  Thanks to White House Chief of Staff for this wonderful picture of the MLK bust in the oval pic. twitter.   \u2014   Sean Spicer (@PressSec) January 21, 2017,  Spicer further noted that the media had attempted to paint Trump\u2019s inauguration as appearing much smaller than President Barack Obama\u2019s. \u201cPhotographs of the Inauguration proceeding were intentionally framed in a way to minimize the enormous support it had gathered on the National Mall,\u201d Spicer said. He added, it was the first time in the nation\u2019s history that white floor coverings had been used to protect the grass and that they amplified empty spaces, whereas the grass had minimized the appearance of spaces in the past.  \u201cInaccurate numbers regarding crowd size were also tweeted,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cNo one had numbers, because the National Park Service, which controls the National Mall does not put any out. \u201d He said this also applies to any attempts to count the numbers of protesters during the \u201cWomen\u2019s March\u201d on Saturday.   \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of talk in the media about holding President Trump accountable. Well, I\u2019m here to tell you that it goes two ways. We\u2019re going to hold the press accountable as well. The American people deserve better,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cAnd as long as he serves as the messenger of this incredible movement, he will take this message directly to the American people where his focus will always be. \u201d  Spicer\u2019s criticism of the media\u2019s fake news reporting resulted in a media meltdown on social media. MSNBC correspondent   Reid called Spicer \u201cthe new Baghdad Bob. \u201d Sean Spicer is the new Baghdad Bob. That was positively Soviet. https:  .   \u2014   Joy Reid (@JoyAnnReid) January 21, 2017,    Think Progress\u2019s Judd Legum suggested Spicer had \u201ctorched his credibility\u201d for confronting the media\u2019s misreporting with the truth: Spicer torching his credibility on DAY ONE,  \u2014   Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) January 21, 2017,  Naturally, other media figures from the New York Times, Washington Post, Huffington Post, and Salon also complained:  In that rendition of history Spicer gave, with no q\u2019s taken and false info given, the reality of what\u2019s happening w rallies doesn\u2019t exist.  \u2014   Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) January 21, 2017,  Spicer, before walking out without questions, says they will begin to hold the press \u201daccountable.\u201d No idea what that means.  \u2014   Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) January 21, 2017,  I\u2019m relieved @PressSec Spicer hauled in press to whine about crowd estimates. I worried he was going to announce we nuked Denmark.  \u2014   Dana Milbank (@Milbank) January 21, 2017,  1) 100% false 2) Spicer knows it 3) Trump trotted out Spicer to say this and watched 4) this is ridiculous. https:  .   \u2014   Jennifer Bendery (@jbendery) January 21, 2017,  OMG: Spicer is accusing media of \u201dintentionally framing\u201d photographs to minimize inauguration turnout!  \u2014   Joan Walsh (@joanwalsh) January 21, 2017, '"}, "time": 1742562836.0884757}
