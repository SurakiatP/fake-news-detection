The aim of a single \u201cmega-database\u201d is to fight identity fraud and improve efficiency. But, as Paul Kirby explains, there are fears the database could be abused not only by hackers but by state intelligence too, What\u2019s the database for? The single database would not be used in judicial investigations, ministers insist. Rather, it would help tackle identity fraud by comparing one set of digital fingerprints with another. France\u2019s interior ministry wants the Secure Electronic Documents (TES) to collect all the information on an individual held on two separate databases that have details of people\u2019s passports and national ID cards. Only children under 12 would be exempt. It would include an individual\u2019s name, address, marital status, eye colour, weight, photograph and fingerprints. It\u2019s merely an administrative register, argues Justice Minister Jean-Jacques Urvoas. Its only legal use would be when data need to be requisitioned.'"}, "time": 1742562276.4074333}
