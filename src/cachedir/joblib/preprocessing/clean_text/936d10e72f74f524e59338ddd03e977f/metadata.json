Oklahoma County Sheriff John Whetsel told ABC News that the suspect, Michael Vance, could face the death penalty if convicted of the crimes. Whetsel is warning citizens to stay clear if they spot Vance, adding that he has \u201cabsolutely nothing to lose.\u201d Vance\u2019s rampage began Sunday evening, when he allegedly shot two police officers responding to the scene at a mobile home park over reports of shots fired in the area. The two officers sustained non-life-threatening injuries, officials say, and were temporarily disabled as Vance fled the scene in their patrol car. One officer was shot in the foot and another was hit by gunfire in both legs. \\nInvestigators believe Vance live-streamed two videos while on the run, one from inside the police cruiser and another while inside another vehicle. In one of the videos, Vance appears in a blood-covered shirt and says he\u2019s been shot before showing a rifle on the seat next to him. \\n\u201cLetting y\u2019all know, look, this is real,\u201d he says in the video, according to the Associated Press. \u201cIf you want to know what\u2019s up next, stay tuned to your local news.\u201d Vance said things were \u201cgoing to be intense,\u201d according to an affidavit released on Monday night. \\nHe then proceeded to a mobile home park, where police discovered the bodies of two of his relatives. Officials identified those victims as 55-year-old Ronald Everett Wilkson and 54-year-old Valerie Kay Wilkson, his wife. \\nThe affidavit describes wounds consistent with attempts to sever one victim\u2019s head and the other\u2019s arm. \\nVance then allegedly \u201cshot at and injured\u201d a woman as he was in the process of stealing her silver 2007 Mitsubishi Eclipse . \\nVance is also suspected of shooting a man during an attempted carjacking early Monday. \\nVance was last known to be driving a 2007 Mitsubishi Eclipse and was armed with an AK-47. He is considered to be armed and extremely dangerous, authorities say. Sheriff Whetsel instructed any potential witnesses not to approach Vance but to call 911 and let the police handle the situation.'"}, "time": 1742563408.2512753}
