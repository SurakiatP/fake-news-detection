The remarks reinforce expectations that the Fed will not raise its benchmark interest rate when its   committee meets on Sept. 20 and 21, and investors celebrated accordingly. Stocks rose and interest rates fell, reversing much of the market movement on Friday, when investors worried the Fed might move toward a rate increase. But pressure continues to build for a rate increase before the end of the year. A few hours before Ms. Brainard spoke, Dennis Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, joined a growing list of Fed officials arguing that the economy was strong enough to justify an increase in borrowing costs. He called for a \u201cserious discussion\u201d at the September meeting. The Fed also faced new pressure from Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, who said on Monday on CNBC that the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, was keeping rates low \u201cbecause she\u2019s obviously political and doing what Obama wants her to do. \u201d Ms. Yellen \u201cshould be ashamed of herself,\u201d he added. Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism of Ms. Yellen and the Fed breaks with the general practice of presidents and presidential candidates in recent decades to refrain from criticizing the Fed\u2019s conduct of monetary policy. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, castigated Mr. Trump last week for similar remarks. \u201cWords have consequences,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told reporters. \u201cWords move markets. Words can be misinterpreted. Words can have effects on people\u2019s 401( k)\u2019s, their pension funds, their stock portfolios. \u201d \u201cHe should not be adding the Fed onto his long list of institutions and individuals that he is maligning,\u201d she added. Fed officials insist they will not consider the political consequences of increasing rates. They may, however, hesitate to act before the November election out of concern for the economic consequences of political turbulence, the same way they hesitated before Britain\u2019s referendum in June on its membership in the European Union. Ms. Yellen, presiding over an increasingly fractious group of policy makers, has sought to emphasize their common ground. She said in an August speech that the case for raising rates had become stronger in recent months, but she stopped short of saying that it was time to raise rates. Ms. Brainard\u2019s speech Monday was the last before the Fed\u2019s   blackout period, effectively giving her the last word in the public debate among Fed officials ahead of the September meeting. Ms. Brainard agreed reluctantly to support the Fed\u2019s first   rate increase in December, but she has stiffened in her concerns. Since then, she has made a habit of laying down markers before important Fed meetings, making the case for patience in March and again in June. On Monday, she once again seized the spotlight to explain why she is still not ready to raise interest rates. Ms. Brainard said recent economic data raised some questions about the strength of growth, and there was certainly no sign of resurgent inflation. \u201cIn the presence of uncertainty and the absence of accelerating inflationary pressures, it would be unwise for policy to foreclose on the possibility of making further gains in the labor market,\u201d she told the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. She added that the context in which the Fed operates had also changed. A global decline in market interest rates means that the force of the Fed\u2019s stimulus campaign has been reduced even without a rate increase. Moreover, she noted that the weakness of the global economy continued to weigh on the United States, contributing to an environment of persistently low growth and low inflation. Finally, she said that she remained more concerned about moving too quickly than waiting too long. The Fed has few tools to ward off fresh weakness in the economy, while it can easily respond to an inflationary resurgence. \u201cThis asymmetry in risk management in today\u2019s new normal counsels prudence in the removal of policy accommodation,\u201d Ms. Brainard said. \u201cI believe that this approach has served us well. \u201d Daniel Tarullo, another Fed governor, said in a CNBC interview on Friday that he too favored patience. Mr. Tarullo described himself as a member of the \u201c\u2018 \u2019 camp\u201d that wants to see evidence of stronger inflation before raising rates. So far, he said, there is not enough. \u201cFrom my personal perspective, I think we have an opportunity to continue to get employment gains,\u201d Mr. Tarullo said. Other officials argue that inflation always follows stronger growth if the Fed waits for the inevitable increase, they warn, the Fed may need to raise rates more sharply, causing a recession. Mr. Tarullo said in the interview, however, that officials who took this view should still have hesitations about the outlook for growth. He described the recent economic data as a mixed bag. A growing number of Fed officials argue that this caution is misdirected. Eric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said in a speech on Friday that raising rates in the near term could actually help extend the economic expansion, now in its eighth year. The Fed may now be providing too much stimulus, he said, and overheating could end up forcing sharper rate increases. \u201cIf we want to ensure that we remain at full employment, gradual tightening is likely to be appropriate,\u201d Mr. Rosengren said in Quincy, Mass. \u201cA failure to continue on the path of gradual removal of accommodation could shorten, rather than lengthen, the duration of this recovery. \u201d Esther George, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \u2014   and, like Mr. Rosengren, one of the 10 Fed officials with a policy vote this year  \u2014   has expressed concern that low rates are encouraging excessive speculation, birthing future financial crises. Ms. George is the only Fed official to vote to raise rates this year. Fed officials still could coalesce around a   rate increase, as they did last year. After September, the Fed has two more meetings on the calendar, in November and December. Asked what it would take to win her vote, Ms. Brainard said she would like to see more inflation. She also noted recent weakness in some economic measures like corporate profits and investment. \u201cIt would be important, I think, to see some of those spending indicators starting to really move in a more positive direction going into the third and fourth quarter,\u201d Ms. Brainard said.'"}, "time": 1742562115.9550374}
