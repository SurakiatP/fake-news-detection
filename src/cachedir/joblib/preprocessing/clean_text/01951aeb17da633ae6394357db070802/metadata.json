Trump\u2019s affair with 1998 Playmate of the Year Karen J. McDougal. \\nThe alleged affair happened a decade ago, It will come as a surprise to nobody that Trump and CEO David J. Pecker (yup) of American Media Inc, which owns the National Enquirer , are long time friends. \\nTo say that the Enquirer has supported the Trump campaign is an understatement; they\u2019ve recently run stories alleging that his rival, religious extremist Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) had five affairs and that his father killed John F. Kennedy; that President Obama is a secret homosexual and that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton had only \u201csix months to live,\u201d published more than six months ago. \\nThe knowledge of the affair will come as little surprise to most of us, seeing as Trump is an admitted philanderer and an admitted sexual predator. It\u2019s jsut hard to understand how so many evangelicals can still endorse him, seeing as he personifies everything but \u201cfamily values.\u201d Related Items:'"}, "time": 1742563972.0359452}
