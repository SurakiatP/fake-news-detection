That\u2019s not a saying at all. Hmmm\u2026 \\nWell, that is what Politico must think and that\u2019s certainly what they did. \\nYou wonder why we can\u2019t trust liberal news media \u2026 \\nAccording to The Blaze : \\nPolitico ran a story Thursday night that suggested that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cTrump Victory\u201d fund had transferred no money to the Republican National Committee in the month of October. The actual truth is that Trump has transferred about $2.2 million so far this month, along with several hundred thousand dollars to various state committees. It is not clear what caused the error, but Politico\u2019s site now reads: \\nThis story has been corrected. An earlier version said the RNC did not receive any money directly from Trump Victory. POLITICO regrets the error. \\nOf course, even that \u201csmall\u201d amount of money would seem shocking to Politico considering their candidate of choice flies around the world in a Boeing on charitable donations, kowtows to the wealthy for donations to the slush-fund, and only wears the finest of all pantsuits. \\nTrump\u2019s funds may be small because, unlike the Hillz, he is not a part of the political establishment. \\nAlthough the donations are \u201canemic\u201d this year, and come nowhere near the monstrous amount of dollars the Clintons are using to dupe Americans into standing with her, Donald Trump has a real chance at winning this election. \\nDespite the attempts by the liberal media to silence real stories of Clinton corruption, despite the smoke and mirrors the Clinton campaign created to make Trump look like a monster, he\u2019s still in the fight. \\nLet\u2019s take a lesson from Politico and continue to raise suspicions over liberal media sources. \\nIt is pretty bad that a press is so incredibly desperate to cast Trump in a poor light that they resort to flat out lies. \\nSilly Politico , that\u2019s what Hillary does!'"}, "time": 1742561799.2619367}
