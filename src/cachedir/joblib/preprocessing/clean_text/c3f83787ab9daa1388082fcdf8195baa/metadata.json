I\u2019m friendly. I\u2019m not shy. But when I get close to my \u201cpeople time\u201d limit, it\u2019s time to shut down, be quiet and hole up with a good book. I love helping people, but there\u2019s a huge reason that I balance that type of work with work where I get to be quiet and dive in to working with words instead of being bombarded with interaction. \\nIt\u2019s because\u2014although I don\u2019t fall into some of the old stereotypes\u2014I\u2019m an introvert. \\nI spent years feeling guilty if I wanted to spend time alone instead of doing things with friends. I learned to make the best of it, and often pushed myself to be social\u2014even when it felt exhausting. Many people do this, as extroversion tends to be prized in our society, while introversion is seen as a \u201csecond-class personality trait, somewhere between a disappointment and a pathology.\u201d It is none of those things. It\u2019s the way an estimated two-thirds to one-half of us are wired, and it can be our greatest asset. \\nAs I mentioned, being introverted isn\u2019t the same thing as being shy (though there\u2019s nothing wrong with being shy either) . Many shy people are also introverted, but one doesn\u2019t really have much to do with the other. The best explanation I was ever given (and maybe one of the biggest \u201caha!\u201d moments of my adult life) was that while extroverts are energized by connecting and spending time with others, introverts need inward-focused, alone time to recharge. \\nBeing introverted has nothing to do with lack of confidence. Many confident people are introverted, and gather their strength from the time they spend alone rather than from the input of others. In some ways, I believe that the ability to enjoy being by yourself says a great deal about your confidence. \\nIt isn\u2019t that introverts don\u2019t like social time\u2014it\u2019s that for us, social time is giving out energy rather than receiving energy. \\nA lot of us fall somewhere in the middle between the two, and some interactions take more out of people than others. \\nA few things to consider if someone you care about falls more on the introverted end of the spectrum: 1. Think of each of us as having a cup of energy available. \\nFor introverts, most social interactions take a little out of that cup instead of filling it the way it does for extroverts. Most of us like it. We\u2019re happy to give and love to see you. When the cup is empty, though, we need some time to refuel. We aren\u2019t mad. We don\u2019t stop caring about you. We\u2019ll be so happy to see you and talk to you again when we\u2019ve had some time to decompress. 2. Silence isn\u2019t a bad thing. \\nReally. It\u2019s not an insult. It\u2019s the introvert\u2019s way of conserving energy and restoring him or herself. If we can be quiet with you (and you can be content being quiet with us) it\u2019s a huge compliment and a huge relief. Other times the quiet really does need to be spent alone. We come back when we\u2019re ready. It\u2019s worth the wait. 3. Just because someone is friendly, she isn\u2019t necessarily an extrovert; just because someone is quiet doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s an introvert. \\nIf you pay attention to people you care about, often you can see what energizes them and what drains them. If you aren\u2019t sure, ask. If you notice a friend seems wiped out, ask if spending time together sounds like fun or if they\u2019d like some down time. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve become almost giddy because plans were cancelled\u2014even with people I love. When you know someone needs some space in order to re-energize, be respectful and give it to them. It isn\u2019t rejection. 4. Text. Write letters. Email. We love it. \\nThere are times that you can\u2019t beat a face to face conversation, I\u2019d agree 100%. But for introverts, sometimes being able to stay connected and stay in touch in a less intense and less draining way is a huge help. Being in crowds is tough. Even long conversations can be tough if we\u2019re already \u201cpeopled out.\u201d Having the freedom to respond when we are ready is a great feeling. Sometimes, it\u2019s right away. If it\u2019s not, don\u2019t be offended. (It\u2019s not you\u2026it\u2019s me. Really!) 5. All of this really comes down to respect. \\nEach of us has our own set of boundaries, our own way of communicating and our own needs. When you care about someone, you choose to communicate with him or her in ways that show you love and respect them. If your cup is filled by lots of interaction with others, go for it! Be in tune with your own needs, and enjoy the way that time with others energizes you. If someone you love is an introvert, and needs time to him or herself, tune into and respect that as well. We don\u2019t do activities alone because we are sad, or negative or depressed; we do it because that\u2019s what fills our cup back up. We\u2019ll be even happier to see you when we come back. \\nKate Bartolotta \u2013\u201cOne of the best things I\u2019ve read on the subject was the book Quiet: The Power of Introverts by Susan Cain.
