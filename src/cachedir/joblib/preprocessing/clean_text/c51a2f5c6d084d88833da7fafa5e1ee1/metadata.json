[In a brief conversation with Hollywood Reporter at the Cannes Film Festival, the Do The Right Thing director didn\u2019t mince words about the   : \u201cHe\u2019s not my president. I call him Agent Orange. \u201d  \u201cThere was some clip I saw yesterday of him dancing with the Saudis that was just ludicrous,\u201d Lee said about Trump recent foreign trip to Saudi Arabia. \u201cNot only is he not a good president, he can\u2019t dance either,\u201d Lee said while laughing. \u201cHe could be impeached on his rhythm. He\u2019s the clown with the nuclear codes. \u201d Lee endorsed Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders for president in a radio ad last February and blasted the Democrat party\u2019s \u201crigged\u201d primary system. When asked if he ever came around to supporting Clinton, Lee unloaded on the former frontrunner. \u201cHave you read the book Shattered? Great book,\u201d Lee said of the new Clinton campaign   Shattered: Inside Hillary Clinton\u2019s Doomed Campaign, which offers a blistering    look at how Hillary Clinton lost the election.  \u201cHillary comes with entitlement. They thought they were entitled to this and despite what you might think, you gotta work,\u201d Lee explained. \u201cIf you\u2019re chilling at Martha\u2019s Vineyard, and think \u2018It\u2019s a done deal.\u2019 But it wasn\u2019t. There\u2019s one thing you can learn from sports. To quote Yogi Bear: \u201cIt ain\u2019t over \u2019til it\u2019s over. \u201d They thought it was theirs. Shit don\u2019t work like that. \u201d The   director also said he wouldn\u2019t support actor and former professional wrestler Dwayne Johnson as a presidential candidate without first knowing his politics. Johnson\u2019s name has been floated as a possible Democratic contender to take on Trump in 2020. \u201cNo. Well, I\u2019d need to know how he stood on issues. \u201d Lee said, adding that Johnson\u2019s presidential ambitions, real or not, comes off as unauthentic, given Trump\u2019s jump from reality TV host to 45th president. \u201cThe thing is, everyone thinks they can be president. Like, \u201cLook, that guy did it. \u201d Lee is attending the Cannes Film Festival in France this week. The filmmaker moderated a QA with singer Elton John on Monday.
