That is certainly how the media is portraying it, as his comments spark controversy and fuel fire to the debate over the nearing election.\\nThe irony that his commentary drew from the imagery of founding-era patriots who stood up to tyranny was deeply lost on the left, who see opponents to Hillary in black and white terms \u2013 racist, xenophobic, utterly deplorable and inherently violent.\\nCNN followed up, asking Walsh what he meant by statement.\\nvia CNN :\\nFormer Rep. Joe Walsh appeared to call for armed revolution Wednesday if Donald Trump is not elected president. \\n[\u2026] Walsh \u2026 did respond to CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper via Twitter when he asked: \u201cWhat exactly does that mean?\u201d\\n\u201cIt means protesting. Participating in acts of civil disobedience. Doing what it takes to get our country back,\u201d he responded to Tapper. \\n@jaketapper It means protesting. Participating in acts of civil disobedience. Doing what it takes to get our country back.\\n\u2014 Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 26, 2016 \\n\\nAfter a firestorm on social media, Walsh doubled down, stating on Twitter:\\nI\u2019m serious.

Trump, for one, has certainly been talking up the possibility of a stolen election.\\nThe scenario is plausible enough that the Pentagon and Homeland Security have been carrying out secret drills in the lead up to the election to prepare for the possibility of a martial law response to violence or civil unrest.\\nAs SHTF detailed in an exclusive report, a whistleblower has come forward on the ominous contingency plan to keep and/or restore order if the populace revolt against the establishment\u2019s \u201cselection\u201d for president:\\nIf there is any truth to it, the 2016 election could be a kick-off for total tyranny.\\nAccording to an unnamed source \u2013 who has provided accurate intel in the past \u2013 an unannounced military drill is scheduled to take place during a period leading up to the election and throughout the month after.\\nDate: October 30th \u2013 30 days after the election\\nSuspected Region: Northeast, specifically New York\\n1st Phase: NROL (No Rule of Law) \u2013 drill involving combat arms in metro areas (active and reserve).
