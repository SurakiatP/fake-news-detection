Mills responded: \u201cThink you just got your new nick name.\u201d \\nIt doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to figure out exactly what Podesta meant by \u201cdump\u201d the emails, when taking into account the fact that this was transpiring just as news of the private server was breaking. What this email does is provide insight into the coverup process \u2014 and exposes a willful intent to break the law. Additionally, it reveals exactly how swiftly the Clinton camp moved to obscure the truth from both investigators and the public alike. \\nAccording to a report by the New York Post : \\nIn December 2014, Hillary Clinton \u2014 now the Democratic presidential nominee \u2014 turned over about 55,000 pages of work-related email to the State Department, but that fact wasn\u2019t revealed until the Times reported on her use of the private server. \\nOn March 10, 2015 \u2014 a week after the Podesta-Mills exchange \u2014 Clinton addressed the email scandal, and announced she had deleted about 30,000 personal emails. \\nThe email\u2019s reference to \u201cLanny\u201d is likely in reference to lawyer Lanny Davis, who served as special counsel to then-President Bill Clinton, as well as spokesperson for the President and the White House on matters regarding campaign-finance investigations and other legal issues. \\nInterestingly, Zero Hedge reports that a search for Lanny Davis reveals a suspicious exchange between Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook and Podesta from March 8, 2015, just days after the above mentioned exchange in which Mook tells Podesta: \\n\u201cWe gotta zap Lanny out of our universe. Can\u2019t believe he committed her to a private review of her hard drive on TV.\u201d \\nHillary\u2019s team was apparently upset that Bill Clinton\u2019s special counsel was engaging in a transparent course of action, and moved to \u201czap Lanny out of our universe.\u201d \\nWhile it isn\u2019t clearly spelled out exactly which emails Podesta is referring to in his email, the fact that he wrote \u201cbetter do so sooner than later,\u201d on the day news broke publicly regarding Clinton\u2019s email server, strongly indicates that the actions were a responsive measure meant to obscure any investigation into the matter. \\nClinton\u2019s entire narrative regarding her private email server has seemingly unraveled, and her methodical plan to strategically impede the State Department/FBI investigation, by deleting the evidence, is now on full display for the public to see. \\nHopefully WikiLeaks\u2019 next upcoming Podesta email dumps can provide even further context to this already damning email. Of course, Hillary\u2019s spin doctors are hard at work thinking up a new narrative to work around this latest revelation regarding the willful attempt by Clinton\u2019s team to usurp a federal investigation. \\nMainstream media is trying to censor this information, so please share this story to overcome corporate censorship and to expose the truth!
