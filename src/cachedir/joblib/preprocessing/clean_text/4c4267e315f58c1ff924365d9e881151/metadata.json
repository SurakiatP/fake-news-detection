Just for the record, it wasn\u2019t just her saying would you like to do a handshake. Was he out of it, somewhere else?\u201d After Washington Post columnist David Ignatius argued Trump refused the handshake to \u201cstick it to\u201d the Germans, Brzezinski responded, \u201cI honestly don\u2019t think he thinks that hard. \u201d She added, \u201cI have a different hypothesis.

He was out of it. \u201d (  Mediaite) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742564620.5378892}
