[Broaddrick, who charged that Hillary Clinton tried to silence her about the alleged rape, further labeled yesterday\u2019s women\u2019s march \u201cjust more a part of the fake news that they are trying to perpetuate. \u201d  \u201cAnd their rhetoric,\u201d added Broaddrick.  \u201cThey are so disappointing. \u201d  She was speaking on this reporter\u2019s Sunday talk radio program, \u201cAaron Klein Investigative Radio,\u201d broadcast in New York\u2019s AM 970 The Answer and NewsTalk 990 AM in Philadelphia. Regarding Madonna, who delivered a     speech at yesterday\u2019s event, Broaddrick stated: \u201cI could never take her seriously. She, or when Meryl Streep spoke out. I could never take any of them seriously. Because they did not take us seriously. \u201d Continued Broaddrick: \u201cNone of these women have ever stood up for the women who were abused and raped by Bill Clinton. We\u2019ve never gotten any support. I do not understand it. I mean, you don\u2019t support an evil candidate just because she is a woman. And to me that is all this amounts to, Aaron. Is their candidate who was absolutely corrupt lost to Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump is the only one that stood up for us.   \u2026    \u201dIt\u2019s unbelievable. That they didn\u2019t come out for the women that were against their candidate. The women that were abused by Bill Clinton. It\u2019s still unbelievable. If it weren\u2019t so sad it is almost laughable. I don\u2019t understand why they do not support us. I don\u2019t understand it. \u201d Time reported on Madonna\u2019s speech at the women\u2019s march: \u201cTo our detractors that insist that this march will never add up to anything, f \u2014   you,\u201d Madonna said. The singer said the expletive three times during her speech at the march, saying it took \u201cthis horrific moment of darkness to wake the f \u2014  k up. \u201d The \u201cVogue\u201d singer said marginalized communities would be under threat during the Trump administration, which is why hundreds of thousands of women took to the streets in protest. \u201cYes I am outraged,\u201d she said. \u201cYes I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House, but I know that this won\u2019t change anything. We cannot fall into despair. \u201d The mission statement for yesterday\u2019s march claims that the gathering is meant to send a message \u201cthat women\u2019s rights are human rights\u201d and pledges to fight against those who have demonized \u201csurvivors of sexual assault. \u201d Last October, Breitbart News released an exclusive video interview in which Broaddrick recounted what she described as the   experience of being raped by Clinton. The YouTube video has since garnered over one million views. Watch it here: In another Breitbart News exclusive video, Broaddrick recounted an alleged encounter with Hillary Clinton in which Broaddrick says the future presidential candidate attempted to intimidate her into being silent about the alleged rapes. Broaddrick said she believed that Hillary Clinton knew that her husband had raped her during their encounter.
