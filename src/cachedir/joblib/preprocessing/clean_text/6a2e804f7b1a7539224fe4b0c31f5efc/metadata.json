Ten days have passed since a fire ripped through an Oakland warehouse during an electronic music show and killed 36 people. The Times is chasing a number of questions that arose after the fire. The latest of what we know: \u2022 The victims: On Wednesday, firefighters ended their search of the   structure that had housed a rambling artists\u2019 colony. The final toll made it the country\u2019s deadliest structure fire since 2003, when 100 people died at a nightclub in West Warwick, R. I. The Oakland victims, many of them artists and musicians who ranged in age from 17 to 61, have been profiled in The Times, The Los Angeles Times, San Francisco Chronicle and East Bay Times, among other publications. On Sunday, the first funerals were held for two of the victims  \u2014   Jonathan Bernbaum, 34, and Draven McGill, 17  \u2014   the Chronicle reported. \u2022 The cause: Investigators have not figured out how the fire erupted, but no evidence has suggested arson, they say. Scrutiny has centered on a possible electrical source. On Friday, officials ruled out an appliance that had seemed a likely culprit: a faulty refrigerator. Jake Jacobitz, who did electrical work at the warehouse, told East Bay Times that all of the structure\u2019s power came from a single line threaded through a wall. Electrical breakers blew out frequently, he said. The authorities have warned we may never know for certain what caused the Dec. 2 blaze. Reporters from The Times\u2019s graphics department illustrated how the mazelike layout of the warehouse complicated escape from the fire. \u2022 The owner: Chor Nar Siu Ng, the warehouse owner since 1988, has not been heard from. Examining city records, The Times\u2019s Julie Turkewitz learned that Ms. Ng owns a number of properties in Oakland and has been fined in the past for \u201cnuisance or substandard or hazardous or injurious\u201d conditions. Several people who have stayed at the Ghost Ship said Ms. Ng had visited the warehouse, which was not permitted for residents. But it was unclear if she knew what was going on inside. \u2022 The master tenants: Derick Ion Almena and his wife, Micah Allison, who ran the Ghost Ship, have also avoided the public eye. Friends, associates and former tenants speaking in the news media have variously depicted the couple as misunderstood or manipulative. In an anguished interview on \u201cToday\u201d last week, Mr. Almena was asked whether he should be held accountable. \u201cShould I be held accountable?\u201d he said. \u201cI can barely stand here right now. \u201d \u2022 The aftermath: Artists dwelling in illegal structures across the Bay Area are worried that inspectors would target them after the fire. The crackdown has been nationwide. There have been reports of spaces scrutinized or shut down in Baltimore, Nashville, Philadelphia, Dallas, Austin, Indianapolis, New Haven and Dubuque. Libby Schaaf, the Oakland mayor, said the city was weighing new measures to address fire safety, among them stricter requirements for smoke alarms and emergency exits. A criminal investigation into the fire is continuing. As Times reporters investigate the Ghost Ship fire, we are doing something new: posting regular updates on our findings.
