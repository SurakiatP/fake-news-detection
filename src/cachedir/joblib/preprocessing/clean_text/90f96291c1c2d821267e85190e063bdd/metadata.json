I think Iraq/perrsmerga  said they lost about 4 around Mosel just yesterday alone.\\nThey ain't looking real exceptional at the moment. If its any consolation neither have any other tanks when up against this stuff.\\nThe only one I have seen yet to be able to survive them is the russian T-90. Any earlier than that like the T52 T64 and T-72 have same problems because of the ammo being placed inside the operators compartment and this was moved to outside the compartment in the T-90. I have seen 4-5 of these take direct hits and survive.\\nAlso some tanks with crazy mad-max level homemade slat armor mave made it but not many.\""}, "time": 1742563278.3698232}
