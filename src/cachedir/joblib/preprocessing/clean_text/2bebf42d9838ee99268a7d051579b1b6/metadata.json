Share on Twitter Print This Post \\nOn Friday, the Supreme Court decided to weigh in on transgender rights in the case of Gloucester County School Board vs. G.G . This gives the right wing another chance to take civil rights away from people they don\u2019t like. Plain and simple. \\nAt issue is whether a transgender student who identifies as a boy has a right to use the bathroom that corresponds with the gender he identifies with. \\nLast summer, the court granted the school board\u2019s request to put a lower court ruling in the student\u2019s favor on hold until the board filed its petition for review by the Supreme Court. Justice Breyer joined the conservative justices in that ruling as a courtesy. \\nThe Virginia school board established a policy mirroring \u201cbathroom police\u201d laws in red states like North Carolina that required students to use rest rooms and locker rooms to correspond with the gender they were assigned at birth. \\nIn this case, the district court ruled against G.G. by relying on a 1975 regulation allowing schools to provide \u201cseparate toilet, locker room and shower facilities based on sex\u201d provided those facilities are comparable to those provided to the opposite sex. \\nIn January 2015, the Department of Education\u2019s Office of Civil Rights issued a letter opining that if schools separate students in restroom and locker rooms based on their sex a \u201cschool must treat transgender students\u201d in a manner consistent \u201cwith their gender identity.\u201d \\nBecause of that letter, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit reversed the lower court ruling in favor of G.G. It relied on a 1997 Supreme Court decision that courts generally should defer to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulation. \\nIn reality, the right wing hopes to achieve two political objectives with this case. First, this is about denying basic rights and dignity to people who are transgender, which is consistent with their ideological opposition to rights for women, POC and members of the LGBT community. Second, the right wing is hoping to weaken Federal Agencies by attacking their ability to interpret their own regulations.'"}, "time": 1742562101.3193648}
