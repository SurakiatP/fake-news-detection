[After being introduced by Breitbart London editor in chief Raheem Kassam, Mr Farage spoke about the historic events that shaped the last year saying, \u201cWhen, in years to come, the generations that follow us, study the history of this period there is one year that will stand out. There is one year that every school child will know and that year is the year of 2016. \u201d  \u201cBecause in 2016 we witnessed the beginning of a global political revolution and it is one that is not going to stop and it is one that is going to roll out across the rest of the free world,\u201d he told the crowd. Farage talked about his   fight against British membership in the European Union and the abuse he had suffered because of it and joked, \u201cif you\u2019ve endured abuse, if you\u2019ve been called \u201cdeplorable\u201d you\u2019ve only had a few months of being abused, I\u2019ve had 20 years of it!\u201d Speaking highly of America, Farage told the story of both Brexit and spoke specifically of former President Barack Obama\u2019s visit in support of the remain campaign saying, \u201cI will, to my dying day, be grateful that President Obama came to my country, intervened in the referendum and told the United Kingdom\u2019s people, told America\u2019s greatest friend and ally in the world and told us that if we voted to get our independence we would go to the back of the line. \u201d \u201cAnd the British people were so disgusted by Obama treating us like this that it put us up two percent in the polls! So I shall always be, I shall always be grateful to Obama. \u201d Farage then told of his experience with the Trump campaign saying how proud he was to have been able to be a part of it. He praised the first month of the Trump administration saying, \u201cwhat I\u2019m seeing, 36 days into the Trump presidency, I\u2019m seeing something quite remarkable. I\u2019m seeing an elected leader who is trying to put in place the platform on which he was elected! How about that?\u201d What Trump is doing, by trying to put in place that ticket on which he was elected, he is restoring faith in the democratic process and good for him!\u201d he added. Farage then came down hard on the media saying, \u201cMy favourite part of November the 8th was watching the faces of the CNN presenters!\u201d and adding, \u201cThey are in deep denial! They would like to wind the clock back to 2015 to pretend that none of this ever happened. But just as Brexit becomes more popular by the day President Trump will become more popular in America by the day!\u201d After slamming the media, Farage turned his attention to remain campaign supporter and former Prime Minister Tony Blair, whose name was immediately booed by the crowd. \u201cOh wow so he\u2019s popular here too is he?\u201d Farage joked and said Blair thought 2016 was just a \u201cblip\u201d and that Trump and Brexit voters were, \u201cpoorly educated, stupid, virtually unwashed people. \u201d \u201cHe\u2019s wrong,\u201d Farage went on \u201cbecause what happened in 2016 is not the end of this great global revolution. What happened in 2016 is the beginning of a great global revolution!\u201d Speaking of the coming elections in France, the Netherlands and Germany this year Farage said that it did not matter if all the   won every election, but they were shifting the \u201ccentre of gravity of the entire debate. \u201d He then ended the speech to a standing ovation and loud cheers from the crowd saying, \u201cwe\u2019ve got to be clear: we\u2019re not against anybody based on religion or ethnicity. We\u2019re not against anybody but we\u2019re for ourselves, we\u2019re for our country, we\u2019re for our communities, we\u2019re for making our people safe and with less risk from global terror! That is what we\u2019re for! And we\u2019re for our country! And we\u2019re for our people! And we are winning!\u201d  Follow Chris Tomlinson on Twitter at @TomlinsonCJ or email at ctomlinson@breitbart. com'"}, "time": 1742628433.807734}
