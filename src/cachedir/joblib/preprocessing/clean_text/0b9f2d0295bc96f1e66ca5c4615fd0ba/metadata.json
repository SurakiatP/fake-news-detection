The remarks by the minister, Datuk Seri Liow Tiong Lai, represented the first time the Malaysian government had acknowledged that the flight simulator belonging to the pilot of Flight 370, Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah, contained such a path, leading far from any route his airline flew. The minister did not say when the pilot might have practiced that route, and he emphasized that it was one of many found on the simulator, which the pilot kept at his home. The minister also said it would be premature to draw any conclusions from the disclosure. Nonetheless, it added to telltale indications that the aircraft, a Boeing   jet carrying 239 passengers and crew members, might have been deliberately crashed into the sea by Mr. Zaharie after departing Kuala Lumpur for Beijing on March 8, 2014. \u201cYes, there is simulation showing it flew to many parts of the world,\u201d the minister was quoted by Malaysia\u2019s Bernama News Agency as saying at a monthly Transport Ministry briefing. The remote southern Indian Ocean route was \u201cone of many,\u201d he said. The minister appeared to be responding to a report published on July 22 by New York magazine, which said it had obtained a confidential document from a Malaysian police investigation showing that Mr. Zaharie had practiced the route on his simulator less than a month before Flight 370 disappeared \u201cunder uncannily similar circumstances. \u201d The magazine called the revelation, which was not in the Malaysia government\u2019s public report on the Flight 370 investigation, the strongest evidence yet that the pilot had \u201cmade off with the plane in a premeditated act of mass  . \u201d Flight 370\u2019s deviation from its planned route, taking the aircraft thousands of miles off course, remains a mystery of modern civil aviation. One of the working theories is that the plane flew for hours on autopilot with its crew dead or incapacitated and then crashed when its fuel ran out. Technical signals sent by the plane suggested that it might have wound up in a    area of the southern Indian Ocean, but aircraft and ships have scoured the area without turning up a sign of the aircraft. Last month, the three countries leading the search  \u2014   Australia, China and Malaysia  \u2014   said they would suspend the operation, but would revive it if \u201ccredible new information\u201d emerged about the plane\u2019s whereabouts. A small amount of debris believed to be from the plane has been found thousands of miles to the west. The most significant pieces appeared to be a wing part known as a flaperon  \u2014   discovered last year on R\u00e9union, an island near Madagascar that is part of France  \u2014   and another wing segment found more recently near the coast of Tanzania. A prominent crash investigator caused a stir last weekend by asserting that the flaperon appeared to have been placed in an extended position when it hit the water, and that it had to have been done deliberately. The assertion by the investigator, Larry Vance, who led an inquiry into the 1998 crash of Swissair Flight 111 in the Atlantic Ocean, has not been confirmed by officials in charge of the Flight 370 inquiry. \u201cSomebody was flying the airplane at the end of its flight,\u201d Mr. Vance said in an interview on Australia\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d program. \u201cSomebody was flying the airplane into the water. There is no other alternate theory that you can follow. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562024.899337}
