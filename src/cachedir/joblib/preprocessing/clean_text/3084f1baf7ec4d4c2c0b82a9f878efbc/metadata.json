Mr. Orban submitted a plan to ban the refugees, in the form of a constitutional amendment, last month, after a similar proposal failed to pass by referendum because of insufficient voter turnout. He has vowed to block a European Union program that would resettle migrants from the Middle East and Africa who have gone to countries like Greece and Italy. Under that program, Hungary, a nation of 10 million, would have to accept  1, 294 of a total of about 160, 000 migrants. The amendment needed   of sitting members of the   Parliament to pass. It got 131 votes on Tuesday  \u2014   two shy of the necessary threshold. Three lawmakers voted no, and the rest abstained. The   Jobbik party, which is part of the official opposition but usually sides with Mr. Orban\u2019s Fidesz party on migration issues, was crucial to the defeat of the amendment. Gabor Vona, a lawmaker and the leader of Jobbik, said that his party would support only a solution that \u201cdefends Hungary and Hungarian people, not just from poor migrants but from rich migrants, not just from poor terrorists but from rich terrorists. \u201d He was referring to a rule that allows foreigners who invest over 300, 000 euros, or about $332, 000, in Hungarian bonds to acquire residency. The program dates to 2012, but it has drawn attention recently, after reports that Hungarian bonds could be bought in places like Erbil, Iraq. Critics say that allowing migrants to settle in Hungary could open the door to terrorists from unstable countries like Iraq, and they say the residency program might open the door to corruption. The Fidesz party has been politically weaker since last year, when it lost its supermajority in Parliament. That advantage had allowed Mr. Orban\u2019s government to rewrite the Constitution and to pass legislation to rein in the judiciary and the press, packing some of the country\u2019s top institutions with political allies. Lajos Kosa, an ally of Mr. Orban who leads Fidesz lawmakers in Parliament, said before the vote on Tuesday that the Jobbik party would be \u201cjoining the ranks of traitors\u201d if it rejected the amendment. \u201cHungary can only count on Fidesz and K. D. N. P. in the struggle against migration,\u201d he said as he emerged from the vote, using the initials for the Christian Democratic People\u2019s Party, which is part of the governing coalition. \u201cWe are naturally going to continue the struggle,\u201d he said, noting that more than three million voters in the referendum had opted to support the ban on migrants. On Tuesday, analysts were cautious in interpreting the defeat of the amendment as a sign of the government\u2019s declining political power. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that this is a huge failure for Orban  \u2014   it\u2019s a failure, but a minor one,\u201d said Csaba Toth, the director of strategy for the Republikon Institute, a research and advocacy group that has been critical of Mr. Orban\u2019s government. \u201cThis is the second time the government can\u2019t have their own way, which is important for a group whose main governing strategy is power. \u201d Last year, Mr. Orban and his government began an aggressive campaign against migrants, particularly those from the Middle East, as hundreds of thousands crossed Hungary\u2019s southern border, most of them en route to Germany. The number of crossings fell nearly to zero after Hungary built a   fence along sections of the border and as the flow of migrants shifted away from the Balkans. Nonetheless, Fidesz\u2019s campaign against migration has continued, and the party\u2019s stance has seized both attention and voters from Jobbik, which had been the main voice for   nationalists. Mr. Toth, the analyst, said that the vote on Tuesday could be seen as an attempt by Jobbik to improve its political standing. \u201cIt can say that corruption is more important to Fidesz than the fight against quotas,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742562138.637057}
