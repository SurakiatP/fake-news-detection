Just a day after the media took his running mate\u2019s statements to their logical conclusion \u2013 a tacit endorsement of Hillary Clinton \u2013 Johnson then lost his cool during an interview with the Guardian, in one of the most awkward interviews we\u2019ve ever seen. \\n\u201cI could hear some loud voices just then. Is is the same questions? You get the same questions again and again and again?\u201d asks Lewis. \u201cI\u2019m an idiot. Really. I\u2019m the dumbest guy that you\u2019ve ever met in your whole life\u201d replies Johnson. An awkward silence follows while Lewis admits \u201cI\u2019m trying to work out if that\u2019s sarcasm or not.\u201d \\nWhen Lews got to more substantial questions, like how Johnson felt about the fact that every major economist considers Johnson\u2019s proposals to abolish all taxes and replace them with a flat sales tax to be crackpot lunacy, the candidate blew his top and went off on an angry but unrelated rant about how he was considered a fool for proposing marijuana legalization. \\nThe Libertarian Party never had much chance in the first place, and their poll numbers continue to plummet . Their platform of free-market anarchy and a juvenile obsession with \u201cfreedoms\u201d is supported largely by stoned fringe wing-nuts who worship Alex Jones and despise the government in the same way a toddler is infuriated at a parent for not letting them jam a fork into an electric socket. \\nThe general displeasure with the mainstream candidates created some increased interest in the Libertarian Party, but Gary Johnson\u2019s behavior can be seen as a representation for the party as a whole: unprepared and immature. \\nWatch it here:'"}, "time": 1742563083.709913}
