Democrats should ask Clinton to step aside By VNN on October 31, 2016 The newly opened FBI investigation of Hillary Clinton\\'s private email server marks \"a potential Constitutional crisis\" for the country. \\nChicago Tribune \\nHas America become so numb by the decades of lies and cynicism oozing from Clinton Inc. that it could elect Hillary Clinton as president, even after Friday\u2019s FBI announcement that it had reopened an investigation of her emails while secretary of state? \\nWe\u2019ll find out soon enough. \\nIt\u2019s obvious the American political system is breaking down. It\u2019s been crumbling for some time now, and the establishment elite know it and they\u2019re properly frightened. Donald Trump , the vulgarian at their gates, is a symptom, not a cause. Hillary Clinton and husband Bill are both cause and effect. \\nFBI director James Comey \u2018s announcement about the renewed Clinton email investigation is the bombshell in the presidential campaign. That he announced this so close to Election Day should tell every thinking person that what the FBI is looking at is extremely serious. \\nThis can\u2019t be about pervert Anthony Weiner and his reported desire for a teenage girl. But it can be about the laptop of Weiner\u2019s wife, Clinton aide Huma Abedin , and emails between her and Hillary. It comes after the FBI investigation in which Comey concluded Clinton had lied and been \u201creckless\u201d with national secrets, but said he could not recommend prosecution. \\nSo what should the Democrats do now? \\n\\nIf ruling Democrats hold themselves to the high moral standards they impose on the people they govern, they would follow a simple process: \\nThey would demand that Mrs. Clinton step down, immediately, and let her vice presidential nominee, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, stand in her place. \\nDemocrats should say, honestly, that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her home-brew email server from the time she was secretary of state, having Clinton anywhere near the White House is just not a good idea. \\nSince Oct. 7, WikiLeaks has released 35,000 emails hacked from Clinton campaign boss John Podesta . Now WikiLeaks, no longer a neutral player but an active anti-Clinton agency, plans to release another 15,000 emails. \\nWhat if she is elected? Think of a nation suffering a bad economy and continuing chaos in the Middle East, and now also facing a criminal investigation of a president. Add to that congressional investigations and a public vision of Clinton as a Nixonian figure wandering the halls, wringing her hands. \\nThe best thing would be for Democrats to ask her to step down now. It would be the most responsible thing to do, if the nation were more important to them than power. And the American news media \u2014 fairly or not firmly identified in the public mind as Mrs. Clinton\u2019s political action committee \u2014 should begin demanding it. \\nBut what will Hillary do? \\nShe\u2019ll stick and ride this out and turn her anger toward Comey. For Hillary and Bill Clinton, it has always been about power, about the Clinton Restoration and protecting fortunes already made by selling nothing but political influence. \\nShe\u2019ll remind the nation that she\u2019s a woman and that Donald Trump said terrible things about women. If there is another notorious Trump video to be leaked, the Clintons should probably leak it now. Then her allies in media can talk about misogyny and sexual politics and the headlines can be all about Trump as the boor he is and Hillary as champion of female victims, which she has never been. \\nRemember that Bill Clinton leveraged the \u201cYear of the Woman.\u201d Then he preyed on women in the White House and Hillary protected him. But the political left \u2014 most particularly the women of the left \u2014 defended him because he promised to protect abortion rights and their other agendas. \\nIf you take a step back from tribal politics, you\u2019ll see that Mrs. Clinton has clearly disqualified herself from ever coming near classified information again. If she were a young person straight out of grad school hoping to land a government job, Hillary Clinton would be laughed out of Washington with her record. She\u2019d never be hired. \\nAs secretary of state she kept classified documents on the home-brew server in her basement, which is against the law. She lied about it to the American people. She couldn\u2019t remember details dozens of times when questioned by the FBI. Her aides destroyed evidence by BleachBit and hammers. Her husband, Bill, met secretly on an airport tarmac with Attorney General Loretta Lynch for about a half-hour, and all they said they talked about was golf and the grandkids. \\nAnd there was no prosecution of Hillary. \\nThat isn\u2019t merely wrong and unethical. It is poisonous. \\nAnd during this presidential campaign, Americans were confronted with a two-tiered system of federal justice: one for standards for the Clintons and one for the peasants. \\nI\u2019ve always figured that, as secretary of state, Clinton kept her home-brew email server \u2014 from which foreign intelligence agencies could hack top secret information \u2014 so she could shield the influence peddling that helped make the Clintons several fortunes. \\nThe Clintons weren\u2019t skilled merchants. They weren\u2019t traders or manufacturers. The Clintons never produced anything tangible. They had no science, patents or devices to make them millions upon millions of dollars. FBI\u2019s Comey acted out of \u2018obligation\u2019 to lawmakers, fear of leak to media \\nAll they had to sell, really, was influence. And they used our federal government to leverage it. \\nIf a presidential election is as much about the people as it is about the candidates, then we\u2019ll learn plenty about ourselves in the coming days, won\u2019t we? \\nListen to the Chicago Way podcast with John Kass and Jeff Carlin.
