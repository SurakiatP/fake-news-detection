The A-list couple showed Clinton a stunning amount of support, followed by a powerful speech by the Democratic candidate herself. It was a monumental moment, and Trump hated every second of it. \\nAt a rally of his own, Trump couldn\u2019t hide the fact that he was green with envy. Trump said: \\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do it, folks. We\u2019re going to do it. Oh boy, are we going to win Pennsylvania big. Look at this. I hear we set a new record for this building. And by the way, I didn\u2019t have to bring J Lo or Jay Z, the only way she gets anybody. I\u2019m here all by myself. I am here all by myself. Just me. No guitar, no piano, no nothing.\u201d \\nTrump didn\u2019t even try to hide how sorry he felt for himself, and it was obvious that he was trying really hard not to completely lose it over the fact that no one likes him and almost no celebrities want to be affiliated with him. You can watch Trump give his pathetic, desperate speech below: \\nTrump\u2019s bullsh*t campaign is finally coming to an end. He spent the beginning of his campaign promising America that he\u2019d run a star-studded campaign, and he has almost nothing to show for it almost a year later. Not even his own Republican colleagues wanted to appear with him on the campaign trail, forcing Trump to go it alone. \\nOf course Trump is jealous and bitter. While Clinton doesn\u2019t need the support of the massive amount of celebrities who have endorsed her, their support is a clear sign that she is doing something right and her campaign is something worth standing by. You can watch Beyonce and Jay Z stand with Clinton below: \\nFeatured image via Alex Wong / Getty Images Patti Colli My passion is bringing attention to human rights and equality issues.
