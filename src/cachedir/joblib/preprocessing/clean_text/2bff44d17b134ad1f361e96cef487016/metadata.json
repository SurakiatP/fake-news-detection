DeMille Lifetime Achievement Award at Sunday night\u2019s Golden Globes  \u2014   and used her acceptance speech to repeatedly attack   Donald Trump in what was one of the night\u2019s most pointed political statements. [The     began her speech by noting that Hollywood is the most \u201cvilified\u201d segment of American society following Donald Trump\u2019s victory.  \u201cHollywood is crawling with outsiders and foreigners. And if we kick them all out, you\u2019ll have nothing to watch but football and Mixed Martial Arts, which are not the arts,\u201d she said.

Demille Award. pic. twitter.   \u2014   Golden Globe Awards (@goldenglobes) January 9, 2017,  Streep said Trump\u2019s mocking of disabled New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski was the \u201cperformance\u201d that most \u201cstunned\u201d her. \u201cThere was nothing good about it, but it did its job,\u201d the actress said. \u201cIt kind of broke my heart when I saw it, and I still can\u2019t get it out my head because it wasn\u2019t in a movie, it was in real life. That instinct to humiliate when it\u2019s modeled by someone in a public platform, it filters down into everyone\u2019s life because it gives permission for others to do the same. \u201d \u201cDisrespect invites disrespect, violence incites violence,\u201d Streep said. Streep challenged a \u201cprincipled press\u201d to stand up to Trump \u201cto hold power to hold power to account, to call to the carpet for every outrage. Streep called on Hollywood to support the Committee to Protect Journalists, \u201cbecause we\u2019re going to need them going forward  \u2014   and they\u2019ll need us to safeguard the truth. \u201d \u201cTake your broken heart, make it into art,\u201d Streep concluded, quoting the late actress Carrie Fisher.
