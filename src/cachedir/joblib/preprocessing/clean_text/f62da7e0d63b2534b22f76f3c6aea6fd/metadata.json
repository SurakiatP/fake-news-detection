Dr. Paul R. Ehrlich \u2014  who has defended mass sterilization,   abortion and infanticide \u2014  will speak on \u201cCauses and Pathways of Biodiversity Losses: Consumption Preferences, Population Numbers, Technology, Ecosystem Productivity. \u201d To allow women to have as many children as they want, Ehrlich has said, is like letting people \u201cthrow as much of their garbage into their neighbor\u2019s backyard as they want. \u201d Ehrlich became famous through the publication of his 1968 doomsday bestseller, The Population Bomb, which generated mass hysteria over the future of the world and the earth\u2019s ability to sustain human life. In the book, Ehrlich launched a series of frightening predictions that turned out to be spectacularly wrong, creating the myth of unsustainable population growth. He prophesied that hundreds of millions would starve to death in the 1970s (and that 65 million of them would be Americans) that   India was doomed, and that odds were fair that \u201cEngland will not exist in the year 2000. \u201d Ehrlich concluded that \u201csometime in the next 15 years, the end will come,\u201d meaning \u201can utter breakdown of the capacity of the planet to support humanity. \u201d Mankind stood on the brink of Armageddon, the book proposed, because there was no way to feed the exponentially increasing world population. The opening line set the tone for the whole work: \u201cThe battle to feed all of humanity is over. \u201d Despite Ehrlich\u2019s utter failure to predict humanity\u2019s ability to feed itself, his theories will be dusted off and   in the Vatican in late February. In its brochure for the upcoming workshop, the Vatican asserts in Ehrlichian doomspeak that \u201cEarth cannot sustain\u201d our desire for \u201cenhanced consumption. \u201d Humanity is presently using about 156 percent of \u201cthe Earth\u2019s sustainable capacity\u201d every year, the text contends, and it is therefore essential to address \u201cthe question whether the Earth system is able to support the demands that humanity has been making on it\u201d and \u201chow global inequality and poverty relate to that. \u201d The conference will also feature a speaker from an environmental advocacy group called the Global Footprint Network (GFN) which each year calculates the day when the year\u2019s available resources supposedly run out and mankind begins overconsuming nature. \u201cWe use more ecological resources and services than nature can regenerate through overfishing, overharvesting forests and emitting more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than forests can sequester,\u201d the group exclaims on its website. \u201cOn August 8, 2016, we will have used as much from nature as our planet can renew in the whole year,\u201d GFN announced last summer. In their brochure, the Pontifical Academies make the counterintuitive claim that biodiversity means \u201ceverything\u201d for the human race, but then proceed to acknowledge that only 103 species of plants out of an estimated 425, 000 species produce about 90 percent of our food worldwide. Moreover, just three kinds of grain, maize, rice, and wheat, produce about 60 percent of the total, the text notes. Since none of these species are under any danger of extinction, one wonders how biodiversity can mean \u201ceverything\u201d for humanity. Just why the Vatican would wish to showcase the purveyor of debunked, apocalyptic theories is anybody\u2019s guess, but it certainly cannot bode well for the relationship between faith and science.
