Black Agenda Radio for Week of Nov. 7, 2016 Submitted by Nellie Bailey a... on Mon, 11/07/2016 - 19:35 Venezuela Hi-Tech Production in the Service of Humanity in Mississippi \\nRenaissance Jackson, the organization that briefly won the mayor\u2019s office in predominantly Black Jackson, Mississippi, has launched a campaign to purchase a coding and programming capacity and a 3-D fabrication facility. They call it \u201cFab Lab.\u201d This technology, \u201cif it is democratically controlled, could actually serve humanity,\u201d said Cooperation Jackson spokesman Kali Akuno . These kinds of projects are crucial, \u201cfirst and foremost, to satisfy some of the basic needs of our community, and -- on a deeper level -- to really put this means of production directly in our community\u2019s hands.\u201d High tech is \u201cone of these areas of the so-called \u2018digital divide\u2019 that Black people have been sorely and strategically absent from,\u201d said Akuno. \u201cSo, we are doing it for ourselves.\u201d Obamacare \u201cImploding and Beyond Repair\u201d \\nThe current wave of insurance rate hikes and medical service cutbacks is the predictable result of an Affordable Care Act (ACA) that \u201cwas pretty much a gift to the health insurance industry\u201d when Congress passed it, in 2010, said Dr. John Geyman , professor emeritus of family medicine at the University of Washington School of Medicine, in Seattle. ACA \u201cwas never designed for affordability -- it\u2019s a misnomer in the name of the bill,\u201d he said. Obamacare is \u201cimploding and beyond repair,\u201d and unsustainable. \u201cTweeks cannot work in the long term. The main fight should be for what will save money and give universal coverage to everyone: namely, single payer national health insurance.\u201d Dr. Geyman said single payer healthcare could save $500 billion a year -- about the same as the entire U.S. \u201cdefense\u201d budget. The Fight for Education for Liberation in Detroit \\nAt a \u201cCommunity Conversation on the Crisis in the Schools,\u201d Detroit activists, educators and parents gathered to address the question: \u201cWho Created the School Crisis, and How are We Responding to it?\u201d Among those wrestling with the issue was Dr. Thomas Pedroni , professor of Curriculum Studies at Wayne State University. He said the decline began with the state takeover of schools in the 1990s, and worsened dramatically after the imposition of state-appointed \u201cemergency managers.\u201d \u201cSchool could be one of the most meaningful places for our communities, but instead, it\u2019s deadened,\u201d Dr. Pedroni told the crowd at the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History. \u201cBut, we\u2019re going to fight to get back to the place where we have culturally relevant curriculum, not just producing a test score but to develop people who are self-empowered and who know how to fight for their community.\u201d Venezuela Weathering Financial Storm, Despite Disinformation Campaign \\n\u201cI challenge you to find one item of news that is positive to Venezuela in these last 16 or 17 years,\u201d said Maria Paez Victor , a Venezuelan-born sociologist living in Toronto, Canada, and author of an article titled \u201cHating Venezuela.\u201d Ms. Victor said the United States and its rightwing allies in Venezuela have kept up a non-stop disinformation campaign ever since the late Hugo Chavez and his Socialist Party were democratically elected in 1998. A crisis triggered by the collapse of world oil prices allowed the opposition to capture the legislature, last year, but Victor says the government is coping. \u201cVenezuela has managed to weather a terrible financial situation, but this is bad news for corporate capitalism and for the United States, because they want Venezuela to be controlled by their lackies.\u201d Black Agenda Radio on the Progressive Radio Network is hosted by Glen Ford and Nellie Bailey. A new edition of the program airs every Monday at 11:00am ET on PRN. Length: one hour.'"}, "time": 1742563857.8798628}
