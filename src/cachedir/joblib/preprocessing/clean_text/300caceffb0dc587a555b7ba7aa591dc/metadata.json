[Caller Ken said, \u201cI used to work in a coal mine. Coal operators, their biggest fear and why they\u2019re afraid to make major investments, is because they\u2019re afraid the Democrats will get back in office and all their investments will be wasted. And that\u2019s the biggest inhibitor to growth right now. \u201d  Caller Westin said of the climate accord, \u201cThe one thing we\u2019re missing, it\u2019s done with malice. This isn\u2019t bad policy by making a mistake. It\u2019s bad policy by choice and purpose. We have to look at what is their objective. Their objective is to pass money around, redistribute wealth, of course. But the real diabolical purpose is to crush the middle class in this country. \u201d Westin also pointed to the   backlash against the middle class for voting for Trump. Chris, calling from Pennsylvania, said, \u201cAll of these deals, it seems as if they work against the United States, our industry, etc. \u201d He added, \u201cMr. Trump, yesterday, talked about all of the negative things that would happen to various sectors in the economy, and my point is, these   left people, lefties, who rabidly support all these accords, I would think they would know what\u2019s going on on the inside. And then as soon as Obama says, \u2018Oh, yeah, we\u2019re on board,\u2019 perhaps they are shorting a portfolio of energy companies, for instance, or mining companies. \u201d Chris suggested, \u201cThey take their money and run. Then we\u2019re left holding the bag. \u201d Caller Louis said he liked to call global warming \u201cglobal communism. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a redistribution of wealth,\u201d said Louis, \u201cof them taking the money to give it to their good old boy system, mostly to people like Al Gore and whoever they arranged to take the money. And I don\u2019t think that taxpayers should take this on our shoulders so a bunch of guys can drive around in nice cars. He also said people need to look at the science and not the hype and that the climate has always been changing and will continue to change, regardless of what man does.
