[In a statement issued Saturday, Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry stated, \u201cIran will implement the principle of reciprocity until the offensive U. S. limitations against Iranian nationals are lifted. \u201d The statement made a distinction between \u201cthe American people and the hostile policies of the U. S. government. \u201d It continued to suggest that the restrictions against Muslims traveling to America \u201care an open affront against the Muslim world and the Iranian nation in particular and will be known as a great gift to extremists. \u201d  Trump\u2019s ban on travelers from seven volatile countries, including Iran, targets radical Islamic extremism but does not ban travelers simply for their Islamic faith. It is, however, a direct reaction to the rise in   extremism throughout much of the Western world. Iran remains one of the foremost abusers of human rights, and sponsors of terrorism, in the world. Trump signed the executive order on Friday, temporarily banning individuals from Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Yemen, Libya, and Somalia from entering the United States. The order also lowered the ceiling of refugees allowed to enter the United States to 50, 000 during FY 2017. Further, the executive order includes a temporary block on visas for 90 days for \u201cimmigrants and  \u201d from the aforementioned nations, and specifically directs the Secretary of State to \u201crequest all foreign governments that do not supply such information [regarding refugee vetting] to start providing such information regarding their nationals within 60 days of notification. \u201d There are more than 1 million   living in the United States, with the largest concentration of them living in Los Angeles, California. This ban imposed by the Iranian government would prevent them from traveling back to to Iran. A senior Trump administration official pushed back against the notion that Friday\u2019s executive order was a Muslim ban. The official \u201clisted off several predominantly Muslim countries that the order does not apply to. The official said that the United States still took in more foreigners than any other country in the history of civilization and said that the number of people impacted by Friday\u2019s executive order was relatively small,\u201d as reported by the New York Time\u2018s Michael Schmidt. Regarding Iran, the official \u201csaid that the White House is aware of reports that Iran plans reciprocal steps in response to Friday\u2019s executive order, adding that if those measures are indeed reciprocal, it means that the Iranians will review each individual on a case by case basis. \u201d Earlier on Saturday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani criticized Trump\u2019s intended wall across the U. S.  border. In a speech that was broadcast on Iran\u2019s   TV network, Rouhani said, \u201cToday is not the time to erect walls between nations. They have forgotten that the Berlin wall fell years ago. \u201d He echoed that statement on Twitter, writing, \u201cLet\u2019s help neighboring cultures, not build walls between nations. Let\u2019s not forget what happened to the #BerlinWall. \u201d Let\u2019s help neighboring cultures, not build walls between nations. Let\u2019s not forget what happened to the #BerlinWall.  \u2014   Hassan Rouhani (@HassanRouhani) January 28, 2017,  Following former Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani\u2019s death earlier this month, Rouhani similarly wrote, \u201cToday all people came to bid farewell to a man who made history Let us use this mood to build a bridge instead of a wall. \u201d \u0627\u0645\u0631\u0648\u0632 \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u0648\u062f\u0627\u0639 \u0628\u0627 \u0622\u0646 \u0645\u0631\u062f \u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e\\u200c\u0633\u0627\u0632 \u0647\u0645\u0647 \u0622\u0645\u062f\u0647 \u0628\u0648\u062f\u0646\u062f\u061b \u0628\u06cc\u0627\u06cc\u06cc\u0645 \u0627\u0632 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0641\u0636\u0627 \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u062f\u0648\u0633\u062a\u06cc\u060c #\u0622\u0634\u062a\u06cc \u0648 \u0648\u062d\u062f\u062a \u0645\u0644\u06cc \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0641\u0627\u062f\u0647 \u06a9\u0646\u06cc\u0645. \u0628\u062c\u0627\u06cc #\u062f\u06cc\u0648\u0627\u0631\u060c #\u067e\u0644 \u0628\u0633\u0627\u0632\u06cc\u0645. pic. twitter.   \u2014   \u062d\u0633\u0646 \u0631\u0648\u062d\u0627\u0646\u06cc (@Rouhani_ir) January 10, 2017,  According to Reuters, Rouhani also took aim at Trump\u2019s withdrawal of the U.
