[\u201cThese are challenges like we\u2019ve never seen before\u201d said Uppsala police commissioner Daniel Larsson, quoted in a press release on the force\u2019s website which states the city has \u201ca brand new street scene [  \u2026    ] today compared to just a few years ago. \u201d  Between summer 2015 and summer 2016 the city also saw a 60 per cent rise in muggings, and police reported that officers feel they are facing a \u201charsher climate and reduced respect for their profession\u201d while out on patrol. Drugs are one of the key factors driving the crime wave in Uppsala, according to the city\u2019s police, with sales of illicit substances including heroin taking place out in the open. At the end of February, Uppsalatidningen reported a huge uptick over previous weeks in the number of young people addicted to drugs who are committing robberies to fund their addiction. Recent cases noted by the newspaper include that of a    man and a    man who were attacked in muggings where the criminals seized, or attempted to wrest, jewellery from their victims\u2019 person. Mr Larsson said the robberies are linked to rocketing use of heroin  \u2014   a problem he says was previously unknown in the city  \u2014   and that \u201cat least 90 unaccompanied minors\u201d are using the drug at the Travel Centre. Noting that people from Afghanistan are \u201c \u201d among the abusers, the police commissioner suggested that this is down to the country\u2019s history of opium production as well as \u201cwell known problems of segregation\u201d. Another type of theft the police say is on the rise due to drug abuse is where large groups of young people will enter retail shops and draw the staff\u2019s attention while thefts are carried out in other parts of the store. Workers in Uppsala are feeling increasingly insecure too, due to groups of youths congregating after dark, according to area police officer Magnus Sundberg. On Friday, Moderate party MP Marta Obminska wrote to Sweden\u2019s interior minister about crime plaguing the city, where she said \u201cpeople, not just girls\u201d now find it uncomfortable to go outside. \u201cAnd this doesn\u2019t just apply during the night. People avoid the Travel Centre and some parts of town. They are attacked with a knife or gun from behind. This is not the Uppsala we desire. \u201cAccording to the police, there are ninety unaccompanied refugees in Uppsala who abuse heroin. Muggings are also carried out by the Moroccan street children. They are suspected to be a big part of personal robberies  \u2014   performed to fund addiction  \u2014   but also other criminal acts\u201d wrote the MP. Describing the situation as \u201cserious\u201d and noting there was even a shooting in the city this weekend, Ms Obminska told 24Uppsala. se that \u201cmuggings take place regularly, from early evening to morning. \u201d The Swedish establishment has been keen to discredit claims that its open border policy has led to trouble. U. S. President Donald J. Trump drew attention to the Nordic nation recently, stating at a rally that the country is \u201chaving problems like they never thought possible\u201d as a result of mass migration. Slamming the President\u2019s speech as having been designed \u201cto send a message that large scale migration harms a country\u201d Sweden\u2019s former Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt insisted that mass migration had made the country safer. But Integration Minister lva Johansson was forced into an embarrassing   on Saturday after she falsely told BBC the number of reported rapes in the country was falling. Having drawn sharp criticism from MPs, economists, and criminologists, the liberal minister had to correct herself after being told that reported rapes had risen 13 per cent from the previous year.'"}, "time": 1742563558.1763937}
