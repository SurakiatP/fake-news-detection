Explosively, WikiLeaks also claims that the CIA has lost control of their \u201chacking arsenal. \u201d Recently, the CIA lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal including malware, viruses, trojans, weaponized \u201czero day\u201d exploits, malware remote control systems and associated documentation. This extraordinary collection, which amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its possessor the entire hacking capacity of the CIA. The archive appears to have been circulated among former U. S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive. WikiLeaks states that their data dump contains information outlining the CIA\u2019s global hacking program, the large collection of malware utilized by the agency, and their \u201czero day\u201d weaponized exploits which could be used to hack \u201cApple\u2019s iPhone, Google\u2019s Android and Microsoft\u2019s Windows and even Samsung TVs, which are turned into covert microphones. \u201d Since 2001 the CIA has gained political and budgetary preeminence over the U. S. National Security Agency (NSA). The CIA found itself building not just its now infamous drone fleet, but a very different type of covert,   force  \u2014   its own substantial fleet of hackers. The agency\u2019s hacking division freed it from having to disclose its often controversial operations to the NSA (its primary bureaucratic rival) in order to draw on the NSA\u2019s hacking capacities. By the end of 2016, the CIA\u2019s hacking division, which formally falls under the agency\u2019s Center for Cyber Intelligence (CCI) had over 5000 registered users and had produced more than a thousand hacking systems, trojans, viruses, and other \u201cweaponized\u201d malware. Such is the scale of the CIA\u2019s undertaking that by 2016, its hackers had utilized more code than that used to run Facebook. The CIA had created, in effect, its \u201cown NSA\u201d with even less accountability and without publicly answering the question as to whether such a massive budgetary spend on duplicating the capacities of a rival agency could be justified. The press release notes the vulnerability of these \u201ccyber weapons\u201d and how easily they can be hijacked by third parties: Once a single cyber \u2018weapon\u2019 is \u2018loose\u2019 it can spread around the world in seconds, to be used by rival states, cyber mafia and teenage hackers alike. WikiLeaks founder and editor Julian Assange gave his own comment on the release, stating: There is an extreme proliferation risk in the development of cyber \u2018weapons\u2019. Comparisons can be drawn between the uncontrolled proliferation of such \u2018weapons\u2019 which results from the inability to contain them combined with their high market value, and the global arms trade. But the significance of \u201cYear Zero\u201d goes well beyond the choice between cyberwar and cyberpeace. The disclosure is also exceptional from a political, legal and forensic perspective.
