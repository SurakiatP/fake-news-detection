She was determined to latch on to her high approval ratings and lay the foundation for a second presidential run. That\u2019s when Anthony D. Weiner happened. The husband of Clinton\u2019s closest aide, Huma Abedin, was running for mayor of New York when it was revealed that he had continued to exchange lewd messages with women online even after the practice cost him his congressional seat. The incident brought Abedin\u2019s relationship with Clinton into the spotlight, and Clinton was once again making headlines for sexual indiscretions. Now, just weeks away from the election, Weiner has pulled her into yet another one of his dramas. Federal investigators are looking into his sexual messaging with an underage girls, and they just happened to stumble across thousands of emails that are potentially pertinent to the FBI investigation of Clinton\u2019s private email server. This was disturbing for many reasons. Americans are not happy that the Clintons have a continued behavior of standing behind those who have committed dangerous sexual or financial acts. That doesn\u2019t align well with Hillary\u2019s message about empowering women. In fact, many of Clinton\u2019s friends have suggested she distance herself from Abedin. Still, she kept Abedin close by her side as she prepared to make a statement about the new revelation to the media. \u201cWe of course stand by her,\u201d her campaign chairman, John D. Podesta, said on Saturday when he was asked whether Abedin would step down. The question on many Americans\u2019 minds now is whether Clinton\u2019s loyalty to Abedin would inspire her to bring her friend (and her drama) into the White House if she wins the presidency. What do you think? Do we need to keep Clinton and her \u2018friends\u2019 far away from the White House? Stay connected by subscribing to our news letter. Click on the button.
