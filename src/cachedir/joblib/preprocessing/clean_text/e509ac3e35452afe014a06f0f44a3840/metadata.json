The investigation was reopened due to incriminating emails found on the server of Anthony Weiner, husband of Clinton\u2019s top aide Huma Abedin. Days later, The Political Insider is reporting that the hacker group Anonymous has released a damning video exposing Abedin\u2019s shady pass. The footage reveals Abedin\u2019s extensive personal ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, and that her mother is a member of the group\u2019s counterpart organization for women. When she began interning for Clinton at the age of 20, Abedin was also working for a Jihadist legal publication which endorsed Sharia law. In addition, Abedin\u2019s family has links to Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda. Anonymous also released a video detailing Clinton\u2019s own criminal past. \\nIf you haven\u2019t checked out and liked our Facebook page, please go here and do so. Leave a comment...
