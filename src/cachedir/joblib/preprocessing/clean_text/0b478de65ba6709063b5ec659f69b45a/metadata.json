He also understands that Putin of \u201cChristian Russia\u201d should not be our enemy but our ally. He is an avowed enemy of the Jewish warmonger traitors called \u201cNeocons\u201d and they in turn intensely hate this U.S. Army General who truly puts America First. \\nAttorney General Sessions has been hated for years by the Jewish-dominated media for his opposition to massive immigration into America and for the fact that he has dared to publicly oppose the massive, institutionalized racial discrimination against white people called affirmative action. \\nDuring his U.S. Senate confirmation hearings Senators should demand that he expose the blatant media and political blather of \u201cequal rights and opportunity\u201d when white people face massive racial discrimination as well as a media hate campaign against the people whose ancestors created America! \\nWe must demand the protection of the civil rights of all Americans including white people! Everyone must be judged on their merit and not the unfair and destructive anti-white affirmative action racist policies that dominate major corporations, Federal, State, and city governments, colleges and educational institutions. \\nBravo President Trump! Some Great First Steps!'"}, "time": 1742564267.158883}
