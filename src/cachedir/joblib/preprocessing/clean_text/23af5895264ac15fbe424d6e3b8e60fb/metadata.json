One feminist, Ruth Booth, declared, \u201cWomen! Light another torch of freedom! Fight another sex taboo!\u201d \\nBernays\u2019 influence extended far beyond advertising. His greatest success was his role in convincing the American public to join the slaughter of the First World War. The secret, he said, was \u201cengineering the consent\u201d of people in order to \u201ccontrol and regiment [them] according to our will without their knowing about it\u201d. \\nHe described this as \u201cthe true ruling power in our society\u201d and called it an \u201cinvisible government\u201d. \\nToday, the invisible government has never been more powerful and less understood. In my career as a journalist and film-maker, I have never known propaganda to insinuate our lives and as it does now and to go unchallenged. \\nImagine two cities. \\nBoth are under siege by the forces of the government of that country. Both cities are occupied by fanatics, who commit terrible atrocities, such as beheading people. \\nBut there is a vital difference. In one siege, the government soldiers are described as liberators by Western reporters\u2026'"}, "time": 1742628594.7932281}
