[The seasoned Republican operative was one of the few staffers respected by establishment Republicans in Washington, D. C. but was ultimately unwilling to continue to try to shape a daily narrative for the Trump White House.  Dubke resigned on May 18, according to Axios\u2019s Mike Allen, after taking the job in March. He was viewed as a professional close to White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer and Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, both familiar with the workings of Washington, D. C. Mainstream media reporters also respected Dubke\u2019s background as a    operative who worked in Karl Rove\u2019s orbit. But Trump loyalists never trusted Dubke, seeing him as an establishment figure who didn\u2019t understand the president\u2019s strengths. Communications professionals in Washington view Dubke\u2019s job as impossible as President Donald Trump sets most of his communications strategy himself on Twitter while leaving staffers to fill in the gaps.'"}, "time": 1742563212.988068}
