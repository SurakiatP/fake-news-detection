[Candidate Rep. Keith Ellison\u2019s decision to share the microphone with CAIR director on Wednesday afternoon highlights the willingness of party activists to deepen their alliance with the small number of radical Muslim voters living in the United States, despite the huge ideological conflicts between the party\u2019s liberal base and the Muslim groups\u2019 toxic Islamic ideology and aggressive Arab politics.  Ellison is a leading candidate to become chairman of the Democratic National Committee, who will be chosen by a party vote in late February. He has public support from the Democrats\u2019 leader in the Senate. Sen. Chuck Schumer, but faces growing opposition from former labor secretary Tom Perez. The press conference was called to protest President Donald Trump\u2019s popular policy to curb immigration of people with \u201chostile attitudes. \u201d Both Ellison and Awad insisted the hostile attitudes policy is   even though it only seeks to exclude people who: do not support the Constitution, or those who would place violent ideologies over American law   \u2026     those who engage in acts of bigotry or hatred (including \u201chonor\u201d killings, other forms of violence against women, or the persecution of those who practice religions different from their own) or those who would oppress Americans of any race, gender, or sexual orientation. Ellison is already facing criticism for his closeness to the Islamic groups. For example, the   League flipped from support to opposition. His public appearance with Awad could add to his political problems. In a Tweeted photograph from Ellison\u2019s office, Awad is the partly bald man with a red scarf standing to left of the microphones. Ellison is just to the right of the microphones, wearing a red tie and holding a sheet of paper.
