[FreedomWorks issued their statement in the wake of the Freedom Caucus\u2019s press conference with Senators Rand Paul ( ) and Mike Lee ( ) opposing the speaker\u2019s plan to repeal and replace Obamacare.  Jason Pye, director of public policy and legislative affairs for FreedomWorks, said: We support Rep. Jim Jordan and the Freedom Caucus\u2019s decision to introduce repeal only legislation that passed last term. I\u2019m proud of the members who still plan to keep their campaign promises. Unfortunately, some of them were committing fraud against the American people, voting for repeal when they knew Obama wouldn\u2019t sign it. Now they\u2019re supporting a different variety of Obamacare. FreedomWorks is an influential conservative grassroots organization that helped elect many conservative lawmakers. FreedomWorks\u2019 opposition to the current \u201c \u201d package might put the bill in jeopardy. Congressmen Jim Jordan ( ) and Mark Meadows ( ) oppose Speaker Ryan\u2019s Obamacare repeal package. Senators Lee and Paul\u2019s opposition to the bill might endanger its chances of passing through the U. S. Senate.
