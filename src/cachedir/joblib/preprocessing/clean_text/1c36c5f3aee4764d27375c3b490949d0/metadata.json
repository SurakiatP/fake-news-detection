[Polish community leaders claimed the aspects of Britain that migrants like best, its \u201cculture of tolerance\u201d and \u201cdiversity\u201d have been shattered since the Brexit vote because people have been emboldened to carry out verbal and physical attacks against migrants.  \u201cEvery statement and every political activity around Brexit negotiations brings a spike in inquiries to our organisation. We expect when article 50 is triggered it will bring another level of discontent,\u201d Barbara Drozdowicz, of the East European Resource Centre (EERC) told the Commons Home Affairs Committee. Ms. Drozdowicz fingered criticism of mass migration as a driver of \u2018hate\u2019 in response to a question by fierce Remain campaigner Chuka Umunna. The Labour MP pointed to \u201cLeave. EU, UKIP obviously\u201d when he asked the EERC director whether she believes the \u201cLeave campaign\u201d and   figures \u201cbear a responsibility\u201d for   attacks. \u201cThe campaign was built on controlling migration. \u2018Controlling migration\u2019 is not a neutral term,\u201d she told MPs. When Conservative David Burrowes noted that most examples of \u2018hate\u2019 are expressed online, community leaders admitted they\u2019ve neither seen nor had reports of content on the internet that\u2019s abusive to migrants from Europe. Tadeusz Stenzel, the chair of trustees at the Federation of Poles in Great Britain, suggested there might be a language barrier which prevents European migrants from being able to understand abusive posts and report them. MPs heard that European migrants began reporting \u2018hate crimes\u2019 in around April of last year as the referendum campaign got into gear, but that only after Britons voted to leave the European Union (EU) was the resource centre inundated with an \u201cexplosion of calls\u201d. Ms. Drozdowicz said migrants from Eastern Europe reported being told to \u201cgo home\u201d and hearing \u2018casual hate speech\u2019 on public transport and that the centre heard about violent incidents including a Polish child being beaten up at school. Chairman of the committee, Yvette Cooper, said the details of incidents that were talked about in the session were \u201cappalling\u201d. \u201cHate crime is appalling,   and should have no place in our country,\u201d she said. Heading the government\u2019s inquiry into \u2018hate crime\u2019 in November, Ms. Cooper accused the campaigns of both Leave, during the EU referendum, and Donald Trump, in the U. S. presidential race, of having incited hatred.'"}, "time": 1742628593.6720161}
