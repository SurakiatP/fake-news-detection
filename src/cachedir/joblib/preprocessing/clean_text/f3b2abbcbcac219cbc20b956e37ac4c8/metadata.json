The sovereign state is not sovereign at all. Days before a referendum on leaving the European Union, those are the images of Britain\u2019s plight advanced by the   Brexiteers, who are campaigning for their nation to signal a muscular new era of independence by leaving the   bloc. But the English have been there before. Five centuries ago, King Henry VIII, chafing at the theological and financial clout of the papacy, broke with Rome and led his subjects into the new pastures of the Church of England, with himself as its supreme overlord. It was a step that changed Christendom, molding faith and identity to this day among the world\u2019s roughly 85 million Anglicans. In the process, \u201cEngland ceased to be part of a huge, medieval,   European empire and instead became an independent sovereign   free from \u2018the authority of any foreign potentate\u2019  \u2014   above all the Pope,\u201d Adrian Pabst, a lecturer in politics at the University of Kent, wrote in The Guardian in 2009. \u201cIf you ever wondered about the origins of English euroskepticism, look no further than the Protestant Reformation. \u201d Historical parallels can be facile if not misleading, and the differences between the two eras are profound, not least in the democratic nature of Britain\u2019s decision this time. But the echoes are strong enough to resonate at a moment when Britain is looking to its past for lessons that would apply to its future. Henry\u2019s pique was rooted in Rome\u2019s refusal to annul his first marriage, to Catherine of Aragon. He went on to take five more wives in his quest for a male heir, in direct contradiction of Catholic orthodoxy. The Brexiteers\u2019 campaign is also about divorce  \u2014   of nations and economies, perhaps, but certainly just as permanent, and with potentially   consequences. When Britons vote on Thursday, they may do so at the same polling stations used during national elections. Yet for the side that loses the ballot, \u201cthere is no   no consoling thought in defeat that, at least, there\u2019s always next season,\u201d the columnist Alex Massie wrote on The Spectator\u2019s website. \u201cNo, defeat is permanent and for keeps. \u201d By coincidence, perhaps, the campaign has gathered pace at a time when the national imagination has been caught by the blockbuster success of Hilary Mantel\u2019s novels \u201cWolf Hall\u201d and \u201cBring Up the Bodies,\u201d set during Henry VIII\u2019s reign and reviving the issue of how the elite relate to adversaries at home and foes abroad. Ms. Mantel was among almost 300 cultural figures  \u2014   actors and writers among them  \u2014   who signed a public letter last month urging a vote to remain part of the European Union. \u201cWhat kind of nation do we want to be?\u201d the letter asked. \u201cAre we   and open to working with others to achieve more? Or do we close ourselves off from our friends and neighbors at a time of increasing global uncertainty?\u201d The   goes beyond that. Over centuries, England, and then Britain, has strutted the global stage as an imperial overlord whose people sometimes seem more comfortable in the guise of underdogs. The national psyche rests on a history of invasion, submission, conquest and    \u2014   from the Romans and the   through the Normans and on to dynasties entwined with the royal houses of Europe. In more recent years, waves of immigration  \u2014   Jamaicans in the 1950s, then Pakistanis, Indians and other Asians in the 1960s  \u2014   have reshaped the country\u2019s demographics. Christianity, prevalent in Henry\u2019s day, is professed by less than half the population. The loss of an empire and the rise of a complex, interconnected global economy has rekindled the notion that, in times of flux, the English define themselves by their opposition to a bigger outside power  \u2014   the papacy in the 16th century the European Union in the 21st. This    theme suffused Churchill\u2019s speeches during World War II as Hitler\u2019s armies spread across Europe to the Continent\u2019s coastline. \u201cWe shall never surrender,\u201d Churchill declared in 1940, albeit with the caveat that Britain would fight on until \u201cthe New World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old. \u201d Today\u2019s political leaders can barely resist the Churchillian mantra. Facing hostile questioning from a television audience on Sunday, a rattled Prime Minister David Cameron pointed out that \u201cat my office I sit two yards from\u201d where Churchill \u201cresolved to fight on against Hitler. \u201d Churchill did not wish to be alone, Mr. Cameron said. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t quit,\u201d the prime minister added. \u201cHe didn\u2019t quit on democracy, he didn\u2019t quit on freedom. We want to fight for those things today. \u201d It was also Churchill, who, in 1930, foreshadowed one of the Brexiteers\u2019 arguments in an   article in the Saturday Evening Post. \u201cWe see nothing but good and hope in a richer, freer, more contented European commonalty,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we have our own dream and our own task. We are with Europe, but not of it. We are linked, but not comprised. We are interested and associated, but not absorbed. \u201d David Starkey, a Cambridge historian critical of the European Union, has drawn a direct parallel with the modern battle for the nation\u2019s soul. \u201cEngland\u2019s semidetached relationship with continental Europe is neither new nor an aberration,\u201d he wrote in 2012. \u201cInstead, it is deeply rooted in the political development of the past 500 years. \u201d The   debate \u201cwas couched in strikingly \u2018modern\u2019 terms,\u201d Dr. Starkey wrote, with Henry\u2019s opponents arguing the case for papal authority \u201clike a contemporary europhile,\u201d maintaining that England was \u201csubordinate to the laws and values of a   Christendom. \u201d \u201cHenry VIII\u2019s judges replied, on the contrary, that statute was binding and Parliament sovereign,\u201d Dr. Starkey said. Then, as now, the notion of sovereignty was central to the discussion, and the implications were enormous. By breaking with Rome, some historians argue, the English came to see themselves a nation apart  \u2014   a   magnified by the Act of Union with Scotland in 1707 and by centuries of colonial expansion. \u201cImperial Britain was isolationist, xenophobic,   and nationalist,\u201d the historian Edwin Jones wrote in 1998, and a combination of these elements \u201chelped to sustain the   of the British\u201d in the early 18th century, he added. In 1848, Lord Palmerston, then the foreign secretary, told Parliament: \u201cI may say without any vainglorious boast or without great offense to anyone that we stand at the head of moral, social and political civilization. Our task is to lead the way and direct the march of other nations. \u201d But the British always seem to qualify global ambition with the kind of parochial preoccupations that persuaded Adam Smith in 1776 to coin the phrase \u201ca nation of shopkeepers. \u201d As the empire grew, indeed, a group known as the Little Englanders advocated a retreat from headlong colonial expansion, particularly in southern Africa. These days, the term endures as a derogatory epithet for the Brexiteers, who prefer to claim the mantle of a reawakened Britannia ruling newer waves  \u2014   this time through a web of trade deals and alliances beyond the perceived narrow constraints and petty regulation of Brussels. Some argue that the dominant strand of the Brexiteers\u2019 DNA lies in what A. A. Gill, a columnist for The Sunday Times, called \u201cthe most pernicious and debilitating Little English drug, nostalgia. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562963.1183803}
