You went on to say that the Clintons have a high body count. Do you believe that the Clintons really are killing people?\u2019\\nShe responded by saying: \u2018You know, sometimes we look at patterns and we look at things that are happening and sometimes you can\u2019t dismiss everything as a conspiracy.\u2019\\nWeinstein then asked Lahren if she was referring to the conspiracy theory held by some that the Clintons were somehow responsible for the death of Vince Foster, a close friend of the couple who was found dead in 1993 of what was later ruled to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\\n\u2018The list \u2013 I will let your listeners go on and look at some of these examples and they can decide for themselves,\u2019 said Lahren.\\n\u2018But there\u2019s been some mysterious circumstances that have surrounded \u2013 we just saw, what with the DNC leaks and then what happened to a person that worked for the DNC that was in charge of that?\u2019\\nLahren was referring to the death of Seth Rich, who was murdered near his home in Washington DC this past July.\\nSoon after, DailyMail.com learned that he was set to start working for Hillary\u2019s campaign.\\nWeinstein pointed out to Lahren that Rich\u2019s parents said they do not suspect anything \u2018suspicious,\u2019 to which she replied: \u2018Well, his family doesn\u2019t want to be in a body bag either, Jamie.\\n\u2018I have got to be honest with you. What was it? He came in and was robbed, but his wallet and his watch weren\u2019t taken? So he was robbed and what was he\u2026\u2019\\nAnd another claim: \u2018Sometimes you can\u2019t dismiss everything as a conspiracy,\u2019 said Lahren (Clinton above with Vince Foster, whose death Lahren also finds mysterious)\\nOne more claim: Lahren also spoke about the death of DNC worker Seth Rich (above), saying his parents are keeping quiet out of fear of ending up in a \u2018body bag\u2019\\nAt this point Weinsten jumped in to say: \u2018You think he might have been killed by the Clintons?\u2019\\nLahren responded to this by stating: \u2018I don\u2019t know if he was killed by the Clintons or a Clinton hit person. I\u2019m not going to sit here and be what you want me to be which is a conspiracy theorist, but I will say\u2026\u2019\\nWeinsten then cut in briefly to point out he was just asking Lahren questions.\\nLahren continued: \u201cI think there are a lot of circumstances that surround the Clinton family that aren\u2019t explainable and I will let people go on and research it for themselves. And if they think there is something fishy going on, I leave it to them. I certainly do.\u201d\\nSource \\n'"}, "time": 1742562017.1687458}
