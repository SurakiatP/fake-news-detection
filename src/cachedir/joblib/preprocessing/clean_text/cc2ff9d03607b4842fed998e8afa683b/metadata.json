Insult whomever you wish. Shoot an immigrant on Fifth Avenue. Fire the losers who support you.  \u2014   SBMD in Florida, reacting to an article about a tape that captures Donald J. Trump speaking in vulgar terms about groping women.  2. A private conversation which reflects his public behavior. The man has no discretion. Other presidents may have been equally interested in scoring with women but they had the grace not to demean them in public. Obviously, marital vows mean nothing to him, which raises the question what vows will he keep, i. e. [to] uphold the Constitution and fulfill the duties of office of the presidency, so help me God?  \u2014   Angela Mogin in San Mateo, Calif. 3. Trump paid exactly what was required of him by law, so what\u2019s the issue? Should he have offered to pay more than what was owed? How many people on here can say that come tax time they wish to pay over and above what they owe?  \u2014   Tom Langlais on The Times\u2019s Facebook page, responding to our reporting about Mr. Trump\u2019s 1995 taxes, which showed a $916 million loss, enough to enable Mr. Trump to avoid paying federal income tax for up to 18 years. This comment received more than 700 likes.  4. It is nobody\u2019s obligation to pay more tax than the law demands. If Donald Trump could order his affairs in such a way that his income tax responsibility was ZERO for any particular year, or series of years, that\u2019s fine with me. But whether or not Donald Trump pays taxes is NOT the issue. The issue is whether or not the tax system is fair. If the law is such that Donald Trump could have the kind of money he has and actually owe no federal income tax, then the law needs to be changed drastically. So ask yourself: Which party, and which candidate, do you think is sincerely interested in changing the income tax laws to make them fairer for the vast majority of us, rather than something to be manipulated by the wealthy?  \u2014   Boneisha in Atlanta.  5. Mr. Kaine brilliantly phrased the only question worth asking when he repeatedly grilled Mr. Pence, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you trust women to make this choice?\u201d I was (surprisingly) moved to tears to hear a man say these words with so much force and conviction. In my 45 years I have never heard a politician stick his neck out for women\u2019s rights like he did.  \u2014   Alibumbayay in Washington, reacting to an   essay by Katha Pollitt about the   debate and the candidates\u2019 views on abortion and women\u2019s rights. This comment received more than 1, 700 reader recommendations.  6. It was so refreshing to hear Mike Pence speak about his   position and not apologize for his beliefs. Some may not see this as the most important factor for voting for a presidential candidate but many of us still feel it is necessary to discuss abortion and the threat to innocent human life. To me it is very important and I want my president to respect and value life. I wish the Democrats cared about abortion and the destruction it causes as much as they do about other political issues such as free education and health care.  \u2014   KMW in New York. This comment received more than 40 reader responses. 7. Far from being a distraction from \u201creal issues,\u201d I think looking at the candidates\u2019 marriage histories tells us a lot about how they may govern as president. My takeaway is that Hillary sees all that is good inside a flawed relationship, and instead of abandoning it when unpleasant truths emerge, she confronts the problem, and works to figure out how to save what\u2019s good and change the bad. That\u2019s exactly her approach to governing. Trump, in contrast, appears to view marriage like car ownership. He loves to show it off, and really enjoys the ride, but upgrades to a newer model every six years or so. That same mentality is evident in his policy prescriptions for international treaties, trade agreements, and public policy. Once something stops being 100% favorable to him, it\u2019s time to replace it with something brand new, without any real   analysis or thought to   consequences. I think any voter, regardless of party, who has survived and flourished in a   relationship will clearly recognize how meaningful the wisdom and tolerance, and empathy, and capacity for compromise that marriage engenders is perhaps the most telling qualification for serving as president.  \u2014   DavidH in Brooklyn, responding to an article about Hillary Clinton\u2019s reactions to Bill Clinton\u2019s affairs during their political careers. This comment received more than 700 reader recommendations. 8. I really hope that common ground can be found. A telescope is no   power plant and while it certainly has environmental impacts, those impacts can be reduced to a minimum, when given a little attention and foresight. I believe the protests against this particular telescope, and the telescopes in general, are more of a symptom of how the native [Hawaiians] feel about their general treatment and how little they have been involved in processes affecting their cultural and historical backgrounds. This is a possibility for them to shine some light on their situation and get media attention. If both sides are   a solution can surely be found.  \u2014   Pierre Markuse in Germany, reacting to an article about a clash between astronomers and native Hawaiians over a proposed telescope, which would be the biggest and most expensive of its kind in the Northern Hemisphere.  9. My    mom, when she feels she has been served well, loves to ask for the manager. She then compliments like crazy, whoever it was that was kind to her. Whether it\u2019s the porter in her building, a waiter, a store clerk or a receptionist, she is sure to inform their boss. \u201cPeople are so fast to complain,\u201d she likes to say, \u201cbut it\u2019s so easy to take the time to be thankful. \u201d Mr. DeMarco\u2019s letter reminds me of my mom. No matter the circumstance, acknowledge and appreciate a job well done.  \u2014   Forbes in New York, reacting to an article about a letter sent to the hospital staff by a man after his wife died following an asthma attack, thanking them for caring for her, their families and himself. 10. A man goes for a walk and finds a bottle on a beach. When he pops the cork a genie appears and says, \u201cI shall grant you one wish. \u201d The man says, \u201cI want to see peace in the Middle East. \u201d He then hands the genie a map of the Middle East. The genie studies the map for a while and finally says, \u201cWhat you wish for is impossible. So I shall grant you another wish. \u201d The man says, \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to see the Cubs in a World Series. \u201d The genie replies, \u201cLet me see that map again. \u201d  \u2014   Marianne in Edmonds, Wash. reacting to an article about whether the Chicago Cubs might win a World Series title for the first time since 1908.'"}, "time": 1742562432.3352747}
