It\u2019s hard to top, that is, unless you happen to have a dragon with a flair for dramatic timing. So it went on Sunday, as Daenerys Targaryen wrapped up this week\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d with a stump speech for the ages. Populist rhetoric? Check. I know most khals prefer an elite inner circle of bloodriders, Dany told the assembled, but I want you all. Relatable local reference? Check. I remember like it was yesterday, Khal Drogo promising me the Seven Kingdoms at the Mother of Mountains, easily my favorite mountain in Essos. Demonization of outsiders? You better believe it. Look at them over there, with their iron suits and stone houses. They think they\u2019re better than you, but we\u2019re going to show them different. Oh and by the way, did you happen to notice that I\u2019m sitting on an actual dragon right now and let me hear you say it: Are you with me? Now and always? They were. It\u2019s hard to blame them  \u2014   it was quite the performance. I was ready to air out some iron suits and tear down a stone house or two myself, and I don\u2019t even own an arakh. Dany\u2019s dragon rally wrapped up an episode titled \u201cBlood of My Blood,\u201d which you may recall is how Dothraki leaders and bloodriders address one another. The phrase also applied neatly to nearly every other story of the night. There was the excruciating      in Horn Hill, as well as the loathsome Walder Frey\u2019s harsh treatment of his own   . (Welcome back, Tobias Menzies.) In King\u2019s Landing, the marriage of Tommen and Margaery and their ongoing issues create all sorts of awkward ties between the Lannisters and Tyrells. That whole thing\u2019s not going to end well. Finally there was Uncle Benjen, the brother of Ned Stark, who made a heroic return to the story, saving Bran and Meera from their Wight pursuers with some sort of flaming mace. (I guess all the other Wights got lost?) But first back to Dany. The speech, a near copy of the one Khal Drogo made in Season 1, was fiery enough to almost make me overlook a couple of things. One was the convenience of Drogon\u2019s arrival, as alluded to above. You\u2019ll recall that he was the one who kicked off this whole Dothraki revival tour at the end of last season by dumping Dany in a field and apparently disappearing. Now he\u2019s back at her beck and call? Or are we to believe that Drogon knew all along that Dany\u2019s capture was for the best in the long run? (Can dragons have greensight?) I guess another possibility is that this was the plan all along  \u2014   that once Dany realized where she was, she hatched a plan to be captured and assume command of the Dothraki forces. But if that was the case, why not just use the dragon to do it? (Or why leave the ring for Daario and Jorah to find?) It\u2019s not a huge thing, but I hope the writers clarify at some point rather than continuing to rely on the Drogon ex machina route. The other thing: Dany didn\u2019t exactly refute Daario\u2019s point that she was a conqueror, not a   did she? Rather, he almost seemed to remind her oh yeah, I\u2019ve been meaning to rile up everyone with my dragon  \u2026     My colleague James Poniewozik recently wrote about Dany\u2019s inclination toward \u201cpermanent revolution,\u201d contrasting it with Tyrion\u2019s belief in realpolitik solutions. Will Tyrion\u2019s steadying hand be enough to offset Dany\u2019s   proclivities, or at least keep her from burning everything up the way her mad father did? She certainly seems to have a knack for it. I assume that was him, the Mad King Aerys II, in Bran\u2019s visions. He seemed just as charming as advertised. It was interesting that the show chose to include him in the same episode that found Dany reaffirming her   toppling intentions  \u2014   could it have been a warning? Which is to say: Are we sure we want Dany to be successful in her attempt to retake Westeros? She\u2019s been a sympathetic character largely because she\u2019s been a liberator of the oppressed, but isn\u2019t that also an expedient way to build an army? Have we been backing someone who would actually be a disastrous ruler? For the record, I would love it if the mother of dragons turned out to be a villain in this story, though I don\u2019t really expect it to go that way. (The dragons seem destined to be the fire opposing the White Walkers\u2019 ice.) But there could be a fascinating reckoning coming, though it likely won\u2019t be anytime soon. This is Dany we\u2019re talking about  \u2014   so far she\u2019s more prone to spinning wheels than breaking them. It could take her another season and a half just to get back to Meereen. Speaking of leisurely arcs, Benjen\u2019s been missing for a while  \u2014   it turns out he was killed by White Walkers but saved by a strategic dragonglass stab by some forest children. (Read that sentence again this show is so nutty sometimes.) Bran spent much of the escape trying to boot up like a   cable box, downloading seemingly the entire story, including some intriguing things we haven\u2019t seen yet. (Troubling thought: What if this whole show ends with Bran staring at a snow globe?) The good news for Bran is that he traded a Hodor for a ranger, an upgrade in ability if not in heart. (No offense, big guy, wherever you are.) The previous   Raven brought in Benjen to watch Bran\u2019s back, and he also suggested that they\u2019d all be returning to the main story soon, hopefully, by heading to the Wall to wait for the Night King. I\u2019m sure Jon Snow will appreciate having another formerly dead guy around, too  \u2014   maybe they can start a support group. Back in King\u2019s Landing, the High Sparrow is proving cagier than many of us probably expected (or wanted). The joint   offensive came to naught because the Sparrow and Margaery brought Tommen into the fold. What just happened? Mace the lovable doofus asked his mother in King\u2019s Landing. \u201cHe\u2019s beaten us,\u201d she replied. Of course, it\u2019s easy to look smart when your opponent is an inbred   a few swords shy of a throne. (If Joffrey\u2019s penalty for Jaime and Cersei\u2019s sins was psychopathy, Tommen\u2019s would seem to be imbecility.) Not only did Tommen thwart the planned overthrow of the Faith Militant by embracing it, he shunted Jaime off to deal with the Blackfish situation at Riverrun. That\u2019s fine with me: I like Jaime better on the road, anyway, especially if he takes Bronn with him. (The preview of next week\u2019s episode seemed to suggest as much.) Cersei was good with it, too. \u201cStand at the head of our army where you belong,\u201d she told him. \u201cShow them what Lannisters are   \u2026    \u201d And then they both got so fired up with all the revenge talk, they collapsed into each other\u2019s arms. Don\u2019t ever change, you crazy kids. I don\u2019t think for a second that Margaery is buying any of the Sparrow rhetoric  \u2014   if you had any doubt that she was a formidable operator, notice how slickly she avoided her own walk of shame. But I\u2019m actually more intrigued by the person we\u2019ve seen hardly at all: her brother Loras. When we last saw him, he was coming apart, groveling in the dirt and ready to do anything to make it all stop. I can\u2019t help thinking the show is setting him up for some sort of shocking kamikaze act. Tommen is too valuable to Margaery  \u2014   she controls him and if he goes, she\u2019ll be left looking for another heir to hook up with. (I don\u2019t even know who would be next, aside from the eternally rowing Gendry.) Jaime is heading out to Riverrun. So that leaves   \u2026     Cersei? Would the show go there? She has a trial by combat coming up, as she reminded us Sunday. And when\u2019s the last time anything went wrong at one of those? Sorry  \u2014   I meant \u201cright. \u201d When\u2019s the last time anything went right at one of those? Finally, over at Tarly Acres, Sam\u2019s big reunion with his family combined the real twin pillars of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d: Awful fathers and terrible dinner parties. Meeting the prospective   is always tense, even if you don\u2019t belong to a loathed people and your significant other isn\u2019t hated by one of his parents. Which is to say: Gilly never really stood a chance of being accepted. And Sam knew it, strategically withholding all potentially inflammatory information from his letter. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a very large piece of parchment,\u201d he explained pathetically, which I enjoyed. But hey, at least they got a nice sword out of it. I\u2019m not totally sure why the show\u2019s spending so much time on Sam and Gilly, aside from perhaps using them to stand in for all the humble family units at risk of getting ground up by these clashes between more powerful clans. That said, you saw Sam\u2019s house. He\u2019s not exactly the salt of the earth. I imagine the whole point of the homecoming was to put that Valyrian steel sword in Sam\u2019s hands for future use. You will never wield that sword, his father told him, which I imagine most of us heard as \u201cyou will definitely be wielding that sword before long. \u201d It happened quicker than I thought, but good for him. With a dad like that, he deserves it. \u2022 It looks like our long, faceless nightmare may almost be over: Arya has effectively cut her ties with the House of Black and White. We thought she seemed unlikely to kill the Meryl Streep of Braavos and she did not, which no doubt delighted the horrible Waif. (Jaqen\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t let her suffer\u201d absolutely went in one ear and out the other.) I\u2019m happy for Arya to introduce the Waif to Needle and then move on, perhaps as a new understudy to replace the troupe\u2019s resident Eve Harrington. I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve seen the last of those guys, based on the warmth between Arya and the actress, and the casting of Richard E. Grant as the temperamental playwright. \u2022 I don\u2019t think we\u2019re through with Jaqen either, or he with Arya. I suspect all the apparent exceptions he\u2019s made for her  \u2014   overlooking her nobility, giving her another chance after she killed Meryn Trant  \u2014   signal an agenda he hasn\u2019t revealed yet. I do think we\u2019re done with stick beatings though, and for that, a man is glad. \u2022 \u201cI think our father could learn a thing or two from your father,\u201d Sam\u2019s sister told Gilly, which made me laugh, and then made me feel guilty for laughing. Craster was the worst, which is saying something on this show. \u2022 You need at least 1, 000 ships, Daario told Dany. Hmm, if only there were a couple of renegade siblings with a bunch of ships   \u2026     \u2022 Hodor. (Never forget.) \u2022 What did you think? Was dinner at the Tarlys the worst one yet? What did you make of Bran\u2019s visions? Who\u2019s naming these swords, anyway? (Heartsbane?) Who\u2019s been the most reprehensible father on this show?
