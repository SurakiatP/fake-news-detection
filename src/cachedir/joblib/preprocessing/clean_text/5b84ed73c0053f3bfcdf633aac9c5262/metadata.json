The sleight of hand that made \u201cEarned It,\u201d the Weeknd\u2019s magisterial song for the original \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d film, so effective was that it relied on a sort of bondage, balancing the tension between its polished exterior and what was easy to imagine as its   core. \u201cI Don\u2019t Wanna Live Forever,\u201d the first offering from the film\u2019s sequel, by ZAYN and Taylor Swift, (available on Apple Music) has no such struggle. There\u2019s little moistness here: ZAYN\u2019s sweet vocals never manage anguish or tension, and Ms. Swift has perhaps never been more obscured by digital manipulation, in places to the point where she\u2019s practically anonymized. The pleading in the song is clinical, the chemistry muted. (An opportunity for Ms. Swift to strike back at an ex is largely missed  \u2014   ZAYN is a former bandmate of Harry Styles, her   paramour.) The thickness of the production conveys the urgency here  \u2014   in the beginning, it recalls the hollers of Ms. Swift\u2019s \u201cOut of the Woods\u201d  \u2014   and the chorus gleams. But the song never sweats, nor threatens to. JON CARAMANICA Here\u2019s one way to announce a comeback: \u201cTrying to win your interest   you ain\u2019t having none of that. \u201d That\u2019s the salutation from Jim and William Reid, the brothers who lead the Jesus and Mary Chain, which released its last album in 1998 but has been touring sporadically since 2007. \u201cAmputation\u201d opens a new album due in March, \u201cDamage and Joy,\u201d and it barely budges from the sound the Jesus and Mary Chain perfected on \u201cPsychocandy\u201d in 1985. It\u2019s   rock sung with cynical conviction and barricaded with layer upon layer of distorted guitars and additional noise, like the sizzling whistle that opens the track and squeals throughout. The mandate is to keep thickening the mix, loading on the irritants and cranking them up: the way sweet falsetto \u201coohs\u201d arrive with vicious feedback at 1:25, and the way the chorus is chanted for the final minute and a half over implacable drums and a massive pileup of lead and rhythm guitars. It\u2019s not chaos it\u2019s strategic cacophony. JON PARELES Rage spews every which way in \u201cGoverned by Contagions,\u201d the first song in 16 years from the reunited At The  . The beat gallops and pummels Omar  \u2019s guitar parts proceed from buzzing, nagging repetition to jagged leaps to screeching tremolo chords, and the singer and lyricist Cedric   rails, obliquely, about desperate people facing detested adversaries, \u201csinging cannibal hymns of the bourgeoisie,\u201d and envisioning revolution: \u201cThat\u2019s the way the guillotine claps,\u201d a chorus declares. It\u2019s as precise in its aggression as At The Drive In\u2019s     has always been it\u2019s also a gauntlet thrown down. J. P. The title of Ryan Adams\u2019s coming album, \u201cThe Prisoner,\u201d refers to an emotional state  \u2014   specifically, what it means to be consumed or paralyzed by desire. On the album\u2019s   lead single and opening track, \u201cDo You Still Love Me? ,\u201d his lyrics suggest the perspective of someone trying to catch sand as it slips through his hands. The chorus consists of the title phrase (with a \u201cbabe\u201d added for good measure) while one verse elaborates further: \u201cWhat can I say? I didn\u2019t want it to change Is my heart blind and our love so strange?\u201d \u201cThe Prisoner\u201d is due out on Feb. 17. NATE CHINEN Here\u2019s a   bash from a     band that\u2019s equally raucous and   confronting mortality, media and general pandemonium all at once. It\u2019s from the provocatively titled album \u201cNazi Hologram. \u201d The verses pound one chord into   drone ecstasy the bridges jump around but come back to that drone. \u201cAs I lay there   cruised up to   had something she was   looked sinister and   stuck it in   stuck it in me!\u201d Then the drums crash harder and Andrew Katz sings, \u201cTurn on your TV sets!\u201d J. P. Sure, there\u2019s plenty of gimmickry in pop music, but it\u2019s admirable when someone leans in to it as convincingly as Post Malone does. He\u2019s a    singer with a   background his music is both pointedly hybridized and abstract enough that it can be interpreted many different ways. On \u201cCold\u201d  \u2014   a standout from his major label debut album, \u201cStoney,\u201d which was released today  \u2014   he ups the ante even further. The singing is spectral, the cadence is practically spoken, and, as a bonus, the beat is   with thumps that flicker on and off. The result is unusual and impressive: \u201cCold\u201d flirts with everything, and commits to nothing. J. C. Hurray for the Riff Raff hasn\u2019t had to pivot to become part of the resistance. But on its new song, the band sharpens its aim and agenda, aligning with protesters at Standing Rock and in Pe\u00f1uelas, Puerto Rico. Alynda Segarra, the songwriter at the helm of Hurray, sings of cultural theft and systemic oppression, naming no names but making her opposition clear: \u201cNow all the politicians, they just squawk their mouths They said \u2018We\u2019ll build a wall to keep them out\u2019\u201d The song, which rides a percussive   groove (and has some fine guitar playing) is an early taste of \u201cThe Navigator,\u201d due out on March 10. Ms. Segarra\u2019s touchstones on the album range from Fania Records to Bowery   to the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, with an animating conviction that\u2019s summed up in this song\u2019s closing refrain: \u201cI\u2019ll keep fighting \u2018til the end. \u201d N. C. This charming song is many months old, but has finally received a vivid video, thanks to its inclusion on Kodie Shane\u2019s new EP, \u201cZero Gravity,\u201d her first major label release. Kodie Shane is a member of Lil Yachty\u2019s Sailing Team, and   in Daliesque fragments similar to the boss. \u201cSad\u201d is a duet between them, with Kodie Shane lamenting her romantic lot, followed by Lil Yachty coming in to offer succor, and more. The climactic scene in the video is both comic and sweet. They sing face to face in a therapist\u2019s office  \u2014   their voices digitized, their emotions very raw. J. C. The Cuban pianist David Virelles is a brilliant hybridist, but until recently he generally released music with acoustic dimensions, approachable from the vectors of postbop or  . \u201cAntenna\u201d  \u2014   recently released in digital form and as a   vinyl EP  \u2014   sounds like something else entirely, even as it carries on an inquiry that has always been at the center of Mr. Virelles\u2019s work. A track called \u201cRumbaku\u00e1\u201d has electronic textures,   splicing and versifying by the Cuban rapper Eti\u00e1n Brebaje Man. The EP is worth seeking out, and so is a performance by Mr. Virelles at Le Poisson Rouge on Friday evening, with partners like the guitarist Rafiq Bhatia and the drummer Marcus Gilmore. N.
