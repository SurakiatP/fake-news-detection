[Speaker Ryan said, \u201cWe\u2019re basically putting into law the Price plan as our replace plan. It\u2019s very similar to the bill that Tom Price has worked on for so many years, that many conservatives   last year. \u201d  Secretary Price served as the House Budget chairman in Congress and sponsored his bill every congressional term since the Affordable Care Act became law. Speaker Ryan explained that despite concerns about the political will to repeal Obamacare, Congress progresses toward repealing Obamacare. He said, \u201cWe\u2019re moving to this next right now in Congress. We\u2019re on track. We\u2019re on our schedule. Our plan was always this spring to take on the repeal and replace of Obamacare, so we haven\u2019t changed a thing. I notice there\u2019s a lot of white noise in the press on this, but we\u2019re as committed as ever before. \u201d The Empower Patients First Act mirrors many of the details of the Ryan plan leaked in a bill previously reported on last month. The bill provides refundable tax credits for health insurance coverage and health insurance accounts (HSA) contributions. The Department of Health and Human Services would provide state \u201cinnovation grants\u201d that would create   pools for people with   conditions. The OppCast interview provides the first official details of Obamacare\u2019s replacement plan. Congressional staffers denied Senator Rand Paul ( ) from viewing the Obamacare secret draft in the Capitol building. Paul submitted his bill to replace Obamacare. Senator Paul and Congressmen Mark Meadows ( ) and Jim Jordan ( ) pledged to oppose any legislation that does not fully repeal Obamacare. The Ryan plan does not fully repeal Obamacare. Congressman Mark Meadows told Breitbart News about his concerns about the Ryan plan. He explained, \u201cWe are concerned about a new federal plan that will only increase premiums and lead to higher prices. We are not going to fix health care by replacing Obamacare with another plan that won\u2019t work. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628541.499427}
