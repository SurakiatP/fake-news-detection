Hsinchu   High School in Hsinchu City held the parade, which focused on Adolf Hitler, as part of the school\u2019s anniversary celebrations on Friday. The parade also featured cardboard tanks. The students chose the theme, according to local news reports. Photographs of the event spread quickly online, creating a backlash, with the unofficial diplomatic missions of Israel and Germany issuing letters of protest. The episode resulted in the resignation of the school\u2019s principal, Cheng   this week. Mr. Cheng said that he took responsibility, adding that the primary issue was \u201cour education\u2019s problem,\u201d according to local news reports. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t necessarily a problem created by the children. \u201d Taiwanese textbooks, like those in other Asian countries, focus on fighting in Asia during World War II, resulting in lower awareness of events in Europe. In addition to the Israeli and German missions\u2019 responses, the Chabad Taipei Jewish Center also issued a statement expressing regret about \u201cthe use of Nazi imagery and logos by students in Taiwan, as it reopens historical wounds suffered by the Jewish people. \u201d Ross Feingold, chairman of the center, said that many people in Taiwan were unaware that there were more than 1, 000 Jews living among them, many of them   residents with businesses or investments on the island. \u201cCertainly it\u2019s not meant to be an act of \u201d Mr. Feingold said. \u201cHolocaust education is extremely limited here. \u201d The parade in Hsinchu is not the first incident in which Nazi references have offended Jews and other groups in Taiwan. In 1999, an advertisement for   DBK space heaters in Taiwan featured a smiling Hitler with the caption, \u201cDeclare war on the cold front!\u201d The next year, a restaurant with a concentration camp theme opened, closing weeks after it became a source of outrage. In 2001, the governing Democratic Progressive Party created a television advertisement contrasting Hitler with John F. Kennedy and other leaders, which the party modified after protests from the Israel Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei and others. Officials at the school, which is private but receives subsidies from Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of Education, have said they will show their students movies such as \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d to better educate them on the atrocities of the Holocaust. \u201cA   showing of a movie is not a sustainable program,\u201d Mr. Feingold said. \u201cWhat is more sustainable is reaching out to the Jewish community that lives here in Taiwan, many of whom have relatives who died in or survived the Holocaust. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561756.4482145}
