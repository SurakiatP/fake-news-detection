Fake images show a prominent female leader in a hangman\u2019s noose. A politician\u2019s aide decries violent crime with a Facebook photo of a girl\u2019s corpse  \u2014   an image that turns out to come from another country. Another day on social media for Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump? Think again. Those incidents took place in Indonesia and the Philippines, where social media\u2019s outsize place in politics is widely acknowledged, even as that role is coming under sharper criticism in the United States. Well before last week\u2019s American election threw Facebook\u2019s status as a   news source into the spotlight, leaders, advocacy groups and minorities worldwide have contended with an onslaught of online misinformation and abuse that has had   political repercussions. And for years, the social network did little to clamp down on the false news. Now Facebook, Google and others have begun to take steps to curb the trend, but some outside the United States say the move is too late. \u201cThey should have done this way earlier,\u201d said Richard Heydarian, a political analyst in the Philippines, one of Facebook\u2019s   markets. \u201cWe already saw the warning signs of this years ago. \u201d On Thursday, President Obama, speaking in Berlin and standing alongside Chancellor Angela Merkel, criticized Facebook and other social media for disseminating fake news. He became so impassioned that at one point he lost track of the question he was answering. \u201cIf everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made, then we won\u2019t know what to protect,\u201d Mr. Obama said. The impact of Facebook and other social media platforms on international elections is difficult to quantify. But Facebook\u2019s global reach  \u2014   roughly a quarter of the world\u2019s population now has an account  \u2014   is difficult to deny, political experts and academics say. Some governments are pushing back, sometimes with undemocratic consequences. Ms. Merkel has said she is considering plans to force social networks to make public how they rank news online. Some African countries have banned the use of Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter before elections. Indonesia\u2019s government has closed sites that it says promote fake news, though experts say some portals were also targeted for political reasons. Facebook said on Thursday that the social network was a place for people to stay informed and that what people saw in their news feed was overwhelmingly authentic. The Silicon Valley company previously denied that it failed to deal with misinformation and said it continues to monitor the social network so that it meets existing standards. \u201cI think the idea that fake news on Facebook, which is a very small amount of the content, influenced the election in any way  \u2014   I think is a pretty crazy idea,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, the company\u2019s chief executive, told a tech conference days after the American presidential election. \u201cVoters make decisions based on their lived experience. \u201d Facebook\u2019s power is often stronger overseas than it is in the United States. In many developing countries with populations new to both democracy and social media, experts said, fake stories can be more widely believed. And in some of these countries, Facebook even offers free smartphone data connections to basic public online services, some news sites and Facebook itself  \u2014   but limits access to broader sources that could help debunk fake news. One such place is the Philippines, where a spokesman for its populist president, Rodrigo Duterte, shared on Facebook an image of a corpse of a young girl believed to have been raped and killed by a drug dealer. Fact checkers later revealed that the photo had come from Brazil. Despite the debunking, proponents of Mr. Duterte\u2019s bloody crackdown on reported drug dealers and addicts still cite the image in his defense, according to political analysts. Tens of thousands of Philippine Facebook users also recently shared a story claiming that NASA had voted Mr. Duterte \u201cthe best president in the solar system. \u201d While many commenters on the Facebook post took it as a joke, some appeared to take it seriously. And an image of Leila de Lima, a local lawmaker and a critic of Mr. Duterte, depicted her facing a hangman\u2019s noose. \u201cFacebook hasn\u2019t led to empowerment of the average citizen, but empowerment of professional propagandists, fringe elements and conspiracy theorists,\u201d said Mr. Heydarian, the Philippines political analyst. \u201cVoices that were lurking in the shadows are now at the center of the public discourse. \u201d In Indonesia, where Facebook is so popular that some people confuse it with the broader internet, the service has considerable sway. When Joko Widodo, Indonesia\u2019s president, was running for office in 2014, he was accused through social media of being a Chinese Christian and a communist  \u2014   severe criticism in the deeply Islamic country. The Indonesian politician released his marriage certificate to prove he wasn\u2019t Chinese and made a pilgrimage to Mecca just before voting. \u201cThe fake news had a very big impact in our campaign,\u201d said Tubagus Ramadhan, who helped Mr. Widodo run his social media campaign during the election. The online misinformation has not been limited to elections. In Colombia, Facebook users widely shared a crudely altered photo of a pop singer, Juanes, wearing a   suggesting he opposed a peace deal with the country\u2019s largest rebel group. On Twitter, Juanes denied it. Colombia\u2019s voters narrowly rejected the deal in a referendum last month. While Facebook has won plaudits for allowing people in disaster zones to tell friends and families they are safe, it has also been a conduit for dangerous rumors in those situations. At the height of the Ebola outbreak in 2014, a false message widely distributed in Sierra Leone on Facebook and WhatsApp, which is owned by the social network, said bathing in hot water with salt would cure and prevent the spread of the virus. Even in   democracies like Germany, Spain and Italy, false news reports and hate speech on social media have whipped up   populist movements, which have often targeted the recent influx of Middle Eastern refugees, to garner wider electoral support. Now, many European politicians are questioning what role social media has had in deciding what voters can and cannot see. They also have forced social networks like Facebook, Twitter and Google to sign up for voluntary  \u2014   so far  \u2014   standards to police hate speech online. In Germany, Ms. Merkel\u2019s push to require American social network companies to publish how they rank news is intended to give voters greater control over what they read online. \u201cAlgorithms must be more transparent,\u201d Ms. Merkel has said, \u201cso that interested citizens are also aware of what actually happens with their own media behavior and that of others. \u201d Other politicians, often in more recently established democracies, are going a step further. In some African countries, including Chad and Uganda, officials cite uncorroborated security threats and fears that false results could be shared online as reasons for shutting down social media ahead of elections. Christian Echle, director of the   Africa media program at    a German political foundation, said such actions were   and that social media had played a role in helping voters  \u2014   many located far from urban centers  \u2014   to gain access to   information and interact with political candidates. But, he added, a growing amount of news shared through social media was either false or biased, making it difficult for people in these often fledgling democracies to know which news outlets to trust. \u201cThere\u2019s a big, big threat  \u2014   that social media will deepen existing gaps in these societies,\u201d said Mr. Echle, who is based in Johannesburg. \u201cPeople are still learning how to use social media, so many can easily fall for hoaxes. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564312.819948}
