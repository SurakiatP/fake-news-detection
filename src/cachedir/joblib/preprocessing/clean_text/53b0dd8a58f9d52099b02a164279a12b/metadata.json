[In an interview with Extra, the Boss Baby actor said that he would enter politics if only to offer \u201csomething different\u201d to the American people.  \u201cI would love to run for office because I think people need something different,\u201d Baldwin said, adding, \u201cI think that all the people that are on deck in 2020, none of them are going to win. \u201d \u201cNone of those people are going to beat [Trump],\u201d the    star continued. \u201cYou think things are bad now I tell you when things are going to be worse, if he wins again. \u201d To be clear, Baldwin, who has spent months playing Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live, ruled out adding himself to the ballet: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do that. \u201d Asked if he is worried that his new memoir, titled Nevertheless, will caused controversy, Baldwin said \u201cI\u2019m married, we have a wonderful family, that\u2019s all I care about. \u201d Earlier this week, Baldwin appeared on Good Morning America to promote his new book, during which he opened up about a 2007 voicemail to his     daughter Ireland. \u201cIt\u2019s thrown in your face every day,\u201d Baldwin said of the voicemail, which was leaked to the media, and caught the actor calling his daughter a \u201crude, thoughtless little pig. \u201d \u201cThere are people who admonish me, or attack me, and use that as a constant spearhead to do that,\u201d Baldwin explained. \u201cIt\u2019s a scab that never heals because it\u2019s been picked at all the time by so many people. I think my daughter, that\u2019s hurt her in a permanent way. \u201d On Tuesday, producer Dana Brunetti  \u2014   who worked with Baldwin on the 2006 independent film Mini\u2019s First Time  \u2014   slammed the actor\u2019s claim in his biography that he did not know he was filming sex scenes with an underage Nikki Reed.
