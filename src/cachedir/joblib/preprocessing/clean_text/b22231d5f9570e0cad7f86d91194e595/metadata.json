If you win, will this be your first   job? I\u2019ve done volunteer work, but I\u2019ve never been paid for it. So, yes, it will be my first. There was no salary for the presidency of the Screen Actors Guild. Famously, the SAG presidency was the thing on Ronald Reagan\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that supporters pointed to when he first got into politics. Does it actually prepare you for political office? Like Washington, SAG is a   system there\u2019s a liberal and a conservative party. The names change, but when I was there, my party was called the Restore Respect Party, and my opposition was the Membership First Party. I reached across the aisle to a few people from my opponents\u2019 party who I thought had really terrific ideas. Are there any other    that you look at and see as role models? Because I am a woman doing this, I don\u2019t know that there is anyone else out there like me. Have you heard the expression that \u201cWashington is Hollywood for ugly people\u201d? What a horrible thing to say. It\u2019s far from the worst thing that\u2019s been said about D. C. and I think there\u2019s some truth to it: Both are full of very ambitious people who network all the time and who sometimes forget the reason they came in the first place. So, what is Hollywood the Washington for? Well, the best way I can liken the two is the Republican debates, which are the single greatest reality program on television today. How does it feel to be an entertainer running in this cycle, which has been unprecedented in its levels of theatricality? There is no theatricality going down here in the Eighth District of Michigan. You used to have a blog, and one post goes into great detail about your decision to do breast augmentation, and then your decision to have the implants removed. Do you think that your habit of being so candid is an asset as a politician, or do you think you\u2019ll need to be a little more disciplined? Well, I\u2019m not a traditional politician. I was not raised to be a politician. I am a citizen. I think leaders should be more candid, frankly, and less political. Unlike most people, you had a profession as a child. Did you ever go through a period in your youth when you thought about what you were going to be when you grow up? I actually wanted to be a neurosurgeon specializing in pediatric oncology. My mother practically told me, \u201cYou know that what you\u2019re doing is a career, right?\u201d I said, \u201cIs it, really?\u201d I\u2019ve stayed in entertainment in various forms, and it\u2019s extraordinary that all those decisions led here  \u2014   I never thought I would be running for office. If you could wave a magic wand and pass any bill through Congress, what would it be? The first thing I would do is   the Paycheck Fairness Act. In your 2009 memoirs, you wrote that you were considering a second career as a nurse. And on your blog, you\u2019ve said you\u2019re bad at  . Why should voters think that running for office is more than just a whim for you? Because this campaign is my primary focus. I have the ability to focus when need be. You\u2019re in recovery  \u2014   and in recovery, it\u2019s highly recommended that you develop a spiritual practice. What does yours look like? I have absolute belief in a higher power. I believe that I can do nothing without a community of people around me. How do these beliefs inform your politics? I have faith in people. I have a faith that love will win out. But if you look at the headlines, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a lot of love in politics these days. I\u2019m sorry. That doesn\u2019t feel like a question.'"}, "time": 1742562088.6215284}
