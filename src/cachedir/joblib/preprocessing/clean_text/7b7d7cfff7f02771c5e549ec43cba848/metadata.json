The story of the boy, Killian Gonzalez, who endured one of the worst traumatic injuries that can affect small children in car crashes but escaped with his life through the actions of a good Samaritan, unfolded on State Highway 51, a   road slicked by a hailstorm at the time. Killian\u2019s mother, Brandy Gonzalez, said she was driving home to Nevada after attending a party in Idaho to celebrate the boy\u2019s birthday when her car skidded and went into a lane of oncoming traffic, colliding with another vehicle. Pinned in the wreckage and with broken bones, she tried to turn to reach her son, who was strapped into a   car seat in the back. \u201cI was like: I have to get to my baby. I looked back and he is just hunched over. He is not crying he is not awake. \u201d \u201cI kept talking to him and trying to get him to wake up,\u201d she said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. Then a sound from the boy: a whimper, and the word \u201cMomma. \u201d Killian\u2019s skull was separated from his spine, and he also had a ruptured spleen and broken ribs and arms, a local television station, KBOI, reported from the hospital. Ms. Gonzalez suffered broken arms and legs. The other driver been pinned but was O. K. she said. The accident happened in Owyhee County, which is in the southwestern corner of Idaho on the border with Nevada, at 3:14 p. m. on May 22, Chief Deputy Lynn Bowman, of the county Sheriff\u2019s Department, said in a telephone interview. Leah Woodward and her husband, Joel Woodward, an officer with the  Police Department in Nampa, Idaho, were driving home with their two children from a camping trip when they crested a hill and came upon the accident. Ms. Woodward said she saw a man in the driver\u2019s seat of one vehicle, bloody and disoriented. In the other vehicle, she saw Ms. Gonzalez, her arm clearly shattered, unable to unlock her car doors to help the Woodwards reach her. In the back, Killian was not moving, but he was screaming. \u201cAs a mom, that just goes right to your heart,\u201d Ms. Woodward said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. \u201cMy immediate instinct was: \u2018You have to help that little guy.\u2019 \u201d To reach Killian, her husband broke a window of the Gonzalez vehicle, then squeezed through, cutting himself on the glass. He then told his wife to hold the child upright, keeping his head steady, until help came. \u201cMy first instinct would have been to cradle the little guy, but clearly that would have been the wrong choice,\u201d Ms. Woodward said. The boy\u2019s broken arm was backward, so they draped it against his side and covered him with a blanket. Ms. Woodward said a pinkish   substance was splattered on the seat, the boy and her. Later, her sister, a nurse, told her that might have been spinal fluid. \u201cI had my hands kind of, like, thumbs by his ears and hands wrapped behind his neck holding it still,\u201d she said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t fight, he was not moving every now and then he would come to. \u201d As she held his head for about 30 minutes, she said, she talked to the boy. Asking Ms. Gonzalez details about her son, Ms. Woodward tried to keep his attention, chatting to him about his strawberry birthday cake and toy dinosaur, trying to fight the boy\u2019s impulse to drift off. His eyes rolled around in his head, or flashed in fear, she recalled. At one point, she said, he spoke: \u201cI don\u2019t hurt anymore. I am all done. \u201d When emergency medics arrived, she continued holding his head as they worked around her, finally fixing him with a collar and getting him into an ambulance. \u201cI am just glad I did not know his injuries at the time,\u201d she said. Killian, his mother and the other driver were flown by air ambulance to hospitals, Chief Deputy Bowman said. Leslie Dorn, Killian\u2019s grandmother, stayed with the boy in the hospital while Ms. Gonzalez underwent treatment for her injuries. She said doctors told her four of the six ligaments connecting the boy\u2019s skull and spine were stretched by an inch from the impact, but then sprang back to leave Killian about   of an inch taller than he was before the accident. Officials from the hospital, St. Luke\u2019s Boise, where Killian was treated, declined to comment. A   page for the boy said that he had \u201ca fracture at the base of his skull where the brain stem connects to the spinal cord. \u201d Clinical, or internal, decapitation is a colloquial term for an injury known to surgeons as   dislocation. It happens when the ligaments, muscles and joints that connect the base of the skull to the top of the spine are damaged. \u201cSo the term \u2018decapitation\u2019 in the true sense of cutting someone\u2019s head off is a bit extreme,\u201d said Dr. Nicholas Theodore, the director of spinal surgery at the Barrow Neurological Institute, who has operated on more than 60 patients with the injury. He has used titanium rods, wires or screws to reattach the base of the skull to the spine. Dr. Theodore said the injury was almost always associated with   accidents in which the head is pulled away from the spine, and it occurs more often with children than adults because their neck musculature is still undeveloped and weak. \u201cEspecially younger patients, the head is like a bowling ball on a stick,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir head sort of bobbles. \u201d Dr. Theodore, who treated a    boy with the injury in 2010, did not comment on Killian\u2019s case but said: \u201cYou don\u2019t ever want to move an injury patient unless a car is on fire. Immobilizing a child is exactly what you want to do. \u201d On Tuesday, Killian, who had been discharged from the hospital over the weekend, was walking unassisted at home, fitted with a hard collar to support his head and neck, Ms. Gonzalez said. \u201cHe can take a few steps, but his equilibrium is still off,\u201d she said. He does not talk about the accident.'"}, "time": 1742562921.5965319}
