{"duration": 0.20903491973876953, "input_args": {"text": "'WASHINGTON  \u2014   President Trump\u2019s point man on   negotiations is a longtime Trump Organization lawyer with no government or diplomatic experience. His liaison to   leaders is a former   villain with a penchant for r\u00e9sum\u00e9 inflation. And his Oval Office gatekeeper is a   former New York City cop best known for smacking a protester on the head. Every president sweeps into office with a coterie of friends and   who sometimes have minimal experience in the arcana of the federal government. But few have arrived with a contingent more colorful and controversial than that of Mr. Trump, whose White House is peppered with assistants and advisers whose principal qualification is their long friendship with Mr. Trump and his family. There is Jason Greenblatt, the former Trump Organization lawyer, whose portfolio now includes peace in the West Bank, international trade deals and relations with Cuba. Omarosa Manigault, whose star turn on \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d propelled the show\u2019s breakout first season, is now among about two dozen aides with the rank of assistant to the president  \u2014   and one of the few with   privileges for the Oval Office. Most other staff members must go through Keith Schiller, who rose from   security guard at the Trump Organization to its director of security. Mr. Schiller is now the director of Oval Office operations, controlling physical access to a president whose whims and frustrations routinely send aides throughout the building scurrying to deflect, defend and justify. The influence of longtime Trump friends and associates  \u2014   some of them with vague portfolios  \u2014   comes as a leadership void has been created by the Trump administration\u2019s slow pace in filling top jobs in many agencies. It has also added to the confusion of a West Wing already legendary for its power struggles, while bewildering Washington policy hands. \u201cTitles do matter,\u201d said Paul C. Light, a presidential scholar at New York University. \u201cYou don\u2019t say: \u2018You are my buddy you are my friend you were with me on my television show. I\u2019m going to give you a really great title.\u2019 These are not things to be handed out like candy. \u201d To help him wrangle Silicon Valley chief executives and modernize United States government technology systems, Mr. Trump has hired Reed Cordish, the scion of a Baltimore real estate dynasty who is married to a close college friend of Ivanka Trump, who set them up. In a statement, Mr. Cordish said his real estate experience had taught him how to successfully meld public and private interests. The president also recently hired Andrew Giuliani, the son of former New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and a Trump family friend, to work in the White House Office of Public Liaison and Intergovernmental Affairs. Mr. Giuliani, 31, who made headlines after he sued Duke University for kicking him off the college golf team, previously worked in sales and marketing at a small suburban New York financial firm. Personal relationships with the president often bestow a power exceeding official West Wing job titles. Valerie Jarrett, a businesswoman, former city official in Chicago and longtime friend of the Obamas, was renowned for her unmatched access to President Barack Obama and reach into policy matters far beyond her official portfolio. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a White House press spokeswoman, said Mr. Trump had recruited highly skilled advisers with refreshingly different backgrounds. \u201cEven though some of the staff doesn\u2019t have government experience it doesn\u2019t mean they are amateurs,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cPresident Trump has promised to change Washington and you can\u2019t do that by putting Washington bureaucrats in charge of everything. \u201d If Mr. Trump appears more eager than past presidents to bring in longtime associates with limited Washington experience, friends said, it stems partly from his background of four decades at the helm of a closely held family business, with no experience in public service. He has had to assemble a White House team largely from scratch, tapping a party apparatus he believed had tried to deny him the nomination and a Republican policy elite that had largely opposed him. The bulk of his senior White House aides were unknown to him until two years ago. \u201dTrump doesn\u2019t have a longtime staff of political aides these loyalists fill that vacuum,\u201d said Christopher Ruddy, a friend and chief executive of Newsmax Media, the conservative news site. \u201cHe is figuring out who he can depend on. \u201d Mr. Schiller, 58, a    former narcotics detective, has protected Mr. Trump for 18 years. The head of a Praetorian Guard of private security detectives, Mr. Schiller occupied a Trump Tower office on the same floor as his boss and learned, he said, to anticipate his wishes. A fierce protector of Mr. Trump\u2019s image and interests, he physically removed a reporter from a 2015 news conference on the campaign trail after he repeatedly questioned Mr. Trump without being called on. Five activists later sued Mr. Schiller, the Trump Organization and other Trump security guards, claiming they had been assaulted during a protest outside Trump Tower in September 2015. Mr. Schiller has acknowledged hitting one man but said the man attacked him first. No longer responsible for Mr. Trump\u2019s physical safety, he is now a combination gatekeeper, valet and security blanket  \u2014   a familiar face for a president who detests solitude and whose wife and youngest son have remained at Trump Tower. But Mr. Schiller has not entirely shed his role as Mr. Trump\u2019s enforcer. During a briefing on health care legislation on Friday, he shouted at reporters to clear out of the Roosevelt Room after they tried to question Mr. Trump about continuing controversies. Mr. Greenblatt\u2019s ties to Mr. Trump have translated into more striking levels of power and prestige. A lawyer who helped Mr. Trump negotiate business deals for two decades, Mr. Greenblatt rose to become the Trump Organization\u2019s chief legal officer and executive vice president. Now, as special representative for international negotiations for the White House, Mr. Greenblatt, 49, is charged with negotiating trade agreements and overseeing the   conflict and United   relations. Mr. Trump has called him \u201cbrilliant. \u201d But experts say it is hard to imagine how anyone, no matter how intelligent, could handle three such sensitive and complex assignments without previous experience. \u201cOur sense is that the Trump White House views the foreign policy establishment as pretty feckless. They seem to think that applying a business approach can work better,\u201d said Martin S. Indyk, the executive vice president of the Brookings Institution, who was President Obama\u2019s special envoy to the Middle East. \u201cNot to have experience or knowledge of the issues in dispute, nor any relationship with the Palestinians, will be a challenge,\u201d he said. In announcing his appointment, Mr. Trump said Mr. Greenblatt\u2019s success in negotiating complex transactions and building consensus made him the ideal roving global negotiator. Mr. Greenblatt has told reporters that after so many years at Mr. Trump\u2019s side, \u201cI know how he thinks I know how to get his bidding done. \u201d In a brief telephone interview, Mr. Greenblatt suggested calling back later when \u201cI\u2019ll have something to actually say that\u2019s meaningful. \u201d Through the press office, he addressed the trade aspect of his portfolio, saying that working with Mr. Trump taught him how government can impede job creation. Still, C. Fred Bergsten, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a member of the president\u2019s Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations, said he had never known a White House official \u201coutside of the trade policy network who has been assigned negotiation of trade issues. \u201d By law, the Office of the United States Trade Representative is charged with negotiating trade deals. Various   secretaries also weigh in on policy. \u201cSo what would that leave for this guy?\u201d Mr. Bergsten asked. \u201cIt\u2019s very mysterious. \u201d A sign of Mr. Greenblatt\u2019s expansive role came last month, not long after he traveled to Capitol Hill with Peter Navarro  \u2014   a   economist who is head of Mr. Trump\u2019s newly created National Trade Council  \u2014   to discuss trade policy with staff aides of the Senate Finance Committee. Mr. Greenblatt missed a   session with senators because Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel was visiting the White House that day. \u201cHe\u2019s got to negotiate Middle East peace,\u201d Mr. Navarro quipped to the senators, according to a person who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cSo he can\u2019t be here today. \u201d Although Mr. Greenblatt has not been given the title of special envoy to the Middle East, he appears to be acting in that role too. Visiting the region this week, he met Mr. Netanyahu in Israel on Monday and is scheduled to meet the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas. A State Department spokesman said Monday that a senior National Security Council official was accompanying Mr. Greenblatt, but was unsure whether a State Department official had been included. Mr. Greenblatt appears more independent of the State Department than at least some previous envoys he has told others he reports not to Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, but to the president\u2019s    Jared Kushner, 36, one of the most senior White House advisers. And where past envoys were foreign policy specialists, Mr. Greenblatt told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency in April that his main sources of information were daily email alerts, material supplied by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and a weekly Jewish radio program. \u201cThere\u2019s just a tremendous amount of literature out there, emails and all that, so I read all of those as often as I can,\u201d he said then. Still, Mr. Greenblatt seemed at that point somewhat taken aback that Mr. Trump had identified him to the news agency as his principal adviser on Israel, telling reporters that Mr. Greenblatt was so passionate that \u201cwhen he goes on vacation, he goes to Israel. \u201d \u201cI knew that he was relying on me for certain aspects of Israel, but I didn\u2019t know I was his top adviser,\u201d he said. Ms. Manigault, 43, has no policy experience, a spotty history in her previous federal positions and a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that has cast her  \u2014   inaccurately  \u2014   as a university professor and a former top aide to Vice President Al Gore. Yet, to the consternation of the president\u2019s chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and others, Mr. Trump has given her the same title of presidential assistant as Mr. Priebus and other senior aides  \u2014   and regularly includes her in   strategy sessions on the budget and other matters. She said in a January interview in Variety that Mr. Trump \u201creally wanted me to have the freedom to work on many different things. \u201d In a statement from the White House press office, Ms. Manigault said that \u201cwhile some people try to tear me down,\u201d she was focused on giving women, minorities and other groups a voice in the White House. Nominally, Ms. Manigault directs the office of communications in the White House\u2019s public liaison office, a midlevel post. She is also a bridge to   groups, including the heads of more than 60 historically black colleges and universities who met with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office last month. She also joined a State Department delegation to the inauguration of Haiti\u2019s president, Jovenel Mo\u00efse. She said Mr. Mo\u00efse had invited her because of her previous hurricane relief work in the country. \u201cShe is the     in the White House, and she has the ear of the president,\u201d said Paris Dennard, a White House director of   outreach under President George W. Bush. \u201cThat is a good thing. \u201d During the presidential campaign, Ms. Manigault cast herself as an insider, saying Mr. Trump has called her \u201chis Valerie Jarrett. \u201d In an interview published last June in Essence magazine, she said, \u201cI\u2019m the person who pulls him back when he goes too far. \u201d In her White House post, she has already had a few   reminiscent of her     role on \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d including a much publicized confrontation with a veteran White House reporter. (Mr. Trump also sponsored a   dating show called \u201cThe Ultimate Merger\u201d in which she starred.) Ms. Manigault has told others that she earned her way to a White House position. She grew up on welfare in a housing project in Youngstown, Ohio, and lost her father to violence at age 7, but went on to earn a college degree and, at age 24, a job in the office of Vice President Al Gore. But while her ascent is impressive, it is not quite as she has described it. On a 2005 r\u00e9sum\u00e9 provided by a former employer, she described herself as Mr. Gore\u2019s \u201csenior scheduling and advance coordinator\u201d overseeing all aspects of his schedule. She continues to maintain that description is accurate and that she succeeded at the job. But numerous former staff members in that office said that she was pushed out of an   $   job replying to invitations to Mr. Gore after 13 months, leaving a pile of unanswered correspondence under her desk. \u201cShe was the worst hire we ever made,\u201d said Mary Margaret Overbey, Mr. Gore\u2019s former office administrator. Ms. Manigault transferred to a job as deputy associate director of presidential personnel, then eight months later moved to the Commerce Department. In her statement, she said she performed well in that job. But Cheryl Shavers, then the agency\u2019s under secretary for technology administration, disagreed, saying Ms. Manigault \u201cwas unqualified and disruptive,\u201d so \u201cI had her removed. \u201d On her official website and elsewhere,  Ms. Manigault also has identified herself as a professor at Howard University in Washington. But Anthony D. Owens, a university spokesman, said she actually was a \u201cfacilitator and presenter. \u201d A letter from the university that Ms. Manigault provided states that she was an instructor, a temporary position. Ms. Manigault also maintains that the only requirement left for her to complete a doctorate at Howard is to defend her dissertation. But Carolyn M. Byerly, chairwoman of the university\u2019s communications department, said that according to the university\u2019s rules, the   period for her to do that expired more than a decade ago. Ms. Manigault tweeted her support for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2014, but when Mr. Trump decided to run for president she joined his campaign and defended him vigorously. At an   victory party in November, she gave a television interview during which she warned that Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign was keeping an \u201cenemies\u201d list. Her \u201cApprentice\u201d  pugnacity notwithstanding, Mr. Trump insists there is a side of her that she keeps well hidden. \u201cOmarosa\u2019s actually a very nice person,\u201d he joked at a Roosevelt Room breakfast that she helped organize last month to celebrate Black History Month. \u201cNobody knows that. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562260.3229542}
