[The workshop, which will teach students about the role that white privilege supposedly plays in American society, will be led by white history professor Randall Jimerson.  In an email interview with The College Fix, Jimerson explained his motivations for setting up the workshop, citing a desire to reduce the impact of \u201cwhite privilege. \u201d \u201cI think the harmful effects of \u2018white privilege\u2019 are that it can reflect an insensitivity to the subtle effects of both racism and lack of awareness of the differences between how people of color and people called \u2018white\u2019 are treated in everyday life,\u201d Jimerson wrote. \u201cNot being aware that other people face daily, often subtle, discrimination can make white people insensitive to these debilitating effects. \u201d \u201cMost people of color are aware of the existence of \u2018white privilege,\u2019 whether or not they have applied this term to the disparity between their experiences and those of white people,\u201d he added. \u201cThus, I assume that the main focus will be on helping white participants to understand, explore, and accept (or reject) the concepts embedded in this phrase. \u201d Jimerson says that he hopes the workshop will help to reduce the impact of \u201cwhite privilege\u201d in daily interactions and increase \u201cwhite consciousness\u201d of the realities for minorities living in the United States. When asked about the racial progress that has taken place in the United States since the 1960s, Jimerson suggested that there is much left to be done. He argued that because he is a white male, it would be unfair for him to speak on behalf of those afflicted by racism. Although I think that the United States has made progress in some aspects of race relations  \u2014   such as overt or legal segregation  \u2014   recent evidence suggest we have a long way to go. These forms of evidence range from the racist attacks on former President Barack Obama, to documented incidents of excessive police violence towards people of color, to the increase of white supremacist organizations, and the only slightly veiled racism of many members of the Trump administration. These developments are seriously troubling for anyone who values concepts of fairness, equality, and social justice.
