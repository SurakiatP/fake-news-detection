The people are unaware. They\u2019re not educated to realize that they have power. The system is so geared that everyone believes the government will fix everything. We are the government .\u201d\u2014John Lennon How do you balance the scales of justice at a time when Americans are being tasered, tear-gassed, pepper-sprayed, hit with batons, shot with rubber bullets and real bullets, blasted with sound cannons, detained in cages and kennels , sicced by police dogs, arrested and jailed for challenging the government\u2019s excesses, abuses and power-grabs? Politics won\u2019t fix a system that is broken beyond repair. No matter who sits in the White House, the shadow government will continue to call the shots behind the scenes. Relying on the courts to restore justice seems futile. Indeed, with every ruling handed down, it becomes more apparent that we live in an age of hollow justice, with government courts, largely lacking in vision and scope, rendering narrow rulings focused on the letter of the law. This is true at all levels of the judiciary, but especially so in the highest court of the land, the US Supreme Court, which is seemingly more concerned with establishing order and protecting government agents than with upholding the rights enshrined in the Constitution. Even so, justice matters. It matters whether you\u2019re a rancher protesting a federal land-grab by the Bureau of Land Management, a Native American protesting an oil pipeline that will endanger sacred sites and pollute water supplies, or an African-American taking to the streets to protest yet another police shooting of an unarmed citizen. Unfortunately, protests and populist movements haven\u2019t done much to push back against an authoritarian regime that is deaf to our cries, dumb to our troubles, blind to our needs, and accountable to no one. It doesn\u2019t matter who the activists are (environmentalists, peaceniks, Native Americans, Black Lives Matter, Occupy, or the Bundys and their followers) or what the source of the discontent is (endless wars abroad, police shootings, contaminated drinking water, government land-grabs), the government\u2019s modus operandi has remained the same: shut down the protests using all means available, prosecute First Amendment activities to the fullest extent of the law, and discourage any future civil uprisings by criminalizing expressive activities, labeling dissidents as extremists or terrorists, and conducting widespread surveillance on the general populace in order to put down any whispers of resistance before it can take root. Thus, if there is any means left to us for thwarting the government in its relentless march towards outright dictatorship, it may rest with the power of juries and local governments to invalidate governmental laws, tactics and policies that are illegitimate, egregious or blatantly unconstitutional. Just recently, in fact, an Oregon jury rejected the government\u2019s attempts to prosecute seven activists who staged a six-week, armed takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. In finding the defendants not guilty\u2014of conspiracy to impede federal officers, of possession of firearms in a federal facility, and of stealing a government-owned truck\u2014the jury sent its own message to the government and those following the case: justice matters. Many other equally sincere activists with eloquent lawyers and ardent supporters have gone to jail for lesser offenses than those committed at the Malheur Refuge, so what made the difference here? The jury made all the difference. These seven Oregon protesters were found not guilty because a jury of their peers recognized the sincerity of their convictions, sympathized with the complaints against an overreaching government, and balanced the scales of justice using the only tools available to them: common sense, compassion and the power of the jury box. Jury nullification works. As law professor Ilya Somin explains, jury nullification is the practice by which a jury refuses to convict someone accused of a crime if they believe the \u201c law in question is unjust or the punishment is excessive .\u201d According to former federal prosecutor Paul Butler, the doctrine of jury nullification is \u201cpremised on the idea that ordinary citizens, not government officials, should have the final say as to whether a person should be punished.\u201d Imagine that: a world where the citizenry\u2014not the government or its corporate controllers\u2014actually calls the shots and determines what is just. \u201cWe the people\u201d can and should be determining what laws are just, what activities are criminal and who can be jailed for what crimes. This is where the power of jury nullification is so critical: to reject inane laws and extreme sentences and counteract the edicts of a profit-driven governmental elite that sees nothing wrong with jailing someone for a lifetime for a relatively insignificant crime. Jury nullification is a powerful reminder that, as the Constitution tells us, \u201cwe the people\u201d are the government. For too long we\u2019ve allowed our so-called \u201crepresentatives\u201d to call the shots. Now it\u2019s time to restore the citizenry to their rightful place in the republic: as the masters, not the servants. Nullification is one way of doing so.Various cities and states have been using this historic doctrine with mixed results on issues as wide ranging as gun control and healthcare to \u201c claim freedom from federal laws they find onerous or wrongheaded .\u201d Where nullification can be particularly powerful, however, is in the hands of the juror. The reality with which we must contend is that justice in America is reserved for those who can afford to buy their way out of jail. For the rest of us who are dependent on the \u201cfairness\u201d of the system, there exists a multitude of ways in which justice can and does go wrong every day. Police misconduct. Prosecutorial misconduct. Judicial bias. Inadequate defense. Prosecutors who care more about winning a case than seeking justice. Judges who care more about what is legal than what is just. Jurors who know nothing of the law and are left to deliberate in the dark about life-and-death decisions. And an overwhelming body of laws, statutes and ordinances that render the average American a criminal, no matter how law-abiding they might think themselves. If you\u2019re to have any hope of remaining free\u2014and I use that word loosely\u2014your best bet remains in your fellow citizens. Your fellow citizens may not know what the Constitution says and they may not know what the laws are, but if you\u2019re lucky, those who serve on a jury will have a conscience that speaks louder than the legalistic tones of the prosecutors and the judges and reminds them that justice and fairness go hand in hand. That\u2019s ultimately what jury nullification is all about: restoring a sense of fairness to our system of justice. It\u2019s the best protection for \u201cwe the people\u201d against the oppression and tyranny of the government, and God knows, we can use all the protection we can get. It\u2019s also a powerful way to remind the government\u2014all of those bureaucrats who have appointed themselves judge, jury and jailer over all that we are, have and do\u2014that we\u2019re the ones who set the rules. So how do you not only push back against the police state\u2019s bureaucracy, corruption and cruelty but also launch a counterrevolution aimed at reclaiming control over the government using nonviolent means? You start by changing the rules and engaging in some (nonviolent) guerilla tactics. Employ militant nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience , which Martin Luther King Jr. used to great effect through the use of sit-ins, boycotts and marches. Take part in grassroots activism, which takes a trickle-up approach to governmental reform by implementing change at the local level (in other words, think nationally, but act locally). And then, as I explain in more detail in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People , nullify everything. Nullify the court cases. Nullify the laws. Nullify everything the government does that is illegitimate, egregious or blatantly unconstitutional. Reprinted with permission from the Rutherford Institute . Related'"}, "time": 1742628566.8336966}
