When pressed as to whether he was serious, Mr. Johnson indicated that he really was not aware of the city, which has been widely covered during the years that Syria has been engulfed in civil war. After Mike Barnicle, an MSNBC commentator who is often part of the \u201cMorning Joe\u201d program panel, explained that Aleppo was the center of Syria\u2019s refugee crisis, Mr. Johnson struggled to recover. \u201cO. K. got it,\u201d he said, explaining that he thinks that the United States must partner with Russia to diplomatically improve the situation there. \u201cWith regard to Syria, I do think that it\u2019s a mess. \u201d The stumble could be a serious blow to Mr. Johnson\u2019s campaign, just as he is making a final push to improve his standing in the polls. His support needs to reach 15 percent in a series of major national polls to be included in the presidential debates. Mr. Johnson\u2019s support has been hovering around 10 percent. He and his running mate, former Gov. Bill Weld of Massachusetts, have been aggressively making the case that they represent a viable alternative for voters who are not happy with the major party nominees, Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump. Mr. Johnson and Mr. Weld are both former   Republican governors who are socially liberal and fiscally conservative. While Libertarians are very   oriented, they are often criticized for being isolationist and lacking interest in foreign policy. Some leading Republicans who oppose Mr. Trump have said openly that they are giving the Libertarian ticket a serious look. On Wednesday night, Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, publicly called for Mr. Johnson and Mr. Weld to be included in the presidential debates. The stumble could derail such hopes and it was widely mocked on social media. On Twitter the question \u201cWhat is Aleppo?\u201d was trending, with many critics arguing that Mr. Johnson had disqualified himself from the presidency. Some even attributed the flub to Mr. Johnson\u2019s acknowledged use of marijuana. He is a proponent of legalizing the drug and he was previously the chief executive of a business that marketed and sold recreational marijuana products. Even Hillary Clinton, Mr. Johnson\u2019s Democratic opponent, had a laugh at his expense on Thursday. Asked about the Libertarian candidate\u2019s lack of knowledge about Aleppo during a news conference, she joked, \u201cYou can look on the map and find Aleppo. \u201d Thursday was not the first time that Mr. Johnson has faced such a situation. After speaking at a Politico convention in June, he was being directed to a room that was named after Harriet Tubman, the former slave and abolitionist. According to a report in The New Yorker, Mr. Johnson asked, \u201cWho\u2019s Harriet Tubman?\u201d Mr. Johnson expressed disappointment about the Aleppo lapse in a brief   interview that was broadcast on MSNBC and canceled some of his other scheduled interviews that had been planned for later in the day. \u201cI\u2019m incredibly frustrated with myself,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cI have to get smarter and that\u2019s just part of the process. \u201d He also released a statement, explaining that he is \u201chuman\u201d and that as president he would surround himself with experts and receive daily security briefings to fill any gaps in his knowledge. As for the impact the matter would have on his presidential prospects, Mr. Johnson said that would be up to the voters to decide. In a separate interview on ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View\u201d program, Mr. Johnson said that he was just trying to be as forthright about the situation as possible and made no excuses. \u201cFor those who believe this is a disqualifier, so be it,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742562407.643189}
