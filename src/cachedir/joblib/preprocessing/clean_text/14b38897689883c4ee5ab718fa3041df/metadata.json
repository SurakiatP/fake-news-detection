I\u2019ll be spending a lot of today with Kim Severson, our national food correspondent, up from Atlanta to help us welcome guests to our Food for Tomorrow conference, which starts tomorrow in Pocantico Hills, N. Y. at the Stone Barns Center for Food  Agriculture. It would be great if we were cooking, but we\u2019ll be in a car, talk, talk, talking, and when we need gas, we\u2019ll stop, and Kim will scout for pork rinds, because you never know: There may be a better kind than Golden Flake. I hope you\u2019ll be cooking. (Not in the mood? Head on over to Facebook and watch our cool little video about making a ricotta tart. See if you don\u2019t want to make that baby tonight or later this week.) If I were cooking, I\u2019d be pleased this evening to serve Pierre Franey\u2019s great old recipe for chicken breasts with lemon alongside some plain rice and a platter of green beans with shallots. It makes for a relatively fast meal, and it should leave you time to clean up ahead of the first   debate of this election season. (Alternatively, you can roast up some loaded nachos and eat them while watching, drinking beer and taking a shot of whiskey every time Mrs. Clinton says \u201cbreaking down barriers\u201d and each time Mr. Trump mentions \u201cthe wall. \u201d) I\u2019d be making plans for the rest of the week, too. I\u2019m excited to try my hand at David Tanis\u2019s recipe for lamb steaks with Lebanese spices. I\u2019d like to serve Florence Fabricant\u2019s recipe for broccoli rabe made  . I want to make Nigella Lawson\u2019s recipe for salmon in a ginger and lemongrass broth. It\u2019s getting to the time of year when I want to eat David\u2019s recipe for pork chops with apples and cider. And who doesn\u2019t want, as fall begins to cool off our evenings a little, to settle into a dinner of Jamie Oliver\u2019s recipe for eggplant Parmesan? The Food for Tomorrow conference runs through Wednesday, so perhaps I\u2019ll get to one of those toward the end of the week. If you beat me to the punch, take a photograph of what you cook and post it to social media, where we monitor the hashtag #NYTCooking on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest. We\u2019ve got a growing community of home cooks going. Let\u2019s share our work! You can find many more recipes on Cooking. Search through our collections and see if you can\u2019t find something delicious to cook. Then cook it! You can rate your results on a scale of one to five stars, and, if you have a good substitution or hack to suggest, you can post a note on the recipe. And, as always, I\u2019ll ask you to reach out to us for help if you need it. There are kind and careful people standing by at cookingcare@nytimes. com. Now, have you read this piece in our Sunday Review arguing that industrial farms are good for the environment? Discuss.'"}, "time": 1742563138.8463488}
