In the words of Donald Trump, our country is a disaster.\u201d Once again echoing the pronouncements of president-elect Trump, Leidecker noted that we sadly won\u2019t be able to rely on Washington to change anything, as our political system is largely run by self-serving, power-hungry factionalists who don\u2019t have the best interests of common Americans at heart.
