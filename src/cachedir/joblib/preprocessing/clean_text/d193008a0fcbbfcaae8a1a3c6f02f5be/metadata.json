Soros is already one of the most reviled people on Earth, and everything he does is absolutely emblematic of The International Jew. He is the Jew\u2019s Jew. The Jew to whom other Jews aspire to be. \\nNo amount of sunlight on Soros is too much. Whether the person shedding said light is Jew-wise or not. Every time he and other major players in World Jewry are exposed more people sudd3nly see the pattern. And as we all know, once you\u2019ve seen (((the pattern))), it is near impossible to ever ignore it again. \\nAzzy Q. How much more Jewy can Soros be? A. None. None more Jewy. \\nDear Azzy, \\nAsking for a friend. My friend\u2019s sister is a slutbag. Are the muzzies on point with the family honor thing? \\n-Alt Right Capybara \\nDear Alt Right Capybara, \\nMy condolences to your friend and his family for having to suffer the humiliation and discomfort that come with having a slut in the family. For at least 40 years now sluttery has been a widespread epidemic, and has grown worse with each passing year. \\nThe causes of this plague are many. They include easy access to birth control, the breakdown of the nuclear family, the celebration of every form of degeneracy, the \u201cfree love movement\u201d ushered in by stinky hippies who, for the most part, no one would want to have sex with unless they were out of their minds on multiple controlled substances, feminism, the loss of moral authority in our religious institutions, and many, many more reasons, which can all be vaguely but accurately summed up by saying \u201cThe Jews.\u201d So empowered. So inspiring. Thank God we gave them the vote. \\nTo answer your question, no, the muzzies are not on point. We can\u2019t just go around throwing acid in the faces of sluts, as much as we might feel justified in doing so. It\u2019s bad optics, and besides, we\u2019re White, which means that when we have problems, we solve them, instead of chimping out and burning bitches down, whether literally or figuratively. \\nWhat we have to address is the core problems with our society that causes women to become sluts in the first place. \\nThe patriarchy must be restored. When men ran things, sluts were viewed as the vile whores they truly are, and were relegated to the filthy corners of society where no one wants to be. \\nWe have to end no-fault divorce. This is just a way to let a slut-in-hiding marry some poor guy, take him to the cleaners, then slut around on his dime when she\u2019s supposed to be raising the kids. \\nWe have to stop making sluts role models for our kids. Just look at the sluts who came out of kid\u2019s TV programming: Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Miley Cyrus. I\u2019m sure there are many more. And the news media is full of sluts. Megyn Kelly, for example. Just the role model for your little girls goyim. Buy tickets please. \\nWe have to shame these sluts for their behavior. It\u2019s a tried and true tactic, and the proof that it works is in the shrieking and bellowing of SJW sluts when you slut-shame them. \\nAbove all else, we have to marginalize slutty behavior again. That\u2019s the only thing that will really work. And that means we have to keep doing what we\u2019ve been doing, which is push the Overton Window farther and farther to the right until some semblance of sanity and morality is restored to our culture, and slutty behavior is no longer rewarded. \\nAzzy \\nTo submit questions to \u201cDear Azzy\u201d you can post them in the Daily Stormer Forums here , in the Twitter hashtag #AskAzzmador , or for longer or more personal questions feel free to leave me a private message.'"}, "time": 1742561997.6079674}
