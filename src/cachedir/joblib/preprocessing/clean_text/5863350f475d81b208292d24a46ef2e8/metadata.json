That\u2019s really what it is. \u201d The handover of presidential power in Washington, 110 miles away, has brought joy to many in the country and thoroughly unsettled others. But here in Delaware, it foretold an especially bittersweet adjustment. The end of the vice presidency of Joseph R. Biden Jr. has dimmed an   spotlight on a state that, even its own residents admit, can sometimes get lost in the shuffle. \u201cThere\u2019s this big joke, people say, \u2018 ? \u2019\u201d Karen Friday, 48, a   mother in Hockessin, Del. said as she waited recently at the Wilmington train station  \u2014   which is named after Mr. Biden  \u2014   for a friend to disembark. \u201cHe\u2019s contributed so much to letting people know who we are. \u201d \u201cI think,\u201d said Bob Jones, 72, a shoe shiner at the station, \u201che\u2019s the   person we ever had. \u201d Mr. Biden was born in Scranton, Pa. (and he speaks of it often) but he moved to Delaware as a young teenager and has considered it home, more or less, since. Over some 36 years of commuting from here to his job in the United States Senate, and after eight years as the No. 2 man in the Obama administration, Mr. Biden has kept his indelible link, forged by family and framed by tragedy, to the nation\u2019s   state. He owns a home here in Greenville, close to Wilmington, and is expected to keep spending weekends here even though he also plans to have a house in Washington. For decades, he has been Delaware\u2019s biggest cheerleader, and the state has loved him right back. \u201cOne of the historians who specialized in Delaware history pointed out that he probably ranks in Delaware history at the same level as the Delaware leader during the Revolution who rode to Philadelphia to sign the Declaration of Independence,\u201d said Joseph Pika, an emeritus professor of political science at the University of Delaware, referring to Caesar Rodney, who was a lawyer, a member of the Continental Congress and the president (governor in modern political view) of Delaware during most of the Revolutionary War. \u201cThere are people who if he put his foot in his mouth would say, \u2018Oh that\u2019s typical of Biden,\u2019\u201d Mr. Pika said. \u201cThat\u2019s about the harshest criticism you would hear. \u201d The University of Delaware is Mr. Biden\u2019s alma mater and he is planning some kind of partnership as he   civilian life, although the details are still hazy. \u201cThis is a time we could make history,\u201d said Dennis Assanis, the president of the university. \u201cHe\u2019s one of our most prominent alumni. \u201d Mr. Biden, who is 74, is also planning to have a center at the University of Pennsylvania, and to work on a cancer initiative. Mr. Biden had been a lawyer and a councilor for New Castle County  \u2014   one of Delaware\u2019s three  \u2014   when he won his upstart bid for Senate in 1972, at the age of 29. His first wife and their daughter were killed in a car crash that injured his two sons. Mr. Biden took his oath of office at the bedsides of his sons and decided to come home every night, binding the state to his grieving family. \u201cEveryone could relate to the tragedy that he experienced,\u201d Mr. Pika said. He became a ubiquitous presence on the Amtrak train, commuting between Washington and Wilmington as he climbed the ranks in the Senate, and mounted his own failed bids for the presidency before he became the vice president in 2009 as Barack Obama\u2019s running mate. \u201cWe\u2019re not a big state that\u2019s produced a lot of presidents or vice presidents  \u2014   or any presidents or vice presidents,\u201d said Mike Castle, the former Republican governor and congressman for Delaware who described himself as a friend of Mr. Biden\u2019s, \u201cand all of a sudden, one of our residents is plucked out to be the vice president of the United States. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a real honor for us,\u201d Mr. Castle added. Mr. Biden\u2019s family remained closely linked to the state. His second wife, Jill, was a longtime community college teacher here (she now teaches in Virginia) and their daughter, Ashley, now runs a nonprofit organization in the state. But no one was more prominent than his son, Beau Biden, who became the state\u2019s attorney general and was widely expected to become the state\u2019s governor, before he died of a brain tumor in 2015. \u201cJoe Biden stood for eight hours one day as mourners visited to give their condolences,\u201d Mr. Pika said. \u201cIt was felt by the entire state. \u201d Other American statesmen have, of course, become closely associated with their home states. Everyone knows Abraham Lincoln is from Illinois, that the Bushes call Texas home, and that Ronald Reagan lived in California. But this is a state with a population the size of a large city, and one that so many Americans have simply driven through without stopping. So Mr. Biden, who knows everyone and always came back, looms large. \u201cWe really haven\u2019t had national figures,\u201d said Bill Gee, a commercial and real estate lawyer who sometimes sees Mr. Biden at the Wilmington Country Club, and had voted for him for Senate despite being a Republican. \u201cIt was kind of nice for little Delaware. \u201d Mr. Gee, like others here, pointed out that Delaware \u201cpunches above its weight,\u201d like with the tax laws that have drawn scores of businesses to incorporate here. It is close to Washington, Baltimore and Philadelphia. And there are nice beaches. \u201cIf you said name something in Delaware, a lot of people would know DuPont,\u201d Mr. Gee said, referring to the chemical company. \u201cAfter that, hm, people know that we\u2019re one of the large   states. \u201d While the state\u2019s corporate clout is significant, it has, like much of the rest of country, shed manufacturing jobs, and even DuPont has had layoffs in recent years. Mr. Biden has \u201coutlasted the DuPont reputation,\u201d said Nancy Karibjanian, a former reporter who has covered Mr. Biden, and the director of the University of Delaware\u2019s Center for Political Communication. \u201cThe sales tax is nice, but I think Joe Biden is in a category of his own. \u201d It helps that, in a state so small, it is easy to get to know the power players  \u2014   and just about everyone else, too. Indeed, nearly every single person approached at random by a reporter on a recent day at Wilmington\u2019s train station claimed to have personally met the man. \u201cThe very first year he ran for Senate, he was out campaigning in a strip shopping center, all by himself,\u201d Margo Johnson, a retiree, recalled. \u201cHe just chatted it up with my mother. She just thought he was wonderful. \u201d Tyrone Young, 63, a denture maker, said he had waited in line for an hour and a half to pay his respects to the Biden family after Beau died. \u201cThat\u2019s honor, dignity, respect,\u201d Mr. Young said, adding that the Bidens \u201cshowed you the same thing. \u201d Mr. Biden speaks often of his love for the state. When he arrived at the train station here on Friday, after President Trump\u2019s inauguration, he made a characteristic Joycean reference: \u201cWhen I die, Delaware will be written on my heart. \u201d He sounded a similar note eight years ago, during a speech days before he and Mr. Obama were inaugurated. \u201cDelaware,\u201d Mr. Biden said, \u201cI\u2019d not be taking this journey were it not for you. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562041.319148}
