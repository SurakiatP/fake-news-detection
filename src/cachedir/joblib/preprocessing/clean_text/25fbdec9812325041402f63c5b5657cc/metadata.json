Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \\nBaby Boomers and the Interwebz. \\nDear John and other people who have been living under a rock, Google wouldn\u2019t send you an email called, \u201cSomeone has your password.\u201d Likely it would be a message about a possible breach or some urgency about changing your password but they wouldn\u2019t send you something like this. \\nAnd never, EVER EVER EVER click a link in an email, especially if it\u2019s one you don\u2019t recognize. Okay \u2013 is this a copy of the phishing email to Podesta on March 19? pic.twitter.com/1jqUvafUpk \\n\u2014 Jamie Dupree (@jamiedupree) October 28, 2016 \\nA bit.ly link for you to click to change your password. \\nJohn, don\u2019t be stupid. \\nCouldn\u2019t someone in Homeland Security or the NSA or one of those other fancy Federal agencies have taken some time to tell these people the do\u2019s and don\u2019t of being online? *smh* @jamiedupree Actually, wait, I didn't see the bit.ly link. (and I ain't gonna fire it up to see!) Could be the phish, yeah. \\nTypically most people are apprehensive to click a bit.ly link from someone they KNOW, let alone some odd email from Google telling you someone has your password.

Shocked Kyle clicked it \u2026 hope he didn\u2019t have anything signed in or important in that browser or app. @jamiedupree Most definitely. For many reasons. One being that google does not use @Bitly \\n\u2014 SETH WEATHERS (@sethweathers) October 28, 2016 \\nSurely Podesta is like, \u201cNOW YOU TELL ME.\u201d \\nHeh. @jamiedupree Looks like 'that sort of thing',However,\""}, "time": 1742562676.1207228}
