Trump made an important concession about Russia. He criticized American intelligence officials. He sparred with reporters and denounced \u201cfake news. \u201d And that was all before he arrived at the ostensible reason for holding his first formal news conference since July: his plans to extricate himself from the operations of his vast business holdings. Here are the highlights from the whirling, hourlong news conference inside Trump Tower. \u25a0 Mr. Trump said that after his briefing on Friday with American intelligence officials, he now thought Russia was behind the effort to hack his election opponents. \u201cAs far as hacking, I think it was Russia,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u25a0 However, later in the news conference, Mr. Trump wavered slightly when pressed on the matter. \u201cBut you know what, it could have been others also,\u201d he said when asked why he had been so critical of American intelligence officials. \u25a0 He harshly criticized the publication of unverified reports that claimed Russia has salacious information about his behavior and finances. \u201cI think it was disgraceful, disgraceful that the intelligence agencies let any information that turned out to be so false and fake out,\u201d he said. Explaining his Twitter post comparing the United States to Nazi Germany, he said of the leaks: \u201cThat\u2019s something that Nazi Germany would have done and did do. \u201d Mr. Trump added that BuzzFeed, which published the memos in their entirety, is \u201ca failing pile of garbage\u201d that would suffer the consequences for publishing the uncorroborated report. \u25a0 Mr. Trump said he was untroubled by other intelligence reports that have been made public, which said Russia preferred him over Hillary Clinton and that President Vladimir V. Putin ordered the election meddling to benefit him. \u201cIf Putin likes Donald Trump, guess what, folks: That is called an asset, not a liability,\u201d he said. He added that a strong relationship could allow the two nations to work together on difficult international issues. \u25a0 When asked whether he had a message for Mr. Putin, Mr. Trump said: \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be doing it. He won\u2019t be doing it. Russia will have much greater respect for our country when I am leading it. \u201d He added: \u201cThere\u2019s no reset button. We\u2019re either going to get along or we\u2019re not. \u201d But he did not address a question about whether he or anyone on his campaign staff had had contact with Russia during the campaign. \u25a0 Mr. Trump swatted away allegations included in the uncorroborated reports. He said that, when traveling, he warns his aides and bodyguards, \u201cBe very careful, because in your hotel rooms and no matter where you go, you\u2019re gonna probably have cameras. \u201d He also added, apparently referring to a detail in the report about supposed sex videos with prostitutes, \u201cI\u2019m also very much of a germaphobe, believe me. \u201d \u25a0 Discussing the topic the news conference was intended to address, Mr. Trump said he would not divest from his vast business holdings as he takes office. Instead, the   will turn over the operations and control of those holdings to a trust controlled by his eldest sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. \u25a0 The   said that he had considered letting the Affordable Care Act \u201cimplode\u201d on its own and letting Democrats take the political hit he said would follow. But he said he had decided on a more forthright strategy: repeal and replace \u201calmost simultaneously. \u201d Mr. Trump was short on details but clearer in his intention to try to keep Democrats responsible. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to own it politically,\u201d he said. \u25a0 Mr. Trump said that he had asked David J. Shulkin, a current under secretary at the Department of Veterans Affairs, to lead that agency after his team had interviewed \u201cat least 100 people\u201d in the search for a secretary. \u25a0 Near the end of the news conference, Mr. Trump got into a shouting match with Jim Acosta of CNN, who tried to press the   into taking a question. \u201cSince you were attacking our news organization, can you give us a chance?\u201d Mr. Acosta asked. To which Mr. Trump replied: \u201cYour organization\u2019s terrible,\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t be rude,\u201d before dismissing the request once and for all: \u201cYou are fake news. \u201d (CNN was the first to report that Mr. Trump and President Obama had been briefed by intelligence officials on the uncorroborated documents, but the network did not publish them.) \u25a0 Sean Spicer, the incoming White House press secretary, spoke first to address the publication of the unverified reports by BuzzFeed on Tuesday. Mr. Spicer called the reports a \u201cfrankly outrageous and highly irresponsible\u201d attack on Mr. Trump and a \u201csad, pathetic attempt to get clicks. \u201d Mr. Spicer said the documents were not an intelligence report and were categorically false. \u25a0 Vice   Mike Pence followed Mr. Spicer and amplified his condemnation of news reports by BuzzFeed and other news outlets, which he said were \u201cirresponsible\u201d and aimed at discrediting Mr. Trump\u2019s legitimate election victory. \u25a0 Mr. Trump began by thanking news organizations that did not report what he called \u201cthe nonsense that was released. \u201d He said he has \u201cgreat respect for freedom of the press, and all of that. \u201d \u25a0 Mr. Trump said that the document \u201cwas released by maybe the intelligence agencies, who knows, which would be a tremendous blot on their record. \u201d \u25a0 He went on to cast blame on the Democratic National Committee for the hacking. He praised the Republican National Committee for having better defenses and commended Reince Priebus, his incoming chief of staff, who was the committee chairman. \u25a0 Mr. Trump reiterated his description of the report printed by BuzzFeed as \u201cfake news,\u201d saying he did not think Mr. Putin had compromising information about him or the Republican Party. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest, if he did have something, he would have released it,\u201d he said. \u25a0 He denied that he has any business dealings in Russia: \u201cI tweeted out that I have no dealings with Russia. I have no deals in Russia. I have no deals that could happen in Russia because we\u2019ve stayed away. And I have no loans with Russia. As a real estate developer, I have very, very little debt. \u201d \u25a0 Mr. Trump said he had requested that the intelligence agencies produce a \u201cmajor report\u201d on \u201chacking defense\u201d to be delivered 90 days after he takes office, including an examination of \u201cthis situation\u201d with Russia and other incidents of hacking. \u25a0 Sheri A. Dillon, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, took the stage to describe how her client would turn over his business assets to a trust. \u201c  Trump wants there to be no doubt in the minds of the American public that he is completely isolating himself from his business interests,\u201d she said, adding that Mr. Trump\u2019s sons will make all decisions for the company \u201cwithout any involvement whatsoever\u201d from Mr. Trump. She said Mr. Trump would resign from all positions he holds with the Trump Organization, as would his daughter Ivanka. \u25a0 Ms. Dillon said that the Trump Organization would be allowed to make no new foreign deals during the presidency and that any new domestic deals would be subject to strict restrictions. \u201cHe will only know of a deal if he reads about it in the paper or sees it on TV,\u201d Ms. Dillon said, referring to Mr. Trump. She also said an ethics adviser would be appointed to the management team of the Trump Organization. \u25a0 Ms. Dillon argued that selling Mr. Trump\u2019s business would prove more difficult and create more ethical quandaries than the plan that the Trump Organization had chosen. A totally blind trust, she said, would likewise be impossible under the circumstances. And, she added, \u201c  Trump should not be expected to destroy the company he built. \u201d \u25a0 Ms. Dillon laid out what amounts to the Trump administration\u2019s interpretation of the Constitution\u2019s Emoluments Clause, which prohibits government officials from taking payments or gifts from a foreign government. \u201cNo one would have thought when the Constitution was written, that paying your hotel bill was an emolument,\u201d she said. To avoid any appearances of violations, Ms. Dillon said Mr. Trump had pledged to donate to the United States government all profits made by his hotels from payments by foreign governments. \u25a0 Mr. Trump was flanked by a table piled high with manila folders that he said contained paperwork that he had signed turning over control of the Trump Organization to his sons. \u25a0 Mr. Trump joked that if his sons failed to do a good job managing the company during his time in office, he would turn to them and say, \u201cYou\u2019re fired. \u201d \u25a0 In other comments about his businesses, Mr. Trump said he had been offered deals worth $2 billion worth in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, \u201cover the weekend\u201d but had turned them down. \u25a0 Asked about his tax returns, Mr. Trump said he was still not releasing them \u201cbecause they are under audit. \u201d He said that the American people did not care about the documents anyway. \u201cThe only one that cares about my tax returns are the reporters,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u25a0 Mr. Trump said he was looking forward to his inauguration. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a beautiful event,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have great talent, tremendous talent. \u201d And, he added, \u201cmassive crowds\u201d as well. \u25a0 Asked to address criticism that his cabinet choices have presented an abundance of conflicts of interest, Mr. Trump simply praised his appointments. \u201cI think we have one of the great cabinets ever put together,\u201d he said. \u25a0 Mr. Trump said he expected to announce \u201cbig news\u201d in the next few weeks about companies that would build factories in the Midwest. \u25a0 Mr. Trump said Carrier\u2019s decision to keep jobs in Indiana sent a clear signal to other companies thinking of moving production overseas. \u201cThe word is now out,\u201d he said, repeating a call for a \u201cmajor border tax on these companies that are leaving. \u201d \u25a0 About that wall: \u201cI don\u2019t feel like waiting a year, a year and a half I want to start building,\u201d he said. He reiterated that Mexico would reimburse the cost, but he added cryptically that it probably wouldn\u2019t be in the form of \u201ca payment. \u201d \u25a0 Turning to the Supreme Court, Mr. Trump said he expected to announce a nominee to fill the court\u2019s vacant seat two weeks or so after he takes office. \u25a0 Mr. Trump was asked how he would reform the news media he criticizes frequently. \u201cI don\u2019t recommend reforms,\u201d he said. \u201cI recommend people that have some moral compass. \u201d He added, \u201cI will tell you, some of the media outlets that I deal with are fake news, more so than anybody. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628444.761413}
