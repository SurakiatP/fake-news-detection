District Judge Elizabeth K. Dillon ordered the      illegal alien   gang member be released from federal custody, despite his criminal and   history.  The illegal alien previously admitted to selling drugs in Honduras and witnessing multiple murders committed by fellow   members. Now, he will be allowed to live freely in the U. S. In an interview with the Washington Post, the illegal alien spoke about how being a member of the violent   gang felt like a family: \u201cIt was like the family I couldn\u2019t find at home,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought nobody loved me. But when I found them, I said, \u2018This is my family. They love me.\u2019\\u200a\u201d Older gang members gave him money, alcohol, marijuana and cocaine. But soon they demanded he sell drugs, too, including heroin and \u201cpiedra,\u201d or crack. \u201cI began to see things, like them torturing people,\u201d the teen said. \u201cFor rent. Because they belonged to another gang. Because they had screwed up somehow. \u201d The illegal alien gang member arrived in the U. S. as an \u2018unaccompanied minor child,\u2019 who are turned over to the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR). As Breitbart Texas reported, the federal government has continued placing unaccompanied minor children in   gang   across the U. S. One of the two attorneys who helped fight for the   gang member\u2019s release, Simon   and Rebecca Wolozin with the Legal Aid Justice Center, has ties to   billionaire George Soros. Wolozin previously worked for Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundation as a \u2018Legal Research Intern,\u2019 according to her online resume. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart Texas.
