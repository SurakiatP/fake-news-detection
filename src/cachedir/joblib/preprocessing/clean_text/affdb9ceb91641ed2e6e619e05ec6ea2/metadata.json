Joe Manchin  \u2014   who has claimed in the past to be    \u2014   appears now to be supporting abortion industry giant Planned Parenthood. [Thank you for standing with Planned Parenthood, @Sen_JoeManchin! #StandWithPP pic. twitter.   \u2014   PP South Atlantic WV (@PPSATWV) April 19, 2017,   The West Virginia Democrat appeared in a photo, tweeted by Planned Parenthood South Atlantic West Virginia, standing behind a poster that states, \u201cI stand with Planned Parenthood. \u201d The tweet immediately drew the ire of national   leaders who in the past have counted Manchin among members of Congress who support the rights of the unborn. \u201cSen. Manchin used to call himself   but this is the last straw,\u201d said Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser, adding that her organization \u201cwill work tirelessly in the months ahead to make sure West Virginians know of this profound betrayal of the unborn and their mothers. \u201d The national director of Priests for Life, Father Frank Pavone, also reacted, telling Breitbart News: \u201cWould that Sen. Manchin spoke plainly about what \u2018standing by Planned Parenthood\u2019 means! Instead of following the bad example of his Democratic colleagues, who want to support abortion without talking about abortion, Sen. Manchin should stay on the   path and tell his constituents what Planned Parenthood actually does and doesn\u2019t do. \u201d Pavone added that his organization\u2019s StopAbortionNow. org campaign would inform West Virginians of Manchin\u2019s change in position. \u201cWest Virginians supported President Trump last November and will face a choice next year as to whether to   Sen. Manchin,\u201d Pavone continued. \u201cWe have already communicated through Priests for Life to all the churches of West Virginia that Planned Parenthood needs to be defunded and that they need to let Sen. Manchin know where they stand on this before they make their voting decisions in the midterm elections. \u201d As a candidate for the presidency, Republican Donald Trump outlined four policy commitments in a letter to   leaders: As the Charleston   reported, Manchin has raised about $235, 000 for his 2018   campaign in the first quarter of the year, but only $7, 900 is derived from sources within his home state. \u201cSen. Joe Manchin,  . Va. has received more money from individual donors in Texas ($95, 600) Washington D. C. ($33, 000) New York ($32, 300) Massachusetts ($22, 500) Virginia ($19, 700) Maryland ($10, 700) and Connecticut ($10, 400) than West Virginia,\u201d states the report. Dannenfelser observed that Planned Parenthood is \u201cthe nation\u2019s largest abortion business. \u201d \u201cIt is an enormous mistake both morally and politically for Sen. Manchin to side with Planned Parenthood,\u201d she added, continuing, \u201cIn more than nine times out of ten, Planned Parenthood resolves pregnancy with abortion. They are clearly an     business  \u2014   yet taxpayers are forced to fork over nearly $554 million each year to their coffers. Where does Sen. Manchin stand on this injustice? Last month, he voted to force states to fund the abortion giant through Title X grants. That was only a day after new footage was released showing a former Planned Parenthood abortionist describe the force needed to dismember a    unborn child struggling to survive in the womb. \u201d Planned Parenthood performs at least 300, 000 abortions every year. The group has been using political muscle to bolster its image in the wake of videos released that led to allegations it sells the body parts of aborted babies for a profit. The allegations led to multiple congressional investigations. Ultimately, the Senate Judiciary Committee and the House Select Investigative Panel have referred Planned Parenthood Federation of America, several of the largest Planned Parenthood affiliates in the country, and three of their business associates in the fetal tissue procurement industry, to the FBI and U. S. Department of Justice for criminal prosecution. \u201cThe Democratic Party is, no doubt, putting pressure here on a senator who has in many instances been an exception to the rule and has taken   positions,\u201d Pavone said. \u201cI urge him to resist this pressure, to be honest with himself and his constituents,\u201d he added, \u201cand to let the people of West Virginia know the facts about Planned Parenthood so that they, in turn, can let him know whether they think he should support this criminal,   enterprise, which is more a political machine than a health organization. \u201d A recent Marist poll found that 61 percent of Americans oppose taxpayer funding of abortion, including 40 percent of those who say they are \u201c \u201d and 41 percent of Democrats.'"}, "time": 1742561767.8432226}
