As such, I\u2019ve avoided writing about it, hoping that someone from the Clinton team would come out and put all the craziness to rest. That has not happened. \\nIndeed, the topic was trending at #1 for much of the morning on Twitter, and continues to trend at #3 many hours later. All day, I\u2019ve been trying as hard as possible to disassociate my confirmation bias about the Clintons, from this story. As such, I\u2019ve been waiting for a good \u201cdebunking\u201d piece to come out, but have yet to see one. \\nFor those of you who are interested in the topic, here\u2019s a measured take from The Washington Times : \\nA new WikiLeaks release of stolen emails belonging to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman John Podesta reveal an invitation by his brother to a \u201cSpirit Cooking dinner\u201d at the home of artist Marina Abramovic. \\n\u201cSpirit Cooking with Essential Aphrodisiac Recipes\u201d was released by Ms. Abramovic in 1996, but the \u201cingredients\u201d call for \u201cfresh breast milk with fresh sperm milk\u201d to be consumed \u201con earthquake nights.\u201d \\nNew York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art called it a \u201ccookbook\u201d for \u201cevocative instructions for actions or thoughts.\u201d Another recipe calls for \u201cfresh morning urine.\u201d \\n\u201cAre you in NYC Thursday July 9 Marina wants you to come to dinner Mary?\u201d Tony Podesta says in an email forwarded to his brother June 28, 2015. \\n\u201cDear Tony, I am so looking forward to the Spirit Cooking dinner at my place,\u201d Ms. Abramovic says in a June 25 email sent at 2:35 a.m. GMT +2. \u201cDo you think you will be able to let me know if your brother is joining? All my love, Marina.\u201d \\nYou can see the source email through the following tweet by Wikileaks: Tony Podesta.'"}, "time": 1742562184.5548267}
