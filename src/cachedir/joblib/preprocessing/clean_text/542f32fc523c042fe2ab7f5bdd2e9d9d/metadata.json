[The    from Calgary, Alberta, had recently moved to the Netherlands to be with her fiance Tyler Ferguson, his sister Cassie Ferguson Rowe said. The couple was engaged three months ago.  Ferguson had been walking a few steps ahead of his fiancee on the bridge, and then held her as she died, said Ferguson Rowe. \u201cMy baby brother lost the love of his life on the London bridge. In a split second, his entire life was ripped away from him,\u201d Ferguson Rowe said. Born and raised in Castlegar, British Columbia, Archibald had later lived in Calgary, where she worked at a homeless shelter before moving to Europe to be with Ferguson. Her family in Castlegar said in a statement that Archibald \u201cwould have had no understanding of the callous cruelty that caused her death. \u201d \u201cShe had room in her heart for everyone and believed strongly that every person was to be valued and respected,\u201d the family statement said. Kathy Christiansen, executive director of Alpha House in Calgary, said Archibald had worked at the shelter for homeless people addicted to drugs and alcohol until recently. She called Archibald a talented social worker and exceptional human being who inspired all who worked with her. \u201cChrissy was a bright light,\u201d she said. Before that, Archibald was an   social work student from Calgary\u2019s Mount Royal University. Peter Choate, an assistant professor of social work, said his former student \u201cfit the profession. \u201d \u201cShe was very caring but at the same time very professional. She understood that she wasn\u2019t in charge of the lives of her clients. She was able to offer her clients opportunities to do things with their lives,\u201d Choate said. \u201cShe got it. The family should be very proud of the young woman, the social worker that she was. As a profession for us it is a loss. \u201d The Archibald family asked that people honor her memory by making the community a better place. \u201cVolunteer your time and labor or donate to a homeless shelter,\u201d the statement said. \u201cTell them Chrissy sent you. \u201d The hashtag #Chrissysentme was being used on Twitter to express sadness for the family\u2019s loss. Inspired by the call for meaningful action, some people pledged to make donations to shelters, soup kitchens and other community groups. Ferguson Rowe said she hoped the use of the hashtag would \u201curge people to not let her death be in vain, to do good in their community. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s what she would have wanted,\u201d Ferguson Rowe said.'"}, "time": 1742628560.166235}
