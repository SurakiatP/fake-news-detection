And as a community organizer who tried to document police bias after the death of Freddie Gray, Mr. Kelly, 45, had always expected that a federal investigation would uncover a pattern of racial discrimination. Even so, the scathing report that the Justice Department unveiled here on Wednesday  \u2014   a   indictment of how Baltimore police officers have for years violated the Constitution and federal law by systematically stopping, searching (in some cases  ) and harassing black residents  \u2014   gave him a jolt. \u201cHearing the actual numbers, like on the traffic stops, is blowing my mind,\u201d Mr. Kelly said. Release of the   report, at a packed City Hall news conference here, was another wrenching moment of   in this majority black city. Even as Mayor Stephanie   and the police commissioner, Kevin Davis, accepted the findings  \u2014   both vowed to turn the Baltimore Police Department into a \u2018\u2018model for the nation\u2019\u2019  \u2014   there was relief, but also rage and skepticism among black residents here who wondered if anything would change. \u201cMere words by officials mean little when it\u2019s people on the ground who are living with these material conditions every day,\u2019\u2019 said the Rev. Heber Brown III, a Baptist pastor who was among a small group of community leaders who met privately last year with Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch. \u201cFrom the streets to the suites, everybody is skeptical and furious. \u2019\u2019 In one stark statistic after another, the department\u2019s report helped validate the experiences of Mr. Brown, Mr. Kelly and countless others in poor   neighborhoods who regard the police as an occupying force. Many wanted to know what took so long. \u201cIt\u2019s like a huge taste of \u2018too little, too late,\u2019\u201d said Brandon Scott, 32, a member of the Baltimore City Council, who said he ran for office to correct police abuses that have been going on since before he was born. In Baltimore, a city that is 63 percent black, the Justice Department found that 91 percent of those arrested on discretionary offenses like \u201cfailure to obey\u201d or \u201ctrespassing\u201d were  . Blacks make up 60 percent of Baltimore\u2019s drivers but account for 82 percent of traffic stops. Of the 410 pedestrians who were stopped at least 10 times in the five and a half years of data reviewed, 95 percent were black. \u201cSeeing it all collected and pulled together really hit me in the solar plexus,\u2019\u2019 said Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, who lived here for 15 years while teaching law at the University of Maryland. But what most infuriates her, she said, is that city leaders  \u2014   including a series of black mayors  \u2014   have ignored the problem for decades. \u201c  have not been silent about this,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cIt\u2019s so rampant, it\u2019s so widespread, this kind of harassment of the   community in a city that\u2019s majority   that you really have to ask yourself, Why did it take this?\u201d The report is a first step toward a negotiated settlement, known as a consent decree, in which police training and practices will be overhauled under court supervision. The city has already entered into an \u2018\u2018agreement in principle,\u2019\u2019 the mayor said, adding, \u201cWe have a very long journey ahead of us. \u2019\u2019 Mr. Davis, who described himself as \u201cvery, very concerned\u201d by the findings, said he had already fired six officers who had engaged in misconduct uncovered by Justice Department investigators. \u201cThose who choose to wear this uniform and choose to blatantly disregard someone\u2019s rights absolutely should be uncomfortable,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause we are not going to tolerate it. \u201d The report took 14 months the mayor invited the Justice Department in after the April 2015 death of Mr. Gray, a    black man who sustained a fatal spinal cord injury in police custody, set off riots. As the inquiry has progressed, she said, Baltimore has worked closely with the department to change police practices. City officials have revised 26 policies, she said, including the one governing use of force, and officials are engaged in \u2018\u2018active discussion\u2019\u2019 about giving residents a role in determining how officers are punished  \u2014   a central demand of civil rights advocates. The city has also retrofitted its transport vans  \u2014   officials say Mr. Gray was injured while riding unbuckled in a van  \u2014   and has begun issuing body cameras to officers. But none of the steps can substitute for the wholesale change in culture that people here agree is required. Mr. Brown could barely contain his rage as he cited one anecdote from the report  \u2014   about a teenage boy who reported having been   in front of his girlfriend. The officer denied   the teenager during a drug arrest, and the charges were later dropped for lack of evidence. After the teenager filed a complaint, he told investigators that he was   again by the same officer who, he said, then grabbed his genitals. \u201cWhat that officer did is not just violate a body, but he injured a spirit, a soul, a psyche,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Brown said. \u201cAnd that young boy will not easily forget what happened to him, in public with his girlfriend. It\u2019s hard to really put gravity and weight to that type of offense. \u2019\u2019 Tensions over race and policing here date to at least 1980, when the N. A. A. C. P. called for a federal investigation into police brutality, and they continued with a   strategy known as \u201c  policing,\u201d which was singled out by the Justice Department. \u201cPeople say, \u2018driving while black, walking while black,\u2019\u201d Mr. Scott, the city councilman, said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about zero tolerance, it\u2019s breathing while black. \u201d Baltimore is now among nearly two dozen cities that the Obama administration has investigated after they were accused of widespread unconstitutional policing. Once Baltimore reaches a settlement, an overhaul of the Police Department will take years and will cost millions Ms.   and her aides put the price tag at $5 million to $10 million a year for five to 10 years. Jonathan Smith, a former Justice Department official who supervised a similar inquiry in Ferguson, Mo. said reports like the one issued Wednesday were a required step toward community healing. \u201cI\u2019ve often thought of the reports as a necessary cathartic moment, maybe an act of witness, where you give voice to people who wouldn\u2019t otherwise have a voice,\u201d Mr. Smith said. Mr. Kelly, the head of the No Boundaries Coalition, an advocacy group in   the West Baltimore neighborhood where Mr. Gray grew up, agreed. After Mr. Gray died, his organization convened hearings and conducted dozens of interviews for a report, \u201cThe People\u2019s Findings,\u201d that he submitted to the Justice Department. He was among those providing testimony. \u201cYou are just hoping that you don\u2019t get arrested for loitering or something crazy like that, and you get 23 hours in central booking for something that never even makes it to a courtroom,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s been routine my whole life. I can\u2019t remember a time when that wasn\u2019t the way it was. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562002.9019089}
