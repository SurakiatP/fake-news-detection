[Lee had been scheduled to tape a cooking segment on Fox  Friends last week, and Ryan was reportedly asked to try the food. But the Food Network star says she didn\u2019t want the Republican lawmaker anywhere near her.  \u201cAt first what occurred to me is that we are both from Wisconsin,\u201d Lee told Page Six. \u201cAnd I realized he is the one thing from Wisconsin that I cannot tolerate or stomach. \u201d \u201cI just do not stand for anything he stands for,\u201d she continued. Lee, the longtime girlfriend of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, said \u201cI was so angry I was shaking, and I never had that experience before in my life or on any show. \u201d \u201cI love Fox  Friends. That was the only time that happened to me,\u201d she added. \u201cI do not get angry for too long. He left the set, and I was back to Sandra Lee. \u201d While attending the Breast Cancer Research Foundation\u2019s Hot Pink Party on Friday, Lee told Page Six that she had \u201cbeen really surprised about the reaction. \u201d \u201cI think it is because I have never stated my opinion,\u201d she told the outlet. \u201cJust because I chose not to state my opinion does not mean I do not have one. When it comes to health care or childhood hunger issues, I am not going to be quiet, tolerant or silent about my experiences or my convictions. \u201d Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson'"}, "time": 1742562108.1132658}
