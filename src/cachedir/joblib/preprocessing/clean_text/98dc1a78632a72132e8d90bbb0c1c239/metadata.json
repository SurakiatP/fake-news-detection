[He said \u201cI am not saying there are not financial stability risks in the UK   \u2026     but there are greater short term risks on the continent in the transition than there are in the UK\u201d reports the Daily Telegraph.  This constitutes a substantial   for the Goldman Sachs alumnus, who argued during that referendum that voting to leave the EU could hit growth and tip the country into a technical recession. Following the vote, however, the UK economy has performed strongly. Growth in the construction, services, and manufacturing sectors are at     and   highs, respectively, according to the purchasing managers indices (PMIs) for each sector. PMIs are among the leading indicators for the economic health of a country. Ewen Stewart, a director at the Global Britain think tank and leading Scottish economist, welcomed Carney\u2019s apparent change of heart, telling Breitbart London he was \u201cbaffled\u201d by the central bank\u2019s gloomy   forecasts. \u201cThe risks of Brexit do indeed lie with the EU and not the UK   \u2026     because of the inherent contradictions within the Eurozone,\u201d he confirmed. \u201cThe EU have far more to lose than the UK, especially as it becomes ever more apparent that the UK is well positioned to strike free trade deals with the US, Australia, and other   regions. \u201d Andrew Haldane, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, has described the Bank\u2019s inaccurate   forecasts as a \u201cMichael Fish\u201d moment, recalling the BBC weatherman\u2019s infamous   dismissal of a hurricane prediction hours before the Great Storm of 1987 struck Britain. Richard Tice,   of the Leave Means Leave campaign, told Breitbart London that Carney was simply \u201ccatching up with what we Brexiteers knew all along\u201d. \u201cThe UK will thrive, we have the upper hand and nothing to fear. He should offer to resign given his woeful forecasting track record. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563933.0860295}
