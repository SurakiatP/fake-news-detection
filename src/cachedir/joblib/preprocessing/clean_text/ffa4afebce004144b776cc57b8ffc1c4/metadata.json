Yet what Duterte is gaming at is pure realpolitik; if he prevails, he will be able to deftly play the US against China to the benefit of Filipino interests. \\n\u201cThe springtime of our relationship\u201d \\nIt did start with a bang; during Duterte\u2019s China visit, Manila inked no less than $13 billion in deals with Beijing \u2013 from trade and investment to drug control, maritime security and infrastructure. \\nBeijing pulled out all stops to make Duterte feel welcomed. \\nPresident Xi Jinping suggested Manila and Beijing should \u201ctemporarily put aside\u201d the intractable South China Sea disputes and learn from the \u201cpolitical wisdom\u201d of history \u2013 as in give space to diplomatic talks. After all, the two peoples were \u201cblood-linked brothers.\u201d \\nDuterte replied in kind; \u201cEven as we arrive in Beijing close to winter, this is the springtime of our relationship,\u201d he told Xi at the Great Hall of the People. \\nChina is already the Philippines\u2019 second-largest trade partner, behind Japan, the US and Singapore. Filipino exports to these three are at roughly 42.7 percent of the total, compared to 22.1 to China/Hong Kong. Imports from China are roughly 16.1 percent of the total. Even as trade with China is bound to rise, what really matters for Duterte is massive Chinese infrastructure investment. \\nWhat this will mean in practice is indeed ground-breaking; the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) will definitely be involved in Philippine economic development; Manila will be more involved in promoting smooth China-ASEAN relations in all sorts of regional issues (it takes the rotating chair of ASEAN in 2017); and the Philippines will be more integrated in the New Silk Roads, a.k.a. One Belt, One Road (OBOR). \\nThree strikes; no wonder the US is out. And there\u2019s even a fourth strike, embedded in Duterte\u2019s promise that he will soon end military cooperation with the US, despite the opposition of part of the Filipino armed forces. \\nWatch the First Island Chain \\nThe build-up had already been dramatic enough. On the eve of his meeting with Xi, talking to members of the Filipino community in Beijing, Duterte said, \u201cit\u2019s time to say goodbye\u201d to the US; \u201cI will not ask but if they (the Chinese) offer and if they\u2019ll ask me, do you need this aid? [I will say] Of course, we are very poor.\u201d \\nThen the clincher; \u201cI will not go to America anymore \u2026 We will just be insulted there.\u201d Naval Base Subic Bay was a major ship-repair, supply, and rest and recreation facility of the Spanish Navy and subsequently the United States Navy located in Olongapo, Zambales, Philippines. The base was 262 square miles, about the size of Singapore. It was finally turned over to the Filipino government in 1992. \\nThe US was the colonial power in the Philippines from 1899 to 1942. Hollywood permeates the collective unconscious. English is the lingua franca \u2013 side by side with tagalog. But the tentacles of Uncle Sam\u2019s \u201cprotection\u201d racket are not exactly welcomed. Two of the largest components of the US Empire of Bases were located for decades in the Philippines; Clark Air Force Base and Subic Bay Naval Base. \\nClark, occupying 230 square miles, with 15,000 people, was busy to death during the Vietnam War \u2013 the main hub for men and hardware in and out of Saigon. Then it turned into one of those Pentagon \u201cforward operating\u201d HQs. Subic, occupying 260 square miles, was as busy as Clark. It was the forward operating base for the US 7th Fleet. \\nAlready in 1987, before the end of the Cold War, the RAND corporation was alarmed by the loss of both bases; that would be \u201cdevastating for regional security\u201d. Devastating\u201d in the \u2013 mythical \u2013 sense of \u201cdefending the interests of ASEAN\u201d and the \u201csecurity of the sea-lanes\u201d. \\nTranslation; the Pentagon and the US Navy would lose a key instrument of pressure over ASEAN, as protecting the \u201csecurity of the sea-lanes\u201d was always the key justification for those bases. \\nAnd lose they eventually did; Clark was closed down in November 1991, and Subic in November 1992. \\nIt took years for China to sense an opening \u2013 and profit from it; after all during the 1990s and the early 2000s, the absolute priority was breakneck speed internal development. But then Beijing did the math; no more US bases opened untold vistas as far as the First Island Chain is concerned. \\nThe First Island Chain is a product, over millennia, of the fabulous tectonic forces of the Ring of Fire; a chain of islands running from southern Japan in the north to Borneo in the south. For Beijing, they work as a sort of shield for the Chinese eastern seaboard; if this chain is secure, Asia is secure. \\nFor all practical purposes, Beijing considers the First Island Chain as a non-negotiable Western Pacific demarcation zone \u2013 ideally with no foreign (as in US) interference. The South China Sea \u2013 which in parts is characterized by Manila as the Western Philippine Sea \u2013 is inside the First Island Chain. So to really secure the First Island Chain, the South China Sea must be free of foreign interference. \\nAnd here we are plunged at the heart of arguably the key 21st century hotspot in Asian geopolitics \u2013 the main reason for the Obama administration\u2019s pivot to Asia. \\nThe US Navy so far counted on the Philippines to oppose the proverbial, hyped up \u201cChinese aggression\u201d in the South China and East China seas. The neocon/neoliberalcon industrial-military complex fury against \u201cunhinged\u201d Duterte\u2019s game-changer is that containing China and ruling over the First Island Chain has been at the core of US naval strategy since the beginning of the Cold War. \\nBeijing, meanwhile, will have all the time needed to polish its strategic environment. This has nothing to do with \u201cfreedom of navigation\u201d and protecting sea-lanes; everyone needs South China Sea cross-trade. It\u2019s all about China \u2013 perhaps within the next ten years \u2013 being able to deny \u201caccess\u201d to the US Navy in the South China Sea and inside the First Island Chain. \\nDuterte\u2019s game-changing \u201cAmerica has lost\u201d is just a new salvo in arguably the key 21st century geopolitical thriller. A Supreme Court justice in Manila, for instance, has warned Duterte that, were he to give up sovereignty over the Scarborough Shoal, he could be impeached. That won\u2019t happen; Duterte wants loads of Chinese trade and investment, not abdicate from sovereignty. He\u2019d rather be ready to confront being demonized by the hyperpower as much as the late Hugo Chavez was in his heyday. \\nCrossposted with Strategic Culture , first iteration.
