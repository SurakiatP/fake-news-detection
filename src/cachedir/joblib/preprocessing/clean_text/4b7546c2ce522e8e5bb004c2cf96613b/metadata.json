This newest trick can be called, \u201cbuild him up so as to try to knock him down. \u201d  A case in point is the lead editorial in The New York Times on January 31, entitled, \u201cPresident Bannon?\u201d  That editorial was mostly the usual lefty litany of attacks against Stephen K. Bannon, the former executive chairman of Breitbart News, now serving in the White House as President Donald Trump\u2019s Chief Strategist.  Indeed, the utter familiarity of the   attacks makes Virgil conclude that Times writers must think that Times readers never get tired of reading the same \u201cgolden oldie\u201d  .  However, there was one thing new in that latest attack. And that was the headline, \u201cPresident Bannon?\u201d  Even people a lot younger than old Virgil can plainly see what the Times was trying to do here namely, build Bannon up into sort of giant existential threat.  In this telling, he\u2019s a threat not only to liberalism, but also, a threat to the constitutional order of the Republic.  The   reader is thus supposed to think to himself or herself, \u201cSteve Bannon is bad enough.  But President Bannon?  Yikes!\u201d  The   goal is to provoke ever more outrage from   readers.  And the   goal, of course, is to somehow knock out Bannon, as a way of somehow knocking out President Donald Trump. The latest flashpoint of MSM angst is Bannon\u2019s participation in the National Security Council (NSC).  On January 28, President Trump issued a   memorandum outlining his update to the structure of the NSC it\u2019s typical for any  new president to do this at the beginning of his term. In the course of all the legalese, the new presidential document assigned Bannon a place on the \u201cPrincipals Committee\u201d of the NSC.  That is, Bannon will participate in NSC deliberations \u2014  under the direction, of course, of the President.  Other members of the NSC include Vice President Mike Pence (who is to preside over NSC meetings in the President\u2019s absence) the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, as well as six others, including Bannon.  In addition, another   senior figures in the government are mentioned as frequent, or likely, participants.  In other words, the most that one can say is that Bannon is one of ten regular \u201cPrincipals,\u201d and nearly a score of total attendees.   And yet since the MSM mantra is All   All The Time, obedient journos have gone into overdrive.  For example, veteran   Jonathan Alter, a fixture on MSNBC, has tweeted: Breaking: obscure law requires Sen confirmation for WH aide like Bannon to serve on NSC. 50 U. S. Code \u00a7 3021   Wow.  Citing an exact legal code makes Alter\u2019s claim sound so official.  But then, a lot of fake news sounds official.  Yet as Jack Landman Goldsmith \u2014  who served as a   appointee in the Bush 43 Justice and Defense Departments, and is now a professor at Harvard Law School \u2014  tweeted in response: Bannon is not on the NSC.   Order says he is invited to attend as   attendee.  Lots and lots of people not on NSC attend. Goldsmith has it right: According to federal law \u2014  the National Security Act of 1947, as amended \u2014  the National Security Council, and also, the more recent Homeland Security Council, have a very few \u201cstatutory\u201d members that is, formal memberships, enumerated in the underlying statute.  And nothing that Trump decided last week changes that such a change would require an act of Congress.   In other words, while Bannon certainly has a high position in the Trump White House, he has no statutory role in the NSC.  He is not, for example, in any way a part of the National Chain of Command that\u2019s another matter of statute.  Bannon is simply a valued member of the President\u2019s team \u2014  and we all already knew that.  And yet the reality of the situation notwithstanding, the Times went to work.  In that editorial, \u201cPresident Bannon?\u201d the purported newspaper of record attempted to whip Bannon\u2019s elevated role into some sort of coup d\u2019etat: A new executive order, politicizing the process for national security decisions, suggests Mr. Bannon is positioning himself not merely as a Svengali but as the de facto president. Got that, Times readers?  Bannon isn\u2019t merely some sort of wickedly hypnotic figure, he\u2019s on his way to being the \u201cde facto president. \u201d   As we have seen, there\u2019s not a scintilla of truth to any of this, but as we have also seen, the Times loves  .  And with that in mind, the editorial made the same fallacious point a second time:  While Mr. Trump long ago embraced Mr. Bannon\u2019s politics, he would be wise to reconsider allowing him to run his White House. You get the idea: \u201cde facto president,\u201d \u201crun his White House. \u201d  As they say, sometimes a falsehood, repeated often enough, becomes persuasive \u2014  at least that\u2019s the result that the Times is striving towards.  This repetitive technique is sometimes called \u201cThe Big Lie. \u201d  Or, as Virgil likes to say, magnum mendacium.   Of course, the Times is hardly alone on the   bandwagon right now, a hashtag campaign on Twitter, #StopPresidentBannon, is going full blast.  Indeed, much of the MSM is joining in this attempted stampede.  Here, for example, is a headline from the   Beltway publication, Foreign Policy: \u201cSteve Bannon Is Making Sure There\u2019s No White House Paper Trail, Says Intel Source: The Trump administration\u2019s chief strategist has already taken control of both policy and process on national security. \u201d  Got that?  The goal of all this reportorial alarmism is to make you afraid, very afraid. In this instance, the supposed issue of import is NSC  .  Given that the Trump administration is not even two weeks old, it\u2019s unlikely that any sort of precise precedent for records has been established, and yet that didn\u2019t stop reporter Kate Brannen from declaring, \u201cThe lack of a paper trail documenting the   process is also troubling. \u201d  Brannen\u2019s source for all this ominousness, we might add, was an \u201cintelligence official. \u201d  Ah yes, the   \u201cintelligence official,\u201d always ready to give a reporter a juicy   quote.  We might note that is the modus operandi of the Deep State.  In the past, Virgil has chronicled the Deep State\u2019s effort against the Trump administration, as well as, of course, the MSM campaign waged against Bannon.  So this latest is just another blast from the Deep State, dutifully trumpeted by the MSM.     Amusingly, that Foreign Policy article held up the Bush 43 administration as the gold standard of NSC  .  That might be a source of amusement \u2014  albeit bitter amusement \u2014  for those who remember the follies of, for example, the Iraq War.   And yet for veterans of that vainglorious conflict, and for the families of the fallen and the wounded, it\u2019s no comfort to know that the Bush NSC was careful to write up a thorough \u201csummary of conclusions\u201d after every meeting.  The rest of us, too, can quickly see: the critical issue is the quality of the decision, not the quantity of the paperwork. Yet as we know by now, the MSM attacks \u2014  grabbing any available hammer, no matter how ridiculous \u2014  will never stop.  The same Foreign Policy, we might add, made ample room on the same day for another   this one from dedicated #NeverTrumper Max Boot:  \u201cPresident Bannon\u2019s Hugely Destructive First Week in Office: The puppet master is leading the Trump administration down a road of carnage. \u201d  For his part, Virgil has always figured that hardcore supporters of the Iraq War, such as Boot, ought to be a little more circumspect before throwing around phrases such as \u201croad to carnage. \u201d   Still, the real issue isn\u2019t Bannon.  Instead, the real issue is Trump.  And Foreign Policy gave that game away in yet another story, headlined, \u201c3 Ways to Get Rid of President Trump Before 2020. \u201d  That piece, written by Rosa Brooks, a former under secretary of defense in the Obama administration,   raises the idea \u2014  Virgil kids not \u2014  of a military coup d\u2019etat against Trump.   Okay, so Brooks is showing a high degree of kookiness that should forever disqualify her from future public service.  And yet, of course, the Trump administration is young, and so there\u2019s plenty of time for other \u201cprogressives\u201d to join Brooks\u2019 extremity.  Meanwhile, the rest of us can watch these antics with a combination of bewilderment and bemusement.  The only thing we should always bear in mind is that the MSM\u2019s real target is Trump.'"}, "time": 1742562344.2286873}
