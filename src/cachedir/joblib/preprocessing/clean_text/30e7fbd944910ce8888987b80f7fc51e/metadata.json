UPDATE: A statement from the UC Davis College Republicans: \u201cWe were told by the chief of Davis police that they could not guarantee the safety of the students, the speaker, or the police officers if the event should go ahead,\u201d said Gabrielle McDowell, vice chair of the UC Davis College Republicans. \u201cAs the organisation hosting the event, we would have been held personally responsible for any harm caused as a result of its taking place. We were therefore forced to cancel the event\u201d she continued. UPDATE 2: The Davis College Republicans have clarified their position, and are now saying they were lied to and intimidated by UC Davis, who, according to DCR executive director Andrew Mendoza, \u201cbasically took the decision [to cancel] without us. \u201d DCR communications director Kurtie Kellner also alleges that they were told by UC Davis official Milton Lang that protesters were wielding hammers, a concern that was a significant factor in the decision to cancel.'"}, "time": 1742562539.62347}
