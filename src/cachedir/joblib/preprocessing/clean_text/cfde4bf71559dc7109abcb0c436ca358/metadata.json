It started when the police confronted a man who was trying to remove a \u201cboot\u201d device attached to a tire on his car, officials said, and escalated into a chaotic chase through Midtown Manhattan that ended with officers shooting at him 18 times. The man, Akram Joudeh, 32, was critically injured and taken to Bellevue Hospital Center, the police said. The   detective, identified by the police as Brian O\u2019Donnell, was in serious condition. Two other officers were taken to the center with injuries that were not  . The episode began around 5 p. m. at West 32nd Street and Broadway when several officers responded to a report that Mr. Joudeh was trying to remove the device, Police Commissioner William J. Bratton said at a news conference on Thursday night. The police said they believed Mr. Joudeh, whose last known residence was in Queens, was living out of his car. The chief of department, James O\u2019Neill, said Mr. Joudeh pulled a cleaver from his waist band, threatened the officers and then fled. At one point, the chief said, the man mounted the front grille of a marked police car that had responded to the call. As officers pursued him, a uniformed sergeant \u201cdeployed a Taser, striking the suspect without apparent effect,\u201d Chief O\u2019Neill said. As Mr. Joudeh ran along West 32nd Street, the   detective, who was headed to Penn Station after a day in court, saw the pursuit and tried to stop him. He was struck in the head with the cleaver, \u201ccausing an approximate   gash from his temple about down to his jaw,\u201d the chief said. Officers then fired at the man, striking him several times, the chief said. Officials said Mr. Joudeh had several past arrests, but they would not elaborate on his criminal history. In 2010, Mr. Joudeh pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor of petit larceny and was sentenced to 90 days, according to public records. In 2009, he was charged with grand larceny and criminal possession of stolen property, but those felonies were dismissed, records show. He pleaded guilty to unauthorized use of a vehicle and was fined, but served no time. Asked about the possibility that the attack might have been tied to terrorism, Chief O\u2019Neill said, \u201cAs part of our investigation, nothing\u2019s off the table. \u201d The chase left commuters and tourists scurrying for cover as officers flooded the area during the start of the evening rush near a transit hub. Mr. Bratton addressed concerns that so many shots were fired in such a busy area. \u201cSufficient shots were fired to deter the attack on my officers,\u201d he said. Richard DeWald, a nurse, said he narrowly avoided Mr. Joudeh during the pursuit. \u201cHe just seemed wild and crazy,\u201d Mr. DeWald, 56, said. \u201cFirst there was yelling, and then all I heard was the gunshots. \u201d Witnesses said they saw Mr. Joudeh on the corner of 32nd Street and Avenue of the Americas, clutching a large meat cleaver to his chest. They said he was silent and his face was expressionless. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say a word, that\u2019s the thing,\u201d said Jonathan Schneier, who works at a software company and watched the episode unfold from across the street. Mr. Schneier said the officers, shouting \u201cDrop the weapon,\u201d pointed their guns at the man, who appeared \u201cflustered. \u201d \u201cHe just looked like a crazy guy with a huge weapon,\u201d he said. \u201cHe just literally looked like a deer in headlights. \u201d Mr. Schneier said the man began \u201csprinting as fast as he could\u201d and was pursued by police. About 10 seconds after that, Mr. Schneier said, he heard gunshots. \u201cI called my girlfriend right away and told her what happened,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s New York. Stuff happens. \u201d Robert Mennella of Bridgewater, N. J. said he had left the subway station at 32nd Street and Seventh Avenue and was headed to Penn Station. He said he saw a number of unmarked and marked police cars racing along 32nd Street when he heard gunshots. \u201cEverybody turned around,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people stood there with their phones to take pictures, and I just took off. \u201d He said he ran to Penn Station and saw officers from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and from New Jersey Transit running upstairs. \u201cI just told them \u2018shots fired,\u2019 and they started running faster,\u201d he said. Lina Gana, a laser technician at Cosmed Laser and Spa on Avenue of the Americas, said she heard gunshots that \u201csounded like a machine gun. \u201d Another technician, Nailya Howe, who has worked in the area for three years and at the spa for more than a year, said she was surprised by what happened. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard gunshots here before,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a very quiet area. \u201d Ms. Gana agreed. \u201cTen minutes before the shooting, I was walking down the street getting food for everyone,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then this happened. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562103.3309748}
