President Obama formally endorsed Hillary Clinton. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been someone so qualified to hold this office,\u201d he said. He earlier secured a pledge from Bernie Sanders to work closely with Mrs. Clinton to unify Democrats against Donald Trump, though no promise to drop out. Senator Elizabeth Warren also backed Mrs. Clinton on Thursday evening and criticized Mr. Trump for his attack on a federal judge, Gonzalo P. Curiel. \u201cYou, Donald Trump, are a total disgrace,\u201d Ms. Warren said in a speech to the American Constitution Society. _____ 2. Our analysis of voter data suggests Mr. Trump has a small but real chance of winning even without gains among nonwhite voters. Exit polls from 2012  \u2014   the source of conclusions that the Republicans needed to broaden their appeal  \u2014   obscured the existence of millions of white,   and older voters with limited education. Those are the very voters who tend to support Mr. Trump. _____ 3. A federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled that the Second Amendment did not guarantee the right to carry concealed weapons. The decision was sharply criticized by the National Rifle Association. But it is in keeping with decisions in other courts, which some analysts say minimizes the likelihood of a Supreme Court review. \u201cThis is a huge decision,\u201d an expert in constitutional law said. \u201cThis is a major victory for gun control advocates. \u201d _____ 4. The World Health Organization advised millions of people across Latin America and the Caribbean to delay pregnancy, to avoid having babies with severe brain damage caused by the Zika virus. There is no vaccine against Zika, and efforts to slow its transmission have thus far failed. _____ 5. Politicians, rabbis and government ministers visited a Tel Aviv restaurant district to show solidarity and resolve a day after Palestinian gunmen fatally shot four Israeli civilians there. The terrorist attack, one of the most brazen in months of   Palestinian strikes, prompted Israel to impose controls on Palestinian movements. _____ 6. The San Jose Sharks thwarted Pittsburgh\u2019s plans to hoist the Stanley Cup by hanging on for a   victory on Thursday evening. The Penguins led the Sharks   going into the game, an advantage that no N. H. L. underdog has overcome since 1942. _____ 7. \u201cWarcraft,\u201d the first film to emerge from the   franchise, will be in broad release on Friday. Our reviewer credits the director, Duncan Jones (David Bowie\u2019s son) for imbuing \u201ca Hobbesian war of all against all\u201d with \u201ca little romance and campy winks. \u201d It\u2019s predictably heavy on cartoonish violence, she says: \u201cHeads pop like grapes and so forth. \u201d _____ 8. Some symptoms of   stress disorder may have a physical cause. A prominent researcher of brain injuries among military personnel says his team has identified signs of tissue damage caused specifically by explosions. \u201cWe talk about PTSD being a psychiatric problem  \u2014   how people responded to the horror of warfare,\u201d said the neuropathologist. \u201cBut at least in some cases, no  \u2014   their brain has been damaged. \u201d _____ 9. One of our   stories today offers a personal journey that illuminates New York City\u2019s history of segregation. Nikole   an investigative journalist who has covered the nation\u2019s struggle over integration, writes about how she and her husband chose to place their daughter in a segregated,   school. \u201cTrue integration, true equality,\u201d she writes, \u201crequires a surrendering of advantage, and when it comes to our own children, that can feel almost unnatural. \u201d _____ 10. A law allowing assisted suicide went into effect in California, making it the fourth and by far the largest state to allow the terminally ill to determine the timing of their death. The other three are Oregon, Washington and Vermont. Above, a California woman who has Stage 4 colon cancer and intends to ask for drugs to end her life. _____ 11. Finally, good news: Scientists appear to have made a breakthrough in capturing and storing the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. They dissolved the gas with water and pumped it into porous basalt in Iceland, where almost all of it adhered as calcite. It took a surprisingly short time, too  \u2014   just two years. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond all our expectations,\u201d said an Icelandic project manager. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.
