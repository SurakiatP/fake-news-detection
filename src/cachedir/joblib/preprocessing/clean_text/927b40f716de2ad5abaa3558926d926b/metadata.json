Asked to expand on what they meant by this, some 98% replied by screaming \u2018America\u2019 as loudly as humanly possible. \\nThe world will continue to watch on helplessly with many confirming they will not be able to sleep until they know who America feels can America America the most; Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton. \\nRegardless of the result, alcohol experts expect a huge spike in alcohol consumption when the outcome is known, with people motivated to down the nearest thing to them out of despair or relief. \\nElsewhere, an Afghan farmer has expressed no preference as to which candidate he would prefer to be in charge in three months time when he is killed by an erroneous missile strike, but conceded the whole thing would be \u2018very American\u2019.\""}, "time": 1742563977.4788146}
