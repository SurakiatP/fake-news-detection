In April, the Turkish ambassador to the EU demanded that the bloc stop funding the project which received initial support from the European Commission\u2019s Executive Agency for Education, Audiovisual and Culture. \\nOn June 2, 2016, the German parliament almost unanimously passed a symbolic resolution recognizing the 1915 massacre of Armenians by Ottoman Turkish forces as \u2018genocide.\u2019 The move was praised by Armenia and sharply criticized by Turkey, which even tried to pressure Germany ahead of the vote. \\nFollowing the move, Ankara recalled its ambassador to Germany, while Erdogan said that the government would discuss response measures. \\nThe mass killings began on April 24, 1915, when 250 Armenian intellectuals were detained by Ottoman authorities and later executed in Constantinople, present-day Istanbul. Most of the Ottoman Empire\u2019s Armenians were then displaced, deported, or placed in concentration camps on the pretext of rebelling and siding with Russia in World War I. Up to 1.5 million Armenians were affected by these measures. \\nTurkey, the successor of the Ottoman Empire, concedes that many Armenians were mistreated at the time, but maintains that the number of victims has been grossly exaggerated.'"}, "time": 1742628450.6404324}
