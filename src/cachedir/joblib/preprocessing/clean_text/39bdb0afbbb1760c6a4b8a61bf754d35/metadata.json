C. last summer. [\u201cI\u2019m not aware of that,\u201d White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer replied during a press gaggle with reporters at the White House, when asked by a reporter about the news.  Spicer added that it would be \u201chighly inappropriate\u201d to comment on the ongoing investigation into Rich\u2019s death, despite the possibility of leaked emails to Wikileaks. The Democratic National Committee also declined to comment on the investigation. \u201cWe know of no evidence that supports these allegations. We are continuing to cooperate with investigators and have no further comment,\u201d DNC spokesperson Xochitl Hinojosa said in a statement. NBC News reported that Ed Butowsky, a conservative financial advisor in Dallas, helped pay for the investigation. Butowsky denied details in the story. \u201cI didn\u2019t pay anybody. I didn\u2019t hire anybody,\u201d he said to NBC News, referring further comment to Rod Wheeler, the former Washington, D. C. homicide detective who conducted the private investigation. Wheeler revealed to Fox News that Rich was communicating with Wikileaks before his death, sparking renewed interest in the investigation. The news was confirmed by an anonymous federal investigator. Rich\u2019s family denounced the report in a statement, calling for facts in the case. \u201cWe are a family who is committed to facts, not fake evidence that surfaces every few months to fill the void and distract law enforcement and the general public from finding Seth\u2019s murderers,\u201d they said.'"}, "time": 1742628572.9991016}
