[In a post published to Medium yesterday under the title \u201cWhat\u2019s Happening With Me,\u201d Stone announced his return to the company that he helped create. \u201cI worked at Twitter for about six years. In that time, the service grew from zero people to hundreds of millions of people. Jack was the original CEO and when he returned I was very happy. \u201d wrote Stone, \u201cThere\u2019s something about the personality of a company that comes from the folks who start it. There\u2019s a special feeling they bring with them. Jack coming back was a big step forward. And now, it\u2019s my turn \u2014  I\u2019m returning to   work at Twitter starting in a couple of weeks! How this came about is kind of a crazy story but, it\u2019s happening. \u201d  Stone recounted a story of Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey asking Stone to return to the company during a company party, Stone initially was unsure that Dorsey was serious but after a short conversation following the party, agreed to come back to Twitter. \u201cWhile we were on stage, Jack asked me to come back to work at Twitter. People cheered. But I wasn\u2019t really sure if he meant it. After Tea Time, we spoke privately and Jack told me that he really did  \u2014   he wanted me to come back and work at Twitter. The company I   the service I  . I was stunned, but I knew the answer. \u201d Stone stated that his new position at the company is to guide the company culture and feeling. \u201cMy top focus will be to guide the company culture, that energy, that feeling. This is where Jack, and Twitter\u2019s inestimable CMO, Leslie Berland, feel I can have the most powerful impact. It\u2019s important that everyone understands the whole story of Twitter and each of our roles in that story. I\u2019ll shape the experience internally so it\u2019s also felt outside the company. More soon. \u201d wrote Stone. Stone continued to say, \u201cI\u2019m not replacing anyone at Twitter. Somebody mentioned I\u2019m just filling the \u201cBiz shaped hole\u201d I left. You might even say the job description includes being Biz Stone. Ev said it best when I told him about this turn of events, \u201cWell, you\u2019re among the best in the world at being Biz Stone. \u201d (I\u2019ve worked with him for fifteen years so I recognize his compliments). \u201d Stone finished his post saying \u201cTwitter has woven itself into the fabric of our global society. The world needs Twitter, and it\u2019s here to stay. I\u2019m so lucky that I get to step back in and help shape its future. \u201d Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
