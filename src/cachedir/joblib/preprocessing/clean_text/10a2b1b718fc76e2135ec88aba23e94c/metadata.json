The ones who just so happen to sit nicely within the camera frame? They are always something of a fantasy construct. If a candidate has a problem with women voters, then the podium behind will be packed tightly with women. If some number cruncher decides that Black men would rather vote for someone else, then they too get press-ganged into the formation of a human canvas. A little bit of demographic sleight of hand if you will. \\nIt\u2019s no big deal. They all do it. It\u2019s a talking point, a visual cue for the doubters and a psychological nudge for the undecided. Any Color You Want So Long As It\u2019s White \\nOf course, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has a problem with pretty much every non-white male demographic you can think of. And when it comes to Black voters, his poll numbers are so low that misrepresenting his demographic base is all but impossible. No matter how large your crowd is, a statistical zero still leaves you with a chronic shortage of Black people. And that means they cannot be used as props that detract from the massively racist campaign he\u2019s been running. Which must make him sad. \\nTime for plan B. \\nAnd no, that\u2019s not a racially insensitive name or a typo. That\u2019s his name, or at least, that\u2019s the one he is using right now. The Cultist Formerly Known As\u2026 \\nYou might have seen Michael before. Back in 2012, during the Republican primary race, Rick Santorum asked him to front his campaign rally. Attendants were treated to an excruciatingly awful jazz set , followed by rabid claims that Democrats are all closet Nazis. He told the crowd : \u201cThe Democrats, they\u2019re the worst thing that ever happened to the Black man. They\u2019re the slave masters.\u201d \\nSo, right off the bat, we know we\u2019re dealing with someone who has some legitimate political arguments to make. That\u2019s good to know. \\nThe \u201cBlacks for Trump\u201d placards that wafted in the torrid zephyr sliding past Trump\u2019s rally in Sanford, Florida last Tuesday were hard to miss. The inane grin of a middle-aged white woman, holding one of the signs at arm\u2019s length as if afraid the word \u2018black\u2019 might come and get her, was particularly memorable. \\nThe man stood next to her, wearing a T-shirt that read \u201cRepublicans Aren\u2019t Racist\u201d was less conspicuous but keen-eyed observers recognized his familiar brand of crazy from past GOP events. It was none other than our man Michael. \\nYou know, the Black Man. Trump\u2019s Cult Following \\nHe wasn\u2019t born with that name of course. Previous names include Maurice Woodside and Michael Symonette while his website lists it as Michel Nicholson. Go figure. \\nAs a former high-ranking member of the Nation of Yahweh \u2014 a violent black supremacist organization \u2014 he has good reason to keep his true name secret. The cult disintegrated in the 1980s shortly after its leader, Yahweh ben Yahweh , was arrested on conspiracy charges relating to 14 murders committed in Miami. Yahweh was convicted and eventually served 11 years of an 18-year sentence before his death in 2007. \\nMichael has had his share of legal problems too. \\nImplicated, but never convicted of two separate murders, he has since been charged with \u2014 though again, never convicted \u2014 of four separate felonies since the cult crashed and burned. \\nAnd according to the New Miami Times , Michael still cuts something of a radical figure. They describes him as being : \u201cAn anti-gay, anti-liberal preacher with a golden instinct for getting on TV at GOP events.\u201d \\nAnd just like that, all of a sudden, his support for Trump begins to make a lot of sense. \\nWatch Michael\u2019s enthusiasm for fellow nut-job Donald J.
