Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, confirmed on Tuesday that President Trump has long believed that millions of undocumented immigrants voted illegally in the 2016 election, furthering a false claim from the podium of the West Wing briefing room and refusing to rule out an investigation down the road. \u201cHe said 3 to 5 million people could have voted illegally, based on the studies that he\u2019s seen,\u201d Mr. Spicer told stunned reporters, acknowledging a statement that Mr. Trump made privately in a meeting with congressional leaders on Monday afternoon. Mr. Trump and his aides repeatedly suggested during the transition period that \u201cirregularities\u201d contributed to his   loss by nearly 3 million ballots to Hillary Clinton. Mr. Trump won the Electoral College, but his    popular vote loss to Mrs. Clinton was the largest for a winning presidential candidate since the disputed election of 1876. Democrats and some Republicans have pointed to that margin to claim that Mr. Trump is an illegitimate president. Such assertions have rankled Mr. Trump deeply. A November 2016 blog post on Infowars, the conspiracy   website run by radio host Alex Jones, posited the idea that roughly 3 million people voted illegally. Mr. Jones has hosted Mr. Trump on his radio show in the past. The assertion was based on tweets from a   voter expert, who claimed to have a study. However, there\u2019s no evidence of the study. And officials in swing states where Mr. Trump secured victory, many of which are governed by Republicans, say that there is no evidence of such fraud. Mr. Spicer also made vague reference to another Pew Research Center study that supposedly backed up Mr. Trump, but the author of the study in question, David Becker, now executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, tweeted again that no such fraud happened. When a reporter pointed out to Mr. Spicer that such widespread fraud would be one of the biggest scandals in American electoral history and asked why the administration isn\u2019t investigating, the press secretary said, \u201cMaybe we will. \u201d Mr. Spicer, who worked at the Republican National Committee before working for Mr. Trump, declined to say whether he personally believes this claim. \u201cWhat does it mean for democracy?\u201d a reporter asked about Mr. Trump\u2019s belief. \u201cIt means that I\u2019ve answered your question,\u201d Mr. Spicer said. With reports proliferating about executive branch agencies under gag orders, Mr. Spicer told reporters that the White House is \u201clooking into it,\u201d though he didn\u2019t exactly deny it. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s any surprise that when there\u2019s an administration turnover, that we\u2019re going to review the policies,\u201d he said. It started when the National Park Service retweeted crowd shots this weekend attesting to a smaller audience for President Trump\u2019s inauguration than for Barack Obama\u2019s first in 2009. That prompted a blackout, then an apology, then lots of pretty pictures. \u201cThey had inappropriately violated their own social media policies,\u201d Mr. Spicer said. \u201cThere was guidance that was put out to the department to act in compliance with the rules that were set forth. \u201d Well, looks like Badlands National Park has gone rogue. But it looks like    out there. Poor man wanna be rich. Rich man wanna be king. And a king ain\u2019t satisfied, Till he rules everything. \u201cBadlands,\u201d Bruce Springsteen Daring Mr. Trump to make good on his grand infrastructure promises, Senate Democrats on Tuesday will unveil a   plan to rebuild the nation\u2019s roads, railways, airports, waterways and sewer systems over 10 years. \u201cFrom our largest cities to our smallest towns, communities across the country are struggling to meet the challenges of aging infrastructure,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, will say. \u201cOur urban and rural communities have their own unique set of infrastructure priorities, and this proposal would provide funding to address those needed upgrades that go beyond the traditional road and bridge repair. \u201d Republicans resisted President Barack Obama\u2019s push for an infrastructure \u201csurge\u201d for eight years, arguing that the federal government couldn\u2019t afford it and that state and local governments should shoulder more responsibility for improvements. But Mr. Trump has taken up the Democratic cause. \u201cWe will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our wonderful nation,\u201d he vowed in his Inaugural Address. The plan dedicates $180 billion to rail and bus systems, $65 billion to ports, airports and waterways, $110 billion for water and sewer systems, $100 billion for energy infrastructure, and $20 billion for public and tribal lands. \u201cWe\u2019re asking President Trump to work with us to make it a reality,\u201d Mr. Schumer will say. Next up from the Trump White House news fire hose: a nominee for the Supreme Court. President Trump has invited Senators Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, as well as both the chairman and ranking Democrat of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to the White House at 3 p. m. Tuesday to discuss the nearly   vacancy on the Supreme Court. The president said a nomination would be announced next week. \u201cWe will pick a totally great Supreme Court justice,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters at the end of an event where he signed executive actions. Mr. McConnell, on the Senate floor Tuesday, said, \u201cI appreciate the president soliciting our advice on this important matter. \u201d Mr. McConnell blocked consideration of any nominee to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last February, during the final year of President Obama\u2019s term. Former intelligence officers and national security officials have formed a new national security political action committee, called 4DPac (Democracy Development Diplomacy Defense) to publish what they call   research on Mr. Trump\u2019s foreign investments. Their concern: that the president\u2019s business dealings could clash with the nation\u2019s national security interests. Their first targets: India and Turkey, with many more to come. White House aides have been trying to nudge the president to ditch his personal Twitter account and use the official @POTUS handle. After all, presidential communications are supposed to be archived and preserved under specific rules. Think Hillary Clinton\u2019s private server, not something Mr. Trump appeared to approve of during the campaign. It\u2019s not working. He started the day with: He continued with: (That one has the peculiarity of misstating the date of Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration.) And he has kept going. #MAGA! House and Senate Republicans decamp from Washington on Thursday for their annual retreat  \u2014   this time in Philadelphia. And House Speaker Paul D. Ryan made it official: President Trump will be the guest of honor. Despite a rocky start to their relationship, Walter M. Shaub Jr. the head of the Office of Government Ethics, is apparently still \u201cwilling and ready\u201d to help Mr. Trump handle his potential conflicts of interest. Mr. Shaub met with members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in a   session on Monday afternoon at the request of the chairman of the panel, Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah. After Mr. Shaub publicly criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s plans this month, Mr. Chaffetz accused him of playing politics  \u2014   prompting Democrats and other watchdogs to come to the ethics monitor\u2019s defense. According to a recap of Monday\u2019s meeting by Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the committee, Mr. Shaub said that his office had not received copies of documents that Mr. Trump referenced at a news conference on Jan. 11, and that it had been provided with no new information. Still, Mr. Shaub said he would help the president, if called upon. There were about nine members of the committee at the meeting  \u2014   eight Democrats and Mr. Chaffetz, according to his spokeswoman, M. J. Henshaw. After Mr. Chaffetz left the meeting with Mr. Shaub, he told reporters: \u201cI think we understand each other better. \u201d Big Labor may have been With Her, but the unions that represent builders and pavers Love Him. \u201cWe have a common bond with the president,\u201d said Sean McGarvey, the president of North America\u2019s Building Trades Unions, after meeting on Monday with Mr. Trump and hearing him promise a major push to rebuild the nation\u2019s infrastructure. \u201cWe come from the same industry. He understands the value of driving development, moving people to the middle class. \u201d If the labor movement divides over Mr. Trump, it would not be the first time. An old saying holds that the building trades would pave over their mothers\u2019 graves if it created jobs. And before Mr. Trump\u2019s rise, unions like the Communications Workers of America and the Service Employees International Union had split with the building unions over the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines, with the former siding with liberal environmentalists and the latter seeing opportunities for work. In this case, the unions may unite with Democrats behind the new president  \u2014   leaving Republican spending hawks in the cold. On his first working day as the country\u2019s new secretary of defense, James N. Mattis spoke with the head of NATO and told him that the United States depends on it and on Europe for   security. The telephone conversation came just a week after Mr. Mattis\u2019s boss, Mr. Trump, called NATO \u201cobsolete,\u201d because, Mr. Trump said, the alliance hasn\u2019t done enough to combat terrorism. Mr. Mattis \u201cwanted to place the call on his first full day in office to reinforce the importance he places on the alliance,\u201d a Pentagon spokesman, Capt. Jeff Davis, said in a statement on Monday night.'"}, "time": 1742563188.9768877}
