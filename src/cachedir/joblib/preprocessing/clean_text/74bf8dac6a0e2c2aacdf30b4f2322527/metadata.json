She was 50. The cause was brain cancer, her sister the anthropologist T. M. Luhrmann said. Ms. Dewdney, whom the children\u2019  journal The Horn Book once called a \u201crock star to preschoolers,\u201d introduced her most famous character in \u201cLlama Llama Red Pajama. \u201d Published in 2005, it told the rhyming story of a   llama upset when his mother delays bringing a nighttime glass of water. Mama eventually turns up and the crisis is averted. Baby llama learns that Mama will always be nearby. Parents and children loved the book. \u201cDewdney gives a wonderfully fresh twist to a familiar nighttime ritual,\u201d Booklist wrote. Booksellers loved it, too. The title flew off the shelves, as did its nearly 20 successors, which sold more than 10 million copies. Netflix plans to offer an animated version of the books next year. Anna Elizabeth Luhrmann was born on Dec. 25, 1965, and grew up in Englewood, N. J. Her father, George, was a psychiatrist her mother, the former Winifred Bruce, wrote books for young readers. Anna attended Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass. and the Putney School in Vermont before earning a bachelor\u2019s degree in art from Wesleyan University in 1987. She was a mail carrier, a waitress and a boarding school teacher before landing the assignment to illustrate \u201cThe Peppermint Race,\u201d by Dian Curtis Regan. Ms. Dewdney illustrated several more books before discovering her llama. She told The   of Newark in 2013 that the idea had come from car trips with her two daughters in the back seat she made animal sounds to them as they passed farms. \u201cI would say, \u2018Look, there are cows,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I would moo and make sheep noises and chicken noises. Our vet had a field with donkeys, and then she got a llama. And I would go \u2018  . \u2019\u201d Written in rhymes, each book starts with a simple life problem and proceeds to solve it, with lessons learned along the way. After writing and illustrating \u201cGrumpy Gloria,\u201d about a bulldog jealous of a doll, Ms. Dewdney reeled off a string of   \u201cLlama Llama\u201d books, including \u201cLlama Llama and the Bully Goat. Her most recent one, published last year, is \u201cLlama Llama Gram and Grandpa,\u201d in which Llama forgets his toys on an overnight trip. \u201cI think children are far more like animals than they are like adults,\u201d Ms. Dewdney told The Horn Book in 2013. She added: \u201cSmall children are \u2018unadulterated\u2019 beings. They experience and recognize feelings in themselves and others much like animals do, without all that other stuff on top. \u201d Ms. Dewdney also wrote the   books \u201cRoly Poly Pangolin,\u201d \u201cNobunny\u2019s Perfect\u201d and \u201cNelly Gnu and Daddy Too. \u201d Ms. Dewdney\u2019s marriage, to John Ronald Dewdney, ended in divorce. In addition to her sister Tanya Marie, she is survived by her parents another sister, Alice Laughlin her companion, Reed Duncan and two daughters, Berol and Cordelia Dewdney. She recently completed \u201cLittle Excavator,\u201d to be published in June by Viking Children\u2019s Books. \u201cA good children\u2019s book can be read by an adult to a child, and experienced genuinely by both,\u201d Ms. Dewdney told The  . \u201cA good children\u2019s book is like a performance. I don\u2019t feel my world really exists until an adult has read it to a child. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628487.3275144}
