So they leveled an attack on the presiding judge, calling him irredeemably biased and unfair. \u201cYour Honor,\u201d wrote a lawyer for Mr. Trump, \u201charbors   antagonism that would make impartial adjudication impossible. \u201d The year was 2008, and Mr. Trump\u2019s arguments closely resembled those he is now making against Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel, a federal judge in California overseeing a class action lawsuit against the defunct Trump University. Today, Mr. Trump claims that Judge Curiel, who was born in Indiana, is incapable of objectively judging the case because of his Mexican heritage and record of being, in Mr. Trump\u2019s words, \u201ca hater of Donald Trump. \u201d Between 2008 and 2010, Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers went even further  \u2014   turning angry accusations into an unusual,   legal campaign to remove not one but two New York judges who oversaw the lawsuit. One judge was an   man, the other a white woman. Taken together, the episodes highlight Mr. Trump\u2019s unusual approach to the American judiciary: Unlike most parties in court cases, who try to curry the favor of judges, he can turn publicly hostile toward them, assailing their motives, biography and fitness. Over the past 48 hours, Mr. Trump expanded his musings about courts, doubting whether a Muslim judge could fairly adjudicate a trial involving him. That earned him a rebuke from Hillary Clinton, who wondered on Monday whether Mr. Trump would soon claim \u201cthat a woman judge couldn\u2019t preside. \u201d Throughout a career that has been marked by legal proceedings that either involved or fascinated him, Mr. Trump has not always seen judges as the ultimate arbiters of legal principle, but as adversaries who deserve mockery or bulldozing when they do not agree with him. Even in cases where he is merely a spectator, Mr. Trump has plenty to say about those on the bench. The judge overseeing the 2014 trial in South Africa of Oscar Pistorius, the Olympic runner, for the murder of his girlfriend, was a \u201cmoron,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201cRidiculous decision,\u201d he said of the   sentence. Mr. Trump ridiculed a Pennsylvania judge appointed by President Jimmy Carter as \u201cnot his most brilliant appointment,\u201d and wrote that the judge was \u201ca willing accessory\u201d to any crimes of convicts she had released from prison. He does this despite his close ties to a federal judge, Maryanne Trump Barry, his sister. The New York case stands out. Mr. Trump and his lawyers singled out Justice Richard B. Lowe III, who was first elected to the New York Supreme Court in 2003. Throughout the case, which involved a Trump real estate development on the West Side of Manhattan and a partnership with Hong Kong businessmen, Justice Lowe issued orders Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers said were biased. By the end of the case, Mr. Trump\u2019s top lawyer, Jay Goldberg, apologized for seeking to oust Justice Lowe from the proceedings, promising to never level such accusations against him again. But when the litigation was going on, Mr. Goldberg forcefully challenged Justice Lowe\u2019s \u201cfitness to serve in a judicial capacity,\u201d accused him of \u201cunwarranted bias toward Trump\u201d and said that, \u201cat every turn, Justice Lowe has shown that he is unable to comply with his duties,\u201d according to a 2009 complaint Mr. Goldberg submitted to the New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct. Mr. Goldberg, a longtime lawyer for Mr. Trump, claimed that Justice Lowe had betrayed a bias against Mr. Trump on two occasions. The first, he said, was when Justice Lowe declared, in his chambers and in the presence of a lawyer for Mr. Trump, that he would not allow Mr. Trump\u2019s presence in the courtroom to intimidate him. The second, Mr. Goldberg said, was when Justice Lowe allegedly told Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York that he did not like Mr. Trump. Justice Lowe on Monday declined to comment on the case. During a 2009 hearing in which he denied Mr. Goldberg\u2019s request for his recusal, he acknowledged that he had used the word \u201cintimidate\u201d in reference to Mr. Trump, saying he was generalizing that nobody could scare him. He also defended his rulings in the case and said any allegation that he had been unfair to Mr. Trump was \u201c . \u201d He questioned whether it was \u201can effort to change the course of this litigation by trying to get before another judge. \u201d In an interview, Mr. Rangel said he had not spoken to Justice Lowe in the past 20 years and had no recollection of ever discussing Mr. Trump with the judge. Mr. Goldberg, the congressman said, \u201chas a hell of an imagination. \u201d The New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct, which oversees state and local judges in New York, took no action against Justice Lowe, a spokesman for the commission said. Steven Lubet, a Northwestern University law professor and legal ethics expert, said that filing a motion to remove a judge was \u201crarely sought and rarely granted,\u201d not just in New York but across the country. The comments allegedly made by Justice Lowe, he said, would not be grounds for such a removal. \u201cThose aren\u2019t remotely close to what would disqualify a judge,\u201d Mr. Lubet said. Neither Mr. Goldberg nor a Trump spokeswoman responded to a request for comment. As the real estate case wound its way through the legal system, morphing into a different suit with a different defendant, Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers sought the removal of a second state judge, Justice Eileen Bransten. Justice Bransten, they argued, had shown bias against Mr. Trump by calling his previous attempt to remove Justice Lowe \u201creprehensible. \u2019\u2019 They did not succeed. Soon after, Mr. Goldberg, the Trump lawyer, withdrew his request that Justice Bransten recuse herself. \u201cI consider my conduct wholly improper,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand for that I apologize, particularly to Justice Lowe, with assurances that it will never be repeated again. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563521.9284022}
