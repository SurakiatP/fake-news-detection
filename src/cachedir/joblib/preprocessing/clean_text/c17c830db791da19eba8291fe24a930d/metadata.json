By some estimates, Hillary is outspending Trump 7-to-1 in advertising \u2013 a steep hill to climb for a campaign that is already losing badly in nearly every battleground state. \\nBut in his desperation, Trump did something incredibly stupid. He promised his fans that he would \u201ctriple match\u201d any donation over $75 that they made on October 1st. \\nHis fans, believing Trump would put his money where his mouth is, gave generously. Instead of make good on the promise, Trump donated squat. In fact, his donations for the entire month were less than he should have donated that very first day. On Oct 1, I got an email from Trump pledging to triple donations for 24 hrs. \\nDonors gave $165,829 that day. \\nTrump gave $30,682 all month. \\n\u2014 Ryan Struyk (@ryanstruyk) October 28, 2016 \\nEven for Trump\u2019s diehard fans, this looks like the man is just the kind of grifter his critics have always claimed he was. Despite pretending to \u201cself-fund\u201d his campaign, Trump has chipped in hardly anything. He\u2019s run his campaign much like he ran his charity, using other people\u2019s money to promote himself. \\nThis is in stark contrast to Trump\u2019s boasts. Famously, the candidate once said he was willing to spend upwards of one billion dollars on his campaign to be president. With just 11 days to go, Trump hasn\u2019t even come close. Most estimates put his own contribution around $50 million \u2013 chump change for an alleged billionaire.

His campaign manager Kellyanne Conway scrambled to the nearest media outlet to proclaim that Trump would absolutely be fulfilling a promise he made to donate $100 million by the election. (Note again: He has just 11 days left to do so.) \\nAnd then Trump himself reportedly wired $10 million to his campaign on Friday morning in a day late, dollar short desperation maneuver to help pull out of this tailspin. Donald Trump wired $10M of his own money into this presidential campaign this morning \u2013 Dow Jones \\n\u2014 CNBC Now (@CNBCnow) October 28, 2016 \\nIt\u2019s hard to truly be surprised that Trump has been stingy with his own campaign. This is the \u201cbillionaire\u201d who managed to pay no taxes in twenty years and donate almost no money to charity in the same period. He makes Scrooge McDuck look generous. And with less than two weeks to go, Trump\u2019s chances of becoming president are looking about as fictional as the cartoon duck. \\nGo home, Donald. \\nFeatured image via Ethan Miller/Getty Images Share this Article!'"}, "time": 1742564575.8514552}
