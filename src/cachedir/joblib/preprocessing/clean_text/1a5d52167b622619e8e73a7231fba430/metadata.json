Mack spoke of his political influence, prompting the PVA journalists to schedule a meeting with Reverend Mack and a friend of his, Reverend Marion Johnson, to see what their plans were for Election Day.\\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got people to get on school buses and go to Indianapolis and the state houses and we just need you to show up,\u201d said Mack.\\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t even know what they were going down there for, all they know is the Pastor asked them,\u201d said Johnson.\\nMack and Johnson explained how they bus minority members of their community congregation to the polls and tell them how to vote.\\n\u201cThe thing is, I keep repeating this, our people getting to the polls. If we get our people to the polls they know who to vote for. It\u2019s not going to be, \u2018Oh who do I vote for?\u2019 Because we\u2019re going to tell them who to vote for,\u201d said Johnson.\\nIRS code provides that 501 (c) 3 organizations cannot \u201cParticipate in, or intervene in, any political campaign on behalf of/in opposition to any candidate for public office.\u201d Pastors and church staff should not be using church resources to engage in political campaigns.\\n\u201cMy thing is this. What I do is tell people who I am going to vote for. I say I\u2019m voting for Hillary Clinton. And that\u2019s automatically telling our congregation to vote for Hillary Clinton,\u201d said Johnson\u2026And you see all these vans rolling to the polls. With the name of the church and the pastor\u2019s name on the side. And they know that the Pastor\u2019s providing that. They know who they\u2019re voting for. They know who they\u2019re supporting,\u201d said Johnson.\\n\u201cWe have church vans\u2026 I mean literally, we can have twenty vans roll up,\u201d said Mack.\\nReverend Mack and Reverend Johnson told PVA journalists times that they were sure their community would follow their lead at the polls, as long as they had the funds. They also were hoping that the PVA journalists would connect them with a donor to fund their \u201cget out the vote\u201d efforts and they had a very specific way they wanted the donation to be made so that a paper trail wasn\u2019t left.\\n\u201cHe could possibly make the check to you. You cash the check and give cash. Or he could make the check to a particular church and then it works out as a charitable donation, because it looks like he just gave a donation to the church,\u201d said Mack.\\nIn an effort to avoid making their 501(c) 3 violation apparent, the Reverends suggested that the check be made as an anonymous charitable donation.\\nOn Election Day, PV journalists traveled to Gary, IN to see if they would be told for whom to vote.\\nPV Journalist: \u201cSo should I just vote straight ticket Democrat?\u201d\\nMack: \u201cThat would be nice\u2026you\u2019re heading to the polls and don\u2019t really have a lot of information to deal with issues\u2026that would be probably the best bet\u2026So prayerfully you\u2019ll go in and just hit straight Democratic ticket and give us the help that we need.\u201d\\nThe post Holy Voter Fraud: Reverends Caught on Cam, \u201cWe Tell Them Who To Vote For\u201d appeared first on We Are Change .\\n'"}, "time": 1742562728.6331327}
