The party\u2019s willingness to take the nation to the brink of a government shutdown signaled its intention, just weeks after its election drubbing in Rust Belt states, to quickly leverage the sorts of issues that propelled Donald J. Trump to victory. The House on Thursday passed a   spending bill that would keep the government open through late April and extend through that month health care benefits for retired miners who were set to lose them at the end of the year. But Democrats wanted those benefits to last for a year, and slowed down voting on the measure with the threat of rejecting the bill. \u201cWe never intended to shut down the government,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, the incoming minority leader, said on the Senate floor Friday evening. He added, \u201cI think we\u2019ve made our point. \u201d Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, who led the charge on behalf of the miners, said that at the very least, he and his colleagues had drawn attention to \u201cwhat coal miners have done for this country. \u201d It was unclear what Mr. Manchin and other Democrats had gained from the process. There was no legislative compromise, nor any promise of more money for miners in the future. \u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee,\u201d Mr. Manchin conceded, before suggesting that he and other Democrats may hold up legislation over the issue next year. \u201cWe\u2019re going to use every tactic we can. \u201d Mr. Manchin faces   in 2018 in a   state. Asked if he thought the fight over the miners\u2019 health care would help his chances, he said, \u201cWell, I sure don\u2019t think it hurts. \u201d On Friday morning, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, urged his Democratic colleagues to approve the spending bill, warning that without it, the miners would lose their health care at the end of the month. \u201cThis is a good time to take yes for an answer,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. He pledged to work to prevent the expiration of the miners\u2019 health care coverage next year and blamed Senate Democrats for contributing to the coal industry\u2019s plight in the first place. Late Friday, senators voted, 61 to 38, on a procedural measure to advance the spending bill, barely pulling it over the line. Many Republicans joined Democrats in rejecting it, though for various reasons. Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, waited until the 60 votes needed had been cast before voting no. Soon after, about 45 minutes before the government would have shut down, the Senate approved the spending bill, 63 to 36. Democrats\u2019 threat to shut down the government  \u2014   the sort of intransigence adopted by Republicans in the recent past  \u2014   indicates their willingness to use the few tools available to them to block legislation next year, when possible, and to bludgeon Republicans with populist issues on which they share common ground with Mr. Trump. Pressing his case on Thursday, Mr. Manchin said that senators from both parties had campaigned on giving a \u201cfair shake\u201d to working people. \u201cIt\u2019s either put up or shut up,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve asked them to vote for you because of this reason. Now you have a chance to show them that\u2019s why you\u2019re here. \u201d Mr. Manchin had furiously worked the phones on Friday to see how many senators would join him in voting against a procedural measure to advance the   spending bill. But he found that many senators, like House representatives, wanted to avoid a shutdown. Senators from coal states did want to use the threat of a shutdown to bring renewed attention to the retired miners, and set up a push for a longer extension and a more lasting solution in January. While Democrats now have the opposition party mantle that Republicans held through much of the Obama presidency, the dynamics are different. For instance, while Mr. McConnell distanced himself in the past from Republicans like Senator Ted Cruz of Texas when they sought to disrupt bills, Mr. Schumer stood with Mr. Manchin on Thursday night to call for a better deal for the miners. Mr. McConnell did not prevent the government shutdown of 2013, but in later years, he worked harder to stem disputes before they got that far. \u201cWe\u2019re going to win this fight,\u201d Mr. Schumer said on Thursday. \u201cWe can\u2019t predict the exact path, but we are going to win this fight, because we\u2019re right. \u201d The coal industry has been decimated in recent years, with a string of bankruptcies. Lawmakers from   states, as well as the United Mine Workers of America, have pushed for legislation that would protect the health care and pensions of retirees. Democrats argued that a   extension of miners\u2019 health care benefits would leave them in limbo. \u201cI\u2019ve tweeted   Trump,\u201d Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, said on Thursday, adding that the dispute over the miners\u2019 health care was an early test for Mr. Trump. \u201cIn those communities they live in, Trump often got 70 percent of the vote,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cI would think he\u2019d want to help them, but so far, he hasn\u2019t. \u201d Mr. Trump has not spoken publicly about the Senate dispute, and his transition team did not respond to requests for comment, but he voiced frequent praise for coal miners during his campaign. \u201cWe\u2019re going to put our miners back to work,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Friday night at a rally in Michigan. \u201cMiners, we love our miners. \u201d In a twist, Mr. Manchin had been scheduled to meet with Mr. Trump on Friday the meeting was postponed until Monday. In addition to the fight over the miners, Senate Democrats spoke out this week on another issue that seemed right out of Mr. Trump\u2019s playbook, pushing to write into law a permanent requirement that   steel and iron be used in water projects. Such a requirement had been removed from a water projects bill that the House approved on Thursday, and Democrats insisted, without success, that it be put back into the legislation. \u201cThe time is now for Donald Trump to take a stand in support of American workers,\u201d said Senator Tammy Baldwin, Democrat of Wisconsin. Wrapping up its work for the year, the Senate approved the water projects bill early Saturday morning. The fate of that bill was important to Michigan\u2019s senators, as was the approval of the spending bill. Together, the two measures provide funding to Flint, Mich. and other communities dealing with   drinking water.'"}, "time": 1742562960.4106233}
