Even in the U.S. presidential debates, the arguing between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton has been almost exclusively about ISIS, not Al Qaeda. \\nThough Al Qaeda got the ball rolling on America\\'s revenge wars in the Middle East 15 years ago by killing several thousand Americans and others in the 9/11 attacks, the terrorist group has faded into the background of U.S. attention, most likely because it messes up the preferred \"good guy/bad guy\" narrative regarding the Syrian war. \\nFor instance, the conflict in Aleppo between Syrian government forces and rebels operating primarily under Al Qaeda\\'s command is treated in the Western media as simply a case of the barbaric Assad and his evil Russian ally Vladimir Putin mercilessly bombing what is portrayed as the east Aleppo equivalent of Disney World, a place where innocent children and their families peacefully congregate until they are targeted for death by the Assad-Putin war-crime family. \\nThe photos sent out to the world by skillful rebel propagandists are almost always of wounded children being cared for by the \" White Helmet\" rebel civil defense corps , which has come under growing criticism for serving as a public-relations arm of Al Qaeda and other insurgents. (There also are allegations that some of the most notable images have been staged , like a fake war scene from the 1997 dark comedy, \"Wag the Dog.\") - Advertisement - \\nRare Glimpse of Truth \\nYet, occasionally, the reality of Al Qaeda\\'s importance in the rebellion breaks through, even in the mainstream U.S. media, although usually downplayed and deep inside the news pages, such as the A9 article in Saturday\\'s New York Times by Hwaida Saad and Anne Barnard describing a rebel offensive in Aleppo. It acknowledges: \\n\"The new offensive was a strong sign that rebel groups vetted by the United States were continuing their tactical alliances with groups linked to Al Qaeda, rather than distancing themselves as Russia has demanded and the Americans have urged. ... The rebels argue that they cannot afford to shun any potential allies while they are under fire, including well-armed and motivated jihadists, without more robust aid from their international backers.\" (You might note how the article subtly blames the rebel dependence on Al Qaeda on the lack of \"robust aid\" from the Obama administration and other outside countries -- even though such arms shipments violate international law.) \\nWhat the article also makes clear in a hazy kind of way is that Al Qaeda\\'s affiliate, the recently renamed Nusra Front, and its jihadist allies, such as Ahrar al-Sham, are waging the brunt of the fighting while the CIA-vetted \"moderates\" are serving in mostly support roles. The Times reported: \\n\"The insurgents have a diverse range of objectives and backers, but they issued statements of unity on Friday. Those taking part in the offensive include the Levant Conquest Front, a militant group formerly known as the Nusra Front that grew out of Al Qaeda; another hard-line Islamist faction, Ahrar al-Sham; and other rebel factions fighting Mr. Assad that have been vetted by the United States and its allies.\" - Advertisement - \\nThe article cites Charles Lister, a senior fellow and Syria specialist at the Middle East Institute in Washington, and other analysts noting that \"the vast majority of the American-vetted rebel factions in Aleppo were fighting inside the city itself and conducting significant bombardments against Syrian government troops in support of the Qaeda-affiliated fighters carrying out the brunt of front-line fighting.\" \\nLister noted that 11 of the 20 or so rebel groups conducting the Aleppo \"offensive have been vetted by the C.I.A. and have received arms from the agency, including anti-tank missiles. ... \\n\"In addition to arms provided by the United States, much of the rebels\\' weaponry comes from regional states, like Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia,\" Mr. Lister said, \"including truck-borne multiple-rocket launcher systems and Czech-made Grad rockets with extended ranges.\" \\nThe U.S./Al Qaeda Alliance'"}, "time": 1742564488.135061}
