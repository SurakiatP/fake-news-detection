Play board games with your siblings. Pick up a favorite book to read or be read to. Run around and be as active as you can.\u201d \\nOfficials claim that giving young kids homework doesn\u2019t help their test scores at all \u2026 \\nWhy ban homework? A team of teachers at Cherry Park Elementary in the David Douglas school district in East Portland dug into the research and found that, while high school students learn more when they do homework, for elementary pupils, there is little to no evidence homework does any good. \\nBut further down, we discover the true motive behind their homework ban: Racism . \\nPrincipal Kate Barker says assigning regular homework isn\u2019t a fabulous idea at any elementary school, but especially not at Cherry Park, where at least 75 percent of students live at or below the poverty line and families speak more than 30 different languages. \\n\u201cWe find that homework really increases that inequity,\u201d Barker said. \u201cIt provides a barrier to our students who need the most support.\u201d \\nThat\u2019s right. They\u2019re not saying homework doesn\u2019t help. What they\u2019re saying \u2013 and trust me, I\u2019m a teacher \u2013 is that homework doesn\u2019t help poor people (they mean minorities) and that if it doesn\u2019t help poor people, then nobody should do it. \\nThe truth is that lower-income families have less time to spend with their children \u2013 making sure they do their homework, helping them with it. So fewer of the lower-income, minority kids do it. \\nSo rather than find a way to get these parents to spend more time helping their kids, they\u2019re giving up and just banning homework altogether. \\nBarker says the school will carefully monitor if students are making enough academic progress and will tweak things if they are not. But making better use of the school day, not assigning homework, will be the strategy if change is needed, she said. \\nTeachers got on board with the no-homework policy once the rationale was explained, Barker said. Parents have been 100 percent in favor of the change. \\nAnd the students? They, she said, \u201care cheering.\u201d \\nAnd that\u2019s why our school system is failing. \\nKeeping Portland weird. Weird and stupid.'"}, "time": 1742628415.4752133}
