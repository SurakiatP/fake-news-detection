The FBI director said then: \u201cAlthough there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes \u2026 our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.\u201d \\nThe controversy over Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while at the state department has loomed over her candidacy since before she even announced her intent to seek the White House in April. \\nThe Clinton campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
