Clinton avoided blaming herself for the loss, for which Krauthammer called \u201cchildish\u201d and \u201cpathetic. \u201d \u201cLook, I know I\u2019m in a minority with conservatives, but I actually feel sorry for her,\u201d Krauthammer said. \u201cI have a soft spot. It could be because I was in my youth a liberal. I retain the marshmallow deep inside of my heart that I try not to betray these days. But it\u2019s a pathetic performance. It\u2019s sort of childish. She can\u2019t accept responsibility. She has practiced at this where she says  \u2014   I love in one of her riffs she says was a perfect candidate? No. Did I make mistakes? Yes. These are rhetorical devices, whoever said she was a perfect candidate? She was a terrible candidate. She was the worst of imaginable. I mean just look at the fact she couldn\u2019t shake the challenge of a    socialist, who, this is the best part about Bernie Sanders, honeymooned in the Soviet Union. She couldn\u2019t shake his challenge for six months. \u201d \u201cBy the way, Lindsey Graham once said about Bernie and the Soviet Union, yes, and he never left,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat was her challenge, and she had the DNC behind her. She complained about the DNC being against her. It\u2019s not delusional. Losing an election, losing something you\u2019ve been after for eight years probably 16 years is pretty hard. And I think her handlers are somebody who cares for her should have said don\u2019t go out there. You wait a few more years, people will mellow to you. They want to remember details. Maybe they will have some affection for you. Michael Dukakis, Walter Mondale  \u2014   these are people who didn\u2019t elicit the same kind of antipathy she does because they didn\u2019t wallow in  . \u201d Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor'"}, "time": 1742562728.9282837}
