Diabetes Kidney Stones \u201cSimilarly, patients with diagnoses of depression, epilepsy, diabetes mellitus, tremor, Parkinsonism, arrhythmias, circulatory disturbances (stroke, cardiac infarction, arteriosclerosis), hypertension, migraine, cluster headache, cramps, neuro-vegetative disorders, abdominal pain, osteoporosis, asthma, stress dependent disorders, tinnitus, ataxia, confusion, preeclampsia, weakness, might also be consequences of the magnesium deficiency syndrome.\u201d \u2013 Journal of the American College of Nutrition \\nAmazingly, the article referenced above even mentions neuro-vegetative disorders as a possible result of magnesium deficiency. This would include comas. Stress hormone production requires high levels of magnesium and stressful experiences can immediately lead to complete depletion of magnesium stores; could this be a contributing factor to why we see comas after traumatic accidents/injuries? As I mentioned above, magnesium is an electrolyte responsible for brain signals and conductivity. Without magnesium, people in comas may not be able to come to and resume conductivity. Many people with diabetes also fall into diabetic comas. Diabetes is listed as another possible consequence of magnesium deficiency. Could this be a factor in diabetic comas as well? Something to think about and research further! \\nCravings \\nDo you crave chocolate? Why, when people are stressed out, do they go for chocolate? Chocolate is one of the highest food sources of magnesium. \\nMagnesium is associated with so many disorders that Dr. Carolyn Dean of the Nutritional Magnesium Association has devoted an entire book to discussing how she has treated thousands of patients for a wide array of diseases, with magnesium as the primary component. Her book, The Magnesium Miracle, is a must-read if you have any of the magnesium deficiency symptoms above, or any health problems in general \u2013 as there is likely a magnesium component to everything. Check out 50 Studies Suggest That Magnesium Deficiency Is Killing Us . \\nWhy Don\u2019t Doctors Find Magnesium Deficiencies In Tests? \\nUnfortunately, conventional medicine has not woken up to the amount of research that has been done on magnesium deficiency. \\nOne of the reasons Western Medicine is so off base with magnesium is how they test it: with blood tests. \\nBlood tests do not yield ANY information about magnesium \u2026 why? Because the body controls the levels of blood magnesium very tightly. If the magnesium in the blood drops just a little bit, you\u2019re going to have a heart attack. It\u2019s that sample. So to prevent this, the body will rob all of its cells, tissues, and bones of magnesium in order to keep the blood levels constant. If you do a blood test for magnesium, the cells could be completely empty while your blood levels remain constant. \\nWhat\u2019s worse is that magnesium is not even in your blood. 99% of the magnesium in the body is stored in the cells that get robbed, while a mere 1% of your body\u2019s total magnesium is in the blood. These tests are a complete waste of time, and they\u2019re not educating doctors to this reality. \\n\u201cA serum test for magnesium is actually worse than ineffective, because a test result that is within normal limits lends a false sense of security about the status of the mineral in the body. It also explains why doctors don\u2019t recognize magnesium deficiency; they assume serum magnesium levels are an accurate measure of all the magnesium in the body.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Carolyn Dean, The Magnesium Miracle. \\nWhy Are We So Deficient? \\nHere\u2019s the short(ish) version: Number one , we\u2019re being poisoned by our food. Number two , we\u2019re increasingly stressed out. We\u2019re running our engines on high to keep up with life and it\u2019s draining us. Stress hormone production requires high levels of magnesium and stressful experiences lead to depletion of magnesium stores. Number three , we\u2019re eating more sugar than ever. For every molecule of sugar we consume, our bodies use 54 molecules of magnesium to process it. Fourth , low levels in the soil and modern farming techniques deplete stores of magnesium. And lastly, magnesium is depleted by many pharmaceutical drugs and estrogen compounds such as oral contraceptives, antibiotics, cortisone, prednisone, and blood pressure medications (\u201cDrug-induced nutrient depletion handbook,\u201d Pelton, 2001). Diuretics in coffee and tea (caffeine) also raise excretion levels. Oh and by the way \u2013 flouride competes for absorption with magnesium! \\nNowadays, nearly everyone is magnesium deficient \u2013 no test needed. Refined/processed foods are stripped of their mineral, vitamin, and fiber content. These are anti-nutrient foods because they actually steal magnesium in order to be metabolized. When consumed, they demand that we supplement with magnesium or we are destined to break down eventually due to severe deficiency. Like I said, sugar is the worst offender. Every single molecule of sugar you consume drags over 50 times the amount of magnesium out of your body. \\nWell, what if you eat a healthy diet? Processed products are not the only foods that are devoid of magnesium. In general, magnesium has been depleted from topsoil, diminishing dietary intake across the board while our need for magnesium has increased, due to the high levels of toxic exposure we come across in our daily lives (air, water, plastics, chemicals, the list goes on!). The soil is depleted of magnesium because of the pesticides that are sprayed on all conventionally grown plants and worldwide pollution that affects even the cleanest fields. Pesticides also kill those beneficial bacteria/fungi that are necessary in order for plants to convert soil nutrients into plant nutrients usable by humans. \\nAre You A Cannabis User? \\nCannabis has so many positive effects in terms of treating diseases such as epilepsy, cancer, and more (read 1 , 2 , 3 and cureyourowncancer.org ). Trust me, I\u2019ll be the first to tell you I\u2019m all for it \u2013 it\u2019s a safe and effective herb with countless therapeutic benefits that the government has been hiding for years. The only way they want you using it is if they\u2019ve patented one of its\u2019 chemical compounds and can sell it to you for a profit. \\nHowever, we should also look at what happens to our body on a cellular level if we use cannabis on a daily basis. Would you take parasite cleansing herbs every day for the rest of your life, or even every few days? Probably not. You\u2019d take them when you\u2019re sick or during a monthly cleanse, or else you\u2019d develop some side effects from overuse. We need to remember that cannabis is a powerful herbal medicine and should be treated in such a way. \\nIt turns out that using marijuana tends to deplete the body\u2019s stores of magnesium, with the result that the person feels more on-edge after coming down from the high. \\nOf course, that doesn\u2019t mean that it isn\u2019t safe in moderation. It means that over time, if used consistently without proper balance via magnesium replenishment, it can and will cause magnesium deficiency. \\nThe Best Ways To Get Magnesium \\n1. Eat magnesium rich foods grown on organic soil. \\n2. Take ionic magnesium drops. This is my new favorite method, which I\u2019ve learned from The Magnesium Miracle. \\n3. Apply magnesium oil to your skin! This is the second best way to raise your levels. \\n4. Soak in epsom salt baths. This will provide not only magnesium, but sulfur for your liver as well. \\nAdditional References (not linked in the article) \\nOxford Journals \u2013 Magnesium Basics: http://ckj.oxfordjournals.org/content/5/Suppl_1/i3.full \\nDr. Carolyn Dean, MD: http://drcarolyndean.com/magnesium_miracle/'"}, "time": 1742628313.0575376}
