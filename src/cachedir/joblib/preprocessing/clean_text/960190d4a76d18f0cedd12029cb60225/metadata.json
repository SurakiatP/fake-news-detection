[From the Hollywood Reporter:  \u201cDid you enjoy that?\u201d asks Jeff Zucker as he walks into his   office at CNN\u2019s Manhattan headquarters. By that, Zucker means President Donald Trump\u2019s chaotic   press conference Feb. 16 from the East Room of the White House, which had just finished up. In addition to claiming that his administration is running like a \u201c  machine\u201d despite   scandals and dustups, the president continued his assault on the news media that, a week later, would result in CNN and others being banned from a daily briefing. \u201cI watch CNN,\u201d said Trump. \u201cThe tone is such hatred. \u201d Zucker, whose network has thrived of late despite (or, more likely, in part because of) its status as presidential punching bag, seems to have enjoyed that. By the time I join Zucker in his modest office, Jake Tapper and Wolf Blitzer are offering a recap from the anchor desk in Washington. We watch it on the largest of the 11 screens mounted on the wall opposite Zucker\u2019s desk. \u201cIt was unhinged it was wild,\u201d says Tapper. Then CNN contributor and Trump loyalist Jeffrey Lord appears via Skype to offer a counter from Trump land. \u201cI\u2019ve been listening to you, and I think we saw two different press conferences,\u201d says Lord. \u201cHe was relaxed, he was funny, he was on point. \u201d   \u2026     Zucker, known throughout the industry as a masterful poacher of talent, has been relentless in his search for original voices to augment the success of Bourdain and others. In the fall, in the heat of the presidential campaign, he hired away BuzzFeed\u2019s entire   KFile team, which had broken several major stories, including Trump\u2019s appearance in a   Playboy video. In January, that team had the scoop on former Fox News personality Monica Crowley\u2019s brushes with plagiarism, which torpedoed her nomination to a top National Security Council post. Another recent addition is comedian and social commentator W. Kamau Bell, whose show United Shades of America premiered last spring on CNN (the debut episode had Bell interviewing hooded KKK members). Bell, who will launch a new series on the Great Big Story platform this summer, notes that while Trump may dismiss the network as fake news, the standards and practices apparatus at CNN holds even his show to a high bar: \u201cWe can\u2019t just say random facts. They\u2019re like, \u2018Where did you get that from?\u2019 So the pressure to make things smarter is always a good pressure, and I\u2019ll take care of the making things funnier part. \u201d   \u2026     Read the full story at the Hollywood Reporter.'"}, "time": 1742562092.456256}
