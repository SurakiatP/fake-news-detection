[Baldwin writes in his new book, Nevertheless, that he didn\u2019t realize Reed was underaged until the end of filming. \u201cWhen I found out, just as we finished, that she was 17, I flipped out on the producers, who had told me something different,\u201d he writes.  Brunettti fired back at Baldwin on Twitter Tuesday, confirming that the actor \u201cknew Reed was 16, didn\u2019t find out AFTER filming, and did not yell at us. \u201d Brunettti  \u2014   who has since produced the Twilight and 50 Shades of Grey film franchises  \u2014   further refuted Baldwin\u2019s claims in a interview published Wednesday morning with the Hollywood Reporter. \u201cOf course he totally knew how old she was,\u201d Brunetti told THR. \u201cThat\u2019s why there\u2019s no nudity in the movie. He knew before we even cast the movie. I think he\u2019s been method acting Trump too much and he doesn\u2019t know difference between fake news anymore. \u201d By Wednesday night, the Hollywood   were trading personal insults in what has descended into a very public,   social media war of words. A lengthy Twitter battle broke out between Baldwin and Brunetti, with both stars threatening to bury the other. @TatianaSiegel27 @DanaBrunetti @NickGuthe @NikkiReed_I_Am And Hollywood producers like Brunetti never do anything shady or unethical?  \u2014   ABFoundation (@ABFalecbaldwin) April 5, 2017,  @ABFalecbaldwin @TatianaSiegel27 @NickGuthe @NikkiReed_I_Am Name something I\u2019ve done shady or unethical, Alec. You lied, face it, admit it and move on. I\u2019m not afraid of bullies like you.  \u2014   Dana Brunetti (@DanaBrunetti) April 5, 2017,  Baldwin challenged Brunetti to release SAG paperwork required when shooting physical scenes with minors. @DanaBrunetti @TatianaSiegel27 @NickGuthe @NikkiReed_I_Am SAG rules require releases for scenes involving physical contact with minors. I take you have a copy of that?  \u2014   ABFoundation (@ABFalecbaldwin) April 5, 2017,  @ABFalecbaldwin @TatianaSiegel27 @NickGuthe @NikkiReed_I_Am If required, I\u2019m sure there is one. But really, are you going to continue to deny that you didn\u2019t know she was 16?? I\u2019ll bury you.  \u2014   Dana Brunetti (@DanaBrunetti) April 5, 2017,  Baldwin continued to insist that he was unaware of Reed\u2019s age until the end of filming. Brunetti asked Mini\u2019s First Time producer Evan Astrowsky and director Nick Guthe to weigh in. @DanaBrunetti @TatianaSiegel27 @NickGuthe @NikkiReed_I_Am I was told she was 16 by her hairdresser. At the end of the shoot. You\u2019re already buried.  \u2014   ABFoundation (@ABFalecbaldwin) April 5, 2017,  @ABFalecbaldwin @TatianaSiegel27 @NickGuthe @NikkiReed_I_Am You\u2019re a fool.

To which Brunetti responded in kind. @DanaBrunetti @TatianaSiegel27 @NickGuthe @NikkiReed_I_Am Look at it as good publicity for that stunning work of yours on 50 SHADES OF GRAY,  \u2014   ABFoundation (@ABFalecbaldwin) April 5, 2017,  @ABFalecbaldwin @TatianaSiegel27 @NickGuthe @NikkiReed_I_Am Look at it as good publicity for your book of lies that you have already admitted wasn\u2019t properly vetted.  \u2014   Dana Brunetti (@DanaBrunetti) April 5, 2017,  The battle devolved further into   and the two stars trading attacks involving their personal and professional lives.
