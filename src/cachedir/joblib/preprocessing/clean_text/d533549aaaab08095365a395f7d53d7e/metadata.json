The offensive is said to start \u201cwithin a few days or hours.\u201d \\nThe involvement of Shi\u2019ite militias in the \u201cliberation\u201d of Sunni Arab cities in Iraq has been controversial because they often end up carrying out extrajudicial executions, looting and torture of locals they suspect of being secretly in league with ISIS. \\nAn effort to block flight from Mosul to ISIS territory is Syria would be an obvious step, but the militias\u2019 involvement again risks targeting of civilians, as the population of from Mosul is already overrunning the minimal camps set up for the displaced. \\nCivilians fleeing these cities are usually not welcomed in Iraqi government-held territory, and wind up fleeing into other ISIS-held territory. With little left in Iraq, this likely means fleeing into Syria, and the militias\u2019 presence means the civilians displaced by the attack are likely to be targeted for fleeing \u201cwith\u201d ISIS.
