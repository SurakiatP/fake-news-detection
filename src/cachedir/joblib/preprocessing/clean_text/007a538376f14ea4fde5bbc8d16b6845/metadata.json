[The controversial nonprofit is teaming with Black Box Management to produce a   documentary series that will explore \u201cthe normalization of American   extremism in the age of Donald Trump,\u201d according to a statement provided to the Hollywood Reporter.  Black Box   and producer Mike Dill told THR that his Los   company plans to start shopping the   project to potential cable and streaming outlets as early as June. The SPLC has come under intense scrutiny in recent years for what has been perceived as electioneering, which is illegal for the 501( c)(3)   organization. \u201cTo vindicate itself as a fair and balanced agency, the IRS must strip the SPLC of its privileged   status,\u201d Dale Wilcox, the Immigration Law Reform Institute\u2019s general counsel, told Breitbart News last month. \u201cTheir attacks on the President during his campaign were some of the most egregious I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d he said, adding that \u201choarding over $300 million in donor contributions, the group can afford to pay taxes anyway. \u201d Last year, the SPLC described the deadly assault on Orlando\u2019s Pulse nightclub that left 49 people dead, and the Black Lives   murders of police officers in Baton Rouge and Dallas, as \u201c  terrorist plots. \u201d Dill is also developing a series, along with WGN America, called Fast Boys, about the   War II rise of the American   industry. The drama series was   before WGN America\u2019s recent announcement that the network\u2019s potential buyout by Sinclair Broadcast Group could mean a major shift away from original series. \u201cThe ratings WGN America (delivers) doesn\u2019t justify the type of spending they do on the original programming side,\u201d Sinclair Broadcast Group CEO Chris Ripley told Wall Street investors Monday, Variety reports. \u201cThe channel could be run much more profitably on a fraction of what they spend on programming. \u201d However, a spokesperson for WGN told THR that the billion dollar deal between Sinclair and WGN America won\u2019t affect Fast Boys. \u201cBoth Fast Boys and the SPLC project tell the stories of those who don\u2019t accept the limitations that others try to place upon them,\u201d Black Box   Lowell Shapiro said in a statement. \u201cThe subjects see an opportunity to create change and evolve beyond the status quo. \u201d     Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson'"}, "time": 1742563360.535297}
