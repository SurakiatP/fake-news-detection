That person is deputy director of the FBI. Andrew McCabe. \\nSubmitted by Michael Krieger : \\nA theme I\u2019ve been focused on for the past several weeks, relates to the growing anger from within the ranks of current and former FBI agents over the agency\u2019s questionable and shady investigation into the email practices of Hillary Clinton. For example, in last week\u2019s post, Internal Anger at the FBI Over Clinton Investigation Continues to Grow , I noted: \\n\u201cThis is a textbook case where a grand jury should have convened but was not. That is appalling,\u201d an FBI special agent who has worked public corruption and criminal cases said of the decision. \u201cWe talk about it in the office and don\u2019t know how Comey can keep going.\u201d \\nDiGenova told WMAL radio\u2019s Drive at Five last week, \u201cPeople are starting to talk. They\u2019re calling their former friends outside the bureau asking for help. We were asked to day to provide legal representation to people inside the bureau and agreed to do so and to former agents who want to come forward and talk. Comey thought this was going to go away.\u201d \\nHe explained, \u201cIt\u2019s not. People inside the bureau are furious. They are embarrassed. They feel like they are being led by a hack but more than that that they think he\u2019s a crook. They think he\u2019s fundamentally dishonest. They have no confidence in him. The bureau inside right now is a mess.\u201d \\nHe added, \u201cThe most important thing of all is that the agents have decided that they are going to talk.\u201d \\nWhile most people are rightly focused on FBI head James Comey, there\u2019s another person who needs to be investigated far more closely due to his ties to cash from long-time Clinton ally and Virginia Governor, Terry McAuliffe. That person is deputy director of the FBI. Andrew McCabe. \\nThe Wall Street Journal reports: \\nThe political organization of Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, an influential Democrat with longstanding ties to Bill and Hillary Clinton, gave nearly $500,000 to the election campaign of the wife of an official at the Federal Bureau of Investigation who later helped oversee the investigation into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email use. \\nCampaign finance records show Mr. McAuliffe\u2019s political-action committee donated $467,500 to the 2015 state Senate campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe, who is married to Andrew McCabe, now the deputy director of the FBI. \\nThe Virginia Democratic Party, over which Mr. McAuliffe exerts considerable control, donated an additional $207,788 worth of support to Dr. McCabe\u2019s campaign in the form of mailers, according to the records. That adds up to slightly more than $675,000 to her candidacy from entities either directly under Mr. McAuliffe\u2019s control or strongly influenced by him. The figure represents more than a third of all the campaign funds Dr. McCabe raised in the effort. \\nThe FBI said in a statement that during his wife\u2019s campaign Mr. McCabe \u201cplayed no role, attended no events, and did not participate in fundraising or support of any kind. Months after the completion of her campaign, then-Associate Deputy Director McCabe was promoted to Deputy, where, in that position, he assumed for the first time, an oversight role in the investigation into Secretary Clinton\u2019s emails.\u201d \\nFBI officials said that after that meeting with the governor in Richmond on March 7, Mr. McCabe sought ethics advice from the bureau and followed it, avoiding involvement with public corruption cases in Virginia, and avoiding any campaign activity or events. \\nMr. McCabe\u2019s supervision of the Clinton email case in 2016 wasn\u2019t seen as a conflict or an ethics issue because his wife\u2019s campaign was over by then and Mr. McAuliffe wasn\u2019t part of the email probe, officials said. \\nMr. McAuliffe has been a central figure in the Clintons\u2019 political careers for decades. In the 1990s, he was Bill Clinton\u2019s chief fundraiser and he remains one of the couple\u2019s closest allies and public boosters. Mrs. Clinton appeared with him in northern Virginia in 2015 as he sought to increase the number of Democrats in the state legislature. \\nIndeed, McAuliffe is also the guy who made it clear over the summer that Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cprivate position\u201d on the TPP was to support it. This was discussed in July\u2019s post: Nobody Knows Who\u2019s Paying for the Privately Funded Democratic National Convention . \\nDr. McCabe announced her candidacy in March 2015, the same month it was revealed that Mrs. Clinton had used a private server as secretary of state to send and receive government emails, a disclosure that prompted the FBI investigation. \\nAt the time the investigation was launched in July 2015, Mr. McCabe was running the FBI\u2019s Washington, D.C., field office, which provided personnel and resources to the Clinton email probe. \\nAt the end of July 2015, Mr. McCabe was promoted to FBI headquarters and assumed the No. 3 position at the agency. In February 2016, he became FBI Director James Comey\u2019s second-in-command. \\nAs deputy director, Mr. McCabe was part of the executive leadership team overseeing the Clinton email investigation, though FBI officials say any final decisions on that probe were made by Mr. Comey, who served as a high-ranking Justice Department official in the administration of George W. Bush. \\nMr. McAuliffe has been under investigation for months by the FBI\u2019s Washington field office, a probe that includes an examination of donations made on behalf of a Chinese businessman, according to people familiar with the matter. His lawyers have denied any wrongdoing and said the investigation is seeking to determine if Mr. McAuliffe may have violated a law requiring people to register as agents of a foreign entity. \\nJust further evidence that the U.S. has been transformed into little more than a glorified Banana Republic.
