But he recently reappeared in the public eye, showing up at an exhibition of furniture designed by Rick Owens, at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles last week, and at Trump Tower on Tuesday morning, to meet with the  . In both cases, the rapper looked like his normal self, wearing white   sneakers, a sweatshirts and his usual  . One seemingly small change: He was blond. Speculation about the new look has already spawned a hashtag: #blondye (Ye is Mr. West\u2019s nickname). The most popular theory by far centered on Mr. West\u2019s recent emotional turmoil. \u201cWhenever someone comes in and suddenly wants a major color change out of nowhere, it usually means something is up,\u201d said Laurie Daniel, a colorist at the Marie Robinson Salon in New York. \u201cA divorce, a breakup, a crisis of some sort. \u201d Cases in point: Lindsay Lohan\u2019s conversion to a brunette in early 2008, after a year of arrests and stints in rehab Britney Spears\u2019s bald head, reportedly shaved by the pop star herself amid her divorce from Kevin Federline in 2007 and a custody battle Joe Jonas\u2019s   spikes after his breakup from Gigi Hadid and Gwen Stefani\u2019s   bob, which came a month after the announcement of her divorce from Gavin Rossdale, her husband of 13 years. Ms. Daniel typically tries to steer clients away from radical hair alterations like these if they are a way of managing distress. \u201cAs professionals, most of us try to talk people out of doing such a drastic thing, because it\u2019s coming from a place of helplessness and not being able to change other aspects of your life,\u201d she said. \u201cInevitably, they want to go back the same color they had before. \u201d Donna Rockwell, a clinical psychologist who has done research into fame and celebrity, took a more positive view of Mr. West\u2019s light locks, however, comparing the change to Megyn Kelly\u2019s decision to cut her hair short this year, which the anchor attributed to \u201ca stronger mood,\u201d or to Sia\u2019s use of wigs to shield her face, a method that the singer said created a sense of mystery and gave her a modicum of privacy. \u201cChanging our look can be very empowering to us,\u201d Dr. Rockwell said. \u201cFor Megyn Kelly, it wasn\u2019t so much a style issue as about empowerment. And for Sia, it\u2019s almost as a political statement: \u2018You will see me when I deem so. \u2019\u201d She noted that hair, as a physical feature, has a special role that can be traced back as far as biblical times. \u201cYou have Samson,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was this big, burly fellow, but his strength was in his hair. He lost his power when his hair got cut. Hair is how we define our strength, prowess, identity. \u201d She concluded that for Mr. West, as for other celebrities, a hair transformation tells the public that despite the scrutiny and the competing narratives being told by onlookers, he is still in charge of his own life. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of taking control back,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s him saying, \u2018This might be going on in the media and in the greater public opinion of me, but I have control and I will do what I want. \u2019\u201d Other hypotheses regarding the blond top focused less on Mr. West\u2019s mental state and more on his history. They included the suggestion that he\u2019s taking a cue from his wife  \u2014   Kim Kardashian West regularly changes from brunette to blond  \u2014   or showing support for the musician Frank Ocean, whose album \u201cBlonde,\u201d released this year, wasn\u2019t nominated for any Grammys. Mr. West was a writer of one of the songs on the album, according to liner notes. In October, Mr. West threatened that he wouldn\u2019t show up to the Grammy Awards if \u201cBlonde\u201d weren\u2019t nominated. (Granted, neither Mr. Ocean nor his label or representatives submitted the album for consideration.) Perhaps he decided to take a stance now that the lists of nominees have officially been released. Of course, it\u2019s possible everyone is overthinking the matter, and Mr. West just felt like changing things up. That\u2019s the view the musician Pharrell took during an interview on the radio station Hot 97 last week. \u201cI think he\u2019s an artist,\u201d he said. \u201cI think as people we have to be able to express ourselves. No matter where we are or what we are doing. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563524.44161}
