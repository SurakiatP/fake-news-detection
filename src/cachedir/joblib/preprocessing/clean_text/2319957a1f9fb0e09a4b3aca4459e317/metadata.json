Its press agent journalism for Hillary turned itself into a laughing stock \u2013 disgracefully supporting a war criminal/racketeer/perjurer, the most recklessly dangerous presidential aspirant in US history, her elevation to the nation\u2019s highest office risking nuclear war. \\nCalling the Republican party \u201csick\u201d ignores America\u2019s deplorable political process too debauched to fix \u2013 money controlled fantasy democracy, voters having no say over who governs. \\n\u201cIf Mr. Trump is rejected on Tuesday, the nation will have a momentary breather,\u201d Times editors blustered, adding \u201c(a)nd some good news to build on\u2026(a)nd the electorate will have demonstrated its decency.\u201d \\nIt\u2019s hard imagining anyone swallowing this rubbish. Whoever emerges triumphant on November 8, ordinary people lose \u2013 with an important difference between Trump and Hillary. \\nHer empowerment as commander-in-chief of America\u2019s military risks unthinkable nuclear war. At least with Trump, we\u2019re likely to avoid a potential catastrophe able to end life on earth \u2013 what Times editors won\u2019t ever explain, shamelessly supporting a war goddess lunatic endangering everyone. \\nStephen Lendman lives in Chicago.
