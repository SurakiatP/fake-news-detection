That is the kind of anticipation that surrounds the artist Damien Hirst\u2019s first new body of work in several years, to be unveiled in Venice on April 9, a month before the Biennale there. The show, billed as \u201c10 years in the making,\u201d is also the first time the Pinault Collection\u2019s two locations  \u2014   the Palazzo Grassi and the Punta della Dogana  \u2014   will be dedicated to a single artist. Like previous Hirst extravaganzas, this project is being rolled out with the same hypervigilant level of control and fanfare. And hovering over the project is whether  \u2014   given the precipitous drop in his prices after his   Sotheby\u2019s auction in 2008  \u2014   the celebrity artist can have another chapter. Has the   darling of the \u201990s  \u2014   who led the   Young British Artists, or Y. B. A. s, and was known for his $12 million shark in a tank  \u2014   jumped the shark? And given that many buyers were left bitterly holding the bag after Mr. Hirst flooded the market with his work at the Sotheby\u2019s sale, doing an end run around his dealers, will collectors give him another chance? \u201cHe\u2019s certainly confounded the market before. It depends on how successful the work is,\u201d said Marc Porter, a chairman of Sotheby\u2019s fine art division. \u201cHe\u2019s taking on Venice and that\u2019s audacious. \u201d The project, \u201cTreasures From the Wreck of the Unbelievable,\u201d according to those who have glimpsed it, resembles jeweled buried treasure covered with coral as if just pulled out of the ocean, like relics from the lost city of Atlantis or Captain Nemo. It includes some 250 pieces in various sizes ranging in price from about $400, 000 for small jade objects to $4 million for a malachite head of Medusa. Potential buyers cannot view the work in person, nor can they receive images by email, a courtesy typically afforded top collectors. Instead, a representative from one of Mr. Hirst\u2019s two galleries  \u2014   Gagosian in New York and White Cube in London  \u2014   visits with an iPad to flip through photographs of the work. Mr. Hirst declined to comment, as did his dealers, Larry Gagosian and Jay Jopling of White Cube, who said all news media requests had to go through Mr. Hirst\u2019s studio, Science UK Limited. The Pinault Collection\u2019s owner, Fran\u00e7ois Pinault, also refused to be interviewed his museum has posted just a couple of tantalizing photographs of Mr. Hirst\u2019s coming show on its website. The Venice show is the third prong of Mr. Hirst\u2019s apparent stab at a second act. The first was his opening of the Newport Street Gallery in south London in October 2015, which presents exhibitions of work from his collection. Then in April Mr. Hirst, 51, announced that he was returning to the   Gagosian gallery, having left it in 2012. Already his market is showing signs of strengthening. One of his large butterfly canvases sold at Christie\u2019s in November for a respectable $1 million, given the estimate of $900, 000 to $1. 2 million. Just about everyone in the art world agrees that Mr. Hirst has some healing to do. While he pulled off the unthinkable by selling $200 million of his work at the Sotheby\u2019s sale on Sept. 15, 2008  \u2014   bypassing the usual gallery channels and on the same infamous day that Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy  \u2014   the result was a surfeit of Hirst pieces on the market, which hurt his prices. \u201cIn many ways that auction marked the beginning of the end,\u201d said the dealer Helly Nahmad. Where his pill cabinet \u201cLullaby Spring\u201d sold at Sotheby\u2019s in 2007 for $19. 2 million, for example, his pill cabinet \u201cLullaby Winter\u201d sold at Christie\u2019s in 2015 for $4. 6 million. More recently, one of his spot paintings sold in Sotheby\u2019s contemporary art day sale in November for just $396, 500, considerably lower than the $1. 7 million they sometimes fetched in 2013. \u201cPeople inexplicably bought into that sale, precipitating a downward market death spiral that took us all down with them,\u201d said Adam Lindemann, the collector and dealer, referring to Mr. Hirst\u2019s   Sotheby\u2019s auction. \u201cHis market collapsed and hasn\u2019t really revived since. \u201cAnd now he\u2019s back like Arnold,\u201d Mr. Lindemann continued, referring to a line from Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s \u201cTerminator\u201d films. \u201cRemember the old saying, \u2018Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. \u2019\u201d Because Mr. Hirst is so prolific, there is the growing sense that his works are ubiquitous, an impression that would be countered, collectors say, by a catalogue raisonn\u00e9 that offered a full accounting of his work. \u201cAs an investor, which I am, before undertaking such an investment you have to really make sure that the production is somewhat under control,\u201d Mr. Nahmad said. \u201cThe market doesn\u2019t like chaos and the market doesn\u2019t like confusion. If Damien Hirst came out with an extensive catalogue raisonn\u00e9, people could see an order to his body of work. How many units exist? How many butterflies? How many spot paintings?\u201d At the same time, art experts say, Mr. Hirst is the real deal  \u2014   not just a flash in the pan or a relic of the past, but an artist with exceptional talent and staying power. True, he had the temerity to charge $100 million for a diamond encrusted skull in 2007 and to take over all of Gagosian\u2019s galleries in 2012 (11 of them at the time) with a retrospective of his spot paintings. But Mr. Hirst, collectors, dealers and auction executives say, is worthy of attention, as evidenced by the Tate Modern\u2019s decision to devote a retrospective to his work in 2012. \u201cHe is still one of the greatest artists of this century,\u201d said the real estate developer Aby Rosen, who described himself as \u201clong on Hirst\u201d in his art collection, calling the new \u201cTreasures\u201d work \u201cstunning. \u201d \u201cHe will produce till he dies because he has so much brain  \u2014   he\u2019s so deep,\u201d Mr. Rosen added. \u201cAnd this guy is not going away. \u201d As to whether collectors unable to sell their Hirsts had a right to be frustrated, Mr. Rosen said: \u201cIf you want to be a collector, you have to collect wide and deep, and within your portfolio things will go up and down. If you buy two stocks and one goes down, don\u2019t be angry at IBM or G. M. \u201d There are those who say that Mr. Hirst\u2019s coming shows in Venice are inextricably linked with Mr. Pinault, who owns Christie\u2019s auction house and has avidly collected Mr. Hirst\u2019s work. Does he want to   the Hirst market out of   art experts ask, to raise the value of his own holdings? Whatever the case, most agree that Mr. Hirst  \u2014   with an estimated net worth of $350 million  \u2014   doesn\u2019t need the money. \u201cI do believe that Damien Hirst  \u2014   especially early Damien Hirst  \u2014   will have an important footprint in art history,\u201d Mr. Nahmad said. \u201cThe true   Damien Hirst collectors, if they love what he\u2019s doing now, they\u2019ll buy into it and disregard that this guy so many times in the past has way overproduced. \u201d Perhaps more than any other artist, Mr. Hirst has embodied the meteoric rise of the artist as celebrity, the auction market at its height and collectors competing to pay millions for a stuffed shark or flattened butterfly. But as art has increasingly become an asset class, Mr. Hirst has also come to symbolize how a   stock can tank. Here, a look back at some of the critical junctures in the volatile yet riveting trajectory of Mr. Hirst. 1991: Formaldehyde Mr. Hirst takes the art world by storm with his tiger shark suspended in formaldehyde, which the billionaire   manager Steven A. Cohen buys for a reported $12 million. 1990s: Butterflies Mr. Hirst explores themes like death and science with butterflies pinned under glass. 2000s: Pill Cabinets Mr. Hirst\u2019s colored, handmade pills recall Victorian curiosity cabinets and explore modern notions of medicine. 2007: Luxe Skulls Mr. Hirst announces sale of his   skull for $100 million. 2008:   Sotheby\u2019s Sale Brings $200 Million Mr. Hirst bypasses dealers to sell all 223 works, breaking the record for a   auction, set in 1993 when an   Picasso sale brought $20 million.  : Tanking at Auction After his Sotheby\u2019s sale, Mr. Hirst\u2019s prices at auction top out at $1. 5 million (for his \u201cMickey\u201d canvas at Christie\u2019s London in 2014) and eventually fail to sell (his \u201cBeautiful Mickey Mouse Painting,\u201d estimated at $400, 000 to $600, 000 at Christie\u2019s in May 2015). January 2012: Spot Paintings Everywhere Larry Gagosian agrees to show Mr. Hirst\u2019s spot paintings in all of his 11 galleries. December  2012: Hirst Leaves Gagosian Mr. Hirst stuns the art world by announcing that he is leaving the Gagosian gallery, where he has been represented for 17 years. 2016: Hirst and Gagosian Reunite Four years after leaving Larry Gagosian, Mr. Hirst returns to the gallery. \u201cI share a long history with Larry,\u201d the artist says in a statement, \u201cand am pleased we are working together once again. \u201d Mr. Gagosian says: \u201cTake Damien Hirst out of contemporary art history, and there\u2019s an incredible void. Great artists, like great people, have second acts. \u201d 2017: Hirst to Unveil a New Work at Pinault Collection in Venice Ten years in the making, Mr. Hirst\u2019s exhibition is to open just before the Venice Biennale, the first time that the two Venetian locations of the Pinault Collection will be dedicated to a single artist.'"}, "time": 1742628399.4964435}
