Shay Rosecrans crossed into the military detention center at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, she tucked her medical school class ring into her bra, covered the name on her uniform with tape and hid her necklace under her   especially if she was wearing a cross. She tried to block out thoughts of her    daughter. Dr. Rosecrans, a Navy psychiatrist, had been warned not to speak about her family or display anything personal, clues that might allow a terrorism suspect to identify her. Patients called her \u201ctorture bitch,\u201d spat at her   and shouted death threats, she said. One hurled a cup of urine, feces and other fluids at a psychologist working with her. Even interviewing prisoners to assess their mental health set off recriminations and claims that she was torturing them. \u201cWhat would your Jesus think?\u201d they demanded. Dr. Rosecrans, now retired from the Navy, led one of the mental health teams assigned to care for detainees at the island prison over the past 15 years. Some prisoners had arrived disturbed  \u2014   traumatized adolescents hauled in from the battlefield, unstable adults who disrupted the cellblocks. Others, facing indefinite confinement, struggled with despair. Then there were prisoners who had developed symptoms including hallucinations, nightmares, anxiety or depression after undergoing brutal interrogations at the hands of Americans who were advised by other health personnel. At Guant\u00e1namo, a willful blindness to the consequences emerged. Those equipped to diagnose, document and treat the effects  \u2014   psychiatrists, psychologists and mental health teams  \u2014   were often unaware of what had happened. Sometimes by instruction and sometimes by choice, they typically did not ask what the prisoners had experienced in interrogations, current and former military doctors said. That compromised care, according to outside physicians working with legal defense teams, previously undisclosed medical records and court filings. Dozens of men who underwent agonizing treatment in secret C. I. A. prisons or at Guant\u00e1namo were left with psychological problems that persisted for years, despite government lawyers\u2019 assurances that the practices did not constitute torture and would cause no lasting harm, The New York Times has reported. Some men should never have been held, government investigators concluded.   Donald J. Trump declared during his campaign that he would bring back banned interrogation tactics, including waterboarding, and authorize others that were \u201cmuch worse. \u201d In recent interviews, more than two dozen military medical personnel who served or consulted at Guant\u00e1namo provided the most detailed account to date of mental health care there. Almost from the start, the shadow of interrogation and mutual suspicion tainted the mission of those treating prisoners. That limited their effectiveness for years to come. Psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses and technicians received little training for the assignment and, they said, felt unprepared to tend to men they were told were \u201cthe worst of the worst. \u201d Doctors felt pushed to cross ethical boundaries, and were warned that their actions, at an institution roiled by detainees\u2019 organized resistance, could have political and national security implications. Rotations lasted only three to nine months, making it difficult to establish rapport. In a field that requires intimacy, the psychiatrists and their teams long used pseudonyms like Major Psych, Dr. Crocodile, Superman and Big Momma, and referred to patients by serial numbers, not names. They frequently had to speak through fences or slits in cell doors, using interpreters who also worked with interrogators. Wary patients often declined to talk to the mental health teams. (\u201cDetainee refused to interact,\u201d medical records note repeatedly.) At a place so shrouded in secrecy that for years any information learned from a detainee was to be treated as classified, what went on in interrogations \u201cwas completely restricted territory,\u201d said Karen Thurman, a Navy commander, now retired, who served as a psychiatric nurse practitioner at Guant\u00e1namo. \u201c\u2018How did it go? \u2019\u201d Or \u201c\u2018Did they hit you?\u2019 We were not allowed to ask that,\u201d she said. Dr. Rosecrans said she held back on such questions when she was there in 2004, not suspecting abuse and feeling constrained by the prison environment. \u201cFrom a surgical perspective, you never open up a wound you cannot close,\u201d she said. \u201cUnless you have months, years, to help this person and help them get out of this hole, why would you ever do this?\u201d The United States military defends the quality of mental health care at Guant\u00e1namo as humane and appropriate. Detainees, human rights groups and doctors consulting for defense teams offer more critical assessments, describing it as negligent or ineffective in many cases. Those who served at the prison, most of whom had never spoken publicly before, said they had helped their patients and had done the best they could. Given the circumstances, many focused on the most basic of duties. \u201cMy goal was to keep everyone alive,\u201d Dr. Rosecrans said. \u201cWe tried to keep the water as smooth as possible,\u201d Ms. Thurman said. \u201cMy job was to keep them going,\u201d said Andy Davidson, a Navy captain, now retired, and psychologist. When Dr. Rosecrans worked briefly at the Navy\u2019s hospital at Guant\u00e1namo as a young psychiatrist in 1999, it was a sleepy assignment. She saw only a few outpatients each week, and there was no psychiatric ward on the base, which was being downsized. But after Al Qaeda\u2019s 2001 terror attacks on New York and the Pentagon, and the subsequent   invasion of Afghanistan, detainees began pouring into the island in early 2002  \u2014   airplane loads of 20 to 30 men in shackles and   goggles. \u201cWe were seeing prisoners arriving with mental problems,\u201d said Capt. Albert Shimkus, then the hospital\u2019s commanding officer. There were no clear protocols for treating patients considered to be \u201cenemy combatants,\u201d rather than prisoners of war, said Captain Shimkus, who is now retired. But he set out, with the tacit support of his commanders, to provide a level of care equivalent to that for American service members. He transformed a cellblock into a spartan inpatient unit for up to 20 patients and brought in Navy psychiatrists, psychiatric nurses and technicians to be available around the clock. Many of them had little or no predeployment training, experience working in a detention facility or familiarity with the captives\u2019 languages, cultures or religious beliefs. They soon heard talk of the threat the prisoners posed. \u201cThe crew that was there before us scared the heck out of us,\u201d said Dr. Christopher Kowalsky, who as a Navy captain led the mental health unit in 2004. He and Dr. Rosecrans said colleagues had admonished them for getting too close to patients. \u201c\u2018Don\u2019t forget they\u2019re criminals,\u2019\u201d she was told. Those arriving in later years attended a training program at a military base in Washington State. \u201cYou heard all these things about how terrible they are: Not only will they gouge your eyes out, but they\u2019ll somehow tell their cohorts to go after your family,\u201d said Daniel Lakemacher, who served as a Navy psychiatric technician. \u201cI became extremely hateful and spiteful. \u201d Peering through small openings in cell doors, he and other technicians handed out medications, watched prisoners swallow them and ran through a checklist of safety questions  \u2014   \u201cAre you having thoughts of hurting yourself?\u201d \u201cAre you seeing things that aren\u2019t there?\u201d  \u2014   through interpreters or   detainees in nearby cells. (\u201cTalk about confidentiality!\u201d Dr. Davidson said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a whole other set of rules. \u201d) Conflicts arose between health professionals aiding interrogators and those trying to provide care. Army psychologists working with military intelligence teams showed up in 2002 and asked to be credentialed to treat detainees. \u201cI said no, because they were there for interrogations,\u201d Captain Shimkus said. In June of that year, Maj. Paul Burney, an Army psychiatrist, and Maj. John Leso, an Army psychologist, both of whom had deployed to Guant\u00e1namo to tend to the troops, instead were assigned to devise interrogation techniques. In a memo, they listed escalating pressure tactics, including extended isolation,   interrogations, painful stress positions, yelling, hooding, and manipulation of diet, environment and sleep. But they also expressed caution. \u201cPhysical   emotional harm from the above techniques may emerge months or even years after their use,\u201d the two men warned in their memo, later excerpted in a Senate Armed Services Committee report. They added that the most effective interrogation strategy was developing a bond. A version of the memo, stripped of its warnings, reached Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld. In December 2002, he approved many of the methods for Guant\u00e1namo, some of them similar to the \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d used by the C. I. A. at secret prisons overseas. After objections from military lawyers, he made some modifications but gave commanders license to use 24 techniques. Some of them later migrated to military prisons in Afghanistan and Iraq, including Abu Ghraib, where they morphed into horrific abuses. \u201cI think it was the absolute wrong way to proceed,\u201d Dr. Burney, who has not previously commented publicly, said of the approved techniques. \u201cI so wish I could go back and do things differently. \u201d He and Dr. Leso created the Behavioral Science Consultation Team, or BSCT (pronounced \u201cbiscuit\u201d) to advise and sometimes rein in military interrogators, many of them young enlisted soldiers with little experience even interviewing people. The interrogators subjected some detainees at Guant\u00e1namo to loud music, strobe lights, cold temperatures, isolation, painful shackling, threats against family members and prolonged sleep deprivation, according to the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general. The government has never quantified how many prisoners underwent that treatment. In four cases, military leaders approved even harsher interrogation plans. At least two were carried out. Dr. Burney said he and Dr. Leso took turns observing the questioning in 2002 of Mohammed   who was accused of being an intended hijacker in the Sept. 11 attacks and, it later emerged, had a history of psychosis. Among other things, he was menaced with military dogs, draped in women\u2019s underwear, injected with intravenous fluids to make him urinate on himself, put on a leash and forced to bark like a dog, and interrogated for 18 to 20 hours at least 48 times, government investigators found. Mr. Qahtani was led to believe that he might die if he did not cooperate, Dr. Burney said in a statement provided to the Senate committee. When Mr. Qahtani asked for a doctor to relieve psychological symptoms, the interrogators instead performed an exorcism for \u201cjinns\u201d  \u2014   supernatural creatures that he believed caused his problems. In 2009, a Department of Defense official overseeing military commissions refused to prosecute Mr. Qahtani, telling The Washington Post that his mistreatment had amounted to torture. In 2012, a federal judge found Mr. Qahtani incompetent to help challenge his detention. Those providing mental health care at Guant\u00e1namo quickly aroused the suspicions of some prisoners, who called them devils, criminals and dogs. \u201cNobody trusted them,\u201d said Lutfi bin Ali, a Tunisian who was sent to Guant\u00e1namo after being subjected to harsh conditions at what he described as an American jail overseas. \u201cThere was skepticism that they were psychiatrists and that they were trying to help us,\u201d he said by phone from Kazakhstan, where he was transferred to in 2014. He still suffers intermittently from depression. Dr. Davidson, who treated prisoners at Guant\u00e1namo during part of 2003, recalled the hostility. \u201cI can tell the guy until the cows come home, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m just here for mental health,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018No, you\u2019re not,\u2019\u201d he imagined the patient thinking, \u201c\u2018you\u2019re the enemy. \u2019\u201d One day on the cellblocks, Dr. Rosecrans heard detainees warn others that she could not be trusted. \u201cSome of my patients hated me,\u201d she said. \u201cThey saw me as a representative of the government. \u201d She and other clinicians who felt uncomfortable walking around the prison grounds relied mostly on guards to identify detainees who needed help and to take them to an examination room, where they would be chained to the floor. Interpreters were in such short supply at times that they worked with both the mental health teams and the interrogators. \u201cSee where that could be a problem?\u201d Dr. Rosecrans asked. All of that fed the conviction among detainees that information about their mental health was being exploited by interrogators. \u201cIf you complain about your weak point to a doctor, they told that to the interrogators,\u201d said Younous Chekkouri, a Moroccan, now released. He recalled seeing one psychologist working alongside interrogators and then treating detainees at the prison. Only years later, he said, did he feel he could trust certain psychiatrists there. He said he still suffered from flashbacks and anxiety after being beaten at a military prison in Afghanistan, and kept in isolation and shown execution photos at Guant\u00e1namo. Captain Shimkus, who oversaw patient care, said some clinicians had expressed concerns about the blurred lines between medical care and interrogation. He said he had allowed one psychiatrist, who was disturbed by the lack of confidentiality, to temporarily recuse himself from caring for patients because the doctor believed \u201cthe   relationship was compromised. \u201d The United States Southern Command told health care providers at Guant\u00e1namo in 2002 that their communications with patients were \u201cnot confidential. \u201d At first, interrogators had direct access to medical information. Then, the BSCT psychologists acted as liaisons. They regularly read patient records in the psychiatry ward, said Dr. Frances Stewart, a retired Navy captain and psychiatrist who treated detainees in 2003 and 2004. As a consequence, she said, \u201cI tried to document just the things that really needed to be documented  \u2014   things like \u2018the patient has a headache we treated it with Tylenol\u2019  \u2014   not anything terribly sensitive. It was not a perfect solution, but it was probably the best solution I could come up with at the time. \u201d Dr. Kowalsky, a psychiatrist, said patients had begged him not to record their diagnoses. \u201cThey\u2019re going to use that,\u201d some detainees told him. The International Committee of the Red Cross, during a June 2004 visit, documented the same complaint. Medical files, the group said in confidential remarks  revealed in The  Times, were regularly used to devise strategies for interrogations that it called \u201ctantamount to torture. \u201d Interrogators\u2019 access to medical records was a \u201cflagrant violation of medical ethics. \u201d The Pentagon disputed that the records were used to harm detainees. Dr. Kowalsky said he clashed with a BSCT psychologist, Diane Zierhoffer, who showed up in the psychiatric unit to look at patient records in 2004. (Dr. Zierhoffer, in an email, said her intent in accessing records had been to \u201censure health care was not interfered with. \u201d) \u201cWe\u2019re here to help people,\u201d Dr. Kowalsky recalled once telling her. \u201cWe\u2019re here to protect our country,\u201d he said she had responded, later asking: \u201cWhose side are you on?\u201d Sometimes it wasn\u2019t clear what was forbidden or what had just become practice, but it had the same effect: Psychiatrists and psychologists said they had almost never asked a detainee about his treatment by interrogators, either at Guant\u00e1namo or at the C. I. A. prisons. Mohamedou Ould Slahi, who was released to his native Mauritania in October after 14 years at Guant\u00e1namo, told a doctor on his legal team that military mental health providers did not ask him about possible mistreatment, according to a sealed court report obtained by The Times. Mr. Slahi did not volunteer the information because he was afraid of retaliation, he wrote in his prison memoir, \u201cGuant\u00e1namo Diary. \u201d Mr. Slahi endured some of the most brutal treatment there. Investigations by the Army, the Justice Department and the Senate largely corroborated his account of being deprived of sleep beaten shackled in painful positions forced to drink large amounts of water isolated in darkness and exposed to extreme temperatures stripped and soaked in cold water told that his mother might be sent to Guant\u00e1namo and sexually assaulted by female interrogators. Decades earlier, he had joined the insurgency against the   government in Afghanistan, a cause supported by the United States. In 1991, he attended a Qaeda training camp, and was later suspected of recruiting for the terrorist group. A federal judge ordered him freed in 2010 for lack of evidence, but an appeals court overturned the decision. In July, a military review board recommended his transfer. Prison medical records show that Mr. Slahi, a computer specialist with no history of mental illness, received   medicine, antidepressants, sleeping pills and psychotherapy, and that he had recurring nightmares of being tortured in the years after his ordeal. Dr. Vincent Iacopino, a civilian physician who evaluated Mr. Slahi in 2007 for his defense team, criticized psychologists and psychiatrists at Guant\u00e1namo for failing \u201cto adequately pursue the obvious possibility of PTSD,\u201d or   stress disorder, linked to severe physical and mental harm, the records show. Dr. Iacopino said military doctors had medicated Mr. Slahi for his symptoms instead of trying to treat his underlying disorder, which had \u201cprofound   and debilitating psychological effects. \u201d Last year, one of Mr. Slahi\u2019s lawyers described him as \u201cdamaged. \u201d He was one of nearly 800 men incarcerated at Guant\u00e1namo over the years and one of several whose confessions were tainted by mistreatment and disallowed as evidence by the United States. Many prisoners were Qaeda and Taliban foot soldiers later deemed to pose little threat. Some were victims of mistaken identity or held on flimsy evidence. Dr. Burney, who assisted the interrogators, said he had seen many detainees\u2019 files. \u201cIt seemed like there wasn\u2019t a whole lot of evidence about anything for a whole lot of those folks,\u201d he said. After the C. I. A. \u2019s secret prisons were shut in 2006, Guant\u00e1namo took in more than a dozen     detainees, including those accused of plotting the Sept. 11 attacks. Some doctors at Guant\u00e1namo said they had been instructed, in briefings or by colleagues, not to ask these former \u201cblack site\u201d prisoners about what had happened there. Virtually everything about these captives was classified until a Senate Intelligence Committee report in 2014 disclosed grisly details about torture. \u201cYou just weren\u2019t allowed to talk about those things, even with them,\u201d said Dr. Michael Fahey Traver, an Army psychiatrist at Guant\u00e1namo in 2013 and 2014. He was assigned to treat only   detainees kept in Camp 7, Guant\u00e1namo\u2019s most restricted area, so that he did not inadvertently pass sensitive information to other prisoners. If a detainee raised the subject of his prior treatment, Dr. Traver was to redirect the conversation, he said his predecessor had told him. Among his patients were Ramzi bin   accused of helping plot the Sept. 11 attacks, and Abd     who was charged in the 2000 bombing of the American destroyer Cole and endured some of the C. I. A. \u2019s most extreme interrogation techniques, including waterboarding. At the request of prosecutors, a military psychiatrist and two military psychologists went to Guant\u00e1namo in 2013 to assess Mr. Nashiri\u2019s competency to assist in his defense. The panel concluded that, while competent, he suffered from PTSD and major depression. The military commission trying Mr. Nashiri held a hearing in 2014 on the adequacy of his mental health care. Shortly before the hearing, Dr. Traver removed a previous diagnosis by another Guant\u00e1namo psychiatrist that Mr. Nashiri had PTSD. \u201cI didn\u2019t think he met that diagnosis,\u201d Dr. Traver said in an interview. Dr. Sondra Crosby, an expert on torture who consulted for Mr. Nashiri\u2019s defense, disagreed. Dr. Crosby, an internist, said his treatment was inadequate. \u201cHe suffers chronic nightmares,\u201d she testified in an affidavit, which \u201cdirectly relate to the specific physical, emotional and sexual torture inflicted upon Mr.   while in U. S. custody. \u201d The content of his nightmares, she wrote, was classified. The commission judge, citing a Supreme Court ruling that prisons must provide health care, found insufficient evidence of \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to his medical needs. What went on after prisoners were summoned for interrogations at Guant\u00e1namo was mostly a mystery to the mental health personnel, some of them said. Even when patients returned from sessions \u201clooking terrible,\u201d said Mr. Lakemacher, the former psychiatric technician, \u201cthat was not to be addressed. \u201d (After his deployment, Mr. Lakemacher said, he regretted taking part in what he came to consider the unjust, indefinite detention of prisoners. He later was discharged from the Navy as a conscientious objector.) Some doctors, on their own, shied away from the subject of interrogation tactics. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to get near that stuff,\u201d Dr. Rosecrans said. \u201cMen would say, \u2018When I got here, they treated me like a dog,\u2019\u201d or that they were humiliated, she said, but she refrained from inquiring, in part, \u201cto preserve their dignity. \u201d When detainees claimed to have been tortured or maltreated, \u201cyou didn\u2019t know if it was true or not,\u201d she said. \u201cIs it PTSD, or is it delusional disorder?\u201d she said, adding, \u201cI was in such a vacuum. \u201d But Dr. Rosecrans had little reason to suspect abusive treatment, she said, because some prisoners seemed eager to go to interrogation sessions, which they called \u201creservations. \u201d Interrogators, working in trailers separate from the structures where detainees were housed, doled out rewards like snack food or magazines speaking with them broke the boredom for detainees. \u201cIt was a way to get out of their cell,\u201d said Ms. Thurman, the nurse practitioner. \u201cThey\u2019d do anything, I think, to do something different for the day. \u201d Dr. Stewart, the Navy captain who treated detainees in 2003 and 2004, said she had never noticed any men in distress after returning from interrogations. But she typically did not ask what had happened there or try to focus on trauma in therapy, she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to stir up anything that might make things worse,\u201d she said. PTSD, generally thought to be the most common psychiatric illness resulting from torture, was rarely diagnosed at Guant\u00e1namo. Dr. Rosecrans and other doctors who served there said the diagnosis did not matter because they could still treat the symptoms, like depression, anxiety or insomnia. Standard treatment for the disorder involves building trust and revisiting traumatic experiences, which can temporarily exacerbate symptoms. That was impractical at Guant\u00e1namo, Dr. Rosecrans and others contended, where detainees were under stress and often unwilling to talk about what had happened to them. \u201cThese folks were in acute survival mode,\u201d Dr. Rosecrans said. Most of their concerns were \u201c   or   not  . \u201d Dr. Davidson said he had not considered doing full histories to diagnose PTSD. But later, he said, after he mulled over the experiences of American soldiers, \u201cthe thought was occurring to me: How come our guys get PTSD and they don\u2019t? Well, probably because I\u2019m not asking the right questions. \u201d Dr. Jonathan Woodson, a former assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, who was the Pentagon\u2019s top health official from 2010 until this spring, said he was unaware that mental health providers at Guant\u00e1namo had avoided asking detainees about coercive interrogations. He said his policy was that physicians should not be constrained in what they could ask patients. \u201cYou would take the history of someone who is exhibiting symptoms,\u201d he said. \u201cIn PTSD, it\u2019s almost automatic. \u201d Brig. Gen. Stephen N. Xenakis, a retired Army psychiatrist who consulted for the legal defense teams of many detainees, said, \u201cYou cannot provide psychological treatment if you never look into what happened to them when they are tortured. \u201d He added: \u201cThe psychologists and psychiatrists at Guant\u00e1namo are not meeting the standards of care of the military or the profession. \u201d Military officials disagree. Capt. John Filostrat, a spokesman for Joint Task Force Guantanamo, said, \u201cWe are doing a tough job, and we are doing it well. \u201d Mental health providers recall troubled men they helped  \u2014   an Afghan farmer who attempted suicide, a psychotic Yemeni man stabilized and removed from isolation, a traumatized Saudi patient who began opening up. Some doctors describe Guant\u00e1namo as their most difficult deployment. They were cast in unfamiliar roles: recipients of pleas for privileges, inadvertent disciplinarians ordering \u201c \u201d restrictions like the removal of prayer beads or sheets, enablers of policies that made them deeply uncomfortable. \u201cEvery day was an ethical challenge, quite frankly,\u201d Dr. Davidson said. Procedures at Guant\u00e1namo changed over time. Limits on abusive tactics were tightened by Congress in 2005, then banned by President Obama in 2009. But even after interrogation conditions eased, and after BSCT personnel were denied access to medical records in 2005, many detainees remained distrustful. That made it \u201ca real challenge for the physicians treating them to even determine what was a real problem and what wasn\u2019t,\u201d said Dr. Bruce Meneley, a Navy captain, now retired, who commanded the medical group at Guant\u00e1namo from 2007 to 2009. Some men, worried about being seen as weak or crazy, would disclose only physical complaints like stomach aches, headaches and insomnia. Dr. Traver said sleeping pills had been the sole medication that the   detainees he treated would agree to take. The doctors were unfamiliar with the ways psychiatric illness could be expressed in some cultures. A number of prisoners, Dr. Rosecrans recalled, described being plagued by jinns. She and others prescribed powerful   but she remembers wondering, \u201cAre we doing the right thing?\u201d After years of incarceration at a place that became a symbol of American injustice  \u2014   a legal black hole where men often did not know what they were accused of and had few avenues of legal recourse  \u2014   many detainees, seeing themselves as political prisoners, seethed with resentment or were overcome by depression. Over and over, the psychiatrists recalled, men would ask, \u201cWhy am I here?\u201d or \u201cWhat\u2019s my future?\u201d  \u2014   questions the doctors could not answer. Sometimes, they said, their work felt futile. \u201cThe environmental factors outweighed so much of what we did,\u201d Dr. Davidson said. \u201cWe had so many people who were depressed. Well, I would be really depressed, too, if they stuck me in a place, I had no idea where I was, and I had no idea if or when I was going to leave. That is the definition of depression, I think  \u2014   not having any control over my situation. \u201d It was often difficult to discern, doctors said, who was genuinely troubled, who was seeking attention and, most worrisome, who was in danger. \u201cAll of the leaders that I met were like, \u2018No one is dying on my watch,\u2019\u201d Dr. Rosecrans said. In 2004, after men began refusing food to protest their detention, she was asked to devise a protocol for evaluating the mental health of those on prolonged hunger strikes. Dr. Rosecrans believed that mentally competent people had the right to choose not to eat  \u2014   even if that meant they would die. The American Medical Association and international medical organizations endorse that position. But the government has insisted on forced feedings, which are permissible in federal prisons. Detainees have described the procedures used at Guant\u00e1namo as particularly painful, with some likening them to torture. Musa\u2019ab   a Yemeni captured in Pakistan and suspected in a terrorism plot, the evidence for which the United States eventually largely disavowed, joined a large group of hunger strikers in 2013 protesting conditions at the prison. He had arrived at Guant\u00e1namo in 2002, barely out of his teens, after being held at a C. I. A. prison. He had violent nightmares and other psychiatric problems after harsh treatment there, his medical records show. Over the years, judges threw out his admissions during interrogations, finding they were tainted by mistreatment at the C. I. A. prison and coercive questioning at Guant\u00e1namo. But his detention stretched on, and after both of his parents died, Mr. Madhwani said in a letter to a federal judge that he was \u201cutterly hopeless. \u201d He added: \u201cI have no reason to believe that I will ever leave this prison alive. It feels like death would be a better fate than living in these conditions. \u201d It was up to the psychiatrists and psychologists to decide how seriously to take such statements, and how to respond to them. \u201cWhat do you do if they say they\u2019re suicidal?\u201d said Dr. Elspeth Cameron Ritchie, an Army colonel, now retired, and psychiatrist who was dispatched to Guant\u00e1namo in late 2002 after a spate of attempts. \u201cAre they really suicidal, or are they manipulating the system?\u201d More than 600 \u201csuicide gestures\u201d had been recorded at Guant\u00e1namo by 2009, with more than 40 categorized as suicide attempts, according to a medical article. The doctors had to distinguish genuine attempts  \u2014   reflecting desperation or, as American officials contended, a desire for martyrdom  \u2014   from acts aimed at improving their conditions of confinement. To date, at least six deaths have been have classified as suicides, though critics have raised questions about foul play in some cases. One Guant\u00e1namo commander referred to three of them, which were simultaneous, as acts of warfare against America. Several of the dead had been treated by mental health providers for serious disorders. Only 60 prisoners remain at Guant\u00e1namo, and about a third of them have been approved for transfer. Ten have been charged with or convicted of crimes by the military commissions system. Capt. Richard Quattrone of the Navy, who served until September as the prison\u2019s chief medical officer, said just a small number of detainees had chronic mental health issues. \u201cThe things we see are about    issues, anxiety over their release, and when it will happen, or if it will happen,\u201d he said. \u201cWhatever happened in the past,\u201d he added, \u201cI think we\u2019ve now built trust with the medical personnel. \u201d Looking back, Dr. Rosecrans said she and her colleagues had faced many obstacles. For certain prisoners, the very tool that psychiatrists and psychologists most rely on  \u2014   asking questions  \u2014   would forever evoke interrogations. And the secrecy complicated everything. \u201cDid we know what was going on? Or what might have been going on?\u201d Dr. Rosecrans asked. \u201cI didn\u2019t know any of that intel stuff. \u201d But, she added, \u201cwe did the job of treating patients. \u201d Guant\u00e1namo stayed with her in unexpected ways. Relaxing on a cruise soon after leaving the prison assignment, she tried to pose her daughter for a photo. When the child refused to put down a stuffed animal, Dr. Rosecrans threatened to throw it overboard. \u201cYou\u2019re a little terrorist!\u201d she erupted.'"}, "time": 1742561840.1763792}
