Even the toilet paper wouldn\u2019t be safe from her.\u201d \\nMason was speaking during his regular segment on this reporter\u2019s talk radio program, \u201cAaron Klein Investigative Radio,\u201d broadcast on New York\u2019s AM 970 The Answer and NewsTalk 990 AM in Philadelphia. \\nHe continued: \\nDo you think that if she went for any other job besides the presidency that anyone would hire her anywhere? If you saw her resume which is a resume of accomplishing nothing and running from the police three-quarters of her life. She is always either indicted or almost indicted or about to be indicted. Her whole life spent fleeing from the Justice Departments of different countries. Now, this yenta, do you think she would be able to get any other job? \u2026 \\nWould you think they would hire her as a chambermaid? Do you know what all those sheets and pillowcases are worth? Do you think they would trust her with it? After they found out the history of her life. Let\u2019s be honest about it, if you went on a vacation would you let her watch your house while you went on vacation? Would you expect to come back and find anything still there?'"}, "time": 1742561804.1051006}
