[\u201cI don\u2019t double cross,\u201d Kelly tells Jones, repeatedly assuring him that her interview would not dwell on \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d or familiar   attacks against the independent broadcast host. Rather, Kelly says that the focus of the news profile would be to humanize Jones and explore his personal life.   Jones himself appears in the video, revealing the private phone conversation on his website InfoWars in advance of Kelly\u2019s Sunday broadcast. He annotates the audio clips with his own commentary, NBC\u2019s preview snippet of the   interview, and news clips about the ensuing uproar  \u2014   where a besieged Kelly has denounced Jones\u2019 coverage of the 2012 Sandy Hook mass shooting as \u201crevolting. \u201d The video puts Kelly in a precarious position. As her fledgling weekend news magazine show fights for viability,   agitators have attacked her for interviewing Jones. A boycott sprang up before the broadcast ever aired, pressuring sponsors and reportedly convincing major brands to pull their . In response, she gave a statement contradicting nearly everything she promised in this phone call. \u201cThe very question that prompted this interview,\u201d she claimed, is: \u201cHow does Jones, who traffics in these outrageous conspiracy theories, have the respect of the president of the United States and a growing audience of millions?\u201d However, Jones has revealed, her pitch was the exact opposite: \u201cI promise you that\u2019s not what this will be [a hit piece],\u201d she says. \u201cIt really will be about, who is this guy?\u201d Later on, she expresses her hope that some liberal viewers would come out of the segment saying, \u201cI see the guy who loves those kids and who is more complex than I\u2019ve been led to believe. \u201d So, which statement is true? That conclusion is not as easy as one would assume. Kelly now finds herself in the unenviable position of appeasing corporate sponsors spooked by   outrage while also trying to establish herself as a trustworthy interviewer. bShe has nothing to lose if Alex Jones feels betrayed and never talks to her again, but she does express fear during their conversation that if he calls her out for a \u201chit piece,\u201d she will have trouble getting any more controversial,   subjects to appear on her show. And, based on the preview clips, Kelly will have to square that broken promise with this fervent declaration about her character: She has nothing to lose if Alex Jones feels betrayed and never talks to her again, but she does express fear during their conversation that if he calls her out for a \u201chit piece,\u201d she will have trouble getting any more controversial,   subjects to appear on her show. And, based on the preview clips, Kelly will have to square that broken promise with this fervent declaration about her character: All I can do is give you my word and tell you  \u2014   if there\u2019s one thing about me, I do what I say I\u2019m gonna do. And I  \u2014   I don\u2019t double cross, so I promise you when it\u2019s over you\u2019ll say, \u201cAbsolutely. She did what she said she was gonna do. \u201d Jones states that he has only released \u201ca few clips\u201d of his full phone conversation with Kelly and that InfoWars taped the entire NBC interview \u201cso that we can document   how she edited, how she manipulated. \u201d He concludes: \u201cIt shows the arrogance of Megyn Kelly that she didn\u2019t think we\u2019d record her to document what she really said and did. \u201d Read selected transcripts of the Alex   Kelly phone conversation below: KELLY: It\u2019s sort of a good opportunity just for   storytelling. You know, it\u2019s like  \u2014   it\u2019s not like the   interview, it\u2019s like the   profiles of people. And at the top of my list was you. JONES: So it\u2019s like an investigative report into \u201cfake news\u201d? KELLY: No. No, what we\u2019re doing? JONES: Yeah. Come on. KELLY: No no no. Hell no. The reason you  \u2014   I mean, I know you guys, you know, [inaudible]  \u2014   The reason you are interesting to me is because I followed your custody case. And I think you had a very good point about the way the media was covering it and for some reason treated you and your family and what was going on as fair game when they never would have done that to, if you will, a mainstream media figure. And I saw a different side of you in that whole thing and I just  \u2014   here, you know, you became very fascinating to me. I just sort of thought you were this maybe, you know,   guy  \u2014   like, this is your thing  \u2014   and the comments I heard from you during the course of that trial and your plea to the media to be respectful of you and your kids just reminded me that you\u2019re just like anybody. You\u2019re a dad, you go through the same things we go through, and I thought, \u201cnow, that would be an interesting story to tell. \u201d   \u2026     JONES: Wouldn\u2019t the argument be, then, in the show, \u2019cause I\u2019ve seen that as a standard Democrat talking point  \u2014   I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing  \u2014   \u201cWell, he asked for privacy in his family, but he didn\u2019t do that for Sandy Hook and he didn\u2019t do that for the pizzeria. \u201d KELLY: No, I mean, I can ask you about that, you know, but this is not gonna be a contentious, you know, sort of \u201cgotcha\u201d exchange. I  \u2014   That\u2019s not what this show is and that\u2019s really not what I want to do. I want to do   profiles on people, just interesting people. So I can ask you that  \u2014   \u201cthis is what the critics say\u201d  \u2014   but this isn\u2019t gonna be a \u201c ! Let\u2019s play a clip. \u201d   \u2026     JONES: I don\u2019t mind questions. What I don\u2019t like is, did you know or did your producers do that you, where I said Hillary Clinton personally  \u2014   and it was    so I could get the satire out. You guys, took it out of context, but  \u2014   did personally kill kids by the Iraq war and Syria war or the Libya situation, and you guys cut the back off of that   \u2014   it was in the same 30 seconds, where I said I\u2019m not talking about the pizza place, I\u2019m talking about in the Middle East. KELLY: No, this is completely unfamiliar to me. JONES: Remember you had James Alefantis on Fox News, you\u2019re talking about fake news. KELLY: The guy from Comet Pizza? JONES: Yes, and then you played a clip of me saying Hillary personally kills children. KELLY: I, forgive me, Alex, but I don\u2019t remember the clip. I remember him [pause] and, you know, the nature of that exchange, which I think is the only time I\u2019ve ever said  \u2014   um, [inaudible] anything. [In that Fox News segment, Kelly says to Alefantis: \u201cAnd someone could have been killed inside of your restaurant for no good reason other than people like Alex Jones fanned a conspiracy theory that even the DC police say has no basis in fact. \u201d] JONES: Sure, sure, sure. I mean, all I\u2019m saying is, I can send you the Right Wing Watch clip where first reported it, and they said, \u201cJones  \u201d you know, \u201csaid that Hillary killed all these kids but then said it in Syria and Libya. \u201d So, I mean I\u2019m just telling you, that\u2019s the kind of stuff that scares me, because I can stand for what I\u2019ve said, and I can even say, yeah I probably shouldn\u2019t [crosstalk] Sure, sure. KELLY: Listen, I\u2019ll take a look at that. That\u2019s very unfamiliar to me. All I can tell you is that I bend over backwards to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen.   \u2026     KELLY: I\u2019m sort of  \u2014   you know, for lack of a better term, I\u2019m trying to create a different kind of program. And it\u2019s fine. You know, I\u2019ll ask you about some of the controversies, of course. And you\u2019ll say whatever you want to say. But it\u2019s not going to be some gotcha hit piece, I promise you that. I  \u2014   it doesn\u2019t do me any good. If I do that to you, then you go out there and you say, \u201cShe did a hit piece on me. This is what she said, and this is what she did. \u201d And then the next time I want to get somebody, they\u2019re gonna say, \u201cLook what you did to Alex Jones,\u201d you know. \u201cScrew you. \u201d So I promise you that\u2019s not what this will be. It really will be about, who is this guy? And we\u2019ll talk about some of the controversy, and I\u2019ll ask you, and you can respond, and we\u2019ll get into the whole, you know, what you\u2019ve been through this past year. And my goal is for your listeners and the left, you know, who will be watching some on NBC, to say, \u201cWow, that was really interesting. \u201d [Note: At this point, the audio quality of Kelly\u2019s phone call abruptly changes  \u2014   All I can do is give you my word and tell you  \u2014   if there\u2019s one thing about me, I do what I say I\u2019m gonna do. And I  \u2014   I don\u2019t double cross, so I promise you when it\u2019s over you\u2019ll say, \u201cAbsolutely. She did what she said she was gonna do. \u201d And you\u2019ll be fine with it. I\u2019m not looking to portray you as some boogeyman or, you know, do any sort of a gotcha moment. I just want to talk about you. I want people to get to know you. And the craziest thing of all would be if some of the people who have this insane version of you in their heads walk away saying, \u201cYou know what? I see, like, the dad in him. I see the guy who loves those kids and who is more complex than I\u2019ve been led to believe. \u201d JONES: Sure, but just so you know,  like, on all the Sandy Hook things, I\u2019ve had debates where I\u2019ve shown both sides where I go back and forth, but I believe people died there. And then they never show me really saying that, over the years, you know, you can look where the people that think nobody died are the ones all that hate me on the other side of it. And so what I\u2019m saying is, people take clips out of context  \u2014   and I know I\u2019ve done a lot of stuff, some of which I\u2019m not proud of. So if people want to do a real piece or something, I mean, obviously, I don\u2019t want to sit here and, like, dodge all these interviews. Like, I told  \u2014   they wanted me to tape something for Charlie Rose\u2019s show, they wanted me to tape something for The View. I\u2019m not saying, oh, I\u2019m such a big, you know, famous guy, it\u2019s just that  \u2014   KELLY: No no, I understand. JONES: These taping things really just lends itself to be, you know, to ask yourself to be run over. But I understand, obviously, this is a magazine show, so it\u2019s highly produced.   \u2026     KELLY: It\u2019s like a whole new world over there [at NBC]. They deeply care about this kind of thing [fact checking]. And it\u2019s not that we didn\u2019t care on cable, it\u2019s just a different game on cable. You know, you move faster, and it\u2019s more real time and, you know, that\u2019s just the fact that more mistakes get made. But I will promise you to personally look at any clips we want to use of you and have a producer run by you whether we are taking it in context and what you are saying about  \u2014   JONES: Well, I say some pretty wild stuff, and I\u2019ll admit to a lot of it\u2019s satire, but also, I\u2019m not trying to be, I\u2019m not being fake about what I\u2019m saying.   \u2026     JONES: So this is like a reboot, relaunch for you  \u2014   that you\u2019re not the, you know,   or   pundit from Fox. You\u2019re an investigative journalist that does magazine, you know, investigations, or  \u2014   KELLY: Exactly. So it\u2019s like an entirely different set of muscles. And trust me when I tell you, my goal is not to go out there and be like, \u201cOh my god, if I sit with her, she\u2019s gonna kill me!\u201d Like  \u2014   but of course I\u2019m gonna do a fair interview. I\u2019m still me! You know, I\u2019m not gonna go out there and be Barbara Walters. You know. You just trust me. It\u2019s  \u2014   I will ask you about the controversies. I will ask you in a non  \u2014   you know, I\u2019ll be fair about it. I\u2019ll give you the chance to respond. And I really just want to talk about you, you know. You.   \u2026     KELLY: I have not enjoyed being, in any way, on the pointy end of the political spear, you know. It was never anything I wanted to do. And so it\u2019s not  \u2014   you know, I would say that I\u2019m a combination of Mike Wallace, Oprah Winfrey, and Larry the Cable Guy. JONES: [Laughter] I know the Larry the Cable Guy. He\u2019s a good guy. KELLY: I love him! And, so, like, that\u2019s what you\u2019ll get in the interview. [Laughter] That\u2019s  \u2014   that\u2019s what you\u2019ll get in the interview. [Laughter] Get, you know, a little bit of all three of those. And hopefully, everybody will walk away feeling like they had a good dinner. You know, nutritious, some red meat, with some dessert at the end.'"}, "time": 1742563872.1342194}
