{"duration": 0.10468196868896484, "input_args": {"text": "'Early last year, in an article in The New York Times Magazine, I defined what I called a \u201cMegyn moment,\u201d in a profile of the Fox News host Megyn Kelly: \u201cWhen you, a Fox guest  \u2014   maybe a regular guest or even an official contributor  \u2014   are pursuing a line of argument that seems perfectly congruent with the Fox worldview, only to have Kelly seize on some part of it and call it out as nonsense, maybe even turn it back on you. \u201d When I wrote that article, the Megyn moment was notable because it was so unusual. Normally, if guests hewed close to Fox News\u2019s   perspective (President Obama, woefully incompetent or frighteningly efficient Democrats, bad, especially Hillary Clinton Republicans good, mostly all of them) they were pretty much safe from challenge. In letting Ms. Kelly break from that orthodoxy here and there, the Fox News chief Roger Ailes seemed to be experimenting with ways to expand his channel\u2019s audience, which was older, whiter and in danger of atrophying despite its longtime perch atop the cable news ratings. Ms. Kelly\u2019s youth and divergent approach had the potential to draw in new viewers. The question at the time was, how far would he be willing to let these Megyn moments go? And what did that mean for Fox? That question arose again after Ms. Kelly had another one of her moments on Tuesday night, with a longtime Fox guest and contributor, Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker. But this time the question has taken on a more existential quality. The network\u2019s longtime chairman, Mr. Ailes, was ousted over sexual harassment accusations last summer a potential new challenger is threatening to emerge from the right in Trump TV, however uncertain it might seem and Ms. Kelly and Fox\u2019s other big star, Bill O\u2019Reilly, are nearing the end of their contracts. Fox News\u2019s very future is on the line. Ms. Kelly\u2019s moment on Tuesday night initially fit the classic pattern. It began with Mr. Gingrich citing signs of positive news for Donald J. Trump from early voting counts, which he said augured a surprise victory for Mr. Trump. Ms. Kelly, clearly mindful of four years ago, when so many Fox News hosts doubted polls showing an Obama   challenged him. \u201cHe\u2019s been behind in virtually every one of the last 40 polls that we\u2019ve seen over the past month, that\u2019s the reality,\u201d she said of Mr. Trump. But what really set Mr. Gingrich off was when Ms. Kelly said the sexual assault accusations against Mr. Trump were clearly taking a toll, raising questions about whether the candidate was \u201ca sexual predator. \u201d Mr. Gingrich asked why Bill Clinton\u2019s accusers weren\u2019t getting covered, and Ms. Kelly replied by saying that on her show they were. The exchange became edgier, and more personal. Mr. Gingrich told her she was \u201cfascinated with sex,\u201d and she told him she was \u201cfascinated by the protection of women. \u201d She signed off by telling him, \u201cYou can take your anger issues and spend some time working on them,\u201d and he more or less said back atcha. (Mr. Trump provided his assessment of the exchange on Wednesday, saying \u201cCongratulations, Newt, on last night. That was an amazing interview. \u201d) Although the pattern was typical, the rancor was not. And it represented a bigger split at Fox News. By all accounts, in the absence of Mr. Ailes, Ms. Kelly has been freer to pursue her show on her own terms, which are certainly not in line with those of either Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Trump and therefore not in line with many in the Fox News core audience (let alone those of her old boss Mr. Ailes, who informally advised Mr. Trump before the debates). The same has held true for the Fox contributors who have not embraced Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy  \u2014   like Dana Perino, the Republican   of \u201cThe Five,\u201d and the Weekly Standard writer Stephen F. Hayes. They have been given ample time and freedom to call it as they see it in ways that were not as obviously apparent earlier this year. In that vein, the Fox News host Chris Wallace emerged as an exceptional debate moderator in the third presidential debate, holding firm with both candidates and asking tough questions of each. But there\u2019s a flip side. In this \u201cFree( er) to Be You and Me\u201d environment at Fox,   network personalities have become even   none more than Sean Hannity, the host whose show follows Ms. Kelly\u2019s. An informal adviser to Mr. Trump, his rhetoric has grown as incendiary as that of his candidate. On the same day as Ms. Kelly\u2019s confrontation with Mr. Gingrich, Mr. Hannity announced on his radio show that if Trump won, he would personally pay to fly President Obama to Canada or, for that matter, Kenya or Indonesia. It was a nod to the fake, old \u201cbirther\u201d conspiracy that even Mr. Trump has eschewed after promoting it for years. So there, on Tuesday, were two distinct futures of Fox. Rupert Murdoch, whose family controls Fox News\u2019s parent company, 21st Century Fox, has so far mostly kept it in its Ailesian mode, which, after all, has made Fox News a major profit driver for its corporate parent and kept it atop the cable news ratings. And Mr. Murdoch\u2019s son Lachlan recently said it would be \u201cfoolish of us\u201d to depart from \u201ca winning strategy. \u201d But CNN is nipping at Fox News\u2019s heels, managing to beat it in the news demographic that advertisers care most about  \u2014   people between the ages of 25 and 54  \u2014   over the last four weeks, the first such sustained victory in 15 years. Still, nothing forces decisions in television news like the hard deadlines of talent contracts. Ms. Kelly\u2019s comes up later next year, followed by that of Mr. O\u2019Reilly. Every rival network has expressed interest in picking her up, and Tuesday night\u2019s Megyn moment can only help her in that regard. The Murdochs have made it clear they would like Ms. Kelly to stay, which they showed with the $6 million advance their book imprint HarperCollins paid for her coming memoir, \u201cSettle for More. \u201d On Wednesday night, The Wall Street Journal  \u2014   a Fox News corporate sibling  \u2014   quoted Rupert Murdoch as saying he viewed Ms. Kelly as important to the network and was hoping to have her contract locked down \u201cvery soon. \u201d But, he added, the network has a \u201cdeep bench\u201d of personalities, any of whom would \u201cgive their right arm for her spot. \u201d But if the Murdochs persuade Ms. Kelly to stay, will there be room for her, Mr. Hannity and Mr. O\u2019Reilly? Both Mr. O\u2019Reilly and Mr. Hannity have openly feuded with her, though Mr. Hannity\u2019s fights have been more bitter and more recent. If Ms. Kelly stays, will they? Who knows if Mr. Trump will pursue some sort of television   venture (he says he has no interest). But if he does, he could conceivably hire Mr. O\u2019Reilly and Mr. Hannity, who has a contract provision that would allow him to follow Mr. Ailes out the door (though the window is tight and it would presumably have to happen in relatively short order). A Trump venture raises the prospect of a more moderate  \u2014   if still plenty    \u2014   Fox News combating not just CNN and MSNBC but also a challenger from the right. Television news would never be the same.'"}, "time": 1742563880.1886427}
