The festival announced late Tuesday that Lady Gaga would perform instead of Beyonc\u00e9 on the second night of its   event in Indio, Calif. over two successive weekends, April   and    \u2014   giving Lady Gaga a headlining spot at the biggest and most influential American music festival just two months after she performed for 117. 5 million viewers at the Super Bowl halftime show. This year\u2019s festival will also be headlined by Radiohead and Kendrick Lamar. Beyonc\u00e9, who is pregnant with twins, announced last Thursday that she was dropping out of this year\u2019s event \u201cfollowing the advice of her doctors,\u201d news that drew lots of devastated tweets from her fans and a sharp price drop for Coachella tickets on the scalping market. (She is to return as a headliner next year.) A number of major acts had been rumored as possible replacements for Beyonc\u00e9, including Rihanna, Chance the Rapper, Daft Punk and even Jay Z, her husband. But the selection of Lady Gaga preserves at least one aspect of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s booking: a major female pop star known for playing to the crowds with a big, choreographed production, something entirely new to the Coachella stage.'"}, "time": 1742564035.90773}
