Gorsuch, hurtling toward a blistering partisan conflict this week over the selection itself, the chamber\u2019s future rules and the decaying standards of civility among lawmakers. The consideration of Judge Gorsuch began as the Republican majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, took a procedural step to end debate this week on President Trump\u2019s nominee. Mr. McConnell\u2019s maneuver will set in motion a series of critical votes expected to take place on Thursday and Friday. With an almost certain Democratic filibuster of the nomination, the Senate is to vote first on whether to end debate and proceed to an    vote. If the filibuster holds, meaning fewer than 60 senators vote to proceed to a full vote on the nominee, Republicans have said they will pursue the   nuclear option: changing longstanding rules to elevate Judge Gorsuch on a simple majority vote. That would allow Judge Gorsuch to be confirmed on Friday. Yet, if the ultimate outcome has seemed preordained for weeks, lawmakers nonetheless felt compelled on Tuesday to frame the confrontation on their terms: Republicans have argued that the responsibility for their own prospective vote  \u2014   upending Senate tradition to bypass the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations  \u2014   actually lies with Democrats. Many have refrained from even uttering the phrase \u201cnuclear option\u201d when pressed, despite its common use in the Capitol, for apparent fear of associating with an act of procedural aggression. At the same time, Democrats have operated on two tracks: They have sought to present their opponents as hypocrites by reminding the public about Judge Merrick B. Garland, President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee for the seat last year, whom Republicans refused to even consider during a presidential election year. But the minority party has insisted that its resistance to Judge Gorsuch is not about retribution, citing his record on workers\u2019 rights and his degree of independence from Mr. Trump, among other concerns. They have argued that the nomination should be withdrawn if the judge cannot earn 60 votes. \u201cWe lost one, they lost one,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, told reporters, predicting a successful blockade. \u201cWe should now get in a room and come up with a compromise. \u201d Mr. McConnell said he would have no choice but to change the rules if faced with a filibuster. \u201cAmericans will be watching. History will be watching,\u201d he said, urging Democrats to abandon their plans. \u201cAnd the future of the Senate will hang on their choice. \u201d The posturing came one day after Judge Gorsuch was approved 11 to 9 by the Judiciary Committee in a   vote. Both sides have pointed repeatedly to examples of escalating obstructionism in recent years, from Democratic attempts to block judicial nominees under President George W. Bush to a   proliferation of Republican filibusters under Mr. Obama. Most senators seemed to agree that they were participating in a low moment for the chamber, even as they appeared resigned to the conclusion. Grim reflection has grown more common than usual, which is saying something. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason they call it the nuclear option,\u201d Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said. \u201cThere\u2019s fallout. \u201d He alluded to Republican criticism of the Democrats\u2019 choice in 2013, when they held the Senate majority, to bar filibusters on lower judgeships and executive branch nominees. \u201cThere is no equivalence,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal said. Asked what was happening to an institution many lawmakers still revere, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, stared gravely at a group of reporters in the basement of the Capitol. \u201cPartisanship. Partisanship. Partisanship. Partisanship,\u201d he said. (The word returned occasionally later in his remarks.) Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, suggested there were still sporadic conversations underway between senators about a possible deal to avert the coming maelstrom. \u201cBut nothing promising,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742561748.949738}
