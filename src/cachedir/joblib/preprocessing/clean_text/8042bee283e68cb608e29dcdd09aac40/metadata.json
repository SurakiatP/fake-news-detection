That electric blue sculpture in the lobby? You\u2019d swear it was by Jeff Koons. Over near Orlando, work has started on his $800 million family resort, which will include a   water park and 1, 200 homes priced at up to $1 million apiece. His company, which had $1. 5 billion in sales last year, is introducing a line of jewelry. He has one of America\u2019s   craft beers. A team  \u2014   led by a former Google executive  \u2014   is working to transform his digital media business. The man is Jimmy Buffett. And it\u2019s time to toss whatever you thought you knew about his lazy, hazy Margaritaville out the window. Forget the ville. This is a Margarita World. \u201cPeople are always shocked when they find out how big we\u2019ve gotten,\u201d Mr. Buffett said recently over lunch, grinning and splashing Tabasco on a modified Cobb salad. \u201cWe just kept quietly doing our thing. Not saying much. And now  \u2014   bam!  \u2014   here we are. \u201d Margaritaville, with its themed restaurants (erupting volcanoes,   booths) started as a tropical cousin to T. G. I. Friday\u2019s. Through trial and error, Mr. Buffett and a partner, John Cohlan, have since expanded Margaritaville Holdings to include four booming divisions: lodging, alcohol, licensing and media. Now, as they pursue growth for the first time overseas, where Mr. Buffett has a much softer fan base, they are trying to recast Margaritaville as a broad, aspirational brand  \u2014   the Ralph Lauren of leisurely escape, if you will. \u201cThe stroke of genius was making Margaritaville a feeling, not a place,\u201d said Mindy Grossman, the chief executive of the   behemoths HSN and Frontgate, where   Margaritaville items include a $799 hammock and $159 penny loafers. \u201cIf you don\u2019t take the name so literally, growth could be endless. \u201d Endless? \u201cO. K. not endless,\u201d Ms. Grossman said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t suggest doing fake fur coats. But almost. \u201d Mr. Buffett, patron saint of the untroubled, has long been known for his business acumen. In some ways, with his approach to concert merchandise and tour sponsorship in the 1980s, he created the model of    that managers for artists like Madonna and Dave Matthews have pursued more recently. Other singers have parlayed their personas into business empires  \u2014   Dolly Parton, for instance, with her Dollywood theme park, Dixie Stampede dinner theaters, Dolly slot machines and \u201cCoat of Many Colors\u201d merchandise  \u2014   but none are as singularly sprawling as Mr. Buffett\u2019s Margaritaville. \u201cHe understands his brand, which has a substantial reach,\u201d Warren E. Buffett, a friend (but not a relative) said by phone. \u201cOne of the secrets to his success is that he never really loses any fans. \u201d Still, a thriving brand needs to steadily recruit new devotees, and that may be Margaritaville\u2019s biggest challenge. While Mr. Buffett\u2019s fan base includes young people  \u2014   drunkenly singing along to \u201cMargaritaville\u201d in a college bar is practically an American rite of passage  \u2014   his core followers are baby boomers. How does Margaritaville make itself more relevant to people in their 30s? What fuels sales of those licensed products once Mr. Buffett, 69, has warbled his last warble? It\u2019s a subject that Mr. Cohlan, who is Margaritaville\u2019s chief executive, was not especially keen to discuss. Asked about how the company thinks about a future without its public face, Mr. Cohlan said, \u201cJimmy Buffett is an American treasure,\u201d and changed the subject. A more robust media presence beyond Mr. Buffett seems to be one answer. Last year, Mr. Cohlan expanded the company\u2019s digital media efforts, which already included a SiriusXM satellite radio channel. He hired Laura Lee from the Google ranks, where she was a senior executive at YouTube, and charged her with building a digital content studio, improving Margaritaville\u2019s social media presence and introducing mobile games. (One casual game coming in July will have users searching for their lost shaker of salt.) The goal is a fully formed ecosystem. Last year, an estimated 15 million people ate at one of Mr. Buffett\u2019s 67 restaurants or stayed at one of his seven hotels and   resorts. The company also wants the masses to buy Margaritaville food at their local grocery store (items like iced tea, frozen shrimp and tortilla chips are already on shelves) watch   videos on their phones (\u201cThe Best Beach Bars of the Caribbean\u201d is one idea in development) and maybe even sleep on Margaritaville bedsheets (in various designs, including \u201cStrawberry Daiquiri\u201d coral, starting at $19. 98). Ms. Lee\u2019s efforts could also lead to more traditional TV programming. A model is Vice Media, which began as a   video company and went on to sprout an HBO series and Viceland, a   cable channel. Not by coincidence, Margaritaville in 2014 sold a minority stake to the Raine Group, a merchant bank known for its investment in Vice and ties to the William Morris Endeavor talent agency. \u201cThe international opportunity for the Margaritaville ecosystem is really exciting,\u201d said Joe Ravitch, Raine\u2019s  . Mr. Buffett and Mr. Cohlan are   of the rest of Margaritaville. In success, could Margaritaville be a candidate for a public offering? \u201cThe brand isn\u2019t yet for everybody,\u201d said the political polling expert Douglas E. Schoen, who has conducted extensive consumer research for Margaritaville. \u201cIt\u2019s not for me, and it\u2019s not for most journalists. But it\u2019s much, much bigger than I initially thought. \u201d Mr. Schoen added, \u201cIt has the potential to be a major global brand. \u201d To understand the evolving Margaritaville, consider the   Margaritaville Hollywood Beach Resort (that\u2019s Hollywood, Fla.) which cost $190 million to build and held its grand opening in November. Relying almost entirely on word of mouth, the hotel has reached an occupancy rate of 93 percent, the lodging equivalent of a smash hit. Euphoric Margaritaville executives estimate that Parrot Heads, as Mr. Buffett\u2019s   fans are known, make up less than 50 percent of the bookings: The hotel is attracting people that Mr. Buffett was probably not reaching before. \u201cI personally sweated every freaking detail of this place for eight years,\u201d said a beaming Mr. Cohlan in March, as he held court in the hotel\u2019s   lobby, which is accented with palm trees and a lime green and turquoise carpet. \u201cHey! Good to see you!\u201d he hollered to an employee as she stopped to tell him how proud she was to work at the hotel. \u201cThank you, doll,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means the world. \u201d Located about 40 minutes north of Miami Beach, Hollywood is still Old Florida, land of grim souvenir shops, jai alai courts and   cinder block motels. And some residents worried that Mr. Buffett\u2019s arrival would make it worse. \u201cWe don\u2019t need people being wasted away in Margaritaville,\u201d Audrey Joynt, a past president of the Hollywood Beach Business Association, told The Miami Herald in 2010, as Mr. Cohlan was pushing city managers to approve the project. But Margaritaville surprised critics by building a quite upscale resort. Envisioning a hotel sound system that blares \u201cCheeseburger in Paradise\u201d until you want to lose your mind? Think again. Mr. Buffett\u2019s songs play very sparingly. In fact, his persona often seems a half step removed. Rooms, decorated with white shutters, aqua blue accents and hardwood floors, start at nearly $300 and go up to $1, 800 for oceanfront suites. The steakhouse, JWB Prime Steak and Seafood, could hold its own in Manhattan. \u201cHotel companies always make the same mistake when the budget gets tight at the end of a project,\u201d Mr. Cohlan said. \u201cThe last coat of paint gets cut. But guess what? That\u2019s what your guests see. \u201d Pat McBride, whose McBride Company designed the hotel, noted the   lobby chandelier, made from dozens of   margarita glasses. \u201cIt looks almost like Lalique,\u201d he said by phone. Go ahead and roll your eyes. But see it and you realize that he was kind of right. There is a boozy,  \u2019  \u2019 clientele, for sure. But there are also men and women in business suits  \u2014   the hotel has 30, 000 square feet of meeting space  \u2014   and guests like Lynn and Pam Wilken, visitors in their 50s from Ashkum, Ill. where they farm soybeans and run a candle business. \u201cWe don\u2019t follow Jimmy Buffett\u2019s music, but his name gave me comfort about booking a hotel online that we didn\u2019t know anything about,\u201d Mrs. Wilken said, as she lounged poolside with her husband. The couple, finishing a weeklong stay at the resort, vowed to come back, despite a caveat or two. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to wander too far down the beach, particularly at night, but that\u2019s fine with us. \u201d Mr. Wilken added: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to put your finger on, but there is something authentic about this place. It doesn\u2019t feel forced on you. \u201d That may be the biggest compliment of all. For a   lifestyle brand to flourish, it cannot feel as if it was created by a corporate focus group. That genuineness is a difficult trick to pull off, as hotel giants like Marriott and Hyatt have learned with their attempts to build   boutique chains like Edition and Andaz. \u201cWe somehow got it right,\u201d Mr. Buffett said of the Hollywood property. \u201cThank you, Baby Jesus and John Cohlan. \u201d Fittingly, the Margaritaville empire started with a nap. The year was 1996, and Mr. Cohlan, then working for the corporate raider Nelson Peltz, known for targeting companies like Snapple and Arby\u2019s, had gotten to know Mr. Buffett\u2019s wife, Jane, on the Palm Beach, Fla. society circuit. One day, Mr. Cohlan turned up at the Buffetts\u2019 home to talk about the potential growth of Margaritaville, which was then just a popular song  \u2014   released in 1977, it peaked at No. 8 on the pop charts  \u2014   and a   chainlet. But the singer was asleep. \u201cHad it not been for Jane, who went to wake Jimmy up, this extremely successful partnership might not have happened,\u201d said Richard Plepler, the chief executive of HBO, who knows both men. Asked about this anecdote, Mr. Buffett smiled sheepishly and said: \u201cI do like a good nap. That\u2019s true. \u201d Mr. Buffett opened his first Margaritaville restaurant in 1987 in Key West, Fla. It found instant success  \u2014   so much, in fact, that he opened a second location in New Orleans in 1993. But the sequel was a relative dud, and Mr. Buffett applied the brakes, rebuffing an offer from the Walt Disney Company to build a lavishly themed Margaritaville at a Walt Disney World shopping mall. Enter Mr. Cohlan. He had recently experienced the Parrot Head phenomenon for himself  \u2014   their wild tropical clothing, their endless tailgating  \u2014   and had an epiphany. \u201cAll I really knew before I went to that concert was that girls would put on halter tops and play his songs when the weather turned nice,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I saw him perform, I said to myself, \u2018Whoa. Holy   . This is a brand. \u2019\u201d Mr. Buffett took on Mr. Cohlan as a partner, and together they began to expand Margaritaville, beginning at the Universal Orlando Resort, which at that time was owned by Seagram. Mr. Buffett recalled how he told Seagram during negotiations that he had one final request: \u201cCan you just tilt that bridge a little so that people leaving your park literally roll into the front doors of my restaurant?\u201d Mr. Cohlan and Mr. Buffett cracked up recalling the look on the Seagram team\u2019s face. Just before the Orlando opening, Mr. Cohlan played hardball with Seagram over a liquor matter and inadvertently started a new line of business. Seagram, which also owned Mr. Buffett\u2019s record company then, had introduced Parrot Bay rum, which Mr. Buffett felt   his band\u2019s Parrot Head imagery. Mr. Cohlan  \u2014   quite seriously, this time  \u2014   told Seagram that Margaritaville would boycott its alcohol. In a matter of weeks, Margaritaville had its own tequila and beer brand. The theme park Margaritaville has been a runaway hit since opening in 1999. Last year, according to Mr. Cohlan, the restaurant generated about $22 million in sales. Something about Mr. Buffett\u2019s mellow, unchallenging persona seems to make parents feel O. K. about tying one on with their children in tow. \u201cBelieve me,\u201d Mr. Buffett said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know I was going to end up as family entertainment, either. \u201d Not everything has gone Margaritaville\u2019s way. For starters, that early beer, Lone Palm Lager, named after one of Mr. Buffett\u2019s songs, did not sell as they had hoped. \u201cWe only found out later, after we did consumer research to figure out what was going on, that the name bummed people out because it made them think about drinking alone,\u201d Mr. Cohlan said. They renamed it LandShark Lager, a nod to Mr. Buffett\u2019s song \u201cFins. \u201d  : Sales started to take off. The company\u2019s first resort, a planned $700 million casino and hotel in Biloxi, Miss. was delayed by the   economic collapse. Margaritaville eventually opened a much smaller hotel in Biloxi, but it went belly up, perhaps because the company picked a bad location. This month Mr. Cohlan announced a third attempt, set to open later this year. This time, there will be more of a family focus, and no casino. Eight more Margaritaville hotels, including one in Grand Cayman, are in various stages of development. Margaritaville\u2019s signature restaurant chain is expanding quickly  \u2014   it will soon push into California for the first time, opening at Universal Studios Hollywood  \u2014   but a spinoff series of restaurants in the Midwest called Cheeseburger in Paradise has struggled. Margaritaville sold its Cheeseburger stake in 2005 and, since then, roughly half the locations have closed as the brand was lobbed between owners. Still, Margaritaville has mostly had smooth sailing, building a unique corporate culture  \u2014   employees all use the same valediction in emails: \u201cFins Up!\u201d  \u2014   and drawing fanatic customers like Carol and Butch Wayland, who live in St. Catharines, Ontario. The Waylands, who own a trade school, have made it their mission to visit as many Margaritaville outposts as possible in May they plan to try their first Margaritaville at Sea, a new offering by Norwegian Cruise Line. \u201cWe\u2019re not Parrot Heads,\u201d Mrs. Wayland said. \u201cWe\u2019re just normal, everyday people who happen to be residents of the Margaritaville state of mind. \u201d Mrs. Wayland, who is in her 50s, added that she had \u201cspent a fortune\u201d on Margaritaville products, including hats,   dress shirts, shorts, clocks, coffee mugs, barware, a blender and underwear. They also have a framed photograph of themselves popping out of a    Jacuzzi, snapped at a Margaritaville location in the Caribbean. If all of this sounds like maybe Mrs. Wayland sometimes has one margarita too many, she wouldn\u2019t entirely disagree. \u201cThat too!\u201d she said. \u201cI once fell off a bar stool at the Margaritaville in Turks and Caicos and landed right in the water. Kerplop. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562208.287297}
