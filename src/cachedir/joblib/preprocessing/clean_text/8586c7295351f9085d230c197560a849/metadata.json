[\u201cWe\u2019re defined by a commitment to common values, political values, the rule of law, democracy, freedom, mutual respect, equality for men and women,\u201d Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told the media on Thursday, where he described the reformed vetting process:  our citizenship process should reflect that. So today we are announcing changes to strengthen citizenship, to make for a stronger Australia, stronger citizenship, stronger citizen   \u2026      before you apply to be a citizen. You will need to have competent English. That is a vital requirement   \u2026     also, we need to ensure that our citizenship test enables applicants to demonstrate how they have integrated into and engaged with our Australian community, so that they\u2019re part of the community. They\u2019ve lived here as a permanent resident for four years, they speak English, share our values, be integrated. Those are critically important elements. I believe that they will be empowering for applicants. This will be good for the applicants, good for the nation, underlining our Australian values at the very heart of Australian citizenship, Australian citizenship is the foundation of our democracy  \u2026     these political values are what bind us together. That\u2019s what keeps us together in the midst of our diversity. The new Australian push is a   from 2016, when Trump championed immigration reform in the United States, while Turnbull sought to stabilize his government after he staged an internal party vote in September 2015 to take the Prime Minister\u2019s job from his own party\u2019s leader, Tony Abbott, an immigration hawk who entirely blocked and stopped a seaborne wave of immigrants from reaching Australia. To some extent, Turnbull\u2019s flip towards   position is designed to help his   wing of the party from Abbot\u2019s   wing of the party, and from the growing support being given to Pauline Hanson\u2018s nationalist One Nation Party, which is skeptical about Islam\u2019s ability to integrate into Australian society. In 2016 and before, Turnbull repeatedly endorsed immigration, invited additional refugees, and told the parliament in October 2016 that \u201ceveryone sitting in this chamber and every Australian is a beneficiary of the diversity that is at the heart of our nation   \u2026     the most effective weapon against the [Muslim] terrorists is an inclusive nation. \u201d Amid rising violence and welfare use among immigrant Muslims, a September 2016 poll showed that half of all Australians want to block Muslim immigration, which is strongly supported by business groups which profit from the inflow of extra consumers and   workers. Turnbull\u2019s minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Peter Dutton, told reporters at the press conference that   immigrants will have to take an upgraded written test: There will be further tests, further questions placed in the test as it currently operates, and there will be the opportunity for people to comment on some of these changes over the course of the next, over the course of the period between now and 1 June. So we will consult around the questions around the values issues and we can provide further detail. There is also change to be made to the pledge and, again, we\u2019ll consult on that particular issue as well. So I\u2019ll leave it there. For example, domestic violence, a perpetrator of domestic violence. My view is that that person shouldn\u2019t become an Australian citizen. And we can ask that question but we can also undertake our own checks in relation to police checks or whatever the case might be. So that\u2019s how you can adopt, apply the test. On the 2016 campaign trail, and in his Executive Orders since his inauguration, President Donald Trump has called for a new process of \u201cextreme vetting\u201d   refugees and legal immigrants  \u2014   especially Muslim immigrants  \u2014   into the United States. For example, his January 27 Executive Order on immigration declared that his policy would be to exclude people with \u201cHostile attitudes\u201d: In order to protect Americans, the United States must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles. The United States cannot, and should not, admit those who do not support the Constitution, or those who would place violent ideologies over American law. In addition, the United States should not admit those who engage in acts of bigotry or hatred (including \u201chonor\u201d killings, other forms of violence against women, or the persecution of those who practice religions different from their own) or those who would oppress Americans of any race, gender, or sexual orientation. The alliance of   judges, progressives, and Islamic political groups are fiercely opposing any new tests, even though the existing immigration and citizenship process already includes questions and tests designed to exclude people who were terrorists or members of the Nazi or Soviet communist parties. The current immigration document also includes a requirement stemming from the 1775 war of independence which requires immigrant aristocrats to formal give up their noble titles before becoming citizens. If U. S. immigrants lie in their documents, they can be stripped of their citizenship and repatriated. For example, U. S. officials have deported several immigrants who lied about their work for Adolf Hitler\u2019s National Socialist party in World War II. U. S. officials have not said anything about the plans for upgrading the immigration tests and vetting, partly because Trump has not yet been able to get many of his   nominees confirmed by the Senate. But Homeland Security John Kelly may be a strong backer of an upgraded test, and told a D. C. audience on Tuesday that \u201cwe have a sacred duty and that is the continuation of the United States as we know it: To protect our way of life and the exceptional people we are. \u201d Australia\u2019s reform government has an easier task than Trump, who must overcome roadblocks built by progressive judges, media and Democratic legislator and Democratic legislatures in a   federal government for 330 million people. In contrast, Australia\u2019s parliamentary system allows a majority government to easily pass its agenda for the nation of 25 million people. Throughout the April 19 Australian press conference, the journalists and politicians tacitly recognized the problems created by the immigration of Islamic adherents who bring their peculiar institutions and values which endorse domestic violence against women, child marriage, \u2018Female Genital Mutilation,\u2019 and reject the authority of what Australians describe as \u201csecular law. \u201d For example, one reporter cited several of Islam\u2019s peculiar practices before asking \u201cPrime Minister, I\u2019m not clear why practices such as female genital mutilation, forcing children to marry and what have you, how they\u2019re being or could be included in values questions when they\u2019re already illegal under Australian law.  What\u2019s the need for a values question when it\u2019s illegal under Australians law, Australian law? that \u201cthese values [in the test] aren\u2019t really enforceable outside of the law. If someone passes a test and says, \u201cTick, yes I don\u2019t beat my wife. Tick, I know who [cricket player] Another journalist scoffed at the test, saying \u201cthese values [in the test] aren\u2019t really enforceable outside of the law. If someone passes a test and says, \u201cTick, yes I don\u2019t beat my wife. Tick, I know who [cricket player] Don Bradman is. I\u2019m an Australian citizen\u201d And then they don\u2019t express Australian values, what happens?\u201d Turnbull pushed back, saying: But the point is, what [the current written test] doesn\u2019t go to or doesn\u2019t go to sufficiently are those questions of values and at the heart, at the very heart of our success is mutual respect respect for each other, respect for people of different faiths and different cultures and respect of women and children. That is, you know as I\u2019ve, you\u2019ve often heard me say this. You know, not all disrespecting women, disrespecting women ends up in violence against women but that\u2019s where all violence against women begins. So this is a very important, very important Australian values respect, mutual respect, respect for women and children and that is going to be, that is a key Australian value, who would argue with that?  Is it reflected in our current process? No it\u2019s not, it should be.  On April 17, Turnbull announced his party would reform the \u201c457\u201d visa program, which allowed Australian companies to bring in foreign workers for skilled and unskilled jobs throughout Australia. The 457 visa will be replaced by a narrower visa program that will only be used to bring in workers who cannot be found in Australia and who can integrate Australian society, he said. That push is also similar to Trump\u2019s effort to revamp the unpopular     outsourcing program. Echoing Trump\u2019s \u201cBuy American, Hire American\u201d theme, Turnbull said that the goal os his reform is \u201cAustralian jobs for Australians first   \u2026     this is all about Australians\u2019 interst, this is about jobs for Australians. \u201d The new program will have a \u201c  focus on Australia\u2019s interests,\u201d he said.  \u201cWe\u2019re putting Australians first   \u2026     Australian workers must have priority for Australian jobs,\u201d he said.
