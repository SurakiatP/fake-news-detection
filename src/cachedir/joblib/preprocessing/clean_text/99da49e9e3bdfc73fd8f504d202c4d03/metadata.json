The president\u2019s son reportedly became \u201cpanicked\u201d over the photo because he did not know who Griffin was or the context in which the photo was taken.  \u201cAs a mother, a wife, and a human being, that photo is very disturbing,\u201d Melania Trump said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cWhen you consider some of the atrocities happening in the world today, a photo opportunity like this is simply wrong and makes you wonder about the mental health of the person who did it. \u201d The photograph, first published by TMZ Tuesday morning, shows the    My Life on the   comedian holding up a bloody, decapitated head meant to resemble that of the president, in a photograph reminiscent of horrific pictures taken by Islamic State terrorists to celebrate their atrocities. The photo was taken during a shoot with L. A.  artist Tyler Shields. The image went viral Tuesday, drawing strong condemnation from both sides of the political aisle as well as thousands of calls for a boycott of Griffin\u2019s current   comedy tour. The president responded Wednesday, saying the proliferation of the photograph had been particularly hard on his children, including Barron. Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself. My children, especially my 11 year old son, Barron, are having a hard time with this. Sick!  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 31, 2017,  The image also reportedly led the U. S. Secret Service to open an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the photo shoot. Griffin apologized in a video posted to her Twitter account Tuesday, saying the image had gone \u201ctoo far. \u201d I am sorry.  I went too far.  I was wrong. pic. twitter.   \u2014   Kathy Griffin (@kathygriffin) May 30, 2017,  \u201cI\u2019m a comic. I cross the line. I move the line, then I cross it. I went way too far,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cThe image is too disturbing. I understand how it offends people. It wasn\u2019t funny. I get it. I\u2019ve made a lot of mistakes in my career, I will continue. \u201d The apology apparently did little to quell outrage over the image. On Tuesday, CNN  \u2014   where Griffin has   a live New Year\u2019s Eve broadcast with Anderson Cooper since 2007  \u2014   said it was \u201cevaluating\u201d the comedian\u2019s role in its future broadcasts. Home security services company ADT also announced that it would pull its advertising from the network over the incident. On Wednesday, the Route 66 Casino in Albuquerque announced that Griffin\u2019s upcoming show, scheduled for June 16, had been cancelled.
