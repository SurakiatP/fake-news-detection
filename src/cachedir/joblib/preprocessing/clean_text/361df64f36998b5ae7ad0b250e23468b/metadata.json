[Professor Carlos Marcial Torres created a new mobile app game based on the classic hit Tetris. The app is titled, \u201cStop the Wall. \u201d He opens the game with a screen depicting President Trump.   \u201cThe game is \u2018reactionary.\u2019 Reacting to Trump\u2019s xenophobic, racist and hate phrases and thoughts. We use technology to combat all that,\u201d Torres, 33, Al Dia reported. Torres added many \u201cTrump phrases\u201d into the game, and at one point he adds, \u201cThe wall just got 10 feet taller,\u201d followed by, \u201cI would build a great wall and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me. \u201d The game is distributed both on iTunes and Google Play. Google says the game has been downloaded to Android devices between 100 and 500 times, while Apple does not indicate the number of downloads. Apple does say the app has not received enough ratings to have a displayed average rating. The game\u2019s description on the download page states: Finally, a game based on a classic block puzzle where you have to stop Donald Trump\u2019s Wall of Infamy. Have fun while being socially conscious. Compete against your friends to see who can #StopTheWall longer. Share your high scores with all the people in your social networks. Invite your friends (and even Donald Trump) to try and beat your high score.  Torres continues, saying, \u201cThe immigration issue is one of the most important and significant of the moment, and Trump is one of the most followed guys in the world. \u201d He said people from countries all over the world have been downloading his app. Those include Taiwan, Australia, the U. S. Mexico, China, Norway and the United Kingdom. The professor claims he also built the app to protest the lack of economic support of local filmmakers by the Puerto Rican government. Torres ends the game with more \u201cTrumpisms,\u201d and a score screen stating \u201c#MakeAmericaMexicoAgain. \u201d \u201cBuild that wall, build that wall, build that wall\u201d and \u201cMexico will pay for the wall, and they\u2019re going to be happy about it,\u201d players hear when signing out of the app. Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.
