Lloyd Blankfein, CEO of Goldman Sachs, is greeted by Hillary Clinton at a panel discussion at the Clinton Global Initiative, Sept. 24, 2014 in New York. \\nPublished in partnership with Shadowproof . \\nHe\u2019s with her. On Sunday, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton earned the endorsement of Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein \u2014an endorsement she had been working toward for years. \\nAs was revealed by Wikileaks, Hillary Clinton spent the run up to her presidential campaign giving speeches to Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks, where she praised their talents and explained her positions on financial regulation. \\nOn October 24, 2013, Clinton told Goldman Sachs that Dodd-Frank had to be done mostly for \u201cpolitical reasons\u201d because Congress needed to look like it was doing something about the crisis. She said, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing magic about regulations, too much is bad, too little is bad. How do you get to the golden key, how do we figure out what works? And the people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry.\u201d \\nYes, she essentially endorsed Wall Street writing the rules because Wall Street knows its business best and complained to Goldman Sachs that regulations had frightened bankers. \\n\u201cI mean, right now, there are so many places in our country where the banks are not doing what they need to do because they\u2019re scared of regulations, they\u2019re scared of the other shoe dropping, they\u2019re just plain scared, so credit is not flowing the way it needs to to restart economic growth,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cSo people are, you know, a little \u2014 they\u2019re still uncertain, and they\u2019re uncertain both because they don\u2019t know what might come next in terms of regulations, but they\u2019re also uncertain because of changes in a global economy that we\u2019re only beginning to take hold of.\u201d \\nMusic to Wall Street\u2019s ears. For Goldman Sachs, was there really any other choice this cycle? After all, they did pay Hillary Clinton $675,000 for those three speeches, and have generously supported her political career. \\nDespite her private comments to Goldman Sachs, Hillary Clinton has taken a tough public position on Wall Street during the campaign, likely due to Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019 success in the primaries. Of course, Wikileaks also revealed that Clinton told the National Multi-housing Council in a private speech that \u201cyou need both a public and a private position.\u201d \\nSo the real question is, what do Blankfein and Goldman want in return and what is Clinton\u2019s private position on giving it to them?
