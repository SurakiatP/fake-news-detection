Trump on Twitter over the weekend that showed a photo of Mrs. Clinton against a backdrop of $100 bills and a Star of David was \u201cblatantly  . \u201d The post accused Mrs. Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, of being the \u201cmost corrupt candidate ever. \u201d But critics seized on the episode as the latest example of a longtime pattern of racially charged remarks by Mr. Trump, saying the post was meant to exploit stereotypes against Jewish people. In a rebuke on Tuesday, the House speaker, Paul Ryan, said in a radio interview with Charlie Sykes on WTMJ in Milwaukee, according to The Hill website: \u201cLook,   images, they\u2019ve got no place in a presidential campaign. Candidates should know that. \u201d Mr. Ryan added, \u201cI really believe he\u2019s got to clean up how his new media works. \u201d The backlash has been swift enough to cause Mr. Trump to do something relatively out of character: He deleted the original post, later sharing an image showing Mrs. Clinton next to a circle instead of the   star. The news website Mic traced the first image, posted by Mr. Trump on Saturday, to a message board containing   and   imagery, and to Twitter accounts that circulated the images. Sarah Bard, the Clinton campaign\u2019s director of Jewish outreach, said in a statement: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s use of a blatantly   image from racist websites to promote his campaign would be disturbing enough, but the fact that it\u2019s a part of a pattern should give voters major cause for concern. Now, not only won\u2019t he apologize for it, he\u2019s peddling lies and blaming others. \u201d Though he replaced the image (one observer noted that the tips of the star were still visible in the new post) Mr. Trump took to Twitter on Monday to defend his original decision to post the image with a star. \u201cDishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the Star of David rather than a Sheriff\u2019s Star, or plain star!\u201d he wrote. In a statement released on Monday night, Mr. Trump dismissed Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign\u2019s criticism as \u201cfalse\u201d and \u201cridiculous\u201d and repeated his claim that the image was a \u201cbasic star often used by sheriffs who deal with criminals and criminal behavior. \u201d But some social media users have disputed Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion, with one person asking why would he delete a posting if he truly believed it was a sheriff\u2019s star. Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters have insisted that the image never contained a Star of David and that people were being too sensitive or politically correct. Corey Lewandowski, Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, appeared on Sunday on CNN and called the reaction \u201cpolitical correctness run amok. \u201d Other Trump supporters said on Twitter that the news media was exploiting a nonissue. They said they supported the theory that those accusing Mr. Trump of   were creating a fictional subtext for the image. \u201cThe only reason the Trump sheriff star tweet is controversial is because CNN makes it that way,\u201d wrote one supporter of Mr. Trump. But white nationalists, including the former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, weighed in with praise for the tweet: The   League has long condemned Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks on immigrants as hate speech and stereotyping. It called on him in 2015 to stop \u201cfomenting hatred. \u201d On Monday, Jonathan Greenblatt, the group\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview that Mr. Trump\u2019s handling of the controversy over the posting did not pass muster. \u201cThe most appropriate response to the criticisms would be to address them   to apologize, and to articulate firmly and forcefully that bigotry of any sort has no place in this campaign, and that hate has nothing to do with making America great again,\u201d Mr. Greenblatt said. Mr. Trump seemed eager on Monday to move beyond the episode. He posted a flurry of messages about his potential choices for a   running mate: \u201cThe only people who are not interested in being the V. P. pick are the people who have not been asked!\u201d He then wrote a post that blamed radical Islam for terrorist attacks.'"}, "time": 1742628558.770955}
