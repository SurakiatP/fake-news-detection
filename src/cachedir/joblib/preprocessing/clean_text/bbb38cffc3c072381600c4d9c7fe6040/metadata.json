Trump said: \\n\u201cWhen Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best. They\u2019re sending people that have lots of problems. They\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists. I will build a great wall \u2013 and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me \u2013 and I\u2019ll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.\u201d \\nFor saying that, one business after another severed their ties with Trump. Univision and Comcast\u2019s NBCUniversal cancelled plans to broadcast Trump\u2019s Miss Universe beauty pageant. Mattress giant Serta said it will stop selling Trump-branded products. Department store giant Macy\u2019s also cut its ties with Trump. \\nSuch righteous indignation! You would think Trump were a heinous mass murderer or a child-molester or serial rapist or bestialist! \\nBut Macy\u2019s anti-Trump move has backfired. \\nTMZ reports, July 13, 2015: \\nMacy\u2019s is paying the price for sacking Donald Trump, because we\u2019ve learned thousands of customers are cutting up their Macy\u2019s credit card in protest. \\nSources connected to the department store tell TMZ, Macy\u2019s has received complaints from approximately 30,000 customers since ending its relationship with Trump nearly 2 weeks ago. \\nWe\u2019re told the store has been \u201cinundated with complaints\u201d from customers who believe the department store is unfairly punishing Trump for his views on immigration. \\nOur sources say thousands of customers have vowed never to shop at Macy\u2019s again and many of them say they\u2019re cutting up their Macy\u2019s credit card to make a statement. \\nWe\u2019re told the complaints have come in various ways, including phone, Facebook and email. A Macy\u2019s spokesperson would only say, \u201cOur Facebook page is often times used by our customers to express their feelings or points of view. Many times it does not correlate to any action.\u201d Join the boycott against Macy\u2019s!'"}, "time": 1742563953.7155626}
