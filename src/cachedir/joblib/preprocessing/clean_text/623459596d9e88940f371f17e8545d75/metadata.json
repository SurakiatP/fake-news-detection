[The Wrap introduced the film  \u2014   which   Goldie Hawn as Schumer\u2019s mother  \u2014   by writing: \u201cFox released a new trailer this morning for May movie Snatched, which features the two funnywomen going all   on a bunch of kidnappers. And this time, they\u2019ve got a gun. \u201d   \u201cYou messed with the wrong b*tches,\u201d Schumer tells a man toward the end of the trailer as she trains a gun on him. Schumer only holds a gun in one scene in the trailer, but that may be one scene more than her fans were expecting. After all, Schumer took up the gun control cause with particular passion following the shooting deaths of two moviegoers at a showing of her movie Trainwreck in Lafayette, Louisiana. The shooting occurred in a   theater on July 23, 2015, and the alleged gunman passed a background check to acquire the firearm used in the attack. Yet Schumer emerged from the episode by pushing for increased gun control measures  \u2014  especially background checks. In August 2015, the actress partnered with her cousin, Senator Chuck Schumer ( ) to push for more gun control and later used an appearance at the Glamour Awards to advocate for tighter gun laws. In January 2016, Schumer spoke out on the topic again at the Critics\u2019 Choice Awards. Now she is using a gun in her upcoming film. It is interesting to note that Schumer upped the size of her personal security force, even as she campaigned for gun control for everyday Americans. In September, she assured fellow actress Lena Dunham that she had increased the size of her security team, saying, \u201cSecurity is up. I\u2019m really trying to protect myself. I am not being an idiot. \u201d Snatched centers on a mother and daughter who are kidnapped while on a bonding trip to Ecuador and who must fight to survive the ordeal. Twentieth Century Fox releases the film nationwide on Mother\u2019s Day.
