Those currently frothing at the mouth about the dawn of a new golden age of peace and equality really should know better. A billionaire and friend of billionaires just won an election. 1789 it isn\u2019t. \\nBut Clinton would have blown up the world. Trump probably won\u2019t. Which makes the current situation a very tiny, possibly temporary, but still vanishingly rare moment of sanity in a largely insane world. For that small reason alone sane people everywhere should welcome it for what it is. \\nSo, what to make of those who don\u2019t? \\nHysteria. Fainting. Screaming. Pseudo-Leftists happy to support Obama\u2019s imperialism and domestic tyranny, beating their chests and seeking counselling for PTSD because democracy happened. \u201cMass\u201d riots of thousands (or is it only hundreds? Depends on your source) of outraged identity-politicians. \\nWhat do these protesters think they are protesting? \\nFascism? Well, ok, but where were they during the past sixteen years during which America has been dragged by inches into becoming the proto-facist state it now is? Besides what is more fascist-populist that using riot and civil unrest to overturn a democratic vote? \\nRacism? Sexism? Climate-denial? Which of these offenses is worse than nuclear war? And where is it written in the US constitution that they justify the reversal of an election? \\nAnd what about those alt news types supporting the \u201cprotesters\u201d? Do they agree with Change.org that the vote should be overturned by the electoral college and Clinton given the presidency because she has a vagina and her chums can mobilise mass-hysteria? Are they basically saying they were for Hillary all along, because the Pentagon and Wall Street and WW3 are the lesser of two evils? \\nIf that\u2019s not what they are saying, then what? Protest needs an aim, so what is the aim here? More Obama? Martial Law? Total societal disintegration? \\nAll better than Trump? \\nWould be great to get some feedback here.
