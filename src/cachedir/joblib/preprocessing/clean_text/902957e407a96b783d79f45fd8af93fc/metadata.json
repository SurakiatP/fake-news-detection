[Using \u201cpeople familiar with the matter\u201d as sources, the Post\u2019s Devlin Barrett and Matt Zapotosky report that the investigation into the Trump campaign and its connections to Russia \u201chas identified a current White House official as a significant person of interest, showing that the probe is reaching the highest levels of government. \u201d  The person is a senior White House adviser \u201cclose to the president,\u201d but the unnamed sources would not identify that official, the Post reported. \u201cThe sources emphasized that investigators remain keenly interested in people who previously wielded influence in the Trump campaign and administration but are no longer part of it, including former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort,\u201d the Post reported. However, the story says, \u201cpeople familiar with the investigation said the intensifying effort does not mean criminal charges are near, or that any such charges will result. \u201d White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer emphasized the lack of evidence of collusion in a statement responding to the Post\u2019s story. \u201cAs the President has stated before  \u2014   a thorough investigation will confirm that there was no collusion between the campaign and any foreign entity,\u201d the statement said. The Post published this story as President Donald Trump is on his way to Saudi Arabia on the first leg of multiple state visits, his first trip abroad since he took office. Earlier this week, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III to serve as special counsel and lead the investigation going forward.
