With just 1, 354 days until the next presidential election, Mr. Trump kicked off his   campaign here on Saturday with a boisterous,        rally that lacked only an opponent for him to run against. Gathering thousands of cheering supporters inside an airport hangar, Mr. Trump put aside the stress of Washington governing and returned to the campaign trail, where he reprised many of his   themes and lines from last year and drank in the adulation of the crowd. Buoyant and energized, he invited one fan onto the stage for a hug and even briefly turned over the microphone. \u201cYou\u2019re all part of this incredible movement, this movement that we talk about so much, that\u2019s been written about on the cover of every magazine all over the world,\u201d Mr. Trump said in this Space Coast town 115 miles north of his    getaway. \u201cIt\u2019s a moment that\u2019s just sweeping, it\u2019s sweeping across our country. It\u2019s sweeping, frankly, across the globe. \u201d \u201cPeople want to take back control of their countries,\u201d he added, \u201cand they want to take back control of their lives. \u201d With no Democratic challengers on the horizon  \u2014   or anywhere near it  \u2014   only a month after he took office, Mr. Trump focused instead on another favorite target, the news media, blaming journalists for any perception that his opening days in office have been less than smooth. \u201cThey have their own agenda, and their agenda is not your agenda,\u201d he told the appreciative audience. \u201cThey could not defeat us in the primaries, and they could not defeat us in the general election, and we will continue to expose them for what they are, and most important, we will continue to win, win, win. \u201d He also assailed the appeals court judges who blocked his temporary travel ban, reading from a law granting the president wide discretion in setting immigration rules and chastising the court for not addressing it. He slammed Democrats for opposing his cabinet nominations vowed again to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d of Washington and promoted his   plans for overhauling the tax code, repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, and building roads and bridges. \u201cThis will be change for the ages, change like never before, to pursue real peace, real stability and real prosperity,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to secure our borders and protect our workers, to rebuild our military and our infrastructure, to fix our schools and restore safety to our neighborhoods. \u201d He boasted about the soaring stock market and said a new spirit was evident in the country. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a new day in America,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be proud again. Jobs are already starting to pour back in. \u201d For anyone who has missed the buzz of the campaign trail, including, almost certainly, the victorious candidate, it was a blast from the    past. Vendors sold the signature \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d red baseball caps. Supporters cheerfully chanted \u201cCNN sucks\u201d and \u201cdrain the swamp. \u201d Familiar rally songs by Elton John, the Rolling Stones and other artists were blasted over the loudspeakers. Mr. Trump talked about winning and assured the crowd that they could \u201cbelieve me. \u201d This time, though, he came with an extra prop  \u2014   Air Force One. The power and prestige of the presidency is unmatched, and when the    plane rolled up next to the hangar to the theme song from the Harrison Ford movie \u201cAir Force One,\u201d the crowd, estimated by the local police to have numbered about 9, 000, exploded. The president and Melania Trump  \u2014   who later introduced her husband with the Lord\u2019s Prayer  \u2014   emerged from the plane to Lee Greenwood\u2019s \u201cGod Bless the U. S. A. \u201d Never mind that an administration official had told The Washington Post two days earlier that Air Force One would not be \u201cused in the background as a prop. \u201d Mr. Trump was hardly the first president to do so. The difference is that most presidents are eager to appear to remain above politics for as long as possible. Mr. Trump, by contrast, filed his   papers on Inauguration Day. Asked by reporters on Air Force One as he flew here whether it was a little early to get back into campaign mode, he said: \u201cLife is a campaign. Making our country great again is a campaign. For me, it\u2019s a campaign to make America great again is absolutely a campaign. \u201d The fan Mr. Trump called onstage was Gene Huber, 47, of Boynton Beach, Fla. He was sitting directly in front of Mr. Trump, who said he had seen Mr. Huber speaking in support of him on television. At Mr. Trump\u2019s invitation, Mr. Huber spoke at the lectern for about 40 seconds. In an interview on Saturday night, Mr. Huber, who grew up in Lake Ronkonkoma, on Long Island, said when Mr. Trump called him to the stage, \u201cI was like, \u2018Holy mackerel, this is happening. \u2019\u201d Mr. Huber, a Republican who arrived for the rally at 4 a. m. said of Mr. Trump, \u201cEverything he says, I know he\u2019s going to do. \u201d It was clearly an energizing moment for a president who has shaken up Washington with a flurry of action on his campaign promises while absorbing significant setbacks. For all the enthusiasm in the hangar, Mr. Trump is struggling to win over the wider public. As of Friday, the Gallup poll put his approval rating at 38 percent, the lowest of any modern president so early in his tenure. Near the hangar, protesters yelled slogans and waved signs. At the end of his speech, Mr. Trump was clearly reading from prepared text as he talked about unity. \u201cLet us move past the differences of party and find a new loyalty rooted deeply in our country,\u201d he said. But he was at his most animated when in competitive mode. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start winning again,\u201d he said. \u201cBelieve me. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562106.455723}
