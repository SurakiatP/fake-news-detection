Attorney General Jeff Sessions explained to host Sean Hannity how border security has changed since President Donald Trump took office nearly three months ago.  Sessions went on to add it was the intention of the Trump administration to send the message the border was not open. \u201c[C]an you believe that we have had the lowest number of entrances at the border in 17 years? This is the direct result of Donald Trump\u2019s strong, clear leadership. It has an impact. The most important thing for us is to send a message to the world that the border is not open. Please don\u2019t come. You will be apprehended if you do come, and you will be deported promptly. And if you\u2019re a criminal, you\u2019ll be prosecuted. And if you assault our officers, we\u2019re going to come at you with a ton of bricks. This is the kind of message we need to send. It is already being sent. It is having a dramatic effect so far. I knew strong presidential leadership unlike the   we\u2019ve seen in the past would impact the flow, but not as much as we\u2019ve seen already. The numbers are down 70 percent since President Obama left office. It is really a remarkable achievement. \u201d (  RCP Video) Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor'"}, "time": 1742628488.785842}
