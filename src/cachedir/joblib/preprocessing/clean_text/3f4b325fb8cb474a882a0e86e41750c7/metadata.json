The group is celebrating the failed GOP American Health Care Act (AHCA) which did not fully repeal Obamacare and which also contained a provision to defund the abortion giant for one year. Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie (R) who changed his vote against the AHCA from \u201cNo\u201d to \u201cHell No,\u201d also emphasized the   nature of the provision to defund Planned Parenthood: I take it GOP leadership still hasn\u2019t told Trump the PP provision was a 1yr bait and switch?
