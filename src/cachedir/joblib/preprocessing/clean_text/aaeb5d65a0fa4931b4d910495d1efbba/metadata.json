The energy company accepted millions from a Vladimir   Russian government fund. [Podesta joined the executive board of Joule Unlimited Technologies  \u2014   a firm partly financed by Putin\u2019s Russia  \u2014   in June 2011 and received 100, 000 shares of stock options, according to an email uncovered by WikiLeaks. Podesta\u2019s membership on the board of directors of Joule Unlimited was first revealed in research from Breitbart News Senior    and Government Accountability Institute (GAI) President Peter Schweizer.  Podesta never disclosed his position on Joule Unlimited\u2019s board of directors and failed to include the stock payout in his federal financial disclosures, as required by law, before he became President Obama\u2019s senior adviser in January 2014  \u2014   a possible violation for federal law, according to the Daily Caller News Foundation\u2019s Investigative Group (TheDCNF). \u201cWell Podesta should certainly have been more upfront in filling this out. Clearly, it should have been fully disclosed,\u201d Craig Holman, a lobbyist Public Citizen told TheDCNF. \u201cThat\u2019s the point of the personal financial disclosure forms, especially for anyone entering the White House. \u201d \u201cIf the transfer of stock took place, it had to be disclosed,\u201d added former U. S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova in an interview. \u201cIf he didn\u2019t, clearly it\u2019s a violation. \u201d Indeed, Podesta had his Joule shares of stock options transferred to his daughter, Megan Rouse. \u201cFull transfer request, with Megan\u2019s signature attached,\u201d Podesta\u2019s assistant Eryn Sepp wrote to him on December 31, 2013  \u2014   just weeks before Podesta joined the Obama administration. A January 3, 2014, letter revealed that Podesta designated his daughter\u2019s Dublin, California, residence as the address for Leonidio Holdings LLC, the   holding company that Podesta used to transfer his shares in   Joule Global Holdings. Rouse is listed as \u201cmanaging member\u201d of Leonidio Holdings LLC, according to financial documents. TheDCNF reports that Podesta was required by law to disclose the aforementioned financial information. His failure to do so may have been illegal: The Schedule B section of the federal government\u2019s form 278 which  \u2014   requires financial disclosures for government officials  \u2014   required Podesta to \u201creport any purchase, sale or exchange by you, your spouse, or dependent children   \u2026     of any property, stocks, bonds, commodity futures and other securities when the amount of the transaction exceeded $1, 000. \u201d Podesta\u2019s form 278 Schedule B is blank regarding his receipt of any stock from any company. \u201cI think in this case where you\u2019re talking about foreign interests and foreign involvement, the collateral interest with these disclosure forms is put in the forefront of full disclosure of any foreign interest that you may have,\u201d said Ron Hosko, a former FBI assistant director. \u201cIt\u2019s a troubled question if you deliberately omit this information on the form,\u201d Hosko said, adding that Russian funding could have easily \u201cbecome a counterintelligence concern for America. \u201d Last week, Rep. Louie Gohmert called for a federal probe into Podesta\u2019s Russian ties. The new revelations come amid a partisan push to link President Donald Trump and his aides to Russian   and collusion during the presidential campaign.
