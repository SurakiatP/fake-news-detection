The probe is set to check if any of the texts are related to the reopened investigation of the former secretary of state\u2019s private email use. \\nThe authorization came two days after FBI Director James Comey finally revealed the existence of the emails stash which was reportedly discovered by the agency in early October. \\n\u201c The process has begun, \u201d a federal law enforcement official told the New York Times. \\nThe new emails were discovered as part of a separate \u2018sexting\u2019 probe into former Representative Anthony Weiner (D-New York). His electronic devices were seized during that investigation. \\nAbedin claims she has no knowledge of any of her emails being on the electronic device belonging to her husband, CBS News has learned on Sunday. A source told the network that newly-discovered emails belonged to Weiner, not his wife, who left her husband earlier this year over his sexting addiction. \\nClinton\u2019s longtime aide is allegedly cooperating with the investigation and \u201c seemed surprised that the emails were there, \u201d according to the CBS source. \\nOn Friday, FBI Director Comey announced that due to new findings, the criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server had been reopened, as he sent a letter notifying Congress of the email review. \\nThe review, which is likely to take weeks, will seek to determine whether any of those messages are work-related, and whether they include either classified information or important new evidence in the probe aimed to check whether Clinton\u2019s actions undermined US national security. \u2018I can\u2019t predict how long this will take us to complete\u2019\u2013 Comey on reopening Clinton email investigation https://t.co/6SJJAU349V pic.twitter.com/EjuwwFENZ8 \\n\u2014 RT America (@RT_America) 28 October 2016 \\nThe unexpected announcement came just over a week before Americans head to the polls to determine the winner in the race for the White House between Democrat Clinton and Republican Donald Trump. Even though some of those emails passed through Clinton\u2019s private server and could be duplicates of the information already handled by the FBI as part of the previous investigation, the probe is unlikely to wrap up before November 8. \\nConcerned by the FBI\u2019s move to relaunch the investigation so close to the election date, US Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid on Sunday sent a letter to the FBI director hinting that Comey had violated the Hatch Act, which bars the use of an executive branch position to influence an election. \\n\u201c Through your partisan actions, you may have broken the law, \u201d Reid, a senator from Nevada, said in the letter to Comey. \\nClinton campaign chairman John Podesta and campaign manager Robby Mook also questioned the legality of the FBI\u2019s actions. Comey\u2019s letter to Congress was \u201c long on innuendo, short on facts, \u201d Podesta told CNN\u2019s State of the Union. \u201c We are calling on Mr. Comey to come forward and explain what\u2019s at issue here, \u201d Podesta said, adding the significance of the emails was unclear. \\nIn the meantime, the NYT reported that senior Justice Department officials vowed to make all resources available to conduct the investigation as quickly as possible. \\nIn July the FBI\u2019s long investigation of Clinton\u2019s private email use during her time as secretary of state ended without any charges.'"}, "time": 1742562445.6649795}
