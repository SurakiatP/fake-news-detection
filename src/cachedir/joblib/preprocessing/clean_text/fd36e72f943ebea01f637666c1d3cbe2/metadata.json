After receiving a Women of the Year award from Glamour magazine, the U2 singer feels he is the best person to explain the challenges of being a vagina owner. Bono said: \u201cBeing a woman gives me insights men don\u2019t have, like how it\u2019s more expensive to get your hair cut and the soreness caused by having a baby come out of your fanny. \u201cThe new album, simply titled Woman , is about things like me getting shouted at by horny builders and sitting down to do a wee only to find there is wee on the toilet seat, as related in the protest song (There Is Wee) On The Toilet Seat . \u201cWe\u2019ve got some hard-hitting songs like The River Runs Red , about those terrible period pains that make you curl up on the sofa watching Hollyoaks while eating a whole Swiss roll. \u201cTo experience the full oppression of women I\u2019ve been getting Edge and the boys to criticise my reverse parking, even through I am a genius at driving.\u201d However Glamour magazine editor Nikki Hollis said: \u201cThis is all a big misunderstanding, there was a mistake at the trophy factory and some of ours got mixed up with the Bellend of the Century Awards.\u201d \\nShare:'"}, "time": 1742563672.3850305}
