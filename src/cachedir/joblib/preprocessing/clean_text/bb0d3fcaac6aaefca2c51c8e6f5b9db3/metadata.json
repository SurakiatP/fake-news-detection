The Anti-Doping Administration & Management System (ADAMS) has started to malfunction in the wake of hacker attacks, spokesperson of Russia\u2019s Federal Medical and Biological Agency Veronika Loginova told the All-Russian Athlete Forum. \\n\u201cRecently ADAMS has frequently been glitching because of hacker attacks,\u201d she said. \u201cBut athletes have an opportunity to report this fact by sending an email to the address available on the WADA and the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) websites. This email will serve as an excuse, if athletes fail to register in the ADAMS system. \\nADAMS is a web-based database management system that coordinates anti-doping activities worldwide under the World Anti-Doping Code. Each athlete has his or her profile containing information on the athlete\u2019s whereabouts, doping probes and permission to use various medications. \\nSome time ago, the Fancy Bear hacker group hacked the ADAMS database and began to publish documents proving that in the past years some renowned athletes had taken banned substances for medical purposes. A total of six lists were disclosed with 127 athletes from different countries on the lists. The sole Russian athlete mentioned in the documents was boxer Mikhail Aloyan. \\n{{item.group_date}} '"}, "time": 1742564318.2731216}
