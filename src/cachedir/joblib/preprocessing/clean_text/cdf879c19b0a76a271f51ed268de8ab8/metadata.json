But a very significant \u2015 and possibly overlooked \u2015 group of WikiLeaks items relevant to the topic was released on May 18, 2015. \\nWikiLeaks posted more than half a million U.S. State Department diplomatic documents from 1978 detailing America\u2019s interactions with countries all around the world \u2015 including Grenada Prime Minister Eric Gairy\u2019s efforts to organize a United Nations-based committee to research and investigate global UFO reports. \\nMany of the documents, written by American UN officials, indicated how closely they were monitoring Grenada\u2019s UFO-related activities. \\nOne document , from Nov. 18, 1978, revealed my involvement in helping Grenada to produce a credible UFO presentation. \\nI had an opportunity in early 1978 to meet Gairy in New York to present an idea about how I thought the UN would pay attention to his UFO crusade. Through his ambassadors, I gave him a copy of a documentary record album, \u201cUFOs: The Credibility Factor,\u201d that I produced for CBS Inc. in 1975. \\nGairy and I met, and after I convinced him I could bring a very credible group of speakers to the UN, he agreed to sponsor my proposal (see image below). Shortly after a handshake deal, he made me a temporary delegate-adviser of Grenada and the rest was, well, history. COURTESY OF LEE SPEIGEL This 1978 letter from Grenada to Lee Speigel confirmed that country\u2019s commitment to sponsor Speigel\u2019s UFO presentation at the United Nations. \\nThe following image shows part of the group I brought together in July 1978 to meet with UN Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim. He wanted to know what we were planning to do at our November event in front of the Special Political Committee, which included representatives from the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. COURTESY OF LEE SPEIGEL On July 14, 1978, producer Lee Speigel (now a Huffington Post writer) brought together a group of military, scientific and psychological experts to meet with United Nations Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim to discuss Speigel\u2019s upcoming presentation to the U.N. Special Political Committee later that year. Topic: The importance of establishing an international UFO committee. Pictured from left: USAF astronaut Col.

Allen Hynek, Grenada Prime Minister Sir Eric Gairy, Waldheim, Morton Gleisner of the Special Political Committee, Lee Speigel, researcher Leonard Stringfield and University of Colorado psychologist David Saunders. \\nAnother cable posted on WikiLeaks , from Nov. 24, 1978, refers to Ambassador Richard Petree\u2019s meeting with Grenada representatives \u201cto discuss their UFO resolution. Ambassador Petree acknowledged the high level of interest in UFOs among some elements of the private sector and scientific community \u2026 and pointed to the budgetary impact as a major concern of the U.S. and other countries.\u201d \\nOn Nov. 28, 1978, the day after our presentation at the UN, this document was sent through official channels, detailing the actual UFO event, describing what each of the invited scientific and military speakers had to say to the member nations. \\nA few days after that, on Dec. 2, 1978, a follow-up cable was transmitted, including the following: \\nSubsequent to the introduction of the Grenadian UFO resolution, Misoff [Mission Officer] has engaged in two separate informal negotiating sessions, which included representation from Austria, USSR and Grenada, in an attempt to arrive at a mutually acceptable compromise solution to the problem. \\nA draft decision to be taken by the Special Political Committee (SPC) has been agreed upon by the participants in the informal negotiations, subject to concurrence of their respective capitals. We think referral of the [UFO] matter to the Outer Space Committee (OSC) without a preordained mandate as to what action is to be taken, provides the flexibility the OSC needs to take whatever action it deems appropriate. \\nIt will also obviate the need to vote on a resolution (and gamble on the results). \\nThe following week brought forth another document , on Dec. 8, 1978, which stated: \\n\u201cThe General Assembly invites interested member states to take appropriate steps to coordinate on a national level scientific research and investigation into extraterrestrial life, including unidentified flying objects, and to inform the secretary-general of the observations, research and evaluation of such activities.\u201d \\nIt was further suggested that Grenada\u2019s views on UFOs could be discussed in 1979. Unfortunately, that didn\u2019t come to pass, as Grenada Prime Minister Gairy was overthrown in a 1979 coup. \\nNeedless to say, without the Gairy-based initiative on UFOs, it was quietly relegated to Grenada\u2019s back burner. \\nThis is the tip of the UFO-UN iceberg. It shows how the subject of UFOs wasn\u2019t merely officially ridiculed or slapped aside. There was, and perhaps still is, some interest there, just waiting to emerge.'"}, "time": 1742628578.1809733}
