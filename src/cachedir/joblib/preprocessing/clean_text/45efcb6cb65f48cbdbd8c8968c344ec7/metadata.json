Trump has turned the vital, but normally inscrutable, process of forming a government into a      spectacle, parading his finalists for top administration positions this weekend before reporters and the world. The two days unfolded like a pageant, with the many   officials striding up the circular driveway at Trump National Golf Club here, meeting Mr. Trump below three glass chandeliers at the entrance and shaking hands while facing the cameras. To build suspense, Mr. Trump offered teasing hints about coming announcements. \u201cI think so,\u201d he said about whether he would make any appointments on Sunday. \u201cI think so. It could very well happen. \u201d Among the contenders he met with was James N. Mattis, a   retired Marine Corps general. He appears  \u2014   according to Mr. Trump\u2019s own words on Twitter  \u2014   to be the leading candidate for defense secretary. Outside the club\u2019s   farmhouse on Saturday, the   poked a finger in General Mattis\u2019s direction and called him \u201ca great man. \u201d The next morning, at 8:39, Mr. Trump gushed again, this time on Twitter, calling him \u201cvery impressive\u201d and saying he was \u201ca true general\u2019s general!\u201d Perhaps by design, the roster of figures arriving at the club was difficult to pigeonhole: There were loyalists (Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor) former adversaries (Mitt Romney, who once called Mr. Trump a \u201cphony\u201d) Democrats (Michelle A. Rhee, the former schools chief in Washington) and scientists (Patrick   a billionaire cancer doctor). But despite that appearance of diversity, Mr. Trump\u2019s choices so far for national security posts seem to show a preference for older white men with similar   views on immigration, the military and terrorism. Most of the leading candidates for other jobs appear to be white men, as well, including Mr. Giuliani, whose own business activities have faced scrutiny. If he is nominated as secretary of state, Mr. Giuliani would face questions over his security firm\u2019s ties to the government of Qatar and the speeches he gave to an Iranian exile opposition group that until 2012 was on the State Department\u2019s list of foreign terrorist organizations. Asked whether he was concerned about Mr. Giuliani\u2019s business dealings, Mr. Trump said, \u201cNo, not at all. \u201d Mr. Trump, as he used his golf resort as the backdrop for his official activities, gave no indication that he was concerned about news reports over the weekend that he had held meetings last week with three Indian business partners even as he was starting to assemble his administration. The very public process  \u2014   CNN trained a camera on the golf club\u2019s wooden front door throughout the day on Sunday  \u2014   has borne few similarities to attempts by Mr. Trump\u2019s predecessors to project an image of careful, private vetting of   hopefuls. Officials running President Obama\u2019s transition in late 2008 took pains to keep under wraps his plans to select Hillary Clinton for secretary of state, and they orchestrated a secret meeting at the firehouse at Reagan National Airport to discuss keeping Robert M. Gates as defense secretary. But for Mr. Trump and his aides, many of whom have long rejected the capital\u2019s customs, such traditions are best discarded. \u201cThis has been a year and election cycle where the normal conventions and past history has been challenged,\u201d said Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist whose longtime boss, Mr. Romney, discussed the secretary of state post with Mr. Trump. \u201cWhy would the transition and the first few months of the administration be any different?\u201d Mr. Madden said. \u201cTrump does things Trump\u2019s way. \u201d After each interview, Mr. Trump, dressed in a suit and tie, emerged from the club next to an American flag to see the candidates off to their   vehicles and once again speak with reporters. \u201cTremendous talent  \u2014   we\u2019re seeing tremendous talent,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Saturday. \u201cPeople that, as I say, we will \u2018make America great again.\u2019 These are really great people. These are really, really talented people. \u201d By the evening, however, Mr. Trump had announced no appointments, leaving reporters waiting on the cold, gusty day to speculate about Mr. Trump\u2019s brief comments. \u201cWe made a couple of deals,\u201d he said as his weekend of interviews drew to a close. Mr. Giuliani is apparently in competition with several others for the secretary of state position, including David H. Petraeus, the retired   general who served as Mr. Obama\u2019s C. I. A. director before leaving amid revelations that he had provided classified information to a woman with whom he was having an affair. Mr. Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee and one of Mr. Trump\u2019s fiercest critics during the 2016 campaign, met with the   on Saturday. If he becomes secretary of state, he could be a moderating influence on the   Mr. Trump has chosen for attorney general, national security adviser and C. I. A. director. \u201cI can say that Governor Romney is under active and serious consideration to serve as secretary of state of the United States,\u201d Vice   Mike Pence said Sunday on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d program. Mr. Trump\u2019s consideration of General Mattis, who is widely respected throughout the military, could also signal an effort to ease concerns among members of the Washington establishment about the shape of his cabinet. General Mattis, who led the First Marine Division during the 2003 invasion of Iraq to topple Saddam Hussein, later commanded American troops during the   battle to retake Falluja from Sunni insurgents in 2004. But his argument for a tougher military posture against Iran at times clashed with the views of Mr. Obama and his national security team. General Mattis, who would be the first former ranking general to become defense secretary since George Marshall in the early 1950s, would need a congressional waiver to take office because federal law stipulates that the Pentagon chief be out of uniform for seven years. General Mattis retired from the Marines in 2013. As Mr. Trump moves to complete his national security team, he may soon turn his attention to domestic affairs. Aides have said members of the transition effort\u2019s economic and domestic policy teams will fan out to meet with agency officials starting on Monday. Mr. Obama, asked Sunday at a summit meeting in Lima, Peru, about stances Mr. Trump has taken that align with the views of his nascent national security team, said: \u201cI can\u2019t guarantee that the   won\u2019t pursue some of the positions that he\u2019s taken. But what I can guarantee is that reality will force him to adjust how he approaches many of these issues. That\u2019s just the way this office works. \u201d Mr. Trump also continued his practice of   bursts on Twitter this weekend. Before attending church with Mr. Pence, Mr. Trump condemned the cast of \u201cHamilton\u201d for its onstage appeal on Friday night to the vice    \u2014   who was in the audience  \u2014   to uphold the rights of a \u201cdiverse America. \u201d \u201cThe cast and producers of \u2018Hamilton,\u2019 which I hear is highly overrated, should immediately apologize to Mike Pence for their terrible behavior,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote. In another Twitter post, the   expressed his disapproval of \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d calling it a \u201ctotally   biased show  \u2014   nothing funny at all. \u201d Mr. Trump was portrayed on the show as being overwhelmed by the prospect of being president. Even as Mr. Trump bemoaned the actions of the cast of \u201cHamilton,\u201d a smash hit on Broadway, Mr. Pence said on Sunday morning that he was not offended or bothered. In an appearance on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Mr. Pence said he would \u201cleave it to others\u201d to decide whether the theater was an appropriate place for a political message. \u201c\u2018Hamilton\u2019 is just an incredible production and just incredibly talented people,\u201d Mr. Pence said. \u201cIt was a real joy to be there. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562499.89279}
