[In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Trump said that was open to the possibility of renominating Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen once her current term of office expires next year. During the campaign he was critical of Yellen, describing her as \u201cpolitical\u201d for keeping rates low, and said that he \u201cmost likely\u201d would replace her as Fed chief.  \u201cI like her, I respect her,\u201d Trump said.  He added that \u201cit\u2019s very early. \u201d When asked if Yellen was \u201ctoast,\u201d the president said, \u201cNo. Not toast. \u201d This has caught many on Wall Street and Capitol Hill by surprise, overturning the near universal expectation that Trump would pick a new head for the central bank. The possibility that Trump may support the status quo at the Fed has some supporters scratching their heads. On Wall Street, this is widely viewed as the result of the influence of Gary Cohn and other financiers on the president. \u201cI think we\u2019re seeing the influence of guys like Gary Cohn, Steven Mnuchin and Steve Schwarzman. They probably explained that markets want him to show he\u2019s   about the Fed and favors a dovish stance,\u201d said one investment banker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cDovish\u201d is Wall Street lingo for leaning toward keeping interest rates lower. \u201cI do like a   rate policy, I must be honest with you,\u201d Trump told the Wall Street Journal in response to questions about Yellen. Cohn is Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser and holds the position of director of the National Economic Council. A lifelong Democrat, Cohn was the number 2 man in charge of Goldman Sachs until he left to join the Trump administration. Treasury Secretary Mnuchin is also a Goldman alum and has close ties to Wall Street. Schwarzman is a   friend of Trump\u2019s and the   of the Blackstone Group, a   Wall Street private equity firm. He reportedly speaks to Trump by phone several times a week and was recently seated beside Trump at a White House gathering of corporate chiefs. Trump also said he no longer opposes the   bank, which he accused of \u201c \u201d and called unnecessary during the campaign. \u201cIt turns out that, first of all, lots of small companies are really helped, the vendor companies,\u201d Trump told the Wall Street Journal. Around 40 percent of   money is used to subsidize exports from Boeing. Less than 20 percent goes directly to small businesses. The language Trump used, referring to small businesses as \u2018vendors\u2019 indicates the influence of big businesses that benefit from   subsidies. They have long argued that they pass along subsidies to smaller businesses that manufacture parts for their exports, a   theory of subsidies. \u201c  doesn\u2019t help the economy. It doesn\u2019t drain the swamp,\u201d writes     critic Tim Carney at the Washington Examiner. Jeff Immelt, the chief executive of General Electric, applauded Trump\u2019s change of heart on  . By supporting the Export Import Bank @POTUS is showing great leadership and focusing on creating jobs for American manufacturers.  \u2014   Jeff Immelt (@JeffImmelt) April 13, 2017,    Disclosure: Tim Carney is my brother.
