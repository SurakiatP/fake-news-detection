It will not be easy. No country shares Washington\u2019s worldview quite the way Britain does, they say it has long been the United States\u2019 most willing security ally, most effective intelligence partner and greatest enthusiast of the   mantras that have been a keystone of America\u2019s internationalist approach. And few nations were as willing to put a thumb as firmly on the scales of European debates in ways that benefit the United States. Now that quiet diplomatic leverage  \u2014   including moderating European trade demands and   nations to contribute more to NATO military missions  \u2014   is suddenly diminished. Even if Britain eventually regains its influence on the Continent, a big if, it will be deeply distracted for years. Moreover, the loss of Britain\u2019s strong voice in Europe comes at a particularly bad moment: just as the United States and its allies are debating how to handle a revanchist Russia and reinvigorate NATO, hurry along an   trade pact that has been languishing, and work through a diplomatic settlement in Syria that could relieve the migrant crisis in Europe. \u201cWhen Vladimir Putin is cheering,\u201d David Miliband, the former British foreign minister, said on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d Sunday, \u201cthen you know you have got a problem in the international system. \u201d And then, of course, there is the threat of the Islamic State, which has found in Europe a new battlefield, one in which the development and sharing of intelligence, seamlessly, is critical. Addressing those challenges was daunting enough, American officials say, in the face of the tenor of the American presidential campaign, particularly Donald J. Trump\u2019s questioning of whether alliances are worth it if allies are not willing to pay more for American protection. But now, with Britain\u2019s exit, called Brexit, whatever passed for   plans  \u2014   a Europe that gradually takes a greater role in its region and the Middle East as America devotes more attention to Asia  \u2014   are imperiled. Like the Arab Spring, the result of Britain\u2019s referendum took Washington by surprise. As late as early last week there was something between a hope and an assumption that the vote would \u201cgo the other way,\u201d as Secretary of State John Kerry said in Rome on Sunday. As a result, there was no serious planning for the   work of reimagining the European relationship, a task that will face President Obama for the next six months, and his successor for years to come. Mr. Kerry, usually the optimist, sounded almost downbeat as he arrived in Italy. He did not make any references to a \u201cshriveled Europe,\u201d as one of his top aides did in a conversation over the weekend. But he made clear that European allies are also going to have to rethink their relationships with the United States. \u201c  of the nations in the E. U. are members of NATO,\u201d he said less than a minute into his meeting with his Italian counterpart, Paolo Gentiloni. He warned that the most critical step was to \u201cwork together to provide as much continuity, as much stability, as much certainty as possible\u201d to \u201cprotect the values and interests that we share in common. \u201d The problem is that no one shares those values and interests quite the way the British do, a belief that no American diplomat would utter in public for fear of offending other members of the European Union. But British officials who have been at the center of that daily interaction say the concern goes both ways. \u201cI worry that we will have less clout on our own: In the future we won\u2019t have as much influence on Europe\u2019s response to Putin\u2019s transgressions, Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions, or the E. U.\u2019s foreign and security policy,\u201d said Peter Westmacott, one of Britain\u2019s most experienced diplomats and, until January, ambassador to the United States. \u201cAnd we will be less able to ensure it is U. S. . \u201d He added that without Britain\u2019s direct involvement, Europe was likely to be less enthusiastic about free trade. Still, Mr. Westmacott noted that \u201cwe should be able to cooperate much as in the past on counterterrorism, on intelligence, on cyber and on military issues,\u201d assuming that \u201cour economy does not shrink too much as markets, investors and the Scots take stock of Thursday\u2019s outcome. \u201d All of which raises the question: If Britain can no longer play that indispensable role for Washington, surely there is another country that can? Perhaps, but it is hard to think of who. It is not a role Germany has shown a real willingness to step into. Its   War II ethos still holds it back from committing combat forces, and it is not a member of the inner circle of intelligence sharing called the \u201cFive Eyes,\u201d a club made up of the Anglo victors of World War II. (The other three are Canada, Australia and New Zealand.) A lengthy negotiation to improve the intelligence relationship last year ended with only modest changes. For all of its cooperation with the United States on a variety of issues, Germany still harbors deep suspicions of the United States that were fueled by the revelations from Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, including the American surveillance of Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s cellphone conversations. And American officials were shocked recently when Germany\u2019s foreign minister,   Steinmeier, warned that recent NATO exercises to deter Russia from thinking about destabilizing Poland and the Baltic members of the military alliance amounted to \u201c  and warmongering. \u201d France has also not been as natural a fit with the United States as Britain. While relations have changed drastically since the George W. Bush administration, Paris often goes its own way, including its recent strategy for restarting   talks. The Italians, for their part, are too broke, the Netherlands is too small, and Poland does not yet have the clout of older NATO members. Moreover, there is a question of leadership. British leaders were the Europeans most closely aligned with the American negotiating position in the major trade and investment deal being hashed out between the United States and some of its largest trading partners. When Mr. Obama visited London in April, he warned voters that Britain would be excluded from the deal if it left the bloc and would \u201cgo to the end of the queue\u201d for its own bilateral trade agreement. But the United States would also lose Britain\u2019s voice in moderating Europe\u2019s trade demands. The intelligence challenges created by Brexit are more subtle. Bilateral cooperation will continue as tightly or more tightly than ever to try to prevent terrorism. But the hope that Britain could improve intelligence sharing among the major European powers  \u2014   something that is sorely needed  \u2014   is most likely dashed even as terrorism threats have risen. Over a lunch near the White House a few weeks ago, a senior intelligence official said the obvious solution to intelligence gaps was a far more powerful,   intelligence service. It is hard to imagine a new intelligence institution, however, without   and GCHQ  \u2014   the British equivalents of the C. I. A. and the N. S. A.  \u2014   playing a lead role. And given Britain\u2019s likely preoccupation with the Brexit fallout, it is far from clear how high a priority a new intelligence organization, or a rethinking of NATO strategy, would be for Britain. There is a counterargument that Britain could emerge as a stronger security partner for the United States, that it will value its role in NATO and other institutions all the more. Adm. James Stavridis, who served as the 16th supreme allied commander in Europe and is the dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, presented that view in an article in Foreign Policy. He said that a \u201cnew British government will presumably be a very motivated NATO partner. \u201d \u201cNow that it has chosen to become a relatively marginal economic player on the international stage,\u201d he continued, \u201cit will have to look for new ways to demonstrate value in its partnership with the United States if it hopes to maintain anything like the \u2018special relationship\u2019 it has become accustomed to (and dependent on). \u201d But even if Britain seeks a more active role in NATO, it may not be accepted as one by its other members Britain has often been referred to as an American puppet  \u2014   with other states noting that former Prime Minister Tony Blair followed Mr. Bush into Iraq with few questions. There is nothing permanent about political unions and alliances, of course, and some argue that Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union is not necessarily a calamity for Washington. As James F. Jeffrey, a former American diplomat in the Middle East, and Simon Henderson of the Washington Institute wrote last week, \u201cThe U. S. and U. K. were bosom allies for 30 years before Britain joined the E. U. \u201d But part of what made the special relationship special in an era of global diplomacy was Britain\u2019s ability to act for Washington with the Europeans, to bridge the gap. Now, as one White House official put it, the bridge has been wiped out by a surge that few predicted.'"}, "time": 1742562839.7812526}
