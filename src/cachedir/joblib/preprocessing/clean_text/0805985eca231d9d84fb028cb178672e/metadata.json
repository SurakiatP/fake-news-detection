Of the more than 160 emails in the latest Judicial Watch release, some 110 emails \u2013 two-thirds of the total \u2013 were forwarded by Abedin to two personal addresses she controlled. The Washington Times reported in August 2015 that the State Department had admitted to a federal judge that Abedin and Mills used personal email accounts to conduct government business in addition to Clinton\u2019s private clintonemail.com to transact State Department business. \\nOne email from May 15, 2009, was sent by Abedin from her State Department email to her personal email. Abedin was archiving in her personal email account an email Hillary Clinton sent her from Clinton\u2019s private email server at . Abedin was asked to print out attachments to an email Mills sent via a private address the previous day to Clinton involving \u201ctimetables and deliverables\u201d for her review via Alec Ross, a technology policy expert who then held the title of senior adviser for innovation to Secretary Clinton. However, while forwarding Hillary\u2019s emails to her personal email server for \u201cconvenience\u201d is one thing, what is more troubling is the amount of redaction involved in these emails which migrated to the open email account, which as we now know ended up in Anthony Weiner\u2019s computer: in the above example, the two pages of timetables and deliverables attached to the email were 100 percent redacted, with \u201cPAGE DENIED\u201d stamped across the first redacted page. \\nAn argument can be made that the extensive redaction confirms confidential material was part of the transmission. \\nThis is a nuanced point being pushed by Hillary Clinton supporters such as Newsweek\u2019s Kurt Eichenwald, who in an article yesterday tried to make a case citing \u201csources\u201d (even though the FBI said that nobody has seen the content of the Weiner/Abedin emails), that \u201c no emails being examined by FBI were to or from Clinton .\u201d Post navigation'"}, "time": 1742564154.105862}
