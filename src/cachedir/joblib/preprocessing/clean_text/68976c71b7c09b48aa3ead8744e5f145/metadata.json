Observers have described the phenomenon, \u2018Abnormal\u2019, \u2018Chilling\u2019 and \u2018Like watching a dog doing the hoovering \u2013 not something that should be in a sane world.\u2019 \\nThe photographic bants-platform first believed adult use of Snapchat was an anomaly caused by over-protective parents rooting through their teenager\u2019s belongings in search for evidence of pre-marital sex and \u2018The Reefer\u2019. However, pattern analysis of messages suggests the missives were sent intentionally as part of a deliberate campaign to be seen as, \u2018Not hurtling inexorably towards the grave\u2019. Company bosses are reported to be, \u2018Gutted\u2019. \\n\u2018It\u2019s a death knell\u2019 said CEO Michaela Hodgkinson. \u2018This will just about wipe out our user base. And we tried so hard. We made it so counter-intuitive to people who didn\u2019t grow up with access to enough pixilated tits and ass to wrap multiple times round the Milky Way like an erotic flesh sausage. God, I wish it were the good old days, when adults treated innovation with the sort of suspicion usually reserved for men called \u2018Mohammed\u2019 walking into a small town Texan airport.\u2019 \\n\u2018It is a well-known fact that adolescents instinctively recoil from in shame, disgust and loathing to anything enjoyed by the over 30\u2019s,\u2019 explained youth-guru Samuel Cook. \u2018Look at Michael Bolton. Once upon a time, the mere Herbal-Essence-esque swoosh of his flowing easy-listening locks could obliterate juvenile knickers like the oncoming of a Biblical flood; now, I\u2019ve seen a teenager to projectile vomit the words, \u2018Cock-nugget\u2019 just by hearing the opening bars to \u2018When A Man Loves A Woman\u2019. \\nExperts suggest that teenagers\u2019 influence over what is cool acts as compensation for a future without the possibility of jobs, savings, or affordable housing, at least until their parents pop their clogs and they can wrench a decent standard of living out of their elder\u2019s hoary baby-boomer claws. Teenagers are expected to flee the social media site like rats aboard a sinking over-60s cruise ship and seek pastures even more disorientating and obtuse. Prospective new digital street-corners-outside-the-offie include, \u2018Bluster\u2019, \u2018Waffle\u2019 and a messaging service where users communicate entirely using quotes from the 1988 film Beetlejuice.
