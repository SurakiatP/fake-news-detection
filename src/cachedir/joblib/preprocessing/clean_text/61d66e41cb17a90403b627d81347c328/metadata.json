The man, Kevin James Loibl, shot Ms. Grimmie in a premeditated attack, the police said, and then killed himself moments later. The shooting happened after a performance by Ms. Grimmie on Friday night in Orlando, and no motive was announced. The authorities said there was no indication the two knew each other. Ms. Grimmie, 22, had performed with the band Before You Exit at a popular Orlando music venue, The Plaza Live, and was signing autographs for fans and selling merchandise shortly before 10:30 p. m. when the gunman walked up to her and opened fire, the Orlando Police Department said in a statement. John Mina, the chief of the Orlando Police Department, said Mr. Loibl had traveled to Orlando with two handguns, several loaded magazines and a hunting knife. Police officials were examining his telephone and computer to try to determine a motive. A note on the door of Mr. Loibl\u2019s house in St. Petersburg expressed \u201cthe deepest sorrow\u201d to Ms. Grimmie\u2019s family, friends and fans and said there would be no other comment, The Associated Press reported. A spokeswoman for Ms. Grimmie, Heather Weiss, said, \u201cIt is with a heavy heart that we can confirm that Christina has passed and went home to be with the Lord. \u201d The Police Department said in a statement that \u201cChristina was a talented young artist, and we know that her fans and supporters want as much information as possible. \u201d \u201cWe will continue to update as the investigation unfolds,\u201d it added. When the shooting began, the singer\u2019s brother Marcus Grimmie quickly tackled Mr. Loibl, who shot himself in the ensuing struggle. The police credited Mr. Grimmie with bringing the attack to a swift end and protecting fans. There were about 120 people present at the time of the shooting, Chief Mina said. \u201cHer brother Marcus is a hero and possibly saved countless other lives,\u201d the Police Department said. It said Mr. Grimmie had not been injured in the altercation. Ms. Grimmie was \u201ccritically injured\u201d when police officers arrived at the venue on Friday night and died of her injuries at a hospital at about 3 a. m. Saturday, according to a police statement. Ms. Grimmie rose to fame on YouTube as a teenager, performing covers of   songs by contemporary artists like Miley Cyrus, Celine Dion and Usher that garnered millions of views. Her profile grew in 2014 when she competed on the sixth season of the popular NBC singing competition \u201cThe Voice. \u201d She finished third, winning the praise of its celebrity hosts, a broader fan base and a deal with Island Records. Ms. Grimmie\u2019s manager, Brian Teefey, described her as \u201clike a second daughter\u201d and said he was horrified by her death. \u201cAll I wanted to do was assist her in achieving her musical dreams while protecting her from the pitfalls associated with the business,\u201d Mr. Teefey said. \u201cI never could have imagined this horrific event being one of the pitfalls needing to be avoided. \u201d On Saturday, her fans and friends in the music industry posted messages of shock and mourning on social media. \u201cI\u2019m stunned and disgusted and heartbroken that we lost that sweet little girl,\u201d Blake Shelton, a host of \u201cThe Voice,\u201d wrote on Twitter on Saturday morning. Adam Levine, another of the show\u2019s hosts and Ms. Grimmie\u2019s   mentor, wrote on Instagram before her death was confirmed, \u201cI\u2019m sad, shocked and confused. \u201d \u201cThis just isn\u2019t fair,\u201d he added.'"}, "time": 1742562319.6694643}
