Planes have dropped leaflets over the   areas in the eastern part of city. \u201cIf you don\u2019t leave these areas quickly you will be annihilated,\u201d the leaflets warn. \u201cSave yourselves. You know that everyone has left you alone to face your doom and have offered you no help. \u201d Hisham   a member of a council of rebels and civilians in eastern Aleppo, said by telephone on Tuesday that warplanes had hovered closely over the area, steadily dropping barrel bombs, as a delegation of civic activists explored the idea of using   safe routes to leave the city, though many were not confident they could escape with their lives. \u201cFor the civilians, they have the choice whether they want to leave or stay, but for those of us who don\u2019t trust the regime, we have no choice,\u201d he said through tears, adding that he did not want to leave his home. \u201cI can\u2019t turn my back on my city. \u201d Rami Jarrah, a Syrian   activist and citizen journalist who is based in Turkey but regularly travels to   Aleppo, said via Facebook that he did not believe that there was such a thing as safe passage. Five years into the civil war, he said, many of those remaining in eastern Aleppo are on the Assad government\u2019s \u201cblack list,\u201d having participated in protests or openly defied it. \u201cAll have lost loved ones or have family members who are fighting to protect the city,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Syrian regime does not tolerate any form of opposition to its narrative, and this means that leaving eastern Aleppo through \u2018safe\u2019 passageways that have been set up by Assad\u2019s forces is not an option for the vast majority of the population. \u201d He added: \u201cSyrians would prefer to live under chaotic bombardment than be apprehended by the Syrian regime and tortured to death. Five years of people staying put even when leaving was the easiest option is sheer proof of this. \u201d Around 10, 000 civilians have escaped from the city\u2019s   east into   western Aleppo, Jens Laerke, a spokesman for the United Nations emergency relief coordination office, told reporters in Geneva. An additional 4, 000 to 6, 000 have managed to flee to the   Sheikh Maqsoud neighborhood on the northern edge of the city, he said. Russian and Syrian television channels showed people who had crossed into government territory cheering and thanking the government and complaining of bad treatment by rebels inside. In the   neighborhood of Bustan   where bombs rained down, Dr. Salem Abdulnasser said the medical center where he worked had notified the staff that it would close on Thursday because it was too dangerous to keep operating. Russia said it would be sending mobile hospitals to Aleppo to assist in the crisis. Russian officials also said that 80, 000 people lived in the districts retaken by the Syrian government and that they were receiving humanitarian aid but there was no footage immediately available of such operations inside the areas until Monday held by rebels. Bassem Ayoub, an activist in eastern Aleppo, said that even those sympathetic to the rebels were on the brink of despair. \u201cI\u2019m ready to agree to the regime\u2019s terms  \u2014   whatever they are  \u2014   for the sake of stopping the killing,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are dying by the hundreds. Everybody is ready to leave. Stop the killing. \u201d The United Nations appealed repeatedly for access to deliver food and medical aid to eastern Aleppo and to evacuate the wounded. Jan Egeland, the United Nations special adviser on humanitarian affairs, said last week that Russian officials had agreed verbally, and armed opposition groups in writing, to a   plan submitted this month, but the agency\u2019s plan had not received backing from Damascus and no further action had followed. United Nations officials also said that indiscriminate shelling of western Aleppo had continued killing and injuring civilians, destroying civilian infrastructure, and had forced about 20, 000 people from their homes. The World Food Program said it was able to supply bread and other rations to community kitchens in western Aleppo, but residents in the eastern parts of the city have had no food distribution for two weeks. \u201cIt\u2019s really dire,\u201d said Bettina Luescher, a spokeswoman for the agency, citing accounts of residents sifting through garbage for something to eat. \u201dIt\u2019s a   descent into hell,\u201d she said. At the same time, about 700, 000 people are trapped in besieged areas in other parts of the country, Mr. O\u2019Brien said. As in eastern Aleppo, \u201cpeople in these besieged areas are trapped, terrified and running out of time,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742628307.3224459}
