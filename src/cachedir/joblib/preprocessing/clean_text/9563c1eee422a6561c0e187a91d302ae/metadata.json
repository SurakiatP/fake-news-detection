He has been working like an incredibly effective CEO, which is what he was. He is driven to represent the nation as our   diplomat,\u201d he said.  \u201cIt\u2019s like the stories that have been broiling now for months and months and months. It\u2019s the generation of those who are either inside the machine or outside the machine who do not wish to recognize what happened on November the 8 and think that they have some special right not only to generate false news, but to somehow question the legitimacy of a duly elected administration. It\u2019s just absurdity, Alex,\u201d said Gorka. Dr. Sebastian Gorka is a deputy assistant to President Donald Trump, former National Security editor for Breitbart News and author of books such as Defeating Jihad: The Winnable War. Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern. LISTEN: '"}, "time": 1742563226.2283502}
