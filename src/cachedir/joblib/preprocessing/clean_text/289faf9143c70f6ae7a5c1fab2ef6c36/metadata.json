This news come after \u201cwater protectors\u201d refused law enforcement requests to vacate reoccupied land in the pipeline\u2019s path, owned by Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners. \\nLast week, native activists took the bold action of declaring eminent domain over their traditional territory and set up a new camp \u201cFront-Line\u201d camp directly in the pipeline\u2019s path. Pipeline opponents say they have simply reclaimed the land under the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851, clearly noting the Sioux never ceded that territory. The new encampment lies across Highway 1806, where pipeline security guards armed with guard dogs and pepper spray attacked protestors attempting to stop the bulldozing of cultural sites and burial grounds on September 3. \\nThe impending crisis comes after nearly 200 water protectors set up the new camp on land that Energy Transfer Partners last month purchased from a local rancher in an effort to bolster strategic and tactical control of areas surrounding construction of the controversial pipeline. \\nAccording to the AP , however, the Native Americans claim the land is theirs by way of an \u201c1851 treaty and they won\u2019t leave until the pipeline is stopped.\u201d \u201cWe never ceded this land,\u201d said protester Joye Braun. \\nThis latest flashpoint in the ongoing conflict is north of the larger and more permanent encampments, which have been constructed on federally owned land where over 200 Native American tribes have gathered to oppose the pipeline\u2019s construction. \\nOn Wednesday, a heavily militarized law enforcement presence began mobilizing heavy equipment, including Humvees, armored personnel carriers, buses and demanded the protestors leave the occupied area. \\nIn an ominous sign, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has restricted flights , and banned the use of drones within a radius of about 4 \u00bd miles of Cannon Ball. The FAA declared that only aircraft affiliated with the North Dakota Tactical Operation Center are allowed within the restricted airspace. The flight restriction went into effect Wednesday and will last until November 5. \\nIndian Country Today reports : \\nWhat began with prayers and a single tipi alongside Highway 1806 quickly grew to more than a dozen tipis surrounded by tents, buses, cars and hundreds of water protectors. Some are calling it the \u201c1851 Treaty Camp\u201d to acknowledge their Treaty rights. \\nAcross the road is the encroaching pipeline and a heavily militarized police force with armored vehicles, helicopters, planes, ATVs and busloads of officers. Tensions are growing as unarmed citizens worry that police will use unnecessarily harsh tactics. \\nIn recent weeks, nearly 300 unarmed water protectors who were arrested have been subjected to pepper spray, strip-searches, delayed bail, exaggerated charges and physical violence, according to interviews with several who were taken into custody. The ACLU and National Lawyers Guild recently sent attorneys to Standing Rock to help the Red Owl Collective, a team of volunteer lawyers headed by attorney Bruce Ellison, who are representing many of those arrested. \\nThe massive law enforcement contingent, consisting of sheriff\u2019s deputies and officers from numerous other states and counties, as well as National Guard, began staging near the encampment \u2014 with scores of Armored Personnel Carriers, buses and Humvees poised at the ready. \\n\u201cAt some point the rule of law has to be enforced,\u201d Cass County Sheriff Paul Laney said Wednesday. \u201cWe could go down there at any time. We\u2019re trying not to.\u201d \\nDakota Access LLC, the pipeline developer released a statement encouraging trespassers to \u201cvacate the land immediately\u201d or be \u201cremoved from the land.\u201d \\n\u201cAlternatively and in coordination with local law enforcement and county/state officials, all trespassers will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and removed from the land,\u201d the company said. \u201cLawless behavior will not be tolerated.\u201d \\nJust days ago, sheriff\u2019s officials had said earlier they didn\u2019t have the resources to immediately remove activists from the private land, about 50 miles south of Bismarck. Subsequently, law enforcement officials put out a call for reinforcements, with hundreds of officers from out of state responding. \\nOn Wednesday, actor and environmental activist Mark Ruffalo and civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson went to the new camp to speak and pray with the water protectors. Ruffalo had arrived the night before to speak on an anti-DAPL panel with Native activists at the Prairie Knights Casino and Hotel, according to Indian Country Today. \\nAfter touring the camp Jackson spoke to the crowd, reminding people that nonviolence is key to winning the battle for justice. \\n\u201cWith promises broken, land stolen, and sacred lands desecrated, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is standing up for their right to clean water. They have lost land for settlers to farm, more land for gold in the Black Hills, and then again even more land for the damn (sic) that was built for flood control and hydro power,\u201d Jackson said. \\nWhen will the taking stop? When will we start treating the first peoples of these lands with the respect and honor they deserve? \\nThe rerouting of the pipeline away from Bismarck to its current route is \u201cthe ripest case of environmental racism I\u2019ve seen in a long time,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cBismarck residents don\u2019t want their water threatened, so why is it okay for North Dakota to react with guns and tanks when Native Americans ask for the same right?\u201d \\nThe pipeline was originally scheduled to run north of Bismarck until local residents expressed displeasure with the plan, with the DAPL ultimately being rerouted to its current trajectory near the Oceti Sakowin Standing Rock Reservation. \\nWith an impending militarized police raid of the camp, Mekasi Camp-Horinek, one of the camp coordinators, told officers the protesters planned to stand their ground, saying \u201cDo what you\u2019ve got to do,\u201d according to the Bismarck Tribune \\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a crystal ball to know when it will happen, but we know it will happen,\u201d said Mekasi Camp-Horinek, a member of the Ponca tribe in Oklahoma. \u201cWe\u2019re going to hold this ground.\u201d \\nWater protectors could be heard chanting, \u201cStand in peace against the beast.\u201d \\n\u201cI\u2019m here to die if I have to. I don\u2019t want to die but I will,\u201d said Didi Banerji, who lives in Toronto but is originally from the Spirit Lake Sioux reservation in North Dakota. \\nThe protesters are simply trying to keep law enforcement from preventing their efforts to stop the pipeline said David Red Bear Jr., 30, from the South Dakota side of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. \\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t stop them here, they\u2019re going to cut us off closer to the pipeline. We can\u2019t let that happen,\u201d Red Bear said. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to force anybody\u2019s hand. We\u2019re just trying to stand up for what we believe in.\u201d \\nThe reality is that the citizens of North Dakota are funding a protection force, in the form of police, for a multi-billion dollar corporate entity. North Dakota\u2019s Emergency Commission previously approved $6 million in emergency funding for law enforcement costs related to the protest \u2014 with almost all of those funds having been used already. The Department of Emergency Services plans to ask for more, spokeswoman Cecily Fong said. \\nDo North Dakotans want their tax money spent on police acting as paid enforcers for Wall Street and big oil interests? \\nWhile law enforcement claims they are just doing their job and enforcing the law, in reality, they are acting as enforcers for an unjust corporate oligarchy that consistently puts money over people. The financial elite are the ones who the police are truly protecting and serving \u2014 not the American people.
