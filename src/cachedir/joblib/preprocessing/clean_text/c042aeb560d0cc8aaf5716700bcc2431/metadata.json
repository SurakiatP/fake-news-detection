In the previous episode of this series , the ghost Outis was guided by the Spirit of Liberalism Past to 1996, where a younger Outis had gone to hear a popular liberal speaker. Afterward, his girlfriend Corinne was eager to catch a talk by a postmodern scholar she held in high esteem; eventually, Outis agreed to come along. The speaker was a critical theory/political science professor named Wendy Brown, and she was presenting themes from her recent book, States of Injury . I tried to keep from glancing over at where Corinne and the young Outis were sitting. But my mind kept wandering, and Brown\u2019s style hardly aided my efforts to stay focused on her lecture. The first ten minutes of her talk were spent explaining why her book had notbeen written, the boundaries it would not respect, how not only the first description she gave of her book but also the second were \u201cdisingenuous,\u201d with such a cascade of negations that her prefatory remarks alone contained 2 no \u2019s, 2 neither \u2019s, 9 not \u2019s, and 6 nor \u2019s. To me, it all started to seem hazy, but my ghostly companion must have been enjoying himself. A person listening to Brown might have imagined that human thought was one colossal debate between Marx, Nietzsche, and Foucault, with Max Weber and Jean Baudrillard in supporting roles. Meanwhile, the unappeased menace of Catharine McKinnon lurked on the horizon. But then, something in what Brown was saying started to sound familiar: Postmodern power is often characterized as decentered and diffuse even while it incessantly violates, transgresses, and resituates social boundaries; it [\u2026] irrigates through networks rather than consolidating in bosses and kings [\u2026] We are today very susceptible to simply getting lost [\u2026] insofar as being lost means being without (fixed) means of orientation [\u2026] Brown was describing a disorienting world without clear standards of truth. But did she mean that the world was naturally like this, as Foucault seemed to believe, or did she see this \u201cpostmodern condition\u201d as something the system had inflicted upon everyone, upon Allan Bloom as well as upon Al Franken? In our efforts to \u201ccope\u201d with our \u201clost\u201d condition in postmodernity, Brown explained that one strategy was fundamentalism, or \u201creactionary foundationalism.\u201d Quoting Feher and Heller, Postmodern Political Condition : fundamentalists select one aspect of the dogma, one \u201ctext of foundation\u201d with regard to which they declare all attempts at hermeneutics politically subversive. That did sound like the fundamentalists I\u2019d seen on TV. \u201cWhat\u2019s hermeneutics?\u201d I whispered to Foucault. \u201cInterpretation,\u201d he whispered back. Brown had more to say about fundamentalism. Reactionary foundationalism is not limited to the political or intellectual Right, but emerges across the political spectrum from those hostile to what they take to be postmodern politcal decay and intellectual disarray. What? Apparently others were startled as well, because she immediately followed up on her point. When these precepts \u201cwithout which we cannot survive\u201d issue from the intellectual or political Right, they are easy enough to identify as both reactionary and fundamentalist. It is fairly clear what they oppose and seek to foreclose: inter alia , democratic conversation about our collective condition and future. But when they issue from feminists or others on the \u201cLeft,\u201d they are more slippery, especially insofar as they are posed in the name of caring about political things, caring about \u201c actual women\u201d or about womens\u2019s \u201c actual condition in the world\u201d [\u2026] So: the Right is trying to stop us from thinking democratically about the future, and the Left cares about real problems and real women \u2013 so why is it a problem that we believe that we are right? I want to suggest that much North Atlantic feminism partakes deeply of [\u2026] ressentiment and that this constitutes a good deal of our nervousness about moving toward an analysis as thoroughly Nietzschean in its wariness about truth as postfoundational political theory must be. Whoa, whoa, whoa. How are we swimming in ressentiment ? Doesn\u2019t she mean right wingers ? Why should our analysis be thoroughly Nietzschean? Why should it be \u201cwary\u201d about the truth? Why feminists? What [is it about] identity\u2019s desire for recognition that seem[s] often to breed a politics of recrimination and rancor, of culturally dispersed paralysis and suffering [\u2026]? I found Brown hard to understand. And the things I did understand, I wasn\u2019t sure I liked. She closed by saying that the Left should give up substituting Truth and Morality for politics. Are we willing to engage in struggle rather than recrimination, to develop our faculties rather than revenge our subordination with moral and epistemological gestures, to fight for a world rather than conduct process on the existing one? The audience began to applaud, who knows with how much sincerity. I was annoyed, and I knew one person who I was pretty sure had understood the talk better than I had. \u201cMichel,\u201d I said urgently. He turned to me. \u201cThere are two things I don\u2019t understand. First, Brown criticizes the Left for believing in myths like \u201ctruth is always on the side of the damned and excluded,\u201d and \u201ctruth is clean of power and always positioned to reproach power,\u201d and advocates instead \u201cliving and working without such myths, without insisting that our truths are less partial and more moral than theirs.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Foucault agreed. \u201cBut isn\u2019t she insisting precisely that her postmodern, Nietzschean ideas about politics and rhetoric are less mythical, more true than those of the less reflective people she criticizes?\u201d \u201cAh,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand. And your other question?\u201d \u201cWhen she says we need to do all these things, give up on ressentiment , make our analysis more Nietzschean, stop talking about absolute truth \u2013 why should we? Once you and she demonstrate to everyone that morality and truth are inseparable from power, and people merely engage in \u2018wars of position\u2019 and \u2018amoral contests about the just and good\u2019 \u2013 why would anyone bother to use postmodernist rhetoric?\u201d \u201cWell\u2026\u201d he began. I cut him off, with some heat. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t they just continue to talk about morality and truth the way they do now? If all that matters is winning, and morality and truth help one side to win, then according to you , why care if they are myths?\u201d \u201cRight,\u201d Foucault said, his eyes sparkling. \u201cAbout those two questions\u2026\u201d He was not alarmed by my questions in the least, and I feel sure he would have addressed my doubts. But I stopped paying attention to him as Corinne and the young Outis walked toward me. The moment I had been dreading had come. Corinne\u2019s eyes were shining. \u201cDid you see what she was saying? Wasn\u2019t it brilliant? And she\u2019s so courageous, willing to criticize even Left political movements that she identifies with\u2026\u201d Outis looked reluctant to disappoint her. \u201cShe\u2019s definitely very intelligent\u2026 It\u2019s just that\u2026\u201d Corinne froze. \u201cWhat?\u201d she said in a suddenly much more subdued voice. He seemed to be gathering his courage. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I don\u2019t see why it has to be so complicated. Why can\u2019t she just say what we ought to do?\u201d Corinne retorted, \u201cBut don\u2019t you see \u2013 that\u2019s the problem. Smart people have always been trying to tell people what is true and what to think. It\u2019s a form of power. And she doesn\u2019t want to fall into that trap.\u201d \u201cRight,\u201d Outis said, \u201cbut it feels like she sees the whole world as ringed by traps, so that everything a person could possibly say might somehow be wrong.\u201d \u201cBut Outis,\u201d Corinne said, \u201clots of things people say really are problematic. Lots of times their wording shows habits of thought that are precisely the ones we can recognize as having underpinned horrible things like colonialism.\u201d \u201cDoes that mean we\u2019re all going to have to talk like her ?\u201d Outis muttered. \u201cWhat do you mean, like her ? What\u2019s so bad about the way she talks?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like she believes we\u2019re all under surveillance by a Great and Powerful Monster. And so she has to speak in code so that that neither the Monster nor anyone else will be able to prove that she\u2019s opposing it.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re making it sound completely childish!\u201d Corinne said with indignation. \u201cWell, maybe it is!\u201d Outis said, his voice rising. I turned to the Spirit in anguish. \u201cLeave me!\u201d I cried. \u201cTake me back, haunt me no longer!\u201d He looked at me with surprising gentleness in his eyes. \u201cThere are two shadows more,\u201d he said, \u201cthat you must see; and yet, a respite will give you space to consider the points of fixity, of immobilization, in your position, so you can begin to see them as elements in a strategy\u2026\u201d And with these words, he and everything else vanished, and I found myself alone in the abyssal vale. There were things then that I did not wish to remember, and I forced my mind onto other topics. \u201cPostmodernism,\u201d I repeated darkly to myself. Even the word sounds pretentious. What does it mean, anyway? It seemed to be in opposition to \u201cmodernism,\u201d which in turn meant how people in the early twentieth century often believed that humanity could work toward absolute truth, and that current Western society represented the culmination of historical progress. For reasons Brown seemed to think were obvious, modernism was not good, and so it had been replaced by the \u201cpostmodernism\u201d that had bestrode the academic world like a colossus. Postmodernist irony, cultural relativism, skepticism about objective truth \u2013 in various guises, these could be seen not only in Foucault and Brown, but also in Franken, and echoes of it were present in Bloom\u2019s critique. So who killed it? And why was its death a secret? If the most brilliant liberals of the 1990s had been convinced that all attempts to establish absolute truth were fundamentally flawed and problematic, how had we solved the problem and successfully created a set of fixed reference points for orienting ourselves? Had we, paraphrasing Feher and Heller, chosen a dogma and \u201cdeclared all attempts at interpreting it critically to be subversive\u201d? * * * In the next episode, Outis moves closer to the present, and watches as the outlines of modern progressivism become more discernible.
