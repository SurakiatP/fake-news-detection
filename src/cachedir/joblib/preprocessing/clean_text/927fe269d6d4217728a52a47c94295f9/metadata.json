Trump\u2019s problems from becoming hers. Early on, she supported Senator Marco Rubio\u2019s presidential bid. In ensuing months, she remained resolutely reticent on Mr. Trump, simply never uttering his name in trying to avoid any political undertow that he might create. But after the release last week of a recording in which Mr. Trump boasted in vulgar terms about assaulting women, Ms. Comstock was among the first Republicans to call on him to step down. \u201cThis is disgusting, vile and disqualifying,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cNo woman should ever be subjected to this type of obscene behavior, and it is unbecoming of anybody seeking high office. \u201d Ms. Comstock is hoping her disavowal will be enough. The outcome here in Loudoun County, which in recent years has been seen as a bellwether in presidential politics, will provide a measure of any   damage that Mr. Trump\u2019s contentious candidacy may have caused. Ms. Comstock\u2019s wealthy, highly educated district in the suburbs of Washington is a   hub of government largess, where federal contractors commute past Buddhist temples, mosques and churches that offer services in Korean. \u201cIf the Democrats have any prayer of taking the House, and I think it\u2019s just a long shot, they\u2019ve got to win this seat,\u201d said Thomas M. Davis III, a former Republican congressman who represented portions of Ms. Comstock\u2019s district. So far, many analysts say, there is scant evidence that voters will penalize candidates because of Mr. Trump. \u201cBelieve it or not, it hasn\u2019t changed matters all that much,\u201d said David Wasserman, the House of Representatives editor for The Cook Political Report. He has forecast that Democrats could pick up as many as 20 seats, 10 short of the number needed to regain control of the House. Polls have shown that voters are willing to separate their support for certain House and Senate candidates from their feelings about the top of the ticket. In an effort to bolster Ms. Comstock and other vulnerable Republicans, the Congressional Leadership Fund, a \u201csuper PAC\u201d aligned with Republicans, announced Friday that it would invest an additional $10 million into 15 targeted races, including hers. Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin also has tried to ensure his party holds its House majority, offering a policy agenda and promising appearances in dozens of cities to lend his   power. His campaign said on Thursday that Mr. Ryan had raised $15. 4 million in the third quarter, collecting more than $48. 2 million in 2016. He has transferred more than $31 million of that to the National Republican Congressional Campaign Committee. Mr. Ryan  \u2014   having disinvited Mr. Trump from their first planned joint appearance in Wisconsin last weekend after news of the recording broke  \u2014   effectively cut his members free on Monday, saying he would not defend nor campaign with Mr. Trump. He has instead shifted his focus to the argument that Republicans need to be   to serve as a bulwark against a potential President Hillary Clinton. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, has proved once more to be a   powerhouse, raising $34. 6 million for House Democrats in the third quarter and $127. 7 million this election cycle, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said on Wednesday. Initial reactions to the 2005 recording of Mr. Trump have also given Democrats cause for optimism. A Wall Street   News poll, conducted shortly after the recording was released by The Washington Post, showed 49 percent of voters preferred Democrats take control of Congress, compared with 42 percent who preferred Republicans  \u2014   the largest advantage for Democrats since the government shutdown in 2013. But Democrats have a steep climb. With 247 seats, House Republicans hold their largest majority since 1931. Nathan L. Gonzales, the editor of the Rothenberg  Gonzales Political Report, estimates that Republicans have already locked up 217 seats  \u2014   and they only need 218 to keep their majority. But Republican strategists are haunted by the prospect that voters who would typically support Republicans might become so disillusioned that they choose to stay home. \u201cThis is a highly polarized environment,\u201d Mr. Wasserman said. \u201cAnd I think the only reason for Democrats to overperform on Election Day is that Republicans are so depressed that they don\u2019t show up. \u201d At this point, that does not look very likely, he said. While more educated, conservative voters who may have been more likely to split their ticket are looking less enthusiastic, Mr. Trump\u2019s base remains energized, he said. In the suburbs of Minneapolis, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has run ads trying to tie Representative Erik Paulsen, a Republican, to Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump is unpopular there, but the contest had been trending in favor of Mr. Paulsen  \u2014   who last week joined Ms. Comstock in announcing he would not vote for him. Similarly, in northeastern Iowa, Democrats have been struggling to oust Representative Rod Blum, a Republican who is a member of the   House Freedom Caucus. Mr. Blum\u2019s district voted for Mr. Obama twice, but the pickup, originally thought to be likely, has been bedeviling Democrats. Mr. Blum has denounced Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks but did not comment on whether he would continue to support him, according to The Des Moines Register. Districts that had been seeing a   Trump effect appear to be the ones with higher concentrations of Latinos and Asians, Mr. Wasserman said. Also,   white women  \u2014   a group that may be especially motivated by animus toward Mr. Trump  \u2014   are also showing strikingly strong support for Mrs. Clinton this year, said William H. Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution. Though Ms. Comstock\u2019s district trends slightly Republican, voters twice supported Mr. Obama. Mr. Trump is not popular here. Mr. Davis, who represented the area for seven terms, said most voter aversion to Mr. Trump stemmed from his propensity for insults. \u201cThis is a pretty dignified, educated group, and they\u2019re just not into insulting people and all that,\u201d he said. \u201cNot particularly liberal, but dignified. \u201d Just one day before disavowing Mr. Trump, during a debate hosted by the local chamber of commerce here, Ms. Comstock cited a collaboration with Senator Tim Kaine, a fellow Virginian and the Democratic   nominee. She twice invoked Bill Clinton, the president whose administration she built a reputation investigating in the 1990s as a House chief counsel. She steered clear of saying Mr. Trump\u2019s name, saying she was \u201cstill watching\u201d the race to decide who would get her vote. LuAnn Bennett, a real estate developer who is challenging Ms. Comstock, on Wednesday slammed her for waiting so long to reject Mr. Trump. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that what my opponent was clearly \u2018watching\u2019 for was how best to preserve her own political career,\u201d she said.'"}, "time": 1742628306.8789735}
