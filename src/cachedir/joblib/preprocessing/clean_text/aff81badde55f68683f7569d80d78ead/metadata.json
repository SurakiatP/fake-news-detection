But on Friday, a group of scholars gathered here for what might be an editing session on the second. The occasion was a small conference with the uncolorful title \u201cThe Presidency of Barack Obama: A First Historical Assessment. \u201d While it had been planned more than a year ago, the election had forced more than a few participants to look at the papers they submitted in late October  \u2014   some of which referred to Donald J. Trump confidently in the past tense  \u2014   and shout, \u201cGet me rewrite!\u201d \u201cAfter election night, I instantly got emails from the participants, asking if we were going to have the same discussion,\u201d Julian E. Zelizer, the Princeton historian who organized the gathering, said before the proceedings. The purpose of the   event, which broke down the Obama presidency into topics including inequality, counterterrorism, immigration, the Supreme Court and race, was to offer what Mr. Zelizer called a historical \u201cfirst cut,\u201d by scholars who had \u201clived and felt\u201d the events of President Obama\u2019s terms in office. (The 15 papers, after revisions and editing, will be published in a book by Princeton University Press in about a year  \u2014     by the standards of scholarly publishing.) The mood among the overwhelmingly liberal group  \u2014   in contrast to how some participants recalled a similar gathering in 2008 to assess the presidency of George W. Bush, in the giddy days after President Obama\u2019s election  \u2014   was decidedly grim. The conference turned out to be \u201cgood practice for saying \u2018the Trump presidency\u2019 without the words getting stuck in your throat,\u201d Meg Jacobs, a research scholar at Princeton, said wryly. Ms. Jacobs, whose paper discussed President Obama\u2019s energy policies, noted the degree to which many policy achievements described in the papers relied on executive action, which can be easily reversed by a subsequent president, and waved her hand: gone. During the formal discussion, the nearly two dozen scholars gathered around a square table in a sunny conference room mostly stuck to the dispassionate long view, putting President Obama in the context of broad political and social forces. But occasional bulletins from the outside world underscored the feeling of being bunkered in a scholarly equivalent of the Situation Room, tracking the loss of more and more territory. \u201cNewsflash: Paul Ryan just announced that he wants to privatize Medicare,\u201d Michael Kazin, a professor at Georgetown University, interjected during a discussion of the political implications of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s policy design. \u201cSo that will be interesting. \u201d The nearly seven hours of discussion on Friday included debate on many   questions: Did the Obama presidency represent as much of a sharp break with that of George W. Bush as people might assume? Are the American people as divided as the extreme polarization of the political system suggests? What was more important to Republican political dominance: gerrymandering or conservative media? Several participants said that reading all the papers made them realize that President Obama had gotten more done,   in the face of relentless opposition than they had thought. But at the same time, many noted, his policies had often been designed in ways that failed  \u2014   fatally, it seemed in retrospect  \u2014   to generate political credit. One of the most ringing cases came from the sociologist Paul Starr, whose paper argued that President Obama, contrary to widespread belief, made significant progress in reducing income inequality, once benefits like food stamps and health care were factored in. He also offered a progressive defense of the 2009 stimulus package, citing what he called \u201ca stunning piece of data\u201d: In the absence of the stimulus and related measures, he said, the poverty rate would have gone up by 4. 5 percentage points. Instead it only went up 0. 5 percentage points. If his paper was guardedly optimistic, his postelection verdict was not. \u201cI\u2019m afraid all of what he did relating to reducing inequality is going to be wiped out,\u201d he said. The theme of a \u201cstealth state\u201d  \u2014   which allowed President Obama to push policies in ways that avoided triggering opposition, but also prevented building support for government action  \u2014   also came up in the discussions of education and environmental policy. And there was debate about President Obama\u2019s efforts, or lack thereof, to strengthen the Democratic Party itself, and about how much personality  \u2014   the X factor that academic historians, unlike journalists and most popular historians of the presidency, tend to play down  \u2014   mattered to events of the last eight years. After the formal discussion wrapped, Mr. Zelizer, the author of \u201cThe Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress and the Battle for the Great Society,\u201d said he found himself puzzling over the paradox of President Obama\u2019s astute political intelligence on the one hand, and his lack of attention to the partisan side of politics on the other. \u201cThat\u2019s why having this conversation after Trump makes a difference,\u201d he said. \u201cYou really see how not taking partisan political considerations seriously enough can cost the party and the country  \u2014   if you\u2019re a Democrat  \u2014   a huge amount. \u201d At a group dinner on Friday night at a nearby Italian restaurant, there was plenty of wine and gallows humor. Gary Gerstle, a professor at the University of Cambridge, in a toast, jokingly proposed a theme for the group\u2019s next gathering: secession. There were comparisons to Brexit, and with Europe in the 1930s. \u201cExcept now, given what\u2019s happened in the United States,\u201d Mr. Gerstle asked, \u201cwho\u2019s going to save the world this time?\u201d \u201cGermany!\u201d someone shouted. Jonathan Zimmerman, a historian of education at the University of Pennsylvania, said he wondered if 200 years from now, the most striking thing about President Obama to historians might not be that he was the first   president, but that he had a \u201cdifferent character from most people who become president. \u201d \u201cWe usually elect people who are the kind of people who want other people to really like them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut he doesn\u2019t seem to be that way at all. \u201d Mr. Gerstle said he hoped the first draft of the historians\u2019 papers, all written under the shadow of a presumed Clinton victory, would be saved, to provide a lesson for future scholars about the contingency of history. \u201cWe\u2019re always teaching our students not to write Whiggish history,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s easy to get conscripted into telling the story of your nation, where you disregard the losers and champion the winners. \u201d \u201cTrump\u2019s election may end up being a turning point, and historians will want to tell the story as if it were destined to happen,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut we were not totally crazy to think it wouldn\u2019t. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561794.989721}
