The email was one of thousands released by WikiLeaks from Podesta\u2019s hacked Gmail account. \\n\u201cAnd has that person been drawn and quartered?\u201d Tanden added. \u201cLike whole thing is f*cking insane.\u201d \\nClinton has said former Secretary of State Colin Powell suggested she use a private email, just as he did, while serving as the U.S.\u2019s top diplomat. Clinton also said she used a private email server for \u201cconvenience\u201d and it was done in accordance with State Department guidelines. Though, she did say it was a \u201cmistake\u201d for her to use a private server. \\nPowell, however, criticized Clinton for trying to bring him into the email issue. \\n\u201cSad thing,\u201d Powell wrote to a friend in a hacked email. \u201cHRC could have killed this two years ago by merely telling everyone honestly what she had done and not tie me to it.\u201d \\n\u201cI told her staff three times not to try that gambit. I had to throw a mini tantrum at a Hampton\u2019s [ sic ] party to get their attention. She keeps tripping into these \u2018character\u2019 minefields,\u201d Powell wrote, adding he tried to meet with Clinton aide Cheryl Mills to settle the issue. \\nThis report, by Michael Bastasch, was cross-posted by arrangement with the Daily Caller News Foundation.'"}, "time": 1742561758.4705162}
