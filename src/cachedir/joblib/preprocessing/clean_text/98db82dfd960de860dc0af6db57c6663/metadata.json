In prison, he organized   sessions for murderers like himself who wanted to repent. Rather than seek to forget his crime, he spoke often of the man he had shot and killed, a Long Island police officer named Matthew Giglio. And he encouraged other inmates to do the same, to speak their victim\u2019s name and to remember that somewhere on the outside, all these years later, a family was still grieving. \u201cJohn would push us,\u201d said one friend, Sebastian Ventimiglia, who spent 37 years in prison for murder. \u201cIt was heavy, man, and John was the group leader. \u201d Mr. MacKenzie was, by all accounts, a model inmate. He had not committed a single disciplinary infraction since 1980. But one fact about him would never change, not even after 40 years in prison: He was a cop killer, and he finally realized that the parole board was unlikely to ever think of him as anything else. \u201cI can\u2019t redeem myself in the eyes of anybody,\u201d he said at his parole hearing in July. A week after the parole board turned him down for the 10th time, his exemplary prison record came to an end: On Aug. 4, Mr. MacKenzie, 70, hanged himself with a sheet at the Fishkill Correctional Facility in Beacon, N. Y. For the last 15 years, he beseeched the board to consider the man he had become and not only the crime he had committed. \u201cI believe you will agree that I should be given the opportunity to prove that rehabilitation really works and that I should be released,\u201d he wrote to the parole board. In this, Mr. MacKenzie had a number of supporters, including the bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Albany and a state judge, who this year began to fine the parole board for what she believed was its unwillingness to evaluate Mr. MacKenzie\u2019s rehabilitation. \u201cThis case begs the question: If parole isn\u2019t granted to this petitioner, when and under what circumstances would it be granted?\u201d Justice Maria G. Rosa of State Supreme Court wrote in May. The possibility of rehabilitation is a central premise underpinning New York State\u2019s penal system, where   sentences like the one Mr. MacKenzie received  \u2014   25 years to life  \u2014   are typical. Such sentences suggest the possibility of release but leave the decision to the parole board. One recent    survey found that the parole board in New York has the power to leave more inmates  \u2014   9, 262 as of January of this year  \u2014   in prison until their dying breath than any state but California. Mr. MacKenzie became eligible for release in 2000, after 25 years in prison. When he appeared before the parole board, he said that he wished he had been the one to die, and not Officer Giglio. \u201cI wish that night it was me,\u201d he said the first of many times that he would appear before the board. But when pressed to explain his crime, a question he would be asked at every parole hearing, Mr. MacKenzie struggled. He said that he could not actually remember shooting Officer Giglio. He was in the middle of a blackout  \u2014   he used the term \u201cautomatism\u201d  \u2014   which he attributed to the pills he was then taking. There were a lot  \u2014   Darvon, Norgesic Forte, Valium and others. It had taken years, in fact, for him to even accept that he had shot Officer Giglio. While reading thousands of pages of testimony from his trial, as he prepared for his appeals, \u201clittle bits and pieces started coming and I realize I did this,\u201d he later told a parole board. John MacKenzie had been a   thief and fence until 2:30 a. m. on Oct. 7, 1975. At that moment, he was stealing 240 blouses from a women\u2019s clothing store in West Hempstead, tossing them out a window into the trunk of a car, when the police drove by. They saw an idling car, strewed clothing, an open window  \u2014   and called for backup. Officer Giglio, who was driving an ambulance on a special assignment, soon arrived. Mr. Mackenzie, a big man with a    face, tried to flee. The officer held a flashlight, the thief a gun. There was a shot, and Mr. MacKenzie ran. Seven hours later, a dragnet of officers found him hiding under a tarp in a garage 250 yards from the scene. The bullet he had fired pierced Officer Giglio\u2019s intestines and severed his aorta. In the ambulance that he had driven to the scene, he was rushed to Mercy Medical Center in Rockville Centre. His kidneys failed. Gangrene set in. His right leg was amputated three weeks later. Friends and relatives hung   pictures of his children so they would be right there when he finally opened his eyes. His wife rarely left his side during the 10 weeks he clung to life. Each evening at the Giglio home in Valley Stream, the grandmother would turn off the television before the children could hear the nightly news, with its updates on their father\u2019s condition. The three children  \u2014   Doreen, 10 Regina, 8 Matthew Jr. 4  \u2014   would gather at the kitchen table to pray for their father. The TV turned off, the prayers at the kitchen table  \u2014   those were some of Matthew\u2019s earliest memories. Officer Giglio died on Dec. 16, 1975, at age 35. Mr. MacKenzie was convicted of   murder and sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. He would have a chance at parole when the new millennium rolled round, but that seemed a long way off. Mr. MacKenzie remained unrepentant until 1983. That year, locked in Attica Correctional Facility, he attended an educational program about crime and punishment. He provoked an argument, saying, \u201cI\u2019m a victim, you know, I got 25 years to life. \u201d One of the lecturers let him know just how wrong he was. They began to talk. \u201cThat was my epiphany,\u201d he recalled decades later at a parole hearing. \u201cFrom that day on my whole life changed. \u201d In prison, Mr. MacKenzie was something of an organizer. He helped inmates record themselves reading books aloud  \u2014   so they would have something to send to their children. He taught some to read and encouraged others to get college degrees. After years of   he received permission to convene a   group for violent criminals. As part of the program, the inmates met with other crime victims or their relatives. That was how Carolee Brooks found herself visiting Green Haven Correctional Facility in the 1990s. Ms. Brooks told the group about her son\u2019s murder at a bar in Manhattan. She recounted how, during the ensuing trial, she reminded the assistant district attorney not to refer to her son as only \u201cthe bartender\u201d but by his name, David. For each crime, she told the group, there was a victim whose memory needed tending. She encouraged the inmates to think of their victims by name, even to say those names aloud. Mr. MacKenzie suggested they start immediately. Around the circle they went. Some said it quietly. Others hung their heads. Matthew Giglio. He began saying the name often. He drafted a letter to Officer Giglio, full of things he wanted to say. He imagined himself apologizing to Officer Giglio\u2019s family. As a prisoner, he was not allowed to contact them directly. But he asked a childhood friend who had become a detective to find out through an intermediary whether the Giglios would be receptive. He spoke to a television reporter about his remorse, hoping the Giglio family would be watching. The Giglios wanted none of it. \u201cDon\u2019t apologize to me,\u201d Phyllis Giglio Carioti, the officer\u2019s widow, said in a phone interview last month. \u201cGet your forgiveness from God. \u201d Every other year, as Mr. MacKenzie prepared to go before the parole board, the Giglio children would also prepare. They gathered to write letters opposing parole. In front of television cameras, they explained that justice and public safety demanded that their father\u2019s killer remain behind bars. \u201cWhat I went through, with my children preparing for this, preparing speeches, getting out the scrapbook,\u201d Ms. Giglio Carioti said. \u201cWatching them fall apart all over again. \u201d Doreen Velardi, the officer\u2019s older daughter, asked at a news conference in June: \u201cWhat if he seeks revenge on my family? Who will protect us?\u201d In an interview last month, Matthew Giglio Jr. said, \u201cHaving him granted parole would not only be a dishonor to our father but to all law enforcement officials. \u201d James Carver, the president of the Nassau County Police Benevolent Association, was of the same opinion. \u201cIf you intentionally kill a police officer, you should go away for life,\u201d Mr. Carver said. \u201cThere is not much more to it than that. \u201d Of Mr. MacKenzie, he added, \u201cHe could be the most caring guy in the world, and my position is, you can do God\u2019s work from behind bars. \u201d That view resonates among many officers, active and retired. \u201cNo Parole for Cop Killers\u201d is the slogan on a website devoted to the memory of slain officers, Officer Down Memorial Page, where visitors can sign up to receive alerts about parole hearings. It says it has generated more than 170, 000 \u201cno parole\u201d letters  \u2014   a number of them opposing Mr. MacKenzie\u2019s release. During Mr. MacKenzie\u2019s parole proceedings, the commissioners would sometimes note that there was significant \u201ccommunity opposition\u201d to his release. But during parole hearings, the sticking point that arose year after year was the fact that Mr. MacKenzie said he had no memory of the crime. \u201cJust because I don\u2019t remember doesn\u2019t preclude me from being responsible for my actions,\u201d Mr. MacKenzie said in 2005, explaining that he feared the parole board \u201cthought I was trying to avoid accepting responsibility. \u201d But for the board to find remorse, \u201cit has to be an unequivocal mea culpa, there can be no \u2018but,\u2019\u201d said Thomas O\u2019Sullivan, a murderer who was imprisoned for 31 years and was close friends with Mr. MacKenzie during the 1980s at Green Haven. Matthew Giglio Jr. said, \u201cIf someone doesn\u2019t remember taking a human life, how can they be truly remorseful?\u201d As years passed, Mr. MacKenzie\u2019s friends were paroled. One had bashed a man\u2019s head with a bowling ball. Another had been convicted in a    plot. \u201cThere was nobody in his life,\u201d Brian Conlan, a close friend who was paroled in 2007, said. In a 2013 letter, Mr. MacKenzie wrote to a friend, \u201cIt seems all those who were close to me have gone home and there\u2019s no one left. \u201d During visiting hours, inmates would invite him to meet their families, because he so rarely had visitors. He was estranged from his two daughters until they reconnected in the final year of his life. He began to consider that he might die in prison. He consulted   charts, and he made one last bid for freedom. He filed a lawsuit claiming the parole board was wrong to focus solely on the nature of his crime, without considering his rehabilitation or the likelihood of his living a   life upon release. Justice Rosa sided with him, ruling that he was entitled to a new hearing. In 2014, he was transferred to Fishkill from Woodbourne Correctional Facility, where he had been unable to restart his   program. At Fishkill, Mr. MacKenzie encountered setback after setback. He initially shared a room with two young inmates, whom he described in a letter as schizophrenic and bipolar. They seemed impressed that he had killed a police officer. The 2015 escape of two inmates from the Clinton Correctional Facility in the far northern part of the state, which led to a renewed focus on prison security, had a disastrous effect on Mr. MacKenzie. At Fishkill, corrections officers began conducting frequent bed counts at night, to ensure that no inmates were missing, often waking Mr. MacKenzie. A light sleeper, he complained of being tortured by as many as four \u201crude awakenings\u201d a night, he wrote to a friend. The murders of officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge, La. this year could not have happened at a worse time for him, he told a fellow inmate. At his July hearing, the parole board rejected Mr. MacKenzie\u2019s release and found in a    vote, that there was \u201ca reasonable probability\u201d that he would again violate the law and that given the nature of his crime his release would \u201cundermine respect for the law. \u201d For the first time, however, he received a single favorable vote. There was a second government official on his side as well: the judge. She had become fed up with the parole board\u2019s handling of Mr. MacKenzie\u2019s case and had started fining the state $500 a day until the board reconsidered him for parole. But Mr. MacKenzie was done waiting. In an Aug. 2 letter to his daughter, he seemed to be saying goodbye. \u201cI wanted you to know how much suffering I\u2019ve been through just in case you get a chance to let Doreen, Regina and Matthew Jr. know how much I\u2019ve suffered! !! That should make them very happy! !!\u201d In his letter he also quoted a Buddhist text: \u201cCan a new wrong expiate old wrongs?\u201d He mailed the letter. The next night, he joked with two prisoners in nearby cells about how his remaining behind bars had cost the state, since the judge\u2019s order, almost $20, 000. The three prisoners returned to their bunks. It was not quite 11 p. m. At 6:30 a. m. when a corrections officer ordered all the inmates out of their cells for a head count, Mr. MacKenzie did not emerge. The officer found him dead, a sheet around his neck, the other end knotted to the window grate.'"}, "time": 1742563322.091499}
