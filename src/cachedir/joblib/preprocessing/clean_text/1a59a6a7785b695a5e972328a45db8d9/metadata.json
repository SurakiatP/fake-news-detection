Scarborough said that although he thought the executive order was bad policy, the appeals court\u2019s ruling was \u201claughable\u201d and he said it will be overturned. \u201cOur law professors always told us  \u2014   bad facts made bad law,\u201d he said. \u201cHorrific facts coupled with horrific politics makes for horrific law. That\u2019s exactly what happened here. \u201d \u201cThis decision, though, is laughable,\u201d Scarborough conitnued. \u201cThis is, for me, the most disturbing part of the entire case. And by the way, at the end, this isn\u2019t going to matter because I think the White House is going to fix it up, briefly fix it up. They could do a couple quick changes and take care of these problems. But the Ninth said, \u2018The government has pointed to no evidence that any alien from any of the countries named in the order have perpetrated a terrorist attack in the United States.\u2019 As if it is the executive branches job to actually get the Intel community in and say these are all the things that are going to happen. No, in fact, Barack Obama worked with a bipartisan Congress to come up with these seven countries, not because there was specific attacks, but because they saw deteriorating security situation that they wanted to remedy. They wanted to prevent attacks. That\u2019s the entire purpose of that. \u201d \u201cThis will be overturned,\u201d he added.'"}, "time": 1742563299.4173605}
