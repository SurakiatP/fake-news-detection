{"duration": 0.4947235584259033, "input_args": {"text": "'The last time Steve Kerr was in Beirut, his birthplace, with the bombs pounding the runway and the assassination of his father six months away, he left by car. The airport was closed. There was talk of taking a cruise ship to Cyprus, or accompanying an ambassador on a helicopter to Tel Aviv or even crossing into Israel on a bus. A military plane headed to Cairo had an empty seat, but it went to someone else. Finally, a hired driver took Kerr over the Lebanon Mountains and across the Syrian border to Damascus, then on to Amman, Jordan. It felt like an escape. \u201cI\u2019m fearful that all this uncertainty and inconvenience, not to mention even a sense of physical danger, has not done Steve\u2019s image of Beirut much good, and in his present mood he wonders what any of us are doing here,\u201d his father, Malcolm H. Kerr, the president of the American University of Beirut, wrote to other family members that day in August 1983. A few months later, Malcolm Kerr was shot twice in the back of the head outside his university office. Steve Kerr was 18 then, quiet and  . He was a lightly recruited freshman at the University of Arizona, before it was a basketball power. It took a vivid imagination to see him becoming an N. B. A. champion as a player and a coach, now leading the Golden State Warriors. But perhaps it should be no surprise that, at 51, Kerr has found his voice in public discourse, talking about much more than basketball: heavy topics like gun control,   protests, presidential politics and Middle East policy. With an educated and evenhanded approach, he steps into discussions that most others in his position purposely avoid or know little about, chewing through the gray areas in a world that increasingly paints itself in bold contrasts. In many ways, he has grown into an echo of his father. \u201cThe truly civilized man is marked by empathy,\u201d Malcolm Kerr wrote in a foreword to a collection of essays called \u201cThe   Confrontation of June 1967: An Arab Perspective. \u201d \u201cBy his recognition that the thought and understanding of men of other cultures may differ sharply from his own, that what seems natural to him may appear grotesque to others. \u201d In a rare and sometimes emotional interview this fall, Kerr spoke about the death of his father and his family\u2019s deep roots in Lebanon and the Middle East. Some of the words sounded familiar. \u201cPut yourself in someone else\u2019s shoes and look at it from a bigger perspective,\u201d he said. \u201cWe live in this complex world of gray areas. Life is so much easier if it could be black and white, good and evil. \u201d Providing commentary on the state of today\u2019s politics and culture is not a prerequisite for Kerr\u2019s job. There are sports fans, maybe the majority of them, who wish athletes and coaches would keep their nonsports opinions to themselves  \u2014   stand for the anthem, be thankful for your good fortune, express only humility, and provide little but smiles and autographs. Kerr understands that. Sports are a diversion for most who follow them, \u201conly meaningful to us and our fans,\u201d he said. In a sports world that takes itself too seriously, that perspective is part of the appeal of Kerr and the Warriors. They won the 2015 N. B. A. championship, were   last season and remain a top team this season. They seem to be having more fun than anyone else. But Kerr also knows that sports are an active ingredient of American culture. He knows, as well as anyone, that players are complicated, molded by background, race, religion and circumstance. And Kerr is, too: a man whose grandparents left the United States to work in the Middle East, whose father was raised there, whose mother adopted it, whose family has a different and broader perspective than most. The Kerrs are a family touched by terrorism in the most personal way. Malcolm Kerr was not a random victim. He was a target. That gives Steve Kerr a voice. His job gives him a platform. You will excuse him if he has a few things to say. \u201cIt\u2019s really simple to demonize Muslims because of our anger over   but it\u2019s obviously so much more complex than that,\u201d he said. \u201cThe vast majority of Muslims are   people, just like the vast majority of Christians and Buddhists and Jews and any other religion. People are people. \u201d He delved into modern Middle East history, about World War II and the Holocaust and the 1948 creation of Israel, about the   War in 1967, about peace accords and the   conflict and the Iraq War and the United States\u2019 scattered chase for whatever shifting   it has at any particular time. \u201cMy dad would have been able to explain it all to me,\u201d Kerr said. Instead, he absorbed it as a boy and applies it as an adult. \u201cHe at least gave me the understanding that it\u2019s complex. And as easy as it is to demonize people, there\u2019s a lot of different factors involved in creating this culture that we\u2019re in now. \u201d Malcolm Kerr was a professor at U. C. L. A. for 20 years, and the sprawling ranch house where the family lived in Pacific Palisades, Calif. has a flat driveway and a basketball hoop bolted to the roof above the garage. Steve Kerr spent countless hours in the driveway practicing the shot that would give him the N. B. A. record for career   percentage that still stands. But not all memories in the driveway are about basketball. \u201cI remember when the Camp David accords happened,\u201d Kerr said, recalling the 1978 peace talks between Menachem Begin of Israel and Anwar   of Egypt, shepherded by President Jimmy Carter. Kerr had just entered his teens. \u201cOne of my best friends was a guy named David Zuckerman, a Jewish guy, and his father was an English professor,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cMr. Zuckerman and David drove me home from baseball practice or something, and we pull up in the driveway and my dad sees us and comes running out. Mr. Zuckerman\u2019s name was Marvin, and my dad said: \u2018Marvin, Marvin! Did you see the picture today of Begin and Sadat?\u2019 It was the biggest thing. It would have been the equivalent of the Dodgers winning the World Series. He was so excited for that moment because that is what he really hoped for: Middle East peace. That was his dream. That day, I\u2019ll never forget it. \u201d Kerr paused. \u201cAnd then it was only a short time later that Sadat was killed,\u201d he said. The Sadat assassination was in October 1981, just 27 months before Malcolm Kerr was killed. Malcolm Kerr\u2019s parents, Stanley and Elsa Kerr, were American missionaries who met in the Middle East after World War I. He worked for American Near East Relief in Turkey during the slaughter of countless Armenians (detailed later in his memoir, \u201cThe Lions of Marash\u201d). She had traveled to Istanbul to study Turkish and to teach. They married in 1921 and moved to Lebanon to run orphanages. They went on to teach at the American University of Beirut for 40 years. Malcolm was one of their four children. He went to the United States for prep school and graduated from Princeton before he returned to A. U. B. for graduate school. It was there that he met Ann Zwicker, an Occidental College student from California spending a year studying abroad. Beirut was a cosmopolitan,   city on the Mediterranean, a mix of Christians and Muslims seemingly in balance, if not harmony. A. U. B. was founded in 1866 (it celebrated its 150th anniversary on Dec. 3) as a bastion of free thought and diversity, welcoming all races and religions. As wars and crises suffocated the Middle East in recent decades, it has often felt like an island, protected by prestige and  . Malcolm and Ann married and raised four children: Susan, John, Steve and Andrew. The first three were born in Beirut. Malcolm Kerr took a teaching job at A. U. B. but the Kerrs settled in California when Steve was a toddler. Malcolm Kerr\u2019s tenure at U. C. L. A. was sprinkled with sojourns and sabbaticals that persistently pulled the family back to the Middle East. Steve Kerr spent two separate school years in Cairo. There were summers in Beirut and Tunisia, another year in France, and road trips circling the Mediterranean in a Volkswagen van. Steve \u201cwas not always thrilled,\u201d he admitted, to leave friends and the comfort of California. He hated to miss sports camps and football and basketball games at U. C. L. A. where the Kerrs had season tickets. In hindsight, though, his family\u2019s long history in the Middle East, beginning nearly 100 years ago, shaped him in ways that he only now realizes. \u201cIt\u2019s an American story, something I\u2019m very proud of, the work that my grandparents did,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cIt just seemed like a time when Americans were really helping around the world, and one of the reasons we were beloved was the amount of help we provided, whether it was after World War I, like my grandparents, or World War II. I\u2019m sort of nostalgic for that sort of perception. We were the good guys. I felt it growing up, when I was living in Egypt, when I was overseas. Americans were revered in much of the Middle East. And it\u2019s just so sad what has happened to us the last few decades. \u201d Kerr was in high school when his father was named president of A. U. B. in 1982. It was Malcolm Kerr\u2019s dream job. But the appointment came as Lebanon was embroiled in civil war. Yasir Arafat\u2019s Palestine Liberation Organization, expelled from Syria, had its headquarters in Beirut. Iranian Shiites, followers of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, had moved into Lebanon and given voice to the impoverished Shiite minority there. The Christian population was shrinking, and Lebanon was in the middle of a tug of war between Israel and Syria. \u201cI bet there\u2019s a   chance I\u2019ll get bumped off early on,\u201d Malcolm Kerr told his daughter, Susan, in March 1982, she recalled in her memoir, \u201cOne Family\u2019s Response to Terrorism. \u201d He accepted the job the next morning. The Israeli invasion of Lebanon, and the countermove by the Iranians to send its Iranian Revolutionary Guards there through Syria, began in June 1982, weeks before Malcolm Kerr was to start the new job. In the chaos,   militants were organizing and would eventually become Hezbollah. Malcolm Kerr was kept in New York until things settled, but A. U. B. \u2019s acting president, David Dodge, was kidnapped in July, and A. U. B. was in need of leadership. Malcolm Kerr arrived in August, expressing hope that the destruction and death closing in on the campus could be kept outside its walls. (Dodge, who was released by his captors after a year, died in 2009.) Back in California, Steve began his senior year and starred on the basketball team. \u201cI wanted him to be at games, but I knew that he was doing what he loved,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cAnd when you\u2019re 16 or 17, you\u2019re so  . You just want to play and do your thing. \u201d Malcolm Kerr wrote letters home almost daily. They detailed tense meetings with political leaders, the latest assaults on Beirut, the assassination in September 1982 of the Lebanese   Bashir Gemayel, the interviews with foreign journalists. Most were filled with optimism and good humor. \u201cThe thought of being in Pacific Palisades for Christmas is more appealing than I can say, and I wouldn\u2019t miss the chance for anything,\u201d he wrote in one. \u201cHopefully I\u2019ll get there in time to catch a few of Steve\u2019s basketball games and watch Andrew wash the cars. \u201d That December, the Kerrs posed at their California house wearing matching A. U. B. sweatshirts. Steve Kerr went with his mother and brother Andrew to Beirut in the summer of 1983, before he went to play at Arizona for   coach Lute Olson. A few months before, militants had bombed the United States embassy in Beirut, killing 63, including 17 Americans. But the visit fell during what felt like a lull in the war. \u201cWe went hiking in the mountains above Beirut and swimming in the Mediterranean,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cThe house where they lived was on campus  \u2014   the presidential house, the Marquand House. It was beautiful. It was surreal. There was a butler. We didn\u2019t have that back home. But now he was living the life of the president. We had a great time during the day, and then we played cards after dinner outside. \u201d The trick was leaving. Ann Kerr went with Steve to the airport in August. \u201cThere was some question about whether flights would be going out because of everything that was happening,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cWe were in the terminal, and all of a sudden there was a blast. It wasn\u2019t in the terminal but on the runways. The whole place just froze. Everybody just froze. People started gathering, saying, \u2018We\u2019ve got to get the hell out of here.\u2019 My mom grabbed me, and I remember running out of the terminal and through the parking lot. It was really scary. I remember thinking, \u2018This is real. \u2019\u201d The Kerrs pondered options for getting Steve out. They learned that a private plane of diplomats was going to the United States Marine base and there might be an available seat on the flight back out. Steve spent hours waiting, talking to Marines. In the end, there were no seats. The Kerrs eventually made arrangements for a university driver to take Steve over the mountains, through Syria to Jordan. (The driver, a longtime friend of the family, was killed by a sniper in Beirut in 1985.) On an early morning in October 1983, a truck bomb destroyed the   Marine barracks. Among the dead were 220 Marines and 21 other service members. \u201cI remember looking at all the photos afterward,\u201d Kerr said. He started to cry. \u201cI see all these, the nicest people, who I met and they were showing us around the base and just trying to do their jobs and keep the peace. And a truck bomb?\u201d Kerr said he recognized some of the faces of the dead. \u201cThere is a chaplain who had come over and kind of taken us under his wing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe nicest guy. And I saw his face. . .. \u201d Kerr wiped his eyes and took a deep breath. \u201cWhat has it been, 30 years? And it still brings me to tears. \u201d In December, John visited his parents in Beirut. They had a videotape of Steve\u2019s first game for Arizona a couple of weeks before. The picture was fuzzy, shot without sound from a camera high in the gym, and they could not always tell which player was Steve. It did not matter. \u201cI think he scored three baskets, and we must have watched each of them 10 times, rewinding the tape over and over again just to relish every detail,\u201d John wrote in an entry for a family scrapbook made on an anniversary of Malcolm Kerr\u2019s death. He called it \u201cDad\u2019s and my high point as sports fans. \u201d In the middle of a night in January 1984, Kerr got a call in his dorm room from Vahe Simonian, a family friend and a vice president at A. U. B. who was based in New York. Simonian told Kerr that his father had been killed. The assassination on Jan. 18, 1984, was international news, including on the front page of The New York Times. Malcolm Kerr, 52, had stepped off the elevator toward his office in College Hall and was shot in the back of the head. The two unknown assailants escaped. A group calling itself Islamic Holy War took responsibility later that day. \u201cDr. Kerr was a modest and extremely popular figure among his 4, 800 students and faculty, according to his colleagues here,\u201d Times reporter Thomas L. Friedman wrote from Beirut that day. \u201cHe was killed, his friends insist, not for being who he was, but because now that the Marines and the American Embassy in Beirut are smothered in security, he was the most vulnerable prominent American in Lebanon and a choice target for militants trying to intimidate Americans into leaving. \u201d Andrew Kerr, who was 15 at the time, heard about his father\u2019s death on a radio in a shop near A. U. B. \u2019s campus. Ann Kerr learned about it while waiting at a campus guardhouse, out of the rain, for a friend. She ran to College Hall, to the second floor, where she found her husband \u201clying on the floor, face down, his briefcase and umbrella in front of him,\u201d she wrote in her memoir, \u201cCome With Me From Lebanon. \u201d A memorial service was held a few days later. John came from Cairo and Susan came from Taiwan. Steve was the only one of the children who did not attend. He missed another one at Princeton, but attended a third in Los Angeles. \u201cIt sounds bad,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, the basketball wasn\u2019t more important. But the logistics were really tricky. And it was cathartic for me to just play. \u201d He had a breakout game in a victory over rival Arizona State two nights after his father\u2019s death. The Wildcats had been   but won eight of their final 14 games. The next year, they reached the N. C. A. A. tournament on their way to becoming a lasting national power. Four years later, Kerr was the target of pregame taunts at Arizona State. A group of students shouted, \u201cP. L. O. P. L. O. ,\u201d \u201cYour father\u2019s history,\u201d and \u201cWhy don\u2019t you join the Marines and go back to Beirut?\u201d \u201cWhen I heard it, I just dropped the ball and started shaking,\u201d Kerr said at the time. \u201cI sat down for a minute. I\u2019ll admit they got to me. I had tears in my eyes. For one thing, it brought back memories of my dad. But, for another thing, it was just sad that people would do something like that. \u201d Ann   is 82, wears Keds and keeps her hair in a   bob. She is the longtime coordinator of the Fulbright program at U. C. L. A. and oversees a class called \u201cPerceptions of the United States Abroad. \u201d She is also an emeritus trustee at A. U. B. and usually goes back to Beirut once a year for meetings. She remarried in 2008. She and Ken Adams share the California house that she and Malcolm bought in 1969. The stately living room, with a grand piano and views of the Pacific Ocean, is neatly decorated with treasures of a   life, like etchings of Cairo and Ann\u2019s framed watercolors of Tunisia. The mantel has an   photograph of Steve and Andrew in a field of flowers in Morocco. \u201cI would say Steve\u2019s intellectual interests really blossomed in the last 10 years,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think of Steve being like Malcolm. \u201d They shared a passion for sports (the children\u2019s    limit for television did not apply to sports) and an irreverent sense of humor. But Steve is more diplomatic than his father, she said. A nearby guest room was where the three Kerr boys slept. The bunk beds that Steve and Andrew shared are gone, but there is a painting that Steve did as a boy  \u2014   a   of him in a U. C. L. A. shirt and a Dodgers cap, his blond hair hanging past his ears. The bathroom has a painting of poinsettias he did when he was 9, and a closet contains his screen prints of boats in Cairo. \u201cHere\u2019s a picture of Steve, the ornery teenager,\u201d   said on a recent Sunday afternoon, stopping in a hallway lined with family photographs. \u201cHe was always snarling in pictures. Now he has to smile for photos. The irony of it all. \u201d Across the hall is the room that Malcolm used as an office. His children harbor happy memories of the sound of his typewriter clacking and the smell of the popcorn that he liked as a snack. The backyard, with wide ocean views that test the flexibility of the human neck  \u2014   from Los Angeles on the left, to the Santa Monica Mountains on the right  \u2014   features a broad patio. On Sunday afternoons, it was frequently filled with professors, neighbors, visiting dignitaries and friends from around the world. It was the family\u2019s connection to the Middle East that made his childhood unique. \u201cIt would be totally different without that,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cTotally different. I wouldn\u2019t be exposed to not only the travel and the interaction with people, but I wouldn\u2019t be exposed to the political conversations at the table and at barbecues about what was going on in the world. \u201d But talk around the house was more likely to involve the Dodgers or Bruins. Malcolm was a good athlete, a basketball player growing up and an avid tennis player until the end. He and Steve spent a lot of time at the high school hitting and fielding, and Malcolm sometimes joined Steve in the driveway. \u201cHe was a lefty and had a nice hook shot,\u201d Kerr said with a laugh. Kerr credits his father for his demeanor on the sideline as an N. B. A. coach: calm and quiet, mostly, and never one to berate a player. Kerr was not always that way. \u201cWhen I was 8, 9, 10 years old, I had a horrible temper,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t control it. Everything I did, if I missed a shot, if I made an out, I got so angry. It was embarrassing. It really was. Baseball was the worst. If I was pitching and I walked somebody, I would throw my glove on the ground. I was such a brat. He and my mom would be in the stands watching, and he never really said anything until we got home. He had the sense that I needed to learn on my own, and anything he would say would mean more after I calmed down. \u201d His father, Kerr said, was what every Little League parent should be. The talks would come later, casual and nonchalant, conversations instead of lectures. \u201cHe was an observer,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd he let me learn and experience. I try to give our guys a lot of space and speak at the right time. Looking back on it, I think my dad was a huge influence on me, on my coaching. \u201d Kerr played for some of the best basketball coaches in history  \u2014   Olson at Arizona, Phil Jackson with the Chicago Bulls and Gregg Popovich with the San Antonio Spurs among them. By the standards of basketball coaches, they were worldly men with interests far beyond the court. \u201cI remember Phil talking to the team about gun control, and asking the players: \u2018How many of you have guns? How many of you know that if you have a gun in your house you\u2019re more likely to have a fatality in your house? \u2019\u201d Kerr said. \u201cIt was a real discussion, with guys saying that we need to have some level of protection, because we are vulnerable in many ways, too. \u201cAnd I remember one presidential election, it was probably 2000, I was with the Spurs and we did two teams shooting  \u2014   the silver team against the black team or whatever,\u201d he said, referring to a drill run by Popovich. \u201cPop was like, \u2018O. K. Democrats down there, Republicans down here.\u2019 I think it was about 12 against two at that point, so he had to even up the teams a little bit. He would just make it interesting. \u201d Kerr  \u2014   who has three children, all young adults, with his wife, Margot  \u2014   has never talked about his father in front of the team, and Warriors players have only a vague notion of Kerr\u2019s family history. It is context, mostly, an unstated part of his background. \u201cI really realized from Pop and Phil that I could use my experience as a kid and growing up to my advantage as a coach,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cAnd connect with players and try to keep that healthy perspective. Keep it fun, and don\u2019t take it too seriously. \u201d It was during Kerr\u2019s tenure with San Antonio that the family, after years of reflection following the 1996 passage of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, decided to sue Iran. The Kerrs came to believe that   Hezbollah had targeted Malcolm. \u201cI didn\u2019t need revenge, I didn\u2019t need closure,\u201d Steve Kerr said. \u201cSo I was indifferent to the lawsuit. But then I recognized that it was important to a couple of members of my family, my sister and my younger brother, in particular. \u201d When it came time to testify in United States District Court in Washington in December 2002, Kerr was with the Spurs, in the last of his 15 seasons in the N. B. A. He did not want to miss games. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody better than Pop to talk about something like this,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cI told him, \u2018I don\u2019t really want people knowing what it is.\u2019 I didn\u2019t want the attention. But I also don\u2019t want people thinking I\u2019m injured. So Pop said: \u2018You missed two games for personal reasons. Big deal. Your reputation precedes you. Nobody is going to question what\u2019s going on with you.\u2019 And he was right. I told my teammates and nothing ever really came of it. \u201d He testified in a nearly empty courtroom, missing two Spurs\u2019 road games on the West Coast. The Kerrs learned two months later that they had won the suit  \u2014   millions of dollars that they may never see. But money was never the point. \u201cIt provides a structure to enable people to channel their feelings through justice and the rules of law, rather than become vigilantes,\u201d his sister, who is now known as Susan van de Ven, said in a phone interview from England, where she is involved in politics as a county councillor. \u201cIt gives a very focused approach to people who are rightly and insanely aggrieved. That\u2019s the kind of culture we should have. We shouldn\u2019t be responding with violence. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s why Steve talked about guns. It\u2019s all related, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Her book detailed the family\u2019s experience with the lawsuit. The night before the Warriors visited President Obama to celebrate their 2015 N. B. A. championship, Steve had dinner with Andrew, who works for an architectural design and residential builder in Washington. They discussed what Steve might say to the president. Andrew recommended complimenting him on his efforts toward gun control. Kerr did. In June, at the end of a podcast with Bay Area sports columnist Tim Kawakami, Kerr asked if he could raise one more topic. Our government is \u201cinsane,\u201d he said, not to adopt stronger background checks on guns that most Americans agree upon. \u201cAs somebody who has had a family member shot and killed, it just devastates me every time I read about this stuff, like what happened in Orlando,\u201d Kerr said, referring to the June massacre at a Florida nightclub. \u201cAnd then it\u2019s even more devastating to see the government just cowing to the N. R. A. and going to this totally outdated Bill of Rights, right to bear arms. If you want to own a musket, fine. But come on. \u201d Since then, Kerr has become a   voice in sports for matters of bigger meaning. It surprises his family in some ways, knowing that he was probably the quietest of the siblings as a child. \u201cHe\u2019s carrying around the family business in another discipline,\u201d said John Kerr, a professor of community sustainability at Michigan State. \u201cThere was no way he would do anything for a living that didn\u2019t involve sports. No way. And now that he\u2019s at the pro level, he has the opportunity to speak out. He\u2019s smart enough to realize he can do it. \u201d N. B. A. training camps began just as debate swirled over the decision by Colin Kaepernick, the San Francisco 49ers quarterback, not to stand for the national anthem, a protest over the killing of unarmed black men by police officers. Amid the divisiveness, Kerr was a nuanced voice in the middle. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter what side you\u2019re on on the Kaepernick stuff, you better be disgusted with the things that are happening,\u201d Kerr said. He added: \u201cI understand people who are offended by his stance. Maybe they have a military family member or maybe they lost someone in a war and maybe that anthem means a lot more to them than someone else. But then you flip it around, and what about nonviolent protests? That\u2019s America. This is what our country is about. \u201d In November, after the presidential election, Kerr was among the N. B. A. coaches, including Popovich, who criticized the state of political discourse in the age of Donald J. Trump. \u201cPeople are getting paid millions of dollars to go on TV and scream at each other, whether it\u2019s in sports or politics or entertainment, and I guess it was only a matter of time before it spilled into politics,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cBut then all of a sudden you\u2019re faced with the reality that the man who\u2019s going to lead you has routinely used racist, misogynist, insulting words. \u201d It is no surprise, then, that Kerr also has opinions on the Middle East. Like his father decades ago, Kerr said he believes that American policies have muddied the region. The heart of the problem, he said, stems from the lack of a   solution for Israel and Palestine. The Iraq War made things worse. \u201cTo use Colin Powell\u2019s line, \u2018If you break it, you own it,\u2019 and now we own it,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s, like, \u2018Oh, my God, wait, it\u2019s so much more complicated than we thought.\u2019 Everybody looks back and thinks we would have been way better off not going to war. That was really dumb. But history repeats itself all the time. We didn\u2019t need to go into Vietnam, but circumstances, patriotism, anger, fear  \u2014   all these things lead into war. It\u2019s a history of the world. It just so happens that now is probably the scariest time since I\u2019ve been alive. \u201d In Beirut, A. U. B. still thrives. On its campus overlooking the Mediterranean is a new College Hall, a virtual replica of the one where Malcolm Kerr was killed, the building destroyed by bombs in 1991. There is the dignified Marquand House, where Malcolm Kerr lived when he was a young professor and returned to when he became president. In an oval garden between College Hall and the chapel, there is a banyan tree that Malcolm Kerr climbed as a boy and carved with his initials, now high out of sight. Under the tree is a Corinthian column that the family chose in the days after his death to mark the spot where his ashes were buried. \u201cIn memory of Malcolm H. Kerr, \u201d the engraving reads. \u201cHe lived life abundantly. \u201d Those were the words that Susan wrote on a piece of paper that marked the site until the stone was etched. The paper is still there, on a plaque that also features an excerpt from  \u2019s book. \u201cWe are proud that our dad and husband came to A. U. B. ,\u201d Susan wrote, in words that are now faded with time. Steve Kerr has never seen it. He has not been back since his father was killed. But, more and more, he hears the echoes.'"}, "time": 1742563592.9693456}
