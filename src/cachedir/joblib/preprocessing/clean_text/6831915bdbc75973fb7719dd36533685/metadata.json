I\u2019m still obsessed with a recent and revolting New York mystery: How did 50   crabs wind up on a subway car? It\u2019s so bizarre and deeply gross. I feel like I\u2019m in Act II of \u201cMacbeth,\u201d when everything goes haywire and the horses start eating one another. This weekend I\u2019ll continue indulging my current obsession with Australian TV. I finished \u201cWentworth\u201d and \u201cPlease Like Me,\u201d and now I\u2019m on Season 2 of the political satire \u201cDreamland. \u201d If I\u2019m not careful, \u201cClaire\u201d is going to become \u201c \u201d in my brain forever. Have a great weekend. Team Watching and I are, as ever, here for you: watching@nytimes. com. \u201cRun Mama Run\u201d (Watch on ESPN) Watch if you like sports stories and being impressed. Sarah Brown is a   runner trying to make the U. S. Olympic team just 16 weeks after giving birth. \u201cRun Mama Run,\u201d a   web series about her, is fascinating, and the final episode is still in production, since the Olympic track and field trials wrap up Sunday. Beyond the sheer athleticism depicted in \u201cRun,\u201d the series also nods at that unusual spot in culture that Brown occupies: Industry upon industry is built around telling women, especially mothers, what they\u2019re doing wrong. We also venerate athletes to the point that we don\u2019t see them as real people  \u2014   thus allowing us to obsess over their choices in ways that would be creepy and unacceptable for just a private citizen. And there\u2019s Brown, right in the center. \u201cThe Circus: Inside the Greatest Political Show on Earth,\u201d Sunday, Showtime, 8 p. m. (The first 13 episodes are also on Showtime Anytime.) Watch if you like political dogfights. At this point in the election cycle, some would rather set their hair on fire than continue engaging with the   aspects of the campaign. Others, though, are just getting fired up. If you are in the latter group, this is for you. The pundits Mark Halperin and John Heilemann (they wrote the book \u201cGame Change,\u201d among other things) focus on the mechanics, the strategy, the players  \u2014   and barely on the actual platforms, which makes the show feel juicy and   rather than like a lecture. The show has a quick turnaround, too, sometimes including footage filmed just days earlier, so it doesn\u2019t seem dated. \u201cThe Circus\u201d aired half its season earlier this year, but if you\u2019ve been following the news generally, you don\u2019t need to \u201ccatch up. \u201d \u201cThe Night Of,\u201d Sunday, 10 p. m. HBO (the first episode is now available on HBO Go) Watch if you like gripping  \u2014   but devastating  \u2014   crime stories. After a strange night of partying, a young   named Naz finds himself arrested on a charge of murder. The   limited series is based on the British show \u201cCriminal Justice,\u201d which is so intense and absorbing that I\u2019m not sure I ever fully recovered after watching it a few years ago. (It\u2019s not streaming anymore, alas.) Initially, this adaptation was supposed to star James Gandolfini as Naz\u2019s lawyer that role has been recast with John Turturro, though he doesn\u2019t show up much in the pilot. \u201cThe Night Of\u201d follows Naz through Rikers Island, then through his trial, which becomes a news media lightning rod. It\u2019s not that anything groundbreaking is happening here, but what is happening is done so well. (Read The New York Times review.) \u201cThe Last Alaskans\u201d (Watch on Hulu) Watch if you like thrilling landscapes. I\u2019ve mentioned this show here before, when Season 2 premiered this spring. But Season 1 is now streaming, and a show this beautiful and distinctive deserves another mention. \u201cAlaskans\u201d is a documentary series about the last families allowed to live in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and it is utterly unlike all those other   reality shows it\u2019s not particularly   and there are long stretches of silence and contemplation. The camerawork is astounding, capturing both the immediate concerns of the human subjects and the gaping indifference of the wilderness around them. If this sets you on an Alaska kick, try the web series \u201cIndie Alaska,\u201d too, which is charming and quirky and educational. Three cineastes  \u2014   the directors Robin Hardy, Michael Cimino and Abbas Kiarostami  \u2014   died within a few days of one another this weekend. I\u2019ve chosen a single movie for each that you can watch while you pour one out for these filmmakers.  \u2014   Monica Castillo  : Kiarostami, an Iranian filmmaker and one of the greats of world cinema, was known for his humanistic approach to characters and for blurring the space between real life and fiction. In his 1990 docudrama, \u201c\u201d Kiarostami does both. The film tells the story of a man on trial for trying to pass himself off as a famous director. To make it even more interesting, Kiarostami cast the actual family that was conned by the man on trial. This quiet, brisk film runs just a little over an hour and a half. (Rent on Amazon and iTunes stream on Hulu with your subscription) Heaven\u2019s Gate: \u201cThe Deer Hunter\u201d is the obvious Cimino movie. And for good reason. De Niro, Streep, Walken, Cazale! Unfortunately, that film is not streaming anywhere. So try this one instead. Cimino\u2019s much maligned third movie  \u2014   it is often referred to as the film that brought down the United Artists studio  \u2014   has enjoyed a renaissance since the release of a new restoration in 2012. The story follows a lawman struggling to bring his territory to order when wealthy cattle barons declare war on immigrant settlers. Carve out an afternoon (this is a long one) to take in this sweeping dark 1980 western starring Kris Kristofferson, Isabelle Huppert and Jeff Bridges. \u201cHeaven\u2019s Gate\u201d manages to capture both the grandeur and unblinking brutality of the West. (Rent on Amazon and iTunes) The Wicker Man: A religious police officer travels to a remote British island in search of a missing girl, but what he finds is a mysterious and alluring pagan community. This 1973 Hardy film is one of the greats of British horror. Be warned  \u2014   there are a surprising number of folk songs. (Rent on Amazon and iTunes) \u2022 This video of Stephen Colbert describing the night he met his wife is romantic, erudite and beautiful. (The Late Show) \u2022 Allison Janney talks \u201cMom,\u201d \u201cMasters of Sex\u201d and, thank God, a little \u201cWest Wing. \u201d (The New York Times Magazine) \u2022 This isn\u2019t really TV related, but holy smokes: \u201cMeet Walburga, the Married Woman Who Hid a Secret Lover in Her Attic for a Decade. \u201d Aaaaah! (KQED)'"}, "time": 1742562589.719903}
