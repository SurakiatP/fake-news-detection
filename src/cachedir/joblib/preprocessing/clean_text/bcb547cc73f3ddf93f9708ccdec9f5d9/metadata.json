Maloney, a congresswoman from the Upper East Side, was riding in a taxi on Friday when she heard the news: Emails discovered in an investigation into Anthony D. Weiner\u2019s sexting had revived the F. B. I. \u2019s interest in the case of Hillary Clinton\u2019s private server. \u201cI said: \u2018Oh, no, not this, not happening now,\u2019\u201d she said. And then Ms. Maloney\u2019s thoughts turned to Mr. Weiner. \u201cI can\u2019t stand him  \u2014   even before this,\u201d Ms. Maloney said. On the West Coast, John L. Burton, the chairman of the California Democratic Party, informed of Mr. Weiner\u2019s inadvertent intrusion into the election on Friday evening, let loose an emphatic expletive. \u201cWe\u2019re still talking about that guy during a presidential election?\u201d Mr. Burton fumed, using a profane   word instead of \u201cguy. \u201d Weiner  \u2014   the name became almost a curse word among senior Democrats over the past two days, as the disgraced congressman unexpectedly surfaced in the final stretch of the presidential contest. The news resurrected memories of previous Weiner scandals. \u201cHe is like a recurring nightmare,\u201d said the Rev. Al Sharpton. \u201cIt\u2019s like one of those \u2018Damien\u2019 movies  \u2014   it\u2019s like every time you think he\u2019s dead, he keeps coming again. \u201d The fury that many leading Democrats feel toward Mr. Weiner had been building for years. His sexting habits embarrassed them. His attempted political comeback in 2013 disgusted them. But their high regard for his   wife, Huma Abedin, always kept them from going public. On Friday that was over. Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers and an influential Clinton supporter, said she had long held her tongue out of \u201cenormous respect and love\u201d for Ms. Abedin. But Ms. Weingarten said Mr. Weiner\u2019s treatment of women demanded forceful censure. \u201cI don\u2019t care who it is, no one should be a sexual predator,\u201d Ms. Weingarten said. \u201cI think we all have to take a stand about that, and I think what\u2019s happening now is that people are. \u201d Mr. Weiner, who lost his seat in Congress and his mayoral hopes after repeated episodes in which he sent lewd messages to women, is now under federal investigation for allegedly sending sexual messages to a    girl in North Carolina. In that inquiry, the F. B. I. this month seized a laptop that contained thousands of messages belonging to Ms. Abedin, a top aide to Mrs. Clinton. The F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, told Congress on Friday that investigators will now review those messages for possible relevance to the Clinton inquiry, news that rattled the Clinton campaign and stung her supporters. For some, the development touched off more worry than anger: former President Bill Clinton, who learned of the news en route to his last event of the day, in Pennsylvania, fretted that it would draw hostile attention to Ms. Abedin, according to a person familiar with his thinking. Around the country, former aides to Mr. Weiner, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, traded emails and texts throughout the weekend, fuming at the \u201ccollateral damage\u201d inflicted by their onetime boss. Mr. Weiner did not respond to an email seeking comment. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign has largely ignored Mr. Weiner\u2019s connection so far, and has instructed campaign surrogates to avoid discussing his role. But amid fears that Mr. Weiner\u2019s behavior might undermine the party in a critical election, Democrats  \u2014   especially in his native New York  \u2014   said that perhaps they had given Mr. Weiner too many second chances over the years, and given him too much latitude out of deference to Ms. Abedin. Beyond New York, there was a sense of disbelief that one former lawmaker, whose memorable surname and lewd online habits made him a staple of   comedy, could disrupt the election of an American president. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in an interview with CNN, blurted out, \u201cOh, God,\u201d at the mention of Mr. Weiner\u2019s name. He added, \u201cI\u2019m not a big fan. \u201d But Mr. Weiner has been a figure of consternation in Democratic politics for years, in New York and nationally, regarded simultaneously as a sharp political mind and a man of striking immaturity and   ambition. With a gift for combat on cable television, Mr. Weiner repeatedly forced himself to the fore of Democratic politics, despite being seen by many in the party as too clever by half, too boastful about his intelligence  \u2014   and too hungry for attention from reporters and women. A 2001 story in Vanity Fair captured Mr. Weiner, then unmarried, leering at congressional interns while presenting himself as an   salesman. When Mr. Weiner explored a campaign for mayor in 2009, aides to Michael R. Bloomberg, who was seeking a third term, highlighted media coverage of his support for legislation making it easier for foreign models to get approval for visas. \u201cWe had a sense of who he was,\u201d said Bradley Tusk, who was campaign manager for Mr. Bloomberg. \u201cHe knew exactly who he was. \u201d Also before the same election, Senator Chuck Schumer, for whom Mr. Weiner once worked, privately expressed frustration that Mr. Weiner was insufficiently interested in substance, telling one aide: \u201cIt\u2019s all political ricochet. \u201d The senator is said to have made his peace with Mr. Weiner\u2019s problems long ago. But Mr. Schumer is in line to lead Senate Democrats next year, and any damage from Mr. Weiner\u2019s latest scandal could impede the party\u2019s quest for a majority. Still, he won the lasting appreciation of Mrs. Clinton during the 2008 election, defending her in   fashion during a difficult primary against Barack Obama. And Mr. Weiner\u2019s marriage to Ms. Abedin, in 2010, seemed to install him permanently among party elites  \u2014   whatever their reservations about his company. So tied into the party\u2019s power brokers was he, by marriage, that when Mr. Weiner sought to resurrect his political career with a bid for mayor in 2013, numerous Democratic donors cut checks to his campaign at Ms. Abedin\u2019s urging. John P. Coale, a wealthy lawyer supportive of Mrs. Clinton, said many donors gave money to Mr. Weiner out of friendship with Ms. Abedin. But Mr. Coale said the 2013 race, which brought new revelations of more sexting, had been exasperating. \u201cIt was just too much for everybody,\u201d Mr. Coale said. \u201cAnd now, it\u2019s out of the park. Come on. \u201d Bill Hyers, a Democratic strategist who managed Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s campaign that year, said the party establishment had erred by allowing Mr. Weiner \u201ca second breath of life. \u201d \u201cThey knew he was a narcissist who was massively flawed,\u201d Mr. Hyers said. \u201cAnd now we\u2019re all still stuck with him. \u201d Among Democrats who shunned Mr. Weiner from the start, there was little joy at the apparent vindication of their judgment. Sarah Kovner, a major Democratic donor, said there was less concern that   injuries might cost Mrs. Clinton the election, than sheer frustration that a known bad seed had created such endless tumult. \u201cWe basically never wanted to have anything to do with him,\u201d Ms. Kovner said of herself and her husband, Victor Kovner. \u201c  too wise for himself, too glib, too full of himself  \u2014   that\u2019s how we felt about him. \u201d While predicting Mr. Weiner\u2019s latest scandal would not doom Mrs. Clinton\u2019s presidential hopes, Ms. Kovner sighed: \u201cIt is more pain. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564570.4630167}
