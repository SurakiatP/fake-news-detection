[During a meeting of Native American tribal leaders, the Tohono O\u2019odham Nation\u2019s Vice Chairman Verlon Jose threatened protests similar to those known as \u2018Standing Rock,\u2019 where environmentalists protested the Dakota Access Pipeline, if Trump\u2019s wall is built, according to AZ Central:  Before the day was over and the guests left the remote desert mission on tribal lands, Jose would bash Trump\u2019s proposed wall, calling it a waste of taxpayer dollars and comparing it to the Berlin Wall. He would call on people to see the barrier as an international   issue, offer an alternative plan for tightening border security, and acknowledge that innocent tribal members are subjected to increased vehicle searches by Border Patrol agents. He also warned of a mass protest on the border if diplomacy fails to keep the U. S. government off Tohono O\u2019odham land, a protest that he said would rival Standing Rock. Jose is threatening the protests because his tribe sits on more than 2 million acres across a southern Arizona desert that crosses through Mexico, across the U. S.  Border. Besides gathering to threaten a protest against the construction of the border wall, the meeting of tribal leaders also included a chant demanding a \u201csanctuary for all. \u201d \u201cThey chanted a message printed on   for the trek: No Deportations, No Ban, No Wall, Sanctuary for All,\u201d the AZ Central noted. Despite   between the Trump Administration and Congress, DHS Secretary John Kelly said the construction of the border wall would \u201cmove forward,\u201d Breitbart Texas reported.
