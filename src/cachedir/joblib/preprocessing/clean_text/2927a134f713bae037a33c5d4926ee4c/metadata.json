The post is long, with multiple sections, so pace yourself accordingly. I suggest you bookmark this webpage so that you can return to read or re-read. \u2020 \\nJim Stone first posted about this two days ago on Nov. 1, 2016. \\nUnsure about Stone, who calls himself an \u201cindependent journalist\u201d (based in Japan) and who writes in a less-than-clear or reader-friendly manner, I refrained from writing about his post. \\nThen InfoWars picked this issue up a day later on November 2. \\nWhat is claimed is that a hidden web site of NBC affiliate WRCBtv in Chattanooga, Tenn., shows pre-determined final vote counts for an election that hasn\u2019t yet occurred \u2014 the 2016 presidential election scheduled for November 8. \\nBelow is a screenshot Jim Stone took of the election results on WRCBtv\u2019s hidden webpage, showing Hillary Clinton winning with 343 electoral votes and 42% of the popular vote . As Stone puts it: \u201cSCAM ELECTION ALREADY CONFIRMED. TRUMP LOSES.\u201d \\nStone and InfoWars say the predetermined election results are provided by Worldnow.com. \\nSo what is WorldNow? \\nThis is what Wikipedia says, with a lot of jargon: \\n\u201cWorldNow is a New York-based software company . . . [that] offers the only integrated media platform enabling broadcasters, operators and media companies to easily create, acquire, manage, analyze, monetize and distribute media assets (text, images and videos) across all digital platforms and on-air systems in a unified, end-to-end workflow . . . . Worldnow\u2019s customers include CBS, COX, Dispatch, Fox Television, Meredith Corporation, Media General and Raycom Media . . . . On July 29, 2015, WorldNow announced its sale to Frankly, a San Francisco-based provider of white label social media services and mobile messaging apps . . . . In 2012, Fox Television Stations migrated its websites to WorldNow\u2019s platform . . . becoming WorldNow\u2019s second largest client (as of 2015, they have since switched to Lakana). In 2011, Meredith Corporation . . . began a four-year contract with WorldNow to operate its station websites. In January 2013, Media General reached a deal to move its eighteen stations to WorldNow, beginning with WFLA-TV.\u201d \\nA \u201cmedia platform\u201d is a \u201cplatform,\u201d medium or means of communicating news, such as a newspaper, TV station, Facebook , Twitter , or even a blog like FOTM . \\nI typed \u201cworldnow.com\u201d in the URL bar of my laptop, but was brought to the webpage of Frankly Inc. with this URL: http://franklyinc.com/ . \\nFrankly\u2019s \u201cAbout\u201d page says: \\nWorldNow , the original broadcast arm of Frankly, was founded in 1999. We now serve over 200 stations across the United States as a true partner, offering customization services and strategic trainings on industry best practices for user engagement and monetization. \\nFrankly\u2019s \u201cInvestors\u201d page says: \\n\u201c Our customers include NBC, ABC, CBS and FOX affiliates , as well as top fashion brands, professional sports franchises and global organizations.\u201d \\nIn other words, WorldNow is a media software company that provides real-time data \u2013 such as election results \u2013 to local TV news stations like WRCBtv . \\nYou can verify this for yourself by going on WRCBtv\u2019s website: http://www.wrcbtv.com/ . Scroll down to the bottom of WRCBtv\u2019s webpage, and you\u2019ll see this in the bottom left of the webpage: \\nWRCBtv.com is \u201cpowered by frankly\u201d and Frankly is the owner of WorldNow. In other words, WorldNow provides the content or the news for WRCBtv.com. \\nStone claims that for now, WRCBtv.com\u2019s (predetermined) election results page is hidden, awaiting WorldNow to publicly post the (fake) election results sometime in the evening of November 8, Election Day. \\nI can verify that the webpage is currently hidden. Here\u2019s what I did: I typed \u201cftpcontent2.worldnow.com/wrcb/elections/elections.html\u201din the URL bar, but was brought to a McAfee Web Advisor page warning of \u201cTrouble ahead\u201d and asking me\u201dAre you sure you want to go there?\u201d I then did a Yahoo search for \u201cWRCBtv.com decision 2016\u201d. My search\u2019s results page has this at the top: \\nNote that it says \u201cDecision 2016: Complete Election Results Posted\u201d. I clicked the blue-colored \u201c DECISION 2016: Complete Election Results \u201d and was brought to this page of WRCBtv.com with the message: Our Apologies \\nThe page you requested is currently unavailable. Pages on this site are constantly being revised, updated, and occasionally removed. You may have followed an outdated link or have outdated pages in your browser cache. Here\u2019s a screenshot I took: \\nSo how did WorldNow come up with its predetermined final vote counts for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump ? \\nAnswer : A method called \u201c fractional vote \u201c. \\nTo begin, a fractional vote feature is embedded in the GEMS election management system of electronic voting machines , which counts approximately 25% of all votes in the United States. \\nAs explained by Gun&Game , the fractional vote feature can be used to invisibly, yet radically, alter election outcomes by pre-setting desired vote percentages for the candidates. The tampering can be applied across large jurisdictions in less than 60 seconds; is not visible to election observers, even if they are standing in the room and watching the computer; and is unlikely to be detected by auditing or canvass procedures. \\nGEMS vote-counting systems operate under five trade names: Global Election Systems, Diebold Election Systems, Premier Election Systems, Dominion Voting Systems, and Election Systems & Software, in addition to a number of private regional subcontractors. GEMS is used statewide in Alaska, Connecticut, Georgia, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Utah and Vermont, and for counties in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming. It is also used in Canada. \\nVote-rigging by electronic voting machines is real. \\nA 2006 Emmy-nominated HBO documentary, Hacking Democracy , investigates the flawed integrity of electronic voting machines, particularly those made by Diebold Election Systems (now Global Election Systems), and exposes previously unknown backdoors in the Diebold trade secret computer software. Hacking Democracy documents American citizens investigating anomalies and irregularities with electronic voting systems during the 2000 and 2004 elections, especially in Volusia County, Florida. The film culminates in the on-camera hacking of the Diebold election system in Leon County, Florida \u2014 the same computer voting system which has been used in elections across 39 states, and which still counts tens of millions of America\u2019s votes today. \\nSo what is fractional or fractionalized vote? \\nFractional vote is a method to distort the results of an election by \u201cweighting\u201d the votes. Instead of the principle of \u201cone person-one vote,\u201d some votes are counted not as 1, but as a fraction of or less than 1 (e.g., \u00bd or \u00bc), or as more than 1 (e.g., 1\u00bd or 1\u00be). The distortion of \u201cone person-one vote\u201d is in order to achieve a pre-assigned percentage of votes for each candidate. For example, Candidate A is pre-assigned 51% of the votes, Candidate B 44%, and Candidate C gets the rest \u2014 5%. \\nAn algorithm is used to arrive at the pre-assigned percentages by changing the numbers automatically as the voting progresses. Although Candidate A in actuality received fewer number of votes than Candidate B, by \u201cweighting\u201d Candidate A\u2019s votes, those votes are distorted in value, with one vote being counted, say, 25 times, so that Candidate A is the winner. And although Candidate B actually received more votes than Candidate A, Candidate B\u2019s votes are \u201cweighted\u201d such that their values are less, with some votes converted to zero. The end result is that Candidate B loses. \\nAccording to Jim Stone, below are the numerical votes and percentages that are the pre-assigned presidential election results for the various states , which are already on the \u201cElection Results\u201d webpage of WMCtv.com, a local TV station in Memphis, TN. (But if you go onto that webpage \u2014 http://ftpcontent4.worldnow.com/wmctv/elections/wmc-electionresults.html \u2014 now, all the values are 0): \\nLine 119: US President Alabama Line 121: Donald

station\u2019s actual posting of election results on November 8, Jim Stone says that he\u2019d \u201cripped the code out worldnow.com/kfvs12/elections.html\u201d and can confirm \u201cthere is no active in it to need testing,\" i.e., \"the page has no code that will tabulate votes.\" The data on the hidden page are not codes, but are \"all just typed in.\" \\nThere is another way to demonstrate vote rigging of the 2016 election -- a webpage on election results of KFVS12 , a local TV station in Cape Girardeau, MO: http://82.221.129.208/ftpcontent4worldnowcomkfvs12elections.html . \\nThe webpage at present is a fakery in progress , with the final (fake) vote counts for some races already filled in, but blank for some other races. This afternoon, November 3, 2016, I took screenshots of every race with (fake) tabulations already filled in, but did not take screenshots of some blank races because I got tired of taking screenshots. The races with no (fake) vote counts are all minor races, such as those for city councils and local initiatives. \\nAsk yourself this question: \\nWhy would the website of KFVS12, a local TV station in Missouri, have the final vote counts for some races in the upcoming November 8 elections already filled in? \\nIf KFVS12\\'s election results webpage as it is now is merely a \"test-run\" to ensure that the webpage will be operative on November 8, why are the vote counts of some races -- all relatively unimportant local races -- blank? If the page is a \"test,\" there should be \"test\" vote counts for every race. \\nCan anyone offer another explanation for what\\'s been presented in this post? I\\'m open to alternative, non-election-fraud explanations. \\nIs our entire democratic polity an illusion? \\nH/t FOTM \\'s bongiornoc'"}, "time": 1742563979.7400873}
