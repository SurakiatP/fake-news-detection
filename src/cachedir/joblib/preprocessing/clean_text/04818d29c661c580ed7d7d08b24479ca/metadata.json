Four is the maximum number of successive years a president can serve, according to academy bylaws. (A fifth term is possible, if unlikely. Ms. Isaacs, 66, would have to step aside for at least a year.) Ms. Isaacs, a former Paramount Pictures publicity executive, has worked in recent years with Dawn Hudson, the academy\u2019s chief executive, to maintain the organization\u2019s insular culture while also contending with intense pressure to make its membership less white and male. Last month, the academy invited 683 people to become members  \u2014   more than twice last year\u2019s number  \u2014   after pledging to double its female and minority membership by 2020, an almost impossible goal. The group\u2019s annual Academy Awards are granted by its roughly 7, 000 voting members. The next Oscar ceremony will be held on Feb. 26, with nominations scheduled to be announced on Jan. 24. The academy\u2019s acting branch put forward all white nominees in the last two Oscar cycles, resulting in blistering criticism. Ms. Isaacs and Ms. Hudson, whose working relationship has at times been fraught, will have to contend with more than diversity initiatives over the coming year. The academy\u2019s $388 million movie museum, for instance, is lurching toward a planned 2018 opening but still faces funding and operational obstacles. Ms. Isaacs was   by the   board as part of a slate that includes Jeffrey Kurland as first vice president John Bailey, Kathleen Kennedy and Nancy Utley as vice presidents Jim Gianopulos as treasurer and David Rubin as secretary.'"}, "time": 1742561964.828187}
