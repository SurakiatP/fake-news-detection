And while it\u2019s noble of you to plead with your sister not to \u201chang back with the brutes\u201d  \u2014   to choose the aesthetes over the animals  \u2014   you surely know it\u2019s a waste of breath. The New Orleans neighborhood where Blanche DuBois comes calling so disastrously in Tennessee Williams\u2019s \u201cA Streetcar Named Desire\u201d has never seemed quite as atavistic as it does in Benedict Andrews\u2019s compellingly harsh revival, which opened on Sunday night at St. Ann\u2019s Warehouse in Brooklyn. This production pits a fully adrenalized Gillian Anderson, as Blanche, against Ben Foster, as her adversarial    Stanley Kowalski, in a riveting study of the survival of the fittest. Even if you are unfamiliar with the plot, you shouldn\u2019t have trouble predicting its outcome. Mr. Foster\u2019s slyly commanding Stanley  \u2014   a performance that makes the specter of Marlon Brando, who created the part, temporarily retreat into the dusk  \u2014   is obviously the younger, stronger and more confident of the two. But Ms. Anderson\u2019s Blanche has her own arsenal of weapons, and though they may be outdated, she puts up a vigorous defense. This fading feline beauty is clearly fated to lose, but she\u2019s also going down fighting, tooth and manicured nail. This brave new \u201cStreetcar,\u201d which originated at the Young Vic in London, takes a lot of presumptuous risks, yet most of them pay off, at least for as long as you\u2019re watching it. Mr. Andrews, whose wild and divisive production of Jean Genet\u2019s \u201cThe Maids\u201d was in New York two summers ago, has dared to reset Williams\u2019s masterpiece in the 21st century. That means no picturesque French Quarter squalor. Magda Willi\u2019s   revolving set  \u2014   which gives us a drone\u2019   of every angle of the two rooms shared by Blanche\u2019s younger sister, Stella (a terrific Vanessa Kirby) and her husband, Stanley  \u2014   has the generic starkness of an   starter apartment for newlyweds. Blanche\u2019s tight, short, flashy wardrobe (Victoria Behr is the costume designer) wouldn\u2019t look out of place in a television pilot for \u201cReal Housewives of New Orleans. \u201d And   electronic music is blasted between scenes. Yet in bringing us into the present, Mr. Andrews is also leading us into a timelessly primeval world, observed with an anthropological clarity. The New Orleans glimpsed beyond the walls of the Kowalskis\u2019 home is inhabited by men and women who scrap, prowl, bloody one another\u2019s noses and mate like alley cats. There is little conjuring of the illusions that Blanche says she lives by, and she registers more as a   pragmatist in    mode than the usual windblown butterfly. Even when Jon Clark\u2019s lighting plunges us into darkness, the show always seems to be happening beneath the glare of the bright, naked bulbs that are anathema to our   heroine. Such an interpretation largely strips \u201cStreetcar\u201d of its poetry. And there were certainly moments when I missed that poetry. But I was also willing to trade the delicate lyricism of Mr. Williams and Blanche for genuinely original insights into a play I\u2019ve seen many times. In particular, you become conscious of a prescient feminist streak in \u201cStreetcar,\u201d a piercing awareness of a society that values its women according to youth and attractiveness. In this context, Blanche\u2019s obsession with looking pretty acquires a sad emotional weight that tips into existential panic. \u201cPeople don\u2019t see you  \u2014   men don\u2019t  \u2014   don\u2019t even admit your existence unless they\u2019re making love to you,\u201d she says to Stella. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve got to have your existence admitted by someone. \u201d That\u2019s a pretty realistic appraisal, coming as it does from a woman who has always relied on the kindness  \u2014   and interest  \u2014   of the male sex. And as Ms. Anderson says these lines, and others like them, a sense of Blanche as a desperately plotting strategist comes to the fore. Best known for her television appearances as the coolly intelligent detectives on \u201cThe Fall\u201d and \u201cThe \u201d Ms. Anderson endows Blanche with a   skepticism that is starting to lose its edge and a calculatedly feminine, shrilly Southern persona that feels thoroughly of the moment. This is the first Blanche I\u2019ve encountered who specifically evokes women of my generation, like those former popular girls you come across at high school reunions, teetering on stilettos between husbands and highballs. This Blanche is forever positioning herself as an object of masculine desire. (Watch her undulating   behind a semitransparent curtain while Stanley and his pals play poker.) Her sense of sex as a weapon, on the one hand, and a necessity, on the other, is beautifully conveyed in her defensive scenes with Mitch (the excellent Corey Johnson) her diffident suitor, and her aggressive encounter with the delivery boy (Otto Farrant) who summons the ghost of the young man to whom she was briefly and ruinously married. And though she may be forever trying to convince her sister to leave the barbaric Stanley, you also feel she\u2019s competing with Stella for his attention. In vain. As embodied by Ms. Kirby, the pregnant Stella glows with the confidence conferred both by new life and her sexually charged relationship with her husband. The physical interdependence between this pair has seldom felt so thick, and when Mr. Foster cries out the immortal mating call, \u201c  ! ,\u201d with a mix of childlike anguish and   longing, you know why Ms. Kirby comes running. Mr. Foster, seen on Broadway in \u201cOrphans\u201d in 2013, provides an effortlessly natural Stanley, unencumbered by the usual preening  . He also manages to evoke a type of man we\u2019ve seen a lot of in recent months  \u2014   the   guy who says he\u2019s voting for Donald Trump because he wants America to be strong and virile again. Contemporary parallels recede, though, as the struggle between Stanley and Blanche acquires momentum. Mr. Andrews has done a masterly job of arranging the play\u2019s central antagonists, so as the set revolves, we\u2019re always aware of their positions in relation to one another, as they take stock of their respective strengths and weaknesses. It\u2019s not easy to keep your balance on a moving stage, or in a changing world. Ms. Anderson\u2019s Blanche becomes increasingly unsteady on the perilously high heels she wears. Mostly, this unusually dynamic \u201cStreetcar\u201d plays more on our nervous system than with our hearts. But when Blanche finally goes down for the count, it\u2019s impossible not to feel a choking rush of compassion for a valiant, misguided fighter who never stood a chance.'"}, "time": 1742563467.2062073}
