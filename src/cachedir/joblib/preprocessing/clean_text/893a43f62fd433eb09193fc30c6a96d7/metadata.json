[The European Union already backs Libya\u2019s government with \u20ac200 million worth of support to tackle people smugglers  \u2014   who provide the unseaworthy craft which carry thousands of migrants north into the waiting arms of European coastguards and volunteer \u2018rescue\u2019 missions  \u2014   but now the country is requesting more.  Libya\u2019s fragile,   \u201cunity government\u201d has now asked for an additional \u20ac800 million worth of equipment for their patrol efforts including ships, helicopters,   vehicles, and radar. The Italian government is already providing Libya with ten patrol craft, to be delivered before the summer. The Libya Herald reports Libyan Prime Minister Fayez   flew to Rome with a \u201cshopping list\u201d of demands, including the call for more money and equipment, in the wake of some 20, 000 having made the crossing this year alone. An estimated 3, 000 migrants were rescued in the Mediterranean in just the past weekend. The new agreement struck Monday with Italy and other European nations agreeing to help Libya patrol her coast and keep the smuggler boats from setting off was short on actual detail or a plan to improve the situation, but instead showed a will, said the Italian interior minister. Democratic party minister Marco Minniti said of the meeting: \u201cNaturally we haven\u2019t resolved the problem because it\u2019s clear no one has the definitive solution to the problem in their pockets. \u201cBut we have common will. And this common will has a common objective: to not chase or suffer illegal migration but govern it. \u201d Austrian interior minister Wolfgang Sobotka praised the movement with Libya, telling press: \u201cWe have to do everything we can to stop the illegal migration across the Mediterranean\u201d reports Kronen Zeitung. The spending of British and European money in Libya has come under considerable criticism this year, as the poor conditions of migrant camps set up in the country courted criticism. Future spending may see camps established in other North African nations. While a not insignificant amount of money, the \u20ac800 million now discussed will be dwarfed by coming European contributions if a new \u201cAfrican Marshall Plan\u201c an aid package designed to boost African nations, is put into place. President of the European Parliament Antonio Tajani said if the bloc doesn\u2019t start pumping cash into the continent immediately, \u201c20 million Africans are going to come to Europe in the coming years\u201d.'"}, "time": 1742561768.5968645}
