What do you like? What do you want to see here? Email us with your feedback at asiabriefing@nytimes. com. Here\u2019s what you need to know: \u2022 Donald J. Trump\u2019s plans for a smooth transition to the presidency are in disarray after the abrupt departures of two top aides handling national security and foreign policy matters. Vice   Mike Pence, who was placed in charge of the transition after Gov. Chris Christie was removed, plans to join Mr. Trump in New York to speed the naming of a cabinet. Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, is a top contender for secretary of state. _____ \u2022 Mr. Trump\u2019s   holdings present an array of potential conflicts of interest, complicated further by his decision to have his children serve on his transition team and run his businesses. As president, he will be exempt from a federal ethics rule prohibiting government workers and members of Congress from actions that could benefit their financial interests. Some American families are facing uncomfortable holidays  \u2014   or deciding to skip gatherings  \u2014   because of relationships strained by the country\u2019s political divide. _____ \u2022 President Obama made some of his strongest comments since last week\u2019s election. In Greece on the first leg of his last official international trip, he warned of a rise in \u201ca crude sort of nationalism\u201d and of \u201ctribalism that is built on \u2018us\u2019 and a \u2018them\u2019 \u201d  \u2014   an apparent reference to Mr. Trump\u2019s appointment of Stephen K. Bannon, a   nationalist, as chief strategist. _____ \u2022 In South Korea, pressure is mounting on President Park   to step down as a campaign by Moon   her losing rival in the 2012 presidential election, builds. Ms. Park\u2019s new lawyer requested time to review the case, delaying official questioning in the   scandal. _____ \u2022 Two   politicians in Hong Kong plan to appeal a court ruling that bars them from taking office for using their oaths of office to insult China. The judge said he would have ruled against them even without Beijing\u2019s reinterpretation of the city\u2019s Basic Law, adding to concerns for other lawmakers who altered their oaths as a form of protest. _____ \u2022 A   security firm discovered preinstalled software in some Android phones that was sending text messages, contact lists and other data to a server in China every 72 hours. The scope of the issue is not clear. The software provider, Shanghai Adups Technology, said its code runs on 700 million phones, cars and other smart devices. \u2022 Google and Facebook are taking aim at purveyors of fake news after criticism that misinformation may have influenced the 2016 election. \u2022 Technologies that emerged from the effort to combat distracted driving have added to the problem, U. S. safety experts say, contributing  to a surge in highway deaths. \u2022 Fintech, the emerging industry that combines finance and technology, is looking for its Silicon Valley. Berlin, Singapore and Sydney, Australia, are in the race, but Hong Kong may have the inside track. \u2022 Indian banks in major cities are marking customers\u2019 fingers with  indelible ink to prevent   repeat visits to exchange devalued bank notes. Our reporter explains how Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s currency ban was meant to work. \u2022 Wall Street was mixed, and oil was higher. Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets. \u2022 Russia resumed airstrikes on   areas of Aleppo, Syria, ending three weeks of relative calm in the city. [The New York Times] \u2022 President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia fired his economy minister, citing a \u201clack of trust,\u201d after the official was accused of soliciting a $2 million bribe in a huge oil deal. [The New York Times] \u2022 Mongolia has appealed to the International Monetary Fund for help with a financial crisis that has driven its currency, the tugrik, to an   low. [Bloomberg] \u2022 China executed a farmer convicted of killing a village official, despite months of public outcry over the inciting incident, the loss of his home. [The New York Times] \u2022 Hizbul Mujahedeen, a militant group, has emerged as the face of the independence movement in Kashmir. Above, women mourned a teenager\u2019s death. [The New York Times] \u2022   a Japanese robot equipped with artificial intelligence, has flunked the University of Tokyo entrance exam for a fourth year, leading its makers to concede that the limits of its skills. [Asahi Shimbun] \u2022  Lake Baikal, one of the most pristine bodies of freshwater in the world, has been invaded by algae caused by an influx of untreated sewage. [The New York Times] \u2022 Tuesday was Election Day in Beijing, but despite urging voters to \u201ctreasure democratic rights,\u201d the government bullied and detained activists and candidates. [The New York Times] \u2022 Jackie Chan finally received an Oscar. The Hong Kong native, known for comedic timing and martial arts expertise, received an honorary award for his long career as an actor, director and producer. \u2022 Toshiro Mifune, the flinty Japanese movie star best known in the West for his roles in Akira Kurosawa films, was posthumously honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. \u2022 Xi Jinping wants China to bring back the revolutionary greeting of \u201ccomrade,\u201d but its meaning has changed a bit after it was adopted as a term of affection among the country\u2019s gay men and lesbians. The movie adaptation of the book \u201cHarry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone\u201d was released in the United States 15 years ago this week. If the title sounds odd to American readers, that\u2019s because in the U. S. the stone was a sorcerer\u2019s. Book and movie titles differ often in adaptation  \u2014   and not always because producers think sorcery is more enticing than philosophy. In some cases there\u2019s a practical reason. \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d was first published in book form as \u201cSchindler\u2019s Ark. \u201d Oskar Schindler actually did keep a list, and book publishers changed the title later. Other cases are simply random. While it would have been a stretch for the movie \u201cBlade Runner\u201d to carry \u201cDo Androids Dream of Electric Sheep,\u201d the film\u2019s title doesn\u2019t actually appear in Philip K. Dick\u2019s book. It was lifted from a different novel, Alan E. Nourse\u2019s \u201cThe Blade Runner. \u201d American movie titles are often altered when they are released overseas to resonate with local audiences. That\u2019s why \u201cUp in the Air\u201d became \u201cMileage, My Life\u201d in Japan and \u201cCloudy With a Chance of Meatballs\u201d turned into \u201cIt\u2019s Raining Falafel\u201d in Israel. A movie critic there summed up the criteria film studios used. \u201cThey are looking for something catchy or funny,\u201d he said, \u201ceven if it is ridiculous. \u201d Evan Gershkovich contributed reporting. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.
