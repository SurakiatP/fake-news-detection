Thanks to Wikileaks and the Intercept , in fact, we now have a list of no less than 65 mainstream \u201creporters\u201d whose campaign coverage constitutes propaganda for the Clinton campaign \u2014 and no wonder, considering the obscenely lopsided drivel presented by their outlets. As (actual) journalists Glenn Greenwald and Lee Fang reported on October 9, the Intercept exclusively received documents obtained by the source known as Guccifer 2.0 evidencing Clinton campaign tactics to court journalists portraying the former secretary of state in a positive light. \u201cAs these internal documents demonstrate,\u201d the Intercept reported , \u201ca central component of the Clinton campaign strategy is ensuring that journalists they believe are favorable to Clinton are tasked to report the stories the campaign wants circulated. \u201cAt times, Clinton\u2019s campaign staff not only internally drafted the stories they wanted published but even specified what should be quoted \u2018on background\u2019 and what should be described as \u2018on the record.\u2019\u201d One internal strategy document dated January 2015 \u2014 months before Clinton officially kicked off her campaign in April \u2014 with the curious heading \u201cEarned Media/Next Steps\u201d exposes how the campaign made an albeit infrequent practice of crafting supposed news pieces from beginning to completion. Under the \u2014 not-at-all oblique insult to the fundamentals of journalism \u2014 heading \u201c Placing a Story ,\u201d the memo\u2019s author wrote: \u201cAs we discussed on our call, we are all in agreement that the time is right [to] place a story with a friendly journalist in the coming days that positions us a little more transparently while achieving the above goals.\u201d Specifically named as a suggested journalist plant is Maggie Haberman of Politico , whom they note will assist in doing \u201cthe most shaping\u201d of the narrative they have in mind. Haberman, however, is far from the only pro-Clinton media shill. As the Intercept noted, a review of the metadata for one of the obtained documents found it had been penned by campaign communications director, Jennifer Palmieri \u2014 who created a list of ostensible pundits and journalists potentially amenable to targeting with the pro-Clinton message. The Intercept also revealed an R.S.V.P. list of 38 media friendlies invited to a pre-campaign announcement soiree with \u2018top campaign aides\u2019 at the home of strategist Joel Benenson last year on April 10, which was \u201ca fully off-the-record gathering designed to impart the campaign\u2019s messaging.\u201d Although the outlets they represented unsurprisingly included left-leaning MSNBC , Huffington Post , and Politico , the list also includes journalists from the Daily Beast , Vice , Vox , The New Yorker , and even People Magazine . In the Wikileaks document, the true scope of Clinton campaign skulduggery is revealed in another lengthy guest list for a parallel function hosted by Mr. Leaked Emails, himself, John Podesta, on April 9 last year. Press secretary Jesse Ferguson \u2014 who authored both lists \u2014 wrote to the top members of Clinton\u2019s team: \u201cHere is the current RSVP list to the Thursday Night (4/9) dinner at Podesta\u2019s. As a reminder, this is with the 25 reporters more closely following HRC (aka the future bus).\u201d Although the collusion between the media and both the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee has graciously trickled out thanks to leaked documents from Wikileaks and others, these lists of named journalists willing to cross the line between journalism and campaigning are shameful \u2014 if not helpful tools to know with certainty whose reporting is garbage. In fact, besides obliterating any previous claims of unbiased journalism made by the once-prestigious media institutions dotting these lists, the names and practices described prove mainstream media is effectively moot \u2014 by its own hand. source:'"}, "time": 1742563577.86049}
