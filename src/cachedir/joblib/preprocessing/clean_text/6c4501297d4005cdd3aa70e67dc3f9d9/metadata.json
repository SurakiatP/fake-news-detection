[During his Wednesday broadcast, Sharpe and   Skip Bayless discussed the dilemma some members of the Patriots have expressed over their visit to Donald Trump\u2019s White House. During the discussion Sharpe said that the entire team should unite with a boycott and send a message by breaking the Super Bowl championship tradition.  The hosts revealed that two members of the Patriots have already said they won\u2019t be going to Washington both Martellus Bennett and Devin McCourty have announced their intention to skip the team\u2019s White House visit. Sharpe said that McCourtney in particular had given \u201cvery sound, resonating \u201d reasons for his decision.  Sharpe excused his thought to turn the Super Bowl into a platform for Black Lives   politics, insisting that athletes don\u2019t want to \u201cstick to sports\u201d any more. \u201cAthletes in today\u2019s time, we\u2019re starting to see athletes saying \u2018I do not only want athletic greatness, I want moral greatness as well.\u2019 See, he\u2019s thinking with his conscience and his heart,\u201d Sharpe said. \u201cA lot of the things going on, a lot of the policies being implemented doesn\u2019t necessarily affect him directly,\u201d Sharpe continued. \u201cHe\u2019s financially secure, the NFL pays for his insurance. So currently, he\u2019s really not affected by this  \u2014   but these athletes of today\u2019s time say \u2018there\u2019s something greater,\u2019 there\u2019s no more \u2018just stick to sports.\u2019 You hear that a lot, Skip. \u2018Just stick to sports. \u2019\u201d Sharpe claimed that many athletes are simply acting like \u201cprudent human beings\u201d and have decided what is going on in American society today is \u201cnot acceptable. \u201d And I cannot in good conscience, although we won this as a team  \u2014   and I would love to share in this moment as a team  \u2014   I cannot in good conscience go. Because what I think this president is standing for, what he\u2019s saying, the policies he\u2019s implementing are harming the minority communities. I am a minority. Whether it be black, the Latino community, the immigration ban, LGBT  \u2014   whatever it may be, you\u2019re starting to see athletes take a much more of a stance. Because in the past, if you had a brand, you were making money, you do not do anything to upset the   or the people that\u2019s buying that product. You keep your mouth shut. Ultimately, Sharpe decided that being on the \u201cwrong side of history\u201d needs to be avoided. Now, with this president, President Trump, in office, he\u2019s going to ask you to ask an honest question of yourself. \u2018What side of history do you want to be on?\u2019 Are you going to be on the side of history that\u2019s a bridge and that\u2019s trying to bring people together, or are you a part of the wall, that\u2019s trying to tear people apart? That\u2019s the question that athletes are asking themselves, and you\u2019re starting to see more and more saying \u2018you know what? I want to be on the side of history that\u2019s positive, that\u2019s bringing people together. \u201d Sharpe said that the members of the Patriots refusing to go to the White House \u201care to be commended. \u201d Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com.'"}, "time": 1742562407.3381405}
