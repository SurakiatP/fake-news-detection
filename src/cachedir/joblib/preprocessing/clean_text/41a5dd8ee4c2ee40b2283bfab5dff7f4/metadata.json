Trump killed the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) once and for all on Monday, signing an executive order officially withdrawing from the trade deal negotiations. [It came as a part of series of three separate executive actions that President Trump took on Monday.  \u201cThe first is a withdrawal of the United States from the Trans Pacific Partnership,\u201d White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said, explaining the first executive action President Trump was taking in the list of three. The other two were one freezing hiring of all federal employees except in the military, and one that restores the Mexico City policy. As President Trump signed the executive action killing the TPP, he announced for the cameras in the oval office that it was a \u201cgreat thing for the American worker, what we just did. \u201d Trump campaigned heavily against TPP, so it\u2019s only fitting he\u2019d crush it once and for all on his first business day as President of the United States. It\u2019s his efforts campaigning against it \u2014  and the efforts of failed presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) \u2014  that shook Washington\u2019s political establishment, and eventually forced failed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton to come out against the deal that was supposed to be a legacy achievement of now former President Barack Obama. Trump hammered TPP repeatedly throughout his campaign and even leading up to it in speeches and interviews, including many exclusive interviews with Breitbart News. For instance, back in May 2015 \u2014  when many Republicans were in favor of TPP and before he announced his campaign \u2014  Trump told Breitbart News exclusively in an interview that the TPP was a \u201cdisaster\u201d of a deal. \u201cI deal with foreign companies all the time. I do a lot of business with foreign companies and do well with foreign companies,\u201d Trump said in that May 2015 interview. \u201cThe trade deal is a disaster for many reasons. Number one, we don\u2019t have any good negotiators in our government. That\u2019s possibly the single greatest reason \u2014  we don\u2019t have our best and our brightest negotiating for us. That\u2019s a real problem. Number two, and very, very importantly, it doesn\u2019t take into consideration the currency manipulation because we get beaten in trade more by currency manipulation than any single other factor. So it\u2019s not even discussed in the trade deal. They\u2019re not addressing the number one cause of the unfairness which is the currency manipulation. China manipulates their currency so brilliantly and it\u2019s very, very hard to compete. The other thing they do and they do it despite agreements is they make it impossible to sell product in their countries even after they sign an agreement so we need much stronger penalties if they continue to do that. \u201d Later, as a candidate in November 2015, now President Trump then candidate Trump called the deal \u201cinsanity\u201d in another exclusive Breitbart News interview. \u201cThe deal is insanity,\u201d he said in November 2015. \u201cThat deal should not be supported and it should not be allowed to happen. \u201d \u201cThe deal is so bad because of the fact they don\u2019t cover currency manipulation,\u201d Trump added in that interview. \u201cIt\u2019s the   weapon used by foreign countries to hurt the United States and take away jobs. \u201d He repeatedly hammered it over and over again, and continued throughout the entire campaign. Just a couple weeks before the general election, Trump appeared on Breitbart News Daily and hammered TPP and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) \u2014  which he plans to renegotiate now with planned meetings with Canada and Mexico. \u201cI have traveled around this country, and I have seen places that were vibrant 25 years ago,\u201d Trump said in that October 2016 interview. \u201cI\u2019ve seen NAFTA. What NAFTA has done to our country is incredible. Probably 40 percent of our manufacturing jobs have been shipped to other places, and it\u2019s only getting worse. And now they want to do TPP, which will be not as bad as NAFTA, but it\u2019ll be very bad. It\u2019ll be a continuation of the same. \u201d The move to nuke TPP once and for all, ripping it up, begins to fulfill one of Trump\u2019s biggest promises. Now that he\u2019s crushed the bad deal, it remains to be seen how he will negotiate positive deals for America. Back when Trump became presumptive GOP presidential nominee, he told Breitbart News in his 26th floor Trump Tower office in New York City he wants to negotiate good deals for American workers. \u201cOne of the big drastic policies is on trade,\u201d Trump said in the May 2016 interview. \u201cAnd what I want in trade is great deals. I\u2019m fine with free trade, but all of our trade deals are doing horribly. It\u2019s free trade for the other side, not for us. So I like free trade but all of our trade deals are doing terribly. What I want is great deals. You know what my trade policy is? I want to make great deals for the American people. It\u2019s a very simple policy. You can call it anything you want \u2014  you can call it free trade, you can come up with three different names \u2014  but it\u2019s a very simple policy: Make great deals for the American people.'"}, "time": 1742563697.9142306}
