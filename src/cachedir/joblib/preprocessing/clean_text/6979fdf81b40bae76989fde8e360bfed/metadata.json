But less than two hours later it\u2019s clear that what actually happened has been blown way out of proportion and out of context. \\nFBI Director James Comey announced to Congress today that \u201cinvestigators are examining newly discovered emails that \u2018appear to be pertinent\u2019 to the email probe. Although the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant, and I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work, I believe it is important to update you.\u201d Clarifying: Comey doesn\u2019t say the FBI is reopening the Clinton investigation per se, rather that it\u2019s assessing newly found emails. \\n\u2014 Shane Harris (@shaneharris) October 28, 2016 \\nThe investigation is not \u201creopened\u201d\u2013 technically, it was never closed. \\nThe new emails were not \u201chidden\u201d or \u201crecovered\u201d or related to her email server in any way. \\nThe emails were discovered on the cellular device of former Congressman Anthony Wiener as part of an unrelated probe into whether or not Wiener was sending sexually explicit messages and photographs to minors. What the new emails contain is anyone\u2019s guess, but they are not to or from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Wiener\u2019s soon-to-be ex-wife Huma Abedin is a longtime aide to Clinton. \\nThe media has been just as complicit as the Republican witch-hunters in Congress in perpetuating these baseless smears against the credibility of Hillary Clinton, one of our nation\u2019s most dedicated public servants. \\nWhile Republicans are leaping on this news in hopes it will revive Republican nominee Donald Trump\u2019s flailing campaign, these \u201cdevelopments\u201d are nothing but a non-story from an overly impressionable media desperate for views on a slow Friday afternoon and deserves no more of your time.'"}, "time": 1742628453.1704054}
