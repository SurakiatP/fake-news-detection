The justice, Marco Aur\u00e9lio Mello, based his ruling on the fact that the Senate leader, Renan Calheiros, is going to stand trial in a graft case in which a lobbyist paid for the child support of a daughter Mr. Calheiros, 61, fathered in an extramarital affair. Mr. Mello\u2019s ruling reflects how Brazil\u2019s political tumult is intensifying once again, in a year in which President Dilma Rousseff was ousted and an orchestrator of her impeachment, Eduardo Cunha, the former speaker of the lower house, is now in jail on graft charges. The move by Mr. Mello also comes amid a tense standoff between Congress and the judiciary. Last week, the lower house held a marathon session in which its members gutted a   anticorruption bill. The legislation, which would erode the authority of prosecutors and judges guiding graft inquiries, then moved to the Senate, where Mr. Calheiros unsuccessfully tried to hold a vote on it. Thousands of Brazilians took to the streets on Sunday to protest the moves in Congress, venting their wrath especially against Mr. Calheiros. Even as he faces a loss of authority, Mr. Calheiros, from Alagoas State in Brazil\u2019s northeast, is expected to keep his seat in the Senate. For many of the protesters on the streets of Brazilian cities, Mr. Calheiros came to symbolize impunity in the nation\u2019s political system, resurrecting his career despite facing an array of scandals. (In 2007, he was forced to resign as head of the Senate over the same child support case.) It was not immediately clear if the Supreme Court would need to ratify or reject Mr. Mello\u2019s ruling with a full vote of its members. The request for Mr. Calheiros\u2019s ouster came from Sustainability Network, a political party in the opposition. Mr. Calheiros may be able to appeal the decision. \u201cI applaud this ruling,\u201d said Randolfe Rodrigues, a senator from Sustainability Network, which largely blends centrist and leftist ideas. He said that the decision built on previous votes by justices aiming at preventing politicians on trial in corruption cases from remaining in the presidential line of succession. Jorge Viana, a senator from Ms. Rousseff\u2019s leftist Workers\u2019 Party, is expected to ascend to the post as head of the Senate. Mr. Calheiros is a member of the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, the same   centrist grouping led by President Michel Temer. Senators from the Workers\u2019 Party said on Monday night that they would seek to delay voting in the Senate on a bill that would place a cap on federal spending, a cornerstone of Mr. Temer\u2019s proposed austerity measures. The Senate already approved the bill in a first round of voting in November, with a second and final round scheduled for  . With some in Congress now also calling for Mr. Temer\u2019s impeachment after a scandal involving his support for an ally in a property deal, Brazil\u2019s political establishment is facing the prospect of renewed instability. But at least for now, few observers see Mr. Temer at imminent risk of falling, given his coalition\u2019s control of Congress.'"}, "time": 1742562407.8473983}
