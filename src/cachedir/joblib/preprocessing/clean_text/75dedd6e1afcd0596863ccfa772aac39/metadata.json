We are Confident but whatever the outcome tonight, Our people are awakened! \\nToday Dr. Duke expressed his confidence that he and Donald Trump were headed to electoral success, but that no matter what the outcome the people have been awakened and that we are now in a position to take back our society. Dr. Slattery then pointed out the monumental effort made by Dr. Duke and the enormous sacrifices he has made and the real physical risks he has endured in order to give us a voice, and offered his heartfelt thanks. \\nThey then when on to discuss the possibilities that could emerge from today\u2019s vote. While Hillary has been rattling the sabres for a war with Russia, the mass awakening that is occurring would hopefully lead those needed in the military to make a war happen to reject orders which could destroy civilization. \\nThis is a historic show for a historic day. Now go out there and vote for Trump and Duke! \\nOur show is aired live at 11 am replayed at ET 4pm Eastern and 4am Eastern. \\nClick on Image to Donate! \\nAnd please spread this message to others.'"}, "time": 1742562290.4492593}
