He poured more than $75 million into building the school, the Oxbridge Academy of the Palm Beaches. But on Friday, he fired the head of school and declined to renew the contracts of the athletic director and the football coach. The moves came after a sexual harassment complaint and an internal investigation into accusations of kickbacks,   excessive spending and violations of the rules governing high school sports. It turned out, William I. Koch said in an interview, that a \u201cpower elites group\u201d in the school ran \u201cthe asylum. \u201d Mr. Koch, 76, is the chief executive of Oxbow Carbon L. L. C. an energy development holding company based in West Palm Beach, and is the younger brother of Charles G. and David H. Koch, who are known for supporting conservative Republican causes. Referred to by some journalists as \u201cthe other Koch brother,\u201d he established Oxbridge Academy to much fanfare in 2011. The school, which has 580 students, has many perks, including a physical therapist on staff,   lunches, an equestrian club and a flight simulator. The debate team spent hundreds of thousands of dollars traveling to competitions nationwide, Mr. Koch said. \u201cWe are finding alarming things of how money was misspent,\u201d Mr. Koch said at his company\u2019s offices. \u201cIf people think they\u2019ve got a honey pot, there\u2019s going to be a lot of bears around it, trying to get it. \u201d A few years ago, students requested that the school establish a football team, an idea the administration embraced. But that was when the troubles took off. An athlete who read at a   level was given a full scholarship, the football team had its own locker room and the coach earned more than $200, 000 a year, according to tax records and interviews with former employees. The former head of school, Robert C. Parsons, whose official title was president and chief executive, is a former chief financial officer at the United States Naval Academy. Mr. Parsons started at Oxbridge in 2011 with a compensation package worth $1 million, tax records show, seven times his academy salary. Eventually, he made about $600, 000 a year at the school. But in interviews, former employees questioned Mr. Koch\u2019s decision to hire Mr. Parsons in the first place, because he was suspended for five days after a 2009 Naval inspector general report accused him and his former boss of operating a \u201cslush fund\u201d to pay for tailgate parties. Mr. Koch said he did not think Mr. Parsons\u2019 record at the Naval Academy was a red flag because the government is \u201call screwed up. \u201d Other billionaires  \u2014   such as Bill Gates of Microsoft Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook the music mogul Sean Combs the filmmaker James Cameron the philanthropist Eli Broad and Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla  \u2014   have poured parts of their fortunes into education. Some, like Mr. Zuckerberg and Mr. Broad, said they wanted to help solve problems in public education. Their experiences underscore the pitfalls that confront business leaders whose professional success does not always translate into the education field. Mr. Koch has discovered similar challenges, though he had a personal motivation for starting Oxbridge. He said he founded the school to give his own children a better academic experience than he had. By his account, he went from being an awkward ugly duckling who was flunking out of middle school in Kansas, to a military academy cadet who embraced a love of study. He longed for a place where students, not teachers\u2019 unions or principals, ruled. He completed a Ph. D. at M. I. T. but acknowledges that he still cannot spell very well. And he chokes up just talking about the troubled students who have made a turnaround at Oxbridge, which his children attend and from which his son has just graduated. In the past, Mr. Koch has famously sued his siblings in disputes over the family business, usually losing. Several years ago, he spent more than $25 million investigating counterfeit wine after being duped by a wine salesman. In 2012, a former company executive who had faced a fraud investigation accused Mr. Koch and his staff members of kidnapping him. In court papers, Mr. Koch\u2019s lawyers said the former employee had made the claim in a lawsuit because he was angry and embarrassed that his fraud had been exposed. A judge later dismissed the case. \u201cMy biggest failing is I\u2019m too trusting of people,\u201d Mr. Koch said. Oxbridge was created in less than a year on a   campus that once held a Jewish community center. \u201cI don\u2019t know if people appreciate how much happened here in five years,\u201d said Bob Kaufmann, the chairman of the school\u2019s executive committee, who has been given the task of reducing spending. \u201cThis is a happy place for children. \u201d Oxbridge graduates have been accepted this fall to nearly all of the Ivy League universities. One senior won a $100, 000 Siemens scholarship for inventing a   method. \u201cThe intention was really good,\u201d Mark Bodnar, the school\u2019s former vice president for technology and security, said about Oxbridge. \u201cIt sort of went off the rails a couple of years in. \u201d Mr. Bodnar, who had been on the admissions committee, said the committee\u2019s recommendations were often overruled by the football coaches. He said that there were so many academically struggling athletes that tutors were overwhelmed, and that the players had to be put in classes separate from the rest of the student body. John Klemme, the academic dean who will take over as head of school, said that some of the struggling students \u201cwould have been written off\u201d at other schools, but had found their way to a superior education because of their football prowess. \u201cThis is not to be a rich kids\u2019 school,\u201d Mr. Klemme said. Mr. Koch said that about 40 percent of students  \u2014   including those who do not play football  \u2014   received some kind of scholarship. Phillip Taylor, 17, a junior, said he loved the school and the opportunities he had been given, such as spring break study at Cambridge University in Britain. Still, he said he resented the double standard on admissions afforded to football players. \u201cMy experience was positive,\u201d he said. \u201cI learned so much. But it does bother me. \u201d His mother, Cheryl Taylor, also had a daughter in the school\u2019s freshman class in the school\u2019s inaugural year. She said parents like her who are impressed by the education the school offered were startled by its cultural shift. \u201cAt first, you had to be academically qualified, but that changed dramatically about two years in,\u201d Ms. Taylor said. \u201cFootball began to outshine everything else. \u201d The football team, the Thunderwolves, made it to the regional finals this past season. The problems at Oxbridge, where tuition is $31, 500 a year, went beyond sports. In interviews, several former employees said Mr. Parsons had created a \u201ctoxic\u201d work environment. Employee turnover was high and tens of thousands of dollars were spent on severance packages, tax records show. \u201cIf he likes somebody and she\u2019s a pretty girl, they got a signing bonus or a higher salary or a bonus,\u201d Ulle Sinisalu Boshko, the school\u2019s former controller, said of Mr. Parsons. Ms. Boshko, who said she was given a large pay increase to leave one of Mr. Koch\u2019s companies to join Oxbridge, said she had been demoted after fending off Mr. Parsons\u2019 advances for months. She filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which is pending, and then she went public. Her accusations led to an investigation of the entire school by The Palm Beach Post. Reached by a New York Times reporter on the phone for comment last week, Mr. Parsons hung up. Reached on Sunday, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not interested,\u201d and hung up again. After inquiries from The Post, Mr. Koch hired a team of accountants, lawyers and a retired F. B. I. agent to look into the conduct of school officials, including whether employees were rigging bids with vendors and whether they had broken rules by housing students in their homes. Mr. Koch said he had not been able to verify any \u201csuper sexual harassment\u201d beyond what he called \u201c \u201d comments like \u201cGod, that girl\u2019s hot\u201d or \u201cShe\u2019s got a great behind. \u201d But the investigation, he said, turned up information that led to the firing of Mr. Parsons and the forcing out of the athletic director and the coach. Mr. Koch said the investigators did not find any evidence of kickbacks to employees from vendors. He said that if any evidence of   emerged, the employees responsible would be fired. He said budget watchdogs would be hired to cut costs and pay closer attention to spending. \u201cThe attitude that was there at the school was that they had a rich guy backing it and they could do whatever they wanted,\u201d he said. He also wants to figure out how to get others to donate to the school, he said. That was one reason he did not name the school after himself.'"}, "time": 1742562270.1230657}
