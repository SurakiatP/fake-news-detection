So when the planners of this year\u2019s presidential inauguration reached out to the   singer this week to ask if she would sing during a welcome concert the day before Donald J. Trump is to be sworn in as president, she said yes. \u201cI\u2019m singing on the mall for the people,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a dog in this fight  \u2014   I\u2019m just a singer, and it\u2019s a welcome concert for the people on the mall. \u201d Ms. Holliday, speaking during a telephone interview Friday afternoon, said she had not supported Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy  \u2014   \u201cI voted for Mrs. Clinton, and they knew that. \u201d But, she said, \u201cif someone wants me to sing a national anthem or something, we think about America, and we go. \u201d Ms. Holliday sounded certain about her choice, but her spokesman, William Carpenter, suggested in a subsequent email that the decision was not set in stone. \u201cI just spoke to her and she still hadn\u2019t made up her mind about doing the event,\u201d he wrote. Ms. Holliday is a Broadway icon, renowned for her performance as Effie in the original cast of \u201cDreamgirls,\u201d and she returned to Broadway this season as a replacement Shug Avery in the revival of \u201cThe Color Purple. \u201d The final performance of that show was Sunday, and the Clintons were in the audience. Ms. Holliday said she was asked on Wednesday if she would sing at the concert scheduled for Jan. 19, and she agreed, seeing the request as similar to those she received to sing at the White House during past Republican and Democratic presidencies. \u201cI just thought of the history part of it, and about singing on the mall where Marian Anderson paved the way for me to sing as a black American,\u201d she said, referring to a 1939 concert that Ms. Anderson, a popular singer, performed from the Lincoln Memorial after being denied permission to sing at Constitution Hall because she was black. Ms. Holliday said she had been startled and disheartened on Friday by the venom that greeted the news of her participation. \u201cIt brought a lot of threats from people already saying I\u2019ll never work again,\u201d she said. \u201cIf that\u2019s what America has come to, where we all hate and bully people, there\u2019s no more freedom of speech. \u201d She added, \u201cI know everybody hates me now, but that shows we are all just hateful people now  \u2014   we don\u2019t even want to work together. \u201d And, she said, \u201cIf it\u2019s the end of everything for me, then it has to be the end of everything for me. I would hope that\u2019s not how it ends up, but right now I would like to be a part of a welcoming part of America. If we\u2019re only going to let Trump be the face of America, I say let\u2019s not let him be the only face of America  \u2014   someone else could stand and show a light of love or hope or forgiveness. \u201d She noted that the Carters and the Clintons, as well as the Obamas, are expected at the inauguration. \u201cWe\u2019ve become such a polarized country  \u2014   we\u2019re not listening to what the Obamas have said,\u201d she said. \u201cThey told us to move forward with hope  \u2014   they didn\u2019t tell us to stop participating  \u2014   I didn\u2019t hear that in Obama\u2019s speech. \u201d Ms. Holliday said she did not see herself, or her singing, as political, a sentiment echoed by Jackie Evancho, the      singer who will perform the national anthem at Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration on Jan. 20. \u201cI just kind of thought that this is for my country,\u201d Ms. Evancho said. \u201cSo if people are going to hate on me it\u2019s for the wrong reason. \u201d Ms. Holliday said her goal is to support America: \u201cAre we saying that if there is anything that could be done for America in four or eight years or however long Trump is there, we\u2019re not supposed to participate or help anybody?\u201d she asked. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we all be praying for the success of America? I would like to sing some hope and have my voice not be associated with some kind of label, but I guess that\u2019s where we are now. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628527.7198803}
