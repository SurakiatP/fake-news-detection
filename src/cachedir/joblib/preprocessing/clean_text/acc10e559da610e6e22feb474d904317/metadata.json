The moment  she registered her win is now a reaction for the history books. Manuel, a    swimmer from Sugar Land, Tex. became the first   woman to win an individual event in Olympic swimming. She also set an Olympic record, along with Penny Oleksiak of Canada: They tied for the win, clocking in at 52. 70 seconds. (Manuel also helped the American women\u2019s team win silver in the   freestyle relay.) The swimming world has known about Manuel, a   N. C. A. A. swimming champion, for years, but her status as a newly minted gold medalist rocketed her to wider popularity overnight. Here\u2019s a closer look at a swimmer who just made history. Manuel\u2019s supporters have high hopes that she could affect diversity in the sport, encouraging more minorities to join. She addressed the issue after her win on Thursday: \u201cI definitely think it raises some awareness and will get them inspired,\u201d Manuel told reporters. \u201cI mean, the gold medal wasn\u2019t just for me it was for people that came before me and inspired me to stay in the sport. \u201cFor people who believe that they can\u2019t do it, I hope I\u2019m an inspiration to others to get out there and try swimming. You might be pretty good at it. \u201d Miriam Lynch of Diversity in Aquatics, a nonprofit organization focused on curbing high numbers of drowning deaths among   said Manuel\u2019s victory could help reverse what she called a cultural fear of swimming in that group. The phenomenon has been traced to slavery and to Jim Crow laws, which segregated swimming pools. The hope is to encourage more young people to become lifeguards, coaches and swimmers. \u201cWhen you see that the lifeguard is from the community, you think, \u2018I can be a lifeguard I can be a coach,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Lynch said. \u201cNow, with Simone, it\u2019s, \u2018I can be an Olympian.\u2019 \u201d Chuck Wielgus, the executive director of USA Swimming, said in an interview on Friday that Manuel\u2019s achievements, compounded by the success of black gold medalists like Cullen Jones, who came before her, might spur a bump in minority memberships. Michael Phelps did something similar when he first started swimming: When Phelps made the Olympic team in 2000, membership in USA Swimming was about 37 percent male today, male membership of the   organization is around 44 percent. \u201cI think we\u2019ll see it now with Cullen and Simone,\u201d Mr. Wielgus said. \u201cThe benefits of it will be seen 10 years from now. \u201d   membership grew by 55 percent from 2004 to 2015, he said. But that still amounts to only about 1 percent of USA Swimming. Manuel comes from a family of athletes  \u2014   her two older brothers and her father played college basketball  \u2014   but after her victory, she spoke to reporters about the pressure of being a black athlete in a sport that has historically lacked diversity. \u201cIt is something I\u2019ve definitely struggled with a lot,\u201d Manuel said. \u201cComing into the race, I tried to take weight of the black community off my shoulders. It\u2019s something I carry with me. I want to be an inspiration, but I would like there to be a day when it is not \u2018Simone the black swimmer.\u2019 \u201d The network drew sharp criticism on social media from fans who said it should have prioritized Manuel\u2019s medal ceremony as it happened instead of broadcasting the women\u2019s gymnastics event. The sports site Deadspin linked to a BBC video, which has since been taken down, so that people could watch Manuel\u2019s historic moment. A few people caught the footage and posted it to Twitter. Before Manuel won a gold medal, Lia Neal, who is of Chinese and African descent, made headlines in 2012 for winning a bronze medal in the   freestyle relay at the London Games. They follow in the wake of Maritza Correia, a Puerto   swimmer of Guyanese descent who was the first black woman to join the United States Olympic team, and was on the   freestyle relay group that won silver in Athens in 2004. Both freestyle sprinters, Manuel and Neal are friends and rivals, and they\u2019re teammates at Stanford University. Greg Meehan, the university\u2019s lead swimming coach, told ESPN last year that Manuel\u2019s arrival to the team took some pressure off Neal, who is a year older. \u201cShe has a huge spotlight on her, and she\u2019s managed it well,\u201d Meehan said of Manuel. \u201cAnd it\u2019s given Lia some freedom to do what she needs to do. \u201d In the fall, Stanford will add even more Olympic firepower when Katie Ledecky, the team\u2019s most dominant female swimmer, comes aboard. The tennis powerhouse Serena Williams, who has four gold medals of her own, shared a photo on Instagram that praised Manuel and another famous Simone  \u2014   that would be Simone Biles, who is widely regarded as the best gymnast in the world. Biles is a friend of Manuel\u2019s and, of course, a fellow Texan.'"}, "time": 1742562251.5878875}
