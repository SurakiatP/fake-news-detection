The judge blocked Trump\u2019s order on the grounds that it constituted unfair discrimination against Muslims. [\u201cIt\u2019s very simple,\u201d Gorka told SiriusXM host Alex Marlow. \u201cThere is absolutely no way on God\u2019s earth that they can make that case, that this is something to do with xenophobia or a religious group. \u201d  \u201cThere is not one instance on the campaign trail or after the president took office in which the travel suspension was mentioned without reference to national security,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cIt was never mentioned that we\u2019re doing this because of a certain religious group. In every single instance, every campaign speech, every statement out of the White House after January 20, this measure was linked to the security of the United States. National security is the prerogative of the    and immigration  \u2014   including immigration standards and the issuance of visas  \u2014   is not a local, is not a federal, is not a judicial function. It is a function of the White House and the executive arm. \u201d \u201cThis attempt to block a national security executive order will fail,\u201d he declared. Gorka said this interference with the president\u2019s order illustrates \u201cthe depth of the problem\u201d with judicial activism. \u201cIf we truly believe in a republic, if we believe in checks and balances, and if we believe in separations of power, then the executive cannot bring constitutional decisions. That\u2019s the job of the Supreme Court. Judges cannot behave as if they are the executive and determine what is good for the national security of the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they proceed to do so, they have stepped out of their mandate. They have stepped out of the way we constructed this country originally. \u201d \u201cThis is a perfect case study of just how much politics has intruded into the judicial sphere,\u201d Gorka said. \u201cAs such, we have to welcome it because this is when the scales fall from the eyes of many, many Americans, and we understand that this isn\u2019t about the law. This isn\u2019t about the judicial process. This is about politics. \u201d Marlow turned the conversation to the release of President Trump\u2019s budget and its basic theme of \u201craise military spending, cut spending from the various agencies. \u201d \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing in the meetings I\u2019ve been a party to with the president over the last eight weeks, one of the most trying issues for him, again and again and again, is waste  \u2014   the gargantuan amounts of waste we have inside the federal government,\u201d Gorka said.  \u201cThat\u2019s why we have our rule that you can\u2019t bring a new regulation unless two are rescinded in its place. That\u2019s why we\u2019re concentrating on what really matters to national security after eight years of cuts, after eight years of undermining our armed forces, and saving money where we can,\u201d he explained. \u201cWhen you are as successful as Donald J. Trump was in the private sector, the bottom line really matters,\u201d Gorka said. \u201cThis is a man who cares about national security but also cares about your pocketbook. Whether you voted for him or not, he is driven by saving money for the U. S. taxpayer, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to see in the budget. \u201d Gorka said the biggest military budget issue at the moment is combat readiness. \u201cThe Marine Corps, for example, is having to cannibalize not old aircraft, but cannibalize current aircraft, that are in current use, to keep other aircraft flying. That is just untenable. This is the United States of America. We don\u2019t do that. One of the key priorities is going to be making sure that our warfighters have what they need to prosecute their missions,\u201d he vowed. Marlow described President Trump\u2019s $1. 2 billion infrastructure plan that could be difficult to sell to   voters and challenging to execute in a manner that provides good return on the taxpayers\u2019 investment. \u201cAs somebody who travels a fair bit, you just have to understand that if you go around other parts of the world  \u2014   whether it\u2019s Europe, whether it\u2019s Asia, or elsewhere  \u2014   we have lagged behind,\u201d Gorka contended. \u201cWe have seen our infrastructure not looked after in recent decades. It simply is not at the standard that would match our role in the world. \u201d \u201cSo number one, there is a problem. Number two, when the president first announced this initiative, he chose his words very, very carefully. He didn\u2019t say it\u2019s one trillion dollars\u2019 worth of taxpayer money. He said there will be this initiative, but it\u2019s not all going to come out of your pocket. That\u2019s very important to understand. We are looking at more than just the federal budget to fund these kinds of measures,\u201d he noted. \u201cLastly, it\u2019s not pork barrel. It\u2019s not simply projects, bridges to nowhere. It\u2019s about getting America back on track, and infrastructure is essential to that. You can concentrate on jobs for Americans, you can concentrate on the automotive industry, you can concentrate on manufacturing  \u2014   but if you can\u2019t move those people, if you can\u2019t move those materials, then it\u2019s only one small part of the national economy,\u201d he argued.  \u201cInfrastructure is the veins, it\u2019s the system, it is the lifeblood of the economy,\u201d he stated, agreeing with Marlow\u2019s proposition that effective execution of the president\u2019s infrastructure plan would leave a \u201cgreat legacy\u201d for Trump. Marlow asked if there was any progress to report on President Trump\u2019s allegation that the Obama administration \u201cwiretapped\u201d his campaign. \u201cI\u2019m not going to speak for the president, but as somebody who works in the national security sphere, I\u2019m really concerned with this issue in general,\u201d Gorka replied. \u201cWe have now had for months and months and months and months this absurd obsession, this talk, this insinuation of the Russian connection. Where\u2019s the smoking gun? What is the former administration and their lackeys in the media actually positing?\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no \u2018there\u2019 there,\u201d he said. \u201cA phone call was made to an ambassador. Okay, but what else is there? There\u2019s nothing. So that\u2019s why the president said, \u2018Okay, you want to open this can of worms? Let\u2019s look at the whole issue.\u2019 Let\u2019s go right back to Russian involvement on Left and Right, as far back as the beginning of the Obama administration. Let\u2019s shine light on this issue. \u201d Gorka said there was a deeper issue: \u201cWhen we know that sensitive,   sensitive intelligence, transcripts of conversations with U. S. individuals are being given lock, stock, and barrel to the mainstream media, that is what we call the political exploitation of intelligence. That\u2019s not what happens in banana republics, that\u2019s what happens in authoritarian nations. That is something that we must look into. When you start to use the intelligence community\u2019s assets or their product for partisan political purposes, you undermine the whole democratic system. That\u2019s why we want to shed light on all of these issues, to finally stop this kind of perverted exploitation. \u201d Marlow said Democrats seem determined to provoke hostility between Trump and Russia by pushing the narrative of Trump as either a sympathizer of Russian President Vladimir Putin or his pawn. He noted that Breitbart News was strongly critical of Russia during Gorka\u2019s tenure as National Security editor and remains so under editor Frances Martel. Gorka suggested asking Obama and Clinton hands like Ben Rhodes and John Podesta why the Democrats are pursuing this strategy. He chuckled as Marlow promptly issued instructions to invite them as guests for the next edition of Breitbart News Daily. \u201cI think there\u2019s a couple of potential explanations,\u201d Gorka speculated, to tide the audience over until such time as Rhodes and Podesta swing by the studio to explain themselves. \u201cWith regards to Syria, I think some personal animus was built up between Moscow and the last administration. Beyond that, I think it\u2019s laziness. I think it\u2019s scapegoating. \u201d \u201cI take umbrage at your saying Frances takes a stronger line than I did, but we can talk about that later,\u201d he added humorously. \u201cMy family history is very clear, what my parents went through under communism and et cetera. \u201d  \u201cThe bottom line is they need an explanation for why they lost,\u201d Gorka said of the Democrats. \u201cIf you cannot admit that your candidate was an appalling candidate who lost because she had no message except \u2018I\u2019m a woman and I deserve to be president,\u2019 you\u2019re going to have to find an answer as to why she was trounced. The easiest one is Russia, WikiLeaks, the KGB, the SVR, everything else. I think it\u2019s handy, it\u2019s easy, it\u2019s lazy, it\u2019s scapegoating. \u201d Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern.
