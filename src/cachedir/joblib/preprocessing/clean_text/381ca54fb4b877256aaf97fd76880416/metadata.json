[With the move to Vegas and the growth of sports betting websites such as Draft Kings, many have wondered just how hard the NFL will continue the fight to restrict gambling. But, Goodell\u2019s recent comments seem to answer that question, at least for now, USA Today reports.  \u201cI would probably tell you that I think society has probably had a little bit of a change with respect to gambling in general,\u201d Goodell said at the league\u2019s annual meeting in Arizona on Tuesday. \u201cI think we still strongly oppose it in that room, and otherwise, legalized sports gambling. The integrity of our game is No. 1. We will not compromise on that. \u201d Even with that negative assessment, Goodell did admit that Vegas isn\u2019t the same, crooked city it once was. \u201cBut I also believe that Las Vegas is not the same city it was 10 years ago or 20 years ago. It\u2019s a much more diverse city. It has become an entertainment mecca. It\u2019s the   city in the country,\u201d he added. \u201cSo I think when you look at it today versus what it was a decade or two ago, I think it\u2019s a much different city. And they made a very compelling proposal, which the owners obviously approved overwhelmingly. \u201d Indeed, many polls have shown an increased tolerance for gambling among the pubic. Polls last year revealed that nearly half of respondents were in favor of legalizing sports betting. Governments are also hungrily eyeing sports betting as a likely new source of tax revenue, as well. Consequently, various bills have been introduced in Congress to lift the federal ban on sports betting. But, other signs pointed to new problems in the internet age when sports fan sites like Draft Kings and Fan Duel came under fire for corrupt practices last year. Yet, even with the controversies, it was reported that several pro sports leagues are looking to work closer with the gambling industry. Unlike the NFL\u2019s Goodell, NBA chief Adam Silver recently went in the opposite direction on sports betting by softening his league\u2019s stance against gambling. But, there is still faint hope for gamblers looking for football to favor them. In the end Goodell noted that the NFL reserves the right to change rules whenever it makes sense to do so.
