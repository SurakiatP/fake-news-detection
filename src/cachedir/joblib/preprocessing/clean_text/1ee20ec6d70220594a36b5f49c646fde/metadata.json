The Australian tradition of backyard cricket has gotten much more competitive in recent years.

Richards vehemently denies that he tampered with the ball, despite half of it being covered in a mysterious tape for the duration of the match. PHOTO: Supplied. \\nHowever, video has emerged of Richards allegedly tampering with the ball with what seems like red electrical tape. \\n\u201cThe tape was already on the ball before we started playing. That\u2019s well within the rules,\u201d he said. \\nNeighbours described his spell as \u201cfrightening and intense\u201d but added numerous dismissals were through the six-and-out by-law. \\nIn addition to his economical and wicket-to-wicket line-and-length bowling style, Richards also used an impressive array of sledges and other psychological tactics to get under the skin of the opposition team. \\nHis daughter Kayla explains. \\n\u201cDad would dip one in short and I\u2019d have to dive out-of-the-way,\u201d she said. \\n\u201cEvery time I tried to dodge the short balls, he\u2019d call me a poofter, which doesn\u2019t make any sense to me,\u201d \\nDespite the criticism levelled against him, Richards has lashed out at his detractors. \\n\u201cYou don\u2019t hear Johno (Mitchell Johnson) whinge about how he takes \u2019em\u201d the one-time 3rd grader said. \\n\u201cI\u2019m already growing the mo\u2019 so I can steam in with him when The Ashes start.\u201d \\n\u201cI played it smart. Me boy Jacob (aged 8 ) Is a pretty timid kid. I knew after knocking over Darcy (aged 5) with a full toss that he would be pretty nervous at the crease. I banged the first one in short to get him backing away. He was a frightened rabbit after that. All I had to do was put the next one on the stumps. Seven balls later I had his wicket.\u201d \\nWith additional reporting from the Wynnum Advertiser. \\n2 Responses to \" Brisbane Dad Takes 7 Backyard Wickets In \u201cFrightening Return To Form\u201d \" Greg July 6, 2015 at 5:08 pm \\nBest one yet boys, keep it up'"}, "time": 1742562233.987079}
