A technician works to prepare voting machines to be used in the upcoming presidential election, in Philadelphia, Friday, Oct. 14, 2016. \\nCould these connections be enough to implicate the Clinton Foundation in the alleged early vote rigging in Texas? \\nAs usual, the internet has come through as the ultimate watchdog while the supposed safeguards of our democracy have failed. \\nA Gab user by the name \u201cSpecial Prosecutor Will Logan\u201d has found some stunning information. Note: as Gab is a members only site, you\u2019ll have to join to see his actual posts, but we included all pertinent information in the article. Click to enlarge \\nAccording to OpenSecrets, the company who provided the alleged glitching voting machines is a subsidiary of The McCarthy Group. \\nThe McCarthy group is a major donor to the Clinton Foundation \u2013 apparently donating 200,000 dollars in 2007 \u2013 when it was the largest owner of United States voting machines. Or perhaps the 200,000 dollars went to paying Bill Clinton for speeches? \\nEither way, it doesn\u2019t look good. \\nBut there\u2019s more. \\nAs the same user notes in this post , Dominion Voting Systems and The Clinton Foundation did a 2.25 million dollar charity initiative in developing nations together called the DELIAN Project. \\nAccording to the project\u2019s own website : In 2014, Dominion Voting committed to providing emerging and post-conflict democracies with access to voting technology through its philanthropic support to the DELIAN Project, as many emerging democracies suffer from post-electoral violence due to the delay in the publishing of election results. Over the next three years, Dominion Voting will support election technology pilots with donated Automated Voting Machines (AVM), providing an improved electoral process, and therefore safer elections. As a large number of election staff are women, there will be an emphasis on training women, who will be the first to benefit from the skills transfer training and use of AVMs. It is estimated that 100 women will directly benefit from election technology skills training per pilot election. \\nOf course, this is all speculation, and we are not making any claims of illegal activity by the Clinton Foundation. \\nHowever, it presents a very troubling conflict of interest. Most Americans would certainly agree that voting machines should have zero connection to presidential candidates and their foundations. \\nConsider the implications further abroad, as well. Could this DELIAN Project be designed to influence elections in developing nations? \\nIt can certainly be argued that electronic voting machines do not in fact provide an \u201cimproved electoral process\u201d or provide \u201csafer elections\u201d \\nAgain, this is speculation.
