The stupid early-1990s prediction about the \u2018end of history\u2019 turned into a \u2013 possible \u2013 shock of the new. \\nThe new global nativism? Perhaps a new push towards democratic socialism? Too early to tell. \\nOnce again. A body blow, not a death blow. Like the cast of The Walking Dead , the zombie neoliberal elite simply won\u2019t quit. For the Powers That Be/Deep State/Wall Street axis, there\u2019s only one game in town, and that is to win, at all costs. Failing that, to knock over the whole chessboard, as in hot war. \\nHot war has been postponed, at least for a few years. Meanwhile, it\u2019s enlightening to observe the collective American and Eurocrat despair about a world they can\u2019t understand anymore; Brexit, Trumpquake, the rise of the far-right across the West. For the insulated financial/tech/think-tank elites of liquid modernity, criticism of neoliberalism \u2013 with is inbuilt deregulation, privatization a-go-go, austerity obsession \u2013 is anathema. \\nThe angry, white, blue collar Western uprising is the ultimate backlash against neoliberalism \u2013 an instinctive reaction against the rigged economic casino capitalism game and its subservient political arms. That\u2019s at the core of Trump winning non-college white voters in Wisconsin by 28 points. Blaming \u201cwhitelash\u201d , racism, WikiLeaks or Russia is no more than childish diversionary tactics. \\nThe key question is whether the backlash may engender a new Western drive towards democratic socialism \u2013 read David Harvey\u2019s books for the road map \u2013 or just nostalgic nationalism raging against the neoliberal Washington/EU/NAFTA/ globalization machine. \\nRead my lips: much lower taxes \\nTrump is proposing to turn the tables on the neoliberal game. Throughout his campaign he criminalized free trade \u2013 the essence of globalization \u2013 for decimating the American working class, even as US businesses blamed free trade for forcing them to squeeze workers\u2019 wages. \\nSo let\u2019s see how Trump will be able to impose his priorities. In parallel to addressing the appalling structural decline in US manufacturing, he wants to pull a China: a massive $1 trillion infrastructure project over 10 years via public-private partnerships and private investments encouraged by lower taxes. That\u2019s supposed to create a wealth of jobs. \\nLower corporate taxes in this case translate into a whopping $3 trillion over 10 years, something like 1.6 percent of GDP. That would be the way to incite huge multinationals to repatriate the hundreds of billions of dollars in profits stashed abroad. This fiscal shock would create 25 million jobs in the US over the next 10 years, and propel a 4 percent growth rate. \\nAnd then there\u2019s the protectionist drive that will renegotiate NAFTA and kill TPP for good. Not to mention raising import tariffs over manufactured products (many by de-localized US multinationals) imported from China and Mexico. \\nIt\u2019s open to fierce debate how Trumponomics will manage to square the circle; with more economic growth fueled by less taxes, imports will rise to satisfy internal demand. But if these products are subjected to stiffer tariffs, they will become more expensive, and inflation will inevitably rise. \\nAnyway, the bottom line of protectionist Trumponomics would be a huge blow against global trade. Deglobalization, anyone? \\nAsia braces for impact \\nPredictably, the heart of deglobalization will be the Trump-China relationship. Throughout the campaign, Trump blamed China for currency manipulation and proposed a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports. \\nIn Hong Kong banking circles, no one believes in it. Key argument: the already strapped basket of \u201cdeplorables\u201d simply won\u2019t have the means to pay more for these Chinese imports. \\nAnother thing entirely would be for Trumponomics to find mechanisms to hurt US companies that de-localize in Asia. That would translate into serious problems for outsourcing Meccas such as India and the Philippines. Outsourcing in the Philippines, for instance, serves mostly US companies and attracts revenue as crucial to the nation as total Filipino worker remittances from abroad, something like 9 percent of GDP. \\nIt\u2019s quite enlightening in this context to consider what Narayana Murthy \u2013 founder of Indian IT major Infosys \u2013 told the CNBC TV-18 network; \u201cWhat is in the best interest of America is for its corporations to succeed, for its corporations to create more jobs\u2026 to export more\u2026 so I\u2019m very positive.\u201d \\nour months ago Nomura Holdings Inc. issued a report titled \u201cTrumping Asia\u201d . No less than 77 percent of respondents expected Trump to brand China a currency manipulator; and 75 percent predicted he will impose tariffs on exports from China, South Korea and Japan. \\nSo no wonder all across Asia the next months will be nerve-wracking. Asia \u2013 and not only China \u2013 is the factory of the world. Any Trump trade restriction over China will reverberate all across Asia. \\nBrace for impact: deglobalized Trumponomics vs. Neoliberalism will be a battle for the ages.
