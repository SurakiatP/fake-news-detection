Breitbart (h/t Emma) Lorenzo Chinalleto, whose cooperative hosts migrants at the Hotel Byron in the Venice province, said migrants respond with displeasure when receiving clothes from Catholic charity Caritas and other charitable bodies, because the goods are unbranded. He explained: \u201cUnfortunately they come to Italy with the asylum reception systems of northern Europe as a model. When they arrived we gave them clothes, standard clothes. \u201cBut they want brand-name clothes like Armani and Boss, and they asked for Pirelli shoes. These are their models. When they came to us, they didn\u2019t have clothes, but they all had smartphones,\u201d the Italian added . Forty of the migrants hosted at the Hotel Byron took to the streets to express their dissatisfaction, blocking the traffic. In a video (below) taken outside the hotel on Monday protesters can be seen shouting, in English, that they don\u2019t want to eat pasta. The migrants originate mostly from Senegal, Nigeria, Somalia, Mali and Ghana, Il Gazzettino reported . Migrants frequently hit the headlines in Italy protesting their living conditions in the country, which has recently been hit hard by several earthquakes. In May a group of \u201cunaccompanied minors\u201d launched a violent protest in order to be transferred from Fondachelli Fantina, complaining that there were \u201ctoo few entertainment possibilities\u201d in the town. After they had completely destroyed the reception centre to the point where it cannot be used again, the Interior Ministry transferred the migrants to a luxury hotel. In June migrants staying in a small town in Sardinia protested for several days demanding better meals, a television set in every room, and a daily coach to take them to the island\u2019s capital, Cagliari. Tensions in the town ran high as the migrants brandished sticks and smashed property. Regional director of the populist Sardinian Action Party, Marcello Orr\u00f9, commented on the controversy. He said: \u201cIt is intolerable for us to continue to accept these people who don\u2019t like the welcome offered, the meals and their lodgings at the hotel for free. And who then protest to have a television in the room and a daily bus take them to Cagliari for free. \u201cIt\u2019s too easy to accuse us of racism and xenophobia, but we refuse to accept this total and grave injustice to the Sardinian people. These boys are muscular and equipped with the latest model iPhones. \u201cI say if they want a TV in the room and maybe even a masseuse, they must be loaded on a ship and sent back to Africa immediately. With a one-way ticket\u201d.'"}, "time": 1742628402.4463007}
