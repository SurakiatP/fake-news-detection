[While he didn\u2019t set a specific end date to hang up the wig and tie, the    actor told Extra\u2019s Mario Lopez that he wouldn\u2019t be doing his most famous impersonation \u201cmuch longer. \u201d  \u201cTrump just overwhelmingly lacks any sportsmanship, he remains, bitter, and angry, and you just want to look at him and go, \u2018You won! \u2019\u201d Baldwin told Extra, saying he\u2019d hoped the president would change once in office. \u201cHis policies aside, which you can hate, I thought he would have just relaxed. \u201d \u201cThe maliciousness of this White House has people worried,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m not going to do it much longer, the impersonation, I don\u2019t know how much more people can take it. \u201d Baldwin debuted as Trump during the   NBC show\u2019s 42nd season, before the presidential election, and continued to return to the role following Trump\u2019s inauguration in January. The show\u2019s skits have mocked Trump\u2019s penchant for tweeting and skewered his confrontation with the 9th Circuit Court over the halt on his executive order on immigration last month. Offscreen, Baldwin has been a fierce critic of the president. He spoke at an   rally outside Manhattan\u2019s Trump Tower alongside Michael Moore and Mark Ruffalo before the inauguration, and has trolled the president on Twitter. While Saturday Night Live enjoyed some of its highest ratings in years this season, a recent survey found that viewers have grown weary of the show\u2019s constant assaults on Trump. A Morning Consult poll released in February found that more viewers than not would like the show to focus its attention elsewhere. Though he may not play the president on SNL much longer, Baldwin is reportedly working on a satirical book about his time playing Trump.
