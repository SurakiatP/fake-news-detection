[The Times\u2018 Anemona Hartocollis reported that the college \u201chad to hold its commencement 30 miles from campus, at a rented baseball stadium where everyone had to pass through metal detectors. \u201d  Her explanation of why that came to pass suggests conservative media are to blame for stirring up threats from outside the campus, and totally ignores the violent role of   activists on campus, some of whom have been \u201cpatrolling\u201d campus with baseball bats. She ignored critical details in the story, such as the fact that campus police told Weinstein they could not protect him. Hartocollis also sided with critics of professor Weinstein, who supported black students\u2019 efforts to draw attention to racial issues but refused to obey when they told white professors and students not to come to campus. She quoted a professor who is angry that he shared his dispute with the outside press: \u201cThat he took this public I just feel like is a breach of trust. \u201d Hartocollis also suggested Weinstein is acting out of greed, noting that he has a \u201cnew blog offering his subscribers insights into \u2018evolution, civilization and intolerance\u2018 for a nominal monthly fee\u201d [original link]. Moreover, she did not quote any of Weinstein\u2019s supporters, but supplied a quote from a parent whose daughter is opposed to him: Ellis Paguirigan, a 1991 Evergreen graduate whose daughter, Melia, was graduating and planned to go into ocean conservation, said they were both disappointed in Professor Weinstein\u2019s stance. Melia had Professor Weinstein in her freshman year and liked his class, Mr. Paguirigan said. But, he added, \u201cmy daughter is a person of color  \u2014   she kind of takes it personal. \u201d The implication is that Weinstein is racist  \u2014   exactly the false charge lobbed by the campus mob. The Times has featured at least one   criticizing the left\u2019s behavior at Evergreen. However, its news coverage of the latest developments is a sign of where the paper\u2019s true sympathies lie.
