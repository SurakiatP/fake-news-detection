After the Warsaw Pact disbanded in March 1991, NATO, although deprived of any reason to continue in existence, managed to keep going, and in 1999 added Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary to its 16 members. As the BBC noted, these countries became \u201cthe first former Soviet bloc states to join NATO, taking the alliance\u2019s borders some 400 miles towards Russia.\u201d With good reason Moscow wondered what on earth the US-NATO military alliance might be planning.\\nIn spite of facing no threat whatever from any country in the world, NATO continued to expand around Russia\u2019s borders, inviting Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia to join in 2002, which they did two years later.\\nAs President Putin observed in an interview with Italy\u2019s Corriere della Sera \u201cwe are not expanding anywhere; it is NATO infrastructure, including military infrastructure, that is moving towards our borders. Is this a manifestation of our aggression?\u201d\\nThe US is also implacably hostile to China and does what it can to provoke it in the South China Sea, but NATO has not yet ventured into Eastern waters.\\nMORE... Arise President Trump (or Why it\\'s not the End of the World as We Know it) Trump\\'s sexual predator characteristics - His Grandfather was a pimp, but at least he paid the women he hired The significance of the GOP\\'s attempted purge of Donald Trump Trump, Turkey, and police tyranny: The crisis of Imperialism finds political expression There is certainly confrontation \u2014 but it was originated by the western powers at the behest of Washington. It is dangerous to indulge in military menaces, but the US appears determined to continue such a policy, and the world as a whole will certainly not benefit from its posture.\\nHow do you explain the silence of the media and Western Governments on the infamous war led by Saudi Arabia against the people of the Yemen?\\nThe most important things are money and oil. Western governments and mainstream media may from time to time make statements that \u201cregret\u201d the Saudi war on Yemen, but they will never take action against the Riyadh royal dictatorship that might make it cease its merciless blitz on the Yemeni people. The US State Department records that in Saudi Arabia its \u201ccitizens lack the right and legal means to change their government\u201d while there are \u201cpervasive restrictions on universal rights such as freedom of expression, including on the internet, and freedom of assembly, association, movement and religion; and a lack of equal rights for women . . .\u201d, but Washington takes no action to encourage the Saudi monarchy to relax or even modify its domestic tyranny.\\nSaudi Arabia is a valued ally of the United States and indulges in \u201ctorture and other abuses [and] arbitrary arrest and detention,\u201d while \u201cfreedom of religion is neither recognized nor protected under the law.\u201d It might be imagined that the President of the United States might feel it proper to indicate his disapproval of the fact that in Saudi Arabia \u201ccivil law does not protect human rights, including freedom of the speech and of the press.\u201d \u2014 but no US president will ever do anything to discourage the Saudi monarchy from continuing its domestic tyranny and murder of so many innocents in Yemen.\\nDon\u2019t you think that, with Hillary Clinton President of the USA, we\u2019ll have a total war, knowing that she is supported by the neocons and the military-industrial complex?\\nUnder a Clinton administration there would have been no cessation of US havoc-wreaking wars around the world, and desperate refugees would have died in their thousands. Her regime would have ensured that the Pentagon\u2019s fleets continue to go down to the seas in confrontation, and the bombers would have streaked across the skies, deliberately provoking China and Russia. Remember that she is one of the Washington-Brussels war-drum beaters who planned the 2011 aerial blitz on Libya to destroy the government of President Gaddafi, about whose murder she giggled that \u201c We came; We saw; He died. \u201d The US-NATO attacks on Libya caused massive suffering and destruction, opened the way for feuding bands of militants to fight each other for control of parts of the country, and created a haven for the lunatic extremists of Islamic State [aka ISIS].\\nHillary Clinton has not criticised or questioned Obama\u2019s years of aerial bombardment around the world and her foreign policy adviser, Jeremy Bash, told London\u2019s Daily Telegraph that she would order a \u201cfull review\u201d of US strategy on Syria as a \u201cfirst key task\u201d of her presidency, resetting the policy to emphasise the \u201cmurderous\u201d nature of the government. He said that Mrs. Clinton would work to get Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, \u201cout of there.\u201d\\nPresident Assad has been selected as another target for the Clinton policy of \u201cWe came; We Saw; He died,\u201d and his country appears doomed to a rerun of the Libya fiasco.\\nIf Hillary Clinton had become President of the United States, as seemed only too likely, there would have been even greater emphasis on global airstrikes and military confrontation. Greater turmoil, chaos and catastrophe were to come.\\nSeveral reports mention deliveries of Western arms to groups activated in Syria, weapons that ended up in the hands of terrorist groups, such as ISIS-Daesh and al-Nusra. How do you explain the miscalculation of governments that have delivered weapons to terrorists to find these weapons turned against them, as we have seen in various attacks on European soil?\\nThe US supplies weapons to many rebels and insurrectionists around the world. One of the most absurd of these supply chains was in the 1980s when they gave hundreds of Stinger missiles to the Mujahideen in Afghanistan, then had to buy them back for half a million dollars each when it was realised that the Mujahideen were about to use them against civilian airliners. The British have also supplied ground-to-air missiles to insurrectionists groups, with much less publicity but on occasions with serious results. The only explanation for the motives of western governments in doing this sort of thing is that they are poorly informed by their vastly expensive intelligence agencies.\\nThe Americans destroyed Iraq with their ally Tony Blair, Sarkozy made the same thing in Libya with David Cameron, how do you explain that these personalities are not judged, in particular via ICC, authority which judges only African despots?\\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) \u201cinvestigates and, where warranted, tries individuals charged with the gravest crimes of concern to the international community: genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.\u201d But the United States \u201cis not at present a party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court\u201d and although Britain and France are in theory supportive of the ICC, there will never \u2014 ever \u2014 be a political leader of these countries arraigned before the Court for war crimes or anything else. The African despots it judges are no doubt guilty of heinous crimes, but they are also easy to arraign.\\nHow do you explain that Hillary Clinton\\'s candidacy was maintained while she does not stop making headlines with multiple scandals?\\nBecause the Democrat Party desperately wanted a Democrat president. Members of the Party was prepared to hold their noses with one hand to keep out the stink of Hillary\u2019s scandals while with the other hand pressing the button to Vote Hillary.\\nIn your opinion, why do Western Governments continue to support old leaders and despotic regimes and to destabilize others according to their interests under the pretext of \"human rights\", \"democracy\", etc.? Who gave them this right?\\nNobody gave them the right to support or destroy any government, anywhere, but Western politicians and generals continues to believe that, as in the old colonial days, they have a mission to alter the lives of those they consider inferior. There is flexibility in this policy, however, because if dictators are important for the economies of the West, they are permitted to torture detainees, treat women as chattels, forbid freedom of religion and imprison critics.\\nSome of our European intelligence sources tell us that there was a mass movement of Daesh towards some countries of Northern Europe, result of the offensive on Daesh in Syria and Iraq. How do you explain that such redeployment towards Europe is possible with all the risks of attack that entails? Don\u2019t you think that the coordination between European intelligence fails?\\nI do not believe that there has been mass movement of Daesh/IS adherents to northern Europe.\\nLibya is a terrorist sanctuary a few kilometers away from Europe. You have an experience in both military and diplomatic, how do you see the resolution of the Libyan equation, is a crisis that can only be resolved militarily or is the policy which should prevail?\\nUnlike in Saudi Arabia, for example, in Gaddafi\u2019s prosperous Libya there was freedom of religion and women were regarded as human beings. The entire population received free education and medical care. Then the country was reduced to anarchy by the US-NATO aerial blitz of March-October 2011 (Germany refused to join in), during which, among other devastation, water and oil pipelines and pumping stations were deliberately destroyed. Militia bands took over various parts of the country and continue to fight against each other, while extremist Islamic [Wahhabi] groups have grown in size and influence and the \u201cGovernment of National Accord\u201d is powerless.\\nMany of those who energetically supported the war, such as the former secretary general of NATO, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, continue to claim that it was a success \u2014 \u201ca model intervention\u201d \u2014 and that it is the fault of \u201cthe international community\u201d that the country is a shambles. But even US President Obama admitted that the war on Libya \u201cdidn\u2019t work\u201d and that failure to have a plan for the future of the country after the murder of President Gaddafi was \u201cthe worst mistake\u201d of his presidency.\\nGiven that the Obama presidency is in its last months, it is unlikely he will order an invasion of Libya to try to eradicate the Islamic [aka Takfiri] terrorists and rebuild the country he and his allies destroyed. He and his supporters in Europe, notably France and Britain, will continue clandestine ground operations, drone attacks and conventional airstrikes to try to assassinate extremist leaders and destroy their gangs, but these will fail. It is difficult to predict the future in Libya, other than to say that it is most likely that its people will continue suffering the appalling effects of the US-NATO war, and that there will be no peaceful resolution of its problems.\\nIs the era of the American domination a fatality? Doesn \\' t humanity may find it beneficial to see the emergence of a multipolar world ?\\nIt should be remembered that in an August 2014 interview with the New York Times President Obama said \u201cOur participation in the coalition that overthrew Qaddafi [emphasis added] in Libya. I absolutely believed that it was the right thing to do.\u201d The name of the game is regime change, but America, the \u201cindispensable nation\u201d has failed in its military adventures all over the world and has created widening instability which in turn has led to growth in extremism and terrorism. Unipolarity, with the US possessing and exercising most military power, has not worked.\\nIt appears that multipolarity might be a better alternative, with other nations restraining Washington from unilateral intervention aimed at overthrowing governments, but it is apparent that the US is determined to do all it can to prevent interference in its world domination strategies. In consequence it has engaged in a deliberate policy of confrontation with China and Russia that is entirely counter-productive and could well lead to war. Multipolarity would probably benefit humanity, but that is irrelevant to the indispensable nation.\\nWhat do you think of the defeat of Hillary Clinton and the victory of Donald Trump?\\nMr. Trump has not elucidated a foreign policy as such, and we can only hope that he will build on the positive indications he has given about America ceasing to meddle militarily all round the world. His greatest achievement would be engage in positive discussions with Russia and China, which would result in vastly diminished tension in east and west. The defeat of Clinton has meant that the threat of US international confrontation has at least diminished, because the world would have been a very dangerous place if she had got in to the White House.\\nInterview realized by Mohsen Abdelmoumen\\nWho is Brian Cloughley?\\nBrian Cloughley is a British and Australian armies\u2019 veteran, former deputy head of the UN military mission in Kashmir and Australian defense attach\u00e9 in Pakistan.\\nHe studied South Asian affairs for forty years and is South Asia defense analyst for IHS/Jane\\'s Sentinel, covering Afghanistan, India and Pakistan, updating material regularly.
