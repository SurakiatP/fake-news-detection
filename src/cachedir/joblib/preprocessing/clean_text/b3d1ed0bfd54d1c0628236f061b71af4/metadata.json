The windows were dark, the tables were empty and the chairs nowhere to be seen. A meal at the restaurant was supposed to be the final stop of the night\u2019s trifecta: first, a trip to Sakaya, a sake store on East Ninth Street then, grocery shopping at Sunrise Mart in the East Village and finally, meat skewers at Yakitori Tora. Ms. Graham, 49, most famous for her TV role as Lorelai Gilmore in \u201cGilmore Girls,\u201d had planned the entire evening. Her love of \u201canything\u201d Japanese, while it may come as a surprise to fans, is anything but arbitrary. Ms. Graham\u2019s grandparents were sent to Japan as missionaries after World War II, and her mother, who died in 2005, spoke fluent Japanese and worked as a buyer for a department store in Japan. And Ms. Graham, who was born in Honolulu, lived in Japan briefly as a baby. Unfortunately, her plans to share the culture she loves were thwarted on this October evening. Even the coolest mom on television, who returns Friday with four   episodes on Netflix, can do little when confronted with a locked door. Other than make you laugh. \u201cLet me tell you of my love of Mexico,\u201d Ms. Graham deadpanned. Instead, she pulled out her phone to call her half sister, Shade Grant, and come up with a fresh plan. They settled on Japonica on University Place, a street Ms. Graham frequented as a    freshman studying acting at N. Y. U. \u201cIt was pretty overwhelming,\u201d she said. She stuck it out for a year, but decided to transfer to Barnard College to study English, after which she received a Master of Fine Arts at Southern Methodist University in 1992. But her big break didn\u2019t come for several more years, when she was cast in \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d in 2000. Ms. Graham recalled the moment in the 1970s when she knew she wanted to act. \u201cMy dad and I went to see \u2018Annie\u2019 at the Kennedy Center, and I got an \u2018Annie\u2019 \u201d Ms. Graham said. \u201cSomebody asked me in a store one day if I was in the cast of \u2018Annie,\u2019 and I said yes, because I so wanted to be in the cast of \u2018Annie.\u2019 So my first role was \u2018person who was in the cast of \u201cAnnie. \u201d\u2019 I think I played it pretty well. \u201d At Japonica, Ms. Graham plopped into a booth next to Ms. Grant, 34. Assessing their outfits for the evening  \u2014   both wore black blazers over    \u2014   Ms. Graham said, \u201cI\u2019d say we kind of dress like our mom. \u201d \u201cShe was a painter, a singer, she was a model, she went to art school, she was interested in writing,\u201d Ms. Graham said of her mother. A similar artistic ambition led Ms. Graham to a variety of creative projects, including a   role in the television show \u201cParenthood\u201d (where she met her partner, the actor Peter Krause) a novel that was published in 2014 and a collection of autobiographical essays, \u201cTalking as Fast as I Can,\u201d which is to be released Tuesday. After scanning the menu, Ms. Graham quickly chose a brand of sake. \u201cIt\u2019s not the most expensive one,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it has gold flakes. \u201d The moment called to mind the witty Lorelai, a character Ms. Graham had not played in a decade. \u201cWhen we did the first table read, there was so much energy in the room, and I was so nervous,\u201d she said. In the time since she first embodied the   single mom, the CW replaced the WB, Netflix became an alternative to cable channels and iPhones turned into a common accessory. That last fact is not lost on Ms. Graham, who has a   alter ego named Old Lady Jackson, who disapproves of televisions in yellow taxis and phones in schools. \u201cIn today\u2019s   world, you\u2019re eating, and you\u2019re like, \u2018Mmm, I can\u2019t wait to   \u2026    \u2019\u201d Ms. Graham said, pretending to drift off in a   reverie. \u201cAnd somewhere over there, someone is taking a picture of you to put on their whatever page,\u201d she said. Luckily, that did not stop her. The sisters ate plenty, swapping items and bantering. (\u201cLet me just taste some,\u201d Ms. Grant said of a salmon sashimi, to which Ms. Graham responded, \u201cYou can\u2019t just try a bite of sushi. It doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d and dropped the entire piece on her plate.) At the end of the meal, Ms. Graham and Ms. Grant waved goodbye to their dinner companions and fell back into easy conversation. The   bottle of sake glittered between them as Ms. Graham dived into what might be her favorite role: cool older sister.'"}, "time": 1742628461.806313}
