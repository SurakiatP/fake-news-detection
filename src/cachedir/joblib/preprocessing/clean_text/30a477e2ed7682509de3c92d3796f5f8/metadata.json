[Berkman\u2019s presence sparks controversy amongst the gay community because of his role in the fight against the transgender bathroom ordinance, aka the \u201cEqual Rights Ordinance,\u201d in Houston in 2015.  Pride Center of St. Louis issued this highly critical statement of the Cardinals decision to invite Berkman: \u201cPride St. Louis is disappointed by the decision of the St. Louis Cardinals to provide a public platform for Berkman, an individual whose words and actions towards the LGBTQ+ are divisive and demeaning. \u201d The group initially released the statement to Outsports, an SB Nation website which prioritizes news involving the LGBT community and sports. According to the St. Louis   \u201cOn its own, Outsports has called Berkman a \u201cbigot\u201d and \u201can outspoken opponent of the LGBT community\u201d who was \u201cone of the faces of the campaign against Houston\u2019s   ordinance\u201d in 2015. \u201d Despite the backlash, as of this writing, the Cardinals remain committed to having Berkman attend \u201cChristian Day. \u201d The team issued their own statement in response to those troubled by the move: \u201cThe Cardinals have hosted a Christian Day at the ballpark for nearly three decades. Lance Berkman participated in Christian Day when he was a Cardinals player, and we welcome him back this year to discuss his faith. \u201d The Cardinals also said they plan to host an event in support of the LGBT community at some point later in the season. Nonetheless, the team makes a good point here. Berkman has attended and spoken at these events before when he, presumably, held the same views towards transgender bathroom laws that he does now. So, what\u2019s the problem? Since it\u2019s likely that the bathroom issue never would have come up on a night dedicated to celebrating the Christian faith, does the LGBT community really want to put the idea out there that they\u2019re fine with tolerating and accepting all things unless Christianity is involved? In his article on the Cardinals invitation to Berkman, Bill Baer wrote that Berkman \u201cfoolishly advocated against public accommodations for transgender people to use public bathrooms. \u201d What was foolish about this? The part where he exercised his constitutional right to express an opinion in a free country? It seems like Bill Baer\u2019s attitude toward tolerance and acceptance is much the same as Outsports and the LGBT community\u2019s attitude: acceptance and tolerance for all  \u2026    unless they disagree with me.
