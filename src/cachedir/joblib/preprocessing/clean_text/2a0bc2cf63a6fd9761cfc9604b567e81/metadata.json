Unfortunately for her, what happened just seconds later was all caught on tape \u2013 and she couldn\u2019t hide it. \\nDespite what she would have you believe, Hillary is not as healthy as she claims. As we\u2019ve seen strange eye movements that hint toward Parkinson\u2019s disease and an ever increasing difficulty to get up or down a flight of stairs , it\u2019s safe to say she won\u2019t make it 4 years in our White House. Hillary Clinton \\nHowever, her most recent stunt has set a few people on edge as it goes to show that she\u2019s suffering from more than just physical impairments. According to The American Mirror , the female presidential hopeful suffered an embarrassing moment as her brain seemingly froze mid-sentence. \\nAll caught on video, Hillary was speaking in Lake Worth, Florida on the topic of solar energy when the crowd started to cheer. At that moment, Hillary stopped dead in her tracks and tried to stutter through her thoughts. \\n\u201cThey\u2019re not exactly known as the sunshine states,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of great things about those states, but think about the jobs that can be created, as well as contributing to what we need to do together to save\u2026\u201d she said before awkwardly pausing and finally adding, \u201c\u2026our country and the world.\u201d \\nUnfortunately for her, not even she could hide the embarrassing brain freeze as it was all caught on camera. Although some people are saying she may have been distracted, that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case as it has happened before. \\nIn fact, there is also footage of the last ordeal that took place before she gained the nomination. While speaking at a rally where she was attacking Bernie Sanders, a similarly embarrassing series of events played out: \\nMany people have been saying how Hillary\u2019s brain isn\u2019t quite up to par, but we\u2019re seeing more and more of it as her campaign progresses. She has been in the campaign spotlight for about a year now, and America is starting to catch on to her dirty little secret. \\nIf she can\u2019t handle one year on the campaign trail, how is she going to look in another few years after suffering the abuse that a presidential term comes with? Any responsible person would have dropped out long ago \u2013 like maybe, the first time she literally dropped in the streets at the 9/11 memorial event in New York City. \\nIt just goes to show how far this woman is willing to go in her pursuit of power. Let\u2019s just hope that Donald Trump shuts her down in November before she can do our nation any more harm.'"}, "time": 1742562006.780552}
