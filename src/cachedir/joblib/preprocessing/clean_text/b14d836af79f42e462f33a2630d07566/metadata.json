One guy,   after the vicious murder of his parents, dresses up as a bat to fight crime. Another similarly   fellow dresses up as a spider. And those are the heroes. Even in that world, the psychological profile of Harley Quinn stands out. Best known as the former girlfriend of the Joker, Harley suffers from multiple personalities, homicidal tendencies, Stockholm syndrome and possibly \u201cshared psychotic disorder. \u201d A survivor of domestic violence (not surprising, given her former beau) she has murdered   and kids. Her weapons of choice include mallets, baseball bats and exploding cupcakes. Despite her mental issues and misdeeds (or perhaps because of them) Harley is having a moment. This year, she headlined three books, including a   monthly comic and two    . She\u2019s a lead character on \u201cDC Super Hero Girls,\u201d an animated web series, and can be seen in the new video game Batman: Arkham Underworld (one of more than a dozen games she has appeared in since 1994). And then there\u2019s the new Warner Bros. film \u201cSuicide Squad. \u201d Based on a comic series about a   team of incarcerated supervillains, the film stars Margot Robbie as Harley in the character\u2019s first     appearance. How did Harley become one of the most popular female characters in the DC Universe? In part, by cleaning up her act, or what passes for clean in her world. In several incarnations  \u2014   most notably, her foray into video games  \u2014   Harley has been a true supervillain, maiming and killing with unbridled glee. Now she\u2019s more of an antihero, as in \u201cSuicide Squad,\u201d where she and a team of bad guys take on even worse guys in \u201cDirty Dozen\u201d  missions. In \u201cDC Super Hero Girls,\u201d which is aimed at a tween audience, she\u2019s even tamer. Harley is actually one of the good guys, sharing a dorm room with her pal Wonder Woman at a very exclusive high school (only teen superheroes allowed). Her rise is all the more intriguing when you factor in her love life. As the Joker\u2019s girlfriend, she was the prototypical victim, enduring beatings, murder attempts and the most sadistic sorts of mind games  \u2014   and always coming back for more. Then there\u2019s her   relationship with her fellow supervillain Poison Ivy. The long hugs, the sleepovers, the soulful stares? Even Batgirl put two and two together. Last year, DC\u2019s official Twitter account confirmed that Harley and Ivy were indeed girlfriends, albeit \u201cwithout the jealousy of monogamy. \u201d As an abuse survivor and free agent, Harley has become something of a feminist icon  \u2014   magazines like Bust have praised her complexity, smarts and subversive sexuality  \u2014   even as she revels in her own bouts of sadistic fun. When the writer Paul Dini and the artist Bruce Timm first introduced the character in 1992 in an episode of \u201cBatman: The Animated Series,\u201d it was a small role, the lone female among the Joker\u2019s motley crew of henchmen. The twist: Unlike the others, Harley clearly had a thing for her boss. It was strictly a  . \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to give Joker a girlfriend because it humanizes him,\u201d Mr. Timm said, \u201cand we were really trying to stress how bizarre and creepy he could be. \u201d But Harley clearly had something. Between Mr. Timm\u2019s striking take on the classic harlequin costume  \u2014   he ditched the \u201cfrills and spangles\u201d of the commedia dell\u2019arte original for a skintight bodysuit of alternating blacks and reds  \u2014   and the voice actress Arleen Sorkin\u2019s    reads (a singsongy Brooklyn accent that could, in a   jump from pure sugar to nuts) Harley became an instant hit. Two years later, her creators finally got around to revealing her origin in the   comic The Batman Adventures: Mad Love. N\u00e9e Harleen Frances Quinzel, Harley was working in Gotham City\u2019s infamous Arkham Asylum as a psychiatrist when she met and fell in love with one of her patients: the Joker. The comic won an Eisner (the industry\u2019s equivalent of an Oscar) for best single story and explored the bizarre love triangle between the Joker (obsessed with Batman, but hot and cold about Harley) Batman (thinks about the Joker a lot, but maybe not obsessively) and Harley (loves the Joker and sees Batman as a rival for his attention). \u201cHarley\u2019s point of view is very pragmatic,\u201d Mr. Dini said. \u201cShe\u2019s like, \u2018Why don\u2019t you just shoot the guy?\u2019 But the Joker can\u2019t just shoot him: He has to triumph over him. \u201d Over the next several years, Harley got her own solo comic book, starred in the   2002 TV series \u201cBirds of Prey\u201d and played a major role in the critically acclaimed 2009 video game Batman: Arkham Asylum, which sold 2. 5 million units within weeks of its release. Tara Strong (\u201cTeen Titans,\u201d \u201cThe Powerpuff Girls\u201d) has voiced Harley in several animated series and video games and considers her one of her favorite characters. \u201cIn general, video games are the most taxing on a voice actor\u2019s instrument, because you\u2019re constantly screaming and doing death sounds and kicking noises,\u201d Ms. Strong said. \u201cIt can make you cranky. But I never get cranky when it\u2019s time for Harley. I don\u2019t care if I have to do a thousand death noises. \u201d But as the video game Harley got darker and meaner and her comic book artists traded in her    cat suit for corsets, short shorts and pigtails, longtime fans balked at what they saw as the hypersexualization of a character who, unlike other DC heroines, was never really about that. The fourth incarnation of the comic series Suicide Squad, which featured a more bare, more murderous Harley, was canceled. \u201cWhen they first started messing with her, with the fishnets and the really extreme makeup and the nasty hairstyles, I was frankly put off by it,\u201d Mr. Timm said. Harley\u2019s redemption began with the 2013 start of the comic series Harley Quinn, written by Amanda Conner and Jimmy Palmiotti. For the    team, the emphasis was on fun. Finally away from her   boyfriend, Harley swaps grim Gotham for the joys of Coney Island, and her day job as a   for more dignified work as a landlady, member of a   team and   shrink. She hasn\u2019t stopped killing people, not completely, but there\u2019s notably less of it (a recent   match involved decapitations and poison gas). Whatever your preference in Harleys  \u2014   classic 1990s jester or this year\u2019s Margot Robbie  \u2014   someone somewhere is dressing up as her, from cosplay events to comic conventions. \u201cI just did a show in France a couple months ago,\u201d Mr. Timm said, \u201cand even in France, there are more Harley cosplayers than any other character. There are people who dress up as her as a psychiatrist, before she even became Harley Quinn. \u201d In \u201cSuicide Squad,\u201d Ms. Robbie sports several outfits and looks during the course of the story. \u201cOne of my complaints with these movies is that everyone always wears the exact same thing,\u201d said David Ayer, the movie\u2019s director. Even so, the biggest criticism he still hears from fans is: Why isn\u2019t Harley in her original jester outfit? \u201cYou know, I tried,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is this sort of a flashback where she appears in it. We tried different things, but it was the more   aesthetic that worked for the character. \u201d Harley is much more than the sum of her costumes, anyway. \u201cI\u2019ve got daughters,\u201d Mr. Ayer said, \u201cand I think they connect with her freedom to be whatever and whoever she wants to be. \u201d For Ms. Strong, there\u2019s something even more primal going on. \u201cSometimes you want to crack someone\u2019s skull in, but you can\u2019t, because that\u2019s illegal,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople love Harley so much because she lets her crazy out. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562997.256632}
