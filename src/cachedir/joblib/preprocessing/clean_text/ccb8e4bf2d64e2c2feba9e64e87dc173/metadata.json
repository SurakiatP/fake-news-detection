Kirby stated that he would not be treating RT as an equal media organisation, to the likes of western mainstream media. Referring to the fact that Russia Today is \"state sponsored\" media, this apparently obliterates his responsibility to provide evidence into allegations of \"Russian bombing of hospitals in Syria.\"  \\nPart of RT funding does come from the government, however this is publicly listed information and not a secret as is often \"exposed\". Who would you rather listen to - state media that is indeed supported by the government that you elected, or corporate interests of the 1%? Furthermore, the Russian Ministry of Defence provides weekly briefings of its own, so Kirby\\'s suggestion to \"ask your own government\" only highlights his seeming obliviousness to pretty much everything. \\nKirby conveniently \"doesn\\'t know\" that \"respectable\" CNN or BBC journalists actively distort the truth to the outlets, while working in Russia. I thought Jennifer Psaaki would be hard to beat, but then this guy happened.... \\nMaria Zakharova holds the equivalent position in Russia as John Kirby does in the US and I think it is fair to say she takes the cake. \\n\\n\\n\\n     Follow us on Facebook!                                                   \\n                                                   \\n\\n       Follow us on Twitter! \\n                               \\n\\n             Donate! \\n'"}, "time": 1742628492.1977954}
