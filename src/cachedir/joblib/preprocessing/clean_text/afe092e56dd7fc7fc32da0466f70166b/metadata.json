After all, Dr. David Wasdell ( http://www.apollo-gaia.org/Har... , p. 15) wrote last year: \u201cAn increase of 1.5\u00b0C was implicit by around 1965. 2\u00b0C was implicit by about1978. So 2\u00b0C was already in the pipeline towards the end of the 1970s. Today we are under the illusion that reducing our emissions will still keep us under 2\u00b0C!\u201d\\nIf Dr. Wasdell is right about us living now with an \u201cillusion,\u201d the efforts of the Peaceful Uprising people are POINTLESS, and worse! Why doesn\u2019t Dahr Jamail realize this? Why does he insist on keep feeding us a PARTIAL dose of the truth, not the WHOLE truth?!'"}, "time": 1742564472.6005597}
