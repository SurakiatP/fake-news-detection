For the months leading up to the presidential election, and in the days since President Trump took office, ultraconservative websites like Breitbart News and Infowars have published a cycle of   stories with misleading claims about refugees. And it is beginning to influence public perception, experts say. That shift was evident on Friday, as many Americans heralded the news that the Trump administration intended to temporarily curb all refugee resettlement and increase the vetting of Syrians. \u201cThere really is a kind of cultural battle going on,\u201d said Cecillia Wang, the deputy legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that kind of xenophobic or   bias is infecting our political discourse about refugees. \u201d In speaking to pollsters about refugee resettlement, Americans tend to cite concerns about the country\u2019s national security and economic health as their biggest worries, but they have also begun to point to disease or rape, experts say. \u201cThis is something where the fear outruns the fact by a factor of 100 to 1 or even 1, 000 to 1,\u201d said William Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who has tracked American sentiment about refugee resettlement over years. Mr. Galston said the reaction to misleading coverage of refugees was reminiscent of the wave of measures introduced in state legislatures in recent years to stop the spread of Islamic law, despite scant evidence that it has been promoted anywhere. And while he doubted that alarmist stories about refugees were powerful enough to change people\u2019s minds, he said the coverage played to existing fears and pushed mere differences of opinion into hyperpartisan outrage. \u201cI think their opinions are being intensified because the intensification of contrary sentiments is increasing polarization,\u201d Mr. Galston said. Outside his job as a police officer in Kansas, Okla. Mike Eason begins and ends his day with the television news  \u2014   first CBS, then Fox, but never CNN, which he hates. Then, he scrolls through Facebook, where he\u2019s read stories about refugees who commit violent crimes against women. \u201cIt\u2019s one of them Facebook things where you see Muslim men are attacking women, and stuff like that, and having no respect for them at all. I\u2019ve got a real issue with that,\u201d he said. \u201cI see story after story after story, and I don\u2019t know how true it is. \u201d Mr. Eason said he was skeptical of stories by unfamiliar websites like American News, but he reads them anyway. He commented on one that was posted to Facebook: The post, which was shared 14, 000 times, linked to a story about a case in which the authorities have not described the immigration status of the suspect, or said that he was a noncitizen. They have also discredited the claim that the man yelled \u201cAllahu akbar\u201d during the episode. Nevertheless, the comment that Mr. Eason posted on the site, which he later said he could not remember making, garnered 87 likes. \u201cIf Muslims are taught hate by their religion,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthen all Muslims are potential terrorists and should be treated accordingly. TRUMP will stop this kind of stuff. \u201d Sgt. Timothy Briggeman of the Cass County Sheriff\u2019s Office in North Dakota, which is investigating the case, said such stories and responses often appeared on social media when a person in his jurisdiction with an   name is charged with a crime. \u201cTo be honest,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s embarrassing and it\u2019s disheartening when anyone with a name of such ends up in the news  \u2014   the comments that get thrown around. That seems to be the No. 1 remark: \u2018Send them back and get rid of them,\u2019 and, \u2018We don\u2019t need them. \u2019\u201d Worries that refugees might be radicalized have also been amplified on the internet. This story was shared at least 1, 400 times: And this one, posted by The Daily Caller, was shared more than 3, 000 times, despite linking to a story with no evidence of a  : The actual number of refugees who have become extremists in the United States has been estimated at between three and 12  \u2014   out of the more than 800, 000 who have resettled here since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. The online stories about refugees range from outright fake news to those based on a grain of truth and then stretched out of proportion. For example, the Breitbart article about genital mutilation was based on a study that estimated that a   women currently living in the United States have had their genitals mutilated. But most of them were immigrants who had fled here because of such treatment in their home countries. Mr. Eason, the police officer in Oklahoma, said that part of the challenge for him in evaluating stories on the internet is that many are written with headlines that appeal to common sense. He pointed to the vetting of Syrian refugees, for example, which is currently under review as part of Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order. As The New York Times has reported, the process involves dozens of layers of evaluation and can last up to two years. But Mr. Eason has read stories that suggest the conditions in Syria are so bad that it is impossible to verify refugees\u2019 stories, which has made him worry that no level of scrutiny will be sufficient. \u201cThey were saying with them coming from these areas, it\u2019s hard to vet them,\u201d Mr. Eason said. \u201cAnd it makes sense. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563596.7336285}
