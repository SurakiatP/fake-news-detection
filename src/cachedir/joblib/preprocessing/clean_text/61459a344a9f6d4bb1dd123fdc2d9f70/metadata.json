Ms. Pearl was 19 when she quit the Boston Conservatory in 2009 to join the elite group of dancers  \u2014   strong, athletic and poised  \u2014   who are as emblematic of New York City as the Empire State Building and the yellow taxi cab. For eight years, she was proud to be a Rockette, and the company treated her well, with generous pay and health insurance. But in   when management announced that the dancers would perform at the inauguration of Donald J. Trump, Ms. Pearl did something that a Rockette is never supposed to do. She stepped out of line, breaking with the silent, smiling solidarity that defines the    institution, to denounce the idea of celebrating a man with a   history of objectifying women. In a rare collision of presidential politics and a venerable arts organization, current and former Rockettes find themselves in a new kind of spotlight  \u2014   a position both painful and empowering  \u2014   as they take sides over the inauguration, a split illustrating the cultural divide that   Trump has cleaved through the country. \u201cWe are a group of women that is encouraging young girls to be strong, independent women, to fulfill their dreams, to go for it,\u201d Ms. Pearl, 27, said in her first interview since the inaugural uproar began. \u201cIt\u2019s about women\u2019s rights. \u201d But Patty DeCarlo Grantham, the president of the Rockette Alumnae Association, which has about 550 members, said that many of them are upset about the furor and support the Rockettes performing at the inauguration, as they did in 2001 and 2005. \u201cSo many people wrote to me and said, \u2018I feel so ashamed about what\u2019s going on,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Grantham, 76. \u201cWe feel like it\u2019s a great honor to be asked to dance. \u201d Best known as a Christmastime tourist attraction at Radio City Music Hall, the Rockettes are also regarded in artistic circles as some of the finest dancers in New York City. But the controversy has reignited sensitivities within the corps that they are seen as beauty pageant contestants more than skilled performers and that they are easy to lampoon. On last weekend\u2019s episode of \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d Alec Baldwin, portraying Mr. Trump, said of the inauguration lineup, \u201cBest of all, we\u2019ve got the one Rockette with the least money in her savings. \u201d Dottie   a    former Rockette, said, \u201cHere you have the most sophisticated women that are so well respected in this country. \u201d She added, \u201cTo put them on the same stage as this man, to me, is reprehensible. \u201d The individual Rockettes had no say in the inauguration booking: It was ultimately the decision of James L. Dolan, the executive chairman of the Madison Square Garden Company, which manages the Rockettes. Mr. Dolan is a longtime friend of Mr. Trump and donated to his campaign he has supported both Democrats and Republicans in the past. A company spokesman, Barry Watkins, declined requests for interviews with Mr. Dolan and current leaders and members of the Rockettes. Mr. Watkins, in response to written questions about the Rockettes as well as the inauguration performance, wrote by email, \u201cThe New York Times has had an   Trump agenda for quite some time and now the Rockettes are on the receiving end of their bias. \u201d This article is based on interviews over the last three weeks with Ms. Pearl, who was a Rockette until this month, and nine former Rockettes, as well as others in the extended Rockette organization. Several people spoke anonymously for fear that if they were to speak publicly, the Madison Square Garden Company would take legal action against them. The backlash over the inauguration performance began on Twitter and Facebook after Ms. Pearl wrote a private Instagram post. \u201cI am speaking for just myself, but please know that after we found out this news, we have been performing with tears in our eyes and heavy hearts,\u201d Ms. Pearl wrote. She believes a friend of hers shared her photo with the celebrity gossip blog Perez Hilton. She and her fellow performers would later learn that their performance at the inauguration would not be mandatory, as some feared, but it was too late to stop criticism from strangers who took to social media to tell her to shut up and dance. Supporters wondered whether she and her fellow dancers were under a gag order. A news crew, Ms. Pearl said, showed up at her Harlem apartment. That sort of attention came as a shock within the world of the Rockettes, which is devoted to a particular kind of   synchronicity, where no one person dominates the stage. A Radio City Rockette is a specialist in precision dance technique, a rare, regimented and intricate style that requires both athleticism and artistry. Rockettes must stand between    and       and uphold a standard of elegance, along with an expertise in tap, modern dance, jazz and ballet. They must hit positions with military exactitude. It\u2019s a style that requires a dancer to step into a line  \u2014   not to take over and not to be left behind. It takes fortitude and humility. \u201cYou don\u2019t realize how much individuality you have as a dancer until you\u2019re asked to dance like 35 other women,\u201d said Jessica McRoberts, 39, a former Rockette. \u201cThings down to your pinkie finger. \u201d Under the leadership of Linda Haberman, who began directing and choreographing touring productions of the \u201cChristmas Spectacular\u201d in 1993, the Rockettes gained artistic respect and became modernized with more challenging choreography. Ms. Haberman left the organization in 2014 and declined a request for comment. Despite requests, the Madison Square Garden Company did not make the troupe\u2019s current director, Karen Keeler, available for interviews. The rigors of performing and traveling as a company often allow dancers to form close and lasting bonds, according to Ms. Grantham, the alumnae president, who was a Rockette from 1959 until 1970. Ms. Grantham said that the Rockettes have a long history of performing for presidents and at events in New York City hosted by both Republicans and Democrats. \u201cOne time we did benefits for both parties in one night,\u201d she said. \u201cOne was at the Sheraton, and the other was at the Hilton. \u201d This wouldn\u2019t be the first time the Rockettes performed for a controversial president, but the volatile media climate surrounding Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration is unusual. Rhonda Malkin, a former Rockette who worked as a personal trainer to Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner for two years, said that the Trump and Kushner families were supportive of her career as a Rockette. Once, they attended a performance to see her dance. \u201cI think they would like to see the Rockettes perform at the inauguration,\u201d she said of the Trump family. \u201cWhether or not that causes a rift throughout the brand is yet to be seen. \u201d Ms. Malkin, 38, said that several of the current Rockettes she knows are upset that a crew of 13   Rockettes were initially told by their union, the American Guild of Variety Artists, that they would be forced to perform. \u201cThere are some career Rockettes who are very upset about this,\u201d Ms. Malkin said of the inauguration plans. \u201cI\u2019ve also heard the women of color are very upset. From what I have heard, it has just caused a real rift in the company. \u201d Ms. Malkin, who was a Rockette for 12 years, said Ms. Pearl \u201ctook a real risk\u201d for speaking out, but she doubts that the controversy surrounding the inauguration has caused any lasting damage to the brand. \u201cI would honestly say that the majority of our audience members are white Christian conservative people,\u201d Ms. Malkin said. \u201cAnd those folks probably supported Trump. \u201d Of Mr. Dolan, the Madison Square Garden chairman, she added, \u201cHe knows those are the people who buy tickets to those shows. \u201d While the Rockettes are an American symbol  \u2014   as much as Radio City Music Hall or Mr. Trump and his branded buildings  \u2014   the group\u2019s individual dancers remain fairly anonymous. They don\u2019t speak unless deemed   by the Madison Square Garden Company, which has fiercely protected them against criticism surrounding the inauguration. \u201cFor a while we weren\u2019t allowed to say, \u2018I\u2019m going to be on the \u2018Today\u2019 show with the Rockettes tomorrow morning,\u2019\u201d said Naomi Kakuk, 40, a former Rockette. \u201cYou\u2019d say: \u2018Watch the \u2018Today\u2019 show tomorrow  \u2014   you might see a familiar face.\u2019 We couldn\u2019t even say we were on a show that was promoting the show. \u201d Mr. Dolan has been criticized for making the inauguration deal and guarding the Rockettes from media requests, but several former dancers praised his management style, which include generous benefits. Being a Rockette is among the most lucrative jobs a dancer can get in New York, complete with   health insurance even though the company performs on a seasonal basis. Ms. Kakuk, who loved her time as a Rockette, said, \u201cYou get six months of pay for three months of work, and it is six months\u2019 worth of work in three months because it\u2019s so incredibly intense. \u201d She added that some of the dancers live in New York during the Christmas show and then go home to Wisconsin or Florida to teach. \u201cYou have insurance for the year, you have a great paycheck, you do all these fun gigs and side things, and you\u2019re doing the show and dancing on the great stage,\u201d Ms. Kakuk said. \u201cYou\u2019re skinny as hell when you get out. You\u2019re bikini ready in January. It\u2019s amazing. \u201d Cheryl Cutlip, who danced as a Rockette for 15 years and left the company in 2008, said that benefits were ushered in quickly after the TV company Cablevision bought Radio City Music Hall in 1997. Ms. Cutlip, 45, remembered Mr. Dolan meeting with the Rockettes to go over their basic needs. She said he gave them his personal email address. Soon, Rockettes no longer had to rush out of the door to find coffee and a bagel in the   space between performance preparations. \u201cHe started bringing food in,\u201d Ms. Cutlip said of Mr. Dolan. \u201cOnce he saw the practical needs of the Rockettes, he started meeting them. \u201d For other former Rockettes, the current controversy reminded them of clashes between the dancers, their union and their corporate employer. Lora Pavilack, a former Rockette, said she had been locked out of the building twice, once for talking to the news media and, another time, during contentious negotiations over a union contract. \u201cThat\u2019s the culture,\u201d she said, \u201cand that\u2019s why they\u2019ve lined up with the  . \u201d Ms. Malkin said that she was also locked out with Ms. Pavilack during contract negotiations in 2005. Madison Square Garden officials declined to comment for this article, but they have said in the past that no one had been locked out during contract negotiations. More than enough Rockettes wanted to perform at the inaugural, but Ms. Kakuk also knows some who are not participating. \u201cI think some of them are done anyway,\u201d she said, \u201cand they were like, \u2018This is the last straw, I\u2019m out. \u2019\u201d Ms. Pearl is one of them. On a recent evening, she ended weeks of silence by taking part in a toast to the First Amendment presented by the Bessies, or the New York Dance and Performance Awards. \u201cPeople have been calling me courageous,\u201d Ms. Pearl said at the toast, her voice cracking. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see it that way. I\u2019m just standing up for human rights. \u201d Many in the dance world, including Yvonne Rainer, the postmodern giant who was part of the toast, and several former Rockettes, including Ms. Kakuk, have voiced enthusiasm for Ms. Pearl\u2019s action and her talent as a dancer. \u201cWhen you see her onstage as a Rockette, you watch her,\u201d Ms. Kakuk said. \u201cShe\u2019s outspoken but less so than others. It was a bit of a surprise. \u201d With the latest holiday season behind her, Ms. Pearl has decided to leave the organization and forge a path in film and television. She found inspiration in the actress Meryl Streep, who spoke out against Mr. Trump at the Golden Globes. \u201cShe can speak freely,\u201d Ms. Pearl said. \u201cI wish to have the opportunity to speak as freely as I can, without any repercussion. \u201d But stepping out of the line is just not the Rockettes\u2019 way. \u201cUsually artists are more outspoken,\u201d Ms. Kakuk said, \u201cbut Rockettes as a brand is not very outspoken. You work for a giant corporation, and a lot of girls don\u2019t realize that. They just think they\u2019re dancing. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562630.0046837}
