Adele opened the show with a performance of her eventual   \u201cHello,\u201d and later returned to the stage to perform \u201cFastlove, Part 1\u201d in a tribute to the late pop icon George Michael. \u201cAdele can sing, sing,\u201d Santana said. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t bring all the dancers and props, she can just stand there and she just stood there and sang the song and that\u2019s it, and this is why she wins. \u201d Not everyone was thrilled with Adele\u2019s sweep Sunday night Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s devoted fans, known as the \u201cBeyhive,\u201d were outraged that the Lemonade singer wasn\u2019t awarded the top honor. In her acceptance speech, an emotional Adele praised Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s album as \u201cmonumental. \u201d \u201cI can\u2019t possibly accept this award,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Lemonade album was just so monumental, Beyonc\u00e9. It was so monumental and well   and beautiful and    \u2026     we appreciate that. All of us artists here adore you. You are our light. \u201d Beyonc\u00e9 is the most nominated female artist in Grammy history, with 62 nominations, and has won 22 of those awards, but failed to claim Album of the Year in three straight nods.
