But both the demonizers and those urging a passive approach are wrong. \\nThe \u201cAnti-Trump\u201d approach is hollow. First, to protest a person is dubious. Too often, \u201cprogressives\u201d have focused on the personal rather than the policies and actions. Remember \u201cAnybody But Bush\u201d? That\u2019s not a particularly uplifting way of approaching things and doesn\u2019t lead to genuinely positive outcomes. Also, Trump is someone who has said a lot of contradictory things. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in an MSNBC interview. \\nSo, you can certainly talk about rights for immigrants or women\u2019s rights or ensuring that anti-Muslim policies do not escalate. But to say \u201canti-Trump\u201d or to ignore good things that Trump has said is hollow. And, yes, there are good things he\u2019s said. For example, during the primaries, he denounced the \u201cregime change\u201d wars waged by George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton: \\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spent $4 trillion trying to topple various people that frankly, if they were there and if we could\u2019ve spent that $4 trillion in the United States to fix our roads, our bridges, and all of the other problems; our airports and all of the other problems we\u2019ve had, we would\u2019ve been a lot better off. I can tell you that right now.\u201d \\nBut it also doesn\u2019t make sense to say \u201clet\u2019s see what he does.\u201d To stand aside is to allow Trump to be cutting deals with House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who will doubtlessly work to take away what populist, anti-interventionist and pro-working-class instincts Trump might otherwise follow. \\nBernie Sanders has in recent days struck a reasonable tone at times. In this interview and in a statement just after the election, he said: \u201cDonald Trump tapped into the anger of a declining middle class that is sick and tired of establishment economics, establishment politics and the establishment media. \u2026 To the degree that Mr. Trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country, I and other progressives are prepared to work with him. To the degree that he pursues racist, sexist, xenophobic and anti-environment policies, we will vigorously oppose him.\u201d \\nThat seems like a reasonable approach although the major problem with what Sanders says is that it ignores foreign policy, a longstanding problem with Sanders. \\nBut others are addressing foreign policy: Rand Paul is right to press: \u201c Will Donald Trump betray voters by hiring John Bolton? \u201d Diana Johnston at CounterPunch wrote: \u201c After the Election: Don\u2019t Panic, Think! \u201d \\nLeft-Right Alliances \\nOne possible opportunity is for progressives to be forging left-right alliances , as Sanders alludes to above. Indeed, the senator\u2019s biographer, Greg Guma, notes that Sanders has done that in the past at times: Sen. Bernie Sanders speaking to one of his large crowds of supporters. (Photo credit: Sanders campaign) \\n\u201cOne unusual aspect of Bernie\u2019s approach in Congress has been to wage congressional battles with people whose stands on other issues he abhors. In fact, much of Bernie\u2019s legislative success has come through forging deals with ideological opposites. An amendment to bar spending in support of defense contractor mergers, for example, was pushed through with the aid of Chris Smith, a prominent opponent of abortion. John Kasich \u2026 helped him phase out risk insurance for foreign investments. \\n\u201cAnd it was a \u2018left-right coalition\u2019 he helped create that derailed \u2018fast track\u2019 legislation on international agreements pushed by Bill Clinton. The power of that strategy may have reached its apex in May 2010 when Bernie\u2019s campaign to bring transparency to the Federal Reserve resulted in a 96-0 Senate vote on his amendment to audit the Fed and conduct a General Accounting Office audit of possible conflicts of interest in loans to unknown banks.\u201d \\nIn fact, if such a right-left approach isn\u2019t followed now, Trump will likely be forging alliances with Ryan and McConnell . In other words, the path ahead for construction policies may be narrow, but it holds the best hope for the next four years. That strategy calls for attacking Trump when he fails his populist promises but working with him when he pursues them. \\nThis approach also would likely strengthen populist elements within the Democratic Party and may lead to a de facto realignment of U.S. politics. It may be less glamorous than resisting and filibustering, which may be needed on some issues, but finding constructive overlaps might actually fix some things that need fixing. \\nLast year, in a piece entitled \u201c In Defence of the Rise of Trump \u201c, I wrote: \\n\u201c[Trump] might pursue the same old establishment policies if he were ever to get into office \u2014 that\u2019s largely what Obama has done, especially on foreign policy. Trump says, \u2018I was a member of the establishment seven months ago.\u2019 \\n\u201cThe point is that the natives are restless. And they should be. It\u2019s an important time to engage them so they stay restless and funnel that energy to constructive use, not demonize or tune them out.\u201d \\nDemonizing Trump supporters has proved disastrous. It\u2019s time for another approach by progressives: engagement. \\nSam Husseini is founder of VotePact.org .'"}, "time": 1742628309.6364837}
