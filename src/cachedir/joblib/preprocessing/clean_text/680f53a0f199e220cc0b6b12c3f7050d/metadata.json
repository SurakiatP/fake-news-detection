Running back LeGarrette Blount, defensive end Chris Long and defensive tackle Alan Branch on Thursday became the latest to announce that they would skip the visit. Long posted on Twitter that he \u201cplanned on skipping\u201d in response to a column in The Daily News that urged him to skip. Blount revealed his decision on Fox Sports in a radio interview on \u201cThe Rich Eisen Show\u201d later in the afternoon. \u201cI just don\u2019t feel welcome in that house,\u201d Blount said. \u201cI\u2019m going to just leave it at that. \u201d Branch told Sirius XM Radio that he planned to spend time with family. A day earlier, the Pro Bowl linebacker Dont\u2019a Hightower bowed out when he told ESPN, \u201cBeen there, done that,\u201d having visited with a championship Alabama team. Tight end Martellus Bennett told reporters after the Super Bowl that he would not go: \u201cIt is what it is,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople know how I feel about it. Just follow me on Twitter. \u201d The outspoken Bennett had joked that he might move to outer space after Donald J. Trump was elected. The Pro Bowl safety Devin McCourty, a team captain,  told Time magazine: \u201cBasic reason for me is I don\u2019t feel accepted in the White House. With the president having so many strong opinions and prejudices, I believe certain people might feel accepted there while others won\u2019t. \u201d Bennett and McCourty were in the news for their activism last fall, when they raised their fists in protest during the national anthem for one game. At the time, athletes in various sports were protesting racial oppression in the country. The number of Patriots absences may well increase. Running back James White said he had not made up his mind whether to go. \u201cI\u2019ll wait till the time comes and decide then,\u201d he said. No date has been scheduled for this year\u2019s ceremony honoring the Patriots. The ceremony for last year\u2019s champions, the Broncos, took place in June. Perhaps no other team has as close an association with Trump as the Patriots. Just before the election, Trump claimed that he had the support of Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and Coach Bill Belichick. Brady, who displayed a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d cap in his locker during the campaign, never explicitly endorsed Trump, but he spoke favorably of him and they have socialized. Trump also cited a supportive letter he had received from Belichick, and several news media accounts confirmed the letter was authentic. The team\u2019s owner, Robert K. Kraft, has said he has considered Trump a longtime friend. Brady did not attend his team\u2019s visit with former President Barack Obama at the White House, in 2015, citing family issues. But some athletes who have skipped the trip over the years have explicitly given politics as a reason. Bruins goalie Tim Thomas declined to visit the Obama White House with his teammates in January 2012, saying in a statement: \u201cI believe the federal government has grown out of control, threatening the rights, liberties and property of the people. \u201cBecause I believe this, today I exercised my right as a free citizen, and did not visit the White House. \u201d Baltimore Ravens center Matt Birk cited his opposition to abortion as the reason for skipping a 2013 visit. A number of other athletes have skipped the ceremony while citing scheduling conflicts or family commitments. Presidents for years have invited sports figures to the White House, but the tradition of honoring championships teams there solidified under Ronald Reagan. Major professional champions and many college champions stop by for a presentation and a photo opportunity. Six Patriots, so far, won\u2019t make the trip this year.'"}, "time": 1742563918.745284}
