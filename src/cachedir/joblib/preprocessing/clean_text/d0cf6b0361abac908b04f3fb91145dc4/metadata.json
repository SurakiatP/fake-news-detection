Some Cities Are Now Pushing For Noncitizen Immigrants TO VOTE shares \\nEvery time Donald Trump suggests the election could be rigged in some way, Democrats and their many media allies scoff and laugh, then accuse Trump of promoting conspiracy theories. \\nAt the same time, the left is trying to steal the election in broad daylight. \\nBloomberg reports: \\nSome Cities Want Their Noncitizen Immigrants to Vote \\n\u201cLook at illegal immigrants voting all over the country,\u201d Donald Trump recently claimed in a Fox News interview, part of his ongoing effort to cast doubt on the integrity of the presidential election. There\u2019s no evidence to support the Republican nominee\u2019s claims of election fraud, but some cities are moving to expand voting rights to include noncitizens. \\nThe latest is San Francisco, where the Nov. 8 ballot will include a measure allowing the parents or legal guardians of any student in the city\u2019s public schools to vote in school board elections. The right would be extended to those with green cards, visas, or no documentation at all. \u201cOne out of three kids in the San Francisco unified school system has a parent who is an immigrant, who is disenfranchised and doesn\u2019t have a voice,\u201d says San Francisco Assemblyman David Chiu, the son of Taiwanese immigrants. \u201cWe\u2019ve had legal immigrants who\u2019ve had children go through the entire K-12 system without having a say.\u201d Undocumented immigrants should also have the right, Chiu adds, to bypass the \u201cbroken immigration system in this country.\u201d \\nNoncitizen voting isn\u2019t as radical as it might sound. For more than half of U.S. history, from 1776 until the 1920s, noncitizens were widely permitted to participate in elections. \u201cWe had 40 states that used to allow it,\u201d says Ron Hayduk, an associate professor of political science at San Francisco State University. \u201cImmigrants could vote, not just in local elections,\u201d he says. \u201cThey could even run for office\u2014and did win office.\u201d The hope, Hayduk says, was that immigrants would feel more invested in civic life if they were able to participate in American democracy. \\nDo you think Democrats would want non-citizens to vote if they tended to vote Republican? \\nOf course not. \\nThe Democrat party is a criminal enterprise and they\u2019ll do whatever they have to do to win. shares '"}, "time": 1742562705.6619735}
