[The report by the New York Times indicates that only 13 percent of San Francisco\u2019s population is under 18 years old.  \u201cSometimes I\u2019ll be walking through the city and I\u2019ll see a child and think, \u2018Hey, wait a second. What are you doing here? \u2019\u201d Courtney Nam, who works downtown at a tech   told the New York Times. \u201cYou don\u2019t really see that many kids. \u201d The combination of   and distance of public schools has resulted in what can be regarded as a mass exodus of families with   kids to cities that are more affordable. The Times notes that the San Francisco has invested millions in upgrading parks, according to Phil Ginsburg, the general manager of the city\u2019s Recreation and Parks Department. San Francisco Chronicle writer and San Francisco resident Amy Graff  \u2014   who is also a mother to three kids  \u2014   relates her own experience in the city: I was elated when one of my dearest friends finally had a baby, but crestfallen when she decided to move to Lafayette before her son started preschool. I\u2019d assumed her son would grow up with my kids. Same thing happened with another best friend who fled for Mill Valley. My heart eventually numbed to the the mass exodus and I now approach new friendships in the way an army brat might at her third high school. I\u2019m eager to meet new people but hesitant to get too close to protect myself from future partings.'"}, "time": 1742628397.8759873}
