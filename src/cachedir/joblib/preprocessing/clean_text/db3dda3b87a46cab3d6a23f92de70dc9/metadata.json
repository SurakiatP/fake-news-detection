This, of course, explains why Clinton held a star studded concert in Philadelphia last night in an attempt to attract audience members who would have otherwise stayed home had Bruce Springsteen not been the real headliner.\\nTrump, on the other hand, continued to fill venues to capacity across the country with miles-long lines and standing room only.\\nAnd though many national and electoral polls have Hillary ahead, the odd mainstream polling data showing a Clinton win despite a massive response from Trump supporters appears to be easily explained by what senior strategist Robert Cahaly of the Trafalgar Group calls the \u201cneighbor ballot test.\u201d\\nIt\u2019s a sign Trump\u2019s share of the vote is being underestimated, Robert Cahaly, senior strategist for the Trafalgar Group of Atlanta that conducted the unorthodox survey, told LifeZette.\\n\u2026\\nCahaly says the \u201cneighbors\u201d numbers back up the \u201cshy Tory\u201d theory \u2014 that respondents are shy about saying they will vote for a candidate or cause that has been tagged as racist or distasteful by the media and popular culture. The most recent case was the British exit from the European Union, or \u201cBrexit,\u201d as it is called.\\nSource: LifeZette \\nAccording to that \u2018neighbor\u2019 ballot test, Trump is destroying Clinton.\\nProvided that the vote counting in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Florida is legitimate and not plagued with illegal or dead voters , it appears that Trump is set to take not just two of these states, but all three of them:\\nPennsylvania \\nClinton: 46.51%\\nTrump: 48.43% \\nJohnson: 2.30%\\nStein: 1.08%\\nOther/Undecided: 1.69%\\n(1300+ Respondents, MOE +/- 2.68)\\nFlorida \\nClinton: 46.13%\\nTrump: 49.72% \\nJohnson: 2.43%\\nStein: 0.62%\\nOther/Undecided: 1.09%\\n(1100+ Respondents, MOE +/- 2.89)\\nMichigan \\nClinton: 46.82%\\nTrump: 48.52% \\nJohnson: 2.89%\\nStein: 0.90%\\nOther/Undecided: 0.87%\\n(1200+ Respondents, MOE +/- 2.77)\\nCommenting on the survey, TFG Senior Strategist Robert Cahaly said, \u201cThough the results vary from state to state, these four surveys have one thing in common: question 2 points to where we think \u2018hidden Trump voters\u2019 are.\u201d\\nCahaly continued, \u201cWe have believed for weeks that the actual Clinton/Trump final numbers will fall between the ballot test and the neighbors ballot test.\u201d\\nCahaly concluded, \u201cWe expect Trump to have an overwhelming victory in Georgia, an outside the margin of error win in Florida, as well as close wins in Pennsylvania and Michigan.\u201d\\nSource: Trafalgar Group Press Release, Nov 7 \\nIn short, one of the reasons that this years polls have been widely skewed from one candidate to the other is that there are a lot of voters out there who have not honestly answered the question of who they will vote for if they are a Trump supporter. This is due in part to the fact that a large swath of Hillary Supporters, and even Clinton herself, have referred to Trump leaning voters as racists, bigots and misogynists. \\nThose \u201cshy\u201d voters will have no such problems inside a private voting booth, which suggests, based on Trafalgar\u2019s survey results, that they will overwhelmingly lean towards Trump in key swing states.\\nIf the vote counting is on the up-and-up, these surveys show a hands-down Trump win.\\nWatch: The 5 States Hillary Must Steal To Win The Election \\n\\nRelated: \u201cTrump Will Be ALLOWED To Win,\u201d Only to Be Blamed For The Coming Financial Crash '"}, "time": 1742562216.362381}
