[\u201cHitler didn\u2019t even sink to the level of using chemical weapons,\u201d Spicer said, trying to express moral outrage for Assad\u2019s use of chemical weapons on his own people. Reporters reacted instantly to Spicer\u2019s remarks on Twitter, pointing out that Hitler gassed millions of Jews during his dictatorship.  As Spicer continued his briefing, ABC News reporter Cecilia Vega asked him to clarify his statement. \u201cI think when you come to sarin gas, he was not using the gas on his own people the same way that Assad is doing,\u201d Spicer replied, adding that he appreciated the opportunity to clarify his statement.
