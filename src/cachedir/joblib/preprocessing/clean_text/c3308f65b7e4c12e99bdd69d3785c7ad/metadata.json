House of Representatives was supposed to vote on Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s Obamacare replacement bill \u2014  the American Health Care Act (AHCA) \u2014  news broke that the vote had again been canceled. [Reporter Bob Costa posted news of the bill\u2019s cancellation:  President Trump just called me. Still on phone. \u201dWe just pulled it,\u201d he tells me.  \u2014   Robert Costa (@costareports) March 24, 2017,  \u201dI don\u2019t blame Paul,\u201d Trump tells me,  \u2014   Robert Costa (@costareports) March 24, 2017,  CNN reported that the bill was pulled at President Donald Trump\u2019s request despite earlier reports that the President wanted a vote \u2014  whether or not the bill had the votes to pass. Later reports indicated it was Ryan who urged Trump that the bill needed to be pulled. It was unclear as of Friday afternoon who was ultimately responsible for the decision to pull the bill. The vote was previously scheduled for Thursday evening, but was canceled within hours of the White House assuring that there would be a vote. Vice President Mike Pence had canceled Friday plans to travel and promote the AHCA in two states to remain in Washington, D. C. and work with the President. White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said Thursday that if the House Leadership\u2019s bill failed, Obamacare would remain, according to several reports. \u201cThere were a lot of emotional pleas last night that might cause people to take off their thinking hats and react with their hearts, rather than their heads, and support what we all know is bad legislation,\u201d Rep. Mo Brooks ( ) said on Friday morning to SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Breitbart News Daily. Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana '"}, "time": 1742562675.1694095}
