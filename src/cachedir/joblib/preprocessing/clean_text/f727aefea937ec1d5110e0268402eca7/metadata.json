On the set of the new ABC series \u201cDesignated Survivor\u201d here earlier this month, he clutched a pack of Camels and walked,   slapping, through a replica of the West Wing, pointing out where the president\u2019s chief of staff sits, running his hand along the curved wall of the Oval Office. In front of a painting of George Washington, he offered this historical nugget: \u201cHe was actually quite handsome but the painter hated him. Unflattering. \u201d Later, while ruminating on President Washington\u2019s dental problems, Mr. Sutherland stood in a hallway with his back to another presidential portrait: his own. The placard beneath read Tom Kirkman. After spending nearly a decade protecting the president on the Fox series \u201c24,\u201d Mr. Sutherland now requires his own detail. On \u201cDesignated Survivor\u201d he plays a   cabinet member who ascends to the Oval Office when Congress is wiped out by an attack during a State of the Union address. The actor leaves behind the   antics of the counterterrorism agent Jack Bauer to play a policy wonk thrust into a job he never wanted. Mr. Sutherland hasn\u2019t exactly disappeared since \u201c24\u201d ended its regular series run in 2010. Among other gigs, he did two \u201c24\u201d  projects, and appeared in   fare, including Lars von Trier\u2019s \u201cMelancholia,\u201d and \u201cForsaken,\u201d a western with his father, Donald Sutherland. And in August, he released his first album, \u201cDown in a Hole,\u201d filled with   country songs that he helped write. He\u2019s been touring extensively, recently appearing at the Grand Ole Opry. But these have mostly been quiet endeavors, at least relative to the cultural noise generated by \u201c24. \u201d Mr. Sutherland\u2019s first network series   the   \u201cTouch\u201d on Fox, failed to find an audience, and was canceled after two seasons. If the public wants a repeat of Mr. Sutherland leading a slick drama that giddily seizes the   political moment, then \u201cDesignated Survivor\u201d  \u2014   a glossy   of political thriller, \u201cThe West Wing\u201d  nation building and domestic drama  \u2014   might be the show that delivers him back to the affections of the mainstream. Mr. Sutherland, 49, sat on a leather couch in the president\u2019s private office  \u2014   slight his arms tattooed prone to long, circular sentences  \u2014   remarking on the difficulty of not appearing too presidential amid such surroundings (even if they are fake). \u201cThe set\u2019s so good that you can\u2019t help standing a little straighter,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s something about how significant that office is. We watched Kennedy\u2019s kids play there, Nixon getting himself out of Watergate. It does have an impact on your performance. \u201d With an   narrative driving this election cycle, Mr. Sutherland\u2019s respectful nostalgia for political office seems surprisingly  . Television politicians these days are mostly venal, their cutthroat egoism wrung for drama on \u201cScandal\u201d and for laughs on \u201cVeep. \u201d \u201cBrainDead,\u201d this summer\u2019s satire from the creators of \u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d targeted elected officials by planting   space bugs in their skulls. But \u201cDesignated Survivor\u201d leans more toward the idealism of \u201cThe West Wing. \u201d David Guggenheim, a   writer known for \u201cSafe House,\u201d had long been intrigued by the concept of the designated survivor, the person in the presidential line of succession selected to wait in a secure, undisclosed location when all other members of government are gathered elsewhere. After his usually encouraging friend Simon Kinberg (a producer of films, including \u201cThe Martian\u201d) expressed little enthusiasm about one of his movie pitches in a   email exchange, Mr. Guggenheim  \u2014   hoping to redeem himself  \u2014   pulled out the designated survivor idea and hit send. Mr. Kinberg loved it, and Mr. Guggenheim wrote the script in two weeks. They took it to Mark Gordon, a veteran producer (\u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d) who immediately envisioned Mr. Sutherland as the lead. \u201cMost actors are known for the thing that made them famous,\u201d Mr. Gordon said. \u201cJack Bauer was active and macho, but Kiefer\u2019s actually such a gentle, gracious guy. He can be the idealized president that we all wish we had. \u201d In Hollywood, an Everyman in the White House is often played for laughs: Chris Rock in \u201cHead of State\u201d Kevin Kline in \u201cDave. \u201d But the \u201cDesignated Survivor\u201d premise  \u2014   an entire government up in flames  \u2014   is   almost shockingly grim. Mr. Guggenheim needed Mr. Sutherland to tilt the story away from tragedy. \u201cWe were killing   people right off the top but I didn\u2019t want the show to live in that darkness,\u201d he said. \u201cI did want Tom to represent optimism. We pointed Kiefer toward \u2018Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. \u2019\u201d The   common sense that drives President Kirkman is, said Mr. Sutherland, a retort to cynics. \u201cThe lack of knowledge and understanding of how difficult it is to govern has led to some very poor ideas in our society,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe showing the rebuilding of a government in action will help dial down the rhetoric that\u2019s out there. \u201d Mr. Sutherland has found himself in the political fray before. \u201c24\u201d made its debut in November 2001 amid intense    anxiety. Jack Bauer\u2019s propensity for grisly torture methods meant \u201c24\u201d was read by some as a revenge fantasy for a grieving country, and eventually criticized by others for wallowing in   violence at a moment where \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d became a national ignominy. \u201cOnce I was in an airport waiting to get on a plane and a woman looked at me and said: \u2018How can you make that   show?\u2019 It\u2019s like: What are you talking about? We had the first   president on TV we had the first female president on TV,\u201d Mr. Sutherland said. \u2018\u2018When Jack Bauer was on his deathbed he didn\u2019t ask for a priest he asked for an imam to apologize. I wish the show hadn\u2019t become so politicized in the end, but I have no regrets. \u201d He may be particularly sensitive to the   label because in Canada he\u2019s considered   royalty. To Americans, he\u2019s known as Donald Sutherland\u2019s son, but to many Canadians, he\u2019s the grandson of Tommy Douglas, the Saskatchewan premier who brought universal health care to Canada and helped form the federal party that would become the   New Democratic Party. As children, Mr. Sutherland and his twin sister, Rachel, spent time in Canada\u2019s parliament in Ottawa. \u201cI remember eating hot dogs in the House of Commons and waiting for my grandpa,\u201d he said. \u201cI loved the debates. \u201d His mother, the actress Shirley Douglas, continued the activist tradition. In 1969, when she was involved with the Black Panther Party, she was arrested in Los Angeles, said Mr. Sutherland, not without pride. Mr. Sutherland\u2019s parents divorced when he was 4, and Ms. Douglas relocated the family to Toronto four years later. The city now passes for his hometown he takes the subway to the suburban set every day, and his mother and sister live here. But as a student Mr. Sutherland attended six schools in five years. He dropped out at 16 when he was cast in the Canadian film \u201cThe Bay Boy,\u201d arriving in Hollywood soon after. The welcome mat was out for   Packers: He roomed with Robert Downey Jr. and rose quickly, landing a string of 1980s hits: \u201cStand By Me,\u201d \u201cLost Boys,\u201d \u201cYoung Guns. \u201d \u201cYou think: \u2018This is great, this is going to be the rest of my life.\u2019 Then somewhere around 30 you get a knock back and realize, \u2018Oh no, you should have held on tight. \u2019\u201d He married and divorced young his daughter, Sarah Sutherland, now 28, plays Julia  \u2019s daughter on \u201cVeep. \u201d The career lull of Mr. Sutherland\u2019s early 30s was followed by \u201c24,\u201d a show that Natascha McElhone had never seen when she signed on to \u201cDesignated Survivor\u201d as first lady. She didn\u2019t know what friends meant when they joked: \u201cJack Bauer becomes president?\u201d \u201cKiefer has large reserves of vulnerability,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s something quite breakable inside, which I think is not just endearing but unusual. He\u2019s also quite a worker bee. \u201d An executive producer on the show, Mr. Sutherland has made suggestions that have been incorporated into it, including having Kirkman wear glasses (for a Clark Kent effect) and making Kirkman an independent (circumventing Republican and Democratic baggage) according to Mr. Guggenheim. For a Canadian with a green card, Mr. Sutherland is oddly smitten with the mythic American West. In the 90s, he had a ranch in Montana, and roped in rodeos, feeding on   country   like Merle Haggard and Johnny Cash. After listening to one of Mr. Sutherland\u2019s early efforts at songwriting, his friend and writing   Jude Cole, encouraged him to record. \u201cI said: \u2018There\u2019s a heartbreaking quality to your voice. No, you\u2019re not this fantastic singer, but there are a lot of smooth singers out there, and there\u2019s not a lot of Kris Kristoffersons,\u2019\u201d Mr. Cole said. An actor who crosses over into music can invite mockery or oblivion, but Mr. Sutherland was willing to take that risk. After years of playing guitar in his trailer, and with Mr. Cole running a music label, Ironworks, he was ready to put his own music out there. \u201cI was prepared for a brutal beating, but the nice thing about finally getting to the age where I\u2019m at is, well, as long as they\u2019re not going to kill me, O. K. \u201d (The reviews have been mostly positive, if begrudging: \u201c  \u2026    actually kind of decent,\u201d read the headline on the A. V. Club\u2019s take.) Loss and drinking are common themes the title track is about a friend who drank himself to death. Mr. Sutherland\u2019s drinking has been a tabloid punch line in the past: In 2005, he hurled himself at a  decorated Christmas tree in a London hotel lobby and a D. U. I. arrest led to a brief jail stint. Yet he seemed ambivalent when asked if his relationship to alcohol had changed. \u201cIt\u2019s been a part of my life, there\u2019s no denying that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not something I do alone. I like going out with friends after work. It\u2019s a way of letting loose. Having said that, I can tell you that if I look back on my life any of the negative things that have happened usually have [drinking] as a root cause, whether it was a D. U. I. or fighting, or a breakup, a relationship not working. There\u2019s a price to pay for it. If you take a look at the songs, none of them are positive. \u201d As an actor, Mr. Sutherland is used to telling other people\u2019s stories. But the album is intensely personal a \u201cjournal,\u201d he has said. The song \u201cCalling Out Your Name\u201d is about his split from Julia Roberts in 1991. Even after decades in the public eye, Mr. Sutherland said he found this level of exposure new, and perhaps liberating. \u201cI would never ordinarily be that confessional, and when I first got onstage, it took me a moment to surrender,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when I did that became one of the great experiences of my life. I\u2019m grateful for how gracious people have been. It\u2019s affected how I approached this part. I could let a bit more of myself into the character. It\u2019s more personal. \u201d Whether this incarnation of Kiefer Sutherland  \u2014   or any  \u2014   can ever eclipse one of the most   roles in television history, only the public will decide.'"}, "time": 1742561911.8760555}
