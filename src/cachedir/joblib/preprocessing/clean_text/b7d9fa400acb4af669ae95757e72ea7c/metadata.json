[New York socialite and philanthropist and Trump family friend Jean Shafiroff, who sits on the Couture Council of The Museum at New York\u2019s Fashion Institute of Technology, took a poll to determine how interested designers were when asked their thoughts on dressing Mrs. Trump.  Shafiroff told the New York Post that Zac Posen, B. Michael America, Victor de Souza, and Zang Toi are among the designers who say they\u2019d be willing to dress the First Lady  . \u201cAny designer who dresses her will get enormous press,\u201d Shafiroff told the outlet. The news comes after several   designers, including Tom Ford and Marc Jacobs, publicly declined to design clothing for Mrs. Trump. \u201c\u2018I have no interest whatsoever in dressing Melania Trump,\u201d Jacobs told WWD in November. Shortly after Trump\u2019s victory in November, designer Sophie Theallet urged her colleagues in the fashion world not to design clothing for or associate with the new First Lady in any way. \u201cThe rhetoric of racism, sexism, and xenophobia unleashed by her husband\u2019s presidential campaign are incompatible with the shared values we live by. I encourage my fellow designers to do the same,\u201d she said. Designer Stefano Gabbana,   of fashion house Dolce  Gabbana, has proudly posted photos on his Instagram of Mrs. Trump wearing his clothing. The photos caused a stir on social media, and Gabbana fired back at critics threatening to boycott his designs. \u201cHow many stupid and ignorant people r on Instagram! !!\u201d Gabbana wrote back in one of several comments taking aim at the negative posters. \u201cPlease if you don\u2019t like my post unfollow me  \u2026     thank you. \u201d Last month, designer Calvin Klein said \u201cof course\u201d he would dress Melania Trump. \u201cShe\u2019s beautiful,\u201d the designer told TMZ.
