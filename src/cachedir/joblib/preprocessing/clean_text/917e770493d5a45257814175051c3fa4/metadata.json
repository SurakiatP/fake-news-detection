Implications? The FBI no longer needs a search warrant to examine the contents of Weiner\u2019s laptop seized in the investigation. \\nAs intelligence agency whisperings have been suggesting for days, We suspect there must be a SMOKING GUN on Weiner\u2019s laptop for the FBI to be forced into reopening the investigation. \\nFor if FBI Director Comey REALLY wanted to conduct a complete investigation including Hillary\u2019s thousands of bleached emails, he would simply contact the NSA and request the results of an X-Keyscore search for the results of the email address [email protected] \\nThe fact that this never happened (despite the fact that the FBI and DOJ assuredly knows of this capability and uses it in the investigation of suspects NOT named Hillary Clinton) indicates to us that the FBI has been forced into this action due to an imminent criminal bombshell regarding Hillary\u2019s emails, likely from an intelligence agency insider.'"}, "time": 1742562030.2567077}
