Coulter slammed the victimhood mentality of liberals, saying victims have become the biggest bullies in the United States. Watch: \u201cVictimhood is like a magical elixir that makes any kind of behavior possible, justifies any kind of overreach or cruelty. It\u2019s like the perfect tool,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cThat was the theme of my book, Guilty, how victims had turned themselves into the aggressors and thereby wonder around creating other victims,\u201d Coulter replied. \u201cVictims are the biggest bullies in the country now. \u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s an attack for Trump just to comment that his    son had seen that disgusting image that wasn\u2019t funny and wasn\u2019t interesting and oh, she was just so smug and thought it was so funny,\u201d she later added.
