[Secretary Carter awarded his boss with the medal on January 4 during the Armed Forces Full Honor Farewell Review for the President held at Conmy Hall, Joint Base   Hall in Virginia.  Carter insisted that the medal was a token of appreciation for Obama\u2019s service as commander in chief, the Associated Press reported. After spending the last few weeks throwing roadblocks in the path of   Donald Trump and his transition team, Obama nonetheless claimed in his remarks to the members of the military in attendance that \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make sure that during this transition period that there is a seamless passing of the baton, that there\u2019s continuity. \u201d Along with the AP, CBS News White House correspondent Mark Knoller also marked the ceremony with a Tweet to his followers.
