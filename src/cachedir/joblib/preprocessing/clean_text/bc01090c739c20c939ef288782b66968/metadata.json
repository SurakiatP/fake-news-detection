[According to the Los Angeles Times, LAPD Chief Charlie Beck said a woman alleged that she woke up to an intruder in her home. She fled out of a window and called police. When officers arrived, the suspect had armed himself, and a   standoff followed. A SWAT team was called in as officers attempted to negotiate with the suspect, but negotiations failed.  Beck said the home was on a hill and was \u201csurrounded by bushes and debris,\u201d making the SWAT team\u2019s job difficult. Moreover, the suspect was using the elevated position to his advantage, shooting at the officers when they got close or came into sight. So the decision was made to bring in the helicopter. Officers then fired tear gas into the home, and the suspect was shot when he ran outside to get away from the gas. He exited the house about 2:45 pm: Officers on the ground and air fired on the suspect simultaneously. The Los Angeles Daily News reported that the man fell under the barrage of fire and \u201ctumbled down a ravine. \u201d He was pronounced dead at the scene. According to KTLA, Chief Beck said \u201can autopsy would reveal how many times the    [suspect] was struck by gunfire\u201d and whether it was from officers on the ground or those in the air.
