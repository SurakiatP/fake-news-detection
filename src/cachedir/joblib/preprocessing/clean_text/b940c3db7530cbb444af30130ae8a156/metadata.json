She was referring not to furniture, but fingernails: the unvarnished ones on the hands of her current   Christine Ebersole. They contrasted markedly with Ms. LuPone\u2019s nails, which she herself had lacquered in shiny maroon, after years observing professional manicurists. \u201cI watch how they depress the fluid,\u201d Ms. LuPone said, pantomiming bottle and brush. \u201cThe problem is, when I put nail polish on it really weakens my nails,\u201d Ms. Ebersole said in a sisterly way. \u201cThey just flake off. \u201d The talons were out, in other words, but this was not a catfight. More a chat \u2019n\u2019 chew between Tony   actresses getting the chance to share a Broadway stage for the first time in \u201cWar Paint,\u201d one of a   new musicals debuting in a mad cram before the season ends. Dressed in a confusion of stretchy black clothing and scarves, the two women were sharing a sofa in the upper half of a sleek duplex at 663 Fifth Avenue, where the flagship of Elizabeth Arden\u2019s signature spa, the Red Door, moved five years ago from the florid former Aeolian Building two blocks north. They had refused treatments and were instead efficiently slurping vegetarian soups. In \u201cWar Paint,\u201d which is now in previews and opens at the Nederlander Theater on April 6, Ms. Ebersole, 64, plays Miss Arden, n\u00e9e Florence Nightingale Graham: the entrepreneur who made cosmetics, long associated with prostitutes, acceptable and desirable to the American middle and upper classes starting in the 1910s. Ms. LuPone, 67, plays Arden\u2019s   but equally esteemed competitor, Helena Rubinstein, who imparted both artistic and clinical prestige to the pursuit of beauty, and who is credited with the phrase \u201cthere are no ugly women, only lazy ones. \u201d Bette Davis vs. Joan Crawford Alexis Colby vs. Krystle Carrington: Female rivalries have long meant boffo box office and Nielsen ratings points. But theatergoers hoping for Ms. Ebersole and Ms. LuPone to whack each other with pocketbooks or hurl drinks like Anne Bancroft and Shirley MacLaine in \u201cThe Turning Point\u201d are due for disappointment. Rather, their characters fight by issuing new products, raiding staff and investing in premium real estate: penthouses and country spreads for Rubinstein, who donated millions of dollars to arts education and other causes through her foundation an Irish castle and Lexington, Ky. breeding stable for Arden, who was passionately devoted to horses and marched with suffragists. \u201cWe should really look at them as role models,\u201d Ms. LuPone said of the two tycoons. \u201cThey were really inspiring,\u201d Ms. Ebersole said. \u201cMy God,\u201d Ms LuPone said. \u201cRegardless of what their personal flaws were, or what drove them  \u2014   nothing that they achieved for themselves and then in the name of woman has ever been matched!\u201d Ms. Ebersole, more gently: \u201cThey paved the way, and started before women had the vote. \u201d Ms. LuPone was incensed by news reports about the departing C. E. O. of Yahoo, Marissa Mayer. \u201cHer male replacement is getting twice as much as she is,\u201d she said. \u201cTwice as much!\u201d The gender pay inequity common in the film industry is not an issue for \u201cWar Paint,\u201d which is capitalized at $11 million and carried by its leading ladies, one or both of whom appear in all but four of the show\u2019s numbers. But the fact that its principal creators are all men might arch an eyebrow. The musical takes its title and basic premise from a dual biography by Lindy Woodhead published in 2004 that a few years later inspired a documentary, \u201cThe Powder  the Glory,\u201d to which David Stone, a producer, was introduced by the director James Lapine. Mr. Stone has had tremendous success with \u201cWicked,\u201d another musical centered on female foes, and, among other projects, worked on \u201cThe Vagina Monologues\u201d by Eve Ensler. He called her for advice before proceeding. \u201cEve said, \u2018This can\u2019t be about makeup.\u2019 And it\u2019s not,\u201d Mr. Stone said. \u201cIt\u2019s about women and beauty and power and how women treat each other. \u201d Mr. Stone and Ms. LuPone both wrinkle their noses at the word \u201cdiva,\u201d a description cribbed from Italian opera that is now often applied to any commanding female presence in the entertainment industry, inevitably also suggesting an excess of temperament. \u201cI just can\u2019t stand it,\u201d Mr. Stone said. \u201cDiva implies difficult. \u201d At a talk about the show a few months ago, Ms. LuPone proposed \u201cdame\u201d as an alternative, to approving whoops from the audience. After securing rights to the material, Mr. Stone hired Michael Greif, with whom he had worked on \u201cNext to Normal\u201d and \u201c\u201d to direct. They brought in the composer Scott Frankel, the lyricist Michael Korie and the book writer Doug Wright, Mr. Greif\u2019s collaborators on the musical \u201cGrey Gardens,\u201d inspired by the Maysles brothers\u2019 cult documentary about the eccentric aristocrats \u201cBig Edie\u201d Beale and her daughter, \u201cLittle Edie. \u201d Some early workshops of \u201cWar Paint\u201d featured Donna Murphy in the Arden role but she withdrew for family reasons, and Ms. Ebersole, who had won a 2007 Tony for portraying both Beales at different stages of their lives, assumed the part. She and Ms. LuPone, for whom this is the first musical since the   \u201cWomen on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown\u201d (2010) were not shy about participating in the creative process. \u201cBoth of them were very excited to play against the obvious  \u2014   feuding,    stars and that kind of energy  \u2014   and actually find ways where the competition between them was nourishing,\u201d Mr. Frankel said a few hours before curtain on a recent evening. \u201cThese women were enormously sophisticated and tasteful and   in corporate weaponry,\u201d Mr. Wright said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have to reduce things to an insult they could actually wage business warfare against one another and did so very effectively for 50 years. \u201d Anything \u201cthat felt cheap or easy,\u201d he said, the actresses \u201cinstantly rejected. \u201d Criticism of an    tryout in Chicago last summer focused on relentless   between its two subjects, who supposedly never met in real life. About a third of the show has been revised, the creators said, both to fortify the solo appearances and to find novel ways of bringing the characters together onstage. \u201cThere was some tightening,\u201d Mr. Frankel said, slipping into   patois. \u201cBecause it\u2019s the two of them, there\u2019s a little bit of inherent    that\u2019s intrinsic in the proposition of the evening, but I think we tried to find ways to mix that up in more unexpected ways. \u201d He and his colleagues were adamant that \u201cWar Paint\u201d is not purely ladies\u2019 entertainment, though the Broadway audience is disproportionately female, a demographic that has helped make shows like \u201cWaitress\u201d into hits. \u201cThere are metaphors inherent in the idea of makeup that I think transcend gender,\u201d Mr. Wright said. \u201cIt offers a potential mask where you can pretend to be someone you aren\u2019t it offers a disguise if you don\u2019t wish to be recognized it offers an avenue toward a certain kind of perceived   it is a kind of lure to attract someone else. \u201d But with its   costume changes designed by Catherine Zuber, including   hats and piles of glittering jewelry, and makeup by Angelina Avallone, \u201cWar Paint\u201d has been an occasion for the two stars to reflect on how cosmetics and other trappings have been integral to their long careers. \u201cOnce I put on the wig it\u2019s like \u2018O. K. badda bing, badda boom,\u2019\u201d Ms. LuPone said. \u201cI\u2019m not the type of actress that goes into a corner and meditates for 20 minutes on the bones of Helena Rubinstein. Do you know what I mean?\u201d Ms. Ebersole said that for performers backstage as well as for many people in real life, \u201cputting on makeup is a really great centering device. It\u2019s a way of having you focus on what you\u2019re doing. As you put on the mask, then the other things come through. \u201d She recalled her work in the 2001 revival of \u201c42nd Street,\u201d for which she won her first Tony with the help of 1930s regalia by Roger Kirk: \u201cThe costumes just informed everything. \u201d This inspired Ms. LuPone to reminisce about \u201cEvita,\u201d for which she got her first Tony, at 31. \u201cThe amount of  \u2014   for lack of a better word  \u2014   gack that we\u2019re putting on!\u201d she said. \u201cI also harken back to that time in \u2018Anything Goes\u2019 when I was in those   gowns. Oy, I can\u2019t wear a   gown now to save my life, unless I\u2019m strapped in. \u201d The two actresses were \u201cbabies in the city together,\u201d as Ms. LuPone put it. She arrived in 1968 to attend Juilliard, where she studied with Marian Seldes, having known she wanted to perform since she was 4, standing downstage right in a tap recital. Ms. Ebersole, who had gone to MacMurray College in Jacksonville, Ill. before enrolling at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in 1973, had had other plans. \u201cI was going to be a nurse,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course you were,\u201d Ms. LuPone said. \u201cLook at her!\u201d Instead Ms. Ebersole served customers at the Lion\u2019s Rock, a restaurant on the Upper East Side with water splashing down a   slab of red granite. \u201cIt\u2019s condominiums now, I think,\u201d she said. Ms. LuPone, meanwhile, worked at a \u201cwannabe mobster\u201d hangout run by a man who imported cages for dancing girls in nightclubs. \u201cMy roommate was one of the dancers, and I wasn\u2019t pretty enough, tall enough or thin enough to be a dancer, so I was a waitress in a   lace \u201d she said. Both women bemoaned a lost era when actors (and stagehands) were recognized and welcomed in the theater district at places like Jimmy Ray\u2019s and Charlie O. \u2019s, and spent time after the show socializing rather than cultivating followings on Twitter and YouTube. \u201cI think we have fewer showmen,\u201d Ms. LuPone said. \u201cLike the Irving Thalbergs and the Alex Cohens and the Robert Whiteheads and the people that loved the theater or loved making movies. It\u2019s such a clich\u00e9, but it\u2019s all bean counters. It\u2019s statistics. Polling. \u201d This was a reminder that the unexpected foil in the   showdown was Charles Revson, the founder of Revlon, rendered in \u201cWar Paint\u201d by Erik Liberman as \u201ca   carnival barker in an Italian suit. \u201d It\u2019s a line that for some involved with the production took on new resonance after Donald J. Trump defeated Hillary Clinton. Overnight, in their view, the musical went from celebration to cautionary tale. After Rubinstein died in 1965, Revson bought her Park Avenue triplex. But that wasn\u2019t the final indignity. Last year, the company he founded, which had brought sex back into the midcentury cosmetics marketplace with suggestive ad copy and flashy layouts, took over Elizabeth Arden. \u201cEverybody\u2019s rolling over in their grave!\u201d Ms. LuPone said. Not that any of these brands make her particularly nostalgic. \u201cI used to be a Georgette Klinger girl. For years,\u201d she said, after the two women packed up a gift of exfoliating face pads and descended nine floors to the lobby. \u201cOh my gosh, Georgette Klinger, I completely forgot that name,\u201d Ms. Ebersole said, blinking her blue eyes on the sunny sidewalk. \u201cThat was a salon,\u201d Ms. LuPone said. \u201cYou\u2019d go in, and close the door, and they were all about getting into your face. They don\u2019t get into your face anymore. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562763.8170624}
