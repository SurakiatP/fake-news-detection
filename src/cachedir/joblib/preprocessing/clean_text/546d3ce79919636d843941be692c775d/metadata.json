So, based on past events, I thought I\u2019d predict how it would pan out on social media. [1. Be offended by something @KTHopkins or @TRobinsonNewEra said on Twitter. 2. Candles, we\u2019ll stay strong etc. 3. Pretend it never happened,  \u2014   James Delingpole (@JamesDelingpole) May 23, 2017,   I really didn\u2019t have to wait long for the first part of my prediction to come true. Block Katie Hopkins, block Tommy Robinson, block Prison Planet. Deactivate Twitter if you have to. You don\u2019t have to engage with this today.  \u2014   Jonathan Fisher (@fishplums) May 23, 2017,  Is Katie Hopkins a paid ISIS propagandist do you reckon or does she just do it as a hobby,  \u2014   Abi Wilkinson (@AbiWilks) May 23, 2017,  @KTHopkins Surely social services need to rescue the psychologically at risk children of vile Nazi Katie Hopkins?  \u2014   Bill Dawson (@DampDogBill) May 23, 2017,  Tommy Robinson, Katie Hopkins, Nick Griffin  co all abusing the heartbreaking atrocity of last night as a PR stunt. Utter parasites.  \u2014   Chris Dolan (@cdolan8) May 23, 2017,  Katie Hopkins  \u2014   Trending. The Sun  \u2014   Trending. Tommy Robinson  \u2014   Trending, The fucking ghouls are out. Profiting from misery.  \u2014   R Evans (@Mativenko80) May 23, 2017,  The white community really needs to do more to root out fundamentalism like that Apprentice woman, Tommy Robinson and UKIP racists,  \u2014   hardeep singh kohli (@misterhsk) May 23, 2017,  Let\u2019s pause to consider what\u2019s going on here. Right now in the morgues of Manchester\u2019s hospitals are the dismembered remains of beautiful children like   old Georgina Callandar.

(@DailyMailUK) May 23, 2017,  \u2019We don\u2019t know where she is!\u2019 Devastated parents release photos to find missing children https:  .  pic. twitter.   \u2014   Daily Express (@Daily_Express) May 23, 2017,  They were so looking forward to seeing Ariana Grande with their friends or their mums and dads or brothers and sisters. They were so happy as they headed for their homes afterwards  \u2014   but some of them never made it. A Muslim suicide bomber killed them in the belief that his religion ordained it, that it would speed his journey to paradise, and that this was the kind of thing he and his brethren should carry on doing until the whole world submits to Islam. Now you\u2019ll note that at no stage was Katie Hopkins  \u2014   or indeed any other spokesman for conservative causes  \u2014   involved in the planning or execution of this atrocity. You\u2019ll also be well aware  \u2014   if you\u2019ve read round the subject  \u2014   that nothing Katie Hopkins or anyone else says or does is going to stop these things happenings. As Islamic State, the main force behind this wave of violence, make perfectly clear in their literature, they\u2019re going to keep on hating us whatever we do. The fact is, even if you were to stop bombing us, imprisoning us, torturing us, vilifying us, and usurping our lands, we would continue to hate you because our primary reason for hating you will not cease to exist until you embrace Islam. Even if you were to pay jizyah and live under the authority of Islam in humiliation, we would continue to hate you. No doubt, we would stop fighting you then as we would stop fighting any disbelievers who enter into a covenant with us, but we would not stop hating you  \u2026    The gist of the matter is that there is indeed a rhyme to our terrorism, warfare, ruthlessness, and brutality. You might have hoped after London, Mumbai, Boston, Paris, Nice, Berlin, and Stockholm that the message would have begun to filter through by now: that we\u2019ve got the watches, but they\u2019ve got the time and that they\u2019re planning on continuing till they\u2019ve won. So why, every time, without fail, do we get the same achingly predictable response on social media from the useful idiots of the progressive left? Why do they insist on focusing their rage on people like Katie Hopkins when clearly this has nothing whatsoever to do with people like Katie Hopkins?'"}, "time": 1742628586.1253023}
