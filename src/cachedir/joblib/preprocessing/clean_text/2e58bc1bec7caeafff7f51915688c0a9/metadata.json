Dyer reports that President Obama claimed back in March of 2015 that he found out about former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s private, unsecured email server the same way other Americans found out \u2014\u201c through news reports .\u201d But WikiLeaks has released emails hacked from the account of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta, that proved otherwise and may point to a big reason why the FBI let Clinton off the hook. \\n\u201cThey know POTUS and HRC emailed,\u201d Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton\u2019s communications director, wrote in a March 2015 email approximately a month before Clinton announced her presidential run. \\n\u201cJosh has been asked about that,\u201d Palmieri continued, in reference to Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. \\n\u201cStandard practice is not to confirm anything about his email, so his answer to press was that he would not comment/confirm,\u201d Palmieri wrote. \u201cI recollect that Josh was also asked if POTUS ever noticed her personal email account and he said something like POTUS likely had better things to do than focus on his Cabinet\u2019s email addresses.\u201d \\nBetter things to do, like golfing? Drawing red lines in the sand? Even if Obama had \u201cbetter things to do,\u201d someone should have been concerned about cyber security and the fact that the secretary of state was using a private server. \\nIn the email exchange, Palmieri was discussing Obama\u2019s CBS statement with Clinton aide Phillippe Reines who suggested that they should warn the White House about the likelihood that Obama\u2019s statement to CBS would fall apart under scrutiny. \\n\u201cOne of us should connect with the WH just so they know that the email will show his statement to not make sense,\u201d Reines wrote. \u201cI\u2019m happy to do so to Josh Earnest since Jen is in a weird position, unless Cheryl or John you want to (or already have) with someone else. But it\u2019s not unreasonable to assume that Josh is going to get asked how this was possible, and he should have the factset.\u201d \\n\u201cEspecially if it\u2019s some weird technical thing with the President\u2019s email setup that he doesn\u2019t see addresses,\u201d Reines wrote. \\nSome \u201cweird technical thing?\u201d Must have been the Russians\u2019 fault, eh? The FBI found out, during their investigation of Clinton\u2019s use of private servers run out of her New York home, that Obama used a pseudonym to email Clinton on her home brew server. That\u2019s a big fat lie as part of a massive coverup, not some \u201cweird technical thing.\u201d \\nIn another March 2015 email released by WikiLeaks, Podesta asked Clinton lawyer Cheryl Mills about emails between POTUS and Clinton: \u201cThink we should hold emails to and from potus?\u201d \\n\u201cThat\u2019s the heart of his exec privilege. We could get them to ask for that. They may not care, but I seems like they will,\u201d Podesta wrote. \\nWell, this revelation may have been a big reason why the Obama administration let Clinton off the hook \u2014 Obama himself was in on it.'"}, "time": 1742562023.9475546}
