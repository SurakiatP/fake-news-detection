Most analysts had expected \u201cRogue One\u201d (Disney) to easily repeat as the No. 1 multiplex attraction. The \u201cStar Wars\u201d spinoff has now collected about $477. 3 million over four weeks. Overseas, it has taken in another $437 million. But in its first weekend in wide release \u201cHidden Figures\u201d (20th Century Fox) about unsung black heroines in the NASA space race of the 1960s, was lifted by strong reviews, an aggressive   marketing campaign that included a   appeal to faith audiences, and attention on Hollywood\u2019s annual awards circuit. Fox said \u201cHidden Figures,\u201d directed by Theodore Melfi and starring Octavia Spencer, Taraji P. Henson and Janelle Mon\u00e1e, did particularly well in San Francisco, Washington, Chicago and Cleveland. Produced by Chernin Entertainment and Levantine Films for about $25 million, after accounting for tax credits, \u201cHidden Figures\u201d received an   grade from ticket buyers in CinemaScore exit polls. The movie was most popular with women (64 percent of the audience) and people over the age of 35 (about 56 percent of attendees). The animated musical \u201cSing\u201d (Universal) was next in line, taking in about $20 million, for a   domestic total of $213. 4 million. The weekend\u2019s other new   movie, \u201cUnderworld: Blood Wars\u201d (Sony) only managed $13 million in ticket sales, or nearly 50 percent less than the initial results for its 2012 franchise predecessor. Sony noted that \u201cBlood Wars\u201d also cost half as much to make  \u2014   about $35 million  \u2014   and has already taken in $45 million overseas. Sony also blamed winter storms in the Eastern United States for decreasing turnout. Among specialty releases: \u201cManchester by the Sea\u201d (Roadside Attractions) sold about $2. 5 million in tickets in 1, 054 theaters, lifting its total to $34 million \u201cPatriots Day\u201d (CBS Films and Lionsgate) about the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, had $105, 000 in seven locations, ahead of its nationwide release on Friday.'"}, "time": 1742628368.2418542}
