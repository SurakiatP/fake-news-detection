[\u201cThe Arctic Council, which recently celebrated its 20th anniversary, has proven to be an indispensable forum in which we can pursue cooperation,\u201d Tillerson said in remarks to the council. \u201cI want to affirm that the United States will continue to be an active member in this council. \u201d  \u201cForeign ministers of the eight Arctic States signed the third binding agreement negotiated under the auspices of the Arctic Council, the \u2018Agreement on Enhancing International Arctic Scientific Cooperation,\u2019 which will help to facilitate entry and exit of persons, equipment, and material access to research infrastructure and facilities access to research areas the use of traditional and local knowledge and education, career development, and training opportunities for students and   scientists,\u201d the council press release said. The ministers, including Tillerson, also signed the Fairbanks Declaration, which states, in part: Reaffirming our commitment to the   of the inhabitants of the Arctic, to sustainable development and to the protection of the Arctic environment, Recognizing the rights of Arctic indigenous peoples and the unique role of the Permanent Participants within the Arctic Council, as well as the commitment to consult and cooperate in good faith with Arctic indigenous peoples and to support their meaningful engagement in Arctic Council activities, Acknowledging the contributions of local authorities, and the interests of all Arctic residents and communities in the work of the Arctic Council, Further recognizing that activities taking place outside the Arctic region, including activities occurring in Arctic States, are the main contributors to climate change effects and pollution in the Arctic, and underlining the need for action at all levels, Noting with concern that the Arctic is warming at more than twice the rate of the global average, resulting in widespread social, environmental, and economic impacts in the Arctic and worldwide, and the pressing and increasing need for mitigation and adaptation actions and to strengthen resilience, Noting the entry into force of the Paris Agreement on climate change and its implementation, and reiterating the need for global action to reduce both   greenhouse gases and   climate pollutants. The White House has not taken an official position yet as to whether it will stick with the Paris Agreement or withdraw, and Tillerson did not comment directly on the matter while in Alaska, the New York Times reported, despite his signing the document in favor of it. \u201cNo decision is imminent, and in his remarks on Thursday, Mr. Tillerson presented the delay as necessary to gain the viewpoints of parties outside the White House and even outside the United States, including the other Arctic nations,\u201d The Times reported. \u201cWe are taking time to understand your concerns,\u201d Tillerson told the members of the council, which in addition to the U. S. is comprised of Canada, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, and Russia. \u201cBut we\u2019re not going to rush,\u201d Tillerson said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to work to make the right decision for the United States. \u201d \u201cThe council members approved, with little fuss, an agreement on scientific cooperation in the region,\u201d The Times reported. \u201cBut the meeting\u2019s closing statement, known as the Fairbanks Declaration, had been the subject of a flurry of   negotiations on Wednesday. \u201d \u201cWe came here to Fairbanks believing that the declaration language was agreed,\u201d Rene Soderman, the senior Arctic official for Finland, said, noting that the U. S. objected to some language, but that the overall council prevailed in its efforts. \u201cWe were able to push the U. S. back as much as possible,\u201d Soderman said. \u201cAnd they were able to go back as much as possible. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a decent declaration and contains all the essential issues for all the eight countries,\u201d Soderman said. Protesters were on hand at the venue chanting   slogans, The Times reported, noting Tillerson\u2019s previous job as CEO of ExxonMobil. Terry Chapin, a climate scientist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, was one of the protesters who is critical of the council\u2019s need for unanimous decisions on matters. \u201cThey\u2019re constrained in the action they can take because they depend on the consensus from participating countries,\u201d Chapin said. \u201cSo if the United States is not going to provide consensus on the climate action that\u2019s needed, their hands are tied. \u201cI think we really need to speak to people like Tillerson to say that this is the kind of action that\u2019s needed,\u201d Chapin said. \u201cWhile the council only has the power to issue advisories, the language in the statement signed by Tillerson comes in stark contrast to statements and promises made by President Trump about climate change,\u201d ABC reported, noting at the same time that Tillerson \u201cendorsed\u201d the Fairbanks Declaration. The Associated Press describes the Arctic Council as \u201can advisory body that promotes cooperation among member nations and indigenous groups,\u201d and a \u201cfocus is sustainable development and environmental protection of the Arctic. \u201d \u201cIt does not make policy or allocate resources, and its decisions must be unanimous,\u201d according to AP. The gathering marked the end of the   U. S. chairmanship of the council, which was passed on to Finland.'"}, "time": 1742564303.4915383}
