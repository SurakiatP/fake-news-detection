WikiLeaks has a long-standing policy of not commenting on sources , so even such a denial is highly unusual. \\nAssange insisted however that it was necessary to deny the claims, saying that Hillary Clinton\u2019s camp \u201chas been able to project a neo-McCarthyist hysteria\u201d with false claims that Russia\u2019s government in behind the hacked emails as part of a plot to rig next week\u2019s election. \\nRussia has long denied being involved in the hacking, but the Clinton campaign has run heavily on the issue, accusing Republican candidate Donald Trump of being a \u201cpuppet\u201d of the Russian government, who they are trying to install by leaking embarrassing emails. \\nThe campaign\u2019s allegations have so far been pretty effective at limiting media coverage of the content of the leaks, with a lot more attention going to the speculation that Russia is plotting to \u201chack the vote\u201d for Trump. Whether Assange\u2019s straightforward denial is sufficient to bring the focus back to content remains to be seen, though the Democratic campaign is unlikely to give up what has been materially their main talking point over the past several months just because the facts don\u2019t support it.
