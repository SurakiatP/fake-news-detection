[Caddell said the hypocrisy of many Democrats reacting to the Comey firing is \u201cenough to choke a horse. \u201d He pointed out how many, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, are already on record as having no confidence in Comey.  \u201cThe notion that this is somehow relatable, or even comparable to what I was actually here for, which was what happened in the \u2018Saturday Night Massacre,\u2019 that\u2019s when we jumped the shark, politically,\u201d said Caddell. Added Caddell, \u201cThe atmospherics going on, which I must say are really remarkable, the number of people who wanted Comey gone on the Democratic side, including Chuck Schumer, who announced that this was the end of the world once again confirmed for me the hypocrisy here is enough to choke a horse. \u201d Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern. '"}, "time": 1742561849.0870805}
