As White House spokesman Josh Earnest stated: \u201cPresident Obama doesn\u2019t think Comey is trying to influence the election.\u201d \\nSenate minority leader Harry Reid claiming Comey may have violated federal law\u2026 \\n\u201cI am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the Hatch Act,\u201d Reid wrote in a letter to Comey, according to the Wall Street Journal. \\nThe Hatch act prohibits government officials from using their positions to influence an election. \\n\u201cThrough your partisan actions, you may have broken the law.\u201d \\n\u201cWhen Republicans filibustered your nomination and delayed your confirmation longer than any previous nominee to your position, I led the fight to get you confirmed because I believed you to be a principled public servant,\u201d Reid wrote. \\n\u201cWith the deepest regret, I now see that I was wrong.\u201d \\nBut, President Obama has now crushed that narrative: \\nJohn Earnest explains: \\n\u201cPresident Obama doesn\u2019t think Comey tried to influence the election.\u201d \\n\u201cObama still believes Comey has \u201cgood character\u201d\u201d \\n\u201cObama has a lot of confidence in AG Loretta Lynch\u201d \\nWhich, roughly translated into images is this\u2026 \\n\\nFurthermore, as we noted last night , Harry Reid had suggested that \u201d talked w/ top NatSec officials who say that Comey \u201cpossesses explosive information\u201d about Trump\u2019s ties to Russia.\u201d \\nThat has also been completely rebuffed as The White House says it \u201chas not been briefed on the existence of any FBI investigation on activities, habts of Donald Trump.\u201d \\nSo more lies?!'"}, "time": 1742562124.030764}
