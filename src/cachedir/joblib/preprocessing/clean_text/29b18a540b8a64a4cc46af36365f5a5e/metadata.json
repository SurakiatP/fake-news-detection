The big \u2019n\u2019 red mark plopped next to my serifed-up name like a trout on the counter? We put that logo out, and you people laughed. Oh, how you laughed. \u201cHey, looks like ol\u2019 Wonder Bread Jeb\u2019s trying to squeeze some enthusiasm out of his limp little campaign!\u201d You think I didn\u2019t hear you? You think I didn\u2019t see what you wrote? Of course I did. The taunts, the memes, the novelty Twitter handles, typed with a sneer. I saw all of it, and it hurt me. It hurt Jeb. \\nYou turned me and my exclamation mark into a big dippy joke, and look what it got you. Dread. Defeat. Humiliation. Feel that despair in your gut today, and now imagine if you had \u201cJEB!\u201d in your life right now, splashed across every TV and touchscreen. Hey, there\u2019s some punctuation that\u2019d put pep in your step! But nope, the guy who sticks his neck out to make electoral politics just a keystroke more exciting gets ribbed, roasted, raked over the coals, and hung out to dry. \\nLook, I wasn\u2019t a perfect candidate. I know that. But that doesn\u2019t mean you had to steer this country straight into a xenophobic hellhole. \\nThat exclamation point was plain fun. It stood out from the pack. It even looked nice on a T-shirt or a coozy. You made a huge mistake the moment you collectively decided to rip my exclamation point to shreds. \\nI was up all night coming up with it, you know. That \u201c!\u201d was a John Ellis Bush original. I\u2019d already tried out a question mark (too uncertain), an ellipsis (too ambiguous), even two exclamation points (too forceful), so when I hit on the idea of an exclamation point I really thought I had something special. I was so excited to share my excitement with you. Turns out I might as well have slapped my thick, pink matte dick into my hand and waggled it all over Facebook Live like a dang date palm frond, for all the love you gave me. \\nLook, I wasn\u2019t a perfect candidate. I know that. But that doesn\u2019t mean you had to steer this country straight into a xenophobic hellhole. All you had to do was be nice about that exclamation point for a few months. But you couldn\u2019t leave it alone, could you? You just could not resist having a good, old laugh! Well, take a look around and tell me what you see. A divided nation headed for the falls with a dipshit at the helm, belting out one last drunken shanty before it all goes to chunks and splinters. You bullies deserve it all. \\nGoodbye, America. I would have been delightful.'"}, "time": 1742562551.3733933}
