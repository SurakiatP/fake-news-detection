{"duration": 1.4597575664520264, "input_args": {"text": "'There were so many instant internet spoofs making fun of Kellyanne Conway\u2019s   \u201cBowling Green Massacre\u201d that it\u2019s hard to pick a favorite. Gun to my head, I\u2019d say mine was the Twitter meme that showed a brass plaque dedicated to the names of the poor souls left for dead on Bowling Green\u2019s grassy killing field. It was blank. That\u2019s because there was no massacre there. No one died. No one even stubbed a toe. But there\u2019s a good chance you know that by now: that the supposed terrorist attack in Bowling Green, Ky. that Ms. Conway, a top presidential adviser, invoked on MSNBC last week to justify President Trump\u2019s contentious travel ban never happened. (And, no, the reason you had never heard of it was not because the Dishonest Media ignored the alleged carnage at the time of its   as Ms. Conway alleged.) The very fact that you probably know all this means that the \u201cBowling Green Massacre\u201d may go down in the record of the Trump presidency as the first break in the \u201cfake news\u201d clouds that have cast such gloom over our fair and once (relatively) true republic. The same internet that enabled false stories to run unchecked through news feeds during the election year dispatched new white blood cells that attacked Ms. Conway\u2019s \u201calternate facts\u201d with \u201ctrue facts\u201d (a redundant term that I guess we\u2019re stuck with for now). Their most effective attack was traditional reporting, in many cases from news organizations that have doubled down on   joined by newfangled memes that accentuate the truth. The Massacre That Wasn\u2019t showed that while Facebook, Google and Twitter take steps to combat nefarious hoaxes, they are already playing host to an organic correction movement led by ordinary users who are crowdsourcing reality. It\u2019s early. Vigilance, and continuing improvements throughout the news business, remain necessary. But the tale of the \u201cmassacre\u201d could be the start of something new. Ms. Conway\u2019s mention of the supposed attack  \u2014   she was trying to justify Mr. Trump\u2019s order that closed the border to citizens from seven predominately Muslim countries  \u2014   slipped past the MSNBC host interviewing her, Chris Matthews. The corrective story broke the way stories have broken since God invented newspapers: A guy walked into a bar. In this case, the guy was Joe Sonka, a staff writer for the Insider Louisville website. He was having a beer at a bar called the Backdoor when \u201csomeone texted me that Conway said something insane,\u201d Mr. Sonka told me. As a reporter  \u2014   and onetime liberal blogger  \u2014   in Kentucky for several years, Mr. Sonka knew what Ms. Conway seemed to be referring to when he went home to check it out. In 2011, the federal authorities arrested two Iraqi refugees who were later given prison sentences  \u2014   one for life and one for 40 years  \u2014   for plotting to send money and weapons to Al Qaeda in Iraq from their new homes in Bowling Green. The episode led to a slowdown in Iraqi immigration as the Obama administration reworked vetting procedures. The authorities never charged the men  \u2014   one of whose fingerprints turned up on a roadside bomb in Iraq  \u2014   with planning an attack on American soil. So at 9:34 p. m. on Thursday, Mr. Sonka wrote on Twitter: \u201c@KellyannePolls says that 2 Iraqi refugees \u2018were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre.\u2019 (There was no such massacre. )\u201d It made like a Trump tweet and roared through the broader news media sphere. \u201cThat tweet got 2. 4 million impressions,\u201d Mr. Sonka said. \u201cPretty crazy. \u201d There was fast   by Vox, The Washington Post, CNN and Fox News (among many others) on conservative websites including Newsmax and Breitbart and, finally, in multiple references on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d  \u2014   the ultimate sign that something has truly broken through. In the end, social media and journalistic scrutiny aligned with comedy to right a wrong pretty definitively. That it happened so organically showed that false \u201cfacts\u201d might not always be the stubborn things so many people fear they are becoming. To understand how deep those fears go, just look at how \u201c1984,\u201d by George Orwell, has climbed up the   lists nearly 70 years after its debut. A \u201c1984\u201d stage adaptation is even heading to Broadway. (How about a Hamiltonesque musical: \u201c2 and 2 make 5? Don\u2019t give me that jive! \u201d) As the New York Times book critic Michiko Kakutani put it recently, Orwell\u2019s classic seems \u201call too familiar,\u201d capturing \u201ca world in which the government insists that reality is not \u2018something objective, external, existing in its own right. \u2019\u201d Mr. Trump renews those fears every time he taps out social media messages like one he posted on Facebook on Thursday complimenting an article about a \u201c \u201d travel ban Kuwait was imposing on five nearby countries. As it happens, this was untrue, as even Sputnik International, the Russian   news service that  helped promote the story, acknowledged. Then there are the regular Trump Tweets calling CNN or The Times \u201cfake news. \u201d The Bowling Green episode made such a splash because it played directly into concerns that the Trump administration would use untrue assertions to rally support for its agenda while denigrating as \u201cdishonest\u201d all the valid reporting pointing out the falsehoods. But even before the Bowling Green story fell apart so spectacularly, there were signs that what had worked well during the presidential campaign last year might not succeed when it comes to the   work of government. All the accusations of \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201cdishonest media\u201d couldn\u2019t erase images of crying relatives stranded at airports  \u2014   or the reporting on the legal questions surrounding Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration order that led a judge to temporarily suspend it. No one in the administration could disappear the readouts from the president\u2019s tense call with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia leaked to The Washington Post. Nor could they reverse the effects of the reporting, some of it in The Times, about the potential business conflicts of his Army secretary nominee, Vincent Viola, who withdrew his name Friday night because of them. Ditto for the blowback over the whole Bowling Green yarn. Ms. Conway went on to admit her error, first on Twitter (where else?) and later in an interview with Howard Kurtz of Fox News, saying it was overblown because \u201cI misspoke one word. \u201d (By that, she meant, apparently, that she should have said \u201cBowling Green terrorists\u201d rather than \u201cBowling Green massacre. \u201d) And Ms. Conway was right when she wrote that \u201chonest mistakes abound. \u201d After all, The Washington Post admitted over the weekend that several details in a column about internal White House strife over the president\u2019s executive order on immigration were in dispute. A few days before that,   of Detroit walked back a report about a woman who died in Iraq supposedly after Mr. Trump\u2019s new policy blocked her entry to the United States. Yet by the end of the weekend, it was Ms. Conway\u2019s credibility that was receiving the most scrutiny (which she described as unfair and coming from \u201ca lot of the haters\u201d in her interview with Mr. Kurtz). Some, like the New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen, were calling upon the television networks to stop booking her. And CNN declined to have her as a guest on Sunday  \u2014   in part because the Trump administration offered her in lieu of Vice President Mike Pence, but also because of what the network told me were \u201cserious questions about her credibility. \u201d It would be a positive development if Ms. Conway embraced the idea that the term \u201chonest mistakes\u201d can apply to reporters, too, as it would be if everybody  \u2014   including journalists  \u2014   doubly committed to getting the facts right, without hysteria or misfires. Too optimistic? Well, if you had asked me a few days ago what I was planning to write about, I wouldn\u2019t have said it would involve praising Twitter for keeping the national debate    \u2014   and fun. Eventually, the Bowling Green memes led to mock street memorials with signs like \u201cNever Remember. \u201d They had made it IRL, or \u201cIn Real Life,\u201d which, the new administration is learning, has a way of sneaking up on you.'"}, "time": 1742562373.6303499}
