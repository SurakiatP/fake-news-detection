Trump continues his victory tour with a rally in Fayetteville, N. C. (7 p. m. Eastern). Earlier in the day, he fired the son of his designated national security adviser for sharing a fake news story about Hillary Clinton that led to an armed confrontation in a pizza restaurant. And Mr. Trump, who has for years flown in a jet bearing his name, proposed canceling a pending order for a new Air Force One, criticizing Boeing in a tweet that said \u201ccosts are out of control. \u201d _____ 2. President Obama took Air Force One to Tampa, Fla. where he delivered his final planned address on national security. The venue, MacDill Air Force Base, is home to units crucial to Mr. Obama\u2019s fight against terrorism as well as efforts to wind down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The diminishing United States presence in Afghanistan offers yet more room for Saudi Arabia, which has supported the American mission there while also turning a blind eye to wealthy residents privately funding the Taliban. _____ 3. Mr. Trump has stirred controversy with foreign governments. His unorthodox phone call with the leader of Taiwan appears to be the culmination of months of effort by Bob Dole, above, who acted as a foreign agent for the country\u2019s government. His lobbying firm was paid $140, 000 for the work. In Iran, President Hassan Rouhani said that his country would not allow Mr. Trump to tear up last year\u2019s nuclear agreement. \u201cAmerica is our enemy we have no doubt about this,\u201d he said, taking a harsh tone that signaled the intense pressure he is under from  . _____ 4. The man who admitted to shooting the former N. F. L. player Joe McKnight last Thursday has been arrested and charged with manslaughter. The authorities had been deluged with criticism and insults for releasing Ronald Gasser, above, after what appeared to be an episode of road rage. In a news conference, Sheriff Newell Normand angrily rejected the idea his officers had been slow to act because the victim was black and the shooter white. _____ 5. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously in two cases. Justices handed Samsung a victory in a fight over smartphone patents that may mean the company won\u2019t have to fork over $399 million to Apple. And the court upheld prosecutors\u2019 right to pursue insider trading charges when executives pass along tips to relatives. _____ 6. Wells Fargo has been able to stop lawsuits from defrauded customers by moving the cases into private arbitration, a secretive legal process that often favors corporations. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d said Jennifer Zeleny, above, who is suing the bank. \u201cThis is an issue of identity theft  \u2014   my identity was used so employees could meet sales goals. This is something that needs to be litigated in a public forum. \u201d _____ 7. New York will investigate whether the state\u2019s prison system is racially biased after an investigation by The Times found that black inmates were punished and denied parole at higher rates than white ones. The Times analyzed nearly 60, 000 disciplinary cases from 2015 and interviewed inmates at prisons around the state for the series. Here\u2019s Part I and Part II. _____ 8. The United States fared poorly, as usual, in a worldwide ranking of students\u2019 test scores. But the latest results did show significant gains among disadvantaged teenagers. Andreas Schleicher, who oversees the test, suggested the recently adopted learning goals known as the Common Core State Standards would further those gains in the long term. _____ 9. Beyonc\u00e9 received more Grammy nominations than any other artist, getting nine nods for \u201cLemonade,\u201d an album and film that explored issues of race and infidelity. She\u2019ll compete against Adele  \u2014   who received five nominations  \u2014   in each of the top of three categories. Drake and Rihanna each received eight nominations, and Chance the Rapper had seven. _____ 10. The hot toy of the holiday season is an interactive, furry creature that hatches out of an egg and grows up before your eyes. They\u2019re called Hatchimals, and they are in short supply. The Canadian company that introduced the toy in October, with a suggested retail price of $59. 99, said it \u201chad no idea that it would be this big. \u201d Good luck, shoppers.
