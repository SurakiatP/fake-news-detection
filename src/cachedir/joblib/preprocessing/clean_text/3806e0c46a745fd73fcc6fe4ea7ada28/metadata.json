That was when the college\u2019s president, Lisa S. Coico, abruptly resigned, a day after The New York Times contacted officials with new questions about her administration\u2019s handling of more than $150, 000 of her personal expenses  \u2014   a subject that is currently being investigated by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn. By the time classes resumed after the break for Columbus Day and Yom Kippur, agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation had been spotted on campus, apparently to interview employees students were burning up social media with \u201cBrace Yourself\u201d memes inspired by the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d TV series and the chancellor of the City University of New York system had convened emergency meetings to assuage the concerns of shellshocked faculty members and alumni. Small wonder, then, that many students and faculty and staff members interviewed on campus said they felt discombobulated by the torrent of troubling news. \u201cThere\u2019s a mood of trepidation,\u201d Ruth E. Stark, a distinguished professor of chemistry, said. \u201cOn the one hand, the handling of money has to be looked at carefully, and monitored carefully. But at the same time, I think this is a great concern about the multiplying investigations that will be enveloping us. \u201d Right now, two investigations are underway. The first is being handled by the office of Robert L. Capers, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York. As part of that inquiry, additional subpoenas were issued in the last few days that, among other things, zeroed in on a memo related to Ms. Coico\u2019s expenses that some college officials believe was fabricated to mislead prosecutors. CUNY, the college\u2019s parent entity, and its Research Foundation, which manages the university\u2019s research funds, were included in the new round of subpoenas. The second investigation is an internal one for CUNY being conducted by Andrew J. Levander, a former federal prosecutor. Soon, a third could be started: William C. Thompson Jr. a former New York City comptroller who is the new chairman of CUNY\u2019s Board of Trustees, has urged the state inspector general to do a systemwide investigation of \u201call of the college foundations, alumni associations or other affiliated entities including the CUNY Research Foundation. \u201d The state provides the funding for CUNY\u2019s   senior colleges. Ms. Coico, who has hired a lawyer, has declined to comment. Of more immediate concern at City College, though, is the leadership vacuum. For the next few weeks, the administrator in charge will be Mary E. Driscoll, the college\u2019s new interim provost. The university\u2019s board of trustees is scheduled to meet on Oct. 26 and appoint an interim president. After that, a search will begin for a permanent replacement, with the goal of having someone in place by September. To assure nervous faculty members and others, James B. Milliken, CUNY\u2019s chancellor, visited City College\u2019s Gothic campus early Tuesday morning, when its administrative offices were open, to voice his unwavering support for, and faith in, the college. In an interview, Mr. Milliken said he was encouraged by the shared belief that the college, which has produced 10 Nobel Prize winners and illustrious alumni like the former secretary of state Colin L. Powell and Andrew S. Grove, who was the chief executive and chairman of Intel Corporation, should focus on its future. \u201cWhenever there\u2019s a transition at a leadership level of an institution, particularly one that is fairly abrupt, there is a level of anxiety,\u201d Mr. Milliken said. \u201cThat was one reason I wanted to be at City College when they opened the doors, the first day back at the office. We\u2019re going to do everything we can to ensure that they have stable, talented leadership there. \u201d Many students said they did not have much contact with Ms. Coico, and rarely saw her on campus. Yelina Espinal, a    psychology major, said the only time she saw the former president was during freshman orientation she is now a senior. Still, Ms. Espinal was visibly disgusted with the news about Ms. Coico, as were many other students. \u201cAll the rumors about the things she\u2019s done  \u2014   it\u2019s all over Facebook,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are already upset about a lot of things on campus with the roofs leaking. Now we learn the extent that the president might be stealing? It\u2019s ridiculous. \u201d Stephany Baez, 30, who works full time as a waitress while enrolled at the university, said she was offended by accusations that the president was pocketing extra money on top of her generous pay and benefits package, while she herself was struggling to pay for her classes. She also voiced frustration with the facilities, saying that escalators broke down routinely and that bedbugs had recently infested the library. \u201cI\u2019m so upset about this,\u201d she said. \u201cI struggle really hard. To find out that she\u2019s being so greedy and taking advantage of students who are really having a hard time is really disheartening. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628609.1936557}
