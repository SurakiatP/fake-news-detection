Here are excerpts from the conversation, which have been edited and condensed.  These books that you gave to your daughter Malia on the Kindle, what were they? Some of your favorites? I think some of them were sort of the usual suspects, so \u201cThe Naked and the Dead\u201d or \u201cOne Hundred Years of Solitude,\u201d I think she hadn\u2019t read yet. Then there were some books I think that are not on everybody\u2019s reading list these days, but I remembered as being interesting, like \u201cThe Golden Notebook\u201d by Doris Lessing, for example. Or \u201cThe Woman Warrior,\u201d by Maxine [Hong Kingston]. Part of what was interesting was me pulling back books that I thought were really powerful, but that might not surface when she goes to college. Have you had a chance to discuss them with her? I\u2019ve had the chance to discuss some. And she\u2019s interested in being a filmmaker, so storytelling is of great interest to her. She had just read \u201cA Moveable Feast. \u201d I hadn\u2019t included that, and she was just captivated by the idea that Hemingway described his goal of writing one true thing every day. What made you want to become a writer? I loved reading when I was a kid, partly because I was traveling so much, and there were times where I\u2019d be displaced, I\u2019d be the outsider. When I first moved to Indonesia, I\u2019m this big,   kid that kind of stood out. And then when I moved back from Indonesia to Hawaii, I had the manners and habits probably of an Indonesian kid. And so the idea of having these worlds that were portable, that were yours, that you could enter into, was appealing to me. And then I became a teenager and wasn\u2019t reading that much other than what was assigned in school, and playing basketball and chasing girls, and imbibing things that weren\u2019t very healthy. I think all of us did. Yeah. And then I think rediscovered writing and reading and thinking in my first or second year of college and used that as a way to rebuild myself, a process I write about in \u201cDreams From My Father. \u201d That  period in New York, where you were intensely reading. I was hermetic  \u2014   it really is true. I had one plate, one towel, and I\u2019d buy clothes from thrift shops. And I was very intense, and sort of humorless. But it reintroduced me to the power of words as a way to figure out who you are and what you think, and what you believe, and what\u2019s important, and to sort through and interpret this swirl of events that is happening around you every minute. And so even though by the time I graduated I knew I wanted to be involved in public policy, or I had these vague notions of organizing, the idea of continuing to write and tell stories as part of that was valuable to me. And so I would come home from work, and I would write in my journal or write a story or two. The great thing was that it was useful in my organizing work. Because when I got there, the guy who had hired me said that the thing that brings people together to have the courage to take action on behalf of their lives is not just that they care about the same issue, it\u2019s that they have shared stories. And he told me that if you learn how to listen to people\u2019s stories and can find what\u2019s sacred in other people\u2019s stories, then you\u2019ll be able to forge a relationship that lasts. But my interest in public service and politics then merged with the idea of storytelling. What were your short stories like? It\u2019s interesting, when I read them, a lot of them had to do with older people. I think part of the reason was because I was working in communities with people who were significantly older than me. We were going into churches, and probably the average age of these folks was 55, 60. A lot of them had scratched and clawed their way into the middle class, but just barely. They were seeing the communities in which they had invested their hopes and dreams and raised their kids starting to decay  \u2014   steel mills had closed, and there had been a lot of racial turnover in these communities. And so there was also this sense of loss and disappointment. And so a bunch of the short stories I wrote had to do with that sense, that atmosphere. One story is about an old black pastor who seems to be about to lose his church, his lease is running out and he\u2019s got this loyal woman deacon who is trying to buck him up. Another is about an elderly couple  \u2014   a white couple in L. A.  \u2014   and he\u2019s like in advertising, wrote jingles. And he\u2019s just retired and has gotten cranky. And his wife is trying to convince him that his life is not over. So when I think back on what\u2019s interesting to me, there is not a lot of Jack Kerouac,   young kid on the make discovering stuff. It\u2019s more melancholy and reflective. Was writing partly a way to figure out your identity? Yes, I think so. For me, particularly at that time, writing was the way I sorted through a lot of crosscurrents in my life  \u2014   race, class, family. And I genuinely believe that it was part of the way in which I was able to integrate all these pieces of myself into something relatively whole. People now remark on this notion of me being very cool, or composed. And what is true is that I generally have a pretty good sense of place and who I am, and what\u2019s important to me. And I trace a lot of that back to that process of writing. Has that continued to be so in the presidency? Not as much as I would have liked. I just didn\u2019t have time. But you keep some form of a journal? I\u2019ve kept some, but not with the sort of discipline that I would have hoped for. The main writing that I\u2019ve done during the presidency has been my speeches, the ones at least that were important to me. How has the speechwriting and  being at the center of history and dealing with crises affected you as a writer? I\u2019m not sure yet. I\u2019ll have to see when I start writing the next book. Some of the craft of writing a good speech is identical to any other good writing: Is that word necessary? Is it the right word? Is there a rhythm to it that feels good? How does it sound aloud? I actually think that one of the useful things about speechwriting is reminding yourself that the original words are spoken, and that there is a sound, a feel to words that, even if you\u2019re reading silently, transmits itself. So in that sense, I think there will be some consistency. But this is part of why it was important to pick up the occasional novel during the presidency, because most of my reading every day was briefing books and memos and proposals. And so working that very analytical side of the brain all the time sometimes meant you lost track of not just the poetry of fiction, but also the depth of fiction. Fiction was useful as a reminder of the truths under the surface of what we argue about every day and was a way of seeing and hearing the voices, the multitudes of this country. Are there examples of specific novels or writers? Well, the last novel I read was Colson Whitehead\u2019s \u201cThe Underground Railroad. \u201d And the reminder of the ways in which the pain of slavery transmits itself across generations, not just in overt ways, but how it changes minds and hearts. It\u2019s what you said in your farewell address about Atticus Finch, where you said people are so isolated in their little bubbles. Fiction can leap  \u2014   It bridges them. I struck up a friendship with [the novelist] Marilynne Robinson, who has become a good friend. And we\u2019ve become sort of pen pals. I started reading her in Iowa, where \u201cGilead\u201d and some of her best novels are set. And I loved her writing in part because I saw those people every day. And the interior life she was describing that connected them  \u2014   the people I was shaking hands with and making speeches to  \u2014   it connected them with my grandparents, who were from Kansas and ended up journeying all the way to Hawaii, but whose foundation had been set in a very similar setting. And so I think that I found myself better able to imagine what\u2019s going on in the lives of people throughout my presidency because of not just a specific novel but the act of reading fiction. It exercises those muscles, and I think that has been helpful. And then there\u2019s been the occasion where I just want to get out of my own head. [Laughter] Sometimes you read fiction just because you want to be someplace else. What are some of those books? It\u2019s interesting, the stuff I read just to escape ends up being a mix of things  \u2014   some science fiction. For a while, there was a     novel, the \u201c  Problem\u201d series  \u2014   Oh, Liu Cixin, who won the Hugo Award.  \u2014   which was just wildly imaginative, really interesting. It wasn\u2019t so much sort of character studies as it was just this sweeping  \u2014   It\u2019s really about the fate of the universe. Exactly. The scope of it was immense. So that was fun to read, partly because my    problems with Congress seem fairly petty  \u2014   not something to worry about. Aliens are about to invade. [Laughter] There were books that would blend, I think, really good writing with thriller genres. I mean, I thought \u201cGone Girl\u201d was a     book. I loved that structure. Yeah, and it was really well executed. And a similar structure, that I thought was a really powerful novel: \u201cFates and Furies,\u201d by Lauren Groff. I like those structures  where you actually see different points of view. Which I have to do for this job, too. [Laughter] Have there been certain books that have been touchstones for you in these eight years? I would say Shakespeare continues to be a touchstone. Like most teenagers in high school, when we were assigned, I don\u2019t know, \u201cThe Tempest\u201d or something, I thought, \u2018My God, this is boring.\u2019 And I took this wonderful Shakespeare class in college where I just started to read the tragedies and dig into them. And that, I think, is foundational for me in understanding how certain patterns repeat themselves and play themselves out between human beings. Is that sort of comforting? It gives me a sense of perspective. I think Toni Morrison\u2019s writings  \u2014   particularly \u201cSong of Solomon\u201d is a book I think of when I imagine people going through hardship. That it\u2019s not just pain, but there\u2019s joy and glory and mystery. I think that there are writers who I don\u2019t necessarily agree with in terms of their politics, but whose writings are sort of a baseline for how to think about certain things  \u2014   V. S. Naipaul, for example. His \u201cA Bend in the River,\u201d which starts with the line, \u201cThe world is what it is men who are nothing, who allow themselves to become nothing, have no place in it. \u201d And I always think about that line, and I think about his novels when I\u2019m thinking about the hardness of the world sometimes, particularly in foreign policy, and I resist and fight against sometimes that very cynical, more realistic view of the world. And yet, there are times where it feels as if that may be true. So in that sense, I\u2019m using writing like that as a foil or something to debate against. I\u2019ve read that Lincoln  loved Shakespeare his whole life, but  when he was dealing with the Civil War,  reading the  history plays helped give him solace and perspective. Lincoln\u2019s own writings do that. He is a very fine writer. I\u2019d put the Second Inaugural up against any piece of American writing  \u2014   as good as anything. One of the great treats of being president is, in the Lincoln Bedroom, there\u2019s a copy of the Gettysburg Address handwritten by him, one of five copies he did for charity. And there have been times in the evening when I\u2019d just walk over, because it\u2019s right next to my office, my home office, and I just read it. And perspective is exactly what is wanted. At a time when events move so quickly and so much information is transmitted, the ability to slow down and get perspective, along with the ability to get in somebody else\u2019s shoes  \u2014   those two things have been invaluable to me. Whether they\u2019ve made me a better president, I can\u2019t say. But what I can say is that they have allowed me to sort of maintain my balance during the course of eight years, because this is a place that comes at you hard and fast and doesn\u2019t let up. Is there some poem or any  writing or author that you would turn to, say,  after the mass killings in Newtown, Conn. or during the financial crisis? I think that during those periods, Lincoln\u2019s writings, King\u2019s writings, Gandhi\u2019s writings, Mandela\u2019s writings  \u2014   I found those particularly helpful, because what you wanted was a sense of solidarity. During very difficult moments, this job can be very isolating. So sometimes you have to hop across history to find folks who have been similarly feeling isolated. Churchill\u2019s a good writer. And I loved reading Teddy Roosevelt\u2019s writing. He\u2019s this big, outsize character. Have you read a lot of presidential biographies?  The biographies have been useful, because I do think that there\u2019s a tendency, understandable, to think that whatever\u2019s going on right now is uniquely disastrous or amazing or difficult. And it just serves you well to think about Roosevelt trying to navigate World War II or Lincoln trying to figure out whether he\u2019s going to fire [George B.] McClellan when Rebel troops are 20, 30, 40 miles away. I watched some of the    documentary   \u201cEyes on the Prize\u201d after the election.  It was useful. You do see how far we\u2019ve come, and in the space of my lifetime. And that\u2019s why seeing my daughters now picking up books that I read 30 years ago or 40 years ago is gratifying, because I want them to have perspective  \u2014   not for purposes of complacency, but rather to give them confidence that people with a sense of determination and courage and pluck can reshape things. It\u2019s empowering for them. What books would you recommend at this moment in time, that  captures this sense of turmoil? I should probably ask you or some people who have had time to catch up on reading. I\u2019ll confess that since the election, I\u2019ve been busier than I expected. So one of the things I\u2019m really looking forward to is to dig into a whole bunch of literature. But one of the things I\u2019m confident about is that, out of this moment, there are a whole bunch of writers, a lot of them young, who are probably writing the book I need to read. [Laughter] They\u2019re ahead of me right now. And so in my   in addition to training the next generation of leaders to work on issues like climate change or gun violence or criminal justice reform, my hope is to link them up with their peers who see fiction or nonfiction as an important part of that process. When so much of our politics is trying to manage this clash of cultures brought about by globalization and technology and migration, the role of stories to unify  \u2014   as opposed to divide, to engage rather than to marginalize  \u2014   is more important than ever. There\u2019s something particular about quieting yourself and having a sustained stretch of time that is different from music or television or even the greatest movies. And part of what we\u2019re all having to deal with right now is just a lot of information overload and a lack of time to process things. So we make quick judgments and assign stereotypes to things, block certain things out, because our brain is just trying to get through the day. We\u2019re bombarded with information. Technology is moving so rapidly. Look, I don\u2019t worry about the survival of the novel. We\u2019re a storytelling species. I think that what one of the jobs of political leaders going forward is, is to tell a better story about what binds us together as a people. And America is unique in having to stitch together all these disparate elements  \u2014   we\u2019re not one race, we\u2019re not one tribe, folks didn\u2019t all arrive here at the same time. What holds us together is an idea, and it\u2019s a story about who we are and what\u2019s important to us. And I want to make sure that we continue that. I know you like Junot D\u00edaz\u2019s and Jhumpa Lahiri\u2019s books, and they speak to immigration or the American Dream. I think Lahiri\u2019s books, I think D\u00edaz\u2019s books, do speak to a very particular contemporary immigration experience. But also this combination of  \u2014   that I think is universal  \u2014   longing for this better place, but also feeling displaced and looking backwards at the same time. I think in that sense, their novels are directly connected to a lot of American literature. Some of the great books by Jewish authors like Philip Roth or Saul Bellow, they are steeped with this sense of being an outsider, longing to get in, not sure what you\u2019re giving up  \u2014   what you\u2019re willing to give up and what you\u2019re not willing to give up. So that particular aspect of American fiction I think is still of great relevance today.'"}, "time": 1742563547.7961051}
