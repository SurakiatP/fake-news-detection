Trump unabashedly trumpeted his support for warmer relations with Russia at a campaign rally here on Monday night, acidly mocking opponents who say he is too friendly to Vladimir V. Putin, the country\u2019s strongman president. Mr. Trump, who has been under fire from Democrats and some conservative national security leaders for his accommodating stance toward Mr. Putin, cast his supportive remarks as a matter of practical necessity. By aligning itself with Russia, he said, the United States could more easily take on the Islamic State and other terrorist groups. \u201cIf we could get Russia to help us get rid of ISIS  \u2014   if we could actually be friendly with Russia  \u2014   wouldn\u2019t that be a good thing?\u201d Mr. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, said. Repeating the question moments later, he won loud applause from the crowd: \u201cIf we could get along with Russia, wouldn\u2019t that be a good thing, instead of a bad thing?\u201d Noting that Mr. Putin had made laudatory comments about him, Mr. Trump teased political rivals, including Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, who have criticized his friendliness with the Russian leader. \u201cThey say, \u2018Putin likes Trump,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump began. He continued the mimicry: \u201cHow dare he like Putin? How dare he?\u201d Mr. Trump also reiterated his view that NATO, the security alliance formed as a bulwark against the Soviet Union, was \u201cobsolete. \u201d Both Mrs. Clinton and her running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, have chastised Mr. Trump for praising Mr. Putin, and Mr. Trump has raised concerns among defense experts for repeated comments that appear to signal tolerance of Russia\u2019s aggression in Eastern Europe. In an appearance on \u201cThis Week\u201d on ABC News over the weekend, Mr. Trump declined to express disapproval of Russia for its annexation of the Ukrainian territory of Crimea in 2014. On the contrary, Mr. Trump suggested that the people there might be happier under Russian rule. And the Republican nominee said in an interview with The New York Times in July that he would not necessarily come to the defense of NATO states in the event of invasion, and would decide based on whether the country in question had paid its dues to the alliance. Mr. Trump also touched off an uproar during the Democratic National Convention last week when he said in a news conference that he hoped Russian hackers would infiltrate Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email. He later said he was being sarcastic. With his appearance in Pennsylvania on Monday, Mr. Trump showed no intention of abandoning his embrace of Mr. Putin and his country. He professed disbelief that political opponents have said he should swear off Mr. Putin. \u201cHe said nice things about me,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWhy would I disavow it? Why?\u201d He derided Mrs. Clinton at length and accused her Democratic primary opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, of having made a \u201cdeal with the devil\u201d to support her in the general election. \u201cShe\u2019s the devil,\u201d Mr. Trump said of Mrs. Clinton.'"}, "time": 1742562422.9512634}
