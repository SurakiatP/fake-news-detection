The protesters believe the local police department were using Facebook\u2019s location feature to compile a list of activists who are protesting about the pipeline, and requested people to check in to \u2018confuse\u2019 investigators. \\n\u201cThey really got us there,\u201d admitted one police officer at the scene, who was busy macing faces, \u201cWe were on number 1,234,786 when some guy from Ireland checked in, forcing us to start again. Now we have no idea who\u2019s protesting. We\u2019ve been outsmarted, and outwitted. All we can do now is fire some rubber bullets and hope for the best. God, you people are so clever\u201d. \\nMeanwhile, a county Mayo man\u2019s check-in to the Corrib gas pipeline has so far accumulated 28 fellow protesters.'"}, "time": 1742628593.0583162}
