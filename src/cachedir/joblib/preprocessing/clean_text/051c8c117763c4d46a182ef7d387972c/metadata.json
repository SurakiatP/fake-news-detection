[Marking the 50th anniversary of the Six Day War, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres issued a statement saying that the 1967 defensive war \u201cresulted in Israel\u2019s occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem, Gaza and the Syrian Golan and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians and Syrians\u201d that \u201cfueled recurring cycles of violence and retribution,\u201d while making no mention of Israel\u2019s right to defend itself at the time against the threat of annihilation from combined Arab armies.  \u201cEnding the occupation that began in 1967 and achieving a negotiated   outcome is the only way to lay the foundations for enduring peace that meets Israeli security needs and Palestinian aspirations for statehood and sovereignty. It is the only way to achieve the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people,\u201d Guterres said. \u201cThis occupation has imposed a heavy humanitarian and development burden on the Palestinian people,\u201d he added. \u201cAmong them are generation after generation of Palestinians who have been compelled to grow up and live in ever more crowded refugee camps, many in abject poverty, and with little or no prospect of a better life for their children. \u201d Israel\u2019s ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, accused the   of disseminating \u201cPalestinian misinformation. \u201d \u201cAny attempt at a moral equivalency between killing innocent people and the building of homes is absurd,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is preposterous to blame terror and violence in the Middle East on the one true democracy in the region,\u201d he said. \u201cThe moment the Palestinian leadership abandons terror, ceases to incite against our people and finally returns to direct negotiations, then real progress can be made towards peace. \u201d Danon later slammed UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra\u2019ad   for opening a session of the UN Human Rights Council by decrying Palestinian suffering. \u201cIt comes as no surprise that he chose to spread lies about Israel before he even mentioned the massacres in Syria. The Commissioner has forgotten that it is his job to care for human rights throughout the world, not to incite against Israel,\u201d Danon said in a statement. Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely called on Guterres to \u201ccorrect the [UN\u2019s] distortion\u201d of \u201coccupation. \u201d \u201cOn the day when the UN sticks to the facts and ceases the misguided use of the term \u2018occupation\u2019 it will restore its credibility as an organization founded to uphold justice and truth,\u201d she said in a statement. Israel is celebrating the 50th anniversary of \u201cthe liberation of Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria, and these are the facts,\u201d she added. The   League (ADL) also slammed Guterres for what it described as an \u201cincomplete and misleading\u201d statement. \u201cWe are troubled by the  \u2019s incomplete statement on the anniversary of the   War and urge him to clarify his remarks,\u201d ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement. \u201cWhile we share his desire for a return to negotiations to achieve a   solution, this anniversary cannot be viewed in a vacuum. It is grossly misleading to examine only the enduring effects of the war while ignoring the context in which the war took place  \u2014   the belligerence of the Arab states in the spring of 1967, and the silence of the international community in the face of these threats and its failure to ensure the rights to free passage of international waterways. \u201d Greenblatt added his appreciation for Guterres\u2019 \u201csupportive statements on Israel, including recognizing the double standard with which Israel is treated at the UN, and his labeling as   the delegitimization of Israel\u2019s right to exist. \u201d \u201cWe would have hoped that he would use this anniversary to address the Palestinian condition and call for peace and resolution in a   and historically accurate manner,\u201d Greenblatt concluded. The UN coordinator for humanitarian aid and development also marked the 50th anniversary of the Six Day War by condemning Israel. \u201cIt should be obvious, but it bears repeating, that occupation is ugly,\u201d Robert Piper said in a statement released Tuesday. \u201cLiving under foreign military rule for years on end, generates despair, suffocates initiative and leaves generations in a kind of political and economic limbo,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742561824.0807495}
