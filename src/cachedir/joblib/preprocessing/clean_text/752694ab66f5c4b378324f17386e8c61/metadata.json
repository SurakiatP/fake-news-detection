Comment on polling: Election \u201ccalls\u201d have never seemed very interesting to me \u2014 were it my place to make them \u2014 in the same way that predicting when a flood will crest is a lot less interesting than understanding (and perhaps managing) a watershed. That doesn\u2019t mean predictions are not fun! Madison asked in the Federalist 51 : \u201cBut what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature?\u201d By the same token: \u201cWhat is the horse race, but the greatest of all the performing arts?\u201d That said, putting past Water Coolers into the \u201ccall\u201d frame, the method I used didn\u2019t yield bad results. Rather than tracking the very noisy individual polls, I decided to use the RealClearPolitics polling averages every Monday \u2014 once a week, for sanity\u2019s sake \u2014 and plug those averages into a reasonable list of swing states provided by the New York Times, whose interactive tool then enabled me to game out scenarios in the electoral college. In all the weeks I did this but one, Trump had a plausible path to victory, depending on reasonable scenarios in individual states. In other words, still in the \u201ccall\u201d frame, I beat most of the paid pollsters in the political class who were, er, trumpeting Clinton\u2019s victory. And as we saw in yesterday\u2019s Water Cooler, I tied the Trump team\u2019s internal polling; they thought they were going to lose, though they qualified their views by pointing out the same plausible paths to victory that I did. Why did I not get the scale of Trump\u2019s victory? I mean, in 2008 and 2012, and maybe farther back, the Republican candiate always made a show of putting Pennsylvania in play, and it never came to anything. Trump won it! Along with Michigan and Wisconsin (where Sanders, interestingly, defeated Clinton as well). \\nPolicy \\n\u201cIt is clear to any objective observer that the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which has resulted in rapidly rising premiums and deductibles, narrow networks, and health insurance, has not been a success. A Trump Administration will work with Congress to repeal the ACA and replace it with a solution that includes Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), and returns the historic role in regulating health insurance to the States. The Administration\u2019s goal will be to create a patient-centered healthcare system that promotes choice, quality and affordability with health insurance and healthcare, and take any needed action to alleviate the burdens imposed on American families and businesses by the law\u201d [ President Elect ]. Let us know how that works out. And: \\nTo maximize choice and create a dynamic market for health insurance, the Administration will work with Congress to enable people to purchase insurance across state lines. The Administration also will work with both Congress and the States to re-establish high-risk pools \u2013 a proven approach to ensuring access to health insurance coverage for individuals who have significant medical expenses and who have not maintained continuous coverage. \\nAnd: Modernize Medicare, so that it will be ready for the challenges with the coming retirement of the Baby Boom generation \u2013 and beyond Maximize flexibility for States in administering Medicaid, to enable States to experiment with innovative methods to deliver healthcare to our low-income citizens \\nHmm. \\n\u201c\u2018Donald Trump has said he wants to repeal Obamacare, and we hope that wasn\u2019t an empty campaign promise,\u2019 said Twila Brase, president and co-founder of CCHF. \u2018It will take more than a promise to make American health care great again and to restore health care freedom to patients and doctors. Republicans need to advance visionary ideas for health care, ideas that are bigger than buying across state lines; ideas that put patients and doctors back together again without the costly interference and intrusions of profiteering outsiders. The high cost of health care comes primarily from the middlemen, including managed care and government'\u201d [ Citizens\u2019 Council for Health Freedom ]. CCHF is a good conservative site on health care policy. I don\u2019t agree with them on policy, but CCHF is relentless and above all they don\u2019t make stuff up. \\n\u201cObamacare \u2018Replacement\u2019 Might Look Familiar\u201d [ Kaiser Health News ]. Could be. ObamaCare was, after all, originally a Republican plan, so it should be possible to rebrand it. \u201c\u2018It gets into a questions of semantics,\u2019 said Mark Rouck, an insurance analyst for Fitch Ratings. \u2018Are they really repealing the act if they replace it with new legislation that has some of the same characteristics?\u2019\u2026 Topping the list of ACA provisions likely to survive under Trump is the requirement that employers cover workers\u2019 children up to the age of 26, analysts said. The measure is widely popular and not especially expensive\u2026. A health law crafted by Republicans might also retain the ACA\u2019s protections for people with preexisting illness seeking coverage, said Glenn Melnick, a health economist at the University of Southern California\u2026 The ACA\u2019s biggest coverage expansion came through the Medicaid program for the poor and disabled, which added more than 15 million people. Trump has suggested giving states fixed federal grants for Medicaid, which could lead to a substantial reduction in coverage or benefits.\u201d \\n\u201cThen Donald Trump was elected president, and now the tables may have turned again. Trump has on several occasions expressed his opposition to net neutrality, once calling it \u201canother top down power grab\u201d [ MarketWatch ]. \\n\u201cWho\u2019s Advising President-elect Trump on Heatlh Care?\u201d (PDF) [ Holland & Knight ]. Rich Bagger: Executive Director (Health care policy advisor). Was Assistant General Counsel at Horizon Blue Cross and Blue Shield) Eric Ueland: Budget Advisor (Entitlements) Jim Frogue: Domestic Policy (Health Care, State Policy). Was Health Care Policy Analyst for Heritage Foundation [ home of ObamaCare , interestingly enough] Ado Machida: Domestic policies (Health) Ed Meese: Executive Office of the President Lead Andrew Bremberg: Domestic Policy (Affordable Care Act repeal and replace) \\n\u201cBremberg was on Walker\u2019s team when the candidate unveiled a healthcare proposal that included repealing the Affordable Care Act and splitting Medicaid into smaller programs with separate funding\u201d [ Modern Health Care ]. And: \u201cFor eight years, Bremberg served in the Department of Health and Human Services. From 2005 to 2007, he was special assistant to the Immediate Office of the Secretary and from 2001 to 2005, he was special assistant to the executive secretary\u201d [ Health Care Finance ]. And: \u201cNames reportedly under consideration for HHS secretary include former Louisiana Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal, former Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Gov. Rick Scott, R-Florida, and former Rep. Renee Ellmers R-North Carolina.\u201d Thin bench! \\n\u201cOne day after his election, we polled our readership of healthcare managers and clinicians to see what they think the short and long-term effects will be of Trump\u2019s policies on the healthcare sector, and we were flooded with responses. While most of them detail the deep concerns industry professionals have, a small few felt the businessman\u2019s idea could improve competition and lower costs\u201d [ Health Care FInance ]. Good article. \\nRealignment \\n\u201cAt this early stage, we can\u2019t know with certainty exactly why Clinton lost. In a narrow sense, obviously, the electoral vote was lost because she lost Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Iowa. Exit polls (which are often unreliable, but all we have for the moment) and the vote distribution strongly suggest those states were lost because Clinton lost many of the white working-class voters that broke for Obama in 2012 . Overall exits show a 16-point swing to Trump among voters making less than $30,000 compared to the last presidential election \u2014 the biggest of any group in The New York Times crosstabs\u2026. Also, general turnout was off from 2012\u2033 [ The Week ]. So to fire the blame cannons at working class racism, you have to argue like this: \u201cTrump won the racist vote because the people who voted for the black guy wouldn\u2019t vote for the white woman.\u201d Oh, OK. Now, you can deploy the misogyny blame cannons, but the identity politicians seem to be going with racism at the moment. \\n\u201cPeople often talk about \u2018racism/sexism/xenophobia\u2019 vs. \u2018economic suffering\u2019 as if they are totally distinct dichotomies. Of course there are substantial elements of both in Trump\u2019s voting base, but the two categories are inextricably linked: The more economic suffering people endure, the angrier and more bitter they get, the easier it is to direct their anger to scapegoats. Economic suffering often fuels ugly bigotry\u201d [Glenn Greenwald, The Intercept ]. I would go further and urge that \u201cracism/sexism/xenophobia\u201d are forms of politics, and that they are the evil twin of identity politics, and together are the only forms of politics permitted by elites . See the next link. \\n\u201cA top liberal group [The Center for American Progress] has temporarily abandoned plans for a new project designed to court white working class voters after it could not marshal the necessary financial support for the project, according to documents obtained by the Washington Free Beacon\u201d [Washington Free Beacon (2014)]. So, the Democrats abandoned the (white) working class because the squillionaires wouldn\u2019t fund the effort to reach out to them (and here we are!) Could it be that the squillionaires had a reason for that? Like that would be against their class interests? More: \u201cThe stated need for the project suggests potential pitfalls for Democrats in its eventual delay: In a midterm election year expected to heavily favor Republicans, CAP has apparently abandoned, for the time being, an effort to reach out to a constituency that it acknowledges could determine the viability of the Democrats\u2019 voting coalition going forward. The Bobby Kennedy Project was the brainchild of CAP senior fellow Ruy Teixeira, who for the past decade has stressed that a lasting Democratic majority will require the party to make inroads with white working class voters.\u201d Much too little, much too late from Teixeira, who injected the identity politics virus into the Democrat bloodstream to begin with . \\n\u201cThe Dems need organization and focus on the young. Need a fifty State strategy and tech rehab. I am in for chairman again,\u201d Dean said\u201d [ Yahoo News ]. Oh, HoHo. Really? After helping Clinton rig her selection as a superdelegate and smearing Trump as a coke user on no evidence ? Yeah, the 50-state strategy was great. But that was before you lost your mind! \\n\u201cThe Real Lesson in Grubhub CEO Telling Trump Supporters to Resign (Plus an Earlier, Personal One) \u2013 WP Original\u201d [ WirePoints ]. \\n\u201cChelsea Clinton being groomed to run for Congress\u201d [ New York Post ]. \u201cHail, Hydra! Immortal Hydra! We shall never be destroyed! Cut off a limb, and two more shall take its place!\u201d \\nStats Watch \\nConsumer Sentiment, November 2016 (preliminary): \u201cIndications going into the presidential election are very positive as the consumer sentiment index is up more than 4 points in the November flash to 91.6 for the best showing since June (the data were compiled before the November 8 result). The gain is concentrated in the expectations component\u201d [ Econoday ]. People expect Trump to do better, then? And: \u201cWhile this is a very small sampling that is not always universally accurate, investors, traders and economists love to dwell on this report because it is really the first real look at live data for each month\u201d [ MarketWatch ]. \\nRail: \u201cWeek 44 of 2016 shows same week total rail traffic (from same week one year ago) marginally expanded according to the Association of American Railroads (AAR) traffic data. Rolling averages remain in contraction \u2013 but are improving\u201d [ Econintersect ]. Finally some good news! \\nEmployment Situation: \u201d The good news is the prime working age group has started to grow again, and is now growing at 0.5% per year \u2013 and this should boost economic activity. And it appears the prime working age group will exceed the previous peak later this year\u201d [ Calculated Risk ]. \\nHoney for the Bears: \u201cSales aren\u2019t falling year over year but they aren\u2019t growing at 5% as they would do in \u2018normal\u2019 times\u201d (charts) [ Mosler Economics ]. \u201d In \u2018normal\u2019 times inventories increase with sales, adding to output. But when sales slow inventory growth stops and reverses:\u201d \\nFodder for the Bulls: \u201cSpot metallurgical coal topped $300 a metric ton for the first time since flooding in Australia curbed output from the world\u2019s biggest seaborne exporter five years ago\u201d [ Bloomberg ]. \u201cChina\u2019s efforts to cut overcapacity in its coal industry have reduced domestic supply and boosted imports of both metallurgical and the variety burned in power stations.\u201d \\nThe Bezzle: \u201cIf a variable is normally distributed we can use standard probabilistic techniques to analyse it. If it is not then we cannot\u201d [Phillip Pilkington, Econintersect ]. \u201cSo, what about economic variables? Are they normally distributed? Short answer: no, they are not.\u201d Oops. If you look at income (a proxy for class) you don\u2019t see a bell curve. You see a power law curve. And see the last link in News of hte Wired, too. \\nThe Bezzle: \u201cIn September, with typical marketing hoopla, Fitbit Inc. rolled out two new gadgets, the Charge 2 and Flex 2. Designed to measure more detailed fitness stats, the trackers were well reviewed and seemed poised to help Fitbit retain leadership of an increasingly competitive market. But within weeks the devices were piling up in stores, according to analyst spot checks\u201d [ Bloomberg ]. In other words, the stuff wasn\u2019t moving. We need more spot checks everywhere. \\nThe Bezzle: \u201d UberEats And UberRush Couriers Complain They Don\u2019t Get Their Tips\u201d [ BuzzFeed ]. \\nThe Bezzle: \u201cApple cuts USB-C adapter prices in response to MacBook Pro complaints\u201d [ The Verge ]. \u201d Apple\u2019s cables, unlike those you might order from a random seller online, are going to be well-made and reliable.\u201d That\u2019s really funny. My genuine Apple cable wore out in about a year.

Technically, it\u2019s a kind of biochemical company. After developing colors in a lab, Pantone makes most of its money by selling the shades and corresponding formulas to fabric mills, printers, and designers in a range of disciplines. It\u2019s a simple model, and business has never been better.\u201d Reminds me of identity politics, conceptually and methodologically. \\n\u201cAmong facts that take a stubbornly long time to sink in, here\u2019s one: Countries that borrow in their own currencies never have to default on their debt\u201d [ Wall Street Journal, \u201cMessage from the Gilt Market: U.K. Can Never Run Out of Pounds\u201d]. \\nToday\u2019s Fear & Greed Index: 46 Neutral (previous close: 44, Fear) [ CNN ].

The global economy did not collapse. Neither did the markets or the Internet. There wasn\u2019t violence at the polls. Putin did not hack our electronic voting systems.
