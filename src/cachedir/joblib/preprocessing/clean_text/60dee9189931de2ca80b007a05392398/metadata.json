Bill was hard of hearing and always spoke loudly, very loudly. We had to speak loudly to him, too, always talking directly into his right ear. If he was making his way down to us this meant he had completed hours of designing his On the Street and Evening Hours columns with John Kurdewan, his long time collaborator and close friend. He never deviated from his daily uniform: blue jacket, khaki pants and sensible black sneakers. He said once that Vanity Fair wanted to put him on their   list and asked for his fashion essential. \u201cDuct tape is what I will tell them!\u201d he said. (He sometimes   his jackets to prolong their use.) \u201cMiss Joanna! Miss Val!\u201d he would call out as he approached our desks. He was so focused on getting his pictures precisely organized on the layout, he usually forgot to eat breakfast. So one of us or another colleague would go out and get his regular order: a sugar doughnut (with the sugar scraped off) and a coffee with milk. The total was $2, not that he would let any of us pay for it. Cecilio, who works at the coffee cart across the street, always knew the      was for Bill, and would say, \u201cTell Billy I said hi. \u201d Over the course of the day  \u2014   almost every Friday until Bill\u2019s death on June 25  \u2014   we worked with him on our projects. He and Joanna would go to a conference room so they could record his popular On the Street videos. Nothing was rehearsed or scripted. He would give a nod and then start. \u201cHello, this is Bill Cunningham. \u201d His Billisms were always left in, like his throat clearing as he said his introduction or his laughing at his own jokes. There might be tangents about how all the kids had a fashion revolution at Sheep Meadow in Central Park on Easter Sunday 1967, or about the giddy feeling he got when he saw Courr\u00e8ges\u2019 first collection. Bill never watched the completed videos. He just said, \u201cChild, I trust you. \u201d (He would often call people \u201cchild,\u201d and sometimes \u201cMiss Muffett. \u201d) Maybe he didn\u2019t want to suggest he was questioning the work. Maybe he didn\u2019t like to hear the sound of his voice. The meeting with Val would be in her cubicle. Bill described her job as \u201cdoing the words,\u201d the words being the names and scene setters in his Evening Hours column and the descriptive paragraphs in On the Street. He would dictate. She would take down everything he said. Together they would edit. This was a task taken on by many New York Times employees over the years, a lot of copy editors among them. It was not without its difficulties. There was always the tension of the looming 3:30 p. m. deadline. He had a tendency to make changes at the last minute. He wanted his columns to be just the way he wanted them to be. What mattered to him was the quality of the pages hitting doorsteps that Sunday. Bill embraced fashion\u2019s eccentrics and didn\u2019t care about celebrities. (He refused to say Kanye West\u2019s name in the most recent Met Gala video, referring to him as \u201cone man. \u201d) Though it was a photo of Greta Garbo that earned him his first   spread of pictures in 1978, the only reason he had photographed her was because he loved how her coat fell on her shoulder. He knew the back stories and family trees of the \u201cunknown\u201d guests he repeatedly photographed at society parties. And he loved babies and children. While every other photographer was shooting clothes on the runway, Bill turned his camera to the \u201ckiddies\u201d in the front row. \u201cAre you kids interested in this?\u201d was one of his favorite questions. He had a passion for museums. Many weeks, his Evening Hours column was a roundup of names, but on certain occasions, such as when the Frick Collection and the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum were involved, he would leave extra space for a narrative. Flowers received special attention, as well, and they often appeared in his photographs. In the office, when he saw arrangements wilting on someone\u2019s desk, he would rush to get a cup and water them, muttering as he did it, \u201cOh, what a crime. \u201d Bill expressed his enthusiasm regularly and effusively. He complimented all of us who worked with him, and he was a generous, playful colleague. On days when the vending machines would malfunction, he would call everyone over and hit the numbers to hand out free sodas. He\u2019d ham it up when friends from other departments came by and even consented to pose with us for selfies, against his better instincts. When Joanna wore red lipstick to work, Bill would ask her, \u201cOh child, do you have a date tonight?\u201d After she told him she just liked to wear red lipstick for herself, he replied: \u201cThat\u2019s right, child. Just remember they need you, you don\u2019t need them!\u201d He considered those who worked with him family. On Thanksgiving, he would invite many of us over to his modest apartment, which had a view of the parade. He would hand out chocolate turkeys and let people sit on his bed, a thin mattress on a wood strip over two box crates. This year, he gave everyone feathers that he used on his hats when he was a milliner. Bill marked every holiday with gifts. On Easter, he\u2019d hand out toy bunnies. On the Fourth of July, it was scarves with a print of the United States flag on them. On Christmas, a box of truffles from Godiva or Myzel\u2019s, a small chocolate shop on 55th Street from the \u201960s, where Kamila Myzel, a Polish immigrant, still makes the chocolates by hand. When he received a Christmas card that lit up, he rushed downstairs to show us how it worked. This year, for Valentine\u2019s Day, Bill left us paper hearts with a toy bird attached to each one. The birds were the same ones he had in his apartment. He was giving us a piece of himself.'"}, "time": 1742562241.4489508}
