[The video shows Anderson and a substantial crew appearing to direct the mostly female \u201cdemonstrators\u201d who file under a cordon one at a time under the watchful eye of nearby police constables.  Flowers are laid out around the group as it appears, and printed placards bearing slogans such as \u2018#Love Will Win\u2019 and \u2018#TurnToLove\u2019 are spread out. After crew members make sure everyone is in place, Anderson begins her report saying, \u201cWhat I want to show you now, viewers, is a wonderful scene\u201d  \u2014   to muffled laughter from Mark Antro, who filmed the   and other bystanders. This is outrageous. Propaganda.

S. media commentator Richard Grenell described the scene as \u201cvery disturbing\u201d in a Twitter post which was later recirculated by Dr Sebastian Gorka, the Deputy Assistant to President Donald Trump. Other online commentators, such as former LBC host Katie Hopkins and popular Trump supporter Mike Cernovich, were more forthright. \u201cWATCH. @CNN scripting a narrative. Right before your eyes. \u201d tweeted Hopkins. \u201cCNN caught staging news!\u201d tweeted Cernovich. \u201cThey even brought \u2018peace group\u2019 printed out papers and props\u201d. The network fired back, however, with its   public relations team insisting their employees had done nothing wrong. This is nonsense. Police let demonstrators through the cordon to show their signs.
