They\u2019re never going to put the real codes in there for him. \u201d  After host Chris Hayes said that he roots for Trump to \u201chandle the North Korea situation well. \u201d Moore responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I agree with that, because  \u2026    it\u2019s like rooting for a    who suddenly swiped dad\u2019s car and figured out how to take it down the road. I\u2019m not rooting for the    to get on the highway and drive that car. I want the    off the highway. \u201d Hayes stated he\u2019d like to avoid nuclear war. Moore countered that \u201cyou\u2019ve got the wrong person. \u201d He added, \u201c[O]ur only hope is that, please, Pentagon, if you\u2019re watching, the football, the nuclear football that his aide carries around in that briefcase with the nuclear codes, I\u2019m guessing they don\u2019t actually have the real codes in there.

If you\u2019re watching, over in Arlington. \u201d Moore later added, \u201c[H]opefully, there are safeguards set up around him. Again, if you\u2019re watching at the Pentagon, please. \u201d Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'"}, "time": 1742564048.2801523}
