Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, and his many years spent propagating lies about President Obama\u2019s birthplace. But Samantha Bee, on her TBS cable series, \u201cFull Frontal,\u201d took aim at a different target, condemning the NBC network and its   host Jimmy Fallon for putting Mr. Trump on \u201cThe Tonight Show. \u201d She faulted Mr. Fallon for conducting a genial,   interview on Thursday, even as Mr. Trump had refused that day in other interviews to acknowledge that Mr. Obama was born in the United States. \u201cNetwork execs, and a lot of their audience, can ignore how very dangerous Trump is because to them, he isn\u2019t,\u201d Ms. Bee said on her show. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to be deported. They\u2019re not going to live under a president who thinks of them as a collection of sex toys. \u201cThey\u2019re not racist. They just don\u2019t mind if other people are, which is just as bad. \u201d It\u2019s one thing to make fun of Mr. Trump, who said  on Friday that Mr. Obama \u201cwas born in the United States, period. \u201d It\u2019s another to criticize a network or Mr. Fallon, who is typically not held up to such scrutiny, partly because of his amiable   personality and the perception that his \u201cTonight Show\u201d (which draws more than three million viewers a night, the most in its category) is a place for nonpartisan diversions. He and rival hosts like Mr. Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel try to avoid criticizing one another in public. NBC declined to comment on Tuesday, and Mr. Fallon has not spoken publicly on his conversation with Mr. Trump, except in a short TMZ. com interview, in which Mr. Fallon says on camera: \u201cHave you seen my show? I\u2019m never too hard on anyone. \u201d But Mr. Fallon took plenty of criticism for the Thursday interview, and Ms. Bee\u2019s monologue was perhaps the bluntest denunciation of it so far. On a day in which Mr. Trump continued to give ambiguous answers on whether he still supported his false birtherist theory, Mr. Fallon asked him mostly uncontroversial questions and playfully ran his fingers through Mr. Trump\u2019s hair. Playing off that image, Ms. Bee said sarcastically, \u201cAw, Trump can be a total sweetheart with someone who has no reason to be terrified of him. \u201d Jo Miller, an executive producer of \u201cFull Frontal,\u201d said in an interview on Tuesday that seeing the cozy behavior between Mr. Fallon and Mr. Trump \u201cwas a punch in the gut. \u201d Ms. Miller said that she and her \u201cFull Frontal\u201d colleagues \u201clove Jimmy. \u201d She added, \u201cWho doesn\u2019t love Jimmy?\u201d But, she said, Mr. Fallon\u2019s ingratiating treatment of Mr. Trump is \u201ca problem because we love him. \u201d \u201cIf he thinks that a   demagogue is O. K. that gives permission to millions of Americans to also think that,\u201d she continued. Ms. Miller, who came with Ms. Bee from Comedy Central\u2019s news satire \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d said she has no problem \u201cshowing candidates and public servants as human beings, and I think there needs to be more of that. \u201d \u201cThat said,\u201d Ms. Miller added, \u201cthis is not a race between Democrat and Republican  \u2014   this is a race between Democrat and demagogue. You don\u2019t normalize someone who\u2019s inciting violence. \u201d The \u201cFull Frontal\u201d segment about Mr. Fallon and NBC had been touched off when Ms. Miller received a text early Friday morning from Travon Free, a former writer for \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d who now works on HBO\u2019s \u201cAny Given Wednesday With Bill Simmons. \u201d The text from Mr. Free included a picture of Mr. Fallon caressing Mr. Trump\u2019s coiffure, and an urgent, slightly vulgar message exhorting Ms. Miller and Ms. Bee to address the subject on their show. \u201cThat was the first I heard of it,\u201d Ms. Miller said. \u201cI was like, What? This didn\u2019t happen. \u201d Mr. Free said on Tuesday in a phone interview that, other than Ms. Bee, \u201cI knew no one would do it, because it\u2019s just this buddy culture among the hosts in that category. \u201d Mr. Free added: \u201cIf Jimmy Fallon was my friend, we would have had a real conversation. Not being cool with what he did on his show doesn\u2019t make you his enemy. \u201d Echoing Ms. Bee\u2019s monologue, Ms. Miller said that Mr. Fallon did not deserve all the blame, and that NBC was more culpable for providing Mr. Trump a platform as the star of its reality shows \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d and \u201cThe Celebrity Apprentice. \u201d Even after NBC said in June 2015 that it was firing Mr. Trump for \u201cderogatory statements\u201d at his presidential announcement, in which he referred to Mexican immigrants as \u201crapists\u201d and \u201cmurderers,\u201d the network continued to feature him on \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d and \u201cSaturday Night Live. \u201d Ms. Miller pointed out that there is still an awkward relationship between Mr. Trump and NBC, where the \u201cToday\u201d show host Matt Lauer was criticized for going too easy on him in a   presidential forum, and Mr. Trump has expressed   skepticism of the NBC \u201cNightly News\u201d anchor Lester Holt, who will moderate the first presidential debate. She drew a distinction between the broader categories of political satire programs like \u201cFull Frontal\u201d and   talk shows that can only engage their guests in harmless banter. \u201cIt\u2019s not their job to be political satirists and to shake people by their shoulders and say, \u2018Look at this thing  \u2014   do you think it\u2019s O. K.?\u2019\u201d Ms. Miller said. \u201cThat\u2019s our job. \u201d Ms. Miller said it would be helpful to hear her message reinforced by white men in her field. Otherwise, she said, \u201cIt becomes, \u2018Oh, you see everything through the lens of sexism,\u2019 or, \u2018Not everything has to be about race. \u2019\u201d \u201cTo me, this is just about decency,\u201d she said. On Monday night, meanwhile, Mr. Fallon\u2019s \u201cTonight Show\u201d guests included Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee. Going through items that they said belonged to Mr. Trump, Ms. Clinton offered Mr. Fallon something that she said Mr. Trump had left behind for him: a bag of softballs. Mr. Fallon responded, \u201cThat was my gift to him. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563417.5518363}
