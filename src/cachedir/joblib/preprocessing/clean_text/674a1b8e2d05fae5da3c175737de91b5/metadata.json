[But before the bus could get out of New York, two attackers smashed several windows, punched holes in the side, and   political demands  \u2014   \u201ctrans rights now!\u201d and \u201ctrans liberation\u201d  \u2014   over the huge    message on the side of the bus, which says:  It\u2019s Biology, Boys are boys   \u2026     and always will be, Girls are girls  \u2026     and always will be. You can\u2019t change sex. Respect all.  The attack was inflicted after the conservative organizers had \u201ccall[ed] on all Americans to respect the free speech rights of citizens to debate these issues without fear of being demeaned, harassed, or threatened with retaliation. \u201d The #FreeSpeechBus tour began Thursday in New York, and it is being led by the National Organization for Marriage (NOM) International Organization for the Family, and CitizenGO. \u201cWe filed a police report and there is video surveillance\u201d of the two attackers damaging the bus and attacking the bus driver, Brian Brown, the director of the National Organization for Marriage, told Breitbart News. The attack took place near the United Nations building.  \u201cThey should be punished to the full extent of the law,\u201d he said. \u2018\u201cIt is a hate crime   \u2026     if it was motivated by our religious or political beliefs, it is under the statutes to be prosecuted as a hate crime. \u201d The attack \u201cproves our point  \u2014   that some on the other side don\u2019t believe in tolerance, they want to shut us down   \u2026    . [but] we\u2019re not stopping the bus tour,\u201d he said.  The bus tour is needed to spread the message nationwide that government must not promote the false claim that people can change their sex, said Brown.  \u201cWe\u2019re seeing actual legislation trying to force schools to accept that boys can go into girls\u2019 restrooms  \u2014   that\u2019s absolute insanity,\u201d he said. State and federal approval of the transgender claim that people can and should be allowed to change their sex have created a   of medical specialists who are performing radical surgery on children, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re taking young children and essentially mutilating them   \u2026     this is horrific, and people need to stand up against this. \u201d Political advocates for the \u201cgender ideology\u201d idea say that biological sex has nothing to do with feelings of \u201cgender,\u201d that people can and should be allowed to change their legal sex as often as they wish and also that government can and should force other people to comply with the changing preferences of people who say they want to live as members of the other sex. For example, these activists say that biological men should be legally invited to use women\u2019s   and sports leagues, and children should be forced to refer to a boy as a girl if the other child wants them to do so.  The overall goal for the transgender activists is a \u201cgenderless society\u201d which no longer allows any social, civic or legal recognition of the   different, equal and complementary preferences of the two distinct heterosexual sexes, including the normal view of marriage as a man and a woman joining to become parents for the next generation of people. \u201cThe end of the [transgender] road is to say that fundamental reality is simply a subset of our wishes  \u2014   that if I wake up one day and say \u2018I\u2019m a boy [then] I\u2019m a boy,\u2019   \u2026     that\u2019s the big lie here,\u201d he said.    libertarians should recognize that \u201cif you [allow government to] change the fundamental nature of male or female persons, it can change anything  \u2014   and the government can try to coerce people to buy into their false version of reality,\u201d he said. The orange bus was leased to help share this argument with Americans and media outlets around the nation, he said  \u201cThe \u2018gender identity\u2019 activists have scared people from stating the obvious truth,\u201d said Brown. \u201cThe bus is letting people know they should not be afraid to stand against this nonsense,\u201d he added.  Polls show fewer than   of Americans support the claim that people should be allowed to freely change their legal sex without surgery or legal paperwork. Other polls show lopsided public opposition to demands that   bathrooms be replaced by shared bathrooms.   Advocates say that only 0. 6 percent of people are transgender. Critics highlight a study of the 2010 census which showed that only 89, 667 adults had changed their names from one sex to another. That\u2019s roughly 1 in 2, 500 adults.
