Lee High School\u2019s Principal Mark Rowicki \u2014 who dressed as Trump, and the school\u2019s secretary Stephanie Corbett \u2014 who dressed as Clinton. A photo of the duo was posted to the school\u2019s website in a playful album of costumes worn by students and staff.\\nPrincipal Mark Rowicki and secretary Stephanie Corbet\\nPolitical figures have long been fodder for satirical Halloween costumes, and Clinton masks with the orange jumpsuits were an extremely popular choice this year \u2014 as the holiday falls just before the election. On the other side of the political aisle, many people dressed as cats with \u201cdon\u2019t grab my p*ssy\u201d signs, \u201cbad hombres,\u201d or \u201cnasty women.\u201d\\nAfter the photos were posted, a parent reportedly complained about the \u201cpolitically charged costumes\u201d on Facebook, leading to the photos being removed from the website.\\n\u201cI don\u2019t care who you are or are not voting for. You are professionals, who work with children. Some more impressionable then others. The fact that any school official would think it\u2019s okay to dress like this leaves me appalled and floored,\u201d Emberly Lynn Martin, who has two daughters, wrote on a Facebook post, WTVR reports. \u201cWhat message are you sending to any of them when their high school principal dresses up like a man who wants to deport them, says things like \u201cshe\u2019s a nasty woman\u201d, or \u201cgrab em by the p\u2014\u2013?\u201d\\nJudging by the last portion of her comment, it isn\u2019t the fact that the school administration dressed up in politically relevant costumes, but rather the fact that they appear to support a candidate that she doesn\u2019t.\\nOutrage over Halloween was once associated with the religious right \u2014 but these days, complaints about the holiday from liberals are as predictable as trick or treaters. Nearly every costume can be deemed offensive by someone, and colleges have even offered counseling for students upset over what peers are wearing for this year\u2019s celebrations.\\nThough its arguable about whether or not it was necessary, Principal Rowicki has apologized to anyone he may have offended.\\n\u201cIt is a longstanding tradition of Staunton City Schools\u2014and of many school divisions across the United States\u2014to allow students and staff to engage in festive activities and dress in costume for Halloween,\u201d Dr. Linda Reviea, Superintendent of Staunton City Schools said in a statement on the school\u2019s website . \u201cThat said, the particular costumes worn by two employees at R.E. Lee High School were in poor judgment, given the current political climate and the extraordinarily strong sentiments for the 2016 presidential candidates. I became aware of the situation on Tuesday night and instructed our staff to remove the images in question from Lee High School\u2019s website today (Nov. 2). We are handling the situation as a personnel matter and addressing the issue with relevant staff.\u201d\\nIt is unclear if Rowicki or Corbett were disciplined over the harmless costumes.\\nThe post School Principal Dresses Up as Trump For Halloween, Triggers Parents appeared first on We Are Change .\\n'"}, "time": 1742562294.2052996}
