But in recent months, as the American presidential election took a series of bizarre turns, Iranians seeking to make fun of the \u201cGreat Satan\u201d have ditched the arts and crafts and simply switched on their TV sets. Iran\u2019s state television, a bastion of conservative ideologues, for once interrupted its regular programing about the \u201cmurders and crimes committed\u201d by the United States and broadcast all three debates between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump  \u2014   live. In a country that tightly controls information about the United States and depictions of Western democracy generally, the decision to show the debates was unprecedented but by no means inexplicable: The presidential campaign shows the United States political system in such a poor light,   evidently want it to speak for itself. \u201cWe only need to sit back and let these candidates show themselves how idiotic they are,\u201d said Hamidreza Taraghi, a conservative analyst and a regular guest on state television. \u201cThe best way for us to prove that the U. S. government is corrupt and hideous is by showing these people live on our TV. \u201d Live, yes, but some parts  \u2014   especially those criticizing Iran  \u2014   were not fully translated. After each debate, analysts discussing the outcome were in unanimous agreement that America, in its current state, \u201ccannot do a damn thing. \u201d To say that Iran\u2019s political establishment has been thoroughly enjoying the campaign is an understatement. Last week, Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called the American election \u201ca spectacle for exposing their crimes and debacles. \u201d Ayatollah Khamenei seized on the campaign\u2019s tawdriest details: accusations of infidelity and sexual assault. \u201cThe remarks made by these two U. S. presidential candidates over the last few weeks on immoral issues  \u2014   which are, for the most part, not baseless accusations  \u2014   are enough to disgrace America,\u201d he said during a speech commemorating the 1979 takeover of the United States Embassy in Tehran. His supporters responded enthusiastically by shouting, \u201cDeath to America. \u201d Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee, was not mentioned by name, but the ayatollah seemed to praise his outspokenness, saying: \u201cPeople pay more attention to him. \u201d The candidate, he said, is tapping into genuine American dissatisfaction. \u201cBecause the people look at what he says and see it is true,\u201d Ayatollah Khamenei said. \u201cThey see it in the facts of their lives. \u201d Since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran has been officially  . Many ordinary Iranians have milder feelings for the United States, where over two million of their relatives live. Iran\u2019s leaders, long entangled in a battle for power and influence with the United States in the Middle East, have been emboldened by the American withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan. \u201cAmerica is no longer a superpower in the region. It\u2019s weak in the Middle East. They are now only one of the players,\u201d said Jalal Barzegar, a reformist journalist. \u201cIt\u2019s now just a country. \u201d For Iranians uninterested in watching the debates, Iran\u2019s state television had another option. In recent weeks it has been airing Netflix\u2019s \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d called \u201cHouse of Straw\u201d here because playing cards is considered  . Kevin Spacey\u2019s portrayal of the conniving politician Frank Underwood is the perfect embodiment of the \u201cinhumane face\u201d of American politics, state television officials have said. Apparently, Ayatollah Khamenei has also been watching. In his recent speech, he quoted a line uttered by Mr. Spacey in the series. \u201c\u2018Shake with your right hand, but hold a rock in your left one,\u2019 as they say themselves,\u201d Ayatollah Khamenei said. \u201cThis is the kind of people they are. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628527.1016455}
