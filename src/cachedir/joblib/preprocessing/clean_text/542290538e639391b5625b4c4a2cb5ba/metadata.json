[According to the   warning by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) issued today in a campaign launched on its website, these foods should be avoided because they all contain higher levels of acrylamide, a chemical which has caused cancer in mice.  The campaign  \u2014   called Go For Gold  \u2014   says that acrylamide is produced when starchy foods such as bread and potatoes are cooked for long periods at higher temperatures such as baking, frying, grilling, toasting, and roasting. The FSA claims: The scientific consensus is that acrylamide has the potential to cause cancer in humans. Which, according to its critics, is precisely the kind of      junk science which gives      junk science a bad name. As Christopher Snowdon, head of lifestyle economics at the Institute of Economic Affairs says, this is a classic case of \u201cmission creep\u201d from a government agency. \u201cThey should be dealing with real safety issues like the handful of restaurants who are putting out genuinely dangerous food,\u201d he said. \u201cThis sort of thing undermines public faith in scientific advice and terrifies people. \u201cPeople just don\u2019t know what to eat anymore because they\u2019re not being given clear advice. \u201d Indeed. Neither Cancer Research UK nor the European Food Standards Agency have been able to find a major health risk issue, despite their best efforts. The quango was set up in 2000 under Tony Blair in response to a spate of food poisonings in restaurants. Few would argue that ensuring basic standards of hygiene and safety in the food supply is a legitimate public health goal, but the FSA soon got bored of that and became part of the nanny state. Amongst its dubious achievements are telling football fans to substitute sparkling water and grapes for beer and crisps when watching the World Cup, defining cheese as \u2018junk food\u2019 and lobbying for bans on advertising. It is a classic example of bureaucratic expansion. As its mission crept, its budget grew, and although it has been trimmed somewhat in the era of   austerity its annual income exceeds \u00a3130 million and it apparently still has time to tell people not to fluff their roast potatoes.'"}, "time": 1742561908.7897174}
