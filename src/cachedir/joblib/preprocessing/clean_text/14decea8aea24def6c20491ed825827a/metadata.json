So I became very worried because not enough was coming out into the open and I knew that there was more. We have very good intelligence on Russia. So then I had talked to some of my former colleagues and I knew that they were trying to also help get information to the Hill. \u201d (  Fox News) Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor'"}, "time": 1742563193.7273989}
