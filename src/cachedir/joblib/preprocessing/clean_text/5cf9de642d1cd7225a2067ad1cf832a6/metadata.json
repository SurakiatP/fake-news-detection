John Lewis ( ) and   Donald Trump after Lewis said Trump was not a \u201clegitimate president\u201d and Trump fired back with criticisms of Lewis for his work in Georgia.  Barber praised Lewis, saying he \u201cstands in the tradition\u201d of the prophets, Jesus and Martin Luther King Jr. \u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of illegitimacy to [Trump]. I can tell you lastly, Joy, over 10, 000 clergy and activists, we wrote him and asked to meet with him to discuss  things with him and they still have not responded. So, I stand with John Lewis as he stands in the tradition of the prophets, the tradition of Jesus and the tradition of Martin Luther King to say what is right even when people may not want to hear it,\u201d Barber said.
