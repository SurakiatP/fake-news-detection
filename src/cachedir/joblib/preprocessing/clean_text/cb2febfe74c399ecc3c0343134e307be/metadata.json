Louie Gohmert ( ) told Fox and Friends on Friday that Congress concluding business on Thursday and not being in session on the day after fired FBI Director James Comey told the Senate Intelligence Committee that he leaked information about his private conversations with President Donald Trump left the president to \u201cdangle. \u201d[House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy\u2019s office on Tuesday sent out an email announcing the change.  \u201cMembers are advised that  \u2014   pending timely completion of H. R. 10  \u2014   votes are no longer expected in the House on Friday, June 9,\u201d the email stated. \u201cLast votes of the week are now expected at approximately 4:00 PM on Thursday, June 8. \u201d The Majority Leader\u2019s office told Breitbart News that the decision was made because the Democrats withdrew all amendments from the Choice Act being considered by the House leading to business concluding a day early. But Gohmert said it sends the wrong message about Republicans support for Trump. \u201cTuesday, apparently, our leadership changed the week\u2019s scheduling and said let\u2019s go dark on Friday, which means the emphasis will not be on what we\u2019re doing good in Washington,\u201d Gohmert said. \u201cWe are basically leaving the president to dangle,\u201d Gohmert said. \u201cI\u2019m very concerned we are not being supportive enough to get the message out and here President Trump is   \u2026     as [Senator] Marco Rubio was pointing out   \u2026     the only thing that didn\u2019t leak was the truth  \u2014   that [Trump] was not under investigation. \u201d Meanwhile, at his weekly press briefing on Thursday, Ryan said he didn\u2019t have time to watch the Comey hearing but vaguely supported Trump by claiming he was \u201cnew\u201d to the government and its modus operandi. \u201cAs far as the conversations and all that, I\u2019m not going to speculate on any of this, I would just add that of course there needs to be a degree of independence between the DOJ, FBI and the White House and lines of communications established,\u201d Ryan told reporters. \u201cThe president\u2019s new at this, he\u2019s new to government,\u201d Ryan continued. \u201cSo he probably wasn\u2019t steeped in the long running protocols that establish the relationships between DOJ, FBI and White Houses. \u201cHe\u2019s new to this,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cWe now know why [Trump] was frustrated when the FBI director told him three times there\u2019s no investigation of him yet the speculation was allowed to continue,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cSo obviously we know now why he was frustrated. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562907.4531963}
