To take just one example, the instrument\u2019s affirmation of the right to regulate is meaningless. Of course, the parties have not entirely given up their right to regulate. But the fact is, even if the instrument had full legal force under international law, CETA would still threaten the ability of Canada or EU governments to regulate in the public interest, enhance public services, and hold multinational companies accountable for their actions. \u2018The critical point missing,\u2019 as we wrote previously, \u2018is that while the parties retain the right to regulate, they must do so in conformity with their CETA obligations and commitments.'\u201d So it will be interesting to see if Obama tries a similar deception on TPP. But wait! \\nWallonia\u2019s principled stand did, however, produce some important results. While most of the media attention in Canada appears to have focused on the joint instrument, the more interesting and potentially significant development may be the accord between Belgian governments that spells out the grounds for Belgium\u2019s federal government to sign CETA. \\nFor example, Belgium will now ask the European Court of Justice to give an opinion on the legality of CETA\u2019s investment court system within the EU. Even more importantly, four of Belgium\u2019s regional governments also state that they reject CETA (notably its investment chapter) as negotiated and that Belgium will refuse to ratify the treaty unless these concerns are addressed. In other words, while Belgium is now in a position to sign CETA, it will not be able to ratify the deal as it stands. \\nThis means that CETA\u2019s investment chapter, at a minimum, must be revised or the investment court system scrapped, before CETA can be ratified by Belgium. The accord also includes assurances that if any Belgian regional government refuses to ratify CETA, the federal government must give notice to the EU that Belgium cannot ratify, an act that could potentially trigger the end of CETA\u2019s provisional application in all European member states. \\nThe German constitutional court staked out a similar position in the event that Germany fails to ratify CETA. That decision, by the way, will not be made by the German government alone, but in conjunction with Germany\u2019s second chamber, which is currently controlled by the anti-CETA Greens and Left parties. \\nSo while CETA proponents have undoubtedly cleared a big albeit unanticipated hurdle in getting the deal signed, their machinations may have made CETA\u2019s full ratification even less likely. CETA\u2019s passage in Europe is far from assured, despite the apparent breakthrough in Belgium. \\nAnd then there is the voice of the Canadian establishment\u2013 \\nCETA: \u201cCETA puts Canada\u2019s trade debate to rest once and for all\u201d [ Globe and Mail ]. \u201cThe rationale for launching CETA in Canada was in large part to establish a measure of diversification from the country\u2019s trade relations within the North American free-trade agreement. Given the tone around trade in the U.S. presidential election, this decision now looks especially prescient.\u201d \\nCETA: \u201cWhat the Canada-EU Deal Means for the Future of Trade\u201d [ Fortune ]. \u201cAll of the factors that drove Europe to conclude this agreement provide insights for current trade challenges in the U.S. President Obama is trying to get Congress to approve just after the presidential election the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement\u2026 Now is the time to resolve as many specific congressional objections to the deal as possible. It is impossible to renegotiate the TPP in the time available, so as with the last-minute negotiations between the EU and Belgium, both the administration and Congress will need to be pragmatic and come to an agreement quickly on outstanding issues.\u201d \\nTISA: \u201cThe 21st round of negotiations for the Trade in Services Agreement kicks off this morning in Geneva, and stakes are high for significant progress to be made this round in order for the deal to wrap up by its early December deadline. Significant issues remain, including data flows \u2014 where the European Union is still working to come up with a consolidated position \u2014 and new services, on which the EU and others are continuing to push for the right to apply different regulations to domestic and foreign constituents rather than afford the same treatment to all TISA partners.

It\u2019s like an athletic contest or maybe a high-stakes entertainment performance.\u201d \\nWar Drums \\n\u201cIn the five and a half years since the uprising in Syria began, it has become the most catastrophic war of our young century\u201d [Dexter Filkins, The New Yorker ]. I would have thought that our invasion of Iraq in 2003 set the baseline for \u201ccatastrophic\u201d? What the heck was Filkins thinking when he wrote that sentence? And The New Yorker used to be famous for its fact-checking. When did that get crapified, anyhow? \\nThe Voters \\n\u201c[W]hile Trump and many of his supporters may fetishize a past that is deeply retrograde, liberals and progressives have also demonstrated a troubling tendency to fetishize a future that they presume is on their side. There\u2019s something peculiarly telling about this kind of progress fetishism, which has been conscripted as ideology-of-first-resort for Clintonite New Democrats\u201d [ The Baffer ]. \u201cWhen our historical terrain has effectively focused most of our political energies to differentiating ourselves from the not-woke-enough opponents of progress, we can lose all critical introspection. We can uncritically pass over the fact that, say, liberal multiculturalism can end up being really racist , tolerance of queer sexualities can end up repackaging biologically determinist languages of eugenics, and so on. Moreover, as the rise of the New Democrats has made crystal clear (from Bill and Hillary to Obama), we will dependably base our biggest political choices on our future-focused need to have our place on the right side of history confirmed. So what if that means more drone strikes, deportations, mass incarceration of minorities, destructive free trade agreements, corporate concessions, and financial deregulation? It\u2019s messy \u2018maintaining\u2019 history, after all.\u201d \\n\u201cEarly Voting a Poor Predictor of Final Results\u201d [ RealClearPolitics ]. One of several reasons: \u201c[W]e don\u2019t know the effect to which campaign strategy is creating the appearance of a participation surge by merely cannibalizing Election Day voters by mobilizing voters who would have voted on Election Day anyway.\u201d \\nDownballot \\n\u201cThe presidential race may be inducing whiplash, but the House battleground remains relatively stable in the final week. We rate only 40 House races in Lean or Toss Up, and Democrats would need to sweep 35 of them to win control, so Republicans remain overwhelming favorites to hold onto their majority. But there is still plenty of uncertainty about the size of that majority: Democrats could gain anywhere from 5 to 20 seats\u201d [ Cook Political Report ]. \u201d Republican voters have begun coming home to Donald Trump amid the Comey news\u2026 Even if control is not at risk, the ultimate size of the GOP majority matters a great deal, especially to Speaker Paul Ryan. To the extent Republicans lose seats, almost all of the casualties will be swing-district moderates who are more loyal to Ryan than Trump. The narrower the majority, the less room for error Ryan will have in winning reelection to his position and navigating the 2017 legislative minefield.\u201d \\nWell done, DSCC: For Senate this year, Dems nominated two weed opponents (NV, NH), corp lobbyists (PA, IN), & a trust fund kid former Republican (FL) \\n&mdash; Lee Fang (@lhfang) November 2, 2016 \\nThe Trail \\n\u201cSEPTA strike halts transit service in Philadelphia\u201d [ Progressive Railroading ]. Effect on voting? \\n\u201c[T]he race between [Clinton and Trump] is now a precise dead heat in the latest ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll, 46-46 percent. A majority, 55 percent, continues to expect Clinton to win, though that\u2019s down 5 points from its peak last week\u201d [ ABC ]. \u201d Among other results is a gradual collapse in support for Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson, from a peak of 9 percent support in September to just 3 percent now. Jill Stein of the Green Party has 2 percent and has held steady.\u201d Amazingly, Trump now leads on honesty and trustworthiness. Of course, it\u2019s madness to focus on individual polls; RCP\u2019s 4-way average has Clinton up by 1.9, though falling. \\n\u201cWith the fallout over the FBI email probe continuing to take up oxygen, Trump has stayed uncharacteristically on message. Campaigning near Philadelphia on Tuesday, the GOP nominee and his running mate focused on the projected 25 percent average increase in premiums for some Affordable Care Act plans, as open enrollment began. Trump let Mike Pence do most of the talking, and the Indiana governor closed his remarks on repealing the law by asking Republicans to \u201ccome home'\u201d [ RealClearPolitics ]. Hitherto, Trump has been the anti-Napoleon, always interrupting his enemy when they are making a mistake. Not so this week (though there are 5 days to go). Kellyanne Conway must have gotten Trump\u2019s attention somehow. Or Ivanka. \\n\u201cDonald Trump Voters, Just Hear Me Out\u201d [The Moustache of Understanding, New York Times ]. Four paragraphs in, he turns to the topic of Trump: \u201cTrump is not only a flawed politician, he\u2019s an indecent human being.\u201d Persuasive! I dunno. If a vote for Trump would finally force Friedman off the Times Op-Ed page, would it be worth it? Tough call. \\nRealignment \\n\u201cWill this be the election that finally kills off the Democratic and Republican parties?\u201d [ McClatchy ]. \u201cJust days before Election Day, interviews with more than 40 independent voters in swing states underscores that the nomination of two deeply unpopular candidates for president is aggravating and reinforcing a growing trend in the country away from the Democratic and Republican parties, which more and more voters see as out of touch with their lives and out of date in a new century. The number of free agent voters registering as independent or unaffiliated is soaring, while Republican and Democratic numbers flatline. Independent registrations have jumped since 2008 by 22.3 percent in states that keep registration data by party. Democrats over that same time increased 2.7 percent and Republicans 3.6 percent\u2026\u201d \\n\u201c6 Reasons Why A New Civil War Is Possible And Terrifying\u201d [ Cracked ]. \u201c\u2018Trust\u2019 isn\u2019t just an intangible concept when we\u2019re talking about the potential for civil warfare. Sinisa Malesevic is a professor who studies the sociology of civil wars and a survivor of the Yugoslavian civil war. He\u2019s someone Marvel really should\u2019ve reached out to for script advice, and he noted the breakdown of trust was one of the first traumatizing steps to war, \u2018\u2026 in a very short period of time, there is a complete sense of fear, you do not know who is who, who is supporting which side \u2026 that fear spreads.'\u201d And: \u201cColonel Couvillon also thought any conflict was likely to start in a rural area, \u2018\u2026people talk about, is it gonna be class warfare, race warfare \u2026 is it gonna be north versus south? Personally, I think it\u2019s gonna be urban versus rural.'\u201d Another interesting piece from Cracked, of all places. \\nDemocrat Email Hairball \\n\u201cOpinion: Hillary Clinton is irreparably damaged, even if she wins\u201d [ MarketWatch ]. \u201c[W]e are in for a fiasco in politics that will make even this fiasco of a campaign pale by comparison. There is hardly any scenario that is too far-fetched. Even if the polls are right and Clinton\u2019s lead translates into an electoral victory, she will be so damaged going into office that her chances of getting anything done will be virtually nil. In this sense alone, Trump\u2019s claim that this scandal is \u201cworse than Watergate\u201d could prove to be true. As an incumbent, Richard Nixon at least had an administration in place when he won re-election in 1972, though it took nearly another two years before he was forced to resign under threat of impeachment.\u201d \\n\u201cU.S. Sen. Ron Johnson said Monday he believes Hillary Clinton\u2019s actions with her private email server are impeachable offenses should she be elected president\u201d [ Beloit Daily News ]. \u201cJohnson cited 18 U.S. Code 793 (f) and 18 U.S. Code 2071, which have to do with the willful destruction or removal from proper custody of information relating to national defense. Johnson honed in on the latter of the two, which reads in part that anyone found to have concealed or removed records \u2018shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.\u2019\u2018I\u2019m not a lawyer, but this is clearly written,\u2019 Johnson said. \u2018I would say yes, high crime or misdemeanor, I believe she is in violation of both laws.'\u201d In principle, I agree. If a high official can privatize their communications, and then decide what to destroy and what to retain before turning them over to law enforcement, the term \u201cpublic records\u201d becomes literally meaningless. Nixon, deep within his withered and wormy soul, retained a shred of conscience: He didn\u2019t simply destroy the tapes . Clinton would have destroyed the tapes without hesitation; in fact, that\u2019s exactly what she did with \u201cher\u201d\u2014 that is, the public\u2019s \u2014 mail. \\n\u201cWisconsin Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner told conservative radio host Charlie Sykes Tuesday that there would be a \u2018constitutional crisis\u2019 if Clinton was indicted, and when asked about impeachment, answered, \u2018I think that is something that is speculative in nature. I\u2019m speculating, what I can say is that I think Richard Nixon would have been indicted and he would have been impeached. He stopped the impeachment by resigning as a result of Watergate and he stopped the indictment by President Ford pardoning him\u201d [ CNN ]. On pardons, see Jerri-Lynn\u2019s post today . \\nStats Watch \\nADP Employment Report, October 2016: \u201cADP sees significant softening for Friday\u2019s employment report, estimating October private payrolls will come in at 147,000\u201d [ Econoday ]. \u201cThough ADP\u2019s revision does point to an upward revision to September\u2019s data in Friday\u2019s report, the October estimate is soft and could further lower expectations for a rate hike at today\u2019s FOMC meeting.\u201d And but: \u201d ADP is showing jobs growth equalling the rate of people entering the jobs market. The growth this month is as Econintersect forecasted based on economic potential\u201d [ Econintersect ]. \u201cADP employment has not been a good predictor of BLS non-farm private job growth. \\nGallup U.S. Job Creation Index, October 2016: \u201cAmerican workers\u2019 reports of hiring activity at their place of employment remained relatively strong in October, with many more saying their employer was adding rather than subtracting jobs\u201d [ Econoday ]. \u201cFor nearly all of Gallup\u2019s JCI trend since August 2008, net hiring in the private sector has far outpaced government net hiring. But the latest poll shows the narrowest gap between net hiring in the two sectors since April 2009, with nongovernment hiring (plus 32) essentially tied with government hiring (plus 31).\u201d \\nMBA Mortgage Applications, week of October 28, 2016: \u201cPurchase applications for home mortgages fell a seasonally adjusted 0.4 percent in the October 28 week, following a sharp 7 percent decline in the prior week to the lowest level since January\u201d [ Econoday ]. \\nShipping: \u201cUS west coast employers and [ILWU and PMA] union leaders are to continue talks about extending the current employment contract covering dockworkers.The two sides met on Tuesday to discuss an extension beyond mid-2019 as part of an effort to restore confidence in ports along the Pacific seaboard\u201d [ Lloyd\u2019s List ]. \\nShipping: \u201cAre conditions finally improving for the air cargo industry?\u201d [ Air Cargo News ]. \u201cSeptember market round-up shows that air cargo volume demand increased by 5% year on year in September \u2014 a level of increase not seen for two years. \u2018With such an increase in total weight transported, a further worldwide yield improvement over previous months, and industry sources claiming that October will be even better, one could be forgiven for thinking that the industry shows signs of improving health,\u2019 the analyst said.\u201d There\u2019s a calendar effect that only accounts for a fraction of the increase. \u201cAt the recent Air Cargo Forum there was much speculation as to what had caused the improvements.\u201d A sporty game! \\nShipping: \u201cA majority of Splash readers fear container freight rates will only pick up later than 2020. With 10 days to go until voting closes in our quarterly online survey, called MarPoll, roughly one quarter of the more than 500 respondents to date feel container freight rates will pick up only after 2020\u201d [ Splash 24/7 ]. \u201c\u2018Shipping may have to accept the bubble has burst and what was will not be again.

If borne out, that forecast would indicate this year\u2019s plunging freight rates and shrinking profits for marine carriers will only grow worse, particularly on major trade lanes across the Pacific and between Asia and Europe\u201d [ Wall Street Journal , \u201cMore Pain Ahead for Ocean Shipping\u201d]. \u201cThe shipping industry hasn\u2019t adjusted to a slowdown in global trade, with shipyards churning out giant container vessels and carriers holding onto excess capacity even as rates fall. Historically, container shipping demand grew over 5% annually, often outpacing global economic growth.

But in light of the disparate treatment of the armed Malheur National Wildlife Refuge occupiers (who were acquitted of all charges Friday) and the protesters in North Dakota supporting the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in its fight against construction of an oil pipeline, it\u2019s apparent that such weapons are now an effective component of the protester\u2019s toolkit\u201d [Letter to the Editor, Los Angeles Times ]. Well, the difference isn\u2019t that the Malheur occupiers were white, given that the (sadly but mostly) white Occupy movement was treated to a 17-city coordinated paramilitary crackdown orchestrated by Obama\u2019s DHS; the difference is that they were right wing (and white). So the Sioux are both the \u201cwrong\u201d color, and their cause is percieved by the country at large as on the left (though I think the Sioux themselves would reject that framework). \\n\u201cWant to Help the Standing Rock Sioux?

Of course, exercising, eating organic food, and pushing children to use their spare time usefully are not inherently bad things.
