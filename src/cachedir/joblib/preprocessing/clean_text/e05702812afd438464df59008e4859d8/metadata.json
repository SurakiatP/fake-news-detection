Nope. Pence is offended by a news report he hasn't read about their voter suppression efforts. Share on Twitter Print This Post \\n\u201cThat\u2019s offensive to me, that kind of language. It\u2019s not our operation,\u201d Indiana Governor Mike Pence said Friday morning on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe . \\nYes, Donald Trump\u2019s Republican running mate Mike Pence has finally found something he\u2019s offended by, but it\u2019s not Donald Trump bragging about sexual assault or insulting African Americans or Mexicans or women or a Gold Star family. \\nNope. \\nDid Pence read the story? No. But he\u2019s offended. So offended. Because that kind of language is offensive. Not the actual suppression of the votes, but the language, because it\u2019s not \u201cour operation.\u201d \\nWatch here via MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe : \\nTwice saying he hasn\u2019t read the article, Pence proceeded to launch into a diatribe about how offended he was by something he hadn\u2019t read, \u201cThat\u2019s offensive to me, that kind of language. It\u2019s not our operation,\u201d Pence denied. \\n\u201cDonald Trump and I want every American who has the opportunity to vote to vote in this election. And that\u2019s our message, is to tell the American people that this country really belongs to them. That we can have government as good as our people again, but it\u2019s going to take all of us.\u201d \\n\u201cAnd you saw Donald Trump \u2026 say that people who haven\u2019t traditionally voted Republican, we\u2019ve got an agenda to bring our cities back\u2026\u201d \\nPence is twice offended, so super offended: \\n\u201cI\u2019ve never heard anybody in this campaign talk that way. Frankly, you know, it was offensive to me to hear that being reported in the news because that\u2019s just not the approach Donald Trump has taken to this campaign. It\u2019s not the approach we\u2019re taking. We\u2019re reaching out to every American.\u201d \\nPence then claimed Independents and even Democrats are breaking for Trump. In fact Trump and Pence are even losing groups that voted for Mitt Romney in 2012. Pence then belied his own confidence by trying to shame Republicans into voting for them by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s time for Republicans to come home\u201d because Trump won the primary. \\nMike Pence laughed at the idea that the race is over and done, because \u201cIt\u2019s just not what I see out there.\u201d \\nTrump also loves to cite what he \u201csees\u201d and reads, and often times those things turn out to not even exist \u2013 like videos he claims to have watched. \\nThis explains why Mike Pence and Donald Trump ended up together. It turns out, they are not that different after all, in spite of the Republican establishment\u2019s efforts to persuade the voters and themselves otherwise. Both Pence and Trump don\u2019t care a whit about facts. This is more than typical campaign spin, it\u2019s appalling in context. \\nThe context is that Mike Pence is willingly standing next to a man who brags about grabbing a woman\u2019s \u201cp*ssy\u201d without her permission, but he is publicly saying he\u2019s offended by language used in a report about their voter suppression efforts. \\nPence didn\u2019t even bother to read the article, which suggests that he doesn\u2019t care if their campaign is really suppressing voters. But why would he? \\nPence didn\u2019t care about any of the groups Donald Trump insulted \u2013 not enough to take a public stand, so why start now. But he took a public stand was when the insult was aimed at his own campaign. \\nLike Trump, Pence is also insulted by language calling out bad behavior instead of the bad behavior. \\nImage: Screencap via MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d \\nMike Pence Is Fine With Trump Sexual Assault But Offended By Voter Suppression added by Sarah Jones on Fri, Oct 28th, 2016\""}, "time": 1742628550.6956725}
