After the wildlife documentary showed snakes trying to kill a baby iguana, many Britons now believe animals need their own laws and a police force. Administrator Nikki Hollis said: \u201cThese snakes are doing the most horrific things without the slightest fear of being arrested and punished. \u201cAnimals need to realise they won\u2019t be safe until they have laws and enforce them. Gorillas could be the police, because they\u2019re massive and won\u2019t put up with any nonsense, and wise animals like owls could be judges. \u201cCriminal animals will soon get the message once a few are sentenced to life for murder. Obviously animals don\u2019t have prisons yet but I\u2019m sure the monkeys could build cages.\u201d Graphic designer Tom Logan said: \u201cAfter seeing the extent of lawlessness in the animal kingdom I think we need to get the human courts involved. \u201cThe conviction rate will be high because most animals make no attempt to hide their crimes, leaving a wealth of DNA and video evidence. \u201cWe also need an emergency rescue service for baby penguins, because that episode of Life in the Freezer made me blub in front of my mates.\u201d \\nShare:'"}, "time": 1742561968.1057243}
