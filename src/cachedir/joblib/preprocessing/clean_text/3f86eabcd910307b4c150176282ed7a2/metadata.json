Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \\nSeeing the end of his second term approaching quickly, President Obama made another dent in his to-do list Thursday by granting 98 more commutations, bringing his total to 872. Obama grants 98 more commutations. The total is now a record 872 shortened sentences, mostly for drug offenses. https://t.co/oVF3HgoYNU \\n\u2014 Ray Locker (@rlocker12) October 27, 2016 . @POTUS granted another 98 commutations today and has commuted more than the previous 11 presidents combined. https://t.co/htzhcFtV2f pic.twitter.com/v6lQo4YoSN \\n\u2014 Civil Rights (@civilrightsorg) October 27, 2016 BREAKING: Obama grants 98 more commutations, setting single-year clemency record https://t.co/yUV63AurvM pic.twitter.com/uB0MNRQs39 \\n\u2014 SPLC (@splcenter) October 27, 2016 \\nThe White House usually makes quite a big deal out of the president\u2019s commutation sprees, but the blog post accompanying Thursday\u2019s batch was relatively brief, noting that \u201cwhile there has been much attention paid to the number of commutations issued by the President, at the core, we must remember that there are personal stories behind these numbers.\u201d Eggleston says the 98 commutations are going to individuals \"who have diligently worked to rehabilitate themselves while incarcerated.\" \\n\u2014 Mark Knoller (@markknoller) October 27, 2016 \\nThe people to whom some of these criminals sold drugs certainly have their own personal stories as well, but don\u2019t look for those in the news. Most of those granted clemency are serving time for nonviolent drug crimes, but while the president has teamed up with rapper Macklemore to fight opioid abuse, he\u2019s also cutting the sentences of a whole lot of crack and meth dealers. @markknoller Great, more criminals added to the thousands of others he\\'s released into our communities. \\n\u2014 Normi Shamblin (@RtisticOne) October 27, 2016 \\nOh, yeah, and don\u2019t forget the guns. For a believer in gun control, the president doesn\u2019t seem to believe felons in illegal possession of firearms deserve the harsh sentences they were given. Of the 98 people granted clemency Thursday, 19 or so were felons in possession of firearms \u2014 but sure, pass more gun control laws. Trending'"}, "time": 1742562173.9853384}
