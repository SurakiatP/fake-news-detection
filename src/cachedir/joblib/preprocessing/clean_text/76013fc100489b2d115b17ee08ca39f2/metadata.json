Produced by filmmaker Joel Gilbert, it drew nearly 100,000 views per day and more than 1,000 viewer comments, with the overwhelming majority expressing support for Williams and outrage at the Clintons for not being willing to allow a DNA test to determine paternity. \\nSign the precedent-setting petition supporting Trump\u2019s call for an independent prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton! \\n\u201cMy YouTube account has been deleted, but the same video appears in 50 other places on YouTube alone,\u201d Williams said on his Facebook page after being notified of YouTube\u2019s decision. \u201c[YouTube] can\u2019t handle the truth! Please share #BillClintonSon.\u201d \\nTwitter also continues to allow Williams to post the \u201cBanished\u201d video on Danney Williams\u2019 page , but the Twitter link to YouTube displays the message : \u201cThis video is no longer available because the YouTube account associated with this video has been terminated. Sorry about that.\u201d \\nThe video is still running on Danney Williams-Clinton\u2019s Facebook page , as well as on the YouTube channel operated by Gilbert. \\nAttempt to silence Danney Williams? \\nGilbert told WND he helped Williams file an online appeal form on YouTube asking why the account was suspended and demanding it be immediately reinstated. \\n\u201cThe behavior of YouTube/Google in suspending Danney\u2019s account is outrageous! There have been absolutely zero violations of any kind let alone a severe one of any YouTube terms or guidelines,\u201d Gilbert said. \\nHILL AND BILL EXPOSED AS \u2018PARTNERS IN CRIME\u2019\u2013 $4.95 TODAY ONLY! $21 discount on No. 1 New York Times bestselling author\u2019s brand-new election blockbuster. \\nGilbert was outspoken in charging YouTube with partisan political motives for the suspension. \\n\u201cThe only possible explanation is that the Clinton campaign requested YouTube/Google to silence Danney, \u2018to run him off the plantation\u2019 as Danney said Hillary Clinton did to him and his aunt when he was a small child and they were chased off the grounds of the Arkansas governor\u2019s mansion in 1990,\u201d Gilbert said. \\n\u201cDanney cannot be silenced any longer,\u201d he continued. \u201cHillary may try to sweep Danney Williams under the rug, but it\u2019s not going to work this time. His story is out there, and every day more and more people understand Bill and Hillary Clinton banished this young man from their family because of the color of his skin.\u201d \\nSee the Danney Williams video feature: \\nWND reported Oct. 19 that in the hours before the third and final presidential debate, attorneys for Williams were in Las Vegas to announce their intention to file a paternity suit demanding DNA evidence from the former president. \\nAccompanying the dramatic announcement was a rap music video celebrating Williams that went viral on the Internet. \\nThe mask is off! Get October\u2019s stunning pre-election Whistleblower issue, \u201cHILLARY\u2019S ULTIMATE WEAPON: America\u2019s biased and abusive news media finally abandon all pretense of fairness\u201d \\nNo definitive DNA test \\nWND reported that no DNA test was conducted in 1999, despite media reports to the contrary when Williams\u2019 claim first surfaced. \\nClinton defenders since 1999 have contended the tabloid Star Magazine conducted a \u201cDNA showdown\u201d proving Bill Clinton was not Williams\u2019 father, citing Star Magazine editor Phil Bunton saying at the time, \u201cThere was no match, nothing even close.\u201d \\nBut in an interview, Bunton told WND that no blood sample was obtained from Clinton and Star Magazine never published a story documenting a laboratory test. \\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember ever seeing any laboratory test that was done on Clinton\u2019s DNA,\u201d Bunton told WND. \\nBunton is now the owner of the Rivertown Magazine in Haverstraw, New York. \\nHe affirmed to WND that the tabloid relied on the DNA evidence for Clinton published by independent counsel Kenneth Starr, extracted from the infamous Monica Lewinsky blue dress. \\n\u201cWe got a lot of phone calls from several people in the media, including the New York Times, wanting to know when we were going to get the DNA back,\u201d Bunton recalled to WND. \u201cWe thought it was going to turn out to be his son, but when the DNA came back there was no story there even to write.\u201d \\nThe DNA test released by Kenneth Starr was the second of two DNA laboratory tests the FBI had run on Clinton, but the public record leaves no doubt that Starr withheld the more robust test conducted by the FBI. \\n\u2018Twitter rules\u2019 \\nMany other figures who have challenged the Democratic Party or the left-leaning media narrative also have run into trouble with social media outlets, including James O\u2019Keefe and his Project Veritas, which has exposed Clinton campaign voter fraud and agitation in a series of hidden-camera videos. Just as O\u2019Keefe was preparing to release new revelations of voter fraud Oct. 13, Twitter shut down his account , claiming violations of \u201cTwitter Rules.\u201d The notice said he \u201cmust delete the tweets that are in violation of our rules, which prohibit: harassing other users, threatening other users, disclosing other users\u2019 private information\u201d or violating \u201cother rules.\u201d In a statement, O\u2019Keefe said he relies on social media to \u201cbypass the media and directly reach the public.\u201d On Monday, O\u2019Keefe wrote in a tweet Project Veritas was unable to upload its third video in the series to YouTube, calling the apparent block \u201cbizarre.\u201d Earlier this month, O\u2019Keefe was forced to delete a tweet critical of a Hillary Clinton staffer to regain use of his account after it was suspended for a day. His account was suspended in the hours before a release of a new hidden-camera video that exposed a Clinton ally saying she could use executive action on guns, the Daily Caller reported . Project Veritas posted an undercover video Oct. 17 proving Hillary Clinton supporters were inciting violence at Donald Trump rallies to gain negative media coverage. Millions of viewers watched the video in just a few hours, but it didn\u2019t show up on Google\u2019s \u201ctrending\u201d list on YouTube, which Google owns, noted SilenceisConsent.net . It did, however, trend on Twitter, which Google does not own. Breitbart blogger Milo Yiannopoulos was suspended permanently by Twitter minutes before his \u201cGays for Trump\u201d party at the Republican National Convention. For some 11 months, the makers of the new movie \u201cI\u2019m Not Ashamed,\u201d about the first victim of the Columbine killers in Colorado in 1999, were unable to promote their movie through YouTube. The trailer was taken down late in 2015, and the movie\u2019s entire channel was suspended . \\nAmong the conservatives censored by Facebook : Conservative activist and Trump supporter Lauren Southern received a 30-day ban from Facebook because she complained about a friend\u2019s account being censored. Facebook locked a 12-year-old black middle schooler\u2019s account for posting a video supporting Rudy Giuliani\u2019s comment that Obama \u201cdoesn\u2019t love America.\u201d The admin of a pro-Trump group was banned for saying Trump is not anti-Muslim, but anti-ISIS.
