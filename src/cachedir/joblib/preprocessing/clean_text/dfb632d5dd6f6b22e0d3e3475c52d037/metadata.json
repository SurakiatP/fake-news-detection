Luis Gutierrez ( ) whined about Breitbart News\u2019 coverage of illegal immigrants and Muslim refugees during his recent commencement address at Cambridge College.  \u201cBreitbart and Fox News didn\u2019t invent their opinions on Mexicans and Central Americans or Muslims,\u201d he claimed the day after the London Bridge terror attacks. \u201cThey\u2019re just recycling them. \u201d He told Cambridge College\u2019s graduates, \u201cI say lift the Muslim ban and tell the Supreme Court to say it\u2019s unconstitutional and  . \u201d Gutierrez called President Donald Trump an \u201cunqualified game show host\u201d and said he saw \u201cin our country great hope and great enthusiasm for resistance against Trump\u2019s America and what it stands for. \u201d After the London Bridge attacks, Trump called for the \u201cTravel Ban\u201d as an \u201cextra level of safety\u201d and added that \u201cwe must stop being politically correct\u201d or \u201cit will only get worse. \u201d \u201cWe need to be smart, vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cWe must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people. If we don\u2019t get smart it will only get worse. \u201d We need to be smart, vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 3, 2017,  We must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people. If we don\u2019t get smart it will only get worse,  \u2014   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 4, 2017,  Gutierrez said when it comes to immigrants, religious and ethnic groups, \u201cwhatever group is coming right now,\u201d there is \u201calways a chorus\u201d of people saying \u201cthey are the wrong kind of people, they are criminal, they are disloyal, and they will ruin everything for the rest of us in America. \u201d He said they were \u201cwrong about the Irish Catholics that fled Ireland\u201d and they are \u201cwrong about the Syrian refugee Muslims that come to America seeking a place of refuge. \u201d He told graduates that when he was growing up, the New York Times said Puerto Ricans like his parents \u201cwere bringing tropical diseases\u201d to New York and would be on welfare and \u201clead a life of crime. \u201d He also said there was \u201cno one to stand up for my parents,\u201d or the \u201cChinese when they were excluded,\u201d or the Irish, or the \u201cJapanese when they were put in internment camps, or the Jews when they were turned back to certain death, or the Italians everyone made fun of. \u201d He blasted Attorney General Jeff Sessions, claiming Sessions wants to \u201croll back voting rights and basic civil rights\u201d and to \u201creignite the war on drugs. \u201d \u201cI ask you to never forget as they try to roll back voting rights and civil rights that people were murdered, churches were bombed, people were lynched, they were beaten and brutalized so we can have these voting rights and civil rights,\u201d he said. Gutierrez also claimed Sessions wants to deport as many people as possible and \u201cuse the law to paint all immigrants as criminals. \u201d He called on Trump\u2019s administration to leave illegal immigrant laborers, parents, and those working in the fields alone and \u201cgo after the criminals that are in our neighborhoods, not after the decent people trying to make a better future in America. \u201d He told the audience that he became active in politics after realizing that his fellow establishment Democrats were \u201cbigoted. \u201d Gutierrez told the graduates that in the 1980s, Democrats in Chicago asked him to vote for a Republican candidate for mayor because the Democrat, Harold Washington, was black. After Washington won the Democratic primary, \u201cthe Democratic Party of Chicago didn\u2019t like it one bit because he was black,\u201d Gutierrez said, adding that some Chicago Democrats wanted him to \u201cvote against Harold Washington because a black person might move on your block, or went to school with your kids, or maybe married your daughter or your son. \u201d He said he was not \u201cvery political\u201d at the time and just thought Washington, who would later endorse Gutierrez\u2019s candidacy for Congress, was the best person for the job. Gutierrez said \u201cthese guys from the Democratic Party\u201d were proving that \u201cracism ran deep\u201d and \u201csomething awoke in me. \u201d He said he told his neighbors \u201cwhat racist bigots they were\u201d and urged them to not let \u201cfear and bigotry\u201d determine their votes. Gutierrez told the graduates that they will have to play a role in \u201crepairing the country from the damage that is being done today\u201d and urged them to stand up \u201cagainst the people who are surrounding the president and drawn from the most discredited corners of white nationalism, corporate greed   rights,   rights,       rights, and extremists who are anti almost everything that should be top tier in America. \u201d He implied that Trump, Sessions, and White House chief strategist Steve Bannon would be uncomfortable with the \u201cdifferent ethnicities\u201d and \u201cdifferent languages\u201d in the crowd of \u201cdifferent colors. \u201d \u201cYou are the flavor of America,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are building a stronger America. \u201d Gutierrez is   for his    rhetoric, histrionics, and outlandish predictions. When House Republicans passed the American Health Care Act last month, Gutierrez compared the passage of \u201cTrumpcare\u201d to Pearl Harbor, Fort Sumter, and the invasion of Iraq. \u201cAttacking Pearl Harbor, firing on Fort Sumter and invading Iraq looked like good ideas to the perpetrators at the time,\u201d Gutierrez said. \u201cBut in the end, they were huge blunders that harmed America and came back to haunt those who to took those actions. That is how I see this health care vote for Republicans. \u201d Gutierrez also predicted on the House floor in 2014 that George W. Bush would be the last Republican president if Republicans did not work with his fellow Democrats to pass a massive comprehensive amnesty bill. Two years after the bipartisan effort to ram through amnesty failed \u2014  largely because of Breitbart News\u2019 relentless reporting on the matter \u2014  Trump was elected president.'"}, "time": 1742561884.0787733}
