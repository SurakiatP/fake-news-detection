Still concerned about his travel, they notified the National Targeting Center, a federal agency that assesses potential threats, two law enforcement officials said. It was one of thousands of such notifications every year, and a report on Mr. Rahami was passed along to the F. B. I. and other intelligence agencies. Five months later, when Mr. Rahami\u2019s father told the police after a domestic dispute that he was concerned about his son having terrorist sympathies, federal agents again examined his travel history. And again, despite Mr. Rahami\u2019s now having been flagged twice for scrutiny, the concerns were not found to warrant a deeper inquiry, one of the law enforcement officials said. Ahmad Rahami was not interviewed by federal agents. But now, the travel history of Mr. Rahami, who is accused of carrying out bombings in New York and New Jersey last weekend, has become a focus of investigators, a subject made all the more urgent by details contained in a notebook that suggests he drew inspiration largely from the Islamic State. In particular, Mr. Rahami cites a founding member of the Islamic State who called on Muslims around the world to take up whatever arms they could find and spill the blood of nonbelievers. The assessment of Mr. Rahami by the F. B. I. began in August 2014, and it once again reviewed the report by the National Targeting Center. The center was created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to function as an intelligence analysis agency within the Department of Homeland Security. \u201cBy identifying   passengers and cargo well before they would cross our land borders, sail into our ports or touch down on our tarmacs, the N. T. C. team is on duty to protect our people and economy \u201d the federal government\u2019s description of the agency says. It is unclear how much information the report contained about Mr. Rahami\u2019s activities during the 11 months he was in Pakistan, starting in April 2013, and about any other trips he made while abroad. Investigators are interested in learning more about both a   trip he made to Afghanistan and another trip he may have made to Ankara, Turkey, according to the law enforcement officials, who spoke about the continuing investigation under the condition of anonymity. The report by the targeting center did not mention any travel to Turkey, according to one of the officials. Records the New York Police Department provided to customs officials indicate that Mr. Rahami traveled to Ankara for an unspecified length of time in January 2014, according to another law enforcement official and documents obtained by The New York Times. That trip would have happened at a time when international authorities were concerned about the flow of foreign combatants to Syria to fight in the civil war there, but before the Islamic State became widely known as a source of global terrorism. The Islamic State was just making its first expansion into Iraq then, taking the city of Falluja. Mostly, the group was seen as an Islamist rebel force in the Syrian conflict that had become focused on grabbing territory from fellow opposition groups  \u2014   especially the Nusra front, which, like the Islamic State, had started as a branch of Al Qaeda but instead became an enemy. The questions about where Mr. Rahami drew his inspiration and whether he had help are at the center of the investigation even as an intense legal battle takes shape over how his case is being handled. Defense lawyers are fighting to get Mr. Rahami before a judge so he can be appointed a lawyer and have charges laid out against him, while prosecutors are pushing back. The new information being gleaned from Mr. Rahami\u2019s notebook, a copy of which was provided to The Times by another law enforcement official, who was not authorized to speak to the press, paints a substantially different picture from what could be understood by the snippets highlighted in the criminal complaint filed in federal court on Tuesday night. That summary mentioned Anwar   once Al Qaeda\u2019s leading propagandist, who is equally popular with the Islamic State\u2019s followers, but made no mention of the ISIS spokesman and senior strategist Abu Muhammad  . The pages of Mr. Rahami\u2019s journal echo the talking points of Mr. Adnani, who in May advised followers around the world to commit violence in their home countries if travel to Syria proved too difficult. Fragments of the journal  \u2014   much of it rendered illegible because of blood stains  \u2014   suggest that Mr. Rahami may have himself been frustrated in his attempts to reach Syria and was using that as justification for committing terror at home. One page has the word \u201cblocked,\u201d followed by: \u201cYou should have let us meet death overseas. \u201d On a subsequent page, he wrote \u201cback to Sham,\u201d an archaic regional name that has come to be used for Syria. He goes on: \u201cI looked for guidance and Alhumdulilah,\u201d he says, using an Arabic expression praising God. \u201cGuidance come   Sheikh Anwar   Brother Adnani   Dawla. Said it clearly attack The Kuffar in their backyard. \u201d The last sentence appears to refer to Mr. Adnani\u2019s speech this summer in which he beseeched followers to hurt unbelievers in whatever manner they could and wherever they found them. Mr. Rahami makes clear that he planned to die a martyr: In \u201cmy heart, I pray to the beautiful wise Allah   to not take jihad away,\u201d he said. \u201cI begged for shahada,\u201d he continued, using the Arabic for martyrdom, \u201cand inshallah this call will be answered. \u201d Mr. Rahami also refers to more recent comments Mr. Adnani made. \u201cIf the tyrants have closed in your faces the door to Hijrah, then open in their face the door of jihad and make their act a source of pain to them,\u201d Mr. Adnani said in a speech released by the Islamic State in May. \u201cThe smallest action you do in the heart of their land is dearer to us than the largest action by us, and more effective and more damaging to them. \u201d The authorities are also still searching for two men who apparently stumbled on one of the bombs planted in Manhattan on Saturday evening and took the explosive device out of a bag before walking away with the bag  \u2014   although officials said they were not believed to be part of the plot. On Wednesday, investigators, who believe the bag may be a valuable piece of evidence, released images of the men  \u2014   one wearing a pink golf shirt and the other wearing a light brown   collared shirt. The images were taken from surveillance video that shows the men walking on 27th Street between Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue in Chelsea between 8 and 9 p. m. on Saturday. The authorities said they did not believe the men were tied to Mr. Rahami. \u201cWe have no reason to believe they\u2019re connected,\u201d Chief James Waters, head of the New York Police Department\u2019s Counterterrorism Bureau, said at a news conference on Wednesday morning. The city police commissioner, James P. O\u2019Neill, said they were considered witnesses. Mr. Rahami is recovering in Newark from wounds he sustained in a shootout with the police in Linden, N. J. on Monday morning, when he was taken into custody. The United States attorney general, Loretta E. Lynch, said on Wednesday that the government would bring Mr. Rahami to New York City to face charges. \u201cIn the near future, it is our intention to bring the defendant to the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York,\u201d she said in remarks made in Washington. The chief federal public defender in Manhattan, David E. Patton, wrote late on Tuesday night to Magistrate Judge Gabriel W. Gorenstein, asking for a court hearing at the earliest possible time and proposing that if Mr. Rahami\u2019s health did not permit his travel to Manhattan, Mr. Patton\u2019s lawyers could represent him in New Jersey at the hearing by telephone or video. \u201cThe Sixth Amendment requires that he be given access to counsel on the federal charges, and that he be presented without delay,\u201d Mr. Patton wrote. The United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara, asked the judge to deny the request. In court papers on Wednesday, his office said that because Mr. Rahami was arrested by the local police and is being held on state charges in connection with the shootout, he is not in federal custody. That, the prosecutors argued, means that he does not yet have a right to a prompt appearance in federal court and the provision of a lawyer there. Mr. Patton responded later on Wednesday that it was \u201cundisputed that federal law enforcement are involved in detaining and questioning\u201d Mr. Rahami, and that his office had decided to represent Mr. Rahami after determining that he qualified as an indigent defendant. But the judge, in a ruling issued on Wednesday night, found that the court did not have the authority to appoint Mr. Rahami a lawyer or order an appearance at this time. Peter Liguori, the deputy public defender in Union County, where the shooting of the Linden police officers took place, said he had not received notification that Mr. Rahami had requested a lawyer. \u201cWe want to make sure that his constitutional rights are protected,\u201d Mr. Liguori said. \u201cIf he or his family has requested our assistance, we will certainly help him and make sure that he gets proper representation. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563152.4801395}
