[Asserting that Britain\u2019s relationship with its resident Muslims should be reset from scratch, Warsi demanded an end to pressure on the Muslim community, which she declared to be united in fighting terror.  Highlighting how \u201cimams and young people have taken to the streets\u201d and \u201cMuslims have raised money for the victims\u201d the former Conservative Party chairman said Muslims in Britain have played their part in opposing Islamist terror attacks and suggested anger at terror attacks is even stronger within the Muslim community than amongst the general public. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen as much anger. The language used to describe the terrorists has never been sharper, angrier, and, I would say, the level of anger towards the terrorists from British Muslims is even greater than it is within the mainstream,\u201d she said. Because of this, the Baroness urged the government to show restraint in its response to terrorism, telling The Guardian: \u201cThere\u2019s no point saying we need to go deeper into the Muslim community, because in all cases they reported them [the terrorists] it was obvious to them who was radicalised. \u201d According to Warsi, the government should instead be reviewing how it defines extremism, and consider Islamophobia to be a problem similar to that of Islamism. \u201cThere is still no definition of   extremism,\u201d she lamented. \u201cThe only definition of extremism that exists within government policy is Islamism. We also have no definition of what is Islamophobia. \u201d The Baroness also condemned calls made by policymakers for Muslims to integrate into British society. \u201cThe majority of terrorists speak good English,\u201d she insisted, pointing out that the perpetrators of many of the recent terror attacks lived Westernised lifestyles at some stage. Describing integration as \u201ca   pastime\u201d Warsi argued the only way the government can tackle the problem of extremist and \u201cseparatist\u201d religious communities in Britain is by improving Muslims\u2019 situation with regards to \u201ceconomics, poverty, life chances\u201d.'"}, "time": 1742563324.7528622}
