The road crests just before it intersects Boulevard, at a traffic light that always seems to glow red, as if to allow motorists a minute to savor the panorama before them. The striking thing is not the majesty of the skyline but its accessibility  \u2014   here I am, the city beckons, come and gawk. For from that vantage point, Atlanta just is: a   mecca, the cradle of the civil rights movement, a magnet for transplants, a college football locus, the shimmering capital of the South, and more. All of which are accurate but still do not capture the city\u2019s nuances. \u201cI don\u2019t think people understand Atlanta,\u201d Doug Hertz said. Aside from his schooling at Tulane, in New Orleans, Hertz, 64, has lived here his entire life, which makes him a rarity. The city teems with people who moved here for work, school, family, or just to live nearer to the spinach and sausage meatloaf at Murphy\u2019s. They have contributed to a booming growth  \u2014   the metropolitan area\u2019s diverse population has swelled to more than 5. 7 million, an increase of more than 1. 46 million since 2000  \u2014   that over the past few decades has also shaped Atlanta\u2019s layered relationship with its sports teams. Hertz is a limited partner of the Falcons, who on Sunday will play the New England Patriots in the team\u2019s second Super Bowl appearance since its inception in 1966. They last reached the championship game in the 1998 season, losing to the Denver Broncos, when I was a freshman at Emory University here and, more to the point, was one of those people Hertz was talking about, struggling to understand Atlanta. That September, I joined surprising brigades of Philadelphia Eagles fans invading the Georgia Dome for the Falcons\u2019 home opener. Not even three weeks later, a group of us arrived at Turner Field, maybe two hours before Game 1 of the Atlanta Braves\u2019 baseball playoff series against the Chicago Cubs, and still managed to buy tickets. Six of them. In the same row. My frame of reference was Philadelphia, whose zealous fans in analogous circumstances would never accept such apathy. Season after season, the Braves won their division, destroying the Phillies, and this is how their fans responded? \u201cAre we as rabid and overtly   like Boston or New York? No, we could be better,\u201d Gavin Godfrey, a native Atlanta journalist who chronicles culture and sports  said over lunch in Castleberry Hill, a historic arts district by the Georgia Dome. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t care, and not every town has to be held to that standard. Not every city\u2019s built the same. \u201d In the Northeast, for instance, with a deep and abiding sports culture that spans generations, and in some cases centuries, there is less competition for sports fans\u2019 loyalty. The emotional connection with college football, for instance, is not as strong as it is with some professional sports. For years, the opposite has been  \u2014   and to a degree, still is  \u2014   true of Atlanta, where on autumn Saturdays fans pack bars and living rooms, or flee for Georgia, Alabama, Auburn, Clemson, South Carolina, Tennessee, all within a   drive. \u201cMost of us, that D. N. A. is not there for professional sports franchises,\u201d Hertz said. The Falcons have built a base of loyalists  \u2014   the City Council president, Ceasar Mitchell, said he drove down to Miami for the Falcons\u2019 last Super Bowl appearance despite not having a ticket  \u2014   but so struggled to pack the Dome that home games were not shown on local television because of the N. F. L. \u2019s old blackout rule. The team\u2019s middling history has also failed to entice the local residents and persuade the newcomers to come out. The arrival of the quarterback Michael Vick, in 2001, mirrored the city\u2019s spirit at the time  \u2014   ascending, vibrant and   forward  \u2014   and his downfall, for his involvement in an interstate dogfighting ring, created tension, on a racial and cultural level, that lingered for years. Vick\u2019s successor, Matt Ryan, is his antithesis in nearly every possible way  \u2014   be it race, playing style, pedigree or personality. \u201cSome of our fans will always be proud that an   quarterback succeeded,\u201d Hertz said. \u201cWhat I think has happened over a period of time is a growing appreciation and acceptance in Matt Ryan, and that his style is every bit as spectacular on and off the field. \u201d The city\u2019s evolution, coupled with an effort by the owner of the Falcons, Arthur Blank, to promote a sense of community around the team, has strengthened its bond with the Falcons. Since 2012, when the Falcons lost in the conference championship game, the Georgia Dome, which seats 71, 250, has achieved at least 98 percent of its   capacity every year. This season\u2019s mark of 98. 2 percent, 15th among the 32 teams and the lowest since 2011, bested that of, among others, the venues for the Giants, Jets, Chiefs and Patriots. As the Braves bolt northwest for a new stadium in Cobb County, a move that has left many fans feeling betrayed, the Falcons remain moored to Atlanta. Next season they move into a new home,   Stadium. \u201cThere\u2019s something about the nature of fans here that makes them take pride,\u201d said Molly Slavin, 29, who moved here in 2012 from Illinois. \u201cAlthough it might not be in a way that translates to sports fandom as seen in other cities. \u201d Ryan Cameron, 47, an Atlanta radio personality and a   holder since 1998, explained that phenomenon like this: \u201cThere are people who will fight you about these Falcons,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re not trying to prove to you that we\u2019re so crazy. For us, it\u2019s just being loud. We don\u2019t have to brag. It\u2019s Southern charm. \u201d Still, Atlanta\u2019s gentility, a core virtue, would give way to utter delirium on Sunday  \u2014   and for weeks and months thereafter  \u2014   if the Falcons were to win. This city has been teased before, by those Braves behemoths of the \u201990s, by the Falcons in 1998, even by the Hawks, who went   two seasons ago before losing in the conference finals. Counting the futility of its two departed N. H. L. franchises, the Flames and Thrashers, Atlanta can claim only one championship  \u2014   Braves, 1995  \u2014   across a combined 167 completed seasons. Pellom McDaniels, who played the final two of his eight N. F. L. seasons with the Falcons, suggested that a victory would register a psychological impact  \u2014   an acknowledgment of the city\u2019s trajectory, from aspirational to   and mature. During the 1996 Olympics, and in the years that followed, Atlanta seemed eager to convince others that it was cosmopolitan, sophisticated, worth exploring. Even as it grapples with its identity now, reckoning with gentrification and redevelopment forces that are at once eroding and improving neighborhoods, Atlanta projects a different image  \u2014   of comfort and confidence in its direction, whatever that is. \u201cIt would be almost like a beacon,\u201d said McDaniels, now the curator of   collections at Emory, said of a potential title. \u201cThat we\u2019re working together as a community, and the success the Falcons have experienced is our success  \u2014   that we\u2019re doing something right. \u201d The term Mitchell used was runway, a point of departure for a nascent sports city that has added a Major League Soccer franchise set to begin play next season. The Falcons are thriving, interest is soaring, and from Mitchell\u2019s perspective, he sure likes the view.'"}, "time": 1742562292.6213925}
