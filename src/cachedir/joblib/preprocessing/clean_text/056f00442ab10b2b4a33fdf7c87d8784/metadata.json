[\u201cIt is pathetic that people are picking on his statement,\u201d Spicer said, when asked about Jewish critics of the statement during the White House press briefing. The statement recognized \u201cthe victims, survivors, heroes of the Holocaust\u201d but did not specifically mention \u201cJews. \u201d  Spicer said that a staffer at the White House helped draft the statement who was both Jewish and the descendant of a Holocaust survivors. \u201cThe president went out of his way to recognize the Holocaust and the suffering that went through it and the people that were affected by it and the loss of life, and to make sure that America never forgets what so many people went through, whether they were Jews or Gypsies, gays, disability, priests,\u201d Spicer said. The Republican Jewish Coalition reacted to Trump\u2019s statement, calling it a \u201cpainful omission. \u201d The Zionist Organization of America specified \u201cour chagrin and deep pain\u201d for failing to specifically mention Jews or the   that led to the Holocaust. Spicer reminded critics that Trump was very supportive of the nation of Israel, and suggested that there was a double standard in the media for the Obama\u2019s administration\u2019s failures. \u201cAt the end of the day, I don\u2019t think when you look at state of Israel or the Jewish people themselves, I think there has been no better friend to Donald Trump especially after the last eight years. The tremendous respect that he\u2019s shown Israel, the Jewish people, and to suggest anything otherwise is frankly a little disappointing. \u201d Spicer said.'"}, "time": 1742562351.8277895}
