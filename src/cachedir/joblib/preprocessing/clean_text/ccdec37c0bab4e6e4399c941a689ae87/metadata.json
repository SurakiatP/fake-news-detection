At cocktail parties where the Champagne flows, financiers have expressed bewilderment over the rise of populist groups that are feeding a backlash against globalization. In the halls of the Davos Congress Center, where many of the meetings this week are taking place, investors have tried to make sense of the political upheaval. The world order has been upended. As the United States retreats from the promise of free trade, China is taking up the mantle. The stark shift leaves investors trying to assess the new risk and opportunities in the global economy. \u201cThis is the first time there is absolutely no consensus,\u201d said William F. Browder, a   of Hermitage Capital Management who has been coming to Davos for 21 years. \u201cEveryone is looking into the abyss. \u201d The religion of the global elite  \u2014   free trade and open markets  \u2014   is under attack, and there has been a lot of   over what Christine Lagarde of the International Monetary Fund has declared a \u201c  crisis. \u201d But while all attendees in Davos have a view on the state of the world, there is little agreement on how to deal with it. The biggest concern? Finding a way to make the people who are driving populist movements feel like they are part of the global economic pie that Davos participants have created and largely own. In a Twitter post from the Swiss resort, Ian Bremmer, the president of Eurasia Group, a   firm, offered his advice: \u201cElites won\u2019t be able to manage populism until they stop seeing it as a threat and start seeing it as a symptom. \u201d If that is the case, Davos has, so far, made little progress. \u201cI want to be loud and clear: Populism scares me,\u201d Ray Dalio, the billionaire hedge fund manager, said during a panel on how to fix the   crisis. \u201cThe No. 1 issue economically as a market participant is how populism manifests itself over the next year or two. \u201d But Mr. Dalio offered little by way of a solution, beyond opining on the positive aspects of loosening regulation and lowering taxes. On the subject of rising populism, Mr. Dalio, who runs the $150 billion investment firm Bridgewater Associates, added: \u201cIt\u2019s an   way of operating. \u201d Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba in China, offered his view of the problem in the United States. Americans, he said, \u201cdo not distribute the money properly. \u201d If there was one thing that Davos attendees agreed on last year, it was that Donald J. Trump would not win the United States presidential election. And so this year, with Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration on Friday coinciding with the end of the World Economic Forum, every conversation has drifted to one question: What will the Trump presidency look like, and what will it mean for business? To many American financiers who once opposed Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy, the prospect of fewer regulations and a blank slate with a new leader has assuaged some of the fear about uncertainties. At the forum, some attendees have been thrust into a role of interpreting the   to a befuddled global elite. \u201cHe\u2019s not necessarily communicating in a way that the people in this community would love,\u201d said Anthony Scaramucci, a hedge fund regular at Davos and onetime critic of Mr. Trump who is now set to join the administration as a public liaison and adviser. \u201cBut he is communicating very, very effectively to a very large group of the population in Europe and the U. S. that are feeling a common struggle right now. \u201d Mr. Scaramucci promised that Mr. Trump had \u201cthe utmost respect for Angela Merkel,\u201d the German chancellor who was the subject of an attack by the   this week that he was in fact a champion of free trade and that he wanted to have a \u201cphenomenal relationship with the Chinese,\u201d despite his fiery   language. Soon after his appearance on a panel, Mr. Scaramucci was on a plane heading to Washington to attend Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration. But his words still resonated, mainly because they were being broadcast on a giant screen behind a coffee bar where World Economic Forum participants congregated between meetings. One Davos regular, the billionaire investor Paul Singer, did not attend this year. Mr. Singer, a vociferous critic of Mr. Trump for most of the election campaign, was instead making his way to Washington for the inauguration, having recently donated $1 million to the event. One major investor has not changed his views about Mr. Trump, however. George Soros, the investor and philanthropist who has called Mr. Trump \u201ca con man,\u201d hosted a dinner on Thursday evening in Davos, during which he said that Mr. Trump \u201cwould be a dictator if he could get away with it. \u201d This was unlikely to happen, he added, because of strong democratic institutions in the United States. For those who have been puzzled over market euphoria since Mr. Trump\u2019s election, Mr. Soros put it this way: \u201cMarkets see Trump dismantling regulations and reducing taxes  \u2014   and that has been their dream. \u201d But Mr. Soros, who became known as the man who broke the Bank of England with a bet against the British pound in 1992, added that he was convinced that Mr. Trump would fail. \u201cI don\u2019t think the markets are going to do very well,\u201d he said. When President Xi Jinping addressed the Davos forum, becoming the first Chinese head of state to do so, his message was clear: China is ready for the world stage. He championed free trade and open markets, setting the tone for the week. On the sidelines, the country\u2019s business leaders echoed that sentiment. Among the delegation that arrived in Davos with Mr. Xi were some of China\u2019s biggest business leaders including Mr. Ma, Wang Jianlin of Dalian Wanda, and top executives from Baidu, Huawei Technologies and China Telecom. Through the week, they have been meeting with investors and talking deals with erstwhile partners. With Mr. Xi\u2019s help, China has fashioned itself here as a new leader of the   world. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if it was President Xi or Ronald Reagan,\u201d joked Thomas W. Farley, president of the New York Stock Exchange. At a lunch with Mr. Ma of Alibaba, Mr. Xi was quoting Abraham Lincoln, Mr. Ma told a small group of participants on Wednesday. It was a message somewhat at odds with the roots of China\u2019s ruling Communist Party. And back in Washington, Wilbur Ross, Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for commerce secretary, did not mince words, calling China \u201cthe most protectionist\u201d major economy, setting the stage for a possible trade war. But in Davos, there was a sense that change in the economic order was afoot. Alicia B\u00e1rcena Ibarra, who heads the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, told a small group that China could soon overtake the United States when it comes to importance in Latin America. She described how on the same day last year that Mr. Trump told the world he would not sign the   Partnership, Mr. Xi arrived for a summit meeting in Chile. \u201cSo can you imagine the impact when he came talking about free trade as he did this morning?\u201d she said, referring to Mr. Xi\u2019s address on Tuesday in Davos. \u201cChina now is the   important trade partner of Latin America after the U. S. \u201d \u201cMaybe this is going to change,\u201d she added. \u201cVery soon. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628419.195958}
