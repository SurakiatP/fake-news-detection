[\u201cWhen will Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd and NBC News start talking about the Obama SURVEILLANCE SCANDAL and stop with the Fake   story?\u201d Trump asked on Twitter, accusing former Obama aides of fueling the narrative.  Trump compared the ongoing narrative to the same predictions during the election that turned out to be false. \u201cIt is the same Fake News Media that said there is \u201cno path to victory for Trump\u201d that is now pushing the phony Russia story,\u201d he wrote. \u201cA total scam!\u201d The ongoing story was fueled by Trump former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn after reports that he would be willing to testify in the congressional investigation of the campaign if granted immunity. \u201cMike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt,\u201d Trump said on Twitter this week. On Friday, Chuck Todd criticized Trump for fueling the Russia story on Twitter. \u201cObviously, the Russia cloud darkens all of the time, and all of these problems right now that they\u2019re dealing with front and center are   by one person, the President of the United States, who could not help himself with a tweet on this wiretapping nonsense,\u201d Todd said during an interview with his colleague Andrea Mitchell.'"}, "time": 1742563751.1598835}
