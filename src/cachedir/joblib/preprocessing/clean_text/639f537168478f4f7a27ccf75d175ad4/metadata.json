I know I\u2019ve seen things that aren\u2019t authentic, that we know aren\u2019t authentic, and it\u2019s not surprising.\u201d \\nJennifer Granholm, a senior adviser to the pro-Clinton Super PAC Correct the Record, was asked by CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper whether the Clinton campaign should be responding to revelations revealed by Wikileaks. \\n\u201cThere are reports that these have been doctored,\u201d she told Tapper on October 19. \u201cAnd Newsweek had found that, in fact, that was happening.\u201d \\nIn an interview with CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on October 18, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., a ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, was asked if the Russian government would impact the election by hacking voting systems. \\n\u201cWhat worries me the most \u2026 is between now and the election the Russians dump information that is fabricated,\u201d Schiff warned. \u201cTo get a last minute dump of emails that contain fabricated emails that are widely reported in the press, and there isn\u2019t enough time to fact check and demonstrate the forgery, that is what really concerns me.\u201d \\nCNN host Wolf Blitzer pushed back, \u201cBut have you confirmed that any of these emails released over the past two weeks, if you will, by Wikileaks are fabricated or doctored?\u201d \\n\u201cYou know I\u2019m not in a position to be able to do that,\u201d Schiff demurred. \\nEverything considered, the conclusion has to be that Wikileaks emails are probably authentic and if they weren\u2019t they would have been disproven a long, long time ago. The question is if are you willing to vote for a person that (we saw in the emails) is capable of doing very, bad, dirty stuff. And if the answer is yes then this country has a BIG, BIG PROBLEM. If Clinton Campaign Believes WikiLeaks Emails Are Forged, Why Don\u2019t They Prove It!? Share this: '"}, "time": 1742564464.6244884}
