He was 80. His son Karim Sidib\u00e9 said the cause was complications of diabetes, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Sidib\u00e9 started out taking pictures at weddings and christenings in the 1950s, using a Kodak Brownie camera, but after opening his own studio he branched out into a more ambitious form of social reporting. He attended   parties at which young Malians, dressed to the nines, danced the twist, the rumba and the merengue to the Beatles, James Brown and   music. This was Mali\u2019s youthquake, and Mr. Sidib\u00e9 was its photographic witness. \u201cFor me, photography is all about youth,\u201d he told The Daily Telegraph of London in 2008. \u201cIt\u2019s about a happy world full of joy, not some kid crying on a street corner or a sick person. \u201d His   photographs, surrounded by a brown tape border, were intended to be kept as souvenirs or sent as postcards. But after Western collectors discovered his work in the 1990s, they began presenting it, in enlarged sizes, in galleries and museums in Europe and the United States. He quickly became, with the older Seydou Keita, Mali\u2019s most famous photographer and an international star. Mr. Sidib\u00e9 was the first African to receive the Hasselblad Award, in 2003, and at the 2007 Venice Biennale he received the Golden Lion Award for Lifetime Achievement, the first given to either a photographer or an African artist. \u201cHe really changed the way Westerners look at Africa,\u201d said Jack Shainman, whose Manhattan gallery currently has an exhibition of Mr. Sidib\u00e9\u2019s work. (It runs through next Saturday.) \u201cHe captured the newfound freedom after colonialism  \u2014   that time, and that moment,\u201d he said. Malick Sidib\u00e9 was born in 1935 or 1936 in Soloba, a village in what was then French Sudan. He grew up in an extended family of 60 and herded sheep and cattle for his father. He was chosen by the village chief to be the first child in his family to attend school, a white institution in Yanfolila, where he learned French. His skill at drawing with charcoal earned him a place at the Sudan School for Craftsmen (now the National Arts Institute) where he was trained as a jewelry maker. A French expatriate photographer, G\u00e9rard   hired Mr. Sidib\u00e9 to decorate his combined studio and shop, Photo Service Boutique, and then took him on as an apprentice. While running the cash register and delivering photographs to customers, Mr. Sidib\u00e9 closely observed Mr. Guillat and absorbed the fundamentals of photography. Before long, he started working commercially. \u201cI did the African events, the photos of Africans, and he did the European events  \u2014   the major balls, official events,\u201d Mr. Sidib\u00e9 told the photography website gwinzegal. com in 2008. After going out on his own, he created Studio Malick in 1958, where he specialized in portrait photography with his own distinctive touch. He coaxed his subjects into more informal poses that gave his work a lively, vibrant quality. Tonally bold and beautifully composed, they often showed subjects glorying in a new possession  \u2014   a sheep or a motorcycle  \u2014   or showing off in modern clothes. \u201cGenerally, women come to get photographed as soon as they have a new hairdo or purchase a trendy piece of jewelry: a bracelet, a necklace, a handbag,\u201d Mr. Sidib\u00e9 told The Los Angeles Times in 2002. \u201cFor men, it\u2019s when they buy a new bicycle or motorcycle. \u201d He found a rich subject in the parties and dances put on by social clubs with names like the Sputniks, the Black Socks and Las Vegas. On some nights, he would attend four parties, one after the other, photographing young Malians able, for the first time, to dance close together. \u201cAt that time, young people were very motivated,\u201d he told the French newspaper Lib\u00e9ration in 1995. \u201cEvery Saturday night you had to dress elegantly. People would plan their outfits all week long. To make an impression, you had to be impeccable, with a trouser crease so sharp you could cut off the head of a chicken with it. \u201d He later produced a portrait series called \u201cVue de Dos,\u201d which showed women with their backs turned to the camera. In the early 1990s, when he had turned to camera repair work to earn a living, Mr. Sidib\u00e9 was discovered by the photographer Fran\u00e7oise Huguier and by Andr\u00e9 Magnin, a curator who had been sent to West Africa by Jean Pigozzi, a French collector. Mr. Magnin organized an exhibition of Mr. Sidib\u00e9\u2019s work at the Cartier Foundation for Contemporary Art in Paris, and a   book appeared soon after. In 1999, Jeffrey Deitch showed Mr. Sidib\u00e9\u2019s party photos in Manhattan in the show \u201cThe Clubs of Bamako. \u201d A documentary about him, \u201cDolce Vita Africana,\u201d was shown on British television in 2008. He is survived by three wives and 17 children. As he grew older, Mr. Sidib\u00e9 stopped going to the parties, unable to blend in, but he remained sentimental about the era and the free and easy way that young Malians of all classes mingled on the dance floor. \u201cI loved the music and the atmosphere, but above all I loved the dancers,\u201d he told The Telegraph. \u201cThe moments when young people dance and play as though the stars belong to them  \u2014   that\u2019s what I loved the most. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563728.0929742}
