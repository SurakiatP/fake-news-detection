But he is no longer, by his own calculations, a member of the \u201celite. \u201d Nor are the men (and the few women) now joining his inner circle  \u2014     and corporate executives, Harvard and Yale alumni, Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and Goldman Sachs bankers. The true elite apparently sits elsewhere, among those who, in Sarah Palin\u2019s notable 2008 formulation, think \u201cthat they\u2019re  \u2014   I guess  \u2014   better than anyone else. \u201d As an adjective, the word \u201celite\u201d still conveys something positive, even aspirational: elite athlete, elite model, elite travel services. But as a noun, embodied by actual living people, it has become one of the nastiest epithets in American politics. \u201cElites have taken all the upside for themselves and pushed the downside to the   and   Americans,\u201d complains Trump\u2019s adviser Steve Bannon (of Harvard, Goldman Sachs and Hollywood). In this formulation, elites are a destructive, condescending collective, plotting against the beleaguered masses outside their ranks. And in these attacks, the   and his team are deploying one of the most effective partisan political stereotypes of the modern age. For most of American history,   sentiment was a matter of up versus down, not left versus right. But about half a century ago, the conservative movement set out to claim   politics as its own. That meant redefining the term away from class and toward culture, where the \u201celite\u201d could be identified by its liberal ideas, coastal real estate and highbrow consumer preferences. The   Club for Growth captured this type in a famous 2004 attack ad, instructing the Democrat Howard Dean to \u201ctake his           New York         freak show back to Vermont where it belongs. \u201d Trump adjusted the formula for the hot topics of the 2016 campaign. \u201cI was on the right side of that issue, as you know, with the people,\u201d he boasted after Brexit, adding that \u201cHillary, as always, stood with the elites. \u201d His complaints against \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d conjure a world of absurdist campus politics, where overprivileged students squabble over gender pronouns and the fine points of racial victimization. \u201cMedia elites\u201d come in for special attack, cordoned off in pens to be mocked and jeered at during rallies, labeled both liars and incompetents. But Trump has also ventured beyond mere   turning the 2016 election into a competition between knowledge systems: the      \u201cpeople\u201d versus the    \u201celites. \u201d His campaign insisted for months that pollsters and technocrats and media would be proven wrong by his electoral success. The fact that he did win dealt a blow to an entire worldview, one in which empirical inquiry and   were supposed to triumph in the end. The question, now, is whether it\u2019s possible to run an executive branch based on hostility toward experts and professionals of all political stripes  \u2014   and how many billionaires and Ivy Leaguers Trump can appoint before this rhetorical pose begins to break down altogether. The notion that distant elites might be conspiring against the people comes straight from the Founding Fathers, whose Declaration of Independence lamented the \u201clong train of abuses and usurpations\u201d inflicted upon ordinary Americans by an arrogant British king. From there on, United States history might be seen as a repeating cycle of   revolt. The Jacksonians rebelled against the Founders\u2019 aristocratic pretensions. Northern \u201cfree labor\u201d went to war against the oligarchical slavocracy. And the Populist revolts of the late 19th century adapted this story to modern capitalism, with farmers and laborers rebelling against robber barons, bankers,   experts and   professionals. The first historians to study those Populists described them as heroic crusaders, champions of the \u201cpeople\u201d against the \u201cpowers. \u201d But by the middle of the 20th century, alarmed by the rise of fascism and homegrown demagogues like Senator Joseph McCarthy, a new generation of scholars took a more anxious view of the   spirit. In his 1955 book \u201cThe Age of Reform,\u201d Richard Hofstadter dismissed the Populists as   provincial   the latent fascists of their day. Eight years later, his \u201c  in American Life\u201d documented a dangerous suspicion of \u201cthe critical mind\u201d that seemed to course through the national culture. From his perspective, the 1952 election captured everything wrong with American political life, with Dwight Eisenhower\u2019s \u201cphilistinism\u201d winning over Adlai Stevenson\u2019s \u201cintellect. \u201d Hofstadter did not usually describe his ideal intellectually minded citizens as members of an \u201celite. \u201d That word conveyed something different  \u2014   a ruling class that held direct political and economic power. The most famous articulation of this view came from the sociologist C. Wright Mills, in his 1956 assessment of America\u2019s \u201cpower elite. \u201d \u201cThey rule the big corporations,\u201d Mills wrote. \u201cThey run the machinery of the state and claim its prerogatives. They direct the military establishment. \u201d In Mills\u2019s view, these people were tied together not by culture or ideology but by their positions at the helms of large,    institutions. As individuals, they might be Republicans or Democrats, and might live in Ohio or California. The point was that they were in charge of things. But that vision never gained much traction in mainstream politics, where a more partisan, targeted definition was starting to emerge. William F. Buckley Jr. carved out some essentials in his first book, \u201cGod and Man at Yale,\u201d drawing a neat distinction between respectable   men like himself and the socialistic eggheads of the professoriate. Ronald Reagan chose the term \u201celite\u201d to bring it all together in his famed 1964 speech, \u201cA Time for Choosing,\u201d delivered on behalf of the Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater. \u201cThis is the issue of this election,\u201d he said: \u201cwhether we believe in our capacity for   or whether we abandon the American Revolution and confess that a little intellectual elite in a   capitol can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves. \u201d Lyndon Johnson won that election in a blowout, but Reagan\u2019s vision of a smug and detached liberal elite helped spark the oncoming \u201cculture wars,\u201d pitting a supposedly indignant Middle America against the liberal snobs of the coasts. By the 1990s, with the rise of   media stars like Rush Limbaugh and Bill O\u2019Reilly, bashing the \u201cliberal elite\u201d had become a favorite blood sport of the American right. Despite all the abuse hurled their way, some \u201cliberal elites\u201d have accepted at least part of their detractors\u2019 critique, particularly on the progressive left. It was during Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency that the social critic Christopher Lasch published \u201cThe Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy,\u201d which mourned that \u201c   liberals\u201d had turned into \u201cpetulant,   intolerant\u201d scolds, thoroughly out of touch with the concerns of Middle America. Since then, the torch has passed to a younger generation of writers, including MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes, whose 2012 \u201cTwilight of the Elites\u201d called for rethinking the entire ethos of liberal \u201cmeritocracy\u201d  \u2014   a system, he argued, that tends to fuel   and incompetence at the top while offering little but contempt and dim prospects for those at the bottom. So as 2017 begins, we find ourselves in a strange and uncertain political moment. Antipathy toward a wealthy, preening managerial class seems to be gaining popularity across the political spectrum  \u2014   and, oddly, to have helped elect a wealthy, preening incoming president. Meanwhile, both liberal and conservative \u201celites\u201d are scrambling to figure out what happens if the   continues to reject basic political norms and even routine intelligence briefings. Under a Trump presidency, such \u201celites\u201d may have no choice but to attempt a radical redefinition of their role in American life. Otherwise, the man in the White House will do it for them.'"}, "time": 1742564455.9694495}
