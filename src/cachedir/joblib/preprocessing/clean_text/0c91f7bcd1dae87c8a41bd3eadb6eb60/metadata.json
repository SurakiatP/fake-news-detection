One student claimed she had been \u201cassaulted\u201d and \u201cattacked\u201d by the protesters. I was assaulted. We were attacked. But freedom will prevail. @HenMazzig did a great job sharing his story amidst a whirlwind of hate. #UCL \\n\u2014 Devora Khafi (@DevoraKhafi) October 27, 2016 \\nIn a video broadcast on Facebook from inside the hall, Mazzig tells his followers: \u201cThe situation is really out of control, we\u2019re hiding in a room and there are protesters outside. \\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that even in my days in the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] it was as bad as it is right now, it\u2019s really scary,\u201d he said. \\nHe later tweeted: \u201cI had to be rushed out of the event at @UCL with security. The campus was the war zone and the streets are the safe place. I\u2019m out. My god.\u201d \\nIn a statement, the Union of Jewish students said: \u201cThere can be no excuses for the events that took place at UCL last night. \\n\u201cThe fact that such violence and hostility took place only nine months after the incident at KCL [King\u2019s College London], with police having once again to be called, is an absolute disgrace. \\n\u201cUCL Friends of Israel were simply trying to engage students in discussion on Israel, but instead were met with a wall of intolerance and intimidation aimed at shutting down free speech.\u201d \\nEarlier this year, protesters interrupted a talk by Ami Ayalon, an ex-commander of the Israeli Navy and former head of the Shin Bet, at King\u2019s College in London. One protester was later found guilty of assaulting a Jewish student at that protest. \\nVia RT .
