I am not going to defend Donald Trump \u2014  not now, not in the future. As you probably heard, I disinvited him from my first congressional district GOP event this weekend \u2014  a thing I do every year. And I\u2019m not going to be campaigning with him over the next 30 days   \u2026     I talked to a bunch of you over the last 72 hours and here is basically my takeaway. To everyone on this call, this is going to be a turbulent month. Many of you on this call are facing tough reelections. Some of you are not. But with respect to Donald Trump, I would encourage you to do what you think is best and do what you feel you need to do. Personally, you need to decide what\u2019s best for you. And you all know what\u2019s best for you where you are.  '"}, "time": 1742563473.1714253}
