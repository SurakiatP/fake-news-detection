A spokesman for the federation that governs the boxing tournament said Wednesday that the names of the referees and judges who were dismissed, and the matches that were tainted, would not be released because he did not want to \u201cbesmirch their families. \u201d The international federation, known as AIBA, said in a statement that the committee that reviews officiating had assessed all 239 bouts at the Rio Games through Tuesday and had \u201cdetermined that less than a handful of the decisions were not at the level expected. \u201d The federation statement also said that \u201cthe concerned referees and judges will no longer officiate at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games. \u201d The move came a day after Michael Conlan, an Irish bantamweight, accused the federation of corruption and suggested that Russian boxing officials had bribed judges. Conlan\u2019s accusations came in an   tirade after he lost his quarterfinal to Vladimir Nikitin of Russia. Nikitin won a unanimous decision, but the public response to the verdict suggested that many observers believed Conlan should have won. The judges\u2019 decision in the   fight was not the first at the Rio Games to draw scrutiny. On Monday, the crowd jeered when another Russian fighter, Evgeny Tishchenko, was awarded a unanimous decision over Vassiliy Levit of Kazakhstan, who appeared to have won the bout handily. Two of the three judges who scored Conlan\u2019s bout  \u2014   Jones Kennedy Silva do Rosario of Brazil and Udeni Talik Bandara Kiridena of Sri Lanka  \u2014   returned to officiate on Wednesday. All three judges had scored the fight   in favor of Nikitin. The judges of the   fight, the heavyweight gold medal match, were also unanimous in their decision. Only one of them, however, made a repeat appearance. Armando Carbonell Alvarado of Colombia judged two fights Wednesday, while Michael Gallagher of Ireland and Kheira Sidi Yakoub of Algeria judged none. The boxing federation did not say how many decisions it deemed insufficient, and it did not specify what was wrong with those decisions. None of the decisions will be overturned, AIBA said. Coaches at the boxing venue Wednesday said that the scoring system left a lot of room for interpretation and that the judges, although well trained, were not infallible. They also expressed relief that the issue of inadequate judging was being addressed, although they dismissed the accusations of corruption. \u201cI\u2019m glad some action was taken,\u201d said Billy Walsh, a coach of the United States team. \u201cAnybody can make a mistake, but it\u2019s happened too often. \u201d Kay Koroma, who also coaches the Americans, said, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s corruption it\u2019s just bad decision making. \u201d AIBA invited people with evidence about bribing judges to step forward. \u201cWith regard to corruption, we would like to strongly restate that unless tangible proof is put forward, not rumors, we will continue to use any means, including legal or disciplinary actions, to protect our sport\u201d and the referees and judges \u201cwhose integrity is constantly put into question,\u201d the federation\u2019s statement said. The federation chooses from 36 judges and referees at the Rio Games. AIBA picks five judges to work each bout and prohibits judges from a fighter\u2019s country, or from a country in conflict with a fighter\u2019s country, from working a bout. After each fight, a computer program randomly determines which three of the five judges\u2019 scorecards will be counted. The other two scorecards are thrown out. Still, questions about judging will continue. \u201cIf they really prove that there was some kind of corruption, it is really very sad, but for now there\u2019s no proof of anything, only rumors,\u201d said Mateus Alves, a Brazilian coach.'"}, "time": 1742628342.8405426}
