I suspect that most of them would just as soon not advertise their intentions November 8. Even if they think that there is no other way to stop Trump, they understand that, by voting for Hillary, they are embarrassing themselves. \\nLawn signs apart, the evidence that Trump is kaput is, by now, overwhelming. He seems finally to have done his campaign in \u2013 to such an extent that even diehard anti-Trump fear mongers concede the inevitability of the Clintons\u2019 return to the White House. \\nTrump\u2019s campaign had been on life support for weeks when the pussy grabbing tape surfaced, followed by a seemingly endless stream of women \u2013 a dozen or so already \u2014 accusing the Donald of groping them and worse. \\nThen, in the third debate, Trump announced that he would \u201cwait and see\u201d before accepting the legitimacy of a Clinton victory. This seems to have been the final straw for all but the most bona fide \u201cdeplorables.\u201d \\nAnd so, the writing is on the wall: Hillary will win just as surely as the sun will rise tomorrow \u2013 well, not quite, but almost. \\nThere is no reason to rejoice in her victory, only in Trump\u2019s defeat. \\nAnd even that isn\u2019t as obvious as it seems . Hillary probably the lesser evil all things considered. But Trump is very likely the less dangerous of the two. \\nThe man is an adolescent in a septuagenarian\u2019s body, with a tendency to act out. But at least he is not a Russophobe or a neocon or a \u201chumanitarian\u201d intervener intent on regime change in countries that resist American domination. \\nThis would include not only the usual victims, countries incapable of harming the United States militarily, but Russia and China as well. \\nIt is relevant too that the supposed lesser evil is a committed neoliberal and a Wall Street toady, and that Trump\u2019s \u201ccrooked Hillary\u201d taunts hit the target more often than not. \\nThese considerations, and others like them, should cause concern to those who are fine with lesser evil voting in general, but who think that there are thresholds beneath which lesser evil considerations should not apply. \\nThere is no need to agonize over these issues, however; not in this case. When Trump became the Republican nominee, lesser evil arguments became moot. \\nThis would still be the case even if more voters were not quite so willfully blind to the dangers inherent in Clinton\u2019s determination to maintain American world domination by any means necessary, and to her fondness for military \u201csolutions.\u201d \\nLesser evil considerations are irrelevant because Trump is and always has been bound to lose to any Democrat, even to her. \\nI have been pressing this point and its corollary \u2014 that anti-Trump hysteria is a distraction \u2013 from Day One. As recently as a month ago, hardly anyone agreed with me. \\nIf only I had a dollar for every time I have been taken to task for not seeing the parallels between the Trump phenomenon and the rise of Nazism in the final years of the Weimar Republic! I would be a rich man today. \\nBut because it is now recognized that Trump\u2019s chances of becoming President are, for all practical purposes, nil, no one is pressing that line these days. I used to be out on a limb; I no longer am. \\nIt would be only natural to take pleasure in this turn of events, and I would \u2014 but for the fact that a Trump defeat implies a Clinton victory. That prospect is, at best, only slightly less nightmarish. \\nWorse, it doesn\u2019t seem to matter that all but the most flagrant worrywarts now finally concede that there will never be a President Trump. Liberals and centrists and even a few foolish leftists are still going all out for Hillary. \\nFrom the dead center to the soft left, the consensus view is still that now is a time to boost, not knock, Hillary\u2019s campaign \u2014 especially in the dozen or so states where the Electoral College outcomes could not have been determined years ago with absolute certainty. \\nIt is remarkable that so many people cannot let anti-Trump hysteria go; that they are so focused on Trump\u2019s misogyny, temperamental instability, and narcissistic blather that they don\u2019t see that the only thing we need fear, where Trump is concerned, is, so to speak, the fear itself. \\nHowever, in Hillary\u2019s case, there really is something to fear: that she is about to become the Commander-in-Chief of the most lethal military force in the history of the world. \\nOn that point, her supporters are in denial, and even people who know better than to support her for her own sake remain determined to waste their votes by adding to her totals. Apparently, they think that this is a way to send the message that Trumpian \u201cfascism\u201d shall not pass. \\nHow much better it would be if they would use their votes to build alternatives to the neoliberal perpetual war regime that Hillary and Bill and their co-thinkers have helped fashion! \\nThe best chance for that, at this point, is Jill Stein\u2019s campaign on the Green Party ticket. \\nStein cannot win, of course; a vote for her is only a protest vote. But there is nothing wrong with that. Hillary needs to know that she has no mandate to end the world \u201cas we know it,\u201d and this is one of many ways to convey that message. \\nPundits who claim otherwise are dead wrong. Those who pile on for Hillary are wasting their votes; protest votes aimed at Hillary are not wasted at all. \\nI would imagine that at least some Trump voters are thinking along similar lines. But the racism, nativism and Islamophobia of their candidate tarnishes the messages their votes will convey. They therefore cannot register with any real clarity. \\nThe message protest votes for Stein convey is, on the other hand, as clear and distinct as can be. \\nAnd if she garners at least five percent of the total votes cast, the Greens will have access to federal funding in future elections, and will have a much easier time gaining ballot access in all fifty states. \\nThis would not make for much of a \u201cpolitical revolution,\u201d even in Bernie Sanders\u2019 highly attenuated sense of the term, but it would make future elections less mind-numbing and degrading, and it could ultimately lead to more far-reaching transformations of the political scene. \\nNow that Trump has all but killed off the GOP, the duopoly party system is in jeopardy, and all kinds of political realignments have, at last, become feasible. *** \\nI wasn\u2019t just being contrarian when I went out on a limb about Trump\u2019s chances; and my confidence was in no way based on inferences from polling data or statistical extrapolations. \\nLet the blogosphere\u2019s \u201cpolitical junkies\u201d and the corporate media\u2019s talking heads knock themselves out with that. What they do is useful only for entertaining people who care about the horse race aspect of presidential elections. It is distressing how many Americans indulge in that spectator sport. Most of them are essentially apolitical. \\nI was confident that I was right about Trump\u2019s chances because I knew that what people tell pollsters when an election seems far off is basically irrelevant for predicting the election\u2019s outcome. Information about how they and people like them voted in the past is more relevant, but not by much. \\nThis is especially true when, as in this case, disdain for one or the other candidate, or for both, is a dispositive factor in many voters\u2019 minds. \\nI was also fairly sure that, rightly or wrongly, more people fear and loathe Trump than fear and loathe Hillary; and that, if they didn\u2019t at the outset, they would before long \u2013 because Trump was all but certain to undermine himself, and because there is so much dirt out there on the Donald\u2019s sleazy connections and moral turpitude that even God-fearing Republicans, capable of believing almost any nonsense, were bound eventually to be repulsed. \\nI suspected too that Trump never really wanted to be President; that he only got into the race to promote his brand, and because he is an egotist and publicity-hound. \\nTrump hates to lose, however \u2014 especially to the likes of Hillary \u2014 and so, at some point, he must have decided to give the campaign his all, even if it meant bringing the Trump brand down with him. \\nShould it come to that, I will shed crocodile tears for his brood, Ivanka especially. A worthwhile thing to do in the months ahead would be to work to make that happen; to do everything possible to assure that the damage done to all things Trump will be irreversible. What a delightful irony that would be! \\nThere are plenty of Hillary-haters in the Donald\u2019s base who hate Hillary because they consider her the embodiment of coercive goody-goodyism, or because they think she is disdainful of people like them (people in the \u201cdeplorables\u201d demographic), or because they think that she is too leftwing. \\nThe idea that she is too leftwing is nonsense, of course; she is not nearly leftwing enough. That anyone would think otherwise is a testament to the media\u2019s ability to shape public perceptions and to the degree of political ignorance rampant in some quarters of the American electorate. \\nBut \u201cvast rightwing conspiracy\u201d Hillary-haters are spot on right about the rest of it \u2014 and two out of three isn\u2019t bad. \\nEven so, there are better reasons than theirs to dread the prospect of a Clinton presidency. They all have to do with the service Hillary has done, and will go on doing, for the miscreants who control the commanding heights of America\u2019s and the world\u2019s capitalist order, and with her untrammeled, ideologically-driven bellicosity. \\nHillary knows how to game the system; and she and Bill know how to benefit from doing so. But, for all her vaunted \u201cexperience,\u201d she is clueless about the world. And although she and her fans boast of her \u201cpragmatism,\u201d that woman is seriously inept. \\nMost of what she undertakes to do is ill conceived, and nearly all of it turns out badly. \\nIn short, the lesser evil, if that is what she is, is a very great evil indeed. \\nIt won\u2019t take long, once she moves back into the White House and starts putting her stamp on the empire\u2019s depredations, for the scales to fall from the eyes of all but her most gullible supporters. \\nI am even more sure of this than I was of Trump\u2019s defeat, but I will take even less joy in being proved right again. What lies ahead, with Hillary in control, is too horrible to contemplate.
