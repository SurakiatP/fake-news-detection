[A host of top Brussels figures led by European Commission President   Juncker have broken with their usual protocol of not interfering in national elections and have openly backed the centrist former banker to beat   leader Le Pen.  In the European Union\u2019s corridors of power, Macron is seen as more than just a frontline defence against populism as seen with Brexit and the rise of Donald Trump in the US. To many, the    represents a breath of fresh air that could offer the embattled bloc a sorely needed chance to push ahead with unifying new projects after years of crisis. \u201cWe are crossing our fingers,\u201d one senior EU official told AFP on condition of anonymity. Macron\u2019s gruelling televised debate with Le Pen on Wednesday was \u201cwatched widely\u201d at the highest levels of the European institutions, \u201cincluding by   colleagues\u201d the EU official said. \u201cOf course we see Macron in a positive way. We have the feeling that we can work with Macron because his project isn\u2019t to destroy the EU as with Le Pen,\u201d the official added. This week EU Brexit negotiator and former French minister Michel Barnier said he would vote for Macron, saying that France would \u201cstay European\u201d under him.  \u2014   \u2018Huge sigh of relief\u2019  \u2014   Le Pen\u2019s disdain for Europe runs deep. She has long wanted France to drop the euro single currency and return to the franc, and also leave Europe\u2019s Schengen   travel zone. She has predicted the EU \u201cwill die\u201d and has vowed to hold a \u201cFrexit\u201d referendum on France\u2019s membership of the European Union. Macron, also a former economy minister, wants to bolster the EU and the eurozone. He wants to set up a separate budget for the 19 countries that use the common currency. He also proposes giving the eurozone its own parliament and finance minister. \u201cMacron\u2019s victory would bring a huge sigh of relief because of all the candidates, he is the one who backed further EU integration: no ifs or buts,\u201d said Vincenzo Scarpetta, senior policy analyst at Open Europe. In one of his last interviews before Sunday\u2019s   Macron stressed that in case of victory, \u201cI cannot keep Europe as it is\u201d. \u201cWe need a Europe that is more efficient, that protects, and that is less boring to people in their everyday lives,\u201d he told French daily Le Parisien. It was this   enthusiasm that led the EU\u2019s most senior figures to openly show their excitement when Macron narrowly beat the second place Le Pen in the first round of the French vote on April 23. \u201cGood luck,\u201d tweeted European Commission chief Juncker only a few hours after the result, in a rare break with Brussels protocol. Juncker\u2019s spokesman said France was choosing between European values and \u201cthe destruction of Europe. \u201d A spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel, Europe\u2019s most powerful leader, took a similar approach, wishing Macron the best for the next two weeks of campaigning. EU diplomatic chief Federica Mogherini even praised Macron for speaking against a backdrop of the European Union\u2019s    starred flag on the night of the first round.  \u2014   \u2018Good on paper\u2019  \u2014   But analysts warned against such unmitigated enthusiasm. \u201cReforming the EU may sound good on paper but Macron\u2019s ideas are bold,\u201d said Open Europe\u2019s Scarpetta. \u201cBut how much of this is realistic in practice as any of these would require changing the EU treaties,\u201d he said, adding that powerful Germany would also have to be on board. Analyst Henrik Enderlein of the Hertie school of governance in Berlin said that Macron left his mark in Germany as French minister, including with Wolfgang Schaeuble, the EU\u2019s most influential economic official. \u201cIt\u2019s totally against the grain to get elected in 2017 saying I want more Europe and that is what has made an impression in Germany,\u201d Enderlein told AFP. Still, turning this into deliverable policies remained a major challenge given the divisions on major issues with Berlin, including security and the economy, he added.'"}, "time": 1742563107.9135222}
