Now it is only LOGICAL to say that if these people knew, Hillary Clinton knew as well.\\nPodesta\u2019s reaction suggested he was undisturbed by the news. He replied to the email, \u201cOof.\u201d\\nPalmieri\u2019s email also included snippets of a Fox News report at the time, saying police were investigating Weiner\u2019s communication with the girl.\\n\u201cPolice on Friday afternoon came to the home of a 17-year-old high school junior to ask her about direct online communications she has had with Rep. Anthony Weiner,\u201d the Fox News article said.\\nSources close to the 17-year-old at the time told Fox News that the girl and Weiner had direct-messaged each other on Twitter.\\nThe girl openly expressed her feelings for the disgraced congressman, who followed her on Twitter. She also expressed her affinity for married men, according to Patterico.com .\\nAt the time, Wiener was married to Huma Abedin, Clinton\u2019s confidante and vice chairwoman, who is now a centerpiece of a fresh FBI investigation into the handling of classified material while Clinton was in office.\\nThe scandal was one of many committed by the former congressman, whose return to the public eye has infuriated Democrats .\\nOn Sunday, FBI Director James Comey announced that the FBI was re-opening its investigation into Clinton\u2019s private email server, having discovered new emails that \u201cappear to be pertinent.\u201d\\nWeiner is at the center of the investigation, along with his estranged wife, Abedin. Law enforcement officials told The New York Times that the emails were uncovered after the FBI seized devices belonging to Abedin.\\nComey has come under fire for his decision, but he has vigorously defended the integrity of the probe.\\n\u201cYou can call us wrong, but don\u2019t call us weasels. We are not weasels,\u201d Comey said at a House Judiciary Committee hearing in September. \u201cWe are honest people, and whether or not you agree with the result, this was done the way you want it to be done.\u201d\\nClinton has demanded the FBI \u201ccome clean\u201d with more specifics, and some Democrats have gone as far as to accuse Comey of interfering with the election and violating the Hatch Act .\\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to be distracted, no matter what our opponents throw at us,\u201d Clinton told a Florida rally.\\nAbedin separated from Weiner in August after it emerged that he was exchanging lewd messages with a woman on social media. Such behavior had destroyed his congressional career and his 2013 mayoral campaign.\\n\\n\\nSource \\n'"}, "time": 1742561676.373134}
