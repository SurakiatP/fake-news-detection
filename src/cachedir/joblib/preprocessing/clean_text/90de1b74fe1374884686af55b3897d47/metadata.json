Friday on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom,\u201d Sen. John McCain ( ) praised President Donald Trump for the missile strike on Syria in response to that country\u2019s alleged use of chemical weapons.  McCain said,  \u201cI would not expect more strikes, but I would hope that we would reinvigorate our support for the Free Syrian Army, the establishment of a   zone, and move forward. This is important, and it is an important signal, but it is the beginning of a departure from the failed policies of the last eight years, and you\u2019re not going to repair that overnight. \u201d \u201cThe other point that I would like to make really quick is that the President showed me that he has trust in what I believe is the strongest national security team assembled,\u201d he continued. \u201cI was not sure, frankly, whether he listened to them or listened to others. I think it is very clear that he values their advice and counsel, and this action is a result of the collective wisdom of some of the wisest people I have known. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742562250.3305962}
