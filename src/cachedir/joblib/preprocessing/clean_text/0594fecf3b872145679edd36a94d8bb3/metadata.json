But he recently participated in a quiet act of rebellion: He and 11 golfing buddies canceled their annual trip to a Florida resort owned by Donald J. Trump to express their disgust with his remarks about women, immigrants and minorities. \u201cFor me,\u201d Mr. Gold said, \u201cit\u2019s an ethical statement. \u201d Political demonstrations are alien to Margaret Riordan, too. \u201cI\u2019m just an old white lady from Illinois,\u201d she said. But when friends invited the    and her husband to dinner inside Chicago\u2019s Trump International Hotel and Tower, a   boycott was born. \u201cPick another place,\u201d Ms. Riordan firmly told her friends. \u201cBy crossing that threshold, I\u2019m saying Donald Trump\u2019s O. K. I won\u2019t do that. \u201d The reservation was canceled. Across the country, voters alarmed by the tenor of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and the emerging accounts of his personal conduct are engaging in spontaneous, unorganized and inconspicuous acts of protest that take direct aim at perhaps his most prized possession: his brand name. In more than two dozen interviews, they described creative methods of punishing his economic empire and expunging the   reminders of him from their lives, closets, golf bags and bookshelves over the past few months. They have thrown out  \u2014   or cut up  \u2014   Trump neckties, called off stays at Trump hotels, even stopped imbibing Trump wines. Gary Berry, a military veteran and Gold Star father whose son died while serving in the Army, used to love Mr. Trump\u2019s sparkling wines. He bought the ornate bottles, stamped with the candidate\u2019s heavily serifed surname, near his hometown, Charlottesville, Va. for special occasions like the birth of a grandchild and wedding anniversaries. That stopped the moment Mr. Trump mocked the parents of Humayun Khan, an Army captain who was killed in Iraq. \u201cI am sorry, that\u2019s just not what you do,\u201d Mr. Berry said from inside a Veterans of Foreign Wars hall, where he was chatting with fellow veterans. \u201cTrump is despicable in my mind. I\u2019m not buying Trump anymore. \u201d Organized, noisy demonstrations are a fixture of election seasons, and they have bedeviled both Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton throughout the presidential campaign. But the scattered retail rebukes of Mr. Trump are something new: independent acts of protest by everyday consumers who feel that voting against Mr. Trump would not be a sufficient reproach. They are animated, they said, not just by his inflammatory statements or allegations of predatory behavior toward women  \u2014   which he has denied  \u2014   but by the belief that the wealth that powers his candidacy was in many ways amassed on their backs, one   book, dress shirt or hotel stay at a time. \u201cThere\u2019s never been a presidential candidate that\u2019s had a product that I had bought before,\u201d said Nadav Ullman, 26, an entrepreneur who has a standing coffee meeting with his business partner in the food court of Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan. Or at least he used to. As Mr. Trump marched toward the Republican nomination, Mr. Ullman was startled by what he saw as Mr. Trump\u2019s strategy of \u201cbigotry and racism. \u201d He moved his weekly meeting outside to a bench in Central Park, grabbing coffee from a Wafels  Dinges vendor on the sidewalk. \u201cIt kind of came down to the idea that going to Trump Tower  \u2014   in a very small way, no doubt, but in some capacity  \u2014   would support him,\u201d Mr. Ullman said. Besides, he added, the coffee at Trump Tower was never very good. \u201cIt was a win on multiple levels,\u201d he said. It is difficult to measure the economic impact of such protests on Mr. Trump\u2019s   businesses. His holdings are privately controlled, and he has a   history of exaggerating his financial performance. Amanda Miller, the vice president of marketing for the Trump Organization, said in a statement on Sunday that the Trump brand \u201cremains incredibly strong, and we are seeing tremendous success across business units. \u201d The nonstop exposure provided by the presidential campaign has its upsides: Sales at Mr. Trump\u2019s winery in Charlottesville are up 55 percent, said Kerry Woolard, its general manager. A few customers have headed there straight from his political rallies, she said. But there are signs of a strain: An online travel company, Hipmunk, has found that bookings for Trump hotels on its site fell 58 percent during the first half of 2016, compared with the same period a year ago. Eric Danziger, the chief executive of Trump Hotels, said that data from sites like Hipmunk \u201cdoes not provide an accurate representation of our performance. \u201d In interviews, though, several   owners said they were avoiding Trump hotels. Elonide Semmes, the president of a Chicago branding company, has turned her anger at Mr. Trump into company policy: Expenses incurred at Trump properties shall not be reimbursed. \u201cThe one thing you can do is vote with your feet,\u201d she said. Employees at ArtMotion, a New York agency that represents commercial photographers and illustrators, have done the same. They used to routinely book rooms at Trump hotels in New York and Chicago. But in response to what they saw as Mr. Trump\u2019s factual distortions and ignorance of global affairs, the firm\u2019s partners gave their travel agent a firm decree: \u201cDon\u2019t even think of booking us at Trump hotels,\u201d recalled Billy Diesel, a  . \u201cIt\u2019s a small amount of money, but it\u2019s a way to make our voices heard,\u201d Mr. Diesel said. The amount of money is not always small. Before they rebooked at a rival golf resort nearby, Mr. Gold and his friends had planned to spend about $18, 000 on a multiday stay at Mr. Trump\u2019s Doral golf resort in Miami. They had played there for about 14 years, he said, long before Mr. Trump purchased and upgraded the property in 2012. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful place,\u201d Mr. Gold said with a sigh. The rejection has extended to brands controlled by Mr. Trump\u2019s children, whom these consumers see as aiding and abetting the candidate they increasingly revile. A few weeks ago, Natalie Davis, 50, bought a navy blue sundress from an Ivanka Trump line of clothing at Lord  Taylor in Midtown Manhattan. \u201cIt fit me really nicely,\u201d she said. But soon after, she heard Mr. Trump grimly and inaccurately describe the economic and social status of  : \u201cYou\u2019re living in your poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs,\u201d he said. Ms. Davis, who lives in New Jersey, was appalled. \u201cThe way he talked about black people  \u2014   it\u2019s like we are not human,\u201d she said. Ms. Trump had not uttered the offending words, but Ms. Davis had watched her speak for her father at the Republican National Convention. That was enough. \u201cI feel,\u201d Ms. Davis said, \u201clike she\u2019s a puppet to her dad. \u201d Ms. Davis marched back into Lord  Taylor, handed a cashier her perfectly fitting sundress and asked for a refund. \u201cThere\u2019s no way one penny of my money is going to anything with the Trump name on it,\u201d Ms. Davis said. The cashier, she said, did not seem surprised. Ms. Davis got her $120 back. Retail workers, it seems, have grown accustomed to such interactions. Ryan Whitacre said he was simply following company policy at a Marshalls clothing store in central Ohio when he asked a woman why she was returning an Ivanka Trump shirt this summer. \u201cShe told me she didn\u2019t want to support that name,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThey want to get that name away from them as much as they can,\u201d Mr. Whitacre added. The campaign spotlight is not all bad for Ms. Trump\u2019s brands: The pink dress she wore at the convention quickly sold out, her aides said. For some seething voters, returning Trump products is no longer feasible: They sit, well worn, inside their closets and dressers. So they are taking creative measures. After hearing Mr. Trump rail against the loss of American manufacturing jobs to   foreign workers, Brian Betteridge, 33, a teacher outside Philadelphia, checked the label on his Trump Signature Collection   dress shirt. \u201cMade in Indonesia,\u201d it read, according to Mr. Betteridge. \u201cI tossed it right into the garbage,\u201d he said. \u201cAt that point, it represented all of these things about him that I could not stand. \u201d The shirt had been a gift from his grandmother. \u201cI haven\u2019t told her,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742563923.3559608}
