Then, in 2014, liberal Berkeley, Calif. passed such a tax, but most people saw it as an aberration. Several measures, including one in New York, never won much support. But on Thursday, a measure to tax sweetened drinks passed in Philadelphia, one of the country\u2019s largest cities  \u2014   and also one of its poorest. Indeed, raising revenue was the winning argument in Philadelphia. Jim Kenney, the mayor, took a different tack from that of politicians who have tried and failed to pass   taxes. He didn\u2019t talk about the tax as a   measure designed to discourage   soft drinks. And he didn\u2019t promise to earmark the proceeds for health programs. Instead, he cast the soft drink industry as a tantalizing revenue source that could be tapped to fund popular city programs, including universal prekindergarten. \u201cThis is the beginning of a process of changing the narrative of poverty in our city,\u201d he said in a news conference after the vote. The advocates who have pushed for the policy say the victory is a sign of growing public acceptance of soft drink taxes and presages more such measures around the country. Though city officials didn\u2019t talk much about the health consequences of soda, experts said that sugary drinks\u2019 increasingly bad reputation made it an appropriate political target. \u201cIf we go five years ahead and look back, I think this is going to be a watershed moment,\u201d said Jim Krieger, executive director at Healthy Food America, an organization that is helping cities around the country that are considering soda taxes. \u201cThis is going to really provide momentum. \u201d San Francisco Oakland, Calif. and Boulder, Colo. are considering soft drink taxes this year. Mr. Krieger said the list of interested cities included some that were as large and diverse as Philadelphia. Mr. Kenney said he hadn\u2019t yet spoken directly with officials from other cities, but he had advice for them. \u201cTie your efforts to tangible initiatives that people care about,\u201d he said in his news conference. \u201cWhen it comes up, acknowledge that it is a good thing to drink less   beverages, but tie it to things that people care about. \u201d The Philadelphia tax of 1. 5 cents an ounce will apply to all sugary or artificially sweetened drinks sold by distributors in the city. It is expected to increase prices  \u2014   the tax is about 30 cents for a   drink, or $2. 16 for a  . If passed on to consumers, the increase is expected to substantially reduce sales of sweetened drinks. The city finance department estimates it will raise $91 million a year. Sugary drinks have been linked to health problems, including obesity, diabetes and tooth decay, but the public health effects of the taxes are still unclear. Philadelphia is likely to become the site of public health research. Thomas Farley, the city\u2019s health commissioner, said the city had already planned to measure the tax\u2019s immediate effects on sales.   studies will measure any impact on obesity. The soft drink industry and its allies, including the Teamsters union and local grocers, spent nearly $5 million on lobbying and advertising to fight the tax in Philadelphia. They held rallies and demonstrations downtown and ran   ads on television and the radio, right up until Thursday\u2019s final vote. They branded the drinks tax measure a \u201cgrocery tax,\u201d suggesting that more food products were next. The soda industry has argued that Philadelphia\u2019s politics are unusual and that the vote here can\u2019t be seen as predictive. The American Beverage Association, a trade group, has vowed to fight the measure in the courts. \u201cIt\u2019s still a bad idea,\u201d said Lauren Kane, a spokeswoman for the group. \u201cPeople still oppose it. Nothing has changed. \u201d Thursday, the industry and its allies vented frustration. Daniel Grace, the secretary and treasurer of the Teamsters local, said advocates had \u201csnookered City Council,\u201d and he described the tax as a \u201cbrazen cash grab from one industry. \u201d The promise of prekindergarten energized the city\u2019s education advocates, who joined with public health advocates. The coalition spent about $2 million on advertisements, according to Kevin Feeley, a spokesman for Philadelphians for a Fair Future, a group supporting the tax. That total included $1. 6 million in donations from Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, who has long supported soda taxes. But Mr. Kenney\u2019s focus on revenue also allowed him to help cut deals with skeptical city councilors. Ultimately, the soft drink tax revenue won\u2019t pay just for prekindergarten, but for a host of city programs, reflecting the priorities of the council members who voted for it.'"}, "time": 1742562272.4820101}
