[Reuters commissioned the poll and then tried to hide the resulting good news for Trump under a misleading headline, \u201cExclusive: Only a third of Americans think Trump\u2019s travel ban will make them more safe. \u201d  But the most direct question in the poll showed a   advantage for Trump\u2019s policy, of 48 percent support to 41 percent opposition.  However, that      \u201cblocking refugees and banning people\u201d question is an unreliable guide because most Americans want to help both their fellow Americans and foreign strangers. Also, Americans\u2019 generous attitude ensures that they are often reluctant to display favoritism to their fellow nationals or opposition to foreign migrants, so pollsters often use indirect questions to tease out their hidden views. One indirect question used by Reuters\u2019 pollster asked if the United States should \u201climit the number of refugees allowed into the country. \u201d That question scored 66 percent support to 26 percent opposition, showing overwhelming yet hidden support for Trump\u2019s new policy of welcoming a limited inflow of refugees while excluding hostile migrants.  Better still for Trump, the \u201cstrong\u201d support for his   policy was three times as large as the \u201cstrong\u201d opposition, 32 percent to 10 percent, and the GOP voters\u2019 response was very similar to the response from   independents. Trump\u2019s policy has ignited a debate on refugee inflows from Muslim majority countries. But the core part of Trump\u2019s policy is a shift towards rejection of   migrants whose culture and ideas are hostile to Americans\u2019 traditions of personal independence and small government. Here is the critical passage from Trump\u2019s   immigration policy: In order to protect Americans, the United States must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles. The United States cannot, and should not, admit those who do not support the Constitution, or those who would place violent ideologies over American law. In addition, the United States should not admit those who engage in acts of bigotry or hatred (including \u201chonor\u201d killings, other forms of violence against women, or the persecution of those who practice religions different from their own) or those who would oppress Americans of any race, gender, or sexual orientation. The American public\u2019s contradictory emotions slide in various directions, depending on minor changes to questions. For example, when asked by Reuters\u2019 pollster if the U. S. should \u201copen our borders to refugees of foreign conflicts,\u201d the percentage of respondents strongly supporting an apparently unlimited number of refugees jumped up to 19 percent, almost double the 10 percent in the prior \u201climit the number of refugees\u201d question.  That question and answer suggests that Americans do not recognize the \u201copen borders\u201d term as a     for mass migration by 100 million people from Africa, Arabia and Asia. The new poll was conducted by Ipsos polling, from Jan. 30 to Jan. 31, on behalf Thomson Reuters. It included roughly 1, 201 adults, with 453 declared Democrats, 478 declared Republicans, and 149 declared independents. Many polls show that the public wants the federal government to cap or shrink immigration. For example, a September poll by Ipsos showed that only 12 percent of respondents strongly opposed plans to \u201cchange the legal immigration system to limit legal immigration. \u201d Four times as many, or 57 percent, back reductions in legal immigration, while 13 percent did not take a position. In 2016, under policies set by President Barack Obama, roughly one new immigrant or foreign   joined the U. S. workforce for every two Americans who entered the workforce.
