During a Friday afternoon MSNBC appearance, Sharpton railed against elected officials and consultants who want Democrats to \u201ctry and become elephants with donkey skin on,\u201d emphasizing that it was pointless to appeal to \u201cArchie Bunker\u201d voters who support President Donald Trump. Sharpton insisted that these \u201cArchie Bunker\u201d voters will never cast their ballots for Democrats. He made his remarks a day after Republican Greg Gianforte won his special election for Montana\u2019s open House seat by six points even after he allegedly   a reporter the day before the election. In a recent interview with BuzzFeed, Sharpton said Hillary Clinton\u2019s biggest mistake in 2016 \u201cwas that she did not mobilize in the black community. \u201d \u201cYou lost Michigan, by what, 15, 000, 20, 000 votes? You could\u2019ve got that if you mobilized two housing projects or three churches,\u201d he told the   outlet. \u201cNever touched them. So in many ways I think that the whole question of, \u2018Oh we gotta reach out to the Appalachian and the blue collar workers and stop the identity politics\u2019  \u2014   well, that\u2019s one strategy. But what I\u2019m saying is that you never worked your own base. You took your base for granted, so it\u2019s not that you need to go another way, you didn\u2019t identify with those in identity politics, that\u2019s why you had the lowest turnout you had around blacks in a long time. \u201d Sharpton said though Clinton came to his National Action Network convention, her campaign \u201cnever engaged us in the campaign. \u201d \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s where they did the wrong math in the Clinton campaign. They assumed that we\u2019ll go get all of this because everybody will stay here: young voters, black voters, Latino voters, like Obama, and it didn\u2019t happen,\u201d he said. As Democrats plot their electoral strategies for 2018 and 2020, the party is split between those who want to double down on identity politics and those who think Democrats need to appeal more to   white voters.'"}, "time": 1742561652.9972293}
