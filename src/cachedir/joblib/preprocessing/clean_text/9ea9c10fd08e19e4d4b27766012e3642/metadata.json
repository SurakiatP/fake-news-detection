A nation that built its brand around the world as open to the world\u2019s needy and ambitious is now viewed, after Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration executive order, as closing its doors in a way it never did even after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Twenty years of    efforts to rebuild a relationship with Mexico  \u2014   on trade, counterterrorism and drug interdiction  \u2014   crashed into an avoidable blowup with the Mexican president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who canceled his visit here. When Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain came for what appeared to be a largely successful visit, Mr. Trump\u2019s first by the leader of a close ally, she spoke of maintaining sanctions on Russia until it met its commitments on Ukraine. Mr. Trump stayed silent. After he spoke the next day to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, the official readout provided by the White House made no mention of Ukraine, or of the   operation to influence the American election that led President Barack Obama, in his last days in office, to issue new sanctions. Perception is different from reality. It is possible that when viewed from a distance of a few years, Mr. Trump\u2019s pronouncements about \u201cextreme vetting\u201d and his rush to push some of America\u2019s most experienced career diplomats out of their jobs will look like a   blitz intended to send a message to the world that he meant what he said when he talked about \u201cAmerica First. \u201d In a statement on Sunday, Mr. Trump appeared to try to soften his action, arguing that \u201cthis is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting. \u201d He promised to \u201cfind ways to help all those who are suffering,\u201d words that were missing on Friday when he announced that all refugees from Syria would be barred from entry to the United States, indefinitely. \u201cIt\u2019s one week in,\u201d Robert M. Gates, the former secretary of defense and C. I. A. director, said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday. \u201cEvery administration I\u2019ve worked for begins with a flurry of executive orders\u201d meant to distinguish itself from it predecessor. But Mr. Gates, who has served eight presidents, of both parties, quickly added that Mr. Trump risks accelerating a sense of an America that is pulling back and putting up walls, leaving a power vacuum around the globe. \u201cThat vacuum will not be filled by benign forces,\u201d he said. Two other prominent, establishment Republicans, Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, called the lumping together in the immigration order of a major adversary, Iran, with an ally, Iraq, one of many reasons that the moves are \u201ca   wound in the fight against terrorism. \u201d Mr. Trump is hardly the first president to announce shifts in policy that surprised allies and upturned the existing order. President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s decision to abandon the gold standard and to recognize China were shocks to the system. So was President George W. Bush\u2019s decision to invade Iraq, though it was telegraphed for more than a year, as was Mr. Obama\u2019s decision to strike a nuclear accord with Iran and to reopen diplomatic relations with Cuba. But in the case of Mr. Trump, there is a sense that the rush for change has superseded a study of unintended consequences. The ban on immigration and visitors from seven nations came with minimal, if any, input from the State Department about the regional fallout  \u2014   as did Mr. Trump\u2019s declaration that he intends to move the American Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. The absence of advance thinking about how to deal with green card holders and Iraqi interpreters who were promised entry to the United States in return for their service to American troops forced the White House to amend its interpretations of the order less than 48 hours after Mr. Trump signed it. It was all symptomatic of a new president eager to tweet first and work out details later. \u201cThis is policy by thunderbolt,\u201d said Joseph Nye, a Harvard professor who served as the head of the National Intelligence Council and has written extensively on how the United States can gain leverage from its \u201csoft power\u201d  \u2014   the attractiveness of its culture and democracy. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to tear up 70 years of foreign policy until you think hard about what replaces it. \u201d But inside the halls of the State Department, where Rex W. Tillerson, the pick for secretary of state, has just begun to find his way around, there is definitely the sense among career diplomats that this is Year Zero. Last week, the \u201clanding team\u201d of Trump designees told several of the department\u2019s most senior diplomats  \u2014   career officials, some with decades of service  \u2014   to clear out of their offices. Almost all had submitted their resignations, the protocol when administrations changed, but had volunteered to stay on for a month or two until successors were appointed, to ensure that State Department facilities were safe, American citizens were evacuated from perilous places and passports were issued. The Trump team made it clear it had no interest in transitions. (Mr. Tillerson also never met    with his predecessor, John Kerry, before the inauguration.) It was not exactly a purge, but the fact remains that some of the government\u2019s most experienced diplomats have moved on  \u2014   including some of the   women in the department. Among them is Anne Patterson, 67, the assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs and a former ambassador to Pakistan and Egypt, two of the biggest tinderboxes Mr. Trump will face. Victoria J. Nuland, 55, one of the department\u2019s top Russia experts and former ambassador to NATO, who dealt with the Ukraine crisis, decided to retire after concluding there was probably no place for her in Mr. Trump\u2019s administration. Such a housecleaning leaves open the question of whether Mr. Tillerson, who has extensive experience abroad as chief executive of Exxon Mobil but none as a diplomat, will have the kind of help he needs in a very different kind of enterprise than negotiating on behalf of the world\u2019s largest oil company. In such an atmosphere, even seemingly routine moves  \u2014   like the reorganization of the National Security Council  \u2014   take on a political air. On Sunday, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist, and chief ideologue, Stephen K. Bannon, was designated a permanent member of the \u201cprincipals committee\u201d of the National Security Council, putting a political aide on par with the secretaries of state and defense. Meanwhile, the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff appeared to be downgraded, told to attend only when their issues were on the table. \u201cThis is stone cold crazy,\u201d Susan E. Rice, the national security adviser until earlier this month, wrote in a Twitter post. \u201cWho needs military advice or intell to make policy on ISIL, Syria, Afghanistan, DPRK?\u201d she said, using acronyms for the Islamic State and North Korea. Mr. Trump\u2019s answer is simple: When you have come to upend the establishment, the establishment must vacate the premises.'"}, "time": 1742562530.0040214}
