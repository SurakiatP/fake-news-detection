Poor Carville was clearly apoplectic at the news of Comey\u2019s announcement, describing it as an assault or attack on American democracy multiple times. \\n\\nHe was also adamant about who was responsible. \u201cComey was acting in concert and coordination with the House Republicans,\u201d Carville said. \u201cWe also have the extraordinary case of the KGB being involved in this race and selectively leaking things from the Clinton campaign that they hacked,\u201d he claimed. \\nCarville was very upset that Comey\u2019s announcement thrust Clinton\u2019s surely unethical and likely illegal behavior back into the spotlight. \u201cIt would seem to me that the FBI shouldn\u2019t be getting rolled by the House Republicans, that\u2019s what happened here \u2014 there\u2019s nothing else that\u2019s going on \u2014 and in the meantime \u2026 democracy is under assault by the KGB,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me that\u2019s something we ought to be talking about.\u201d \\n\\nUnfortunately for Carville, whilst fanciful tales about time-traveling Soviet spies and an FBI on the GOP\u2019s take certainly make for interesting entertainment, they pale in importance to the real life stories of Clinton\u2019s brazen lawlessness. \\nWhen the MSNBC anchor dared raise the fact that Democrats were praising Comey only a few months ago when he announced the FBI\u2019s decision not to recommend indictment, Carville went into a stuttering, sputtering fit. Hillary Reboots \u2018Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy\u2019 Playbook Clinton camp set to wage effort to discredit FBI Director Comey and criminal probe as politically motivated \\n\\n\u201cWhen the facts change I change my mind,\u201d Carville said. \u201cWhy are you defending this, why are you sitting here as American democracy is under assault?\u201d he asked angrily. Faced with the Democrats\u2019 clear double standard \\n\\n\u201cThis is an unprecedented event that was done on behalf of the House Republicans,\u201d Carville repeated. \u201cAnd as we know the KGB is all over this election and this is what we are talking about? We ought to be talking about our democracy is under assault right now and what we are going to do about it, not [what somebody said in July] about James Comey.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742562269.7012005}
