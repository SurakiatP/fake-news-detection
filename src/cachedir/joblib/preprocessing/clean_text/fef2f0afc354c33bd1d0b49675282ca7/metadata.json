Trump on Sunday during a commencement address that could be the beginning of a forceful effort to help elect a Democratic successor as president. Addressing Rutgers University\u2019s class of 2016 at the school\u2019s 250th anniversary commencement, Mr. Obama never mentioned Mr. Trump by name. But his target was clear, and his assessments earned raucous cheers from the graduates. \u201cThe world is more interconnected than ever before, and it\u2019s becoming more connected every day,\u201d Mr. Obama told the graduates. \u201cBuilding walls won\u2019t change that. \u201d Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has proposed building a wall between the United States and Mexico and forcing Mexico to pay for its potential multibillion dollar construction costs. Mr. Trump has also denounced much of the modern international trading and economic system, and he has proposed banning Muslim visitors and immigrants from the country, at least temporarily  \u2014   all ideas Mr. Obama condemned on Sunday. Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump have exchanged zingers before. Mr. Trump was a leading voice questioning Mr. Obama\u2019s birth location and citizenship, and Mr. Obama has responded by taking particular delight in skewering Mr. Trump. But Mr. Obama is altering his stump speech in important ways to go after Mr. Trump. As his remaining time in office draws to less than a school year, Mr. Obama has alternated between mild and mock horror, pointed humor and a touch of disbelief in his attacks on the Republican  . \u201cWe live in an age of global supply chains, and a lot of folks have legitimate concerns with the way globalization has progressed,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cBut the answer isn\u2019t to stop trading with other countries. In this global economy, that\u2019s not even possible. \u201d Mr. Obama said that isolating and disparaging Muslims was not only a betrayal of American values but \u201cwould alienate the very communities at home and abroad who are our most important partners in combating violent extremism. \u201d Wearing a crimson robe with black sashes and a purple doctoral hood that a fierce wind kept blowing off his shoulders, Mr. Obama told the graduates that the knowledge they had earned through years of studying was something they should insist political leaders value and possess themselves. \u201cFacts, evidence, reason, logic, an understanding of science  \u2014   these are good things. These are qualities you want in people making policy,\u201d Mr. Obama said, adding later, \u201cIn politics and in life, ignorance is not a virtue. \u201d Mr. Obama seemed to especially take pleasure in advocating the use of facts in politics while speaking to an academic audience. His point with such arguments is usually to press for action against climate change, one of the signature policies of his administration and one that nearly all climate scientists support. But while Mr. Obama mentioned climate change, he also used his points about facts and experience to take yet another swipe at an unnamed Mr. Trump. He noted that when people get sick, they want an experienced doctor to treat them when they fly, they want experienced pilots. \u201cAnd yet in our public lives, we suddenly say, \u2018I don\u2019t want somebody who\u2019s done it before\u2019?\u201d he asked in derision. Mr. Trump has no experience as a politician, a quality that has been viewed as one of the most important reasons for his success as a presidential candidate. Mr. Obama came to Rutgers after students, faculty members and even relatives of students spent the past three years lobbying the White House for him to speak on this anniversary for the school. \u201cThe truth is, Rutgers, I came here because you asked. You are the first to launch a   campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cEmails, letters, tweets, YouTube videos. I even got three notes from the grandmother of your student body president,\u201d Mr. Obama said, drawing laughter. \u201cAnd I have to say that really sealed the deal. That was smart because I have a soft spot for grandmas. \u201d But Mr. Obama made clear that Rutgers was precisely the kind of institution that he wanted to celebrate. Last week, Mr. Obama spoke at the commencement of Howard University, a historically black university, and told the next generation of black leaders that passion must be tempered by strategic thinking and a willingness to compromise. Rutgers, one of the first nine   institutions in the American colonies, \u201ccould be the most diverse student body in America,\u201d he said. And he likened Rutgers\u2019 long history of success with that of the country as a whole. And while he celebrated that history, he made clear to the graduates that no period in history was as prosperous as this one. \u201cThe good old days weren\u2019t all that good,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cIn fact, by almost every measure, America is better and the world is better than it was 50 years ago or 30 years ago or even eight years ago. \u201d One of Mr. Obama\u2019s frustrations during his presidency has been the country\u2019s persistently sour mood despite what he sees as a remarkable turnaround in the nation\u2019s economy, the passage of   health care legislation and the nation\u2019s   strength militarily. He cited those accomplishments and many others, including declining rates of crime, teenage pregnancy and poverty, as well as improvements in life expectancy, the status of blacks and Latinos and clean energy. \u201cMarriage equality is the law of the land,\u201d he added, to robust cheers. As he often does in such speeches, Mr. Obama told the graduates that they needed to participate in the political process and be satisfied with incremental change. Democrats generally fare better than Republicans in   elections, and while young people overwhelmingly support Democrats, they rarely vote. So Mr. Obama and Michelle Obama, the first lady, always urge student audiences to show up at the polls on Election Day. \u201cBecause apathy has consequences,\u201d the president said. He said changes, even small ones, were worth fighting for. \u201cI always tell my daughters, \u2018Better is good,\u2019\u201d Mr. Obama said near the end of his speech, adding, \u201cDon\u2019t waste your time waiting. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562617.0931358}
