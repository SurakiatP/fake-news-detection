There have been several reports that Broward County Election Director Brenda Snipes has met with Hillary Clinton behind closed doors and several sources of claim to be coming forward with pictures soon. \\nThe Conservative Treehouse reports this may be part of a bigger voter fraud scheme. \\nAnyone with any political knowledge is aware the best chances for Hillary Clinton in Florida come from two specific counties, Broward and Dade. It is not coincidental that both counties continue to be the historic nucleus of multiple voting irregularities. \\nThis year is no different. In a recent series of events Broward County is at the epicenter of another voting malfunction. However, this one might not be a mistake, it might be by design. The essential outline of the current year concern surrounds a scheme to present double voting to benefit Hillary Clinton: \\nBroward County officials intentionally screw up sending out mail-in ballots to a key demographic constituency. The correction therein then allows the same official to send a second set of ballots to the same constituency thus providing two possibly counted ballots for each voter. \\nSounds incredible. Maybe. But as incredulous as it sounds that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s taking place. \\nThe issue stems around the second page of the ballot for a ballot initiative, a specifically democrat ballot initiative, an amendment to Florida\u2019s constitution, Amendment #2, whereby legalized marijuana is up for a vote. \\nThe Amendment #2 ballot initiative is the long-standing objective of John Morgan an Orlando lawyer who is the name and face behind the Morgan and Morgan law firm. \\nJohn Morgan, lives in Orlando and is a big donor and benefactor of the Democrat party. You might remember it was John Morgan who hired former governor Charlie Crist ( Republican, then Independent, then Democrat ) after his failed Senate bid. John Morgan is also attached to the Multi-billion Pigford settlements via a partner in his law firm Greg Francis. \\nJohn Morgan is also a key donor , financial bundler, and contributor to President Obama and Hillary Clinton. Morgan has hosted numerous high-dollar ( $30k+ per plate ) events for Obama and this year f or Hillary Clinton . \\nLegalized marijuana sales in Florida, under the auspices and ruse of \u201cmedical marijuana\u201d, has been a goal of Morgan for several years. Politically, Morgan also wants to be FL Attorney General and/or U.S Attorney General. \\nBy structuring a flawed ballot distribution in Broward County both Hillary Clinton and John Morgan can achieve both their objectives. A rather brilliant Win/Win. \\nThe scheme works by \u201caccidentally\u201d failing to print one of the pages in a strategic regional area guaranteed to be dominated by Clinton/Morgan supporters. It takes only a modicum of \u2018 plausible deniability \u2018 to provide the arms-length distance from a scheme. \\nSending out \u201csome\u201d or \u201ca few\u201d ballots with a blank page, a \u201cflaw\u201d per se\u2019, then resending an entire second set of ballots (173,000) to the full area, provides multiple opportunities. \\nSee if you can spot how it plays out. Beginning with the small flaw: \\n( Miami Herald October 20th ) The Broward County elections office, already under scrutiny for two blunders in the past few weeks, played defense once more Friday as its supervisor came under fire after mail-in ballots turned up that skipped a constitutional amendment question on medical marijuana. \\nOne of the organizations supporting the amendment, NORML of Florida, has asked for an emergency hearing after filing a lawsuit on what it called an error that could be \u201ccatastrophic and cataclysmic.\u201d A Broward judge has scheduled a hearing for 10 a.m. Tuesday. \\n\u201cIn reviewing and reviewing and going back looking through our ballots we found Amendment 2 on all 92 of those styles so it\u2019s still not totally clear why this voter did not have Amendment 2,\u201d Snipes said. She added that she believes that the faulty ballots were test samples for Oakland Park. After a city candidate dropped out, she said, her office recoded the Oakland Park ballot, leading to a creation of a new test ballot. Her office did not notice the missing marijuana question on the test ballots, which are not supposed to be sent to voters but somehow were. \\nAt a maximum, Snipes said, only seven of those test ballots were printed. She allowed reporters, as well as a representative from United for Care, the political committee backing the amendment, to review the 92 ballot styles Friday. \\nBut amendment backers were skeptical of Snipes\u2019 explanation after it became clear that she didn\u2019t know precisely what went wrong or exactly how many ballots lack the closely watched amendment. Broward is the most left-leaning county in the state, and amendment backers are counting on its voters for a large share of support. \\n\u201cWhat continues to concern me is it does not seem that the supervisor knows for certain the extent of the problem,\u201d said Ben Pollara, campaign manager for United for Care. \u201cThey have a strongly held belief it is this very isolated incident [Snipes] described this afternoon but they don\u2019t know for sure. Until they do I remain incredibly concerned.\u201d ( read more including video and press conference) \\nOK, so that\u2019s the ground work for the \u201csmall flaw\u201d in Broward County ballots . Note in the video Ms. Brenda Snipes positioning 173,000 ballots as the full distribution to be concerned with. \\nNow lets look at what they finally claimed was the origin of the problem , and the solution they came up with : \\n( Via Sun Sentinel october 24th ) Broward elections workers checking mail-in ballots from Oakland Park found none without the statewide medical marijuana question that had been missing from at least two ballots. \\nBut an early voter at the Fort Lauderdale Regional Library/Art Serv said her ballot was missing Amendment 2. \\nThe Broward Supervisor of Elections Office said there was no evidence of a incorrect ballot. The pages were stuck together because of humidity in the machine, said spokeswoman Tonya Edwards. \\n\u201cThere was an issue with the humidity so it printed twice on one side instead of on the other,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cOn one page it was blank and on the other page was the actual amendments.\u201d \\nDebbi Ballard, 57, of Fort Lauderdale, said she filled out her ballot and realized the amendment wasn\u2019t there. \u201cI checked once, twice, three times,\u201d she said. \\n\u201cThis is an irregularity and needs to be addressed,\u201d Ballard said. She said she pointed out the error to voting staff and received a new ballot. \\nBallard said she was not satisfied with the \u201cpages stuck together\u201d theory and has lost confidence in Broward\u2019s Supervisor of Elections Office. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t explain it,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause the layouts were completely different.\u201d \\nBroward Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes said there wasn\u2019t an amendment issue. \u201cIt\u2019s a moisture issue,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I can understand why the voter, you know, became concerned or upset, because there\u2019s been so much about it out there in the air. It\u2019s a moisture issue, it\u2019s a moisture issue.\u201d \\nLast week, two voters in Oakland Park reported that the amendment had been left off their mail-in ballots. \\n[\u2026] Snipes said that voters who are missing the amendment, all of whom should be in Oakland Park, will get new ballots . Edwards said later that Snipes was aware of the early voter\u2019s issue.
