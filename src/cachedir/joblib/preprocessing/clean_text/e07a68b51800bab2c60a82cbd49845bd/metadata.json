G. B. T. inclusion in the event. The governor, Charlie Baker, and the mayor of Boston, Martin J. Walsh, both announced their decision to skip the parade over its decision to bar the group, OutVets. In a statement, the mayor encouraged the public to do the same. \u201cI will not tolerate discrimination in our city of any form,\u201d Mr. Walsh said. \u201cI will not be marching in the parade unless this is resolved. Anyone who values what our city stands for should do the same. \u201d Mr. Baker said it \u201cdoesn\u2019t make any sense\u201d to exclude the group. \u201cIf veterans\u2019 groups aren\u2019t allowed to march in that parade for whatever reason, then I\u2019ll probably do something else,\u201d he told reporters on Wednesday. The controversy began on Tuesday night when the parade organizers, the South Boston Allied War Veterans Council, voted 9 to 4 to exclude OutVets. Dan Magoon, the executive director of Massachusetts Fallen Heroes, resigned as the parade\u2019s chief marshal over that decision. Mr. Magoon, who voted in favor of including OutVets, said there was \u201cstrong opposition\u201d to the group\u2019s participation. He said opponents cited the group\u2019s late application as well as a past code of conduct violation. \u201cThey didn\u2019t tell us anything detailed or specific about the incident, but it was enough to swing the vote,\u201d Mr. Magoon said. According to the code of conduct published by the Allied War Veterans Council, the parade does not ban L. G. B. T. groups, but it also \u201cwill not allow the advertisement or display of one\u2019s sexual orientation as a topic that should in any way be depicted as a theme of our parade. \u201d Bryan Bishop, the founder of OutVets, said parade organizers told him on Wednesday night that a small rainbow patch that has been part of the group\u2019s logo since 2014 was found to be in violation of that rule. \u201cMy jaw just dropped on the floor,\u201d he said. Marchers from his group wore jackets with the logo in 2015 and 2016 without incident, he said. Organizers told him Wednesday that they had violated the rules two years in a row. \u201cThey said people felt that rainbows represent the gay community,\u201d Mr. Bishop said. \u201cI told them if that\u2019s the case, then every picture of a rainbow in the parade that leads to a pot of gold needs to be removed. \u201d Mr. Bishop said parade organizers told him they would allow his group to march only if it removed the rainbow patch or did not display its logo, which he refused. \u201cThey refuse to change their minds,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are stuck in an arcane time in our history. \u201d He said parade organizers also complained that allowing OutVets to march had cost them support from the Roman Catholic Church. Leaders of the veterans council did not respond to emails or return phone calls on Wednesday evening seeking comment. \u201cThis is an issue that didn\u2019t need to exist because OutVets has marched consecutively for the last two years with no incident,\u201d Mr. Magoon said. It was the first L. G. B. T. group to march in the Boston parade. The decision in Boston represents a backsliding on gay and transgender rights in one of the most liberal cities in the country, and it appeared to take many there by surprise. Michael Flaherty, a Boston city councilor, said the decision was \u201cdisgusting,\u201d adding, \u201cWhoever voted for this is a nitwit. \u201d United States Senator Edward J. Markey said he would boycott the parade, too, unless the veterans council changed its decision, which he called \u201ca stunning and inexplicable reversal. \u201d \u201cWe all believed we\u2019d moved beyond a time when the St. Patrick\u2019s Day Parade was used as an occasion to exclude people, in this case veterans, from our community just because of who they are or who they love,\u201d he said in a statement. Sponsors of the parade began to drop out on Wednesday as well. The supermarket Stop  Shop said it would no longer sponsor the parade, and   said it was \u201cevaluating\u201d its continued participation in the event. As politicians and sponsors began to object, The Associated Press reported on Thursday that the veterans council would hold an emergency meeting on Friday to reconsider their decision. Gay and transgender groups campaigned for years to be included in St. Patrick\u2019s Day parades in Boston, New York and other cities. Organizers historically told gay and transgender people they could not march under their own banner but could march with other groups in the parades, which celebrate Irish heritage and were traditionally organized by   groups often deeply influenced by the Roman Catholic Church. When an L. G. B. T. group marched in the New York parade with Mayor David N. Dinkins in 1991, spectators shouted epithets and threw beer bottles at them for nearly 40 blocks. The mayor told reporters the experience reminded him of marching in Birmingham, Ala. during the civil rights movement. \u201cI knew there would be deep emotions, but I did not anticipate the cowards in the crowd,\u201d he said. The conflict over the New York parade came to a head in 2014 when Mayor Bill de Blasio boycotted it  \u2014   the first mayor since Mr. Dinkins to do so  \u2014   over its ban on L. G. B. T. groups. Guinness, a leading sponsor of the parade, also cut ties that year. The first L. G. B. T. group marched in New York in 2015. Niall O\u2019Dowd, the publisher of several   news media outlets, said some   in Boston objected to the participation of OutVets in 2015, but when the group returned in 2016 \u201cthere was no problem. \u201d He compared opponents of L. G. B. T. participation in the parades to Japanese soldiers who refused to surrender at the end of World War II and kept fighting for decades from isolated positions. \u201cThis is just insane. This fight has been won. There\u2019s no question,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone thought this would be part of the usual historical progression, but now they\u2019ve banned them again, which is extraordinary. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562223.4567134}
