Her most recent broadcast was one of her best. I mean, come on \u2014 how often do you get to hear the word \u201cdauphin\u201d on late night television? Bee: Trump Is The \u2018Dauphin Of Breitbartistan\u2019 \\nSamantha Bee, decked out in a \u201cNasty Woman\u201d shirt, wasted no time getting the jabs in at Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on her Monday night show. In her opening segment, she likened Trump to the cartoon Wile E. Coyote, ever-thwarted by the Road Runner, saying : \u201cOh, Donald. It\u2019s like you spotted Hillary painting a tunnel entrance onto a mountain, called her on it, and then ran at it anyway.\u201d \\nBee pivoted to Trump\u2019s controversial statement from the last debate, in which he said he may not accept the election results. Bee\u2019s response to that? \u201cIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, you\u2019re not the president. You\u2019re just the Dauphin of Breitbartistan. Concede, don\u2019t concede, we don\u2019t give a fuck. We\u2019ll be busy swearing in the 45th president.\u201d \\nBoom. \\nBee was, of course, referring to the Breitbart News website \u2013 an online haven for neo-Nazis run by Trump\u2019s campaign CEO, Stephen Bannon . She Didn\u2019t Stop With Trump \\nSamantha Bee\u2019s comic hammer came down on all Republicans, as it so often does. She ripped into them having the nerve to call out Trump\u2019s statement as horrifying after eight years of unprecedented obstructionism. \\nHonestly, I don\u2019t think my words can do Samantha Bee justice. Just watch her opening segment below and remember how lucky we are to have her voice. \\nWarning: This video contains graphic language that may not be suitable for all audiences. \\nFeatured Image via screenshot from YouTube video \\nNote: The character of Pepe the Frog was created in 2005 by Matt Furie and has been co-opted by the alt-right.
