Soon after the painting\u2019s completion in August 2014, the retaliation began as planned in the aide\u2019s diary, which surfaced in November in the investigation into the corruption scandal that has led to Ms. Park\u2019s impeachment trial. First, a   civic group sued Mr. Hong on charges of defaming Ms. Park. Then his work was excluded from the Gwangju Biennale, South Korea\u2019s   international arts festival, an act Gwangju\u2019s mayor later admitted was due to government pressure. The retaliation did not stop there, Mr. Hong said. \u201cDozens of conservative activists showed up in front of my apartment like a goon squad, shaking my photographs and calling me a \u2018Communist painter,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI received death threats on the phone. \u201d As it turned out, Mr. Hong was one of thousands of artists reportedly blacklisted by the government of Ms. Park, whose powers have been suspended as she faces an impeachment trial on charges of corruption and abuse of power. The blacklist is just one element in the sprawling case that has infuriated the public and prompted national introspection about South Korea\u2019s young democracy and its authoritarian past. On Thursday, three of Ms. Park\u2019s former aides, including one of her former culture ministers, Kim   were arrested on charges of blacklisting cultural figures deemed unfriendly and barring them from   support programs. So far, two versions of the blacklist have been reported by the news media, citing anonymous sources. Officials, including the special prosecutor in the case, Park   have confirmed the existence of the blacklist but have not released it. A 2015 version of the list included more than 9, 000 people, according to news reports. The list contained some of South Korea\u2019s most beloved filmmakers, actors and writers, including the director of \u201cOldboy,\u201d Park   and the \u201cSnowpiercer\u201d actor Song  . Officially, Ms. Park has made promoting movies and other cultural products one of her key priorities. But secretly, her government has blackballed artists, reviving a practice of past military dictators like her father, Park   and in so doing has \u201cseriously undermined the freedom of thought and expression,\u201d the special prosecutor\u2019s office said. The revelations about the cultural blacklist added a new layer of notoriety to the scandal surrounding Ms. Park, and prosecutors planned to use the list to help strengthen the impeachment charges against her. When the National Assembly voted to impeach Ms. Park last month, it accused her of conspiring with her longtime confidante, Choi   to solicit bribes from businesses and crack down on uncooperative officials and journalists. The special prosecutor is investigating whether Ms. Park and Kim    \u2014   her former chief of staff, who was depicted as one of the dark forces in Mr. Hong\u2019s painting  \u2014   were involved in the blacklisting of artists. Both Ms. Park and Mr. Kim, her former chief of staff, have denied involvement. However, another of Ms. Park\u2019s former culture ministers, Yoo   said the list was dictated by the president\u2019s office. On Monday, the current culture minister, Cho   said, \u201cI understand how pained artists must have felt when excluded from government support just because of their political and ideological beliefs. \u201d For many South Koreans, news of the blacklisting of artists reawakened memories from the nation\u2019s dictatorial past. Ms. Park\u2019s father, who ruled South Korea from 1961 to 1979, censored newspapers and imprisoned dissident writers and publishers. Chun   a military dictator during the 1980s, banished a comedian from TV after people compared the appearances of the two men. (Both were bald.) Subsequent governments were accused of favoring   scholars and civic groups when doling out research projects and subsidies. Under Ms. Park\u2019s conservative predecessor, Lee   some celebrities and journalists deemed progressive were barred from   broadcasters. But the latest revelations marked the first time the existence of an extensive government blacklist was revealed since South Korea moved toward democracy in the late 1980s. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor to be on the list,\u201d Ko Un, one of South Korea\u2019s   poets, told the broadcaster SBS last month, when it reported on another version of the list. \u201cThis shows how disgusting the government is. \u201d Under Ms. Park, whose leadership style is often compared to her father\u2019s, rumors of a blacklist have been circulating for years. The rumors intensified after two   theatrical directors were mysteriously booted from government subsidy programs: one had campaigned for Ms. Park\u2019s main opponent in the 2012 election another had produced a play spoofing Ms. Park and her father. And after the organizers of the Busan International Film Festival screened a documentary that delved into what it called Ms. Park\u2019s botched response to the Sewol ferry disaster in 2014 in which more than 300 people died, the festival lost half of its government funding. Mr. Yoo, the former culture minister, said Mr. Kim, Ms. Park\u2019s chief of staff at the time, began ordering the culture ministry to blacklist certain artists in 2013. Last month, a former aide to Ms. Park was indicted on charges of colluding with her in an attempt to blackmail a vice chairwoman of CJ, which runs South Korea\u2019s biggest film studio, into retiring in 2013. The company had angered Ms. Park\u2019s office by financing a movie about her ideological enemy, the former President Roh   Mr. Yoo said in a radio interview last month. \u201cI thought this kind of thing happened only under the past military rule,\u201d CJ\u2019s chairman, Sohn   told a parliamentary hearing last month. Mr. Yoo said that an early version of the blacklist he saw in June 2014 included hundreds of artists. Shortly before he was replaced a month later, Mr. Yoo said he met Ms. Park to warn against the list. (Ms. Park has denied being warned.) By 2015, the list had ballooned to include more than 9, 000 visual artists, musicians, actors, film and musical directors, and writers deemed critical of Ms. Park, particularly those who took aim at her handling of the ferry disaster or who were suspected of supporting her rivals, according to the Hankook Ilbo newspaper, which published what it claimed was the list in October. Ms. Park\u2019s office zealously pursued her opponents after the ferry disaster, according to the diary of Kim   the former presidential aide who detailed the retaliation against Mr. Hong. The ferry tragedy is a central motif in Mr. Hong\u2019s painting. During a meeting of senior presidential aides in 2014, Mr. Kim, Ms. Park\u2019s chief of staff at the time, called for a \u201ccombative response to leftists in the cultural and art circles\u201d and ordered the aides to \u201cdiscover their networks,\u201d according to the diary. He compared progressive teachers and journalists \u201cto poisonous mushrooms. \u201d The diary also recorded instructions to punish artists who satirized Ms. Park, conduct a \u201cloyalty check\u201d of senior government officials, \u201cintimidate\u201d courts of law and \u201cinduce\u201d scholars to write   newspaper columns. \u201cMake them afraid to challenge the president,\u201d Mr. Kim was quoted as saying in a diary entry dated July 4, 2014. He has denied giving such an order and said that the diary did not faithfully record what was actually discussed during the aides\u2019 meetings. The author of the diary, Kim   died in August, but prosecutors said they found it useful in building their case against Ms. Park. Mr. Hong, the painter, said that for poor artists, being cut off from travel and other government support programs could be crushing. In 2015, Mr. Hong was invited to show his painting at a Berlin arts festival. But no domestic logistics company would transport the work for fear of government retaliation. Mr. Hong had to travel alone and hurriedly repaint a copy of the original in Berlin. He also suspected the government was behind a tax audit of his wife\u2019s clinic last year. \u201cIt makes me shudder that Park   and her cronies tried to tame artists by holding back a pittance of government support while they themselves pocket millions,\u201d Mr. Hong said. \u201cThey showed how depraved political power can be. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628402.4125397}
