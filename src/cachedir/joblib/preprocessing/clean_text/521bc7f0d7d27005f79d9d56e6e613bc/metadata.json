C.  \u2014   Under a clear twilight sky, well after Hurricane Matthew broke up and moved offshore, this tiny town was drowning. Homes were submerged and deserted after officials evacuated about 400 people by boat and by truck, and Main Street was a canal of   water. Frank Horne, 79, drove a large tractor slowly through the water inundating the lovingly maintained main drag. Most of the awnings and street lamps were eerily intact, even as merchandise and storm debris floated through businesses like the Ellis Meares  Son hardware store and community pillars like the town hall. At the Ford dealership, every vehicle was partly underwater. \u201cMy granddaughter has a beauty shop right up on the right,\u201d Mr. Horne said grimly on Monday, pointing toward Carolina Class Salon. \u201cIf that hardware store goes, the town\u2019s gone. That\u2019s the only thing holding us. \u201d Hurricane Matthew\u2019s disastrous turn over North Carolina lashed some areas with more than a foot of rain and left behind swelling rivers and streets like rivers throughout much of the region south and east of Raleigh. By Tuesday, emergency crews in trucks, boats and helicopters had rescued more than 2, 000 people from houses, porches and rooftops. Here in Fair Bluff, they included James Thomas, 57, who cannot walk because of a spinal cord injury, but was hoisted into a boat by firefighters on Sunday. The upheaval had a special sting here in a town that has tried, with no shortage of grit and heart, to remake itself in the face of economic shifts that have sucked the life out of so many other small towns. Now, Fair Bluff\u2019s future looks even more challenging. The extent of the damage here and in places like Lumberton, Fayetteville, Goldsboro and Pinetops sank in like a recurring bad dream on Tuesday after a storm that killed 17 people in the state and left commerce and daily life in some areas grinding to a halt. \u201cCertain parts of the state, we\u2019re going through recovery at this point in time,\u201d Gov. Pat McCrory said on Tuesday morning. \u201cCertain parts of the state, we\u2019re still going through ongoing floods. And now, we have other parts of the state that are about to deal with some very serious circumstances, especially along two of our major rivers. \u201d Mr. McCrory said that a state trooper had shot and killed a man on Monday after a \u201cconfrontation\u201d  \u2014   the authorities later said he had become \u201chostile\u201d and displayed a handgun  \u2014   in Lumberton, a site of major flooding north of here. He added that state officials were especially worried about residents farther northeast, in and near Goldsboro, Greenville and Rocky Mount. With flooding expected in the state throughout the week, he urged drivers to use caution. \u201cThere are going to be conditions during the next 72 hours which will be extremely dangerous,\u201d Mr. McCrory said. As residents evacuated and the authorities imposed curfews, officials issued advisories to boil tap water for drinking and school districts canceled days of classes. The airport in Greenville, a city of about 91, 000, will be closed until Oct. 20. \u201cA lot of communities are dealing with terrible flooding,\u201d President Obama said on Tuesday night in Greensboro, where he addressed a campaign rally for Hillary Clinton. \u201cLives have been lost, and so the entire country has been thinking about North Carolina. \u201d The flooding this month has evoked memories of Hurricane Floyd, which devastated parts of the state 17 years ago. \u201cThe scars of the memories of 1999 are still there, and they\u2019re fresh,\u201d said Tony Sears, the city manager in Kinston, where the Neuse River is expected to approach a record height by Saturday. \u201cAnd people are thinking back to how difficult of a time that was, and they\u2019re anticipating that this time. \u201d In Fair Bluff, with a population of about 900, officials said the water rose further on Tuesday, to levels no one here had seen. The town has a poverty rate of 33 percent, and its population has decreased over time, with older residents dying off and the young moving away. Some in the area wondered if all of the flooded businesses, most operated by longtime residents, would reopen. \u201cBecause it\u2019s so small, income levels are so low here, it\u2019s going to be hard for them to justify putting the money back in to reopen their businesses,\u201d said Brenden Jones, a candidate for state representative from nearby Tabor City and an owner of a funeral home in Fair Bluff that was spared from flood damage. Fair Bluff was incorporated in 1873, with the Lumber River  \u2014   currently inundating the town  \u2014   and a railroad as its lifeblood, supporting logging and trade. By the 1970s, it was small but thriving, sustained by tobacco farms and warehouses, said Ken Elliot, 48, who like many people here grew up in a tobacco farming family. When those tobacco farms began to go under, people found new work. Mr. Elliot became a firefighter and paramedic, and he spent last weekend rescuing his friends and neighbors from the encroaching floodwaters. Others found work in a new plant that makes vinyl building materials. The town, which has a museum, built a visitors\u2019 center and a new river walk, earnestly seeking tourists. And locals fought tooth and nail to sustain a vital Main Street as the town\u2019s heart despite pressure from stores like Walmart and Family Dollar. \u201cThat\u2019s what keeps this area above water,\u201d Mr. Elliot said, adding that the town would pull together once again. Would everything reopen? \u201cI\u2019m not going to lie,\u201d Mr. Elliot said. \u201cThat\u2019s always a worry. \u201d Others were confident the town would prevail. Kathy Ashley, 55, the vice president of the Chamber of Commerce and Mr. Horne\u2019s daughter, said that Fair Bluff was a   trading post and had shown a penchant for reinvention ever since. \u201cWe got history,\u201d Ms. Ashley said. \u201cWhen the water goes away, we\u2019re going to sweep it out and we\u2019re going to make our town better. \u201d Critical to the floods\u2019 devastation was how surprising they were: Many people did not expect Hurricane Matthew to drop nearly as much rain as it did, and they prepared only for a small storm. \u201cThis is a river town,\u201d said Rodney Singletary, 47, a behavior specialist at the county school who took a boat back to his house on Monday to pick up medication for a relative. \u201cWe\u2019re used to the river. We just don\u2019t think that it\u2019s going to look like that. \u201d His family had evacuated on foot over the weekend, walking along the railroad tracks as water rose on both sides. \u201cWe had to get out of here,\u201d he said. \u201cI have to say, I was a little frightened. \u201d At a shelter at West Columbus High School in a neighboring town, Cerro Gordo, Fair Bluff residents described harrowing rescues and domestic crises. Twyla Denise King, 44, worried about the five dogs she had left at home in the evacuation. And Simon Stephens, 33, who called for a rescue of himself, his wife and his two children when the waters rose because he cannot swim, wondered what had become of his house and two cars. \u201cWords cannot describe it,\u201d said Mr. Stephens, a fabricator. \u201cHouse paid for, cars, one car paid for, only $800 left on the truck. \u201d So when it was time for a shelterwide meeting, Tom Guilliams of the Salvation Army opened with a prayer. \u201cWe thank you for getting us out of the waters and onto the land,\u201d he said. \u201cBe with us through the storm. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564311.0860367}
