Tillerson, the former Exxon Mobil chief executive, who has all but covered himself in a cloak of invisibility in his first six weeks as secretary of state. Describing his impressions, Mr. Kissinger, perhaps America\u2019s most famous diplomatic strategist, chose his words judiciously. \u201cThe normal tendency when you come into that job is to increase your visibility and to show that you are present and in charge,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cHe wanted to first inform himself of all the nuances. I was impressed by the confidence and   that he showed. \u201d But in the Washington of Donald J. Trump, where foreign policy proclamations often appear first on Twitter, and where White House advisers are still battling for dominance, this approach can be seen as brilliant, mystifying or a prescription for powerlessness. Mr. Tillerson has skipped every opportunity to define his views or give guidance to American diplomats abroad, limiting himself to terse, scripted statements, taking no questions from reporters and offering no public protest when the White House proposed cutting the State Department budget by 37 percent without first consulting him. He suffered in silence, State Department officials said, when President Trump called, in a    way, to reject Mr. Tillerson\u2019s choice for deputy secretary of state. He has been absent from the White House meetings with key world leaders, and when the State Department issued its annual report on human rights  \u2014   usually a major moment for the United States to stand up against repression around the world  \u2014   he skipped the announcement. Defenders say Mr. Tillerson has been accomplishing far more behind the scenes, including arranging for the first trip of a Saudi foreign minister to Iraq in more than a    \u2014   his first foray into the sinkhole of Middle East politics. \u201cHe\u2019s already developing plans to begin ratcheting back Putin\u2019s nefarious behavior,\u201d Senator Bob Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in an interview  \u2014   steps that would represent the first known effort by the new administration to face off against President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. \u201cHe\u2019s won status and respect of the president, of McMaster, and talks all the time to Jared,\u201d the senator said, referring to the national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, and Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s    who has emerged as a prominent voice on American foreign policy. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t mind at all that these stories are being written about him being missing,\u201d Mr. Corker, a Tennessee Republican, said about Mr. Tillerson. \u201cWhen he\u2019s ready to talk, you will be very highly impressed. \u201d On Tuesday, Mr. Tillerson will leave for his first truly fraught diplomatic mission: a trip to Japan, South Korea and China, at a moment when open conflict with North Korea is a growing possibility, and when the administration is planning Mr. Trump\u2019s first meeting with President Xi Jinping of China. The trip is so vital that the \u201cprincipals\u201d committee of the National Security Council is set to convene on Monday to discuss the North Korean threat and how to deal with China, so that Mr. Tillerson speaks from a consensus strategy. But do not expect to hear much about that strategy from the secretary before he arrives in Asia: The State Department has told reporters that they cannot ride on the plane. The decision appears to be unprecedented for a major diplomatic trip  \u2014   even four decades ago, when Mr. Kissinger was conducting shuttle diplomacy in the Middle East and opening up China, he was delivering spin to reporters on the plane and offering up diplomatic tutorials. \u201cAll his predecessors have traveled with press,\u201d said R. Nicholas Burns, who served as spokesman, ambassador and under secretary of state in both Republican and Democratic administrations. Failing to do so, he noted, creates the risk that the secretary of state will be defined by the country he is visiting  \u2014   especially a place like China. Within the State Department, Mr. Tillerson, 64, got off to a promising start with a warm, humble greeting to staff members in the drab headquarters\u2019   foyer on his first day on the job. He talked about his upbringing and his wife\u2019s belief that he had been preparing for this job his whole life, even if he had not known it. But few have heard from him since. Those who have say they regard him as an impressive manager who knows how to run a crisp meeting, take in a variety of views and give little away about his own. \u201cHe forces everyone to boil their memos down to a page or two, so they really have to think about what their message is,\u201d said one official who has dealt with him frequently in recent weeks. \u201cHe\u2019s already met with two of the most important Chinese officials. He knows a lot about some countries many secretaries don\u2019t know about,\u201d including Indonesia and others that have energy assets. He understands what embassies do, because Exxon Mobil often relied on them for help. But he is also introverted, a bit standoffish. He never met in person with John Kerry, his predecessor. \u201cThese guys came in to drain the swamp,\u201d one career State Department official said, \u201cand it\u2019s clear that they are under orders not to cooperate or deal with swamp creatures. \u201d So, for thousands in the State Department, Mr. Tillerson has come to be viewed as the phantom of Foggy Bottom, scarcely glimpsed and known mostly for his directives to wipe out some of the department\u2019s top jobs. Longtime career officials who expected to stay in their jobs or remain long enough to show their successors the ropes were ousted in Mr. Tillerson\u2019s first two weeks. He is talking to members of Congress about further cuts, and while there are plenty of opportunities in a department that has not exactly embraced technological change, the major reductions proposed by the administration are a nonstarter with many lawmakers. The biggest concern among diplomats and many in Congress is that when Mr. Trump talks about bolstering America\u2019s commitment to its national security, he does not have diplomacy in mind. Longtime diplomats often cite  \u2014   or email to reporters  \u2014   a line uttered four years ago by the new defense secretary, Jim Mattis, when he was in charge of Central Command. \u201cIf you don\u2019t fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition,\u201d Mr. Mattis said at the time. As one diplomat who has met frequently with Mr. Tillerson since he took office noted recently, \u201cRex clearly agrees with that. He just won\u2019t say it. \u201d (A senior State Department official said Mr. Tillerson did say it, to Mr. Trump, over dinner a little more than a week ago.) On his first trip, to Europe, Mr. Tillerson went out of his way to reassure allies of the United States\u2019 commitment to NATO, doing little to repeat the \u201cAmerica First\u201d notion that Mr. Trump has promoted. In Asia, Mr. Tillerson is scheduled to visit the Demilitarized Zone on the border with North Korea, and it seems almost unimaginable that he would repeat Mr. Trump\u2019s warning as a candidate that the United States may pull back from the region. So why is the man many in the State Department call T. Rex so quiet? Secretaries of state from both parties have relished their role as chief spokesman for American values. Madeleine K. Albright made her name describing the United States as the \u201cindispensable nation\u201d that needed to intervene in the Balkans. Colin L. Powell took the lead in making the case for invading Iraq (words he later regretted). Hillary Clinton, under President Barack Obama, highlighted human and women\u2019s rights in particular. Mr. Kerry narrated his own role as relentless negotiator, sometimes using background briefings to read aloud from copious handwritten notes he had taken while haggling over the Iran nuclear deal and the removal of chemical weapons from Syria. In indiscreet moments, he talked about his differences of view, mostly on Syria, with Mr. Obama. There are several theories about Mr. Tillerson\u2019s reticence. One is that his silence is highly strategic: He wants to cement key relationships in private, make sure he is aligned with a mercurial president and let the policy process at the National Security Council play out before making any grand pronouncements. The second is that he is waiting for the battles at the White House to burn out. In short, he wants to sidestep Stephen K. Bannon, the president\u2019s top strategist, who believes that China\u2019s rise can be halted and that Iran should be vigorously confronted, and work with Mr. Mattis, Mr. Kushner and Mr. McMaster. Mr. Corker said that \u201che\u2019s already reached an agreement with Mattis to come to agreement and present ideas together,\u201d something that Condoleezza Rice and Mrs. Clinton often did with their defense counterpart, Robert M. Gates. The third is that he sees the job as more akin to what he did at Exxon Mobil: Cut your deals, say as little as possible and take the heat. One of the first tests may come in the arena of human rights, where he caused alarm during his confirmation hearings in January by declining to criticize the killings ordered by the Philippine president, Rodrigo Duterte, in an antidrug campaign. Speaking out against repression has always been fraught Mr. Kerry often danced around the topic when visiting Egypt. But Mr. Tillerson took up the issue on a recent call with Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, who was pressing him to link arms sales to Bahrain  \u2014   home of the Fifth Fleet of the United States Navy  \u2014   to measurable human rights improvements. \u201cWhen we get the notifications of arms sales, it will be interesting to see if he has something to say on the issues we talked about,\u201d Mr. Cardin said in an interview. He attributed some of Mr. Tillerson\u2019s problems to the fact that \u201che doesn\u2019t have his team in place. \u201d \u201cHaving a subcabinet to back up your views,\u201d Mr. Cardin added, \u201cgives you the confidence to be more direct. \u201d Clearly, Mr. Tillerson will not have much of a staff for a while not a single under secretary or assistant secretary  \u2014   the people who make the policy wheels turn  \u2014   has been nominated, and only a couple of ambassadors have been named. Some say the problem is not with Mr. Tillerson, but those he works for. \u201cRex Tillerson is off to a slow start, but the White House is partly to blame,\u201d said Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, whom the administration briefly considered for a top post. \u201cThe president needs to give the secretary the staff he wants protect, not decimate, his budget and make clear to the world that it is the secretary and no one else who speaks for the administration when it comes to foreign policy. \u201d Mr. Kissinger, at 93, is philosophical about most things, including Mr. Tillerson. \u201cI would expect that as foreign policy evolves, Rex Tillerson will become an increasingly prominent exponent of it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I first came to Washington\u201d as national security adviser to President Richard M. Nixon, \u201cyou would find me mentioned in The New York Times maybe 10 times. \u201d A computer index suggests that the actual number in his first year was around 228, but who\u2019s counting? Mr. Tillerson, in a sign of progress, has already exceeded that figure this year.'"}, "time": 1742562221.4791136}
