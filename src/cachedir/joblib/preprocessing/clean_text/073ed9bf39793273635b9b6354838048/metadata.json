Bannon has great admiration for a provocative but disputed theory of history that argues that the United States is nearing a crisis that could be just as disruptive and catastrophic as the most seminal global turning points of the last 250 years. This prophecy, which is laid out in a 1997 book, \u201cThe Fourth Turning,\u201d by two amateur historians, makes the case that world events unfold in predictable cycles of roughly 80 years each that can be divided into four chapters, or turnings: growth, maturation, entropy and destruction. Western societies have experienced the same patterns for centuries, the book argues, and they are as natural and necessary as spring, summer, fall and winter. Few books have been as central to the worldview of Mr. Bannon, a voracious reader who tends to see politics and policy in terms of their place in the broader arc of history. But what does the book tell us about how Mr. Bannon is approaching his job as President Trump\u2019s chief strategist and what he sees in the country\u2019s future? Here are some excerpts from the book, with explanations from The New York Times. The \u201cFourth Turning\u201d authors, William Strauss and Neil Howe, started using that phrase before it became a pop culture buzzword courtesy of HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones. \u201d But, as the authors point out, some winters are mild. And sometimes they arrive late. The best thing to do, they say, is to prepare for what they wrote will be \u201cAmerica\u2019s next rendezvous with destiny. \u201d In an interview with The Times, Mr. Bannon said, \u201cEverything President Trump is doing  \u2014   all of it  \u2014   is to get ahead of or stop any potential crisis. \u201d But the magnitude of this crisis  \u2014   and who is ultimately responsible for it  \u2014   is an unknown that Mr. Trump can use to his political advantage. This helps explain Mr. Trump\u2019s tendency to emphasize crime rates, terrorist attacks and weak border control. The rhythmic, seasonal nature of history that the authors identify foresees an inevitable period of decay and destruction that will tear down existing social and political institutions. Mr. Bannon has famously argued that the overreaching and ineffective federal government  \u2014   \u201cthe administrative state,\u201d as he calls it  \u2014   needs to be dismantled. And Mr. Trump, he said, has just begun the process. As Mr. Howe said in an interview with The Times: \u201cThere has to be a period in which we tear down everything that is no longer functional. And if we don\u2019t do that, it\u2019s hard to ever renew anything. Forests need fires, and rivers need floods. These happen for a reason. \u201d One of the authors\u2019 major arguments is that Western society  \u2014   particularly American culture  \u2014   has denied the significance of cyclical patterns in history in favor of the more palatable and   belief that humans are on an inexorable march toward improvement. They say this allows us to gloss over the flaws in human nature that allow for bad judgment  \u2014   and bad leaders that drive societies into decline. Though he probably did not intentionally invoke Mr. Strauss and Mr. Howe, Mr. Trump was channeling their thesis when he often said during his campaign, \u201cThe American dream is dead. \u201d One of the scenarios the book puts forward is one in which leaders who emerge during a crisis can revive and rebuild dead institutions. Mr. Trump clearly saw himself as one of these when he said his goal would be to bring back the American dream. The authors envision a return to a more traditional, conservative social order as one outcome of a crisis. They also see the possibility of retribution and punishment for those who resist or refuse to comply with the new expectations for conformity. Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cwith us or against us\u201d attitude raises questions about what kind of leader he would be in such a crisis  \u2014   and what kind of loyalty his administration might demand.'"}, "time": 1742563757.3838906}
