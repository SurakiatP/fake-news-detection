I loved Pam and she was amazing at communicating even weeks after sessions if we had questions, so I questioned my body: am I comfortable with Jerry working in my energy field? He called me right after the sessions and even offered a Skype communication if I wanted. He knew that I had done lots of work on myself in past lives, which confirmed to me that he was real, because I was a Tibetan Monk and they spend a life time working on their karma. He is as good as Pam was as a healer. \\nThat same night I had lots of energy, I could not sleep, I felt well. The next 4 days I felt very tired, I could not get enough sleep. Then came the times of the essences and oils. Alexandra and Steven had emailed me and called me to follow up on how I was doing. They truly are amazing at what they do in every ways. The potions were on their way. They hit me like a brick, I went emotional, not grounded and vertiginous. I was able to catch my mind by finding the gratitude for the opportunity that these 3 people, the oils and essences had been given me, I was to be free in a big way, and that to me was worth a couple of weeks of symptoms of emotional, physical and spiritual release.
