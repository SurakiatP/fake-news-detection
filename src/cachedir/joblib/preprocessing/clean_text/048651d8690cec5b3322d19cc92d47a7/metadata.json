[Hundreds of   programs assist illegal aliens, but not a single program exists specifically to help American victims of illegal alien crime, they told SiriusXM host Matthew Boyle.  Organized by the Remembrance Project\u2019s Maria Espinoza, the Angel Moms described the immense emotional and financial costs burdening their families \u2014  and government\u2019s complete indifference. \u201cThe national program we put forth \u2014  Mr. Trump is the only candidate who met with us, of course, but also who agreed to support the Remembrance Project national program that would help with burial, medical, and counseling expenses,\u201d said Espinoza. \u201cAlso, what\u2019s very important that people don\u2019t understand that in so many cases, our families are being   because they\u2019re being misguided in the court system. Either activist judges, or activist prosecutors \u2014  so we really need someone to help and guide our families. \u201d \u201cWho can afford an attorney for themselves? And here illegal aliens get one. If they murder an American, they are given two attorneys to protect them, to defend them,\u201d she added. Ruth Johnston Martin, whose husband was shot by an illegal alien, said there is not one government program out there to help those suffering a loss due to illegal alien crime.  \u201cWell, first of all, everyone listening has a family. Just imagine waking up one day and having one of those family members ripped away from you in such a violent and horrifying way. You\u2019re never the same. You need that counseling,\u201d she said.  \u201cYou have to understand the depression that sets in \u2014  these individuals need something, someone to reach out to. Someone that\u2019s going to circle the wagons around them. That program will be that source. It\u2019s a resource. And you know, it is true \u2014  there\u2019s over 300 programs for illegal aliens,\u201d Martin continued.   \u201cBut there\u2019s nothing to help the families of those who have lost loved ones at the hands of these individuals. So they don\u2019t have to suffer in silence. They have someone they can reach out to. \u201d  \u201cThere\u2019s many that just go into a state of depression. There are some that commit suicide. There are some that go to drinking. It doesn\u2019t have to be that way,\u201d she said. \u201cThey need the assistance, and it\u2019s about time we had a president that says, \u2018You know what, you\u2019re an American. We\u2019re here for you. We\u2019re here to assist you.\u2019 And that is exactly what he will do. \u201d  Laura Wilkerson, who summoned the strength to tell the story of her son Joshua\u2019s violent death at the hands of an illegal alien classmate over and over again, said the trauma can leave one unable to live a normal life, or even do everyday tasks.  \u201cWhen you lose a child, and the trauma that is involved with Josh\u2019s case, you are just absolutely broken to the core. You don\u2019t know if you can breathe. I mean really, it\u2019s a start to learn to breathe all over again and learning to crawl, and then to walk,\u201d she said. \u201cYou feel like an infant. Your mind knows that you\u2019re not, but you can\u2019t help but have the trauma with it. \u201d  \u201cI sat in the trial and watched this kid who was just excited about what he did to Josh, and he got up off the stand and demonstrated to the district attorney about how he strangled Josh, and he never had an ounce of remorse. And, this was two years after Joshua died,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was two years before it was brought to trial. And then you sit there and watch him just excited about what he did to Joshua. You\u2019ve never been faced with the evil, and with the trauma. \u201d \u201cMy husband and I own a small business, and it\u2019s very hard to \u2014  you know, you\u2019re scrapping and fighting every day to make it anyway, and you can\u2019t do the things you used to do. And it takes you a long time to process that your child is not coming back, ever, and then on top of that to just do daily things. I couldn\u2019t make a meal for my family for probably about a year and a half,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know something\u2019s messed up, and you just can\u2019t do it. \u201d \u201cEverything becomes like climbing a mountain, and you really need help,\u201d she added.  Legal immigrant Agnes Gibboney, whose son Ronald da Silva was murdered in 2002 by an illegal alien, said families desperation need lawyers in their corner when fighting for justice.  \u201cWith this national program to allow families to have legal representation, so your rights won\u2019t be violated in a court of law,\u201d she said, adding she only had the prosecutor to look out for her. \u201cEverything went wrong. I was not allowed to say my impact statement. I was not allowed to address the court. I was not allowed to get the probation hearing report. And when I called them to ask how come I didn\u2019t get it, they said, \u2018My boss told me not to talk to you,\u2019 and hung up. \u201d Wilkerson said she paid out of her own pocket for an attorney just to sit through the trial of her son\u2019s murderer. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want me to sit in the trial, and I had to hire an attorney just to make that happen. \u201d She \u201ccouldn\u2019t imagine\u201d not being present in the courtroom while others heard about the death of her son.
