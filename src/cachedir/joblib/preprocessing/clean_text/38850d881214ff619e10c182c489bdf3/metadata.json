[Howard County officials, comprised of mostly Democrats, say they want to ban county officials from inquiring about an individuals\u2019 immigration status. The officials would also be barred from cooperating with federal immigration officials, according to the Baltimore Sun.  \u201cThe recent national political climate, increased incidents of hate speech and violence, and unfortunate statements made by our nation\u2019s   has caused many in the Howard County community to fear for their personal safety and the loss of civil liberties,\u201d Howard County City Council member Calvin Ball said. The City Council, though, acknowledges that Howard County designating itself as a sanctuary city would not go far with   Donald Trump\u2019s incoming administration. The incoming President plans to focus heavily on banning a region from failing to comply with federal immigration laws. Jessica Vaughan with the Center for Immigration Studies told the Baltimore Sun she didn\u2019t understand the purpose of the sanctuary city classification for Howard County, as it\u2019s largely based in a   fear about federal immigration officials. \u201cI\u2019m at a loss to see how this would affect the real life practices of Howard County officials or force them to do anything they\u2019re already doing,\u201d said Vaughan. \u201cThis idea that immigration officers are suddenly going to be raiding elementary schools and so county officials need to enact these policies to protect people from this activity is just silly. It doesn\u2019t happen that way and it never will. This is a solution in search of a problem. \u201d While Howard County looks to move forward with a sanctuary city policy, other counties are reversing course thanks to Trump\u2019s hardline position that sanctuary cities will have no place in his America. Suffolk County, New York, has officially announced that it will no longer designate itself as a sanctuary city. The move comes just ahead of Trump\u2019s inauguration, as Breitbart Texas reported. Sheriff Vincent DeMarco said his county will no longer demand a judge\u2019s order before detaining an illegal immigrant wanted by federal immigration officials  \u2014   a major shift away from its previous sanctuary city policy. Trump is expected to take down sanctuary city jurisdictions, with incoming Attorney General Jeff Sessions likely to set legal battles with locales that refuse to comply with federal immigration law.
