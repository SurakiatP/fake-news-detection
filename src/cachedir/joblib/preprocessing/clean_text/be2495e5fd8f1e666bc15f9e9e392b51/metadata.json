[Workers originally put up blue ribbons and blue stripes throughout the McDonald\u2019s on North Orange Avenue in Green Cove Springs to honor local police officers for National Police Week but took the decorations down because of an order from the McDonald\u2019s corporate office, WJXT reported.  Someone apparently filed a complaint with McDonald\u2019s corporate office, which responded that the store could not keep up the display due to the company\u2019s \u201cno sign rule\u201d barring decorations inside the store. The employees complied with the corporate office\u2019s decision, although they were not happy about it. Customers at the Green Cove Springs McDonald\u2019s were also unhappy with the decision. \u201cI think it\u2019s cruel for people to do things like that,\u201d customer Mary Tillman said. \u201cI think we live in a time where we let political things get in the way of what really matters and I think the whole purpose of this is to honor those fallen officers,\u201d Chandler Steele, another customer at the store, said. WJXT reached out to McDonald\u2019s corporate headquarters, which responded that \u201cthe McDonald\u2019s in Green Cove Springs is locally owned and operated\u201d and declined to comment any further on the matter. Employees told the news station Monday evening that they received permission to put the blue decorations back up, although it was not clear whether corporate decided to allow it or if the local owner approved of the decision. A spokesperson for the Green Cove Springs Police Department said the McDonald\u2019s had always supported law enforcement. National Police Week runs from May   21 this year, according to the event\u2019s website. Other Florida McDonald\u2019s locations have supported law enforcement in the past. On National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day back in January, all Florida stores gave law enforcement officers a free Extra Value Meal to thank them for their service.'"}, "time": 1742563498.5528073}
