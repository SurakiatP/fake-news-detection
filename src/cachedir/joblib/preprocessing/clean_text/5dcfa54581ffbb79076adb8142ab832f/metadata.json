Trump. Mr. Trump carried so much baggage and had insulted so many voting blocs that some Clinton supporters began to imagine a landslide. But early optimism that this would be an easy race is evaporating. In the corridors of Congress, on airplane shuttles between New York and Washington, at donor gatherings and on conference calls, anxiety is spreading through the Democratic Party that Mrs. Clinton is struggling to find her footing. While she enjoys many demographic advantages heading into the fall, key Democrats say they are growing worried that her campaign has not determined how to combat her unpredictable, often wily Republican rival, to whom criticism seldom sticks and rules of decorum seem not to apply. Mrs. Clinton is pressing ahead with a conventional campaign, echoing the 2012 themes used against the Republican nominee that year, Mitt Romney. But Mr. Trump is running a jarringly different crusade: accusing her husband, former President Bill Clinton, of rape proposing that the country conduct brutal methods of torture and suggesting that South Korea and Japan be permitted to develop nuclear arms. Prominent Democrats say a more provocative approach is needed. \u201cThe guy\u2019s a maniac,\u201d John Burton, the chairman of the California Democratic Party, said about Mr. Trump. Referring to a famous 1964 political message, he said, \u201cYou could run the old L. B. J. ad against Goldwater, with \u2018Three, two, one,\u2019 and a hydrogen bomb blows up with a little girl counting daisies. \u201d Of course, Mr. Trump faces many hurdles himself, and has stumbled in managing his growing campaign as he shifts toward a general election. But Democrats suggest that the past few weeks have shown that Mrs. Clinton and her aides must become more agile and creative against him. The sense of nervousness crystallized this week when Mrs. Clinton devoted campaign events across California to hitting Mr. Trump for not releasing his tax returns and depicting him as a cold corporate titan who profited off the housing crisis. Such charges helped undermine Mr. Romney four years ago. Yet Mrs. Clinton\u2019s remarks received little   coverage in the news media, while cable channels went live with Mr. Trump\u2019s    recitation of \u201cCrooked Hillary,\u201d his favored nickname for her. Ken Salazar, the former Colorado senator who has been mentioned as a possible Clinton running mate, said the campaign should draw a sharp contrast between Mr. Trump\u2019s shortcomings and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s potential to be \u201cthe most qualified person to be president in our lifetime. \u201d \u201cThe campaign needs to expose Donald Trump as the opposite  \u2014   selfish, egomaniac, divisive and unqualified to be president,\u201d Mr. Salazar said in an email. Jennifer Palmieri, a spokeswoman for the Clinton campaign, said that the news coverage Mr. Trump is receiving is not helping him. She said that unlike Mr. Trump, who uses \u201cnothing but his own mouth,\u201d Mrs. Clinton has a campaign that employs many methods of communication, including videos, respected surrogates and bilingual outreach. \u201cWe hear from friends who think we should act more like Trump or criticize us for sometimes using traditional communications tactics,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t think that\u2019s the answer. \u201d As a candidate, Mrs. Clinton is not without her own issues to overcome, including her inability to quickly put away Senator Bernie Sanders and her use of a private email server when she was secretary of state, feeding a perception she is not trustworthy. In a report delivered this past week to Congress, the State Department\u2019s inspector general strongly criticized her for the practice. But it is the campaign\u2019s approach to Mr. Trump that is making even Mrs. Clinton\u2019s most loyal supporters uneasy. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York is concerned that she lacks a comprehensive strategy to confront Mr. Trump, and has told Democrats that the Clinton campaign must bring on a senior staff member dedicated only to the Trump portfolio. \u201cAs soon as she clinches the nomination, we need a   person in the campaign whose sole job is to respond to Trump, almost on an hourly basis,\u201d said Mr. Schumer, who has begun conversations with Clinton officials about who could fill that role. During a conference call this month,   female supporters pressed Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advisers about her message  \u2014   which has as a slogan \u201cBreaking Down Barriers\u201d  \u2014   and whether it needs to shift for the general election. \u201cThe message will be broadening,\u201d Karen Finney, a senior adviser, explained, according to a transcript of the call obtained by The New York Times. \u201cBut,\u201d she added, leaving some participants perplexed, \u201cbreaking down barriers and unity will continue to be part of the theme because Hillary believes we need to come together as a country in many ways. \u201d Debates have broken out in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s Brooklyn headquarters over the best approach to take. Some advisers worry that by running against Mr. Trump as she would a traditional Republican candidate, Mrs. Clinton is actually making the   star appear more legitimate. This month, when Mr. Trump suggested he would reduce the national debt by negotiating with creditors to accept something less than full payment, economists dismissed the idea as fanciful. Hours later, the Clinton campaign sent out a news release about Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201crisky\u201d idea of defaulting on the national debt with a response from Gene Sperling, formerly a senior economic adviser to both President Obama and Mr. Clinton, condemning the idea. The seriousness of the campaign\u2019s response seemed to elevate a nonsensical proposal. \u201cThat is a danger,\u201d said Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to Mr. Obama. \u201cYou have to take the threat of Trump becoming president seriously, but you shouldn\u2019t treat him as a serious person. \u201d At the same time, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s attempts at poking Mr. Trump have felt tame compared with what he has unleashed. The day after he accused her husband of rape on Fox News this month, she told CNN, \u201cI have concluded he is not qualified to be president. \u201d Her aides were exuberant that Mrs. Clinton, a cautious candidate who for weeks had demurred when asked if Mr. Trump was up to the job, had finally publicly declared him unfit. But to many Clinton allies, it felt like a tepid tactic from yesteryear. \u201cSometimes, you get the feeling that they\u2019re in a professional boxing match and he\u2019s in a street fight, and they\u2019re coming in with their gloves on,\u201d said the Rev. Al Sharpton, expressing dismay over the Clinton operation\u2019s apparent lack of appetite for combat. \u201cThis is a street fight with a guy with a razor and a broken   bottle,\u201d he added, \u201cand you\u2019ve got to fight him like that. \u201d Ms. Palmieri said, \u201cEach tactic we use is designed for a particular purpose to either engage the press or reach a certain audience. \u201d Any aggressive approach by Mrs. Clinton is potentially dangerous, however, because recent polls show she is viewed negatively by a majority of the electorate. The campaign says it intends to go after Mr. Trump more forcefully, particularly on national security and his business record, after June 7, when Mrs. Clinton is expected to officially clinch her party\u2019s nomination. For now, her aides appear to be throwing ideas against a wall to see what sticks, including trying out different monikers after the Democratic National Committee\u2019s \u201cDangerous Donald\u201d flopped. An internal favorite is \u201cPoor Donald,\u201d with its implication that Mr. Trump, famously defensive about his net worth, is not nearly as wealthy as he lets on. Her advisers also say that a large percentage of voters have not yet paid attention to the details of the race and do not know about Mr. Trump\u2019s business dealings or that he has refused to release his taxes. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a general election without some early   from Washington insiders,\u201d said Robby Mook, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign manager. He noted that the campaign had attacked Mr. Trump over the tax returns and for his \u201cdemeaning millions of Americans. \u201d \u201cOur campaign has already shown the resolve to take him on and put him on defense in ways his Republican challengers never could,\u201d Mr. Mook added. William M. Daley, Mr. Obama\u2019s former White House chief of staff, attributed any early shortcomings in taking on Mr. Trump to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s prolonged primary battle against Mr. Sanders. The period between the June 7 contests and the July convention will reshape the race, he said. To that end, Joel Benenson, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s pollster and chief strategist, pointed out that at this stage in the 2008 primary battle against Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Obama led Senator John McCain by only two percentage points. He went on to defeat Mr. McCain by 7. 2 percentage points. It is clear, however, that Democrats are no longer mocking Mr. Trump. Many of them seem determined instead to understand his appeal. In an interview on Friday, Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado said he had purchased and begun reading Mr. Trump\u2019s book \u201cThe Art of the Deal. \u201d The governor said he remained confident that Mrs. Clinton would ultimately win, but added that \u201cshe has to be careful, because now he has momentum. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562946.2694285}
