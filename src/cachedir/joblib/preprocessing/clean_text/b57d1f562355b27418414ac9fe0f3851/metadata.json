Y. She was 86. The cause was Parkinson\u2019s disease, her son Bruce Fields said. Ms. Peters, who would sing with the Met 515 times over 35 vigorous years, was internationally renowned for her high, silvery voice (in private, she could hit a high A, two and a half octaves above middle C) her clarion diction in a flurry of languages her attractive stage presence and, by virtue of the fact that she and television came to prominence at about the same time, her wide popular appeal. \u201cAs a coloratura,\u201d Cue magazine wrote of Ms. Peters in 1960, \u201cshe has no peer. \u201d In addition to the Met, with which she appeared regularly from 1950 to 1985  \u2014   one of the longest associations of any singer with a major opera company  \u2014   Ms. Peters was heard at the Lyric Opera of Chicago, Cincinnati Opera, the Vienna State Opera, Covent Garden and elsewhere. Her   roles include the Queen of the Night in Mozart\u2019s \u201cThe Magic Flute,\u201d Rosina in Rossini\u2019s \u201cThe Barber of Seville,\u201d Gilda in Verdi\u2019s \u201cRigoletto\u201d and Oscar (a pageboy played by a soprano) in his \u201cUn Ballo in Maschera. \u201d But her most significant role was undoubtedly Zerlina in Mozart\u2019s \u201cDon Giovanni. \u201d Enlisted to sing that part in 1950 as a   substitute, Ms. Peters was propelled, with no rehearsal, onto the Met stage and into a stellar career. Known for taking meticulous care of her voice, she continued to sing in recital until well into her 70s, a good two decades past the de facto retirement age in her line of work. At midcentury, when it was more customary to encounter opera stars on television than it is today, she was seen on a string of shows, including \u201cThe Voice of Firestone,\u201d \u201cThe Mike Douglas Show\u201d and in particular \u201cThe Ed Sullivan Show,\u201d on which she appeared scores of times in the 1950s and \u201960s. Later in her career, she performed in operetta and musical theater. One thing that allowed Ms. Peters to sing so long was a prudent awareness of what her voice could and could not do. Possessed of a light, fleet instrument, she confined herself to coloratura and soubrette roles, steering clear of heavier fare. Critics sometimes faulted Ms. Peters\u2019s singing for a certain lack of intensity, but her flageolet tones made an airy counterweight to the vocal heft of Maria Callas and Joan Sutherland, whose style was becoming the norm for sopranos at midcentury. \u201cI would love to sing Tosca,\u201d Ms. Peters told The Los Angeles Times in 1986. \u201cAnd Salome. Those are my dream roles. But I won\u2019t do them, at least not in this life. They would kill me, vocally. \u201d Another thing that kept Ms. Peters singing was her impeccable technique: From the age of 13, she had trained for an operatic career as an athlete trains for the Olympics. For years, her weekly regimen included not only voice and foreign language lessons but also instruction in ballet, acting and fencing, as well as a strength and conditioning program under the direct supervision of Joseph Pilates, the originator of the Pilates exercise method. Although Ms. Peters\u2019s voice teacher, William Herman, did not want her to sing in public until she was thoroughly groomed, he insisted that she make a deep study of the operatic literature. By the time she was 19 and auditioned for the Met, she knew the scores of 20 operas cold. Providentially, as things fell out, \u201cDon Giovanni\u201d was one of them. Roberta Peterman, an only child, was born on May 4, 1930, and grew up near Jerome Avenue and 170th Street in the Bronx. Her father, Solomon, was a shoe salesman her mother, the former Ruth Hirsch, a milliner. As a girl, Roberta, in the words of her family, had \u201ca real voice on her. \u201d When she was 13, her grandfather, the ma\u00eetre d\u2019hotel at Grossinger\u2019s, the redoubt of Jewish life in the Catskills, asked the celebrated tenor Jan Peerce (n\u00e9 Jacob Pincus Perelmuth) who was singing there, to hear her. Impressed, Mr. Peerce arranged for Roberta to study with Mr. Herman, whose students included the Metropolitan Opera coloratura Patrice Munsel, who died last year. Leaving school permanently after she completed junior high, Roberta took six lessons a week from Mr. Herman on a   scholarship. He also arranged for supplementary instruction in French, Italian, German, dance and drama. Mr. Pilates, meanwhile, did his part by standing regularly on Roberta\u2019s abdomen (he weighed 174 pounds, she 119) to help her develop the musculature essential for breath control. All this proved so effective that at 16, Roberta was offered a $   role in \u201cStreet Scene,\u201d a musical with music by Kurt Weill and lyrics by Langston Hughes that would open on Broadway in 1947. Though the salary would have been welcome in a family of modest means, Roberta, with the support of her parents, turned it down: She had set her sights on opera and would not be deterred. In late 1949, Ms. Peters (she had shortened her surname at her teacher\u2019s suggestion) was taken on by Sol Hurok, the   impresario. He soon arranged an audition with the Met\u2019s new general manager, Rudolf Bing. On Jan. 23, 1950, the    Ms. Peters stood on the stage of the old Metropolitan Opera House on Broadway and 39th Street in Manhattan. There, in the darkened hall, she sang \u201cDer H\u00f6lle Rache\u201d (\u201cHell\u2019s Vengeance\u201d) the Queen of the Night\u2019s aria from \u201cThe Magic Flute,\u201d which, with its fiendish series of high F\u2019s, is among the canonical texts of the coloratura repertory. Somewhere out in the darkness was Mr. Bing. \u201cIt was the first audition I had done for anyone, and I was so scared,\u201d Ms. Peters told The Chicago Tribune in 1993. \u201cWhen it was over he asked if I would sing it again. Then he asked me to do it again. Well, I sang it four times, not knowing that he had silently brought in conductors Fritz Reiner, Fausto Cleva and Fritz Stiedry to hear me. \u201d Signed to a Met contract, Ms. Peters was scheduled to make her debut with the company as the Queen of the Night in January 1951. But on Nov. 17, the soprano Nadine Conner, scheduled to sing Zerlina in a Met \u201cDon Giovanni\u201d that night, fell ill. At 3 p. m. Mr. Bing telephoned Ms. Peters and told her to report to the opera house in time for an 8 o\u2019clock curtain. Ms. Peters, who had planned to watch the performance with her mother from the   section that night, informed her parents that they now had box seats. The family, then living at Broadway and 71st Street, rushed to the street and hailed a taxi. When the cab became stuck in traffic, they jumped out and took the subway. At the opera house, there was no time for real rehearsal: Ms. Peters\u2019s only preparation to play Zerlina, the country girl who catches Don Giovanni\u2019s roving eye, took the form of hurried consultations with the stage director, Herbert Graf, and the conductor, Mr. Reiner. She was hustled into a costume the other singers would help her hit her marks onstage by gently propelling her wherever she needed to be. \u201cAre you nervous?\u201d the baritone Paul Sch\u00f6ffler, that night\u2019s Don Giovanni, asked her before the curtain. \u201cNo, numb,\u201d Ms. Peters replied, and on she went. \u201cThe delightful surprise of last night\u2019s performance of \u2018Don Giovanni\u2019 at the Metropolitan was the emergency debut of little Roberta Peters in the part of Zerlina,\u201d The New York  \u2019s review the next day said. \u201cThe voice came through the big house as clear as a bell, the notes equally bright and focused and the phrasing that of a true musician. And the girl  \u2014   she is all of 5 feet 2  \u2014   turned in a very smooth job of acting, too. \u201d From then on, Ms. Peters was in great demand, both at the Met, where she sang her planned Queen of the Night on Jan. 12, 1951, and around the world. As if her debut had foreordained as much, she developed something of a specialty as an   substitute for indisposed singers. Ms. Peters was by all accounts one of opera\u2019s least divalike divas. She was exceptionally game  \u2014   not hesitating, for instance, to don a chicken suit for an episode of \u201cCaptain Kangaroo\u201d in 1975. (One is   to picture Maria Callas in similar confines.) She appeared in several memorable TV commercials. In one, for Chock Full o\u2019Nuts, Ms. Peters sang the company\u2019s signature jingle in mellifluous Italian. In another, for American Express  \u2014   part of its   \u201cDo you know me?\u201d campaign  \u2014   she hailed a cab by singing out \u201c !\u201d in a descending major third, from G to E flat. She had dramatic roles in several movies, including \u201cTonight We Sing\u201d (1953) based on Mr. Hurok\u2019s life, and on TV shows including \u201cMedical Center,\u201d on which, in 1975, she played a dying singer. The closest thing to drama in Ms. Peters\u2019s personal life was her very brief marriage to the great baritone Robert Merrill, whom she wed on March 30, 1952, and from whom she was divorced on June 26, 1952. (Ms. Peters later said that she had fallen in love with the voice rather than the man.) But they remained friends, and sometime   partners, ever after. Ms. Peters\u2019s second husband, Bertram Fields, a hotelier and   investor whom she married in 1955, died in 2010. In addition to her son Bruce, she is survived by another son, Paul, and four grandchildren. Her many recordings include works by Mozart, Rossini, Verdi, Cole Porter and Gilbert and Sullivan. For all the acclaim that cloaked Ms. Peters, and for all the laurels heaped upon her  \u2014   including a National Medal of Arts in 1998  \u2014   perhaps nothing could match the electricity of that   November night, when a    from the Bronx stepped onto the Met stage an unknown and came back as Roberta Peters. An ovation followed, and flowers along with it. Afterward, Ms. Peters took a taxi all the way home.'"}, "time": 1742562711.552141}
