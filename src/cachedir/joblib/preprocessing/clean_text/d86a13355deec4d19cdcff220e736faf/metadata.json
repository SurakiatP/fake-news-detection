Former New York Times assistant managing editor Jim Roberts quoted McAuliffe as saying: \u201cThere are too many guns on the street  \u2026    we worry about this every day for all of our citizens,\u201d and BuzzFeed DC editor Sarah Mimms tweeted: VA Gov. McAuliffe: \u201dWe lose 93  \u2026     people per day due to gun violence,\u201d mentions background checks, gun show loophole.  \u2014   Sarah Mimms (@SarahMMimms) June 14, 2017,  The \u201c93 people\u201d a day claim is a talking point shared by gun control proponents throughout the U. S. Everytown for Gun Safety, Moms Demand Action, Hillary Clinton, and similar groups and individuals have been making for years. They repeatedly state more than 90 people are killed by \u201cgun violence\u201d in America every day. But in reality, the number of people killed annually by homicidal firearm use is about a third of that figure. Individuals like McAuliffe swell the number of deaths via \u201cgun violence\u201d by adding   suicides to homicides, more than doubling the number of people who are actually murdered with a firearm. Interestingly enough, Mimms reported that McAuliffe first said \u201c93 million people [are killed] per day,\u201d but he corrected that statement.
