{"duration": 1.4952647686004639, "input_args": {"text": "'You can tell a lot about a person by watching him lose. I did not suggest   specifically because I thought Jonah Hill would lose at it, but rather because his initial suggestion for an interview activity  \u2014   tennis  \u2014   presented logistical complications: specifically, the problem of trying to talk with someone from 70 feet away across a net on a loud city court. So Hill agreed to  . \u201cDoesn\u2019t Susan Sarandon have a   place in New York?\u201d he mused while forming a plan. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that. I know people who\u2019ve gone there. I don\u2019t really know what Susan Sarandon\u2019s involvement is. I just know for certain that she\u2019s tangentially connected to the   industry. \u201d This turns out to be correct. The Academy   actress Susan Sarandon is a founder of a chain of   lounges called SPiN. It has locations in New York, Toronto, Los Angeles, Chicago and San Francisco. The New York outlet, where I met Hill on a Wednesday afternoon in June, is an icily   subterranean space on 23rd Street with nightmarish wall murals and 18 royal blue tables. Players were scattered about the place, ponging away to a dance remix of \u201cLet\u2019s Talk About Sex. \u201d Hill arrived punctually with drowsy eyes and an iced coffee from Starbucks. \u201cNo sign of Susan Sarandon,\u201d he observed, looking around the room and dragging on his coffee, \u201cwhich is the biggest sign of Susan Sarandon. \u201d He did not, he said, get a lot of sleep last night. There was a work call with someone in a different time zone  \u2014   a \u201cfinance person\u201d for a movie he plans to direct  \u2014   and the conversation left Hill so jazzed that he couldn\u2019t fall asleep, so he took his French bulldog Carmela (named after Tony Soprano\u2019s wife) for a walk around the neighborhood, and when he finally dozed off he left a window open, leaving him speckled with \u201ca thousand\u201d mosquito bites, visible in rosy constellations across his arms. The coffee was helping. Hill, at 32, has appeared in enough movies (currently 29) that he was recognized, in the space of 10 minutes, by a female SPiN employee in her 20s who requested a photo, by a 40ish camp counselor who asked that Hill take a picture with his campers and by the campers themselves, who clustered around the actor and stared stoically into the camera for a photo in which Hill was the only one smiling. These people probably knew Hill from his role as a hilarious sidekick in the \u201c21 Jump Street\u201d remakes, or from his role as a hilarious sidekick in \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street,\u201d or from his role as a hilarious sidekick in \u201cSuperbad. \u201d The   roles make up a numer ically small but   portion of Hill\u2019s career, and no number of contrasting performances  \u2014   in indie comedies directed by the Duplass brothers, in   dramas like \u201cMoneyball\u201d  \u2014   can seem to override the public impression of him as a man who might, at any moment, start humping the furniture. This is fair, because Hill is excellent at delivering coitus jokes. It\u2019s also unfair, because his acting career didn\u2019t begin in a   place and it doesn\u2019t seem to be heading in that direction, even if his IMDb page is dotted with the presence of Judd Apatow. Hill has received two Oscar nominations and produced six movies and has writing credits on both of the \u201cJump Street\u201d movies. He is not Seth Rogen, although people sometimes confuse the two men, which feels vaguely   given that they look nothing alike. Next year he\u2019ll direct a movie that he wrote (not a comedy). This summer he appears in \u201cWar Dogs,\u201d directed by Todd Phillips, of the \u201cHangover\u201d movies. Though it\u2019s strewn with giggly moments, the movie is ultimately alarming. Hill plays a sociopathic arms dealer. In the basement at SPiN,   patrons continued to recognize the actor, who didn\u2019t wear a hat or sunglasses or other protective camouflage, until a manager registered the ogling and transferred Hill to a private room behind a   curtain. By now the coffee had kicked in. I asked Hill if he was ready to play  . \u201cYeah!\u201d he said. \u201cI was just thinking that I\u2019d love to. \u201d Pause. \u201cYou didn\u2019t think of that idea  \u2014   I thought of it. \u201d This last sentence came across as a joke in real life  \u2014   he was doing an impression of a surreally bratty person  \u2014   but it reads horribly on the page, which turns out to be true of many things that Hill says. His humor is  . This may be one reason that profiles of the actor have not historically been ultraflattering. Another reason may be Hill\u2019s face. \u201cI have resting bitch face,\u201d he explained to me once. \u201cI really do. It\u2019s heartbreaking. I don\u2019t mean anything by it. \u201d This is borne out by paparazzi photos of Hill sternly alighting from a vehicle, angrily riding a Citi Bike and resentfully hanging out with Leonardo DiCaprio. \u201cI know I look really pissed off,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019m not. \u201d If life were a reality TV show, it would be accurate to say that Hill has received a \u201cbad edit,\u201d in part because of the above factors. In 2013 he did an interview with Rolling Stone that resulted in the following words being used by media outlets to describe him: humorless, insufferable, angry, defensive, pompous jerk, and \u201c20 Most Hated Celebrities!\u201d Today\u2019s Jonah Hill, rallying at a   table, seems like someone who might do yoga, or drink green tea, or practice Transcendental Meditation. Maybe it is just the residue of his youth in California. Maybe \u201ccenteredness\u201d is just Los Angeles leaving the body. Whatever it is, he comes off as mellow and polite, keeping his phone out of sight during interactions and asking if I have any dietary restrictions. He behaves in a way that would assure his mother that she did a good job. He says that the trait he values most in others is being nice. Most famous people have a thin oleaginous layer of social grace that tops a bottomless well of impatience to get their press duties over with, but Hill seemed to be in no particular hurry to do anything, except lose at  . While his serve is 90 percent unreturnable and his backhand is evil, Hill\u2019s forehand is unreliable. Midway through Round 1 an employee popped his head in and asked for the score. \u201cFourteen to 20,\u201d Hill replied. \u201cShe\u2019s winning. \u201d The guy scoffed. \u201cYou\u2019re losing to a girl?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not a very feminist attitude, my friend,\u201d Hill said. \u201cDoes that make you mad?\u201d he asked, after the employee left. \u201cIt\u2019s not the dumb outlook that bothers me. It\u2019s that he expects me to share that sentiment. He expects me to be like, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m really embarrassed that a girl is beating me. \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d For Round 2, which he also lost, Hill plugged his iPod into a speaker and selected a playlist of   \u201990s rap acts like the Coup and Jeru the Damaja. When the game ended, he briefly howled in grief, bounced over to shake hands and then floated the idea of barbecue for lunch. Not a bad loser. A certain comfort with vulnerability might be the most prominent aspect of Hill\u2019s personality. At lunch, he gets the hiccups. He warns me that his face sweats a lot, but that the rest of his body produces a normal amount of sweat, and he occasionally mops his forehead as politely as anyone can mop anything using a napkin that he has folded into a tidy mopping rectangle. If you compliment his acting, he\u2019ll say, \u201cThank you,\u201d and then \u201cDo you really feel that way?\u201d  \u2014   and not in a \u201cDo go on\u201d tone, but as if he suspects a polite fabrication and is offering an out. Once he was asked to audition for a part in a filmed musical adaptation, and he declined  \u2014   because he can\u2019t sing, but also because the   possibility of his audition tape\u2019s being leaked was too embarrassing to contemplate. This hypothetical struck him as even more embarrassing than a leaked sex tape, because after all, he said, \u201cmost human beings have had more practice at having sex than they have at singing. \u201d Vulnerability is a counterproductive trait for a famous person to have, but Hill is funniest   when he plays characters thumping up against their feeble natures, and he is most affecting in dramatic roles doing the same. It makes you wonder whether the kind of person most suited to being an actor  \u2014   sensitive, expressive, slightly weird  \u2014   is the kind of person least suited to being a celebrity. Hill has been sensitive and weird since infancy. He grew up in Los Angeles, the son of an accountant and a costume designer, enjoying a childhood that he characterizes as \u201cfun\u201d yet \u201csuper emo. \u201d He cried frequently. For a year starting at age 4 he pretended to be a dog and padded around the house on all fours, woofing, which may have been his first acting experience. He intended to grow up into a writer until he became obsessed with skateboarding at around 10. His dreams of becoming a professional skater eventually receded because of a lack of skill, and he enrolled in college at The New School with plans to write and direct. \u201cIn school I was always a decent athlete, a decent student, but I was never exceptional at any of that stuff,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I started taking acting classes, it was the first time teachers were like, \u2018You\u2019re good and you should keep doing this. \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d Another adult who recognized Hill\u2019s potential was Dustin Hoffman, who happened to be the father of Hill\u2019s former schoolmate Jake Hoffman and who suggested that Hill audition for \u201cI Heart Huckabees. \u201d Hill got the part and appears halfway through the movie as a   teenager arguing with his sister and playing video games at a family dinner across from Mark Wahlberg. The role is a blip, but Hill earns his few minutes   appearing at ease despite never having been in a movie and having no idea, he told me, when the camera was on him. This confidence apparently stretches back to his youth: A Jewish Journal profile from 2012  \u2014   a rare flattering one  \u2014   includes a quote from Cantor Yonah Kliger of Temple Emanuel of Beverly Hills, where Hill had his bar mitzvah, describing him as \u201cdestined for something great\u201d and \u201celectric\u201d even at 13, reciting his Torah portion in a prayer shawl. Three years after \u201cHuckabees,\u201d Hill   in \u201cSuperbad\u201d as a   who cries, dances, lies, has his heart broken, is struck by a number of vehicles and exchanges tender    with Michael Cera\u2019s character in a final scene that still makes me weep in a way that no Pixar movie ever will. This was his breakthrough. If \u201cSuperbad\u201d cemented Hill\u2019s status as an entertaining accent piece, \u201cMoneyball\u201d (2011) suggested that pegging him as a novelty actor was an error. His character in that movie, an economics geek named Peter Brand, is an introvert who walks the earth as if he\u2019s about to be pantsed. He underplays the part so deftly that Brand\u2019s emotional climax  \u2014   when he sees that his methods actually work  \u2014   is conveyed by no more than a few euphoric seconds of rapid blinking and a  . The next movie he appeared in was a critical disaster of a comedy called \u201cThe Sitter. \u201d Because of this seesawing, the best way to make sense of Hill\u2019s career is to divide it roughly in half, not chronologically but by the two kinds of movies he makes: on one side, the goofy com edies, and on the other side,   movies by respected directors, like \u201cDjango Unchained\u201d and \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street\u201d and \u201cHail, Caesar!\u201d After \u201cSuperbad,\u201d it would have been easy for Hill to take the Adam Sandler route and ride the wave of his own typecasting, making bad copies of the same movie over and over again. Instead, he exercised discretion in his roles and did a   job to hammer out the kind of career that hilarious sidekicks in   teen com edies have not traditionally enjoyed. (Jason Biggs offers a useful point of comparison it took him a decade and a half to recover from the abasement of \u201cAmerican Pie. \u201d) The parallel movie tracks have one thing in common, which is that Hill tends to play obsessive characters in both. In \u201cWar Dogs\u201d he is obsessed with selling weapons to the United States government for piles of money. In \u201cTrue Story,\u201d he is obsessed with a murderer. In \u201cMoneyball,\u201d he is obsessed with sabermetrics. In \u201cCyrus,\u201d he\u2019s obsessed with his mom. In \u201cSuperbad,\u201d he is obsessed with the probability of losing his best friend. Even in \u201cHail, Caesar!\u201d though he is onscreen for approximately two seconds, the gag of Hill\u2019s character is that he is too engrossed in processing legal papers to take note of Scarlett Johansson\u2019s predatory innuendoes. Obsessiveness is a good filter for choosing roles, because there is nothing with more comic potential than a character who desperately wants something, and there\u2019s also nothing with more tragic potential the distinction is in how that obsession pans out. It can be a poignant trait, as with Jay Gatsby or an evil one, as with Hannibal Lecter or a creepy one, as with Annie Wilkes or a mesmerizing one, as with Willy Wonka or an epic one, as with Charles Foster Kane or a pa thetic one, as with Norma Desmond. Monomania is infinitely versatile. Ellen Lewis, who cast Hill as Donnie Azoff in \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street,\u201d had been particularly impressed with his performance in \u201cSuperbad. \u201d \u201cWolf\u201d wasn\u2019t necessarily written to be funny, she said, but Martin Scorsese wanted a Donnie who could improvise. \u201cObviously it was a different way to go,\u201d she said. \u201cJonah\u2019s got depth, but at the same time, he\u2019s extremely charismatic. And really funny people can be very dangerous. He showed that edge. \u201d He reminded her a little, Lewis said, of Robin Williams. One thing I\u2019ve never understood about acting is how famous actors get better at it. Do they all have acting coaches on retainer? And if these acting coaches are so good, why aren\u2019t they famous actors? When someone is freakishly precocious at acting, like Claire Danes, where does that come from? When someone gets appreciably worse at acting, like Al Pacino or Robert De Niro, how does that happen? And when someone gets perceptibly better at acting, like Jonah Hill, how does he make sure that his trajectory continues in a northeastern direction? At lunch he mentioned that every night before filming \u201cCyrus,\u201d he brushed his lips with a toothbrush because his character seemed like the kind of person who would have permanently chapped lips. How did he learn to think of this stuff, these novelistic details? Hill shrugged at the question. \u201cIf it was your job to think of those things, you would. You just would. \u201d But what\u2019s his secret? \u201cThe acting juice I drink every morning. \u201d But really. \u201cI watch things over and over again,\u201d Hill said. Like, 20 times. Most recently, \u201cBehind the Candelabra. \u201d Before that, the French film \u201cA Prophet. \u201d All the great Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola movies, obviously. All the Paul Thomas Anderson movies. He loves Lena Dunham and Spike Jonze. When he finds a movie he likes, he watches it compulsively  \u2014   and at a loud volume, because he has bad hearing from listening to live music as a youth without taking the proper precautions. He watches movies until he is able to forget that he is watching a movie, which to Hill is the sign of a really great movie. He picks the roles he plays using the same rubric he uses to pick the movies that he watches, which is by director. \u201cIf you have a great script, it\u2019s hard to [expletive] it up  \u2014   but I\u2019ve kind of had that happen,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve had scripts that were not even complete, and the director was amazing, and I ended up being proud of the movie. \u201d Great directors, he maintained, make great movies. It took him a while to figure this out. Even if a role is good, he won\u2019t do a movie now unless he believes in the director, because \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be a cool character in a bad movie. \u201d Nobody has bulletproof judgment, though, and Hill\u2019s character in this summer\u2019s \u201cWar Dogs\u201d could be seen as a terrific character in an otherwise O. K. movie. It\u2019s not that \u201cWar Dogs\u201d isn\u2019t funny and it\u2019s not as if Todd Phillips has made a   comedy about Ferguson, but it is an Iraq War movie made by the director of \u201cThe Hangover. \u201d There are strippers and an underwritten   role and Bradley Cooper. Phillips originally approached Hill with the movie a few years ago, offering him either of the two lead roles, but Hill declined, thinking it was somehow too similar to \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street. \u201d Phillips kept trying. Hill appreciated the persistence and eventually said yes. He was driving out of the \u201cyes\u201d meeting in his car when he spotted Phillips leaving separately on his Vespa. Unaware that Hill was watching, Phillips pulled over to the side of the road and did a victory fist pump, by himself, in a moment of unguarded personal joy. Hill found this immensely endearing. (Philips said he does not recall this event but that he believes it happened: \u201cI\u2019ve been known to tool around on my Vespa and I\u2019ve been known to get excited. \u201d) \u201cIt\u2019s funny,\u201d Phillips said of Hill, \u201cbecause in actual life he\u2019s  \u2014   \u2018quiet\u2019 is the wrong word, but reserved. If you sit down to lunch with him you\u2019ll laugh, but he\u2019s reserved. When he steps on set, this natural swagger comes out. \u201d In the movie, Hill plays Efraim Diveroli, an   bro from Miami Beach with   ambitions and a buttery spray tan. The movie is based on a true story, which originally appeared in Rolling Stone and which Hill himself tried to option before finding out that Phillips had already bought the rights. The real Efraim Diveroli does not approve of the movie, has not spent time with Hill and has filed a lawsuit against Warner Bros. The buttery spray tan was applied nightly in Hill\u2019s hotel room by a woman named Felicia, who stood aiming a hose while he pulled his boxers into a thong and revolved. Throughout filming he smelled faintly tropical. To prepare for all his movies, Hill compiles   playlists and then listens to them until they seep into his consciousness. For \u201cWar Dogs,\u201d the playlist involved \u201ca lot of cheesy,   Miami booty bass,\u201d which gives you a sense of his character\u2019s personality: loud, libidinous and whatever the opposite of introspective is. \u201cI imagined him listening to music that revved him up to lie to someone,\u201d Hill said. \u201cA lot of the people with confidence that you play, you try to find their deep insecurity. I don\u2019t think Efraim is a deeply, deeply insecure person. \u201d Instead of making the character a cartoon villain, Hill\u2019s Efraim is gleeful and coercive and menacing, with a helmet of gelled hair and a   giggle that sounds like the creepiest ringtone on earth. Miles Teller   in the film but disappears in the role next to Hill, he has the charisma of a corn dog. Hill\u2019s appeal, whatever the genre, is in his instinct to punctuate long stretches of smoothness with florid bloopers. He\u2019s either fully in control of himself or totally at the mercy of his emotions. He has the fallibility of an Everyman with the magnetism of someone millions of young men and women would halt a   game to take a selfie with. A decade ago we idolized celebrities whom we could never, in a million years, imagine being or dating. Lately we have adjusted our expectations downward to prefer figures, like Hill, who could be described as \u201creasonably aspirational. \u201d In person he\u2019s both smooth and   not with cinematic extremity but in a way that makes you think his friends definitely have a lot of Jonah Hill anecdotes in their back pockets. He is a generator of incidents. One morning in June we went for a southbound walk on the High Line. Hill ambled along at a      pace, pausing to buy a $1 amulet reading WORK SMOOTHLY LIFETIME PEACE from a (possibly phony) monk and lingering to form a   audience for a street performer singing Rick Astley\u2019s \u201cNever Gonna Give You Up. \u201d \u201cI love this song,\u201d Hill said, grooving mildly and retrieving a bill from his pocket. There was no visible donation receptacle, so he put the money on the performer\u2019s side table, where it started blowing away in the wind. To prevent this, Hill slid the man\u2019s nearby iPhone onto the bill to act as a paperweight, but his finger tapped \u201cpause\u201d in the process and the Rick Astley instrumental abruptly ceased. \u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d Hill wailed. \u201cI completely [expletive] that up. \u201d The performer made a \u201cno prob\u201d gesture and resumed singing, then did a back flip, as if to assure Hill that everything was cool between them. As we walked away Hill spoke directly into my tape recorder, as if to guarantee that the corny Rick Astley joke he was about to make would be reflected accurately for future generations: \u201cI want it on the record that he just looked me in the eye and promised me never to hurt me. It\u2019s documented. If that man ever, ever breaks my heart or deserts me, there will be legal repercussions. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563854.8916552}
