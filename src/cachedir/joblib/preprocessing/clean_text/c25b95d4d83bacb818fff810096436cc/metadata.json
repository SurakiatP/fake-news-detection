So was the chief of security for the opening ceremony as he left Olympic Stadium. A police officer was killed when his vehicle was sprayed with gunfire, and an Olympics bus carrying journalists was attacked by people throwing rocks. Even before the armed robbery this weekend of four American swimmers, including the gold medalist Ryan Lochte, a series of crimes had drawn attention to Brazil\u2019s shortcomings in providing security for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. But for many in this   city, a bigger question remains: What will happen after the Games? To thwart crime around the Olympics, Brazil has mobilized a security juggernaut in Rio twice the size of the one used for the London Games in 2012. Mindful of Rio\u2019s reputation for violent crime, the Brazilians have deployed 85, 000 security personnel. This show of force includes 23, 000 soldiers patrolling the city, some in military vehicles, along with helicopters and warships looming around the city\u2019s most popular beaches. \u201cThe city has never felt so safe,\u201d said Gilberto Dias, 50, a hot dog vendor who described how plainclothes officers had sprung to action one morning last week after two muggers accosted a tourist in the upscale Copacabana neighborhood. \u201cThey just materialized out of nowhere, which is something I\u2019ve never seen before. \u201d But even before the Games began, Rio was facing a surge in lawlessness in recent months that had rattled residents and alarmed the authorities. With the economy in turmoil, assaults and robberies on the street jumped by 42 percent in May, with 10, 000 robberies that month. And after years of declining homicides, the number of murders increased by more than 7 percent during the first half of the year, with over 1, 500 people killed. As dread persists over street violence and gun battles rage in Rio\u2019s favelas, some Brazilians worry about what will happen in the aftermath of the Games, when the soldiers are withdrawn and the city is left on its own to grapple with a financial crisis. \u201cThe assault on the American athlete is what happens to us in Rio every day,\u201d said Marcello Brito, 51, an architect, referring to Mr. Lochte. Rio\u2019s finances were so bad before the Games that it had declared a \u201cstate of calamity. \u201d Budgets had been gutted, with police officers and firefighters protesting delays in receiving pay by holding signs at the airport telling visitors, \u201cWelcome to hell. \u201d The federal government responded with an $850 million bailout package to help the state of Rio de Janeiro stay afloat, pay salaries and keep essential services running during the Olympics. But the crisis in Rio\u2019s finances, which are heavily dependent on global oil prices, remains, and the security lapses threaten to undermine ambitions for a resurgence in the city\u2019s fortunes. The authorities invested billions of dollars in sports venues, transit systems and   pacification projects in poor urban areas, arguing that the Olympics would serve as a linchpin in overhauling the city. In the weeks before the Games, Mayor Eduardo Paes even contended that Rio would be \u201cthe safest city in the world. \u201d Many residents have welcomed the increased security. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see soldiers patrolling the streets, at least where I live,\u201d said Cassius Almada, 39, a high school math teacher who lives in Copacabana. \u201cIt could be a lot worse. \u201d But those living beyond the necklace of upscale seafront neighborhoods say the increased security has had little effect in communities that have long been troubled by violence. Maria do Ros\u00e1rio Silva Santos, 54, who was visiting Rio from Bras\u00edlia, the nation\u2019s capital, said she had been stunned to see young men  \u2014   not police officers  \u2014   toting guns casually in Acari, a   neighborhood in north Rio, where she was staying during the Games. \u201cIt was shocking to see,\u201d she said. \u201cAs far as I can tell, nothing has changed. \u201d Some security experts emphasized that considerable risks persisted around the city, especially in favelas, the poor areas that generally emerged as squatter settlements and that are still controlled by drug gangs. Because of Rio\u2019s financial crisis, plans fell apart to establish a network of policing outposts in Mar\u00e9, one large area of favelas. Julita Lemgruber, the director of the Center for Studies on Public Security and Citizenship at Candido Mendes University in Rio, said it was na\u00efve to expect a drastic drop in crime during the Games. \u201cThe government thought a snap of their fingers would bring peace to a city that has lived through so much violence in the past few years,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t do any good to have this show of thousands of extra police unless you tell every Olympic athlete to walk the street with a policeman by his side. \u201d The Olympics, she said, had actually increased bloodshed  \u2014   but only in the vast favelas, where the police have been battling militias and drug gangs. In Complexo do Alem\u00e3o, a large group of favelas, a   of gun battles since the start of the Olympics has left at least two residents dead and two police officials wounded. \u201cPolice forces are invading the favelas every day and killing people, which is outrageous,\u201d Ms. Lemgruber said. \u201cHow can anyone hope to bring peace by spreading violence?\u201d Heder Martins de Oliveira, the vice president of Brazil\u2019s National Association of Police Officers, said that the killing of the officer in Rio last week pointed to the risks that security forces faced daily in the city. Referring to the wave of armed assaults during the Games, he said, \u201cThe situation would be even worse, an international disgrace, if dedicated police weren\u2019t doing their job at this time. \u201d \u201cOf course, there\u2019s more attention to these episodes because they\u2019re taking place when the world is looking at Rio,\u201d Mr. Martins de Oliveira said. \u201cBut this is a dilemma that Rio faces on a daily basis. \u201d The police have also been involved in violent episodes blemishing the Olympics. Over the weekend, an   federal police official opened fire in the direction of a man he was brawling with at Rio Scenarium, a downtown nightclub. It was not clear whether anyone was seriously injured. Amid the surge in lawlessness, many residents have found a measure of solace on social media, where they commiserate about their experiences and document each episode of crime in hopes of spurring the authorities to action. Among dozens of Facebook groups focused on crime is \u201cWhere I was robbed,\u201d a   map containing dots that form a road map of brutalization and despair. \u201cHello, hello, authorities!\u201d one Facebook user, Eliane Cattapan, wrote recently. \u201cWith the arrival of all the tourists, I\u2019m much more afraid of the rise in street crime than terrorism. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561757.0639262}
