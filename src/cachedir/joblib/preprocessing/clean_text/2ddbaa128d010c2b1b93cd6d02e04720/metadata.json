In fact, it\u2019s looking more and more likely that by his very first day in office, Donald Trump will be the most corrupt president ever. \\nMSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews and MSNBC\u2019s Chief Legal Analyst, Ari Melber are among several who are beginning to wake up to the reality that Trump plans on using the presidency in the very worst way possible, in a way that would have the Founding Fathers rolling in their graves. Our first self-described billionaire President Elect plans on using the presidency to make himself and his family even more wealthy. \\nOne of the biggest problems, as Matthew sees it, is that Trump wants to give his children national security clearance and everything that goes along with it, all while letting them take the reigns of the Trump fortune. This is illegal in so many ways. \\nAs Melber points out, hiring family was banned in an anti-nepotism law passed in 1967. Proponents of the law were especially concerned because a President should be free to fire staff and cabinet members, but that can be tough to do if staff or cabinet members are family. Trump\u2019s workaround for the nepotism law, though, is to not give his family members official titles, but still, he hopes to include them in his decision making processes and let them sit in on critical meetings. \\nHere\u2019s the thought and anger provoking video: \\nWhile Matthews\u2019 and Melber\u2019s discussion was mostly theoretical, there are already real-life consequences to Trump\u2019s glaring conflicts of interests. \\nThe Washington Post on Friday reported that about 100 foreign diplomats are trying to curry favor with the Trump administration by booking rooms in Trump\u2019s Washington DC hotel, sometimes at rates of up to $20,000 a night. If you recall, the Clinton Foundation was accused of offering access in exchange for donations. The evidence that that ever happened was weak, but still, it was something that Trump didn\u2019t let go of during his entire campaign. The idea that Trump would be hosting diplomats, in his hotel, to profit his company, is way beyond anything Clinton is accused of. \\nThat\u2019s not even the tip of the iceberg. While he did settle the Trump University fraud case, Trump apparently Underreported: \\nTrump owes millions to Deutsche Bank \\nwhich is being fined for $14 billion by DoJ \\nwhich Trump will oversee as POTUS pic.twitter.com/vd724yNjYZ \\n\u2014 Adam Khan (@Khanoisseur) October 7, 2016 \\n\u201d target=\u201d_blank\u201d>owes millions to Deutsche Bank, a bank which is being fined by the Department of Justice. Will Trump drop the fines in exchange for Deutsche Bank dropping their claim? Perhaps Trump will uncharacteristically take the high road (doubtful), but no president should have that power to begin with. \\nI\u2019m sure as we turn over even more rocks, we\u2019ll find far more conflicts of interest and evidence that Trump only ran for office for personal enrichment. \\nThere\u2019s a reason elected officials are supposed to put all their assets into blind trusts (and handing them over to their kids is the exact opposite of a blind trust). Governments are not in the business of making money. Trump is. That\u2019s a conflict of interest and it should be deemed unacceptable by all Americans. '"}, "time": 1742562410.9019897}
