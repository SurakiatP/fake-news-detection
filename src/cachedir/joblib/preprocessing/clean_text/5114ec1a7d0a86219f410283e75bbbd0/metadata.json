[\u201cWhen you talked about Margaret Sanger, all the people who follow eugenics. It was all about cleansing,\u201d the America\u2019s Got Talent host said of Planned Parenthood\u2019s founder in a recent interview with DJ Vlad.  \u201cMargaret Sanger said that she wanted to exterminate the negro race, and that she was going to use her organization as she founded to do so,\u201d Cannon continued. \u201cIt was more about the sterilization and where it comes to actual ethnic cleansing  \u2014   where they actually said we want to get rid of a class of people a group of people. \u201c  percent of them are all in the hood. \u201d \u201cThey like to label \u2018 \u2019 or \u2018\u2019 that\u2019s what they used in public. In private, they were talking about the black community,\u201d Cannon said.  The      says the issue of abortion is more personal than political. \u201cI\u2019m   because my mother did go to an abortion clinic to abort me,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like the government should have the right. I don\u2019t feel like any organization that makes money should have the right to tell a woman what she can or cannot do with her body. \u201d Cannon says while Planned Parenthood  \u2014   like the government  \u2014   does some good things, it should be held accountable for \u201call the negative things. \u201d Last month, Cannon accused Planned Parenthood of committing \u201creal genocide\u201d on black Americans. \u201cHillary was sneaking and cheating,\u201d Cannon said in an interview with \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d radio show. \u201cThink about all the stuff they did with Planned Parenthood and all that type of stuff. That type of stuff is to take our community  \u2014   and forget gentrification, it\u2019s real genocide, and it\u2019s been like that for years. \u201d   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson'"}, "time": 1742564587.4083433}
