It did me, at any rate. My copy, I notice, has some grease stains in it, a few red pepper flakes, a stubby bit of mint. \u201cSweetbitter\u201d will be consumed with special avidity by young food people  \u2014   sommeliers, cheesemakers, sous chefs, managers, pastry wizards  \u2014   who dream of making it in the big city, or at least of making it by   standards. It\u2019s an unpretentious,     novel  \u2014   bought by Knopf  in an     deal  \u2014   that reads like a letter home from a   friend. In this case, that friend is named Tess, like Thomas Hardy\u2019s heroine and Melanie Griffith\u2019s striving secretary in \u201cWorking Girl. \u201d This Tess is 22 when she escapes her unnamed hometown and its \u201ctwin pillars of football and church\u201d and drives into Manhattan. \u201cLet\u2019s say I was born in late June of 2006 when I came over the George Washington Bridge at 7 a. m.,\u201d she says, \u201cwith the sun circulating and dawning, the sky full of sharp corners of light, before the exhaust rose, before the heat gridlocked in, windows unrolled, radio turned up to some impossibly hopeful pop song, open, open, open. \u201d Thanks to her poise and friendly good looks, Tess finds a job as an apprentice server at a restaurant that\u2019s clearly modeled after Union Square Cafe, one of Manhattan\u2019s best. (The author has worked at Union Square Cafe and at another cheerful restaurant, Buvette.) She finds a scuzzy apartment in a cheap section of Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Tess falls deeply into her work and feels the city begin to unfold for her. Ms. Danler is a sensitive observer of the almost wartime camaraderie among workers at a restaurant that\u2019s humming at full capacity, of the exhaustion, of the postshift drinking in dive bars until dawn, of the sex and other stimulants  \u2014   the biggest one simply being young and alive and open to the animal and intellectual possibilities that New York offers. Once upon a time, this sort of aspirational, young person\u2019s novel was written about writers and artists. Food workers are climbing the status ladder. Now these novels are about chefs or even, in this case, servers. This book has an onrushing \u201cBright Lights, Big City\u201d vibe and falls into an emerging genre you might call Bright Lights, Small Plates. A restaurant, like a platoon in a war novel, allows a writer to deploy a large cast with relative ease. In \u201cSweetbitter\u201d we meet a handsome if   young bartender (\u201cHe drank like he was the only person who understood beer\u201d) an enigmatic female head server who is Tess\u2019s mentor and tormentor a harried chef a manager who does more than ogle his favorite female employees. None feel like stereotypes. A subtle sense of melancholy hangs over these men and women. They\u2019re happy to be where they are in fact, they feel chosen. But they\u2019re nearly all here because of other dreams that were thwarted. They\u2019re failed poets or academics. Tess had hoped to be a photographer. \u201cSweetbitter\u201d is the story of Tess\u2019s sentimental education. We don\u2019t learn much about her past. But in Manhattan we watch her  \u2014   she is vulnerable but rarely weak  \u2014   pour herself full with books and art and music, and blossom like a daisy. Mostly she fills herself with lovely things to eat and drink. Tess isn\u2019t a hipster (\u201cI cared too much about the wrong things\u201d). And Ms. Danler isn\u2019t another Anthony Bourdain manqu\u00e9, delivering a caustic expos\u00e9. She takes the reader by the hand as Tess learns dozens of lessons, from distinguishing among varieties of oysters, types of winter lettuce and appellations of Burgundy to opening wine properly to appreciating a pig\u2019s head terrine. Tess knows she will, at some point, want more than this. But for now this punishing life feels like ravishment. When a college acquaintance comes into the restaurant one night and condescends to her, only politeness prevents her from speaking aloud: \u201cI chose this life because it\u2019s a constant assault of color and taste and light and it\u2019s raw and ugly and fast and it\u2019s mine. And you\u2019ll never understand. Until you live it, you don\u2019t know. \u201d This novel, which reads a bit like a food world version of Curtis Sittenfeld\u2019s \u201cPrep,\u201d gets off to a bad start. You notice that its four sections are named after the seasons, as if they were George Winston albums. At the beginning there are gimmicky interpolated sections about things like the nature of sweet versus sour. You fear you may be headed into a genre fiction tunnel of love. Those fears are quickly dispelled. Ms. Danler is a gifted commenter (chilly autumn air in Manhattan \u201ctasted of steel knives and filtered water\u201d) on many things, class especially. An awareness of privilege runs through this novel like a tendon. \u201cIf you\u2019re good at this job,\u201d she asks, \u201cwhat exactly are you good at?\u201d \u201cSweetbitter\u201d grows darker than you might expect, in terms of where Tess\u2019s desires lead her. It\u2019s a book about hunger of every variety, even the sort that can disturb you and make you sometimes ask yourself, as does Tess, \u201cWas I a monster or was this what it felt like to be a person?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742561698.985349}
