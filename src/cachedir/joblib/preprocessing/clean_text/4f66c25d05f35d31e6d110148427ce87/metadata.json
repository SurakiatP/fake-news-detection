Waving French flags in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower, thousands have gathered to show support for conservative Francois Fillon\u2019s troubled presidential candidacy. The Paris rally could be Fillon\u2019s last stand, amid growing pressure on him to quit the race because of corruption allegations. Dozens of buses brought supporters from around France, while riot police stood guard around the Place de Trocadero. Retirees Luc and Marie Houllier braved rainy, blustery weather to denounce what they see as a   investigation of   jobs for Fillon\u2019s family.

Older people, who make up Fillon\u2019s most loyal voter base, constituted a large part of Sunday\u2019s crowd, along with parents of young children.   are also being held.  \u2014   11:00 a. m.

If Fillon quits, many conservatives want Alain Juppe to run in his place for the     vote. Fillon was once the   but polls now favor centrist Emmanuel Macron and   leader Marine Le Pen.'"}, "time": 1742561934.4524016}
