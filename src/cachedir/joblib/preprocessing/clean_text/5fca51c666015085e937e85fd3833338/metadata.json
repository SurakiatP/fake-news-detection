We\u2019re aware. We have calculators. \\n\u201cBut I fear that West Ham had us rather over a barrel on this one because it\u2019s not like we could sell it as a call centre or a massive open-air TK Maxx. \\n\u201cAnd other football teams, for example Liverpool, Fleetwood Town and fucking Ross fucking County FC found the north London location rather inconvenient for them. \\n\u201cPerhaps we should have left it as a habitat for the grey heron, maybe they could have scraped together \u00a3500 million from selling their eggs or something.\u201d \\nShare:'"}, "time": 1742562229.001142}
