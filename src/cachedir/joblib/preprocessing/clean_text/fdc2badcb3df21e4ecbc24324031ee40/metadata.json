There is mayhem everywhere. We have already had reports of suicides, murders, robberies, cyclones, earthquakes, and Rohit Sharma\u2019s ouster from Indian squad because of demonetisation, and now we have the first case of HIV that this dreadful ban has caused. \\nThe incident happened when a man contracted the disease from an already infected ATM machine in Mumbai. Despite numerous warnings issued by India Today and other media houses about ATM keypads transmitting the virus, he went to an ATM and touched the dangerous keypad. He was later diagnosed with HIV positive. \\n\u201cSo did he actually have sex with the machine?\u201d we asked an insider from India Today. \\n\u201cNo, but withdrawing cash is as good as having sex with the machine. You have more or less the same feeling when you get the cash in your hand,\u201d he affirmed. \\n\u201cOk that\u2019s interesting. So the engineering students are not virgins anymore and they can proudly brag about their sex lives.\u201d \\n\u201cWell, technically speaking, yes, they can.\u201d \\n\u201cSo, who is at risk of catching the virus? Someone with a poor immune system?\u201d \\n\u201cNo, anyone who is withdrawing cash from an ATM.\u201d \\n\u201cYou mean, balance inquiries and other transactions are safe, right?\u201d \\n\u201cWho stands in the queue for 3 hours to check balance?\u201d \\n\u201cOh ok, you are talking about the current scenario.\u201d \\n\u201cYes, people should avoid an ATM machine at any cost because it may cause STD as our researcher suggested, and once you are infected with an STD, you become more susceptible to HIV infection.\u201d \\n\u201cAnd who is the researcher at India Today you are referring to? Is it Rajdeep Sardesai?\u201d \\n\u201cNo, he is in Goa. The person who published the report is Jane Carlton.\u201d \\n\u201cOk but the report was published in 2014. Why are you linking it to currency ban?\u201d \\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s always relevant.\u201d \\n\u201cBut what made you search the report two years after it was published and exactly at a time when people are desperately trying to use ATMs? We are just curious, what was going through your mind when you decided to look it up and what were the keywords you entered into Google that returned this report?\u201d \\n\u201cListen, I think I am done with the interview. If you have more questions then ask Rajdeep Sardesai. I am going to call him. Here are your boxing gloves.\u201d \\n\u201cBut you said he is in Goa,\u201d we hurriedly wrapped-up the interview.'"}, "time": 1742561687.111668}
