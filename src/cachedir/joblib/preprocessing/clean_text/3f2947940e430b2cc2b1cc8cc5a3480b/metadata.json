Obamacare is uniquely awful because the free stuff isn\u2019t paid for through income taxes: It\u2019s paid for through MY health insurance premiums. This is unfortunate because I wanted to buy health insurance. Perhaps you\u2019re not aware  \u2014   SINCE YOU EXEMPTED YOURSELVES FROM OBAMACARE, CONGRESS  \u2014   but buying or selling health insurance is illegal in America. Right now, there\u2019s no free market because insurance is insanely regulated not only by Obamacare, but also by the most corrupt organizations in America: state insurance commissions. (I\u2019m talking to you, New York!) Federal and state laws make it illegal to sell health insurance that doesn\u2019t cover a laughable array of supposedly vital services based on bureaucrats\u2019 medical opinions of which providers have the best lobbyists. As a result, it\u2019s illegal to sell health insurance that covers any of the medical problems I\u2019d like to insure against. Why can\u2019t the GOP keep Obamacare for the greedy  \u2014   but make it legal for Ann to buy health insurance? This is how it works today: ME: I\u2019m perfectly healthy, but I\u2019d like to buy health insurance for heart disease, broken bones, cancer, and everything else that a normal person would ever need, but no more. INSURANCE COMPANY: That will be $700 a month, the deductible is $35, 000, no decent hospital will take it, and you have to pay for doctor\u2019s visits yourself. But your plan covers shrinks, infertility treatments, sex change operations, autism spectrum disorder treatment, drug rehab and 67 other things you will never need. INSURANCE COMPANY UNDER ANN\u2019S PLAN: That will be $50 a month, the deductible is $1, 000, you can see any doctor you\u2019d like, and you have full coverage for any important medical problems you could conceivably have in a million years. Mine is a   plan (and you don\u2019t have to do the second step, so it\u2019s really a   plan). STEP 1: Congress doesn\u2019t repeal Obamacare! Instead, Congress passes a law, pursuant to its constitutional power to regulate interstate commerce, that says: \u201cIn America, it shall be legal to sell health insurance on the free market. This law supersedes all other laws, taxes, mandates, coverage requirements, regulations or prohibitions, state or federal. \u201d The end. Love, Ann. There will be no whining single mothers storming Congress with their   placards. People who want to stay on Obamacare can. No one is taking away anything. They can still have health insurance with free pony rides. It just won\u2019t be paid for with Ann\u2019s premiums anymore, because Ann will now be allowed to buy health insurance on the free market. Americans will be free to choose among a variety of health insurance plans offered by willing sellers, competing with one another to provide the best plans at the lowest price. A nationwide market in health insurance will drive down costs and improve access  \u2014   just like everything else we buy here in America! Within a year, most Americans will be buying health insurance on the free market (and half of the rest will be illegal aliens). We\u2019ll have TV ads with cute little geckos hawking amazing plans and young couples bragging about their broad coverage and great prices from this or that insurance company. The Obamacare plans will still have the \u201cessential benefits\u201d (free pony rides) that are so important to NPR\u2019s Mara Liasson, but the free market plans will have whatever plans consumers agree to buy and insurance companies agree to sell  \u2014   again, just like every other product we buy here in America. Some free market plans will offer all the \u201cessential benefits\u201d mandated by Obamacare, but the difference will be: Instead of forcing me to pay a premium that covers Mara Liasson\u2019s special needs, she\u2019ll have to pay for that coverage herself. I won\u2019t be compelled to buy health insurance that covers everyone else\u2019s gambling addiction, drug rehab, pregnancies, marital counseling, social workers, contact lenses and rotten kids  \u2014   simply to have insurance for what doctors call \u201cserious medical problems. \u201d Then, we\u2019ll see how many people really need free health care. Until the welfare program is decoupled from the insurance market, nothing will work. Otherwise, it\u2019s like forcing grocery stores to pay for everyone to have a house. A carton of milk would suddenly cost $10, 000. That\u2019s what Obamacare did to health insurance. Paul Ryan\u2019s solution was to cut taxes on businesses  \u2014   and make the milk watery. But he still wouldn\u2019t allow milk to be sold on the free market. Democrats will be in the position of blocking American companies from selling a product that people want to buy. How will they explain that to voters? Perhaps Democrats will come out and admit that they need to fund health insurance for the poor by forcing   Americans to pay for it through their insurance premiums  \u2014   because otherwise, they\u2019d have to raise taxes, and they want to keep their Wall Street buddies\u2019 income taxes low. Good luck with that! STEP 2: Next year, Congress formulates a better way of delivering health care to the welfare cases, which will be much easier since there will be a LOT fewer of them. No actual   business is going to survive by taking the welfare cases  \u2014   the ones that will cover illegal aliens and Mara Liasson\u2019s talk therapy  \u2014   so the greedy will get government plans. But by then, only a minority of Americans will be on the \u201cfree\u201d plans. (Incidentally, this will be a huge    \u2014   if anyone cares about the federal budget.) Eighty percent of Americans will already have good health plans sold to them by insurance companies competing for their business. With cheap plans available, a lot of the greedy will go ahead and buy a free market plan. Who wants to stand in line at the DMV to see a doctor when your neighbors have great health care plans for $50 a month? We will have separated the truly unfortunate from the loudmouthed bullies who simply enjoy forcing other people to pay for their shrinks and aromatherapy. And if the Democrats vote against a sane method of delivering health care to the welfare cases, who cares? We have lots of wasteful government programs  \u2014   take it out of Lockheed Martin\u2019s contract. But at least the government won\u2019t be depriving the rest of us of a crucial product just because we are middle class and the Democrats hate us. There\u2019s your health care bill, GOP!
