Time for a trip to the movies. Here is a look at five films that Times editors recommend after that last piece of pumpkin pie. If You Want a Family Film for Younger Kids Disney\u2019s latest animated offering tells the story of an adventurous teenager (Auli\u2019i Cravalho) in search of the demigod Maui (Dwayne Johnson). The visuals are lush and the songs (some written by the \u201cHamilton\u201d creator   Miranda) are lively, with plenty to hold the whole family\u2019s attention. If it\u2019s sold out: With crowds expected for \u201cMoana,\u201d you may need a second choice. Consider \u201cTrolls,\u201d another     animated movie that has been in theaters a bit longer. If You Want a Family Film for Older Kids Harry Potter himself may not be back, but the wizarding world is at the center of this new film written by J. K. Rowling. The setting is 1926 New York and Eddie Redmayne plays Newt Scamander, a wizard with a suitcase full of unruly creatures. Kids who grew up on the Harry Potter series should feel at home here. The Times critic Manohla Dargis found the titular beasts a highlight, writing, \u201cWith the strange caws and showy displays, these beasties provide a lot of the movie\u2019s easygoing pleasures. \u201d If it\u2019s sold out: Consider \u201cDoctor Strange,\u201d Marvel\u2019s latest \u201cgiddily enjoyable\u201d    adventure film that has been a big draw at the box office, but should be a little easier to get into now that it has been out a few weeks longer. If You Want to Get Away From Family  Done playing nice around the dinner table and seeking a break from the family this holiday? Try this irreverent sequel to the irreverent comedy that became a hit in 2003. Billy Bob Thornton is back as the boozing, womanizing title character. (Did you know he wasn\u2019t the first or even second choice for the role? Find out more in this oral history of the first film.) If You Want to Get Serious After the Holiday For the kind of film that will offer substance as well as a ray of hope, try the   drama \u201cArrival. \u201d Amy Adams plays a linguist who figures out a way to communicate with alien visitors. It has sleek visual effects and a twisty narrative. In her review, Manohla Dargis praised the lead performance, writing, \u201cBy turns inviting and opaque, Ms. Adams turns softness and quiet into heroic qualities, keeping her voice low, modulated, and using stillness to draw you near. \u201d If You Want to Keep It Light After Thanksgiving Turkey Stuffed from the meal and in search of a movie that will go down easy? Try the comedy \u201cAlmost Christmas. \u201d The ensemble film focuses on an Alabama family gathering for the holiday, with comic turns from Danny Glover, Gabrielle Union, Omar Epps, J. B. Smoove and a wisecracking Mo\u2019Nique, whom the critic Glenn Kenny called \u201csimply magnificent\u201d in his Times review.'"}, "time": 1742628346.1642404}
