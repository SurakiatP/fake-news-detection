They came in search of what is known as caterpillar fungus, or yarsagumba in Nepali. A parasitic fungus, it forms  out of the head of ghost moth larvae living in the soil at altitudes above 10, 000 feet, and has been used as an aphrodisiac for at least a thousand years, earning it the nickname Himalayan Viagra. In the 1980s, the pickers used to trade the fungus for cigarettes and noodles. But as yarsagumba grew in popularity, it exploded into a   industry spanning China, Singapore and the United States. During the picking season, which runs from late May to July, the number of harvesters in Bagdanda and two neighboring camps has often reached several thousands of people. But this season, with the fungus becoming scarce, the number is down to the hundreds. They still hike from a camp below, carrying metal picks to dig out the fungus, helping to produce an average regional harvest of 135 tons a year. Occasionally, they stop at Mr. Rokaya\u2019s tent to buy sheep\u2019s curd. Most of the time they pass through, teetering on a steep hillside where they spend the morning hunched over to find the fungus\u2019s crooked black stem poking through the dirt. Folklore has it that interest in the fungus stems from the startling performance of Chinese runners at an international track meet in 1993, which their coach attributed to their consumption of a soup combining the fungus with turtle blood. (Western competitors suspected something less exotic, namely   drugs.) With prices topping $50, 000 a pound in China\u2019s coastal megacities, harvesting of the fungus has helped to curb endemic poverty in the Himalayas, which stretch across Nepal, northern India, Bhutan, Tibet and China. For hundreds of thousands of people living in remote villages, selling yarsagumba has become a primary source of income. A study by Nepal\u2019s central bank found that harvesters earned an average of about $2, 500, or 56 percent of their yearly income, selling the fungus. Money from yarsagumba has given some of the world\u2019s most impoverished people access to electricity, hospital care and education. \u201cThe whole Tibetan plateau is by now completely dependent on the cash influx,\u201d said Daniel Winkler, a mycologist who has studied the caterpillar fungus extensively in Tibet. He estimated that over one million people in Tibet sell the fungus. But as quickly as demand for the fungus has surged, its supply has dropped sharply. Mycologists studying the fungus point to overharvesting as one reason. But another possible cause, some researchers now believe, is a warmer ecosystem precipitated by climate change, a phenomenon that may be more acute at higher altitudes. \u201cThere are strong theoretical reasons as to why we might expect the rate of climate change to be faster higher up in the mountains than it is at sea level,\u201d said Nicholas Pepin, a geographer at the University of Portsmouth in England. Some of the most compelling data comes from the Tibetan plateau, where from 2001 to 2012, the increase in temperatures was between half a degree Fahrenheit and nearly an entire degree at weather stations above 10, 000 feet. In the same decade, global temperatures rose by only about 0. 2 degrees. Scientists say it is unclear why mountain ranges may be warming more rapidly than other parts of the planet. But Kamaljit Bawa, a biologist at the University of Massachusetts Boston, said failure to better understand warming in the Himalayas could have serious consequences for the region\u2019s unique biodiversity. \u201cWe have to make very rapid progress,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t use the slow approach, the traditional, slow scientific approach. \u201d Not for yarsagumba, apparently. As harvesters returned from the pastures to Bagdanda on a recent afternoon, children gathered in the camp\u2019s dusty thoroughfare and divided teams for a volleyball game. A mother held down her squirming daughter to pick lice from her scalp. Men congregated on   dirt mounds and peeled strips of kutki, an herb used to treat vomiting and fever. In a village below the meadows, Prithvi Budha, 60, a beekeeper who is sitting out the harvest to watch dozens of empty mud and stone huts, said less precipitation might be the cause for the drop in yarsagumba supplies. \u201cWe used to have snow up to here and up to here,\u201d he said, pointing to his torso and his shoulders as he recalled a string of childhood winters. Uttam Shrestha, a researcher at the University of Southern Queensland in Australia, said it was difficult to say why the supply of yarsagumba had dropped. Changes in temperature, he said, could be one of several factors affecting the supply of the fungus. \u201cWe can draw some inferences,\u201d he said. \u201cHere, the fungus is very sensitive to the increase in temperature and so that could have an impact, but there is no empirical evidence yet. \u201d Jir Bahadur Budha, 43, a farmer, said he was disappointed with this year\u2019s harvest. He estimated that his family of six would collect only 400 pieces of yarsagumba, 200 fewer than last year and 500 fewer than the year before. The selling price for a single piece is about $3. 50 in Nepal. On a recent morning, Mr. Budha joined dozens of others in a pasture as a heavy fog set in. Within 10 minutes of searching, calls echoed from a few hundred feet away, where a teenager had spotted one of the day\u2019s first pieces. Clawing away dirt from the larva\u2019s body, the boy received a smattering of congratulations. He had found a good piece. \u201cOnly lucky people find yarsagumba in the morning,\u201d one man said. Mr. Rokaya, the shepherd, was cautious in his appraisal of the day\u2019s pickings. Whatever the reason for the decline in yarsagumba, he said, it may be too late to salvage what has been lost. \u201cNo jobs. No money. What to do?\u201d he said, thrumming his fingers on a gnarled cane. \u201cWe eat the rice that even donkeys and horses don\u2019t eat. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564127.720253}
