It has also sucked the oxygen at social gatherings, according to a number of New Yorkers who are regulars on the party circuit. At any recent outing, the acrimonious contest between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump is the elephant in the room, the uninvited guest. The subject can derail restaurant conversation, make hostages of   guests and drive a wedge between host and guest. At a dinner with friends Saturday, the literary agent Chris Calhoun, thinking the conversation would be about a play they were about to see, found himself in a heated discussion of poll numbers,   races, the rise to celebrity of Kellyanne Conway and the barbs swapped by Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump at the recent Al Smith dinner, which, to his amazement, all of his fellow diners had watched live on CNN. \u201cWe were at the Library at the Public Theater, having dinner before seeing \u2018Plenty,\u2019\u201d Mr. Calhoun said, \u201cand we sort of agreed not to talk about politics, because we were exhausted by the subject. \u201cBut then someone remembered that one of the plot turns in the play revolved around the Suez crisis and the fall of the British government. But none of us could remember exactly what had happened and who the prime minister was then. So we went on Wikipedia and started to read out loud the bio of Anthony Eden, which included the description of him as the \u2018puppet\u2019 of the U. S. government. \u201d The word immediately reminded everyone present of the moment in the third presidential debate when the two nominees accused each other of being a puppet to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. \u201c\u2018Puppet!\u2019 we all cried out, and the next thing you know we were talking about the debate  \u2014   \u2018Putin\u2019s puppet,\u2019 \u2018No, you\u2019re the puppet\u2019  \u2014   and then went on to the Al Smith dinner,\u201d he said. \u201cWe ended up spending the next hour rehashing the entire campaign, after we had sworn not to. Luckily, we finally realized that the curtain was about to go up or we might have been there all night. \u201d Alex Badia, the style director at Women\u2019s Wear Daily, had a similar experience while dining with friends at Soho House. \u201cAt one point we said, \u2018We have to stop talking about this,\u2019\u201d Mr. Badia said. \u201cWe talked about what we\u2019re doing for Thanksgiving and very quickly we went back to Trump, back to the election. All roads lead to Trump. I just think it is so present in people\u2019s minds. \u201d The subject of the campaign became so loaded for the novelist Jay McInerney that his wife, the publishing heiress Anne Hearst, has told him to steer clear of campaign conversation at the dinner parties they have hosted. Ms. Hearst made the request not long after Mr. McInerney lost his cool at a Southampton gathering where the guests were split between Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton. \u201cThe host went around the room and asked everybody who they were voting for and why,\u201d Mr. McInerney said. \u201cAnd emotions ran really high, to the point that I felt it kind of cast a little bit of a pall at the dinner party. Almost everybody gave an opinion, and mine was stridently  . \u201d He has tried to rein it in since then. \u201cI think the subject became kind of toxic,\u201d Mr. McInerney said. \u201cWe give a fair number of dinner parties out there, and Anne sort of cautioned me, \u2018No politics.\u2019 That\u2019s never happened before. Usually, we do talk politics. A certain \u2018don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u2019 policy went into effect. \u201d Even among   party guests, the talk no longer flows as it used to during previous election cycles, instead devolving into   rants that can function as conversation killers. \u201cIt always comes up at some point,\u201d said Wendy Goodman, a design editor at New York magazine who supports Hillary Clinton. \u201cBut even if people agree, I think this has been the most toxic, deranged campaign year I have ever known in my life. I think everybody is so beaten down by how depressing it is. \u201d Christophe Lirola, an investment banker in New York who supports Mr. Trump, has found himself in odd social situations because of his preference. He recalled a party at the Waverly Inn restaurant in Greenwich Village during which his boss sought him out on behalf of a guest who wanted to see a Trump supporter in the flesh, as if he were an exotic creature in the Manhattan wild. Mr. Lirola has also endured the awkwardness of finding himself among fellow party guests who come to realize he does not share their disdain for the Republican nominee. This happened recently, he said, when he was found himself among a group that included the socialite Lucy Sykes. \u201cWe were outside of the party, just catching some air, and they all started talking about the election, and it had just slipped her mind that I was supporting him,\u201d Mr. Lirola said. \u201cAnd then she just stopped herself and said, \u2018Oh, my God, I\u2019m so sorry.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018That\u2019s O. K.\u2019 That stuff happens. \u201d Asked if he found it difficult, when others in his circle assume he shares their views, Mr. Lirola said: \u201cWell, no one wants to be called a racist. I\u2019ve been called a racist because of this. Online and in person. \u201d Rachel Hruska MacPherson, a founder and the chief executive of the society and fashion website Guest of a Guest, bemoaned the effect of the campaign on the quality of social conversation. \u201cMy favorite thing is to go to a dinner party and talk about politics,\u201d Ms. Hruska MacPherson said. \u201cI love when there\u2019s a healthy difference of opinion and it gets heated. In the past, everyone\u2019s done this so respectfully, because we\u2019ve had candidates who at least have had some substance. But this race has been unlike anything any of us have seen. \u201d She blames Mr. Trump for this side effect. \u201cWe want to talk about what Hillary\u2019s campaign has done wrong,\u201d Ms. Hruska MacPherson said. \u201cInstead, he\u2019s brought everyone down, and we\u2019re forced to just rehash, like, \u2018Can you believe it? \u2019\u201d In that case, why not avoid the subject at social events? \u201cWe can\u2019t help ourselves,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the topic of conversation at every single thing I go to. \u201d The fashion publicist Bonnie Morrison has grown weary of all the campaign talk. \u201cEveryone\u2019s saying the same thing, and I think everyone has used their social media platforms to become pundits,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one\u2019s saying anything original. People are just baiting each other and trying to get reactions out of each other. There\u2019s no real activism. What you actually had, I feel, with Obama is that people were really motivated to be involved. \u201d So what should people be doing instead of discussing the campaign? \u201cPeople should be giving money to Haiti,\u201d Ms. Morrison said. In previous campaign seasons, people interviewed for this article said, those who found themselves at different points on the political spectrum could voice their views with less risk of creating problems in social settings. Such is not the case this time around. The actor and director Lake Bell and her husband, the tattoo artist Scott Campbell, endured an awkward few days recently when a longtime friend of Mr. Campbell\u2019s was staying at their Los Angeles home. The problem set in when the couple asked the houseguest to join them for their Sunday night ritual of watching \u201cLast Week Tonight With John Oliver,\u201d a show that consistently skewers Mr. Trump. \u201cWe retired to the comfy couches in the TV room with our   beverages and our kale popsicles that we pretend to like,\u201d Ms. Bell said. \u201cWe said, \u2018Do you watch John Oliver?\u2019 And he\u2019s like: \u2018I\u2019ve never heard about. Sounds interesting. I\u2019d love to see it. \u2019\u201d A few minutes into the show, they could sense something had gone awry. \u201cWe noticed he was getting really uncomfortable,\u201d Mr. Campbell said of his friend, whom he has known since his youth in Texas and Louisiana. Ms. Bell tried to defend Mr. Oliver as an   satirist, to no avail. \u201cAt that point he got up and said, \u2018Gosh, you know I\u2019m feeling pretty tired and I feel like I might go to bed now, just because I don\u2019t want my head to be clouded with all this kind of business before I go to sleep,\u2019\u201d Ms. Bell said. \u201cSo that was the polite sort of Southern gentleman way of excusing himself. \u201d As part of his work, Darren Walker, the president of the Ford Foundation, often attends social events with all kinds of people. Partly because of his experience in this regard, he has figured out how to defuse disagreements before they become standoffs. At a luncheon in Austin, Tex. where he had given a graduation speech for the University of Texas School of Law, he found himself seated next to a woman from South Texas. \u201cShe had the largest Rolex watch with diamonds I have ever seen,\u201d Mr. Walker said. \u201cAnd what happened was, she said: \u2018Oh, you\u2019re with the Ford Foundation? I\u2019m sure I won\u2019t agree with you on many things.\u2019 And I said: \u2018Actually, I\u2019m sure we have lots in common. We both love our country. We both are proud to be Texans. And we\u2019re both proud graduates of the University of Texas. \u2019\u201d After having thus disarmed his tablemate, Mr. Walker managed to pull of a rare feat: a calm and candid conversation between ideological opponents. \u201cIt was a   conversation, punctuated by her sharing with me her views of why America is going to hell in a handbasket,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd my response was to try to understand her motivation. I genuinely wanted to understand how she and I saw things so differently. \u201d During the course of the conversation, the woman mentioned that her husband had warned her not to discuss politics in social situations. But Mr. Walker was glad she did, and his method may work for those who find themselves in a similar predicament in the days between now and Election Day. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful to vilify people you don\u2019t agree with,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t see her as a villain. What I saw in listening to her was a privileged, white woman who is deeply disturbed by an America that looks less like her and more like me. \u201cI can empathize with how threatening it must be to imagine an America that is more diverse. I said that to her. And she said: \u2018I don\u2019t have a problem with diversity. I just don\u2019t like special treatment for some Americans over other Americans.\u2019 It was a great conversation. And as she and I talked, she became more and more comfortable sharing things like that. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563707.342732}
