[\u201cThe House and Senate Intelligence committees should investigate what she did and why,\u201d the Wall Street Journal argued in an April 28 piece.  Last month, blogger Mike Cernovich and other news outlets reported that Rice had unmasked, or identified the names, of Trump campaign officials caught up during surveillance of a foreign target. The piece said Democrats raised a fuss in 2005 over   Bush official John Bolton doing the same thing but with far more justification, due to the job he held, but are now \u201cgoing all in to squelch\u201d the story. \u201cThen Senators Joe Biden and Chris Dodd kicked up a fuss that, as Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, Mr. Bolton had 10 times over four years asked for the names of American officials who were swept up in National Security Agency monitoring. \u201d \u201cDemocrats and their press allies are going all in to squelch the Susan Rice \u2018unmasking\u2019 story, insisting that the decision by Barack Obama\u2019s national security adviser to seek the name of at least one Trump campaign official was routine and no big deal,\u201d it said. For example, it said, \u201cHouse Intelligence Committee Democrat Adam Schiff released a tutorial on why unmasking is \u2018lawful.\u2019 \u2018Susan Rice Did Nothing Wrong,\u2019 said an NBC headline, quoting no one on the record. \u201d The Wall Street Journal editorial also pointed out that while Rice and Democrats have defended her actions as \u201cnot uncommon,\u201d Democrats and the media in 2005 characterized it as unusual. At that time, Dodd claimed unmasking was \u201crarely requested\u201d and \u201cinfrequently\u201d by \u201cpolitical appointees such as Mr. Bolton. \u201d The New York Times also reported that requests to unmask \u201care not common, particularly from policy makers. \u201d The editorial also argued that there was no apparent reason for Rice to have requested the unmasking of Trump campaign officials\u2019 names, contrary to her explanations. \u201cMs. Rice had no direct intelligence duties in her NSC post, and no Democrat has provided a valid reason that Ms. Rice might have needed to unmask anyone associated with the Trump presidential campaign,\u201d the editorial said. Rice has denied doing anything \u201cuntoward\u201d with the intelligence she received, as did Bolton. But Democrats had drawn up a list of 36 individuals that he clashed with and called on National Intelligence Director John Negroponte to rule out they were the target of Bolton\u2019s unmasking. And while House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes ( ) has stepped aside from his committee\u2019s Russia probe after complaints from   activist groups that he discussed unmasking in public, Democrats in 2005 \u201ccouldn\u2019t stop talking to the press,\u201d the piece said. The piece also pointed out that names unmasked by Bolton have still never made it out to the public, in contrast with the illegal leaking in February of phone conversations held by former Trump National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. \u201cTwelve years on, not one of the 10 individuals unmasked by Mr. Bolton has had his or her identity leaked. By contrast, the Washington Post reports that no fewer than nine Obama appointees or career officials leaked or confirmed the identity and conversations of unmasked former Trump adviser Michael Flynn. \u201cIf John Bolton\u2019s unmasking was questionable, then Mrs. Rice\u2019s was more so. The House and Senate Intelligence committees should investigate what she did and why. \u201d Rice is expected to be among witnesses asked by the House intelligence committee to testify in its ongoing probe of Russian interference in the elections.'"}, "time": 1742564617.050039}
