Dry tinder from an ongoing drought in the area quickly ignited two wildfires after the explosion \u2014 which then charred 31 acres \u2014 and area residents were forced to evacuate without any indication when they would be permitted to return. \\n\u201cThere\u2019s a large plume of smoke; there\u2019s a large fire,\u201d noted Shelby County Sheriff\u2019s Captain Jeff Hartley, as quoted by the Chicago Tribune . \u201cWe\u2019re not sure exactly how it started or what caused it,\u201d he said, adding of the massive deployment of fire and emergency personnel, \u201cWe\u2019ve got first responders entering the area, and a lot of them.\u201d \\nApart from the worker killed, subsequent reports downplayed the extent of injuries suffered by those at the blast site, AL.com reported seven of the \u201ceight or nine\u201d subcontractors working in the area had suffered severe burns from the explosion. According to Shelby County Sheriff John Samaniego, two of those workers \u2014 all of whom had begun digging in an effort to flush one of the lines as repairs continued on the original leak \u2014 may still be missing , though that information was both unconfirmed and unclear because extreme heat from flames emanating at the site of the explosion prevented further assessment. \\nColonial noted in a brief statement cited by a local ABC affiliate that both pipelines \u2014 one transporting gasoline, the other distillates, had been shut down, and, further, \\n\u201cColonial\u2019s top priorities are the health and safety of the work crew on site and protection of the public.\u201d \\nAccording to a later report from Reuters , the fire had been \u2018contained\u2019 by around 9 pm local time \u2014 yet no further word about the possibly-missing subcontractors has been provided.

Reuters explains: \\n\u201cColonial, the biggest refined products system in the United States, is responsible for supplying about one-third of the 3.2 million barrels per day of gasoline consumed on the East Coast, according to U.S. Energy Department data.\u201d \\nFurther, \u201cIt was not clear whether the explosion happened on the gasoline or the distillates pipeline, the governor said in the briefing.\u201d \\nAlthough the aforementioned details handily summarize the facts of the explosion \u2014 occurring during active repairs of the previous, sizeable leak \u2014 the facts do little to quantify potential environmental and health impacts of an explosion and leak of this magnitude. \\nThis explosion of a major pipeline supplying fuel to large portions of the Southeast and East coast serves an ominous portent for ongoing opposition to construction of the hotly contentious Dakota Access Pipeline slated to cross four states, traversing just north of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation in North Dakota. \\nStanding Rock Sioux water protectors and Native Americans and Indigenous peoples from over 200 nations and their supporters fear that pipeline\u2019s route \u2014 undercutting the Missouri River in several places \u2014 threatens to poison the tribal water supply and that of no less than 18 million others living downstream. Indeed, the Colonial Pipeline\u2019s tragic mishap \u2014 the second in essentially the same section of pipe in about one month \u2014 darkly parallels the hundreds of similar accidents such pipelines are prone to. \\nResidents of Bismarck, aware of Big Oil\u2019s horrendous safety record, managed to thwart Energy Transfer Partners\u2019 original plans for the pipeline to be routed near the city \u2014 so ETP, with assistance from the State, diverted Dakota Access to cross just north of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation on privately-owned land. \\nRightly viewed by pipeline opponents as blatant exploitation of Native Americans \u2014 as well as a violation of an 1851 treaty with the U.S. government \u2014 Standing Rock Sioux water protectors and supporters have camped along the Missouri for months in an effort to halt construction as a lawsuit languishes in federal court. \\nBig Oil, Big Banks , and government backers obviously view future profiteering from the pipeline important enough to send in absurdly militarized police from at least five states to combat pipeline opponents \u2014 who have remained on the whole peaceful, prayerful, and unarmed. \\nETP insists the opposition is misguided and Dakota Access offers a safe alternative to the \u2018riskier\u2019 oil transportation methods of railroad and tanker truck \u2014 but even the company\u2019s own records listing thousands of spills in just the last six years flatly dispute such claims. Worse, although pipeline leaks and spills might technically be less frequent than those caused by railroad accidents, the International Energy Agency notes pipeline mishaps leaked three times more crude over an eight-year period. \\nIn fact, Big Oil\u2019s general safety record is nearly impossible to fully track, in part because such spills, leaks, explosions, and other accidents are startlingly common and no less perilous to workers, residents, the environment \u2014 and, yes, the rapidly dwindling water supply. \\nA report by the Center for Effective Government attempting to map and quantify crude and other industry spills found not only are \u201cruptures and leaks a daily occurrence,\u201d but \u201cEighty people have died and 389 have been injured in such incidents in the last five years. \\n\u201cSince 2010, over 3,300 incidents of crude oil and liquefied natural gas leaks or ruptures have occurred on U.S. pipelines. These incidents have killed 80 people, injured 389 more, and cost $2.8 billion in damages. They also released toxic, polluting chemicals in local soil, waterways, and air.\u201d \\nAccording to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, as noted in the report , those spills and ruptures sent 7 million gallons of crude into the environment. Further illustrating the imperative to oppose construction of Dakota Access, one of the worst spills occurred in North Dakota \u2014 not by human error or poor maintenance \u2014 but when lightning struck a crude oil pipeline, spilling 840,000 gallons of crude into a wheat field in 2013. \\nWhile the oil and gas industry and its wealthy proponents in government would attempt to pull the wool over the public\u2019s eyes about pipeline safety, using crafty language and skewed statistics, the truth is, no safe manner for transporting oil and gas actually exists. \\nOpposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline simply isn\u2019t confined to a Native American issue, as exploitive as that facet is \u2014 but when pipelines traverse pristine lands, farm acreage, and the rivers and waterways we depend on to sustain us, we\u2019re all at risk. \\nWhat scant corporate media coverage of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe\u2019s stand against Big Oil does exist has painted the fight as limited in scope; but thousands encamped along the pipeline\u2019s planned route \u2014 who face an unusually bitter winter , no less \u2014 are in fact taking a stand for every person and every creature who would be devastated in the event of a future oil spill.
