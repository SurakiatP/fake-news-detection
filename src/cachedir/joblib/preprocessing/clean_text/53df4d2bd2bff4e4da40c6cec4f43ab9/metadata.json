Rio, however, is experiencing something exceptional: Less than six months after the Summer Games ended, the host city\u2019s Olympic legacy is decaying rapidly. Empty Olympic buildings abound, puncturing any uplifting buzz from the competitions last summer. At the Olympic Park, some stadium entrances are boarded up, and screws are scattered on the ground. The handball arena is barricaded with metal bars. The broadcast center remains half disassembled. The   pool is decorated with piles of dirt and puddles. Deodoro, a neighborhood in Rio\u2019s poor periphery, has the   cluster of Olympic sites. The canoe slalom course was to be converted into a giant public swimming pool. It closed to the public in December. Today, residents fill plastic pools a few hundred feet away. \u201cThe government put sugar in our mouths and took it out before we could swallow,\u201d Luciana Oliveira Pimentel, a social worker from Deodoro, said as her children played in a plastic pool. \u201cOnce the Olympics ended, they turned their backs on us. \u201d Olympic officials and local organizers often boast about the legacy of the Games  \u2014   the residual benefits that a city and country will experience long after the competitions end. Those projections are often met with skepticism by the public and by independent economists, who argue that Olympic bids are built on wasted public money. Rio has quickly become the latest, and perhaps the most striking, case of unfulfilled promises and abandonment. \u201cIt\u2019s totally deserted,\u201d said Vera Hickmann, 42, who was at the Olympic Park recently with her family. She lamented that although the area was open to the public, it lacked basic services. \u201cI had to bring my son over to the plants to go to the bathroom,\u201d she said. At the athletes\u2019 village, across the street from the park, the 31 towers were supposed to be sold as luxury condominiums after the Games, but fewer than 10 percent of the units have been sold. Across town at Maracan\u00e3 Stadium, a soccer temple, the field is brown, and the electricity has been shut off. \u201cThe government didn\u2019t have money to throw a party like that, and we\u2019re the ones who have to sacrifice,\u201d Ms. Hickmann said, referring to local taxpayers. In the preparations for the Games, the city of Rio promised \u201cno white elephants\u201d and outlined plans for facilities to be turned into public sporting areas and schools. The arena that hosted taekwondo and fencing was to be transformed into a school. Two other arenas were to be taken apart, and one put back together as four schools in another area. None of that has happened. The mayor\u2019s office said those plans were still in the works, but it did not offer a specific timetable. The decay of Olympic sites is happening as a financial crisis engulfs federal, state and municipal governments. \u201cThe nation is in crisis, Rio de Janeiro is in crisis  \u2014   it\u2019s time to be cautious,\u201d Marcelo Crivella, who became mayor on Jan. 1, told incoming city council members. \u201cSpending is prohibited,\u201d he added. Rio\u2019s mayor during the Games, Eduardo Paes, was among the strongest evangelizers of an Olympic legacy. He said in an email that it was too soon to call any of the sites white elephants and that \u201cthe path to implementing a legacy has been given. \u201d After the Games, the city held an auction for private companies to bid on administering the Olympic Park, but there were no bidders. That left the Ministry of Sport, an organ of the federal government, with the financial burden. The minister of sport, Leonardo Picciani, said in an interview that the agency\u2019s goal was to find a private company to take over the park, but because there has been no interest, it is the government\u2019s responsibility to maintain the sites. Mr. Picciani also said that the stadiums would not become burdensome relics, pointing to several sporting events scheduled for this year at Olympic Park, along with sports training programs. Renato Cosentino, a researcher at the Regional and Urban Planning Institute at the Federal University of Rio, who studies the Olympic Park region, said the park \u201cwas born as a white elephant,\u201d because it was built in a   wealthy suburb that is home to only about 5 percent of Rio\u2019s 6. 3 million residents. Having the majority of investment there, he said, proves that the Olympics were meant to serve real estate developers, who took on much of the construction for the Games in exchange for being able to build on the land afterward, in what is known as a   partnership. But even developers\u2019 expectations have not panned out. The construction giants Carvalho Hosken and Odebrecht took on the project of building the athletes\u2019 village in hopes of selling the accommodations as luxury condominiums after the Games, banking on the area\u2019s becoming a desirable neighborhood for the city\u2019s elite. In the 31   towers that make up the village, only 20 units have been sold since the beginning of the Olympics in August, bringing the total sold to 260, out of 3, 604 apartments. In a scramble to sell off the apartments before Carvalho Hosken becomes responsible for about $6. 5 million in monthly interest payments (previously paid for by the local organizing committee for the Olympics) the company is in the process of striking a deal with Rio\u2019s city government to sell them to civil servants, such as military personnel, at discounted prices with low interest rates, according to the Brazilian newspaper O Globo. Rio\u2019s prominent soccer stadium, the Maracan\u00e3, which hosted the opening and closing ceremonies, has also fallen into disrepair, with a brown field, several thousand seats uprooted, televisions missing and nearly $1 million owed to the electricity company. The consortium that normally administers the stadium, Maracan\u00e3 S. A. claims that Rio 2016 and the Rio State government did not hold up their end of a contract that required them to maintain the stadium and return it in the state in which it was given to them. The   Deodoro neighborhood was a favorite talking point for Olympic officials before and during the Games. Several sites  \u2014   including those for equestrian events, shooting and field hockey  \u2014   were constructed there, heralded as a shining example of how the Olympics can lift a blighted area. The flagship, however, was the giant swimming pool, used as the canoe slalom course, which opened to the public before the Games. When the pool opened, Mr. Paes, the mayor at the time, beamed. \u201cWe\u2019ve made an early legacy here,\u201d he said. \u201cI think this is something   in the history of the Olympics. \u201d The pool is now closed, though temperatures are regularly in the 90s and the neighborhood is a long bus ride from Rio\u2019s beaches. The current mayor, Mr. Crivella, again said the city intended to reopen the pool as soon as possible, but he did not forecast a date. Close by, the Tri\u00e2ngulo favela community was disrupted to make way for rapid bus lines that were expanded before the Olympics. Several homes and the community\u2019s plaza, its main leisure space, were removed by the construction. Today, a turnaround for the buses looms over where the plaza used to be, but residents have no access to the buses. They say they were promised a bus terminal and a new leisure space, but neither has come. \u201cThe government, business people  \u2014   they tricked us,\u201d said Camila Felix Muguet, 36, who lost part of her home and her backyard to the project. \u201cThey came, they robbed, and they said goodbye. Now they\u2019re gone, and where are our upgrades?\u201d Ms. Pimentel, the Deodoro resident whose children were playing in a plastic pool, said she had always suspected that the public pool might not last. \u201cThe Olympics ended, Deodoro ended,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be forgotten. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563370.6260688}
