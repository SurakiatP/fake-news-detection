Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton waves as she takes the stage to speak at a fundraiser at the Paramount Theatre in Seattle, Friday, Oct. 14, 2016. \\nMonths of embarrassing leaks released by WikiLeaks and other sources related to Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign and the Democratic leadership have time and again proven to be true , while allegations of Russia being behind the effort have not been substantiated with any evidence. Still, that\u2019s the talking point the campaign continues to go with. \\nAnd indeed Clinton aide Jennifer Palmieri today warned against believing any new things released by WikiLeaks that are embarrassing to the Clinton campaign, even though the other releases were spot on, insisting that anything else they release is \u201c probably fake .\u201d Friends, please remember that if you see a whopper of a Wikileaks in next two days \u2013 it\\'s probably a fake. \\n\u2014 Jennifer Palmieri (@jmpalmieri) November 6, 2016 \\nThis isn\u2019t a brand new claim, either, with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D \u2013 CA) making claims as far back as August that any future mass leaks would probably include \u201c Russian lies \u201d designed to embarrass Clinton and the Democrats. \\nThese preemptive warnings appear to recognize the reality that more embarrassing information is likely to come out, and aiming to get out in front of the next batch by preemptively declaring them \u201cprobably\u201d not true, whatever it turns out to be.'"}, "time": 1742563795.6318672}
