Let\u2019s hope that it doesn\u2019t happen, but as you will see below, anti-Trump violence is already sweeping the nation. If Trump were to actually win the election, that would likely send the radical left into a violent post-election temper tantrum unlike anything that we have ever seen before. Alternatively, there is a tremendous amount of concern on the right that this election could be stolen by Hillary Clinton. And as I showed yesterday, it appears that voting machines in Texas are already switching votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton . If Hillary Clinton wins this election under suspicious circumstances, that also may be enough to set off widespread civil unrest all across the country. \\nAt this moment there is less than two weeks to go until November 8th, and a brand new survey has found that a majority of Americans are concerned \u201cabout the possibility of violence\u201d on election day\u2026 \\nA 51% majority of likely voters express at least some concern about the possibility of violence on Election Day; one in five are \u201cvery concerned.\u201d Three of four say they have confidence that the United States will have the peaceful transfer of power that has marked American democracy for more than 200 years, but just 40% say they are \u201cvery confident\u201d about that. \\nMore than four in 10 of Trump supporters say they won\u2019t recognize the legitimacy of Clinton as president, if she prevails, because they say she wouldn\u2019t have won fair and square. \\nBut many on the left are not waiting until after the election to commit acts of violence. On Wednesday, Donald Trump\u2019s star on the Walk of Fame was smashed into pieces by a man with a sledgehammer and a pick-ax\u2026 \\nDonald Trump took a lot of hits today, and not just in the Presidential race. With less than two weeks to go before America decides if the ex- Apprentice host will pull off a surprise victory over Hillary Clinton, Trump\u2019s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was destroyed early Wednesday morning by a man dressed as a city construction worker and wielding a sledgehammer and pick-ax in what looks to be a Tinseltown first. \\nAnd there were two other instances earlier this year when Donald Trump\u2019s star was also vandalized. One came in January, and the other happened in June \u2026 \\nThis is of course not the first time the GOP candidate\u2019s star has been attacked or defaced since Trump announced his White House bid in summer 2015. The most extreme measure was a reverse swastika being sprayed on the star at 6801 Hollywood Blvd in late January. In June this summer, a mute sign was painted on Trump\u2019s star in a seemingly protest against the antagonistic language and policies some have accused Trump of promoting and reveling in during the campaign. In both cases, Trump\u2019s star was quickly cleaned and back as new within a day. \\nWe have seen anti-Trump violence on the east coast as well. Earlier this month, someone decided to firebomb the Republican Party headquarters in Orange County, North Carolina. On the building next to the headquarters, someone spray-painted \u201cNazi Republicans get out of town or else\u201d along with a swastika. \\nThere have also been other disturbing incidents of anti-Trump violence all over the nation in recent days. A recent Lifezette article put together quite a long list, and the following is just a short excerpt from that piece\u2026 \\nOn Oct. 15 in Bangor, Maine, vandals spray-painted about 20 parked cars outside a Trump rally. Trump supporter Paul Foster, whose van was hit with white paint, told reporters, \u201cWhy can\u2019t they do a peaceful protest instead of painting cars, all of this, to make their statement?\u201d \\nAround Oct. 3, a couple of Trump supporters were assaulted in Zeitgeist, a San Francisco bar, after they were allegedly refused service for expressing support for Trump, GotNews reports. \u201cThe two Trump supporters were attacked, punched, and chased into the street by \u2018some thugs\u2019 that a barmaid called out from the back.\u201d Lilian Kim of ABC 7 Bay Area tweeted a photo of the men, in which one was wearing a Trump T-shirt and the other was wearing a \u201cBlue Lives Matter\u201d shirt. \\nOn Sept. 28 in El Cajon, California, an angry mob at a Black Lives Matter protest beat 21-year-old Trump supporter Feras Jabro for wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d baseball cap. The assault was broadcast live using the smartphone app Periscope. \\nThere is a move to get Trump supporters to wear red on election day, but in many parts of America that might just turn his supporters into easy targets. Let\u2019s certainly hope that we don\u2019t see the kind of violent confrontations at voting locations that many experts are anticipating. \\nOf course there are also many on the right that are fighting mad, and a Hillary Clinton victory under suspicious circumstances may be enough to push them over the edge. \\nFor example, this week former Congressman Joe Walsh said that he is \u201cgrabbing my musket\u201d if Donald Trump loses the election\u2026 \\nFormer Rep. Joe Walsh appeared to call for armed revolution Wednesday if Donald Trump is not elected president. \\nWalsh, a former tea party congressman from Illinois who is now a conservative talk radio host, tweeted, \u201cOn November 8th, I\u2019m voting for Trump. On November 9th, if Trump loses, I\u2019m grabbing my musket. You in?\u201d \\nAnd without a doubt, many ordinary Americans are stocking up on guns and ammunition just in case Hillary Clinton is victorious. The following comes from USA Today \u2026 \\n\u201cSince the polls are starting to shift quite a bit towards Hillary Clinton, I\u2019ve been buying a lot more ammunition,\u201d says Rick Darling, 69, an engineer from Harrison Township, in Michigan\u2019s Detroit suburbs. In a follow-up phone interview after being surveyed, the Trump supporter said he fears progressives will want to \u201cdeclare martial law and take our guns away\u201d after the election. \\nToday America is more divided than I have ever seen it before, and the mainstream media is constantly fueling the hatred and the anger that various groups feel toward one another. \\nIronically, Donald Trump has been working very hard to bring America together. In fact, he is solidly on track to win a higher percentage of the black vote than any Republican presidential candidate since 1960 . \\nIf Hillary Clinton and the Democrats win on November 8th, things will not go well for Hillary Clinton\u2019s political enemies. The Clintons used the power of the White House to go after their enemies the first time around, and Hillary is even more angry and more bitter now than she was back then. \\nAnd the radical left is very clear about who their enemies are. This is something that I discussed on national television earlier this month \u2026 \\nAs I write this, it is difficult for me to even imagine how horrible a Hillary Clinton presidency would be. \\nBut at this point that appears to be the most likely outcome . \\nOut of all the candidates that we could have chosen, the American people are about to put the most evil one by far into the White House. \\nPerhaps Donald Trump can still pull off a miracle and we can avoid that fate, but time is rapidly slipping away and November 8th will be here before we know it. \\nTake a look at the future of America: The Beginning of the End and then prepare shares'"}, "time": 1742561999.471429}
