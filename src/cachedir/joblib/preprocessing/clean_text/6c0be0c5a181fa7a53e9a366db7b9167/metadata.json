Specifically, they\u2019re calling for an investigation into how Trump co-conspirator Rudy Giuliani knew about the FBI reopening its investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server before director James Comey made his scheming announcement in a letter to Congress last week. \\nRepresentatives Elijah Cummings (D-MD) and John Conyers Jr. (D-MI), the ranking Democrats on the House Committees on Oversight and Government Reform and the Judiciary respectively, sent a scathing letter Friday to Inspector General Michael Horowitz. \u201cIt is absolutely unacceptable for the FBI to leak unsubstantiated \u2014 and in some case false \u2014 information about one presidential candidate to benefit the other candidate,\u201d they wrote. \u201cLeaking this information to former FBI officials as a conduit to the Trump campaign is equally intolerable.\u201d \\nGiuliani has repeatedly bragged about obtaining leaked information from former FBI agents. Just a few hours before the Cummings and Conyers letter was sent, the former New York mayor was asked on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d if he knew of the reopened investigation before Comey\u2019s announcement. He replied , \u201cDid I hear about it? You\u2019re darn right I heard about it, and I can\u2019t even repeat the language that I heard from the former FBI agents.\u201d \\nFor his part, Giuliani has denied having any role in leaking the information to the public, though he has in interviews he has been quick to tout his connections to the FBI and has served as somewhat of a middleman between leakers at the bureau and the Trump campaign. He has been adamant about how \u201coutraged\u201d FBI agents are at the bureau\u2019s handling of the Clinton email scandal. Then, two days before Comey sent his letter to Congress, he said that the Trump campaign \u201chas a couple of surprises left\u201d that would be \u201cenormously effective.\u201d \\nThe Representatives\u2019 letter also criticized the media\u2019s unquestioning use of unsubstantiated \u201canonymous sources\u201d from the FBI, singling out Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier in particular. On Wednesday Baier ran a story claiming that the FBI\u2019s investigation of Clinton would \u201ccontinue to likely an indictment,\u201d a lie so nefarious that he felt compelled to actually apologize for his false claims, a rather uncharacteristic occurrence at Fox News. \\nThe letter comes against the backdrop of an FBI that has increasingly been implicated as a source of a partisan leaks to the Trump campaign. Certain agents and even high ranking officials at the bureau \u2013 which in its demographics is similar to Trump\u2019s base \u2013 have apparently been funneling sensational and often false anti-Clinton information to the Trump campaign. \u201cThese unauthorized and inaccurate leaks from within the FBI, particularly so close to a presidential election, are unprecedented,\u201d the letter said. \u201cFor this reason, we are calling on your office to conduct a thorough investigation to identify the sources of these and other leaks from the FBI and to recommend appropriate action.\u201d Related Items:'"}, "time": 1742564354.7602727}
