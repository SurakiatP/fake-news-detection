The Supreme Court made its most sweeping ruling in decades on abortion rights, striking down parts of a Texas law that imposed strict limits on abortion providers. Opponents of the law, which was passed in 2013, said that it had already caused about half of the state\u2019s abortion clinics to close. The    decision has significant implications for laws in other states where similar restrictions exist they, too, are likely unconstitutional. _____ 2. The court vacated the conviction of Bob McDonnell, the former governor of Virginia, on corruption charges, a unanimous decision that could send Mr. McDonnell back for another round with prosecutors. \u201cThere is no doubt that this case is distasteful it may be worse than that,\u201d Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote, emphasizing that the justices were more focused on what they considered an overly broad interpretation of the federal bribery law at hand than \u201ctawdry tales of Ferraris, Rolexes and ball gowns. \u201d _____ 3. In Britain, the path forward remained uncertain after the vote last week to leave the European Union. Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London who supported \u201cBrexit\u201d and is a contender to succeed Prime Minister David Cameron, promised Britons  in an   essay that their country \u201cis part of Europe, and always will be. \u201d But the nation remained locked in a political crisis, and leaders of the \u201cLeave\u201d movement, including Mr. Johnson, have already disavowed some of their pledges. _____ 4. The pound, meanwhile, sank to its lowest level against the dollar since 1985, and S. P. downgraded Britain\u2019s credit rating to AA from AAA as the economic fallout from the Brexit vote continued. Global authorities tried to soothe the markets, promising to intercede in the event of an economic disaster. But investors remained skeptical, and British officials tried to assure citizens that they would still have access to the Continent\u2019s market. _____ 5. Volkswagen has agreed to pay nearly $15 billion to settle claims stemming from its diesel emissions cheating scandal, in one what would be one of the largest ever consumer   deals ever in the U. S. The cash compensation offered to each car owner will range from $5, 100 to  $10, 000. The German automaker acknowledged last year that it had installed illegal software in 11 million cars worldwide that made them capable of defeating pollution tests. 6. Hillary Clinton and Senator Elizabeth Warren campaigned together for the first time on Monday in Cincinnati. Their alliance seems unlikely to some, given their distinct approaches to Wall Street. But those differences did not come into play during the Ohio appearance: The two women showed a united face on income inequality and criticism of the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump. _____ 7. A police scandal has erupted in Oakland, Calif. with more than a dozen officers coming under investigation for their relationships with an    prostitute who is a daughter of a police dispatcher. The city has long had a reputation for police abuses, but it had seemed to be in the midst of a turnaround under its new mayor, Libby Schaff. She said in a recent interview, \u201cIt\u2019s tragic that this scandal has overshadowed the incredible progress that Oakland has made. \u201d _____ 8. Unfortunately for your briefing editor, spoilers abound in our television critic\u2019s review of the sixth season of HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d which had its finale Sunday night. We can tell you without ruining anything that he found the show to be \u201cfaster, simpler and more \u201d partly because it was the first season to move beyond the plot established by the books. \u201cIf this was not the series\u2019s best season, it was its most   entertaining,\u201d he writes. 9. Returning from a visit to Armenia on Sunday night, Pope Francis said that all Christians and the Roman Catholic Church owed the gay community an apology for past mistreatment. Francis\u2019 comments, in response to a question about the recent deadly attack at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla. were applauded by leaders of gay Catholic groups, but some said there was more work to be done. \u201cA statement of remorse is only as good as the change in behavior that follows,\u201d said the head of one leading organization. _____ 10. \u201cNow, what we\u2019ve been doing is looking at the data, and we know that police somehow manage to   disarm and not kill white people every day. \u201d That comment was part of a powerful speech by the actor Jesse Williams of \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d at the BET Awards on Sunday. The show featured a commanding performance from Beyonc\u00e9 and Kendrick Lamar, and tributes to Prince and Muhammad Ali. But Mr. Williams\u2019s speech, a demand for equal treatment and justice, was the strongest statement of the night. _____ 11. Summer is already in session for many of us, but New York City\u2019s public school students are just now preparing to go on vacation. Tuesday is officially the last day of school, and some students are planning to duck out early. Daily attendance last year at the city\u2019s high schools was 88 percent on the last day, it fell to 74 percent. \u201cI might go to school,\u201d one student told our reporter, a hint that schools may experience a similar drop this year. \u201cI might. \u201d _____ 12. Students may soon own the streets of New York, but on Sunday afternoon, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, was dominated by the walking dead. The Zombie Crawl, an annual event celebrating \u201call things undead, bloody and  \u201d celebrated its 10th year. Participants chanted about their lust for brains, drank beer and speculated about their chances of surviving a zombie apocalypse. \u201cIf it ever happened in real life, I think I could personally deal with that,\u201d one said. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.
