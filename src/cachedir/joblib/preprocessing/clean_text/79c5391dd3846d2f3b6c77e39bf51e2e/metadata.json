We asked the editor overseeing standards, Phil Corbett, whether The Times has had discussions around the term\u2019s use. He said, \u201cI\u2019m aware that there\u2019s debate over these terms, but we haven\u2019t come up with any style rules as of yet. \u201d The public editor\u2019s column also recently addressed how much an   story should disclose about its author. A piece in Sunday\u2019s Times Magazine on a Palestinian refugee camp in East Jerusalem similarly raised readers\u2019 eyebrows regarding a piece of information it did not include: the name of the organization partly financing the project. In the piece, Kushner notes, \u201cI was invited on an extensive tour of the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and was asked to choose a subject to write about, for a book to be published next year. \u201d We asked the magazine\u2019s editor, Jake Silverstein, to talk about the story\u2019s provenance: The public editor\u2019s take: I found Kushner\u2019s magazine story to be an exceptional piece of reporting and writing, one that didn\u2019t seem to be carrying anyone\u2019s political agenda. That said, the wiser choice would have been to make clear the role of Breaking the Silence in the project. Disclosure ahead of time is better than questions afterward. Another reader also finds The Times\u2019s performance coming up short  \u2014   though her complaint is not about the news coverage. When the reader tried to pay for her Times subscription, the online payment system refused to accept her last name. The reader notified The Times\u2019s customer service department, explaining, \u201cMy card is working and I think it goes without saying that my surname is too. \u201d But she got this reply: \u201cOur Credit Card system has a minimum of three characters for the first and last name. \u201d The reader then came to us. Ng also noted that the problem has yet to be fixed, so we reached out to Eileen Murphy, the head of communications at The Times, for comment. \u201cFirst, this customer should have been responded to in a timely fashion, and we apologize that didn\u2019t happen,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cClearly, this is a flaw in our system, one that we have prioritized fixing. \u201d Finally, there was the public editor appearance on Fox News\u2019s Tucker Carlson show last Friday. The downpour of mail on this subject this past week fell into two camps. One group appreciated that someone from The New York Times went on Fox to address the subject of media bias. But another group was incensed that the public editor was even on the show, much less criticizing The Times. A firestorm erupted on Twitter, and some of the flames singed the public editor\u2019s inbox, too. The public editor\u2019s take: Let me start with the biggest question: Why did I go on? Simple. I wanted to get before an audience that doesn\u2019t normally read The New York Times. A voyage outside the echo chamber. I gave my honest view of The Times\u2019s sometimes leftward political tilt, expressed in various forms. And sometimes I pushed back, pressing my belief, for example, that the vast majority of journalists who walk into the Times building everyday have the highest journalistic standards. Twitter? It\u2019s not a place for reporters to express their political opinions  \u2014   though I wish I would have made clear that Carlson\u2019s list of offenders was his, not mine. In response to the reader above, Twitter isn\u2019t a venue where journalists should banter about their ideological beliefs  \u2014   or clearly suggest them in judgmental terms. That\u2019s not just my view  \u2014   it\u2019s the official newsroom policy, regularly sent around to reporters and editors to remind them.  In the alternative universe of email fans  \u2014   those surprised and pleased that I spoke honestly to conservatives  \u2014   I\u2019m glad you listened and I\u2019m glad some expressed an interest in giving The Times another look. I\u2019m paid to be the house critic, but I will say to the reader who raised it, the work that\u2019s produced here is most definitely a public service. Till next week.'"}, "time": 1742628447.941393}
