[The April 20 attack on a police patrol on the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es illustrates this perfectly in light of the fact that the alleged attacker \u2014  Karim Cheurfi \u2014  was previously jailed for shooting at officers with a . 38 Special revolver. The Daily Mail reports that Cheurfi was imprisoned \u201cin 2005 for trying to kill two policemen\u201d and wounding a third person with the revolver.  On Thursday he allegedly used a Kalashnikov to kill two officers. He was then shot dead, and upon searching his car, police discovered more weapons, \u201cincluding a pump action shotgun. \u201d The University of Sydney\u2019s GunPolicy. org describes French gun laws as \u201crestrictive,\u201d yet they were powerless to stop Cheurfi, just as they offered no hindrance to the    who entered the Alexis de Tocqueville high school in Grasse   and opened fire. Despite universal background checks \u2014  \u201cwhich [consider] criminal, mental health and [physical] health\u201d issues \u2014  The Local reports the    was able to enter the school carrying \u201ca revolver, a pistol, a hunting rifle and two grenades. \u201d Consider the November 13, 2015, terror attack on unarmed Parisians. In that attack, multiple terrorists opened fire with   or   rifles. They killed 130 innocents. The universal background checks were not a hindrance, and the rest of the French gun laws were powerless to prevent the attack. It is important to note that A Review of French Gun Laws (2012) shows that the background check in France is an ongoing process rather than a one time event. Such checks entail acquiring and maintaining \u201can active shooting club [membership]\u201d and going to the range \u201cat least three times a year. \u201d They also include \u201cseeing a doctor every year,\u201d who declares one \u201cphysically and mentally capable of owning a firearm,\u201d and filling out various pieces of paperwork as well. Yet 130 innocents were gunned down on November 13, 2015. And we cannot overlook the January 7, 2015, attack on Charlie Hebdo headquarters. Twelve innocents \u2014  including two police officers \u2014  were gunned down by armed terrorists who were not hindered by strict gun control. French police unions responded to the Charlie Hebdo attack by explaining that gun control simply was not working for them they could not continue to walk the streets of Paris presuming that terrorists would not acquire arms. The Associated Press reported that the police unions demanded \u201cmore\u201d guns and \u201cheavier\u201d guns, as well as \u201cprotective gear, better training for   and more legal tools to guard against terrorists. \u201d Gun control reduces   citizens\u2019 ability to defend themselves and places police officers at a marked disadvantage. On the other hand, it poses no hindrance to determined terrorists who target citizens and police officers alike.
