Weeding through the propaganda is a major chore, so much so we should all be watching who funds it.\\nLoopholes in the law have been around forever. I agree with you, keeping vigilant is the only way to protect freedom, intellectual and otherwise. I've gone a bit further listening to Alex Jones for instance and I too like RT. It's remaining objective that counts. With Jones it was the only place I could get news about what Julian Assange was dumping. I didn't find much on MSM. That led me to hearings in which Trey Gowdy was hammering away. That really brought the loopholes flying and showed what connections can do.\\nAs such we can conclude we are being led by corrupt fools of every stripe it seems. It's exactly why I'm an advocate for federally funded elections (zero private or corporate money) and slamming the Wall Street MIC revolving door on both sides. If we can do it, there's an the added benefit of opening the door to other parties. That would be great news.\\nThanks for your post as well.\""}, "time": 1742628587.295899}
