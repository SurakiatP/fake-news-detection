But now that the European Union has done something about it by trying to wrest billions of dollars from Apple, those officials have offered a response viewed by many as rife with hypocrisy: collective outrage. Tax avoidance has become a lightning rod as the presidential campaign has taken on a strong populist cast, and leading Republicans and Democrats in Congress have demanded that companies be forced to pay their fair share. Both Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump have vowed to crack down on deals that allow companies to relocate their headquarters overseas to lower their tax bills, and the Treasury Department has made limiting international loopholes a priority. Despite all that, Apple  \u2014   a company long accused of being overly creative at avoiding taxes  \u2014   now has the federal government standing up for it after the European Union\u2019s executive commission ordered Ireland on Tuesday to collect $14. 5 billion in taxes from the company. And for at least some American politicians, the anger stems from a simple calculation: The tax money that the European Union extracts from Apple should be going to the United States Treasury, not that they have figured out how to make that happen. \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable to think that the administration has been flying over to Brussels on taxpayers\u2019 dollars to lobby the European Union against collecting taxes owed in Europe when they\u2019re not collecting the taxes owed here,\u201d said Clark Gascoigne, deputy director of the Financial Accountability and Corporate Transparency Coalition. \u201cIt\u2019s terribly ironic. \u201d Most lawmakers and business groups do not see it that way. They defended Apple by arguing that the European Union was overstepping its authority and reinterpreting international tax law to unfairly penalize the company. Some called it a new brand of protectionism. The Treasury Department said the ruling was \u201cdeeply troubling. \u201d The Business Roundtable, a lobbying organization for America\u2019s largest companies, called the move a \u201creckless and dramatic overreach\u201d and an \u201cact of aggression\u201d against a company and a sovereign government. In Congress, lawmakers in both parties have urged the Treasury Department to be tougher on European officials as they aggressively investigate what they call undue tax benefits given by member nations to leading American companies. Members of the Senate Finance Committee sent a letter in May to Jacob J. Lew, the Treasury secretary, urging him to consider retaliation that would include doubling taxes on companies and individuals in Europe. The European Commission \u201cis using a theory to make tax law, is doing it in a way that is retroactive and that overrides national tax law authority, in our view,\u201d Mr. Lew said Wednesday at a Brookings Institution event previewing this weekend\u2019s meeting in China of the Group of 20 largest industrial economies. He pushed back against the idea that Treasury is condoning tax evasion, saying legislation that prevents companies from parking income overseas to avoid being taxed in the United States \u201cwill see action probably not in my tenure but early in the next administration. \u201d The European Commission\u2019s ruling has even managed to forge a rare moment of agreement between the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, and Senator Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat who is likely to become the next leader of his party in the Senate. \u201cThis decision is awful,\u201d Mr. Ryan said in a statement. \u201cSlamming a company with a giant tax bill  \u2014   years after the fact  \u2014   sends exactly the wrong message to job creators on both sides of the Atlantic. \u201d Mr. Schumer said in an interview that he and Mr. Ryan had been discussing possibilities for a corporate tax overhaul for next year. He said he was optimistic about the prospect of requiring corporate money to return to the United States at a lower tax rate, with some of the proceeds being used to fund a large investment in infrastructure. The action taken by the European Union, he said, should be an impetus to get moving on such legislation. \u201cThe European Union is going to grab this money, instead of the U. S.,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big signpost here for us. Let\u2019s get moving. \u201d He added: \u201cWe\u2019re trying to protect our U. S. tax base. That money sitting over there should be here in the U. S. not in Ireland and not in the E. U. \u201d The bipartisan \u201cconsensus\u201d that the corporate tax rate should be cut in exchange for loopholes closures emerged in President Obama\u2019s first term, yet Congress has not formally drafted a bill, much less voted on one. Tax experts said that without a deep cut in the tax rate, companies like Apple would be better off paying back taxes in Europe than repatriating their overseas cash. \u201cThis is not taking 13 billion euros out of the U. S. Treasury\u2019s pocket and U. S. taxpayers\u2019 pocket and putting it into Europe,\u201d said Jeffery M. Kadet, a tax lecturer at the University of Washington School of Law. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t be bringing this money back to the U. S. anyway. \u201d Reuven S.   who directs the international taxation program at the University of Michigan Law School, said that the European Union had a strong case for collecting the taxes from Apple and that if the situation were reversed, Americans would be clamoring to collect taxes from a foreign company. \u201cJust because it happens to be an American company, to say that the European Union should not take action, I think, is the height of hypocrisy,\u201d Mr.   said. While most lawmakers condemned the treatment of Apple, one prominent former senator said he was pleased to see Europe take action. Carl M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who was chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations when it examined Apple\u2019s use of tax havens in 2013, said the European Commission should fill the vacuum left by lackadaisical tax enforcement in the United States. \u201cThe royalties Apple collects for its overseas sales of products designed and developed in the U. S. should be taxed in the U. S.,\u201d Mr. Levin said. \u201cBut Apple has avoided the billions of dollars of taxes it owes the U. S. by transferring its intellectual property to itself in Ireland. \u201d Blaming Apple and the Internal Revenue Service, he added, \u201cWhen Apple used those tax avoidance schemes, it is understandable that Europe would try to go after them. \u201d It remains to be seen if corporate tax reform will be a priority for the next administration, but the language used by both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump on the campaign trail suggests that it is a strong possibility. Mrs. Clinton has released a formal proposal to prevent   corporate inversions and to reward companies that keep their operations in the United States. Mr. Trump, who has called for a boycott of Apple products, has threatened to punish companies that relocate to other countries by imposing taxes on products they sell in the United States. The news that a corporate giant might have evaded billions of dollars in taxes could become another populist rallying cry. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders did so well in the campaign this year,\u201d Mr. Gascoigne, of the Financial Accountability and Corporate Transparency Coalition, said. \u201cPeople are fed up with the kinds of   deals that are happening at the large multinational companies at the expense of the American people. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562254.639944}
