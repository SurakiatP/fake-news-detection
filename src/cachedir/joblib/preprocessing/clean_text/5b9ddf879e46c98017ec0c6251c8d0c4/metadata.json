I held up the sign and initially people around me were just booing me telling me to get out of there. Then a couple of these guys tried grabbing the sign out of my hands.\u201d \\nCrites had no weapon. Secret Service agents later released a statement to that effect and let him go without charges. \\nAgents whisked Trump offstage because Crites was near the front of the auditorium at the Reno-Sparks Convention Center. \\nCrites said he holds no ill will toward the Secret Service or Reno police, who were just doing their job. \\n\u201cI was trying to get the Secret Service\u2019s attention for them to respond,\u201d said Michael Newton, 45, of Santa Rosa, Calif., who helped restrain Crites. \u201cThey didn\u2019t respond. I thought I had to do something. I put my knee on what I think was his head, so I\u2019m not really sure. There were five guys on him and he was moving. I tried to help them immobilize him.\u201d In final Colorado push, Trump urges supporters to hand-deliver ballots \\nNewton said he felt as if Crites were the aggressor. \\n\u201cI saw his hand contact someone\u2019s face,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe two people.\u201d \\nCrites said he didn\u2019t strike anyone, but after he was taken to the ground, he felt as if he were being mobbed. \\n\u201cMultiple people just tackled me down, kicking me choking me and just beating me up,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s when things even got crazier. I was on the ground and people were holding my arms, legs and I kept saying I can barely breathe. I was turning my neck just to get a little bit of air to keep from passing out.\u201d \\nThat\u2019s when police intervened, taking Crites away in handcuffs. \\nNewton\u2019s partner, Donald Newton, 47, of Santa Rosa took video of the immediate aftermath. \\nThe Secret Service said its investigation is ongoing. The agency uses magnetometers at presidential campaign sites, making it difficult for weapons to be smuggled into events. \\nWhat\u2019s baffling to Crites is how anyone could have thought he had a gun. His sign was in the air for some time and he wasn\u2019t making any sudden movements, he said. \\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like they noticed something suspicious and tackled me,\u201d Crites said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the case.\u201d \\nHe said he backs some GOP candidates and just wanted to voice frustration with Trump, not cause panic. \\n\u201cI love all the people in that rally,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re all fellow Americans. They\u2019re doing their patriotic duty. They support their candidate. I\u2019m just there showing that I\u2019m a Republican. I\u2019m all of your people\u2019s brother. I just have a slight difference of opinion.\u201d \\nLater on Facebook, Crites wrote that he has no connection with the campaign of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton but has canvassed for her for about three hours, contributed to her campaign and voted for her. \\n\u201cTake what happened to me tonight as a classic example of dictator incitement of violence \u2014 against your own Republican brother with a stupid sign,\u201d he wrote. The post and his entire account were taken down soon afterward as some Trump supporters on social media called him a \u201cClinton thug,\u201d\u201cHillary shill\u201d and \u201cTrump assassin.\u201d \\nShortly after the incident at the rally, Trump returned to the stage to raucous applause, thanking the Secret Service and launching back into his prepared remarks. His campaign later issued a statement also thanking the Secret Service and his supporters. \\nFollow Seth A. Richardson on Twitter: @SethARichardson'"}, "time": 1742562143.798291}
