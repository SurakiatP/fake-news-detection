Her history dictates that she is not a champion for women and minorities. She is definitely no role model I want my daughter to emulate. She lost because of her lies, her perchance at being non-transparent, her involvement with rigging the primaries against Senator Bernie Sanders (who would have won the general election), her poor judgment, and her Foundation\u2019s influence when she was SOS. She lost because of her subhuman character and lack of morals and ethics. Her election night abusively violent tantrum speaks for volumes about her nature. Clinton is her own worse enemy.\\nIf she is not guilt of any wrongdoing, why is there a desperate need to pardon her? All of us, including Clinton, are suppose to abide by the laws that govern this Nation. An innocence person would embrace his/hers right to face a jury of their peers proving beyond a reasonable doubt of their innocence. All a pardon will do is divide this Nation even more \u2013 nationwide civil unrest on both sides will erupt. It will be national chaos making us vulnerable to our real enemies. So no pardon and let the justice system takes it course. Innocent or guilty,let\u2019s be done with this.'"}, "time": 1742564222.4322731}
