In footage taken a few years after his 1960 Olympic gold medal performance, he was explaining his decision to sit out the Vietnam War to a group of white male college students. \u201cYou won\u2019t even stand up for me in America for my religious beliefs,\u201d said Ali, who had converted from Christianity to Islam, \u201cand you want me to go somewhere and fight, but you won\u2019t even stand up for me at home. \u201d From her seat in the darkened room at the Muhammad Ali Center on Saturday, Emma McElvaney Talbott heard Ali\u2019s words and couldn\u2019t hold back. \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d she exclaimed, not caring how far her voice carried. The hometown that McElvaney Talbott and Ali shared was staging a citywide   this weekend for its native son, who died late Friday after a   struggle with Parkinson\u2019s disease. Outside the center, the flags had been lowered to  . Inside, McElvaney Talbott\u2019s memories, triggered by the   film of Ali\u2019s life, were going full tilt. All around her were people who had come to pay their respects, some bearing bouquets of flowers or boxing gloves, handmade signs or letters. Or, in some cases, just silent blessings. Kerry Borvan, who had been traveling with her nephews from Chicago to the Dollywood theme park in Pigeon Forge, Tenn. made an unplanned stop at the museum and cultural center after waking up to the news of Ali\u2019s death. Dr. Saleem Seyal, a cardiologist who was born in Pakistan and is a longtime resident of the Louisville area, had once met Ali, and he produced photographs from his smartphone to prove it. He had come to say a Muslim prayer for the former heavyweight champion of the world. There were also those who were there from the start, who knew Ali as a kid in Louisville who raced school buses on foot and walked teenage girls home from school for the prospect of a kiss, who could testify to the sentiment that Mayor Greg Fischer of Louisville had expressed at a Saturday morning memorial service when he said, \u201cMuhammad Ali belongs to the world, but he only has one hometown. \u201d That rang true for McElvaney Talbott, a retired educator and a writer, and her husband, Cecil Talbott, an engineer, who are   members of the center, which was   by Ali and his wife, Lonnie. On Saturday, the waiving of admission fees was hardly what motivated them to join the steady procession of visitors. On a day when the weather  \u2014   gray and glum with scattered sunshine between downpours  \u2014   reflected the city\u2019s collective emotions, they said they had come because each room in the center was like a page from a scrapbook. Like Ali, Cecil Talbott learned to box at a local gym run by Fred Stone, who is credited with helping to teach Ali the footwork that enabled him to flit around the ring like a dancer. With prodding from his wife, Talbott recounted a   sparring session he had with the much bigger Ali, then known as Cassius Clay, when both were teenagers. Talbott said he was scrawny and stood just 5 feet 7 inches when he climbed into the ring with Ali, who was well on his way to his adult height,  . Ali seemed not to care that the objective of sparring was to practice technique, not inflict torment, \u201cIn the first round, Cassius threw a hard right, and Fred warned him not to hit hard,\u201d Cecil Talbott said. \u201cIn the second round, Cassius threw another hard right, and Freddie had to warn him again not to do it. \u201cIn my mind, I said, \u2018This is not going to work,\u2019 so in the third round, he threw another hard right, and I saw it coming. I blocked it and I threw a hard right back. Cassius looked at me and said, \u2018Good shot.\u2019 \u201d Talbott gave up boxing soon thereafter, but Ali was hooked. McElvaney Talbott, who was in the same class at Central High as Ali\u2019s younger brother, recalled Ali shadowboxing in the halls as he made his way from one class to the next. He was smart, she said, but didn\u2019t apply himself in school. \u201cHe was a cutup,\u201d she said. \u201cI just remember he was a lot of fun. \u201d Some mornings, he entertained his schoolmates by racing a dozen blocks or more as he tried to outrun the bus that McElvaney Talbott rode to school. \u201cWe\u2019d be screaming and hollering and laughing,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019d be yelling: \u2018Go Cassius!\u2019 \u201d McElvaney Talbott recalled with a laugh: \u201cHe\u2019d always stop for the young ladies. I called him a big ol\u2019 teddy bear. \u201d One day, she said, he walked her home from a skating rink, shadowboxing on the sidewalk and jabbering away. \u201cWhen we got to my door, he asked me for a kiss,\u201d she said. \u201cI regretfully said no, and he didn\u2019t push it. \u201d In 1960, the year Ali graduated from high school, he won the   gold at the Summer Olympics in Rome. Upon his return home, he received a hero\u2019s welcome, but the local adulation, like the gold in his medal, did not run deep. Instead, discrimination did. One had to be a fighter to rise above the daily humiliations of life in a segregated city, McElvaney Talbott said. Some leaned on books and learning and religion. Ali used his fists and his wit. As a child of the segregated South, she said she understood the forces that had carried Ali into the embrace of the Nation of Islam, an American Muslim sect that advocated racial separation. (He would later convert to orthodox Islam.) She said she was proud when he refused to be drafted to fight in the Vietnam War and requested   status, which caused him to be stripped of his heavyweight title by boxing commissions around the country and put his career on hiatus for more than three years during his athletic prime. \u201cWe lived with him through all the injustices,\u201d McElvaney Talbott said. \u201cI remember feeling that he was right to refuse to go and feeling really sad when they stripped him of his title. \u201d She added, \u201cHe was the man for that time. \u201d As his fame grew, his trips home diminished. But during his visits, \u201che was always the hometown boy,\u201d McElvaney Talbott said. \u201cIf you saw him, he was approachable. \u201d During one of those visits, she said, Ali ran into her older brother, Woody. \u201cGive me your address,\u201d she said Ali told her brother. An hour later, Ali showed up on his doorstep. \u201cI ran into him at the center four years ago,\u201d she said, \u201cand I told him I was Woody\u2019s sister. He was struggling with his speech, but his face lit up. \u201d Ali\u2019s younger brother, who was born Rudolph but later converted to Islam and took the name Rahman Ali, spent part of Saturday receiving visitors at a house on Grand Street. It was next door to the carnation pink clapboard structure where he and his brother were raised by their mother, Odessa, a cook and house cleaner, and their father, Cassius Marcellus Clay Sr. a sign painter and church muralist. The     home was restored and converted into a museum that opened last month. Visitors were greeted at the front door by Sonny Fishback, who was dressed in purple pants and a matching bowler\u2019s shirt as if ready for the nightclub stages he once commanded. Fishback attended Central High with Ali and his brother and later became a singer and songwriter. Stories flowed freely from him as he controlled the tide of people streaming inside to buy an $8 admission ticket and pay their respects to Rahman Ali, who is as quiet as his brother was loquacious. In the bedroom the brothers shared, there are two paintings of Muhammad Ali by Rahman, who is an artist. Speaking softly, Rahman said that his brother\u2019s physical suffering was over and that he had led a rich life. When it was suggested to him that Ali\u2019s greatest currency was the love he gave away freely and, in his later years, was returned a thousandfold, Rah beckoned the visitor closer and kissed her on the cheek. Five miles from the house, at the Green Meadows Memorial Cemetery, which sits on the other side of the railroad tracks, a woman knelt in front of the granite gravestone shared by Ali\u2019s parents, planting marigolds to spell out \u201cLove. \u201d She identified herself as Diana Rupa but said she went by the surname Ali because the boxer embodied kindness and respect and dignity. As she was working the dirt around the flowers, she said she had never met Ali but felt a personal and spiritual connection to him. Earlier in the day, Rupa had added an elephant pi\u00f1ata to the makeshift shrine for Ali on the porch of his childhood home. She set another   elephant at his parents\u2019 grave site. With their thick skins, their graceful way of moving on their toes and their ability to communicate to their herd without seeming to speak, elephants remind her of Ali. The boxer known for running his mouth became a humanitarian who did not have to say a word. Referring to his Parkinson\u2019s disease, which so diminished Ali\u2019s voice, Rupa said, \u201cGod had to shut him up,\u201d she said, \u201cso that we could hear his heart. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564374.7937155}
