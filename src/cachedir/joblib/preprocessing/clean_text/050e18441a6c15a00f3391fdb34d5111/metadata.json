Betty Grissom never did have that party. But on Friday, as for the past 25 years, there was a solemn observance at the   memorial for her husband and two crewmates who were killed in the Apollo 1 disaster. Mr. Grissom, Roger Chaffee and Ed White died in a flash fire that engulfed their capsule atop a Saturn 1B rocket during a routine training operation on Jan. 27, 1967. Mr. Grissom was 40. Ms. Grissom, 89, was at the memorial again on Friday, wearing a denim jacket with a large Apollo 1 patch in patriotic colors. She joined old friends, family members, and NASA officials and veterans, among them Charlie Duke, who took part in the Apollo 16 moon landing. With the recent deaths of the astronauts John Glenn and Eugene A. Cernan and the sea changes in Washington, the gathering felt like a memorial for an era as well as for three men. At the ceremony, candles were lit for the dead astronauts by members of their families, including Cody Grissom, 22, a pilot, who is completing his last year at his grandfather\u2019s alma mater, Purdue University. Representatives from the Navy, the Air Force and NASA spoke, and a Navy bugler performed taps after the sun went down. \u201cIt is important that Challenger and Columbia are remembered, and that Apollo 1 is remembered,\u201d said the Kennedy Space Center director, Robert D. Cabana. \u201cAnd that we take those steps that create an environment where everyone has a voice, that we really work to ensure the success and the safety of the crew as we continue to explore and move beyond our planet. \u201d Ms. Grissom said this year\u2019s ceremony was probably her last. It coincided with a NASA tribute exhibit about Apollo 1 at the Kennedy Space Center, which she, like many, thought was long overdue. \u201cI thought this is probably a good time to call it quits with them finally getting a memorial of some kind,\u201d she said. This year\u2019s event drew around 150 people, one of the largest crowds ever for a memorial that few people knew of unless they were related to an astronaut or were a   space fan. \u201cWe need heroes today, and these were heroes,\u201d said one such fan, Robert Pearlman, an American space historian. People from all over the world traveled to the memorial, among them Masato Maruyama, 65, who has come for the past 10 years from Tokyo. He brought a big bottle of sake to share with the family and friends. Mr. Maruyama said Mr. Grissom reminded him of his father, who was in the Japanese Navy. He remembers just where he was when the fire occurred. \u201cIt\u2019s not the distance  \u2014   it\u2019s in here,\u201d he said, pointing to his heart. \u201cI\u2019m just one of hundreds of thousands. Apollo counted a lot not just for Americans, but human beings. \u201d Although the launch platform is crumbling like a concrete Greek ruin, and stenciled with an eerie \u201cAbandon in Place,\u201d the site was decorated with three     floral wreaths brought by the Grissom family. A bagpiper stood ready and Ms. Grissom sat front and center. She was treated as the event\u2019s grande dame as people lined up to speak with her. \u201cI want you to know it is such an honor,\u201d said Shirley Brown, whose shop provided the wreaths. \u201cThe first time you walked in my shop and said, \u2018I\u2019m Betty Grissom,\u2019 I thought Queen Elizabeth had walked in. You never went down, you fought all the way. \u201d \u201cI never quit,\u201d Ms. Grissom agreed, in the kind of taciturn response her astronaut husband might have offered. Many years after the accident, two space buffs, Bob Castro and Mark Pinchell, started going out to the site of the fire, which is on Air Force property, in their own private tribute. One year, they bumped into each other, and came up with the idea of doing something bigger. \u201cJust two space geeks who were going to Pad 34 and doing their own separate ceremonies,\u201d said Mark Grissom, 63, who was 13 when his father died. \u201cThey met at the pad and decided to invite the families. \u201d The Grissoms were the first astronaut family to become involved. Early on, car headlights provided the only illumination. While other astronauts and families have been absent over the years, this year Roger Chaffee\u2019s wife, Martha, and her daughter, Sheryl, attended, along with Ed White\u2019s daughter Bonnie. \u201cThis is the families\u2019 memorial,\u201d said Sonny Witt, the 45th Space Wing director of operations for Division 1 at Patrick Air Force Base, who helps provide the access. \u201cNot the Air Force and not NASA. They are the ones that lost the husbands and brothers and fathers. Mistakes were made, and they paid the price. \u201d When the three Apollo 1 astronauts were trapped in their burning capsule on Pad 34, a cry for help, believed to be from Mr. Chaffee, a rookie astronaut, came over the communications system: \u201cHey, we\u2019re burning up. \u201d Mr. White tried opening the hatch, but caught within the highly combustible pure oxygen atmosphere, the crew suffocated. \u201cI don\u2019t want any of this forgotten,\u201d Ms. Grissom said. \u201cGus Grissom was a human being. \u201d Mr. Grissom, often seen as an underdog, was a favorite astronaut of many Americans. He infamously \u201cscrewed the pooch\u201d  \u2014   as Tom Wolfe put it in \u201cThe Right Stuff\u201d  \u2014   when the hatch blew on his Mercury capsule, causing it to sink it in the Atlantic upon splashdown. Mr. Grissom was initially blamed, and the sunken capsule cost the astronaut couple a visit to the Kennedy White House. In the end, he was cleared of responsibility. Ms. Grissom, who lives in Houston by herself, and Mr. Grissom were high school sweethearts in Mitchell, Ind. Her life always revolved around him. She worked as a   telephone operator for Indiana Bell, putting her husband through college at Purdue, where he studied mechanical engineering on the G. I. Bill. He was selected as an astronaut after flying an   Sabre on over a hundred combat missions in Korea. Death was always on the horizon for the wives. The program lost seven astronauts on the path to the moon, largely as a result of crashes of the   the supersonic jet trainer airplanes the astronauts flew back and forth from where they lived in Houston and Cape Canaveral. When the news of the Apollo 1 accident came to her, delivered by a NASA doctor when she was at a friend\u2019s home for a weekly poker night, Ms. Grissom told her friend that she had \u201calready died 100, 000 deaths\u201d living with her husband. Martha Chaffee, the youngest space widow, slept with the flag that hung over her husband\u2019s coffin at Arlington. Pat White killed herself years later, a weekend before she and some of the other wives had a reunion planned, her friends said. The space widows felt rejected after their husbands died, while still living in the closely knit community of astronaut families in the \u201cspace burbs\u201d by the Manned Spacecraft Center (later the Johnson Space Center) in Houston, nicknamed \u201cTogethersville\u201d because of its exclusivity. In the late \u201960s, Ms. Grissom became a black sheep among the astronaut community. She was the first of the widows to sue NASA\u2019s largest contractor, North American Rockwell, over the construction of the capsule, and she inspired Ms. Chaffee and Ms. White to do the same. Ms. Grissom eventually settled for $350, 000. On Friday, as Ms. Grissom was helped off the old launching pad, professional and amateur stargazers pointed out the International Space Station passing in the sky above, along with Venus and a shooting star. Back in the car and about to be driven to a celebratory dinner for friends and family at a hotel in nearby Cocoa Beach, she turned to her son and said, \u201cThe stars are out tonight. \u201d Earlier, she spoke of how her husband\u2019s sacrifice helped pave the way for the missions to come like the Apollo 11 moonwalk her husband never got to see. Still, she said, \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure he got to the moon before they did. \u201d She added: \u201cOf course he didn\u2019t make it, but in spirit I think he was already there. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562368.7028534}
