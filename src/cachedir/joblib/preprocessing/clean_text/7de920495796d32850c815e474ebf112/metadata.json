Michael Rectenwald \\nRectenwald launched an undercover Twitter account called Deplorable NYU Prof on Sept. 12 to argue against campus trends like \u201csafe spaces,\u201d \u201ctrigger warnings\u201d and other aspects of academia\u2019s growing PC culture . \\nHe chose to be anonymous, he explained in one of his first tweets, because he was afraid \u201cthe PC Gestapo would ruin me\u201d if he put his name \\xadbehind his conservative ideas on the famously liberal campus. \\n\u201cI remember once on my Facebook I posted a story about a kid who changed his pronoun to \u2018His Majesty\u2019 because I thought it was funny,\u201d he told The Post. \u201cThen I got viciously attacked by 400 people. This whole milieu is nauseating. I grew tired of it, so I made the account.\u201d \\nOn Oct. 11, Rectenwald used his \\xadInternet alter ego to criticize \u201csafe spaces\u201d \u2014 the recent campus trend of \u201cprotecting\u201d students from uncomfortable speech \u2014 as \u201cat once a hall of mirrors and a rubber room.\u201d \\nTwo weeks ago he posted on his \u201canti-PC\u201d feed a photo of a flyer put out by NYU resident advisers telling students how to avoid wearing potentially offensive Halloween costumes. \u201cThe scariest thing about Halloween today is .\\u2009.\\u2009. the liberal totalitarian costume surveillance,\u201d he wrote. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s an alarming curtailment of free expression to the point where you can\u2019t even pretend to be something without authorities coming down on you in the universities,\u201d Rectenwald told The Post. \\nBut the Twitter feed soon sparked a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d by the growing army of \u201csocial justice warriors,\u201d he said. And so, when he was approached on Twitter by a reporter with the Washington Square News, NYU\u2019s student newspaper, the untenured assistant professor agreed to an interview. \\n\u201cI thought there was nothing objectionable about what I had said,\u201d he told The Post. \u201cMy contention is that the trigger warning, safe spaces and bias hot-line reporting is not politically correct. It is insane ,\u201d he told the student paper in an interview published Monday. \\nBut Rectenwald says he began getting \u201cdirty looks\u201d in his department and on Wednesday figured out why: A 12-person committee calling itself the Liberal Studies Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Working Group, including two deans, published a letter to the editor in the same paper. \\n\u201cAs long as he airs his views with so little appeal to evidence and civility, we must find him guilty of illogic and incivility in a community that predicates its work in great part on rational thought and the civil exchange of ideas,\u201d they wrote. \\n\u201cWe seek to create a dynamic community that values full participation. Such efforts are not the \u2018destruction of academic integrity\u2019 Professor Rectenwald suggests, but rather what make possible our program\u2019s approach to global studies,\u201d they argued. \\nRectenwald likened the attack to \u201ca Salem witch trial. They took my views personally. I never even mentioned them and I never even said NYU liberal studies program. I was talking about academia at large.\u201d \\nThe same day that letter was published, Rectenwald was summoned to a meeting with his department dean and an HR representative, he says. \u201cThey claimed they were worried about me and a couple people had expressed concern about my mental health,\u201d Rectenwald told The Post. NYU spokesman Matt Nagel \\nThe leave has \u201cabsolutely zero to do with his Twitter account or his opinions on issues of the day,\u201d said NYU spokesman Matt Nagel , refusing to elaborate on the reason. \\nBut Rectenwald is disheartened. \u201cI\u2019m afraid my academic career is over,\u201d he said . \u201cAcademic freedom: It\u2019s great, as long as you don\u2019t use it.\u201d \\nDCG'"}, "time": 1742628422.4832053}
