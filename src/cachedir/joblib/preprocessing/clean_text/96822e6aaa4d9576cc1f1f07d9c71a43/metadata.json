She recalls the doting mom who took her to zoos, aquariums and SeaWorld, and marvels at how fortunate she was to have a parent who loved her unconditionally. But those memories are now complicated by an extraordinary drama that has played out over the week since Ms. Manigo, 18, found out that she had been spirited away as a newborn from a hospital in Jacksonville, Fla. that her real name is Kamiyah Mobley, and that the woman she still thinks of as her mother has been charged with her abduction. She is still trying to make sense of it all. She met with her birth parents, Craig Aiken and Shanara Mobley, last weekend. But in her first newspaper interview since the case made headlines on Friday, she said she did not have a cross word for Gloria Williams, the woman who now stands accused of lurking for more than a dozen hours around a Jacksonville hospital on the July 1998 day Ms. Manigo was born, looking for a newborn to snatch. \u201cI feel like I was blessed,\u201d Ms. Manigo said in a telephone interview. \u201cI never had a reason to question a blessing like that, someone loving you so much. \u201d Ms. Manigo said she never had cause to doubt her mother in the rural South Carolina community where she grew up. But the police say someone else clearly did. At least two tips were called in late last year to the Jacksonville Sheriff\u2019s Office, some 200 miles away, where the police still had an open   case. \u201cA woman posing as a health care worker approached a young mother, then 16, with a newborn, and walked out of what was then University Medical Center with a baby and disappeared,\u201d Sheriff Mike Williams recounted at a news conference on Friday. The woman wore flowered hospital scrubs and carried a purse, which seemed odd. \u201cWhat\u2019s she doing with a pocketbook?\u201d the baby\u2019s grandmother, Velma Aiken, recalled thinking in a report on the 10th anniversary of the case. \u201cThat lady could be stealing your baby. \u201d She thought, \u201cI\u2019m picking up a bad spirit. \u201d The woman spent hours with the family and then left with the baby, saying the girl had a fever and needed some tests. They never came back. \u201cIn the 18 years since that child\u2019s abduction, we have received and followed up on more than 2, 500 investigative leads,\u201d Sheriff Williams said, recalling an \u201cintense, lengthy, detailed, multiagency investigation. \u201d The family reached a legal settlement with the hospital two years later. And every year, the baby\u2019s mother would wrap a slice of birthday cake in tinfoil and freeze it. The case also went cold. Late last year, two fresh tips came in, and they led   detectives to Walterboro, S. C. a town of just 5, 000 people an hour west of Charleston. There, the investigators found a young woman who had been born on July 10, 1998, just like Kamiyah, but with a different name. Her documents were fraudulent, Sheriff Williams said, and \u201cinterviews with people\u201d supported the idea that the two women were one and the same. The detectives asked Ms. Manigo for a DNA sample. \u201cAnd of course, like someone who understands their rights, she said: \u2018What is this about? Do you have a warrant? \u2019\u201d said her lawyer, Justin Bamberg. The investigators returned with one. Ms. Manigo gave her DNA and in short order found out the truth: She was someone else\u2019s child. Conscious of the fact that the woman she knew as her mother will now face trial for kidnapping, Ms. Manigo is unwilling to discuss a lot about the case, including how her family life finally unraveled. She does not want to say which name she plans to use in the future, and she insisted that she was never suspicious  \u2014   although the police said otherwise at a news conference on Friday. \u201cI never had any ID or a driver\u2019s license, but other than that, everything was totally normal,\u201d she said. She did acknowledge being stymied a few months ago when she applied for work at Shoney\u2019s but lacked the Social Security card she needed to get the job. \u201cShe took care of everything I ever needed,\u201d Ms. Manigo said. \u201cI never wanted for anything. I always trusted her with it. \u201d She said that Ms. Williams was not mentally ill and that she had not been overprotective. Ms. Williams worked at a Navy yard handling medical records and was set to receive her master\u2019s degree this year. \u201cShe was a very smart woman,\u201d Ms. Manigo said. Ms. Manigo met her biological parents on Saturday, at a teary reunion followed by a   trip to the mall. She called them Mom and Dad, because she figured those were words they had been waiting a long time to hear. \u201cYou can tell she has a lot of love for me as well,\u201d Ms. Manigo said about her biological mother, who could not be reached for comment. \u201cThey don\u2019t feel like  . They feel like distant family. \u201d She said she felt an innate trust toward them. Her father, Craig Aiken, told   in Jacksonville the meeting was \u201cbeautiful. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a feeling that you can\u2019t explain,\u201d he said. Mr. Bamberg, Ms. Manigo\u2019s lawyer, said there were now practical matters to attend to. She needs identification and a Social Security card. A large financial settlement was won on her behalf, and now that she is 18, it has to be determined whether any money was set aside for her. \u201cYou have incidents where people\u2019s lives were turned upside down, and then you have this: a life that was essentially erased,\u201d he said. Among the few people who can really relate to what Ms. Mobley is experiencing is Sarah Cecilie Finkelstein Waters. When she was a preschooler living with her mother, her father took her, and it was not until she was a teenager and saw her picture on a milk carton that she realized that she had been abducted. Ms. Waters eventually reconnected with her mother, distanced herself from her father and, as an adult, befriended other survivors of abduction. \u201cIt turns reality upside down and forces you to question every core thing you ever believed to be true,\u201d said Ms. Waters, now 46, married and a mother herself, living on Long Island. \u201cYou have to really struggle to come to terms with all these shades of gray, make sense of them, and hopefully some sort of peace with them: What is reality? Who is wrong and who\u2019s right? Who really loves me? Who is telling the truth?\u201d Since Ms. Mobley seems devoted to the woman she believed was her mother, Ms. Waters said, \u201cShe needs to feel like she can embrace her new family without giving up on her old one. \u201d Geoffrey Greif, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Social Work who has studied abduction cases, said some psychological effects were common. \u201cAs you connect the dots over a period of time, it\u2019s a pretty normal reaction to become upset with the abductor, and a child who was abducted may have trouble developing intimacy and trust with other people,\u201d he said. \u201cWe often see a degree of anger at the parents who were left behind, even if that\u2019s not really justified, like \u2018Why didn\u2019t you look harder for me? \u2019\u201d But cases like Ms. Mobley\u2019s are quite rare. Thousands of children are abducted each year, but usually the abductor is a family member, most often a parent. And abduction by a stranger often has a tragic end  \u2014   sexual abuse, death or both. A spokesman for the hospital, which is now called UF Health Jacksonville, said the medical center was thrilled that the young woman had been found. \u201cWe share in the joy of this discovery with her family, the northeast Florida community, and law enforcement as they celebrate this news,\u201d the spokesman, Dan Leveton, said in a statement. \u201cLike most hospitals, we currently have specialized,     security measures in place, both   and electronic, to protect newborns and their mothers. \u201d Ms. Manigo, somehow, has taken it all in stride so far. And for her, Mom still means Ms. Williams, who is being held at the Jacksonville jail without bond. \u201cWhen I close my eyes, I see my mother,\u201d she said. \u201cI like that. I love that. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562983.5971725}
