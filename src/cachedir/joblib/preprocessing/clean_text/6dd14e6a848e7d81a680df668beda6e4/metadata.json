Spicer was scolded by his boss, pilloried as a liar, hammered by journalists, mocked by Stephen Colbert, taunted by the   ice cream brand Dippin\u2019 Dots and held up as the poster child for an administration that can play fast and loose with the facts. No wonder he was looking for his flak jacket. \u201cIs this bulletproof?\u201d Mr. Spicer asked one afternoon last week, peering into a closet in his sparse West Wing office as he hunted for the combat vest that, by cheeky tradition, is passed down from one presidential spokesman to the next. Until recently, Mr. Spicer was the public voice and chief strategist of the Republican National Committee, the epitome of establishment Washington. Now he is the face of an administration bent on upending the status quo and waging war on the news media, surprising colleagues here with how comfortably he has embraced Mr. Trump\u2019s ire toward the press. The day after the inauguration, he marched into the White House briefing room on Mr. Trump\u2019s orders and lambasted stunned reporters as \u201cdishonest\u201d while claiming, against available evidence, that the inauguration had been the most attended in history. (He later said his count included viewers watching online.) The ironic hashtag #spicerfacts was soon trending online. Days later, Mr. Spicer defended Mr. Trump\u2019s false claims about rampant voter fraud, referring to studies that do not back up the assertion and saying the president \u201cbelieves what he believes. \u201d On Thursday, he had to walk back his suggestion that Mr. Trump would impose a major tax on Mexican imports, jolting global markets. The reaction has been harsh. \u201cThere\u2019s no learning curve on a moral compass,\u201d said John Weaver, a Republican strategist who has advised Senator John McCain of Arizona and Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a learning curve to tell the truth from fiction. \u201d If he\u2019s bothered by the blowback, Mr. Spicer, 45, who had long dreamed of standing behind the White House lectern, is not showing it. \u201cWe have a free press  \u2014   I get it,\u201d Mr. Spicer said last week during an interview in his office, where a giant television broadcasts four   stations at once. \u201cBut the press doesn\u2019t like it when you call out their errors the same way they call out everyone else\u2019s. \u201d Statements from the White House, Mr. Spicer argued, should be given the same leeway afforded a news organization. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many corrections are in The New York Times any given day,\u201d Mr. Spicer said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t wake up every day and go, \u2018O. K. you\u2019re all liars. \u2019\u201d Over a   conversation, Mr. Spicer  \u2014   who ate   ice cream from a cup branded with the presidential seal  \u2014   was by turns defensive and relaxed, and still excited by the novelty of working in the West Wing. Grabbing a history book, he flipped to a page with a list of previous press aides. \u201cDiane Sawyer had that office!\u201d he said, proudly. A framed photograph of himself at the White House lectern, taken days earlier, was displayed on a mantel. A note from Barack Obama\u2019s press secretary, Josh Earnest, was nearby. \u201cIt was very, \u2018What an amazing honor it is,\u2019\u201d Mr. Spicer said of the letter. Asked if he was bothered by Mr. Trump\u2019s unpredictable Twitter posts, Mr. Spicer shrugged. \u201cYou get the ability to wake up and have an issue or an idea become front and center in a second,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge thing. \u201d The president \u201cdrives the news,\u201d Mr. Spicer said. \u201cI help provide updates. \u201d A stocky Navy reservist who grew up in   Rhode Island, Mr. Spicer prides himself on persistence. He attended a prestigious Catholic high school on a scholarship, sending away for brochures for the school without his parents\u2019 knowledge. After graduating from Connecticut College, he bounced around working on campaigns, briefly living in an R. V. without heat or hot water. Years ago, a line drive at a softball game smacked into Mr. Spicer\u2019s jaw, leaving his mouth wired shut for weeks. \u201cBe careful,\u201d his teammate told doctors on the way to the hospital. \u201cHe talks for a living. \u201d He climbed his way up the Washington ladder, representing Republicans in Congress before landing in the office of the United States trade representative in the George W. Bush administration. His jaw has since recovered: The Washington Post reported that Mr. Spicer chews, and swallows whole, more than 20 pieces of Orbitz cinnamon gum a day. He is still finding his place in Mr. Trump\u2019s   inner circle. A Washington insider among political outsiders, Mr. Spicer joined the Trump campaign in August, against the advice of friends who warned against tying himself to an unpredictable candidate. On the eve of the election, Mr. Spicer privately told several journalists that Mr. Trump\u2019s odds of victory were slim. Expressing those misgivings may have been a move to soften the blow to the party in case of a Trump defeat, but was the sort of disloyalty that is anathema in Trump World. \u201cSometimes he was a little less enthusiastic about our direction than other times,\u201d said Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist. \u201cBut he hung in there. \u201d Mr. Bannon, the former chairman of Breitbart News, rarely speaks to reporters on the record. But he reached out to a reporter unprompted to praise Mr. Spicer after learning of this profile, a sign of the Trump White House\u2019s support for Mr. Spicer after a tumultuous first week. Mr. Trump criticized Mr. Spicer\u2019s initial fiery appearance in the White House briefing room, urging him to wear a sharper suit and appear more confident, according to a person with knowledge of the conversations. (\u201cHe was disappointed with how the overall news cycle was going,\u201d Mr. Spicer said in the interview, declining to elaborate.) But Mr. Trump was pleased with Mr. Spicer\u2019s   briefing on Monday, calling Mr. Spicer a \u201csuperstar. \u201d \u201cHe\u2019s a fighter,\u201d Mr. Bannon said in a telephone interview, during which he also urged the news media to \u201ckeep its mouth shut and just listen for a while. \u201d \u201cSean Spicer is much too polite to the media,\u201d Mr. Bannon added. \u201cI\u2019m the guy who wanted them out of the building. \u201d (He was referring to a proposal, scrapped for now, to move the White House briefing room from its current West Wing home.) Mr. Spicer has also heard from supporters who say his   of the news media was long overdue. \u201cAccountability goes both ways,\u201d said former Representative Mike Pappas, a New Jersey Republican who hired Mr. Spicer in the 1990s, adding that Mr. Spicer\u2019s complaints were  . \u201cThere\u2019s a clear bias against people like me, and people like him, and people like the man he works for,\u201d Mr. Pappas said. \u201cYou have a right to your bias, but don\u2019t report it as factual. \u201d Clifford Hobbins, Mr. Spicer\u2019s high school history teacher, dismissed questions about his former student\u2019s integrity. \u201cHe is as honest as the day is long,\u201d said Mr. Hobbins, who said he had voted for Mr. Trump. \u201cI\u2019ve been very proud of the way he handled himself. \u201d Mr. Spicer, who was barely known outside Washington, is still adjusting to national fame. More than five million people tuned in for his first formal press briefing last week, with cable news channels and some broadcast networks taking the proceedings live. The discovery that he had posted on Twitter multiple times about his disdain for Dippin\u2019 Dots, and its slogan, \u201cThe Ice Cream of the Future,\u201d prompted the company to send him an open letter that went viral. Mr. Spicer sounded exasperated when the subject came up. \u201dIt\u2019s a joke,\u201d he said. \u201cHow long can they be \u2018the ice cream of the future\u2019? You can\u2019t actually be the future forever. \u201d Finishing his ice cream  \u2014   which was not    \u2014   Mr. Spicer shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019re not here to be someone\u2019s buddy. You\u2019re here to enact the president\u2019s agenda,\u201d he said of his job. \u201cAnd if you think it\u2019s going to be anything bad, then this isn\u2019t the job for you. \u201d Still, when asked about his first weekend, when he blasted the news media on instructions from an aggrieved boss, Mr. Spicer allowed himself a grimace. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the Saturday I thought I was waking up to,\u201d he said.'"}, "time": 1742561823.4968035}
