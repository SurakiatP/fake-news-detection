[DHS Secretary John F. Kelly lifted most of the restrictions imposed on Border Patrol agents under the previous administration and ordered Border Patrol agents expand their efforts to enforce laws against illegal border crossings. The order came in a memo obtained by Breitbart Texas from DHS officials and discontinued President Obama\u2019s \u201ccatch and release\u201d program known as the \u201cPriority Enforcement Program\u201d (PEP) enacted on November 20, 2014. The order leaves in place, President Obama\u2019s deferred action programs for children brought to the U. S. illegally by their parents.  \u201cExcept as specifically noted above, the Department no longer will exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement,\u201d Secretary Kelly wrote in the memorandum. \u201cIn faithfully executing the immigration laws, Department personnel should take enforcement actions in accordance with applicable law. \u201d To support the expanded enforcement actions, Kelly ordered the hiring of an additional 5, 000 Border Patrol agents and 500 U. S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Air and Marine Operations (AMO) officers. \u201cCBP has insufficient   to effectively detect, track, and apprehend all aliens illegally entering the United States,\u201d Kelly continued. \u201cThe United States needs additional agents and officers to ensure complete operational control of the border. \u201d Leaked Border Patrol training materials released in an article by Breitbart Texas Managing Director Brandon Darby revealed the frustrating requirements placed on Border Patrol agents under the PEP program. \u201cNothing says don\u2019t arrest, but it clearly says don\u2019t waste your time because the alien will not be put into detention, sent back or deported,\u201d an official within U. S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) told Darby at the time. \u201cThere is literally no reason to arrest an illegal alien because they are specifically telling Border Patrol there will be no consequence for the illegal alien. It is a waste of time and resources to arrest someone who is off limits for detainment or deportation and the documents make that fact clear. Border Patrol agents are now being trained to be social workers, not law enforcement. \u201d After the Obama Administration had put the PEP program in place, a high percentage of migrants apprehended at the border were released with a \u201cnotice to appear. \u201d \u201c[The Obama] administration has handcuffed the Border Patrol,\u201d Babeu told reporters in a March 2016 press conference reported by Breitbart Texas. This new set of orders from Secretary Kelly effectively removes those handcuffs and ends Obama\u2019s catch and release programs. \u201cA country has a duty and obligation to secure its border. That didn\u2019t change because Obama was the president,\u201d Jackson County, Texas, Sheriff Andy Louderback told Breitbart Texas on Tuesday. \u201cWe are back to the rule of law now, and the gloves are off, there\u2019s no PEP. We are allowed to do our job. I am on cloud 80. \u201d Louderback previously served as president of the Texas Sheriff\u2019s Association. Breitbart Texas was at a press conference when sheriffs from across the state descended upon the Texas Capitol in August 2015 to decry the federal policies of the Obama administration saying, criminal aliens have free rein. \u201cPolicies that facilitate the release of removable aliens apprehended at and between the ports of entry, which allow them to abscond and fail to appear at their removal hearings, undermine the border security mission,\u201d Kelly stated. \u201cSuch policies, collectively referred to as \u2018 \u2019 shall end. \u201d Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.
