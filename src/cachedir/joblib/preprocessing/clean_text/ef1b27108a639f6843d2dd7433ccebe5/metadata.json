[From the Hollywood Reporter:  A recent Saturday Night Live skit depicts two   cops yelling at a handcuffed man they just arrested because he didn\u2019t think La La Land was great. \u201cIt dragged in the middle,\u201d he complains. \u201cYou sick son of a bitch!\u201d one cop barks. \u201cYou disgust me!\u201d This pretty much distills the rift in American pop culture that is nearly as contentious as the rift in American politics. As someone who finds La La Land bold, daring and deserving of all its critical and financial success, I can also admit that there are a few elements that warrant closer examination, particularly regarding its portrayal of jazz, romance and people of color. In fact, the better a work of art is, the more we must dissect it, because now we\u2019re not just measuring Rotten Tomatoes popularity or boffo box office, we\u2019re assessing its proper place in our cultural canon. No, I don\u2019t think the film needs more black people.   Damien Chazelle should tell the story as he sees fits with whatever ethnic arrangement he desires. However, it is fair to question his color wheel when it involves certain historical elements  \u2014   such as jazz.   \u2026     The white guy wants to preserve the black roots of jazz while the black guy is the sellout? This could be a deliberate ironic twist, but if it is, it\u2019s a distasteful one for  . One legitimate complaint that marginalized people (women, people of color, Muslims, the LGBT community, etc.) have had about Hollywood in the past is that when they were portrayed, it was done in a negative way. The ditzy blonde, the Muslim terrorist, the gay predator are all familiar stereotypes from years of TV and movies. So much has been done in recent years to overcome those debasing images, but we still have to be careful. It\u2019s not that a black man can\u2019t be the sellout or the drug dealer, it\u2019s just that they shouldn\u2019t be if they\u2019re the only prominent black character in the story. Whether it\u2019s intentional or unintentional, that sends a bigoted message rippling through our society.   \u2026     Read the full column at the Hollywood Reporter.'"}, "time": 1742561950.7859626}
