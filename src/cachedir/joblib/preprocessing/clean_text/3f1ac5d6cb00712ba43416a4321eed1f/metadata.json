Rather than repeating the standard claim that the North Korean government is taking extreme measures to intimidate its enemies into making concessions, some officials have begun to suggest that the North Korean government desires nuclear weapons for defensive purposes. \\nAfter the North Korean government conducted its fifth underground nuclear test on September 9, 2016, former US official Victor Cha presented the new line of thinking. \u201cThis is not a cry for negotiations,\u201d Cha told The New York Times . \u201cThis is very clearly a serious effort at amassing real nuclear capabilities that they can use to deter the US and others.\u201d \\nA few days later, Cha shared the same logic with a subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. \u201cTesting was once interpreted by pundits to be an attention-getting effort for dialogue with the United States,\u201d but \u201cit would be irresponsible today to adhere to such an interpretation,\u201d Cha stated . In today\u2019s world, \u201cNorth Korea is executing a strategy designed to demonstrate a survivable nuclear deterrent before the next US administration comes into office.\u201d In short, Cha insisted that the North Korean government sought to acquire nuclear weapons for the purpose of deterring its enemies. \\nThreat or No Threat? \\nOf course, not everyone in Washington agrees with such thinking. Although Cha and other strategic analysts have proposed that the North Korean government is rationally pursuing a nuclear deterrent to defend itself against the United States, high-level officials in Washington insist that nothing could be further from the truth. \\nNotably, Secretary of State John Kerry has refuted the idea that the North Korean government needs to take defensive measures. For \u201cany person of common sense,\u201d the answer to the question of whether the North Korean government has to defend itself against the United States is \u201cno,\u201d Kerry announced on October 19, 2016. \u201cEverybody knows that.\u201d \\nAfter making his point, Kerry then insisted that the United States posed no threat to North Korea because the US government has made no recent efforts to destroy the country. \u201cThe United States has had the power to wipe out North Korea for years \u2013 for years,\u201d Kerry noted. \u201cAnd if indeed that was our goal, we wouldn\u2019t be sitting around waiting while they\u2019re getting additional nuclear weapons.\u201d \\nCertainly, US officials have not recently attempted to wipe out North Korea. Although the United States had once destroyed most of North Korea during the Korean War, when it spent three years carpet-bombing the country and destroying most North Korean cities, US officials have not resorted to comparable tactics in the country since the armistice ended the fighting in 1953. \\nAt the same time, US officials have continued to take other actions to pressure, marginalize, and isolate North Korea. For starters, US officials have worked with their allies to impose restrictive sanctions on the country. Certainly, \u201cwe\u2019re always looking at ways we can continue to apply pressure,\u201d State Department Spokesperson Mark C. Toner acknowledged during a press briefing on July 19, 2016. In fact, \u201cthe sanctions are pretty severe right now.\u201d \\nTwo months later, White House official Ben Rhodes made a similar point, only providing more emphasis. \u201cSo we\u2019ve passed now through the U.N. Security Council the strongest sanctions ever on North Korea,\u201d Rhodes stated . The sanctions are \u201chaving an impact\u201d and \u201cputting a tighter squeeze on North Korea.\u201d \\nTo put an even tighter squeeze on North Korea, US officials have also made it clear that they are ready to take more direct action. Taking advantage of their extraordinary military power in the region, including the 28,500 US soldier s that are stationed in South Korea, US officials have continually reminded the North Korean government that they are ready to resume the Korean War at a moment\u2019s notice. \\nOn the day that the North Korean government conducted its fifth underground nuclear test, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter made the point by stating that \u201cUS forces on the Korean Peninsula are always ready, and this is true every single day, to fight tonight.\u201d \\nA few days later, US officials then sent an even more powerful signal of their preparedness, flying two nuclear-capable B-1B bombers over South Korea in a display of military power. As US General Vincent K. Brooks explained at the time, US officials wanted to demonstrate their commitment to using their \u201cfull range of military capabilities,\u201d such as nuclear weapons. \\nExpect Serious Consequences \\nBy applying constant pressure to North Korea, US officials have sent another powerful message to the North Korean government. Although officials in Washington may deny that they are threatening North Korea, they have made it clear that the North Korean government can expect to face serious consequences for continuing to defy the United States with its nuclear weapons program. \\n\u201cWhat I can tell you is our policy, with respect to North Korea\u2019s provocations and the resolve of the United States and the international community to try to put adequate pressure on them to change their behavior, has not changed and remains the same,\u201d State Department Spokesperson John Kirby confirmed on October 25, 2016. \\nEven so, some officials are now providing another way of understanding the situation. On the same day that Kirby made his statement, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper indicated that the United States has ultimately left the North Korean government with no serious alternatives. \u201cI think the notion of getting the North Koreans to denuclearize is probably a lost cause,\u201d Clapper stated . \u201cThey are not going to do that. That is their ticket to survival.\u201d Indeed, Clapper indicated that the North Korean government would find it necessary to maintain a powerful nuclear arsenal in order to deter the constant threats it faces from the United States. \\n\u201cAnd I got a good taste of that when I was there, about how the world looks from their vantage,\u201d Clapper added. \u201cAnd they are under siege and they are very paranoid.\u201d \\nIn short, a number of US officials are now beginning to come to terms with one of the main reasons why the North Korean government is making such a major effort to acquire nuclear weapons. These officials are starting to believe that the North Korean government is working to build an arsenal of nuclear weapons to create a powerful deterrent against the United States. \\nEdward Hunt writes about war and empire.
