[The incident occurred in the stairwell of an apartment block just after 10 pm on Friday evening,   reports.  \u201cI thought it was another country that has come to attack. I thought it was a war  \u2026    \u201d said one witness. Authorities suspect the blast was caused by an \u201cattack\u201d involving some form of homemade device, and the National Guard and a police bomb squad were called to the scene. \u201cWe suspect that there are some kind of bomb attacks carried out here\u201d said P\u00e5l Engebretsen, the police officer leading the investigation last night. \u201cSome people were seen running from the scene in connection with a bang, but who these people are we do not know at present\u201d added police press officer Thomas Fuxborg on Saturday morning. JUST NU: Explosion i G\u00f6teborg  \u2014   d\u00f6rr s\u00f6nderspr\u00e4ngd i Majorna https:  .  pic. twitter.   \u2014     (@GoteborgsPosten) March 10, 2017,  \u201cWe will examine who lives near the stairwell and knock on doors to see if anyone saw or heard anything yesterday\u201d he continued. By Saturday morning, the emergency services, National Guard and police bomb squad had left the scene. \u201cWe have not received the results of the technical investigation yet\u201d added Mr. Fuxborg. \u201cBut bomb technicians found no metal residues which usually indicates a hand grenade was used, but something else has exploded there. What it is is still unclear\u201d. He said it was possible the device was homemade and said motives could include scaring someone specific in the building or simply \u201cmischief\u201d. The number of grenade attacks and car fires in the relatively small nation has shot up in recent years  \u2014   allegedly because of warring migrant gangs  \u2014   and the number of fatal shootings has doubled in nine years. Since Mr. Trump made his intervention last month, there have been grenade attacks in Stockholm and Malm\u00f6, shootings and riots in the \u201cNo Go Zone\u201d of Rinkeby in Stockholm, and ambulance workers demanding \u201cmilitary\u201d defence so they can enter the area.'"}, "time": 1742562839.3942933}
