[Already by 7 pm a man was hospitalised with   burns to his face and hands after fireworks were hurled at a group of homeless people outside the city\u2019s main train station. More than two dozen people were injured at festivities in Dortmund, some seriously.  The events of the night were described as \u201cquiet\u201d by police in a statement, and as \u201cnormal\u201d by a spokesman for the city government. But at 11:30pm police announced they were adding to their already much larger than usual presence in the city centre for New Year, sending in further reinforcements of officers. This came after the force reported there being a \u201clarge number of young men from North Africa\u201d in town, with federal police officer Volker Stall noting there was an \u201caggressive mood\u201d towards the public and police. At midnight, the situation threatened to escalate. A livewire published by the Ruhr Nachrichten reported that a crowd of \u201cat least 1, 000 young men\u201d began throwing fireworks into crowds of visitors, which also included families with children. Asked by officers to stop, the mob turned to pelt fireworks at police instead. Despite the prohibition of lighting pyrotechnics near churches, firemen had to intervene after fireworks were launched at St Reinolds, Germany\u2019s oldest church, setting the roof alight. Also reported by the Ruhr Nachrichten was that \u201ca group of Syrians sang in celebration of the ceasefire in Syria. \u201d However, a video posted to Twitter by one of the newspaper\u2019s reporters, paired with the caption \u201cSyrians celebrate the truce in their country\u201d shows a group of men chanting \u2018Allahu Akhbar\u2019 around the flag of   and Islamic State collaborators, the \u2018Free Syrian Army\u2019. #Silvester in #Dortmund: Syrer feiern den Waffenstillstand in ihrem Land. pic. twitter.   \u2014   Peter Bandermann (@RN_Bandermann) December 31, 2016,  There was uproar in Germany last month when St Reinold\u2019s Church was occupied by identitarians in protest against the Islamisation of Germany. The demonstration was denounced as a \u201cclear provocation by  \u201d by Dortmund pastor Friedrich Stiller. Dortmund\u2019s \u2018Special Commissioner for Tolerance and Democracy\u2019 demanded more taxpayers\u2019 money be put towards \u201cComeback\u201d the city\u2019s \u2018  deradicalisation programme\u2019 in the wake of the protest. \u201cThe money the city gives, 50, 000 euros per year, is no longer enough,\u201d Hartmut   said.
