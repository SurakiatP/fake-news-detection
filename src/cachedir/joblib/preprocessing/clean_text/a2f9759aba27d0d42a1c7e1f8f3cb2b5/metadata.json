[Bajrang Dal is the youth wing of a Hindu fundamentalist organization. The party is \u201cstrictly against Western norms and believes youth should stop degrading the culture of India by celebrating Valentine\u2019s Day,\u201d as ANI News explains.  Bajrang Dal spends Valentine\u2019s Day prowling the streets and pummeling any couple they chance across: #WATCH Bajrang Dal activists thrash couples in Bihar\u2019s Muzaffarpur in a protest against Valentine\u2019s Day pic. twitter.   \u2014   ANI (@ANI_news) February 14, 2017,  This year was reportedly supposed to be different. Leaders of the umbrella group in charge of Bajrang Dal urged its members not to assault couples because those who indulge in expressions of love on Valentine\u2019s Day are, they claimed, \u201csimilar to nature of animals,\u201d and thus any attempt at convincing them to abandon the practice would be unlikely to sway them. India\u2019s Daily O addressed the Bajrang Dal problem in an editorial dripping with sarcasm, beginning with the observation that lonely singles have the consolation of knowing they won\u2019t be thrashed by a gang of \u201c      scumbags\u201d on Valentine\u2019s Day: These   detectives travel in packs with hockey sticks and lead pipes. They can sniff out   couples from a mile away. Once they have cornered the poor prey, one of two things can happen: if it\u2019s a   couple, they\u2019ll get them married. God forbid, if it is an   couple, well, let us say we\u2019ll pray for the dearly departed. Is there no way to escape these vicious hunters? Is there no respite for hormonal teenagers who just want to gift each other those pink,   things? That crack about forcibly marrying Hindu couples is not hyperbole. India Today reports that Bajrang Dal has warned Indian youth it will perform marriage rituals on the spot for any couples it catches wandering through public places on Valentine\u2019s Day, physically dragging their parents to the scene if necessary. Greater Kashmir reports that Bajrang Dal is receiving substantial online support from India\u2019s Muslims, who also regard Valentine\u2019s Day as symbolic of Western decadence. \u201cThe other name of Islam is modesty, while Valentine Day [sic] is sheer immodesty,\u201d one Muslim supporter of the Hindu youth gang wrote.'"}, "time": 1742561867.826207}
