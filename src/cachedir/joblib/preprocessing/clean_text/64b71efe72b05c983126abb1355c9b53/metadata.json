And I love ice cream. I don\u2019t love tuna fish ice cream. \u201d \u201cShow me the study where fans and consumers are demanding they\u2019re together,\u201d he continued. \u201cI  think the NBA ratings are down 15 percent. They are down 28 percent in Ohio. So, show me where everybody loves  \u2014   [ESPN] is down 50 percent across the board. The audience is telling you, \u2018We like politics, but we turn to Fox News for it. And we like sports and we turn to you for it.\u2019 show where the consumer is demanding we mix sports and politics. I\u2019d like to see the study where it\u2019s effective. Whitlock agreed, but added that \u201ctraditional sports fans\u201d do not want \u201c  politics\u201d in sports. \u201cI think there\u2019s some truth in what you\u2019re saying. I think traditional sports fans and most sports fans don\u2019t want   politics in their sports. I think there is consistency and synergy between conservative values, which are taught in sports. And so much of it has been left that I think it is bad business,\u201d Whitlock said. Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent'"}, "time": 1742563661.192895}
