However all three of them would nod as if they had understood the same thing,\u201d said a senior party member close to Mulayam Singh. \u201cObviously I myself don\u2019t get half of his sentences, but I have become good at reading his lip movements,\u201d he added. \\nThis is not the first time Mulayam Singh has been informed of it. As many as three decades ago, school teachers of Akhilesh Yadav had told Mulayam Singh that his son doesn\u2019t listen to his father. While Mulayam mistook it for Akhilesh being a disobedient child, what the teachers actually meant was that Akhilesh hardly understands what his father speaks. \\nAccording to sources, Mulayam Singh is currently conducting a test among family members to determine who comes closest in understanding his speech in order to accordingly finalize party positions. \\n\u201cTo K!$@#$ Communal $Q#$ Q# %@bey @# #$$!@$ #$@#$@ Secular G#$#$%# @# UP, B bil #$Q$ $#$@#$$ Congrss P#!!$ #$@$ #$@ ByeP d#@# #$@$ erection,\u201d said a family member when asked to repeat what Netaji said. \\nMore than half of the family members couldn\u2019t come even remotely close. It was only Akhilesh and Shivpal Yadav who could clearly identify some of the key words from the sentence, which were \u2018communal\u2019, \u2018secular\u2019, \u2018election\u2019, \u2018UP\u2019 and \u2018Congress\u2019. \\nLater, confusion turned to consternation when an outsider by name Amar Singh heard this family conversation and clearly recited what Netaji said, which was: \u201cTo keep Communal forces away and have a secular Government in UP, we will tie up with Congress party and not with BJP during next elections.\u201d \\nWhile Mulayam lauded Amar for the translation, Akhilesh got seriously pissed by the fact that a family conversation was heard by an outsider surreptitiously and launched into an emotional speech to his supporters. \\n(The writer is the author of the book, \u2018The Bogus Read\u2019 ) Tweet About D-MAN \\nA jack of many trades who now wants to master some.
