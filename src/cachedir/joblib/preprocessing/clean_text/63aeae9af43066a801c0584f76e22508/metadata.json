One such skill is the ability to make the weather sound new each day. As a meteorologist for 12 News, Phoenix\u2019s NBC affiliate, Matt Pace aims to make the recurring sunshine interesting, which is no easy task. I\u2019ve watched Mr. Pace on the air as he searches for just the right words, from a limited list of options, to convey the very straightforward fact that it is so darn hot outside. \u201cI go, \u2018It\u2019s hot,\u2019 or, \u2018It\u2019s above average,\u2019 or, \u2018It\u2019s going to be extremely warm today,\u2019\u201d he said on a   day, from the safety of a Starbucks where he sipped a strawberry smoothie to \u201ctake the edge off the heat,\u201d as he put it. \u201cThere\u2019s also, \u2018It\u2019s really hot out there,\u2019 or, \u2018It\u2019s hot, hot, hot,\u2019 or just, \u2018Triple hot! \u2019\u201d On Twitter  \u2014   where Mr. Pace\u2019s often funny, always informative posts often end in exclamation points  \u2014   it may well come to this: There are times when the best approach is to scrap adjectives or superlatives altogether, face the camera and declare, \u201cThe high is going to be 118 degrees today. \u201d When it\u2019s that hot, Mr. Pace said, simplicity is the best way to drive the point across. Before delivering forecasts on TV, Mr. Pace, who has a Ph. D. in meteorology and climatology, was part of a team of meteorologists who monitored the weather from the edge of a runway at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, where the city\u2019s official temperatures are recorded. (It also happens to be one of the warmest places in Phoenix.) He was basically the official whose temperature readings and assessments of visibility during dust storms might force the tower to suspend takeoffs. \u201cI normally worked the overnight shift, when it was cooler,\u201d he said, drawing quotation marks in the air as he said the word \u201ccooler\u201d to highlight what everyone who lives here knows all too well: that \u201ccooler\u201d has another meaning in Phoenix. During the peak of summer, overnight temperatures hardly drop below 90 degrees. But, as they say, it\u2019s a dry heat, at least when it\u2019s not monsoon season, with its powerful   storms. \u201cWhat the dry heat means,\u201d Mr. Pace said, \u201cis that it might be 111 degrees, but it will feel like 107. \u201d He took another sip from his smoothie. \u201cI know that still feels ridiculously hot,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think there\u2019s also this psychological thing to living here: You walk outside and you know it will be hot. People just accept it. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561924.9109168}
