The room is on fire. This is fine. The meme, derived from a webcomic by the    illustrator K. C. Green, is a bit like those \u201cKeep Calm and Carry On\u201d posters, just with an absurdist twist. It is halfway between a shrug and complete denial of reality. \u201cIt\u2019s a basic concept that can apply to a lot of differing situations,\u201d Mr. Green wrote in an email on Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s the whole idea behind memes and the like. \u201d Many memes, like \u201cDat Boi\u201d or \u201cDamn, Daniel,\u201d exemplify the sort of     nonsense that can briefly take over pop culture before vanishing. But a durable meme, like \u201cCrying Jordan\u201d or \u201cThis Is Fine,\u201d allows people to use it as cultural commentary. \u201cThis Is Fine,\u201d which is actually part of a larger comic created for Mr. Green\u2019s webcomic series \u201cGunshow\u201d in 2013, has inspired fan art and a number of derivative works on websites like Tumblr. The illustration reached the political mainstream with the G. O. P. \u2019s tweet, and what followed was a relatively unusual exchange between the political establishment and an artist. The Republicans had not compensated Mr. Green. (It\u2019s common for musicians to criticize a political candidate\u2019s use of their song, but a cartoonist criticizing the use of a meme derived from his art? That\u2019s new.) \u201cHaving this comic and other images from my past works be made into memes before, this was really nothing completely new,\u201d Mr. Green said of his reasoning for creating the elephant image. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t get to like some of the people who do use it, including the G. O. P. \u201d Slate saw the Republican tweet as a   development: \u201cThe trouble with such tweets  \u2014   whether they\u2019re coming from left or right  \u2014   is that they\u2019re mostly going to make sense to people who will discard them as soon as they spread too far,\u201d Jacob Brogan wrote. But another chapter appears to have given the meme new life: Mr. Green issued an update through The Nib, called This Is Not Fine, in which the dog wakes up from his stupor and panics. \u201cI thought it would be more angry when I was writing,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it turned into more just losing your cool in a situation, which reflects better, I think. \u201d In an email, Matt Bors, an editor of The Nib, said the update was commissioned because \u201c2016 has been such a gross, depressing slog. \u201d He added: \u201cYou acclimate to the crazy, you think \u2018this is fine.\u2019 It\u2019s not. We needed that dog to come back. \u201d In this case, with the staying power comes the merchandise: A Kickstarter campaign launched this week has raised more than $200, 000 to manufacture a plush This Is Fine toy. In the meantime, Mr. Green also continues to work on other projects: He writes and draws \u201cHe Is a Good Boy,\u201d a webcomic about an acorn that explores themes of horror, gore and existentialism. This is fine.'"}, "time": 1742563185.6545475}
