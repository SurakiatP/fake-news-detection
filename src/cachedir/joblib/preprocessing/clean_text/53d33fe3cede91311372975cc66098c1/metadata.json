[Each of the four European newspapers, one each from France, Germany, the UK and Spain, will follow a group of migrants in their respective countries seeking to answer questions including: \u201cWill Europe change them or will they change Europe?\u201d Le Monde has reported.  Topics to be explored reportedly include how newcomers feel about a \u201crising tide of resentment that they encounter in this populist age\u201d and which countries in Europe are \u201cbest at helping refugees settle\u201d. During the project, entitled \u2018The New Arrivals\u2019 The Guardian says that papers will \u201cwork closely\u201d together to report on \u201chow Europe looks through immigrant eyes\u201d. Both Le Monde and The Guardian say the 18 month project will look at the question of \u201cwhether European society is changing the new arrivals  \u2014   and vice versa\u201d. El Pa\u00eds journalists will be looking at the daily lives of a football team of Africans who illegally entered Spain individually via methods including arriving by boat and scaling the nation\u2019s border wall. Le Monde has chosen to follow a family of nine from South Sudan who are due to be moved to a village of just 850 people in Corr\u00e8ze, France, after having lived in Israel for several years. In Germany, Der Spiegel will chronicle the lives of a large Syrian family who relocated from Damascus to L\u00fcneburg, while The Guardian will follow a farmer from Afghanistan and his    son who are living in Luton. \u201cWe will produce a series of films about our subjects in an attempt to find out what is the best way to handle refugees, what these uprooted people value in their new homes, and whether their new neighbourhoods welcome or reject them,\u201d writes The Guardian. Managing editor at El Pa\u00eds, David Alandete, said that with the project his newspaper: \u201cAim[s] to tell [migrants\u2019] stories: their pain, fears, wishes and projects. By following a soccer team in Spain we hope to reveal what the human side of the crisis is. \u201d Decrying \u201cstereotypes and prejudices\u201d as Bundestag elections are due to take place in Germany later this year, editor Eva Th\u00f6ne added that Spiegel Online \u201chope[s] to find a way to combine moving stories and portraits with a differentiated view on immigration\u201d. Funding the project is the European Journalism Centre, whose partners include several projects funded by Hungarian billionaire George Soros including the Open Society Foundations and Open Society Georgia Foundation, via a grant by the globalist Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In January, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Sanz Mingote, director of the world\u2019s largest   news agency EFE, said that media corporations need to collaborate in order to \u201ccombat populism\u201d.'"}, "time": 1742563880.908409}
