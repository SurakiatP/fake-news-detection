You will never be voted in again, including Theresa May who shoehorned herself into the role of prime minister. \\nGuyanese Gina Miller, who was instrumental in this decision is not even British, she is some investment banker cunt with no mandate to thwart the EU referendum. \\nAs for the judges involved, you have no right to undermine the will of the people. It is most certainly a question of corruption at the highest levels where these supposed upholders of law, are working against the law and undermining democracy and Britain\u2019s sovereign rights. \\n17.5 million people voted for Brexit and 17.5 million people will have their say in 2020 when the right people will be put in charge. \\nThe people never forget.'"}, "time": 1742564396.2029438}
