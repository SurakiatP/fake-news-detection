Mass immigration, particularly illegal immigration, was a fait accompli. There is nothing the U. S. can do about it, and they must accept that America is \u201cnot their\u201d country and that illegal aliens, particularly Latinos, \u201care not going to leave,\u201d he said.  \u201cI am an immigrant, just like many of you,\u201d Ramos said in Spanish, as translated by the Media Research Center. \u201cI am a proud Latino immigrant here in the United States. My name is Jorge Ramos, and I work at Univision and at the Fusion network. \u201d \u201cAnd you know exactly what is going on here in the United States. There are many people who do not want us to be here, and who want to create a wall in order to separate us,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you know what? This is also our country. Let me repeat this: Our country, not theirs. It is our country. And we are not going to leave. We are nearly 60 million Latinos in the United States,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd thanks to us, the United States eats, grows and, as we\u2019ve seen today, sings and dances. \u201d \u201cSo when they attack us, we already know what we are going to do. We are not going to sit down. We will not shut up. And we will not leave. That is what we are going to do,\u201d he added. Ramos gave his speech on Friday during Premios Lo Nuestro, or \u201cOur Awards,\u201d on Univision. Ramos, who immigrated to the U. S. from Mexico, frequently portrays American law as unjust and prejudiced and supports open borders. \u201cThe taboo issue of an open border should be tackled. Not now. Politically it is impossible even to discuss that. But I don\u2019t see why we can\u2019t have in North America the same immigration that they have within the European Union,\u201d Ramos said to Time magazine in 2014. The U. S. should not enforce its immigration laws even after illegal aliens kill Americans, he said during a CNN interview in August 2015, because that would be \u201ccompletely unfair\u201d to the illegal population. In June of 2016, Ramos told a crowd of illegal aliens gathered in Houston, Texas, \u201cI think you the DREAMers are the Rosa Parks of this time. \u201d And Ramos\u2019 views are not fringe ones in Mexico: A 2013 poll found that 66 percent of Mexicans believe the U. S. government has no right to limit immigration, while 52 percent said Mexicans have a right to be in the United States. Another 88 percent said it is fine to enter the U. S. illegally if one needs money. Over half, 56 percent, said they had friends or family who tried to immigrate to the U. S. illegally.'"}, "time": 1742563719.6225345}
