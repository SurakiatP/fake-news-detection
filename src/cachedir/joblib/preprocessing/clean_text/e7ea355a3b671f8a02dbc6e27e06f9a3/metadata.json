The story of Coy Mathis, a transgender girl who was born a boy, garnered international attention in 2013 when her parents, Jeremy and Kathryn Mathis, filed a complaint accusing the school district of violating the state\u2019s   law. The Mathises went on to win their case, but not before coming under heavy criticism for putting Coy, then a    first grader, in front of reporters and camera crews and on television with Katie Couric. Now, they\u2019re poised to be foisted back into the spotlight with the documentary \u201cGrowing Up Coy,\u201d which has its premiere on June 16 in New York at the Human Rights Watch Film Festival. Directed by Eric Juhola and produced by his husband, Jeremy Stulberg, \u201cGrowing Up Coy\u201d picks up with the Mathis family in early 2013, about six weeks before they went public with their case. Together with their lawyer, the Mathises believed that speaking openly was necessary to sway the public in Coy\u2019s favor and to help win her case. But, as the documentary shows, the move unleashed a media feeding frenzy that previewed the fights that would roil America in 2016, fraying the couple\u2019s relationship, drawing excoriations from talking heads and internet trolls, at times alienating their four other children and indelibly etching Coy\u2019s name into cyberspace\u2019s inexhaustible memory bank. \u201cI think they didn\u2019t know what they were getting into when they started. I don\u2019t think they knew how big it was going to get,\u201d Mr. Juhola said. \u201cI can\u2019t speak for them, but I hope that over time they realize the difference that they made. I think the world is a better place because of them and what they did. \u201d In the course of the documentary, the Mathises moved from Fountain, Colo. a small town near the headquarters of the conservative organization Focus on the Family, to Aurora, Colo. and have since moved elsewhere in the state. They retreated from public view and are unlikely to participate in the promotion of the documentary. The film could not be timelier, with transgender issues at the fore and 11 states suing the Obama administration over its directive telling schools to allow students to use whichever bathroom matches their gender identities. But, Mr. Juhola noted that he and Mr. Stulberg embarked on the project before, in his words, \u201ctrans was, quote, trending. \u201d Wanting to document a transgender person\u2019s fight for rights, the filmmakers were equally intrigued by the Mathises\u2019 staunch support of their child. \u201cThey\u2019re really the first generation of parents letting their young kids express themselves as whatever gender they identify with,\u201d Mr. Juhola said. \u201cA lot of older transgender people who we met, who just transitioned in their 40s, 50s and 60s, said, \u2018Oh my God, I can\u2019t even imagine how different my life would be if I\u2019d had parents like them. \u2019\u201d The Mathises\u2019 troubles with Eagleside Elementary School began in late 2012, when the principal told them that Coy, who began identifying as a girl when she was 18 months old, could no longer use the girls\u2019 bathroom. At that point Coy, who as a triplet has a brother and sister, along with two other sisters, had been living as a girl for a while, wearing sparkly, flouncy dresses and long hair, and had been identified as a girl in medical and legal records. In the documentary, the Mathises describe Coy\u2019s misery in her earliest years when the couple  \u2014   Jeremy is a former Marine and Kathryn is a freelance portrait photographer  \u2014   dressed her as a boy. Deeply anxious, Coy refused to go outside, rarely smiled, had meltdowns when told to line up with the boys at school, and asked her parents when they would take her to the doctor to remove her penis. (No such operation was or is being planned.) \u201cIt was just what it was,\u201d Mr. Mathis said in the film. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a phase. \u201d After hearing from the principal, the Mathises contacted Michael D. Silverman, executive director of the Transgender Legal Defense  Education Fund, who wrote to the school board, hoping for a resolution. The board\u2019s response  \u2014   they cited concerns for other students sharing the bathroom with Coy as she grew older  \u2014   prompted the Mathises to withdraw their children from the school. After some   discussions, Mr. Silverman said, the family agreed that the best action was to take the case public. By showing how achingly normal Coy and her family were, they could put a face  \u2014   an adorable, impish face  \u2014   on an issue that many people at the time were not just unfamiliar with but also stigmatized and feared. \u201cThe motivating factor was, how can we create the conditions where we can win for Coy?\u201d Mr. Silverman said in an interview. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t clear without speaking publicly that anyone would understand what was at stake. \u201d The same reasoning probably prompted the Mathises, who did not respond to interview requests for this article, to also agree to the documentary, Mr. Juhola said. \u201cIt\u2019s really about making the world a better place for Coy by putting images out of transgender people that are positive,\u201d Mr. Juhola said. Just as public controversy raged about Coy\u2019s name and image being made public  \u2014   the public editor of The New York Times weighed in, while, in Colorado and elsewhere, the Mathises were accused of being child abusers and setting Coy up for harassment  \u2014   the documentarians also asked themselves about their own responsibility to protect Coy. In the end, Mr. Juhola said, they deferred to the Mathises\u2019 judgment, which Ms. Mathis addressed in the film. \u201cWe weren\u2019t the ones who stigmatized her to begin with,\u201d Ms. Mathis said. \u201cSending a little girl into a boys bathroom, that\u2019s setting her up to being hurt. \u201d As the couple, in the film, wrestled with whether to agree to yet another interview (they would turn down offers to be in ads and to star in a reality show) Ms. Mathis also mused, on camera, about the duress of living under the microscope. \u201cWhere should we draw the line?\u201d she asked. \u201cWe don\u2019t want her to look back and see that we didn\u2019t stand up for her. \u201d While the news media pressure depicted in the film seems acute, the worst of it largely ended after about six months, in the summer of 2013, when Colorado\u2019s civil rights board ruled in the Mathises\u2019 favor, chastising the school for its \u201csevere and pervasive treatment\u201d and for creating an environment that was \u201chostile, intimidating or offensive. \u201d Mr. Juhola said that as far as he knew, the Mathises remain settled, and welcome, in their new community, where Coy, who will turn 10 this year, is living happily as a girl. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to have to explain who she is, and talk about how she\u2019s different,\u201d Ms. Mathis says, in the film. \u201cShe just wants to be. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628511.867186}
