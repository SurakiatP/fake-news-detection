[In the revised version of Speaker Ryan\u2019s   bill, 14 million people would lose coverage in 2018, and 24 million would lose coverage by 2026. These figures are similar to the CBO\u2019s previous report on the Republican leadership\u2019s bill.  Speaker Ryan\u2019s revised bill, however, saves less money than the previous version. The current version would save $150 billion between 2017 and 2026, compared to the original bill that would have saved $337 billion. The changes to the bill were part of a \u201cmanager\u2019s amendment\u201d offered by GOP leaders to win more House Republican votes. The new CBO report was revealed amidst rancor between conservatives frustrated by the Republican leadership\u2019s inability to repeal Obamacare. Speaker Ryan canceled Thursday\u2019s vote on Ryancare because House leadership lacked the votes to pass the bill.   could be altered again, which might change the CBO score.'"}, "time": 1742561906.3853934}
