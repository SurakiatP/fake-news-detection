Soros is financing MoveOn.org, Black Lives Matter, Demos, and other of his groups to turn out protesters and is even running ads in papers looking for paid drivers and protest coordinators.\\nIn your very relevant books devoted to George Soros: \u201cSoros: Quantum of Chaos\u201d, you reveal the true face of this figure who is the spearhead of several destabilization operations in the world. From where does all the power come that this criminal holds and why is he untouchable?\\nSoros is very wealthy and actually a frontman for an even more powerful and wealthy person, Evelyn de Rothschild, along with his family. They are all the true puppet masters of the world.\\nSoros remains a major element in the anti-Trump device. Can Trump resist him?\\nMORE... Disrespecting the American Imperial Presidency Trump Won, Now What? Will America Survive the Next 4 Years? Defeating White Liberalism in the Age of Trump Trump is actually now being surrounded by people who will serve in his administration who will be loyal to the Soros-Rothschild puppet masters and certainly not to Trump.\\nCan we say that the occult world is more powerful than legal institutions?\\nSecret societies with their crazy rituals have been the bane of human existence since the time of the Sanhedrin and Pharisees in Palestine and the Dionysian cults of the Nile Valley and the Mediterranean region.\\nIn your book \u201c ISIS is US - The Shocking Truth Behind the Army of Terror\u201d, you detail the relations between the USA and ISIS/Daesh. What is the triggering element that has put you on this trail?\\nTrump\\'s national security adviser retired Lt Gen Michael Flynn revealed that the US was supporting ISIS and then he was forced to resign. My own sources in the Middle East confirmed this long before Flynn made his public statement and was fired as Defense Intelligence Agency chief by Obama.\\nYou mention Western Sahara and the involvement of the Clintons in a deal with the Kingdom of Morocco while this case is under the authority of UN. Aren\\'t the Clintons outlaws such Bonnie and Clyde by supporting Morocco against the Sahrawi people and the UN\\'s resolutions?\\nThe Clintons received at least $12 million from the Moroccan government in return for buying their loyalty to Morocco\\'s agenda, which includes permanently annexing Western Sahara as the \"Southern Province.\" Morocco and Israel share the same policy on annexing illegally-occupied territories.\\nAccording to your diverse very interesting analysis, can we assert that the World Government or the false prophets of the New World Order are the real decision-makers of this world?\\nI mentioned a few already, Soros/Rothschild. Others are the Bilderbergs, Bohemian Club, and the Council on Foreign Relations and their counterparts.\\nYou know very well some American intelligence agencies like the NSA. Do these intelligence agencies serve the US\\' interests or, rather, the oligarchy\\'s interests?\\nThe CIA has always served the interests of Wall Street. NSA now serves the interests of the global security network it leads.\\nYou were an officer in the US Navy. Was the whistleblower you are today born after your military career or before?\\nBefore. I was an FBI-Navy whistleblower in 1982 and helped to uncover a major pedophile ring in the US Navy that reached into the Reagan-Bush White House and was ultimately exposed in The Washington Times in 1988-89. My whistleblowing cost me my Navy career, however, and a subsequent series of fairly bad jobs.\\nIn the recent US election, we saw the mass media bankruptcy despite their manipulations and their fake polls. Didn\\'t one of the pillars of world oligarchy collapse under our eyes? Don\\'t we witness a historic moment announcing the end of the New World Order and its purely capitalist product, globalization?\\n99 percent of major newspapers endorsed Clinton. Many alternative news sources supported Trump. We are seeing a massive shift away from newspapers and corporate TV and websites to the alternative media, of which WayneMadsenReport.com has been prominent since its founding in 2005.\\nSnowden has denounced the Prism program and you have denounced Echelon, both of which serve the interests of the world\\'s oligarchic caste. What is known is not only the immersed part of the iceberg?\\nWhat is still relatively unknown is the close cooperation between NSA and private companies like Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook, and major telecommunications companies. It is much greater than even Snowden\\'s documents describe.\\nThe quantity and especially the quality of your reports reveal to us a world unknown by millions of human beings. How all these truths have been hidden?\\nThe major media cooperates with the government in covering up news events.\\nI advise everyone to read the Wayne Madsen Report as well as your books and follow your various interventions in the alternative media. How do you explain that we, who are resisting to what I call the fascist oligarchic caste, are called conspiracy theorists? Is this concept the only weapon of the fascist imperialists to reduce to silence all those who resist them and to reinforce the ranks of those whose who have been brainwashed?\\nThe term conspiracy theorist was developed by the CIA in the mid-1960s to ridicule those who believed there was a wide government role in the assassination of President Kennedy. It has been used ever since to describe legitimate researchers into Iran-Contra, 9/11, and other deep state crimes.\\nYour book \u201c The Star and The Sword \u201d is one of the few to talk about intimate and opaque links between the Zionist entity of Israel and Saudi Arabia. You claim that they organize false flag attacks, including the 9/11. What is the origin and nature of this Israeli-Saudi strategic alliance? Do you think that the JASTA law will succeed or will it be countered by the Zionist allies of Saudi Arabia? Do the fact that the USA and the Westerners turn a blind eye on the criminal war led by the Saudis to Yemen isn\\'t due to the weight of the lobby Zionist?\\nThe Zionist-Wahhabi/Saudi alliance goes back to Ibn Saud who wrote the British and Zionist leaders that he did not oppose a Jewish homeland in Palestine so long as it did not lay claim to Saudi territory on the eastern shore of the Gulf of Aqaba. The relationship has always been close, except for the time of King Faisal, who was conveniently shot in the face and killed by a relative.\\nDo you undergo pressure or threats in relation to the remarkable work you do? If so, how do you live it?\\nI was forced to move my domicile from Washington because the outgoing Obama administration put pressure on some media organizations I did work for. These included RT (contributor agreement canceled) and Al Jazeera America (which is now defunct).\\nThe FBI entered my apartment in Washington at least twice and I\\'ve had three visits by them at my new home in Florida.\\nI was informed of 3 personal threats in Washington.\\nI ignore all these pressures and continue to exercise the freedom of the press.\\nAre you optimistic or do you think that the Satanist project of the oligarchy still has a nuisance capacity that can plunge the world into chaos?\\nAs with cockroaches, which detest light, the shadow figures of covert power cannot stand what is known as the disinfectant of sunshine. Light has always fought against darkness and will continue to do so.\\nInterview realized by Mohsen Abdelmoumen\\nWho is Wayne Madsen?\\nWayne Madsen is an American journalist, television news commentator, online editor of Wayne Madsen Report.com , investigative journalist and author specializing intelligence and international affairs.
