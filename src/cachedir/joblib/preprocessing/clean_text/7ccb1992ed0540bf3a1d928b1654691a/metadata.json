Tillerson, the head of Exxon Mobil, appears to be the leading contender. \u25a0   Donald J. Trump\u2019s transition team is asking a lot of questions at the Energy Department. \u25a0 Mr. Trump will name Gary D. Cohn, the president of Goldman Sachs, to direct the National Economic Council. \u25a0 He could also name Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Republican of Washington, to be interior secretary. Rex W. Tillerson, the president and chief executive of Exxon Mobil, is the leading candidate to be Mr. Trump\u2019s secretary of state, according to a person with direct knowledge of the search process. Mr. Tillerson went to Trump Tower in New York on Tuesday to meet with Mr. Trump, who is said to be close to making a decision. Mr. Tillerson has been strongly recommended by a number of business leaders. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, has been described by Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers as still in the running. But Mr. Trump has said conflicting things privately about his views of Mr. Romney, advisers said, and has indicated to several people that he is unlikely to be named.   Trump\u2019s transition team has circulated an unusual   questionnaire that requests the names of all employees and contractors who have attended domestic or international climate change policy conferences, as well as emails associated with the conferences. The questionnaire appears targeted at climate science research and clean energy programs. Energy Department employees, who shared the questionnaire with The New York Times and spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, described the questionnaire as unprecedented and worrying. \u201cThese questions don\u2019t just indicate an attack on civil servants here in Washington,\u201d said an Energy Department employee. \u201cThey amount to a witch hunt in D. O. E. \u2019s 17 national labs, where scientists have the independence to do their work  \u2014   yet here are questions that are reminiscent of an inquisition rather than actual curiosity about how the labs work. \u201d The questionnaire asks for lists of employees involved in key climate change programs, including all those who have attended United Nations climate change conferences. It also asks for lists of employees involved in designing a metric known as the Social Cost of Carbon, a figure used by the Obama administration to measure the economic impact of carbon dioxide pollution, and to justify the economic cost of climate regulations. It specifically asks which Energy Department programs are essential to meeting the goals of President Obama\u2019s climate change agenda, which Mr. Trump has vowed to roll back. It includes several questions for the Energy Information Administration, the department\u2019s statistics office, which also measures the nation\u2019s carbon dioxide pollution, asking for justification of its numbers. \u201cIn the Annual Energy Outlook 2016, E. I. A. assumed that the Clean Power Plan should be in the reference case despite the fact that the reference case is based on existing laws and regulations,\u201d the questionnaire reads. \u201cWhy did the E. I. A. make that assumption, which seems to be atypical of past forecasts?\u201d And it includes several questions focused on the national scientific laboratories, including queries on highest salaries, and outside evaluation of research. Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most loyal allies, is no longer in the running for secretary of state, after removing his name from contention on Nov. 29, according to a statement from the transition. \u201cRudy Giuliani is an extraordinarily talented and patriotic American,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the statement. \u201cI will always be appreciative of his   dedication to our campaign after I won the primaries and for his extremely wise counsel. He is and continues to be a close personal friend, and as appropriate, I will call upon him for advice and can see an important place for him in the administration at a later date. \u201d Mr. Giuliani, a former mayor of New York, will remain on the transition team. \u201cThis is not about me it is about what is best for the country and the new administration,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said. \u201cBefore I joined the campaign I was very involved and fulfilled by my work with my law firm and consulting firm, and I will continue that work with even more enthusiasm. From the vantage point of the private sector, I look forward to helping the   in any way he deems necessary and appropriate. \u201d The statement came as Mr. Giuliani\u2019s prospects had dimmed for the State Department post, apparently the only one he wanted. He had been offered the job of attorney general and secretary of homeland security, but had no interest, according to a person briefed on the discussions. Some in Mr. Trump\u2019s circle were concerned about the potential for a messy confirmation hearing over Mr. Giuliani\u2019s tangle of foreign business ties and paid speeches. Encouraged by the  \u2019s possible   on deporting young undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children, two senators have crafted a bipartisan bill to help protect them. Known as the Bridge Act, the bill, sponsored by Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, and Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, is intended to protect roughly 800, 000 young illegal immigrants from deportation should Mr. Trump make good on his campaign promise to end the protections issued by President Obama through an executive order. The Obama program, called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, granted deportation protection and work permits for two years to immigrants brought to the country as minors who have passed criminal background checks. The   measure, which also has at least one   from each party, would give current recipients a reprieve even if Mr. Trump undoes the order, and allow new applicants to apply. Mr. Trump, who has included the   Dreamers in his broader deportation plan, appeared to back down in an interview published in Time magazine this week when he said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to work something out that\u2019s going to make people happy and proud. \u201d Mr. Cohn, president of the Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs, is expected to be named director of Mr. Trump\u2019s National Economic Council, joining the Treasury secretary pick Steven Mnuchin as Goldman voices on the economic team. Mr. Trump used Wall Street and \u201cthe global elites\u201d as constant foils during the campaign, featuring Goldman\u2019s chief executive and chairman, Lloyd Blankfein, in his dark closing argument. Since his victory, however, Mr. Trump has tapped Mr. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs partner, for Treasury secretary the billionaire investor Wilbur Ross to be his commerce secretary Todd Ricketts, heir to the Ameritrade fortune, to be deputy commerce secretary and now Mr. Cohn. The National Economic Council was created by President Bill Clinton  \u2014   another frequent foil of Mr. Trump\u2019s  \u2014   to show that domestic policy would be equal to foreign policy. Like the older National Security Council, the N. E. C. coordinates the policies of the Treasury, labor and commerce departments, as well as other agencies like the Small Business Administration and the Council of Economic Advisers. And because Mr. Cohn will sit in the White House complex, he is likely to be extremely influential on Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohn is also a big contributor to federal campaigns on both sides of the aisle, including tens of thousands of dollars to Democrats and Democratic campaign committees. Adding Mr. Cohn to the economic team was a favorite idea of Mr. Trump\u2019s    Jared Kushner. And he does not break the streak of wealthy Trump teammates. Mr. Cohn\u2019s most recent total compensation package made public at Goldman exceeded $20. 5 million. Goldman Sachs shares, by the way, are up 33 percent since Election Day. Ms. McMorris Rodgers, the   woman in the House Republican leadership, is expected to be announced as Mr. Trump\u2019s secretary of the interior as early as Friday, two people close to the transition efforts said. Ms. McMorris Rodgers comes from Washington, a state with large federal land reserves, and she was also critical of Mr. Trump at various points during the presidential campaign. Aides to Mr. Trump did not respond to requests for comment. In the last part of his winning run, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign amassed more money than Hillary Clinton\u2019s, according to records filed with the Federal Election Commission late Thursday. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign took in $70 million from Oct. 20 to Nov. 28, compared with $86 million for the Trump campaign, of which $10 million came from the candidate\u2019s own pocket. In terms of spending, Mrs. Clinton relied on the war chest she had built up during the course of the campaign to spend almost $131 million, compared with $94 million by Mr. Trump. Mrs. Clinton closed the period with under $1 million dollars in the bank, much less than the $7 million remaining for the Trump campaign. Mr. Trump may have tossed in a few million in the final weeks of his campaign, but he also took a few, soliciting donations from supporters, then reimbursing himself for rent and his airplane. From Oct. 20 to Nov. 28, the period covered by a postelection report filed with the F. E. C. the campaign paid nearly $3 million to properties owned by Mr. Trump, including rent to Trump Tower and event fees to other Trump hotels. The largest part went to Tag Air, the company that operates Mr. Trump\u2019s airplane. The new disclosures bring the total amount that Trump companies earned from his campaign to nearly $12 million. The campaign itself was hardly a moneymaker for Mr. Trump himself, though. The  \u2019s total cash contributions came in at more than $65 million, well short of the $100 million he had originally promised but likely more than his businesses earned off the venture. Linda McMahon, a pro wrestling impresario, put $1 million into Future45, a   \u201csuper PAC,\u201d in the final stages of the presidential campaign, taking her total contribution to the organization to $7 million. This week, Ms. McMahon  \u2014   who lost twice in recent years as a Republican candidate for the United States Senate in Connecticut  \u2014   was chosen by Mr. Trump to head the Small Business Administration. Peter Thiel, the Silicon Valley billionaire who took down Gawker, gave $1 million to Make America Number 1, an   \u201csuper PAC\u201d run by the Mercer family, hedge fund billionaires. He has not been named to a position by the transition team, but he has been mentioned as a possibility for the Supreme Court. And: But: But Mr. Trump did tell Time magazine he had done nothing to divide the country. The Trump inaugural committee offered details for the multiday party planned for Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, which in a departure from the norm will include a welcome rally. (The   does love his rallies.) The announcement: Not stated: A Million Women March is being organized for the day after with a different message  \u2014   though organizers did not get formal permits for the mall.'"}, "time": 1742563130.511705}
