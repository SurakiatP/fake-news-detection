Secretary General Complains That The \u2018Masses Have Rejected Globalism\u2019 In Favor Of Nationalism Antonio Guterres, elected in October to take over as U.N. secretary general next year, told a conference in his native Lisbon that this trend had undermined the willingness to receive refugees in Europe this year. He said the world must re-establish international protection for refugees coming from war zones such as Syria, but it would not be easy as developed countries were turning to nationalist agendas.   22, 2016 The incoming head of the United Nations warned on Tuesday that \u2018losers of globalization\u2019 in rich countries have felt ignored by establishment politicians, prompting them to turn to nationalist agendas, as in the U.S. election and Brexit referendum. \u201cTherefore wait ye upon me, saith the LORD, until the day that I rise up to the prey: for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.\u201d Zephaniah 3:8 (KJV) EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: The Bible clearly says that God\u2019s desire is to \u201cgather all the nations of the world together\u201d, in order to \u201cpour His fury\u201d upon them. The United Nations, something unique in world history, has been created by the will of God, and things are going to end exactly how the Bible says they will end. All Muslims will be driven out of Israel as prophesied in Zechariah 14:21 (KJV), Israel will expand its borders to cover the size of the original land grant to Abraham , and Jesus will rule the world from Jerusalem . And that will be the \u201cnew\u201d world order. Antonio Guterres, elected in October to take over as U.N. secretary general next year , told a conference in his native Lisbon that this trend had undermined the willingness to receive refugees in Europe this year. He said the world must re-establish international protection for refugees coming from war zones such as Syria, but it would not be easy as developed countries were turning to nationalist agendas. Antonio Guterres formally elected as UN chief: Europe has struggled to handle a huge influx of refugees, many of whom displaced by the war in Syria. The United States has accepted only a very small number of refugees and may take in even fewer next year. \u201cIn 2016, we have witnessed a dramatic deterioration of that international protection regime (for refugees),\u201d Guterres said. \u201cThis example started in the developed world, it started essentially in Europe, it is spreading now like a virus into other parts of the world.\u201d Guterres, who was U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees until last year, linked the growing resistance to accepting refugees to wider concerns about globalism. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can look strictly at the refugee issue, I think the problem is a broader problem,\u201d he told the conference on Europe\u2019s refugee crisis. There was a consensus in the mid-1990s that globalization would benefit all, he said. \u201cBut a lot of people were left behind \u2026 In the developed world, (there are) those who have been losers in globalization,\u201d he said. \u201cThe recent analysis of the rust belt in the United States, I think, is a clear demonstration of that, when we speak about the elections.\u201d Donald Trump won this month\u2019s election in the United States in part thanks to support from voters who have seen their jobs lost to countries with cheaper labor. \u201cSo globalization has not been as successful as we had hoped and lots of people became not only angry with it, but feeling that political establishments and international organizations are not paying attention, were not taking care (of them),\u201d he said. This led to what he called \u201ca kind of evolution\u201d in which anti-establishment parties now tended to win elections and referendums tended to attract majorities against whatever was put to a vote. source SHARE THIS ARTICLE  '"}, "time": 1742561638.1751742}
