He is a Hollywood elitist. \u201d The Money Monster star was referring to Streep\u2019s   acceptance speech at the Golden Globes in January, in which the actress bashed the president for what she called his \u201cdisrespect\u201d and his \u201cviolence. \u201d Clooney told Canal Plus that Streep had \u201cevery right to speak up. \u201d The actor also took aim at Bannon, whom he called a \u201cfailed film writer and director. \u201d The White House chief strategist has produced 16 films, including the documentaries The Undefeated and Torchbearer. \u201cHe wrote a Shakespearean rap musical about the L. A. riots that he couldn\u2019t get made,\u201d Clooney said. \u201cHe made a lot of money off of Seinfeld. He\u2019s elitist Hollywood, I mean that\u2019s the reality. \u201d Clooney was a heavy contributor to former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, and hosted a $33, 400   fundraiser for her last year at the Studio City home he shares with wife Amal Clooney. In a letter sent to donors on behalf of the candidate last year, Clooney called Trump a racist who \u201chates Muslims\u201d and who \u201cthinks that committing war crimes is the best way to make America great again. \u201d The actor also previously called Trump a \u201cxenophobic fascist. \u201d While attending the Cannes Film Festival in May, Clooney confidently told reporters that Trump would not win the election. \u201cThere\u2019s not going to be a President Donald Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cFear is not going to be something that drives our country. We\u2019re not going to be scared of Muslims or immigrants or women. We\u2019re not actually afraid of anything. We\u2019re not going to use fear. So that\u2019s not going to be an issue. \u201d The actor appeared to soften his position on Trump in January, when he told the Associated Press at the premiere of his Syrian relief worker documentary The White Helmets that he hopes the president will \u201cdo a decent job. \u201d But in his interview with Canal Plus this week, Clooney said it was still \u201chard to imagine\u201d that Trump is president. \u201cWe have a demagogue in the White House,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need the fourth estate, which is journalists, to hold his feet to the fire. \u201d   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum'"}, "time": 1742562513.445889}
