Located in East Jerusalem, it was occupied by Israel in 1967 and later annexed in a move never recognised by the international community.\\nAsked whether Trump viewed the West Bank as part of Israel, as many far-right Israelis do, Friedman did not answer directly.\\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he believes that the settlements are illegal,\u201d Friedman said.\\nMyself and . @realDonaldTrump senior #Israel advisor David Friedman at the #JerusalemForever event that was held tonight at the old city. pic.twitter.com/2JxEWRrk8o\\n\u2014 Israeli for Trump (@davidweissman3) October 26, 2016\\nIsraeli religious nationalists see the Palestinian territory as part of the country, citing Jews\u2019 connection to the land from biblical times.\\nThe US has intensified criticism of Israeli settlement building in the West Bank in recent months, warning that it is eating away at hopes for a two-state solution.\\nSettlements in the West Bank are viewed as illegal under international law and are major stumbling blocks to peace efforts because they are built on land seized in the 1967 war which Palestinians see as part of their future state.\\nAt an American Israel Public Affairs Committee conference in March, Trump described an \u201cunbreakable bond\u201d between the US and Israel.\\n\u201cWhen I become president, the days of treating Israel like a second-class citizen will end on day one,\u201d Trump told delegates, in a speech that heaped praise on Israel and derided Palestinians as perpetrators of violence.\\nRecalling rounds of failed peace talks between the two parties, Trump blamed Palestinian leaders.\\n\u201cTo make a great deal, you need two willing participants,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe know Israel is willing to deal.
