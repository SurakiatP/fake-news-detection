Saliers and Ray said they reached out to Browne and the other musicians on the album, then contacted Warren to inform him of the growing boycott.

(@democracynow) November 4, 2016 \\nRay read from the letter to Warren on Democracy Now!: \u201cSadly, we realized that the bucolic setting of your festival and the image it projects is in direct conflict with the proposed Dakota Access pipeline, a project your company, Energy Transfer Partners, is responsible for spearheading. This pipeline violates the Standing Rock Sioux nation\u2019s treaty rights, endangers the vital Missouri River, and continues the trajectory of genocide against Native peoples.\u201d \\nIn a statement published by Indian Country Today Media Network , Browne vowed to donate all the profits from the Music Road tribute album to the Standing Rock \u201c water protectors .\u201d Like Saliers and Ray, Browne said he\u2019d been unaware of Warren\u2019s involvement in the pipeline when he met him and agreed to have Music Road produce the album. He continued: \u201cI do not play for oil interests. I do not play for companies who defile nature, or companies who attack demonstrators with trained attack dogs and pepper spray. The list of companies I have denied the use of my music is long. I certainly would not have allowed my songs to be recorded by a record company whose owner\u2019s other business does what Energy Transfer Partners is allegedly doing \u2014 threatening the water supply and the sacred sites of indigenous people.\u201d \\nAmy Goodman noted in a Nov. 3 editorial co-written with Denis Moynihan that, \u201cKelcy Warren is a Texas oil billionaire several times over, and might not be easily deterred by a threatened boycott.\u201d \\nThe notion that Warren may not be moved by a boycott isn\u2019t stopping music fans from taking up the cause. A group of activists and fans from Denton, Texas, are asking musician Hal Ketchum to end his association with Music Road, and they\u2019re planning to protest his concert there on Wednesday night. \\nIn addition to dabbling in the music industry, Warren and Energy Transfer Partners also spend millions influencing U.S. elections . Energy Transfer Partners PAC spent over $869,000 in the 2014 and 2016 federal election cycles, according to OpenSecrets , a project of the Center for Responsive Politics. \\nAndrew Wheat, research director at Texans for Public Justice , an Austin-based nonprofit that tracks the influence of money and corporate power, told MintPress News that Warren, himself, has spent far more influencing elections on the state level. He was awarded a position on the board of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission, likely due to his largesse.'"}, "time": 1742563186.8027468}
