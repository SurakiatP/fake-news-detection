No, it wasn\u2019t Ross Perot, and it wasn\u2019t Donald Trump. It was Barack Obama, the same man the White House press corps hailed as the smartest man to ever sit in the Oval Office. [The political bias of the establishment media has never been more outrageous than what we see in the press\u2019s double standard for covering President Donald Trump. For contrasts that will make your head spin and your heart ache, compare Trump\u2019s treatment to the press\u2019s idolatrous treatment of President Obama.  The media\u2019s   attitude toward Obama was unprecedented in the modern era. Not even handsome Jack Kennedy or war hero Eisenhower got the   treatment that Obama got. Obama\u2019s frequent goofy statements and embarrassing gaffes were either overlooked entirely or treated as amusing sidebars. Will any historian ever catalog Obama\u2019s frequent misstatements of elementary facts? How many do you remember? Here are few of the gems liberal historians will overlook: Such historical ignorance and efforts at personal   were routine for Obama  \u2014    and never challenged by the working press. Obama\u2019s hilarious mispronunciations and stupid asides were a regular feature of his speeches and interviews, at home and abroad. And yet, they did not tarnish his reputation in the White House press corps as a great intellectual and \u201cperhaps the smartest man to ever sit in the Oval office. \u201d Oh, really? Now, compare the worshipful treatment of Obama to what Trump has experienced since winning the election on November 8. The establishment press won\u2019t even accept the legitimacy of Trump\u2019s election, much less the strong points of his policy initiatives. They won\u2019t let go of the popular vote versus the Electoral College. That is not ignorance of Civics 101 it is part of a political strategy to demonize and delegitimize the entire Trump program. The media has openly joined the campaign by the Democratic Party and the \u201cSocial Justice\u201d left to deny that President Trump has any policy mandates whatsoever. The narrative is this: since his presidency is illegitimate to begin with, it is okay to use violence to obstruct him at every point. Trump is justified and very smart to communicate with the American people directly and not expect the media to convey his messages fairly. Too many of them have become angry partisans in the left\u2019s demonization strategy, and they need to be  . Conservatives and constitutionalists have seen media bias for half a century, and America has survived it. Yet, never has that bias and that vituperation been so uniform and vicious as what we see waged against President Trump. When it is coordinated with the   cultural bias in the entertainment and educational institutions, a triad of treachery emerges to challenge the very foundations of civic order.'"}, "time": 1742628362.0018384}
