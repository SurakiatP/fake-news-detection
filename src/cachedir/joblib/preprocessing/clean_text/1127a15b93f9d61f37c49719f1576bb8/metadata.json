S. citizens, despite a law change which limited the practice, according to a report. [\u201cThe report from the office of Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats was the first measure of the effects of the 2015 USA Freedom Act, which limited the NSA to collecting phone records and contacts of people U. S. and allied intelligence agencies suspect may have ties to terrorism,\u201d reported Reuters on Tuesday. \u201cIt found that the NSA collected the 151 million records even though it had warrants from the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance court to spy on only 42 terrorism suspects in 2016, in addition to a handful identified the previous year. \u201d  \u201cThe NSA has been gathering a vast quantity of telephone \u2018metadata,\u2019 records of callers\u2019 and recipients\u2019 phone numbers and the times and durations of the calls  \u2014   but not their content  \u2014   since the September 11, 2001, attacks\u201d they continued, adding that \u201cOn Friday, the NSA said it had stopped a form of surveillance that allowed it to collect the digital communications of Americans who mentioned a foreign intelligence target in their messages without a warrant. \u201d In April, a report published by the Intercept revealed that the NSA had spied on civilians using blimp in Maryland. \u201cBack in 2004, a division of the NSA called the National Tactical Integration Office fitted a   diameter airship called the Hover Hammer with an eavesdropping device,\u201d reported the Intercept, adding that \u201cThe agency launched the   airship at an airfield near Solomons Island, Maryland. \u201d \u201cUnsurprisingly, privacy groups have expressed concerns about the prospect of the blimps being used domestically to spy on Americans. However, military officials have often been quick to dismiss such fears,\u201d they continued. \u201cIn August 2015, Lt. Shane Glass told Baltimore broadcaster WBAL that the JLENS blimps being tested in Maryland were not equipped with cameras or eavesdropping devices. The same cannot be said, it seems, of the NSA\u2019s Hover Hammer. \u201d Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
