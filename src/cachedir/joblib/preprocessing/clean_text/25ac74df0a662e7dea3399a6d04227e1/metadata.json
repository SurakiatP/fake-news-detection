A primer on its role in CETA\u2019s crisis\u201d [ Globe and Mail ]. \u201d [Walloon Premier Paul Magnette\u2019s] Socialist Party is under growing political pressure within Wallonia, an economically depressed rust-belt region. The Marxist party has been steadily gaining ground in recent polls, pushing the Socialists further to the left on issues such as trade.\u201d There needs to be a left equivalent for \u201cAlways Be Closing.\u201d \\nCETA: \u201cCETA has bigger problems than not-so-\u2018tiny\u2019-after-all Wallonia\u201d [ Rabble. ca ]. \u201c[B]y EU standards it is not all that small. Wallonia\u2019s population is 3.5 million, almost a third of the Belgian total of somewhat more than 11 million. There are seven EU countries with smaller populations. Each of the EU\u2019s 28 member states has veto power over CETA. That is how the EU works \u2013 on the Three Musketeers principle, one for all and all for one. If one or more of the smaller member states, such as Slovenia or Estonia, or one of the tiny island states with far fewer than a million people, Cyprus or Malta, vetoed the deal, would we be calling them tiny and insignificant?\u201d \\nCETA: \u201cCorporate Sovereignty Helps To Bring EU-Canada Trade Deal To Brink Of Collapse\u201d [ TechDirt ]. This looks like what\u2019s on offer to Wallonia: \\nThe fact that CETA\u2019s ISDS/ICS remains the most problematic area can be seen from a fascinating CETA document (pdf) that was recently leaked. It\u2019s called the \u201cJoint Interpretative Declaration on the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between Canada and the European Union and its Member States,\u201d and is an attempt to offer additional guarantees that are enough to convince Magnette and other CETA skeptics to allow its signing and ratification: \\nThis interpretative declaration aims to provide a clear and unambiguous statement of what Canada and the European Union and its Member States agreed in a number of CETA provisions that have been the object of public debate and concerns. This includes, in particular, the impact of CETA on the ability of governments to regulate in the public interest, as well as the provisions on investment protection and dispute resolution, and on sustainable development, labour rights and environmental protection. \\nThe section on Investment Protection is by far the longest, reflecting the seriousness of the problems there. Here\u2019s a key paragraph: CETA clarifies that governments may change their laws, regardless of whether this may negatively affect an investment or investor\u2019s expectations of profits. Furthermore, CETA clarifies that any compensation due to an investor will be based on an objective determination by the Tribunal and will not be greater than the loss suffered by the investor. \\nAs that demonstrates, there is nothing new in the declaration. Nobody is claiming that CETA will stop governments changing their laws, just that the massive fines that can be imposed by supra-national tribunals are likely to discourage them from doing so. Similarly, claiming that those fines will be \u201cbased on an objective determination by the Tribunal and will not be greater than the loss suffered by the investor\u201d simply confirms the untrammelled power of the tribunal to impose whatever fine it thinks is appropriate. \\nLipstick on a pig. \\nTPP: \u201cIf the trade deal comes up during the lame-duck session this fall, the two [Vice Presidents] could play leading roles on opposite sides of the debate: Kaine as a potentially significant \u201cno\u201d vote should the pact come up for a vote while he\u2019s still in the Senate, and Biden as President Barack Obama\u2019s go-to guy for shoring up Senate support and casting the tie-breaking vote if need be\u201d [ Politico ]. \\nTPP: \u201cThe TPP \u2018provides no guarantee of equal rights and remedies to migrants for labor violations, no regional task force or other solution to address region-wide trafficking issue and no region-wide restrictions on abusive behaviors by recruiters who prey on desperate workers simply trying to feed their families,\u2019 Celeste Drake, the AFL-CIO\u2019s trade and globalization specialist, said during a call with reporters. While the broader deal does not contain migrant worker protections advocated by the labor group, Malaysia is obligated through a separate \u2018consistency plan\u2019 to undertake certain reforms for protecting migrant workers\u201d [Politico]. Weak-ass framing from the AFL-CIO (no surprise here) and terrible reporting from Politico (ditto). The issue with Malaysia is not \u201ccertain reforms to protect migrant workers,\u201d and not even \u201ctrafficking.\u201d The issue is slavery , which Obama is enabling in order to get the deal passed. Use the word! \\nTPP: \u201cAustralia could face a growing number of expensive legal claims from foreign corporations if the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) comes into force, a new report has warned\u201d [ Guardian ]. \u201cDr Kyla Tienhaara, from the Australian National University, said Australia ought to learn from Canada\u2019s experience after it signed the North America Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which came into force in 1994 and led to dozens of legal cases against Canada by US corporations [under ISDS].\u201d \\n\u201cSelected Government Statements and Actions Against Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS)\u201d (PDF) [ Public Citizen ]. Lots of good quotes (the US is at the end) for you to use when you write your Congresscritter. \\n2016 \\nDays until: 12. That\u2019s less than two weeks! \\nCorruption \\n\u201d But Trump\u2019s biggest local political donation [in Chicago] was the $50,000 he donated to Emanuel\u2019s first mayoral campaign\u201d [ Chicago Reader (DG)]. \u201cThat donation came on December 23, 2010, a couple months before Rahm was elected. In 2011, Emanuel\u2019s administration approved the god-awful 20-foot-high \u201cT-R-U-M-P\u201d sign that the Donald felt compelled to plaster on his building overlooking the Chicago River. But Mayor Emanuel\u2019s not Trump\u2019s only Democratic pal in town. Trump also hired Alderman Burke\u2019s law firm to handle his tax appeals to Assessor Berrios\u2019s office. Burke then won Trump several million dollars worth of property tax breaks.\u201d There don\u2019t seem to be many degrees of separation between the elites. I suppose that\u2019s why they\u2019re elites\u2026 \\nPolicy \\n\u201d A hotelier\u2019s guide to the 2016 presidential election\u201d [ Hotel News Now ]. \u201cMany hotels in the U.S. rely on a flow of legal immigrants to fill a variety of positions. Hoteliers want that pipeline of potential employees to remain open, while avoiding additional red tape to verify their statuses.\u201d \\n\u201cBattlegrounds: The Fight for Mosul and Election Day Disruptions\u201d (podcast) [ Foreign Policy Editor\u2019s Roundtable ]. If you want to get a good reading on the insanity that is The Blob , this is the podcast for you. The speakers spend a good twenty minutes discussing the details of Syria and Iraq, concluding that historians will look back on it as \u201ca forty year\u2019s war,\u201d without ever once giving a reason for us to be there . Soothing NPR voices, no anger, a lot of laughter. Smart people. \\nWar Drums \\n\u201cHillary Clinton Promises A More Muscular Foreign Policy As President\u201d [ HuffPo ]. \u201cAs secretary of state, Clinton was an early supporter of arming and training members of the Syrian opposition to fight Assad, a plan that faced resistance out of concern that it would be difficult to appropriately vet fighters and ensure that weapons didn\u2019t fall into the hands of extremists. Today, the program is off to a slow start, with only 54 graduates from the first class, several of whom scattered after coming under attack by an al Qaeda affiliate in Syria. As commander-in-chief, Clinton would dramatically escalate the program, she said. \u201d Who was in charge of the training program? Ira Magaziner? \\nThe Voters \\n\u201cWhat Do Trump and Marx Have in Common?\u201d [Jochen Bittner, New York Times ]. This is another piece along the lines of the article from the Manhattan Institute\u2019s City Journal that Yves linked to this morning, although it\u2019s not a piece of outright hackery. For example: \u201cWhen Hillary Clinton calls half of Mr. Trump\u2019s voters a \u2018basket of deplorables,\u2019 she sounds as aloof as Marie Antoinette, telling French subjects who had no bread to \u2018eat cake.'\u201d But both articles deploy the \u201cangry populists of left and right\u201d vs. the \u201csensible center\u201d trope (remember that in the Beltway you should never display anger; it\u2019s a strong taboo). Bittner concludes: \u201cMrs. Clinton has the chance to change, by leading a political establishment that examines and processes anger instead of merely producing and dismissing it.\u201d Obama destroyed hope by not delivering change. And now Clinton is holding the bag for the anger that caused. From the Department of Schadenfreude\u2026 \\nDownballot \\n= \\nThe Trail \\n\u201cBut academic research has picked up something that thousands of hours of campaign punditry has missed completely: Donald Trump talks like a woman\u201d [ Politico ]. \u201cDonald Trump is a stunning outlier. His linguistic style is startlingly feminine, so much so that the chasm between Trump and the next most feminine speaker, Ben Carson, is about as great as the difference between Carson and the least feminine candidate, Jim Webb. And Trump earns his ranking not just because he talks a lot about himself or avoids big words (both of which are true); according to Jones, he also shows feminine patterns on the more subtle measures, such as his use of prepositions and articles. The key then is not what Trump talks about\u2014making Mexico pay for the wall or bombing the hell out of ISIL\u2014but rather how he says it.\u201d Readers? \\nWell, well: \\n&mdash; Bugei Nyaosi (@bnyaosi) October 25, 2016 \\nRealignment \\n\u201cThis party was dead before Lincoln got here\u201d [ USA Today ]. \u201cPity the poor Republican Party, which has been on its deathbed since the age of 2.

But: \u201cData from the monthly NAHB survey has continued to suggest that there are shortages of available lots and labour shortages have also been an increasingly important feature in recent surveys.

Modest increases in traffic in Europe were offset by a sharp decline in the United Arab Emirates, where the company is based\u201d [ Wall Street Journal ]. \u201cDP World operates marine terminals on six continents, insulating it from economic slowdowns in individual countries or whole regions.
