Voters in Berlin turned out in higher numbers than in previous years, many responding to voter mobilization calls from the   Alternative for Germany party. The party is now poised to enter the  \u2019s legislature for the first time, although its share of the vote, 14. 2 percent in the preliminary results, was less than what it was two weeks ago in Ms. Merkel\u2019s home state,   where it placed second. Ms. Merkel\u2019s party won 17. 6 percent of the vote in Berlin, not enough to allow it to continue as the junior partner in a governing coalition with the Social Democrats. The   Social Democratic Party earned 21. 6 percent of the vote and is expected to form a government with two other parties: the Left Party, with 15. 6 percent, and the Greens, with 15. 2. \u201cWe are all angry that the AfD got in,\u201d Michael M\u00fcller, Berlin\u2019s mayor and the Social Democrats\u2019 leading candidate, told cheering supporters in the capital, referring to the Alternative for Germany party. \u201cBut I can assure you that Berlin will remain an international city, open to the world. \u201d The result proved that the Alternative for Germany party is not as popular in Berlin as it is elsewhere, but it managed to draw considerable support, mostly from the city\u2019s eastern districts. It campaigned hard against the chancellor\u2019s decision last year to allow more than one million migrants into the country. Berlin is the 10th state in which the party has earned representation, and with little more than a year to go before the 2017 general election, the party appears to be gaining enough strength to earn seats in the national Parliament. Some commentators viewed the result as a chance for a rebirth of Germany\u2019s struggling traditional parties and its overall democracy. \u201cThe success of the Alternative for Germany is a   call that it can\u2019t be taken for granted that society is liberal and will remain so,\u201d Heribert Prantl, a journalist at the newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, wrote in a commentary. \u201cNor can it be taken for granted that minorities (and not only the refugees) are and will be respected. \u201d Many former supporters of the chancellor\u2019s party drifted to the liberal Free Democratic Party, which voters returned to the state legislature with about 6 percent of the vote after it was ousted in the 2011 election. But the upstart Pirate Party, which won seats in the state Parliament in 2011, was voted out. Ms. Merkel, who governs on the national level in a coalition with the Social Democrats, had blamed Mr. M\u00fcller, the   mayor, for refusing to be held accountable for the chaotic circumstances faced by the 79, 000 refugees who arrived last year in the capital. \u201cBased on my own experience, I know that leaders of government are always responsible, and they will be made responsible,\u201d the chancellor said in an interview with the Berlin newspaper Tagesspiegel before the vote. Yet many in Ms. Merkel\u2019s own conservative bloc have criticized her for allowing the refugee influx to become a crisis. Horst Seehofer, the leader of a Bavarian sister party to Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservatives, has been among her loudest critics. In an interview released Friday, Mr. Seehofer threatened to withhold his party\u2019s support for her in the 2017 election unless she agreed to set a limit on the number of new refugees to be admitted. Frank Henkel, the leading candidate for Ms. Merkel\u2019s party in Berlin, blamed squabbling for the party\u2019s poor showing in Berlin, saying the infighting had alienated voters and led them to question the bloc\u2019s ability to govern.'"}, "time": 1742628475.3875272}
