I mean the Democratic Party has not been in this bad shape since the 1920\u2019s and a huge uprising at the grassroots, mostly against Trump. How can Tom Perez, can he actually utilize that, turn the Democratic Party from a vast   machine into a movement?\u201d \u201cHasn\u2019t been done before very easily. you remember in the Vietnam war days, we had a huge uprising. but the Democratic Party had nothing to do with that. The thing that worries me most of all, if you look at the problems inside the Democratic Party, they have a lot to do with the same sort of populist uprising we\u2019re seeing across the country, including the Donald Trump campaign. \u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN'"}, "time": 1742563795.8007147}
