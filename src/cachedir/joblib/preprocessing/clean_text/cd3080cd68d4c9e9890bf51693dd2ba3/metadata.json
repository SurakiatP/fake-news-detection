Gazing at a monitor, this host of \u201cThe Late Show\u201d on CBS was rapidly reading through dozens of jokes that his writers had been composing throughout the first presidential debate between Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton. The goal: to trim     minutes from a monologue Mr. Colbert would be performing live in less than an hour. In phrases that may have sounded like requests but were really demands, Mr. Colbert called out to his team of producers: Could he get a video package of all the times Mr. Trump said \u201cwrong\u201d? Could they cut the word \u201cterror\u201d from the phrase \u201cpanic and   terror\u201d? Could they shelve a   joke about \u201cInterrupting Donald Trump\u201d for another night? There was no time to   Mr. Colbert. \u201cUnless there\u2019s a clean hit they think is undeniable, the playground is closed,\u201d he announced to the room at 10:48 p. m. Mr. Colbert and his colleagues were hoping to capitalize on the debate\u2019s colossal viewership and help reverse the fortunes of \u201cThe Late Show,\u201d which after a year on the air still trails Jimmy Fallon\u2019s \u201cTonight Show\u201d on NBC and has sometimes finished third behind ABC\u2019s \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d The \u201cLate Show\u201d team was also trying to sustain the momentum from its live episodes during the Republican and Democratic National Conventions in July. In those two weeks, Mr. Colbert and his program showed a nimbleness and bite that he often exhibited on Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cThe Colbert Report\u201d  \u2014   an improvement on his lumbering, uncertain first months on \u201cThe Late Show. \u201d Among other course corrections, Mr. Colbert has brought in a dedicated showrunner and he has addressed a longstanding identity crisis by reconciling with his   conservative   character from \u201cThe Colbert Report,\u201d a version of whom he has dusted off and resumed playing. Now he has to imbue \u201cThe Late Show,\u201d on any other night of the week when the future of the Republic is not hanging in the balance, with the same sense of immediacy that has propelled him in his live broadcasts. And he must still find the harmony between his trademark brand of pointed political commentary and the broader demands of a mainstream   talk show. When he started at CBS, Mr. Colbert said in an interview last week: \u201cPeople were watching me learn to play a new instrument in public. Now I really don\u2019t care and it\u2019s so much more fun. \u201cIf I do things that are like the old show,\u201d he continued, \u201cit was a good show. \u201d Yet the   host is capable of doing something his famously arrogant alter ego never would: admit mistakes. He believes he has identified what he did wrong: cutting himself off from the persona, tone and formats that he established on Comedy Central, for fear that they would overshadow the authentic self that he wanted his CBS viewers to see. As Mr. Colbert said, riffing on a favorite Elvis Costello lyric, \u201cI tried so hard to be myself that I kept on fading away. \u201d His realization is that he can embrace elements of \u201cThe Colbert Report\u201d and still be himself. \u201cIt is all me,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course it\u2019s me. I thought of the character. It\u2019s my humor. \u201d He remains a highly   host, to judge from a Monday evening rehearsal at the Ed Sullivan Theater. As he ran through monologue jokes while bobbing back and forth on a   scooter, Mr. Colbert asked for    changes to graphics of Gennifer Flowers and the debate stage, and called out his bandleader, Jon Batiste, for    munching on veggie chips at his piano. (\u201cIs there a glacier toppling into the Arctic Ocean?\u201d Mr. Colbert asked.) Any time Mr. Colbert hit a line he wasn\u2019t fond of, he would call out to the writers and producers in the theater, \u201cLet\u2019s beat that. \u201d If, a year ago, the assumption was that Mr. Colbert would simply glide into the time slot and theater last occupied by David Letterman and dominate the   landscape, that did not happen. For months, his \u201cLate Show\u201d never shook off its   jitters, nor established a breakout recurring comedy bit. Though his ratings saw a small spike, to about 2. 5 million viewers a night during the live convention episodes, they generally lag well below \u201cThe Tonight Show,\u201d the category leader, which averages more than 3. 6 million. (According to preliminary ratings information on Tuesday, the   \u201cLate Show\u201d was Mr. Colbert\u2019s strongest performance with      viewers since   and tied \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d in overnight metered markets.) Mr. Colbert acknowledged in the interview that he had taken on too much. Was it  \u2014   \u201cHubris?\u201d Mr. Colbert said before the question was finished. \u201cYeah. A little bit. You think you know what you\u2019re doing, until you do something different. \u201d In April, \u201cThe Late Show\u201d brought in Chris Licht, an executive producer of \u201cCBS This Morning,\u201d as a showrunner, a role that did not exist at that program. As Mr. Licht explained in an interview, his principal task is to \u201csystematically remove things from Stephen\u2019s plate. \u201d \u201cAnything that doesn\u2019t involve him thinking creatively and enjoying his performance  \u2014   anything that gets in the way of that, I take,\u201d he added. Mr. Licht has a vision, too, for \u201cThe Late Show\u201d to stand out in a crowded field  \u2014   \u201cIt\u2019s us versus the Jimmys,\u201d he said  \u2014   and to make topical humor one of its defining features. \u201cThe Late Show\u201d will do two more live episodes on Oct. 4 and Oct. 19, following the   and third presidential debates. That path became a little clearer over the summer, when Mr. Colbert\u2019s postconvention episodes were lifted by comedy segments that went viral, like a sketch starring Laura Benanti as a pouting, plagiarizing Melania Trump and a blistering monologue from Jon Stewart, Mr. Colbert\u2019s former boss at \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d criticizing the Fox News host Sean Hannity. (Mr. Stewart is also an executive producer of \u201cThe Late Show. \u201d) Mr. Colbert revived his old \u201cStephen Colbert\u201d character, in a way (he says the original character is dead, and he is now playing that man\u2019s identical twin cousin) and added a recurring segment called \u201cWerd,\u201d which is awfully similar to \u201cThe Word,\u201d a segment on his previous show. (When asked what Comedy Central thought about him using material originally created for that network, Mr. Colbert said, \u201cI have been advised not to answer your question. \u201d He smiled and added, \u201cIt\u2019s funny \u2019cause it\u2019s true. \u201d Comedy Central declined to comment.) There is no certain formula for sustaining this adrenaline from night to night, but Mr. Colbert said the solution rested on his being his   self, by \u201cbeing gobsmacked by the news and walking out and going, \u2018Can you\u201d  \u2014   here he restrained himself from saying a naughty word  \u2014   \u201cbelieve what this person just said? \u2019\u201d At a time when Mr. Fallon has been widely criticized for his chummy treatment of Mr. Trump, Mr. Colbert\u2019s unvarnished political perspective could prove crucial in distinguishing himself from his network competitors. Without commenting directly on Mr. Fallon\u2019s program, Mr. Colbert said, \u201cI\u2019ve surrendered to my natural instincts, and to how I actually feel on a daily basis. \u201d Besides, Mr. Colbert felt sufficiently regretful about his own interview with Mr. Trump, at the start of his tenure on \u201cThe Late Show\u201d in September 2015. \u201cI tried being gracious and pointed at the same time, and got almost nothing out of him,\u201d Mr. Colbert said. \u201cIt was actually boring, because he wouldn\u2019t even look me in the eye. Being nice to a guy who isn\u2019t nice to other people, it doesn\u2019t serve you that much. \u201d Mr. Licht said that topical comedy should be the \u201cbread and butter\u201d of \u201cThe Late Show. \u201d But growing its audience means the show must reach beyond the   crowd that already tunes in for Mr. Colbert\u2019s political satire, and that remains a work in progress. \u201cYou have to be as funny, as relevant and as entertaining on a night when there\u2019s no news, as when you\u2019re in the middle of the biggest story of the day,\u201d Mr. Licht said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re striving for. \u201d What Mr. Colbert said he had learned from his live shows is not to be precious about his material, and to favor timely responses instead of stale, overthought takes. \u201cLeave nothing on the table,\u201d he said. \u201cTalk about it immediately. If it happens at 5 o\u2019clock and the show tapes at 5:30, we will have it on the show. \u201d Mr. Colbert\u2019s opening monologue on Monday was mostly cleansed of the jokes in the rehearsal, replaced with bits about Mr. Trump\u2019s persistent sniffles and his frequent invocations of \u201claw and order\u201d and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s state of readiness. (\u201cMy new nickname for her is Preparation H,\u201d Mr. Colbert said. \u201cIt\u2019s a compliment. \u201d) There was only one other topical comedy segment, a prepared sketch in which Mr. Colbert interviewed Rob Lowe, who played the character of an undecided voter. Still, Mr. Colbert indicated that he had learned some lessons about being open to future possibilities. As he said, only   about his approach to this broadcast, \u201cI will do anything as long as I have enough time to read it through once. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562049.7987568}
