[The organisers of the Unite Against Hate march, set to take place in Manchester on Sunday, say they organised the event to \u201chonour the victims of hate\u201d including the 49 people who lost their lives at Pulse, a gay club in Orlando, Florida, at the hands of an Islamic terrorist on June 12, 2016.  Planned speakers include author Shazia Hobbs, a Glaswegian who was forced into an arranged marriage at 18 with a man who beat her, believing it was his right under Sharia law Mohammed Fiaz, a Christian convert from Islam and founder and former leader of the English Defence League Tommy Robinson. But LGBT activists have reacted with fury, insisting the event is nothing more than the cynical hijacking of gay rights by the \u201cfar right\u201d as a cover for Islamophobia. Two groups, Lesbians and Gays Support the Migrants, and Action for Trans Health, are arranging a   against the march. \u201cWe\u2019re protesting because the   want to use Orlando and the recent killings in the UK to demonise all Muslims,\u201d one of the organisers of the   Anna, told Pink News. \u201cWe are clear that it is genocidal to consider millions of people responsible for the actions of a few violent men. \u201cAs queers, we know what it\u2019s like for   to hate us  \u2014   so we won\u2019t be divided like this. \u201d One of the organisers of the Unite Against Hate march is Tommy English, a fellow traveller of Tommy Robinson\u2019s and former leader of the English Defence League\u2019s LGBT group who now runs Gays Against Sharia. Opponents have seized upon his presence to claim the march is nothing but a front for   Islamophobes. Pink News quotes Sam Bjorn as saying: \u201cAs LGBT+ people we won\u2019t stand idly by as far right bigots like the EDL attempt to use our rights as a weapon against people from the Muslim community. \u201cWhen groups like the EDL are preying on tragedy like the recent attack in Manchester to promote hate and division, it\u2019s more important than ever to come together and say that we do not tolerate their Islamophobia and racism. \u201cWe encourage everyone, gay or straight, to join us on 11 June to show that the LGBT+ community and the people of Manchester won\u2019t let the hate of   bigots divide us. \u201d Pink News has joined in the condemnation, branding the event as a \u201cfake\u201d and accusing the organisers of \u201chijacking the first anniversary of the Pulse nightclub shooting with an   march,\u201d which it described as a \u201cdisturbing tactic\u201d. Veteran gay rights activist Peter Tatchell has also entered the fray, tweeting his opposition to the march.

Just a few weeks later Tatchell tweeted an appeal to help overturn the death penalty for homosexuality, which still exists in several countries.

In some cases, the laws apply only in regions of the country under Sharia law or are only applicable to Muslims.'"}, "time": 1742561947.3459227}
