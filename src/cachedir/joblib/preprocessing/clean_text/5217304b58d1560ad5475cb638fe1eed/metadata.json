As this New York Times map of the 2012 election shows, President Obama won all of those states in 2012. Obama also won roughly 2.6 million more votes than Hillary Clinton won in 2016. Donald Trump\u2019s narrow margin of victory in the Electoral College was only possible by winning all of the aforementioned rust belt states . \\nThere was hardly any enthusiasm behind Hillary Clinton when examining exit poll results. In an analysis of Reuters/Ipsos exit polling, Times writer Sarah Jaffe found several revealing trends showing why Clinton was a poor choice for the Democrats in terms of motivating voters to get to the polls and cast their ballots for their party\u2019s nominee: \\n75 percent of respondents agreed \u201cAmerica needs a strong leader to take the country back from the rich and powerful.\u201d Only slightly fewer agreed that \u201cthe American economy is rigged to advantage the rich and powerful,\u201d and \u2014 perhaps the kicker \u2014 68 percent believed that \u201ctraditional parties and politicians don\u2019t care about people like me.\u201d \\nThe numbers bear out that argument \u2014 Clinton\u2019s turnout was lower than Obama\u2019s turnout in both 2008 and 2012, even though she still won the popular vote this year. No matter how you slice it, Clinton wasn\u2019t enough of a draw to make the difference, particularly in key states like Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin \u2014 states Obama won in 2012. As the Washington Post reported, three traditionally blue states Trump won in 2016 that Obama won in 2012 \u2014 Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin \u2014 Clinton got between 5 and 15 percent fewer votes than Obama. \\nThe Democratic primaries were a harbinger of things to come in a general election matchup featuring Clinton and Trump. As US Uncut reported in March, Hillary Clinton\u2019s victories in the March 1 Super Tuesday primaries all depended on voter turnout numbers lower than 2008 figures \u2014 the last time there was a contested Democratic primary. In all seven states Clinton won that day, each state had turnout anywhere between 4 percent and 50 percent lower than in 2008 . \\nThe data makes the argument all by itself. No amount of scapegoating heaped on Jill Stein supporters can explain Hillary Clinton losing traditional Democratic strongholds that Obama won not only once, but twice . In Detroit, Michigan, for example, Hillary Clinton got roughly 120,000 fewer votes than President Obama in 2012. Those votes made the difference in securing Trump\u2019s victory, as Clinton lost Michigan by roughly half that number. \\nFormer Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell \u2014 one of the most senior officials within the Democratic Party apparatus \u2014 argued in a radio interview that even though Hillary Clinton was beloved by Democratic Party leadership, Bernie Sanders would have likely prevailed among the white, working-class rust belt constituency specifically due to his anti-establishment message. \\n\u201cIt would be interesting to think of how Bernie Sanders would\u2019ve done. Bernie Sanders would\u2019ve lost a few Republicans who voted for Hillary because of some of his economic views but he would\u2019ve fought Donald pretty hard for those disaffected, angry, and frustrated workers,\u201d Rendell said on 1210 WPHT in Philadelphia. \\nHad the Democratic Party nominated a candidate more attuned to the mood of voters in one of the most anti-establishment elections in generations, turnout could have been much higher, and America would have averted Trump\u2019s victory. \\n\\nZach Cartwright is an activist and author from Richmond, Virginia.
