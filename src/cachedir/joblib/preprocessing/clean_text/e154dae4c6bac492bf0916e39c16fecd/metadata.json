[Kate Hall, a junior at a Stonington High School, has spent several years typically coming in at the top in track competition. Until this year, that is. This year she has routinely lost that top spot because opposing Cromwell High accepted a boy claiming to be a transgender girl onto its track team.  Freshman Andraya Yearwood, 15, a biological male who identifies as a girl, received permission to join the Cromwell High girls track team after competing as a boy in middle school. Not surprisingly, Yearwood has been extremely successful as a male competing against females. Yearwood has thoroughly defeated every female opponent. According to the Hartford Courant, \u201cAndraya\u2019s times in the 100 and the 200 are fast. A year ago, her 11. 99 in the 100 would have won the Class M title and put her second at the State Open, . 01 seconds behind the winning time. And Andraya ran Wednesday in cold conditions, and without starting blocks. She is expected to get faster. \u201d \u201cIt feels really good. I\u2019m really happy to win both titles,\u201d Yearwood recently bragged to the media after winning the Class M contest. \u201cI kind of expected it. I\u2019ve always gotten first, so I expected it to some extent.   \u2026     I\u2019m really proud of it. \u201d And, all of this has occurred quite despite the fact that Yearwood has taken no steps to transition into a girl. The runner stands taller than opponents, is clearly far more muscular, and even sports a faint,   mustache. Yearwood\u2019s top opponent, Kate Hall, seems sadly resigned to constantly losing to a \u201cgirl\u201d who has all the more powerful attributes of a boy. \u201cThere\u2019s not much I can do,\u201d Hall said after losing the Class M to Yearwood. \u201cSecond doesn\u2019t work for me. Yeah, it does, in a way, for the team. But you come into a state championship meet looking to win a state title. I had an awesome chance. I could have done a lot of things (differently). If I\u2019d run my best, I could have won it. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating,\u201d Hall added. \u201cBut that\u2019s just the way it is now. \u201d But, Yearwood\u2019s easy wins against biological girls continue to raise questions in New Britain. Even as most break their necks trying desperately to avoid being seen as criticizing a \u201ctransgender athlete,\u201d many are still wondering if it is fair that a powerful, biological boy should be allowed to compete against frailer high school girls. Jeff Jacob of the Hartford Courant raised the questions in a recent column, saying that \u201con a biologically competitive basis,\u201d Yearwood\u2019s victories are not fair to the competitors. Ultimately, Jacobs felt that the results of the competition have been tainted. \u201cHumanity counts. So does biology,\u201d Jacobs wrote. But, he went on saying, \u201cFor me, somebody who has observed sports and written about all kinds of athletes for four decades, the integrity of the state competition for these two races Tuesday was compromised. \u201d Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com.'"}, "time": 1742563242.6775753}
