Not the American people, of course, but none other than billionaire left-wing globalist George Soros. \\nSoros has donated around $25 million to the Clinton campaign as of July, according to Politico , and that clearly buys a great deal of influence. WikiLeaks has recently released emails from the account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta that show the lengths the campaign went to keep Soros \u201chappy\u201d and the huge amount of influence he exerted. \\nIn an Oct. 7, 2014 email from top Clinton aide Huma Abedin to now-campaign manager Robby Mook, Abedin discussed a dinner Clinton was going to have with Soros. Abedin said in the email that she expected that Soros would eventually ask Clinton to attend a fundraiser for one of the numerous groups Soros helps bankroll, the liberal America Votes organization. \\nMook replied to the email: \u201cI would only do this for political reasons (ie to make Soros happy).\u201d \\nFox News reported : \\nDuring her time as secretary of state, Clinton was forwarded from Soros\u2019 aides on Jan. 23, 2011 a message he wrote specifically for her addressing \u201ca serious situation\u201d in Albania. Soros even included two actions that \u201cneed to be done urgently.\u201d One of the suggestions was appointing \u201ca mediator such as Carl Bildt, Martti Ahtisaari or Miroslav Lajcak\u2026\u201d \\nClinton received the email the next day. On Jan. 27, Lajcak met Albanian leaders for a mediation effort. \\nIn another instance, just hours after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia on Feb. 13, 2016, Chris Stone, president of the Soros-founded Open Society Foundations, emailed Podesta and asked: \u201cRemember our discussion of Wallace Jefferson, [former] Chief Justice in Texas?\u201d Podesta simply replied, \u201cyup.\u201d \\nAn adviser and spokesman for Soros, Michael Vachon, did most of the corresponding with Podesta related to Soros. Vachon scheduled phone calls and meetings along with making sure that the campaign knew Soros\u2019 position on a variety of policy issues. \\nFox News reported: \\nOn March 7, 2016, Vachon sent Podesta a memo regarding \u201cTPP and Malaysia\u2019s Corruption Crisis.\u201d The document criticized President Obama for making \u201cvisible compromises\u201d in his quest to get a deal for the Trans Pacific Partnership completed. Podesta was ostensibly set to discuss the memo with Soros and his son, Alexander, during a dinner later that month. Six days later, Vachon got even more specific. \\n\u201cIn general I think George is more interested in talking about policy than the campaign per se,\u201d Vachon wrote. \u201cIn a separate email I will send you George\u2019s latest thinking on the migration crisis, which he is spending a lot of time on. His other big preoccupation these days is Ukraine.\u201d \\nRefugees/migration, the Supreme Court, global warming, Ukraine, etc., are surely just a sampling of policy issues on which the globalist Soros has and will continue to influence Clinton. \\nClinton is dangerous enough as it is, but as the man who could be directing policy decisions if Clinton is elected president? That is a scary thought.'"}, "time": 1742564435.5885155}
