Trump on Wednesday called for a vast expansion of the military, including 90, 000 new soldiers for the Army and nearly 75 new ships for the Navy, requiring up to $90 billion a year in additional spending. But Mr. Trump did not match those numbers with details about how the country would raise the money, other than a promise to take steps like reducing wasteful spending, which military budget analysts said would be insufficient. Mr. Trump, in a speech at the Union League of Philadelphia, also vowed to order the military to devise a new plan to defeat the Islamic State \u201cimmediately upon taking office. \u201d The plan would come within 30 days from \u201cmy generals,\u201d he added, without mentioning that those generals are the same ones who came up with the current strategy, which they believe is working. The speech was the latest effort by Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign to demonstrate to voters that he can lay out detailed policy prescriptions to problems confronting the nation. It also seemed to be directed at the conservative foreign policy establishment, coming a day after Mr. Trump released a letter from about 90 retired military officials endorsing his campaign. He lamented the shrinking of the military and warned that enemies were preparing to capitalize on perceptions of American weakness around the world. \u201cOur adversaries are chomping at the bit,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe want to deter, avoid and prevent conflict through our unquestioned military strength. \u201d With the speech, Mr. Trump also moved to refocus his campaign on critiques of Hillary Clinton, his Democratic rival. Espousing a foreign policy \u201ctempered by realism,\u201d Mr. Trump portrayed Mrs. Clinton, the former secretary of state, as unsuited to lead the nation\u2019s armed forces. \u201cUnlike my opponent, my foreign policy will emphasize diplomacy, not destruction,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s legacy in Iraq, Libya, Syria has produced only turmoil and suffering and death. \u201d But it was the size of the military, and the amount that the United States spends on its defense, that lay at the heart of Mr. Trump\u2019s speech. In addition to increasing the Army to 540, 000 soldiers and adding the Navy ships, Mr. Trump proposed buying dozens of new fighter aircraft for the Air Force. To pay for the expansion, Mr. Trump said he would call on Congress to reverse the cuts to military spending made as part of the budget sequester in 2013, which was the result of a compromise reached between Democrats and Republicans. The new spending, Mr. Trump said, would not cost taxpayers an additional penny. He said he would eliminate wasteful government spending, increase energy production and trim the federal work force, including the military bureaucracy. He also suggested that he would collect unpaid taxes, which he said amounted to $385 billion. Asked about the plan, Todd Harrison, a military budget expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said, \u201cGood luck. \u201d \u201cEveryone comes in saying they want to reduce wasteful spending,\u201d Mr. Harrison said. \u201cFolks have tried that again and again, and they have largely not been successful. \u201d Although Mr. Trump said little about how much his plan would cost, the new military spending would probably amount to $80 billion to $90 billion a year, experts said. The additional soldiers alone would cost around $9 billion. Mr. Trump\u2019s call for ending the sequester on military spending is unlikely to gain traction in Washington. Republicans have long pushed for lifting these limits  \u2014   a proposal Democrats will consider only with comparable relief on domestic spending. And on Tuesday night, in a sign of the likely stalemate, Senate Democrats filibustered a military appropriations bill because it would have allowed for bursting through the caps on military spending without also doing the same for domestic spending. Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks came before he was to appear Wednesday night at a Commander in Chief Forum televised from the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum in New York and focused on security and veterans issues. Mr. Trump was questioned after Mrs. Clinton. Earlier on Wednesday, he described Mrs. Clinton as \u201creckless\u201d and \u201ctotally unfit to be our commander in chief. \u201d Mr. Trump was turning the tables on a frequent line of attack from Mrs. Clinton and trying to lay the blame for the bloodshed in the Middle East at her feet, a critique that most experts have said is grossly oversimplified and misleading. \u201cSometimes it seemed like there wasn\u2019t a country in the Middle East that Hillary Clinton didn\u2019t want to invade, intervene in or topple,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s   and very unstable. \u201d The Clinton campaign fought back after the speech by highlighting the endorsement of more retired generals and admirals, saying Mrs. Clinton had gotten greater support \u201cthan any   Democrat due to her proven record of diplomacy and steady leadership on the world stage. \u201d In a foreign policy speech in April, Mr. Trump offered much the same thrust as in Wednesday\u2019s address  \u2014   presenting an at times paradoxical approach of using fiery oratory to promise a military buildup and the immediate destruction of the Islamic State, while also rejecting the   and interventionist instincts of George W. Bush\u2019s administration. Mr. Trump also echoed other themes that he has used during his campaign, calling on allies to pay more for American military protection. \u201cEarly in my term, I will also be requesting that all NATO nations promptly pay their bills,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly five NATO countries, including the United States, are currently meeting their minimum requirements to spend 2 percent of G. D. P. on defense. \u201d He also accused the Obama administration of agreeing to bad deals with Iran. \u201cOur president lied to us,\u201d Mr. Trump said of President Obama, saying the nuclear deal with Iran put the country \u201con a path to nuclear weapons. \u201d But Mr. Trump\u2019s fiercest criticism was saved for Mrs. Clinton. He accused her of being complicit in an array of foreign policy stumbles, and of deleting her emails as secretary of state to hide her participation in a \u201cpay for play\u201d scandal in which Clinton Foundation donors were granted special access. Damning his rival with false praise, Mr. Trump  \u2014   in one of his speech\u2019s biggest applause lines  \u2014   also said that maybe Mrs. Clinton did have some wisdom to impart. \u201cHillary Clinton has taught us really how vulnerable we are in cyberhacking,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the only thing that we\u2019ve learned from Hillary Clinton. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564579.9762013}
