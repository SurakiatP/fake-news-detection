Here\u2019s what you need to know: \u2022 A powerful earthquake triggered a tsunami off the coast of Japan, near where three nuclear reactors melted down at a plant in Fukushima after a quake and tsunami in 2011. Minor injuries were reported. A cooling system in a reactor in a nuclear plant shut down, but was restored without incident. Tsunami warnings were lifted by early afternoon. _____ \u2022   Donald J. Trump released an   YouTube video in which he asserted that his transition was going \u201cvery smoothly, efficiently and effectively\u201d and discussed top priorities for his first day in office. One of them: beginning the process of withdrawing from the   Partnership. Here is the latest on the transition and a look at what he hopes to accomplish in his first 100 days. _____ \u2022 The importance of one factor that played into the election is still emerging: the role of fake news. Some false stories are produced deliberately, but some build from misinformed social media posts. We look at how one mistaken tweet by a man with just 40 followers exploded through the hyperpartisan blogosphere. _____ \u2022 The fallout from revelations of Russia\u2019s   doping program is rewriting the record books for the Beijing and London Summer Olympics. The retesting of stored urine samples has incriminated at least 40 medal winners, the majority from Russia and other Eastern European countries. Medals from the 2014 Sochi Olympics are also likely to be called into question. _____ \u2022 President Obama returns home from the   Economic Cooperation summit meeting with China ascendant. President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines said he plans to declare part of the Scarborough Shoal a marine sanctuary, another sign of growing rapprochement between Beijing and Manila. _____ \u2022 South Korea\u2019s opposition, the People\u2019s Party, has started collecting signatures in Parliament to impeach President Park   over an   scandal. Many South Korean women worry that Ms. Park\u2019s troubles could make the country, already among the lowest in global   rankings, even more resistant to elevating women to positions of power. _____ \u2022 \u201cFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,\u201d cast a spell on international audiences, earning $143 million in a partial release. In Korea, the Harry Potter spinoff accounted for nearly 70 percent of the total weekend box office. The film opens soon in China and Japan. \u2022 The Taiwanese carrier TransAsia Airways has canceled all flights and suspended trade on its stocks, pending a major announcement today. \u2022 Samsung and Panasonic are investigating allegations that migrant Nepalese workers were abused working in the companies\u2019 supply chain in Malaysia. \u2022 A European documentary photographer visited call centers in India and the Philippines, creating a window to the world on the other end of the line. \u2022 Quit social media. That\u2019s the advice of a university professor who says that doing so could benefit your career. \u201cIf you\u2019re serious about making an impact in the world,\u201d he says, \u201cpower down your smartphone, close your browser tabs, roll up your sleeves and get to work. \u201d \u2022 United States markets were higher, and the major indexes were on pace to close at record levels. Here\u2019s a snapshot of global markets. \u2022 Afghanistan\u2019s chief executive, Abdullah Abdullah, condemned a suicide bombing in Kabul that killed at least 27 people as \u201ca war crime and an act against Islam and humanity. \u201d [The New York Times] \u2022 Britain\u2019s decision to withdraw from the European Union might have seemed simple at first, but the details are a matter of principles as well as economics. [The New York Times] \u2022 The Vatican extended a policy allowing priests to grant forgiveness for abortion, continuing Pope Francis\u2019s aim to make the church more welcoming and inclusive. [The New York Times] \u2022 Here\u2019s our look at some of Pope Francis\u2019s other efforts to reshape the Roman Catholic Church. [The New York Times] \u2022 As America\u2019s   white nationalists embrace Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, we take a look at how the movement overlaps with white supremacy. [The New York Times] \u2022 The award for the world\u2019s best rice went to Thailand\u2019s Hom Mal at a recent industry contest. Cambodia\u2019s Phka Rumdoul took second place, and Japonica rice, from the U. S. was third. [The Phnom Penh Post] \u2022 We spoke with Martin Scorsese about his new film, \u201cSilence,\u201d which is based on a novel about missionaries in 17th century Japan. The movie is his ultimate passion project. \u2022 The world\u2019s best climber is taking on Yosemite\u2019s Dawn Wall. He wanted to shatter a record. Now he\u2019s just trying to finish. \u2022 The next great space telescope spread its wings this month, but it won\u2019t launch until October 2018  \u2014   and it won\u2019t record its first real image until 2019. \u2022 A monumental sculpture of a fistful tulips by the artist Jeff Koons will be donated to the city of Paris to commemorate the victims of terrorist attacks. \u2022 Our Daily 360: Take a flight over California\u2019s forests, where tens of millions of   trees have created a tinderbox for wildfires. Ah, the family road trip. Every country with cars knows the drill, and this week the United States will see some of its busiest traveling days of the year with the Thanksgiving holiday. AAA predicts that 43. 5 million Americans will be on the roads. What to do as you\u2019re going over the river and through the woods to grandma\u2019s house? While   comforts, apps and     screens have made it easier to pass the time while on the road, the games of yesteryear can offer a twinge of nostalgia for adults and a   option to entertain the kids. Whether it\u2019s spotting roadside novelties  \u2014   as in I Spy or Bingo  \u2014   or vehicles from different states (or countries)  \u2014   as in the license plate game  \u2014   most games are variations on a scavenger hunt. (Punch Buggy, which depends on spotting a dwindling supply of old Volkswagen Beetles, could just be an exercise in frustration.) In Britain, car snooker adapts the rules of the cue sport on which it\u2019s based, requiring players to spot vehicles of different colors. Earlier this year, The Times also collected favorite travel games from readers (one is titled \u201cGuess What I Saw? \u201d). Perhaps more important, in the aftermath of a contentious election, getting to dinner might be more fun than the destination itself.
