Bannon, ratcheted up the attacks, arguing that news organizations had been \u201chumiliated\u201d by the election outcome and repeatedly describing the media as \u201cthe opposition party\u201d of the current administration. \u201cThe media should be embarrassed and humiliated and keep its mouth shut and just listen for a while,\u201d Mr. Bannon said in an interview on Wednesday. \u201cI want you to quote this,\u201d Mr. Bannon added. \u201cThe media here is the opposition party. They don\u2019t understand this country. They still do not understand why Donald Trump is the president of the United States. \u201d The scathing assessment  \u2014   delivered by one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most trusted and influential advisers, in the first days of his presidency  \u2014   comes at a moment of high tension between the news media and the administration, with skirmishes over the size of Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural crowd and the president\u2019s false claims that millions of illegal votes by undocumented immigrants swayed the popular vote against him. Mr. Bannon, who rarely grants interviews to journalists outside of Breitbart News, the provocative   website he ran until August, was echoing comments by Mr. Trump last weekend, when the president said he was in \u201ca running war\u201d with the media and called journalists \u201camong the most dishonest people on earth. \u201d Mr. Bannon\u2019s remarks added to the growing acrimony between the press and a president who made attacks on the media a rallying point of his election campaign. Among Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers in the White House, Mr. Bannon is responsible for putting into action the nationalist vision that Mr. Trump channeled during the later months of the campaign, one that stemmed from Mr. Bannon himself. And in many ways Mr. Trump has acted on that vision during his first week in office  \u2014   from the description of \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d he laid out in his inauguration speech to a series of executive actions outlining policies on trade agreements, immigration and the building of a border wall. Mr. Bannon is one of the strongest forces in an administration with competing power centers. A savvy manipulator of the press, and a proud provocateur, he was among the few advisers in Mr. Trump\u2019s circle who were said to have urged Sean Spicer, the new press secretary, to give a confrontational, emotional statement to a shocked West Wing briefing room on Saturday, when the White House disputed news reports about the size of the inauguration crowd. He shares Mr. Trump\u2019s view that the news media misunderstood the movement that the president rode into office. Speaking by telephone on Wednesday, Mr. Bannon delivered a broad indictment of the news media as being biased against Mr. Trump and out of touch with the American public. That is an argument familiar to readers of Breitbart and followers of personalities friendly to Mr. Trump, like Sean Hannity of Fox News. \u201cThe elite media got it dead wrong, 100 percent dead wrong,\u201d Mr. Bannon said of the election, calling it \u201ca humiliating defeat that they will never wash away, that will always be there. \u201d \u201cThe mainstream media has not fired or terminated anyone associated with following our campaign,\u201d Mr. Bannon said. \u201cLook at the Twitter feeds of those people: They were outright activists of the Clinton campaign. \u201d (He did not name specific reporters or editors.) \u201cThat\u2019s why you have no power,\u201d he added. \u201cYou were humiliated. \u201d Mr. Bannon spoke in blunt but calm tones, peppered with profanity, and humorously referred to himself as \u201cDarth Vader. \u201d He said, with ironic relish, that Mr. Trump was elected by a surge of support from \u201cthe   hobbits and deplorables. \u201d The conversation was initiated by Mr. Bannon to offer praise for Mr. Spicer, who has been criticized this week for making false claims at the White House podium about attendance at Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural, for calling reporters dishonest and lecturing them about what stories to write, and for failing to disavow Mr. Trump\u2019s lie about widespread voter fraud in the election. Asked if he was concerned that Mr. Spicer had lost credibility with the news media, Mr. Bannon chortled. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d he said. \u201cWe think that\u2019s a badge of honor. \u2018Questioning his integrity\u2019  \u2014   are you kidding me? The media has zero integrity, zero intelligence, and no hard work. \u201d \u201cYou\u2019re the opposition party,\u201d he said. \u201cNot the Democratic Party. You\u2019re the opposition party. The media\u2019s the opposition party. \u201d Journalists reacted with alarm and defiance to Mr. Bannon\u2019s comments. \u201cWhat country are we living in?\u201d Christiane Amanpour, the CNN correspondent, wrote on Twitter. \u201cWe are not the opposition,\u2019\u2019 Stephen Engelberg, editor in chief of the nonprofit news organization ProPublica, wrote in an email. \u201cWe are part of an essential function in any democracy. \u201d He added that ProPublica had no intention of \u201cshutting up in response to this or any other president\u2019s demand. \u201d \u201cWe are here to tell the truth and we intend to continue doing so, regardless of how badly some might want us to parrot \u2018alternative facts,\u2019\u201d Mr. Engelberg said. Mr. Bannon mostly referred to the \u201celite\u201d or \u201cmainstream\u201d media, but he cited The New York Times and The Washington Post by name. \u201cThe paper of record for our beloved republic, The New York Times, should be absolutely ashamed and humiliated,\u201d Mr. Bannon said. \u201cThey got it 100 percent wrong. \u201d He added that he has been a reader of The Times for most of his adult life.'"}, "time": 1742562702.501441}
