Because there are Turkmens there, but 60 percent of them are Shia, 40 percent of Turkmens are Sunni, then there are also Kurds, non-Muslims, and Arabs. So if six cantons are to be established there, then do we sow the seeds of the new conflict? Because it will not be a monolith composition... We should not create new problems,\" Yakis said. He said that getting rid of sectarianism in this issues would be best for Turkey. \"If Turkey can secure this and prevent Shia militants from entering the center of the city, which is inhabited by Sunnis, this would be the best gain for Turkey,\" Yakis said. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider Abadi announced the start of a military operation to recapture Mosul from Daesh, outlawed in Russia, with the help of airstrikes by the US-led international coalition. According to local media, about 30,000 Iraqi soldiers and 4,000 Kurdish Peshmerga fighters are taking part in the operation. Turkey has repeatedly said it is willing to take part in the operation, though Iraq has raised objections.'"}, "time": 1742562877.838208}
