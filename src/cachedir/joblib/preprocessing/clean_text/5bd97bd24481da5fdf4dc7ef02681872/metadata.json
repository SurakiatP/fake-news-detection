A Pomeranian obsessively rearranges her bedding. A rabbit in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, waits for his nightly bowl of oats. A bulldog in the East Village makes passionate love to a pillow. All the while, as the animals go about their business, the cameras roll. This summer\u2019s hit movie \u201cThe Secret Life of Pets,\u201d set in a   New York City, offers fantastical answers to the   question: What do Fido and Fluffy do when we\u2019re not around? In the film, they listen to heavy metal, massage themselves with eggbeaters, throw noisy parties, hijack   trucks and tumble down   sewers. But in real life in the   age, there is no need to wonder. There are cameras  \u2014   nanny cams, pet cams, indoor   systems  \u2014   streaming countless   of empirical data each day across the screens of   New Yorkers. So what do these animals do, cooped up in empty apartments? They sleep, a lot. Even when awake, they spend a lot of time just waiting around, especially if they\u2019re dogs. \u201cWhat they\u2019re not ever doing is exactly what \u2018The Secret Life of Pets\u2019 is about, which is that they have independent lives that they resume when you leave,\u201d said Alexandra Horowitz, director of the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College. \u201cThis is not when they come into themselves. It is when they\u2019re waiting for the person to return so they can resume normal programming. \u201d Yet in those hours of suspended animation, there are moments when life puts itself on display. In a brief YouTube video called \u201cHome alone,\u201d a Manhattan Labradoodle puppy named Kody knocks a roll of paper towels off a dresser, studies it, rolls it with a paw and begins to chew it to shreds: Project sought, project found. People  \u2014   largely people with digitally oriented desk jobs, it seems  \u2014   train surveillance cameras on their pets for a number of reasons. Because they want to make sure the dog walker shows up. Because they miss their companion or feel a little guilty about leaving it home all day. Or just because they can. \u201cIt\u2019s like white noise  \u2014   I just have it on in the background,\u201d said Dave Stangle, 31, an advertising director for the dog product and entertainment company Bark  Co. and owner of Frank, the   bulldog. \u201cIt just provides peace of mind that when you\u2019re not there, the dog is just walking around or sleeping. \u201d Jo Victor has noticed that her chocolate lab, Mista Pikle Butt (pronounced like pickle butt) is \u201cbasically like a human when I\u2019m gone. \u201d \u201cHe just kind of walks around, sits on the couch, watches TV, gets up,\u201d said Ms. Victor, the service coordinator for Swifto, the   site. She leaves the television tuned to the Food Network for him. Others, like Kevin Dresser, find the sight of a bored animal disconcerting. Mr. Dresser, a   TV pioneer, ran a popular webcam called Bklyn Bunny starring Roebling, a white buck with a stylish black eyepatch, from 2005 until Roebling\u2019s death last year. \u201cWhen we would be out to dinner with friends or somewhere traveling around the city and we would check in, it would be nice to know that he was there,\u201d Mr. Dresser, a graphic designer, said. \u201dBut sometimes it would make you a little sad because you think \u2018I should be at home with him.\u2019 \u201d Especially around Oaty Time. \u201cAt 10 o\u2019clock every night, we would give Roebling a bowl of oats,\u201d Mr. Dresser said. \u201cSo around 10 o\u2019clock he would go sit by his oat dish and wait. If we weren\u2019t home, we would get emails from people, \u2018Hey, looks like Roebling is ready for his oats.\u2019 \u201d \u201cThese camera companies talk about how great it is to be able to see your dog while you\u2019re at work, but there is some kind of gloominess about it,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s your dog, sitting in the corner, and no one\u2019s at home with him. \u201d Ms. Horowitz, the dog scientist whose new book, \u201cBeing a Dog,\u201d will be published in the fall, concurred. A dog left alone may sleep all day, she said, \u201cbut that\u2019s from lack of stimulation, not from need to sleep. \u201cThink of any working dog who is given anything to do,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are walking around pursuing whatever they\u2019re doing for a full day and they don\u2019t need to take   naps. It\u2019s just that these dogs don\u2019t have a job. \u201d She got a second dog in part to keep her first dog company. Her finding: \u201cOur two dogs spent a truly impressive amount of time asleep    on the sofa. \u201d Pet cams occasionally transmit important news. Kody\u2019s owner, Katelyn Lesse, once checked in on him just in time to see him raiding a container of allergy pills. \u201cI ran home and rushed him to the vet,\u201d Ms. Lesse, 23, a software engineer, said. (He had eaten three or four but was fine.) Dan Graziano learned a useful fact about his young goldendoodle, Theo: He poops on the floor, then eats it. \u201cOf course when I get home, he wants to lick my face,\u201d said Mr. Graziano, 27, an associate editor at CNET who lives on the Upper East Side. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018No, I know what you did today.\u2019 I\u2019ll take a pass on the   on those days. \u201d Sometimes the camera offers a disconcerting glimpse. Andy P. Smith\u2019s terrier mutt, Luigi, goes to a doggy day care with a webcam. \u201cEvery time we check it,\u201d said Mr. Smith, a    writer who lives in Greenpoint, \u201che\u2019s sitting off by himself, in a big room with 40 other dogs playing and having a good time around him. He\u2019s like the weird kid at the playground. \u201d Sometimes, it solves a mystery. One evening, Ms. Lesse found shirts and underwear strewn across the bedroom floor. \u201cI was like, \u2018How did this happen?\u2019 So I rewound the video and there was one tiny corner of a shirt sticking out of the drawer. Kody grabbed onto the shirt and the drawer opened and he got at everything inside. \u201d Lydia DesRoche, a Broadway animal trainer, got a camera to watch her pit bull, Red, after he got into a cabinet and ate a box of Kind bars. One day, she arrived to walk him and found the refrigerator door wide open. The remains of some fancy dog food lay on the couch. A pan of paella had been ravaged. Rewind, and there was Red, pushing the door open with his snout, then heading for the couch with a prize in his mouth. \u201cHe has no shame,\u201d she said. Red has a kindred spirit in Banjo, a terrier mix, who has spent six years raiding the fridge of his owner, Garland Harwood, a publicist for Bark  Co. Mr. Harwood has yet to catch Banjo in the act, but he has assembled an impressive array of crime scene photos. And then there are those times when seeing your pet\u2019s secret life only deepens the mystery. One day, Richard Blakeley, a digital product director, got a motion alert on his phone. He tuned in to witness a   outburst that he posted on YouTube under the title \u201cRichard Blakeley has a dog named Bagel that goes crazy. \u201d Action: Bagel jumps on the couch and digs frantically between the cushions. She growls. Then she freezes. She leaps as if chasing prey. She runs from one end of the couch to the other, over and over. She barks and yips. She digs furiously. Finally she bounds onto a chair and out of view. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t believe that was my dog, because she\u2019s never like that,\u201d Mr. Blakeley said. \u201cShe\u2019s a pretty timid dog. \u201d Lindsay Kaplan, Mr. Blakeley\u2019s wife, has a theory about what Bagel gets up to when she thinks no one is watching: \u201cShe has an imaginary squirrel. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561852.451391}
