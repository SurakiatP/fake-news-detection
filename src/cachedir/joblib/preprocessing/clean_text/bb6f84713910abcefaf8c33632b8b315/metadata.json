Sometimes it masqueraded as valuable analysis and critical journalism. Most often, these pieces were clearly, as author Aldous Huxley might say, excruciating orgasms of self-assertion.\\nShadowproof\u2019s staff collaborated on this collection of the worst punditry written during the campaign. Many of these individuals deserve the label of hack. They should be forever remembered for compounding the trauma of this election.\\nAdditionally, we know we probably missed some gems that deserve recognition. We would like our readers to submit what they consider to be the worst of the worst, and on Thursday, November 10, we will publish a collection nominated by our readers.

The most energized pundit was Jonathan Chait, writer for New York Magazine. In this piece championing liberalism , Chait took part in what\u2019s become a formulaic liberal undertaking: warning of the specter of Marxism or any leftist ideology imbued with even the faintest hint of red.\\nArguing liberalism \u201cworks\u201d not only means ignoring its past and present failures, but it also speaks to a deep-seated fear among the liberal commentariat. They are afraid a genuine leftist ideology is enticing to the young and disillusioned. Even Bernie Sanders, as benign and unthreatening as he was, faced a torrent of diatribes for advocating some of the most genial socialist policies, including the right to a \u201cliving wage.\u201d Someday, there will be an independent socialist movement, and it will be truly vindicating.

One of the most superficial justifications for a Hillary Clinton presidency came from one Courtney Enlow who penned an \u201call-caps explosion of feelings\u201d for the former Secretary of State. Enlow spends the entire body of her article yelling because \u201cHillary cannot yell\u201d, so on her behalf she etches out a stream of incoherent complaints in all caps.\\n\u201cFuck everything, I\u2019m with her,\u201d Enlow concluded. It might as well be the mantra of every liberal supporter of Clinton. Her article not only neglects to address a single policy issue but it also\u2014intentionally or otherwise\u2014paints all detractors as misogynists, unwilling to pass the torch to a woman, and white, thereby erasing countless people of color who condemned Clinton for actions she\u2019s taken, and the policies she\u2019s supported throughout her political career. This shallow examination of Clinton as a beer buddy instead of a politician with a direct hand in the material consequences, which impacted innumerable communities, is now normal. This is the way so many dissect political candidates and a preview of what is in store for Americans after Clinton\u2019s inauguration. (Roqayah Chamseddine)\\nFurther Reading: \u201c Hillary Clinton vs. Herself \u201d by Rebecca Traister \\nMax Fisher \u2014 \u201cIs Hillary Clinton really the foreign policy super-hawk she is portrayed to be?\u201d Clinton has a reputation as a hawk. It won her praise during the 2016 election from neoconservatives, who ardently supported President George W. Bush\u2019s foreign policy. She supports a no-fly zone in Syria. She was a fierce advocate for regime change against Muammar Gaddafi in Libya after meeting with Westernized Libyan exiles and played a key role in pushing the U.S. government to war. She is a big believer in targeted assassinations with drones. She voted for the Iraq War when she was a senator. Nevertheless, Fisher wrote a piece during the primary intended to undermine all the scrutiny of her foreign policy record.\\nIt was a response to the New York Times profile by Mark Landler on how she became a hawk. Fisher made several distinctions without a difference, suggesting she is \u201chawkish on failed states, civil wars, and humanitarian crises; dovish toward adversarial or hostile states.\u201d He penned this marvelous sentence after summarizing her record supporting interventions in Yugoslavia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and Syria: \u201cThat is just a large number of wars or military interventions, and it\u2019s easy to see why Clinton has been judged as hawkish as a result,\u201d as if the wars just happened to Clinton like bad bouts of the flu and there\u2019s nothing much she could do about it. Then, Fisher reasoned it is hard to know what a president will do in terms of foreign policy because it is beyond American control. Except, what Fisher does not get is that America is a massive empire, and the U.S. most certainly has the ability to determine whether pouring gasoline on the fire is the right thing to do. (Kevin Gosztola)\\nPaul Krugman \u2013 \u201cPlutocrats and Prejudice\u201d Casting Sanders as myopic and money-obsessed was a convenient way for pundits to water down his actual platform, which included demands for universal healthcare and an end to mass incarceration. However, Krugman\u2019s argument went beyond that. It joined the trend of weaponizing identity politics and cast Clinton as the candidate, who understood minority communities better even though she once called black people \u201csuper predators.\u201d\\nKrugman claimed Sanders believes \u201cmoney is the root of all evil,\u201d while Clinton believes \u201cmoney is the root of some evil, maybe a lot of evil, but it isn\u2019t the whole story. Instead, racism, sexism and other forms of prejudice are powerful forces in their own right.\u201c It helped to deflect conversation about Clinton\u2019s relationships with Wall Street elites or her support for welfare reform that ravaged communities of color. It also enabled Clinton to respond to critiques of President Barack Obama with suggestions that an angry old white man was trying to hijack the Democratic Party.

In the early months of the primary, she painted Sanders supporters as an all white and male obstacle to history, and Sanders himself as their belligerent leader intent on denying American women their dream of a potent symbol in the White House.\\nClinton Super PAC Correct the Record relished the kind of work Marcotte did because it effectively erased the thousands of young women who had legitimate policy disagreements with Clinton. In this particular piece, she put forth \u201cevidence\u201d of the gender dynamic by publishing two photos she took of a rally in Iowa. One showed a crowd full of hopeful women of all ages she said were united by their love of Katy Perry and adorned with \u201cGlitter, unicorns, and Disney princess memorabilia.\u201d Another showed the scraggly crowd of \u201ccantankerous young men\u201d Sanders attracted. Again, identity politics cleverly distracted from a necessary conversation on the issues and records of the two presidential candidates.

This particular column was so trollish it needed to be read by gaslight.\\nClaiming Sanders supporters were part of an \u201cangry movement\u201d and out of their senses, Reid told Sanders in May, before many primaries occurred, he needed to concede the race and tell his supporters to stop living in an \u201calternate reality.\u201d And she further distinguished herself by trying to manipulate Sanders voters into believing their concerns were products of racism and sexism, even though Sanders typically won all younger voters, regardless of race, ethnicity, and gender. (Dan Wright)\\nMichael Tomasky \u2013 \u201cGet Of My Lawn, Bernie Kids! Why I\u2019m Voting for Hillary Clinton\u201d In the film, \u201cGran Torino,\u201d Clint Eastwood shouts at kids to get off his lawn because he struggles with diversity and America as a more inclusive society. For Tomasky, the \u201cthreat\u201d to his \u201clawn\u201d was different. It is millennials, who possess an ambitious vision for a better and just world that goes beyond the confines of establishment politics; you know, young people who seek to unravel the messes created and amplified by the failures of Tomasky\u2019s generation.\\nFor this column, Tomasky, a 56 year-old white man with a very nice home in suburban Washington, D.C., that could be found on Zillow, haplessly wielded the politics of privilege. It was written in first person and teemed with the kind of self-absorbed narcissism, which was a hallmark of the vote scolding genre of writing so many of us were subjected to during the election. After he was challenged by Sanders supporters, Tomasky copped out and declared, \u201cI haven\u2019t the slightest idea. But none of you Sanders supporters has the slightest idea of what the future holds either.\u201d He went on to mock supporters for being assertive, even though it was his performance that provoked thousands of supporters into understandable outrage.

Votes for Jill Stein. However, there is a genre of liberal punditry that goes back more than a decade. It lectures and berates every citizen, who would dare to vote for a third-party candidate. It says they help Republicans and seeks to blame them for wars, poverty, famine, armageddon\u2014just about anything bad that occurred after voters dared to support another choice than one of the two candidates the capitalist system foisted upon them.\\nChait is magnificent at writing these types of asinine columns. Through spectacular misdirection, he maintained Stein believed Clinton will lead to fascism. He ignored the kernel of Stein\u2019s remarks that sparked this spittle; in particular, how failure to improve the material conditions of lower and working class Americans fuels right-wing extremism. If anyone needs to demonstrate why our choices get progressively worse each election, they can point to columnists like Chait, who foster this kind of half-baked discourse.

None of the individuals smeared in the piece actually ever expressed support for Trump. In fact, each of them had records, where they denounced him before Kirchick accused them of being Trump Lovers. Washington Post columnist Greg Sargent reacted , \u201cArea man willfully confuses refusal to unthinkingly parrot all criticism of Trump with \u2018admiration\u2019 of him.\u201d On top of that, it brought further controversy to The Daily Beast after it published a story by a straight writer who was outing Olympians as gay. (That egregious piece was removed.)\\nKirchick\u2019s piece was one of the earlier articulations of the argument that the Kremlin wants Trump to be U.S. president, which now saturates media. He reasoned leftists critical of Clinton \u201cvalidated\u201d Trump and so, therefore, they were feeding into the agenda of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. It seems rather boring and uninspired at this point. He and other neoconservatives had it rough during the election because they were no longer relevant, and in order to be relevant, they had to openly identify with the Clinton campaign. Maybe, there\u2019s a role for Kirchick in the pundit class under a Clinton presidency. He regularly contributed to the Los Angeles Times over the past months. Or maybe this cretinous drool monger now carries too much of a risk of damaging a media organization\u2019s reputation that editors will steer clear of him. (Kevin Gosztola)\\nFurther Reading: \u201c If Trump wins, a coup isn\u2019t impossible here in the U.S. \u201c \\nEli Lake \u2013 \u201cNow Clinton Knows How Scooter Libby Felt\u201d The failed presidency of George W. Bush left many neoconservatives scrambling to hold onto power and relevance, but neocons like Lake believe they have found the sunny-side up around the Clinton campaign. With Clinton and friends celebrating the support of Iraq war cheerleaders Robert Kagan, Max Boot, and David Frum, it was only a matter of time before someone tried to beat the yoke of the old regime off former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney and convicted felon I. Lewis \u201cScooter\u201d Libby.\\nIn his piece, Lake celebrated Libby\u2019s reinstatement to the D.C. Bar and feebly tries to compare Clinton\u2019s alleged mistreatment by the FBI with Libby\u2019s, noting a tangential connection to FBI Director James Comey. Lake claimed Libby was \u201ctried and convicted in the press before the trial\u201d (and also convicted after the trial). It amounted to a preview of how we can expect neocon pundits to behave under a Clinton presidency. (Dan Wright)\\nMatt Yglesias \u2014 \u201cAgainst Transparency\u201d There are hundreds of journalists against transparency, some who are in the closet and some who are very public about their views. Concerned about how the Clinton campaign struggled with coverage of the former secretary of state\u2019s emails, Yglesias fully outed himself and advocated for increased restriction on the types of government records that can be released to journalists and the public. He argued emails and other electronic records produced with \u201cconversational\u201d communication tools should not be subject to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).\\nYglesias displayed a severe misunderstanding of FOIA and neglected to mention the existence of key privacy exemptions and \u201cdeliberative process privilege.\u201d These are supposed to protect officials so they can have frank conversations that will most likely remain secret. Beyond that, Yglesias\u2019s column represented the growing disdain against information that exists among liberal pundits, who seem to believe if these things are secret the right-wing echo chamber will not be able to make Clinton\u2019s life miserable. Yet, of course, organizations in this echo chamber will always find something to spin against Clinton. Yglesias knows this, and that made his call to restrict a major tool for government accountability even more dumb.
