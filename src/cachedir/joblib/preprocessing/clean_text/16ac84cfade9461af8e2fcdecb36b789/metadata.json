It was the guy from Swirlpool! The one thing I wasn\u2019t expecting! Someone actually doing what they said they were going to do! The only time I experience that level of follow-through is on the toilet, or in my pull-ups, but even that doesn\u2019t happen all that often.\u2019 \\n\u2018It was all a bit embarrassing actually, because there wasn\u2019t anything wrong with the oven yet. The warranty had just expired so I knew it was only a matter of time. I thought I was being clever by booking an engineer straight away, confident that by the time he turned up, there would be something wrong with it.\u2019 \\n\u2018Mind you, he didn\u2019t mind. It turns out he\u2019s a big Game of Thrones fan as well. So we had a smoke and cracked on with the show. We had a jolly old day in the end, much to the chagrin of the other customers he was scheduled to see that day, but, then again, that\u2019s tradesmen for you.\u2019 Jodster'"}, "time": 1742564496.5630908}
