Mike Adams of Natural News and Dave Hodges of The Common Sense Show have both dug deeply, examining the overall situation with outstanding insights as to the possibilities. Mike\u2019s piece listed the scenarios that can happen regarding either outcome, and government actions that can be triggered by the result. Dave\u2019s videos and telephone conversations expose the fact that the government is indeed preparing to have plans ready and in place with drills and exercises that can turn into an actual operation immediately.\\nYou can watch Dave Hodge\u2019s full report with Paul Martin below:\\n\\nThat being mentioned, an article came out the other day written by Deb Riechmann of the Associated Press, October 26 entitled US Official: Russia Might Shoot Down US Aircraft in Syria . The article highlights dialogue from a Charlie Rose interview via CBS at the Council of Foreign Relations in New York that was conducted with National Intelligence Director James Clapper . The answers that Clapper gave to the questions gives two \u201cinsights\u201d into the Obama administration\u2019s mindset. This comment came regarding the potential for the US and Russia engaging one another militarily:\\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft if they felt that [it] was threatening to their forces on the ground. Russia has deployed a very advanced and capable air defense system in Syria and would not have done that if it [Russia] wouldn\u2019t use it.\u201d \\nJames Clapper \\nThen Clapper was questioned about North Korea, and he had this to say:\\n\u201c\u2026the U.S. policy of trying to persuade Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons is probably futile. Perhaps the only thing the U.S. could get would be limitations on North Korea\u2019s nuclear capabilities. I think the notion of getting the North Koreans to denuclearize is probably a lost cause. They are under siege and they are very paranoid, so the notion of giving up their nuclear capability, whatever it is, is a nonstarter with them.\u201d \\nAll of this sounds very lackadaisical, coming from the Director of National Intelligence. That is because it is: Obama is pursuing a laissez-faire policy regarding \u201cthreats,\u201d either from Russia or North Korea. The reason? He created them to use later. Clapper\u2019s next responses are very interesting regarding the questions of whether or not Russia has been tampering with the election process and the recent threat by Vice President Joe Biden that the U.S. will respond to the (alleged) tampering with a Cyberattack designed \u201cto embarrass and humiliate\u201d the Kremlin. Here is an excerpt of that interview:\\n\u201cClapper also was asked about the Obama administration\u2019s claim that recent hacking of political sites was orchestrated by top Russian officials. The U.S. response might not come in the form of a reciprocal cyberattack on Russia, Clapper said. \\nPressed on the subject, Rose, the interviewer, noted that there is a sense that the Russians were not paying any price for the hacking. \\n\u201cMaybe not yet,\u201d Clapper replied. \\n\u201cMaybe after the election?\u201d Rose asked. \\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to pre-empt,\u201d Clapper said.\u201d \\nThere we have it, in the absence of verbal commitment, no matter how nebulous the answer may seem. Just because it is nebulous, however, does not belie the nefarious nature of the answer, and it is obvious: The Obama administration is setting the Russians up for the time of the election to blame any deviance or hacks on them. \\nIt is no secret that election fraud is being committed now, even with the early voting that is occurring in several states. The Cyberattacks conducted on Friday, October 21st were a Beta-test for what is to come: full-blown election fraud and an attack on the infrastructure of the U.S. , to be blamed on Russia or North Korea and used as justification to either suspend the elections or declare them null and void.\\nOn October 25 , an article was released entitled DMV Computer Outage Raises Fear of Election-Day Cyber Attacks , as presented on losangeles.cbslocal.com . Apparently 100 DMV offices in California had a gigantic computer malfunction that was not attributed to hacking. The article interviewed a USC professor who had the following to say:\\n\u201cElection day may be a different story. Government computer systems are vulnerable to cyber attacks. I think there will certainly be some sort of cyber security issue in some location.\u201d \\nClifford Neuman, Director, USC Center for Computer Systems Security \\nFrom a standpoint of greater simplicity, the government can simply collapse the power grid, and this can be blamed on an EMP (Electromagnetic Pulse) weapon from North Korea or Russia. If this is not done, the government can use the Soros-provided voting machines and other nefarious measures (such as dead people\u2019s names being used to vote, illegal aliens casting a ballot, or people voting in numerous states, to name a few) to steal the votes. Then blame can be shifted to the Russians.\\nKeep in mind that the Cyberattack on October 21 was found to \u201cnot be done by a government\u2019s actions through state actors,\u201d as the Mainstream media termed it. How true. Not one concrete shred of justification that Russia has been conducting any Cyberattacks has been provided. Certainly the Russian government has taken the time to investigate the source of the hacking on the U.S. systems. They will certainly monitor the elections in some manner to protect themselves from any accusations of hacking and prove they do not hold any culpability when the Democrats skew the numbers of the election and steal it themselves.\\nThis is why the federal government has warned Russia that simply to monitor the elections may warrant criminal charges being brought against the Russian government. \\nBut it\u2019s OK to have UN election monitors, which in itself is a violation of the 10 th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, right? \\nThe law doesn\u2019t apply to the Democrats; the law only matters as long as they can inflict it upon you. Soros just came out recently and cursed democracy in general: though toad like in appearance and mannerisms, this communist foreigner is responsible for the collapse and/or debilitation of almost a dozen governments. In a previous article we covered how the voting machines in the early voting in Illinois did not register the original choice of the voter and \u201cchose\u201d the Democratic candidates. This was labeled as a \u201ccalibration error,\u201d so simply and innocently. The communists masquerading as Democrats know the truth of the matter, that it is those who count the votes and not the voters who decide the elections.\\nIn summary, the U.S. is prepositioning its \u201cenemy-assets\u201d to blame \u2013 on what the administration does \u2013 for a collapsed election labeled as \u201crigged\u201d or the suspension of the election for any number of reasons, real or illusory, such as a genuine attack the U.S. provokes or an attack the U.S. carries out on itself . Civil unrest and/or war are the escape hatches to bail out of the Constitution and to take control of the country\u2026not letting either crisis go to waste. With civil rest or a world war, the administration will be handed the country on a platter \u2013 indefinitely \u2013 and the election will be a moot point, whether it happened or not.\\nJeremiah Johnson is the Nom de plume of a retired Green Beret of the United States Army Special Forces (Airborne).
