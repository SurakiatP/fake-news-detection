Rich\u2019s ex-wife, Denise, donated more than $1 million to various Clinton and Democratic entities, including the Democratic National Committee, Hillary Clinton\u2019s New York Senate campaign and the Clinton Foundation. \\nThe release provides little in the way of information that has not already been publicized. But the dump is noteworthy for two reasons. It reminds voters that the Clinton White House and Clinton Foundation were embroiled in an investigation concerning pay-to-play allegations. The Clinton Foundation is reportedly being investigated at the present by multiple FBI field offices. \\nIt also comes as the FBI is locked in a bitter standoff with the Clinton Foundation and the Justice Department over FBI director James Comey\u2019s handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation. \\nThe newly-released files include one entry which shows that \u201cthe required pardon standards and procedures were not followed\u201d prior to the Rich pardon. \\nRoger Adams, the U.S. Pardon Attorney at the time, testified to Congress in Feb. 2001 that \u201cnone of the regular procedures were followed\u201d ahead of the Rich reprieve. \\nFormer Attorney General Eric Holder is also mentioned in the file. It cites Holder\u2019s testimony that he was the only person who worked at DOJ \u2014 he was deputy attorney general at the time \u2014 about the Rich pardon. From the FBI\u2019s Clinton Foundation investigation files \\nA grand jury was convened to weigh the merits of the case, but no indictments were handed down. Ironically, the law enforcement official who closed the case was FBI director Comey. He served as deputy attorney general in the George W. Bush administration. \\nThe FBI\u2019s website suggests that more Clinton Foundation investigation records could be coming in the future. \\n\u201cThis initial release consists of material from the FBI\u2019s files related to the William J. Clinton Foundation , a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization,\u201d the site reads. \u201cThe bulk of these records come from a 2001 FBI investigation into the pardon of Marc Rich (1934-2013), aka Marcell David Reich, by President Clinton in 2001; it was closed in 2005.\u201d \\nThe FBI did not respond to a request for more information on future releases. \\nUpdate: Clinton campaign press secretary Brian Fallon questioned the release. \\nThe FBI issued a statement late Tuesday afternoon saying that the file was released in response to a FOIA request. \\n\u201cThe FBI\u2019s Records Management Division receives thousands of FOIA requests annually which are processed on a first in, first out (FIFO) basis,\u201d the statement reads. \\n\u201cBy law, FOIA materials that have been requested three or more times are posted electronically to the FBI\u2019s public reading room shortly after they are processed. Per the standard procedure for FOIA, these materials became available for release and were posted automatically and electronically to the FBI\u2019s public reading room in accordance with the law and established procedures.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742562551.644772}
