Things have gotten so out of hand that Christmas lights have now been banned so as not to offend these devout Muslims. \\nThe Swedish Transport Administration (Trafikverket) will not allow municipalities to erect Christmas street lights on light poles that the authority manages this year, which means that many towns will have no lights at all for the holiday. \\nWhat a sad time for the native Christians in Sweden. \\nTo add insult to injury, Speisa called the decision \u201ca victory for those who want to tone down the reminder of the country\u2019s Christian traditions.\u201d \\nShockingly, even though the onslaught of Islamic culture has wreaked havoc on Sweden\u2019s people and infrastructure, they want to \u201ctone down\u201d the Christian influence. How backwards is that?! \\nAuthorities appear to be trying to sweep the decision under the rug by claiming it is a matter of \u201csafety.\u201d \\n\u201cPoles are not designed for the weight of Christmas lights, and we have to remove anything that should not be there,\u201d said Eilin Isaksson, national coordinator at the Swedish Transport Administration. \\nI\u2019m not sure they\u2019re going to be fooling anyone with this \u201csafety\u201d line. If they were really so worried about that, they wouldn\u2019t be allowing millions of migrants to roam around raping their women and children. \\nMRC Blog expressed the same sentiment: \\nThis argument that lights are too heavy and pose a safety risk is complete [sic] bogus, of course. Authorities in Sweden actually expect people to believe that lights normally held up by tree branches are now too weighty to be supported by metal poles. In reality, these lights have simply been banned to avoid offending Muslim \u201crefugees.\u201d \\nYou can be sure that if Hillary Clinton is elected, we have a future similar to Sweden\u2019s to look forward to. She has privately expressed her desire for completely open borders and she kowtows to Muslims the same way President Obama does. \\nSHARE this report if you think it is utterly absurd that Sweden has banned Christmas lights to appease Muslim refugees!'"}, "time": 1742628368.6581326}
