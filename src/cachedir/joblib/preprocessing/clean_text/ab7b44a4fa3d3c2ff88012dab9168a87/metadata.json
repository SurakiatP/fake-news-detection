And as the television show\u2019s creators, the    team of Robert and Michelle King, and its star, Julianna Margulies, gathered at a SoHo hotel for an interview in   just three days after filming the 156th and final episode of the CBS drama, it was clear they hadn\u2019t quite decompressed yet. \u201cSomeone said \u2018You must feel great, you wrapped,\u2019\u201d Ms. Margulies said. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018I feel like I\u2019m in a dream.\u2019 I\u2019m not quite there yet. \u201d [ The cast of \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d on favorite moments from the show ] \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d  \u2014   initially inspired by the spectacle of     news conferences like those involving Silda Wall Spitzer, married to the disgraced governor of New York  \u2014   traced the professional and personal   of Alicia Florrick (Ms. Margulies) the wife of a discredited politician forced to resume her legal career to support her family. With wryly literate writing, complicated characters and timely explorations of issues like abortion, gun rights, gay marriage and government surveillance, the hourlong drama was an outlier among the procedurals and nighttime soap operas of the broadcast networks. And shows of its kind  \u2014   serialized dramas stretching nearly two dozen episodes each season  \u2014   may well be a vanishing breed as actors and writers tire of the grueling   filming schedules, preferring the shorter seasons of prestige cable and limited network series. The Kings\u2019 next TV endeavor is the   \u201cBrainDead\u201d on CBS this summer, a satirical   of   horror and Washington politics. During a nearly   interview, Ms. Margulies and the Kings often finished one another\u2019s sentences and joked about working together again  \u2014   on a   show about a female Stalin. In these edited excerpts, they chatted about their goals for the finale, the changes in Alicia and the challenges of shooting sex scenes for broadcast television. Earlier this year, there were rumblings that \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d might return for an eighth season even though the Kings were leaving. How did the decision to end the show come about? JULIANNA MARGULIES I felt like I was put between a rock and a hard place. I was getting messages from all over the place that if you want to keep doing the show, CBS will do it. And in the beginning of the year, Michelle and Robert came to me and said we\u2019re writing the show as if it were ending, because we\u2019re out. So suddenly I felt like I was put in this very precarious position. If I say yes, I\u2019m screwing them over, because they had a vision for the show, and it\u2019s their baby. And if I say no, the network\u2019s going to be angry, and so is the cast and the crew. But then CBS made that decision for me, and I didn\u2019t have to do a thing. David Stapf, who is the head of CBS Studios, called me and he said, \u2018The last thing that I would want of the show that has been a feather in CBS\u2019s cap for seven years is for the eighth year, without the Kings, to be the one where critics start saying they should have ended when the Kings did.\u2019 And he\u2019s right. I think they were honoring the Kings\u2019 intentions. ROBERT KING Plus, we were sabotaging things. We kept starting trash fires in the writers\u2019 room. [Everyone laughs.] Finales can be tricky endeavors, given how viewers chime in on social media. What was your vision for the ending of \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d? MICHELLE KING The only thing I\u2019ll say is that the show has always been all about Alicia. So the finale just had to honor the end of Alicia\u2019s journey. ROBERT KING One of the things we wanted to do is show how much that character had changed. Not just a   change but progressively over seven seasons. That\u2019s why there are some memories in some of the shows we\u2019ve done this year. What were the biggest changes for Alicia? MARGULIES I think her biggest change was not caring what people thought. Which enabled her to forge ahead. She stopped worrying about being the good girl, even though deep down inside that\u2019s who she\u2019ll always be, inherently. And as Alicia started to become better at her job, she managed to change who she was in her private life. MICHELLE KING I do think she\u2019s a different person. Thematically for the series, it\u2019s all about what are the consequences of even unfortunate things in your life. Alicia started with something horrible, when she was publicly humiliated. Her husband cheated on her with prostitutes. But that\u2019s what pushed her to have this new and interesting life. Is bad news always bad news? I think you\u2019ll see that question raised all over. How else did the show change during its seven seasons? MICHELLE KING In Season 1, it was more   in terms of   cases versus serialized stories. And then the show became more serialized. And it\u2019s tricky to do. There\u2019s a reason that serialized shows live more on cable and streaming than they do on network. Because it\u2019s really hard to top yourself 22 times and not get to melodrama. \u201cScandal\u201d embraces it, and good for them. They don\u2019t try to live in reality. But if you try to live in reality, like \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d does, that\u2019s a difficult thing to do. ROBERT KING You couldn\u2019t keep throwing the bombs that we could throw in the fifth season when we knew Josh Charles [who played Will Gardner, Alicia\u2019s erstwhile boss and love interest] was leaving and that we could break up Alicia and Will, knowing we were going to kill him in the 15th episode. But we couldn\u2019t kill someone every episode. That\u2019s why networks like hospital shows. There can be blood on the floor in every episode. For shows that aren\u2019t formulaic procedurals like the \u201cNCIS\u201d clan or a nighttime soap like \u201cScandal,\u201d does the departure of \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d herald an end of an era? MICHELLE KING If it is an end of an era, and I don\u2019t know if it is, it\u2019s because of the actors. The actors, rightly, don\u2019t want to work that many episodes if there\u2019s an option. To do 13 or 15 episodes and have a life, and do your best work, I think a lot of stars are now saying that\u2019s where I\u2019d like to live, please. ROBERT KING One of the reasons why networks struggle with it is because it\u2019s hard to maintain a voice with 22 episodes. So maybe it is the last, only because it\u2019s really insanely hard work. MICHELLE KING It could be that   stories remain on networks, because that\u2019s what they do really well. And I think they can be a lot of fun, these strictly procedural,   shows that don\u2019t live and die on the quality of the acting. Part of it is a puzzle element or a mystery. Julianna, what would it take for you to commit to another network show with 22 episodes a year? MARGULIES There\u2019s no amount of money in the world. ROBERT KING Is that true? Even if you like the part? MARGULIES Even if I like the part. ROBERT KING So you won\u2019t do network again, but you\u2019d do cable? MARGULIES In a heartbeat. I would do cable for sure, because it\u2019s four months. It\u2019s like doing a movie. If a network would do 11 episodes and then have a   break and then do 11 [more] I could do it. Because it\u2019s not just a commitment of time on set. I\u2019d come home at the end of a   day, I have a family to tend to, and then I have nine pages of dialogue to learn. So it just never ends. What characters or plot lines saw their arcs changed or dialed back over the course of the show? ROBERT KING Christine Baranski\u2019s character [Diane Lockhart] at the very start of the show, was supposed to be kind of the bitchy boss to Alicia. It was playing off of one premise, which is the mentor who comes to sabotage her mentee. If anybody\u2019s met Christine Baranski, though, you can only go so far with that before you embrace just how wonderful she is. She had this incredibly good funny laugh that we would hear in the dailies between the takes. Why are we sending her off in this kind of direction? Let\u2019s have other people be villains. One we cut short was because he got another job. That was Jason O\u2019Mara [who played Damian Boyle]. He was more of a gang lawyer, a little shady. What was supposed to happen was that when Will died, he was someone who really stepped up. Then he got a job, on \u201cComplications. \u201d MICHELLE KING That happened a lot, didn\u2019t it? If you\u2019re trying to do a serialized story with actors who are not your regular cast, you have to be a bit nimble. MARGULIES They had a whole idea for Oliver Platt, but then he got a series. MICHELLE KING He was a very smart, very conservative businessman, and it really allowed us to play with issues with the Diane character being such a liberal. And yet to be able to see them as intellectual equals and be very respectful of one another even when they had different opinions, that was really interesting to explore. So it was a great pity when we couldn\u2019t have access to that. ROBERT KING One of the things we wanted to pursue on the show more and more is there\u2019s a real   bias on TV, which I\u2019ve heard about. [Everyone laughs.] You watch TV, and if there\u2019s a priest, you know he\u2019s going to be a child molester. There\u2019s a predictability. It\u2019s not even trying to be propaganda for the right it\u2019s just that there should be an honest discussion that shows that for people on the other side of abortion or on the other side of gay marriage, there\u2019s an intellectual argument there. What was it like having to hew to broadcast network standards and practices? ROBERT KING There is a problem standards and practices has with thrusting. MARGULIES Did you just say thrusting? ROBERT KING The thrusting issue. And we would have to delicately go around problems of thrusting in   that anybody would have. We\u2019d even have to morph images because we wouldn\u2019t get a take that was clean of thrusting. But it was kind of amazing how much CBS let us do. The first episode of the second season was about oral sex. What did the departure of Josh Charles allow you to do differently? ROBERT KING The loss of Josh seemed like it would be catastrophic to us, but I thought it gave us a new lease on who Alicia was, with the underpinning of mourning. How does a [series] show the fact of someone dying, as opposed to a lot of these shows that kill off someone every week? Is there any merit to the rumblings of a feud between Julianna and Archie Panjabi [who played the private investigator Kalinda Sharma] that they didn\u2019t film their scenes together toward the end of her run on the show? MARGULIES It\u2019s all silly gossip, and I don\u2019t want to go there. If the show were to continue, what are some of the issues that you would want to deal with? ROBERT KING Trump and populism. How American democracy is veering a little more toward European populism, both on the left and on the right. The right wing is tending to be   and the left is looking toward socialism. MICHELLE KING I was just stumbling over the fact that there are certain companies that have manifestoes online about how proud they are for the number of people they fire. And I just thought, oh, that\u2019s an episode. And yet there are no more to write. And if there were one more plotline for Alicia, what would it be? MARGULIES One of the things I found interesting this year was what Eli [the political adviser to Peter Florrick] kept saying, that Alicia\u2019s the star. Because Alicia doesn\u2019t see herself that way, at all. So even though there was this jilted run for state\u2019s attorney that she got thrown under the bus for, I would love to see how far that could go. Especially in the environment of Hillary [Clinton] right now, I think that would be really interesting.'"}, "time": 1742563585.130686}
