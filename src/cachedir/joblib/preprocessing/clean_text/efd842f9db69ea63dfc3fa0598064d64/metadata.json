Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general, pledged on Tuesday to \u201csay no\u201d to Mr. Trump if he tries to go beyond the law, and he spoke out against torture, a ban on Muslim immigration and other ideas that had been floated by Mr. Trump. Mr. Sessions, a deeply conservative Republican from Alabama who was an early Trump supporter, appears headed for confirmation after completing more than nine hours of testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Mr. Sessions and his allies had girded for a coordinated attack on his civil rights record, but Democrats tempered their criticism and Republicans mounted a   defense, describing him repeatedly as a man of integrity. In his two decades on Capitol Hill, Mr. Sessions has questioned whether the Constitution guarantees citizenship to anyone born in the United States, has said courts have interpreted the separation of church and state too broadly and has declared   marriage a threat to American culture. He also voted against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. Much of the hearing focused on Mr. Sessions\u2019s long record as a prosecutor and a senator, but Mr. Trump proved a dominant figure in absentia for much of the debate as Democrats sought to question the   by proxy. They asked whether Mr. Sessions supported Mr. Trump\u2019s most controversial statements and questioned whether he had the independence to rein in the   Mr. Trump if he seeks to exceed his presidential authority. In his cool, Southern drawl, Mr. Sessions vowed repeatedly that he would, saying that an attorney general \u201ccannot be a mere rubber stamp\u201d for the president. \u201cIf an attorney general is asked to do something that\u2019s plainly unlawful,\u201d he said, \u201cthat person would have to resign ultimately before agreeing to execute a policy that the attorney general believes would be unlawful or unconstitutional. \u201d But he indicated that he did not believe he would reach that impasse. If he advises Mr. Trump that a policy is illegal, he said, \u201cI am confident that he would\u201d heed that advice. A Methodist, he also pledged to set aside his personal beliefs and aggressively enforce all federal laws  \u2014   even in areas like abortion, gay rights and hate crimes where he has made his opposition well known. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be hard for me to be impartial and enforce laws that I didn\u2019t vote for,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I can separate my personal votes of maybe years ago from what my responsibilities is today. \u201d He was asked, for instance, about a law he opposed in the Senate making attacks based on sexual orientation a hate crime. \u201cThe law has been passed, the Congress has spoken, and you can be sure I will enforce it,\u201d Mr. Sessions said. Many of Mr. Sessions\u2019s answers appeared calculated to distance himself from some of Mr. Trump\u2019s most contentious threats and pledges on the campaign trail. He said, for instance, that current law \u201cabsolutely\u201d bans waterboarding and the use of other torture techniques against prisoners  \u2014   even though Mr. Trump promised to reinstitute the practice and Mr. Sessions himself supported it for years. Asked about last week\u2019s report by intelligence agencies that Russia tried to influence the American election, he said that \u201cI have no reason to doubt that and no information that would indicate otherwise\u201d  \u2014   a sharp contrast from Mr. Trump\u2019s weeks of skepticism. Mr. Trump last week called the uproar over Russia\u2019s role a \u201cpolitical witch hunt. \u201d He said he also opposed creating a registry of American Muslims or banning Muslim immigrants, as Mr. Trump proposed repeatedly during the campaign in response to terrorist attacks. \u201cI have no belief and do not support the idea that Muslims as a religious group should be denied admission to the United States,\u201d Mr. Sessions said. But he said he supported using \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of immigrants that might take into account religious beliefs  \u2014   an idea Mr. Trump now appears to have endorsed. Mr. Sessions also appeared to play down the prospects that his Justice Department would seek to jail Hillary Clinton over her private email server, another pledge that Mr. Trump made repeatedly during the campaign. Mr. Sessions surprised lawmakers by declaring that he would recuse himself from any decisions on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails or the Clinton Foundation because he said that critical statements he made about her during the campaign might pose a conflict. Mr. Sessions had previously supported appointing a special prosecutor to investigate Mrs. Clinton. The F. B. I. \u2019s investigation into her private email server is closed, and while a preliminary investigation into the Clinton Foundation is open, senior law enforcement officials say there is little basis for the case to move forward. He deflected questions about Mr. Trump with a calm stoicism, but he grew angry and emotional when Democrats pressed him on a more personal matter: accusations of racial insensitivity toward his employees and others as a federal prosecutor, which doomed his nomination for a federal judgeship in 1986. Protesters in the ornate Senate hearing room, who disrupted the proceedings more than a dozen times during the day, erupted in chants of \u201cSessions is a racist!\u201d and \u201cNo Trump, no K. K. K. no fascist U. S. A. !\u201d Two men dressed as Klansmen in white robes and hoods shouted their mocking support for Mr. Sessions before security officers hustled them out of the room. With his voice rising, Mr. Sessions called accusations that he had made racist remarks in the 1980s \u201cdamnably false. \u201d Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a Republican friend who introduced Mr. Sessions for the hearing, came to his defense, pointing to Mr. Sessions\u2019s prosecution of Klan members in an Alabama murder and his appointment of the first   chief counsel to the Judiciary Committee\u2019s Republican staff. \u201cThese are not the actions of an individual motivated by racial animus,\u201d she said. Mr. Sessions was the first senator to endorse Mr. Trump\u2019s   presidential bid in early 2016, and they bonded over their shared agreement that immigration had had devastating effects on working people. While Mr. Sessions sought to distance himself on Tuesday from some of Mr. Trump\u2019s controversial stances, he embraced the  \u2019s focus on toughened immigration laws and a \u201claw and order\u201d agenda  \u2014   priorities he himself has stressed for years. He promised to escalate federal arrests and prosecutions of undocumented immigrants, drug dealers, gun traffickers and violent criminals in response to a rise in crime in some cities, and he declared that \u201cprotecting the American people from the scourge of radical Islamic terrorism will continue to be a top priority. \u201d Critical to that agenda, he said, will be improving federal relations with the police after the intense scrutiny that has followed a string of   police shootings of black men, often unarmed. \u201cLaw enforcement as a whole has been unfairly maligned and blamed for the unacceptable actions of a few of their bad actors,\u201d Mr. Sessions said. \u201cThey believe the political leadership in the country has abandoned them. \u201d Indeed, Mr. Sessions questioned the Obama administration\u2019s use of civil rights lawsuits and consent decrees to force changes in training and    policies at police departments that have been accused of unconstitutional tactics. Although Mr. Sessions has completed his testimony, the hearings will continue on Wednesday with testimony by advocates on both sides. Witnesses supporting Mr. Sessions will include former Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey and Larry Thompson, a former deputy attorney general. Testifying against him will be officials from the American Civil Liberties Union and the N. A. A. C. P. as well as Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, a rare case of a senator testifying against a colleague.'"}, "time": 1742563131.5372636}
