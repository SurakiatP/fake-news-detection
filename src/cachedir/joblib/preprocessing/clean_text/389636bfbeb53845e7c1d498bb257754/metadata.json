If this proves true, then Trump becomes Obama in 2008 faster than a sportscar goes from 0-to-60. \\nMeanwhile, there will be many appointments, and it would be difficult for any president, no matter how well meaning, to hold onto the image and promises they conveyed during campaign time after going through the gauntlet of hiring America\u2019s most powerful axe-men. It is our duty to stay focused on these individuals and pressure Trump to dump or block the worst of these appointments. \\nOnce again, we see the worst and most dangerous elite insiders looking for yet another bailout in the form of jobs, appointment and power over the levers of government policies \u2013 climbing back onto the government lifeboat (now in the Trump administration) while working to swamp the rest of the struggling passengers who were on-board the U.S.S. Titanicamerica. A new Captain still can\u2019t stop this trainwreck, even if any change is welcome. A real #drainingtheswamp would be a great start, but early signs cast doubt on that happening. \\nThis was the exact rationale for \u201cThe Obama Deception\u201d expose at the start of Obama \u2013 it\u2019s a deception because it\u2019s a brand new face frontin\u2019 for the same ol\u2019 gang \u2013 and people are slow to catch on, and even less willing to admit they got conned. Is Trump the new Obama for the alt right/populist uprising to keep them complacent and blow off enough steam to avert a destabilizing revolution? \\nThe Obama Deception HQ Full length version\\n\\nDraining the Swamp? Wall Street is Already Loving Donald Trump \\nby Michael Krieger\\nBefore we move forward, let\u2019s start with the following extraordinarily disturbing report out of CNBC :\\nIn the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s upset victory, advisors to the president-elect have floated the possibility of naming JPMorgan Chase chief Jamie Dimon Treasury secretary, according to two people familiar with the matter, but one of them added that Dimon said he would not be interested in the role. \\nA Trump spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment, and a spokesman for Dimon declined to elaborate beyond his past remarks that he would not be interested in the job. \\nFirst off, I want to say that the above isn\u2019t confirmed. If it\u2019s totally false, the Trump campaign should come out with a quick and vehement denial. I sincerely hope that happens.\\nThat said, the report is cause for serious concern. Why? Because Trump\u2019s reluctance to go after Wall Street was apparent throughout his entire campaign (as opposed to Bernie Sanders), and it was one of the main reasons I could never get comfortable with him. I wrote several posts where I articulated my concerns, but here\u2019s an excerpt from one of them, Donald Trump\u2019s True Colors Emerge as He Snuggles up to Wall Street :\\nWhile I\u2019m not a Dodd-Frank fan, it\u2019s not because it was too harsh, but because it didn\u2019t really do much of anything. It was the typical neoliberal bait and switch, designed to look tough for public consumption, while merely making tweaks around the edges of a financial system that requires systemic, paradigm level change. \\nTrump\u2019s support of repealing Dodd-Frank tells you all you need to know. A Trump Presidency will see Wall Street felons who should be in prison, running as wild and free as ever. \\nHe will be the same thing to distressed working class whites that Obama was to the black community. A fake messiah and a shyster. \\nRead that last line over and over again until you understand it. If it is true that Trump considered the CEO of the largest \u201cToo Big To Fail\u201d and \u201cToo Big to Jail\u201d U.S. bank for Treasury Secretary, we can be pretty much assured that Donald Trump is the Republican version of Barack Obama. A fraud who talked a good game in order to get elected, but who will be a willing pawn of crony corporations and Wall Street. You can\u2019t drain the swamp by surrounding yourself with the swamp. \\nIf I don\u2019t hear a denial about this rumor, I will assume it\u2019s true, which means Trump and I are off to a very bad start. Whether Dimon takes the role or not (I doubt it), is irrelevant. Merely considering Dimon tells you all you need to know about the types of status quo people who are likely to surround President Trump.\\nAs I warned in yesterday\u2019s post, Americans Roll the Dice With President Donald Trump , \\nPeople = Policy \\nTrump will be a failure unless he brings the right people into his inner circle. This is of the utmost importance. Indeed, I knew for certain Obama was a total fraud the moment he appointed Larry Summers and Timothy Geithner to key positions within his administration. This is the area I think Trump is most vulnerable to making some very big mistakes. Indeed, I was very bothered by the effusive compliments he showered upon one of the nation\u2019s worst political figures, Chris Christie, during this victory speech. \\nIf Trump really wants to shake things up, he needs to think outside of the box and look far beyond the Chris Christies of the world, and consider some very sharp people he\u2019s never heard of. If he surrounds himself with the old, tired political characters we already know, I fear very little will change for the better. \\nYou can\u2019t get more inside the box, status quo than Jamie Dimon. Period. Which brings me to a conspiracy theory about the whole thing. I think there\u2019s a remote possibility that the Trump campaign leaked this themselves with the hope that he can then appoint his preferred candidate, former Goldman Sachs partner, Steve Mnuchin, with little outrage. That\u2019s typical Donald Trump behavior. People will then say, \u201cwell at least it\u2019s not Jamie Dimon.\u201d Unfortunately, Steve Mnuchin would be a terrible choice too. As we learned in the post, A Nation of Sheep, Afraid of Words :\\nMnuchin\u2019s presence in the campaign reveals how the qualities Trump loyalists projected on their hero don\u2019t measure up to the truth. They have venerated him throughout the Republican primary for rejecting the dirty business of pay-to-play politics, and for populist vows to protect the ordinary worker. But in selecting Mnuchin, not only has Trump submitted to the realities of presidential campaign finance; he\u2019s chosen one of the most notorious bankers in America to carry it out. \\nWhen I heard Mnuchin\u2019s name last week, I immediately remembered the front lawn of his mansion. Back in 2011, local housing activists and the Occupy movement in Los Angeles camped out on that lawn to save the home of Rose Mary Gudiel, a La Puente, California, resident who faced eviction after being just two weeks late on one mortgage payment. The activists threatened to move all of Gudiel\u2019s furniture into Mnuchin\u2019s $26 million Bel Air estate if the eviction wasn\u2019t stopped. Twenty police officers and a helicopter met the protesters. \\nThe OneWest subsidiary Financial Freedom executed 39 percent of all foreclosures on reverse mortgages between 2009 and 2015, despite servicing only 17 percent of the market, according to data from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) obtained by the California Reinvestment Coalition. OneWest disclosed in its most recent annual report that it\u2019s under investigation for this disproportionate share of \u201cwidow foreclosures\u201d by HUD\u2019s Inspector General. The victims include 103 year-old Myrtle Lewis of North Texas, who OneWest put into foreclosure after her insurance coverage lapsed; Karen Hunziker , who got a foreclosure notice from OneWest ten days after her husband passed away in 2014; and a host of others . \\nTrump\u2019s loyal fans aren\u2019t likely to scrutinize Mnuchin\u2019s record, but they should. You can measure political candidates in part by who they associate with. The foreclosure history in Mnuchin\u2019s past reflects an extreme mentality of profit at all costs, and hardly a viewpoint of standing up for the little guy. Trump as populist was always something of a pose, covering for a deep nationalism and antipathy to immigrants. The Mnuchin pick just brings that into sharper relief. \\nMeanwhile, what was Mnuchin doing right before the election? Why he was the personal guest of Blackstone head Steve Schwarzman at the New York Public Library\u2019s Lions gala. \\nBloomberg reported:\\nSteve Schwarzman, who\u2019s declined to say which presidential candidate he\u2019s voting for, spent Monday night two seats away from Trump finance chair Steven Mnuchin, a possibility for treasury secretary if Trump wins. \\nThe setting was the New York Public Library\u2019s Library Lions gala, where the Rose Main Reading Room\u2019s tables were covered in gold cloth, the place mats were made of gold paper laser-cut to resemble the rosettes on the room\u2019s ceiling, and the books were lit with spotlights. \\nMnuchin was Schwarzman\u2019s guest \u2014 an experience sort of like hanging with Donald Trump in Trump Tower: The gala took place in the library\u2019s Stephen A. Schwarzman Building. The New York Public Library includes this flagship center for collections and exhibitions, as well as more than 80 branch libraries where children learn to read, teens do homework and job-seekers work on their resumes. \\nHere\u2019s a photo of Trump\u2019s \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d finance chair hanging with billionaire private equity mogul Schwarzman.\\n\\nSteve Schwarzman\u2026you know that name don\u2019t you? Of course you do. He\u2019s the guy that said the following about the threat to repeal the carried interest loophole:\\nWord of mouth says that Blackstone founder Steve Schwarzman got suddenly very passionate when talking about tax hikes in July. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s a war.\u201d \\n\u201cIt\u2019s like when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939.\u201d \\nWith that in mind, it\u2019s no surprise that Schwarzman had the following to say in Davos earlier this year. From the post, Billionaire CEO of Blackstone Trolls the American Public \u2013 He Doesn\u2019t Get Why People Are Angry :\\n\u201cI find the whole thing astonishing and what\u2019s remarkable is the amount of anger whether it\u2019s on the Republican side or the Democratic side,\u201d the Wall Street mogul said at the World Economic Forum in Davos. \u201cBernie Sanders, to me, is almost more stunning than some of what\u2019s going on in the Republican side. How is that happening, why is that happening?\u201d \\nThis is the guy Trump\u2019s finance chair was hanging with a day before the election . You don\u2019t get more status quo than Steve Schwarzman. While we\u2019re at it, here are just a few examples of what Blackstone\u2019s been up to since the financial crisis:\\nAmerica Meet Your New Slumlord: Wall Street \\nA Closer Look at the Decrepit World of Wall Street Rental Homes \\nLeaked Documents Show How Blackstone Fleeces Taxpayers via Public Pension Funds \\nMeanwhile, I think the performance of Wall Street shares since the election tells you all you need to know.\\n\\n\\nTo conclude, this article is primarily written for all my readers who are either Trump supporters, or who reluctantly voted for him. My message to you is that we need to hold this man\u2019s feet to the fire. The election is over, and you got your desired outcome. Now is not the time to be a cheerleader. Now is not the time to behave exactly like Obama zombies did after he became an obvious betrayal. What allowed Obama to do all the bad things he did, was the fact that his supporters made endless excuses for him. Don\u2019t make excuses for Trump. If you do, your life will get a lot worse and this country will decay far more into an authoritarian oligarchy than it already has. It is up to you to make sure he doesn\u2019t become the Wall Street puppet I always feared he would be.\\nRemember the timeless words of Mark Twain and please take heed.\\n\\nThis isn\u2019t the time for playing around. This isn\u2019t the time for looking the other way. You voted him in to take down the status quo system. Make sure he does it. \\nIn Liberty,\\nMichael Krieger\\nThis article was written by Michael Krieger of Liberty Blitzkrieg.com .
