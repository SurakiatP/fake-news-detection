Trump found a new line to cross on Wednesday, when he said at a news conference that Russia should hack his opponent, Hillary Clinton. \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30, 000 emails that are missing,\u201d Mr. Trump said, in reference to the private email server Mrs. Clinton used while she was secretary of state. \u201cI think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. \u201d There is simply no precedent for this: A presidential candidate publicly appealing to a foreign adversary to intervene in the election on his behalf. \u201cThis is unprecedented  \u2014   it is one of those things that seems to be genuinely new in international relations,\u201d said Paul Musgrave, a University of Massachusetts professor who studies American foreign policy. After a long pause, Mr. Musgrave added, \u201cBeing shocked into speechlessness is not the sort of thing you\u2019re really used to in the business of foreign policy analysis. \u201d As part of an investigation into her private server, Mrs. Clinton handed over 30, 000 emails to the State Department. But she deleted a similar number of emails that she said were unrelated to her work at the department. American presidential elections are   events. Russia would not be the first foreign power, friendly or hostile, to pursue its preferred outcome. Nor would Mr. Trump be the first politician to leverage foreign actors for electoral benefit. But this is the first time that a presidential candidate has openly asked a foreign power to meddle in the democratic process to his benefit. More than that, Mr. Trump seemed to be suggesting that Russia should violate United States law on his behalf. Were Russia to follow Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion, the foreign intervention into American politics would be among the most severe of the past century. In 1940, as the United States debated whether to enter World War II, British spies disseminated rumors to discredit prominent American isolationists and worked to promote politicians who favored intervention. When President Jimmy Carter ran for   in 1980, he lost in part because he had failed to secure the freedom of 52 American hostages held in Iran. They were released on the day of Ronald Reagan\u2019s inauguration. Iranian negotiators later told the journalist Mark Bowden that they had stalled to deliberately hurt Mr. Carter, as punishment for his having sheltered the former Iranian shah. Nations pursue their interests, whether other countries like it or not. Great powers in particular, including the United States, often meddle in foreign elections. But such operations are conducted in secret because they are hostile acts, meant to subvert the will of the targeted country\u2019s population and the sanctity of its institutions. Mr. Trump, in openly inviting such foreign interference, was undercutting one of the most fundamental national interests of a democratic state. \u201cNobody ever  \u2014   and I think I can be confident about this  \u2014   nobody ever stood up at a podium and said, \u2018Bring it on,\u2019\u201d said Jeremy Shapiro, a Brookings Institution scholar of foreign policy, referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s invitation for a foreign power to meddle in his own country\u2019s politics. Though rare, previous American politicians have looked abroad for help with votes at home. In 1968, as President Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s administration tried to broker peace talks in Vietnam, a Republican activist encouraged South Vietnamese officials to resist the talks, which they did. The activist, who represented herself as speaking for the Republican presidential candidate, Richard M. Nixon, said Mr. Nixon would get South Vietnam a better deal. According to documents that were later declassified, a South Vietnamese official was recorded as saying that his government had refused to participate in the talks as a way \u201cto help Nixon. \u201d More recently, in 2012, the Republican presidential challenger, Mitt Romney, cultivated ties with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. While Mr. Netanyahu did not explicitly endorse Mr. Romney, he frequently voiced his acute dissatisfaction with President Obama in comments to the American news media. Three years later, as Mr. Obama tried to strike a nuclear deal with Iran, congressional Republicans invited Mr. Netanyahu to condemn the proposed accord in a speech to Congress. While this arguably violated the norms of foreign policy by circumventing the White House on a matter of foreign relations, and by inviting an ally to intervene against the president in a domestic political dispute, Mr. Trump went a large step further in soliciting an adversary, and encouraging it to violate United States law on his behalf. In the hours after Mr. Trump\u2019s statement, foreign policy and legal analysts struggled to articulate the scale of his deviation from political norms. William Inboden, a University of Texas professor who served on President George W. Bush\u2019s National Security Council, told Politico the comments were \u201can assault on the Constitution\u201d and \u201ctantamount to treason. \u201d Carl Bildt, the former Swedish prime minister and foreign minister, wrote on Twitter, \u201cI never thought a serious candidate for US President could be a serious threat against the security of the West. But that\u2019s where we are. \u201d It is doubtful that Russia will alter its espionage practices based on public suggestions from Mr. Trump, which some defenders argue was meant as a joke. But Mr. Musgrave worried that such language could weaken norms, even if only slightly, against foreign involvement in American politics. \u201cTrump is legitimating behaviors that nobody ever thought could be legitimated,\u201d Mr. Musgrave said, calling the incident \u201cone of those reminders about how fragile norms are. \u201d Mr. Shapiro, the Brookings Institution scholar, sounded physically exhausted by Mr. Trump\u2019s comments and suggested they were driven by something more banal than collusion with a foreign power. \u201cTo me what it demonstrates is not that he\u2019s necessarily in cahoots with the Russians, or that he\u2019s intending to commit treason or sway the election by this act, but that he just has no sense of what the norms are,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said, adding: \u201cHe has no sense of what an extraordinary statement that was. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563242.3143926}
