Trump, even as a candidate, had elevated the dangers confronting American allies and military personnel overseas. Mr. Biden said that on a trip to Kosovo and Serbia this week, he would be compelled to \u201creassure\u201d allies that the United States would honor its commitment to NATO, given Mr. Trump\u2019s comments saying he would reassess the arrangement if elected. \u201cBecause they\u2019re worried,\u201d Mr. Biden said, in his first campaign appearance beside Hillary Clinton. He added that if his son Beau, who died of brain cancer last year, were still serving in Iraq, he would advise him that the danger had increased \u201ca couple clicks\u201d because of Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks, which have included the suggestion that President Obama was the \u201cfounder\u201d of the Islamic State. \u201cThis guy\u2019s shame has no limits,\u201d he said. Mr. Biden suggested Mr. Trump had demonstrated a fondness for brutal leaders like Saddam Hussein  \u2014   \u201cHe would have loved Stalin,\u201d Mr. Biden said twice  \u2014   and repeatedly reminded the crowd of the stakes. \u201cThere\u2019s a guy that follows me, right back here, has the nuclear codes,\u201d Mr. Biden said at one point. Mr. Trump is so reckless, the vice president said, that if his late son had planned to enlist in a Trump administration, \u201cI would have thrown my body in front of him. \u201d For Mr. Biden, after nearly eight years in the nation\u2019s chief supporting role, the appearance hinted at the niche he sees for himself as Election Day nears: a figure who can argue, plainly and personally, that Mr. Trump has already imperiled the nation he aspires to lead. It was also a glimpse at the campaign that wasn\u2019t  \u2014   the earned folksiness, the willingness to test audience stamina, the years of practice at appearing unpracticed  \u2014   laying bare the strengths and tics of a   candidate who decided last year against challenging the woman he spent Monday embracing. He mustered characteristic zeal to hold forth on American greatness and sacrifice. He interrupted himself at one point to wave to his family, arranging aloud for a future hug. He appeared to make an   joke about an old house of his in Scranton. For much of the   performance  \u2014   with sleeves rolled slightly and any prepared text doomed to be ignored  \u2014   Mr. Biden assured his hometown\u2019s residents that Mrs. Clinton was \u201cmade of the same stuff,\u201d even if she could not always show it. \u201cMaybe the difference between the Irish Catholic and the Methodist,\u201d he wondered aloud, comparing himself to Mrs. Clinton from behind the   seal. \u201cWe wear everything on our sleeve!\u201d Since announcing in October that he would not seek the presidency, Mr. Biden has been a loyal Democratic lieutenant, taking care to praise Mrs. Clinton in public and rousing Democrats with a vintage address at the party\u2019s national convention last month. But their   relationship has more often been defined by an intense rivalry in private  \u2014   a predictable tension, perhaps, for two figures who have long imagined themselves in the nation\u2019s top job. As he considered a run last year, still grieving his son\u2019s death, Mr. Biden felt slighted as the party establishment fell in line behind Mrs. Clinton, viewing himself as the natural heir to President Obama\u2019s legacy. In conversations with donors, Mr. Biden expressed astonishment at Mrs. Clinton\u2019s handling of questions over her private email server. At times last year, people close to the vice president said, the mere mention of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s name could make him fume. \u201cThey were professionals, but also competitors,\u201d William M. Daley, President Obama\u2019s former chief of staff, said of their time in the administration. \u201cThey\u2019d do the dance. There was respect there, but Joe considered himself the expert on foreign policy. \u201d Asked if largely watching the campaign from the sidelines had been hard for Mr. Biden, Mr. Daley said: \u201cOf course. He wanted to run. \u201d Yet in their first joint campaign appearance on Monday, in the city where both claim roots  \u2014   Mrs. Clinton\u2019s father also grew up here, as she said at the outset  \u2014   any lingering rancor was well concealed. They took the stage to Bruce Springsteen\u2019s \u201cThe Rising,\u201d with Mrs. Clinton clapping the beat. Mr. Biden settled in a chair behind her, turning back to smile at the crowd. Mrs. Clinton introduced him as \u201ca fighter for families\u201d and a passionate advocate. She said, if elected, she would ask Mr. Biden to continue to help lead a \u201ccancer moonshot\u201d initiative at the White House. She even brandished a few retail politicking touches that Mr. Biden might appreciate, describing her own christening \u201cat the Methodist church on Court Street,\u201d recalling summer visits to Lake Winola and detailing her grandfather\u2019s time at the Scranton Lace mill. She said her father had \u201cliterally hopped a freight train from Scranton to Chicago\u201d to find work, deploying Mr. Biden\u2019s favorite adverb, if perhaps unwittingly. She heaped praise on local officials, including \u201cyour amazing Lackawanna County recorder of deeds,\u201d and spoke deferentially of her time in the \u201c  cabinet. \u201d And in an attack on Mr. Trump, Mrs. Clinton  \u2014   a speaker so formal that she often ignores contractions in prepared text to deliver them as two words  \u2014   set off on a   flourish of her own. She was discussing Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion that he provides child care services. In fact, Mrs. Clinton said, those benefits apply only to the pampered guests at some Trump properties  \u2014   not to his workers. \u201cJust sayin\u2019,\u201d she added. Repeatedly, the complex filled with chants for the two, with signs of \u201cWelcome home, Joe!\u201d or, simply, \u201cJoe\u201d shooting into view. Mr. Biden, recalling weekly breakfasts with Mrs. Clinton, described himself as her \u201cObama whisperer. \u201d \u201cShe\u2019d look at me and say, \u2018What did he mean by that? \u2019\u201d Mr. Biden said, often clutching the lectern with two hands. Often, Mr. Biden conspicuously interrupted himself, as if bantering with his own notes. \u201cI really mean this,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not a joke. \u201d But sometimes it was. Shortly after taking the stage, he meandered through an anecdote about a former home. \u201cI was there when I was running, and up in the bedroom, written on the wall is one of those, \u2018Joe Biden slept here,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThen it said, \u2018lived here. \u2019\u201d He held for a beat: \u201cGlad they added the \u2018lived here\u2019 part. \u201d Chuckles filled the space, where Mr. Biden had appeared with Mrs. Clinton eight years earlier to campaign for President Obama. For about 30 minutes, the people were rapt. Then a child cried audibly. \u201cI am testing your stamina,\u201d Mr. Biden said, smiling once more. He wrapped up.'"}, "time": 1742561757.1760774}
