The bodies of seven members of the Rhoden family were found before 8 a. m. in three houses near each other in southwestern Pike County, the county sheriff, Charles Reader, said. Three children  \u2014   ages 4 days, 6 months and 3 years  \u2014   were found in the houses unharmed, the sheriff said. A few hours later, another family member was found dead in another house a few miles away. Officials said at a   news conference that they could not rule out the possibility that other members of the family might be in danger, and that officers were checking on them throughout the region. \u201cWe are advising the family members to be very careful, and take particular precaution,\u201d the Ohio attorney general, Mike DeWine, said. \u201cThe individual or individuals who committed this crime obviously are dangerous,\u201d Mr. DeWine said. \u201cWe believe they are still at large. \u201d County officials said some members of the extended family had gathered and were receiving counseling and protection. The dead included seven adults and a    boy officials had said earlier that two of the victims were juveniles. \u201cEach one of the victims appears to have been executed,\u201d Mr. DeWine said. \u201cEach one appears to be shot in the head. \u201d Asked if investigators had any indication of a motive, he said, \u201cnone. \u201d Officials said it was also unclear when the killings took place. \u201cWe have victims who were in bed\u201d when shot, he said. \u201cThe one mom was killed in her bed with the    right there. \u201d At first, officials said they could not rule out the possibility that the gunman was among the dead. But later, Mr. DeWine said, \u201cthe preliminary determination has been made that none of the eight individuals committed suicide. \u201d Officials declined to give the first names of any of the victims. Phil Fulton, the pastor of the nearby Union Hill Church, told local television stations that he knew the victims, and they included a woman, her children and her grandchildren. The state Bureau of Criminal Investigation, part of the attorney general\u2019s office, took over the investigation, and Mr. DeWine said the bureau had sent more than 30 investigators to Pike County. The killings took place in a hilly, sparsely populated area of southern Ohio, about 70 miles east of Cincinnati and a similar distance south of Columbus. Sheriff Reader said the initial call to his office came in at 7:53 a. m. reporting two people dead in a house. When deputies arrived, someone flagged them down and told them to check two other houses nearby. The sheriff declined to say who called his office, or how that person had discovered the killings.'"}, "time": 1742628423.2101328}
