[Ray Dalio, who runs the $150 billion dollar hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, published a lengthy paper  on Wednesday that analyzes the role of populism in today\u2019s world and in history. Populism is now at its highest level since the 1930s, according to the paper, \u201cPopulism: The Phenomenon. \u201d  \u201cWe believe that populism\u2019s role in shaping economic conditions will probably be more powerful than classic monetary and fiscal policies (as well as a big influence on fiscal policies),\u201d Dalio and three Bridgewater colleagues write.  Bridgewater is the world\u2019s largest hedge fund. The paper introduces a \u201cDeveloped World Populism Index,\u201d which Dalio says measures the strength of populism over time. It\u2019s a weighted index of the vote share of   parties or candidates in national elections for major developed countries since 1900. The index shows that populism is now at its highest level since the early 1930s. Contemporary populism includes supporters of Donald Trump, UKIP in the UK, AfD in Germany, National Front in France, Podemos in Spain and Five Star Movement in Italy. The bulk of the study focuses on the history of populism, focussing on 14 leaders from the past in 10 different countries. Current populists aren\u2019t examined in detail because \u201cthe stories of the ones in power or possibly coming to power are still being written,\u201d Dalio writes. \u201cPopulism is a political and social phenomenon that arises from the common man, typically not   being fed up with 1) wealth and opportunity gaps, 2) perceived cultural threats from those with different values in the country and from outsiders, the \u201cestablishment elites\u201d in positions of power, and 4) government not working effectively for them,\u201d according to Dalio. \u201cIn other words, populism is a rebellion of the common man against the elites and, to some extend, against the system. \u201d Dalio has changed his view on Trump a few times. In the weeks after the election, Dalio said his view of Trump was \u201cbroadly positive. \u201d Speaking in Davos, Switzerland in January, he said that he believed there was \u201can optimistic possibility\u201d that Trump\u2019s policies would stimulate the U. S. economy. More recently, however, he has been fretting over possible downsides of Trump\u2019s populism. And now? \u201cWe have more questions than answers about him and are using these other cases to assess him against by seeing if he follows a more archetypical path [of populists past] or if he deviates from it significantly,\u201d Dalio writes.'"}, "time": 1742628456.279372}
