Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is \u201c\u201d said a Chicago alderman. [The flyer that resembles a \u201cWanted Poster\u201d says \u201cCALL      TO REPORT ILLEGALS. \u201d The poster adds, \u201cHelp Atty. General Jeff Sessions Help US Black People. \u201d It says in large bold letters with ice caps on the tops of the letters  \u2014   \u201cICE EM. \u201d  The public notice claims that a reward of \u201c$$$$$$$$ 000 Per Illegal Reported $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$\u201d is available. \u201cThe flyer offers the outrageous and baseless claims that Latino immigrants are taking jobs away from   Chicagoans,\u201d Chicago Alderman Raymond Lopez told DNA Info. He urged, \u201cDon\u2019t fall for this phony argument. \u201d The placard states, \u201cSanctuary city Policies endanger the lively hood of every [A]merican, while violating federal law and destroying the black community. \u201d The flyer continues: Studies done by the Democratic Black Caucus have found that illegal immigrants create a burden on the black community and economy, majority are paid under the table. 72% of illegals have jobs biggest in construction and factory work, right here in Chicago. Alderman Lopez says he represents Blacks and Hispanics in the 15th Ward and called the flyer \u201ca fraud\u201d and \u201can effort by some nameless entity to divide us and get people to sell their own neighbors, like Judas Iscariot, for a few pieces of silver. We all know how history remembers Judas. \u201d The flyers have appeared in Englewood and Roseland and near a West Pullman construction site and on the West Side, DNA Info reported. Fox 32 reported that a spokesperson with ICE said the phone number is a correct tip line but called the flyer \u201cfake. \u201d \u201cThese flyers, stickers, and posters are not issued by or sanctioned by ICE. These fake flyers are similar to the recent rash of false reports involving purported ICE checkpoints and random sweeps these reports are dangerous and irresponsible. \u201d Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.
