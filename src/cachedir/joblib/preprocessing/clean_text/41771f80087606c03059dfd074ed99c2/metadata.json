Those movie buffs familiar only with Mr. Chan\u2019s appearances in blockbusters like the \u201cRush Hour\u201d trilogy and \u201cShanghai Noon\u201d may not realize just how long a career the Hong Kong native has had as an actor, director and producer. Mr. Chan, 62, who began acting when he was very young, has wowed audiences the world over not only with the balletic,   \u201cDrunken Master\u201d techniques in his early kung fu movies, but also with the complex action sequences and comedic timing that gave his career a long arc. And he has broken many bones doing it, he said, since he has done his own stunts. According to IMDB, the online film website, he has appeared in 134 films as an actor. But if you count his directing, producing and writing, as well, his film credits may number well over 200, as he noted when accepting the Honorary Oscar. \u201cAfter 56 years in the film industry, making more than 200 films  \u2014   I break so many bones  \u2014   finally, this is mine,\u201d he said, shaking the golden statue. In his acceptance speech, a beaming Mr. Chan told a story about a time his father asked when he was going to win an Academy Award. \u201cDad, I only make   movies,\u201d Mr. Chan recalled saying. He told how he had become obsessed with the award after seeing one at the home of Sylvester Stallone, and recounted his disbelief upon hearing that he had finally received it. Mr. Chan was among a roster of artists to receive the Honorary Academy Award, whose recipients were announced in September. It\u2019s given to celebrate \u201cextraordinary achievement\u201d and \u201cexceptional contributions\u201d over the course of a filmmaker\u2019s career, and it was roundly celebrated on social media. A comment from Lucius Hale, a    from Kristiansand, Norway, was typical. \u201cI\u2019m really glad that Jackie Chan got an Oscar,\u201d he said. \u201cThat man has been part of my life so long, and his movies are so goood. \u201d Others celebrated Mr. Chan\u2019s status as a trailblazing Asian actor in American films. It was difficult to find anyone on Twitter questioning whether Mr. Chan had earned the award. But for anyone who has doubts about Mr. Chan\u2019s skill onscreen, here are five clips that, together, illustrate some of his most impressive work. 1. The scene is from \u201cDrunken Master,\u201d a breakout film for Mr. Chan, which became a cult classic in the United States years after its 1978 release in Hong Kong. The actor\u2019s remarkable physical abilities are evident in the scene. But so, too, are his comedic skills, demonstrated both through the fighting scenes and his exaggerated facial expressions. The movies he made in China showed him as a canny comedian, whether he was in the midst of a fight scene or just reciting canned dialogue. 2. Here\u2019s a scene from the end of Mr. Chan\u2019s breakout success in America, \u201cRush Hour\u201d (1998) in which he starred with Chris Tucker. Among other martial arts, Mr. Chan has long been a master of his own brand of Zui Quan, which is sometimes referred to colloquially as drunken fist, or   kung fu. It\u2019s a kind of martial arts in which a person imitates the posture and clumsiness of someone who\u2019s had a little too much to drink. Though it\u2019s ideal for comedy and action films, it\u2019s can also be useful in combat. An article in Vice in 2009 explained the style\u2019s   advantages: \u201cThe great strength of drunken boxing as a trick play or philosophy is as a mask for actual fighting ability. \u201d 3. Mr. Chan\u2019s success paved the way for other martial arts stars from China to break into Hollywood. Three years after Mr. Chan first experienced success in America, with \u201cRumble in the Bronx,\u201d the Chinese actor Jet Li made his first appearance in an American film, \u201cLethal Weapon 4. \u201d Mr. Li went on to become a star in his own right, and he and Mr. Chan teamed up in 2008 for \u201cThe Forbidden Kingdom. \u201d This clip shows their fight from the film. 4. Mr. Chan\u2019s abilities as an action star were not confined to fight scenes. He was extraordinarily adept at navigating space in all its forms, as the video  \u2014   a montage of clips of   and other types of sequences  \u2014   shows. Before Mr. Chan was a star, he was an acrobat and a stuntman, who worked with another legend, Bruce Lee, on the 1972 film \u201cFist of Fury. \u201d In an interview with Inside   magazine, Mr. Chan explained that much of his physical skill was intuitive, partly because he had started basic physical training when he was 6 or 7 years old. \u201cAfter all those years, it becomes very natural,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually very hard to tell you how I train, because I just \u2018know\u2019 what to do. When I lose my balance, you just know how to get it back. So, this way, when I do a stunt, I do get hurt sometimes  \u2014   but less than some other people. \u201d 5. Tony Zhou, the movie buff who cocreates the clips on the YouTube channel Every Frame a Painting, narrates this clip, an analysis of Mr. Chan\u2019s ability to combine action and comedy. (Mr. Zhou declined to comment for this article.) In the clip, Mr. Zhou illustrates Mr. Chan\u2019s depth of knowledge about film more generally, including directing and editing, commenting on his framing choices and camera angles. He also elaborates on the difference between movies shot in Hong Kong, where Mr. Chan was often given months to get scenes right, and those made by American directors, which sometimes obscure the actor\u2019s genius.'"}, "time": 1742628427.4541848}
