Nobody knows. Because nobody knows all the terrorists. \u201d He also declined to say whether the figure might be \u201csignificant\u201d highlighting that it took only 15 people to bring down the Twin Towers on  . \u201cIt\u2019s not about significant because you don\u2019t need a significant number to commit atrocities,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the number, it\u2019s about the quality  \u2014   it\u2019s about the intentions. \u201d Speaking in his presidential office in Damascus, Syria, Assad would not take a view on whether the U. S. was right to halt the immigration of migrants from seven countries which posed a security threat, Syria included, but said that his priority was rather to ensure that Syrian asylum seekers return home. \u201cFor me, the priority is to bring those citizens to their country, not to help them immigrate,\u201d he said. The interview was released as the British prime minister, Theresa May, defended government schemes to resettle 20, 000 Syrians in the UK over five years. At a Downing Street press conference, May told reporters: \u2018We have been seeing quite a number of children and families being resettled here in the United Kingdom. \u201cI think what we are doing in terms of refugees is absolutely right, on top of course of the significant financial support and humanitarian aid we are giving to refugees in the region of Syria  \u2014   a commitment of \u00a32. 3 billion, the second biggest bilateral donor. \u201d In the last few days, the government has come under fire for ending a scheme to bring child migrants from Calais into Britain. Announcing the decision, immigration minister Robert Goodwill told MPs that 200 children had been placed around the country and that councils had indicated they had the capacity for only 150 more. But the Archbishop of Canterbury slammed the move, calling on the government to take in nearly ten times as many children. He added: \u201cI fear that this week\u2019s decision does not meet the spirit of commitment that was given during the passage of the Immigration Act last year. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562747.780313}
