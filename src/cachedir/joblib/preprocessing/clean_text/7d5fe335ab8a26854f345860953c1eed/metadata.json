[\u201cWell, let me tell you about Twitter,\u201d Trump said to Carlson. \u201cI think that maybe I wouldn\u2019t be here if it wasn\u2019t for Twitter, because I get such a fake press, such a dishonest press. \u201d  The president also stated that he utilizes his \u201cown form of media\u201d and noted his massive following on the social network. \u201cThe news is not honest,\u201d said President Trump. \u201cMuch of the news. It\u2019s not honest. And when I have close to 100 million people watching me on Twitter, including Facebook, including all of the Instagram, including POTUS, including lots of things  \u2014   but we have  \u2014   I guess pretty close to 100 million people. I have my own form of media. \u201d President Trump also clarified his opinion of reporters in the media, saying, \u201cSome of the press  \u2014   by the way, some of the finest people I know are reporters. Reporters are wonderful. I\u2019m talking about the fake media, the fake news. And there\u2019s a lot of fake news. So if I\u2019m not going to  \u2014   if they\u2019re not going to do me the honor and the public the honor of spreading my word accurately as it was meant, and you know exactly what I\u2019m talking about, because there\u2019s been nobody in history that got more dishonest media than I\u2019ve gotten. \u201d \u201cYou look at some of the stories in The New York Times,\u201d said Trump, \u201cYou look at some of the stories in The Washington Post. Take a look at what\u2019s going on with CBS and NBC in particular and ABC  \u2014   take a look at CNN. It\u2019s a complete hit job. No matter what you do, no matter how good  \u2014   no matter how great it is, they don\u2019t report it in a positive fashion. \u201d Researchers at the University of Massachusetts published a study in December that examined how through Trump\u2019s use of social media, \u201cTwitter became news\u201d: \u201cHe knew that he would get attention and it would go beyond Twitter  \u2014   it would be reported on the news and in   comedy [shows],\u201d said Professor Gross. Those   messages, which could be pulled up on screen by news programmes, served as \u201ca mini press release\u201d he added. The medium \u201cmade it easier to spread whatever he was thinking very quickly\u201d. \u201cIn some sense Twitter made it easier to digest these and push them through the bloodstream of the American public,\u201d said University of Massachusetts Assistant Professor of Political Science Justin Gross. Bloomberg also noted following the presidential election Trump\u2019s successful use of Twitter in spreading his message, allowing him to \u201creach American voters constantly and without an editor. \u201d Watch President Trump\u2019s full interview on Fox News below: Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
