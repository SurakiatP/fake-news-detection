During the summit meeting that I had with President Trump, he assured me that the United States will always [be] with Japan 100% and to demonstrate his determination as well as commitment, he is now here with me at this joint press conference. President Trump and I myself completely share the view that we are going to promote further cooperation between the two nations and also we are going to further reinforce our alliance. That is all from myself. President Trump followed up Abe\u2019s statement by affirming his support. \u201cI just want everybody to understand and fully know that the United States of America stands behind Japan, its great ally, 100 percent. \u201d Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent'"}, "time": 1742562243.8845189}
