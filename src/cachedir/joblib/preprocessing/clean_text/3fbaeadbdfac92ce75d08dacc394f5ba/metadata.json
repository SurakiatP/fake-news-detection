Lobster Newburg was still on the menu, the meat napped with a   butter. \u201cBut the sauce used to have much, much more brandy in it,\u201d Mr. Freedman said. \u201cThe style now is less severe. \u201d Whatever the brandy content, this plush dish and its environs hardly seemed the stuff of revolution. But to hear Mr. Freedman tell it, Delmonico\u2019s fired the first real shot for American dining, giving rise to a huge, diverse industry that would thrive and adapt to every major shift in the nation\u2019s identity. In his navy suit and   glasses, Mr. Freedman, a professor of medieval history at Yale University, doesn\u2019t look the part of a provocateur, either. But for his new book, \u201cTen Restaurants That Changed America\u201d (Liveright) he set out on a brash mission: culling through hundreds of thousands of restaurants, across a span of two centuries, to produce a list of what he believes were the 10 most influential. The list is brief, but Mr. Freedman marshals deep research to map the changes each restaurant made to American culture. Howard Johnson\u2019s, the   chain that still evokes nostalgia for the comforting sameness of its fried clams, was designed to be immediately recognizable from a moving vehicle: a wholesome,   restaurant for the growing,   middle class. Until it became a fixture in the 1930s and \u201940s, Mr. Freedman writes, roadside dining options were mostly limited to truck stops that catered to men (salesmen and truckers) popping in on their own. Though Howard Johnson\u2019s wasn\u2019t able to keep up with chains that followed in its footsteps, like McDonald\u2019s and Burger King, this was the restaurant that pioneered franchising as an expansion plan, strategically opening along highways and ushering in the era of big fast food. \u201cUniformity in everything, not just food, was enforced by a manual,\u201d Mr. Freedman writes, \u201ca \u2018Bible\u2019 of rules and procedures covering kitchen equipment, d\u00e9cor, maintenance, uniforms and cleaning. \u201d Chinese restaurants had been in business here since the   century, after the California Gold Rush, but Mr. Freedman zooms in on the Mandarin, which opened in San Francisco in 1961. At a time when most Chinese restaurants were identified with a single dish, chop suey, the Mandarin showed off the cuisine\u2019s nuance. Its owner, Cecilia Chiang, focused on Northern Chinese home cooking, creating a highly successful restaurant that doubled as a bid to broaden Americans\u2019 understanding of Chinese people and culture. Mr. Freedman devotes a chapter to Sylvia\u2019s, the restaurant that Sylvia Woods opened in 1962 in Harlem. Ms. Woods, who was born in South Carolina, was one of many black Americans who moved north in the early 20th century, and she built her business on the traditional Southern cooking she had known as a child. Although in later years, Sylvia\u2019s would become   a shorthand for the very meaning of soul food, for decades it was a prime example of how a neighborhood restaurant could thrive as a social center. Mr. Freedman writes, \u201cIt developed a group of regulars, whom Sylvia Woods and her family called by their occupations: \u2018  man,\u2019 or \u2018  man. \u2019\u201d At Delmonico\u2019s, a jacketed waiter appeared (\u201cExcuse me? \u201d) and asked to know if Mr. Freedman would care for some freshly ground black pepper for his pasta with   sauce and peas. Mr. Freedman\u2019s book begins here. When Delmonico\u2019s opened, as a pastry shop in 1827, the restaurant scene in New York was wobbly at best. A hustle of street stalls specialized in cheap, fast oyster preparations. Rowdy taverns served a limited number of simple dishes to people at common tables. That was about it. Americans ate at home, and rich New Yorkers ate and entertained at home. But within a few years, the ambitious Delmonico brothers, from Switzerland, had expanded their pastry shop into a serious French restaurant that modeled itself on   fine dining. It was, as Mr. Freedman tells it, America\u2019s first true restaurant, in that groups could make reservations and order from a deep menu. The kitchen imported black truffles from the Dordogne region of southwest France to bake in pastry, and served   crabs from the Eastern Seaboard, bluefish and turtle. The fare was a prototype: the kind of expensive, endlessly reproduced French cuisine that would rule in American cities for well over 100 years. \u201cI asked the chef if he would recreate an old turtle dish,\u201d said Mr. Freedman, who started the research for his book three years ago, \u201cbut he never did get back to me on that. \u201d Mr. Freedman, who is 67, was raised on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. His father was a psychiatrist and the president of the American Psychiatric Association in the early 1970s (when it declared that homosexuality was not, in fact, an illness). His mother was a labor economist. The family went out to eat French food occasionally, and to Tien Tsin, a Chinese restaurant in Harlem, almost every Saturday. As a treat, Mr. Freedman\u2019s grandmother took him to Schrafft\u2019s, where he ate club sandwiches, chicken potpie and butterscotch sundaes. Schrafft\u2019s, a Northeastern chain, started as a candy store, but in the 1910s transformed itself into a lunch counter and restaurant for women and the expanding middle class. In its early days, before it was considered a stodgy place for little old ladies, it was radical: a safe, affordable space for women to socialize on their own, in an era when women without male escorts were not welcome in restaurants. Schrafft\u2019s also hired many women, not only as waitresses, but also as cooks and managers, and offered maternity leave. Half a dozen of the restaurants in Mr. Freedman\u2019s book could be found in New York, though most are no longer around. The Four Seasons, which established the notion of sophisticated American cuisine in 1959, when French traditions still dominated, also brought in the era of seasonal fine dining. It\u2019s hard to imagine today, but luxury dining up until then had been built on the notion of consistency throughout the year, and on shipping    ingredients, regardless of their quality. A menu that did not change was considered a luxurious menu. Mr. Freedman made it to the Four Seasons before it left its space in the landmark Seagram Building in July, after an impasse with the landlord. (It plans to reopen a few blocks away.) But he missed the chance to experience other restaurants on his list, like Le Pavillon, the Midtown restaurant where Henri Soul\u00e9 influenced an entire generation of French chefs. Mr. Freedman snubbed one of his choices on principle. \u201cEveryone who lived in New York knew that Mamma Leone\u2019s was a tourist trap,\u201d he said. It was also, as he explains in the chapter devoted to it, much more than that. A giant moneymaking machine, Mamma Leone\u2019s helped bring Italian cuisine and culture into the American mainstream, he writes. Founded by Luisa Leone in 1906, it provided a model for the success of an   restaurant on its own terms, expanding its clientele well beyond   diners. Mr. Freedman rounds out his Top 10 with two restaurants that endure: Antoine\u2019s, which opened in 1840 in New Orleans, \u201cthe American city with the strongest roots and the longest run of culinary traditions,\u201d and Chez Panisse in Berkeley, Calif. where in 1971 the chef Alice Waters championed the brand of new American cooking  \u2014   local and seasonal  \u2014   that reigns in restaurants today. Though Mr. Freedman is a medievalist and does not consider himself a food writer, food culture was also the engine of his 2008 book, \u201cOut of the East: Spices and the Medieval Imagination,\u201d in which he debunked the myth that European cooks in the Middle Ages used spices to preserve meat. He lives in Pelham, N. Y. with his wife, Bonnie J. Roe, a lawyer, but often travels to Queens to eat noodles and dumplings at the excellent Taiwanese, Indonesian and Sichuan restaurants in Flushing and Elmhurst. In New Haven, Mr. Freedman\u2019s pizza loyalty lies with Zuppardi\u2019s Apizza and its clam pies, for which the clams are shucked to order. \u201cIt takes a little longer, but it\u2019s worth it,\u201d he said. Of the young, ambitious restaurants on the scene now, Mr. Freedman thinks a few may just be in the same league as his 10: Benu, in San Francisco, with its distinctly modern American aesthetic, comes up. So does Husk, in Charleston, S. C. and its ethos that goes far beyond    into reviving historical ingredients. The burger chain Shake Shack, Mr. Freedman notes, could be another contender, with its capacity for   and   reproduction. For dessert at Delmonico\u2019s, Mr. Freedman ordered a baked alaska. It wasn\u2019t just dessert, but a carefully preserved artifact from one of Charles Ranhofer\u2019s old menus: banana ice cream sandwiched in walnut cake, sticky with apricot jam, swaddled in a thick layer of spiky torched meringue. One of the more remarkable things about Mr. Freedman\u2019s book is the way it shows how culinary history repeats itself. By 1867, when Mr. Ranhofer served this dessert, Delmonico\u2019s was buying produce at local markets. \u201cBut for many years before that,\u201d Mr. Freedman pointed out, \u201cthe restaurant relied on its own farm in Williamsburg. \u201d Yes, even America\u2019s first restaurant cycled through the Brooklyn    thing. Here are the 10 restaurants that made Mr. Freedman\u2019s list. What would you add to it and why? Tell us in the comments.'"}, "time": 1742564217.6798854}
