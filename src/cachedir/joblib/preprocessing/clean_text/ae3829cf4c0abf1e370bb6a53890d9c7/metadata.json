[Engelbrecht said of voter fraud in America, \u201cWe are, in my opinion, on the verge of a systemic crisis for a lot of reasons. The first is, we are not evaluating the people that we are allowing to register to vote. We are not doing any sort of reconciliation for identity, residency, citizenship.   \u2026     We don\u2019t know that these people are who they say that they are. \u201d  Engelbrecht added that with the data and technology available today, \u201cthere\u2019s no reason that we wouldn\u2019t have a better handle on that. \u201d \u201cWe have willfully chosen to let our voter rolls run amok,\u201d she said. Engelbrecht continued, \u201cWe will soon have a major outcome where we cannot trust the outcome, and at that point, you can\u2019t unring that bell. At that point, things start to crumble and crumble fast. \u201d Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern. '"}, "time": 1742563695.2401514}
