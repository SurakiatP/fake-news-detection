One of the Islamic State\u2019s most senior strategists, Abu Muhammad   was killed in the Syrian province of Aleppo. A founding member of ISIS, he was its chief propagandist and headed its efforts to instigate terror attacks in the West. _____ 2. The European Union\u2019s antitrust enforcer ruled that huge tax breaks Ireland provided to Apple were illegal, ordering the country to collect about $14. 5 billion in back taxes. Apple described the record penalty as a \u201cdevastating blow\u201d to the rule of law, and the U. S. despite its own frustrations with corporate schemes to avoid taxes, said it jeopardized \u201cthe important spirit of economic partnership between the U. S. and the E. U. \u201d _____ 3.   races in Florida and Arizona made Tuesday one of the summer\u2019s biggest congressional primary days. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, above, who was forced to step down as chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee by an email leak, hung on to her South Florida House seat. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida was nominated by Republican voters for a second term, and John McCain fought off a Republican challenger for his Senate seat. _____ 4. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are preparing for the first presidential debate, due in less than four weeks, in tellingly different ways. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advisers are consulting Mr. Trump\u2019s ghostwriter on \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d and psychology experts, reviewing his past performances and looking for trigger points. Mr. Trump has had freewheeling sessions with his debate team, but not mock debates with a Clinton  . _____ 5. Brazil\u2019s Senate could vote overnight on whether to convict President Dilma Rousseff of manipulating the federal budget to mask the extent of the country\u2019s economic problems. \u201cDon\u2019t expect from me the obliging silence of cowards,\u201d Ms. Rousseff said as she made a   rebuttal on Monday. _____ 6. Israel has been quietly legalizing tiny outposts established by settlers in the West Bank over the past two decades.   groups accuse the government of changing the map of the West Bank, now in its 50th year of Israeli occupation, and ruining any possibility of a   solution. \u201cWe see it as a very gradual move toward annexation,\u201d said an Israeli opponent. _____ 7. Reader appreciations for Gene Wilder are rolling in by the hundreds in comments on our obituary and on our Facebook post. Our critic mused on the genius of the comic actor, who died Monday at the age of 83: glimmering eyes, diction \u201cas crisp as a potato chip\u201d and a barely suppressed lunacy. \u201cHis Willy Wonka spent that chocolate factory tour quietly on the verge of a nervous breakdown. \u201d _____ 8. Our magazine has the back story of Oliver Stone\u2019s herculean efforts to make \u201cSnowden,\u201d the biopic of Edward Snowden opening Sept. 16. Mr. Stone became preoccupied with warding off government surveillance and schemed to secure Mr. Snowden\u2019s appearance in the movie\u2019s finale. That passage required nine takes. \u201cEd is used to answering questions on a level of intelligence,\u201d Mr. Stone said. \u201cBut I was interested in the emotional, which is difficult for him. \u201d _____ 9. An organization that tracks extremist groups in the U. S. has declared one of them, White Lives Matter, a hate group. Established in opposition to the Black Lives Matter movement, the group argues that white Americans are being eradicated by immigration and intermarriage. \u201cI wish Hitler were here alive and well today,\u201d one of its founders wrote on a social networking site. _____ 10. Two years ago, turmoil swept over a New Hampshire prep school after a    student accused a senior of raping her. He was convicted of misdemeanor charges. Now, the unnamed student has come forward. In an interview with NBC, Chessy Prout described the difficulties she faced, including being shunned by fellow students, and offered support for other victims: \u201cI want other people to feel empowered and just strong enough to be able to say: \u2018I have the right to my body. I have the right to say no.\u2019 \u201d _____ 11. Finally, this is a scientifically proven good dog. It\u2019s one of a group that Hungarian researchers trained to enter a magnetic resonance imaging machine and lie quietly in a harness while their brain activity was recorded. The study found that dogs react not only to the tone of your voice, but also to the words themselves. So, as with humans, both meaning and emotional content matter. _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern. And don\u2019t miss Your Morning Briefing, posted weekdays at 6 a. m.
