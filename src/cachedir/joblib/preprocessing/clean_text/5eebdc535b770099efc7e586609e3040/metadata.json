He was 57. His publicist, Yvette   confirmed his death but did not report a cause. In a statement, the Carver County sheriff, Jim Olson, said that deputies responded to an emergency call at 9:43 a. m. \u201cWhen deputies and medical personnel arrived,\u201d he said, \u201cthey found an unresponsive adult male in the elevator. Emergency medical workers attempted to provide lifesaving CPR, but were unable to revive the victim. He was pronounced deceased at 10:07 a. m. \u201d The sheriff\u2019s office said it would continue to investigate his death. Last week, responding to news reports that Prince\u2019s plane had made an emergency landing because of a health scare, Ms.   said Prince was \u201cfighting the flu. \u201d Prince was a man bursting with music  \u2014   a wildly prolific songwriter, a virtuoso on guitars, keyboards and drums and a master architect of funk, rock, RB and pop, even as his music defied genres. In a career that lasted from the late 1970s until his solo \u201cPiano  a Microphone\u201d tour this year, he was acclaimed as a sex symbol, a musical prodigy and an artist who shaped his career his way, often battling with accepted   practices. \u201cWhen I first started out in the music industry, I was most concerned with freedom. Freedom to produce, freedom to play all the instruments on my records, freedom to say anything I wanted to,\u201d he said when he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004. In a tribute to George Harrison that night, Prince went on to play a guitar solo in \u201cWhile My Guitar Gently Weeps\u201d that left the room floored. A   Grammy winner, Prince had Top 10 hits like \u201cLittle Red Corvette,\u201d \u201cWhen Doves Cry,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s Go Crazy,\u201d \u201cKiss\u201d and \u201cThe Most Beautiful Girl in the World\u201d albums like \u201cDirty Mind,\u201d \u201c1999\u201d and \u201cSign O\u2019 the Times\u201d were   statements. His songs also became hits for others, among them \u201cNothing Compares 2 U\u201d for Sinead O\u2019Connor, \u201cManic Monday\u201d for the Bangles and \u201cI Feel for You\u201d for Chaka Khan. With the 1984 film and album \u201cPurple Rain,\u201d he told a fictionalized version of his own story: biracial (although Prince\u2019s parents were both  ) gifted, spectacularly ambitious. Its music won him an Academy Award, and the album sold more than 13 million copies in the United States alone. In a statement, President Obama said, \u201cFew artists have influenced the sound and trajectory of popular music more distinctly, or touched quite so many people with their talent. \u201d He added, \u201cHe was a virtuoso instrumentalist, a brilliant bandleader, and an electrifying performer. \u2018A strong spirit transcends rules,\u2019 Prince once said  \u2014   and nobody\u2019s spirit was stronger, bolder, or more creative. \u201d Prince recorded the great majority of his music entirely on his own, playing every instrument and singing every vocal line. Many of his albums were simply credited, \u201cProduced, arranged, composed and performed by Prince. \u201d Then, performing those songs onstage, he worked as a bandleader in the polished, athletic, ecstatic tradition of James Brown, at once spontaneous and utterly precise, riveting enough to open a Grammy Awards telecast and play the Super Bowl halftime show. He would often follow a   arena concert with a   club show, pouring out even more music. On Prince\u2019s biggest hits, he sang passionately, affectionately and playfully about sex and seduction. With deep bedroom eyes and a sly, knowing smile, he was one of pop\u2019s ultimate flirts: a sex symbol devoted to romance and pleasure, not power or machismo. Elsewhere in his catalog were songs that addressed social issues and delved into mysticism and science fiction. He made himself a unifier of dualities  \u2014   racial, sexual, musical, cultural  \u2014   teasing at them in songs like \u201cControversy\u201d and transcending them in his career. He had plenty of eccentricities: his fondness for the color purple, using \u201cU\u201d for \u201cyou\u201d and a drawn eye for \u201cI\u201d long before textspeak, his vigilant policing of his music online, his penchant for releasing troves of music at once, his intensely private persona. Yet for musicians and listeners of multiple generations, he was admired   universally. Prince\u2019s music had an immediate and lasting influence: among songwriters concocting   among producers working on dance grooves, among studio experimenters and stage performers. He sang as a soul belter, a rocker, a bluesy ballad singer and a falsetto crooner. His most immediately recognizable (and widely imitated) instrumental style was a particular kind of pinpoint, staccato funk, defined as much by keyboards as by the rhythm section. But that was just one among the many styles he would draw on and blend, from hard rock to psychedelia to electronic music. His music was a cornucopia of ideas: triumphantly, brilliantly kaleidoscopic. Prince Rogers Nelson was born in Minneapolis on June 7, 1958, the son of John L. Nelson, a musician whose stage name was Prince Rogers, and Mattie Della Shaw, a jazz singer who had performed with the Prince Rogers Band. They were separated in 1965, and his mother remarried in 1967. Prince spent some time living with each parent and immersed himself in music, teaching himself to play his instruments. \u201cI think you\u2019ll always be able to do what your ear tells you,\u201d he told his high school newspaper, according to the biography \u201cI Would Die 4 U: Why Prince Became an Icon\u201d (2013) by the critic Tour\u00e9. Eventually he ran away, living for some time in the basement of a neighbor whose son, Andr\u00e9 Anderson, would later record as Andr\u00e9 Cymone. As high school students they formed a band that would also include Morris Day, later the leader of the Time. In classes, Prince also studied the music business. He recorded with a Minneapolis band, 94 East, and began working on his own solo recordings. He was still a teenager when he was signed to Warner Bros. Records, in a deal that included full creative control. His first album, \u201cFor You\u201d (1978) gained only modest attention. But his second, \u201cPrince\u201d (1979) started with \u201cI Wanna Be Your Lover,\u201d a No. 1 RB hit that reached No. 11 on the pop charts the album sold more than a million copies, and for the next two decades Prince albums never failed to reach the Top 100. During the 1980s, nearly all were   that reached the Top 10. With his third album, the pointedly titled \u201cDirty Mind,\u201d Prince moved from typical RB romance to raunchier, more graphic scenarios he posed on the cover against a backdrop of bedsprings and added more rock guitar to his music. It was a clear signal that he would not let formats or categories confine him. \u201cControversy,\u201d in 1981, had Prince taunting, \u201cAm I black or white?  I straight or gay?\u201d His audience was broadening the Rolling Stones chose him as an opening act for part of their tour that year. Prince grew only more prolific. His next album, \u201c1999,\u201d was a double LP the video for one of its hit singles, \u201cLittle Red Corvette,\u201d became one of the first songs by an   musician played in heavy rotation on MTV. He was also writing songs with and producing the female group Vanity 6 and the funk band Morris Day and the Time, which would have a prominent role in \u201cPurple Rain. \u201d Prince played \u201cthe Kid,\u201d escaping an abusive family to pursue rock stardom, in \u201cPurple Rain. \u201d Directed by Albert Magnoli on a budget of $7 million, it was Prince\u2019s film debut and his transformation from stardom to superstardom. With No. 1 hits in \u201cLet\u2019s Go Crazy\u201d and \u201cWhen Doves Cry,\u201d he at one point in 1984 had the No. 1 album, single and film simultaneously. He also drew some opposition. \u201cDarling Nikki,\u201d a song on the album that refers to masturbation, shocked Tipper Gore, the wife of Al Gore, who was then a United States senator, when she heard her daughter listening to it, helping lead to the formation of the Parents\u2019 Music Resource Center, which eventually pressured record companies into labeling albums to warn of \u201cexplicit content. \u201d Prince himself would later, in a more religious phase, decide not to use profanities onstage, but his songs  \u2014   like his 2013 single \u201cBreakfast Can Wait\u201d  \u2014   never renounced carnal delights. Prince didn\u2019t try to repeat the blockbuster sound of \u201cPurple Rain,\u201d and for a time he withdrew from performing. He toyed with pastoral, psychedelic elements on \u201cAround the World in a Day\u201d in 1985, which included the hit \u201cRaspberry Beret,\u201d and \u201cParade\u201d in 1986, which was the soundtrack for a movie he wrote and directed, \u201cUnder the Cherry Moon,\u201d that was an awkward flop. He also built his studio complex, Paisley Park, in the   for a reported $10 million, and in 1989 his \u201cBatman\u201d soundtrack album sold two million copies. Friction grew in the 1990s between Prince and his label, Warner Bros. over the size of his output and how much music he was determined to release. \u201cSign O\u2019 the Times,\u201d a monumental 1987 album that addressed politics and religion as well as romance, was a   set, cut back from a triple. By the   Prince was in open battle with the label, releasing albums as rapidly as he could to finish his contract quality suffered and so did sales. He appeared with the word \u201cSlave\u201d written on his face, complaining about the terms of his contract, and in 1993 he changed his stage name to an unpronounceable glyph, only returning to Prince in 1996 after the Warner contract ended. He marked the change with a triple album, independently released on his own NPG label: \u201cEmancipation. \u201d For the next two decades, Prince put out an avalanche of recordings.  \u2019s takeover of RB meant that he was heard far less often on the radio his last Top 10 hit was \u201cThe Most Beautiful Girl in the World,\u201d in 1994. He experimented early with online sales and distribution of his music, but eventually turned against what he saw as technology companies\u2019 exploitation of the musician instead, he tried other forms of distribution, like giving his 2007 album \u201cPlanet Earth\u201d away with copies of The Daily Mail in Britain. His catalog is not available on the streaming service Spotify, and he took extensive legal measures against users of his music on YouTube and elsewhere. But Prince could always draw and satisfy a live audience, and concerts easily sustained his later career. He was an indefatigable performer: posing, dancing, taking a turn at every instrument, teasing a crowd and then dazzling it. He defied a downpour to play a triumphal \u201cPurple Rain\u201d at the Super Bowl halftime show in 2007, and he headlined the Coachella festival in 2008 for a reported $5 million. A succession of his bands  \u2014   the Revolution, the New Power Generation, 3rdEyeGirl  \u2014   were united by their funky momentum and quick reflexes as Prince made every show seem both thoroughly rehearsed and improvisational. His survivors include a sister, Tyka Nelson, and several  . His marriages to Mayte Garcia and Manuela Testolini ended in divorce. A trove of Prince\u2019s recordings remains unreleased, in an archive he called the Vault. Like much of his offstage career, its contents are a closely guarded secret, but it\u2019s likely that there are masterpieces yet to be heard.'"}, "time": 1742562993.1929054}
