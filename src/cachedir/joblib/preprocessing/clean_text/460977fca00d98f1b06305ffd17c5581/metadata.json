J.  \u2014   Along the commercial corridor of Elmora Avenue, Salvadoran pupusas are sold next to kosher California rolls and across the street from a salon where three Colombians, a Cuban and a Uruguayan cut hair. Past Las Am\u00e9ricas Bakery, the owner of another salon is the proud daughter of southern Italian immigrants. And on that same street, which decades ago used to be populated by Orthodox Jews, there stands an outlier: First American Fried Chicken, owned and operated by the Rahami family, immigrants from Afghanistan. Afghans are not a particularly large group living in Elizabeth. There were only about 200 in a city of nearly 127, 000 people, with 77 born in Afghanistan, according to 2014 census figures compiled by researchers at Queens College. In that same year, 63 percent of Elizabeth residents were Hispanic. But because of Ahmad Khan Rahami, the    arrested on Monday after a gunfight and suspected of planting bombs in Manhattan and New Jersey, Afghans have become the most talked about immigrants in what seemed to be a haven of diversity. \u201cI woke up feeling like it was a dream I never felt like that could happen here,\u201d Agueda Elizabeth Meza, 54, the owner of a Peruvian restaurant on Elizabeth Avenue, said through an interpreter. \u201cElizabeth is a city of all different bloods  \u2014   as Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez said. \u201d Pick a flag  \u2014   there are more than 50 nationalities, and more than 37 languages spoken, according to the office of Mayor J. Christian Bollwage (who is of German and Irish heritage). From Poland, Portugal and Peru, they all have come to Elizabeth. The International Rescue Committee, one of nine agencies in the United States that work with the government to resettle refugees, said that since 2010, its office here had helped 102 Afghan refugees, which includes 30 families. It is still not clear why Mr. Rahami and his family settled in Elizabeth. The authorities said he arrived in the United States as a child and, while a minor, was naturalized through his father  \u2014   a different path from recent refugees who have come after years of international vetting. \u201cOne thing we do not want to see is any sort of backlash against the community in or around Elizabeth,\u201d said Avigail Ziv, the International Rescue Committee\u2019s executive director for New York and New Jersey. \u201cThese are refugees who have suffered a lot and have dealt with violence as well. They are just trying to rebuild their lives. \u201d There are four mosques in Elizabeth, but the largest, and where the agency said its Afghan refugees attended, is Darul Islam, in the northwestern part of the city. The president of the mosque, Hassen Abdellah, said he did not know whether Mr. Rahami had been there. \u201cIf he prayed in Elizabeth, my gut is that he did come here, everybody comes here,\u201d said Mr. Abdellah, born in New Jersey, who was one of the mosque\u2019s founding members in 1992. \u201cWe have an international community, people from Russia, Turkey, Pakistan. We have Asians, Africans,   we have the whole tree. \u201d Asked how many Afghans attend his mosque, Mr. Abdellah said it was perhaps \u201c6 to 7 percent. \u201d On Monday morning, Mr. Abdellah received an email sent to leaders of area mosques with pictures of Mr. Rahami. \u201cI was in shock, like everybody else,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that somebody in Elizabeth was involved in something like this. We\u2019ve always been in partnership with the city and the government. \u201d The surprise registered closer to the fried chicken restaurant on Elmora Avenue. Guillermo Niell, 35, from Uruguay, said he and his family live across the street. He would often buy   there and he never noticed anything strange about the owners. But his Uruguayan hair stylist, Pepo Lambrechts, recalled that recently Mr. Rahami was always on his computer or his phone, not paying attention to customers. \u201cMy father loved that place,\u201d Cristina Castro, 35, the   owner of the salon, said. Once a week, when he used to visit from Colombia, her daughter, Lesley, 13, would take him there. Ms. Castro\u2019s mother, Gladys Echeverri, said she moved the family to Elizabeth in 1999, after the largest rebel group in Colombia made owning a hair salon too difficult in their small town outside Medell\u00edn. Ms. Echeverri was worried that Mr. Rahami\u2019s arrest would affect business in Elizabeth. \u201cIt will hurt the reputation,\u201d she said. But Ms. Castro said the city\u2019s image was already tarnished by being in the dingy shadow of Newark. Officials with the Greater Elizabeth Chamber of Commerce would disagree. They are trying to turn Elizabeth into prime tourist destination, with the Jersey Gardens outlet mall as its biggest draw and its history  \u2014   thanks to Alexander Hamilton, who lived and studied in Elizabeth after coming to the American colonies in 1772  \u2014   in vogue. \u201cWe were the first capital of New Jersey this is where New Jersey was founded,\u201d said Gordon Haas, the president of the Chamber of Commerce. \u201cWe advertise, \u2018You can dine the world without a passport,\u2019 because you name a restaurant, we\u2019ve got it,\u201d Mr. Haas said, adding, \u201cincluding now, I guess, an Afghani chicken place. \u201d On Monday, as police cars and government vehicles cordoned off the street next to the restaurant and others around downtown Elizabeth, there was another kind of tension in the air for some immigrants. Back in January, immigration officials conducted raids in New Jersey as part of a nationwide effort to deport those who had orders of removal. That brought an increased law enforcement presence and anxiety to Elmora Avenue. \u201cOn the one side, you feel some security having all of this police around,\u201d Ms. Meza said, who is a member of Make the Road New Jersey, an immigrant activist group. \u201cBut on the other side, there is this feeling of fear because only a few months ago raids were happening in our community, and one cannot help but be reminded. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562192.5917742}
