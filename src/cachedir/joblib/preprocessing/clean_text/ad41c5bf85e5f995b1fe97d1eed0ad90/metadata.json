[The Social Democratic Party (SPD) minister was speaking at a press conference last week at which youth protection website Jugendschutz. net said \u201cright wing extremists\u201d are using rap music and social media trends to \u201cspread hate against refugees, Muslims and other minorities\u201d.  \u201cRight wing extremists are using stylish memes and videos to convey their messages,\u201d said the website\u2019s deputy director Stefan Glaser. Speaking in Berlin he warned that \u201cfalse messages are being launched in a targeted manner to fuel hate\u201d and said activists are posting \u201cfalse messages\u201d intended to \u201cspread hate\u201d in between \u201cphotographs of strawberry and muesli\u201d and other apolitical content. A common tactic of the new wave of   right wing extremists, whom Glaser calls \u201cnipsters\u201d  \u2014   a portmanteau of the words \u2018Nazi\u2019 and \u2018hipster\u2019 is posting on social media about \u201cthe supposed criminality of refugees\u201d. According to Glaser, this typically involves taking messages \u2018such as press releases from the police\u2019 out of context to post about \u201csex jihadists\u201d and \u201cmass rape by Islamists\u201d on Facebook. Jugendschutz. net also warned \u201cthe identitarian movement is packaging its propaganda in cool   songs\u201d highlighting \u2018Komplott\u2019 a rapper who says that mass migration poses a threat to Europe. Condemning the youth protection website\u2019s findings, Schwesig pledged to expand \u201cmedia competence\u201d programmes which the chairman of the Federal Centre for Civic Education says teach \u201cyoung people to recognise fake news, oppose incitement, and show solidarity with victims of hatred\u201d. The minister for family affairs also called for stronger laws to be put in place to ensure that social media companies like Facebook delete   hate posts more quickly, \u201cwith no ifs or buts\u201d. Jugendschutz. net reports that in 2016 it found 1, 678 examples of \u201cfar right content that poses a threat the development of children and adolescents\u201d 94 per cent of which were found on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. The organisation was able to get offending content either removed, or access to the material blocked in Germany, in more than 80 per cent of cases after reporting it.'"}, "time": 1742562499.4428365}
