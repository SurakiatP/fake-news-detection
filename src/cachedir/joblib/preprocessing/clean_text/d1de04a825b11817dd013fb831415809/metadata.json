[He turned to the theme of health care toward the very end of his speech.  \u201cThe House has put forward a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare based on the principles I outlined in my joint address,\u201d the president said. \u201cLet me tell you, we\u2019re going to arbitrate, we\u2019re going to all get together, we\u2019re going to get something done,\u201d he added. The president also blasted the culture of Washington and Democratic recalcitrance. \u201cRemember this \u2014  if we didn\u2019t do it the way we\u2019re doing it   \u2026     we need 60 votes. So we have to get the Democrats involved. They won\u2019t vote, no matter what we do,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing it a different way, a complex way, it\u2019s fine. The end result is  \u2014   when you have Phase One, Phase Two, Phase Three, it\u2019s going to be great,\u201d the president added. \u201cAnd then we get on to tax reduction,\u201d he concluded. While he heaped praise on a number of Tennessee Republican politicians in his speech, another name was noticeable for its absence in his talk: Speaker Paul Ryan. Ryan\u2019s healthcare reform bill, referred to as   by some, has been panned by Democrats and conservatives alike. The president\u2019s remarks in Nashville on Monday did little to suggest he is committed to the specifics of the Ryan proposal. In addition to his use of the term \u201carbitrate\u201d he used another term to describe how he would approach getting a health care bill through Congress: \u201cnegotiate. \u201d While he firmly stood behind his campaign promise to repeal and replace Obamacare, the president made it clear that the healthcare bill currently on the table may be substantially different from the bill he finally signs. \u201cThe bill I will ultimately sign will repeal and replace Obamacare,\u201d the president told the cheering crowd. Trump focused more on the failures of Obamacare than the specifics of the current proposals under consideration. \u201cRemember all of the broken promises? You can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan? Remember the wise guy that essentially said   \u2026     the   architect   \u2026     the American people are stupid?\u201d he asked. \u201cThose in Congress who made these promises have no credibility whatsoever,\u201d he told the cheering crowd. Trump also criticized \u201cthe level of hatred and divisiveness with the politicians\u201d in Washington. \u201cIf we submitted the Democrats\u2019 plan   \u2026     we wouldn\u2019t get one vote from the Democrats. That\u2019s how much divisiveness and other things there are,\u201d he added. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to get it by,\u201d Trump said of a revised health care bill. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to so many victims of Obamacare. At the very core of Obamacare was a fatal flaw. The government forcing people to buy a   product,\u201d he added. Trump said that when health care has been fixed, Americans \u201cwill be able to purchase the health insurance plans they want, not the plans forced on them by our government. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563065.8955743}
