Many times. \\nMichael Moore, the controversial documentary filmmaker, is a staunch Democrat and Clinton supporter, but has been saying all along that Trump was going to win. \\nOn Real Time with Bill Maher in July, Moore cried out, \u201cGet out of your bubble, people!\u201d He listed five reasons why Trump was going to be the next president and he was creepy correct. \\nFor example, his first reason \u2018The Rust Belt/Brexit Strategy\u2019 played out before our eyes last night: \\n\u201cMitt Romney lost by 64 electoral votes. The total votes of [Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania ]\u2026 64. All he (Trump) has to do is win those four states.\u201d \\nYou can check out the whole list, explained in detail, here . \\nAnd during a talk posted on Youtube on October 24 th , Moore also explained why Trump was gonna win. \\nBut the ever-optimistic Moore is not wasting his time saying, \u201cI told you so.\u201d Instead, he has put out a call for action. On his Facebook page, he posted a to-do list and it looks like this time people are listening. The posting has gone viral, with 218K reactions, 10K comments and almost 100K shares on Facebook alone. \\nSo, without further ado\u2026 Michael Moore\u2019s Morning After To-Do List: Take over the Democratic Party and return it to the people. They have failed us miserably Fire all pundits, predictors, pollsters and anyone else in the media who had a narrative they wouldn\u2019t let go of and refused to listen to or acknowledge what was really going on. Those same bloviators will now tell us we must \u201cheal the divide\u201d and \u201ccome together.\u201d They will pull more hooey like that out of their ass in the days to come. Turn them off. Any Democratic member of Congress who didn\u2019t wake up this morning ready to fight, resist and obstruct in the way Republicans did against President Obama every day for eight full years must step out of the way and let those of us who know the score lead the way in stopping the meanness and the madness that\u2019s about to begin. Everyone must stop saying they are \u201cstunned\u201d and \u201cshocked.\u201d What you mean to say is that you were in a bubble and weren\u2019t paying attention to your fellow Americans and their despair. YEARS of being neglected by both parties, the anger and the need for revenge against the system only grew. Along came a TV star they liked whose plan was to destroy both parties and tell them all \u201cYou\u2019re fired!\u201d Trump\u2019s victory is no surprise. He was never a joke. Treating him as one only strengthened him. He is both a creature and a creation of the media and the media will never own that. You must say this sentence to everyone you meet today: \u201cHILLARY CLINTON WON THE POPULAR VOTE!\u201d The MAJORITY of our fellow Americans preferred Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump. Period. Fact. If you woke up this morning thinking you live in an effed-up country, you don\u2019t. The majority of your fellow Americans wanted Hillary, not Trump. The only reason he\u2019s president is because of an arcane, insane 18th-century idea called the Electoral College. Until we change that, we\u2019ll continue to have presidents we didn\u2019t elect and didn\u2019t want. You live in a country where a majority of its citizens have said they believe there\u2019s climate change, they believe women should be paid the same as men, they want a debt-free college education, they don\u2019t want us invading countries, they want a raise in the minimum wage and they want a single-payer true universal health care system. None of that has changed. We live in a country where the majority agree with the \u201cliberal\u201d position. We just lack the liberal leadership to make that happen (see: #1 above). Let\u2019s try to get this all done by noon today. \\n\u2014 Michael Moore \\nYou can read the original post on Michael Moore\u2019s Facebook page . \\nFeatured image via YouTube screengrab Share this Article!'"}, "time": 1742564541.4531403}
