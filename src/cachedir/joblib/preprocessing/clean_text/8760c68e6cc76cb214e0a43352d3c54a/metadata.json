[The Institute of Contemporary History of Munich (IfZ) said around 85, 000 copies of the new annotated version of the Nazi leader\u2019s   manifesto had flown off the shelves since its release last January.  It had initially planned to print only 4, 000 copies but boosted production immediately based on intense demand. The sixth print run will hit bookstores in late January. The   work had figured on the   bestseller list in weekly magazine Der Spiegel over much of the last year, and even topped the list for two weeks in April. The institute also organised a successful series of presentations and debates around \u201cMein Kampf\u201d across Germany and in other European cities, which it said allowed it to measure the impact of the new edition. \u201cIt turned out that the fear the publication would promote Hitler\u2019s ideology or even make it socially acceptable and give   a new propaganda platform was totally unfounded,\u201d IfZ director Andreas Wirsching said in a statement. \u201cTo the contrary, the debate about Hitler\u2019s worldview and his approach to propaganda offered a chance to look at the causes and consequences of totalitarian ideologies, at a time in which authoritarian political views and rightwing slogans are gaining ground. \u201d  \u2014   \u2018Not reactionaries or radicals\u2019  \u2014   The institute said the data collected about buyers by regional bookstores showed that they tended to be \u201ccustomers interested in politics and history as well as educators\u201d and not \u201creactionaries or rightwing radicals\u201d. Nevertheless, the IfZ said it would maintain a restrictive policy on international rights. For now, only English and French editions are planned despite strong interest from many countries. The institute released the annotated version of \u201cMein Kampf\u201d last January, just days after the copyright of the manifesto expired. Bavaria was handed the rights to the book in 1945 when the Allies gave it control of the main Nazi publishing house following Hitler\u2019s defeat. For 70 years, it refused to allow the inflammatory tract to be republished out of respect for victims of the Nazis and to prevent incitement of hatred. But \u201cMein Kampf\u201d  \u2014   which means \u201cMy Struggle\u201d  \u2014   fell into the public domain on January 1 and the institute said it feared a version without critical commentary could hit the market. Partly autobiographical, \u201cMein Kampf\u201d outlines Hitler\u2019s ideology that formed the basis for Nazism. He wrote it in 1924 while he was imprisoned in Bavaria for treason after his failed Beer Hall Putsch. The book set out two ideas that he put into practice as Germany\u2019s leader going into World War II: annexing neighbouring countries to gain \u201cLebensraum\u201d or \u201cliving space\u201d for Germans, and his hatred of Jews, which led to the Holocaust. Some 12. 4 million copies were published in Germany and from 1936, the Nazi state gave a copy to all newlyweds as a wedding gift.'"}, "time": 1742564260.9728673}
