[Peppered with sentences such as: \u201cWe know that our responsibility to one another is greater than the rights we hold as individuals,\u201d (page 9) the manifesto is sure to raise eyebrows amongst ardent Thatcherites.  But as well as being a clear and decisive departure from Lady Thatcher\u2019s legacy, the manifesto is also a barometer of how the Tories intend to manage Brexit. Here, we run through the pledges most likely to worry Brexiteers. 1. That ECHR pledge, As home secretary, Theresa May made much of her opposition to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) having seen how it hampered her ability to extradite extremists. In April 2016, just months before the Brexit referendum, she even went so far as to say: \u201cThe ECHR can bind the hands of parliament, adds nothing to our prosperity, makes us less secure by preventing the deportation of dangerous foreign nationals  \u2014   and does nothing to change the attitudes of governments like Russia\u2019s when it comes to human rights. \u201cSo regardless of the EU referendum, my view is this: if we want to reform human rights laws in this country, it isn\u2019t the EU we should leave but the ECHR and the jurisdiction of its court. \u201d That position has been entirely reversed in the manifesto, which promises not to bring the European Union\u2019s Charter of Fundamental Rights into UK law, but adds: \u201cWe will not repeal or replace the Human Rights Act while the process of Brexit is underway. \u201d And, of course, it adds: \u201cWe will remain signatories to the European Convention on Human Rights for the duration of the next parliament. \u201d (Page 37) 2. Immigration, The manifesto states the current annual net migration rate of 273, 000 \u201cis still too high\u201d and pledges to reduce immigration both from without the EU and within  \u2014   \u201cwhile still allowing us to attract the skilled workers our economy needs\u201d. (page 55). In February, Brexit minister David Davis admitted, however, there was little Government appetite to reduce   immigration. \u201cIn the hospitality sector, hotels and restaurants, in the social care sector, working in agriculture, it will take time [to set limits]  \u2014   it will be years and years before we get British citizens to do those jobs,\u201d he said. 3. Picking winners, One of the major objections to the EU\u2019s interference in the commerce is its tendency to pick winners, propping up fashionable yet unsustainable industries such as green energy. If British voters thought that would come to an end outside the EU, they will be sorely disappointed. \u201cOur modern industrial strategy [  \u2026    ] is not about picking winners, propping up failing industries, or bringing back old companies from the dead. It is about identifying the industries that are of strategic value to our economy and supporting and promoting them through policies on trade, tax, infrastructure, skills, training, and research and development,\u201d the manifesto states. (page 19) In other words, it\u2019s not about picking winners, it\u2019s about  \u2026     picking winners. \u201cSo we have launched a new \u00a323 billion National Productivity Investment Fund. The government will target this spending at areas that are critical for productivity. \u201d (page 20) 4. Government funded research and development. One of the key cries from Remainers during the referendum was \u201cwhat will we do without EU spending on research and development?\u201d Well don\u2019t worry  \u2014   the Conservatives plan to step in and fill the breach. \u201cWe will spend more on research and development, to turn brilliant discoveries into practical products and transform the world\u2019s industries  \u2014   such as the batteries that will power a new generation of clean, efficient, electric vehicles. \u201d (page 19) \u201cOur ambition is for Britain to lead the world in electric vehicle technology and use. We want almost every car and van to be   by 2050  \u2014   and will invest \u00a3600 million by 2020 to help achieve it. We will invest in more   buses, as well as supporting   displays for bus passengers and community minibuses for rural areas poorly served by public transport. \u201d (page 24) 5.   Speaking of electric vehicles, a central plank of EU ideology is environmentalism, particularly the sort that likes to tackle climate change through high taxes. Good news for Remainers  \u2014   the Conservatives are fully signed up on that front too: \u201cThe United Kingdom will lead the world in environmental protection. As Conservatives, we are committed to leaving the environment in better condition than we inherited it. That is why we will continue to take a lead in global action against climate change, as the government demonstrated by ratifying the Paris Agreement. We were the first country to introduce a Climate Change Act, which Conservatives helped to frame, and we are halfway towards meeting our 2050 goal of reducing emissions by eighty per cent from 1990 levels. \u201cWe will champion greater conservation   within international bodies, protecting rare species, the polar regions and international waters. We will work with our Overseas Territory governments to create a Blue Belt of marine protection in their precious waters, establishing the largest marine sanctuaries anywhere in the world. \u201d (page 40) 6. Progressive politics in the workplace  \u2026     In 2015, the Conservative Government under David Cameron fought off a Commission proposal to force FTSE companies to make 40 per cent of their boards female. But the Conservatives propose to carry forward the EU tradition of meddling in the workplace, adopting EU workers\u2019 rights legislation wholesale, and setting quotas on pay. \u201cWe believe people should be rewarded for their talents and efforts but the public is rightly affronted by the remuneration of some corporate leaders. \u201cThe next Conservative government will legislate to make executive pay packages subject to strict annual votes by shareholders and listed companies will have to publish the ratio of executive pay to broader UK workforce pay. Companies will have to explain their pay policies, particularly complex incentive schemes, better. \u201d (page 18) 7.   \u2026    and beyond. \u201cWe will push forward with our plan for tackling hate crime committed on the basis of religion, disability, sexual orientation or transgender identity. \u201d (page 40)'"}, "time": 1742563332.0757265}
