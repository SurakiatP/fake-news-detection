An exhibition at the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington is adding a twist to the formula, and contemplating the enduring star power of another dynamic duo: Will and Jane. That\u2019s Jane Austen, you rattlepate. True, she and William Shakespeare never met in person (outside the kinkier reaches of fan fiction, that is). But their parallel cultural afterlives illuminate the process by which some great authors are transformed into icons, beloved almost as much for their imagined personalities and our feelings of intimacy with them as for anything they wrote. That, at least, is the argument made by \u201cWill  Jane: Shakespeare, Austen, and the Cult of Celebrity,\u201d a cheeky assemblage of the sometimes exuberantly goofy material objects that centuries of fandom have left behind. The show, which opens on Saturday, is the first Folger exhibition to pair Shakespeare with another writer, and the first to dig deep into some of the odder artifacts  \u2014   antique bellows carved with Will\u2019s face, anyone?  \u2014   in its vaults, which are better known for treasures like 82 First Folios. They are shown alongside Austenalia sourced from all over, ranging from personal objects on loan from Jane Austen\u2019s House Museum in Chawton, England, to modern tchotchkes more redolent of eBay.   Shakespeareans may blanch at seeing Will and Jane bobbleheads on the exhibition poster  \u2014   to say nothing of the prospect of   Janeites flocking to the Folger\u2019s hushed   halls to swoon over the shirt worn (wet) by Colin Firth in his indelible turn as Mr. Darcy in the 1995 BBC adaptation of \u201cPride and Prejudice. \u201d But the global   sparked by that production, the show argues, has a striking parallel in the wave of Bardolatry kicked off by the 1769 Shakespeare Jubilee, which created Shakespeare as a symbol of Englishness, and inspired its share of souvenir mugs and other kitschy tributes. \u201cShakespeare was almost a kind of cheesy   phenomenon in the 18th century,\u201d said Janine Barchas, an Austen expert at the University of Texas who curated the show with Kristina Straub, a Shakespeare scholar at Carnegie Mellon University. \u201cWhen you look at how his reputation was formed, and then grew,\u201d she continued, \u201cit\u2019s very similar to what we\u2019re seeing with Austen now, and the way that pop culture creates a foundation for high culture. \u201d The   cookie cutters in one display case may lack a patina of age. But they are not, Ms. Straub added, inherently more absurd or less   than an   mug bearing Shakespeare\u2019s portrait  \u2014   or, for that matter, a bundle of   wood gathered at Shakespeare\u2019s Birthplace in    reputed to be remnants of a chair he may have sat on. \u201cAt the end of the day, they\u2019re just sticks,\u201d Ms. Straub said. \u201cBut they\u2019re also being treasured in a vault, taking up valuable real estate. It should make you laugh, but it also tells you something about the nature of celebrity that you need to take seriously. \u201d The exhibition was born out of a rather unserious conversation four years ago over a breakfast burrito. Michael Witmore, the Folger\u2019s director, was in Austin, Tex. for a conference, and caught up with Ms. Barchas, who teased him about the fact that \u201cmy author is really giving your author a run for his money,\u201d as she recalled it. After a rambling debate they hit,   on a loose concept. \u201cWhat if these two people were lovable roommates, like Will  Grace, or Laverne  Shirley?\u201d Witmore recalled. \u201cIt really just started with the title. There was absolutely no scholarly thinking. \u201d The resulting show, which arrives during the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare\u2019s death and a year ahead of the 200th anniversary of Austen\u2019s, mixes deep scholarship with serious whimsy. It does not tell a linear story but instead groups its artifacts thematically, taking care to keep the two writers alongside each other. Even beyond sheer literary genius, the curators argue, Shakespeare and Austen have a lot in common  \u2014   starting with their scantily recorded intimate lives, which leave tantalizing holes to fill. One display tracks the way devotees of both authors, who were captured in only a handful of portraits, improved their images. (The likeness of Austen that will appear next year on the British   note is based on a Victorian portrait commissioned by the family in 1869, more than 50 years after Austen\u2019s death, to prettify a casual sketch made by her sister, Cassandra.) Fans have also tended to prettify their love lives with embellished or invented romances, whether a forged love letter from Shakespeare to his wife, Anne Hathaway, that was created in the 1790s, or films like \u201cShakespeare in Love\u201d or \u201cBecoming Jane,\u201d which depicts Austen\u2019s falling in doomed love with a penniless lawyer, only to end up pursuing the lonely creative life. The show also examines how both authors\u2019 names have been used in marketing, whether on a signboard for the Shakespeare\u2019s Head tavern, from the   or   century, or an empty shoe box from a 1970s line of women\u2019s footwear named, for obscure reasons, Jane Austen. \u201cThat one sort of broke my heart,\u201d Ms. Straub said of the box, among several items on loan from Goucher College, a major American repository of Austenalia. \u201cIt\u2019s just a plain cardboard shoe box. \u201d \u201cThe Shirt,\u201d as the label calls Mr. Firth\u2019s chemise, may appear just to be a shirt. But the announcement in March that the Folger had secured it drew palpitating headlines around the world. (A satirical \u201ctour rider\u201d published in The New Yorker spelled out the   garment\u2019s contractual demands, including: \u201cSelfies with THE SHIRT shall only be granted to persons who read actual works by Jane Austen, not just books about people who enjoy Austen books. \u201d) The Shirt is displayed near a series of homages, like a photographic   featuring Benedict Cumberbatch, and as a parallel Shakespearean example, a series of   porcelains showing famous actors as Richard III. Repetition \u201cis a powerful reinforcing mechanism of celebrity,\u201d a display text explains. \u201cThe cultural value of an image increases the more it is copied. \u201d Literary celebrity is also reinforced by brushes with other forms of fame. Consider the case of Austen\u2019s turquoise ring, which became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre after the American singer Kelly Clarkson bought it at auction, prompting the British culture minister to declare it a national treasure that could not be exported. Jane Austen\u2019s House Museum, which now owns the ring, declined to lend it to the Folger, forcing the exhibition to make do with a gold copy. But it did send a collection of domestic objects discovered under the house\u2019s floorboards, including a nail and a clay pipe. It also sent a framed lock of Austen\u2019s hair, now displayed alongside a single strand of auburn hair attributed to Shakespeare, which first surfaced for sale in the early 19th century. \u201cWe didn\u2019t\u2019 have it \u201d Ms. Barchas said jokingly. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to dispel the myth. \u201d The show doesn\u2019t entirely neglect more traditional literary artifacts. There are Shakespeare and Austen volumes owned by famous people, like James Joyce\u2019s   copy of \u201cAs You Like It\u201d and the actor Stephen Fry\u2019s student paperback of \u201cMansfield Park,\u201d complete with \u201cstrange annotations, circa 1977,\u201d as an inscription explains. A display called \u201cThe End?\u201d looks at the way some admirers seek total communion, even in death. The curators quote a letter from the director of Jane Austen\u2019s House Museum, who in 2008 implored Janeites not to direct their heirs to scatter their ashes on the grounds. \u201cIt is distressing for visitors,\u201d she noted, \u201cto see mounds of human ash. \u201d But the Folger itself is a mausoleum. As the show notes, the ashes of Henry Clay Folger and Emily Folger, the library\u2019s founders, are interred in the nearby reading room behind a plaque paying tribute to \u201cthe glory of William Shakespeare and the greater glory of God. \u201d \u201cWith that kind of idolatry, your first instinct may be to snicker,\u201d Ms. Barchas said. \u201cBut then you have to stop and think seriously about what it is that you yourself love about literature. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563323.0069888}
