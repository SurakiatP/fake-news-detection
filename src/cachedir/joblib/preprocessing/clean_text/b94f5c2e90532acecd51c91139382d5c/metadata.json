I was going to give the place the once over; fill a few holes where the kids put posters on their walls, change the lightbulbs in the utility room, that kind of thing\u2026 but even if you do all that, the owners will find a way to goose you out of your security deposit. To be honest, the money you\u2019d get back isn\u2019t worth losing a whole weekend doing odd-jobs over\u201d. \\nOther odd-jobs, including stability in the Middle East, health care, gun control, poverty, weeds between the patio slabs out the back, and taxation reform will all be \u2018left to the next lad\u2019, confirmed Obama.'"}, "time": 1742562211.4845896}
