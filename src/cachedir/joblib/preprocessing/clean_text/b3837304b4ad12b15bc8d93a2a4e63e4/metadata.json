As a lonely teenager in the Bronx, she would regularly escape downtown, soaking up Latin poetry slams at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe and hanging out with crusty punks in Tompkins Square Park. \u201cI always remember punk kids saying to me, \u2018You\u2019re not Puerto Rican, you\u2019re white,\u2019\u201d Ms. Segarra said. \u201cAnd the Puerto Rican kids would say: \u2018Who dresses like you? Who are you really? \u2019\u201d The question stung because Ms. Segarra herself didn\u2019t know the answer. \u201cI hadn\u2019t internalized my heritage,\u201d she said. \u201cI was still finding most of my heroes in white men, feeling like they\u2019re the ones who make history. I believed what was shoved down my throat. \u201d The art she made reflected that view. Even deep into her 20s, as Ms. Segarra rose as a critically admired   on three albums released under the band name Hurray for the Riff Raff, she kept her lineage at bay. Instead, her music explored the blues and folk roots of Americana. Only last year, as she approached her 30th birthday, did Ms. Segarra confront her internalized cultural exile with the intent to reconcile the disparate strands of her identity. The results can be heard on her ambitious new work with the band due on Friday, \u201cThe Navigator,\u201d a    concept album that traces the wanderings of a character named Navita Milagros Negr\u00f3n. Ms. Segarra fashioned the story as an imaginary Off Broadway play \u201cstarring\u201d the musicians, \u201cdirected by\u201d its producer and featuring a faux Playbill to guide listeners through. The music uses her contradictions to her advantage, mixing rock guitars with bomba rhythms, while melding original lyrics with some verse from the Puerto Rican poet Pedro Pietri. The songs connect the dots in a long history of Latin influences in popular music, from the   harmonies of   to Brill Building hits like \u201cSave the Last Dance for Me,\u201d to the   of Mink DeVille. On a recent winter afternoon, Ms. Segarra returned to the Nuyorican Poets Cafe to discuss her early alienation, framing it, in part, as a product of assimilation. When she was growing up, her mother, Ninfa Segarra, had a thriving career as an educator and a politician, rising to become the deputy mayor of New York under Rudolph W. Giuliani. Her father was a vice principal and a music teacher in the Bronx, where he taught the singer and actor Marc Anthony as a youth. The couple split when Ms. Segarra was a child, and she was reared mainly by her   aunt and uncle in Marble Hill. Ms. Segarra\u2019s father introduced her to the clave rhythms of   music, yet she gravitated more toward the videos of Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra beloved by her aunt and uncle. Puberty ignited in her a rebellious side, which found reflection in punk bands like the Dead Kennedys and Bikini Kill. \u201cI started to feel very angry about my place in the world as a girl,\u201d Ms. Segarra said. \u201cI wanted to go wherever I wanted without fear of danger, to be treated the same as my brother. \u201d In high school, she formed an acoustic punk group with other young women, modeled on the music of the   singer Kimya Dawson. She also began to spend more time in the East Village, identifying with women who shaved their heads but not their armpits. Failing in school and feeling like a drain on her family, Ms. Segarra ran away from home to squat on the Lower East Side. \u201cI was really scared  \u2014   and really hungry,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I was determined to live the life of an artist that everyone said was impossible. \u201d Aching for experience and escape, Ms. Segarra took to the road, hopping trains until she finally ended up settling in New Orleans by her 18th birthday. There, she found street kids she connected with more deeply. Together, they began performing songs by Woody Guthrie, whose wanderings Ms. Segarra\u2019s own had echoed. She lived by busking, getting good enough at her craft to make home recordings that earned some buzz, starting with \u201cIt Don\u2019t Mean I Don\u2019t Love You\u201d (2008). In 2014, Ms. Segarra was signed to ATO Records for \u201cSmall Town Heroes,\u201d which proved a critical breakthrough. Yet she felt unsatisfied in her work. To focus, she moved to Nashville, where she didn\u2019t know anyone. \u201cI began to ask myself, \u2018Who am I when everyone I know is gone? \u2019\u201d she said. The answer manifested itself in \u201cThe Navigator. \u201d Ms. Segarra felt   to simply mimic Latin rhythms for the album. \u201c\u2018Ziggy Stardust\u2019 was a eureka moment,\u201d she said, referring to the intergalactic David Bowie album and alter ego. \u201cI learned I could create a character, the Navigator, who would stand at the intersection of all these identities and weave in and out. And I related to being the alien. I began to take that as a badge of honor. \u201d For musical role models, Ms. Segarra looked to earlier Latin artists heavily influenced by rock, like the Ghetto Brothers, a politically active Puerto Rican street gang turned band that recorded one album in 1971. She also looked to Rodriguez, whom she discovered from the documentary \u201cSearching for Sugarman. \u201d The album\u2019s lyrics conform to rock rather than to theatrical music, favoring poetic abstractions over clear narrative. Themes of gentrification and cultural appropriation center the work, all boldly delivered by Ms. Segarra\u2019s billowing vibrato. Along the way, she gives a nod to the Young Lords, the Puerto Rican activist group of the \u201960s and \u201970s. In turn, Ms. Segarra finally took full ownership of her heritage. \u201cBefore, when I heard Latin sounds in popular music, I thought: That music belongs to everyone. Now I think: Oh, that\u2019s the sound of where I came from. Look what we brought to the culture. Listen to what we added. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562045.7580526}
