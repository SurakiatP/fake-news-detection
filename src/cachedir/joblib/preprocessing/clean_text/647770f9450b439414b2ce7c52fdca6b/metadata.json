[The tweets included threats against Front National leader Marine Le Pen, who he threatened to kill, but their author Medhi Meklat, 24, and his supporters have shrugged them off as a joke.  \u201cI am going to slit your throat Muslim style\u201d read the tweet threatening Le Pen. Another called for \u201cHitler to kill all the Jews\u201d while a third said he wanted to \u201crape\u201d former Charlie Hebdo    Charb, one of the victims of the January 2015 terror attacks, with a \u201cLaguiole knife\u201d. The tweets were published under the pseudonym \u2018Marcelin Deschamps\u2019 described by Meklat as a \u201cshameful\u201d \u201cfictional character\u201d whose thoughts were \u201cquite the opposite\u201d of his own. \u201d But they remained on the account after Meklat switched it to his name in 2015. This weekend they were outed by a fellow Twitter user who was outraged after seeing Meklat on TV promoting his new book, Le Monde has reported. On Saturday Meklat cleaned the account, deleting around 50, 000 tweets spanning back over a number of years to leave just 503 remaining. He also used the platform to issue an apology, writing \u201cI\u2019m sorry if these tweets shocked some of you. they are obsolete\u201d adding \u201cthrough Marcelin Deschamps, I was questioning the notion of excess and provocation. \u201d But his claims have not convinced everyone. The   secularist organisation Printemps Republicain [Republican Spring] have slammed the tweets as \u201cserious\u201d and \u201cwithin the scope of the law\u201d. They have accused the media of bearing some responsibility for the tweets, having \u201cpromoted\u201d and \u201cpraised\u201d Meklat. Had he been a member of France\u2019s National Front, they said, Meklat \u201cwould have been instantly and quite rightly pilloried by the same media, and would certainly have found himself in court\u201d they added in a statement. And they dismissed claims that Meklat, under the pseudonym Deschamps, was acting satirically in the same vein as the provocative magazine Charlie Hebdo arguing that Meklat had \u201conly attacked certain categories of people [  \u2026    ] Charlie Hebdo attacks everyone. \u201d Born in the notorious Paris suburb of    where riots have recently been raging, Meklat gained prominence through his writing for the Bondy Blog, a   blog set up following the 2005 Paris riots and financed by George Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundation. Lauded as the authentic voice of France\u2019s migrant communities, Meklat has capitalised on his media exposure to escape the banlieues, spending summers aboard yatchs in Los Angeles, and networking with esteemed institutions such as the Cartier Foundation to work on joint projects.
