S. A. colors day and wore red, white, and blue and U. S.   clothing to last week\u2019s game against North High School.  But the effort was deemed \u201ccontroversial\u201d by members of North High because their school has a \u201cdiverse\u201d student body. \u201cA lot of people were very upset about it,\u201d North sophomore DeNasja Spencer told CBS affiliate KCCI TV. \u201cEven if that was their theme for the game, I feel like they should have switched that because everyone knows North is a more diverse school,\u201d she added. On Facebook, a Valley High alum named Ty Leggett slammed the students. \u201cThis is an example of BLATANT racism,\u201d he wrote. \u201cALL participating should have been pulled and banned from ALL VHS extracurricular events for the remainder of the year! As a parent, I\u2019d be mortified that my son or daughter thought this way, acted in this fashion and refrained from taking a stand against this 21st century inexcusable behavior!\u201d Des Moines North coach Chad Ryan claimed he didn\u2019t want to \u201cjudge those young people not knowing their motive,\u201d but went on to say, \u201cIt\u2019s been good for us, as a school. They learn from each other about people with different cultures and backgrounds  \u2014   and we try to use it as an educational piece. \u201d This isn\u2019t the first time Valley has sponsored a patriotic day. Valley High fans reportedly wore patriotic colors during a football game against rival Dowling Catholic this year as well. \u201cWe had a USA theme, which we\u2019ve done many times in the past,\u201d Valley freshman Dayna Dunnwald told the media. \u201cIt\u2019s really sad, and I hope everyone can resolve it in the end because no one at Valley meant it in that way. And it was just for fun. \u201d Another student, Melissa   was disgusted by the attacks on her school, \u201cNow we can\u2019t wear USA stuff without making someone upset? Oh please  \u2026    . \u201d Despite the past patriotic events, Valley High School\u2019s student leadership members apologized to North High\u2019s principal. \u201cIt has been brought to our attention that the decision by the Valley High School student section to wear U. S. A. apparel at our game last night was offensive to members of your community and fan base,\u201d the student letter read. \u201cWe are deeply sorry if we have offended anyone in any way. We have traditionally dressed in such a fashion for great games such as the one last night. Everyone here at Valley has immense respect not only for your team and players but for your community as a whole. Please know that our intent was in no way to offend or demean \u2014  just to support our own team in a way we have done before. \u201d Valley High\u2019s Tigers ended up defeating the Des Moines North Polar Bears  .
