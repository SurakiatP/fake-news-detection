The allegations were confirmed by House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, who said that FBI director James Comey had told him about the exposure previously.\\n\u201cShe exposed [information] to our enemies,\u201d the Republican representative from Texas said on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d on Thursday morning. \u201cOur adversaries have this very sensitive information\u2026 In my opinion, quite frankly, it\u2019s treason.\u201d \\nMcCaul added that there are concerns not only about the content of the emails, but also access to the communication protocols of special access programs used on government-issued electronic devices.\\n\u201cNow countries like Russia and China and Iran have the most highly-sensitive programs in the United States. And the President of the US is communicating with them,\u201d he alleged. \u201cThey are not stupid. They can figure that out as well.\u201d \\nMcCaul has said earlier that he has been briefing Republican candidate Donald Trump on security issues.\\nDirector Comey previously hinted at the possibility that foreign nations had hacked into Clinton\u2019s server, but the Democrat candidate pushed back, saying the FBI director was \u201cspeculating.\u201d\\nThe new accusations come after the FBI relaunched an investigation into the use of Clinton\u2019s private server after discovering additional emails on the laptop of ex-Representative Anthony Weiner in the course of a separate investigation. Weiner\u2019s electronic devices, as well as those belonging to his wife, senior Clinton aide Huma Abedin, were seized during that probe.\\nAfter the bombshell that investigation was being reopened dropped last week, some Democrats accused the FBI director of trying to influence the election.
