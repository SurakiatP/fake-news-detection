But the company\u2019s claims are now under threat after Europe\u2019s antitrust authorities on Wednesday charged the company with unfairly using Android to promote its own services  \u2014   like mobile search  \u2014   over those of its rivals. In doing so, regulators brought particular scrutiny to Google\u2019s relationships with some of the world\u2019s biggest cellphone makers, which have helped expand the reach of Android. Margrethe Vestager, the European Union\u2019s antitrust chief, said Google had required some of the cellphone manufacturers to preinstall the company\u2019s services, including its Google Play smartphone application store, and had given them unfair financial incentives to favor Google\u2019s services on their mobile devices. Those practices undermined competition and consumer choice, she said. \u201cGoogle has abused its dominant position,\u201d Ms. Vestager said on Wednesday. The company\u2019s \u201cbehavior has harmed consumers by restricting innovation in the wider mobile space. \u201d The company denies it has broken European competition rules, and the charges may not lead to financial or other penalties against Google, which now has three months to respond to the accusations. \u201cWe take these concerns seriously,\u201d Kent Walker, Google\u2019s general counsel, said in a blog post. \u201cBut we also believe that our business model keeps manufacturers\u2019 costs low and their flexibility high, while giving consumers unprecedented control of their mobile devices. \u201d By taking aim at Android  \u2014   the mobile software that holds more than 80 percent of the worldwide market share for smartphone operating systems  \u2014   Europe has opened the latest chapter in its continuing battle with American technology companies. These players, including Amazon and Facebook, dominate how Europe\u2019s 500 million people use digital services, including social media, online movies and  . Google is facing separate charges, filed last year, in Europe over whether it unfairly favored some of its search services over those of rivals. Europe\u2019s antitrust claims highlight Google\u2019s increasingly thorny relationships with smartphone manufacturers such as HTC and Samsung, among others. Ms. Vestager said Android\u2019s prominent role in the mobile market was not in question but that she was concerned the contracts the company signed with smartphone manufacturers had made it difficult, if not impossible, for rival search engines and smartphone app stores to compete in the European Union. \u201cIf a company is dominant, that\u2019s fine,\u201d Ms. Vestager told reporters. \u201cBut if that dominance is abused, then we have an issue. \u201d She declined to name which cellphone manufacturers might be affected, citing their right to privacy. The device makers, already struggling against cutthroat competition, have become reliant on Google\u2019s digital services available on Android, even as they have tried to persuade consumers to try their own mobile services or those of Google\u2019s competitors. Some, including Samsung, have backed rival operating systems to loosen Android\u2019s grip, but such efforts have so far proved unsuccessful. And while global cellphone manufacturers once profited from using Android to expand rapidly, particularly in emerging markets, their growth has since slowed. Analysts say these cellphone makers\u2019 inability to wean consumers off Google\u2019s popular mobile mapping, email and other services has potentially shut them out of billions of dollars in extra revenue as people\u2019s digital habits  \u2014   including online search and   purchases  \u2014   shift to mobile devices. \u201cTheir attempts at beating Google\u2019s services haven\u2019t worked,\u201d said Neil Mawston, a mobile analyst at the technology research group Strategy Analytics. \u201cFor most companies that want to operate in the smartphone market, there isn\u2019t another option but to use Google. \u201d Representatives from the leading smartphone manufacturers declined to comment on their relationship with Google. The dominance of Android, at least in Europe and the United States, is almost absolute. The basic Android software can be downloaded for free and modified by device makers and telecom operators. But they must sign contracts that place a selection of Google\u2019s services in prime spots on smartphone screens and link to the company\u2019s app store, from which Google takes a cut of each application sold. The search giant also generates income from advertising from mobile search queries, though manufacturers are free to include their own applications as part of the mobile software. In total, Google\u2019s version of Android powers more than 98 percent of the   smartphones in Europe and the United States, according to Ian Fogg, a senior director at IHS, a technology consultancy in London. Only in China, where Google is banned, and Russia, where the local search engine Yandex holds a significant market share, does Google not dominate in mobile. \u201cIf someone buys an Android device in Europe or the U. S. it\u2019s almost certainly Google\u2019s version,\u201d said David McQueen, research director at ABI Research in London. Google says its relationships with cellphone manufacturers are voluntary and that rival mobile services, including those from the likes of Amazon and Facebook, are readily available on its Android software, which does not restrict people from downloading competitors\u2019 applications. The search giant has also pointed to smartphones from Amazon and Nokia that are based on the free version of Android and that do not come packaged with Google\u2019s mobile services as signs of healthy competition. Those devices, particularly Amazon\u2019s Fire smartphone, have not proved popular with consumers. Kirt McMaster, the chief executive of Cyanogen, an American   that makes a mobile operating system based on Android, said he was cautiously optimistic that the regulatory intervention could improve innovation on the operating system. \u201cThere are ways to enable   services on top of Android today, even within the confines of the existing relationships,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are scenarios that will be beneficial for the ecosystem if Android was even more open. \u201d If Google is found to have broken European rules, the company may face fines of as much as 10 percent of its annual revenue. Given the company\u2019s recent annual revenue, that could be roughly $7 billion. Such a high financial penalty is unlikely, however, according to legal experts. The company could also be forced to alter its Android software to give competitors a greater position in its mobile software or to change its existing contracts with cellphone makers. That would potentially provide Europeans with a wider choice of mobile services than would be available to their American counterparts. Most people in the 28 member states of the European Union, though, still rely primarily on Google services for many daily activities. Such remedies, if eventually imposed on Google, would be reminiscent of similar steps taken by Microsoft, which in 2009 agreed to offer consumers a choice of rival web browsers to end a European antitrust investigation into its dominance of Internet browsers at that time. Paulo Trezentos, chief executive of Aptoide, a rival Portuguese Android app store that is one of the complainants in the European competition case against Google, said his company would welcome greater access to Android users. \u201cGoogle makes it difficult for people to install applications from rivals,\u201d Mr. Trezentos said. \u201cIt\u2019s actively making it harder to compete. \u201d In the United States, some lawmakers on Wednesday called on the Federal Trade Commission to more closely scrutinize Google after Europe\u2019s charges. In 2013, the F. T. C. closed a   antitrust investigation into Google\u2019s search business, citing a lack of evidence for pursuing a case. The F. T. C. said it did not comment on or confirm investigations. Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, who is a member of the Judiciary Committee, said regulations and laws differed in Europe and the United States but \u201cthe spirit and goal of our laws is very similar. \u201d \u201cThere is now clearly a need for exacting and penetrating scrutiny,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal said in an interview. \u201cPerhaps it is overdue. But it is now clearly necessary. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563400.3575761}
