A few months ago, the boyish    let the lease expire on his Cold Spring, N. Y. apartment, and dumped or donated virtually everything he owned, more than 40 garbage bags of sheets, dishes, clothes, books, his college diploma, even childhood photo albums. Since then, he\u2019s been bouncing among friends\u2019 apartments and Airbnb rentals. It is not that he is down on his luck. Several of the 16 books he has written, including his 2013   manifesto, \u201cChoose Yourself,\u201d continue to sell briskly. His weekly podcasts, \u201cThe James Altucher Show,\u201d featuring interviews with notables as diverse as Ron Paul and Luther Campbell of 2 Live Crew, and \u201cQuestion of the Day,\u201d with Stephen Dubner, are downloaded about two million times a month. Mr. Altucher is simply practicing what he preaches. Over the last   this former tech entrepreneur, venture capitalist and financial pundit has reinvented himself as a     guru, preaching survival in an era when the American Dream  \u2014   the   college diploma, the corner office, the   home  \u2014   seems like a sham. So one by one, he has shed all of them. \u201cI have ambition,\u201d he said, \u201cto have no ambition. \u201d \u201cIn the past 25 years, income has gone down for the      student loan debt is at an   high,\u201d Mr. Altucher said over a lunch of zucchini pancakes at a Russian restaurant in the Flatiron district. \u201cWe had $3 trillion in bailout money, and income inequality got higher than ever. People feel like they were scammed. \u201d Mr. Altucher\u2019s diagnosis will come as no surprise to the anxious middle class, the downsized and the dispossessed who have propelled the angry populism of Bernie Sanders and Donald J. Trump. But while there is no shortage of anger and confusion about the supposed waning of the American Dream, what makes Mr. Altucher stand out are his   conclusions. College, he says, is a waste of money. Although he graduated from Cornell, Mr. Altucher argues that the college degree has become a costly luxury in a world where millennials feel like debt serfs and   professional jobs are scarce. In a 2012   book, \u201c40 Alternatives to College,\u201d he argued that young adults could travel the world, educate themselves online and start a business with the same $200, 000 they may spend on college. Investing the money with even a 5 percent return would offer greater financial benefit over the course of a lifetime, he wrote in a  blog post. Similarly, he believes homeownership is a   foisted upon unwitting citizens by a $14 trillion mortgage industry. \u201cIt\u2019s a total scam,\u201d he said in an online interview. \u201cNobody should put more than 5 to 10 percent of their portfolio, their assets, in any one investment. But when people buy a home, they go crazy. They put like 50, 60, 70 percent of their net worth into this one investment. It\u2019s illiquid, so when times are hard, you can\u2019t sell it. \u201d And he think stocks are a racket. It\u2019s a fierce worldview that is rooted in Mr. Altucher\u2019s own   life. In the 1990s, as a young Silicon Alley   whiz, Mr. Altucher made millions with a   company, Reset Inc. that counted Sony and Miramax as clients. Soon, he and his wife at the time, Anne (they divorced in 2010) were living in a    loft in TriBeCa that he bought for $1. 8 million and spent another $1 million renovating. He felt flush enough to take a helicopter to Atlantic City on weekends to play poker. The lavish lifestyle did not fill his emotional void. \u201cNobody should feel sorry for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI was really stupid, but I thought I was dirt poor. I felt like I needed $100 million to be happy. So I just started investing in all these other companies, and they were just stupid companies. Zero of these investments worked out. \u201d As his fortunes collapsed, he was forced to sell his apartment for a $1 million loss (it was after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001). To reclaim his wealth, he set his sights on the stock market. He read more than a hundred books on investing, and eventually wrangled a job writing for James Cramer\u2019s site, TheStreet, and later The Financial Times. Before long, his trademark hairdo, which looks like carnival cotton candy spun from steel wool, was a familiar sight on CNBC. But his fortunes crumbled once again during the financial crisis that began in 2008. The hedge fund he started ran out of gas, various   withered, writing gigs dried up. With few options open, he decided to chronicle his failures on a personal blog, which he named Altucher Confidential. \u201cI just said, \u2018I\u2019ve made every mistake in the book: Here\u2019s what they are,\u2019\u201d Mr. Altucher said. To Wall Street friends, he seemed like Howard Beale, the anchorman in \u201cNetwork\u201d who had a meltdown  . Instead of touting the latest hot mutual fund, he wrote posts like \u201c10 Reasons You Should Never Own Stocks Again. \u201d (Reason No. 1: You\u2019re not that good at it.) He confessed thoughts of suicide. \u201cFinancial people were like watching a train wreck in real time,\u201d Mr. Altucher said. \u201cI had friends I hadn\u2019t talked to since high school call me and say, \u2018Hey, are you O. K.?\u2019\u201d He soon discovered a sizable audience of people whose own dreams had just gone down the sinkhole. They, too, were looking to claw their way out. \u201cThe No. 1 search phrase on Google that takes people to my blog is \u2018I want to die,\u2019\u201d Mr. Altucher said. But Mr. Altucher seems like an unlikely person to look to for solace. Bookish, contrarian and given to speaking in staccato bursts, this skinny computer geek from North Brunswick, N. J. is like the   Robbins, the strapping   star. His   appearance turned out to be a plus, as he developed a following blogging about his     \u201clife hacker\u201d experiments. There was \u201cthe 5 p. m. diet,\u201d in which he eats nothing after that time (\u201cYour face gets more angular. I\u2019ve seen it happen. Not just with me. With everyone on this   diet\u201d). There was \u201cthe alien trick\u201d to beat anxiety, in which he pretends to be an alien and wake up every day on another planet with a new body (\u201cI have no worries because tomorrow I will be in a new body. No envies. No worries. Only new things to explore\u201d). There was his zombie email gimmick, when he would respond to unread emails from seven years ago: \u201cSure! I\u2019ll have coffee today\u201d (\u201cPeople laugh and all is forgiven,\u201d he said). By writing candidly about his own triumphs and flameouts, Mr. Altucher \u201cshows readers how they can succeed despite their flaws, not because of a lack of flaws,\u201d said Tim Ferriss, author of the   \u201c \u201d   series. \u201cThis is hugely refreshing in a world of     gurus who are all forced smiles and  . \u201d It helped that Mr. Altucher, despite his biting views on topics like college, maintained a positive tone. \u201cI am an optimist,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a great novel from the \u201860s by Richard Fari\u00f1a called \u2018Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me.\u2019 Basically, I\u2019ve been down on the floor so many times, I know now that I can always bounce back, and it gets faster each time. \u201d His philosophy is perhaps most clearly articulated in \u201cChoose Yourself,\u201d which he summarized over lunch like this: \u201cIf you don\u2019t choose the life you want to live, chances are, someone else is going to choose it for you. And the results are probably not going to be pretty. \u201d Chapters include \u201cHow to Be Less Stupid\u201d (\u201cI lose at least 20 percent of my intelligence when I am resentful\u201d) and \u201cThe Seven Habits of Highly Effective Mediocre People\u201d (procrastination, he writes, \u201cis your body telling you that you need to back off a bit and think more about what you are doing\u201d). A key tenet of the book is the Daily Practice, a wellness regimen that comprises the physical (eat well, try to go to sleep by 9 p. m. and rise by 5 a. m. break a sweat for at least 10 minutes a day) emotional (be around people you love, who love you) mental (write a list of 10 ideas each day to exercise the \u201cidea muscle\u201d before it atrophies) and spiritual (feel gratitude every day). He calls them the four pillars of happiness. \u201cA chair needs four legs to be stable,\u201d he said. And there has never been a better time to choose yourself, he said. You do not have to be Mark Zuckerberg, he said, to be an entrepreneur. \u201cYou can learn basic web development,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can go to Codecademy. com, learn the basic skills in three months, then sell them on Freelancer. com, where there are millions of jobs. I know    who are making a few thousand dollars a month. \u201d Thanks to   you don\u2019t have to be Deepak Chopra to write books. \u201cEverybody is or can be an expert on something,\u201d he said. \u201cTake me: I haven\u2019t been in the kitchen in 20 years. I hate eating vegan. But how hard would it be to read every book on veganism, buy some ingredients, write up a little book: \u2018The  \u2019s Vegan Cookbook\u2019?\u201d He would know. \u201cChoose Yourself,\u201d which Mr. Altucher   on Amazon, sold more than a   copies, he said, and made The Wall Street Journal\u2019s   list. His fans swear by him. One reader, Beck Power, recently wrote an essay on Medium about how he inspired her to ditch a frustrating job to start her own online travel business. \u201cI dance in my underwear,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t have panic attacks anymore. \u201d A talk he gave at a London church last year drew about 1, 000 people, and fans have organized \u201cChoose Yourself\u201d meetups in cities around the world. On LinkedIn, where he publishes original free essays, Mr. Altucher has more than 485, 000 followers and is ranked the No. 4 \u201cinfluencer,\u201d after Bill Gates, Richard Branson and Mohamed A.   the financier and author. \u201cHe\u2019s the Oprah of the internet,\u201d said Kamal Ravikant, a tech entrepreneur who wrote the   Amazon best seller \u201cLove Yourself Like Your Life Depends on It. \u201d Unlike most gurus, \u201cJames is on a very personal journey, allowing his readers and listeners to experience it in real time,\u201d said Brian Koppelman, a creator of Showtime\u2019s \u201cBillions,\u201d who also moderates \u201cThe Moment,\u201d a podcast on Slate. \u201cHe\u2019s telling you the story on Saturday, on Sunday he\u2019s talking about how it failed, and on Monday he\u2019s talking about doing it a different way. \u201d Mr. Altucher, in fact, disputes that he is a guru in the first place. \u201cI am not a   guy at all,\u201d he said. \u201cAdvice is autobiography,\u201d he added. \u201cI only say what has worked for me, and then others can choose to try it or not. \u201d Besides, what worked yesterday may not work tomorrow. \u201cIt\u2019s like Mike Tyson says,\u201d Mr. Altucher said. \u201c\u2018Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face. \u2019\u201d'"}, "time": 1742561655.2390382}
