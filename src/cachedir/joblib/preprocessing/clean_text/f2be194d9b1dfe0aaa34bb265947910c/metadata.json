While the Pentagon\u2019s public goal has duly sought to wrest control from Assad and fight the Islamic State, the CIA program of arming rebels is widely considered counterproductive \u2014 if not, perhaps, nefarious.\\nPlan B, despite potentially devastating repercussions, retains stolid support from top officials, including unsurprisingly CIA Director John Brennan and Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter \u2014 but has lost favor recently with former proponents, including Secretary of State John Kerry.\\nKerry and other skeptics rightly grasp providing heavy artillery to rebels fighting Russia-backed Syrian government forces to down Russian aircraft \u2014 which would undoubtedly turn the smoldering U.S. proxy battle into an all-out war with Russia.\\nAdditionally, the Post reports, a growing number of U.S. officials feel the contentious CIA program has only proven to bedevil the ultimate goal of regime change, and, as one unnamed \u2018senior official\u2019 noted, CIA units are \u201cnot doing any better on the battlefield, they\u2019re up against a more formidable adversary, and they\u2019re increasingly dominated by extremists,\u201d adding, \u201cWhat has this program become, and how will history record this effort?\u201d'"}, "time": 1742562189.376228}
