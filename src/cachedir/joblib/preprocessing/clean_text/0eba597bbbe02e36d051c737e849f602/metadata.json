Plus, check out our fact checks and our email exchanges with Walter F. Mondale, the 42nd vice president of the United States. Mr. Kaine challenged Mr. Pence repeatedly to defend statements or proposals made by Donald J. Trump during his chaotic and improvisational presidential campaign, forcing Mr. Pence to filibuster and dodge for minutes on end. It was not quite a defensive crouch: Mr. Pence\u2019s tone and his calm delivery never wavered, and he continued to deflect and deny questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s ideas while turning back to the Obama administration\u2019s foreign policy record. Yet it opened the door for Mr. Kaine  \u2014   who often interrupted Mr. Pence  \u2014   to hammer away at Mr. Trump\u2019s business ties to Russian banks, his campaign team\u2019s lobbying work for a Ukrainian strongman and Mr. Trump\u2019s   praise for Vladimir Putin. When Mr. Pence broached the idea that the Obama administration had let Russia dominate the response to Syrian policy, Mr. Kaine wore an expression that looked vaguely sad, as though he couldn\u2019t believe Mr. Pence had gone there. What followed was a thumping: Mr. Kaine reeled off chapter and verse on Mr. Trump\u2019s musings on the Russian autocrat and Mr. Putin\u2019s own record as president, from Russia\u2019s struggling economy to his persecution of gay people and journalists. Mr. Pence tried repeatedly to argue that Mr. Trump hadn\u2019t said the things Mr. Kaine had claimed. When that failed, he tried to suggest that merely quoting Mr. Trump was to engage in insults. That set Mr. Kaine up for a revealing summation. \u201cSix times tonight I have said to Governor Pence I can\u2019t imagine how you can defend your running mate\u2019s position,\u201d Mr. Kaine said. \u201cHe is asking everybody to vote for somebody that he cannot defend. \u201d \u2022 Mr. Pence criticized Hillary Clinton for using a private email server as secretary of state. After Mr. Kaine said that Mrs. Clinton had been cleared by \u201ca Republican F. B. I. director,\u201d Mr. Pence fired back. \u201cIf your son or my son handled classified information the way Hillary Clinton did, they\u2019d be \u201d he said. \u2022 Mr. Kaine, noting that he and his wife were the parents of a Marine, said that \u201cthe thought of Donald Trump as    scares us to death. \u201d Mr. Pence replied that President Obama\u2019s tenure had weakened the country\u2019s standing in the world. \u2022 After Mr. Kaine said that Mr. Trump had \u201cpursued the discredited and really outrageous lie that President Obama wasn\u2019t born in the United States,\u201d Mr. Pence accused the   ticket of trafficking in \u201can avalanche of insults. \u201d When Mr. Pence mentioned Russia, Mr. Kaine cut in. \u201cYou guys love Russia!\u201d he said. Mr. Pence, appearing taken back by the interruption, said, \u201cI must have hit a nerve. \u201d \u2022 Deflecting a question about Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion that he was savvy to avoid paying taxes, Mr. Pence said that his running mate was \u201ca businessman, not a career politician. \u201d Mr. Kaine interjected: \u201cWhy won\u2019t he release his tax returns?\u201d Mr. Pence shot back, \u201cWe\u2019re answering the question about the business thing. \u201d \u2022 Responding to a question about gun violence and the police, Mr. Kaine spoke of the mass shooting at Virginia Tech, which occurred when he was governor, and called for increased background checks and strengthening the ties between officers and the areas they patrol. Mr. Pence, who said his uncle was a police officer in Chicago, said, \u201cat risk of agreeing with you, community policing is a great idea. \u201d But he accused Democrats of \u201c \u201d officers in the wake of shootings by the police. \u2022 Mr. Kaine unleashed a blistering attack on Mr. Trump\u2019s trail of contentious comments during the campaign, ticking off his remarks about Mexicans, women,   an   judge with Mexican heritage and Senator John McCain of Arizona. \u201cI just want to talk about the tone that\u2019s set from the top,\u201d Mr. Kaine said. Mr. Pence said his running mate\u2019s statements were \u201csmall potatoes\u201d compared to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s remark last month that half of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters fit into a \u201cbasket of deplorables. \u201d Mr. Kaine replied that Mrs. Clinton had apologized for her remark  \u2014   though, as Mr. Pence pointed out, her apology focused on the \u201chalf,\u201d not the descriptor. Mr. Trump, Mr. Kaine said, has refused to apologize for any of his comments. \u2022 Mr. Kaine condemned Mr. Trump\u2019s foreign policy credentials, saying that the Republican nominee \u201ccan\u2019t start a Twitter war with Miss Universe without shooting himself in the foot. \u201d Mr. Pence suggested that Mr. Kaine sounded rehearsed. \u201cDid you work on that one a long time?\u201d he asked. Mr. Pence said that America was \u201cless safe today\u201d than it was when Mr. Obama took office. \u2022 Sparring over refugee policies, Mr. Pence and Mr. Kaine fiercely defended their running mates\u2019 approaches, with Mr. Pence arguing that Mrs. Clinton would expose the country to heightened risks. Mr. Kaine framed it another way: \u201cWe want to keep people out if they\u2019re dangerous,\u201d he said. \u201cDonald Trump said, \u2018keep them out if they\u2019re Muslim. \u2019\u201d \u2022 Mr. Pence, seizing on recent comments from Bill Clinton that appeared to be critical of the Affordable Care Act, said that \u201ceven former President Bill Clinton calls Obamacare a crazy plan. \u201d (Mrs. Clinton\u2019s team has moved this week to clarify his remarks, with her husband saying that he always supported the measure and still does.) Mr. Kaine did not immediately respond to the remark, setting off on an answer about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s own economic plans. \u2022 After Mr. Kaine mentioned Mr. Trump\u2019s frequent praise of Vladimir Putin and the Trump campaign\u2019s \u201cshadowy connections with   forces,\u201d Mr. Pence blamed the Obama administration\u2019s \u201cweak and feckless foreign policy\u201d for Russian aggression. \u201cThere\u2019s an old proverb,\u201d Mr. Pence said, \u201cthat says the Russian bear never dies, it just hibernates. \u201d \u2022 Mr. Kaine, turning repeatedly to Mr. Trump\u2019s tax avoidance, sought to frame the issue as a matter of national security importance. After the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, Mr. Kaine said, \u201cyoung men and women signed up to serve in the military to fight terrorism\u201d and Mrs. Clinton fought for constituents as a New York senator. \u201cDonald Trump was fighting a very different fight,\u201d he said: skirting tax payments that might have boosted American defenses. \u2022 Mr. Kaine accused Mr. Pence of declining to forcefully defend Mr. Trump during the debate, pointing to his frequent deflections when confronted with Mr. Trump\u2019s past comments. \u201cHe is asking everybody to vote for somebody that he cannot defend,\u201d Mr. Kaine said. Mr. Pence said he was happy to defend Mr. Trump and accused Mr. Kaine of both misrepresenting Mr. Trump and putting words in his mouth. \u2022 Mr. Pence said that Mrs. Clinton had engaged in \u201c   politics\u201d as secretary of state, citing potential conflicts of interest with the Clinton Foundation. \u201cI am glad to talk about the foundation,\u201d Mr. Kaine said. \u201cThe Clinton Foundation is one of the   charities in the world. \u201d He turned the focus on Mr. Trump\u2019s foundation, which he suggested  \u2014   alluding to several newspaper investigations  \u2014   had often veered far from traditional philanthropy. \u2022 Asked about the tension between faith and a public life, Mr. Kaine recalled grappling with his opposition (and the Catholic Church\u2019s) to the death penalty as governor of Virginia, where the law called for it in some cases. \u201cIt was very, very difficult to allow executions to go forward,\u201d he said, adding that he promised voters he would carry out the duties of his office. Mr. Pence said he had \u201ca great deal of respect for Senator Kaine\u2019s sincere faith. \u201d \u201cThat\u2019s shared,\u201d Mr. Kaine said. \u2022 After Mr. Pence spoke about his opposition to abortion, Mr. Kaine sought to paint the   ticket as extreme on the issue, noting that Mr. Trump had once suggested that women should be punished for having abortions if the practice were outlawed. (Mr. Trump later walked back the remark.) \u201cHe\u2019s not a polished politician like you and Hillary Clinton,\u201d Mr. Pence said.'"}, "time": 1742563876.542011}
