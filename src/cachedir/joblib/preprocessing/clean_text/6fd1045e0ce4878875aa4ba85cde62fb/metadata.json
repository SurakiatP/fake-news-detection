[\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was a great day for the media, said Caddell. \u201cHowever, if you watched some of the other cable news networks, you\u2019d think this was a disaster for Trump. It was anything but. \u201d He went on to call out the media for pursuing a political agenda, as opposed to the truth, saying that media today is actually \u201ca danger to democracy. \u201d  \u201cThe media really took it on the nose,\u201d he went on, pointing out that Trump was not lying about the three times he claims Comey told him he personally was not under investigation. \u201cHow come that didn\u2019t leak out? That is an interesting question because enough people knew on Capitol Hill, and it tells me that it was the media. And this was really the chilling part, that they have their narrative agenda, that Trump is in collusion, Trump is this, and Trump is that, and he\u2019s under investigation. They did not want to challenge that narrative. \u201d \u201cThey weren\u2019t reporting facts,\u201d continued Caddell. \u201cThey were reporting sources who would give them statements that would contribute to their   narrative. This is not a press. This is a propaganda machine. It\u2019s full speed against the president. \u201d Caddell said he could turn to almost any network and predict its coverage, \u201cIf Trump walked on water, they\u2019d say he couldn\u2019t swim. \u201d \u201cThey are so negative, as they were in the campaign,\u201d he went on. \u201cThey haven\u2019t let up, and they have invested themselves in a political result, not in telling the truth, and that is a danger to democracy. \u201d Caddell said the press has damaged the very institution of the press by having decided to bring down a president versus report the truth, and \u201cDemocrats are falling right into the path with them. \u201d As for Trump and Comey, Caddell said, \u201cComey basically vindicated him, first of all, on the question if there was collusion, or even on the Flynn matter  \u2014   whether there was obstruction, and it just doesn\u2019t hold,\u201d he continued. \u201cObviously, Mueller wouldn\u2019t let him testify if he thought there was an obstruction case. \u201d Added Caddell, \u201cComey\u2019s behavior is just bizarre. This man really believes that he is a demigod when it comes to the law. He keeps changing the goal lines. His weakness, which he confessed to, but I think it was more a device than a critical perception, whether it was with Loretta Lynch, when she asked him to conform to the Clinton campaign, which I thought was a revealing comment and opened up a lot of other doors, when he talked about his own leaking, volunteered how he had leaked and what he had done with those memos, I thought that was just really strange. His criticism of the media, he basically denied their stories. He\u2019s basically a very angry man, and I thought the White House handled Comey terribly, but that\u2019s neither here nor there. \u201d Caddell stated, \u201cHe was the one in the meetings, and he never raised a protest, and then he said a sentence that I was stunned by. He said, \u2018I did it because I gave my friend the memo to give to the New York Times because I thought we needed a special counsel.\u2019 Here\u2019s a man who wouldn\u2019t have a special counsel or wouldn\u2019t even investigate the IRS stuff, a person who didn\u2019t do it with Hillary Clinton, particularly in terms of the Clinton Foundation, and yet it was pointed out to him by a couple of the senators, you know, basically he gave her a whitewash. He wants to do this with Trump. I thought that was devastating and puts him in a very precarious place. \u201d Caddell added, \u201cIt chills me to think that this person was running the FBI. \u201d Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.
