But Israel\u2019s persistent settlement building has now left no other rational choice, notes Jonathan Marshall. \\nBy Jonathan Marshall \\nDonald Trump\u2019s election victory raises many unanswered questions, but it also settles a few, starting with the fate of the Israeli-Palestinian \u201cpeace process.\u201d In the words of Israeli Education Minister and Jewish Home Party leader Naftali Bennett, \u201cThe era of a Palestinian state is over.\u201d \\nLest anyone accuse the Israeli hardliner of wishful thinking, one need only recall candidate Trump\u2019s insistence last spring that Israelis \u201creally have to keep going\u201d with settling the territories that they have occupied since 1967. Two months later, the Republican Party changed its 2012 platform to omit support for a Palestinian state and to condemn the \u201cfalse notion that Israel is an occupier.\u201d   talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as they walk across the tarmac at Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv, Israel, March 20, 2013. (Official White House Photo by Pete Souza) \\nLast week, a co-chair of the Trump campaign\u2019s Israel Advisory Committee reaffirmed that the President-elect rejects Washington\u2019s traditional view that Israel\u2019s settlements are obstacles to peace and illegal under international law. \\nThe so-called \u201ctwo-state solution\u201d \u2014 creation of a Palestinian national homeland comprising the West Bank and Gaza, and coexisting with Israel \u2014 has been a longstanding axiom of official U.S. policy, accepted as well by Israel and its unofficial lobbying arm, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. \\nOf late, however, the rise of extreme Jewish nationalists to power in Israel, the relentless expansion of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, and Israel\u2019s evident disinterest in peace negotiations have all but killed hopes for such a solution. In 2015, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared , \u201cThere will be no withdrawals\u201d from the occupied West Bank and \u201cno concessions\u201d to the Palestinians. \\nAs Americans for Peace Now points out, \u201cmore than 40% of the West Bank is under the direct control of settlers or settlements and off-limits to Palestinians . . . Israel has taken hundreds of kilometers of the West Bank to build roads that serve the settlements, . . . dividing Palestinian cities and towns from each other, and imposing various barriers to Palestinian movement and access. . . Such settlements, and new settlement construction going on today, have the explicit goal of preventing the establishment of a Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem \u2013 which, in effect, means preventing the two-state solution.\u201d \\nMany of Israel\u2019s staunchest allies in the United States now concede this reality. Hillary Clinton, in a private email to one of her advisers, acknowledged in 2015 that the Israeli-Palestinian peace process had become a phony \u201cPotemkin\u201d spectacle. Secretary of State John Kerry warned publicly that Israeli settlement-building was \u201cimperiling the viability of a two-state solution.\u201d \\nRoger Cohen, the New York Times columnist and an ardent liberal Zionist, reported last month following a trip to Israel that the two-state idea is all but \u201cclinically dead.\u201d He explained: \u201cThe incorporation of all the biblical Land of Israel has advanced too far, for too long, to be reversed now.\u201d \\nMany Israeli supporters of a two-state solution now publicly admit that bitter truth. Former Prime Minister Ehud Barak accuses Netanyahu of engaging in a \u201cmessianic drive\u201d toward \u201ca single Jewish state, from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea.\u201d For the current crop of right-wing leaders in Israel, the main question is whether to offer Palestinians citizenship within an expanded Israel or to remove them. \\nPalestinians also concede privately that their dream of a state is dead. Said noted Palestinian pollster Khalil Shikaki, \u201cWe, Israelis and Palestinians, live in a one-state reality.\u201d Former Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qurei, declared bluntly, \u201cthere will be no alternative but one state. No alternative.\u201d \\nWhat Path Forward? \\nIf a Palestinian state is truly dead, Palestinians will need to give up their decades-old nationalist aspirations, a wrenching blow that many will find hard to accept. Israelis, in turn, will need to find room in a bi-national democratic state for millions of Palestinians \u2014 roughly equal in number to Jews \u2014 an even more wrenching adjustment that many will fight to the bitter end. Liberal Zionists have warned for years that refusal to accept a Palestinian state would force Israel to choose between remaining a democratic state or a Jewish state. A map showing Israeli settlements in the Palestinian Territories. \\nAs former Prime Minister Barak put it , the \u201coverarching ambition\u201d of absorbing the occupied territories \u201cis bound to culminate in either a single, binational state, which, within a generation, may have a Jewish minority and likely a Bosnia-like civil war, or else an apartheid reality if Palestinian residents are deprived of the right to vote. Both spell doom for the Zionist dream.\u201d \\nAn apartheid-like reality already exists for Palestinians, but many Israelis and their supporters publicly rationalize it as an unfortunate but temporary necessity during a transitional period that will end with a peace settlement. By putting off determination of the final status of the occupied territories, Israel can justify subjecting Palestinians to harsh military law , seizing their land, demolishing their homes, controlling their movements, and jailing them at will rather than granting them the rights afforded to Israeli citizens. \\nIsraeli political scientist and former deputy mayor of Jerusalem Meron Benvenisti has been saying for years that \u201cthe whole notion of a Palestinian state . . . is a sham.\u201d Israel has maintained the pretense of peace talks only \u201cbecause it is self-serving,\u201d he said. While talking about two states as a goal, Israeli governments continue funding the expansion of settlements. Palestinian officials, meanwhile, help enforce order in return for millions of dollars in international aid. \\nBut if Israeli hardliners succeed in ending the fiction of a peace process and annex the territories , \u201cthen the Palestinian struggle will inevitably be transformed from one demanding independence into a movement demanding equal rights,\u201d says James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute. \u201cIf this is to be the case, we may well see the day when the Palestinian citizens of Israel will emerge . . . as the new leadership of a unified Palestinian community fighting for justice and equality.\u201d \\nSuch a fight will face tremendous opposition. In recent years, polls of Israeli adults show that nearly half believe Arabs should be expelled from Israel. Nearly eight in 10 believe Jews should receive preferential treatment compared to non-Jews. The Netanyahu government and Knesset are filled with overt racists. Last year, Netanyahu appointed as deputy defense minister a rabbi who asserted , \u201c[Palestinians] are like animals, they aren\u2019t human.\u201d \\nThe Israeli peace activist and public opinion analyst Dahlia Scheindlin doesn\u2019t minimize the hurdles, but said Palestinians may be ready to fight for their rights within Israel. \u201cIsraeli racism [is] better than Israeli occupation,\u201d she wrote , \u201cand they probably feel [they] can live with it as long as there are democratic foundations to demand better. Maybe for them, Israeli rule cannot possibly make their status quo worse, but at least it offers the possibility of something many of them simply lack: citizenship.\u201d \\nDemocratic Rights \\nSome hope is offered by the fact that several notable right-leaning Israeli politicians favor granting Palestinians full democratic rights within a greater Israel, rather than subordinating them forever under the thumb of military occupation or Jim Crow-type segregation.

Kennedy\u2019s famous quote when facing the Berlin Wall, \u201cIch bin ein Berliner.\u201d (Photo credit: Marc Venezia) \\nAs New Yorker editor David Remnick observed a couple of years ago, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin \u2014 a member of the rightist Likud party \u2014 has \u201cemerged as the most prominent critic of racist rhetoric, jingoism, fundamentalism, and sectarian violence, the highest-ranking advocate among Jewish Israelis for the civil rights of the Palestinians both in Israel and in the occupied territories.\u201d \\nRivlin visited an Arab town that had been the scene of an Israeli massacre in 1956 to apologize and \u201cswear, in my name and that of all our descendants, that we will never act against the principle of equal rights, and we will never try and force someone from our land.\u201d He also condemned racist fans of a Jerusalem soccer team who protested its signing of two Muslim players. \\nFor such sentiments, not surprisingly, Rivlin has been called a \u201ctraitor,\u201d \u201crotten filth,\u201d and even \u201clying little Jew\u201d by his Israeli haters. \\nBut Rivlin is not alone. Moshe Arens, a former Likud leader, minister of defense and foreign affairs, and ambassador to the United States, supports giving Palestinians in the West Bank the right to vote in Israeli elections. The key to preserving Israeli democracy, he wrote in 2010, will be making them feel at home in the state of Israel, \u201cenjoying not only equality of rights but also equality of opportunities.\u201d \\nIt will take a minor miracle to persuade the Israeli public to risk broadening their democracy to incorporate millions of Palestinians, but the longer the unsupportable status quo prevails, the less likely it becomes that any Israelis will enjoy the democratic and civil rights they have long known. Israel\u2019s media is under assault from the government , leading Freedom House to downgrade its assessment of the country\u2019s press from \u201cfree\u201d to \u201cpartly free.\u201d Israeli peace activists and NGOs face constant harassment and persecution . Rightist demonstrators routinely chant \u201cDeath to Arabs.\u201d \\nFormer Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon, a member of the Likud Party, recently declared , \u201cThe leadership of Israel in 2016 is busy with inflaming passions and causing fear between Jews and Arabs, between right and left and between different ethnic groups in order to survive in power.\u201d \\nAnd Ilan Baruch, Israel\u2019s former ambassador to South Africa, said , \u201cNetanyahu is pushing Israeli democracy to the brink. . . This is the most right-wing government in the country\u2019s history, which has no qualms about taking tactical and strategic steps in the media, education, and culture in order to ensure Netanyahu\u2019s permanent rule. To do that, the government sows racist divisions . . . slanders and preaches hatred for the Other \u2014 be they Arab citizens of Israel, Palestinians, African refugees, or human rights activists.\u201d \\nStill, with the pretense of a two-state solution shattered by Trump\u2019s victory and Netanyahu\u2019s open intransigence, supporters of Israeli democracy and Palestinian rights can finally begin an unblinkered discussion of how to achieve a genuine accommodation between those two peoples in a common land. \\nIn the words of Sandy Tolan, author of the international bestseller The Lemon Tree , \u201cNow, at least, there is an opportunity to lay the foundations for some newer kind of solution grounded in human rights, freedom of movement, complete cessation of settlement building, and equal access to land, water, and places of worship. It will have to be based on a new reality, which Israel and the United States have had such a hand in creating. Think of it as the one-state solution.\u201d'"}, "time": 1742561644.064499}
