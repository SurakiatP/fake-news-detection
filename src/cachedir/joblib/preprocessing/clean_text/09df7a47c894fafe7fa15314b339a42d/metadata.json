But the Trump name may disappear from this upscale residential building. \\nLaunched in 2012, Trump Tower is a joint venture between Century Properties and the Trump Organization. It will be managed by Century Properties Management Inc. To rise at 250 meters above ground, the 56-story building is designed by award-winning international architectural firm Broadway Malyan. \\n\u201cIt\u2019s really just an iconic, modern building, very tall, very chic, something that really symbolizes everything that a Trump project means,\u201d said Eric Trump, son of Donald, and executive vice president of development and acquisition. \\nIt is located at the corner of Kalayaan Avenue and Salamanca Street in Makati City. \\nBut today, Philippine President Rodrigo Roa Duterte issued an executive order canceling the building permit of the Trump Tower. \\nDuterte called Donald Trump and his organization \u201cpersona non grata\u201d for the Republican presidential candidate\u2019s recent comments about the Philippines. \\nIt will be recalled that in one of his campaign speeches, Trump lumped the Philippines with other countries with terrorism links, calling for the banning Filipinos from immigrating to the United States. Duterte even challenged Trump to a fist fight. \\n\u201cIf we, Filipinos, are not welcome in the United States, why would we welcome Trump in the Philippines,\u201d Duterte said. \\nAsked by The Adobo Chronicles what the Philippine government plans to do with the Trump Tower, Duterte replied, \u201cI will make it a rehabilitation center for the more than half a million Filipino drug users who surrendered as part of my war on drugs.\u201d \\nTouch\u00e9!'"}, "time": 1742561770.172231}
