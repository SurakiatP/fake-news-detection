She discovered that many things were missing: flash drives containing her work and reviews from European literary journals, letters written to her by Kurdish prisoners, and books on Kurdish history. Left behind were the objects of another of her passions: her ballet shoes, torn apart. That is what made her cry. \u201cSomehow the unfairness of it all hit me with the ballet shoes,\u201d she said in a recent interview. \u201cThat was suddenly too much. \u201d Ms. Erdogan, 49, a    who has always been more celebrated in European literary circles than in Turkish ones, is trying to put her life back together after being imprisoned under the latest crackdown on freedom of expression by the Islamist government of Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who is not related to the author). She was arrested and charged with supporting terrorism, not because of her novels but as a result of her affiliation, as an adviser, with a newspaper linked to the Kurdish movement that has since been shut down. She still faces a trial that could land her back in prison, and with that hanging over her, she has been living with her mother, sleeping late, not writing much and dealing with the new fame that her case has brought. Nowadays, on the streets of Istanbul, people recognize her. \u201cIt is moving. Sometimes people put their arms on me and cry,\u201d she said. \u201cI receive lots of love. That is a big responsibility. \u201d There is a downside. \u201cI also receive negative reactions, too: curses and lectures on patriotism,\u201d she said. That can feel harrowing in Turkey, which has a long tradition of not just locking up writers and journalists but of violence against them, wielded by vigilantes who seem to take their cues from officials who brand as traitors those writers who go beyond what the government deems acceptable language. In the 1940s, the leftist writer Sabahattin Ali was believed to have been murdered by a state agent. In 2007, the   journalist Hrant Dink was assassinated by a nationalist gunman who may have been acting on the orders of the   deep state. And, last year, a man outside a courtroom fired a shot at Can Dundar, a newspaper editor accused of publishing state secrets. Once, Ms. Erdogan said, she \u201cwas an outcast in literary circles\u201d in Turkey for her existentialist writings, which appealed more to a European audience. \u201cI have more readers in Sweden than here,\u201d she said. Growing up in a household that valued education  \u2014   her father is an engineer, her mother an economist  \u2014   she attended the prestigious Bosporus University. Trained as a physicist, she began writing seriously on the side in the early 1990s while pursuing graduate studies in Switzerland. There, in a tiny room in Geneva, she wrote all night after full days in the research lab, eventually producing the story collection \u201cThe Miraculous Mandarin. \u201d A few years later, while studying for her doctorate in Brazil, she gave up physics for good. \u201cOne morning I woke up and didn\u2019t go to my exams,\u201d she said. Now, as her fame in Turkey grows, her books have been selling more, and her publisher has issued new printings. One volume of short stories, \u201cThe Stone Building and Other Places,\u201d has become a best seller in Turkey. \u201cThe City in Crimson Cloak\u201d is perhaps her   book, and the only one that has been published in English. It is a recreation of the myth of Orpheus set in the gritty and violent back streets of Rio de Janeiro, where Ms. Erdogan once lived. She describes her writing as \u201csublime language plus crude metaphors\u201d that has had only a limited appeal in Turkey, where readers tend to flock to realistic works steeped in Ottoman history or nostalgia, like the books of Orhan Pamuk, Turkey\u2019s   novelist. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing realistic in my books,\u201d she said. \u201cI am a difficult writer. \u201d The darkness of her writing is a reflection of her personality. She has always lived \u201ca life of extreme loneliness,\u201d she said, and the prevailing theme of her work is the brokenness of human beings, what she refers to as their \u201cwounds. \u201d \u201cAsli Erdogan\u2019s literature is dark, pessimistic,\u201d said Sema Kaygusuz, a Turkish novelist. \u201cThe world in Erdogan\u2019s mind is a wounded body. A body constantly bleeding, a body in anguish. She carries this body both linguistically and psychologically. She identifies with the wound. The pain the author is in is not a personal one in this sense, but it is the pain of the world. \u201d Even in Europe, in the earlier days of Ms. Erdogan\u2019s writing career, her work was a tough sell, defying the expectations the outside world places on Turkish novelists. \u201cSo many publishers told me, \u2018Oh your writing is great, it\u2019s impressive, but, you see, this existentialist stuff, we have done already,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201c\u2018But why don\u2019t you write us about your own little village? \u2019\u201d With her arrest and time in prison, Ms. Erdogan has joined many of her Turkish literary contemporaries, and forebears, in a common experience. Most of the country\u2019s great writers have, at one time or another, run up against Turkey\u2019s restrictions of freedom of expression. The reasons differ in different eras. Ms. Erdogan was arrested for her association with a Kurdish movement that the government now considers a terrorist group. Mr. Pamuk once faced criminal charges for \u201cinsulting Turkishness. \u201d Elif Shafak, another of Turkey\u2019s internationally known novelists, once ran afoul of Turkish authorities for writing about the Armenian genocide, still denied by the Turkish government. \u201cEvery writer, every poet and every journalist in Turkey knows that words can get us into serious trouble any day, any moment,\u201d Ms. Shafak wrote in a recent email. \u201cWhen we write,\u201d she added, \u201cthere is this ominous knowledge at the back of our minds. \u201d At every turn, Ms. Erdogan\u2019s story comes back to books: the books she has already written and the ones she plans to write, the books the police seized from her apartment, the books she read while in prison. To describe the entire experience  \u2014   navigating the Turkish law and prison bureaucracy  \u2014   she leans on a literary reference, saying it has been \u201cmore than Kafkaesque. \u201d In prison, which included several days in solitary confinement sleeping, she said, on a bed that smelled of urine, she passed the time and drew comfort from books brought to her by her lawyers, or mailed to her by friends. She read volumes on world history, and novels by J. M. Coetzee, Iris Murdoch, Henry James, Marcel Proust and Kafka, and the poems of Rainer Maria Rilke and Paul Celan, a favorite of hers. From the prison library, she read \u201cShoah,\u201d the text to the acclaimed 1985 documentary by Claude Lanzman. So far, Ms. Erdogan said she has resisted calls to write a memoir of her time in prison, saying she is not ready. \u201cI know I could write a best seller very easily about my prison days,\u201d she said. She still might, although it will most likely take a long time. Sometimes, she said, it takes her six or seven years to write a hundred pages. \u201cWhen I hear the right voice, and I catch it, it carries me,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I don\u2019t, forget it. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742561995.1123312}
