That deal is grounded in three promises \u2014 safe communities, great education, and high paying jobs.\u201d \\nOf those promises, he said, in part: \\n1. Safe Communities \\n\"Making our communities safe again will be a priority. You walk to the store to buy a loaf of bread maybe with your child and you get shot. We got to stop it. \\n[T]he law will be applied fairly, equally and without prejudice. We will also police our streets\u2014have to keep our streets safe. \\nThe problem is not the presence of police but the absence of police. We need really a great group of people to keep you safe, to keep us all safe.\" \\n2. Education \\n\"School choice is at the center of my plan. And by the way we\u2019re going to terminate common core and bring education local. \\nMy proposal redirects education spending to allow every disadvantaged child to attend the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice.\" \\n3. Jobs \\n\"When we stop off-shoring to low wage countries, we raise wages at home meaning rent and bills become instantly more affordable. \\nI will also propose tax holidays for inner city investments, a new tax incentive to get foreign companies to relocate in blighted American neighborhoods. \\nI will also pursue financial reforms to make it easier for young African Americans to get credit to pursue their dreams in business and create jobs in their communities.\" \\nTrump has repeatedly asked America\\'s blacks \u201cwhat do you have to lose?\u201d On Wednesday, he once again explained why minorities should reject Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. \\n\u201cWe keep electing the same people over and over and over and they keep coming back to the African American community and the Hispanic community and they keep talking about what they\u2019re going to do and they don\u2019t do it and four years later you see them again.\u201d \\nBased on a CBS News poll released last week, Trump has a steep hill to climb with less than two weeks to go \u2014 he received support from just 4 percent of likely black voters.
