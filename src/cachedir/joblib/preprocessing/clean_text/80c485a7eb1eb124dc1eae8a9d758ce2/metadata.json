According to Rannazzisi\u2019s LinkedIn profile, as Chief of Diversion, he had been tasked with \u201coversight and control of all regulatory compliance inspections and civil and criminal investigations of approximately 1.6 million DEA registrants\u201d \u2014 but if the standards are lowered by Congress to allow greater leeway in prescribing opioids, the threshold of criminality is raised. \\nAs the Guardian points out, legislation to fight the opioid epidemic, Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act , did, in fact, pass in July \u2014 but partisan controversy erupted when Republicans failed to provide funding to give the law sharp teeth. Democrats then issued a report titled \u201c Dying Waiting for Treatment \u201d in response, which \u201clikened the Republican response to the opioid crisis to \u2018using a piece of chewing gum to patch a cracked dam.\u2019\u201d \\nIndeed the report sharply criticized the bill, equating its policies to \u2018empty promises\u2019 for the lack of financial follow-through. \\nAs the Washington Post detailed in a report earlier this month, the DEA launched an aggressive campaign to rein in distribution of opioids by pharmaceutical manufacturers to illegal \u2018pill mills\u2019 and corrupt pharmacies, who cared little whether the drugs wound up on the streets. \\nHeaded by Rannazzisi, the Office of Diversion Control sent investigators into the field, and began issuing hefty fines and filing lawsuits against the distributors responsible for the proliferation of opioids on the streets. \\nBut the disproportionately powerful pharmaceutical industry \u2014 fearing a potential significant loss in profits \u2014 fought back. Hard. \\nAccording to the Post , the deputy attorney general summoned Rannazzisi to a meeting in 2012, concerning the cases of two unnamed major drug companies. \\n\u201cThat meeting was to chastise me for going after industry, and that\u2019s all that meeting was about,\u201d the now-retired DEA official told the Post . \\nThen, in 2014, came what constituted a hand out to the pharmaceutical industry by the Department of Justice and congressional legislators: the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act \u2014 legislation initiated by the Healthcare Distribution Management Association \u2014 the industry group representing distributors at the heart of the controversy. \\nAn analysis of lobbying records by the Post found \u201cthe Healthcare Distribution Alliance, spent $13 million lobbying House and Senate members and their staffs on the legislation and other issues between 2014 and 2016.\u201d \\nRannazzisi argued his case to congressional staffers in a phone conference in July 2014, and recalled telling them, \u201cThis bill passes the way it\u2019s written we won\u2019t be able to get immediate suspension orders, we won\u2019t be able to stop the hemorrhaging of these drugs out of these bad pharmacies and these bad corporations.\u201d \\nStunned at the massive \u2014 and ultimately successful \u2014 effort to take the bite out of DEA attempts to hold distributors and drugmakers responsible for their role in an epidemic estimated to take 19,000 lives every year, Rannazzisi likened the legislation to a \u201cfree pass\u201d for legal drug pushers. \\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t ensure patient access and it doesn\u2019t help drug enforcement at all,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cWhat this bill does has nothing to do with the medical process. What this bill does is take away DEA\u2019s ability to go after a pharmacist, a wholesaler, manufacturer or distributor.\u201d \\n\u201cThis was a gift. A gift to the industry,\u201d he added. \\nAfter heading the diversion office for a decade, Rannazzisi retired in 2015 \u2014 likely disgusted over legislators\u2019 dedication to the legal drug industry, rather than the people whose interests they\u2019re ostensibly obligated to protect. \\n\u201cThe bill passed because \u2018Big Pharma\u2019 wanted it to pass,\u201d he told the Guardian in no uncertain terms. \u201cThe DEA is both an enforcement agency and a regulatory agency. When I was in charge what I tried to do was explain to my investigators and my agents that our job was to regulate the industry and they\u2019re not going to like being regulated.\u201d \\nBig Pharma relies overwhelmingly on lobbyists filling the coffers of politicians to ensure they ignore the crisis gripping the nation. As the Center for Public Integrity found , the Guardian noted, Purdue Pharma \u2014 at the heart of the epidemic for its highly-addictive drug introduced in the late 1990s, OxyContin \u2014 spent a breathtaking $740 million in the last ten years on congressional lobbying efforts. \\nHowever, Big Pharma\u2019s power to influence policy and legislation extends far beyond simple but effective lobbying \u2014 the government-run Interagency Pain Research Coordinating Committee (IPRCC) has been accused by Sen. Ron Wyden of being a tool to \u201cweaken\u201d CDC guidelines for limiting overprescribing of opioids. \\nWyden wrote to Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell of his concerns the IPRCC had been staffed with \u2018experts\u2019 with conflicts of interest for their close ties to Big Pharma, including a scientist with a $1.5 million endowment from Purdue, reported the Guardian . \\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a panel that\u2019s certainly got a fair number of people that have a vested interest in this problem of overprescribing. That\u2019s something you\u2019ve got to root out,\u201d Wyden asserted . \u201cThe role of the pharmaceutical companies on these advisory panels troubles me greatly. Science is getting short shrift compared to the political clout of these influential interests.\u201d \\nFamilies of countless addicts and victims of the opioid industry would undoubtedly find the direct influence of Big Pharma\u2019s pro-opioid cash appalling \u2014 yet it continues to this day. Policies and legislation have not yet been given the appropriate funding needed to effectively combat the problem, which swirls out of control while politicians and drugmakers reap blood-tainted profits. \\n\u201cCorporations have no conscience,\u201d Rannazzisi flatly told the Guardian . \u201cUnfortunately, with my job, I was the guy who had to go out and talk to families that lost kids. If one of those CEOs went out there and talked to anybody, or if one of those CEOs happened to lose a kid to this horrible, horrible domestic tragedy we have, I\u2019d bet you they\u2019d change their mind. \\n\u201cWhen you sit with a parent who can\u2019t understand why there\u2019s so many pharmaceuticals out in the illicit marketplace, and why isn\u2019t the government doing anything, well the DEA was doing something. Unfortunately what we\u2019re trying to do is thwarted by people who are writing laws.\u201d Share Google + skyp0ckets \\nYou know, even if a pharma head talked to the family of someone who lost a loved one to opiod addiction, or had a family member suffer that fate, I don\u2019t think it would change them in the least. These people who are hard-wired to accumulate massive amounts of wealth are usually somewhere between sociopathic and psychopathic. This is why it is very difficult for people to trust medicine, and in many cases, the doctors who dispense it. Have you ever been sitting in a waiting room and watched the number of salespeople revolve in and out, many with carry-out food? Disgusting. Bwin51 \\nEver notice how the sales reps are all well dressed attractive women? rav1 TZM_TVP_RBE \\nThe entire system is inherently corrupt. \\nImagine you are the CEO of one of these Big Pharma corporations and you decided to cut the price of your drugs across the board, making them accessible to everyone that needed them. You would be out the door so fast your head would spin! \\nThe board and the shareholders would be furious and demand a CEO that only cares about share prices. \\nAnd so you have it, inherent corruption. \\nThe solution: \\nhttp://www.thevenusproject.com/the-venus-project/ Bwin51 \\nIf there was ever a conspiracy, it\u2019s this one where government and business agree that those who wish to abuse drugs to their eventual demise are given the freedom to destroy themselves, reproduce freely thereby creating a new generation of consumers, generating profits for a few and tax dollars for the country. It\u2019s not the cost of pharmaceuticals as much as the enablement of opioid addiction in the name of profits that is disturbing. Purdue pharma had an opportunity to change their formulation of OxyContin long ago to make their drug nonaddicting, but they chose not to according to Chasing the Scream. If that\u2019s true, and so far no one has denied the assertion, then what do we have here. \\nThis is a \u201cbombshell\u201d? I thought it was common knowledge. rav1 \\nWe\u2019ve known this for some time now \u2013 maybe it\u2019s a bombshell to those who believe and defend the corrupt system \u2013 but\u2026 it\u2019s been known for a long time. \\nhttps://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c1fa9675331c053172286e53581c0496949f8edca27ba323bad684cf6b5fc19d.png \\nAnd think of what lobbyists dole out to Congressmen to force us to BUY AMERICAN rather than CANADIAN for exactly the same BRAND NAME DRUGS! \\nLets See if Clinton can make this the major effort in 2018 when Congressmen need to be reelected at OUR EXPENSE!!! \\nHere\u2019s a US-CANADA comparison of common drug prices US and CANADA. \\nRead the comments too!'"}, "time": 1742564185.643564}
