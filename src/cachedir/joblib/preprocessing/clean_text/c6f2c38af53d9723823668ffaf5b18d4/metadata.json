In so doing, they have revealed their true nature. They are not just upset over losing, they have decided that if they cannot rule no one will. That is the spirit of Antichrist. \\nDemonstrators with signs reading \u201cNot my president!\u201d clogged streets in New York City on Saturday during a fourth day of anti-Trump protests nationwide, a day after a person was shot during a protest in Portland, Oregon.

It was unclear whether the shooting was politically motivated. \\n\u201cPreliminary information indicates that a suspect was in a vehicle on the bridge and there was a confrontation with someone in the protest,\u201d Portland police said in a statement. \u201cThe suspect got out of the vehicle and fired multiple shots injuring the victim.\u201d The victim is expected to survive, police said. \u201cWe are the popular vote\u201d chant protesters. @msnbc pic.twitter.com/AmDyCTIfCz \\n\u2014 Morgan Radford (@MorganRadford) November 12, 2016 \\nNow, in the interest of full disclosure , when the Kenyan-born and Muslim-raised Barack Hussein Obama was elected, I declared he would \u201cnever be my president\u201d. And for the entire time of his presidency I wrote over 1,300 articles exposing him and his Marxist plan for America. Let this website be my witness to that. This is how I exercised my Constitutional right to free speech. But at no time did I ever protest in the streets, ever threaten another human being, and I never used the global platform of NTEB to ever call for physical violence of any kind ever. \\nWhy not? \\nBecause though I despised the anti-American president Obama, I still loved America and the ideals she stood for. I saw myself as a patriot in exile, but still teared up every time I heard the National Anthem or read about a soldier\u2019s heroic sacrifice on a foreign battlefield. These anti-Trump protesters that are clogging city streets at this very moment hate America, hate what this nation stands for, and seek to destroy it and us. They preach \u201clove\u201d while they shoot innocent people in the streets, they demand \u201ctolerance\u201d while offering none. They accuse Trump of having a \u201cdark vision\u201d for America while carrying out despotic deeds of darkness no Trump supporter would ever even dream of.

But if that is how you choose to express yourself, you reveal your true nature and spirit. You who are now rioting in the street by permission of the very country you hold in contempt are depraved in both mind and spirit. You are not \u201cprotesting Donald Trump\u201d, you are seeking to hurt, to maim and to destroy. That\u2019s satanic. You are nothing more than a herpes blister on the beautiful mouth of Lady Liberty . \\nNow please, before someone gets killed , get in an orderly line and move north to Canada like you promised you would. \\nIt\u2019s time to make America great again , and we don\u2019t need you to do it. \\nGeoffrey Grider NTEB is run by end times author and editor-in-chief Geoffrey Grider.
