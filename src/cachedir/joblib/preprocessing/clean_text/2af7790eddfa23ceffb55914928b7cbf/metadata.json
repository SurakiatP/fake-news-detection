Depending on what is found on the 650,000 emails on Weiner and Abedin\u2019s laptop, the infamous couple could take down one of the most powerful women on the planet, Hillary Clinton. Something tells me that there is plenty of scandal to go around, however. It is now being reported that the FBI\u2019s Miami office is investigating the Clinton Foundation for their \u201cwork\u201d in Haiti. . @rpollockDC reports that FBI\u2019s Miami office is conducting Clinton Fnd probe concerning Haiti work. https://t.co/w8iPeQ69nr @dailycaller \\n\u2014 Chuck Ross (@ChuckRossDC) October 31, 2016 \\nIt is no surprise that the FBI is interested in the Clinton\u2019s dealings in Haiti. \\nSince January of 2015, when a group of Haitians surrounded the Clinton Foundation\u2019s offices in New York, carrying signs that said, \u201cClinton, where\u2019s the money?\u201d \\nDhoud Andre, of the Commission Against Dictatorship, has said, \u201cWe are telling the world of the crimes that Bill and Hillary Clinton are responsible for in Haiti.\u201d \\nRecent emails, leaked from the State Department, indicated that contractors seeking to provide earthquake relief to devastated Haitians were heavily vetted by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s team. The criteria? Contractors needed to be \u201cFOB\u2019s,\u201d or \u201cFriends of Bill.\u201d These FOB\u2019s were donors to the Clinton Foundation. Reportedly, if a contract company was not a donor, they were referred elsewhere, while donating contractors were given funds to work in Haiti. \\nAlmost $4 billion was sent to Haiti for relief, and it has been noted by some Haitians that little of this money actually made it to those who need it. \\nHaitians also have noted that Bill Clinton was the designated UN Representative for aid to Haiti while Hillary Clinton was the Secretary of State. \\nThe Clintons were the two most powerful people controlling the funds meant to help Haitians. \\nContracts went to friends of the Clintons, and, reportedly, homes were not built, schools were not built, technology was not installed, and infrastructure was not significantly improved. \\nHaiti did, however, gain a few million dollar hotels. \\nNot exactly what the poor were hoping for. \\nTake a look at this video, entitled \u201cHow the Clinton Foundation Got Rich Off Poor Haitians.\u201d \\nThe details are almost too numerous to list. For more information, visit the National Review. \\nOne thing is certain, if the FBI continues at this pace, the details are forthcoming, and they are not likely to be pretty.'"}, "time": 1742562351.9207716}
