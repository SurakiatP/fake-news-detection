His remark drew sharp rebukes from the two women. \u201cMen believe they are the owners of this space, as if we\u2019re just here by chance,\u201d said Ms. Grazziotin, 55, a prominent leftist senator from Amazonas State. For senators like Ms. Grazziotin, the episode reflected the emboldening of conservative voices after the impeachment of Ms. Rousseff, who argued that she had been the target of misogynistic attacks by opponents. Female politicians across Brazil are debating what her downfall means in a political realm dominated by men. Despite the inroads made by Ms. Rousseff and others, Brazil ranks remarkably low in the representation of women in politics. Of the 513 members of the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of the Brazilian Congress, 51 are women, placing the country 155th in the world in the percentage of women elected to the lower house of a national legislature, according to the   Union. It trails places like Saudi Arabia and Turkmenistan. The administration of Michel Temer, Ms. Rousseff\u2019s successor  \u2014   a former ally who emerged victorious in the power struggle to oust her  \u2014   is doing little to assuage fears that women will be sidelined. Upon taking office more than three months ago, Mr. Temer named an   cabinet in a country where just 48 percent of the population of 206 million is male. Depicting a   suburban idyll in which a   president is greeted by his spouse, a much younger housewife, the cover of this month\u2019s edition of the Brazilian magazine Piau\u00ed captured the cultural shift to the right embodied by Mr. Temer, 75, whose wife, Marcela, a   former beauty pageant contestant, is 42 years younger. Throughout the impeachment proceedings, female allies of Ms. Rousseff\u2019s in Congress argued that the way her impeachment was carried out reflected a political establishment in which women were still supposed to serve as accessories to powerful men. A new wave of vitriolic positioning against female politicians like Ms. Rousseff is fueling these concerns. During the impeachment trial, for instance, Jaufran Siqueira, a socially conservative politician in the northeastern city of Natal, seized on a new idea for gaining votes. \u201cThis is what will happen to feminists when Jaufran is elected,\u201d Mr. Siqueira, 25, proclaimed alongside a photograph he posted on his campaign\u2019s Facebook page, showing a house engulfed in flames. \u201cI can\u2019t deny that I oppose the feminist movement,\u201d said Mr. Siqueira, a real estate broker who emerged into the national spotlight with his campaign. \u201cBut it\u2019s absurd to claim I\u2019m going to set fire to women. \u201d He said the photo had been merely \u201ca joke. \u201d Despite the increasing tensions, female political leaders in Brazil remain far from unanimous on whether Ms. Rousseff was driven from office because of her gender. Marina Silva, the former maid who is a leading contender for the 2018 presidential election, said in an interview that Ms. Rousseff\u2019s ouster was rooted in incompetence and deeply flawed policy making, referring to charges that she manipulated the federal budget to conceal economic problems. \u201cMy understanding is that Dilma\u2019s budget maneuvers were illegal,\u201d said Ms. Silva, 58, an environmentalist, who repeatedly clashed with Ms. Rousseff when both were ministers in the cabinet of President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, of the leftist Workers\u2019 Party. \u201cConservatives are getting more vociferous on a global level  \u2014   just look at Trump in the United States,\u201d said Ms. Silva, referring to Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee for president, who, when asked if he had met Ms. Rousseff, responded: \u201cNo. Who is he?\u201d \u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean that women won\u2019t play a crucial role in Brazilian politics after Dilma\u2019s impeachment,\u201d Ms. Silva said. \u201cOf course we will. We have too much momentum now to stop us. \u201d As campaigning intensifies for municipal elections, other leaders at different points on Brazil\u2019s ideological spectrum echoed such views. \u201cI don\u2019t see this moment as something that disappoints the aspirations of Brazilian women,\u201d said Teresa Surita, a supporter of Ms. Rousseff\u2019s ouster, who is running for   as the mayor of Boa Vista, a city in the Brazilian Amazon. Ms. Surita, 60, who has battled graft charges, said she remained committed to improving life in her city. A member of the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, the centrist party of Mr. Temer, she said that achieving her goals involved maintaining smooth ties with the federal government in the capital, Bras\u00edlia. \u201cI have to be aware of the need for support from the federal government, regardless of who is in power,\u201d she said. While women hold only   of the seats in the lower house of Congress, a more complex picture may be emerging at the local level. For instance, 51 cities have only women running for mayor this year, according to the Superior Electoral Court, and women account for nearly 33 percent of the candidates for City Council seats this year. Women are also gaining positions of prominence in the judiciary. C\u00e1rmen L\u00facia Antunes Rocha, 62, a supporter of affirmative action, gay rights and fewer abortion restrictions, is rising this month to become the chief justice of Brazil. Still, others contend that Ms. Rousseff\u2019s ouster revealed the ugly workings of Brazil\u2019s   political scene. As large protests flare against Mr. Temer\u2019s administration, especially on the streets of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\u2019s largest city, thousands of women are voicing opposition to the new government. \u201cTemer took out Dilma because a man doesn\u2019t like to answer to a woman, and as president, she was the one telling them what to do,\u201d said Rayra Lima de Ara\u00fajo, 14, a high school student who attended the antigovernment protests on Sunday with her mother, Maria da Cruz Lima, 43, an unemployed nurse. Taking the stand during her impeachment trial, Ms. Rousseff argued that her male counterparts did not have to contend with the same attacks on their character. \u201cI\u2019ve always been described as a   woman in the midst of delicate men,\u201d she said. \u201cI never saw a man accused of being   and we know that they are. \u201d But even Ms. Rousseff\u2019s Workers\u2019 Party, once one of Latin America\u2019s most powerful political parties, is grappling with an internal debate over sexism as it tries to reinvent itself. Leaders in the party came under intense scrutiny this year after secret recordings revealed a range of explicitly sexist banter, including crude jokes by Mr. da Silva, the former president, about top female party members. M\u00edriam Leit\u00e3o, an economic historian and one of Brazil\u2019s most influential columnists, said the Workers\u2019 Party was using the debate over women in politics to try to discredit the impeachment process because it cost the party the presidency it had held for more than 13 years. \u201cDilma didn\u2019t fall because she is a woman,\u201d Ms. Leit\u00e3o wrote in her column in the newspaper O Globo. \u201cShe produced a surge in inflation, a recession of historical significance, and lost her job. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742562338.6261532}
