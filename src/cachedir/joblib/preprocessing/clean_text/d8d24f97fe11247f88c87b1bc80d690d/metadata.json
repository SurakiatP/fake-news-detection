[The reasons behind his assessment include the growing use of   and similar rifles for hunting and shooting sports.  Turk wrote, \u201cSince the sunset of the Assault Weapons ban in 2004, the use of     and similar rifles now commonly referred to as \u2018modern sporting rifles\u2019  has increased exponentially in sport shooting. These firearm types are now standard for hunting activities. \u201d Because of his paradigm shift regarding the view and usage of \u201cassault weapons,\u201d Turk suggests the ATF review and update its \u201calmost    study\u201d on such firearms. He then made clear that another reason for lifting importation limitations is the fact that American manufacturers currently make and sell rifles that are identical or similar to many of the firearms that are banned from import. Because of this, \u201crestriction on imports serves questionable public safety interests. \u201d Turk also noted that a characteristic of importation bans in this area has been modifications to   rifles modifications that allow them to survive the import restrictions and enter the U. S. under different classifications. The various classifications mean more unnecessary work for importers and more paperwork for the ATF. He also addressed suppressors, highlighting their broad use in hunting and shooting sports and suggesting it is \u201carchaic\u201d to continue to regulate them via the National Firearms Act. Turk touched on M1 Garands,   1911s, and other U. S.   firearms that are in holding overseas, awaiting clearance to be shipped back to the U. S. and sold to citizens. He wrote: There is no clear public safety reason why     CR defense articles should be denied   to the American public, while many  . S.  origin CR items are approved. Additionally, these items do not represent any discernable public safety concern, as demand lies with collectors of vintage military firearms. Importation and sale through licensed dealers would effectively regulate the lawful transfer of these firearms through a licensee and a background check.
