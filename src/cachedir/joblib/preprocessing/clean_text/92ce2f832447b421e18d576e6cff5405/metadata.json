[The Democratic priorities for Kelly include him ending the enforcement of immigration laws which keep Americans\u2019 wages from disappearing in a flood of cheap labor and cheap drugs, him publicly backstabbing other leaders in President Donald Trump\u2019s cabinet, and him sabotaging Trump\u2019s   promise to build a border wall.   \u201cI would like to think he would be a moderating force   \u2026     He has an understanding of why people want to come to this country, so I would think, hopefully, that would be part of his thinking,\u201d a disappointed Nevada Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto grumbled to Politico. \u201cLook, we\u2019ve had some arguments, the secretary and I,\u201d Democratic Sen. Bob Casey told Politico. \u201cI want to try to do whatever I can to work with him, but I think we probably have some basic differences. \u201d Instead of complying with the Democrats\u2019 priorities, Kelly is building Trump\u2019s border wall, and is complying with Trump\u2019s \u201cHire American\u201d priorities by declining to increase the annual inflow of roughly one million contract workers into the United States. \u201cI know we already have large numbers [of contract workers] that come in and have been coming in over the years, but   \u2026     in the current administration, this is all about American jobs versus people that come in and do the work,\u201d Kelly told Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp at a June 6 hearing.  Kelly and Trump have made a few compromises with Democrats  \u2014   but they have been gotten nothing in exchange except more Democratic hostility and growing worries among their   supporters.  For example, Trump has reversed a campaign promise to shutter the \u2018Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals\u201d   that now allows roughly 765, 000 illegals to work in the United States. \u201cWe are not, not, not targeting DACA registrants right now,\u201d Kelly said June 7 at a hearing called by the House Committee on Homeland Security.  But neither Trump nor Kelly have got anything from the Democrats in exchange for this gift  \u2014   no cash for the border wall, no promise to curb sanctuary cities, no commitment to reduce companies\u2019 use of foreign contract workers, and no curbs on company hiring of illegals. Kelly does show his impatience with grandstanding by the legislators who try to make him do the unpopular things that they dare not do  \u2014   such as importing more contract workers or turning a blind eye to more illegal immigration. One June 7, for example, at a hearing of the House Committee on Homeland Security, he told one legislator who complained about DACA program that: My [response] back to them is \u2018If you feel so strongly about it, you clearly do, why don\u2019t you do something about it? Why don\u2019t you work with your colleagues, both sides of the aisle, because there is a lot of support for this and change the law and I\u2019ll follow the law.\u2019 According to Politico\u2019s account of the Democratic complaints: Today, it\u2019s tough to find anyone on the left willing to defend Kelly. He has alienated potential allies on Capitol Hill, including Democrats who voted to confirm him, and is endangering his reputation as a nonpartisan figure in a presidential administration that has relatively few. \u201cI think Secretary Kelly has drank the \u201d said Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, who was among the Democrats who voted to confirm Kelly in January. \u201cHe\u2019s not the person who I thought I was voting for. \u201d   \u2026     The secretary has said that if Democrats don\u2019t like his enforcement of immigration laws, they should \u201cchange those laws\u201d or \u201cshut up. \u201d That bluntness has further infuriated Democrats, who note they have been trying for years to reform immigration laws but have been stymied by Republicans. Kelly owes his job to the fact that Trump ran against the Democrats\u2019 very unpopular   \u201creform\u201d of immigration laws that would have transferred even more money away from Americans\u2019 pay packets over to Wall Street, according to Congress\u2019 own budget office. He now looks secure in his job, but Senator Menendez is facing a criminal case that may end his tenure in the Senate this winter, long before Kelly packs his retirement bags.  So Kelly does his job amid growing Democratic complaints. \u201cI have my marching orders from the president,\u201d he told the House Committee on Homeland Security on June 7.
