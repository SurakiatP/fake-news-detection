[\u201cLet\u2019s say a subscriber decides to record ABC\u2019s \u2018Blackish\u2019 episode in hopes of being able to catch up on it in a few days, skipping over the ads while they watch. Within 24 hours, though, YouTube likely will have the   version of that show available, since many TV networks offer cable providers at least the last five episodes for catch up on demand,\u201d explained The Wall Street Journal. \u201cIn   versions of shows, TV networks typically disable   over ads to make sure they get credit from marketers who pay for the commercials. \u201d  \u201cIf YouTube TV does have the   version of Wednesday night\u2019s \u2018Blackish\u2019 available, then it won\u2019t let its subscribers watch a recorded version that allows for \u201d they continued. \u201cInstead, viewers will be forced to watch the   episode and all of the ads, even though consumers thought they saved the show on their DVR. \u201d The move has been attributed to YouTube\u2019s various deals with companies such as Disney, 21\u2019st Century Fox, and NBC Universal, though it has also been noted that \u201cif the   version doesn\u2019t exist, the YouTube TV subscriber will be able to watch a recorded version and skip ads. \u201d YouTube TV, which was announced in March, acts as a \u201cskinny bundle\u201d to compete with cable television providers at a much lower price. As reported by Breitbart Tech\u2019s Jack Hadfield last month, \u201cYouTube TV will cost customers only $35 a month, which gets them 6 accounts, 3 of which can be used to stream live TV concurrently, and access to 40 different networks, including \u2018ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC, ESPN, regional sports networks, and dozens of popular cable networks,\u2019 according to a recent entry on the official YouTube blog. \u201d \u201cEach of the accounts will be personalized and utilize   searching algorithms, similar to Netflix\u2019s profile system,\u201d wrote Hadfield. \u201cUsers also gain access to YouTube Red original shows and an unlimited cloud DVR (1 per account) to record live TV. \u201d The service is only initially available in select U. S. cities, including New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and the San Francisco Bay Area. Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.
