{"duration": 0.4628756046295166, "input_args": {"text": "'The Season 7 \u201cReal Housewives of New Jersey\u201d reunion show took place in October in a theater in Westbury, N. Y. An elaborate    thing had been constructed on a stage that would soon seat the five Housewives, complete with a   rug and zebra chairs, everything sparkling, everything  . The set was erected so specifically and thoroughly that it included a kitchen in the back, unusable but complete, that you could see only a fraction of, and a fireplace that the cameras would never pick up. \u201cThat\u2019s not a real fireplace?\u201d I asked a production assistant, who answered, \u201cIt\u2019s not not real. \u201d The five contracted Housewives arrived on Long Island the night before for this   reckoning of the season\u2019s tensions, equal parts State of the State panel discussion and   of every lunchtime confrontation that occurred at my   high school. The Housewives were shuttled in black S. U. V.s under the cover of darkness to a hotel more than two hours from where they live, in order to \u201cthrow off the scent to the press,\u201d a publicist told me, though \u201cscent\u201d is a strange word choice here because anyone with a nose could have    the place from the sheer concentration of applied Shalimar. But there was good reason for the secrecy. Leaks from these reunion shows have been rampant, and after a previous one, Andy Cohen, the   mediator and the franchise creator (or as he says, \u201cthe person who gets credit for creating the franchise\u201d when, really, a lot of other people were involved) realized that the leaks might be coming from the hair and makeup teams, who watch the live feed from a holding room. He told the producers to cut the audio to those dressing rooms. Since then, the integrity of his reunion show  \u2014   if, again, \u201cintegrity\u201d is the right word to describe the absolute ravaging of women by their former, current and future friends, accusing one another of everything from having had more than their admitted amount of plastic surgery to being an actual F. B. I. snitch  \u2014   has been intact. The only leaks would be coming from Cohen, and they\u2019d come when he decided they would come. Cohen prepared himself in a sunny, makeshift dressing room on the first floor, standing shirtless as he tried to choose a tie for the    \u2014   yes, that\u2019s    \u2014   taping. His voice was a hoarse whisper, stubbornly projected through sheer will from deep behind his sternum. He had just come from disseminating his Andyness throughout the country on a speaking tour with his friend Anderson Cooper, in which both men told stories from their personal lives and drank Fresquilas on stage. There were a few    appearances for his coming book tour for \u201cSuperficial: More Adventures From the Andy Cohen Diaries. \u201d He had been talking for hours on his weekly radio shows (plural) as well as negotiating and announcing his new book imprint, Andy Cohen Books. He had been hosting his nightly live talk show on Bravo, \u201cWatch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen. \u201d And of course, he continued to   the \u201cReal Housewives\u201d franchise, watching cuts of each episode for all seven cities, giving notes, hiring, firing, reconsidering and fielding    text messages from the stars of those shows, sometimes replying purely with emoji. I told him that the Housewives, who were waiting for the taping to begin, seemed nervous. \u201cA lot of them view me as kind of their daddy in some weird, sick way, and their boss, and their friend, and their boyfriend, and their enemy  \u2014   and so there\u2019s a lot of different psychological layers happening in a situation like this,\u201d he replied. \u201cSome of them are volatile women. So it\u2019s all real. It\u2019s all real. \u201d Below the street, in their dressing rooms, the Housewives breathed through the tension. They had lived their reality on camera and watched the results. They had heard their Housewife colleagues talk about their behavior in   interviews. And they had built within themselves a caldron of anger, resentment and oh, yeah? s to what they had seen. So as not to dilute their fury, so as not to lose one moment of heat for the cameras, the publicists brought them to me separately through secured hallways, like Hannibal Lecter on his gurney. Teresa Giudice, who wore a satin evening gown and body shimmer (it was 8 a. m.) told me she used to be nervous about confronting certain cast members at these reunions, but now, since serving a prison term for fraud in 2015, which she continually refers to as \u201cthe time I went away,\u201d she\u2019s fine she\u2019s ready for her day in court or whatever this is for her. She used to resent Cohen, because she thought he was hardest on her, but now she takes a more nuanced view. \u201cI think he\u2019s an amazing guy,\u201d she said. \u201cIf he was straight, I definitely would date him. \u201d Jacqueline Laurita, who was Teresa\u2019s best friend but has now replaced Melissa Gorga as Teresa\u2019s sworn enemy for life, admitted that she was expecting a blood bath. \u201cYeah, it feels like you\u2019re walking to the electric chair\u201d is how she put it. She knew she would be held accountable for crimes that included calling Teresa a \u201ccriminal\u201d and accusing Teresa\u2019s allies of being her \u201csoldiers. \u201d Jacqueline knew she just had to endure it. She has stopped trying to game Cohen at these things. \u201cHe greets you with a smile, and he has a way about him, and he makes you feel comfortable talking about things, and he can pull the best and the worst out of you with a smile on his face. \u201d She agreed that the best way to think of Cohen is the way you think of Jesus. You pray to him for blessings  \u2014   to get more airtime, to get a rival off the show  \u2014   but like Jesus himself, he answers prayers only sometimes. In his sunny dressing room up above, I asked Cohen how he\u2019d feel if, like the Housewives, he were about to be confronted by everyone he\u2019d interacted with this year. \u201cI\u2019m not on a reality show about my life\u201d was his answer. It annoys him, this implication that what he\u2019s doing is somehow cruel to the women who have signed up for it. But don\u2019t you feel bad for them? I wanted to know. He shook his head, the way he would every time I didn\u2019t get it. These women, who were once housewives, real housewives, are now businesswomen. Teresa Giudice is a   New York Times   author. Melissa Gorga has a successful clothing store. Jacqueline Laurita now has a platform to talk about her son\u2019s autism and for her husband to sell a   brand called the Little Kernel. \u201cI\u2019m in a business relationship with these women,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know what they\u2019re doing. \u201d He put on his shirt and picked the striped tie. Walking out, he was intercepted by Kathleen French, a senior vice president at Bravo, who said that things had become a little too crazy the night before at the end of the \u201cReal Housewives of Orange County\u201d trip to Ireland. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me any more,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me just see it. \u201d He took his place in the fake living room and sat down. \u201cVery casual,\u201d he said as the women   out in their restrictive formal wear,   a deep mustard and hair spritzed to within an inch of   laws. \u201cThis is their Super Bowl,\u201d he told me when I asked why they were in   tie before 8 a. m. Over the next few hours, as they said things like \u201cOh, really, bitch?\u201d and \u201cI was friends with Teresa when she was chasing a prostitution whore out of a country club\u201d and \u201cDo I look like an ape?\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m turning you off\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re a dumb bitch,\u201d Cohen\u2019s placid cool sometimes gave way to frustration. \u201cStay on your couches!\u201d he beseeched them. \u201cDon\u2019t push Daddy!\u201d He put a finger gun to his head as Teresa accused Jacqueline of selling a story to a tabloid. He won\u2019t like that I began this article with the \u201cHousewives. \u201d Cohen has hosted a nightly talk show now for more than seven years that features scintillating conversation with celebrities and (O. K. yes) clips of Bravo shows, but his guests are legitimate stars, like Meryl Streep and Oprah Winfrey and (O. K. yes) Real Housewives. \u201cWatch What Happens Live\u201d is doing well, with nearly 800, 000 viewers a night. The set just expanded to accommodate twice its   audience. But you can\u2019t talk about Cohen without talking about the     empire that he helped create in 2006  \u2014   a juggernaut of unscripted television, with all but one of the locales (it\u2019s Dallas) averaging two or three million viewers per   episode. \u201cReal Housewives\u201d is watched sincerely, it is watched as camp. It is   it is   it is   it is pored over by at least one very funny podcast (\u201cBitch Sesh\u201d) it is debated by feminists, it is singled out for a particular kind of cultural degradation that has seeped into our national conversation and it is fairly said to have been a factor in our recent elevation of a   host to the highest office of this country, a man who apparently spent Thanksgiving asking his guests,   style, whom he should pick for secretary of state. Cohen was at a Jewish Federation speaking gig in Washington recently when a man raised his hand and asked if he felt responsible for the level of discourse that the American republic had descended to in the last few months. It was two weeks before the election, and the question was fair. Over the 10 million episodes of \u201cReal Housewives\u201d I watched this fall, I heard people say to one another, \u201cI just wanna friggin rip his balls off\u201d and \u201cPut away your penis . .. and maybe someone would treat you like a woman. \u201d I saw a woman flip a table when she was angry, a woman who threw her fake leg when she was angry (more on this later). I saw women demand respect, respect, respect, saying, \u201cYou don\u2019t respect me\u201d and \u201cThat is not respect\u201d and \u201cThat\u2019s disrespectful,\u201d respect in the way that people who conduct themselves respectfully and respectably seldom feel the need to demand out loud. Over in the presidential debates, meanwhile, Hillary Clinton was called a \u201cnasty woman,\u201d and Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter feed seemed as if it had been ghostwritten by Kelly Dodd, the Real Housewife of Orange County responsible for such Twitter pronouncements as: \u201cGot my phone hacked with the fraud Dept. Going to get a private investigator and I\u2019m going to sue  press charges!! Good luck Thunderdome. \u201d But Cohen told that man in Washington this: \u201cFirst of all, the \u2018Housewives\u2019 are entertainment. Second of all, in the \u2018Housewives universe,\u2019 you get punished for behaving badly. There are consequences to it. \u201d The consequences to Donald Trump\u2019s behavior, by contrast, seemed to be more people loving him. Had he seen the polls? I asked. He had made a similar speech to me, and I was skeptical. Trump\u2019s not going to win, I told him. Cohen pursed his lips and raised his eyebrows and tilted his head back and forth in consideration. \u201cYou never know. \u201d I didn\u2019t listen to him. No one did, not even when he conducted two televised and dubiously scientific polls of the people who tuned into \u201cWatch What Happens Live\u201d and turned up numbers based on about 60, 000 votes that said, actually, yes, Trump was going to win. He\u2019s used to that. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of times when I will say something about politics, and people will immediately discount me, and I think it\u2019s the easiest way to discount my show too. It\u2019s just like, Oh, that\u2019s the \u2018Housewives\u2019 guy, who cares?\u201d Cohen explained a few weeks after the reunion. We were at Cafe Cluny in the West Village for lunch in the 3 p. m. hour, which is the approximate time lunch happens for someone who goes to bed at about 2 a. m. each night, often following a   massage. He ordered a salad and then stared down the three pieces of dark chocolate that came with the check. \u201cI think I\u2019m   about it, but on the other hand, if that\u2019s what I am, I\u2019m also good with it because it\u2019s a wonderful thing to be. \u201d His voice didn\u2019t get less hoarse over the months I spent with him. \u201cYou know what I mean?\u201d He opened his mouth to say something else, only to remember that control in an interview resides with the person who can stop talking. \u201cLook, I was a thinking person before the Housewives ever came. \u201d He took a piece of the chocolate. \u201cI\u2019ve been a TV producer for a long time  \u2014   not that that\u2019s Mensa, but I\u2019ve had a career, and I made my own way. So I just think, If I ever say something that someone doesn\u2019t want to hear, it\u2019s a very easy thing to then say, Oh, well, coming from the \u2018Housewives\u2019 guy, oh, really, Mr. \u2018Real Housewives\u2019?\u201d He is lately, at 48, consumed with trying to gauge exactly where he stands in the national esteem. When I first met him, in his downtown office, a few minutes before he went on the air, he asked me why I wanted to do an article on him. \u201cI\u2019m just not that introspective,\u201d he said. I took this to mean he possessed the natural discomfort that a producer might have with someone else telling his story. But soon I realized it was more about positioning: Do we think of him as the \u201cHousewives\u201d guy  \u2014   or as a former Bravo head of development who has a thriving production company? Or a guy with his own channel on Sirius XM Radio that features shows with Sandra Bernhard and Dan Rather? Or the author of three   books, or the host of a nightly talk show, the first one in late night with a working bar, no matter what James Corden says? He is no longer what he started out as on the talk show, the kind of person who could ask the question we wanted answered (like: Jacqueline, why would you sit on that woman\u2019s lap after she threatened to \u201crage on your ass\u201d? ). Now he\u2019s one of the famous people. And so he is these days often trying to figure out a metric by which he can ascertain where he falls in the fame food chain. In \u201cSuperficial,\u201d there\u2019s a diary entry in which he talks about getting a   invitation from his good friend Sarah Jessica Parker to be her date for the Met Gala  \u2014   so that\u2019s data. But he goes to Ralph Lauren to get a tux for the event and the one he likes is being held for Bobby Cannavale, and he spends a little time trying to process that he doesn\u2019t have more pull than Bobby Cannavale. Another tux he likes is being held for Johnny Depp, which is O. K. with him, because of course Johnny Depp. \u201cIt didn\u2019t piss me off,\u201d he insisted when I asked about the incident and his calculations surrounding it. \u201cNo. I was like, oh, O. K. oh, good, here\u2019s a ranking, and now I know where I stand. They\u2019re telling me where I stand. I\u2019m finding out how this works. \u201d He paused for a second. \u201cI\u2019m just psyched that I\u2019m getting a tux. \u201d O. K. maybe it did sting a little when Vanity Fair had an article devoted to the hosts of late night, and Cohen seemed to be the only one excluded from it. Trevor Noah hadn\u2019t even made his debut yet! But again, this is just data. \u201cEverything\u2019s good,\u201d he insisted. \u201cI have my health. I have my show. I have my life. You know what I mean?\u201d But also, \u201cI think my show is a late show, you know?\u201d Don\u2019t read any of this as defeated or bitter. If there\u2019s one thing about Cohen, it\u2019s that his respect for the democratic rhythms of popular culture and popularity in general is total. He wants to watch the rise and fall of things, even himself, without trying to manipulate the process. He wants it all to play out. The people will decide, and watching what the people decide and how they decide is far more important than the decision itself. From a young age, there was something about Andy Cohen that his mother couldn\u2019t quite put her finger on. They would watch \u201cAll My Children\u201d together during the    era ( ) which she wondered if maybe other sons weren\u2019t doing with their mothers. He had a Diana Ross poster on his wall. What was it, though? What was it? Then one day, she was watching him \u201cprance\u201d (her word) across the stage in his high school\u2019s performance of \u201cCarousel,\u201d and a notion crept in and took hold. She got home that night and looked under his bed, where she found a healthy stash of gay porn. Now she was sure something was going on, but what? She spoke with a psychologist she knew who understood gay issues because he had a gay relative, and that psychologist told her that maybe she should stop looking under his bed. Andy was about to leave for college, for Boston University, and the psychologist said, \u201cB. U. is a good place for him to go for that, he\u2019ll meet a lot of other gay people,\u201d and now his mother really began to suspect something was up. A few years later, Cohen wrote a   letter to a friend that he left on his parents\u2019 kitchen table, and his mother read it and sat him down and asked him if he was sure. And he told her he was. A mother always knows. He knew he wanted to be onscreen even in high school, but he didn\u2019t want to play characters. He wanted to be famous for being himself, but at the time, that idea didn\u2019t truly exist yet outside the news and shows like Oprah and \u201cDonahue. \u201d \u201cI liked the idea of being myself in front of the camera. So, just me being me. I used to think if I could work on a morning show then I could be me. \u201d He got a job as an intern at CBS News, then as a producer there, but he started to burn out after 10 years. After a   run at the   Barry Diller cable network Trio, he landed at Bravo, where he helped develop breakout successes like \u201cTop Chef\u201d and \u201cThe Millionaire Matchmaker. \u201d Lauren Zalaznick, at the time president of Bravo, recalls someone coming in with hundreds of hours of documentary tape from a gated community in Orange County, Calif. which the producers needed to work. In that footage, Cohen saw something. \u201cI don\u2019t want to pretend like it was like lightning in a bottle at the beginning,\u201d he said. \u201cI was like: \u2018This is a soap opera. This is a soap opera. \u2019\u2019u2009\u201d It was also something else. \u201cThis is real life. \u201d\u2019 Right before the first season aired in 2006, he had a minor crisis over the opening credits. The \u201cHousewives\u201d shows usually begin with an introduction of each Housewife, posing in Grade A evening wear and announcing her tagline, which is part defensive apologia, part mission statement, part brand definition. But at the beginning, when they were editing the first season of Orange County, they went with sound bites from the show, like \u201cI don\u2019t wanna get old\u201d and \u201c  percent of the women around here have had breast implants\u201d and \u201cAre the police involved?\u201d When Cohen saw the first cut, he ran to the office of Shari Levine, Bravo\u2019s vice president of production, and told her she had to call the production company. The Housewives were going to think the producers were sabotaging them. But Levine told him the Housewives had already seen it  \u2014   and they loved it. Cohen learned that day that people stand behind their behavior, and that trying to protect them from themselves is a fundamental act of disrespect: \u201cThese women, but maybe all women. I mean maybe all men, too I think all people want to be heard and understood. \u201d He learned too that people don\u2019t need you to fight their battles, that they are entitled to them, even if you think they\u2019re ridiculous. He learned that an audience will respond to however eccentric or stubborn or mean or dumb or kind a person is if that person is being authentic. \u201cThe things that you think might embarrass them they actually feel like, Well, I was standing up for myself,\u201d he said. I eventually watched the episode of \u201cReal Housewives of Orange County\u201d that Kathleen French had warned Cohen about. It was part of a   arc in which the women go to Ireland so that one of them, Meghan, can track down her ancestors. (This is manifested as her actually tapping people on the shoulder in the street and asking if they are related to her.) Now, \u201cOrange County,\u201d which is the screechiest \u201cHousewives\u201d franchise, had experienced so far a year of immense healing, with the Housewives working on forgiveness. That went right out the window on this trip. Kelly, whom I mentioned earlier, is someone prone to saying things like: \u201cWhat comes before Part B?  !\u201d She also does the old    \u201cWhat\u2019s on your shirt?\u201d and when you look down, she flicks you in the nose. Well, it was one such flick, which she administered to Vicki, that plunged the whole trip into darkness. Kelly wanted to know why Heather was so uptight about it, since Jews are supposed to have a good sense of humor. Heather called Kelly racist, and Kelly, of course, said: \u201cI\u2019m not being racist. I\u2019m Mexican. \u201d Eventually, Tamra got involved, and Kelly said, \u201cNo wonder why her daughter isn\u2019t talking to her,\u201d which prompted Tamra to lunge for Kelly and curse and hit her, and they were all kicked out of the department store they were in. Something Cohen knows, a belief that began to take root in him back when he was watching \u201cAll My Children\u201d with his mother, was that people who interacted would always create something interesting. That\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t understand why anyone would think that \u201cReal Housewives\u201d wasn\u2019t real in some way. Or that it was too crass. Had people been on a subway recently? Had they read an online comments section? If anyone was under the impression that we were still in a Jane Austen novel in terms of national discourse and manners, it wasn\u2019t Cohen\u2019s fault that they were in for a rude awakening. It\u2019s all real. It wouldn\u2019t be compelling to watch if it weren\u2019t. Teresa Giudice was having a real breakdown when she flipped that table in New Jersey. But in New York, when Aviva Drescher got angry and threw her prosthetic leg at Le Cirque, of all places, in a   effort to make her onscreen presence more interesting, well, that was the last we saw of Aviva. \u201cIt is very real to them,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd by the way, when it\u2019s not, they\u2019re off the show. \u201d A few months after the women from Orange County returned from Ireland and watched the episodes through holes between their fingers, they pulled themselves together for the reunion. They put on clothing appropriate for Christmas dinner at the White House if it were Cinderella\u2019s   gathered on two separate couches with Andy in the middle, folded their hands in their laps and apologized to one another. A few days after the election, Cohen began book promotion for \u201cSuperficial. \u201d He started with a few local appearances, including one at the 92nd Street Y, where he was interviewed onstage by Sarah Jessica Parker. He had spent election night at her house, actually, and as soon as it became clear who the winner was, Cohen left the room to eat. A few days later, his optimism had mostly returned. Anderson Cooper told me when we met in St. Louis, \u201cI think Oprah said to Andy, \u2018You carry the light.\u2019 When I heard that, I was like, That\u2019s really true. \u201d Onstage at the Y, he had already come around enough to say that he thinks that at heart, Donald Trump is a Democrat. The liberal, largely Jewish crowd, who had been reading about the terrifying increase of hate crimes since the election and had begun to feel as if the world were closing in faster than they\u2019d expected, responded with silence. We met at Cafe Cluny again a week later, and I asked him if he had noticed the silence. He said he didn\u2019t get it. He wanted to know why everyone he knew was so surprised about all of this. I\u2019d been watching the show, hadn\u2019t I? I\u2019d seen Tamra from \u201cOrange County\u201d call Alexis \u201cJesus Jugs,\u201d hadn\u2019t I? How was that different from calling Hillary Clinton \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d? I\u2019d watched in the primaries as Trump defended the size of his penis, right? \u201cWouldn\u2019t that be the province of the Housewives if they were men?\u201d He was right. Trump was not not like one of Cohen\u2019s Housewives. He knew he had to be entertaining to stay on the show. He was willing to say anything to get his contract extended. Throughout his campaign, he pulled out the \u201cI know something, but I\u2019m not going to say it now\u201d trick, most recently employed by Bethenny Frankel about dirt she has but won\u2019t reveal about both Dorinda and Jules at the last \u201cNew York\u201d reunion. At the debates, the candidates fought for time to speak and demanded that they be allowed the time they were promised, which is what happens at the reunions. When Cohen saw that, he told me, he thought, Lester Holt, I feel your pain. Anderson Cooper was a moderator of a debate in St. Louis that ended with the candidates saying something nice about each other, which is exactly how Cohen ends some \u201cReal Housewives\u201d reunions. It was one thing when people were copying his format for a talk show and pretending it was theirs, but now life is copying his format, and he\u2019s still not quite getting credit for it  \u2014   just blame. But isn\u2019t that always the way for Cohen? He\u2019s confronted from the audience, he\u2019s confronted by that guy in Washington, and still he\u2019s not getting the credit for what his gift actually is, which isn\u2019t knowing how to deviously propel national discourse into the gutter but instead delivering to viewers what they want before they know they want it. And still, they mess up the name of his show, calling it \u201cWatch What Happens Now. \u201d They accuse him of ruining America, when he carries the light. Even Oprah said it. Andy Cohen didn\u2019t invent our society. To think that is to have missed the entire point of him. He simply predicted it. He saw it coming before we did, and he taped it. He has a lack of judgment about the way the world works, and therefore doesn\u2019t have the willful ignorance that the rest of us do  \u2014   yes, we\u2019d seen Tamra call Alexis \u201cJesus Jugs,\u201d and we insisted it was a tacky anomaly. But it wasn\u2019t. It was the way the world works now. Andy Cohen isn\u2019t how our culture got this way. He is simply a walking seismograph of it. Back at Cafe Cluny, I took one of the pieces of chocolate that came with the check he left the other two alone. I asked him what was going to happen next. He shrugged and opened his mouth to say something, pausing for what felt like a minute. Then he told me that it was all going to be O. K. and I decided to believe him.'"}, "time": 1742562268.9182107}
