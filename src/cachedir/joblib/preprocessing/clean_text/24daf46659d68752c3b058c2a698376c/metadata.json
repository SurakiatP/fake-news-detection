It\u2019s hard to know if these \u201cquakes\u201d are intentional or naturally occurring any more. One report says six quakes. Is Rothschild hiding in Grindelwald? Figures. Prime location.\\nSimon says\u2026 (pardon the pun)\\nThis afternoon 5 small earthquakes hit Switzerland south of Bern.\\nOne quake was 4.2 on the Richter scale. This is extremely rare for Switzerland.\\nThis earthquake was also reasonably close to Cern.\\nBut also very close to where Jacob Rothchild is holed up.\\nhttp://www.simonparkes.org/swiss-earthquakes \\nhttp://earthquaketrack.com/ch-be-grindelwald/recent \\nhttps://watchers.news/2016/10/25/earthquake-switzerland-october-2016/ \\n\\nThe Earthquakes in Italy\u2026\\n2 powerful earthquakes rattle central Italy 2 hours apart Buildings have collapsed and the power is out in Castelsantangelo sul Nera.\\nhttp://www.earthquakepredict.com/2016/10/2-powerful-earthquakes-rattle-central.html \\nThings are definitely shakin\u2019 these days. \\nAnd something else of note today from my personal perspective\u2026 for the first time, I actually heard one of those \u201cemergency broadcasting system alert\u201d tests on the radio. It was 12:29 p.m. Pacific Daylight time. \\nI had just entered a store and a couple of minutes later heard that tell-tale electronic tone, and just to be sure I was hearing what I thought I heard, I went closer to the speaker in the ceiling. \\nIt was your typical test, saying if there had been an actual emergency, a instructions would have followed\u2026 and the regular radio programming resumed. I had to laugh because I think I was the only one in the store who heard it. Everyone else seemed oblivious. If the intention is to incite fear\u2026 it failed. We passed the zombie test.
