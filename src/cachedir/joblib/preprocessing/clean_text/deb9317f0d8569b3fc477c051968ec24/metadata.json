She told the police that the men had called her a terrorist and that when she tried to move to the other end of the subway car, one of them followed and tried to pull off her traditional head scarf. DNAinfo reported that she recanted the story on Tuesday and had made it up to get attention because of problems she was having with her family. It was not immediately clear if she had a lawyer.
