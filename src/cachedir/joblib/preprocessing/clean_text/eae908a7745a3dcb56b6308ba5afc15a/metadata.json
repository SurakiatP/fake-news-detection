Yes, to kick off its 42nd season, \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d the NBC sketch comedy institution, opened with a parody of the first presidential debate, pitting Kate McKinnon as Hillary Clinton against Alec Baldwin as Donald J. Trump, and Michael Che as the baffled, deadpan moderator, Lester Holt. This eagerly awaited sketch, which opened the show on Saturday (and which NBC had been promoting during the week as if it were a championship prize fight) mixed some of the   zingers and gaffes from Monday\u2019s debate with the show\u2019s own satirical takes on the political showdown. Ms. McKinnon played Mrs. Clinton as a politician still struggling to make personal connections, warning that Mr. Trump\u2019s policies would harm \u201claborers like my own human father, who made, I guess, drapes, or printed drapes or sold drapes, something with drapes  \u2014   he was relatable and I am also relatable. \u201d Meanwhile, Mr. Baldwin gave a preening,   impersonation of Mr. Trump, who in one volatile tirade said of Mrs. Clinton: \u201cShe\u2019s the one with the bad temperament. She\u2019s always screaming. She\u2019s constantly lying. Her hair is crazy. Her face is completely orange, except around the eyes where it\u2019s white. \u201d The lampooning of the presidential debate has become a quadrennial tradition at \u201cS. N. L. \u201d It\u2019s an institution that has yielded such enduring moments as when, in 1988, Jon Lovitz (in the guise of Michael Dukakis) contemplated Dana Carvey (as the elder George Bush) and groused, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m losing to this guy\u201d in 1992, when Mr. Carvey simultaneously played Mr. Bush and his challenger Ross Perot (the latter performance had been recorded ahead of time) and in 2000, when Will Ferrell (as George W. Bush) summarized the best argument for his candidacy in a single word, \u201cstrategery. \u201d This year, anticipation for the debate parody seemed to run especially high, following the   on Monday between Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton at Hofstra University, which drew an estimated 84 million viewers, according to Nielsen. \u201cS. N. L. \u201d is riding the momentum of Ms. McKinnon\u2019s recent Emmy Award victory for her work on the show, and, for an added boost of adrenaline, brought in Mr. Baldwin, a frequent guest host, to play Mr. Trump this season. (Recently, the role had been played by Darrell Hammond, a veteran \u201cS. N. L. \u201d cast member who is now its announcer, and Taran Killam, who left the show before the start of this season.) \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d is also facing the question of whether it can have any satirical bite on Mr. Trump, who was a controversial choice to host the program in November 2015. NBC, the longtime home of Mr. Trump\u2019s reality shows \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d and \u201cCelebrity Apprentice,\u201d said it was ending its business ties with him in June 2015, citing the \u201cderogatory statements\u201d in his announcement as a presidential candidate, in which he described Mexican immigrants as \u201crapists\u201d and \u201cmurderers. \u201d Nonetheless, Mr. Trump has continued to appear on NBC entertainment programs including \u201cS. N. L. \u201d and \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,\u201d whose host was roundly criticized for conducting a chummy interview with Mr. Trump in September. In Saturday\u2019s season premiere, \u201cS. N. L. \u201d seemed to play it down the middle, balancing each joke about Mr. Trump with a zinger about Mrs. Clinton. As the   Colin Jost remarked at the start of the \u201cWeekend Update\u201d segment, \u201cThe first presidential debate is over, and it\u2019s official: We have to choose between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. \u201d Mr. Che, on \u201cWeekend Update,\u201d joked that watching the debate was like \u201cwatching a divorced couple fight for custody of a kid that hates them both. \u201d He also compared the debate to the divorce of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, \u201cbut if Brad Pitt only wanted to keep the white kids. \u201d Other   sketches included a political edition of the game show \u201cFamily Feud,\u201d in which members of the Trump family (and Vladimir V. Putin) competed against Mrs. Clinton\u2019s allies, including Bernie Sanders (played by the frequent \u201cS. N. L. \u201d guest star Larry David).'"}, "time": 1742562165.6644573}
