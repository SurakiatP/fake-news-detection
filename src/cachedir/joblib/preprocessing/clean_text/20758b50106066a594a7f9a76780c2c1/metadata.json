The ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit overturned a decision by a district court to dismiss the trademark case against Pirate Joe\u2019s and its owner, Michael Hallatt. The district court had said that the violations occurred in Canada, where Trader Joe\u2019s has no stores, and that the company failed to prove that Pirate Joe\u2019s affected business in the United States. In its ruling, the appeals courts said the lawsuit could proceed because Mr. Hallatt\u2019s actions  \u2014   setting up a facsimile storefront in Vancouver, British Columbia, with knockoff branding and online merchandising  \u2014   could devalue the   trademark. The case will return to a federal district court in Washington State. \u201cWe\u2019re here to see it through, and that means doing this for the people who want this stuff,\u201d Nathan Alexander, Mr. Hallatt\u2019s lawyer, told The Associated Press. The decision reopens a case that began in October 2011 when workers at a Trader Joe\u2019s in Bellingham, Wash. noticed Mr. Hallatt buying products in excess. He often returned several times every week. Mr. Hallatt acknowledged he was buying the products to distribute them in Canada through his store, then called Transilvania Trading, according to court documents. He later changed the name to Pirate Joe\u2019s. Sometimes donning disguises to avoid detection, Mr. Hallatt conducted shopping runs and occasionally hired other people to buy goods on his behalf. An advertisement Mr. Hallat placed on Craigslist called for a \u201c  for undercover work\u201d with a \u201c  international grocery smuggling operation. \u201d Court documents said Mr. Hallatt, who holds dual citizenship, had spent more than $350, 000 on goods from Trader Joe\u2019s, which he resold in Canada at a markup. In 2013, the company filed a lawsuit in Washington against Mr. Hallatt for trademark infringement, unfair competition, false designation of origin and false advertising. It added that Pirate Joe\u2019s was not an approved reseller. Responding to the lawsuit, Mr. Hallat said he never claimed an affiliation with the American company.'"}, "time": 1742562060.9606693}
