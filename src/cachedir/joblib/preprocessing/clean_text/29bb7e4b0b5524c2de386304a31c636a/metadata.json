Ms. Woodard said that when her younger child (her son, Duncan) went to college in 2012, her depression caught her in a bind. \u201cSuddenly the thing that made my life vibrant and not like a showbizzy person\u2019s life was gone,\u201d said Ms. Woodard, who can be seen in Netflix\u2019s coming series \u201cMarvel\u2019s Luke Cage. \u201d \u201cI was leaking. I not only lost Duncan\u2019s presence, but I lost having a lot of big, smelly kids  \u2014   his friends  \u2014   in the house all the time. They used to play lacrosse in my driveway. I used to cook for them. \u201d Lest she make her son uncomfortable, Ms. Woodard tried to obscure her sadness. \u201cI would hide in the bathroom and weep into a wet face towel,\u201d she said. But then she worried that maybe she had overcorrected course and seemed unfeeling. \u201cSo I told him, \u2018Let\u2019s cry together for a couple of minutes so that you know I\u2019m gonna miss you.\u2019 He said sure. So we stood there for a couple of minutes and then finally he said, \u2018O. K. Mom. I\u2019ll be upstairs. \u2019\u201d Parents have been crying into face towels for centuries. But   syndrome has gained especial piquancy in a world in which parents and their   offspring are in the habit of texting one another a few times a day, and in which accounts of shootings on campuses are repeated on social media with a frequency bordering on the abject. The pot may be further sweetened by a recent Pew Research Center study\u2019s determination that, for the first time on record, the most common arrangement for people aged 18 to 34 is living with parents. So now those parents whose children do move out are alone in their aloneness. For many empty nesters, landing on the proper spot of the Umbilical   Arctic Gale continuum can be tricky. \u201cYou have got to leave your kids alone,\u201d Ms. Woodard said. \u201cThe only time you text is if you have something really slammin\u2019 to say. Something you know they\u2019re really into. Like, Duncan is a big golfer, so I\u2019ll text, \u2018Oh, no, Rory didn\u2019t!\u2019 That\u2019s all I\u2019ll say. What you don\u2019t want to write is \u2018Your room is so warm!\u2019 Or \u2018Have you eaten?\u2019 Or \u2018Do you have any friends?\u2019 \u2018Are you drunk? \u2019\u201d Some parents and students are tempted to use Facebook and Instagram as the world\u2019s cheapest baby cam, though \u201csome students say that no way do they want their parents on social media,\u201d said Karen Coburn, the senior consultant in residence at the office of the vice chancellor for students at Washington University in St. Louis. \u201cOthers say they like it because it means they don\u2019t have to communicate with their folks as much because the parents get an idea of what the kids are up to,\u201d Ms. Coburn said. \u201cBut one of the worst things a parent can do is to \u2018friend\u2019 one of their kid\u2019s friends. One of my students told me, \u2018Another student came up to me and said, \u2018This old woman friended me on Facebook, I think it might be your mom or grandmother.\u2019 The \u2018old woman\u2019 was probably 45. \u201d Indeed, fences are usually built for a reason. Robert Lindquist, a freshman at the University of Connecticut who is majoring in digital media and design, has imposed a    rule on visits from his family. \u201cIt started out as a joke,\u201d Mr. Lindquist said. \u201cI\u2019m going to school only an hour and a half away from my parents. It\u2019s not quite as inconvenient as I\u2019d intended. \u201d Mr. Lindquist said: \u201cThe rule applies to any family member. We have a term, \u2018the Lindquist Confusion Factor,\u2019 because I have nine aunts and uncles. They\u2019re excellent people, but that many of them can be a little much if you\u2019re not prepared. \u201d Asked how his parents reacted to the demand, Mr. Lindquist said, \u201cI don\u2019t recall them being overjoyed. \u201d Some people view the concept of   syndrome itself as suspect. Shayla Rivera, a comedian, says in her   act that she had to look up the term on the internet: \u201cWhite women get sad when the children leave the house. What?\u201d Asked about the routine, Ms. Rivera, who has a    son and a    daughter, emailed from Kosovo, where she was performing for American troops, \u201cAs I was born and raised in Puerto Rico, some of the North American vicissitudes were not part of my paradigm. They say that women actually go into their kids\u2019 room and smell their clothing! Are you kidding me? I spent 18 years shutting my son\u2019s door so the smell of dirty socks and other mysterious aromas wouldn\u2019t come into the house. When he left I had to go in there with sage, holy water and a priest. \u201d All joking aside, Ms. Woodard said that   parents may feel a child\u2019s absence even more acutely. \u201cTheir house or apartment is smaller, so the kid\u2019s presence is missed more,\u201d she said. \u201cAlso,   parents probably raised that kid on their own. \u201d Regardless of the factors when a household is decanted of its young people, it\u2019s clear that kids who leave their home need a lot of room to grow in, and that parents need to hone their listening skills. Once, when Ms. Coburn asked a Washington University student to give advice to a group of the school\u2019s parents, the young woman offered: \u201cSometimes we want your advice and sometimes we don\u2019t. The challenge is, we won\u2019t tell you which time is which. \u201d Nina Keneally, a mother of two who lives in the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn, runs a service called Need a Mom, in which she can be hired as a combination mentor and life coach. \u201cMost of them don\u2019t complain about their parents being in touch too much,\u201d Ms. Keneally said of her clients in their 20s. \u201cBut a lot of them talk to me about stuff that they wouldn\u2019t talk to their parents about: relationship problems, or things they\u2019re contemplating doing or not doing. Parents would jump in too quickly, or would be embarrassed about what the kid is proposing. \u201d Indeed, the greatest lesson for many empty nesters may be learning to be their child\u2019s coach or inspiration rather than a child\u2019s concierge or critic. In 2014, when students at Keene State College in New Hampshire injected a local event called the Pumpkin Festival with   and   the president of the college chastised her students for failing to \u201cpumpkin responsibly. \u201d It seems only natural that a parent, on hauling the last box of his child\u2019s shinguards and Harry Potter effluvia into the unsupervised blankness of a dorm room, may fear the advent of pumpkin irresponsibility. In the end, empathy and patience are an empty nester\u2019s Xanax. I asked Ms. Woodard what she would say to her parents today about keeping in touch if she were a young person going off to college. Ms. Woodard didn\u2019t miss a beat: \u201cI would say, \u2018I\u2019ll hit you up. \u2019\u201d'"}, "time": 1742628311.8761923}
