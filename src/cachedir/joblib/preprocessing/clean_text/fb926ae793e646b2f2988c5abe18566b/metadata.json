Maybe groped is the more physically accurate word, but given the nature of the violation and the feelings of anger and helplessness it kicked off, I can\u2019t help considering it an assault. It happened a little after 7 p. m. on a brutally humid evening, but a promising one. I was walking home from an art opening in my favorite   dress, enjoying the deep summer scent of the gardens, thinking about going to a bar in Brooklyn that promised rowdy opera  \u2014   horned helmets optional, the website says. Really, is there anything you can\u2019t find in New York on a summer night? I see three teenage boys, maybe ages 13 or 14, walking in my direction. Suddenly I feel a hand shoot up my skirt and a kid grabs the outside of my thigh. There\u2019s laughter. Then the kids run off. You know the lightning responses you see in action movies when an attack takes place? I don\u2019t have those. I stand frozen for what seems like a long time as my brain processes what has just happened.  Huh? Was that a hand on my thigh? That hand was under my dress. I turn around to see where the creep has gone and see him and his two buddies half a block away. They aren\u2019t running, they\u2019re looking over the rail, scoping out the crowd. I see no police officers. Obviously I\u2019m going to have to take justice in my own hands. \u201cCREEP!\u201d I yell. The kids sneer. Then I remember what the modern victim is supposed to do: Get a photo. I open the flap of my   bag unzip the phone pouch try to unlock my phone with a sweaty fingerprint  \u2014   and fail, because wet hands mess up the ID punch in my security code swipe through the icons for the camera find it and aim. By which time the kids have, of course, disappeared. You know those assault horror stories that have exploded this summer? Women groped on subways perverts exposing themselves black drivers pulled over and terrorized by the police officers murdered by snipers. What has amazed me about these crimes is the ability of many victims or   to quickly grab their phones and get a photo. Or   the attackers on Facebook. America is a country of   artists, with apps instead of guns. But not me. I am, I realize, one of those helpless townspeople who after years of being terrorized by a gang of sneering bandits, would have to hire a gunman. Clint Eastwood, say, in a remake of \u201cHigh Plains Drifter\u201d  \u2014   call it \u201cHigh Line Drifter. \u201d Clint  \u2014   I am talking the young, chiseled Clint, not the Clint who talks to chairs  \u2014   would have known what to do with that groper. He would have gotten a photo and posted it on Twitter instantly. Then he would have sprinted after the creep and dangled him by his heels over the High Line rail, two stories over 10th Avenue  \u2014   dangled him with one hand,   him on Periscope with the other. Clint would not be oblivious to how I look in my favorite summer dress either. \u201cYou know a good place for fried chicken?\u201d Clint would ask me, as the kid begged for mercy. \u201cI like fried chicken. \u201d Then Clint would drop the creep on 10th Avenue and there would be a public outcry and his   license would be suspended and I would still not have a boyfriend. Where was I? Oh, yeah, my inability to handle a locked and loaded cellphone. Obviously I needed to brush up on my technological skill set, which means rounding up a young person. The ones I rely on are my nieces, Caity and Freyja. They tell me which printer to get and why I should not be on Tinder. (S. T. D. s, and people don\u2019t actually use it to find someone to have dinner with in a strange town.) I consult with Caity. She is horrified when she hears about the High Line incident and immediately gives me some   basics. \u201cWhen you grab your phone, it\u2019s probably going to be locked, but there\u2019s a camera icon on the lower right,\u201d she says. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to unlock it to use the camera. Just swipe up and you\u2019re ready to go. \u201d I had never noticed a pale gray camera icon on my phone it\u2019s lost in a pale gray corner of my home screen, but when I put on my reading glasses I see it. And since sometimes there is a different screen and the camera icon does not appear, Caity shows me a bar at the bottom of the phone I can swipe upward. That brings up several icons, including the camera still in the lower right.   on Facebook takes longer on my phone. When Caity opens the app, a \u201cGo Live\u201d button appears on the   corner of the screen. Although I have the same phone, I have no such tab. I have to take an extra step going first to my page, then opening the \u201cWhat\u2019s On Your Mind\u201d tab to find the \u201cGo Live\u201d button. I see on the web that other people are having this problem. Further research is required. But I have the basics. You know the way people practice their aim in the Westerns, shooting bottles off the fence? That\u2019s me, metaphorically, with my phone. I\u2019ve moved it to a more accessible pocket of my bag, and walking through Union Square, I sometimes practice my draw. Bam! Bam! Gotcha, Gandhi statue! I may not be as fast as a    but I can confidently say there\u2019s a new sheriff in town. And if I see another creep in action, this time I will get him.'"}, "time": 1742564317.1020539}
