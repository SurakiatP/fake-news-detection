Comey sent a vague letter to congress which he KNEW would start a shit-storm in the media, and now the race is closer than ever. And here Trump complains about a \u201crigged\u201d election! \\nUnfortunately, while attempting to sway voters, Comey didn\u2019t consider that there was someone else at the center of this \u2014 Anthony Weiner\u2019s victim, who is only 16 years old. \\nShe was understandably upset and had a few words to say to the FBI director. You can read the entire letter on BuzzFeed , but here are a few excerpts: \\nI am the 15-year-old (now 16) who was the victim of Anthony Weiner. I now add you to the list of people who have victimized me. I told my story originally to protect other young girls that might be a victim of online predators. \\nYour letter to Congress has now brought this whole matter back into the media spotlight. Not even 10 minutes after being forensically interviewed with the FBI for seven hours, I received a phone call from a REPORTER asking for a statement. Why didn\u2019t you communicate with the local FBI agents that I had just spoken to? They could have scheduled our interview sooner or scheduled a time to interview me later, or change locations of the interview. My neighborhood has been canvassed by reporters asking for details about me. \\n\u2026 \\nI thought your job as FBI Director was to protect me. I thought if I cooperated with your investigation, my identity as a minor would be kept secret. That is no longer the case. My family and I are barraged by reporters\u2019 phone calls and emails. I have been even been blamed in a newspaper for causing Donald Trump to now be leading in some polls and costing Hillary the election. \\nAnthony Weiner is the abuser. Your letter helped that abuse to continue. How can I rebuild my life when you have made finding out my \u201cstory\u201d the goal of every reporter? \\nShe signs the letter with, \u201cGirl that lost faith in America.\u201d \\nAnd that coming from a girl who is barely starting her life, but who is also approaching voting age is heartbreaking. \\nFeatured Image via Alex Wong/Getty Images Share this Article!'"}, "time": 1742628301.5136487}
