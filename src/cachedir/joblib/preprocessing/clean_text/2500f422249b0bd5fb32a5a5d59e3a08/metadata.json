It comes in the shower. It comes when you\u2019re doodling or playing trains with your son. \u2018Hamilton\u2019 forced me to double down on being awake to the inspirations of just living my life. \u201d Mr. Miranda\u2019s observation bodes ill for the future, not just of creativity but also of healthy bodies, minds and relationships. No doubt you\u2019ve seen the following scenarios, probably many times: \u2022 Young couples out to dinner pull out their smartphones to check messages, emails and social networks even before scanning the menu, and check their phones repeatedly throughout the meal. \u2022 Shoppers and commuters standing in line, people crossing busy streets, even cyclists and drivers whose eyes are on their phones instead of their surroundings. \u2022 Toddlers in strollers playing with a digital device  \u2014   a parent\u2019s or perhaps even their own  \u2014   instead of observing and learning from the world around them. \u2022 People walking down the street with eyes on their phones, bumping into others, tripping over or crashing into obstacles. Observations like these have prompted a New York psychotherapist to ask, \u201cWhat really matters?\u201d in life. In her enlightening new book, \u201cThe Power of Off,\u201d Nancy Colier observes that \u201cwe are spending far too much of our time doing things that don\u2019t really matter to us. \u201d Both in and outside her practice, she has encountered many people who have become \u201cdisconnected from what really matters, from what makes us feel nourished and grounded as human beings. \u201d The   access to digital technology, starting at ever younger ages, is transforming modern society in ways that can have negative effects on physical and mental health, neurological development and personal relationships, not to mention safety on our roads and sidewalks. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m no Luddite. I love technology. I love the convenience and assistance afforded by the myriad apps on my cellphone, a   information bank. I remember being amazed, as a Times reporter back in the early 1980s, when I started using word processing and realized how much faster I could write an article. Now computers save tons of time and effort and avert countless embarrassing errors because I can look up facts, figures, spelling, definitions and scholarly publications without leaving my ergonomic chair. But I also love putting my computer in sleep mode and going for a walk with my dog, meeting and chatting with friends, acquaintances and strangers, some of whom have become friends. As with so much else in life, moderation in our digital world should be the hallmark of a healthy relationship with technology. Too many of us have become slaves to the devices that were supposed to free us, giving us more time to experience life and the people we love. Instead, we\u2019re constantly bombarded by bells, buzzes and chimes that alert us to messages we feel compelled to view and respond to immediately. \u201cMost people now check their smartphones 150 times per day, or every six minutes,\u201d Ms. Colier wrote. \u201cAnd young adults are now sending an average of 110 texts per day. \u201d Furthermore, she added, \u201c46 percent of smartphone users now say that their devices are something they \u2018couldn\u2019t live without. \u2019\u201d In \u201cThe World Unplugged Project,\u201d investigators at the University of Maryland reported that \u201ca clear majority\u201d of students in the 10 countries studied experienced distress when they tried to go without their devices for 24 hours. One in three people admitted they\u2019d rather give up sex than their smartphones. I fear we are turning into digital robots. Will future generations know how to converse with one another face to face? Will they notice the birds, trees, sunrise and the people with whom they share the planet? Instead of visiting art galleries, attending concerts or walking on picturesque wooded paths, one woman I know who came to Woodstock, N. Y. last summer spent the weekend on her iPad communing with her many \u201cfriends\u201d on Facebook. All I could think was \u201cWhat a waste!\u201d Why, you may ask, is it so important to limit our digital lives? \u201cWithout open spaces and downtime, the nervous system never shuts down  \u2014   it\u2019s in constant    mode,\u201d Ms. Colier said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re wired and tired all the time. Even computers reboot, but we\u2019re not doing it. \u201d She continued, \u201cIt\u2019s connections to other human beings  \u2014     connections, not digital ones  \u2014   that nourish us and make us feel like we count. Our presence, our full attention is the most important thing we can give each other. Digital communications don\u2019t result in deeper connections, in feeling loved and supported. \u201d How often is your real work interrupted by signals from your smartphone that you find impossible to ignore? Have you ever avoided intimacy with your partner because you\u2019re in the midst of iPhone Scrabble? Is endlessly snapping selfies and posting your every action and thought on social media creating an unhealthy  ? As for physical   every hour spent on a device is likely to be an indoor, sedentary one. Screens are stealing time that children and adolescents should be spending on physical activity and sports, reading, or creating and engaging directly with other children, all of which are critical to healthy physical and social development. \u201cChildren who overuse online media are at risk of problematic internet use, and heavy users of video games are at risk of internet gaming disorder\u201d (translation: addiction) the American Academy of Pediatrics wrote in its latest policy statement on media use. Ms. Colier, a licensed clinical social worker, said, \u201cThe only difference between digital addiction and other addictions is that this is a socially condoned behavior. \u201d While her book contains a   digital detox program, in our interview she offered three steps to help curb one\u2019s digital dependence. 1. Start by recognizing how much digital use is really needed, say, for work or navigation or letting family members know you\u2019re O. K. and what is merely a habit of responding, posting and  . 2. Make little changes. Refrain from using your device while eating or spending time with friends, and add one thing a day that\u2019s done without the phone. 3. Become very conscious of what is important to you, what really nourishes you, and devote more time and attention to it.'"}, "time": 1742628506.0092769}
