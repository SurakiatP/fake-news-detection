[Standing next to her attorney Lisa Bloom, the    My Life on the   star said the firestorm generated by the photograph  \u2014   after which she was fired from CNN and had at least five scheduled performances cancelled  \u2014   would have never occurred had the photograph been taken by a male artist.  \u201cI don\u2019t think I will have a career after this. I\u2019m going to be honest, he broke me,\u201d Griffin said as she began to choke up. \u201cIf you don\u2019t stand up, you get run over,\u201d she added. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening to me has never happened ever in the history of this great country. Which is that a sitting president of the United States and his grown children and the First Lady are personally, I feel, personally trying to ruin my life forever. \u201d \u201cHe picked me, I\u2019m the easiest target,\u201d she continued. (Watch: Press conference begins at the 40:22 mark) Griffin said the widespread backlash she has faced over the photo is part of a sexist campaign to destroy her career. \u201cIt\u2019s a bunch of white guys trying to silence me,\u201d she said. \u201cThis wouldn\u2019t be happening to a guy. This is a woman thing. \u201d Griffin told reporters that the process of preparing for the photograph took just minutes, and was intended to be a parody of the president\u2019s comments about former Fox News anchor Megan Kelly, when he said last year after a presidential debate that the anchor \u201chad blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her whatever. \u201d \u201cI said let\u2019s get in trouble, let\u2019s give them something to talk about,\u201d Griffin recalled, adding that she \u201cnever imagined it could be misinterpreted. \u201d During the press conference, Griffin was asked about a report that claimed Trump\u2019s youngest son,    Barron Trump, was traumatized by the image after he saw it on television, because he did not know who Griffin was or the context in which the photograph was taken. \u201cAllegedly\u201d traumatized, Bloom replied. \u201cYou\u2019re assuming everything the Trumps say is true. \u201d Griffin, for her part, said she \u201cwould never want to hurt anyone, especially a child. \u201d The comedian reiterated that she meant what she said in her apology video earlier this week, in which she said the image  \u2014   taken by L. A.  photographer Tyler Shields, who has since defended the work  \u2014   had gone \u201ctoo far\u201d and that she had \u201ccrossed a line. \u201d But Griffin added that she would continue to make fun of the president in the wake of the controversy. Another attorney for Griffin confirmed during the press conference that the Secret Service had opened an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the photo shoot. Reaction to the press conference came swiftly on Twitter, as \u201cLisa Bloom\u201d began trending on the social media platform Friday morning. Some observers said the press conference was not effective from a crisis management perspective. Lisa Bloom just failed the first rule of being an attorney: never take a question you don\u2019t already know the answer to.  \u2014   Emily Zanotti (@emzanotti) June 2, 2017,  So Kathy Griffin was a victim of sexism!
