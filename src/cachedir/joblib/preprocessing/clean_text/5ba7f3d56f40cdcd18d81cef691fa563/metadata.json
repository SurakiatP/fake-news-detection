That much was clear from the swift and unforgiving backlash after an investigative journalist used financial documents to suggest in an article  published on Sunday that Anita Raja, an Italian translator, was behind Ms. Ferrante\u2019s books. Many readers saw the story  \u2014   which appeared simultaneously on the website of The New York Review of Books and in an Italian, a German and a French publication  \u2014   not only as a violation of privacy but as an unprovoked aggression against an author known for female protagonists who use radical   to exert power over their lives and fates. In his article, Claudio Gatti, a reporter for Il Sole 24 Ore, an Italian financial daily, did not definitively name Ms. Raja as Ms. Ferrante, but he described financial records indicating that payments from Ms. Ferrante\u2019s publishing house, Edizioni   to Ms. Raja, a consultant there, had risen dramatically since 2014, when Ms. Ferrante\u2019s four Neapolitan novels became an international publishing phenomenon. His report drew broad condemnation in the literary world, with writers for The New Yorker, The New Republic, The Times Literary Supplement and elsewhere questioning whether an intriguing literary mystery needed to be resolved through tough investigative journalism techniques. \u201cYou do an investigation into property for tax evaders, not for those who want to preserve their anonymity,\u201d the Italian novelist Erri De Luca wrote in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s a serious violation of the right to privacy. I\u2019m sorry for Anita Raja, who will now be forced into celebrity. \u201d Running through the conversation was the notion that Mr. Gatti\u2019s expos\u00e9 was a sexist violation  \u2014   yet another example, critics said, at a moment of intense debate over gender inequality, of how successful women find themselves bullied and demeaned by men. \u201cPeople really went there very quickly,\u201d Elaine Showalter, a retired professor at Princeton University and the author of numerous works of feminist criticism, said of the charge of sexism against Mr. Gatti. \u201cHere\u2019s a woman who is not only extremely successful but explores women\u2019s lives in a way that doesn\u2019t depict men very favorably,\u201d Ms. Showalter continued. People may be seeing Mr. Gatti\u2019s unmasking of the author, she added, \u201cas a kind of revenge. \u201d Mr. Gatti said in an interview that he did not understand the strong reactions. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going after a woman, I was going after a mystery,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like to ask the people who didn\u2019t want to know, \u2018Explain what work of art in the history of art has been ruined or damaged by knowing who the artist is?\u2019 I can name many, many cases where the art is enhanced. \u201d Hugh Eakin, editor of The New York Review\u2019s blog, which published the   version of Mr. Gatti\u2019s report, said the occasion for the piece was the forthcoming   release of an expanded version of a book of Ms. Ferrante\u2019s nonfiction writings, in which the author says she grew up in Naples as the daughter of a seamstress. \u201cNow that an expanded version is about to be published in English, it seemed there was a legitimate occasion to inquire about the relation between the book and its author,\u201d Mr. Eakin wrote. Ms. Raja was born in Naples, but grew up in Rome, the daughter of an Italian father and, as Mr. Gatti said in a deeply reported sidebar, a Polish Jewish mother who fled Nazi Germany for Italy. Ms. Raja\u2019s husband, the novelist Domenico Starnone, has said in interviews that he grew up in Naples and that his mother was a seamstress. He has spent years saying that he is not Ms. Ferrante. Ms. Raja has also denied authorship of Ms. Ferrante\u2019s books. Mr. Eakin added of Mr. Gatti\u2019s reporting, \u201cThough it amasses considerable evidence it\u2019s also worth noting the article does not make a conclusive statement. \u201d (Mr. Gatti had approached The New York Times several weeks ago about possibly publishing his research, but the newspaper decided not to pursue the arrangement, which would have involved coordinating with multiple journalistic partners.) Over the years, there have been other attempts to unmask authors, such as Joe Klein, who wrote \u201cPrimary Colors,\u201d a roman \u00e0 clef about Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 campaign, or Anne Desclos, who used a pseudonym when she wrote the 1954 erotic classic \u201cThe Story of O. \u201d But the effort to unveil Ms. Ferrante seemed to hit a deeper chord, perhaps because she has said in interviews that anonymity was crucial to her writing process. And it seemed to reveal a clash of sensibilities  \u2014   between the journalistic and the literary, between those who believe anyone who publishes is fair game and those who believe some secrets should be kept. In short, a clash between the world of   reporting and the emotional truths of fiction. The publication in four languages simultaneously was \u201cvery aggressive  \u2014   more appropriate to the capture of a criminal,\u201d the novelist Alexander Chee wrote in an email. \u201cShe seems to have offended him by keeping herself private  \u2014   it\u2019s like the literary version of \u2018How to Talk to a Woman Wearing Headphones,\u2019\u201d he added, referring to recent controversy over a blog post. Even some readers who admit they were curious to know say that they somehow didn\u2019t want Ms. Ferrante\u2019s identity to be made public. The editor of The Times Literary Supplement, Stig Abell, wrote a piece called \u201cWhy the TLS Would Not Have Named Elena Ferrante,\u201d citing the author\u2019s right to privacy. Salman Rushdie took to Facebook. \u201cI am Elena Ferrante,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn the spirit of \u2018I am Spartacus,\u2019 in the wake of the New York Review of Books\u2019 tawdry \u2018expos\u00e9\u2019 of her identity, every writer in the world should do this now. \u201d Not all writers shared that position. The critic Marco Roth said that Mr. Gatti\u2019s reporting was valuable, even inevitable. \u201cConditions change for all writers once they\u2019ve been published and it\u2019s na\u00efve to assume that Ferrante\u2019s pseudonymity (had it been protected) would have allowed her to flower forever in the brilliant vein of \u2018My Brilliant Friend,\u2019\u201d Mr. Roth wrote on Facebook, referring to the first of Ms. Ferrante\u2019s Neapolitan novels. \u201cAnita Raja will now have to work this new twist in her life into the next stage of her work, whatever that may be. No writer can control or really has the right to control the conditions of her reception,\u201d Mr. Roth added. Some writers invoked the rhetoric of sexual assault in condemning Mr. Gatti\u2019s approach. Alexandra Schwartz, on the website of The New Yorker, blasted Mr. Gatti\u2019s justifications for his unmasking  \u2014   that Ms. Ferrante is a public figure and the public who buys her books has a right to know. \u201cCertainly Gatti does not explain why he feels so free to interpret Ferrante\u2019s \u2018no\u2019 as his \u2018yes,\u2019\u201d Ms. Schwartz wrote. Some critics speculated on why readers were so protective of Ms. Ferrante\u2019s anonymity. \u201cBy protecting her privacy, she protected ours,\u201d the critic Dayna Tortorici wrote in a post on N+1. \u201cMore than Ferrante herself, her readers have benefited from her choice. \u201d \u201cWe are as invested in her anonymity  \u2014   and her autonomy  \u2014   as she is,\u201d she added. \u201cIt is a compact: she won\u2019t tell us, we won\u2019t ask, and she won\u2019t change her mind and tell us anyway. In exchange, she\u2019ll write books and we\u2019ll read them. \u201d Ann Goldstein, who translated Ms. Ferrante\u2019s novels into English, said in an interview that she hoped the latest revelations, however inconclusive, would not change how readers approached Ms. Ferrante\u2019s books. \u201cI think people will read them the same way they\u2019ve always read them,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how important the author is. I\u2019d take her position the books are in the world. They are what they are. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742564561.1816883}
