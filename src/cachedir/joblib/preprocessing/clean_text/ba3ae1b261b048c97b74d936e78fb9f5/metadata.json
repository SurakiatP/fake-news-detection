Let me know if this is ok with you. Thanks.\u201d Gregg saw the images and he immediately wanted to know who the source was and if they wanted to elaborate on these photos. He was told:\\n\u201cUnfortunately my source does not want to be known and would rather remain anonymous\u2026 I\u2019m sure they have some pretty good reasons and I must respect their wishes. As long as the information gets out there I think that\u2019s the most important thing I\u2019ll send you more photos later on in the day when I have a chance thank you.\u201d\\nTHESE ARE THE SHOCKING PHOTOS GREGG RECEIVED : \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'"}, "time": 1742561860.7883298}
