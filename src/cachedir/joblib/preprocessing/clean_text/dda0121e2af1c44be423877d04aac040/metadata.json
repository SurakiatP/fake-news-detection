Just how autonomous can and should cars become? the engineers are asking. Is there an inherent danger in technology that invites human drivers to sit back and relax  \u2014   but still requires them to be ready to hit the brakes or grab the wheel at the first sign of trouble? Those questions have taken on a new urgency after the revelation this week that the driver of a Tesla Model S died in a crash in Florida while the electric car was operating in its Autopilot mode. The man, Joshua Brown, 40, of Canton, Ohio, was driving on a divided highway, when a   truck made a left turn and crossed in front of Mr. Brown\u2019s lane of traffic. Tesla said neither Mr. Brown nor the car\u2019s   system noticed the white truck against a bright sky, and the brakes were never applied. For now, other automakers are giving no sign of slowing down their efforts to push forward with cars that can drive themselves. But mainly they say the technology isn\u2019t ready yet  \u2014   which for many is an implicit rebuke of Tesla\u2019s willingness to tempt   drivers to turn tomorrow\u2019s vision into today\u2019s road reality. On Friday, even as the world was absorbing news of Mr. Brown\u2019s death as the first known fatality of the autonomous driving revolution, the German automaker BMW said it intended to offer a \u201c  car\u201d  \u2014   but not until 2021. And it will have much different technology than is now available on the Tesla Model S. \u201cToday we are standing at the brink of a new revolution,\u201d Harald Kr\u00fcger, BMW chief executive, said at a news conference in Munich. Mr. Kr\u00fcger added that the Tesla crash was \u201creally very sad\u201d and said BMW would need \u201cthe next few years\u201d to perfect its autonomous driving system. \u201cToday the technologies are not ready for serious production,\u201d he said. The world\u2019s largest carmaker, Toyota, is a notable holdout in the rush toward completely autonomous cars. Last year, the company said that it would invest $1 billion in a Silicon   research effort to focus on cars that will function as \u201cguardian angels,\u201d saving human drivers from errors, rather than replacing them. Tesla, which started its Autopilot feature last fall, has emphasized in discussing Mr. Brown\u2019s death that the system isn\u2019t intended to take over complete control of the car and that drivers must keep their hands on the steering wheel and remain alert and engaged. The point highlights the difference in approach that separates companies working on   technology. Ford Motor, Google, Volvo and others are aiming at offering fully autonomous cars that can operate safely without human intervention at all  \u2014   an approach engineers call Level 4 automated driving. Those companies are wary of semiautonomous, or Level 3, technology that can drive the car for stretches of road under certain circumstances, but requires drivers to be ready to take over. Tesla\u2019s Autopilot is not even a fully fledged Level 3 technology, and some experts say it is a risky approach. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge inherent danger and it\u2019s well proven  \u2014   the computer making a mistake and the driver not taking over quickly enough,\u201d said Mark Wakefield, a managing director at Alix Partners, a consulting firm with a large automotive practice. The trouble is that while semiautonomous systems like Tesla\u2019s are guiding a car, human drivers can be lulled into feeling they are able to turn their attention away from the road. Mr. Brown, like some other Model S owners, posted videos showing the driver with no hands on the steering wheel. In one video, a driver climbs into the back seat. Pete Cordaro, the owner of a vending machine company from Connellsville, Pa. owns a 2013 Model S that does not have Autopilot. But he drove a loaner with the feature earlier this year while his was being repaired. He loves his car and has deposits to buy two Model 3 compacts when that car is available, yet he is \u201con the fence\u201d about getting Autopilot. While the technology \u201cwas the greatest thing\u201d on closed highways like the Pennsylvania Turnpike, it could become confused in more complicated environments like construction zones, Mr. Cordaro said. \u201cMy experience is it\u2019s really not completely safe except in   highways,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gives you a false sense of security. You get comfortable and think you can take your hands off the wheel but you really can\u2019t. It should be called   instead of Autopilot, because that\u2019s all it is. \u201d Even Amnon Shashua, an executive whose technology is part of Tesla\u2019s   feature, said on Friday that he did not think  \u2019s time had yet come. Mr. Shashua is   and chairman of Mobileye, an Israeli company that makes camera and sensing technology. According to the Tesla website, Tesla uses Mobileye components but developed the   system in the Model S itself. Mobileye, along with the chip maker Intel, is at work in a partnership with BMW on the   car that the German automaker described in Munich on Friday that is supposed to be available in 2021. Mr. Shashua suggested that   technology was close, but still not quite ready for actual use without human drivers remaining engaged. \u201cFive years is a very short time,\u201d Mr. Shashua said. \u201cOn the other hand, it is a sufficient time to do the types of validations that are needed. \u201d The BMW car Mobileye is collaborating on will be capable of piloting itself on highways, but not necessarily in complex urban settings. Automakers and technology companies still need to do \u201chundreds of thousands or millions of kilometers of validation and simulations\u201d in closed testing environments to be certain the technology is safe, Mr. Shashua said. \u201cI think it is very important, especially given this accident and what we hear in the news, that companies are very transparent about the limitations of the system,\u201d he said. Although Tesla has publicly said that it has enhanced the Mobileye technology, the company has not commented on whether it has enhanced the system to protect against what the industry describes as \u201clateral turn across path\u201d \u2014   the type of situation in the Florida accident. Others in the automotive industry are working on sensor technologies meant to detect vehicles from all angles. One approach is lidar  \u2014   a system that uses rotating laser beams. Lidar is being used in the experimental autonomous vehicle being developed by BMW, as well as those by Google, Nissan and Apple. But it remains unclear whether the laser system will come down enough in price to use in   cars.'"}, "time": 1742563148.9537501}
