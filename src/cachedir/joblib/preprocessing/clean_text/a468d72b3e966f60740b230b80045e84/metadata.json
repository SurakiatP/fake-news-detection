There are   BBQ joints that look straight out of Brooklyn gastro pubs with cocktail gardens and a chain of crepe restaurants that has set up shop in nearly every neighborhood. Yet regional Colombian fare from outside the capital has long been the city\u2019s weak spot. Until now. As Bogot\u00e1 has increasingly become a melting pot of cultures from every part of Colombia, restaurants focusing on regional dishes and ingredients are opening with regularity. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing not only an increase in the quality of food, and better service in restaurants, but a boom of interesting concepts,\u201d said Gaeleen Quinn, who founded the Bogot\u00e1 Wine and Food Festival. Leonor Espinosa has been exploring rural Colombian flavors for a decade at her upscale restaurant Leo Cocina y Cava, but in late 2014 she opened the less pricey Misia, a fresh take on traditional snack spots, in a space decorated with   clay tiles and recycled    . The restaurant showcases the popular cuisine of Colombia\u2019s Caribbean coast with coconut milk ceviches and   cured meats, like blood sausages, and longanizas, made from smoked hen. The star plate is the posta negra, based on a family recipe of Ms. Espinosa\u2019s, which features an eye of round roast doused in a rich, dark sauce made with garlic, various spices and an unrefined cane sugar called panela. Each table is set with bottles of   hot sauces and   vinegars, which can be bought on the way out. It has been such a success that a second location was opened in the Zona G last February. At El Pan\u00f3ptico, located a short walk from Misia inside the sprawling Museo Nacional, the chef Eduardo Martinez clipped herbs from a pot in the courtyard. Mr. Martinez, an agricultural engineer who also owns the restaurant Mini Mal in the Chapinero Alto neighborhood to the north, has worked with several foundations to foster culinary diversity in the country. With El Pan\u00f3ptico, which opened in 2013, he looks to neglected regional ingredients, many of them from the Andes or the Amazon, like aj\u00ed negro, a fermented and reduced yuca extract. Mr. Martinez thinly slices a forgotten native tuber called guatila like a carpaccio, in the hopes of reintroducing it to local kitchens. \u201cMany don\u2019t like it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey call it the \u2018potato of the poor,\u2019 or \u2018food for pigs.\u2019 All of these tubers seem strange to many people. They aren\u2019t in supermarkets. We try to present them in a way they\u2019ll understand. \u201d Some ingredients have been overlooked for so long that few can even remember how to use them. The recipe for a corn and peanut soup called samai, in fact, comes from a grandmother named Mercedes Tisoy, who serves it during celebrations in the   Sibundoy Valley, in the southwest of the country. You can smell the freshly baked pan de bono, a   cheese bread typical of Cali, Colombia\u2019s   city, as you walk past Escuela Taller, a school for   youth just down the street from Bogot\u00e1\u2019s Capitolo Nacional, the capital building. It houses the   La Escuela, a restaurant and bakery serving inexpensive dishes from remote regions like the Choc\u00f3 and Arauca. Inside, 60 students enrolled in a   program do a range of tasks, like roasting their own coffee, which is sold in the cafe working the register and   plantains to make fritters. The   menu offers dishes like fried Magdalena River fish, called mojarra, with coconut rice, or the chuleta valluna, a breaded pork chop typical of the rural Cauca Valley outside Cali. The young servers also help decipher the long list of freshly pressed juices like araz\u00e1 or camu camu. Colombia\u2019s undeveloped and rarely visited Pacific Coast has a set of ingredients all its own, like a shark called a toyo, and an herb called cilantro cimarr\u00f3n if you wanted to taste them, however, you were probably better off going to the port town of to Buenaventura. Now Rey Guerrero has established himself as Bogot\u00e1\u2019s ambassador to the recipes of that region, which have gained recognition since his appearance on the Colombian TV cooking show \u201cLa Prueba\u201d in 2014. His Bogot\u00e1 restaurant, Rey Guerrero Pescader\u00eda Gourmet, a single, large dining room painted with vibrant   murals on the walls, serves a long list of   and   dishes, like the arroz tumbacatre, a spicy regional version of arroz con mariscos, or seafood rice. \u201cIn Europe they have foie gras, in the Pacific we have piangua,\u201d he said, referring to the region\u2019s flavorful,   black clam, with which he makes a ceviche. \u201cEsto es puro Pacifico. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742628485.5318675}
