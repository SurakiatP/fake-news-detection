[\u201cIf it\u2019s legally binding, which court can the parties go to? And the countries that do not comply, will they respect that court?\u201d Cayetano said to reporters, as reported by Reuters. \u201cLet\u2019s start with it being binding, gentlemen\u2019s agreement. We have a community of nations that signed it. \u201d  He was referring to the draft framework for a South China Sea code of conduct between ASEAN and China on Thursday. Cayetano seemed to be throwing in the towel on getting China to sign a more stringent contract. As Reuters delicately puts it, there is \u201cregional skepticism whether Beijing will commit to rules likely to restrain its maritime ambitions. \u201d Such a \u201cgentleman\u2019s agreement\u201d would control shipping lanes that handle five trillion dollars per year in commerce. The proposal follows remarks by President Rodrigo Duterte that China was installing \u201csome kind of armed garrison\u201d on the disputed South China Sea islands it claims. Reuters notes that some of ASEAN\u2019s representatives believe China is playing along with the draft framework merely to \u201cbuy time for Beijing to wrap up construction activities,\u201d at which point Chinese ownership of everything Beijing covets in the region would be a fait accompli, despite the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague ruling against Chinese claims of sovereignty last year. China largely ignored the ruling, which explains Cayetano\u2019s doubt that any controlling legal authority to enforce anything stricter than a gentleman\u2019s agreement could be found. Chinese officials spoke vaguely of encouraging progress made in the talks with ASEAN but would not establish a firm timeline for finalizing a Code of Conduct. For their part, the Association nations took a notably softer stance against Chinese development of disputed islands, abandoning complaints about \u201cland reclamation and militarization\u201d at their April 30 summit meeting that were part of the previous year\u2019s declarations.  At the time, Philippine President Duterte bluntly stated that complaining about China\u2019s maritime activities was pointless because no one could pressure China into halting them  \u2014   a similar, if less tactful, sentiment to the one expressed by Duterte\u2019s foreign secretary at Thursday\u2019s meeting. Deputy Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin, head of the Chinese delegation, said the new draft framework \u201cwill be an internal document and nobody should publish it,\u201d because keeping the details confidential was key to \u201cfuture consultations\u201d with the ASEAN nations. Liu also expressed hope that \u201cour consultations on the code are not subject to any outside interference,\u201d in a rather obvious jab at the United States.  A report from the South China Morning Post said: China and ASEAN committed to drafting the code 15 years ago, and while it should, in theory, tame how they behave in the South China Sea, it remains an open question whether Beijing will be willing to slow construction of artificial islands and pursuit of effective control over disputed territory. It\u2019s another question whether Southeast Asian countries will have any leverage to ask Beijing to respect the rules. The SCMP report states that China and the Philippines will continue bilateral talks aimed at \u201ccreating conditions for a final settlement over the two side\u2019s claims in the South China Sea. \u201d Four ASEAN countries, including Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam, and the Philippines, have territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea, along with Taiwan, which is not a member of ASEAN.'"}, "time": 1742562634.860967}
