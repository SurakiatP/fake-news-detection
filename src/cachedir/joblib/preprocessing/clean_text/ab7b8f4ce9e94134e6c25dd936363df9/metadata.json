{"duration": 0.12955498695373535, "input_args": {"text": "'LONDON  \u2014   A partial list of the onstage casualties amassed during a mere three days of theatergoing here: attempted suicides: four successful suicides: five accidental death by reckless use of a firearm: one death by natural causes, hastened by the cruelty of a spouse: one loss of trust in others: immense and incalculable happy endings: one, and that one highly suspect. Usually, when the skies are gray and this city\u2019s mood is bleak  \u2014   that\u2019s status quo in 2016  \u2014   a classic   (or  ) can be relied on to provide sentimental escapism for West End audiences. Not so in this summer of anxiety, when it feels as if every love story has a body count. The statistics cited above do not even include the latest version of the eternal            tale. \u201cRomeo and Juliet\u201d has been staged by the Kenneth Branagh Company with a paparazzo\u2019s eye for \u201cLa Dolce Vita\u201d  glamour and rue among the rich and famous. (That would raise the number of suicides to seven never mind the collateral murders.) Or Rufus Norris and Simon Stephens\u2019s gleefully scurrilous reimagining of Brecht and Weill\u2019s \u201cThe Threepenny Opera\u201d at the National Theater, in which the crime lord Macheath (Rory Kinnear) is led straight to the gallows by his wayward, willful sexuality. (Murders and acts of torture: too many to itemize assault by rectal insertion of knife: one.) These grim numbers are instead gleaned entirely from five productions that I saw more or less   . They are Terence Rattigan\u2019s \u201cThe Deep Blue Sea\u201d at the National Theater, in which the wondrous Helen McCrory adds yet another memorable portrait to her gallery of devastatingly devastated women a     engrossing marathon of early Chekhov works (also at the National) an especially bruising \u201cMidsummer Night\u2019s Dream\u201d at Shakespeare\u2019s Globe and Simon Stone\u2019s merciless and mesmerizing updating of Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca\u2019s \u201cYerma,\u201d starring a fabulous Billie Piper. For audiences who like their sex on the silly side, a longstanding and popular preference in British theater, there are jauntier accounts of erotic mayhem. They include \u201cThe Truth,\u201d by the French dramatist du jour, Florian Zeller (\u201cThe Father\u201d) a precisely drawn and equally predictable romantic quadrangle at Wyndham\u2019s Theater and around the block, at the Duke of York\u2019s Theater, a spiffing revival of \u201cHow the Other Half Loves\u201d (1969) Alan Ayckbourn\u2019s ingenious,    bending portrait of overlapping marriages. Both these plays qualify as farces, albeit of a literate ilk. But it\u2019s important to note their frantic plots are propelled by the increasingly improbable lies characters perpetrate in the name of adultery, forever contaminating their closest relationships. (The truth of Mr. Zeller\u2019s title is what people do their best to conceal.) The laughter elicited here has a sting in its tail. If you believe that love is both comic and tragic, as do most sensible people who have lost their senses in its name, there\u2019s no better place to start than the canon of Chekhov. The National\u2019s     omnibus \u201cYoung Chekhov,\u201d which originated at the Chichester Festival Theater, assesses the shifting   dichotomy in three early works by this greatest of modern playwrights: \u201cPlatonov,\u201d \u201cIvanov\u201d and \u201cThe Seagull. \u201d Directed by Jonathan Kent, from   translations by the British dramatist David Hare, these productions show how slapstick and   angst breathe the same romantic oxygen in Chekhov\u2019s universe. It\u2019s fascinating to watch that balance being further adjusted with each successive play and to see the multicast ensemble embody both sides of the tragicomic equation. (My favorite transformation is that of James McArdle from the hapless homme fatale Platonov into the puritanical doctor of \u201cIvanov. \u201d) Mr. Kent\u2019s staging of the party scenes, with their clashes of classes and egos, is masterly. So is his sense of Chekhov as a social satirist, whose characters are closer to the quirky grotesques of Charles Dickens than we usually realize. Yet while I was always absorbed by \u201cYoung Chekhov,\u201d I was seldom moved, partly because of the broadness of so much of the acting, especially in \u201cThe Seagull. \u201d There is one deeply affecting moment, though, that captures perfectly the pathos of a failing marriage. It comes in the first act of \u201cIvanov,\u201d when Anna Petrovna (the exquisite Nina Sosanya) the ailing wife of the title character, tightly embraces her husband (Geoffrey Streatfeild) from behind. The sudden look of raw panic in Mr. Streatfeild\u2019s eyes, and the desperate hope in Ms. Sosanya\u2019s, say everything you need to know about why this relationship is doomed. The disjunction of love and reason is the frantic animator of \u201cA Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream\u201d at Shakespeare\u2019s Globe. This spirited but effortful interpretation is the inaugural offering of the Globe\u2019s new artistic director, Emma Rice, best known for her blissful stage version of No\u00ebl Coward\u2019s \u201cBrief Encounter\u201d (on Broadway in 2010). Ms. Rice has said that a large part of her mandate for the Globe is to make its productions more accessible and inclusive, in terms of gender and ethnicity. So this \u201cDream\u201d features a mostly female (and delightful) troupe of amateur thespians for the play within the play a punkish epicene Puck (the Welsh actress Katy Owen) and a gay relationship among the central quartet of young lovers. (Helena is now Helenus, appealingly played by Ankur Bahl.) The production is replete with sight gags, slapstick, topical references (including winking nods to Ms. Rice\u2019s nontraditional approach)   music and witty burlesque turns by the Australian cabaret performer Meow Meow as Titania. The goofy pageantry and high concepts can weigh down the humor, though, and you wish Ms. Rice had trusted more in the transporting buoyancy of the language. You can also sense this production\u2019s distaste for the coercive erotic encounters brought about by fairy chemistry. (In an interview in the program, Ms. Rice says Titania\u2019s infatuation with the   Bottom is the result of \u201ca date rape drug. \u201d) In the double role of the mortal and fairy monarchs, Theseus and Oberon, Zubin Varla is polymorphously perverse and a bit of a brute. No wonder Theseus\u2019s bride, Hippolyta (also Meow Meow) is seen chugging whiskey to get her through her wedding night. Love turns not just sour but deeply rancid in the blistering \u201cYerma\u201d at the Young Vic, the hottest incubator of revitalized classics in London. Mr. Stone, an Australian director and dramatist, has transplanted Lorca\u2019s poetic folk tale of a provincial Spanish woman\u2019s yearning to have a child into the London of today. The central character is   Her, a successful journalist (Ms. Piper, of \u201cDoctor Who\u201d fame) who decides it\u2019s time for her and her husband (the excellent Brendan Cowell) to have a baby. Their inability to conceive drives the woman into an escalating frenzy of despair that destroys her marriage. She chronicles this erosion in a blog. As befits a story of the 21st century, the lines between private grief and public exposure have blurred dizzyingly, a notion ingeniously underscored by Lizzie Clachan\u2019s   box of a set, which intersects the audience. Those walls, by the way, are of little help in keeping us at an emotional remove. How could they be, given the extraordinary, painful transparency of Ms. Piper\u2019s performance? In \u201cThe Deep Blue Sea,\u201d Rattigan\u2019s 1952 play about an eminent barrister\u2019s wife who has left her husband for a young pilot, Ms. McCrory goes out on nearly as   a limb as Ms. Piper does. In Carrie Cracknell\u2019s haunting production, Ms. McCrory conveys the ravening, cancerous feelings beneath the socially smooth, reflexively gracious surface of her character, Hester Collyer. Tom Scutt\u2019s evocation of the shabby boardinghouse in which Hester now lives has   walls, so we\u2019re always aware of the impinging lives of the other residents. As in the Young Vic\u2019s \u201cYerma,\u201d this \u201cDeep Blue Sea\u201d suggests how tortured,    relationships can become the stuff of voyeuristic speculation and gossip. That was true for the last character Ms. McCrory embodied at the National, Euripides\u2019 Medea. And a simple dialogue Hester has with her estranged but still adoring husband (Peter Sullivan) captures the essence of romantic tragedies from the ancient Greeks onward. \u201cWhat happened to you, Hester?\u201d he asks. Her answer is prompt and abject: \u201cLove, Bill, that\u2019s all. \u201d'"}, "time": 1742563445.968453}
