Bannon, former Breitbart News executive chairman, founding host of Breitbart News Daily, and now chief strategist for the incoming Trump White House, made a special appearance on the final live show of 2016. [\u201cI\u2019m only doing this because of the great audience we\u2019ve got here and your producing team, led by Caroline Magyarits  \u2014   and you, Matt, that you\u2019re hosting the thing. So, glad to be on,\u201d Bannon told SiriusXM host Matt Boyle.  \u201cThis was the most amazing year we\u2019ve seen, both here in the United States and overseas,\u201d Boyle said, describing those events as a \u201crevolt of the working class. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s pretty amazing,\u201d Bannon agreed. \u201cAs you know, with the website, with Breitbart and with the radio show, particularly the weekend show and then the daily show, we\u2019ve been following this and reporting on it for years. \u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s something we saw build up particularly in Europe, with the great team we\u2019ve got over in London, led by Raheem and James Delingpole,\u201d he said, referring to Breitbart London chief editor and frequent Breitbart News Daily host Raheem Kassam. \u201cThat led ultimately to Brexit, after all the different European Parliament votes they had and everything that UKIP kind of led. \u201d \u201cAnd then here in the United States, where we saw it build up in the primaries, and then in the general election,\u201d he continued. \u201cI think we\u2019ve lived through an historic time. I think we\u2019ll talk about what happened in this year politically for many, many decades to come. It was exciting to live through it, and very exciting to be at SiriusXM, you know, the Patriot Channel with the show, and at Breitbart to actually see and report on it and comment on it. \u201d Bannon said, \u201cThe best thing we ever had was both the comments section at Breitbart and the callers, the great audience we\u2019ve got here at SiriusXM, to call and share every day what their feelings were. \u201d \u201cWe used to tease, after John McCain made that speech that time, that called our audience \u2018hobbits,\u2019 it was always great to hear what the hobbits had to say because at the end of the day what they had to say was what mattered most,\u201d he said. Bannon\u2019s message to the hobbits and \u201cdeplorables\u201d  \u2014   to quote Hillary Clinton\u2019s memorable slander of Trump voters  \u2014   was to keep in mind that it\u2019s only the \u201ctop of the first inning\u201d for their movement. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to stay engaged,\u201d he advised, pleased to see high levels of engagement in \u201ctraffic at all the different sites, and the activity you see, the comments sections at the various sites you see, and how great the radio show is doing. \u201d \u201cThe Trump administration, I think it\u2019s three weeks from the day exactly is when President Trump will take the oath of office. So let\u2019s hold people accountable and stay engaged. There will be a lot of exciting activity over the next couple of years,\u201d he promised. \u201cStay engaged. Stay on top of stuff. I think \u201917 will be actually more exciting than \u201916 was. \u201d  \u201cSo continue to go to various sites that are out there, where you get your news and information, and then obviously continue to listen to the various shows on the Patriot Channel. You\u2019ve got so many great shows  \u2014   you know, David Webb, Wilkow, Sean Hannity. You\u2019ve got really a whole raft of great guys, Mark Levin, and of course the     Breitbart News Daily and Breitbart Weekend shows,\u201d he recommended. Bannon anticipates that 2017 will be as much of an \u201cexciting time\u201d as 2016 was. \u201cWe don\u2019t like to try to guess what\u2019s going to happen in the future, but I\u2019ve got to tell you, I think people were very engaged in this election, and I think will be very engaged as time goes forward. The key is to hold people accountable. The hobbits, or the deplorables, had a great run in \u201916. Everybody mocked them and ridiculed them, and now they\u2019ve spoken. I think \u201917 is going to be a very exciting year,\u201d he predicted. \u201cI noticed on Breitbart over the last month or two, as either certain appointments were made or certain things were done that didn\u2019t comport with behavior that the deplorables or the hobbits thought were correct, it was interesting to see some of the articles written on the site, and the intensity in the comments,\u201d said Bannon.  \u201cI think that\u2019s great,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are engaged. They feel like they have a voice. Just continue on. I know that on the show, you guys have been doing a great job every day with the production team and the great folks at SiriusXM. So it\u2019s just going to be a great year. Let\u2019s just stay engaged. \u201d He concluded by applauding Boyle for doing a great job and said to the Breitbart News audience and callers, \u201cI really miss you guys. Have a great New Year, and look forward to talking with you guys early in 2017. \u201d Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern.
