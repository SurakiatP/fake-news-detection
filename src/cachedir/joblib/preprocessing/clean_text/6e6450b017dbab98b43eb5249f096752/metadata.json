[Members of the New York state Board of Regents voted on Monday to eliminate the literacy exam which revealed the prospective teachers\u2019 poor reading and writing skills, saying the controversial test is \u201cflawed\u201d and that it puts Latino and   teacher applicants at an unfair disadvantage.  Advocates of testing said the decision to kill the literacy test will lower teaching standards, especially for minority students in the city.  \u201cEliminating the [test just] to increase the number of unqualified, unprepared Black and Latino prospective teachers is the most racist and destructive action taken under the guise of diversifying NY\u2019s teachers,\u201d said Mona Davids, President of the New York City Parents Union, adding:  We, Black and Latino parents, do not want teachers who cannot pass a basic literacy test. We don\u2019t care about the color or race of the teacher, we want highly effective teachers teaching our children. \u201cIt\u2019s alarming because we\u2019ve now abandoned or watered down the teacher evaluation process, and now we\u2019re lowering the bar for entry certification as well,\u201d said Charles Sahm, Director of Education policy at the Conservative think tank Manhattan Institute. \u201cIt is deeply disappointing that the Regents and State Education Department are lowering the bar for teacher literacy skills and astonishing that there has been virtually no public discussion of the potential impact on student learning,\u201d said Ian Rosenblum, the Executive Director of Education   York, a   advocacy organization that promotes high academic achievement for students of color and   students. \u201cWe should be focusing on ensuring that prospective teachers receive the support they need in teacher preparation programs rather than weakening the teacher certification standards that can help ensure students have equitable access to strong educators,\u201d he said.  The Academic Literacy Skills Test, one of the four exams aspiring teachers in New York must take to become certified, was introduced in 2013 to ensure teachers had strong language skills and to assess the ability to master the Common Core standards for English. Considered the hardest exam out of the four, it found that 32 percent of aspiring teachers statewide failed the test  \u2014   even though it was passed by teachers who just met   English standards.  The exam began to draw controversy when data from the State Education Department showed that only 41 percent of black   and 46 percent of Hispanic   passed on the first try, compared to 64 percent of white test takers. This disparate result also cut the pool of eligible teaching candidates by 20 percent in just one year. State officials defended their vote to let the least literate teachers into classrooms.  \u201cWe\u2019re not getting rid of literacy, so let\u2019s dispel that right now,\u201d said Kathleen Cashin, who chairs the board committee. \u201cJust because the word \u2018literacy\u2019 is on the test doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a good test, does it? And if it\u2019s not a good test, our students [teachers] shouldn\u2019t be subjected to it. \u201d Cashin added, \u201cIt\u2019s just that if you have a flawed test, does that raise standards or does that lower standards?\u201d State Education Commissioner MaryEllen Elia also supported the Board of Regents\u2019s removal of the test. \u201cThe Regents and I continue to seek out expert advice from educators, parents and the public as we make important policy decisions,\u201d Elia said, adding: In this case, the experts and practitioners have suggested changes to our certification requirements that will help support teacher candidates and ensure students are taught by   teachers while helping to address the national teacher shortage at the same time. New York\u2019s teaching certification requirements remain some of the most rigorous in the country, requiring the vast majority of teaching candidates to pass three assessments before earning certification. To replace the ALST, the New York State Education Department recommending on modifying one of the three remaining exams, the Educating All Students (EAS) test to \u201cassesses both students\u2019 ability to teach a diverse population and also their literacy skills. \u201d Since the federal ruling which supported the test, the Board of Regents, a powerful   panel that sets education policy for New York, established an edTPA Task Force in 2016 to review issues with the teacher certification exams. According to, The Task Force subsequently complained about \u201cthe cost of the exam, the ongoing need for the exam in light of the other required exams and the total number of exams required for certification. \u201d Despite the 2015 ruling and findings from the Task Force that found no racial bias, members of the Task Force still claim the ALST exam has caused a shortage of minority teachers.  \u201cHaving a white workforce really doesn\u2019t match our student body anymore,\u201d Leslie Soodak, a professor at Pace University, who also serves as a member of the Task Force. \u201cWe want high standards, without a doubt. Not every given test is going to get us there. \u201d New York education leaders defended killing the test.  \u201cThe changes we advanced today strike the right balance for both teachers and students,\u201d Board of Regents Chancellor Betty A. Rosa said in a statement. \u201cCandidates for certification will still be required to demonstrate their teaching skills and knowledge before entering the classroom. At the same time, we are eliminating costly and unnecessary testing requirements that create unfair obstacles to certification for many applicants. \u201d According to the Albany   Rosa slammed the critics who are critical of the changes, calling it \u201cinsulting. \u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got individuals out there who don\u2019t even know what this [literacy] test looks like,\u201d Rosa said. \u201cThe only thing they know is they hear the word \u2018literacy\u2019 and they don\u2019t realize these people are going through a bachelor\u2019s degree, English classes, writing classes. Getting a degree and all of that stuff becomes negated, and it\u2019s so insulting that people make this an issue without having the complete story. \u201d \u201cThe changes adopted by the Regents will, when fixed, fix some of the worst problems associated with the botched   of edTPA and   testing for aspiring teachers while maintaining high standards for those students who wish to enter the profession,\u201d the teacher union said in a statement. \u201cEliminating the duplicative Academic Literacy Skills Test (ALST)  \u2014   are pluses for students, and we support these changes. \u201d Advocates for better education were not mollified by the promise of from the   advocates.  \u201cThe Regents eliminating the ALST is again putting the interests of adults before our children,\u201d Davids said. \u201cBy lowering the bar for prospective teachers to please the teachers union and   diploma mills, Schools of Education, the Regents is completely destroying the futures of Black and Latino students. The majority of students do not read, write or do math at grade level and we need teachers who are literate and effective. \u201d \u201cIt is important that we increase the share of black and Hispanic teachers, and we certainly don\u2019t have enough here or anywhere, Sahm said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is the way to go. This is a literacy exam. If you\u2019re going to be a teacher in New York state, this is a criterion you should be able to meet. \u201d '"}, "time": 1742563933.3722785}
