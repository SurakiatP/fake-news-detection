[The Philippine Star reports that Duterte made the joke while addressing the 2nd Mechanized Infantry Brigade on Friday, who would soon deploy into the increasingly deadly war zone in Marawi, Mindanao, where Duterte has imposed martial law. The jihadist Maute group invaded the city last week in response to a police raid on the hideout of Isnilon Hapilon, the head of Islamic State affiliate Abu Sayyaf. The Maute group has also pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, and its members appear to be cooperating with Abu Sayyaf.  \u201cFor this martial law, and the consequences of martial law, and the ramifications of martial law, I and I alone would be responsible,\u201d Duterte told the soldiers, adding in Filipino, \u201cJust work, I\u2019ll take care of it. I will be the one to imprison you. If you have committed rape three times, I\u2019ll take responsibility for it. If you marry four, son of a bitch, you\u2019ll get beaten up. \u201d \u201cFight back.   \u2026     I\u2019ll give you everything you need,\u201d he told the soldiers. Duterte previously told his army to \u201cspare no one\u201d in Marawi and has allowed warrantless searches and arrests on all of Mindanao, the southern island Duterte calls home. His spokesman, Ernesto Abella, explained the rape joke as an attempt to use \u201cheightened bravado\u201d to energize the troops. Duterte, he said, was \u201cdecisively acting, speaking with heightened bravado, that law and order would be brought back in these areas of rebellion. \u201d The joke has received wide condemnation from both relevant political entities and Twitter celebrities like Chelsea Clinton. Within the Philippines, politicians in the Duterte government have rejected it. \u201cIt is an injustice to our soldiers that what\u2019s being implied is because it is martial law, they are already thinking, or that they have the license, to commit a crime as heinous as rape,\u201d Vice President Leni Robredo said. \u201cDuterte\u2019s   comments only confirm some of the worst fears of human rights activists that the Duterte government will not just turn a blind eye to possible military abuses in Mindanao, but may actively encourage them,\u201d Human Rights Watch\u2019s Phelim Kine said in a statement. This is not the first time Duterte has come under fire for a joke about rape. During his presidential campaign last year, Duterte remarked that it was a \u201cwaste\u201d that an Australian woman had been gang raped in his native Davao City, lamenting that he \u201cshould have been first\u201d to have sex with her because he was the mayor at the time. Duterte refused to apologize and threatened to cut diplomatic ties with the United States if the government condemned the joke. He handily won the presidency and took over as head of state in June 2016. The Islamist insurgency in Marawi is the greatest challenge Duterte has faced as president so far. He responded to the raid of the city  \u2014   in which jihadists have so far abducted priests, killed Christians and Muslim \u201ctraitors\u201d who could not recite Islamic prayers, freed more than 100 jihadists from a local prison, and flown the Islamic State flag over the city\u2019s mosques. \u201cIf I think that you should die, you will die. If you fight us, you will die. If there is an open defiance, you will die,\u201d Duterte promised the terrorists last week. While Mindanao is home to a substantial Muslim population, the Philippines is an 86 percent Catholic country, with another six percent of citizens identifying as Christian  . Only about five percent of the country identifies as Muslim. Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.'"}, "time": 1742564160.1668353}
