When a reporter asked the former secretary of state about the Project Veritas undercover videos , which featured disgraced former Democratic operatives Scott Foval and Bob Creamer bragging about provoking violence at Trump rallies and perpetrating mass voter fraud, Clinton panicked and pulled the plug on the entire press conference. \u201cI know nothing about this,\u201d said Clinton. \u201cI\u2019m not \u2014 I can\u2019t deal with every one of [James O\u2019Keefe\u2019s] conspiracy theories but I hope you all have something to eat and something to drink on the way back to New York. Thank you!\u201d \\nConspiracy theories? Was she really trying to imply that videotaped confessions from two of her surrogates amount to a \u201cconspiracy theory?\u201d Yes, she was. It\u2019s become something of a habit for her \u2014 every time Hillary wants to deny plain facts she calls them a \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d \u2014 which is quite delicious coming from Ms. \u201cVast Rightwing Conspiracy\u201d herself. \\nTo call something a \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d doesn\u2019t reveal much about its validity. Of course, some conspiracy theories are legitimately kooky. Tune in to Coast to Coast AM for a while to see what I\u2019m talking about, or listen to Jesse Ventura expound on secret US government weather control machines in Alaska. Most of these loony conspiracy theories originate on the political Left, by the way, such as the assertion that Lee Harvey Oswald was \u201csheep-dipped\u201d to look like a communist so that JFK\u2019s real capitalist/imperialist murderers could make a clean getaway. \\nBut other conspiracy theories are at least plausible. Whenever two or more people plot in secret, that\u2019s a conspiracy. Anyone who suspects that a conspiracy\u2019s afoot is by definition a conspiracy theorist. If you come home from vacation to find a car parked on your lawn and the back yard strewn with red Solo cups, you might suspect that your teenaged sons conspired to throw a raging party. That\u2019s a conspiracy theory. Watergate was a conspiracy among at least the four burglars. The ensuing coverup was a conspiracy that reached all the way up to the president. Watergate has been proven to most people\u2019s satisfaction so we don\u2019t think of it as a \u201ctheory\u201d anymore, but there was a time, in the nascent stages of the investigation, when the whole picture was not yet known. In other words, it was a conspiracy theory \u2014 and yet it turned out to be true. \\nHillary Clinton employs the term \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d because of its derisive connotation. What she means by it is that a certain accusation \u2014 in this case that her campaign has engaged in illegal election tampering \u2014 is so absurd that it would be a waste of her time to respond. It\u2019s crazy talk . File it over there with alien abductions and Illuminati shadow governments. \\nUnfortunately for Hillary, the \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d alleged by Project Veritas happens to be very credible. Just listen to Democratic operative Scott Foval\u2019s videotaped confession: \\nWe\u2019ve been busing people in to deal with you f***ing assholes [Republicans] for fifty years and we\u2019re not going to stop now. We\u2019re just going to find a different way to do it. \\nFoval\u2019s \u201cdifferent way\u201d is using rental cars rather than buses to get impostors from polling place to polling place on election day. That\u2019s a conspiracy theory for sure but not an unreasonable one. It\u2019s the same old shenanigans Democrats have been pulling since the heyday of Tammany Hall. Lying, cheating, and ballot box-stuffing \u2014 it\u2019s what Democrats do. Richard Daley did it in Chicago, Lyndon Johnson did it in Texas, and Hillary Clinton\u2019s doing it nationwide. \\nHillary Clinton and her media sycophants have gotten a lot of mileage out of the \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d dodge this election season. When Mrs. Clinton was haunted by persistent rumors of ill health, the media countered them with accusations of conspiratorial thinking. In a column conveniently titled \u201cCan We Just Stop Talking About Hillary Clinton\u2019s Health Now?\u201d the Washington Post\u2019s Chris Cillizza wrote : \\nBeyond the Clinton conspiracy theorists who believe she had something to do with Vince Foster\u2019s death and that she was secretly responsible for everything from Y2K to the SpaceX explosion last week, it\u2019s hard to plausibly insist, based on the available data, that Clinton is ill. \\nHuffPo contributor Melissa Jeltsen went even further, blaming both conspiratorial thinking and \u2014 you guess it! \u2014 bigotry : \u201cLet\u2019s get real: The wild conspiracy theories around Clinton\u2019s health are a convenient way to mask misogyny inside \u2018legitimate\u2019 medical concerns.\u201d \\nAs it turns out, those \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d weren\u2019t so \u201cwild\u201d after all. Hillary Clinton later collapsed after a 9/11 memorial service but refused to go to the hospital for fear that her critics would be proven right. Thank goodness for camera phones \u2014 if the incident hadn\u2019t been recorded, Hillary would be claiming that it never happened while maligning anyone who said otherwise as a nutty conspiracy theorist \u2014 and the press would be helping her. After the incident, Clinton admitted (or \u201cadmitted\u201d) that she was stricken with walking pneumonia, a conveniently transitory illness. If you suspect that she suffers from a more permanent medical condition you\u2019re probably a \u201cconspiracy theorist.\u201d It\u2019s becoming painfully obvious that Hillary Clinton\u2019s definition of a \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d is anything that contradicts her lies. \\nThe \u201cconspiracy theorist\u201d epithet has become the media\u2019s lazy retort to every possible attack on their candidate \u2014 and make no mistake about it, she is their candidate. Earlier this month, CNN contributor Jackie Kucinich dismissed talk of Bill Clinton\u2019s sexual assaults on various women as \u201cconspiracy theory land,\u201d which is frankly outrageous. Bill\u2019s accusers form a line around the block, almost as long as Bill Cosby\u2019s. We know at very least that he\u2019s a sexual harasser and, if the most serious accusations lodged against him are true, a rapist as well. He has a track record that simply cannot be denied. Oddly enough this \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d would actually be a conspiracy theory if, as Kucinich implies, the accusers were lying because it would imply some shadowy group working behind the scenes to smear Bill Clinton with an endless barrage of slander. The simpler, non-conspiratorial explanation is just that Bill is a horndog off his leash. \\nJackie Kucinich is in fact a bona fide member of her own little conspiracy. In April 2015, the Clinton campaign held an \u201coff the record\u201d cocktail party with friendly reporters hosted at the Manhattan home of prominent Clinton supporter Joel Benenson. Among those journalists (if you can call them that) was Jackie Kucinich. According to a hacked email: \\nMuch of the group consists of influential reporters, anchors, and editors. The goals of the dinner include: (1) Giving reporters their first thoughts from team HRC in advance of the announcement (2) Setting expectations for the announcement and launch period (3) Framing the HRC message and framing the race (4) Enjoying a Frida[y] night drink before working more. [Emphasis added.] \\nWhile many reporters on the list have impotently protested that their presence at the event does not amount to media coordination with a campaign, it\u2019s hard to make the case that Kucinich is not a Clinton lackey after she spouted Clinton campaign talking points about Bill\u2019s predatory nature on national television. It takes a certain gall for Kucinich, one of Hillary Clinton\u2019s known co-conspirators, to go on television and whine about \u201cconspiracy theories.\u201d \\nNearly everyone on earth harbors \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d because conspiracies really do happen. Most people, however, prefer not to think of their own conspiracy theories as such because of the negative connotation associated with the term. Some conspiracy theories are downright silly but others are quite plausible. There are enough real conspiracies in the world to concentrate on the ones that are reasonably substantiated, such as Hillary Clinton\u2019s coordination with dirty tricksters Foval and Creamer. As the conspiracy theory television program The X-Files used to say, \u201cThe Truth Is Out There.\u201d Don\u2019t be afraid to pursue it.'"}, "time": 1742563361.047666}
